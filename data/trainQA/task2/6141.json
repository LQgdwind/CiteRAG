      "content": "Paper Title: Information Design in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nReinforcement learning (RL) studies how a world-agnostic agent makes sequential decisions to maximize utility.\nIt gains increasing popularity and achieves milestone progress in Atari [ref]46 , Go , Poker   , video games  , and bioinformatics 6, economics [ref]59, etc.\nThe canonical RL formulation requires the environment to be stationary, meaning that other agents could not respond to the ego agent’s policy by adapting their own policies .\nThe assumption does not hold in real applications.\nInstead, the ego agent, in general, cannot dictate other agents and needs to influence others so their adaptation becomes more helpful and less harmful. A substantial subarea of RL, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), investigates the interaction and influence among multiple RL agents when they are placed in a shared environment.\nIt has obtained promising results thanks to the generality and diversity of its settings. Examples are pure cooperative games and pure competitive games.\nThe pure cooperative setting studies agents that work on a consentaneous goal.\nIn this case, influencing other agents is relatively straightforward.\nThe pure competitive setting studies zero-sum games.\nIn this case, influencing other agents is less likely to be practical or even impossible for two-player games. In between these two extreme cases arises the large, more realistic but less charted area of mixed-motive MARL, where influencing other learning agents becomes a main challenge   . Studies in computational economics have distilled different ways of directly influencing a rational, self-interested agent into two types:\nby providing tangible goods (mechanism design) and by providing information (information design)  . For the former type, tangible goods align perfectly with RL rewards because rewards are natural and utilitarian.\nSeveral works in RL design algorithms for the ego agent to use the reward to incentivize other agents [ref]57  [ref]59 9.\nFor the latter type, the ego agent must possess information that is helpful to the other agent while not observed by the other agent.\nThe ego agent then sends a message that partially reveals this information in the hope that the other agents respect the message and act in a way that benefits the ego agent.\nThe key observation in information design is that the message needs to be respected, which indicates that the message, apart from benefiting the ego agent, must also benefit the receiving agent. Two difficulties persist in modeling and solving information design with reinforcement learning.\nThe first challenge is the issue of non-stationarity.\nThe receiver’s environment changes as the sender’s signaling scheme is updated.\nIf the sender uses policy gradient, it does not consider how modifications to its scheme affect the receiver’s learning .\nOn top of this, the signal impacts not only the updating phase but also the sampling phase.\nIn fact, the receiver uses the signals from the sender as part of its input.\nThe signaling scheme will, therefore, directly affect the trajectory generation.\nThis means that specific techniques in mechanism design, such as hyper-gradient, are unsuitable, and new methods need to be formulated [ref]57. The second challenge lies in how the message can potentially be respected by the receiver.\nThe most general signal space is the set of all state subsets and is exponentially large.\nAn analysis analogous to the revelation principle proves that there is an optimal signaling scheme that uses a signal space of the same size as the action space of the receiver, which leads to the classic obedience constraints and the linear program formulation of information design 8 .\nHowever, under the revelation principle, a signal suggests an exact action, which means the receiver will be dictated by the sender if it respects the message.\nWhen both parties are reinforcement learning agents, such want of dictatorship does not build trust and respect between them and instead inevitably drives them to the equilibrium where all signals are ignored.\nCounter-intuitively, we find that the revelation principle can be removed under the learning context, and one will need to resort to more persuasive signaling schemes and the corresponding update methods. This paper investigates how an informative ego sender could learn to influence a self-interested receiver with its informational advantage. We propose Markov signaling game for mixed-motive communication, where in each timestep, the sender encodes and sends a message to the receiver.\nAfter the signaling step, the receiver will act based on the message and its observation.\nWe derive the signaling gradient to learn the signaling scheme that addresses the non-stationarity problem.\nThis gradient considers the additional gradient chain from the receiver’s policy and is proved to be an unbiased gradient estimation.\nIt agrees with our intuition that the influence of the sender on the behavior of the receiver should be reflected in the gradient term.\nBased on the signaling gradient, we design the extended obedience constraints for incentive compatibility of the signaling scheme.111A mechanism is said to be incentive compatible if every participant’s optimal strategy, given the strategies of others and the mechanism’s rules, leads to an outcome that is desired by the mechanism designer.\nWe further provide an approximation of the gradient of such constraints, which solves the second challenge because it is suitable for learning algorithms while preserving the optimum of the ego agent.\nInformation design in MARL is then end-to-end differentiable and learnable with our algorithm.\n Numerical experiments on Recommendation Letter and Reaching Goals demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.\nExtended discussions are provided for the method and the empirical results.\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: Reinforcement learning (RL) studies how a world-agnostic agent makes sequential decisions to maximize utility.\nIt gains increasing popularity and achieves milestone progress in Atari [ref]46 , Go , Poker   , video games  , and bioinformatics 6, economics [ref]59, etc.\nThe canonical RL formulation requires the environment to be stationary, meaning that other agents could not\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
