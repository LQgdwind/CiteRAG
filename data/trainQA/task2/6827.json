      "content": "Paper Title: Co-Evolution of Pose and Mesh for 3D Human Body Estimation from Video\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecovering 3D human mesh from an image or a video is an essential yet challenging task for many applications, such as human-robot interaction, virtual reality, and motion analysis.\nThe challenges of this task arise from the 2D-to-3D ambiguity, cluttered background, and occlusions.\nRecently, many studies   [ref]8  [ref]19  have been proposed to recover the 3D human mesh from a single image, which can generally be categorized into RGB-based methods and pose-based methods. RGB-based methods predict human mesh end-to-end from image pixels, typically predicting the pose and shape parameters of the parametric human model (e.g., SMPL ) to generate the 3D human mesh.\nHowever, the representation ability of the parametric model is constrained by the limited pose and shape space [ref]18 [ref]19. To overcome this limitation, non-parametric approaches have been proposed to predict the 3D coordinates of mesh vertices directly, which generally use Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) [ref]8  or Transformers  4  to capture the relations among vertices.\nIn contrast, pose-based methods leverage 2D pose detectors   as the front-end to recover human mesh from the detected 2D poses.\nWith the significant advancements in 2D pose detection, pose-based methods have become increasingly robust and lightweight, making them popular for real-world applications 4. Despite the significant progress in single-image 3D human mesh recovery, these methods still struggle to capture temporally consistent human motion from videos.\nTo solve this problem, several works    5 extend single image-based methods to video cases.\nThey use a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  to extract static features for each frame, then train a temporal network to predict SMPL parameters.\nAlthough these video-based methods significantly improve the temporal consistency of 3D human motion, there exists a trade-off between per-frame accuracy and motion smoothness for the following two main reasons:\n1) The highly coupled image feature.\nThe extracted image features in deep CNN layers are low-resolution and tightly coupled , which inevitably discard the spatial information in the image 3.\n2) The limited representation ability of the parametric human model. The SMPL model represents pose using 3D rotation, which might face periodicity and discontinuity issues [ref]18, making pose prediction in videos more challenging.\nBesides, the local and swift mesh deformations described by the shape parameters are difficult to learn. In recent years, video-based 3D human pose estimation from the detected 2D poses has achieved high pose accuracy and motion smoothness  3, which inspires us that the skeleton sequence contains sufficient spatial and temporal pose information of human motion. But for the mesh recovery task, detailed shape information is needed, which can be acquired from the image features.\nBased on the above observations,\nwe propose the Pose and Mesh Co-Evolution network (PMCE) to recover 3D human mesh from videos in a non-parametric way. We decouple the 3D human mesh recovery task into two consecutive parts: 1) video-based 3D pose estimation and 2) mesh vertices regression from 3D pose and image feature, where the latter is the focus. Specifically, in the first part,\nwe propose a two-stream encoder. One stream takes a 2D pose sequence detected from input images to estimate the mid-frame 3D pose, and the other stream takes static image features extracted from images and aggregates them for a temporal image feature.\nIn the second part, we design a co-evolution decoder that performs pose and mesh interactions with an image-guided Adaptive Layer Normalization (AdaLN). AdaLN adjusts the statistical characteristics of joint and vertex features to make the pose and mesh better fit the human body shape.\nAs shown in Figure 1, compared to previous video-based methods, PMCE achieves better performance in terms of per-frame accuracy and temporal consistency on 3DPW 2 and Human3.6M  datasets. In summary, our contributions are as follows: We propose a Pose and Mesh Co-Evolution network (PMCE) for recovering 3D human mesh from video. It decouples the task into two parts: video-based 3D pose estimation, and mesh vertices regression\nby image-guided pose and mesh co-evolution,\nachieving accurate and temporally consistent results. We design the co-evolution decoder that performs pose and mesh interactions guided by our proposed AdaLN. AdaLN adjusts the statistical characteristics of joint and vertex features based on the image feature to make them conform to the human body shape. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging datasets like 3DPW, reducing MPJPE by 12.1%, PVE by 8.4% and acceleration error by 8.5%.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: such as human-robot interaction, virtual reality, and motion analysis.\nThe challenges of this task arise from the 2D-to-3D ambiguity, cluttered background, and occlusions.\nRecently, many studies   [ref]8  [ref]19  have been proposed to recover the 3D human mesh from a single image, which can generally be categorized into RGB-based methods and pose-based methods.
