      "content": "Paper Title: Larger Corner-Free Sets from Combinatorial Degenerations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur main result is progress on Problem 1.1 by proving new lower bounds for the corner problem over the groups 𝔽2subscript𝔽2\\mathbb{F}_{2} and 𝔽3subscript𝔽3\\mathbb{F}_{3}, which we arrive at via a new method to lower bound the Shannon capacity of directed hypergraphs. Equivalently, in the language of communication complexity, we obtain improved protocols for the Eval problem. The lower bound of Linial, Pitassi and Shraibman [ref]34 for the corner problem was obtained by explicit construction of an independent set (i.e. a set that does not contain edges) in the second power of a hypergraph, which is the natural approach for such lower bounds. We improve on this bound by observing that it is actually sufficient to construct a set which does not contain “cycles”.\nFor graphs, the notion of cycle is clear but for hypergraphs there are many possible definitions, and we initiate a careful study of this (and believe that this will be a worthwile avenue for further study independently).\nHere, to get new bounds we use the notion of combinatorial degeneration to model such a “cycle”. We will say more about this in a moment. Using the combinatorial degeneration method on the corner hypergraphs that characterize the corner problem we find new bounds for Problem 1.1 for the groups 𝔽2nsuperscriptsubscript𝔽2𝑛\\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n} and 𝔽3nsuperscriptsubscript𝔽3𝑛\\mathbb{F}_{3}^{n}. These are as follows (in the three equivalent forms): For the corner and Eval problem over 𝔽2nsubscriptsuperscript𝔽𝑛2\\mathbb{F}^{n}_{2} we have: D3​(𝖤𝗏𝖺𝗅𝔽2n)≤0.24​n+𝒪​(log⁡n)subscriptD3subscript𝖤𝗏𝖺𝗅superscriptsubscript𝔽2𝑛0.24𝑛𝒪𝑛\\mathrm{D}_{3}(\\mathsf{Eval}_{\\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}})\\leq 0.24n+\\mathcal{O}(\\log n) r∠​(𝔽2n)≥393npoly​(n)subscript𝑟∠superscriptsubscript𝔽2𝑛superscript339𝑛poly𝑛r_{\\!\\angle}({\\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}})\\geq\\frac{\\sqrt[ref]3{39}^{n}}{\\mathrm{poly}(n)} Θ​(H)≥393Θ𝐻339\\Theta(H)\\geq\\sqrt[ref]3{39} For the corner and Eval problem over 𝔽3nsubscriptsuperscript𝔽𝑛3\\mathbb{F}^{n}_{3} we have: D3​(𝖤𝗏𝖺𝗅𝔽3n)≤0.37​n+𝒪​(log⁡n)subscriptD3subscript𝖤𝗏𝖺𝗅superscriptsubscript𝔽3𝑛0.37𝑛𝒪𝑛\\mathrm{D}_{3}(\\mathsf{Eval}_{\\mathbb{F}_{3}^{n}})\\leq 0.37n+\\mathcal{O}(\\log n) r∠​(𝔽3n)≥7npoly​(n)subscript𝑟∠superscriptsubscript𝔽3𝑛superscript7𝑛poly𝑛r_{\\!\\angle}({\\mathbb{F}_{3}^{n}})\\geq\\frac{7^{n}}{\\mathrm{poly}(n)} Θ​(H)≥7Θ𝐻7\\Theta(H)\\geq 7. Let us discuss on a high level the history and ideas behind the combinatorial degeneration method.\nCombinatorial degeneration is an existing concept from algebraic complexity theory. It was (in a slightly different form) introduced and studied by Strassen in [46, Section 6].444Degeneration of tensors is a powerful approximation notion in the theory of tensors. Combinatorial degeneration is the “combinatorial” or “torus” version of this kind of approximation. Combinatorial degeneration was introduced by Bürgisser, Clausen and Shokrollahi [14, Definition 15.29] based on the notion of M-degeneration for tensors defined and studied by Strassen in . (For the formal definition of combinatorial degeneration, see Definition 2.15.)\nStrassen’s original application of combinatorial degeneration was to study matrix multiplication, namely to prove the fundamental result that surprisingly many independent scalar multiplications can be reduced (in an appropriate algebraic manner) to matrix multiplication [46, Theorem 6.6].555Strassen’s result is asymptotically optimal. Strassen’s proof resembles Behrend’s construction of arithmetic-progression-free sets. Also note that this is precisely the opposite of the problem of reducing matrix multiplication to as few independent scalar multiplications as possible. The latter corresponds precisely to the arithmetic complexity of matrix multiplication.\nStrassen then used this result to prove his Laser method [46, Section 7], vastly generalizating the method that Coppersmith and Winograd had introduced in their construction of matrix multiplication algorithms .666The book [14, Definition 15.29 and Lemma 15.31] gives a different proof of the Laser method which relies even more strongly on combinatorial degeneration. Combinatorial degeneration was used more broadly to construct large induced matchings in the setting of important combinatorial problems, namely the Sunflower problem by Alon, Shpilka and Umans [4, Lemma 3.9] and the Cap Set problem by Kleinberg, Sawin and Speyer . These results are often referred to as the “multicolored” versions of the problem at hand, as opposed to the “single color” version.\nThese ideas were developed further in the context of matrix multiplication barriers by Alman and Williams [2, Lemma 6] and in the study of tensors by Christandl, Vrana and Zuiddam [18, Theorem 4.11]. Crucially, all of the above applications use combinatorial degeneration to construct induced matchings in (k𝑘k-uniform k𝑘k-partite) hypergraphs.\nHowever, we use combinatorial degeneration in a novel manner to construct independent sets in hypergraphs instead of induced matchings. In this context an independent set should be thought of as a symmetric induced matching. Constructing large independent sets is a much harder task than constructing large induced matchings, as witnessed by the fact that the “multicolored” cap set problem is solved  while its “single color” version is not. Similarly, for the corner problem, as we will discuss in Section 1.4, the asymptotic growth of the largest induced matching can be shown to be maximal, whereas the main question of study of this paper is whether the same holds for the largest independent set.\nWe expect our new way of using combinatorial degeneration to be useful in the study of other problems besides the corner problem as well, and thus think it is of independent interest. On a more technical level, combinatorial degeneration is a notion that compares sets of k𝑘k-tuples by means of algebraic conditions. Our “universe” is I1×⋯×Iksubscript𝐼1⋯subscript𝐼𝑘I_{1}\\times\\cdots\\times I_{k} where I1,…,Iksubscript𝐼1…subscript𝐼𝑘I_{1},\\ldots,I_{k} are finite sets.\nThen for sets Φ⊆Ψ⊆I1×⋯×IkΦΨsubscript𝐼1⋯subscript𝐼𝑘\\Phi\\subseteq\\Psi\\subseteq I_{1}\\times\\dots\\times I_{k} we say that ΦΦ\\Phi is a combinatorial degeneration of ΨΨ\\Psi, and write Ψ⊵Φcontains-as-subgroup-or-equalsΨΦ\\Psi\\unrhd\\Phi, if there are maps ui:Ii→ℤ:subscript𝑢𝑖→subscript𝐼𝑖ℤu_{i}:I_{i}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{Z} such that for every x=(x1,…,xk)∈I1×⋯×Ik𝑥subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑘subscript𝐼1⋯subscript𝐼𝑘x=(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{k})\\in I_{1}\\times\\dots\\times I_{k}, if x∈Ψ∖Φ𝑥ΨΦx\\in\\Psi\\setminus\\Phi, then ∑i=1kui​(xi)>0superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑘subscript𝑢𝑖subscript𝑥𝑖0\\sum_{i=1}^{k}u_{i}(x_{i})>0, and if x∈Φ𝑥Φx\\in\\Phi, then ∑i=1kui​(xi)=0superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑘subscript𝑢𝑖subscript𝑥𝑖0\\sum_{i=1}^{k}u_{i}(x_{i})=0. Thus the maps uisubscript𝑢𝑖u_{i} together are able to distinguish between the elements in the set ΦΦ\\Phi (which may be thought of as our “goal” set, i.e. a set with good properties) and the elements in the difference Ψ∖ΦΨΦ\\Psi\\setminus\\Phi.\nAs a quick example of a combinatorial degeneration, let Then we find a combinatorial degeneration Ψ⊵Φcontains-as-subgroup-or-equalsΨΦ\\Psi\\unrhd\\Phi by defining the maps ui:{0,1}→ℤ:subscript𝑢𝑖→01ℤu_{i}:\\{0,1\\}\\to\\mathbb{Z} simply by setting u1​(0)=u2​(0)=u3​(0)=0subscript𝑢10subscript𝑢20subscript𝑢300u_{1}(0)=u_{2}(0)=u_{3}(0)=0, and u1​(1)=−1subscript𝑢111u_{1}(1)=-1, u2​(1)=u3​(1)=1subscript𝑢21subscript𝑢311u_{2}(1)=u_{3}(1)=1. We apply the idea of combinatorial degeneration in the following fashion to get Shannon capacity lower bounds: Let H=(V,E)𝐻𝑉𝐸H=(V,E) be a directed k𝑘k-uniform hypergraph. Let S⊆V𝑆𝑉S\\subseteq V be a subset of vertices. Define the sets and Suppose that Ψ⊵Φcontains-as-subgroup-or-equalsΨΦ\\Psi\\unrhd\\Phi is a combinatorial degeneration. Then we get the Shannon capacity lower bound Θ​(H)≥|S|Θ𝐻𝑆\\Theta(H)\\geq\\left|{S}\\right|. In other words, whereas S𝑆S in the statement of Theorem 1.3 may not be an independent set, we can via the algebraic conditions of combinatorial degeneration construct an independent set in the n𝑛nth power of the hypergraph of size approaching |S×n|superscript𝑆absent𝑛|S^{\\times n}|. Namely, the algebraic conditions allow us to select such an independent set using a natural type analysis of the labels given by the maps uisubscript𝑢𝑖u_{i}. Thus we may think of a set S𝑆S as above as an approximative independent set, which asymptotically we can turn into an actual independent set by means of Theorem 1.3. We note that, whereas it is relatively simple to verify for a given set S𝑆S that Ψ⊵Φcontains-as-subgroup-or-equalsΨΦ\\Psi\\unrhd\\Phi holds (with the notation of Theorem 1.3) via linear programming, it is seems much harder to find a large set S⊆V𝑆𝑉S\\subseteq V for which Ψ⊵Φcontains-as-subgroup-or-equalsΨΦ\\Psi\\unrhd\\Phi, given H𝐻H. We obtain our best lower bounds via an integer linear programming approach. The resulting combinatorial degenerations that we find are explicit and checkable by hand. We have yet to develop structural understanding of how the above combinatorial degenerations that exhibit the new capacity lower bounds arise (and we feel that deeper understanding of this may lead to more progress or even solve the corner problem), and leave the investigation of further generalizations and improvements to future work.\nAs a partial remedy to our limited understanding, we introduce the acyclic method as a tool to construct combinatorial degenerations. While the acyclic method does not recover the bounds of Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.2, it has the merits of being transparent and simple to apply. The acyclic method involves another notion of a set wihtout “cycles”, which implies a combinatorial degeneration, but whose conditions are simpler to check.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: capacity of directed hypergraphs.
