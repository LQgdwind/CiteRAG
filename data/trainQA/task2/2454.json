      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to Adversarially Blur Visual Object Tracking\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVisual object tracking (VOT).\nVOT is an important task in computer vision. Recently, a great number of trackers, which extract features with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are proposed and achieve amazing performance. Among these works, Siamese network-based methods   2 0     offline train Siamese networks and conduct online matching between search regions and the object template, which are significantly faster with high tracking performance. In particular, SiamRPN 2  embed the regional proposal network  in the naive Siamese tracker , allowing high-efficiency estimation of the object‚Äôs aspect ratio variation and achieving state-of-the-art tracking accuracy.\nAfter that, some works use historical frames to online update tracking models.\nFor example, DiMP  collects past frames‚Äô features and online predict convolution kernels that can estimate object‚Äôs position. Furthermore, PrDiMP  improves the loss function with KL divergence and information entropy from the perspective of probability distribution. KYS [ref]4 considers the correlation between previous frames and the current frame.\nThese trackers run beyond real time and get top accuracy on several benchmarks.\nAlthough great progress has been achieved, there are few works studying their robustness to motion blur. In this work, we identify a new way to achieve this goal by actively synthesizing adversarially motion blur to fool the state-of-the-art trackers. Motion blur synthesis.\nIn VOT task, motion blur is a very common scene due to the high-speed movement of the target. It is usually used to evaluate the quality of the trackers   . In recent years, motion blur synthesis has been extensively studied in the rendering community 9 . However, these methods usually require a complete understanding of the speed and depth of the scene as input. In order to get more realistic and high-quality images with motion blur, Brooks et al.  identify a simple solution that warps two instant images by optical flow  7 and fuses these intermediate frames with specific weights, to synthesize a blur picture.\nThis method is to synthesize realistic motion blur for the deblurring task while our work is used for adversarially blurring the frames for tracking.\nAnother related work, i.e., ABBA 2, takes a single image as its input and generates visually natural motion-blurred adversarial example to fool the deep neural network-based classification. Specifically, ABBA simulates the motion by adversarially shifting the object and background, respectively, neglecting the real motion in the scene. Different from ABBA, our approach focuses on visual object tracking with real object movement indicated by two adjacent frames.\nRecently, some techniques [ref]4   have been proposed to counter the interference of the environment. To this end, our method is proposed to better evaluate the robustness of these VOTs. Adversarial attack.\nExtensive works have proved that state-of-the-art deep neural networks are still vulnerable to adversarial attacks by adding visually imperceptible noises or natural degradation to original images     2.\nFGSM  perturbs normal examples along the gradient direction via the fast gradient sign method. MI-FGSM  integrates momentum term into the iterative process that can help stabilize the update directions. C&W  introduces three new attacks for different norms (L0,L2,L‚àûsubscriptùêø0subscriptùêø2subscriptùêøL_{0},L_{2},L_{\\infty}) through iterative optimization. However, the above methods are unable to meet the real-time requirements due to the limited speed 3. To realize the efficient attacking, 3 2 propose one-step attacks by offline training on the targeted model.\nHowever, these methods are designed for the classification task and could not attack trackers directly.\n More recently, some works have been proposed to attack visual object tracking. PAT  generates physical adversarial textures via a white-box attack. SPARK 3 studies how to adapt existing adversarial attacks on tracking. Chen et al.  propose to add adversarial perturbations on the template at the initial frame. CSA 3 raises a one-step method and makes objects invisible to trackers by forcing the predicted bounding box to shrink.\nDifferent from above works, we employ motion blur to perform adversarial attack. Our work is designed to address three challenges: how to synthesize natural motion blur that meets the motion of object and background in the video; how to make the blurred frame fool the state-of-the-art trackers easily; how to perform the adversarial blur attack efficiently.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the very first attempt in the community of adversarial attack.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: kernels that can estimate object‚Äôs position.
