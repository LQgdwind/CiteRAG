      "content": "Paper Title: Decision-Making with Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe present an experiment involving Bayesian hypothesis testing for detecting differentially expressed genes from single-cell transcriptomics data, a central problem in modern molecular biology. Single-cell RNA sequencing data (scRNA-seq) provides a noisy snapshot of the gene expression levels of cells  . It can reveal cell types and gene markers for each cell type as long as we have an accurate noise model . scRNA-seq data is a cell-by-gene matrix X𝑋X.\nFor cell n=1,…,N𝑛1…𝑁n=1,\\ldots,N and gene g=1,…,G𝑔1…𝐺g=1,\\ldots,G,\nentry Xn​gsubscript𝑋𝑛𝑔X_{ng} is the number of transcripts for gene g𝑔g observed in cell n𝑛n.\nHere we take as given that each cell comes paired with an observed cell-type label cnsubscript𝑐𝑛c_{n}. Single-cell Variational Inference (scVI)  is a hierarchical Bayes model  for scRNA-seq data. For our purposes here, it suffices to know that the latent variables hn​gsubscriptℎ𝑛𝑔h_{ng} represent the underlying gene expression level for gene g𝑔g in cell n𝑛n, corrected for a certain number of technical variations (e.g., sequencing depth effects). The corrected expression levels hn​gsubscriptℎ𝑛𝑔h_{ng} are more reflective of the real proportion of gene expression than the raw data X𝑋X . Log-fold changes based on hn​gsubscriptℎ𝑛𝑔h_{ng} can be used to detect differential expression (DE) of gene g𝑔g across cell types a𝑎a and b𝑏b  . Indeed, Bayesian decision theory helps decide between a model ℳ1gsuperscriptsubscriptℳ1𝑔\\mathcal{M}_{1}^{g} in which gene g𝑔g is DE and an alternative model ℳ0gsuperscriptsubscriptℳ0𝑔\\mathcal{M}_{0}^{g} in which gene g𝑔g is not DE. The hypotheses are where δ𝛿\\delta is a threshold defined by the practitioner. DE detection can therefore be performed by posterior estimation of log-fold change between two cells, xasubscript𝑥𝑎x_{a} and xbsubscript𝑥𝑏x_{b}, by estimating\npθ​(ℳ1g∣xa,xb)subscript𝑝𝜃conditionalsubscriptsuperscriptℳ𝑔1subscript𝑥𝑎subscript𝑥𝑏p_{\\theta}(\\mathcal{M}^{g}_{1}\\mid x_{a},x_{b})\nwith importance sampling.\nThe optimal decision rule for 0-1 loss is attained by thresholding the posterior log-fold change estimate.\nRather than directly setting this threshold, a practitioner typically picks a false discovery rate (FDR) f0subscript𝑓0f_{0} to target. To control the FDR,\nwe consider the multiple binary decision rule μk=(μgk,g∈G)superscript𝜇𝑘superscriptsubscript𝜇𝑔𝑘𝑔𝐺\\mu^{k}=(\\mu_{g}^{k},g\\in G) that consists of tagging as DE the k𝑘k genes with the highest estimates of log-fold change.\nWith this notation, the false discovery proportion (FDP) of such a decision rule is Following , we define the posterior expected FDR as\nFDR¯:=𝔼​[FDP∣xa,xb],assign¯FDR𝔼delimited-[]conditionalFDPsubscript𝑥𝑎subscript𝑥𝑏\\overline{\\mathrm{FDR}}:=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathrm{FDP}\\mid x_{a},x_{b}\\right],\nwhich can be computed from the differential expression probabilities of Eq. (12). We then set k𝑘k to the maximum value for which the posterior expected FDR is below f0subscript𝑓0f_{0}.\nIn this case, controlling the FDR requires estimating G𝐺G posterior expectations.\nTo quantify the ability of each method to control the FDR, we report the mean absolute error between the ground-truth FDR and the posterior expected FDR. We fitted the scVI model with all of the objective functions of interest. In addition, we used annealed importance sampling (AIS)  to approximate the posterior distribution once the model was fitted. AIS is computationally intensive, so we used 500500500 steps and 100100100 samples from the prior to keep the runtime manageable. Because the ground-truth FDR cannot be computed on real data, we generated scRNA-seq data according to a Poisson log-normal model (a popular choice for simulating scRNA-seq data  [ref]44) from five distinct cells types corresponding to 10,0001000010,000 cells and 100100100 genes. This model is meant to reflect both the biological signal and the technical effects of the experimental protocol. We provide further details of this experiment in Appendix H. VAE performs worst in terms of held-out log-likelihood, while χ𝜒\\textstyle\\chi-VAE performs best (Table 7).\nWe also evaluated the quality of the gene ranking for differential expression based on the AUPRC of the DE probabilities. The model learned with the VAE objective function has an AUPRC of 0.85, while all other combinations have an AUPRC of more than 0.95. Next, we investigate the role posterior uncertainty plays in properly estimating the FDR.\nTable 7 and Figure 7 report the mean absolute error (MAE) for FDR estimation over the 100 genes. The posterior expected FDR has a large error for any proposal based on the VAE model, which gets even worse using the plugin estimator. However, all of the other models yield a significantly lower error for any proposal. We provided the FDR curves in Appendix H. The VAE has highly inaccurate FDR control.\nThis suggests that the model learned by the original scVI training procedure (i.e., a VAE) cannot be used for FDR control even with AIS as the proposal.\nIWAE, WW, and χ𝜒\\textstyle\\chi-VAE, on the other hand, may be useful to a practitioner. Further, in this experiment WW slightly outperforms IWAE in terms of held-out IWELBO but not in terms of FDR MAE. Again, the variational distribution used to train the best generative model does not necessarily provide the best decisions.\nConversely, our three-step procedure (χ𝜒\\textstyle\\chi-VAE-MIS) has the best FDR estimates for this experiment, improving over all the single-proposal alternatives, as well as over the χ𝜒\\textstyle\\chi-VAE in conjunction with AIS.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: runtime manageable.
