      "content": "Paper Title: Talk, Don’t Write: A Study of Direct Speech-Based Image Retrieval\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPeople speak before they read and write. Humankind used speech exclusively long before the invention of writing. People also learn and use language in the real world—to collaborate, describe and relate their visual environment, talk about each other, and more. While it is hard to capture such environmental grounding broadly, a recent thread of research has focused on the constrained yet rich problem of learning representations of both speech and images using spoken image captions. Starting with Harwath and Glass’s collection of spoken captions for Flickr8k  [ref]2, much research has followed.\nA number of works address cognitive and linguistic questions, such as understanding how different learned layers correspond to visual stimuli  , learning linguistic units [ref]5  or how visually grounded representations and data can help understand lexical competition in phonemic processing . Other work addresses applied tasks, including multimodal retrieval   0, predicting written keywords given speech and image inputs 1, cross-modality alignment 2, retrieving speech in different languages using images as a pivot modality 3 4 5, and speech-to-speech retrieval 4 5). Speech-based image retrieval tasks are a dominant evaluation paradigm throughout this body of work. Despite this, it remains difficult to distill lessons about the practicality of speech-based retrieval or how it can be further improved.\nOne reason is that results have been reported on multiple datasets with different lengths and types of speech. Methodological differences also make comparisons difficult. While many models are variants of dual encoders 6 – a family of architectures well suited for retrieval – choices of speech and image encoders, pretraining methods, and other factors vary widely. To address these issues, we run extensive dual encoder experiments over three spoken image-caption datasets – Flickr Audio , Places Audio 7, and Localized Narratives 8 – which have different properties, including accents, length, and read versus spontaneous speech. Using our implementation, Milan (Multimodal Image and LAnguage Networks), we assess the impact of the choices of encoders, pretraining methods, speech representations, and other factors, and combine best practices to achieve state-of-the-art retrieval performance. Our primary contributions include: Showing the combined effectiveness of strong pretrained base representations for each modality 9    with pretraining for the joint speech-image task . Showing that speech domains impact pretraining: e.g., pretraining on synthetic US English speech and fine-tuning on Localized Narratives (Indian English) degrades performance versus no pretraining. Obtaining huge gains over state-of-the-art for speech-image retrieval: e.g., Milan bumps speech-to-image R@1 from 21.8% to 33.2% for Flickr Audio and 27.6% to 53.4% for Places Audio. We also establish the first speech-image retrieval results on Localized Narratives. Showing for the first time that encoding speech directly can be more effective than using ASR plus a text encoder – even when using a much stronger text encoder than prior work. ASR only wins for speech of US English speakers reading short written captions (Flickr Audio). Open sourcing Milan to enable reproducibility &\\& reuse.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: on the constrained yet rich problem of learning representations of both speech and images using spoken image captions.
