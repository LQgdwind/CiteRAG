      "content": "Paper Title: Non-Markovian Reward Modelling from Trajectory Labels via Interpretable Multiple Instance Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere is growing consensus around the view that aligned and beneficial AI requires a reframing of objectives as being contingent, uncertain, and learnable via interaction with humans [ref]35. In reinforcement learning (RL), this proposal has found one formalisation in reward modelling (RM): the inference of agent objectives from human preference information such as demonstrations, pairwise choices, approval labels, and corrections . Prior work in RM typically assumes that a human evaluates the return (quality) of a sequential trajectory of agent behaviour by summing equal and independent reward assessments of instantaneous states and actions, with the aim of RM being to reconstruct the underlying reward function.\nHowever, in reality the human’s experience of a trajectory is likely to be temporally extended (e.g., via a video clip [ref]12 or real-time observation), which opens the door to dependencies between earlier events and the assessment of later ones. The independence assumption may be both psychologically unrealistic given human memory limitations , and technically naïve given the difficulty of building complete instantaneous state representations\n. We thus seek to generalise RM to allow for temporal dependencies in human evaluation, by postulating hidden state information that accumulates over a trajectory. Reconstruction of the human’s preferences now requires the modelling of hidden state dynamics alongside the reward function itself. In tackling this generalised problem, we identify a structural isomorphism between RM\n(specifically from trajectory return labels) and the established field of multiple instance learning (MIL) . Trajectories are recast as bags and constituent state-action pairs as instances, which collectively contribute to labels provided at the bag level by interacting in potentially complex ways. This mapping inspires a range of novel MIL model architectures that use long short-term memory (LSTM) modules  to recover the hidden state dynamics, and learn instance-level reward predictions from return-labelled trajectories of arbitrary length. In experiments with synthetic oracle labels, we show that our MIL RM models can accurately reconstruct ground truth hidden states and reward functions for non-Markovian tasks, and can be straightforwardly integrated into RL agent training to achieve performance matching, or even exceeding, that of agents with direct access to true hidden states and rewards. We then apply interpretability analysis to understand what the models have learnt. Our contributions are as follows: We generalise RM to handle non-Markovian rewards that depend on hidden features of the environment or the psychology of the human evaluator in addition to visible states/actions. We identify a structural connection between RM and MIL, creating the opportunity to transfer concepts and methods between the two fields. We propose novel LSTM-based MIL models for this generalised RM problem, and develop interpretability techniques for understanding and verifying the learnt reward functions. We compare our proposed models to existing MIL baselines on five non-Markovian tasks, evaluating return prediction, reward prediction, robustness to label noise, and interpretability. We demonstrate that the hidden state and reward predictions of our MIL RM models can be used by RL agents to solve non-Markovian tasks. The remainder of this work is as follows. Section 2 discusses related work in RM and MIL, Section 3 gives a formal problem definition and describes our MIL-inspired methodology, and Section 4 presents our experiments and results. We discuss key findings in Section 5, and Section 6 concludes. All of our source code is available in a public repository.111https://github.com/JAEarly/MIL-for-Non-Markovian-Reward-Modelling\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: There is growing consensus around the view that aligned and beneficial AI requires a reframing of objectives as being contingent, uncertain, and learnable via interaction with humans [ref]35.
