WN18  and WN18RR [ref]7 are subsets of WordNet 8, which contains lexical relationships between words. FB15K  and FB15K-237 4 are subsets of Freebase , which contains general facts. WN18 and FB15K are more popular, whereas WN18RR and FB15K-237 are recently built and more competitive. \n\n\n\n\nDataset\n|ℰ|ℰ|{\\mathcal{E}}|\n|ℛ|ℛ|{\\mathcal{R}}|\nTrain\nValid\nTest\n\nWN18\n40,943\n18\n141,442\n5,000\n5,000\n\nFB15K\n14,951\n1,345\n483,142\n50,000\n59,071\n\nWN18RR\n40,943\n11\n86,835\n3,034\n3,134\n\nFB15K-237\n14,541\n237\n272,115\n17,535\n20,466\n\n We evaluate and analyze MEI on the link prediction task . In this task, for each true triple (h,t,r)ℎ𝑡𝑟(h,t,r) in the test set, we replace hℎh and t𝑡t by every other entity to generate corrupted triples (h′,t,r)superscriptℎ′𝑡𝑟(h^{\\prime},t,r) and (h,t′,r)ℎsuperscript𝑡′𝑟(h,t^{\\prime},r), respectively. The goal of the model is to rank the true triple (h,t,r)ℎ𝑡𝑟(h,t,r) before the corrupted triples based on the score 𝒮𝒮{\\mathcal{S}}. We compute popular evaluation metrics including M​R​R𝑀𝑅𝑅MRR (mean reciprocal rank, which is robust to outlier rankings) and H​@​k𝐻@𝑘H@k for k∈{1,3,10}𝑘1310k\\in\\{1,3,10\\} (Hits at k𝑘k, which is how many true triples are correctly ranked in the top k𝑘k) . The higher M​R​R𝑀𝑅𝑅MRR and H​@​k𝐻@𝑘H@k are, the better the model performs. To avoid false-negative error, i.e., some corrupted triples are actually existent, we follow the protocols used in other works for filtered metrics . In this protocol, all existent triples in the training, validation, and test sets are removed from the corrupted triples set before computing the rank of the true triple. To evaluate the prediction on the optimal parameter efficiency, we compare MEI1×200 (vanilla Tucker model) and MEI3×100. The aim is to show that the model with optimal parameter efficiency can achieve better results with even fewer parameters. We also evaluate MEI against several strong baselines including classic models such as TransE, RESCAL, DistMult, and recent state-of-the-art models such as ComplEx, SimplE, and ConvE. We also compare MEI with TorusE that uses larger embedding size; ComplEx at K=400𝐾400K=400 that was retuned with N3 weight decay, reciprocal relation, and full softmax loss; and RotatE without the adversarial sampling technique as this technique is not subjected to a specific model. We trained MEI using mini-batch stochastic gradient descent with Adam optimizer . We followed the 1-N scoring procedure in [ref]7 for negative sampling of (h,t,r)ℎ𝑡𝑟(h,t,r), where negative samples are reused multiple times for computation efficiency and the number of negative samples is different for each triple. The results of MEI1×200 are reproduced from the vanilla Tucker model in ; note that the relation embedding size Dr=30subscript𝐷𝑟30D_{r}=30 on WN18 and WN18RR only. All hyperparameters of MEI3×100 are tuned by random search , including batch size, learning rate, decay rate, batch normalization, and dropout rates, which we will publish together with the code. Note that in these experiments, we restrict them to the simplified case of one single shared-core tensor for all K𝐾K partitions, as an analogy to single interaction patterns in previous specially designed models.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: We use four popular benchmark datasets for link prediction, as shown in Table 1.
