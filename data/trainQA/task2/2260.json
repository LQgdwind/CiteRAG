      "content": "Paper Title: Planar and Toroidal Morphs Made Easier\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUntil recently, very little was known about morphing graphs on the torus or other more complex surfaces. Tutte’s spring-embedding theorem was generalized to simple triangulations of surfaces with non-positive curvature by Colin de Verdière  and independently by Hass and Scott . Delgado-Friedrichs [ref]22, Lovász , and Gortler et al.  also independently proved an extension of Tutte’s theorem to graphs on the flat torus whose universal covers are simple and 3-connected.\nFor any toroidal graph and any assignment of positive symmetric weights to the darts, solving a linear system similar to (1) yields vertex positions of a geodesic drawing with strictly convex faces  ; see Section 2 for details.\nThus, if two isotopic geodesic torus graphs Γ0subscriptΓ0\\Gamma_{0} and Γ1subscriptΓ1\\Gamma_{1} can both be described by symmetric dart weights, linearly interpolating those weights yields a morph from Γ0subscriptΓ0\\Gamma_{0} to Γ1subscriptΓ1\\Gamma_{1} ; in light of the authors’ toroidal Maxwell–Cremona correspondence , this can be seen as a natural toroidal analogue of Steinitz’s theorem on morphing convex polyhedra . The restriction to symmetric weights is both nontrivial and significant. In a torus graph with convex faces, every vertex can be described as a convex combination of its neighbors, but not necessarily with symmetric weights. Moreover, the linear system expressing vertex positions as convex combinations of its neighbors is\nrank-deficient, and therefore is\nnot solvable in general; see Appendix A for an example. Thus, Floater’s asymmetric extension of Tutte’s theorem does not directly generalize to the flat torus. For similar reasons, Floater and Gotsman’s planar morphing algorithm also does not generalize. Suppose we are given two isotopic geodesic torus graphs Γ0subscriptΓ0\\Gamma_{0} and Γ1subscriptΓ1\\Gamma_{1}, each with dart weights\nthat express their vertices as convex combinations of their neighbors. Unfortunately, in general, interpolating those weights yields linear systems that have no solution; we give a simple example in Appendix A. Steiner and Fischer  modify the system by fixing a single vertex, restoring full rank. However, solving the modified system does not necessarily yield a crossing-free drawing, because the fixed vertex may not lie in the convex hull of its neighbors.333Steiner and Fischer incorrectly claim [48, Section 2.2.1] that the resulting drawing has no “foldovers” except at the fixed vertex and its neighbors; see Appendix A.\nMoreover, even though the initial and final weights are consistent with crossing-free drawings, averages of those weights may not be. We give an example of this bad behavior in Appendix A. Chambers, Erickson, Lin, and Parsa  described the first algorithm to morph between arbitrary essentially 3-connected geodesic torus graphs. Their algorithm uses a combination of Cairns’ edge-collapsing strategy and spring embeddings to construct a morph consisting of O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) unidirectional morphing steps, in O​(n1+ω/2)𝑂superscript𝑛1𝜔2O(n^{1+\\omega/2}) time. Like planar morphs built from edge collapses, these toroidal morphs contract vertices into small neighborhoods and thus are not suitable for visualization. Recently, Luo et al.  generalized Floater’s theorem to geodesic triangulations of arbitrary closed Riemannian 2-manifolds with strictly negative curvature, extending the spring-embedding theorems of Colin de Verdière  and Hass and Scott  to asymmetric weights. Their result immediately implies that if two geodesic triangulations of such a surface are homotopic, then linearly interpolating the dart weights yields a continuous family of crossing-free geodesic drawings, or in other words, a morph.\nTheir result applies only to surfaces with negative Euler characteristic; alas,\nthe torus has Euler characteristic 00.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: Tutte’s spring-embedding theorem was generalized to simple triangulations of surfaces with non-positive curvature by Colin de Verdière  and independently by Hass and Scott .
