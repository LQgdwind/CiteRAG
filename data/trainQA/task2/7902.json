      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to Transfer for Evolutionary Multitasking\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe first briefly revisit some KT operators that are related to our design of the action space for the KT process. Some representative KT operators include linear combination-based crossover [ref]9, base vector transfer , and differential vector transfer . The linear combination-based crossover including arithmetic crossover [ref]9 and simulated binary crossover (SBX)  is to perform interpolation on the target and source solutions to generate offspring vk,isubscript𝑣𝑘𝑖v_{k,i} as where j≠k𝑗𝑘j\\neq k is a randomly selected source task index from {1,…,K}1…𝐾\\{1,...,K\\} and λ∈ 𝜆01\\lambda\\in  is a random variable that is drawn from a predefined distribution. The base vector transfer is while the differential vector transfer is Moreover, the direct transfer 0 that uses the sampled solution from the source population is a well-known KT operator as It is widely studied that different KT operators have different transfer biases and favor different kinds of task similarity and evolution states 5. This inspires us to make use of the complementarity of different KT operators and devise a more generalized KT action representation that can adapt to diverse evolution states and task similarities. Hence, combining the KT probabilistic model in Eq. (4) and existing KT operators, we derive the sampling model for an offspring vk,isubscript𝑣𝑘𝑖v_{k,i} at generation g𝑔g as and vk∼p​(vk|𝒦​({Xj}j=1K))similar-tosubscript𝑣𝑘𝑝conditionalsubscript𝑣𝑘𝒦superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑋𝑗𝑗1𝐾v_{k}\\sim p(v_{k}|\\mathcal{K}(\\{X_{j}\\}_{j=1}^{K})) is defined as where r1,r2,r3,r4,r5,r6subscript𝑟1subscript𝑟2subscript𝑟3subscript𝑟4subscript𝑟5subscript𝑟6r_{1},r_{2},r_{3},r_{4},r_{5},r_{6} are randomly drawn from {1,…,N}1…𝑁\\{1,...,N\\}. ak,1,ak,2,ak,3∈ subscript𝑎𝑘1subscript𝑎𝑘2subscript𝑎𝑘301a_{k,1},a_{k,2},a_{k,3}\\in  are three continuous action parameters output by an agent for task fksubscript𝑓𝑘f_{k} and can be varied among generations. After generating a trial vector vk,isubscript𝑣𝑘𝑖v_{k,i}, the binomial crossover operation is put forward to produce the final offspring uk,isubscript𝑢𝑘𝑖u_{k,i}. According to the analysis in 4, we impose the restriction on the probability of self evolution by base solver 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} to be larger than 0.5 under truncated selection mechanism, i.e., αk=1−0.5⋅ak,1≥0.5subscript𝛼𝑘1⋅0.5subscript𝑎𝑘10.5\\alpha_{k}=1-0.5\\cdot a_{k,1}\\geq 0.5, to guarantee convergence. The main feature of this action formulation is that by setting different ak,i,ak,2,ak,3subscript𝑎𝑘𝑖subscript𝑎𝑘2subscript𝑎𝑘3a_{k,i},a_{k,2},a_{k,3}, the mutation operator in Eq. (1) and existing KT operators Eq. (5)-(8) can be recovered from Eq. (10). That is, the above-mentioned self evolution operator and KT operators are a subset of the proposed action space. The detailed interpretation of different KT actions is shown in Table I. Note that since actions ak,1,ak,2,ak,3subscript𝑎𝑘1subscript𝑎𝑘2subscript𝑎𝑘3a_{k,1},a_{k,2},a_{k,3} are continuous, setting action values within (0,1)01(0,1) refers to the combination of multiple KT operators. Intuitively, we expect that more candidate actions of linearly combining KT operators can provide more diverse behaviors and potentially improve the capacity of the KT process to adapt to more diverse MTOPs.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: We first briefly revisit some KT operators that are related to our design of the action space for the KT process.
