In recent years, a growing body of research has focused on developing XAI techniques tailored explicitly for time series data .\nThese techniques often rely on the concept of attributions, which aim to identify the contributions of individual features and time points to the overall prediction made by a model .\nBy providing insights into which parts of the input data are most relevant to the output, attributions can help users understand the reasoning behind the model’s decision-making process .\nHowever, the evaluation of such attributions is not trivial [ref]19.\nTo address the challenge of evaluating the quality of explanations for time series data, perturbation analysis has emerged as a promising evaluation technique [ref]17 .\nPerturbation analysis involves systematically modifying the input data and assessing the impact on the attributions generated by XAI methods [ref]19.\nBy perturbing the input data, it is possible to evaluate the robustness of the explanations provided by XAI methods .\nHowever, the effectiveness of perturbation analysis for evaluating the quality of attributions for time series data has not been extensively studied [ref]19. In this paper, we apply attribution techniques from various fields to a convolution neural network trained on time series classification data to evaluate and inspect the generated attributions in detail using perturbations, which involves systematically altering the input data and observing the effect on the model’s output.\nWe investigate the performance of attribution techniques compared to each other based on the perturbation analysis result and explore the perturbation changes based on these attributions to gain insights into the model.\nThrough such an analysis, we can identify spurious correlations and shortcuts in the complex models and thus enable developers to potentially improve models by debugging datasets.\nWe show that our convolution neural network trained on time series classification learned certain shortcuts to achieve state-of-the-art performances.\nBased on these experiments and results, we provide guidelines for the application of attribution techniques for time series classification and release our evaluation framework to investigate other attribution techniques. Thus, we contribute:\n(1)  an in-depth analysis of attribution techniques on time series classification for deep learning models using a perturbation analysis,\n(2)  insights into convolution neural networks trained on time series based on the generated attributions,\n(3)  guidelines and a framework for applying attribution techniques for time series models with a perturbation analysis card for reporting.\nWe first look into related work, and then we introduce the perturbation analysis methodology and the experiment setup we use for our deep dive.\nHere we also propose perturbation analysis cards as a guideline to report the results of an evaluation.\nNext, we present our results and discuss the impact of our conclusions for attribution techniques applied to time series.\nLastly, in future work, we motivate new measures for the evaluation of attributions on time series data. Results and source code of the experiments is online available at:\nhttps://github.com/visual-xai-for-time-series/time-series-xai-perturbation-analysis\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: of users and customers using deep neural networks.\nHowever, as the complexity of deep neural network models increases, so does the difficulty in understanding how they get to their decisions [ref]7.\nA lack of interpretability can lead to severe consequences in critical domains such as finance, healthcare, and transportation, including financial losses, medical errors, and even loss of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
