      "content": "Paper Title: Few-Shot Semantic Relation Prediction across Heterogeneous Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA heterogeneous graph (HG) consists of multiple types of objects (nodes) and multiple types of links (edges). Consider the heterogeneous graph in Fig. 1 depicting a toy social network, where the objects are associated with different types (as shown in parenthesis), such as John has a type “user” and Music has a type “hobby”. These objects interact with each other via multiple typed links, such as John “works” at Abc Corp., and Mary “studies” at Southern Sydney School. In a heterogeneous graph, a variety of semantic relations exist and can be mined ,, which come from the combinations of various semantic meanings behind the graph structures. For example, in Fig. 1, the semantic relation classmate between Mary and Bob can be mined based on the fact that they both study Physics at the same school (i.e., Southern Sydney School). In addition, John and Lisa may be friends because they both work at the same company, Abc Corp., share a hobby, Music and have a mutual friend, Mary. Essentially, given an HG and two query objects, semantic relation prediction aims to explore the specific semantic relations (e.g., classmate or friend) between the two given objects . Studies of semantic relation prediction empower many applications. For instance, categorizing friends in social networks  , discovering advisors/advisees in bibliography networks , and linking customers in e-commerce networks based on their interests . In recent years, some newly emerged public events have urged a new demand for learning new semantic relations with few labeled data. For instance, when COVID is diagnosed with a few patients, the ability to accurately forecast people who are likely to be infected by these COVID patients, is extremely important to assist policymakers in rapidly controlling outbreaks. In this case, although the new semantic relation between COVID patients and susceptible people has never been learned before, researchers can mine the knowledge from similar well-studied pandemics, e.g., learn transmission rules and patterns between patients of these pandemics, to help predict people who are at high risk of being infected, with the support of a few diagnosed samples. The above discussion leads to a novel and challenging problem of how to transfer knowledge from existing semantic relations, to predict new semantic relations with only few observed data, namely, few-shot semantic relation prediction. In general, the studies of few-shot semantic relation prediction focus on exploiting transferable knowledge from semantic relations with a large amount of labeled data, to help learn other semantic relations with few labeled data. Therefore, such studies may also be utilised to tackle the cold-start problem and the imbalanced distribution of some particular semantic relations. In the context of this paper, we use the term “existing semantic relations” to refer to the semantic relations for which sufficient labeled data exists and can be used to learn the knowledge of these semantic relations (e.g., characteristics, formation rules or patterns of semantic relations), and use the term “new semantic relations” to refer to other semantic relations that cannot be well learned because of limited labeled data. We aim to obtain the new knowledge of these few labeled semantic relations with the support of existing semantic relations. In real-world systems, to predict new semantic relations with few labeled data, the transferable knowledge across existing semantic relations can be mined from different scenarios as follows: Scenario 1. Single HG: In this scenario, the new semantic relations to be predicted and the existing semantic relations all come from the same graph. For instance, in Fig. 2A, to predict whether “user” A and “user” B have a new semantic relation friend, the existing semantic relations can be used to analyse the graph structure between the two users, namely, the two users have a close relationship because they are known to be schoolmates and teammates. Hence, the two users are quite likely to be friends. Scenario 2. Multiple HGs & single heterogeneity: In this scenario, existing and new semantic relations come from different graphs that share a fixed heterogeneity (i.e., a fixed set of object/link types), implying that these graphs contain different objects/links but share a common set of object/link types. For instance, in Fig. 2B, the existing semantic relations schoolmate and friend come from G1subscriptG1\\emph{G}_{\\emph{1}} and GnsubscriptGn\\emph{G}_{\\emph{n}}, respectively. The new semantic relation school friend comes from another graph Gn+1subscriptGn+1\\emph{G}_{\\emph{n+1}} that consists of different objects, which, however, has the same object types with G1subscriptG1\\emph{G}_{\\emph{1}} and GnsubscriptGn\\emph{G}_{\\emph{n}}, such as “user”, “school” and “club”. Knowledge about these common object types’ interactions can be mined from semantic relations in existing graphs (i.e., G1subscriptG1\\emph{G}_{\\emph{1}}-GnsubscriptGn\\emph{G}_{\\emph{n}}), to predict the new semantic relation in Gn+1subscriptGn+1\\emph{G}_{\\emph{n+1}}. For example, similarly to “user” C and “user” D in G1subscriptG1\\emph{G}_{\\emph{1}}, “user” H and “user” I attend the same school, and thus should be schoolmates. Besides, “user” H and “user” I should be friends because they join the same club and have a mutual friend, which is similar to the relationship between “user” E and “user” F in GnsubscriptGn\\emph{G}_{\\emph{n}}. Therefore, “user” H and “user” I may be school friends. Scenario 3. Multiple HGs & multiple heterogeneities: In this scenario, the existing and new semantic relations come from different graphs with different heterogeneities. For instance, in Fig. 2C, colleague comes from G1subscriptG1\\emph{G}_{\\emph{1}} that contains the objects of “employee” and “company”, and coauthor comes from GnsubscriptGn\\emph{G}_{\\emph{n}} that contains the objects of “author” and “paper”. Although the two graphs contain different object types, the latent collaboration relationship can be extracted from both colleague and coauthor, namely, employees collaborate with each other to improve company performance, authors collaborate with each other to complete the paper. Knowledge of such collaboration relationship can be transferred to learn the new semantic relation project partner in Gn+1subscriptGn+1\\emph{G}_{\\emph{n+1}}, which exists between two “worker” objects that work for one “project”, even though these object types are not included in either of G1subscriptG1\\emph{G}_{\\emph{1}} and GnsubscriptGn\\emph{G}_{\\emph{n}}. Based on the above discussions, we can see that Scenario 1 (Single HG) and Scenario 2 (Multiple HGs & single heterogeneity) can be considered as two special cases of Scenario 3 (Multiple HGs & multiple heterogeneities). This is because when all objects of existing and new semantic relations come from a single graph, Scenario 3 is the same as Scenario 1; and when all graphs of existing and new semantic relations share a common set of object/link types, i.e., all graphs have a fixed heterogeneity, Scenario 3 is the same as Scenario 2. In this work, we particularly focus on the most challenging Scenario 3, i.e., Multiple HGs & multiple heterogeneities, aiming at learning transferable knowledge across semantic relations in existing graphs, to help predict new semantic relations in different graphs, with different heterogeneities and few labeled data, which is termed as the problem of few-shot semantic relation prediction across heterogeneous graphs. We propose a novel general framework that not only solves the challenging problem, but also works for all three scenarios discussed above. We adopt an intuitive and general idea to deal with the above-mentioned three scenarios. Specifically, we can first (1) generalize the knowledge across existing semantic relations, then (2) transfer the generalized knowledge to adapt to new semantic relations, and finally (3) discover new semantic relations with the transferred knowledge and few labeled data. However, when targeting the aforementioned novel problem of few-shot semantic relation prediction across HGs, the generalize and transfer steps become more challenging because we need to deal with various semantic relations that come from different graphs with different heterogeneities. Based on the above discussion and proposed three steps, accordingly, we need to tackle the following three challenges of few-shot semantic relation prediction across HGs: CH1. How to generalize the knowledge across existing semantic relations from multiple HGs with multiple heterogeneities? Since the existing and new semantic relations come from graphs with different heterogeneities, each graph has its own feature space of objects/links, and the information of each semantic relation should be uniformed so that common knowledge can be extracted across existing semantic relations. However, the existing methods focus on a particular semantic relation in a particular HG  [ref]9, and thus cannot extract transferable knowledge across various semantic relations. CH2. How to design an efficient learning procedure to transfer knowledge from existing semantic relations to adapt to new semantic relations with few labeled data? In the literature, some methods focus on transferring knowledge for graph problems with few labeled data, e.g., few-shot node classification 0 and few-shot link prediction 1. These methods are two-fold. On the one hand, most of these methods focus on homogeneous graphs with a single type of objects and a single type of links 2 3, and thus cannot be applied to heterogeneous graphs with various object/link types. On the other hand, some methods target heterogeneous graphs 4 and knowledge graphs (KGs) 5. However, they focus on a particular HG/KG only, and thus cannot transfer knowledge across multiple HGs for semantic relation prediction. Therefore, it is an open challenge to design a novel framework that can transfer knowledge of semantic relations across multiple HGs. CH3. How to discover effective semantic relation representations of new semantic relations from few labeled data? To accurately predict new semantic relations with few labeled data, effectively learning and aggregating information from these few labeled samples is required. Specifically, for each labeled pair of objects, the information of the graph structure between the two objects, as well as the information of neighbor objects/links that connect the two objects, should be captured. In the literature, some existing methods leverage sequential models to learn paths connecting labeled objects for semantic relation embedding  [ref]9, which neglects capturing the information of the graph structure between objects. Others utilize some specifically designed patterns (e.g., “user-company-user” for colleague) to match the graph structure between objects for semantic relation prediction ,. However, designing appropriate patterns requires sufficient labeled data and expertise. Therefore, with limited labeled data, it is required to develop a model that can not only capture the information of the graph structure between a pair of objects, but also learn the information of neighbor objects/links that connect the two objects. To address the above three challenges, we propose a novel Meta-learning based Graph neural network for Semantic relation prediction, named MetaGS. Firstly, to address challenge CH1, MetaGS decomposes the graph structure between labeled objects into multiple normalized subgraphs, and then adopts a common graph neural network (GNN) to learn these subgraphs and obtain the generalized knowledge. Secondly, to address challenge CH2, MetaGS designs a novel hyper-prototypical network module to transfer knowledge across existing semantic relations, and obtain a well-initialized model that can be adapted to new semantic relations with limited data. Specifically, the hyper-prototypical network module first uses data of existing semantic relations to learn how to specify important subgraphs and aggregate information from these subgraphs, and then transfers the learned knowledge to new semantic relations. Thirdly, to address challenge CH3, MetaGS first develops a novel two-view GNN module that effectively models the information of neighbor objects/links and the graph structure of subgraphs, then adopts the well-initialized hyper-prototypical network to specify important subgraphs, and finally aggregates the information of important subgraphs to obtain the semantic relation representation for prediction. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first one to propose the novel problem of few-shot semantic relation prediction and provide a general framework that works for three scenarios of the novel problem. The main contributions of this work are summarized as follows: We propose a novel model MetaGS to generally learn transferable knowledge across semantic relations from existing heterogeneous graphs and adapt to predicting new semantic relations in different heterogeneous graphs, with different heterogeneities and few labeled data; We propose a novel two-view graph neural network module to capture information of neighbor objects/links and graph structures across multiple heterogeneous graphs, and propose a novel hyper-prototypical network module to generalize transferable knowledge for learning new semantic relations; We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The experimental results illustrate the superiority of the proposed model over the state-of-the-art models in terms of evaluation metrics from three perspectives.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: relation should be uniformed so that common knowledge can be extracted across existing semantic relations.
