      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Computational Cost of Bayesian Optimization for Controller Tuning with a Multi-stage Tuning Framework\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe are interested in automated controller tuning methods (or control auto-tuning methods) framed as an optimization problem. Within this framework, we can group existing auto-tuning approaches within two groups : gradient-based and derivative free optimization (DFO) methods. First-order (also referred to as gradient-based) optimization methods have been commonly used in control tuning . These methods rely on knowing the gradients of the performance objectives with respect to the control parameters, which can be achieved with previous knowledge of the system model  (model-based approaches) or using some form of gradient estimation 8 (model-free approaches). Information on the gradients is then used to guide the search for the optimal control parameters. Reinforcement-learning (RL) is a well-known gradient-based learning algorithm that has seen use in control auto-tuning. Authors in 1 propose an actor-critic RL solution where the actor is a PID controller function that is tuned following a constrained RL tuning algorithm. In  multiple SISO PIDs are tuned simultaneously for a MIMO system using a single RL policy tuned with the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. A meta-reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed in  to adaptively tune PI controllers when the underlying system dynamics change or are not contained in the training distribution. Overall, gradient-based approaches are limited by the amount of knowledge available about the system, or the accuracy of the gradient estimates 9. Furthermore, they are not easily extended to consider optimization constraints . Derivative-free optimization methods (DFO) have become increasingly popular since they make little-to-no assumptions on the objective or constraint functions. Examples of DFO control tuning methods are Bayesian Optimization [ref]5, DiffTune 9 and evolutionary optimization 0. Meta-heuristics-based control tuning algorithms are a well known example of DFO methods for control tuning; authors in  provide a survey on multi-objective optimization (MOO) using meta-heuristics, while  survey the particular case of PID controller tuning with meta-heuristics. These approaches include the use of grey wolf optimization 1 for PID controller tuning, non-dominated sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) for multi-objective tuning of aerial manipulators 2, particle swarm optimization for PID tuning of MIMO processes 0, and chaotic atom search for tuning of fractional order PID controllers for DC motor speed control 3. As an alternative to meta-heuristics-based methods, Bayesian Optimization is a class of machine learning solutions designed for noisy optimization problems with expensive objective evaluations  that has become very popular for controller tuning in recent works 45. The main appeal in BO comes from its sample efficiency, shown by [ref]5 to outperform a range of state-of-the-art DFO approaches for control auto-tuning, including several evolutionary algorithms. Authors in  present a joint tuning methodology which uses Bayesian Optimization to simultaneously tune an LQR controller, an unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), and a guidance and navigation system for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), yielding satisfactory results across multiple objectives. They address the issue of over-fitting by tuning on a variety of different scenarios, which significantly increases the computational cost of evaluating the objective functions. Furthermore, the combination of multiple objectives (and potential cost parameter tuning) is not explicitly defined for the proposed joint approach. An earlier version of this paper is presented by  where only the Kalman filters are tuned for the AUV using Bayesian Optimization. In their work, [ref]5, 6 and  propose a BO-based tuning methodology for learning with crash constraints (LCC) using virtual data-points. These works show BO to be very sample efficient for control tuning tasks (particularly when learning with crash constraints) in comparison to other state-of-the-arts auto-tuning optimizers. A general disadvantage of DFO methods is the fact that they do not scale effectively with the increase in the dimension of the parameter space . Furthermore, some of these methods converge very slowly compared to their gradient-based counterparts .\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: methods (DFO) have become increasingly popular since they make little-to-no assumptions on the objective or constraint functions.
