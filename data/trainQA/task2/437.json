      "content": "Paper Title: Fair Classification via Unconstrained Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMachine learning applications are being increasingly adopted to make life-critical decisions with an ever-lasting impact on individual lives, such as for credit lending , medical applications , and criminal justice . Consequently, it is imperative to ensure that such automated decision-making systems abstain from ethical malpractice, including “bias.\" Unfortunately, despite the fact that bias (or “fairness\") is a central concept in our society today, it is difficult to define it in precise terms. In fact, because people perceive ethical matters differently depending on their geographical location and culture [ref]4, no universally-agreeable definition for bias exists! Moreover, even within the same cultural group, bias may be defined differently according to the application at hand and might even be ignored in favor of accuracy by some members of the group when the stakes are high, such as for medical diagnosis  . As such, it is not surprising to note that several definitions for “unbiased classifiers\" have been introduced in the literature. These include statistical parity [ref]7 , equality of opportunity , and equalized odds . Unfortunately, such definitions are not generally mutually compatible 0  and some might even be in conflict with calibration . In addition, because fairness is a societal concept, it does not necessarily translate into a statistical criteria 0 1. In order to contrast the previous definitions of bias in the literature, let 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} be an instance space and let 𝒴={0,1}𝒴01\\mathcal{Y}=\\{0,1\\} be the target set in a standard binary classification problem. In the fair classification setting, we may further assume the existence of a (possibly randomized) sensitive attribute 1S:𝒳→{0,1}:subscript1𝑆→𝒳011_{S}:\\mathcal{X}\\to\\{0,1\\}, where 1S​(x)subscript1𝑆𝑥1_{S}(x) indicates if an instance x∈𝒳𝑥𝒳x\\in\\mathcal{X} belongs to some sensitive class S⊆𝒳𝑆𝒳S\\subseteq\\mathcal{X}. For example, 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} might correspond to the set of job applicants while S𝑆S are the female applicants. Then, a general theme among many popular definitions of bias is to fix a partitioning of the instance space 𝒳=∪kXk𝒳subscript𝑘subscript𝑋𝑘\\mathcal{X}=\\cup_{k}X_{k} where Xk1∩Xk2=∅subscript𝑋subscript𝑘1subscript𝑋subscript𝑘2X_{k_{1}}\\cap X_{k_{2}}=\\emptyset for k1≠k2subscript𝑘1subscript𝑘2k_{1}\\neq k_{2} and require a balanced representation of the sensitive class within some or all of the subsets Xksubscript𝑋𝑘X_{k}. Throughout this paper, we refer to the subsets Xk⊆𝒳subscript𝑋𝑘𝒳X_{k}\\subseteq\\mathcal{X} as “groups.\" This brings us to the first definition: A classifier f:𝒳→{0,1}:𝑓→𝒳01f:\\mathcal{X}\\to\\{0,1\\} is said to be conditionally unbiased in some group Xk⊆𝒳subscript𝑋𝑘𝒳X_{k}\\subseteq\\mathcal{X} with respect to a sensitive class S𝑆S if C​(f​(x), 1S​(x);x∈Xk)=0𝐶𝑓xsubscript1𝑆xxsubscript𝑋𝑘0C\\big{(}f(\\textbf{{x}}),\\,1_{S}(\\textbf{x});\\;\\textbf{x}\\in X_{k}\\big{)}=0, where for any binary random variables a, b∈{0,1}a, b01\\textbf{a, b}\\in\\{0,1\\}, C​(a,b)≐𝔼​[a⋅b]−𝔼​[a]⋅𝔼​[b]approaches-limit𝐶ab𝔼delimited-[]⋅ab⋅𝔼delimited-[]a𝔼delimited-[]bC(\\textbf{a},\\textbf{b})\\doteq\\mathbb{E}[\\textbf{a}\\cdot\\textbf{b}]-\\mathbb{E}[\\textbf{a}]\\cdot\\mathbb{E}[\\textbf{b}] is their covariance, and C​(a,b;c)𝐶abcC(\\textbf{a},\\textbf{b};\\,\\textbf{c}) is their covariance conditioned on c∈{0,1}c01\\textbf{c}\\in\\{0,1\\}: A classifier f𝑓f is said to be unbiased with respect to S𝑆S across all groups {Xk}k=1,2,…,Ksubscriptsubscript𝑋𝑘𝑘12…𝐾\\{X_{k}\\}_{k=1,2,\\ldots,K} if it is conditionally unbiased with respect to S𝑆S in each Xksubscript𝑋𝑘X_{k} separately. We note that statistical parity corresponds to bias in the group 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}, equality of opportunity corresponds to bias in the group X={x∈𝒳:y​(x)=1}𝑋conditional-set𝑥𝒳𝑦𝑥1X=\\{x\\in\\mathcal{X}:\\,y(x)=1\\}, while equalized odds corresponds to bias in both groups X𝑋X and 𝒳∖X𝒳𝑋\\mathcal{X}\\setminus X simultaneously, where X𝑋X is as defined previously. Obviously, countless other possibilities exist depending on the choices of Xksubscript𝑋𝑘X_{k}. Often, machine learning algorithms are required to treat multiple groups equally. For example, the US Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974 2 prohibits any discrimination based on gender, race, color, religion, national origin, marital status, or age. In such case, Xksubscript𝑋𝑘X_{k} would correspond to a combination of multiple attributes, such as “black Muslim females.\" This brings us to the second definition: A classifier f:𝒳→{0,1}:𝑓→𝒳01f:\\mathcal{X}\\to\\{0,1\\} is said to satisfy predictive equality across all groups 𝒢={X1,…,Xk}𝒢subscript𝑋1…subscript𝑋𝑘\\mathcal{G}=\\{X_{1},\\ldots,X_{k}\\} if for all Xk∈𝒢subscript𝑋𝑘𝒢X_{k}\\in\\mathcal{G}, one has C​(f​(x), 1Xk​(x))=0𝐶𝑓xsubscript1subscript𝑋𝑘x0C\\big{(}f(\\textbf{{x}}),\\,1_{X_{k}}(\\textbf{x})\\big{)}=0. Both Definitions 1 and 2 are standard in the literature (see for instance 3 and the notion of “sub-group fairness\" in 4). The difference between both definitions is that the probability of having f​(x)=1𝑓𝑥1f(x)=1 can vary in Definition 1 from one group to another as long as the sensitive class S𝑆S is well-represented within each group, respectively. In Definition 2, the probability that f​(x)=1𝑓𝑥1f(x)=1 is required to be the same across all groups without designating a sensitive class S𝑆S. Let Xksubscript𝑋𝑘X_{k} be the set of job applicants with country of origin k𝑘k and S𝑆S be the class of females. Definition 1 is satisfied by an employer if for any country of origin k𝑘k, the probability of hiring a female candidate equals the probability of hiring a male candidate conditioned on both being in Xksubscript𝑋𝑘X_{k}, even when some countries of origin are more preferred than others (such as citizens). Definition 2 is satisfied if the probability of hiring a job applicant is independent of the country of origin. Under certain assumptions, it has been shown that the optimal binary classification rule subject to certain fairness constraints reduces to a group-wise thresholding rules over the Bayes regressor η​(x)=p​(y=1|x=x)𝜂𝑥𝑝yconditional1x𝑥\\eta(x)=p(\\textbf{y}=1|\\textbf{x}=x). This happens, for example, when maximizing a social utility score that includes the cost of predicting the positive class (e.g. detaining individuals) and the positive regressor has a positive density in the unit interval 3. In this paper, we extend this result by proving that, in a broader setting with relaxed assumptions, the Bayes optimal fair learning rule that minimizes the 0-1 misclassification loss remains a group-wise thresholding rule over the Bayes regressor but with a (possible) randomization at the thresholds. Since this holds in a broader setting than previously considered, it provides a stronger justification to the post-processing approach in fair classification, in which (1) a predictor is learned first, after which (2) its output is adjusted to remove bias. In addition, we show how the post-processing rule in this two-stage approach can be learned quite efficiently by, first, formulating it as an unconstrained optimization problem, and, then, solving it using the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method. We argue that this approach has many distinct advantages. First, stochastic convex optimization methods are well-understood and can scale well to massive amounts of data 5. In particular, the unconstrained loss being minimized in the proposed algorithm, which can be interpreted as a smooth approximation to the rectified linear unit (ReLU) 6, has many nice properties, such as Lipschitz continuity and differentiability, which imply fast convergence. Second, the guarantees provided by our algorithm hold w.r.t. the binary predictions instead of using a proxy, such as the margin as in some previous works 7 8. Third, we prove that our algorithm is Bayes consistent if the original pre-processed classifier is itself Bayes consistent.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: central concept in our society today, it is difficult to define it in precise terms.
