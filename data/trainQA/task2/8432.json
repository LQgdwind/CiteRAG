      "content": "Paper Title: FedDW: Distilling Weights through Consistency Optimization in Heterogeneous Federated Learning *Corresponding Author\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFederated Learning (FL) [ref]1,[ref]2, has gained significant attention as a privacy-preserving machine learning (ML) paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively train models without sharing their raw data. Traditional FL frameworks, such as FedAvg [ref]4, assume homogeneous data distribution and similar computational capabilities across clients. However, in real-world scenarios, data heterogeneity and varying computational resources among clients are inevitable, posing significant challenges to the efficiency and effectiveness of FL systems. Data heterogeneity ,, often referred to as non-IID (Non-Independent and Identically Distributed) data, can degrade the performance of federated models and increase the divergence of local updates from different clients . Because of the singularity of data distribution, each client has a different emphasis on data distribution. Therefore, while each client has the same objective function and model structure, the value of the optimal solution is often different. Just like in the long-tail problem of data , , if a certain class of data accounts for a large proportion of the data set, the model tends to be more inclined toward this class of data rather than learning a reasonable model weight. The main method to solve heterogeneous federated learning is information sharing between clients. One client must know the data information of other clients (i.e. global information) to train a model with global generalization, but this process will violate confidentiality agreements. To resolve this conflict, we introduce deep learning encrypted data (DLE data), which is defined in detail as follows. The data ee is generated during the neural network training process and encapsulates the characteristics of the training dataset. However, under current technological conditions, it cannot be effectively decoded to reconstruct the actual data or derive specific statistical results from the dataset. So far, there are three common types of DLE data, as shown in Figure 1. One is the data feature vector , , , . It uses a local neural network as a feature extractor to map high-dimensional image or text data into a low-dimensional feature space and use it as the feature vector of the image. The process of mapping high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional feature vector is irreversible. It not only retains the core features of the data, but also reduces the transmission cost during sharing. This is the most common DLE data. The second is soft labels ,,. This type of data applies knowledge distillation  techniques to FL. This type of DLE data is more concerned with the relationship between different categories of data rather than the data itself. The third is the neural network model , . After the neural network model is trained on a dataset, the parameters inside the model will reflect some of the characteristics and information of the dataset. The client shares it with other clients and, due to the black box characteristics and unexplainability of the neural network itself, it can become an excellent encryption method. The disadvantage of deep learning unexplainability turns into an advantage for encryption. Here, we propose a consistency optimization paradigm to address the heterogeneity issue using DLE data. The detailed definition is as follows. Under IID data distribution, find two types of DLE data: e1e_{1} and e2e_{2} with consistent relationship. For the nn-th client, it involves optimizing the consistency objective: ‖Ψ​(e1g)−ψ​(e2n)‖,\\left\\|\\Psi(e_{1}^{g})-\\psi(e_{2}^{n})\\right\\|,\nwhere e1g=A​g​g​(e11,e12,…,e1N)e_{1}^{g}=Agg(e_{1}^{1},e_{1}^{2},\\dots,e_{1}^{N}). Here, Ψ\\Psi and ψ\\psi denote the Mapping Functions, and A​g​g​(⋅)Agg(\\cdot) represents the aggregation operation performed on the server. The entire DLE consistency optimization process is shown in Figure 2. This paper identifies the consistency relationship between soft labels and classification layer parameters and, based on this foundation, proposes FedDW. FedDW regularizes the parameters of the local model’s classification layer using these global soft labels, ensuring that under non-IID data distributions, client models retain the parameter distribution characteristics of IID environments. In summary, the main contributions of the paper are the following: This paper first proposes and defines the concept of DLE data, providing three common examples of DLE data. This paper presents the discovery of a consistency relationship between soft labels and the classification layer parameter matrix multiplied by their own transpose, further verified through experiments. The paper proposes a concise and novel FedDW framework, proving both experimentally and theoretically that FedDW has better performance and training efficiency.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Federated Learning (FL) [ref]1,[ref]2, has gained significant attention as a privacy-preserving machine learning (ML) paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively train models without sharing their raw data.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
