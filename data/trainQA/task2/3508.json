      "content": "Paper Title: Discrete approximation of the Griffith functional by adaptive finite elements\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs usual in ΓΓ\\Gamma-convergence, the proof is achieved by combining a compactness result, a lower bound and an upper bound inequality. In order to describe our argument, let us assume for simplicity that f​(t)=t∧κ𝑓𝑡𝑡𝜅f(t)=t\\wedge\\kappa and 𝐀=id𝐀id\\mathbf{A}={\\rm id}. Our compactness result, Proposition 4.5 rests on the general G​S​B​D𝐺𝑆𝐵𝐷GSBD compactness result of . Given a sequence {uε}ε>0subscriptsubscript𝑢𝜀𝜀0\\{u_{\\varepsilon}\\}_{\\varepsilon>0} with uniformly bounded energy, one can apply [21, Theorem 1.1] to the modified function vε:=uε​𝟙{|e​(uε)|2≤κ/ε}assignsubscript𝑣𝜀subscript𝑢𝜀subscript1superscript𝑒subscript𝑢𝜀2𝜅𝜀v_{\\varepsilon}:=u_{\\varepsilon}\\mathds{1}_{\\{|e(u_{\\varepsilon})|^{2}\\leq\\kappa/\\varepsilon\\}} which consists in putting the value zero inside each triangle T𝑇T where the (symmetric) gradient of uεsubscript𝑢𝜀u_{\\varepsilon} is “large”. It might thus create a jump on the boundary of T𝑇T whose perimeter can be estimated by ℒ2​(T)/εsuperscriptℒ2𝑇𝜀{\\mathcal{L}}^{2}(T)/\\varepsilon. It leads to compactness in measure for the sequence {uε}ε>0subscriptsubscript𝑢𝜀𝜀0\\{u_{\\varepsilon}\\}_{\\varepsilon>0} (up to subtracting a sequence of piecewise rigid motions, leaving the energy unchanged), which thus justifies why it is natural to consider ΓΓ\\Gamma-convergence with respect to this topology. The upper bound causes no particular difficulty. It consists in using known density results in G​S​B​D2​(Ω)𝐺𝑆𝐵superscript𝐷2ΩGSBD^{2}(\\Omega) (see  ) to reduce to the case where the jump set of u𝑢u is made of finitely many pairwise disjoint closed line segments, and u𝑢u is smooth outside. Then, considering a similar optimal triangulation of ΩΩ\\Omega as in [ref]23 (whose vertices do not cross the jump set) and a piecewise affine Lagrange interpolation of u𝑢u, it leads to the desired upper bound (see Proposition 3.11). The proof of the lower bound inequality is much more delicate to address and it represents, to our opinion, the main achievement of this work.\nFirst of all, the blow-up method allows one to identify separately the bulk part and the singular part. The bulk part can be easily recovered by modifying uεsubscript𝑢𝜀u_{\\varepsilon} into a new function which vanishes in all triangles where e​(uε)𝑒subscript𝑢𝜀e(u_{\\varepsilon}) is “too large” as in the compactness argument (see Proposition 3.4). The main difficulty is to get a lower bound for the singular part of the energy. Before describing our strategy of proof, let us briefly explain why the methods of [ref]23 (and similarly ) fail in our situation. The idea of [ref]23 consists in modifying every minimizing sequence {uε}ε>0subscriptsubscript𝑢𝜀𝜀0\\{u_{\\varepsilon}\\}_{\\varepsilon>0} inside each triangle T𝑇T of the associated triangulation 𝐓ε∈𝒯ε​(Ω)superscript𝐓𝜀subscript𝒯𝜀Ω\\mathbf{T}^{\\varepsilon}\\in\\mathcal{T}_{\\varepsilon}(\\Omega) according to its variations along each edge of T𝑇T. It rests on the introduction of a jump criterion which stipulates that if the variation of uεsubscript𝑢𝜀u_{\\varepsilon} is large enough, it is convenient to create a jump along the edge. More precisely, if x1subscript𝑥1x_{1}, x2subscript𝑥2x_{2} and x3subscript𝑥3x_{3} stand for the vertices of the triangle T𝑇T, it will be energetically favorable to create a jump at the middle point of the segment [xi,xj]subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑥𝑗[x_{i},x_{j}] if for some constant σ>0𝜎0\\sigma>0, while uεsubscript𝑢𝜀u_{\\varepsilon} remains unchanged on [xi,xj]subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑥𝑗[x_{i},x_{j}] otherwise. This criterion has to be defined in such a way that: the new function, say wεsubscript𝑤𝜀w_{\\varepsilon}, has a jump set in each triangle T𝑇T which satisfies ℋ1​(Jwε∩T)≤ℒ2​(T)/(ε​sin⁡θ0)superscriptℋ1subscript𝐽subscript𝑤𝜀𝑇superscriptℒ2𝑇𝜀subscript𝜃0{\\mathcal{H}}^{1}(J_{w_{\\varepsilon}}\\cap T)\\leq{\\mathcal{L}}^{2}(T)/(\\varepsilon\\sin\\theta_{0}), where θ0subscript𝜃0\\theta_{0} is as in Definition 1.1, and wεsubscript𝑤𝜀w_{\\varepsilon} does not jump across ∂T𝑇\\partial T; the absolutely continuous part of the gradient, ∇wε∇subscript𝑤𝜀\\nabla w_{\\varepsilon}, is controlled in L2​(T)superscript𝐿2𝑇L^{2}(T) by the energy restricted to T𝑇T. This construction ensures that the variation of the new discontinuous and piecewise affine function wεsubscript𝑤𝜀w_{\\varepsilon} is always controlled along at least two edges of each triangle T𝑇T, and it yields a control of the full gradient ∇wε∇subscript𝑤𝜀\\nabla w_{\\varepsilon} of wεsubscript𝑤𝜀w_{\\varepsilon} inside T𝑇T. In [ref]23, this is possible thanks of the scalar nature of the problem because the gradient ∇wε|T\\nabla{w_{\\varepsilon}}_{|T} is a (constant) vector in ℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2} (see [23, Remark 3.5]). In our case, uεsubscript𝑢𝜀u_{\\varepsilon} is not scalar-valued anymore, but vector-valued and the energy only depends on its symmetric gradient e​(uε)𝑒subscript𝑢𝜀e(u_{\\varepsilon}). If one uses the same criterion than in [ref]23, then condition (i) above will be satisfied for the new function wεsubscript𝑤𝜀w_{\\varepsilon} on T𝑇T. However, one will only be able to estimate the L2superscript𝐿2L^{2}-norm of the (symmetric) gradient of wεsubscript𝑤𝜀w_{\\varepsilon} by that of the full gradient of uεsubscript𝑢𝜀u_{\\varepsilon} which, unfortunately, is not controlled by the energy ℱε​(uε)subscriptℱ𝜀subscript𝑢𝜀{\\mathcal{F}}_{\\varepsilon}(u_{\\varepsilon}). Note that in , such a control is artificially made possible thanks to the particular form of the energy (see (1.3) above). This is however not natural in this linearized elasticity setting where the energy should be expressed in terms of the symmetric gradient of the displacement. As a consequence, the jump criterion has to be modified. As the energy only depends on the symmetric part of the gradient of uεsubscript𝑢𝜀u_{\\varepsilon}, it would be natural to consider a criterion involving the longitudinal variation of uεsubscript𝑢𝜀u_{\\varepsilon} along the edges of the triangle instead of the full variation. In other words, one could modify the criterion by asking that\nif then we create a jump at the middle point of [xi,xj]subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑥𝑗[x_{i},x_{j}], while uεsubscript𝑢𝜀u_{\\varepsilon} remains unchanged on [xi,xj]subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑥𝑗[x_{i},x_{j}] otherwise. In that case, it is again not possible to control the symmetric gradient e​(wε)𝑒subscript𝑤𝜀e(w_{\\varepsilon}) of the new function wεsubscript𝑤𝜀w_{\\varepsilon} by that of uεsubscript𝑢𝜀u_{\\varepsilon}. Indeed, in a similar way as in [ref]23, the previous criterion ensures that the longitudinal variation of wεsubscript𝑤𝜀w_{\\varepsilon} along at least two edges of each triangle is controlled by the energy restricted to T𝑇T. If we call ξ1subscript𝜉1\\xi_{1} and ξ2∈𝕊1subscript𝜉2superscript𝕊1\\xi_{2}\\in\\mathbb{S}^{1} both (linearly independent) directions associated to these “good” edges, it shows that e​(wε)|T:(ξ1⊗ξ1)e(w_{\\varepsilon})_{|T}:(\\xi_{1}\\otimes\\xi_{1}) and e​(wε)|T:(ξ2⊗ξ2)e(w_{\\varepsilon})_{|T}:(\\xi_{2}\\otimes\\xi_{2}) are controlled by e​(uε)|Te(u_{\\varepsilon})_{|T} which is not enough to control the full 2×2222\\times 2 symmetric matrix e​(wε)|Te(w_{\\varepsilon})_{|T} which has three degrees of freedom. In addition, some (uncontrolled) discontinuities can also be created at the interface I:=∂T∩∂T′assign𝐼𝑇superscript𝑇′I:=\\partial T\\cap\\partial T^{\\prime} between two adjacent triangles T𝑇T and T′superscript𝑇′T^{\\prime} so that condition (i) fails as well. Overcoming these difficulties seems to be a very serious issue so that we decided to attack this problem from a different angle. First of all, the use of the blow-up method allows one to reduce to the case where Ω=BΩ𝐵\\Omega=B is the unit ball, u𝑢u is a step function of the form for some a𝑎a, b∈ℝ2𝑏superscriptℝ2b\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2} with a≠b𝑎𝑏a\\neq b and ν∈𝕊1𝜈superscript𝕊1\\nu\\in\\mathbb{S}^{1} (with a jump set corresponding to the diameter of B𝐵B orthogonal to ν𝜈\\nu), and, see Lemma 3.6, such that To make our strategy of proof more transparent, we assume that a⋅ν≠b⋅ν⋅𝑎𝜈⋅𝑏𝜈a\\cdot\\nu\\neq b\\cdot\\nu. A standard argument based on Fubini’s Theorem shows that the one-dimensional section of uεsubscript𝑢𝜀u_{\\varepsilon} in the direction ν𝜈\\nu passing through the point y𝑦y, namely t↦(uε)yν​(t):=uε​(y+t​ν)⋅νmaps-to𝑡superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑢𝜀𝑦𝜈𝑡assign⋅subscript𝑢𝜀𝑦𝑡𝜈𝜈t\\mapsto(u_{\\varepsilon})_{y}^{\\nu}(t):=u_{\\varepsilon}(y+t\\nu)\\cdot\\nu converges (in measure) to the step function Let us denote by 𝐓εsuperscript𝐓𝜀\\mathbf{T}^{\\varepsilon} the triangulation on which uεsubscript𝑢𝜀u_{\\varepsilon} is (continuous and) piecewise affine. We further denote by 𝐓bεsubscriptsuperscript𝐓𝜀𝑏\\mathbf{T}^{\\varepsilon}_{b} the familly of all triangles T∈𝐓ε𝑇superscript𝐓𝜀T\\in\\mathbf{T}^{\\varepsilon} such that |e​(uε)|T|2>κ/ε|e(u_{\\varepsilon})_{|T}|^{2}>\\kappa/\\varepsilon. Thanks to (1.7), we show that almost every line orthogonal to Ju∩Bsubscript𝐽𝑢𝐵J_{u}\\cap B must cross at least one triangle T∈𝐓bε𝑇subscriptsuperscript𝐓𝜀𝑏T\\in\\mathbf{T}^{\\varepsilon}_{b} (see Lemma 3.7). The reason is that if, for some y∈Ju∩B𝑦subscript𝐽𝑢𝐵y\\in J_{u}\\cap B, the line y+ℝ​ν𝑦ℝ𝜈y+\\mathbb{R}\\nu intersects no such triangles, then (uε)yνsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑢𝜀𝑦𝜈(u_{\\varepsilon})_{y}^{\\nu} would be bounded in H1superscript𝐻1H^{1} (because |((uε)yν)′|≤|e​(uε)​(y+t​ν)|superscriptsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑢𝜀𝑦𝜈′𝑒subscript𝑢𝜀𝑦𝑡𝜈|((u_{\\varepsilon})_{y}^{\\nu})^{\\prime}|\\leq|e(u_{\\varepsilon})(y+t\\nu)|) and thus, it would converge weakly in that space to a constant function, contradicting that a⋅ν≠b⋅ν⋅𝑎𝜈⋅𝑏𝜈a\\cdot\\nu\\neq b\\cdot\\nu. This information allows one to get a bad lower bound for the surface energy with 1/2121/2 multiplicative factor. It suggests to improve the previous argument by showing that “many” lines y+ℝ​ν𝑦ℝ𝜈y+\\mathbb{R}\\nu passing through y∈Ju∩B𝑦subscript𝐽𝑢𝐵y\\in J_{u}\\cap B must actually cross at least two triangles in 𝐓bεsubscriptsuperscript𝐓𝜀𝑏\\mathbf{T}^{\\varepsilon}_{b}, which is the object of Lemma 3.8. To do that, we show in Lemma 3.9 that there are very few points y𝑦y in Ju∩Bsubscript𝐽𝑢𝐵J_{u}\\cap B such that the line y+ℝ​ν𝑦ℝ𝜈y+\\mathbb{R}\\nu crosses exactly one triangle T∈𝐓bε𝑇subscriptsuperscript𝐓𝜀𝑏T\\in\\mathbf{T}^{\\varepsilon}_{b}. Indeed, in that case, up to a small error, the function (uε)yνsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑢𝜀𝑦𝜈(u_{\\varepsilon})_{y}^{\\nu} would have to pass from the value a⋅ν⋅𝑎𝜈a\\cdot\\nu to b⋅ν⋅𝑏𝜈b\\cdot\\nu inside T𝑇T. Due to the particular shape of a triangle and of the fact that uεsubscript𝑢𝜀u_{\\varepsilon} is affine inside T𝑇T, this could only happen for at most two values of y𝑦y. Moreover, if y𝑦y is far away from these two values, the variation of (uε)yνsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑢𝜀𝑦𝜈(u_{\\varepsilon})_{y}^{\\nu} across the triangle T𝑇T is not sufficient, and it becomes necessary to cross an additional triangle T′superscript𝑇′T^{\\prime} in 𝐓bεsubscriptsuperscript𝐓𝜀𝑏\\mathbf{T}^{\\varepsilon}_{b}. With this improvement, we can now construct two disjoint families of triangles with the property that both families project onto Ju∩Bsubscript𝐽𝑢𝐵J_{u}\\cap B into two sets of almost full ℋ1superscriptℋ1{\\mathcal{H}}^{1} measure (see Lemma 3.10). It enables one to compensate the bad multiplicative factor 1/2121/2 in the previous argument, and obtain the expected lower bound with the correct constant corresponding to κ​sin⁡θ0𝜅subscript𝜃0\\kappa\\sin\\theta_{0} (see Proposition 3.5). In , the right factor in the lower estimate of the jump part comes from the two transitions of the phase field approximating Jusubscript𝐽𝑢J_{u}, one from each side of the jump set. Similarily here, the same role is played by the characteristic function χε=𝟙{|e​(uε)|2>κ/ε}subscript𝜒𝜀subscript1superscript𝑒subscript𝑢𝜀2𝜅𝜀\\chi_{\\varepsilon}=\\mathds{1}_{\\left\\{\\left\\lvert e(u_{\\varepsilon})\\right\\rvert^{2}>\\kappa/\\varepsilon\\right\\}}. Indeed, having in mind the optimal triangulation computed in the upper bound (see [23, Appendix A]) and knowing that almost every line orthogonal to Ju∩Bsubscript𝐽𝑢𝐵J_{u}\\cap B crosses at least two distinct triangles of 𝐓bεsubscriptsuperscript𝐓𝜀𝑏\\mathbf{T}^{\\varepsilon}_{b}, we expect these triangles to form a neighbourhood of Jusubscript𝐽𝑢J_{u} as in Figure 1. Therefore, ℒ1​({(χε)yν=1})=ε​sin⁡θ0superscriptℒ1subscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝜒𝜀𝜈𝑦1𝜀subscript𝜃0{\\mathcal{L}}^{1}\\left(\\left\\{\\left(\\chi_{\\varepsilon}\\right)^{\\nu}_{y}=1\\right\\}\\right)=\\varepsilon\\sin\\theta_{0} which leads to the right lower bound, independently of the amplitude of the jump (b−a)⋅ν⋅𝑏𝑎𝜈(b-a)\\cdot\\nu. To conclude this introduction, let us mention that the originality of this work is twofold. First of all, we are able to provide a deterministic discrete finite element approximation result of the Griffith functional with isotropic surface energies. In particular, our approach does not require any unnatural dependence of the approximating energy with respect to the skew symmetric part of the gradient (in the context of linear elasticity) nor the use of stochastic meshes. Second, our method relies on an unusual application of the slicing method, which is rather employed in ΓΓ\\Gamma-convergence analysis to reduce the dimension of the problem to a one-dimension study. Here, we instead use this method as a tool to enumerate in a non trivial way the number of triangles needed to derive the correct multiplicity in the surface energy.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: to the case where the jump set of u𝑢u is made of finitely many pairwise disjoint closed line segments, and u𝑢u is smooth outside.
