Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: A Multilingual Study of Multi-Sentence Compression using Word Vertex-Labeled Graphs and Integer Linear Programming\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVarious corpora have been developed for MSC and are composed of clusters of similar sentences from different source news in English, French, Portuguese, Spanish or Vietnamese languages.\nWhereas the data built by McKeown et al.¬†[ref]24 and Luong et al.¬† have clusters limited to pairs of sentences,\nthe corpora made by Filippova¬†, Boudin and Morin¬†, and Linhares Pontes et al.¬† contain clusters of at least 7 similar sentences.\nMcKeown et al.¬†[ref]24 collected 300 English sentence pairs taken from newswire clusters using Amazon‚Äôs Mechanical Turk, while the corpus introduced in Luong et al.¬† is made of 250 Vietnamese sentences divided into 115 groups of similar sentences with 2 sentences by group.\nMcKeown et al.¬†[ref]24, Luong et al.¬†, Boudin and Morin¬†, and Linhares Pontes et al.¬† made their corpora publicly available, but only the data associated with these last two articles are more suited to the multi-document summarization or question-answering tasks because the documents to analyze are usually composed of many similar sentences.\nTherefore, we use these two corpora made of French, Portuguese and Spanish sentences. Table¬†1 summarizes the statistics of this set of data having 40 clusters of sentences for each language.\nThe Type-Token Ratio (TTR) indicates the reuse of tokens in a cluster and is defined by the number of unique tokens divided by the number of tokens in each cluster;\nthe lower the TTR, the greater the reuse of tokens in the cluster.\nThe sentence similarity represents the average cosine similarity of the sentences in a cluster.999The cosine similarity between two vectors uùë¢u and vùë£v associated with two sentences is defined by u‚ãÖv‚Äñu‚Äñ‚Äã‚Äñv‚Äñ‚ãÖùë¢ùë£normùë¢normùë£\\frac{u\\cdot v}{||u||\\ ||v||} in the   range. The French corpus has 3 sentences compressed by native speakers for each cluster,\nreferences having a compression rate (CR) of 60%.\nLike the French corpus, the Portuguese and Spanish corpora are composed of the first sentences of the articles found in Google News.\nEach cluster is composed of related sentences and was chosen among the first sentence from different articles about Science, Sport, Economy, Health, Business, Technology, Accidents/Catastrophes, General Information and other subjects.\nA cluster has at least 10 similar sentences by topic and 2 reference compressions made by different native speakers.\nThe average CRs are 54% and 61% for the Portuguese and the Spanish corpora, respectively. The three languages derive from Latin and are closely related languages. However, they differ in many details of their grammar and lexicon.\nMoreover, the datasets produced for the three languages are unlike according to several features.\nFirst, the corpus made by Linhares Pontes et al.¬† contains a smaller (Portuguese corpus) and a larger (Spanish corpus) dataset in terms of sentences than the French corpus.\nBesides, the compression rates of the three datasets indicate that the Portuguese source sentences have more irrelevant tokens.\nThe sentence similarity (Table¬†1, second last line) describes the variability of sentences in the source sentences and in the references, and reflects here that the sentences are slightly more diverse for the French corpus. This translates into a higher TTR observed for the French part (38.8%) than for the two other languages (33.7% and 35.2%).\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: for MSC and are composed of clusters of similar sentences from different source news in English, French, Portuguese, Spanish or Vietnamese languages.\nWhereas the data built by McKeown et al.¬†[ref]24 and Luong et al.¬† have clusters limited to pairs of sentences,\nthe corpora made by Filippova¬†, Boudin and Morin¬†, and Linhares Pontes et al.¬† contain clusters of at least 7 similar\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
