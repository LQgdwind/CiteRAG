      "content": "Paper Title: Talk, Don‚Äôt Write: A Study of Direct Speech-Based Image Retrieval\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe investigate the impact of best-in-class encoders for each modality and dual encoder training on retrieval. We compare this to prior work and run a series of ablations. Experimental settings: Our best Milan speech-image dual encoder uses a ResNet-50 audio encoder with CPC-8k speech representations, and an EfficientNet-B4 image tower pretrained on ImageNet. We pretrain the dual encoder on CSC and fine-tune on the target dataset with a batch size of 1024. Speech Preprocessing: We pad or crop all audio to 40 seconds in LocNarr, 20 seconds for PlacesAudio, and 8 seconds for FACC and CSC. Experiments show these are the optimal length values. We obtain speech representations via offline preprocessing from the CPC-8k model111The authors gave us the features and will open source the model. . This model takes a fixed 20s audio window; longer utterances (in LocNarr) are processed as independent 20 second chunks. CPC-8k‚Äôs output is a 1024-d representation of each 10ms of audio‚Äînotably, the same frame rate as MFCC frontends in most prior work, and common in speech processing applications. Image Preprocessing: During training, images are augmented with random brightening and saturation, and random cropping (to ‚â•67%absentpercent67{\\geq}67\\% of original area). Crops are rescaled to the image encoder‚Äôs native resolution (380x380 for EfficientNet-B4). We use the public EfficientNet TensorFlow Hub implementation222https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/efficientnet/b4/feature-vector/1 which comes with ImageNet pretrained weights. Optimization: Models are trained using Adam with a learning rate of 0.001 and exponential decay of 0.999 every 1000 training steps, Œ≤1=0.9subscriptùõΩ10.9\\beta_{1}{=}0.9, Œ≤2=0.999subscriptùõΩ20.999\\beta_{2}{=}0.999 and œµ=10‚àí8italic-œµsuperscript108\\epsilon{=}10^{-8}. We train on 32-core slices of Cloud TPU V3 pods with effective batch size of 1024 (unless specified otherwise).\nOur dual encoders are pretrained on CSC (Sec. 3). To do so, we train the model as described until convergence (‚âà\\approx87k steps), and select the model checkpoint that maximizes held-out retrieval performance. Evaluation: As in prior work, performance is evaluated by retrieving items in one modality (e.g.,¬†images) given a query of the other (e.g., captions). We report Recall@K (R@K): the fraction of times a correct item was found in the top K results. Main results:\nTable¬†2 compares Milan to prior work on FACC.\nMilan outperforms the previous best [ref]9 by a wide margin ‚Äì 11.4% absolute in Speech‚Üí‚Üí\\rightarrowImage R@1. Notably, that model (like [ref]28) exploits additional text supervision, which doubles their speech-only model‚Äôs R@1 of 10.5%. Such techniques are complementary to ours, so combining them may yield further improvements.\nMilan also outperforms  ‚Äì the previous best trained only on speech and images ‚Äì by 19.3% absolute in Speech‚Üí‚Üí\\rightarrowImage R@1. This model, like ours, was pretrained on CSC. This suggests improved retrieval can be attributed to our use of better speech representations and stronger image encoder, which improve even more via joint pretraining. Table¬†3 compares Milan to prior work on PlacesAudio. Note: this is for the original validation set of PlacesAudio, which had no held out test split. Compared to the previous best, Milan nearly doubles R@1 for Speech‚Üí‚Üí\\rightarrowImage and more than doubles it for Image‚Üí‚Üí\\rightarrowSpeech.\nMilan outperforms others that incorporate local information with cross-modal fusion¬†[ref]12  by more than 20% absolute in R@1. Although our method can be combined with cross-modal fusion, it would not be able to perform retrieval at scale (see Sec.¬†3). Finally, we compare Milan to , a concurrent work using pretraining on images from 1.2M Youtube videos. It shows improvements consistent with our findings on pretraining. A new split of PlacesAudio has been created to include held out test material. This addresses the worry that current results (e.g., Table 3) may involve cherry-picking. It also provides separate dev/test-seen and dev/test-unseen splits to allow comparisons for seen (heard) and unseen (unheard) speakers. Table¬†1 shows results on the test-seen and test-unseen sets. In both cases, Milan was optimized on the respective development sets (i.e., dev-seen and dev-unseen). We also obtained results for the ResDAVEnet model  (provided by the authors) trained and evaluated on these splits. It includes a better learning rate schedule and other optimization improvements compared to the model in the original paper. Interestingly, ResDAVEnet shows huge gains when using ImageNet pretraining, which is consistent with our findings, broadly. Milan nevertheless provides large gains over the more complex model. Interestingly both ResDAVEnet and Milan perform better on unseen speakers than seen ones. Because these new splits support tuning on separate validation split, we hope future work will focus on the new splits. Our results here for both can help anchor such future evaluations. Ablation study:\nTo understand the effect of each modeling choice, we evaluate variants of our best model, shown in Table¬†4 for FACC, PlacesAudio, and LocNarr (for simplicity, we use only the Flickr30k subset of LocNarr). CPC-8k ‚Üí‚Üí\\rightarrow wav2vec and CPC-8k ‚Üí‚Üí\\rightarrow MFCC respectively swap CPC-8k speech representations with wav2vec  features, a similar self-supervised model (trained only on English) and a standard MFCC frontend (128d frames extracted from 20ms windows every 10ms). The remaining variants use MFCC features and apply a series of cumulative ablations. Shallow Speech Enc. replaces the deep ResNet50 audio encoder with a three-layer CNN . No pretraining removes CSC pretraining. ResNet152 replaces the EfficientNet-B4 image encoder with ResNet152333https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/resnet_v1_152/feature_vector/4 (larger, but has poorer ImageNet accuracy). Finally, Batch size 128 reduces the training batch size from 1024 to 128 to match (approximately) that used in prior work. In other regards, models are trained as described in Sec. 4. Table 4 shows that changing elements of our best recipe generally lowers performance for all datasets (with two notable exceptions discussed below). Of the speech representations, CPC-8k features perform the best uniformly, followed by wav2vec and MFCCs (the worst by a wide margin). Clearly, self-supervised speech representations are very effective. We see a large improvement by using a bigger speech encoder. The increase of expressivity combined with pretraining on CSC is crucial for small datasets (e.g., FACC). We observed that when only increasing the amount of parameters of the model without including more data, the effect is diminished. On the contrary, pretraining negatively affects performance for LocNarr444The quality drop with pretraining disappears when using CPC-8k. due to the domain gap between synthesized speech using US English text-to-speech models and Indian English speech. These findings indicate it would help to include accent variation to the synthetic speech diversity of . Finally, in the last two rows from Table¬†4, we observe the effect of batch sizes on the different datasets. Interestingly, we see that increasing the batch size harms FACC but helps larger datasets such as PlacesAudio and LocNarr. Transcription-based Comparison: An alternative strategy for speech-to-image retrieval is to use ASR and a modern text encoder (e.g., BERT ), and then train a text tower in a dual encoder using paired text-image data. Some work with spoken captions has exploited text as an additional training signal [ref]28 [ref]9. Some use ground truth text [ref]12 , which is unrealistic for real-world applications. [ref]12 and [ref]9 do compare direct speech encoding to the ASR-text strategy. However, the architectures they used were similar to that for speech. Here, we use much stronger modern text encoding methods to provide a better competitor to direct speech encoders. Where possible, we also compare the performance when using ASR output versus ground-truth written captions. We create a text tower using an architecture similar to that in : it computes per-word, contextualized BERT embeddings and inputs these to a 3-layer transformer stack. We pretrain this tower using the written captions in Conceptual Captions , which also fine-tunes the ImageNet-pretrained EfficientNet model used for the image tower, similarly to audio pretraining discussed before. Table¬†6 shows that this text encoder performs far better than previous ones used in the transcribed speech-image retrieval literature‚Äîa word-based  and character-based  GRU encoder, and a CNN [ref]12. It is also competitive with other dual encoders used in text-image retrieval work‚Äîit obtains R@1 of 52.0% for image-to-text and 37.9% for text-to-image retrieval on MS-COCO 5k , compared to 53.0% / 40.5% for VSRN . The key question is whether models that encode speech directly can outperform models using such a text encoder on ASR output of the speech. Table¬†5 shows indeed this is possible: the direct speech encoder has double the performance of the ASR strategy for LocNarr. Recall that the speech in LocNarr is Indian English, and the ASR quality is lower than it is for US English. The direct speech encoder matches the ASR strategy for PlacesAudio (which has US English speech). Compared to using ground-truth transcriptions (possible only for FACC and LocNarr), there is clearly much room for improving direct audio encoding versus working with clean, high-fidelity text. For real-world scenarios where speech is spontaneous (PlacesAudio) or spontaneous and accented (LocNarr), a strong speech encoder like Milan‚Äôs is a better option. However, if one has high quality audio and standard, non-conversational speech, the ASR approach works better.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: We report Recall@K (R@K): the fraction of times a correct item was found in the top K results.
