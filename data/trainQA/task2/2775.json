      "content": "Paper Title: Zero-shot Natural Language Video Localization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEarly NLVL works studied relatively constrained environments, such as only cooking events .\nRecently, large scale, unconstrained NLVL datasets such as Charades-STA , ActivityNet-Captions  has been appeared. And facilitated by them, there have been advances in deep learning techniques     , notably in attentive models   . However, as the annotations for NLVL are expensive, some literature address weakly-supervised setup of NLVL 8 [ref]12   (WS-NLVL) to alleviate the temporal event annotation.\nThere are various ways to tackle the problem, such as training WS-NLVL as a part of training video captioning [ref]12, building joint visual-semantic embedding framework 8, or selecting among event region proposals  .\nHowever, although they successfully reduced the temporal annotation cost, the remaining cost of natural language query is still considerable. In contrast, our zero-shot NLVL eliminates both annotations. There have been several attempts to classify and localize temporal actions without annotations about actions.\nZero-shot action recognition works et al.     [ref]11 tackled recognizing pre-defined action categories from a video without action labels. Addressing the problem, a number of recent works exploitted object-action co-occurrence patterns from large corpora    [ref]11.\nThese works share similarity with our pseudo-query generation as they utilize co-occurrence patterns of objects and actions. However, our pseudo-supervision generation is more challenging because of the several assumptions they made; they assume the ground truth object labels to be already annotated for the target dataset, action categories to be pre-defined, and videos to be already trimmed according to the ground truth event region  [ref]11.\nAnother line of the works that recognize (or localize) actions without annotated actions is mining action annotations from web      .\nThey enable labor-free training of action recognition models , but they have potential issues on privacy  , and often assume weak-level annotations   to be exist. Meanwhile, Soomro et al.  proposed unsupervised action discovery task to localize actions using only video collections. Jain et al.  utilized abruptly changing 3D-CNN features to find atomic actions which is combined to compose complex actions. The task that both Soomro et al. and Jain et al. addresses is similar with our temporal event proposal for generating pseudo-supervisions, but they assume the action classes to be pre-defined and they do not consider relating the actions to language queries. Generating natural language sentences from unlabeled data (e.g. sentences with other language, images) addresses similar tasks to our pseudo-query generation.\nUnsupervised neural machine translation  0 1 tackled training neural machine translation model without parallel corpora.\nThey partially share the same idea with our pseudo-labeling as they leverage unlabeled sentences for each language to translate.\nMotivated by the unsupervised neural machine translation (NMT),   proposed unsupervised image captioning.\nOur task setup is partially inspired by this setup; they use an object detector and the independent set of images and sentences to train image captioning, and our zero-shot NLVL uses an off-the-shelf object detector and the independent set of videos and sentences.\nCompared to these tasks, our task is more challenging since pseudo-supervision includes finding temporal regions to be queried, in addition to just generating natural language generation.\nAdditionally, we handle videos and sentences, which is more complex than sentences  0 1 and images  .\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: have been advances in deep learning techniques     , notably in attentive models   .

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
