Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as one of the most powerful network embedding approaches due to their ability to conduct deep learning on non-Euclidean graph data . Spectral CNN  first defines the spectral convolution operation on the graph domain by employing filters on graph signals. Following , ChebNet [ref]23 performs localized approximation of the filter by Chebyshev polynomials of the eigenvalues. GCN  further introduces a first-order approximation of ChebNet. GraphSage [ref]24 defines a message passing process from neighbors to update the central node’s representation and proposes mini-batch training for model scalability. GAT [ref]25 introduces an attention mechanism to aggregate neighbor messages with adaptive weights. A hypergraph is a generalization of a graph in which a hyperedge can join an arbitrary number of vertices, so that can model high-order interactions. Similar to GNNs, recent research has also extended deep learning to hypergraphs, giving rise to hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs). HGNN  first defines convolution on hypergraphs with hypergraph Laplacian matrix . HyperGCN  simplifies the scheme by approximating each hyperedge with a pairwise edge.  further introduces wavelet basis to hypergraph convolution.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: to conduct deep learning on non-Euclidean graph data .
