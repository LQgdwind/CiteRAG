      "content": "Paper Title: Explainable Link Prediction for Emerging Entities in Knowledge Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nKnowledge graph completion can be viewed as an instance of the more general problem of link prediction in a graph . Due to advances in representation learning, embedding-based methods have become the most popular approach. Such methods learn d𝑑d-dimensional distributed vector representations of entities and relations in a knowledge graph. To this end, the translation embedding model TransE [ref]3 learns the embedding of a relation as a simple translation vector from the source entity to the target entity such that 𝐞s+𝐞r≈𝐞osubscript𝐞𝑠subscript𝐞𝑟subscript𝐞𝑜\\mathbf{e}_{s}+\\mathbf{e}_{r}\\approx\\mathbf{e}_{o}. Its variants, e.g., TransH , TransR , TransD  consider similar objectives.\nTri-linear models such as DistMult , along with its counterpart ComplEx [ref]35 in the complex embedding space, use a multiplicative scoring function f​(s,r,o)=𝐞s⊺​𝐖r​𝐞o𝑓𝑠𝑟𝑜superscriptsubscript𝐞𝑠⊺subscript𝐖𝑟subscript𝐞𝑜f(s,r,o)=\\mathbf{e}_{s}^{\\intercal}\\mathbf{W}_{r}\\mathbf{e}_{o}, where WrsubscriptW𝑟\\textbf{W}_{r} is a diagonal matrix representing the embedding of relation r𝑟r.\nConvolutional neural network models such as ConvE [ref]7 and ConvKB  apply convolutional kernels over entity and relation embeddings to capture the interactions among them across different dimensions.\nThese models obtain state-of-the-art results on the benchmark KBC datasets. However, none of the above-mentioned approaches deliver the full reasoning paths that license specific multi-hop inferences, and hence they either do not support multi-hop inference or do not support it in an interpretable manner. Moreover, these approaches assume a static snapshot of the knowledge graph to train the models and are not straightforwardly extensible to inductive representation learning with previously unseen entities.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: the most popular approach. Such methods learn d𝑑d-dimensional distributed vector representations of entities and relations in a knowledge graph. To this end, the translation embedding model TransE [ref]3 learns the embedding of a relation as a simple translation vector from the source entity to the target entity such that\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
