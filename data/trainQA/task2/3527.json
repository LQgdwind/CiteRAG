Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

We compare with both early-fusion methods such as  [ref]28  and late-fusion methods such as  [ref]21. ALBEF [ref]25 is an hybrid approach that also performs feature alignment along with fusion. Results in Table 1 and 2 show consistent improvements of our approach against prior state-of-the-arts. “Zero-shot”: As shown from Table 1, CODIS outperforms existing baselines with a clear margin across the two datasets, for both image and text retrieval tasks, especially at R@1. Compared to the best-performing early-fusion approach , we obtain a margin of 11.0%percent11.011.0\\%/13.5%percent13.513.5\\% TR/IR in terms of R@1 on Flickr30K. When compared to highest late-fusion approach [ref]21, there’s an increase of 12.9%percent12.912.9\\%/8.3%percent8.38.3\\% TR/IR in R@1 on MSCOCO and a boost of 3.1%percent3.13.1\\%/4.0%percent4.04.0\\% TR/IR in R@1 on Flickr30K, despite the fact that ALIGN [ref]21 uses 1.8B data in training (approx. 360×\\times more image-text pairs than our model). Our approach also outperforms ALBEF 4M [ref]25 with a clear margin of 2.9%/3.8% R@1 for TR/IR on MSCOCO and 1.2%/2.9% in terms of R@1 for TR/IR on Flickr30K, revealing that our model can further benefit from codebook representation learning. “After-finetuning”: This task showcases the ability of V&L pretraining via transfer learning. For small datasets such as Flickr30K, performance gap tends to reduce as the model converges. However, our approach still achieves the best result in most of the metrics and the largest margins occur for R@1, especially on MSCOCO. Compared against the closest performing method ALBEF [ref]25, CODIS obtains an improvement of 2.2%/1.9%percent2.2percent1.92.2\\%/1.9\\% TR/IR in R@1 on MSCOCO, providing evidence to the effectiveness of CODIS for transfer learning.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: For the image-text retrieval tasks, we conduct two different scenarios for evaluation: “zero-shot” retrieval task and “after-finetuning” retrieval task, following the setting in [ref]25  [ref]28.
