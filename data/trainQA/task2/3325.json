      "content": "Paper Title: Impact of Stop Sets on Stopping Active Learning for Text Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn our experiments, we perform text classification with seven widely used publicly available datasets. To make our results as reproducible as possible, we use the train-test split recognized by the community if such a split exists. Otherwise, we perform 10-fold cross validation. We use the ‚Äúbydate‚Äù version of the 20NewsGroups222http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/ dataset and classify its newsgroup postings into 20 categories. We use the Reuters-21578 Distribution 1.0 ModApte split333http://www.daviddlewis.com/resources/testcollections/reuters21578/ as in ,  and classify the 10 largest categories of business news articles. We classify email spam from the SpamAssassin444https://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/ corpus and the ham25 version of the TREC555https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/gvcormac/foo corpus. We use the results from the four largest categories of academic webpages in the WebKB666http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/theo-20/www/data/ dataset as in , , , . We use 10-fold cross validation for SpamAssassin, TREC, and WebKB; we macro average our results across folds and categories. In order to compare directly with the technology assisted sensitivity review experiment conducted in  we tried to obtain the dataset that was used in that paper. Unfortunately, this dataset is private and cannot be shared with other researchers (personal communication with Graham McDonald). Instead, we perform TC on the publicly available RCV1-v2 dataset [ref]32 that has been used frequently in past works to simulate TAR , , , [ref]36, [ref]37, . Most of these authors use a subset of the 103 RCV1-v2 categories; we use all 103 of them. RCV1-v2 is computationally demanding, so we do not use it in all of our experiments. We use a support vector machine with a linear kernel and C=1, as done by   . We use the closest-to-hyperplane selection algorithm as the query strategy during AL, as done by   . We also use random selection, that is, passive learning, for a comparison experiment. We allocate 50%percent5050\\% of training examples to the randomly selected stop set, SùëÜS, as in . We use a batch size of 0.5%percent0.50.5\\%, consistent with the findings of . We use a bag-of-words approach that only considers words that appear more than three times. For all datasets other than RCV1-v2777RCV1-v2 already comes with stop words removed., during preprocessing we remove 174 stop words using the Default English Stopwords List888https://www.ranks.nl/stopwords. When comparing stopping methods, we report the number of annotations (i.e., labels) acquired (denoted by ANN in our tables), the proportion of annotations of the entire dataset acquired (ANN-P in tables), the learned model‚Äôs F-1 measure (F1), F-2 measure (F2), accuracy (ACC), and balanced accuracy (BAC), all at the time the stopping method indicates to stop AL. These performance measures were used in , which will help to facilitate comparison. We also display these statistics when the model is given all possible training data (denoted by the column ‚ÄúFinal‚Äù in our tables). F-Œ≤ùõΩ\\beta Measure is a weighted harmonic mean between precision and recall, where Œ≤ùõΩ\\beta is a constant such that recall is Œ≤ùõΩ\\beta times more important than precision. Accuracy is the proportion of the model‚Äôs predictions that are correct. Balanced accuracy is the average of the recall scores for each class. We report these statistics for individual datasets, as well as a macro average across all datasets. In our tables we boldface entries that are the best-performing for each metric. Lower numbers are better for ANN and ANN-P because that reflects reducing the amount of labeled data required. Higher numbers are better for the other metrics since that reflects better system performance for end-users.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: Unfortunately, this dataset is private and cannot be shared with other researchers (personal communication with Graham McDonald).
