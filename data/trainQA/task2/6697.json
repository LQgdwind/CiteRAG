      "content": "Paper Title: BOURNE: Bootstrapped Self-supervised Learning Framework for Unified Graph Anomaly Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSince BOURNE is a self-supervised GAD model for both node and edge anomaly detection tasks, we compare BOURNE with three types of baselines: (1) Node anomaly detection methods (Radar , ANOMALOUS , DOMINANT [ref]10, AnomalyDAE , CoLA [ref]11 and SL-GAD ), (2) Edge anomaly detection methods (UGED [ref]15 and AANE ), and (3) Self-supervised graph representation learning methods (DGI  and GAE ). For type (3) methods, since they are not originally designed for anomaly detection, we employ scoring functions from CoLA and UGED to compute anomaly scores for DGI and GAE, repectively. Details of these methods are introduced as follows: Node anomaly detection methods: Radar  is an unsupervised shallow method that detects node anomalies by analyzing the residual errors in attribute reconstruction. ANOMALOUS  is an unsupervised shallow method that detects node anomalies through CUR decomposition and residual analysis. DOMINANT [ref]10 is a deep graph autoencoder-based unsupervised method that detects node anomalies by assessing the reconstruction errors of individual nodes. AnomalyDAE  is also an autoencoder-based\nunsupervised method. The encoder is graph attention networks  while the decoder reconstructs the node attributes. Each node is ranked for anomalies according to its corresponding reconstruction loss. CoLA [ref]11 is a contrastive unsupervised learning-based anomaly detection method that captures node anomaly patterns by measuring the agreement between each node and its contextual subgraph using a GNN-based encoder. SL-GAD  is a self-supervised anomaly detection method that combines both attribute reconstruction and contrastive learning for detecting node anomalies. Edge anomaly detection methods: UGED [ref]15 is an unsupervised edge anomaly detection model that utilizes an autoencoder and a fully connected network to identify edge abnormality through its appearance probability. AANE  is a GNN-based unsupervised edge anomaly detection method that calculates the abnormality of edges as hyperbolic tangents of connected node embeddings. Self-supervised representation learning methods: DGI  is a representative graph contrastive learning method that learns node representation by maximizing agreement between positive node-graph pairs and minimizing agreement between negative pairs. We employ the bilinear discriminator in CoLA to score node anomalies. GAE  learns the latent representation unsupervisedly by minimizing the reconstruction loss between the original graph and the reconstructed graph. Here we further use the strategy from UGED to detect the edge anomalies.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: is a self-supervised GAD model for both node and edge anomaly detection tasks, we compare BOURNE with three types of baselines: (1) Node anomaly detection methods (Radar , ANOMALOUS , DOMINANT [ref]10, AnomalyDAE , CoLA [ref]11 and SL-GAD ), (2) Edge anomaly detection methods (UGED [ref]15 and AANE ), and (3) Self-supervised graph representation learning methods (DGI  and GAE ).

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
