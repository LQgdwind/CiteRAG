Views and opinions expressed are however those of the author(s) only and do not necessarily reflect those of the European Union or the European Research Council Executive Agency. Neither the European Union nor the granting authority can be held responsible for them.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNext, we concern ourselves with monotone properties.\nLet k≥1𝑘1k\\geq 1 and let ΦΦ\\Phi be a k𝑘k-vertex graph property.\nWe say that ΦΦ\\Phi is monotone if G​[S]∈Φ𝐺delimited-[]𝑆ΦG[S]\\in\\Phi for every G∈Φ𝐺ΦG\\in\\Phi and every S⊆E​(G)𝑆𝐸𝐺S\\subseteq E(G).\nFor an arbitrary property ΦΦ\\Phi, we say that ΦΦ\\Phi is monotone on k𝑘k-vertex graphs if Φ(k)superscriptΦ𝑘\\Phi^{(k)} is monotone. In the literature (on the complexity of counting induced subgraphs; see, e.g.,  [ref]20 ) this type of property is usually called edge-monotone whereas monotone properties are usually those that are hereditary and edge-monotone (on k𝑘k-vertex graphs for all k≥1𝑘1k\\geq 1). We prefer monotone properties since we are generally aiming to follow the notation used for analysing Boolean functions (see, e.g., ). The following theorem is a simple modification of a result from . Let k≥1𝑘1k\\geq 1 and p𝑝p a prime number.\nLet ΦΦ\\Phi is a k𝑘k-vertex graph property that is monotone and not k𝑘k-trivial. Then there is some k𝑘k-vertex graph H𝐻H such that Φ^​(H)≠0modp^Φ𝐻modulo0𝑝\\widehat{\\Phi}(H)\\neq 0\\bmod p and the complete bipartite graph Kℓ,ℓsubscript𝐾ℓℓK_{\\ell,\\ell} is a subgraph of H𝐻H for some ℓ>kp2ℓ𝑘superscript𝑝2\\ell>\\frac{k}{p^{2}}. More concretely, building on earlier work of Rivest and Vuillemin , Dodis and Khanna  show that the polynomial qΦsubscript𝑞Φq_{\\Phi} has degree Ω​(k2)Ωsuperscript𝑘2\\Omega(k^{2}) if ΦΦ\\Phi is a graph property on k𝑘k-vertex graphs that is monotone and not k𝑘k-trivial.\nMore precisely,  shows that qΦsubscript𝑞Φq_{\\Phi} has degree Ω​(k2)Ωsuperscript𝑘2\\Omega(k^{2}) when interpreted as a polynomial over the two-element field ℤ2subscriptℤ2{\\mathbb{Z}}_{2}.\nAnalysing their arguments in more detail, it is in fact shown that qΦsubscript𝑞Φq_{\\Phi} contains a monomial (with non-zero coefficient) that corresponds to a graph H𝐻H such that Kℓ,ℓsubscript𝐾ℓℓK_{\\ell,\\ell} is a subgraph of H𝐻H for some ℓ>k4ℓ𝑘4\\ell>\\frac{k}{4}.\nA simple extension of the arguments gives the statement above for every prime p≥3𝑝3p\\geq 3. Since  does not provide proof details and their arguments need to be slightly extended, we give a full proof here.\nLet us stress again that the following proof of Theorem 5.5 precisely follows the arguments from . Toward the proof of Theorem 5.5, we require some additional tools.\nFor a finite set ΩΩ\\Omega we write Sym⁡(Ω)SymΩ\\operatorname{Sym}(\\Omega) to denote the symmetric group over ground set ΩΩ\\Omega.\nFor m≥1𝑚1m\\geq 1 we also write Smsubscript𝑆𝑚S_{m} as a shortcut for of Sym⁡([m])Symdelimited-[]𝑚\\operatorname{Sym}([m]). Let p𝑝p be a prime number and m≥1𝑚1m\\geq 1.\nLet f:{0,1}m→ℤp:𝑓→superscript01𝑚subscriptℤ𝑝f\\colon\\{0,1\\}^{m}\\to{\\mathbb{Z}}_{p} be a function over ℤpsubscriptℤ𝑝{\\mathbb{Z}}_{p} of arity m𝑚m.\nA permutation σ∈Sm𝜎subscript𝑆𝑚\\sigma\\in S_{m} is an automorphism of f𝑓f if f​(𝒂)=f​(𝒂σ)𝑓𝒂𝑓superscript𝒂𝜎f(\\boldsymbol{a})=f(\\boldsymbol{a}^{\\sigma}) for every 𝒂=(a1,…,am)∈{0,1}m𝒂subscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑚superscript01𝑚\\boldsymbol{a}=(a_{1},\\dots,a_{m})\\in\\{0,1\\}^{m} where 𝒂σ=(aσ​(1),…,aσ​(m))superscript𝒂𝜎subscript𝑎𝜎1…subscript𝑎𝜎𝑚\\boldsymbol{a}^{\\sigma}=(a_{\\sigma(1)},\\dots,a_{\\sigma(m)}) is the tuple obtained from 𝒂𝒂\\boldsymbol{a} by permuting its entries according to σ𝜎\\sigma.\nWe define the automorphism group of f𝑓f, denoted by Aut⁡(f)Aut𝑓\\operatorname{Aut}(f), to be the group of all automorphisms of f𝑓f.\nWe say that f𝑓f is transitive if Aut⁡(f)Aut𝑓\\operatorname{Aut}(f) is transitive, i.e., for every i,j∈[m]𝑖𝑗delimited-[]𝑚i,j\\in[m] there is some σ∈Aut⁡(f)𝜎Aut𝑓\\sigma\\in\\operatorname{Aut}(f) such that σ​(i)=j𝜎𝑖𝑗\\sigma(i)=j. Similar to before, the function f𝑓f can be written as a multilinear polynomial over ℤpsubscriptℤ𝑝{\\mathbb{Z}}_{p} as We write degp⁡(f)subscriptdegree𝑝𝑓\\deg_{p}(f) to denote the degree of q𝑞q (over the field ℤpsubscriptℤ𝑝{\\mathbb{Z}}_{p}). Also, we write 0→=(0,…,0)→00…0\\vec{0}=(0,\\dots,0) and 1→=(1,…,1)→11…1\\vec{1}=(1,\\dots,1) to denote the all-zero and all-one vector of length m𝑚m, respectively. Let f:{0,1}m→ℤp:𝑓→superscript01𝑚subscriptℤ𝑝f\\colon\\{0,1\\}^{m}\\to{\\mathbb{Z}}_{p} be a function over ℤpsubscriptℤ𝑝{\\mathbb{Z}}_{p} where p𝑝p is prime and m=pk𝑚superscript𝑝𝑘m=p^{k} for some integer k≥1𝑘1k\\geq 1.\nAlso suppose f𝑓f is transitive and f​(0→)≠f​(1→)𝑓→0𝑓→1f(\\vec{0})\\neq f(\\vec{1}).\nThen degp⁡(f)=msubscriptdegree𝑝𝑓𝑚\\deg_{p}(f)=m. Let q​(𝒙)=q​(x1,…,xm)𝑞𝒙𝑞subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑚q(\\boldsymbol{x})=q(x_{1},\\dots,x_{m}) denote the unique multilinear polynomial over ℤpsubscriptℤ𝑝{\\mathbb{Z}}_{p} representing f𝑓f.\nWe write the polynomial as for appropriate numbers q^​(S)∈ℤp^𝑞𝑆subscriptℤ𝑝\\widehat{q}(S)\\in{\\mathbb{Z}}_{p} for every S⊆[m]𝑆delimited-[]𝑚S\\subseteq[m].\nObserve that f​(0→)=q​(0→)=q^​(∅)𝑓→0𝑞→0^𝑞f(\\vec{0})=q(\\vec{0})=\\widehat{q}(\\emptyset) and We need to argue that q^​([m])≠0^𝑞delimited-[]𝑚0\\widehat{q}([m])\\neq 0.\nThe following two claims form the key ingredients. For every S⊆[m]𝑆delimited-[]𝑚S\\subseteq[m] and σ∈Aut⁡(f)𝜎Aut𝑓\\sigma\\in\\operatorname{Aut}(f), we have q^​(S)=q^​(Sσ)^𝑞𝑆^𝑞superscript𝑆𝜎\\widehat{q}(S)=\\widehat{q}(S^{\\sigma}), where Sσ={σ​(i)∣i∈S}superscript𝑆𝜎conditional-set𝜎𝑖𝑖𝑆S^{\\sigma}=\\{\\sigma(i)\\mid i\\in S\\}. Let σ∈Aut⁡(f)𝜎Aut𝑓\\sigma\\in\\operatorname{Aut}(f).\nConsider the polynomial We have that for all 𝒂∈{0,1}m𝒂superscript01𝑚\\boldsymbol{a}\\in\\{0,1\\}^{m}.\nSince the multilinear representation of f𝑓f is unique, we conclude that q=qσ𝑞subscript𝑞𝜎q=q_{\\sigma} which implies that q^​(S)=q^​(Sσ)^𝑞𝑆^𝑞superscript𝑆𝜎\\widehat{q}(S)=\\widehat{q}(S^{\\sigma}) for every S⊆[m]𝑆delimited-[]𝑚S\\subseteq[m].\n∎ For every ∅⊊S⊊[m]𝑆delimited-[]𝑚\\emptyset\\subsetneq S\\subsetneq[m], the cardinality of SAut⁡(f)≔{Sσ∣σ∈Aut⁡(f)}≔superscript𝑆Aut𝑓conditional-setsuperscript𝑆𝜎𝜎Aut𝑓S^{\\operatorname{Aut}(f)}\\coloneqq\\{S^{\\sigma}\\mid\\sigma\\in\\operatorname{Aut}(f)\\} is divisible by p𝑝p. Let ∅⊊S⊊[m]𝑆delimited-[]𝑚\\emptyset\\subsetneq S\\subsetneq[m].\nWe show that First observe that this implies the claim, since |S|<m𝑆𝑚|S|<m and hence, at least one prime factor of m=pk𝑚superscript𝑝𝑘m=p^{k} needs to divide |SAut⁡(f)|superscript𝑆Aut𝑓|S^{\\operatorname{Aut}(f)}|. To show Equation (12), consider the |SAut⁡(f)|superscript𝑆Aut𝑓|S^{\\operatorname{Aut}(f)}| by m𝑚m matrix M𝑀M with entries for all S′∈SAut⁡(f)superscript𝑆′superscript𝑆Aut𝑓S^{\\prime}\\in S^{\\operatorname{Aut}(f)} and i∈[m]𝑖delimited-[]𝑚i\\in[m].\nNow, we count the number of ones in the matrix M𝑀M by rows and by columns. First, counting the number of ones by rows gives |S|⋅|SAut⁡(f)|⋅𝑆superscript𝑆Aut𝑓|S|\\cdot|S^{\\operatorname{Aut}(f)}| since each row contains exactly |S|𝑆|S| many ones since all sets in SAut⁡(f)superscript𝑆Aut𝑓S^{\\operatorname{Aut}(f)} have the same size.\nOn the other hand, the first column of M𝑀M contains |{S′∈SAut⁡(f)∣1∈S′}|conditional-setsuperscript𝑆′superscript𝑆Aut𝑓1superscript𝑆′|\\{S^{\\prime}\\in S^{\\operatorname{Aut}(f)}\\mid 1\\in S^{\\prime}\\}| many ones.\nSince f𝑓f is transitive, all columns contain the same number of ones, so in total we get m⋅|{S′∈SAut⁡(f)∣1∈S′}|⋅𝑚conditional-setsuperscript𝑆′superscript𝑆Aut𝑓1superscript𝑆′m\\cdot|\\{S^{\\prime}\\in S^{\\operatorname{Aut}(f)}\\mid 1\\in S^{\\prime}\\}| many one-entries.\nTogether, this implies Equation (12).\n∎ We partition the power set 2[m]superscript2delimited-[]𝑚2^{[m]} of the set [m]delimited-[]𝑚[m] into the orbits O0,O1,…,Oℓsubscript𝑂0subscript𝑂1…subscript𝑂ℓO_{0},O_{1},\\dots,O_{\\ell} under the automorphism group Aut⁡(f)Aut𝑓\\operatorname{Aut}(f).\nObserve that {∅}\\{\\emptyset\\} and {[m]}delimited-[]𝑚\\{[m]\\} are two of the orbits and we may assume without loss of generality that O0={∅}subscript𝑂0O_{0}=\\{\\emptyset\\} and Oℓ={[m]}subscript𝑂ℓdelimited-[]𝑚O_{\\ell}=\\{[m]\\}.\nBy Claim 5.8 we get that p𝑝p divides |Oj|subscript𝑂𝑗|O_{j}| for every j∈{1,…,ℓ−1}𝑗1…ℓ1j\\in\\{1,\\dots,\\ell-1\\}.\nLet j∈{1,…,ℓ−1}𝑗1…ℓ1j\\in\\{1,\\dots,\\ell-1\\}.\nBy Claim 5.7 we get that q^​(S)=q^​(S′)^𝑞𝑆^𝑞superscript𝑆′\\widehat{q}(S)=\\widehat{q}(S^{\\prime}) for all S,S′∈Oj𝑆superscript𝑆′subscript𝑂𝑗S,S^{\\prime}\\in O_{j}.\nSo since p𝑝p divides |Oj|subscript𝑂𝑗|O_{j}| and all operations are carried out over ℤpsubscriptℤ𝑝{\\mathbb{Z}}_{p}.\nOverall, this means that Because f​(0→)=q​(0→)=q^​(∅)𝑓→0𝑞→0^𝑞f(\\vec{0})=q(\\vec{0})=\\widehat{q}(\\emptyset) and f​(0→)≠f​(1→)𝑓→0𝑓→1f(\\vec{0})\\neq f(\\vec{1}), we conclude that q^​([m])≠0^𝑞delimited-[]𝑚0\\widehat{q}([m])\\neq 0.\n∎ Let p𝑝p be a prime number and m≥1𝑚1m\\geq 1.\nLet f:{0,1}m→ℤp:𝑓→superscript01𝑚subscriptℤ𝑝f\\colon\\{0,1\\}^{m}\\to{\\mathbb{Z}}_{p} be a function over ℤpsubscriptℤ𝑝{\\mathbb{Z}}_{p} of arity m𝑚m.\nConsistent with previous notation, for J⊆[m]𝐽delimited-[]𝑚J\\subseteq[m] and 𝒂=(aj)j∈J¯∈{0,1}J¯𝒂subscriptsubscript𝑎𝑗𝑗¯𝐽superscript01¯𝐽\\boldsymbol{a}=(a_{j})_{j\\in\\overline{J}}\\in\\{0,1\\}^{\\overline{J}}, we write fJ|𝒂subscript𝑓conditional𝐽𝒂f_{J|\\boldsymbol{a}} to denote the restriction of f𝑓f to J𝐽J using 𝒂𝒂\\boldsymbol{a}. Let q​(𝒙)=q​(x1,…,xm)𝑞𝒙𝑞subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑚q(\\boldsymbol{x})=q(x_{1},\\dots,x_{m}) denote the unique multilinear polynomial over ℤpsubscriptℤ𝑝{\\mathbb{Z}}_{p} representing f𝑓f.\nWe write the polynomial as for appropriate numbers q^​(S)∈ℤp^𝑞𝑆subscriptℤ𝑝\\widehat{q}(S)\\in{\\mathbb{Z}}_{p} for every S⊆[m]𝑆delimited-[]𝑚S\\subseteq[m].\nWe also use qJ|𝒂subscript𝑞conditional𝐽𝒂q_{J|\\boldsymbol{a}} to denote the polynomial with variables (xj)j∈Jsubscriptsubscript𝑥𝑗𝑗𝐽(x_{j})_{j\\in J} obtained from restricting q𝑞q to J𝐽J using 𝒂𝒂\\boldsymbol{a}.\nObserve that qJ|𝒂subscript𝑞conditional𝐽𝒂q_{J|\\boldsymbol{a}} is the unique multilinear representation of fJ|𝒂subscript𝑓conditional𝐽𝒂f_{J|\\boldsymbol{a}}. Let 𝒙J≔(xj)j∈J≔subscript𝒙𝐽subscriptsubscript𝑥𝑗𝑗𝐽\\boldsymbol{x}_{J}\\coloneqq(x_{j})_{j\\in J} and suppose we write Then for all S⊆J𝑆𝐽S\\subseteq J (cf. Equation (5)). Let p𝑝p be a prime number and suppose k=pℓ𝑘superscript𝑝ℓk=p^{\\ell} for some integer ℓ≥1ℓ1\\ell\\geq 1.\nAlso suppose ΦΦ\\Phi is a graph property on k𝑘k-vertex graphs that is monotone and not k𝑘k-trivial. Then there is some k𝑘k-vertex graph H𝐻H such that Φ^​(H)≠0modp^Φ𝐻modulo0𝑝\\widehat{\\Phi}(H)\\neq 0\\bmod p and the complete bipartite graph Kpℓ−1,pℓ−1subscript𝐾superscript𝑝ℓ1superscript𝑝ℓ1K_{p^{\\ell-1},p^{\\ell-1}} is a subgraph of H𝐻H. For i∈{0,…,ℓ}𝑖0…ℓi\\in\\{0,\\dots,\\ell\\} we define an equivalence relation ∼isubscriptsimilar-to𝑖\\sim_{i} on [k]delimited-[]𝑘[k] via Also, we set Fisubscript𝐹𝑖F_{i} to be the graph with vertex set V​(Fi)≔[k]≔𝑉subscript𝐹𝑖delimited-[]𝑘V(F_{i})\\coloneqq[k] and edge set E​(Fi)≔{a​b∣a≠b∧a∼ib}≔𝐸subscript𝐹𝑖conditional-set𝑎𝑏𝑎𝑏𝑎subscriptsimilar-to𝑖𝑏E(F_{i})\\coloneqq\\{ab\\mid a\\neq b\\wedge a\\sim_{i}b\\}.\nNote that Fisubscript𝐹𝑖F_{i} is a disjoint union of pℓ−isuperscript𝑝ℓ𝑖p^{\\ell-i} many complete graphs of size pisuperscript𝑝𝑖p^{i}.\nMoreover, Since ΦΦ\\Phi is monotone and not k𝑘k-trivial, there is some i∗∈{0,…,ℓ−1}superscript𝑖0…ℓ1i^{*}\\in\\{0,\\dots,\\ell-1\\} such that Φ​(Fi)=1Φsubscript𝐹𝑖1\\Phi(F_{i})=1 for all i≤i∗𝑖superscript𝑖i\\leq i^{*}, and Φ​(Fi)=0Φsubscript𝐹𝑖0\\Phi(F_{i})=0 for all i>i∗𝑖superscript𝑖i>i^{*}. We define H0≔Fi∗≔subscript𝐻0subscript𝐹superscript𝑖H_{0}\\coloneqq F_{i^{*}} and define a second sequence of graphs (see also Figure 1).\nWe partition the set [k]delimited-[]𝑘[k] into p𝑝p intervals A1,…,Apsubscript𝐴1…subscript𝐴𝑝A_{1},\\dots,A_{p} of size pℓ−1superscript𝑝ℓ1p^{\\ell-1} each, i.e., Also, fix an arbitrary order {e1,…,em}={v​w∣v≠w∈[p]}=([p]2)subscript𝑒1…subscript𝑒𝑚conditional-set𝑣𝑤𝑣𝑤delimited-[]𝑝binomialdelimited-[]𝑝2\\{e_{1},\\dots,e_{m}\\}=\\{vw\\mid v\\neq w\\in[p]\\}=\\binom{[p]}{2} on the two-elements subsets of [p]delimited-[]𝑝[p], and define Mj≔{e1,…,ej}≔subscript𝑀𝑗subscript𝑒1…subscript𝑒𝑗M_{j}\\coloneqq\\{e_{1},\\dots,e_{j}\\} for all j∈[p]𝑗delimited-[]𝑝j\\in[p].\nWe define the graph Hjsubscript𝐻𝑗H_{j} with vertex set V​(Hj)=[k]𝑉subscript𝐻𝑗delimited-[]𝑘V(H_{j})=[k] and edge set Observe that Also Φ​(H0)=1Φsubscript𝐻01\\Phi(H_{0})=1 and Φ​(Hp)=0Φsubscript𝐻𝑝0\\Phi(H_{p})=0 since Hpsubscript𝐻𝑝H_{p} contains a subgraph isomorphic to Fi∗+1subscript𝐹superscript𝑖1F_{i^{*}+1}.\nSo there is some j∗∈{0,…,p−1}superscript𝑗0…𝑝1j^{*}\\in\\{0,\\dots,p-1\\} such that Φ​(Hj)=1Φsubscript𝐻𝑗1\\Phi(H_{j})=1 for all j≤j∗𝑗superscript𝑗j\\leq j^{*}, and Φ​(Hj)=0Φsubscript𝐻𝑗0\\Phi(H_{j})=0 for all j>j∗𝑗superscript𝑗j>j^{*}.\nLet us set H∗≔Hj∗≔superscript𝐻subscript𝐻superscript𝑗H^{*}\\coloneqq H_{j^{*}} and V≔Av≔𝑉subscript𝐴𝑣V\\coloneqq A_{v} and W≔Aw≔𝑊subscript𝐴𝑤W\\coloneqq A_{w} where v​w=ej∗𝑣𝑤subscript𝑒superscript𝑗vw=e_{j^{*}}. For every i∈[p]𝑖delimited-[]𝑝i\\in[p] and every s,s′∈Ai𝑠superscript𝑠′subscript𝐴𝑖s,s^{\\prime}\\in A_{i} there is an automorphism σ∈Aut⁡(H∗)𝜎Autsuperscript𝐻\\sigma\\in\\operatorname{Aut}(H^{*}) such that σ​(s)=s′𝜎𝑠superscript𝑠′\\sigma(s)=s^{\\prime} and σ​(t)=t𝜎𝑡𝑡\\sigma(t)=t for all t∈[k]∖Ai𝑡delimited-[]𝑘subscript𝐴𝑖t\\in[k]\\setminus A_{i}. This follows immediately from observing that H∗​[Ai]superscript𝐻delimited-[]subscript𝐴𝑖H^{*}[A_{i}] is a disjoint union of complete graphs of the same size, and every s,s′∈Ai𝑠superscript𝑠′subscript𝐴𝑖s,s^{\\prime}\\in A_{i} have the same neighbors outside of Aisubscript𝐴𝑖A_{i} in H∗superscript𝐻H^{*}.\n∎ Now, consider the polynomial qΦ​(𝒙)subscript𝑞Φ𝒙q_{\\Phi}(\\boldsymbol{x}) defined over ℤpsubscriptℤ𝑝{\\mathbb{Z}}_{p} where 𝒙=(xe)e∈E​(Kk)𝒙subscriptsubscript𝑥𝑒𝑒𝐸subscript𝐾𝑘\\boldsymbol{x}=(x_{e})_{e\\in E(K_{k})}, and also let f:{0,1}E​(K)→ℤp:𝑓→superscript01𝐸𝐾subscriptℤ𝑝f\\colon\\{0,1\\}^{E(K)}\\to{\\mathbb{Z}}_{p} be the function represented by qΦsubscript𝑞Φq_{\\Phi}.\nLet and J¯≔E​(Kk)∖J≔¯𝐽𝐸subscript𝐾𝑘𝐽\\overline{J}\\coloneqq E(K_{k})\\setminus J.\nLet 𝒂=(ae)e∈J¯∈{0,1}J¯𝒂subscriptsubscript𝑎𝑒𝑒¯𝐽superscript01¯𝐽\\boldsymbol{a}=(a_{e})_{e\\in\\overline{J}}\\in\\{0,1\\}^{\\overline{J}} be the tuple defined via Now, consider the polynomial q∗=(qΦ)J|𝒂superscript𝑞subscriptsubscript𝑞Φconditional𝐽𝒂q^{*}=(q_{\\Phi})_{J|\\boldsymbol{a}} and the function f∗:{0,1}J→ℤp:superscript𝑓→superscript01𝐽subscriptℤ𝑝f^{*}\\colon\\{0,1\\}^{J}\\to{\\mathbb{Z}}_{p} represented by q∗superscript𝑞q^{*}.
