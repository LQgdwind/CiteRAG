      "content": "Paper Title: Length-Controllable Image Captioning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImage captioning is one of the fundamental problems of computer vision which aims to generate natural language captions for images automatically. It requires not only to recognize salient objects in an image and understand their interactions, but also to describe them using natural language, which is very challenging. Most image captioning methods adopt an Encoder-Decoder framework¬†  , where the encoder, e.g., a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), first extracts features from the input image. An image caption is then decoded from the image features, one token at each time, typically using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).\nFollowing this, many works [ref]20   achieve the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the challenging MS COCO dataset¬†[ref]8, and even outperform human performance on some evaluation metrics. Despite their remarkable performance, many advanced image captioning approaches lack the ability to control its predictions, i.e., they cannot change the way they describe an image.\nSee the example in Fig.¬†1, given an input image, although the caption generated by VLP¬† (a current SOTA) correctly describes the image, it also omits some informative visual concepts, such as ‚Äúcheese‚Äù and ‚Äútomatoes‚Äù.\nIf we want a more detailed description, this result would be unsatisfactory.\nTherefore, it is desired for the image captioning task if a model can be controlled to describe the image either roughly or in detail.\nIn this paper, we show that such an ability can be effectively acquired by directly controlling the length of the image captions. Length is an important property of natural language since it reflects the amount of information carried by a sentence.\nAs shown in Fig.¬†1, a longer image caption can describe an image more accurately, as it generally has higher fidelity for the image information. On the other hand, a shorter image caption can be generated and delivered more efficiently in practice, but with some extent of information loss. Nevertheless, the length property has not been explicitly exploited by previous image captioning approaches. Our work fills this gap by proposing a length-controllable image captioning model.\nSpecifically, we introduce a concept of ‚Äúlength level‚Äù which refers to a specific length range of the image captions. During training, a length level embedding is learned for each level with the training data inside the length range. During inference, the image caption generation is separated into different levels, where each level is responsible for generating image captions within the corresponding length range, conditioned on the learned length level embedding. Technically, this length control signal is able to be used in many existing image captioning approaches. However, they may encounter a problem when generating long image captions because of their autoregressive nature (i.e., generate one token at a time conditioned on all preceding tokens): the computational complexity of autoregressive methods increase linearly as the length LùêøL of the predicted caption grows, i.e, a Œò‚Äã(L)Œòùêø{\\rm{\\Theta}}(L) complexity. To tackle this, we further develop a non-autoregressive model for length-controllable image captions based on the idea of iterative refinement¬†.\nOur non-autoregressive model is inherited from BERT¬†, with the input embedding layer modified to incorporate the image feature representations and the length level information. We name it as length-aware BERT (LaBERT).\nMoreover, we devise a non-autoregressive decoding algorithm for LaBERT to make it be able to decode image captions within a fixed number of refine steps regardless of LùêøL, i.e., a length-irrelevant complexity. In our experiments, we first evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed length-controllable image captioning scheme by applying it to two most recently SOTA autoregressive image captioning methods, i.e., AoANet¬†[ref]20, which employs an LSTM¬†7 as the decoder, and VLP¬†, which adopts a Transformer-based decoder. After incorporating the length information, these two methods successfully generate high-quality and length-controllable image captions. Specifically, on the challenging MS COCO dataset, our length-aware models not only outperform their original version in terms of CIDEr-D¬† score on a normal length level (10 to 14 tokens), but also achieve remarkable SPICE¬† scores (23.0) on longer length levels (at least 14 tokens). Afterwards, we evaluate the length level control signal on our proposed non-autoregressive image captioning model, LaBERT, which achieves competitive or even better performance compared with the two autoregressive baselines on all length levels, while also significantly improves the decoding efficiency for long captions. More importantly, we find that the proposed LaBERT has a better control precision than the two autoregressive models, and is also able to generate much more diverse image captions. In summary, the main contributions of this paper are threefold: We firstly introduce the design of ‚Äúlength level‚Äù as a control signal to learn length-aware image captioning models, which can be easily integrated into existing image captioning approaches to make them capable of generating high-quality and length-controllable image captions. We devise a non-autoregressive decoder for length-controllable image captioning, which makes the decoding of long captions more efficiency. Moreover, it achieves higher control precision and produces more diverse results than the autoregressive baselines. We perform extensive experiments on different kinds of image captioning models, whether they are autoregressive or non-autoregressive, and whether they use LSTM-based decoder or Transformer-based decoder, to show the effectiveness of our proposed method.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: extracts features from the input image.
