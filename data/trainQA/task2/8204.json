      "content": "Paper Title: Balancing Pareto Front exploration of Non-dominated Tournament Genetic Algorithm (B-NTGA) in solving multi-objective NP-hard problems with constraints\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the paper, two real-world combinatorial practical NP-hard problems are investigated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed Balanced Non-dominated Tournament Genetic Algorithm (B-NTGA) ‚Äì Multi-Skill Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (MS-RCPSP) [ref]27  and Travelling Thief Problem (TTP) . Both are NP-hard, constrained, combinatorial, and require multi-objective optimization. Moreover, each of the above problems combine multiple subproblems (i.e., allocation, scheduling), and both subproblems have objectives that are interwoven, and finding an optimal solution for them does not provide the optimal solution to the whole problem. This specifically makes problems closer to applications of real-world requirements. In multi- and many-objective optimization MS-RCPSP final schedule is evaluated by cost and duration. The MS-RCPSP is a real-world many-objective practical problem and belongs to the class of strongly NP-hard problems  with combinatorial solution space. The primary goal is to assign given tasks to limited resources and then place them on a timeline. Additional challenge comes with a set of constraints connected to skill requirements, their availability, and tasks‚Äô precedence relation. The schedule is evaluated across up to 5 objectives : cost, duration, average cash flow, skill overuse, and average use of resources. It also consists of task-to-resource assignments and time-slot assignments. It does not represent all the aspects of real-world project scheduling but provides a good approximation of a number of challenges.\nThe Travelling Thief Problem (TTP)  problem was initially defined in 2013, and its practical and interesting character makes it highly popular ‚Äì GoogleScholar returns hundreds of papers as a result. The TTP problem connects two well-known problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Knapsack Problem (KNP). The multi-objective TTP solution must satisfy constraints (e.g., the capacity of knapsack) and combines two well-known NP-hard problems with interconnected objectives ‚Äì TSP and KNP.\nIt is worth mentioning that both (TTP and MS-RCPSP) multi-objective optimization problems are NP-hard, constrained, and real-world. That means a large solution landscape cannot be searched algorithmically (only a meta-heuristic could be effective), and some solutions are infeasible (as it breaks some constraints and cannot be used in practice). We even do not know the ‚Äùbest‚Äù solution; because of the size of the solution landscape and the multi-objective character of the problem where the domination relation exists between solutions. In this situation, we can only explore the solution landscape to build a Pareto Front approximation (PFa) (includes all found non-dominated solutions) and compare the results of the studied methods. That makes solving problem(s) particularly demanding but also challenging and valuable for real-world applications. TTP and MS-RCPSP problems are recent real-world problems, and some solving methods are presented in the literature. Some of them could be listed as follows.\nIn work , a hybridized Ant Colony Optimisation has been applied to solve MS-RCPSP as a single objective optimization problem (as a weighted sum of objectives). Also, Differential Evolution in  is applied to solve the MS-RCPSP problem effectively. Other metaheuristics are used like Knowledge-Based Fruit Fly Optimisation or Teaching-Learning Optimisation 0 or Genetic Programming Hyper-heuristic . Some methods solve the MS-RCPSP problem as a bi-objective problem, for example, Non-Dominated Tournament Genetic Algorithm 2 (NTGA2) , multi-objective Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm  or decomposition-based multi-objective genetic program. Also, hyper-heuristics  is used to solve MS-RCPSP as a multi-objective problem. To our best knowledge, only two publications (e.g.) present methods that solve many-objective MS-RCPSP using 5-objectivities. In  as reference method applied to MS-RCPSP are: U-NSGA-III, Œ∏ùúÉ\\theta-DEA and NTGA2. Results show that NTGA2 is the most effective and scalable method.\nThe latest survey of referenced methods applied to MS-RCPSP is presented in , and as problem MS-RCPSP is wider scheduling context presented in surveys, e.g. . This paper presents a Balanced Non-dominated Tournament Genetic Algorithm (B-NTGA) method that bases of NTGA2 in the context of a successful application to MS-RCPSP and TTP. The main NTGA2 advantage is a GAP selection that provides NTGA2 with the opportunity to examine the ‚Äúlow density‚Äú regions of PFa during the evolution ‚Äì motivation for this strategy is that we get more ‚Äúdense‚Äù PFa and potentially better not dominated points. Such a strategy uses phenotype distance between individuals to improve the evolution process. Some of the introduced mechanisms maintained the original concept, just to mention a few - Niching, Speciation or Crowding Distance focuses on distances in solution space. Moreover, hybrid selection operators  in the literature link decomposition, domination, and indicator-based approach to effectively solve multi- and many-objective optimization problems. The operator GAP  works similarly and focuses on ‚Äúgaps‚Äù in PFa. The main novelty of the proposed B-NTGA is inspired by the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) formula which is not a standard element of evolutionary computation. It makes the backbone of the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to support a balance between exploring the search space and exploiting promising solutions, commonly used in game-playing and robotics. Authors of The Monte Carlo Elites  applied the UCB formula to balance the search in the behavior space ‚Äì solutions mapped to another space based on their behavior - e.g. angular velocity in robotics design.\nIn this paper, we incorporated the idea into the objective space to balance the PF selection, yet the biggest novelty is combining it with the density metric in a single formula. The density metric (such as Crowding Distance mentioned before) is commonly used to promote the exploration of search space with lower solution density. However, the standard static approach promotes the same regions until density changes - which might never happen due to natural constraints of the search space. Our proposed approach - the balanced GAP selection operator (which is density-based) promotes the least explored regions of PF while taking into account the frequency of their selection. The proposed B-NTGA actively uses archive and extends these mechanisms due to the frequency of PFa probing and allows to focus on less explored regions but depending on the already used ‚Äúbudget‚Äù in a given region. B-NTGA is investigated to examine how effective balanced GAP selection determines potential GAP improvement. We propose B-NTGA to make exploration/exploitation more balanced (as some Pareto fronts regions are selected too often), adapted (boundary points monopolize selection), and dynamic (selection uses ‚Äúbudget‚Äù in each generation to reduce exploration already probed regions). The main contribution of this paper is proposed B-NTGA that actively uses archive to explore/exploit current PFa ‚Äì some regions are dense, some have low density including ‚Äùgaps‚Äù. The B-NTGA searches such regions, focusing on ‚Äùgaps‚Äù, the biggest potential to find new non-dominated solutions. The novelty of B-NTGA is that the method actively uses archive and remembers regions visited too often in the evolution process ‚Äì then it reduces exploration in such regions in following generations. Thus, B-NTGA balances on searching potentially interesting PFa regions (many ‚Äùgaps‚Äù) but also reduces exploration of such regions if there are no results, i.e., new non-dominated solution. Such a mechanism is very useful, particularly in searching solution space with many constraints ‚Äì as a potential interesting ‚Äùgap‚Äù in PFa could include only infeasible solutions (i.e. some constraints are not met), and exploration of such solution search space is meaningless and time-consuming. B-NTGA reducing selection pressure in that situation selects other regions in the evolution process. Therefore, such a mechanism allows B-NTGA to be more efficient. Also, B-NTGA basing NTGA2 could reduce some elements (e.g., clone reduction, tournament selection as second selection); Thus, B-NTGA is less time-consuming, uses fewer parameters, and is more efficient than NTGA2 and investigated state-of-the-art methods. Results of experiments showed that the proposed B-NTGA, in comparison to state-of-the-art methods, is highly effective for multi-objective optimization problems (like TTP and MS-RCPSP) and many-objective MS-RCPSP, where 5-objectives are used in optimization. The rest of the article is structured as follows. In section 2 a short related work is given. The investigated MS-RCPSP and TTP problems are shortly defined in section 3. Motivation and proposed approach are given in section 4. Section 5 includes experimental results of proposed B-NTGA multi- and many-objective optimization.
