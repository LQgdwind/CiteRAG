      "content": "Paper Title: BELLATREX: Building Explanations through a LocaLly AccuraTe Rule EXtractor\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRandom forest  (RF) is a computationally efficient ML method that delivers excellent predictive performance, and since its appearance, RFs have been extremely successful in performing classification and regression tasks. Moreover, RFs have been extended to a variety of other learning tasks, including multi-label classification  and survival analysis .\nMost of the extensions that have been proposed over the years are associated with the node splitting mechanism as well as the prototype function (i.e., the function that provides predictions in the leaves), while less modifications have been proposed for other RF characteristics, such as the bootstrapping.\n A common splitting criterion for RFs in binary classification is the Gini impurity index, whereas a common prototype function returns the most frequent class label among training instances falling in the leaf. For single-output regression tasks, the splitting rule that maximally reduces within-node variance in the target values is usually chosen, and the average target value is returned as prediction. In multi-label classification, a single instance may belong to multiple classes and, hence, the task is to predict the correct subset of class labels for each instance. Multi-label classification has many applications, including text classification, image annotation, protein function prediction, etc. Several machine learning methods have been adapted to multi-label classification, including random forests  [ref]27. In order to take into account the multiple labels, the splitting criterion is adapted by maximising either the average impurity reduction [ref]27 or average variance reduction , across all the (binary) labels. These criteria implicitly take into account label dependence and are often preferred to methods that train output labels independently . In both cases, the leaves return a vector, where each component represents the proportion of instances annotated with the corresponding label. Similarly, RF have been adapted to multi-target regression tasks, where multiple continuous targets are predicted at once. In this case, the reduction in within-node variance is computed for all targets and the average is taken. Survival analysis is a branch of statistics that has only recently been explored in the machine learning community . The goal of such analysis is to predict the time until an event occurs (hence, this task is also known as time-to-event prediction). Applications include clinical studies, where the outcome of interest is the time until a patient dies, suffers from complications, is discharged from hospital, etc. A key challenge in this field is the so called censoring effect, that is when the exact time of the event is not observed, resulting in partial information. For instance, in the case of right censoring, which is the type of censoring included in our study, the recorded event time is an underestimate of the true time. This may for instance occur when a patient drops out from the study or has not reached the outcome event before the study ends. Decision trees and random forests (as well as other machine learning methods) have been adapted to survival data, they are called (Decision) Survival Trees  and Random Survival Forests (RSF) , respectively. The main splitting criterion being used is the logrank score , a criterion that guarantees good generalisation for censored time-to-event data .\nThis criterion aims at splitting the population in maximally different subgroups with maximally different hazard functions. At each leaf node, a Kaplan-Meyer  estimate of the survival function for the population that falls in that node is built.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: including text classification, image annotation, protein function prediction, etc. Several machine learning methods have been adapted to multi-label classification, including random forests  [ref]27.
