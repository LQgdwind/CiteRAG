      "content": "Paper Title: Anomaly Rule Detection in Sequence Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPattern mining is one of the key processes of data mining and knowledge discovering. In the field of pattern mining, frequent itemset mining (FIM)   and sequential pattern mining (SPM)    are the two common tasks to automatically determine whether a pattern (e.g., itemset, rule, sequence) is frequent or not. Note that a pattern in FIM or SPM is purely based on the number of its occurrences. In the past decades, FIM has been extensively studied, such as Apriori  and FP-growth . While SPM aims at finding those frequently occurring sequential patterns in a sequence database which is different from transaction database. The records in a sequence database have the key characteristic information w.r.t. timestamp, and they often contain a set of subsequences of events that usually have a chronological order. There are many real-life sequence data [ref]24 , for example, the customer shopping records, biological sequences, and video session records. Up until now, a lot of SPM algorithms have been proposed, such as GSP , SPADE , and PrefixSpan , MSPIC-DBV . The well-known PrefixSpan adopts a prefix-projection method to discover sequential patterns. In addition, sequential rule mining (SRM)   is different from SPM although both of them aim at dealing with symbolic sequence datasets. The discovered rules in SRM not only have rich underlying sequential information, but also have a high confidence. Recently, utility-driven SPM [ref]30   and utility-driven SRM  also have been extensively studied. The fundamental problem of most pattern mining algorithms is the lack of data associated with rare cases. For example, rare patterns (e.g., itemsets, rules) tend to cover only a few records/instances. Obviously, the patterns that rarely occur in very few records will be normally pruned by pattern mining approaches. However, these infrequent patterns warrant special attention since they usually mean the anomaly and interesting. How to cater for these specific types of rare/anomaly pattern detection is a difficult task, especially when we consider the utility factor instead of frequency. To summary, these typical approaches can discover different kinds of frequent patterns, but they do not adequately capture outlier patterns.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: have the key characteristic information w.r.t. timestamp, and they often contain a set of subsequences of events that usually have a chronological order.
