Structured State Space Sequence models (S4) and their variants, such as Mamba, address the limitations of traditional recurrent neural networks in long sequence modeling by optimizing complexity and improving sequence processing speed,. Notably, SSMs implement autoregressive reasoning in a recursive manner while remaining parallel processing capabilities. This combination provides unique advantages in both efficiency and performance. The AVQA task involves long video sequences containing complex temporal dependencies and cross-modal content. Previous AVQA work,, uses Transformers as the underlying structure and achieves good results in local attention. However, the transformer is unable to model the content outside the window and suffers from secondary computation problems. Performance bottlenecks and computational resource limitations are encountered when processing long video sequences and performing cross-modal fusion. We consider using State Space Models (SSMs) for temporal modeling to provide more precise control over long-term dependencies and cross-modal interactions. Our model overcomes the challenge of capturing global information in long video content, offering a more effective way to simulate dynamic changes in video sequences and interactions between audio and video elements. In addition, to better integrate audio and video information, we introduce cross fusion blocks to enhance the interaction between the two modalities. This multimodal fusion not only helps in more accurate information retrieval, but further provides richer contextual information for complex question and answer tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: State Space Models (SSM) demonstrate their advantages in modeling long sequence data in tasks such as computer vision, natural language processing and video understanding[ref]29,0,1,,.
