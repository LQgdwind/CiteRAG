Core-periphery graph has been applied in a variety of fields, including social network analysis  , economics, biology such as modeling the structure of protein interaction networks. In the brain science field, it has been shown that brain dynamics has a core-periphery organization . The functional brain networks also demonstrate a core-periphery structure[ref]28. A recent study revealed the core-periphery characteristics of the human brain from a structural perspective . It is shown that gyri and sulci, two prominent cortical folding patterns, could cooperate as a core-periphery network which improves the efficiency of information transmission in the brain .\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: interaction networks.
