      "content": "Paper Title: Diversity Enhanced Active Learning with Strictly Proper Scoring Rules\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of BEMPS via evaluating the performance of CoreMSE and CoreLog\nas its two examples on various benchmark datasets for text classification.\nThese two acquisition functions were compared with recent techniques for AL. Datasets\nWe used four benchmark text datasets for three different classification tasks: topic classification, sentence classification, and sentiment analysis, as shown in Table¬†1.\nThe AG NEWS for topic classification contains 120K texts of four balanced classes .\nThe PUBMED 20k was used for sentence classification [ref]3,\nwhich contains about 20K medical abstracts with five categories.\nThis dataset is imbalanced.\nFor sentiment analysis, we used both the SST-5 and the IMDB datasets.\nSST-5 contains 11K sentences extracted from movie reviews with five imbalanced sentiment labels ,\nand IMDB contains 50K movie reviews with two balanced classes . Baselines\nWe considered Max-Entropy , BALD , MOCU 2, WMOCU 2, BADGE [ref]1 and ALPS  together with a random baseline.\nMax-Entropy and BALD are earlier uncertainty-based methods.\nMOCU, WMOCU, BADGE and ALPS are the four recent AL methods.\nFollowing their originally published algorithms,\nwe re-implemented them for text classification tasks, with the same backbone classifier for fair comparisons.\nNote that the hypothetical labels used in BADGE were computed with ensembles.\n Experiment setup\nWe used a small and fast pretrained language model,\nDistilBERT  as the backbone classifier\nin our experiments.\nWe fine-tuned DistilBERT on each dataset after each AL iteration with a random re-initialization ,\nproven to improve the model performance over the use of incremental fine-tuning with the newly acquired samples .\nThe maximum sequence length was set to 128, and a maximum of 30 epochs was used in fine-tuning DistilBERT with early stopping .\nWe used AdamW  as the optimizer with learning rate 2e-5 and betas 0.9/0.999.\nMeanwhile, the initial training and validation split contain only 20 and 6 samples respectively. Each AL method was run for five times with different random number seeds on each\ndataset.\nThe batch size BùêµB\nwas set to {1, 5, 10, 50, 100}.\nTo compute the predictive distributions Pr(‚ãÖ\\nonscript|\\nonscriptL,x)\\operatorname{Pr}(\\cdot\\nonscript\\;|\\nonscript\\;L,x) and Pr(‚ãÖ\\nonscript|\\nonscriptL,(x,y),x‚Ä≤)\\operatorname{Pr}(\\cdot\\nonscript\\;|\\nonscript\\;L,(x,y),x^{\\prime}),\nwe borrowed the idea of deep ensembles ,\nwhere we trained five DistilBERTs with randomly generated\ntrain-validation splits (i.e., train/validation=70/30%70percent3070/30\\%)\nbased on an incrementally augmented labelled pool.\nThus each member of the ensemble has a different train/validation set, helping to diversify the ensemble.\nWe call this split process dynamic validation set (aka Dynamic VS).\nWith it,\nour implementation of CoreMSE and CoreLog does not rely on a separate large validation set. More detailed experimental settings are given in Appendix¬†B.\n \n\n\n\n# Unlabelled\nCoreMSE\nCoreLog\nMax-Ent\nBALD\nMOCU\nWMOCU\nBADGE\nALPS\nRand\n\n\n\n10k\n65\n65\n61\n61\n65\n65\n76\n62\n<1\n\n25k\n163\n163\n159\n159\n163\n163\n323\n283\n<1\n\n50k\n326\n326\n322\n322\n326\n327\n884\n573\n<1\n\n100k\n654\n654\n649\n650\n658\n659\n2904\n1299\n<1\n\n All experiments were run on 8 Tesla 16GB V100 GPUs.\nFor each AL method, we computed the average running time per one acquisition iteration\nas the total running time divided by the total number of iterations (i.e., 10).\nTable¬†2 summarizes as an example\nthe running times of all the AL methods on AG NEWS with unlabelled pools of different size.\nThe batch size BùêµB was set to 50, top fraction TùëáT to 50% and the size of X to 600.\nExcept for BADGE and the random baseline, the runtimes of the other methods increase nearly linearly\nwith the size of the unlabelled pool.\n Comparative performance metrics\nWe followed Ash et¬†al. [ref]1 to compute a pairwise comparison matrix\nbut use a counting-based algorithm ,\nas shown in the left of Figure¬†1.\nThe rows and columns of the matrix correspond to the AL methods used in our experiments.\nEach entry represents the outcome of the comparison between method iùëñi and method jùëój over all datasets (D).\nLet Ci,j,d=1subscriptùê∂ùëñùëóùëë1C_{i,j,d}=1 when method iùëñi beats method jùëój on dataset dùëëd,\nand 0 otherwise.\nEach cell value of the matrix is them computed as\nCi,j=‚àëdDCi,j,dsubscriptùê∂ùëñùëósuperscriptsubscriptùëëùê∑subscriptùê∂ùëñùëóùëëC_{i,j}=\\sum_{d}^{D}C_{i,j,d}.\nTo determine the value of Ci,j,dsubscriptùê∂ùëñùëóùëëC_{i,j,d},\nwe used a two-side paired tùë°t-test to compare their performance for 5 weighted\nF1 scores (or accuracy) at maximally spaced labelled sample sizes {li,j,d1,li,j,d2,‚Ä¶,li,j,d5}superscriptsubscriptùëôùëñùëóùëë1superscriptsubscriptùëôùëñùëóùëë2‚Ä¶superscriptsubscriptùëôùëñùëóùëë5\\{l_{i,j,d}^{1},l_{i,j,d}^{2},...,l_{i,j,d}^{5}\\}\nfrom the learning curve.\nWe compute the tùë°t-score as t=5‚ÄãŒº^/œÉ^ùë°5^ùúá^ùúét=\\sqrt{5}\\hat{\\mu}/\\hat{\\sigma}, where\nŒº^^ùúá\\hat{\\mu} and œÉ^^ùúé\\hat{\\sigma} are the usual sample mean and std.dev.\nIn Figure 1, we selected five samples at the different iterations according to the step size 50 in the experiment.
