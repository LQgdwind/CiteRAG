      "content": "Paper Title: Understanding in Artificial Intelligence\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this area of AI, there is a critical need for integrating different modes of reasoning (e.g. symbolic reasoning through deduction and statistical reasoning based on large amount of data), as well as benchmarks and evaluation metrics that can quantitatively measure research progress  . In recent years, there has been a surge of research activities in the NLP community to tackle commonsense reasoning and inference through ever-growing benchmark tasks. These tasks range from earlier textual entailment tasks, e.g. the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) Challenges , to more recent\ntasks that require a comprehensive understanding of everyday physical and social commonsense, e.g. the Story Cloze Test [ref]40 or SWAG . An increasing effort has been\ndevoted to extracting commonsense knowledge from existing data (e.g. Wikipedia) or acquiring it directly from crowd workers. Many learning and inference approaches have been developed for these benchmark tasks which range from earlier symbolic and statistical approaches to more recent neural approaches [ref]42. Many commonsense benchmarks are based upon classic language processing problems. The scope of these benchmark tasks ranges from more focused tasks, such as coreference resolution and named entity recognition, to more comprehensive tasks and applications, such as question answering and textual entailment. More focused tasks tend to be useful in creating component technology for NLP systems, building upon each other toward more comprehensive tasks. Meanwhile, rather than restricting tasks by the types of language processing skills required to perform them, a common characteristic of earlier benchmarks, recent benchmarks are more commonly geared toward particular types of commonsense knowledge and reasoning. Some benchmark tasks focus on singular commonsense reasoning processes, e.g., temporal reasoning, requiring a small amount of commonsense knowledge, while others focus on entire domains of knowledge, e.g., social psychology, thus requiring a larger set of related reasoning skills. Furthermore, some benchmarks include a more comprehensive mixture of everyday commonsense knowledge, demanding a more complete commonsense reasoning skill set [ref]42. Some of the commonsense inference benchmarks in NLP are as follow: TriviaQA : a corpus of webcrawled trivia and quiz-league websites together with evidence documents from the web. CommonsenseQA : consists of 9,000 crowdsourced multiple-choice questions with a focus on relations between entities that appear in ConceptNet. NarrativeQA : provides full novels and other long texts as evidence documents and contains approximately 30 crowdsourced questions per text. NewsQA : provides news texts with crowdsourced questions and answers, which are spans of the evidence documents. The Story cloze test and the ROC data set [ref]40: systems have to find the correct ending to a 5-sentence story, using different types of commonsense knowledge. SWAG : is a Natural Language Inference (NLI) data set of 113k highly varied grounded situations for commonsense application with a focus on difficult commonsense inferences. WikiSQL : is a corpus of 87,726 hand-annotated instances of natural language questions, SQL queries, and SQL tables. This data set was created as the benchmark data set for the table-based question answering task. Datasets for graph-based learning [ref]48: i) SDPDAG whose graphs are directed acyclic graphs (DAGs); ii) SDPDCG whose graphs are directed cyclic graphs\n(DCGs) that always contain cycles; iii) SDPSEQ whose graphs are essentially sequential lines. HotpotQA  and WorldTree : to provide explicit gold explanations that serve as training and evaluation instruments for multi-hop inference models. These data sets were created to overcome the existing limits on the length of inferences in traversing the knowledge graphs . Event2Mind : this corpus\nhas 25,000 narrations about everyday activities and situations, for which the best performing model is ConvNet . Winograd and Winograd NLI schema Challenge : Employs Winograd Schema questions that require the resolution of anaphora i.e. the model should identify the antecedent of an ambiguous pronoun. Common sense knowledge bases include: ConceptNet : contains over 21 million edges and 8 million nodes (1.5 million nodes in the partition for the English vocabulary), generating triples of the form (C​1𝐶1C1, r𝑟r, C​2𝐶2C2): the natural-language concepts C​1𝐶1C1 and C​2𝐶2C2 are associated by commonsense relation r𝑟r. WebChild : is a large collection of commonsense knowledge, automatically extracted from Web contents. WebChild contains triples that connect nouns with adjectives via fine-grained relations. The arguments of these assertions, nouns and adjectives, are disambiguated by mapping them onto their proper WordNet senses. Never Ending Language Learner (NELL) : is C.M.U.’s learning agent that actively learns relations from the web and keeps expanding its knowledge base 24/7 since 2010. It has about 80 million facts from the web with varying confidence. It continuously learns facts and also keeps improving its reading competence and thus learning accuracy. ATOMIC  is a new knowledge-base that focuses on procedural knowledge. Triples are of the form (Event, r𝑟r, {Effect—Persona—Mental-state}), where head and tail are short sentences or verb phrases and r𝑟r represents an if-then relation type. In terms of tackling the task of commonsense inference in NLP, some methods propose to explicitly incorporate commonsense knowledge, and more recent works focus on using pre-trained deep learning representations such as BERT or XLNet.  investigated a number of aspects of BERT’s commonsense representation abilities to provide a better understanding of the capability of these models. Their findings demonstrate that BERT is able to encode various commonsense features in its embedding space; and if there is deficiency in its representation, the issue can be solved by pre-training with additional data related to the deficient attributes.  follow a similar approach over the COIN 2019 shared task data, and they obtain the best performance for both tasks by relying on XLNet to get contextual representations. On the other hand, explicitly incorporating commonsense requires injecting knowledge into pre-trained deep learning models. Inspired by ,  proposed to convert concept-relation tokens into regular tokens, which are later used to generate a pseudo-sentence. Embeddings of the converted pseudo-sentences are concatenated with other representations for commonsense inference. Apart from reading comprehension, there are other commonsense inference tasks that are being used for evaluation. In the work of  the goal is to perform commonsense inference in human-robot communication. This is an important task because human-human communications often describe the expected change of state after an action, and the actions to achieve the change are not detailed. In their work a method to transform high-level result-verb commands into action-verb commands is implemented and evaluated. Because of the lack of manually annotated data, the proposed solution is a pipeline relying on WordNet, ngram frequencies, and a search engine to predict the mapping. Another relevant commonsense knowledge task is the prediction of event sequences. This has been addressed by relying on sequence-to-sequence models trained on annotated data, and data sets have been manually annotated for implementation and evaluation of these systems . Recent work on this task includes the use of conditional variational autoencoders for improved diversity, and the extension of original annotated data to cover multiple follow-up events . Semantic plausibility is another commonsense-related task that has been used as a test bed for analyzing knowledge representations. In , self-supervision is applied to learn from text via pre-trained models (BERT) and state-of-the-art performance is achieved without requiring manual annotations. Finally, recent research in this area has focused on physical properties of objects, and being able to make comparisons by applying commonsense reasoning. As an example of this task,  observe that probing pre-trained models (GloVe, ELMo, and BERT) can reliably perform physical comparisons between objects. In terms of graph-based commonsense inference, question answering in bAbI , Shortest path, and Natural Language Generation  are the tasks that have been modelled as a Sequence to Sequence learning (Seq2Seq) technique [ref]48 to tackle the challenge of achieving accurate conversion from graph to the appropriate sequence. To this end, a general end-to-end graph-to-sequence neural encoder-decoder model is proposed for mapping an input graph to a sequence of vectors using an attention-based LSTM method to decode the target sequence from these vectors [ref]48. Using the proposed bi-directional node embedding aggregation strategy, the model converges rapidly to the optimal performance and outperforms existing graph neural networks, Seq2Seq, and Tree2Seq models. Some graph-based approaches take a step further and try to answer complex questions requiring a combination of multiple facts, and identify why those answers are correct . Combining multiple facts to answer questions is often modeled as a multi-hop graph traversal problem, which suffers from semantic drift, or the tendency for chains of reasoning to drift to unrelated topics, and this semantic drift greatly limits the number of facts that can be combined in both free text or knowledge base inference. This issue is addressed by extracting large high-confidence multi-hop inference patterns, generated by abstracting large-scale explanatory structure from a corpus of detailed explanations. Given that, a prototype tool for identifying common inference patterns from corpora of semi-structured explanations has been released.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: e.g. the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) Challenges , to more recent\ntasks that require a comprehensive understanding of everyday physical and social commonsense, e.g. the Story Cloze Test [ref]40 or SWAG .
