      "content": "Paper Title: RSBNet: One-Shot Neural Architecture Search for A Backbone Network in Remote Sensing Image Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe earth observation and remote sensing technologies have made remarkable progress in the last few decades, which significantly increased the quantity of remote sensing image (RSI) and enable us to measure and observe the detailed structure of the earth’s surface with high resolution aerial images . Driven by many real-world applications such as urban planning, environment monitoring, and vegetation mapping , the interpretation of RSI has become an active research direction and raised increasing interests. Recently, the emergence of deep learning provides a promising approach to solving the RSI recognition tasks . As a typical and important model in deep learning community, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) construct an end-to-end feature extraction framework, which have achieved excellent performance in RSI recognition tasks, and have gradually become the mainstream methods in RSI interpretation field[ref]7. Generally speaking, CNN based methods for the task of RSI analysis contain two basic steps: feature extraction and recognition . The feature extractor in deep neural networks (DNNs) is also called backbone network in many literatures 0, which plays a significant role in various RSI recognition tasks. As shown in Fig.1, the potential of deep neural networks heavily depends on the representative abilities of the features extracted by backbones, and many breakthroughs in deep learning stem from their immediate modifications. For instance, a large classification accuracy increase could be obtained by simply replacing a VGG-16 1 backbone network with stronger networks, e.g., ResNet-50 or ResNet-101 2. There has been a long time that most promising backbone such as VGG 1, ResNet 2, MoblieNet 3 and SENet 4 are manually designed by the researchers with a high level of prior knowledge. As a black-box optimization task in a discrete search space, the design of neural architectures usually requires extensive computation and time cost, and may take many trials before achieving satisfied results. In addition, the handcrafted neural architectures are often task-dependent, which means the designed neural networks are difficult to adapt different distributions and different recognition tasks. Many excellent DNNs architecture are originally designed for natural image classification 5. However, the significant differences between RSI and natural images should be noticed. RSIs generally focus on the roof information of the ground objects which have different orientations, scales, and spatial distributions, whereas the natural images usually contain the profile information of the objects 0. Currently, many researches for RSI recognition directly employ the networks designed for natural image classification as backbones, which might be sub-optimal due the significant domain differences. Therefore, it is urgent to design special backbone architecture for different RSI recognition tasks. More recently, neural architecture search (NAS) methods have emerged in the community of automated machine learning (AutoML) 6, which aims to reduce the manual intervention of such architecture engineering, and have achieved promising results in various tasks such as image classification and segmentation. The goal of NAS methods is to automatically find the optimal architecture through choosing and combining various neuronal operations from a predefined search space. Nested optimization is usually adopted in early NAS approaches, where a massive number of candidate architectures are sampled from the search space using reinforcement learning (RL)7 or evolutionary algorithm (EA)8, and the network weights are then trained from scratch to validate the performance, leading to unaffordable computation cost (e.g., thousands of GPU days). Consequently, a lot of methods have been presented to reduce the computation cost and accelerate the search process. Gradient-based methods (e.g., DARTS 9) are developed in recent works, which construct an over-parameterized network that contains all candidate connections and introduce the attention mechanism on each candidate operation. Thus the discrete search space is transformed to be continuous and the architecture parameters can be optimized by gradient descent methods, which can significantly reduce the search cost while keeping competitive performance. Other NAS methods (e.g., ENAS 0) propose to introduce parameter sharing strategy to reduce the computation cost of architecture evaluation 1. As a recently developed paradigm based on weight sharing strategy, one-shot approaches have raised increasing interests due to the efficiency and flexibility 2. A supernet that contains all architectures is defined in one-shot search framework, and then the supernet is trained only once and share the network weights with its subnet. Therefore, the evaluation cost of subnet is more efficient and affordable on large datasets. Despite the remarkable performance of NAS in many image understanding tasks and the related research works are complicated and rich, most existing NAS methods are studied based on the task of natural image classification, few researches have investigated the performance of NAS in the RSI recognition tasks including scene classification, land-cover classification and object detection. In addition, most public RSI datasets contain insufficient labeled data and have some significant disadvantages, such as the few scene and object categories, and the low image diversity. Currently, various pretrained DNNs (e.g., VGG 1, GoogLeNet 3, ResNet 2) based on ImageNet 4 have been widely adopted in many RSI recognition tasks to address the issue of training data shortage, where the weights of feature extractor in different recognition tasks are initialized as the pretrained weights. However, a recent research 5 has demonstrated that pretraining-based paradigm might be sub-optimal to solve the problem of insufficient training data. Moreover, the training data from aerial sensors may exhibit complex geometrical structures compared with natural images, which affects the performance of pretrained model for RSI recognition. For image classification, the networks discovered by NAS methods reach or even surpass the performance of the hand-crafted networks. However, NAS for backbone networks in RSI recognition tasks is an open problem deserved to further research. In summary, there are three difficulties should be addressed: (1) optimization difficulty: A complete DNN architecture for recognition usually consists of backbone and classifier. The architecture search problem is deeply coupled during the optimization of other parameters since the NAS framework requires accuracies of candidate architecture on target task. (2) transfer difficulty: NAS system is dataset-specific and task-specific especially for remote sensing images, the searched backbone based on a single small scale dataset is difficult to adapt to different domain information and cannot be transferred to other recognition tasks. (3) optimization inefficiency: Considering the insufficiency of training data, each candidate architecture during search is generally pretrained on ImageNet and then fine-tuned on the target dataset to obtain precious evaluation, which is time-consuming and inefficient. In this paper, we focus on the performance bottlenecks of the manually designed backbone for the task of RSI recognition. We research a new design paradigm for the backbone architecture in the target recognition task. The main contributions of this paper are described as follows. We propose a novel one-shot backbone architecture search framework based on the weight-sharing strategy, where the training process and the search process are decoupled. Our framework consists of three stages: one-shot supernet pre-training, supernet fine-tuning and candidate backbone search based on evolutionary algorithm. We introduce an effective one-shot supernet training strategy, called ensemble single-path training. In each training step, a mini batch of single-path subnetworks are random sampled, the gradients of which are then calculated and accumulated to update the weights of supernet. This strategy accelerates and stabilizes the training process, and guarantees a much high correlation between the training and search stage. We design a switchable recognition module, which can flexibly adapt to different RSI recognition tasks. In the fine-tuning stage, the backbone network is separated from the pretrained supernet and equipped with different recognition head to form different recognition models, which aims to improve the performance of the supernet for the target task. We prove the effectiveness of RSBNet on three RSI recognition tasks, including scene classification, land-cover classification and object detection, based on five public benchmark datasets. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the searched backbones indicate better generalization ability compared with the manually designed backbones. The rest of this paper are divided into five sections. Section 2 presents a brief review to the related works including deep learning based RSI recognition methods and NAS methods. In 3 , we give a detailed description of our proposed RSBNet. Sections 4 and 5 deal with the experimental settings and the comparison results respectively.
