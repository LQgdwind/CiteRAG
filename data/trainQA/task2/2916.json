Early methods like NASNet  and AmoebaNet 4 focused solely on accuracy, producing SotA classification models  at the cost of GPU-years per search, with relatively large inference times. DARTS [ref]27 introduced a differential space for efficient search and reduced the training duration to days, followed by XNAS  and ASAP  that applied pruning-during-search techniques to further reduce it to hours. Predictor based methods\nrecently have been proposed based on training a\nmodel to predict the accuracy of an architecture just from an encoding of the\narchitecture. Popular choices for these models include Gaussian processes, neural networks, tree-based methods. See  for such utilization and \nfor comprehensive survey and comparisons. Interpretabe NAS was firstly introduced by  through a rather elaborated Bayesian optimisation with Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel to identify beneficial topological features. We propose an intuitive and simpler approach for NAS interpretibiliy for the efficient search space examined. This leads to more understanding and applicable design rules. Hardware-aware methods such as ProxylessNAS , Mnasnet , SPNASNet , FBNet , and TFNAS \ngenerate architectures that comply to the constraints by applying simple heuristics such as soft penalties on the loss function.\nOFA  and HardCoRe-NAS  proposed a scalable approach across multiple devices by training an one-shot model   once.\nThis pretrained super-network is highly predictive\nfor the accuracy ranking of extracted sub-networks, e.g. FairNAS 2, SPOS 2.\nOFA applies evolutionary search 4 over a complicated multilayer perceptron (MLP) 6 based accuracy predictor with many hyperparameters to be tuned.\nHardCore-NAS searches by backpropagation  over a supernetwork under strict latency constraints for several GPU hours per network.\nHence it requires access to a powerful GPU to perform the search and both approaches lack interpretability.\nThis work relies on such one-shot model, for intuitively building an interpretable and simple bilinear accuracy estimator that matches in performance without any tuning and optimized under strict latency constraints by solving an IQCQP problem in several CPU minutes following by a short fine-tuning.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: Early methods like NASNet  and AmoebaNet 4 focused solely on accuracy, producing SotA classification models  at the cost of GPU-years per search, with relatively large inference times.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
