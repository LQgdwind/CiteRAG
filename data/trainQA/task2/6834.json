      "content": "Paper Title: A Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Energy Efficient Federated Learning in Wireless Communication Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe Information and Communication Technology (ICT) industry represents an important energy consumer, utilizing 4% of the world’s\nelectricity . Progressing from 5G to Beyond 5G (B5G) and 6G networks, it becomes apparent that as the density of the network\ninfrastructure along with the number of connected devices exponentially increases, so does the energy demand. The ICT industry is expected to reach 10-20% of the world’s\nelectricity by 2030 ,. Many ambitious climate change activities are already taking place by the European Commission across the ICT industry, in line with the GSMA’s commitment towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2050  . In future wireless networks, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a key enabler has been recognized by both industry and academia [ref]6. Centralized AI approaches require a vast amount of data transfer to centrally located and energy hungry data centers, raising concerns with regard to both data privacy and energy consumption . Alternative solutions such as Federated Learning (FL) have surfaced, where devices perform a model training in a collaborative manner, exploiting locally stored datasets and avoiding any raw data transmissions. FL could be effectively deployed to numerous use cases and applications, where indicative examples include smart cities, smart transportation and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) [ref]8  0. Towards this direction, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) in Rel. 18, tries to adopt FL in Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) 1, with the introduction of the Model Training Logical Function (MTLF) in Rel. 17 that is responsible of training Machine Learning (ML) models and exposing new training services 2. Several critical challenges have been raised related to the application of FL to wireless networks, significantly affecting the overall energy consumption of the involved devices 3. Firstly, the model training process requires constant model update transmissions from the computing devices. Such model updates could consist of complex neural networks comprising millions or even billions of parameters. This implies a significant communication overhead, making the uplink transmissions particularly challenging. On the one hand, from the computing device perspective, transmitting a large volume of model updates periodically, imposes notable energy demands. On the other hand, the communication channel occupancy increases proportionally to the number of computing devices. The smooth operation of an FL process may be significantly impacted, particularly in the case of dynamic network environments with time-varying network conditions (e.g constantly changing channel conditions, fluctuations in traffic congestion). Secondly, ML model architectures require complex calculations, tightly related to the size of the ML model, resulting in even more challenges in terms of the energy aspect, since significant computational work will take place on device level during training. Another critical challenge of major importance includes computation and data heterogeneity across devices, in conjunction with strict ML model performance requirements. More specifically, critical services and applications often require stringent ML model performance 4, which is directly translated to higher training times and as a result to an increase in the overall energy consumption. Such deterioration could be accelerated in case of devices differing in both available resources and statistical data distribution. Taking into consideration the aforementioned challenges, it becomes apparent that new solutions are required to mitigate the environmental impact of FL in dynamic wireless communication networks, while guarantying a certain ML model performance. This could be achieved through the reduction of the energy consumption required to complete all the FL-related tasks. A number of state-of-the-art works focus on energy efficiency, by examining the problem in terms of resource orchestration, computation offloading or load balancing strategies (e.g. 5 6 7). However, only a limited number propose resource orchestration in run time (e.g. 8 9) and to the best of our knowledge only one work considers the complexity of an FL model architecture 0. In addition, none of the existing works propose a safe learning approach that will enhance the decision making by selecting strategies that respect the constraints of the environment. In parallel, there are no solutions considering the potentially prohibited energy cost that is required, while exploring for optimal resource orchestration strategies towards energy efficient FL processes. The current work targets the minimization of the overall energy consumption of an FL process in a wireless communication network, by orchestrating the computational and communication resources of the involved devices, while guaranteeing a certain FL model performance target. The FL model transmissions are taking place in a synchronized manner towards eliminating the effect of straggling devices. This synchronization is realized at the device level, so as to avoid unnecessary FL model transmissions due to time overdue, and as a result, contribute not only to the reduction of the overall energy consumption but also to the overall communication channel occupancy. Finally, in dynamic wireless communication networks, the heterogeneity characterizing both the devices and the data varies over time, hence up-to-date decisions should be made in a run-time manner. In order to achieve a run-time decision making, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solution, utilizing the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. SAC is known to achieve efficient learning, stability and robustness 1. A SAC agent is trained under different conditions of the environment in an offline phase, in order to produce a robust model that is used in a run-time inference phase, orchestrating the computational and communication resources of the devices that are involved in an FL process. The key contributions can be summarized as follows: We address the problem of FL energy efficiency in a wireless communication network, considering the model complexity, device and data heterogeneity, while guaranteeing a pre-selected FL performance target. We formulate a joint computation and transmission optimization problem aiming to minimize the total energy consumption of all devices involved in the FL process, while mitigating any wasted resource utilization. Considering dynamic environments, we propose a DRL solution utilizing the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm to solve the optimization problem in a run-time manner. By introducing a penalty function to the training phase, we highly contribute towards a safe RL process 2. We propose a device level synchronization in an attempt to eliminate unnecessary FL model transmissions, reducing energy consumption and communication overhead. In order to avoid any excessive energy costs for the training phase of SAC, we propose a computationally cost effective FL environment, emulating a real FL process. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II presents relevant state-of-the-art works. Section III provides the system model. Section IV provides the problem formulation. Section V describes the proposed solution that is evaluated in Section VII using the simulation setup of Section VI. Finally, section VIII concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: GSMA’s commitment towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2050  .
