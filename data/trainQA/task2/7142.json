      "content": "Paper Title: Refining Pre-Trained Motion Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGiven the difficulty of manually annotating motion in video, the current best motion estimation methods are trained with synthetic data [ref]1   [ref]4 [ref]5.\nThis synthetic training data is diverse, but highly unrealistic, forcing the methods to contend with a sim-to-real gap. Self-supervised (or “unsupervised”) models hold the promise of training directly on real video, yet currently lag behind the supervised counterparts. State-of-the-art self-supervised motion methods typically rely on warp error (i.e., color constancy) combined with smoothness terms   , and cycle-consistency (i.e., tracking backwards should yield the opposite trajectory as tracking forwards)    . In current experimental setups, fully-supervised versions are typically positioned in a league ahead, reflecting in some way an unfair advantage. This divide between supervised and unsupervised methods is purely academic; if synthetic supervision is available and helpful, it makes sense to use it. In this work, we take on the challenge of improving state-of-the-art supervised models with self-supervised training in an unabelled test domain.\nUnlike typical self-supervised or semi-supervised motion estimation approaches, which initialize a model from scratch, our setup is to take an\narbitrary pre-trained model off the shelf, and attempt to improve it for a given test domain, without access to any additional data.\nWe argue that this setup reflects a very practical use-case: a user notices some errors in the model’s output, and is willing to invest some GPU cycles into tuning up the results—provided that the tuning is effective.\n In this setup, the most straightforward solution is to directly optimize standard self-supervision objectives in the unlabelled data. We find that this reliably makes the pre-trained model perform even worse,\nsuggesting that the self-supervised training signals are too imprecise and noisy to provide useful gradients to an already well-optimized motion model. This observation is consistent with the fact that self-supervised models perform worse than supervised ones in general. Focusing on the problem of obtaining a “clean” training signal from real-world unlabelled video, we propose to separate label-making and training into two distinct stages. In the first stage, we use the pre-trained model to estimate motion in a video, and then select the subset of motion estimates which we can verify with cycle-consistency. This produces a sparse but accurate pseudo-labelling of the video. In the second stage, we fine-tune the model to reproduce these outputs, while also applying augmentations on the input. We complement this self-training method with simple techniques that densify and re-balance the pseudo-labels, ensuring that we do not merely train on \"easy\" tracks. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our method yields reliable gains over fully-supervised methods in real videos. Our experiments cover two types of motion models: optical flow (i.e., RAFT ), and long-term point tracking (i.e., PIPs ). We use standard benchmarks for the analysis: MPI-Sintel  for flow, and CroHD , Horse30 , and TAP-Vid-DAVIS  for point tracking. Despite starting from pre-trained state-of-the-art weights, our self-supervision framework produces consistent improvements in results. We hope that our technique, and our semi-supervised setup, will inspire future work into refining pre-trained motion models.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Given the difficulty of manually annotating motion in video, the current best motion estimation methods are trained with synthetic data [ref]1   [ref]4 [ref]5.\nThis synthetic training data is diverse, but highly unrealistic, forcing the methods to contend with a sim-to-real gap.
