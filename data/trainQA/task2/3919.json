      "content": "Paper Title: ReDFeat: Recoupling Detection and Description for Multimodal Feature Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFeature detection and description are fundamental steps in many computer vision tasks, such as visual localization  , Structure-from-Motion (SfM) , and Simultaneous-Localization-and-Mapping (SLAM) . Nowadays, increasing attention has been attracted onto the multimodal feature extraction and matching in special scenarios, such as autonomous drive and remote sensing, because different modalities provide complementary information . Although several modal-invariant features, e.g., OS-SIFT  and RIFT  emerge endlessly, the role SIFT  playing in visual image matching cannot be found for multimodal images. Therefore, it is imperative to study a more general and robust solution. Modeling invariance is the key to feature extraction . Benefiting from the great potential of Deep Neural Network (DNN), the features learned on big data dispense with heuristic designs to acquire invariance and significantly outperform their traditional counterparts on both visual-only 3  [ref]33   [ref]12   and cross-modal     images. Deep learning methods can be mainly divided into two categories: the two-stage and the one-stage frameworks. The efforts 3 [ref]33    belonging to the former category are based on the manual detector and then encode the patches centered at detected interest points with DNN. Undoubtedly, those descriptors are limited by the detected scale, orientation and so on. To fill the gap between the detection and the description, the one-stage pipeline  [ref]12    0     that learns to output dense detection scores and descriptors is proposed and further improvements are achieved. The joint framework seems alluring, however, its training would be unstable without a proper definition of detection. To address the problem, SuperPoint  generates synthetic corner data to give the detection clear supervision. A SIFT-like non-maximum suppression is performed on the final feature map in D2-Net [ref]12. R2D2  proposes a slack constraint, in which detection scores are encouraged to peak locally and repeat among various images so that more dense points can be detected. Furthermore, to increase the reliability of the detected features, the detection is always coupled with the description in the optimization. For example, D2-Net tries to suppress the detection scores of the descriptors that are not distinct enough to match. Similarly, R2D2 learns an extra reliability mask to filter out those points. Additionally, the probabilistic model introduced in ReinforcedPoint  and DISK  can be also seen as a coupling strategy that shares the same motivation with D2-Net and R2D2. Compared with the synthetic supervision and the non-maximum suppression, the constraints of local peaking and repeatability are more feasible for detection, because of their flexibility in the training and practical significance in the test. Based on these properties, the detection scores should be also linked to the probability of correctly matching of corresponding descriptors, i.e., the detection should be coupled with the description as mentioned above. However, the modal-invariant descriptors are always hard to learn and match. Naive suppression on the detected probability of those descriptors that are likely to be wrongly matched would fall into the local minimum where the detected probabilities are all zeros. Additionally, those hard descriptors are the key to gaining promotions, so simply ignoring them would not be a wise choice. Therefore, the coupling of detection and description should be more cautiously designed. In this paper, we firstly absorb the experience from related works and reformulate independent basic loss functions that are more effective and stable for multimodal feature learning, including a contrastive loss for description, a local peaking loss and a repeatability loss for detection. Different from the direct multiplication in previous efforts, we recouple the detection and the description in the mutual weighting strategy as briefly illustrated in Fig. 1. As for the detection, while an edge-based priori guides the detector to pay attention around edges, the detection scores of the reliable descriptors are further forced to peak by weighting the peaking loss with the matching risk of descriptors. Moreover, the repeatability loss is weighted by the similarity of corresponding descriptors. As for the description, the constrictive loss is weighted with the detection scores so that those descriptors with high detected probability are prioritized in the optimization. Note that, the weights in our recoupling strategy are ‘stopped gradients’, i.e., detached from back propagation, which makes the detection and the description would not be disturbed by the gradients of the weights. Finally, the features constrained by the recoupled detection and description loss functions, named ReDFeat, can be readily trained from scratch. Moreover, to fulfill those harsh terms of the detection, Super Detector is proposed. The prior probability that a point is a keypoint and the conditional probability that a keypoint is extracted from the image are modeled by a fully connected network and a deep convolutional network with a large receptive field, respectively. Particularly, the deep convolution network is equipped with learnable local non-maximum suppression layers to stick out the keypoints. Finally, the posterior detected probability that a detected point is a keypoint is computed by the multiplication of outputs from two networks. To evaluate the features systematically, we collect several kinds of cross-modal image pairs, including cross visible (VIS), near-infrared (NIR), infrared (IR) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and build a benchmark in which the performances of features are strictly evaluated. Extensive experiments on this benchmark confirm the applicability of our ReDFeat. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We recouple detection and description with the mutual weighting strategy, which can increase the training stability and performance of the learned cross-modal features. We propose Super Detector that possesses a large receptive field and learnable local non-maximum suppression blocks to improve the ability and the discreteness of the detection. We build a benchmark that contains three kinds of cross-modal image pairs for multimodal feature learning. Extensive experiments on the benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our method.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: Deep Neural Network (DNN), the features learned on big data dispense with heuristic designs to acquire invariance and significantly outperform their traditional counterparts on both visual-only 3  [ref]33   [ref]12   and cross-modal     images.
