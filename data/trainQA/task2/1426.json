      "content": "Paper Title: ORDisCo: Effective and Efficient Usage of Incremental Unlabeled Data for Semi-supervised Continual Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCurrent achievements of deep neural networks (DNNs) heavily rely on large amounts of supervised data, which are expensive and difficult to acquire simultaneously.\nTherefore, the ability of continual learning (CL) on incremental training samples becomes extremely important.\nNumerous efforts have been devoted to CL, which aim to continually learn new training samples without catastrophic forgetting of the learned data distribution [ref]29.\nExisting CL methods mainly fall in two categories: weight regularization methods [ref]29  [ref]1 and replay-based methods [ref]29  , and have achieved promising results in purely supervised settings. In many real-world applications, nevertheless, the incremental data are often partially labeled. For example, in face recognition [ref]33, a device continually obtains user data for unlocking.\nThese increasing data could be used to update the model for better user experience.\nHowever, true labels of the incoming data are usually unavailable unless the user provides the password for verification.\nSince frequently asking for labelling would affect user experience, most of the input data are unlabeled.\nSimilar scenarios occur in fingerprint identification  and video recognition .\nThough such scenarios are common in our daily life, they are seldom studied in the CL literature. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the challenging and realistic task that continually learns incremental partially labeled data. For simplicity, we refer to it as semi-supervised continual learning (SSCL). Different from supervised CL, SSCL provides insufficient supervision and a large amount of unlabeled data. As is well known, unlabeled data are crucial in semi-supervised scenarios  but are massive to exploit. In fact, we conduct preliminary experiments in SSCL and empirically verify that the representative CL methods including the weight regularization methods [ref]29  [ref]1 and the replay-based methods [ref]29   may not effectively exploit the unlabeled data.\nSpecifically, the joint training of a strong semi-supervised classifier significantly outperforms the best of existing CL strategies on the same classifier (see results in Fig. 1 and Appendix A). We identify this as the catastrophic forgetting of unlabeled data problem in SSCL. To this end, we present deep online replay with discriminator consistency (ORDisCo), a framework\nto continually learn a semi-supervised classifier and a conditional generative adversarial networks (GAN)  together in SSCL. Specifically, ORDisCo is formulated as a minimax adversarial game , where a generator tries to capture the underlying joint distribution of partially labeled data, and help the classifier make accurate predictions.\nAt the same time, the classifier also predicts pseudo-labels for unlabeled data to improve the training of the conditional generator.\nIn contrast to previous work   , ORDisCo replays data sampled from the conditional generator to the classifier in an online manner, which is time- and storage-efficient to exploit the large amount of unlabeled data in SSCL. Further, to explicitly overcome the catastrophic forgetting of unlabeled data, we selectively stabilize parameters of the discriminator that are important for discriminating the pairs of old unlabeled data and their pseudo-labels predicted by the classifier. We follow the New Instance and New Class scenarios of CL [ref]29 to split commonly used SSL benchmark datasets  , including SVHN, CIFAR10 and Tiny-ImageNet, as the evaluation benchmarks for SSCL. To simulate the practical scenarios, all methods continually receive a batch of data with a few labels during training. Extensive evaluations on such benchmarks show that ORDisCo can significantly outperform strong baselines in SSCL. In summary, our contributions include: (i) We consider a realistic yet challenging task called semi-supervised continue learning (SSCL). We provide a systematical study of existing CL strategies and show that the catastrophic forgetting of unlabeled data is the key challenge in SSCL.\n(ii) We present ORDisCo to continually learn a classifier and a conditional GAN in SSCL. The generator replays data in an online manner with a consistency regularization on the discriminator to address the catastrophic forgetting of unlabeled data; (iii) We evaluate ORDisCO on various benchmarks and demonstrate that ORDisCO significantly improves both classification and conditional image generation over strong baselines in SSCL.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: samples becomes extremely important.\nNumerous efforts have been devoted to CL, which aim to continually learn new training samples without catastrophic forgetting of the learned data distribution [ref]29.\nExisting CL methods mainly fall in two categories: weight regularization methods [ref]29  [ref]1 and replay-based methods [ref]29  , and have achieved promising results in purely supervised\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
