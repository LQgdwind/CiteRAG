      "content": "Paper Title: A Review on Computational Intelligence Techniques in Cloud and Edge Computing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nElina et al.  described a two-level cloud scheduler by using PSO, which operates under the IaaS model. They explored whether the use of a priority-based policy at the VM-level is suitable in an online cloud. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm offers a good balance between throughput and response time.\nGuo et al.  proposed a PSO algorithm by incorporating a small position value rule to minimize processing cost in CC. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms two other PSO-based algorithms in terms of convergence, processing time, and processing cost.\nMedhat et al.  presented an ACO algorithm for task scheduling in CC. At first, parameters with better values are determined for ACO through experiments. Then, ACO is evaluated on a set of instances with up to 1000 tasks.\nWang et al.  investigated MCC-assisted execution of a multi-task scheduling problem in a hybrid MCC architecture, and formulated it as an optimization problem with time constraints. Cooperative multi-task scheduling based on ACO is used to solve this optimization problem by considering task profit, task deadline, task dependence, node heterogeneity, and load balancing.\nZhang and Zhang  applied an ACO algorithm for load balancing in a complex network named ACCLB for CC. The purpose of this study is to cope with the dynamic load balancing problem in open CC federation. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs better than SearchMax-SearchMin and classic ACO in terms of minimizing standard deviation and gains a more suitable distribution of the workloads on the whole cloud federation.\nWei et al.  studied application scheduling in MCC with load balancing by using ACO. They presented a hybrid local mobile cloud model by extending the cloudlet architecture. The proposed model can select applications with the maximum profit and minimum energy consumption in a heavy load environment. Hesabian et al.  presented a scheduling method in CC based on BA to dedicate the sources optimally. The proposed method behaves like a load balancing BA for small-scale systems in terms of makespan, while outperforms it in large-scale systems. Walaa et al.  proposed a BA for load balancing in CC, which distributes workloads of multiple network links to avoid under utilization and over utilization of the resources. The proposed algorithm can minimize the response time and data center processing time by distributing workloads on different VMs based on the availability and load of each VM. It performs better than modified throttled and round robin algorithms in terms of average response time and execution time.\nSupacheep et al.  applied CSA for job scheduling in CC. They considered only static cases of job scheduling. The results of CSA are better than those of GA in most cases and it can find larger number of feasible solutions than GA.\nKansal and Chana  proposed an energy-aware VM migration technique based on FA for CC, which migrates the maximally loaded VM to the least loaded active node while maintaining the performance and energy efficiency of the data centers. This technique is compared with ACO-based and FFD-based techniques in the Cloudsim simulator.\nKaur and Sherma  applied FA to address workflow scheduling in CC, which reduces the execution time by efficient scheduling of workflow. The proposed FA performs better than other SIAs for workflow scheduling in terms of makespan. Verma et al.  proposed an improved BFA for scheduling tasks in CC. The performance of this algorithm is evaluated by using CloudSim toolkit. Experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms BFA and two other algorithms in terms of makespan, computation cost, and resource utilization.\nJacob et al. [ref]96 presented a BFA for resource scheduling in CC. In this work, a hyper-heuristic-based scheduling algorithm is used in the cloud system to map the resources in an efficient way. The proposed BFA reduces the cost and makespan and outperforms some existing algorithms like GA, ACO, a priority-based algorithm, and a Berger model-based algorithm. Bitam et al.  proposed a BA for job scheduling in FC, in which two factors are considered: the CPU execution time and the allocated memory required by the overall tasks. The reliability and efficiency of the proposed BA are evaluated by performing a set of tests. It is superior to GA and PSO in terms of allocated memory and execution time.\nNazir et al.  proposed a CSA for balancing load of users’ requests in residential areas in cloud-FC. The performance of CSA is compared with that of some existing techniques like round robin and throttled algorithms.\nPang et al.  designed an ACO algorithm to address dynamic energy management in cloud data center. They used Petri net for analyzing scheduling process, and then a task-oriented resource allocation method is proposed to optimize the running time and energy consumption of the system.\nLiu et al.  proposed an algorithm called OEMAC based on ACO to minimize energy for VM placement in CC. OEMAC minimizes the number of active servers. Experimental results show that OEMAC outperforms conventional heuristics and some other EAs in terms of saving energy, improving resource utilization, minimizing the number of active servers, and balancing different resources.\n\nReference markers found: [96]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]96: evaluated by using CloudSim toolkit. Experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms BFA and two other algorithms in terms of makespan, computation cost, and resource utilization.\nJacob et al. [ref]96 presented a BFA for resource scheduling in CC. In this work, a hyper-heuristic-based scheduling algorithm is used in the cloud system to map the resources in an efficient way.
