      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Explainable and Interpretable Multimodal Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has significantly transformed a wide array of fields.\nRecently one of the most influential advancements in AI is the development of large language models (LLMs), which exhibit remarkable language understanding and generating capabilities in a wide range of natural language tasks like text generation, translation, and conversational AI .\nSimilarly, advancements in computer vision (CV) have enabled systems to effectively process and interpret complex visual data, powering tasks like object detection, action recognition, and semantic segmentation with high precision .\nMore recently, the convergence of these technologies has spurred interest in multimodal AI, which seeks to integrate text, vision, audio, and video for a richer, more comprehensive understanding of multiple modalities [ref]3   [ref]6    0 1.\nMultimodal large language models (MLLMs) have experienced rapid advancements, driven by significant improvements in deep learning techniques 2 3 4 5 6 7.\nBy integrating diverse data sources, MLLMs demonstrate advanced understanding, reasoning, and generative capabilities across a wide range of multimodal tasks, including image-text generation 8 9 0, visual question answering 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8, cross-modal retrieval 9  , video understanding       .\nConsequently, MLLMs have found diverse applications across various domains  0 1, including natural language processing (NLP) 2 3, CV 4 5, video 6 5 7, autonomous driving 8 9 [ref]3, medicine 0 1 2, and robotics 3 4 5 6 7 8.\nHowever, as the complexity and scale of MLLMs grow, a critical challenge arises: deciphering the decision-making processes of MLLMs. [ref]6 9 . The field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become pivotal in making the decision-making processes of complex AI systems more transparent and accessible   .\nInterpretability and explainability are defined as the ability to explain or to present in human-understandable terms  .\nAlthough significant progress has been made in unimodal explainability and interpretability, such as in convolutional neural networks (CNN)   or transformers  for images and LLMs  for text, the multimodal domain presents unique challenges, such as the alignment and decomposition of different modalities.\nMoreover, the interpretability and explainability of MLLMs are essential for ensuring transparency and trustworthiness, especially in high-stakes applications where artificial intelligence decisions have a significant human impact, which addresses how disparate data types are combined within a model and how their interplay affects outputs.\nFollowing recent research  0 1, in this paper, we define interpretability in MLLMs refers to the internal structures that are inherently understandable, allowing for straightforward comprehension of how inputs are transformed into outputs.\nExplainability in MLLMs, on the other hand, involves post-hoc techniques that provide external analyses of model behavior behind a model’s decisions. In this paper, we present a new insight for categorizing the interpretability and explainability of MLLMs by integrating perspectives from data, model, training and inference.\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, we examine the interpretability and explainability of MLLMs from three perspectives: data (Section III), model (Section IV), training and inference (Section V).\nFollowing the data-driven explainability 2 3 4 5 research, we examine the data perspective (Section III), exploring how both input and output data can be attributed to the model’s decisions. We also analyze benchmarks and applications to evaluate the trustworthiness and reliability across various tasks, thereby ensuring the robustness and applicability in real-world scenarios 6 7.\nAs for the model interpretability and explainability 8 9 0 1 2 3 4, from the model perspective (Section IV), we conduct an in-depth analysis at the token level, embedding level, neuron level, layer level, and architectural level.\nAt the token level 5 6 7 8 9, we investigate the impact of individual tokens on model outputs and explore methodologies to enhance interpretability.\nAt the embedding level 0, we assess how multimodal embeddings influence the performance and interpretability of MLLMs, providing a deeper understanding of the underlying representation mechanisms.\nFor neuron-level 1 2 3, we analyze individual units and specialized groups of neurons to comprehend their contributions to overall model behavior.\nAt the layer level 8  4, we investigate how different layers affect decision-making processes within the model.\nRegarding architecture, we differentiate between architecture-analysis and architecture-design 5 6 7 8 approaches to interpretability, highlighting strategies that promote transparency and facilitate a better understanding of model operations.\nFurthermore, we explore training and inference strategies that enhance model transparency and explainability (Section V).\nIn the training phase 9, we summarize how various training mechanisms and weight adjustments impact the interpretability of MLLMs.\nWe discuss techniques aimed at improving alignment, reducing hallucinations, and promoting the acquisition of core knowledge and generalization capabilities in MLLMs. During inference, we investigate methods to mitigate issues such as hallucination without the need for retraining, including over-trust penalty mechanisms and chain-of-thought reasoning techniques. By integrating these perspectives 9 [ref]3 00, our survey offers a holistic understanding of the challenges and advancements in the interpretability and explainability of MLLMs. We believe this comprehensive analysis will serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners dedicated to developing more transparent, reliable, and trustworthy multimodal models.\nThe major contributions of this work are summarized as follows:\n We are the first to offer an in-depth and comprehensive review of existing research on the explainability and interpretability of MLLMs. We present a structured and comparative analysis of current methods for MLLMs explainability and interpretability, introducing a novel categorization that organizes these methods into data, model, training & inference perspectives. We highlight potential research directions that could advance the field, offering valuable guidance for researchers aiming to further develop explainability and interpretability approaches for MLLMs.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: convergence of these technologies has spurred interest in multimodal AI, which seeks to integrate text, vision, audio, and video for a richer, more comprehensive understanding of multiple modalities [ref]3   [ref]6    0 1.\nMultimodal large language models (MLLMs) have experienced rapid advancements, driven by significant improvements in deep learning techniques 2 3 4 5 6 7.\nBy integrating\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
