      "content": "Paper Title: IFSS-Net: Interactive Few-Shot Siamese Network for Faster Muscle Segmentation and Propagation in Volumetric Ultrasound\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur mask propagation problem is similar to that of Visual Object Tracking. After specifying a target on the first frame, the goal is to track its evolution in shape and position over the following images. The task is achieved by modeling the spatiotemporal coherence between consecutive frames. In Computer Vision, Siamese networks are a common tool for tracking. Composed of twin encoders sharing the architecture and weight parameters, they project the images fed to the two branches to a common feature space where their similarity can be evaluated. In this way, they are capable of learning similarities and identifying related regions among contiguous frames 6 . When confronted with videos, these methods track either a bounding box around the object 6, or a reference segmentation mask¬†. Siamese networks have also been successfully applied to medical images. Gomariz¬†et.al. formulated the problem of landmark tracking in liver-ultrasound sequences, relying on a Siamese network to find similar regions and a temporal consistency module as a location prior. Dunnhofer¬†et.al. used a Siamese for knee cartilage tracking in ultrasound images. Their model accepts as input a target image and a manual bounding box limiting the search area, and easing the segmentation task. Li¬†et.al. evaluate disease severity at single time points using medical image and modelled change over time between longitudinal patient visits on a continuous spectrum using Siamese network. Panteli¬†et.al. used Siamese for tracking and modelling the movement behaviour of biological cells in video sequences. We formulate our problem as a joint task of segmentation and propagation from reference masks and we avoid costly manual priors (i.e.¬†bounding boxes or landmarks). Our work builds upon the Siamese architecture PG-Net by Wug¬†et.al., which considers both the detection and propagation of a target object in motion. While PG-Net produces sharp masks, it leads to unsmooth temporal transitions, which limit its performance when applied to sequential ultrasound data. PG-Net considers only the spatial information within a 2D image before propagating over time with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). To enforce mask smoothness, we design a recurrence relationship that connects predictions over time, similar to Hu¬†et.al. and Perazzi¬†et.al.¬†. Such recurrence enables refining previous mask sub-volumes when making new predictions. Also, as in Khoreva¬†et.al.¬†, who consider future pixels, we model the muscle pixels in the past and future slices by integrating a Bidirectional Convolutional Long-Short-Term Memory (BiCLSTM) . With the recurrence relationships and the BiCLSTM module, we effectively enforce temporal smoothness while taking full advantage of the muscle changes along the volume. To reinforce the learning of the local deformation patterns in image space and time for sequences within each US sub-volume (instead of only spatial as in ), we introduce Atrous Separable Convolutions (ASC)¬† into our model. 3D ASC differs from the typical 3D convolutional operator by an adaptable dilation rate that adjusts the filter‚Äôs field-of-view. Thereby, 3D ASC captures contextual information at multiple scales. However, ASC may produce less sharp masks at the boundaries. Prior work has handled this issue with auxiliary refinement  or reconstruction tasks . Herein, we rely on a series of 3D ASC connected in a recurrent fashion to interpret the full context, while propagating contextual information in the bidirectional zùëßz-direction with the BiCLSTM. Pseudo Labelling is a semi-supervised strategy to cope with the difficulty of collecting annotations for large datasets. The strategy consists of two separated stages: training over labeled data and using the predictions (pseudo-labels) of a deep network over the initial unlabeled data points to retrain the model. Pseudo-labeling has been applied to classification and segmentation problems   , as well for correcting noisy labels in the context of active learning¬†. In this paper, we focus on training a segmentation model at the lowest annotation cost while leveraging pseudo-labeling on the high amount of unannotated slices to refine our propagation model. Unlike prior work, we do not split learning into two separate stages. Instead, we propose a new continuous and sequential pseudo-labeling scheme for volumetric data, taking advantage of the spatiotemporal smoothness between slices. Our strategy starts from an annotated 3D US sub-volume sampled from the full volume and as we propagate to unlabeled sub-volume, we adapt the objective function to compare the current time-step prediction with its previous time-step prediction, when no annotated data is available. The advantage of sequential pseudo labeling is to keep a continuous gradient flow during training, under the assumption that contiguous slices are very similar/show very similar information. The current state-of-the-art in volumetric segmentation relies on deep learning approaches and mainly on extensions of the U-Net architecture¬†[ref]9 to 3D, such as the 3D U-Net¬† or the V-Net¬†. Hesamian¬†et.al. presented a survey of popular methods that have employed deep-learning techniques for medical image segmentation and summarizes the most common challenges and some of the existent solutions. Recent methods¬†[ref]30  have addressed the memory issues associated with 3D operations and focus on providing a full-segmentation mask for the whole volume at once. Roth¬†et.al.[ref]30 replaced the concatenation layers of the 3D-UNet skip connections with summation layers and used a multi-GPU processor to segment full pancreas volumes. Similar to Roth¬†et.al.[ref]30, we rely on summation layers to reduce the total number of parameters. However, instead of processing whole volumes at once, we process sub-volumes sequentially, making it possible to segment large volumes with a single GPU. To overcome potential discontinuity artifacts induced by the sequential treatment, we employ a bidirectional spatiotemporal module (BiCLSTM). Novikov¬†et.al. studied the segmentation of volumes by the sequential processing of 2D slices to generate a smooth prediction. The approach was based on a 2D UNet and two BiCLSTMs, one at the bottleneck and one at the last decoder layer. Although we also rely on a BiCLSTM, we seek to locally preserve the data‚Äôs 3D nature; therefore, we do not rely on 2D slices but rather sub-volumes treated with 3D convolutions . The sequential processing of the sub-volumes is done through a BiCLSTM across the volume‚Äôs depth, designed to capture texture and changes and deformations at a larger scale. Finally, in our BiCLSTM module design, we learn the weights for the forward CLSTM only and reuse them for the backward CLSTM to reduce the total number of parameters. To handle the challenges of segmenting ultrasound images, Wang¬†et.al. proposed a complex deep-learning architecture with several attention modules named DAF3D, which successfully segments prostate volumes. Although confronted with similar challenges, we take a different approach, opting for a light architecture and modeling the problem as the joint optimization of a segmentation and a propagation tasks. This multi-task approach is implemented through a Siamese Network¬† instead of concurrent losses. Common losses for image segmentation are the cross-entropy loss¬†[ref]9, the Dice score¬†, or a combination of the two¬†. However, these choices are not adapted to handle a large imbalance between the background and foreground classes¬†. To this end, Salehi ¬†et.al.3 proposed the Tversky loss, which generalizes the Dice and FŒ≤subscriptùêπùõΩF_{\\beta} scores, achieving a trade-off between precision and recall by manually controlling the penalties for FPs and FNs with two weights Œ±ùõº\\alpha and Œ≤ùõΩ\\beta. We go one step further and propose to make the Œ±ùõº\\alpha and Œ≤ùõΩ\\beta learnable parameters progressively optimized during training. Dou¬†et.al. proposed a 3D deeply supervised network for volumetric scans. The method deploys a deep supervision to accelerate the optimization and boost the model performance, and proposes to refine the final contours with a Conditional Random Field (CRF). Despite the good reported performance, CRFs introduce an additional computational cost, and the deep supervision may be confronted with memory limitations for large volumes such as ours. Indeed, our volumes are significantly larger: 512√ó512√ó14005125121400512\\times 512\\times 1400 than those treated in all the above-cited works (128√ó128√ó31281283128\\times 128\\times 3 ,160√ó160√ó7216016072160\\times 160\\times 72 , 128√ó132√ó8012813280128\\times 132\\times 80 , ‚Ä¶), which has motivated our design choices in terms of a light architecture and sequential treatment of the volume. In summary, in this work, we process a 3D US image, and predict a full volumetric mask without resizing the initial input. We overcome potential memory limitations by: processing sequential sub-volumes and formulating the problem in terms of two joint segmentation and propagation tasks, building a lighter model that uses 3D atrous separable convolutions and shares weights between the forward and backward CLSTM module, and enforcing feature reuse and transfer using skip connections. We propose a parametric and learnable Tversy loss to overcome foreground/background pixels imbalance. We combine a modified Siamese architecture with the BiCLSTM module to model spatial and temporal coherence. Finally, we induce weak supervision through sequential pseudo labeling, and we improve the quality of the pseudo labels through a decremental update strategy, such that the training relies on very few annotated data.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: slices are very similar/show very similar information.
