Learning from noisy labels\nis a closely related, larger research area that concerns the presence of noisy labels, regardless of the sources of such labels. In this learning setting, the labels are not necessarily from crowds and often the case, there is only one noisy label for each instance.\nA large bulk of work has been proposed investigating different learning strategies, e.g., designing more robust loss function 6 7, architecture 8 9, regularization 0 1, or a better way of selecting samples 2, etc.\nEssentially, many robust architecture-based methods in this learning setting 8 9 are similar to those for learning from noisy crowd labels   [ref]17 : they all infer the ground truth labels through a neural layer from the noisy labels.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: the learning .\nSince then, a variety of generalizations and improvements upon the original method have been proposed under the same probabilistic framework   3  4.\nAnother line of the research     [ref]17 5   investigates learning directly from noisy crowdsourced labels without the preceding truth inference stage.\nTo the best of our knowledge, our work is the first that considers the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
