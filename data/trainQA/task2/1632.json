      "content": "Paper Title: Image Captioning using Deep Stacked LSTMs, Contextual Word Embeddings and Data Augmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe simplest approach to process text in NLP systems is to treat words as atomic units where they are represented as indices in a vocabulary. In this approach there is no focus on the similarity between words. This has some advantages of simplicity and robustness. Moreover, it has been observed that simple models trained on huge amounts of data perform better than complex systems trained on less data. For example, the N-gram models which are employed in statistical language processing are trained N-grams on virtually huge amounts of data in the range of trillions of words (Brants et. al. ).\nHowever, these simple techniques are not always viable. In a lot of cases, the amount of data available isn‚Äôt enough to train such simple models. Even in machine translation, the entire literature available for many low-resource languages contain only a few billions of words or less and the annotated data for translation or captioning tasks contains even fewer words. For example, the Flickr8k dataset  used for Image Captioning has around 40000 sentences in total with most sentences having lengths of less than 20 words (with 34 being the largest sentence length), thus bringing the total number of words to be far lesser than 1 million words. Hence, the techniques which learn simple relations between words, such as word frequency statistics, will not result in any significant progress.\nHence, its imperative that methods which attempt to learn complex relationships between words are used. Probably the first concept which employed distributed representations of words is provided in Hinton et. al.. However, with the progress of machine learning the widespread use has started only in recent years. The pioneering work in this regard is by Mikolov et. al. where the authors propose to represent words as dense vectors (as opposed to sparse one hot vectors).\nThey propose two variants: Continuous bags of Words (CBOW) and Skip-Gram Model. In the CBOW model, the inputs are the merged representations of words that appear in the surrounding context of a particular word and the desired output is the word whose context is being explored. In the Skip Gram model the Neural network tries to predict the words surrounding a given word(which is the input). Word embeddings are a better approach towards generalization to unseen examples because they are able to incorporate syntactic and semantic properties of words. For the task of Image Captioning, word embeddings have been used as a separate embedding layer which takes as input a sequence of words which have been encoded as numbers corresponding to the position of words in the vocabulary and produces as output a vector of length nùëõn where nùëõn is the embedding length. The weights of this embedding layer are either learned through backpropagation or are adapted from other language modelling tasks. Pretrained word embeddings have been used as well, such as in You et. al.  who use pretrained Glove word vectors from Pennington et. al.  to encode word information into the LSTM. Glove embeddings are an improvement to the skip-gram model proposed in Mikolov et. al. but both use the linear sequential properties of the text. In other words, both use the word co-occurrence properties of the text to calculate representations of the text. Other works such as Vinyals et. al. [ref]2 have noted that using pretrained embeddings does not provide performance enhancement in their model. We propose to employ word embeddings proposed in Komninos et. al.[ref]7 which employ both word and dependency context features. They consider co-occurrences between pairs of words, words and dependency context features, and between different dependency context features in a dependency graph . This is an extension to the dependency graph based embeddings proposed by Levy et. al.[ref]26. Hence the representations obtained share the properties common to both the window based models and the models based on dependency graphs. In addition, this approach provides additional structural information for the dependency graph based embeddings.\nSimilar to window based models where the words appearing within a certain distance are considered, in dependency based embeddings, a target word is considered as a node in the dependency graph. Then during the training process word embeddings are optimized in such a way that they maximize the probability of other words occurring within a certain distance in the graph.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: use the linear sequential properties of the text. In other words, both use the word co-occurrence properties of the text to calculate representations of the text. Other works such as Vinyals et. al.
