      "content": "Paper Title: Procrustes: a Dataflow and Accelerator for Sparse Deep Neural Network Training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe re-implemented the baseline Dropback training algorithm  using PyTorch [ref]37 and verified the reported training sparsity levels and accuracy results; we then implemented the initial weight decay and quantile-estimation extensions needed for Procrustes. We evaluated Procrustes on five CNNs: ResNet18  (11.7M weights) and MobileNet v2 (3.5M weights) applied to the ImageNet image classification task , as well VGG-S [ref]46 (a 9.2×\\times reduced version of VGG-16 with 15M weights), WRN-28-10  (36.5M weights), and a small Densenet  (growth rate 24, 3 blocks ×\\times 10 layers, for a total of 2.7M weights), all CIFAR-10 . To determine optimal mappings and dataflows, we extended Timeloop  to support sparse weight masks (retrieved from our PyTorch model), model sparse computation, account for sparse encoding overheads, and accurately reflect latency due to load imbalances. We also used Timeloop to determine cycle-level latency; to determine energy costs, we use energy access cost provided in Accelergy [ref]42 with its default 40nm library. We modelled all layers of all networks and all stages of training (forward, backward, and weight update). As a dense baseline, we used a 2D PE array architecture with 16×\\times16 PEs, adapted to the 32-bit floating-point precision commonly used in training; we used Timeloop to determine the optimal tiling and dataflow. Hardware modules not present in the baseline were implemented in Verilog RTL and synthesized using Synopsys DC in the 45nm FreePDK process. Accelerator configuration details are shown in Table I.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: We re-implemented the baseline Dropback training algorithm  using PyTorch [ref]37 and verified the reported training sparsity levels and accuracy results; we then implemented the initial weight decay and quantile-estimation extensions needed for Procrustes.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
