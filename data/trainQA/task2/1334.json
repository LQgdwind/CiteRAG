      "content": "Paper Title: Book Embeddings of 𝑘-Map Graphs Supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), grant Br835/20-1.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor any even k𝑘k, a n𝑛n-clique with n=3​k/2𝑛3𝑘2n=3k/2 can be represented\nby a k𝑘k-map . Then three points of degree k𝑘k\nsupport all adjacencies, for example k=4𝑘4k=4 for K6subscript𝐾6K_{6}. Hence, we obtain an improved lower\nbound on the book thickness of k𝑘k-map graphs. In improved upper bound is obtained\nfrom Theorems 2.1 and 3.2. The book thickness of k𝑘k-map graphs is at most 6​⌊k/2⌋+56𝑘256\\lfloor k/2\\rfloor+5. For any k≥3𝑘3k\\geq 3, there are k𝑘k-map graphs (or k𝑘k-framed\nmultigraphs) with book\nthickness at least ⌊3​k/4⌋3𝑘4\\lfloor 3k/4\\rfloor. The book thickness of Knsubscript𝐾𝑛K_{n} is ⌈n/2⌉𝑛2\\lceil n/2\\rceil \nand Knsubscript𝐾𝑛K_{n} is a k𝑘k-map graph for n≤⌊3​k/2⌋𝑛3𝑘2n\\leq\\lfloor 3k/2\\rfloor\n.\n∎ Chen et al.  have observed that any triangulated\n1-planar graph is a 4-map graph. The drawing of a triangulated\n1-planar graph consists of triangles and quadrangles, which contain\na pair of crossed edges, as shown by Alam et al.[ref]1.\nHence, any triconnected 1-planar graph is a 444-framed graph. In\ngeneral, there are W-configurations  with a pair of\ncrossed edges in the outer face of a component at a separation\npair, see Figure 1. Now multi-edges come into play, such\nthat any 2-connected 1-planar graph is a subgraph of a 4-framed\nmultigraph. Clearly, each 1-planar graph can be augmented to a\n2-connected 1-planar multigraph. From Theorem 4.1 we obtain a bound of\n17 for the book thickness of 1-planar graphs, which improves\nthe previous bounds of 39 in [ref]2 and 29 that can\nbe obtained from\n[ref]5. We can do even better. Any 1-planar graph can be embedded in eleven pages. Any 1-planar graph is a subgraph of a 4-framed multigraph whose\nfaces are triangles or quadrangles and there is a pair of crossed\nedges in each quadrangle. Consider a 2-level graph.\nIf f𝑓f is a triangle, then its edges are embedded in pages P1,P2subscript𝑃1subscript𝑃2P_{1},P_{2} and\nP3subscript𝑃3P_{3} by Lemma 6.\nIf f𝑓f is a quadrangle, then only one crossed edge remains\nfor the set V−​(f)superscript𝑉𝑓V^{-}(f). By Theorem 3.1, all remaining\ncrossed edges can be embedded in three pages. As observed in ,\none page can be saved at the composition, such that eleven\npages suffice for the book embedding of any 1-planar\ngraph.\n∎ The crossed cube, as shown in Figure 1, is a\n4-framed graph, whose frame is a (planar) cube, such that their is a\npair of crossed edges in each face. It is a 1-planar graph with 8\nvertices and 24 edges. It has book thickness four, since the vertex\nordering is taken from a Hamiltonian cycle of the frame, such that\nfour pages suffice, and it needs four pages as shown in\n.\n Bekos et al.  have characterized optimal 2-planar\ngraphs and have shown that edges are uncrossed or crossed twice and\nedges that are crossed twice can be grouped or caged to K5subscript𝐾5K_{5} if\nn𝑛n-vertex graphs are optimal and have 5​n−105𝑛105n-10 edges, see\nFigure 1. In consequence, if an edge is crossed\ntwice, then its crossing edges are incident to a common vertex and\nthe vertices of these three edges form K5subscript𝐾5K_{5}. In consequence, an\noptimal 2-planar graph is a 5-map graph , such\nthat it is a 5-framed graph. Bekos et al. [ref]5\nhave shown that the book thickness of optimal 2-planar graphs is 23,\nwhich can be improved. Any clique augmented 2-planar graph, and in particular, any\noptimal 2-planar graph, can be embedded in 17 pages.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: any triangulated\n1-planar graph is a 4-map graph. The drawing of a triangulated\n1-planar graph consists of triangles and quadrangles, which contain\na pair of crossed edges, as shown by Alam et al.[ref]1.\nHence, any triconnected 1-planar graph is a 444-framed graph.
