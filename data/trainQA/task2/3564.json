      "content": "Paper Title: Few Induced Disjoint Paths for 𝐻-Free GraphsAn extended abstract of this paper will appear in the proceedings of ISCO 2022 [21].\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe first discuss existing results for Induced Disjoint Paths (where k𝑘k is part of the input).\nAll the positive results hold for a slightly more general problem definition (see Section 6).\nGolovach et al.   proved that\nInduced Disjoint Paths is linear-time solvable for circular-arc graphs and polynomial-time solvable for AT-free graphs, respectively.\nBelmonte et al.  showed the latter for chordal graphs, and Jaffke et al.  did so for any graph class of bounded mim-width.\nIn contrast, Induced Disjoint Paths stays NP-complete even for claw-free graphs , line graphs of triangle-free chordless graphs  and thus for (theta,wheel)-free graphs, and for planar graphs; to prove the latter, use a result of Lynch  (see ). The following recent dichotomy is immediately relevant for our paper.\nLet G1+G2subscript𝐺1subscript𝐺2G_{1}+G_{2} be the disjoint union of two vertex-disjoint graphs G1subscript𝐺1G_{1} and G2subscript𝐺2G_{2}, and let s​G𝑠𝐺sG denote the disjoint union of s𝑠s copies of a graph G𝐺G.\nWe write F⊆iGsubscript𝑖𝐹𝐺F\\subseteq_{i}G if F𝐹F is an induced subgraph of a graph G𝐺G, that is, F𝐹F can be obtained from G𝐺G by a sequence of vertex deletions. We let Prsubscript𝑃𝑟P_{r} denote the path on r𝑟r vertices. A linear forest is the disjoint union of one or more paths. For a graph H𝐻H, Induced Disjoint Paths on H𝐻H-free graphs is polynomial-time solvable if\nH⊆is​P3+P6subscript𝑖𝐻𝑠subscript𝑃3subscript𝑃6H\\subseteq_{i}sP_{3}+P_{6} for some s≥0𝑠0s\\geq 0; NP-complete if H𝐻H is not a linear forest; and quasipolynomial-time solvable otherwise. We return to Theorem 1.1 later, and we now fix k𝑘k. Radovanović et al.  proved that\nk𝑘k-Induced Disjoint Paths is polynomial-time solvable for (theta,wheel)-free graphs. Fiala et al.  proved the same result for claw-free graphs. Note that both results complement the aforementioned hardness results when k𝑘k is part of the input. Golovach et al.  showed\nthat Induced Disjoint Paths is even FPT with parameter k𝑘k for claw-free graphs. The same holds for planar graphs [ref]15, and even for graph classes of bounded genus, as shown by Kobayashi and Kawarabayashi .\nLet Crsubscript𝐶𝑟C_{r} denote the r𝑟r-vertex cycle.\nIt follows (using Lemma 3) from a result of Leveque et al.  that 222-Induced Disjoint Paths is NP-complete for H𝐻H-free graphs if H=Cr𝐻subscript𝐶𝑟H=C_{r} for every r≥3𝑟3r\\geq 3 with r≠6𝑟6r\\neq 6. The generalization from paths to connected subgraphs joining sets of terminals instead of pairs has also been considered, but these results do not impact upon our work in this paper; we refer to  for further details. Moreover, the restriction to H𝐻H-free graphs has also been studied for Disjoint Paths (recall that if k𝑘k is fixed this problem is polynomial in general ); see  for a complexity classification of Disjoint Paths for H𝐻H-free graphs, subject to a set of three unknown cases.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: hardness results when k𝑘k is part of the input.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
