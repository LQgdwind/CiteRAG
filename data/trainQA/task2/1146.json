      "content": "Paper Title: Automorphic Equivalence-aware Graph Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe past few years have witnessed the phenomenal success of GNNs in numerous\ngraph learning tasks, such as node classification ,\nlink prediction [ref]59,\nand community detection ,\nwhich is largely due to their capability of simultaneously modelling the connecting patterns and feature distribution in each node’s local neighborhood.\nAs a result, it leads to a surge of interests from both academia and industry to develop more powerful GNN models .\nDespite of various architectures, the most popular GNNs, like GCN , GraphSAGE ,\nGAT [ref]48 and GIN ,\napply permutation invariant aggregate function on each node’s local neighborhood to learn node embeddings,\nwhich leads to concerns about their representational power [ref]17 . In this paper,\nwe investigate GNN’s expressiveness from an important but largely overlooked angle,\ni.e., the capacity to distinguish automorphic equivalence within each node’s local neighborhood.\nAutomorphic equivalence (AE)  is a classic concept to differentiate the structural role of each node in a given graph.\nSpecifically, two nodes are considered to be AE only if they are interchangeable in some index permutations that preserve the connection matrix, i.e.,\ngraph automorphisms . AE can identify the nodes that exhibit identical structural features in a graph, which makes it a central topic in computational biologist, social network analysis and other scientific domains  . For example, empirical studies show AE is an important indicator of social position and behavior similarity in social network  , which thus might significantly benefit GNN architecture design. Empirically efficient heuristics have been proposed to identify the AE in moderate scale graphs by enumerating all the possible automorphisms  .\nHowever, previous analytic methods only classify nodes into categorical equivalence sets.\nAlthough categorical features can be jointly optimized with GNNs under various frameworks  ,\nlittle previous efforts are invested to principally incorporate AE into GNNs.\nThus, we aim to design a novel GNN model that is provably expressive in capturing AE features and can be tuned in a data-dependent manner based on the graph data and targeted applications,\nwhich will effectively allow us to learn expressive function to harness the power of AE feature. Here, we propose GRaph AutomorPhic Equivalent network, i.e., GRAPE, a novel variant of GNN that can learn expressive representation by differentiating the automorphic equivalences of each node’s neighbors. First, GRAPE extends the classic AE concept into a localized setting, i.e., Ego-AE, to accommodate the local nature of GNNs. Specifically, Ego-AE identifies the local neighborhoods of each node by mapping with given subgraph templates and then partitions the neighboring nodes into Ego-AE sets based on the graph automorphisms in neighborhood. Second, we design a learnable AE-aware aggregators to model the node features in these Ego-AE sets, which adaptively assigns different weights to neighboring nodes in different Ego-AE sets and explicitly model the interdependency among them. Moreover, in order to capture complex structural features, GRAPE proposes to fuse the embeddings learned from Ego-AE sets identified by different subgraph templates with a squeeze-and-excitation module . Finally, to alleviate the barrier of subgraph template design, we propose an efficient genetic algorithm to automatically search for optimal subgraph templates. Specifically, it gradually optimizes a randomly initiated population of subgraph templates by iteratively exploring the adjacency of good performing candidates and eliminating the bad performing ones.\nTo accelerate the search process, we further design an incremental subgraph matching algorithm that can leverage the similarity between subgraphs to greatly reduce the complexity of finding matched instances. We theoretically prove that the proposed GRAPE is expressive in terms of learning distinct representations for nodes with different Ego-AE sets, which fundamentally makes up the shortcomings of popular GNN variants, e.g., GCN , GraphSAGE , GAT [ref]48 and GIN .\nMoreover, we empirically validate GRAPE on eight real-world datasets, which cover the scenarios of social network, citation network and e-commerce co-purchase network.\nExperiments show GRAPE is consistently the best performing model across all datasets with up to 26.7% accuracy improvement.\nBesides, case studies indicate GRAPE can effectively differentiate the structural roles of each node’s neighbors. Moreover, the proposed genetic algorithm efficiently generates high quality subgraph templates that have comparable performance with the hand-crafted ones.\n\nReference markers found: [59]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]59: The past few years have witnessed the phenomenal success of GNNs in numerous\ngraph learning tasks, such as node classification ,\nlink prediction [ref]59,\nand community detection ,\nwhich is largely due to their capability of simultaneously modelling the connecting patterns and feature distribution in each node’s local neighborhood.\nAs a\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
