      "content": "Paper Title: Deciding Subtyping for Asynchronous Multiparty Sessions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMultiparty session types (MSTs)¬† are a type-based approach to verifying communication protocols. In MST frameworks, a communication protocol is expressed as a global type, which describes the interactions of all protocol participants from a birds-eye view.\nThe key property of interest in MST frameworks is implementability, which asks whether there exists a collection of local implementations, one per protocol participant, that is deadlock-free and produces the same set of behaviors described by the global type.\nThe latter property is known as protocol fidelity.\nGiven an implementable global type, the synthesis problem asks to compute such a collection.\nTo solve implementability and synthesis, MST frameworks are often equipped with a projection operator, which is a partial map from global types to a collection of local implementations.\nProjection operators compute a correct implementation for a given global type if one¬†exists. However, projection operators only compute one candidate out of many possible implementations for a given global type, which narrows the usability of MST frameworks. As we demonstrate below, substituting this candidate can in some cases achieve an exponential reduction in the size of the local implementation.\nFurthermore, applications may sometimes require that an implementation produce only a subset of the global type‚Äôs specified behaviors.\nWe refer to this property as subprotocol fidelity.\nFor example, a general client-server protocol may customize the set of requests it handles to the specific devices it runs on. Subtyping reintroduces this flexibility into MST frameworks, by characterizing when an implementation can replace another while preserving desirable correctness guarantees. Formally, a subtyping relation is a reflexive and transitive relation that respects Liskov and Wing‚Äôs substitution principle¬†8: T‚Ä≤superscriptùëá‚Ä≤T^{\\prime} is a subtype of TùëáT when T‚Ä≤superscriptùëá‚Ä≤T^{\\prime} can be safely used in any context that expects a term of type TùëáT.\nWhile implementability for MSTs was originally defined on syntactic local types , other implementation models have since been investigated, including communicating session automata¬† and behavioral contracts¬†.\nWe motivate our work with the observation that a subtyping relation is only as powerful as its notion of safety, and the expressivity of its underlying implementation model.\nExisting subtyping relations adopt a notion of safety that is agnostic to a global specification.\nFor example,   define safety as the successful completion of a single role in binary sessions, 6 defines safety as eventual reception and progress of all roles in multiparty sessions, and 6 defines safety as the termination of all roles in multiparty sessions.\nAs a result, these subtyping relations eagerly reject subtypes that are viable for the specific global type at hand.\nIn addition, existing implementation models are restricted to local types with directed choice for branching, or equivalent representations thereof¬†, which prohibit a role from sending messages to or receiving messages from different participants in a choice. This restrictiveness undermines the flexibility that subtyping is fundamentally designed to provide. We present a subtyping relation that extends prior work along both dimensions.\nWe define a stronger notion of safety with respect to a given global type: a substitution is safe if in all well-behaved contexts, the resulting implementation satisfies both deadlock freedom and subprotocol fidelity.\nWe assume an implementation model of unrestricted communicating state machines (CSMs)¬†[ref]4 communicating via FIFO channels, which subsumes implementation models in prior work¬†6 6 0.\nWe demonstrate that this generalization renders existing subtyping relations which are precise for a restrictive implementation model incomplete.\nAs a result of both extensions, our subtyping relation requires reasoning about available messages¬†9 for completeness, a novel feature that is absent from existing subtyping relations. Our result applies to global types with sender-driven choice, which generalize global types from their original formulation with directed choice¬†, and borrows insights from recent work on a sound and complete projection operator for this class of global types¬†7. Contributions.\n\n\nIn this paper, we present the first precise subtyping relation that guarantees deadlock freedom and subprotocol fidelity with respect to a global type, and that assumes an unrestricted, asynchronous CSM implementation model.\nWe solve the Protocol Verification problem and the Protocol Refinement problem with respect to global type ùêÜùêÜ\\mathbf{G} and a set of roles ùí´ùí´\\mathcal{P}: Protocol Verification: Given a CSM ùíúùíú\\mathcal{A}, does ùíúùíú\\mathcal{A} implement ùêÜùêÜ\\mathbf{G}? Protocol Refinement: Let ùöôùöô{\\color[rgb]{0.1,0.3,0.1}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0.1,0.3,0.1}\\bm{{\\color[rgb]{0.1,0.3,0.1}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0.1,0.3,0.1}\\mathtt{p}}}} be a role and let BùêµB be a safe implementation for ùöôùöô{\\color[rgb]{0.1,0.3,0.1}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0.1,0.3,0.1}\\bm{{\\color[rgb]{0.1,0.3,0.1}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0.1,0.3,0.1}\\mathtt{p}}}} in any well-behaved context for ùêÜùêÜ\\mathbf{G}. Given Aùê¥A, can Aùê¥A safely replace BùêµB in any well-behaved context for ùêÜùêÜ\\mathbf{G}? We exploit the connection between MST subtyping and CSM refinement to formulate concise conditions that are directly checkable on candidate state machines. Using this characterization, we show that both problems are decidable in polynomial time.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: well-behaved contexts, the resulting implementation satisfies both deadlock freedom and subprotocol fidelity.\nWe assume an implementation model of unrestricted communicating state machines (CSMs)¬†[ref]4 communicating via FIFO channels, which subsumes implementation models in prior work¬†6 6 0.\nWe demonstrate that this generalization renders existing subtyping relations which are precise for a\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
