      "content": "Paper Title: FedTP: Federated Learning by Transformer Personalization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n1) Benchmarks: We compared FedTP with the basic Federated algorithms, such as FedAvg  and FedProx , as well as with several advanced personalization algorithms: FedPer , pFedMe , FedBN , pFedHN [ref]43, pFedGP ,\nand FedRoD [ref]45. 2) Non-IID Settings of Datasets:\nWe use three popular benchmark datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 3, and Shakespeare . The first two are image datasets and the last one is a language dataset.\nFor CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, we applied two split strategies to simulate non-IID scenarios. The first is a ‚ÄúPathological‚Äù setting, where each client is randomly assigned two/ten classes for CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100 as in . The sample rate on client iùëñi of selected class cùëêc is obtained by ai,c/‚àëjaj,csubscriptùëéùëñùëêsubscriptùëósubscriptùëéùëóùëê{a_{i,c}}/{\\sum_{j}a_{j,c}}, where ai,c‚àºU‚Äã(.4,.6)similar-tosubscriptùëéùëñùëêùëà.4.6a_{i,c}\\sim U(.4,.6).\nThe second is a federated version created by randomly partitioning the datasets among clients using a symmetric Dirichlet distribution with parameter Œ±=0.3ùõº0.3\\alpha=0.3, as in  [ref]29. We create federated versions of CIFAR-10 by randomly partitioning samples with the same label among clients according to a Dirichlet distribution with parameter Œ±=0.3ùõº0.3\\alpha=0.3. As for CIFAR-100, in order to create more realistic local datasets, we use a two-stage Pachinko allocation method to partition samples over ‚Äúcoarse‚Äù and ‚Äúfine‚Äù labels. This method firstly generates a Dirichlet distribution with parameter Œ±=0.3ùõº0.3\\alpha=0.3 over the coarse labels for each client, and then generates a Dirichlet distribution with parameter Œ≤=10ùõΩ10\\beta=10 over the coarse corresponding fine labels. For both partitions, the classes and distribution of classes in training and test set of each client are the same.\nFor Shakespeare, similar to the partitions in [ref]29, we maintained the original split between the training and testing data specifically, 80%percent\\% for training and 20%percent\\% for testing.\nTable I summarizes the datasets, corresponding tasks, and the number of clients and models. 3) Model Architectures:\nSimilar to many federated works [ref]43 [ref]45, we adopted a ConvNet  with 2 convolutional layers and 3 fully-connected layers as the local neural networks for baseline methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. To improve the communication efficiency of large-scale federated scenarios, we chose a tiny ViT with fewer parameters for FedTP, which consisted of 8 blocks with 8 self-attention layers in each block. The corresponding attention head number is 8, and the patch size is 4 and the hidden size is 128.\nWith regards to Shakespeare, we applied the same stacked two-layer LSTM model as  [ref]29 for benchmark methods.\nFor a fair comparison with LSTM, we used a simple Transformer  with two blocks as an encoder. The depth for both the LSTM and the simple Transformer is 2 and the inner hidden dimension for both is 256.\nSince FedTP has a similar backbone for image classification tasks and language prediction tasks, we are able to use the same structure for the hypernetwork h‚Äã(œÜ;‚ãÖ)‚Ñéùúë‚ãÖh(\\varphi;\\cdot) except for the last layer.\nWe implement this hypernetwork similar to [ref]43 with an MLP network and parameter mapping heads. The MLP network consists of four fully-connected layers with 150 neurons and each parameter mapping head is a single FC layer.\nFor FedBN , we follow its original design which adds one BN layer after each convolution layer and fully-connected layer (except for the last layer). For FedRoD [ref]45, since the reported accuracy between hypernetwork version and the linear version is similar, we adopt the linear version. 4) Implementation Details:\nFollowing the experimental setting in pFedHN [ref]43, we implement FedTP and the benchmark methods with 50 and 100 clients at 10%percent\\% and 5%percent\\% participation for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively. In the Shakespeare scenario, we treated each identity as a client and sampled 10%percent\\% clients in each communication round.\nFor the image classification task, we trained every algorithm for 1500 communication rounds. To make for an equivalent communication cost, pFedHN [ref]43 is trained for 5000 global communication rounds.\nFor the next-character prediction task, we trained the corresponding methods for 300 communication rounds. Both tasks were optimized with a SGD optimizer for 5 local epochs with a default learning rate of l‚Äãr=0.01ùëôùëü0.01lr=0.01 and a batch size of B=64ùêµ64B=64.\nIn FedTP and pFedHN, we optimize the hypernetworks by using the SGD optimizer with a default learning rate Œ≤ùõΩ\\beta = 0.01.\nThe server and all clients are simulated on a cluster with an RTX 2080 Ti GPU, and all algorithms are implemented in PyTorch .\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: 1) Benchmarks: We compared FedTP with the basic Federated algorithms, such as FedAvg  and FedProx , as well as with several advanced personalization algorithms: FedPer , pFedMe , FedBN , pFedHN [ref]43, pFedGP ,\nand FedRoD [ref]45. 2) Non-IID Settings of Datasets:\nWe use three popular benchmark datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 3, and Shakespeare .
