However, it is difficult to capture and model that by simply stacking multiple local operation-based layers for complex scenarios. Temporal Relation Network  (TRN), which is inspired by the relational network , learns temporal relations at multiple time scales.\nSpatio-Temporal Context Model [ref]24 (STCM) simultaneously models the before-action, after-action and action itself to integrate temporal contextual information. It also collects spatial contextual information by modeling the whole frame and capturing the relations between the target human action region and its surrounding region.\nBased on ConvLSTM , Correlational Convolutional LSTM  (C2LSTM) computes the correlation between the input matrices of t-1 and t, by dividing them into patches and computing the cross correlation of each pair.\nConvolutional relation network  stacks convolutional relation blocks, which includes dilation group-specific convolution, temporal convolution and attention pooling, to extract global features of node pairs and edge pairs for skeleton-based action recognition.\n uses the relative position and relative speed to provide spatial information and dynamic information in skeletal action sequences, and build a bidirectional LSTM-CNN to fuse spatial–temporal information for skeleton-based action recognition.\nSpatial-Temporal Pyramid Network [ref]29 (S-TPNet) extracts multi-scale appearance features from different stages of the 2D CNN. It groups the frame features into different snippet-level features and uses fully-connected layers to reason about snippet relations. Another efficient way to model long-range relations is the self-attention mechanism.\nThe self-attention mechanism used to model long-range relations between any two elements is first applied in machine translation [ref]30.\nA self-attention module computes the response at a position in a sequence by attending to all positions and taking their weighted average in an embedding space.\nNon-local neural network  associates self-attention for machine translation with the more general class of non-local filtering operations that are applicable to computer vision.\nDouble attention network  captures the second-order feature statistics and makes adaptive feature assignment by gathering and distributing long-range features.\nCompact generalized non-local network (CGNL)  proposes the mechanism to model the interactions between positions across channels in non-local modules, making it in a fast and low-complexity computation flow with low-order Taylor series approximation.\nExpectation-maximization attention network  formulates the attention mechanism into an expectation-maximization manner, which helps it to be friendly in memory and computation and be robust to the variance of input.\nGlobal Context Network  (GCNet) uses a simplified query-independent non-local network to reduce computation cost, and it unifies\nSqueeze-Excitation Network  (SENet) and non-local network into a general framework for global context modeling.\nVideo Action Transformer Network  uses Transformer-style [ref]30 architecture to attend relevant regions of the person to their context.\nCriss-cross attention module  harvests the contextual information of its surrounding pixels on the criss-cross path to realize the self-attention mechanism with less computation, and performs better in image segmentation task than non-local networks. However, it has not been applied to and verified in action recognition task.\nWe extend the CCA to CCA-3D and design a novel architecture of the RCCA-3D. Each CCA-3D module can capture the long-distance spatial and temporal dependencies at the same time, so as to improve the accuracy for action recognition task.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: layers for complex scenarios. Temporal Relation Network  (TRN), which is inspired by the relational network , learns temporal relations at multiple time scales.\nSpatio-Temporal Context Model [ref]24 (STCM) simultaneously models the before-action, after-action and action itself to integrate temporal contextual information.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
