In some domains, like finance, explainability has already become required by law , as credit scoring systems must be able to provide explanations of their decisions.\nAnother example is the recent GDPR regulation, which contains a clause granting individuals the right to explanation of algorithmic decisions pertaining to them .\nErrors in systems involved in making critical decisions, like control systems for autonomous vehicles, can have catastrophic results [ref]3, and the capacity to accurately and confidently determine the causes of erroneous decisions will be crucial to further adoption of these systems. Examples of situations in which ML models provide the right predictions for the wrong reasons, like an image classifier identifying wolves through presence of snow in the background of an image [ref]4 or a similar case involving recognition of horses solely by presence of a watermark , are not uncommon. Even though such comical outcomes are often caused by composition of the training dataset, without methods of inquiry into the decision-making process of a machine learning model, correct identification of causes of these issues would be difficult. Even though the first attempts to inspect decision-making rules learned by neural networks were published in 1990s , the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), has only begun to properly establish itself over the course of the past 5 years. As industry demand for explainability of machine learning models has arisen only recently and the field is still very young, the definition of \"explainability\" remains fuzzy and the goals of XAI are an object of ongoing debate [ref]7.\nUsually, explainability is understood as interpretability - a possibility of comprehending the machine learning model and identifying the basis for its decision-making process in a way understandable to humans .\nOther postulated qualities include: fairness [ref]7, which demands the learned decision making rules to abide ethics; privacy, often understood as differential privacy ; or trustworthiness.\nThese concepts are difficult to define in a rigorous manner and span a broad range of fields, from law through social sciences to philosophy. Within the scope of this work we will define explainability as interpretability of machine learning models.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: to explanation of algorithmic decisions pertaining to them .\nErrors in systems involved in making critical decisions, like control systems for autonomous vehicles, can have catastrophic results [ref]3, and the capacity to accurately and confidently determine the causes of erroneous decisions will be crucial to further adoption of these systems.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
