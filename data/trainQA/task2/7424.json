      "content": "Paper Title: Score-Based Physics-Informed Neural Networks for High-Dimensional Fokker-Planck Equations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSeveral mainstream approaches have emerged to transcend the challenges the CoD poses in addressing high-dimensional PDEs: physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) , backward stochastic differential equations (BSDE) [ref]8, and the Multilevel Picard method .\nIn terms of the PINN-based approach, Wang et al. [ref]31 proved the necessity of using the L‚àûsubscriptùêøL_{\\infty} loss and adversarial training for PINNs in order to solve high-dimensional HJB equations. The FP equations under consideration in this paper can be transformed into HJB equations, which are satisfied by the logarithm likelihood modeled by the SDE. He et al. 0 proposed the randomized smoothing PINN (RS-PINN) whose derivatives can be evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation and Stein‚Äôs identity, thus avoiding the costly automatic differentiation. Later, Zhao et al.  proposed using sparse quadratures to replace Monte Carlo simulation for variance reduction. Hu et al.  analyzed the bias-variance tradeoff in RS-PINN. Stochastic dimension gradient descent (SDGD)  samples dimension subsets for gradient descent for training PINNs to reduce memory cost and accelerate convergence. The Hutchinson trace estimation (HTE)  can replace the costly high-dimensional Hessian in the PINN loss for acceleration.\nBSDE [ref]8 and deep splitting method  connect deep learning with traditional BSDE and splitting methods for solving parabolic PDEs, respectively. Then, deep learning fits the unknown functions within the traditional methods.\nThe multilevel Picard method  4 tackles nonlinear parabolic PDEs under certain regularity conditions with provable convergence.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: approaches have emerged to transcend the challenges the CoD poses in addressing high-dimensional PDEs: physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) , backward stochastic differential equations (BSDE) [ref]8, and the Multilevel Picard method .\nIn terms of the PINN-based approach, Wang et al.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
