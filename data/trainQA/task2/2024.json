In Figure 2, we sample 100 optimal architectures of one face recognition search process and one ImageNet classification search process, respectively. For each architecture, we firstly expand its tokens to one-hot representation following [ref]22. After that, we can compare statistical divergence between the architecture family of face and ImageNet search processes. The results are shown in Figure 2. Similar conclusions can be obtained that the operators can be divided into two categories, one with large differences and the other with small differences. Many previous works     [ref]23 use a predictor to predict an architecture’s performance to speed up the NAS process. However, as the predictor requires thousands of samples to train, they usually  evolves in a progressive  or semi-supervised manner [ref]23. Inspired by the interesting observation above, we implement it in a unified way where different search processes’ samples are used together to train a unified value network to map each architecture’s one-hot representation [ref]22 to its performance.\nWhen running a new search experiment, we just use directly the unified network trained by the old data and keep updating it in the new task during the search process, which speeds up the convergence of the value network. As shown in Figure 3(a), when transferring a value network trained on ImageNet to face recognition task, the network converges much faster.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: in many applications that a good network architecture in one task tends to generalize to work well on other tasks.\n An illustrative example of the observation is  adopting the pre-trained ImageNet [ref]6 models  as the backbone networks for object detection , semantic segmentation , face recognition , etc. In NAS, however, this assumption needs to be carefully  verified as there exist a huge\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
