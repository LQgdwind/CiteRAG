      "content": "Paper Title: Permutation Equivariant Graph Framelets for Heterophilous Graph Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraphs are ubiquitous data structures for a variety of real-life entities, such as traffic networks, social networks, citation networks, chemo- and bio-informatics networks, etc. With the abstraction via graphs, many real-world problems that are related to networks and communities can be cast into a unified framework and solved by exploiting its underlying rich and deep mathematical theory as well as tremendously efficient computational techniques. In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) for graph learning such as node classification [ref]1, link prediction , and graph classification , have demonstrated their powerful learning ability and achieved remarkable performance     . In the particular field of node classification, many GNN models follow the homophily assumption, that is, the majority of edges connect nodes from the same classes (e.g., researchers in a citation network tend to cite each other from the same area), yet graphs with heterophily, that is, the majority of edges connect nodes from different classes [ref]9, do exist in many real-world scenarios. A typical example is in a cyber network where a phishing attacker usually sends fraudulent messages to a large population of normal users (victims) in order to obtain sensitive information. We refer to [ref]10  for the limitations of early GNNs on homophilous graphs and a recent survey paper [ref]9 on GNNs for heterophilous graphs. Heterophilous graphs differ from homophilous graphs not only spatially in terms of distribution beyond the 1-hop neighborhood but also spectrally with larger oscillation in terms of the frequency distribution of graph signals under the graph Laplacian. Such properties bring challenges to learning on heterophilous graphs and demand new GNNs the ability to extract intrinsic information in order to achieve high performance. To enhance the influence of nodes from the same classes that are outside of 1-hop neighborhoods, one common approach is based on the multi-hop aggregation to leverage information of kùëòk-hop neighborhoods, k‚â•2ùëò2k\\geq 2. Its effectiveness for heterophilous graphs is emphasized and theoretically verified in .\nA common way to perform multi-hop aggregation is to utilize the powers of the adjacency matrix. Repeatedly applying Laplacian smoothing many times, prompted by using higher powers of adjacency matrix, can result in a convergence of vertex features within each connected component of the graph towards uninformative or identical values, a phenomenon referred to as over-smoothing [ref]10 . Moreover, they may lead to dense matrices and cause computation and storage burdens. To seek further improvement, it is thus desirable to consider an alternative spatial resolution of graphs other than kùëòk-hop neighborhood. To answer this question, we work on the theory of wavelet/framelet systems on graphs which brings a notion of scale on graphs and wavelets/framelets corresponding to such scales. In this paper, we introduce and integrate a dedicated graph framelet system so as to perform multi-scale extraction on graphs. Actually, classical wavelets/framelets in the Euclidean domains, e.g., see  , are well-known examples of multi-scale representation, which have been extended to irregular domains such as graphs and manifolds under similar principles in recent years, e.g., see    . Some graph wavelets/framelets systems are also proposed and applied in GNNs for node and graph classifications 0 1 2. When the graph is reordered, it is natural to expect the produced wavelets/framelets to be reordered in the same way for robust learning. However, most of the graph wavelets/framelets do not possess such a property of permutation equivariance. That is, up to certain permutations, the constructed graph wavelet/framelet systems should be the ‚Äúsame‚Äù regardless of the underlying node orderings. The work on Haar-type graph wavelets/framelets 3  4 0 5 are ‚Äúpiecewise-constant‚Äù functions on graphs that depend on a given tree with certain underlying node ordering. If new orderings are given, though the underlying graph and graph data are the same, the newly resulting graph wavelets/framelets are no longer the same. Without the property of permutation equivariance, the network outputs could vary with respect to graph reordering and thus lead to instability of the GNNs. In this paper, we provide a novel and general method to construct Haar-type graph framelets having the permutation equivariance property, which further implies the permutation equivariance of our graph framelet neural network (GFNN) model PEGFAN (Permutation Equivariant Graph Framelet Augmented Network). Our Haar-type graph framelets are constructed spatially with respect to a hierarchical structure on the underlying graph.\nScales in such systems correspond to the levels in the hierarchical structure in which higher levels are associated with larger groups of nodes. Multi-scale extractions via such graph framelets are regarded as alternatives and supplements for the usual multi-hop aggregations. Moreover, we show that our graph framelets possess sparse representation property, which leads to the sparsity property of the orthogonal projection matrix (framelet matrix) formed by stacking those framelet vectors at certain scales. This is in contrast to the high powers of adjacency matrices and their non-sparse nature. Furthermore, we apply our graph framelets in the neural network architecture design by using the framelet matrices at different scales as well as the adjacency matrices to form multi-channel input and perform multi-scale extraction through attention and concatenation. The state-of-the-art node classification accuracies on several benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our GFNN model. In summary, the contribution of this paper is as follows: 1) We propose a novel and general method to construct Haar-type graph framelets that have properties of permutation equivariance, sparse representation, efficient computation, and so on. 2) We apply our Haar-type graph framelet system to extract multi-scale information and integrate it into a graph neural network architecture. 3) We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model for node classification on synthetic and benchmark datasets via extensive comparisons with several state-of-the-art GNN models.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: underlying rich and deep mathematical theory as well as tremendously efficient computational techniques.
