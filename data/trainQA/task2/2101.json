      "content": "Paper Title: Heuristic-Guided Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMany recent empirical successes of reinforcement learning (RL) require solving problems with very long decision-making horizons.\nOpenAI Five  used episodes that were 200002000020000 timesteps on average, while AlphaStar  used roughly 500050005000 timesteps.\nLong-term credit assignment is a very challenging statistical problem, with the sample complexity growing quadratically (or worse) with the horizon . Long horizons (or, equivalently, large discount factors) also increase RL’s computational burden, leading to slow optimization convergence . This makes RL algorithms require prohibitively large amounts of interactions and compute: even with tuned hyperparameters, AlphaStar needed over 108superscript10810^{8} samples and OpenAI Five needed over 107superscript10710^{7} PFLOPS of compute. A popular approach to mitigate the statistical and computational issues of tabula rasa RL methods is to warm-start or regularize learning with prior knowledge  [ref]6     [ref]9 0.\nFor instance, AlphaStar learned a policy and value function from human demonstrations and regularized the RL agent using imitation learning (IL).\nAWAC [ref]9 warm-started a policy using batch policy optimization on exploratory datasets.\nWhile these approaches have been effective in different domains, none of them explicitly address RL’s complexity dependence on horizon. In this paper, we propose a complementary regularization\ntechnique that relies on heuristic value functions, or heuristics111We borrow this terminology from the planning literature to refer to guesses of V∗superscript𝑉V^{*} in an MDP 1.  for short, to effectively shorten the problem horizon faced by an online RL agent for fast learning.\nWe call this approach Heuristic-Guided Reinforcement Learning (HuRL). The core idea is simple: given a Markov decision process (MDP) ℳ=(SS,𝒜,P,r,γ)ℳSS𝒜𝑃𝑟𝛾\\mathcal{M}=(\\SS,\\mathcal{A},P,r,\\gamma) and a heuristic h:SS→ℝ:ℎ→SSℝh:\\SS\\to\\mathbb{R}, we select a mixing coefficient λ∈[ref]0 𝜆01\\lambda\\in[ref]0  and have the agent solve a new MDP ℳ~=(SS,𝒜,P,r~,γ~)~ℳSS𝒜𝑃~𝑟~𝛾\\widetilde{\\mathcal{M}}=(\\SS,\\mathcal{A},P,\\widetilde{r},\\widetilde{\\gamma}) with a reshaped reward and a smaller discount (i.e. a shorter horizon): HuRL effectively introduces horizon-based regularization that determines whether long-term value information should come from collected experiences or the heuristic.\nBy modulating the effective horizon via λ𝜆\\lambda, we trade off the bias and the complexity of solving the reshaped MDP. HuRL with λ=1𝜆1\\lambda=1 recovers the original problem and with λ=0𝜆0\\lambda=0 creates an easier contextual bandit problem 2. A heuristic hℎh in HuRL represents a prior guess of the desired long-term return of states, which ideally is the optimal value function V∗superscript𝑉V^{*} of the unknown MDP ℳℳ\\mathcal{M}.\nWhen the heuristic hℎh captures the state ordering of V∗superscript𝑉V^{*} well, conceptually, it becomes possible to make good long-term decisions by short-horizon planning or even acting greedily.\nHow do we construct a good heuristic? In the planning literature, this is typically achieved by solving a relaxation of the original problem 3 4 5. Alternatively, one can learn it from batch data collected by exploratory behavioral policies (as in offline RL 6) or from expert policies (as in IL 7).222We consider the RL setting for imitation where we suppose the rewards of expert trajectories are available.\nFor some dense reward problems, a zero heuristic can be effective in reducing RL complexity, as exploited by the guidance discount framework 8 9 0 1 2 3.\nIn this paper, we view heuristics as a unified representation of various forms of prior knowledge, such as expert demonstrations, exploratory datasets, and engineered guidance. Although the use of heuristics to accelerate search has been popular in planning and control algorithms, e.g., A* 4, MCTS 5, and MPC 6  7 8, its theory is less developed for settings where the MDP is unknown.\nThe closest work in RL is potential-based reward shaping (PBRS) 9, which reshapes the reward into r¯​(s,a)=r​(s,a)+γ​𝔼s′|s,a​[h​(s′)]−h​(s)¯𝑟𝑠𝑎𝑟𝑠𝑎𝛾subscript𝔼conditionalsuperscript𝑠′𝑠𝑎delimited-[]ℎsuperscript𝑠′ℎ𝑠\\bar{r}(s,a)=r(s,a)+\\gamma\\mathbb{E}_{s^{\\prime}|s,a}[h(s^{\\prime})]-h(s) while keeping the original discount.\nPBRS can use any heuristic to reshape the reward while preserving the ordering of policies.\nHowever, giving PBRS rewards to an RL algorithm does not necessarily lead to faster learning, because the base RL algorithm would still seek to explore to resolve long-term credit assignment.\nHuRL allows common RL algorithms to leverage the short-horizon potential provided by a heuristic to learn faster.\n In this work, we provide a theoretical foundation of HuRL to enable adopting heuristics and horizon reduction for accelerating RL, combining advances from the PBRS and the guidance discount literatures.\nOn the theoretical side, we derive a bias-variance decomposition of HuRL’s horizon-based regularization in order to characterize the solution quality as a function of λ𝜆\\lambda and hℎh.\nUsing this insight, we provide sufficient conditions for achieving an effective trade-off, including properties required of a base RL algorithm that solves the reshaped MDP ℳ~λsubscript~ℳ𝜆\\widetilde{\\mathcal{M}}_{\\lambda}.\nFurthermore, we define the novel concept of an improvable heuristic and prove that good heuristics for HuRL can be constructed from data using existing pessimistic offline RL algorithms (such as pessimistic value iteration 0 1). The effectiveness of HuRL depends on the heuristic quality, so we design HuRL to employ a sequence of mixing coefficients (i.e. λ𝜆\\lambdas) that increases as the agent gathers more data from the environment.\nSuch a strategy induces a learning curriculum that enables HuRL to remain robust to non-ideal heuristics.\nHuRL starts off by guiding the agent’s search direction with a heuristic. As the agent becomes more experienced, it gradually removes the guidance and lets the agent directly optimize the true long-term return.\nWe empirically validate HuRL in MuJoCo 2 robotics control problems and Procgen games 3 with various heuristics and base RL algorithms.\nThe experimental results demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of HuRL in accelerating RL algorithms.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: PFLOPS of compute.
