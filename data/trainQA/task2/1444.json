This is polynomial-time equivalent to the problem of finding the barycenter with smallest sparsity. Indeed an answer to the latter problem is an answer to the former, and an algorithm for the former problem gives an answer to the latter by running the algorithm on all N⩽n​k−k+1𝑁𝑛𝑘𝑘1N\\leqslant nk-k+1 (since there always exists a barycenter with sparsity n​k−k+1𝑛𝑘𝑘1nk-k+1 ). Wasserstein barycenter is 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hard, even in the setting of k=3𝑘3k=3 uniform measures in dimension d=2𝑑2d=2 . The key difference from the results in the present paper is that the results of  apply to the problem of finding the sparsest barycenter, and do not imply 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hardness of finding a barycenter with sparsity that is polynomial in the input size, which is typically the goal in applications. For example, for the setting of k=3𝑘3k=3 measures, while the result of  shows 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hardness of finding a barycenter with sparsity n𝑛n, a barycenter with sparsity O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) can be found in poly​(n,log⁡U)poly𝑛𝑈\\mathrm{poly}(n,\\log U) time by using off-the-shelf LP solvers on the MOT formulation of the Wasserstein barycenter problem  . Similarly, for any fixed dimension d⩾2𝑑2d\\geqslant 2, while the result of  shows 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hardness of finding a barycenter with sparsity n𝑛n, a barycenter with sparsity O​(n​k)𝑂𝑛𝑘O(nk) can be found in poly​(n,k,log⁡U)poly𝑛𝑘𝑈\\mathrm{poly}(n,k,\\log U) time for arbitrary k𝑘k [ref]4.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hardness of finding a barycenter with sparsity n𝑛n, a barycenter with sparsity O​(n​k)𝑂𝑛𝑘O(nk) can be found in poly​(n,k,log⁡U)poly𝑛𝑘𝑈\\mathrm{poly}(n,k,\\log U) time for arbitrary k𝑘k [ref]4.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
