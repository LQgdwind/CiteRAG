      "content": "Paper Title: Hard Sample Aware Noise Robust Learning for Histopathology Image Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare our methods with the following methods using the same network architecture. SELF[ref]41 (Duc Tam Nguyen et al. 2020) first obtains the self-ensemble predictions of all training samples and then progressively removes samples whose ensemble predictions do not agree with their annotated labels . DM (Junnan Li et al. 2020) lets its two-component and one-dimensional Gaussian mixture model be fitted to the training loss to obtain the confidence of an annotated label. By setting a confidence threshold, the training data is categorized into a labeled set and an unlabeled set. Subsequently, MixMatch [ref]44 is employed to train a DNN for the transformed data. INCV[ref]20 (Pengfei Chen et al. 2019) randomly divides noisy training data and then employs cross-validation to classify true-labeled samples while removing large-loss samples at each training round. Joint (Tanaka et al. 2018) jointly optimizes the sample labels and the network parameters. Co-tea. (Han et al. 2018) maintains two networks. Each network selects samples of small training loss from the mini-batches and feeds them to the other network. NF-Net (Zhantao Cao et al. 2020) adopts a double-softmax classification module to prevent deep models from overfitting the noisy labels and a teacher-student module to strengthen the effect of clean labels. OUSM (Cheng Xue et al. 2019) proposes online uncertainty sample mining and individual re-weighting methods to train their network. Among them, work 1) to 5) are the state-of-the-art methods for general noisy data processing in recent years; work 6) and work 7) are the state-of-the-art methods proposed for medical data scenarios. We choose these schemes to contrast with to fully prove the superiority of our method. The testings of 2) to 6) are based on the open-source codes from the authors. We re-implemented and tested 1) and 7) based on the settings from the original papers. For experiments on medical scenarios datasets, Table 1 and Table 2 shows the test ACC, AUC, F1 Score, Precision, Recall on DigestPath2019 and Camelyon16 with different levels of label noise ranging from 10% to 40%. Our method almost outperforms the state-of-the-art methods across all noise ratios. Table 3 shows these metrics on the Chaoyang dataset. Our method outperforms all other methods by a large margin in every criterion. For experiments on natural computer vision datasets, Table 4 shows the test ACC, AUC, F1 Score, Precision, Recall on CIFAR-10 with different levels and different types of label noise ranging from 20% to 80%. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods across all noise ratios. Table 5 shows these metrics on Webvision dataset. Our method consistently outperforms all other methods. Besides, we show the mean ROC curves of all five datasets in Fig. 6.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: We compare our methods with the following methods using the same network architecture.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
