(Lemma 13 in [ref]23)\n\nDenote λ=λm​i​n​(𝐇¯)𝜆subscript𝜆𝑚𝑖𝑛¯𝐇\\lambda=\\lambda_{min}(\\bar{\\bm{H}}). Set m=Ω​(λ−2​n2​log⁡(n/δ))𝑚Ωsuperscript𝜆2superscript𝑛2𝑛𝛿m=\\Omega(\\lambda^{-2}n^{2}\\log(n/\\delta)).\nAssume 𝐰0r∼𝒩​(0,Id)similar-tosuperscriptsubscript𝐰0𝑟𝒩0subscript𝐼𝑑\\mathbf{w}_{0}^{r}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,I_{d}) for all r∈[n]𝑟delimited-[]𝑛r\\in[n].\nWith probability at least 1−δ1𝛿1-\\delta, it holds that As a result, the condition number of 𝐇0subscript𝐇0\\bm{H}_{0} is bounded by Now we turn to analyzing the second term on the right-hand side of (25), which is also composed by the product of the matrix power 𝐌isuperscript𝐌𝑖\\mathbf{M}^{i} and a bounded vector.\nThen it only needs to bound the norm of 𝝁𝝁\\bm{\\mu}.\nUsing the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, it has ‖𝝁t‖≤‖ϕt‖+‖𝝍t‖normsubscript𝝁𝑡normsubscriptbold-italic-ϕ𝑡normsubscript𝝍𝑡\\|\\bm{\\mu}_{t}\\|\\leq\\|\\bm{\\phi}_{t}\\|+\\|\\bm{\\psi}_{t}\\|. From (21), we observe that the bound of |ϕt​[i]|subscriptbold-italic-ϕ𝑡delimited-[]𝑖|\\bm{\\phi}_{t}[i]| mainly depends on the term |Si⟂|superscriptsubscript𝑆𝑖perpendicular-to|S_{i}^{\\perp}|, which describes how many neurons change their activation patterns on the i𝑖i-th instance during training.\nAccording to recent studies [ref]16 [ref]21,\n|Si⟂|superscriptsubscript𝑆𝑖perpendicular-to|S_{i}^{\\perp}| has an upper bound 4​m​R4𝑚𝑅4mR, which is determined by the distance R𝑅R between 𝐰trsubscriptsuperscript𝐰𝑟𝑡\\mathbf{w}^{r}_{t} and its initialization for any r∈[m]𝑟delimited-[]𝑚r\\in[m] and t∈[T]𝑡delimited-[]𝑇t\\in[T].\nIn D, Lemma 5 presents the details.\nWhen R𝑅R is small enough, it has |Si⟂|≪mmuch-less-thansuperscriptsubscript𝑆𝑖perpendicular-to𝑚|S_{i}^{\\perp}|\\ll m. On the other hand, the bound of ‖𝝍t‖normsubscript𝝍𝑡\\|\\bm{\\psi}_{t}\\| is closely related to the distance between 𝑯tsubscript𝑯𝑡\\bm{H}_{t} and 𝑯0subscript𝑯0\\bm{H}_{0}.\nPrevious works [ref]16 [ref]21 showed that the upper bound of ‖𝑯t−𝑯0‖normsubscript𝑯𝑡subscript𝑯0\\|\\bm{H}_{t}-\\bm{H}_{0}\\| is also determined by the distance R𝑅R,\nwhere Lemma 6 in D gives the details. In Theorem 1, we derive R=𝒪​(1/m)𝑅𝒪1𝑚R=\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{m}), which helps control the size of ‖ϕt‖normsubscriptbold-italic-ϕ𝑡\\|\\bm{\\phi}_{t}\\| and ‖𝝍t‖normsubscript𝝍𝑡\\|\\bm{\\psi}_{t}\\| with an appropriate m𝑚m.\nThe corresponding bounds for R𝑅R, ‖ϕ‖normbold-italic-ϕ\\|\\bm{\\phi}\\| and ‖𝝍‖norm𝝍\\|\\bm{\\psi}\\| are given in the proof of Theorem 1.\nFinally, we introduce our main result on the convergence of NAG.

For every r∈[m]𝑟delimited-[]𝑚r\\in[m], we have Remark 1. With the initialization 𝐖−1=𝐖0subscript𝐖1subscript𝐖0\\mathbf{W}_{-1}=\\mathbf{W}_{0}, it has 𝝃−1=𝝃0subscript𝝃1subscript𝝃0\\bm{\\xi}_{-1}=\\bm{\\xi}_{0}.\nThus, according to Theorem 1, the training error 𝝃tsubscript𝝃𝑡\\bm{\\xi}_{t} of NAG converges linearly to zero at a (1−12​κ)tsuperscript112𝜅𝑡(1-\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\kappa}})^{t} rate after t𝑡t iteration, which indicates NAG is able to achieve the global minimum as GD and HB. Remark 2. As shown in [ref]16, GD converges at a rate (1−η​λ2)tsuperscript1𝜂𝜆2𝑡(1-{\\frac{\\eta\\lambda}{2}})^{t}, but with a small learning rate η=𝒪​(λn2)𝜂𝒪𝜆superscript𝑛2\\eta=\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{\\lambda}{n^{2}}).\n further improved the bound of the learning rate to 𝒪​(1‖𝑯¯‖)𝒪1norm¯𝑯\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{\\|{\\bar{\\bm{H}}}\\|}), where ‖𝑯¯‖≤nnorm¯𝑯𝑛\\|{\\bar{\\bm{H}}}\\|\\leq n and provides an 𝒪​(λ/n)𝒪𝜆𝑛\\mathcal{O}(\\lambda/n) improvement.\nThis results in a faster convergence rate (1−Θ​(1/κ))tsuperscript1Θ1𝜅𝑡(1-\\Theta(1/\\kappa))^{t} for GD.\nAs shown in Theorem 1, NAG obtains a smaller convergence rate (1−Θ​(1/κ))tsuperscript1Θ1𝜅𝑡(1-\\Theta(1/\\sqrt{\\kappa}))^{t}, which validates its acceleration over GD.\nMoreover, compard to the convergence rate of HB as proved in [ref]23,\nour results show that NAG obtains a comparable convergence rate. Remark 3. The initial residual error satisfies ‖𝝃0‖2=𝒪​(n​l​o​g​(m/δ)​l​o​g2​(n/δ))superscriptnormsubscript𝝃02𝒪𝑛𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑚𝛿𝑙𝑜superscript𝑔2𝑛𝛿\\|\\bm{\\xi}_{0}\\|^{2}=\\mathcal{O}(nlog(m/\\delta)log^{2}(n/\\delta)) as shown in Lemma 7.\nTherefore, the upper bound R𝑅R of ‖𝐰tr−𝐰0r‖normsuperscriptsubscript𝐰𝑡𝑟superscriptsubscript𝐰0𝑟\\|\\mathbf{w}_{t}^{r}-\\mathbf{w}_{0}^{r}\\| scales as 𝒪​(1/m)𝒪1𝑚\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{m}) for any r∈[m]𝑟delimited-[]𝑚r\\in[m] according to (30).\nThis is consistent with the NTK regime that the parameter is hardly changed when the neural network is over-parameterized.\nMoreover, the number of the changed activation patterns is bounded by |Si⟂|=|∑r=1m𝕀{⟨𝐰tr,𝐱i⟩}≠𝕀{⟨𝐰0r,𝐱i⟩}|≤4mR|S_{i}^{\\perp}|=|\\sum_{r=1}^{m}\\mathbb{I}\\{\\langle\\mathbf{w}_{t}^{r},\\mathbf{x}_{i}\\rangle\\}\\neq\\mathbb{I}\\{\\langle\\mathbf{w}_{0}^{r},\\mathbf{x}_{i}\\rangle\\}|\\leq 4mR according to Lemma 5.\nAs a result, ∑i∈[n]|Si⟂|/(m​n)subscript𝑖delimited-[]𝑛superscriptsubscript𝑆𝑖perpendicular-to𝑚𝑛\\sum_{i\\in[n]}|S_{i}^{\\perp}|/(mn) can be upper bounded with 4​R4𝑅4R, which also scales with 𝒪​(1/m)𝒪1𝑚\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{m}).\nOn the other hand, GD has R=𝒪​(nλ​m​‖𝝃0‖)𝑅𝒪𝑛𝜆𝑚normsubscript𝝃0R=\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{\\lambda\\sqrt{m}}\\|\\bm{\\xi}_{0}\\|) according to [ref]16, which is smaller than NAG due to κ>1𝜅1\\kappa>1.\nFurthermore, R𝑅R of HB scales as 𝒪​(n​κλ​m​‖𝝃0‖)𝒪𝑛𝜅𝜆𝑚normsubscript𝝃0\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{\\sqrt{n\\kappa}}{\\lambda\\sqrt{m}}\\|\\bm{\\xi}_{0}\\|) [ref]23, which is similar as NAG.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: an over-parameterized neural network, the eigenvalues of the random matrix 𝑯0subscript𝑯0\\bm{H}_{0} can be bounded by the spectrum of the deterministic NTK matrix 𝑯¯¯𝑯\\bar{\\bm{H}} [ref]23, thereby allowing us to determine the hyperparameters with specific values.
