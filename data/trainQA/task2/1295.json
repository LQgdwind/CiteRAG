      "content": "Paper Title: LCS Graph Kernel Based on Wasserstein Distance in Longest Common Subsequence Metric Space\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor graph classification tasks, Graph Kernel methods have been used widely for several decades. They are also developing rapidly in recent years. Graph kernels are kernel functions that compute the similarity between two graphs. Graph kernel methods have shown effective performances in graph classification tasks using machine learning algorithms. In recent years, as effective performances of optimal transport theory in a machine learning domain, Graph Kernel methods are also improved greatly when combined with optimal transport theory. For now, Graph Kernel methods can be generally divided into two categories as methods of (1) Traditional Graph Kernel and (2) OT-based Graph Kernel. The first of those classifications of methods include traditional Graph Kernels, most of which are based on the ‚Ñõ‚Ñõ\\mathcal{R}-convolution framework [ref]3. To compute the similarity between graphs in various data mining tasks, the random walk kernel  has been developed and used widely as an important tool for graph classification. This method is based on the counting of matching random walks in two graphs with a label or not. However, the random walk kernel faces a difficulty by which the computational cost is O‚Äã(n6)ùëÇsuperscriptùëõ6O(n^{6}) for comparing a pair of graphs in graph product space, which is a non-negligible cost, especially for large-scale graphs. To resolve this difficulty, the use of the shortest path kernel  has been proposed. That method specifically examines a smaller set of shortest paths rather than random walks. Subsequent work on Weisfeiler‚ÄìLehman (WL) Graph Kernel  has brought great success. They proposed a Graph Kernel with a similarity metric based on Weisfeiler‚ÄìLehman test. Although this method yields attractive performance, it still presents difficulties of breadth-first strategies and ‚Ñõ‚Ñõ\\mathcal{R}-convolution methods as described in the Introduction section. To provide a more valid notion of similarity of decomposite graph structure, related work [ref]29 proposed an optimal assignment kernel variant from Weisfeiler‚ÄìLehman Graph Kernel, which is Weisfeiler‚ÄìLehman Optimal Assignment (WL-OA) kernel. This kernel is based on an optimal bijection between parts of two graphs, which brings a better and more robust performance compared to the WL kernel. The second class includes Graph Kernels combined with optimal transport theory. Recent research  presents the Wasserstein-based Weisfeiler‚ÄìLehman Graph Kernel (WWL), which maps node embedding of a Weisfeiler‚ÄìLehman pattern to feature space and which computes kernel values using the Wasserstein distance of two point clouds in the feature space. They received better results than those yielded by the original Weisfeiler‚ÄìLehman kernel. GOT [ref]30 uses optimal transport differently to compute the Wasserstein distance between two normal distributions derived by graph Laplacian matrices instead of generating walks or comparing vertex neighbors in graphs. Another report of recent work  raises difficulties that both the Wasserstein distance and the Gromov‚ÄìWasserstein distance are unable to accommodate the graph structure and feature information. To resolve this difficulty, they propose a notion of Fused Gromov‚ÄìWasserstein (FGW) distance, which considers both structure characteristics and feature information of two graphs. To reduce computation costs for Wasserstein-distance-based Graph Kernel and to generate a graph embedding based on Wasserstein distance, related work  proposes a new method that successfully embeds graphs into Euclidean space to compute approximate Wasserstein distance. Aside from Graph Kernels, Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have also become a very hot topic in graph classification, node (link) prediction, and so on. A representative method of GNN in recent years is the Graph Convolution Network (GCN) , which is inspired by Convolution Neural Network (CNN) in computer vision. Another representative GNN is the Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) . The GIN is based on a similar idea to Graph Kernels which specifically examines graph isomorphism. They prove the SUM aggregation to be a better aggregation scheme in message-passing of graphs and apply it in GIN, which has powerful performance in graph classification.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Graph Kernel and (2) OT-based Graph Kernel.
