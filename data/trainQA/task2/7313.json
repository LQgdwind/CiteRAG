      "content": "Paper Title: Beyond the Spell: A Dynamic Logic Analysis of Misdirection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe language presented herein is an adaptation of the Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL) for (in)attentive agents [ref]24, that generalizes .\nThroughout the text, let 𝖯𝗋𝗈𝗉𝖯𝗋𝗈𝗉\\mathsf{Prop} be a countable set of propositional symbols, 𝖠𝗀𝗍𝖠𝗀𝗍\\mathsf{Agt} a finite set of agent symbols, and 𝖮𝖻𝗌={oa​p,oa​¬p∣a∈𝖠𝗀𝗍,p∈𝖯𝗋𝗈𝗉}𝖮𝖻𝗌conditional-setsubscripto𝑎𝑝subscripto𝑎𝑝formulae-sequence𝑎𝖠𝗀𝗍𝑝𝖯𝗋𝗈𝗉\\mathsf{Obs}=\\{\\textsf{o}_{a}{p},\\textsf{o}_{a}{\\neg p}\\mid a\\in\\mathsf{Agt},\\ p\\in\\mathsf{Prop}\\} a set of observation symbols. We read oa​psubscripto𝑎𝑝\\textsf{o}_{a}{p} (respectively oa​¬psubscripto𝑎𝑝\\textsf{o}_{a}{\\neg p}) as “agent a𝑎a observes that p𝑝p (respectively ¬p𝑝\\neg p) is the case”. Notice that in [ref]24, similar symbols are used to state that an agent is paying attention to a certain atomic proposition.\nWe start by introducing the models we will use for interpreting our logic. A relational (Kripke) model is a tuple ℳ=⟨W,{Ra}a∈𝖠𝗀𝗍,V⟩ℳ𝑊subscriptsubscript𝑅𝑎𝑎𝖠𝗀𝗍𝑉\\mathcal{M}=\\langle W,\\{R_{a}\\}_{a\\in\\mathsf{Agt}},V\\rangle where: W𝑊W is a non-empty set of possible worlds; Ra⊆W×Wsubscript𝑅𝑎𝑊𝑊R_{a}\\subseteq W\\times W; V:𝖯𝗋𝗈𝗉∪𝖮𝖻𝗌→2W:𝑉→𝖯𝗋𝗈𝗉𝖮𝖻𝗌superscript2𝑊V:\\mathsf{Prop}\\cup\\mathsf{Obs}\\rightarrow 2^{W} is a valuation function. Let w∈W𝑤𝑊w\\in W, we call the pair (ℳ,w)ℳ𝑤(\\mathcal{M},w) a pointed model, with parentheses usually dropped. Sometimes we will use R𝑅R to denote {Ra}a∈𝖠𝗀𝗍subscriptsubscript𝑅𝑎𝑎𝖠𝗀𝗍\\{R_{a}\\}_{a\\in\\mathsf{Agt}}. Below we introduce a particular class of models that turns out to be interesting in the rest of the paper. Intuitively, in this class, we force the relations Rasubscript𝑅𝑎R_{a} to have the classical properties of belief. For observations,\nwe need to impose conditions to guarantee that they are consistent.\nWe will come back to this point later on the paper, after presenting the whole framework. We define the class of observational epistemic models as the set of all the pointed models ℳ,wℳ𝑤\\mathcal{M},w such that ℳ=⟨W,{Ra}a∈𝖠𝗀𝗍,V⟩ℳ𝑊subscriptsubscript𝑅𝑎𝑎𝖠𝗀𝗍𝑉\\mathcal{M}=\\langle W,\\{R_{a}\\}_{a\\in\\mathsf{Agt}},V\\rangle, w∈W𝑤𝑊w\\in W, and where: each binary relation Rasubscript𝑅𝑎R_{a} is Euclidean, transitive and serial; and for all p∈𝖯𝗋𝗈𝗉𝑝𝖯𝗋𝗈𝗉p\\in\\mathsf{Prop} and a∈𝖠𝗀𝗍𝑎𝖠𝗀𝗍a\\in\\mathsf{Agt}, w∈V​(oa​p)𝑤𝑉subscripto𝑎𝑝w\\in V(\\textsf{o}_{a}{p}) implies w∉V​(oa​¬p)𝑤𝑉subscripto𝑎𝑝w\\notin V(\\textsf{o}_{a}{\\neg p}). At this point, a distinction to make concerns the models used for (in)attentive agents in [ref]24 and the ones we use here. In the original framework, for each propositional symbol p𝑝p, and each agent a𝑎a, there is a special propositional symbol 𝗁a​psubscript𝗁𝑎𝑝\\mathsf{h}_{a}p, such that it labels a world if the agent a𝑎a is attentive to symbol p𝑝p at such a world. Here, these extra symbols are no longer indicating “attentiveness”, but they indicate that agent a𝑎a is observing a certain fact p𝑝p. So, we introduce two symbols instead of one: oa​psubscripto𝑎𝑝\\textsf{o}_{a}{p} to indicate that the agent observes that p𝑝p is the case, and oa​¬psubscripto𝑎𝑝\\textsf{o}_{a}{\\neg p} to indicate that the agent observes that p𝑝p is false. As you can notice, oa​psubscripto𝑎𝑝\\textsf{o}_{a}{p} being false is not the same as oa​¬psubscripto𝑎𝑝\\textsf{o}_{a}{\\neg p} being true; they can be both false, but they cannot be true at the same time. Finally, notice that each relation Rasubscript𝑅𝑎R_{a} is Euclidean, transitive and serial, i.e., has the usual properties of belief . The actions of misdirection performed by some agent(s) will be represented via standard tools of Dynamic Epistemic Logic: the so called action models .\nRecall that action models are objects describing semantically the intended effects that an agent wants to perform over an epistemic situation (i.e., over a model). They can be used as parameters in formulas of the language, in particular, inside a dynamic modality. In a nutshell, dynamic modalities perform updates in the current model, in this case depending on the semantic description given by an action model. When interpreting the dynamic modality, the action models tell us how to update the original model, raising a new epistemic situation.\nNotice that, as usual, action models and the language are defined by mutual recursion in Definitions 3 and 4, and rely on a lower step of the inductive definition. An action model is a tuple 𝐀=⟨E,{→a}a∈𝖠𝗀𝗍,Phys.Rev.E,𝗉𝗈𝗌𝗍⟩\\mathbf{A}=\\langle E,\\{\\rightarrow_{a}\\}_{a\\in\\mathsf{Agt}},{\\rm Phys.~{}Rev.~{}E},\\mathsf{post}\\rangle, where: E𝐸E is non-empty finite set of epistemic actions that, conceptually, can be either of verbal or visual type; →a⊆E×E\\rightarrow_{a}\\subseteq E\\times E, for each a∈𝖠𝗀𝗍𝑎𝖠𝗀𝗍a\\in\\mathsf{Agt}, is Euclidean, transitive and serial; Phys.Rev.E:E→𝗗𝗟𝗠{\\rm Phys.~{}Rev.~{}E}:E\\rightarrow\\boldsymbol{\\mathsf{DLM}} is the precondition function, where 𝗗𝗟𝗠𝗗𝗟𝗠\\boldsymbol{\\mathsf{DLM}} is the language given by Definition 4; and 𝗉𝗈𝗌𝗍:E→(𝖯𝗋𝗈𝗉∪𝖮𝖻𝗌)→𝗗𝗟𝗠:𝗉𝗈𝗌𝗍→𝐸𝖯𝗋𝗈𝗉𝖮𝖻𝗌→𝗗𝗟𝗠\\mathsf{post}:E\\rightarrow(\\mathsf{Prop}\\cup\\mathsf{Obs})\\rightarrow\\boldsymbol{\\mathsf{DLM}} is the postcondition function, and it is such that for all e𝑒e and oa​psubscripto𝑎𝑝\\textsf{o}_{a}{p}, 𝗉𝗈𝗌𝗍​(e)​(oa​p)=⊤𝗉𝗈𝗌𝗍𝑒subscripto𝑎𝑝top\\mathsf{post}(e)(\\textsf{o}_{a}{p})=\\top implies that 𝗉𝗈𝗌𝗍​(e)​(oa​¬p)=⊤𝗉𝗈𝗌𝗍𝑒subscripto𝑎𝑝top\\mathsf{post}(e)(\\textsf{o}_{a}{\\neg p})=\\top is not the case. Let e∈E𝑒𝐸e\\in E, we call (𝐀,e)𝐀𝑒(\\mathbf{A},e) a pointed action model, again with parentheses usually dropped. Sometimes we use →→\\rightarrow to indicate {→a}a∈𝖠𝗀𝗍subscriptsubscript→𝑎𝑎𝖠𝗀𝗍\\{\\rightarrow_{a}\\}_{a\\in\\mathsf{Agt}}. It is worth to notice that in the definition of action models above, we consider postconditions on them. This is another difference with the setting of [ref]24. Although this variant does not add expressive power, it becomes handy to define our actions of verbal and visual misdirection in a more clear way. The postconditions are also required to update the models consistently. In the next definition, we make precise the syntax of our dynamic logic of misdirection. The set of well-formed formulas of the language 𝗗𝗟𝗠𝗗𝗟𝗠\\boldsymbol{\\mathsf{DLM}} is given by the following Backus-Naur Form: where p∈𝖯𝗋𝗈𝗉𝑝𝖯𝗋𝗈𝗉p\\in\\mathsf{Prop}; a∈𝖠𝗀𝗍𝑎𝖠𝗀𝗍a\\in\\mathsf{Agt}; {oa​p,oa​¬p}⊆𝖮𝖻𝗌subscripto𝑎𝑝subscripto𝑎𝑝𝖮𝖻𝗌\\{\\textsf{o}_{a}{p},\\textsf{o}_{a}{\\neg p}\\}\\subseteq\\mathsf{Obs}; and 𝐀,e𝐀𝑒\\mathbf{A},e is a pointed action model, whose preconditions and postconditions are defined in a lower level of the recursive definition. Other Boolean connectives are defined as usual. We define the following abbreviations: ℬ^a​φ:=¬ℬa​¬φassignsubscript^ℬ𝑎𝜑subscriptℬ𝑎𝜑\\hat{\\mathcal{B}}_{a}\\varphi:=\\neg\\mathcal{B}_{a}\\neg\\varphi; and ⟨𝐀,e⟩​φ:=¬[𝐀,e]​¬φassign𝐀𝑒𝜑𝐀𝑒𝜑\\langle\\mathbf{A},e\\rangle\\varphi:=\\neg[\\mathbf{A},e]\\neg\\varphi.\nThe set of literals is defined as 𝖫𝗂𝗍={ℓ∣ℓ∈𝖯𝗋𝗈𝗉​ or ​ℓ=¬p​ with ​p∈𝖯𝗋𝗈𝗉}𝖫𝗂𝗍conditional-setℓℓ𝖯𝗋𝗈𝗉 or ℓ𝑝 with 𝑝𝖯𝗋𝗈𝗉\\mathsf{Lit}=\\{\\ell\\mid\\ell\\in\\mathsf{Prop}\\mbox{ or }\\ell=\\neg p\\mbox{ with }p\\in\\mathsf{Prop}\\}. If ℓ=¬pℓ𝑝\\ell=\\neg p, we use sometimes ¬ℓℓ\\neg\\ell to denote p𝑝p; and use oa​¬ℓsubscripto𝑎ℓ\\textsf{o}_{a}{\\neg\\ell} to denote oa​psubscripto𝑎𝑝\\textsf{o}_{a}{p}.\nFinally, we define the fragment 𝗢𝗟𝗢𝗟\\boldsymbol{\\mathsf{OL}} to be the language generated from 𝗗𝗟𝗠𝗗𝗟𝗠\\boldsymbol{\\mathsf{DLM}} when we remove formulas of the form [𝐀,e]​φ𝐀𝑒𝜑[\\mathbf{A},e]\\varphi. The modalities introduced in the BNF above should be read as follows. Formula ℬa​φsubscriptℬ𝑎𝜑\\mathcal{B}_{a}\\varphi means ‘agent a𝑎a believes that φ𝜑\\varphi holds’. Remind that beliefs here can result from any kind of sensory perception, except by visual perception. Its dual is ℬ^a​φsubscript^ℬ𝑎𝜑\\hat{\\mathcal{B}}_{a}\\varphi meaning ‘φ𝜑\\varphi is believable for agent a𝑎a’.\nContrary to beliefs, observations only result from visual perception in our setting. Here, by taking inspiration from [ref]24, observations are not epistemic but factual. Thus, they are represented by special atomic propositions: oa​psubscripto𝑎𝑝\\textsf{o}_{a}{p} indicates that agent a𝑎a observes that p𝑝p is the case, while oa​¬psubscripto𝑎𝑝\\textsf{o}_{a}{\\neg p} states that agent a𝑎a observes that p𝑝p is not the case.\nWe provide the semantics of all formulas in Definition 6. Intuitively, beliefs are weak doxastic attitudes, or so-called prima facie beliefs. When agent a𝑎a believes that φ𝜑\\varphi, namely ℬa​φsubscriptℬ𝑎𝜑\\mathcal{B}_{a}\\varphi, agent a𝑎a may lack any justification for believing that φ𝜑\\varphi. In section 5, we use this notion of weak belief to define a notion of strong belief. Finally, dynamic formulas written [𝐀,e]​φ𝐀𝑒𝜑[\\mathbf{A},e]\\varphi are read as ‘after the action 𝐀,e𝐀𝑒\\mathbf{A},e is executed, φ𝜑\\varphi holds’, while its dual ⟨𝐀,e⟩​φ𝐀𝑒𝜑\\langle\\mathbf{A},e\\rangle\\varphi is read as ‘the action 𝐀,e𝐀𝑒\\mathbf{A},e is executable at the current situation and after its execution φ𝜑\\varphi will hold’. Now, we define how an action model affects an observational epistemic model, — thus modifying the beliefs and observations of a set of agents. In general, these actions may be seen as acts of communication between agents.\nThose acts can be verbal announcements or visual gesture, and either genuine or deceptive in both cases. As in usual settings, such communication can be public, private or semi-private, but might involve both verbal and visual information herein.\nMoreover, notice that in [ref]24 the communication acts are truthful, while here we introduce both truthful and untruthful actions as we want to consider different forms of misdirection. In addition, notice our action models are enriched with postconditions. A postcondition is, in a nutshell, a description of how certain facts change after an action. In our case, it will be very useful to change what at agent is observing to. Let ℳ=⟨W,R,V⟩ℳ𝑊𝑅𝑉\\mathcal{M}=\\langle W,R,V\\rangle be a relational model, and\nlet 𝐀=⟨E,→,Phys.Rev.E,𝗉𝗈𝗌𝗍⟩\\mathbf{A}=\\langle E,\\rightarrow,{\\rm Phys.~{}Rev.~{}E},\\mathsf{post}\\rangle be an action model, we define their product ℳ⊗𝐀=⟨W′,R′,V′⟩tensor-productℳ𝐀superscript𝑊′superscript𝑅′superscript𝑉′\\mathcal{M}\\otimes\\mathbf{A}=\\langle W^{\\prime},R^{\\prime},V^{\\prime}\\rangle, where: W′={(w,e)∈W×E∣ℳ,w⊧Phys.Rev.E​(e)}superscript𝑊′conditional-set𝑤𝑒𝑊𝐸formulae-sequencemodelsℳ𝑤PhysRevE𝑒W^{\\prime}=\\{(w,e)\\in W\\times E\\mid\\mathcal{M},w\\models{\\rm Phys.~{}Rev.~{}E}(e)\\}; (w,e)​Ra′​(v,f)𝑤𝑒subscriptsuperscript𝑅′𝑎𝑣𝑓(w,e)R^{\\prime}_{a}(v,f) if and only if w​Ra​v𝑤subscript𝑅𝑎𝑣wR_{a}v and e→afsubscript→𝑎𝑒𝑓e\\rightarrow_{a}f, for all a∈𝖠𝗀𝗍𝑎𝖠𝗀𝗍a\\in\\mathsf{Agt}; V′​(p)={(w,e)∣ℳ,w⊧𝗉𝗈𝗌𝗍​(e)​(p)}superscript𝑉′𝑝conditional-set𝑤𝑒modelsℳ𝑤𝗉𝗈𝗌𝗍𝑒𝑝V^{\\prime}(p)=\\{(w,e)\\mid\\mathcal{M},w\\models\\mathsf{post}(e)(p)\\}. With all these definitions at hand, we are now able to define the semantics of 𝗗𝗟𝗠𝗗𝗟𝗠\\boldsymbol{\\mathsf{DLM}}. Let ℳ=⟨W,R,V⟩ℳ𝑊𝑅𝑉\\mathcal{M}=\\langle W,R,V\\rangle be a model, and let w∈W𝑤𝑊w\\in W. The satisfaction relation ⊧models\\models between ℳ,wℳ𝑤\\mathcal{M},w and formulas φ𝜑\\varphi is defined as follows: A formula φ𝜑\\varphi is satisfiable if there exists a pointed model ℳ,wℳ𝑤\\mathcal{M},w such that ℳ,w⊧φmodelsℳ𝑤𝜑\\mathcal{M},w\\models\\varphi, and it is valid if ℳ,w⊧φmodelsℳ𝑤𝜑\\mathcal{M},w\\models\\varphi, for all pointed models ℳ,wℳ𝑤\\mathcal{M},w. The dual modality ⟨𝐀,e⟩𝐀𝑒\\langle\\mathbf{A},e\\rangle is interpreted as: Let us discuss some observations we can make after an action has been executed. In this work, we are interested in particular informational actions, modeling the fact that some agent a𝑎a is performing an informative act, updating the beliefs and observations of the rest of the agents, without altering her own. To do so, the action model representing this act will have a total relation for agent a𝑎a, thus it will not change her belief or observational information in the underlying model. Let 𝐀=⟨E,→,Phys.Rev.E,𝗉𝗈𝗌𝗍⟩\\mathbf{A}=\\langle E,\\rightarrow,{\\rm Phys.~{}Rev.~{}E},\\mathsf{post}\\rangle be an action model. We say that 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} is an informational action model for agent a𝑎a if →a=E×E\\rightarrow_{a}=E\\times E. If agent a𝑎a executes the action e𝑒e, this action does not change her own factual beliefs and visual observation of the environment. However, other agents’ beliefs and visual observations might change, but not necessarily though. This means that the agent can execute an action with some informational purposes but she cannot guarantee that this action may actually modify the other agents’ beliefs and/or visual observation. Consider the following example: a magician performs an action to misdirect the attention of a crowd of spectators. The magician knows that actual facts do not change during the trick, but what she does not know, and cannot guarantee, is whether the spectators will believe that actual facts did change. In other words, the magician cannot be sure that she succeeded at misdirecting the audience. Thus, what she cannot guarantee, is that she will keep her own high-order beliefs i.e., her beliefs about other agents’ own beliefs and observations.\nIn formula, for an informational action model 𝗍a=(𝐀,e)subscript𝗍𝑎𝐀𝑒\\mathsf{t}_{a}=(\\mathbf{A},e), we have that ℳ,w⊧ℬa​φmodelsℳ𝑤subscriptℬ𝑎𝜑\\mathcal{M},w\\models\\mathcal{B}_{a}\\varphi does not imply ℳ,w⊧[𝗍a]​ℬa​φmodelsℳ𝑤delimited-[]subscript𝗍𝑎subscriptℬ𝑎𝜑\\mathcal{M},w\\models[\\mathsf{t}_{a}]\\mathcal{B}_{a}\\varphi. Regarding the modelling of magic tricks, the difference between the approach based on Propositional Dynamic Logic (PDL) of  and the DEL approach of 𝗗𝗟𝗠𝗗𝗟𝗠\\boldsymbol{\\mathsf{DLM}} is the focus of interest. While both approaches rely on modelling epistemic notions, such as beliefs and expectations, to express states of deceptions, our goal with 𝗗𝗟𝗠𝗗𝗟𝗠\\boldsymbol{\\mathsf{DLM}} is to better understand the nature of misdirection, in particular visual misdirection, so the logic also encodes observations, as non-epistemic attitudes, and visual actions of observation, in addition to classical verbal announcements. By contrast,  puts more emphasis on the constructional aspects of conjuring magic.111Analyzing Martin Gardner’s Turnabout trick (see ) in that respect. They aim to express the various forms of impossibility spectators may experiment with magical effects, based on characterizing the evidence relationship between expected events and real occurring events (similarity, perceptual equivalence, structural equivalence, congruence). To some extent, however, our perspectives meet since, as we will see, 𝗗𝗟𝗠𝗗𝗟𝗠\\boldsymbol{\\mathsf{DLM}} is used in subsection 5.3 to express the sense of surprise in the French Drop trick.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: The language presented herein is an adaptation of the Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL) for (in)attentive agents [ref]24, that generalizes .\nThroughout the text, let 𝖯𝗋𝗈𝗉𝖯𝗋𝗈𝗉\\mathsf{Prop} be a countable set of propositional symbols, 𝖠𝗀𝗍𝖠𝗀𝗍\\mathsf{Agt} a finite set of agent symbols, and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
