      "content": "Paper Title: Symbol emergence as interpersonal cross-situational learning: the emergence of lexical knowledge with combinatoriality\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInterpersonal Dirichlet mixtures (Inter-DM) [ref]44 is proposed as a PGM for category formation and symbol emergence among agents. In Inter-DM as a multi-agent extension of MLDA , modalities in MLDA are interpreted as agents and categories shared among modalities are interpreted as words shared among agents. The study argues that the inference algorithm based on Metropolis-Hastings method [ref]43, which generates a word from the proposal distribution and decides whether to accept or reject the word based on the acceptance ratio, can be interpreted as a naming game proposed by Steels et al . Experiments targeting daily objects using two robots with visual modality demonstrated that words associated with object categories are shared among agents in Inter-DM. Interpersonal multimodal Dirichlet mixtures (Inter-MDM)  is a multimodal extension (i.e., vision, sound, and haptic) of Inter-DM with a single modality (i.e., vision). Experiments on symbol emergence among agents with different modalities demonstrated that the word exchange among agents improves the accuracy of categorization for each agent. Also, interpersonal cross-modal inference, in which Agent A proposes a word based on their own observation and Agent B predicts observations from the proposed word, was proposed in this study. However, because inter-MDM assumes a single word as a sign exchanged between agents, it cannot handle sentences composed of multiple words, as in human verbal communication. Inter-MDM-H2H  is a model that has been extended to handle word sets composed of multiple words. This model can generate word sets as a Bag of Words representation from multimodal sensory information. However, Inter-MDM-H2H could not handle the combinatoriality of words because it infers one integrated category from multimodal sensory information.\nFor example, it could not generate the word sequence of ”green cylinder” and its meaning by the combination of the words ”green” associated with the color category and ”cylinder” associated with the object category.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: Interpersonal Dirichlet mixtures (Inter-DM) [ref]44 is proposed as a PGM for category formation and symbol emergence among agents.
