      "content": "Paper Title: Upper Bounds for All and Max-gain Policy Iteration Algorithms on Deterministic MDPs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe briefly review results on the running time of PI, restricting ourselves to bounds that depend only on the number of states n≥2𝑛2n\\geq 2 and actions k≥2𝑘2k\\geq 2 in the input MDP. Arguably the most common variant from the PI family is Howard’s PI , under which Sswitch=S+​(π)subscript𝑆switchsuperscript𝑆𝜋S_{\\text{switch}}=S^{+}(\\pi). Mansour and Singh  show an upper bound of O​(kn/n)𝑂superscript𝑘𝑛𝑛O(k^{n}/n) iterations when Howard’s PI is coupled with arbitrary action selection; Taraviya and Kalyanakrishnan  obtain a tighter bound of (O​(k​log⁡k))nsuperscript𝑂𝑘𝑘𝑛\\left(O(\\sqrt{k\\log k})\\right)^{n} iterations when action selection is random. Mansour and Singh  also propose a randomised PI variant in which Sswitchsubscript𝑆switchS_{\\text{switch}} is chosen uniformly at random from among the non-empty subsets of S+​(π)superscript𝑆𝜋S^{+}(\\pi). They give an upper bound of O​(((1+2log⁡k)​k2)n)𝑂superscript12𝑘𝑘2𝑛O\\left(\\left((1+\\frac{2}{\\log k})\\frac{k}{2}\\right)^{n}\\right) iterations (with high probability) when action selection is arbitrary. Their bound of O​(20.78​n)𝑂superscript20.78𝑛O(2^{0.78n}) expected iterations for the special case of k=2𝑘2k=2 was subsequently improved by Hansen et al. [ref]25 to O​(n5)​(32)n𝑂superscript𝑛5superscript32𝑛O(n^{5})\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{n}. PI variants that switch only a single state in each iteration (that is, which enforce |Sswitch|=1subscript𝑆switch1|S_{\\text{switch}}|=1) may be interpreted as variants of the Simplex algorithm, being run on an LP PMsubscript𝑃𝑀P_{M} induced by the input MDP M𝑀M. Vertices in the feasible polytope of PMsubscript𝑃𝑀P_{M} are in bijective correspondence with the set of policies ΠΠ\\Pi; single switch policy improvements amount to shifting to a neighbouring vertex that increases the objective function, which at the vertex corresponding to policy π∈Π𝜋Π\\pi\\in\\Pi is ∑s∈SVπ​(s)subscript𝑠𝑆superscript𝑉𝜋𝑠\\sum_{s\\in S}V^{\\pi}(s). Suppose the set of states S𝑆S is indexed; without loss of generality take S={1,2,…,n}𝑆12…𝑛S=\\{1,2,\\dots,n\\}. Kalyanakrishnan et al.  show an upper bound of (2+ln⁡(k−1))nsuperscript2𝑘1𝑛(2+\\ln(k-1))^{n} expected iterations for a variant of PI in which Sswitch={maxs∈S+​(π)⁡s}subscript𝑆switchsubscript𝑠superscript𝑆𝜋𝑠S_{\\text{switch}}=\\{\\max_{s\\in S^{+}(\\pi)}s\\}, and action selection is random. Interestingly, Melekopoglou and Condon  show that the same rule results in a policy improvement sequence of length 2nsuperscript2𝑛2^{n} for an n𝑛n-state, 222-action MDP. Among deterministic variants of PI, the best known upper bound is poly​(n,k)⋅k0.7207​n⋅poly𝑛𝑘superscript𝑘0.7207𝑛\\text{poly}(n,k)\\cdot k^{0.7207n} iterations (Gupta and Kalyanakrishnan ), for a variant that is based on “batch-switching” PI (Kalyanakrishnan et al. ). The upper bounds listed above for MDPs also apply to DMDPs. However, a much stronger result has been shown when PI is applied to DMDPs. Post and Ye  demonstrate that the max-gain variant of the Simplex indeed terminates after a polynomial number of iterations on n𝑛n-state, k𝑘k-action DMDP. In this variant, the improvement set is {(s¯,a¯)}¯𝑠¯𝑎\\{(\\bar{s},\\bar{a})\\}, where s¯,a¯∈arg​max(s,a)∈S×A⁡ρπ​(s,a)¯𝑠¯𝑎subscriptargmax𝑠𝑎𝑆𝐴superscript𝜌𝜋𝑠𝑎\\bar{s},\\bar{a}\\in\\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{(s,a)\\in S\\times A}\\rho^{\\pi}(s,a), with ties broken arbitrarily. As we shall see in Section 4, every DMDP M𝑀M induces a directed multigraph GMsubscript𝐺𝑀G_{M}, with each policy inducing a subgraph that is guaranteed to contain a directed cycle. Post and Ye establish that the max-gain Simplex algorithm registers a significant jump in the objective function when proceeding from π𝜋\\pi to π′superscript𝜋′\\pi^{\\prime} if some cycle induced by π𝜋\\pi is not induced by π′superscript𝜋′\\pi^{\\prime}. Moreover, such a break of a cycle must occur within a polynomial number of iterations, resulting in an overall upper bound of O​(n5​k2​log2⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑛5superscript𝑘2superscript2𝑛O(n^{5}k^{2}\\log^{2}n) iterations for the max-gain Simplex algorithm. This upper bound has subsequently been improved by a factor of n𝑛n (Hansen et al. ) and also generalised (Scherrer ). Even if the max-gain simplex algorithm is strongly polynomial for DMDPs, there do exist PI variants that are exponentially lower-bounded. Ashutosh et al.  construct an n𝑛n-state, k𝑘k-action whose PI-DAG has a path of length Ω​(kn/2)Ωsuperscript𝑘𝑛2\\Omega(k^{n/2}). Unlike preceding analyses to obtain upper bounds for DMDPs (Post and Ye , Hansen et al. , Scherrer ), ours does not principally rely on geometric properties such as the objective function of policies. Rather, our arguments are primarily based on bounding discrete quantities: the number of directed cycles induced by policies in certain subgraphs of GMsubscript𝐺𝑀G_{M}. We derive two graph-theoretic results in the next section, and apply them to the analysis of PI on DMDPs in Section 4.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: when action selection is arbitrary.
