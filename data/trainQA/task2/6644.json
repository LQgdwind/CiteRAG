      "content": "Paper Title: Convergence Guarantees for Stochastic Subgradient Methods in Nonsmooth Nonconvex Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this part, we present a brief introduction to the conservative field, which can be applied to characterize how the nonsmooth neural networks are differentiated by AD algorithms. A set-valued mapping 𝒟:ℝn⇉ℝs:𝒟⇉superscriptℝ𝑛superscriptℝ𝑠\\mathcal{D}:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightrightarrows\\mathbb{R}^{s} is a mapping from ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n} to a collection of subsets of ℝssuperscriptℝ𝑠\\mathbb{R}^{s}. 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} is said to have closed graph if the graph of 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}, defined by is a closed subset of ℝn×ℝssuperscriptℝ𝑛superscriptℝ𝑠\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{s}. A set-valued mapping 𝒟:ℝn⇉ℝs:𝒟⇉superscriptℝ𝑛superscriptℝ𝑠\\mathcal{D}:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightrightarrows\\mathbb{R}^{s} is said to be locally bounded if, for any x∈ℝn𝑥superscriptℝ𝑛x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}, there is a neighborhood Vxsubscript𝑉𝑥V_{x} of x𝑥x such that ∪y∈Vx𝒟​(y)subscript𝑦subscript𝑉𝑥𝒟𝑦\\cup_{y\\in V_{x}}\\mathcal{D}(y) is a bounded subset of ℝssuperscriptℝ𝑠\\mathbb{R}^{s}. The following lemma extends the results in  and illustrates that the composition of two locally bounded closed-graph set-valued mappings is locally bounded and has closed graph. Suppose both 𝒟gsubscript𝒟𝑔\\mathcal{D}_{g} and 𝒟hsubscript𝒟ℎ\\mathcal{D}_{h} are locally bounded set-valued mappings with closed graph. Then the set-valued mapping 𝒟g∘𝒟hsubscript𝒟𝑔subscript𝒟ℎ\\mathcal{D}_{g}\\circ\\mathcal{D}_{h} is a locally bounded set-valued mapping with closed graph. For any sequence {(xk,yk)}∈graph​(𝒟g∘𝒟h)subscript𝑥𝑘subscript𝑦𝑘graphsubscript𝒟𝑔subscript𝒟ℎ\\{({x_{k}},{y_{k}})\\}\\in\\mathrm{graph}\\left(\\mathcal{D}_{g}\\circ\\mathcal{D}_{h}\\right) and let (x~,y~)~𝑥~𝑦(\\tilde{x},\\tilde{y}) be a cluster point of {(xk,yk)}subscript𝑥𝑘subscript𝑦𝑘\\{({x_{k}},{y_{k}})\\}. Then there exists {zk}subscript𝑧𝑘\\{{z_{k}}\\} such that both zk∈𝒟h​(xk)subscript𝑧𝑘subscript𝒟ℎsubscript𝑥𝑘{z_{k}}\\in\\mathcal{D}_{h}({x_{k}}) and yk∈𝒟g​(zk)subscript𝑦𝑘subscript𝒟𝑔subscript𝑧𝑘{y_{k}}\\in\\mathcal{D}_{g}({z_{k}}) hold for any k≥0𝑘0k\\geq 0. Since 𝒟hsubscript𝒟ℎ\\mathcal{D}_{h} has closed graph, we can conclude that there exists a subsequence {kj}⊂ℕ+subscript𝑘𝑗subscriptℕ\\{k_{j}\\}\\subset\\mathbb{N}_{+} such that xkj→x~→subscript𝑥subscript𝑘𝑗~𝑥x_{k_{j}}\\to\\tilde{x}, zkj→z~→subscript𝑧subscript𝑘𝑗~𝑧z_{k_{j}}\\to\\tilde{z}, and z~∈𝒟h​(x~)~𝑧subscript𝒟ℎ~𝑥\\tilde{z}\\in\\mathcal{D}_{h}(\\tilde{x}). Then from the fact that 𝒟gsubscript𝒟𝑔\\mathcal{D}_{g} has closed graph, it holds that any cluster point of {ykj}subscript𝑦subscript𝑘𝑗\\{y_{k_{j}}\\} lies in 𝒟g​(z~)subscript𝒟𝑔~𝑧\\mathcal{D}_{g}(\\tilde{z}), hence y~∈𝒟g​(z~)⊆𝒟g​(𝒟h​(x~))~𝑦subscript𝒟𝑔~𝑧subscript𝒟𝑔subscript𝒟ℎ~𝑥\\tilde{y}\\in\\mathcal{D}_{g}(\\tilde{z})\\subseteq\\mathcal{D}_{g}(\\mathcal{D}_{h}(\\tilde{x})). Therefore, we can conclude that any cluster point (x~,y~)~𝑥~𝑦(\\tilde{x},\\tilde{y}) of {(xk,yk)}subscript𝑥𝑘subscript𝑦𝑘\\{({x_{k}},{y_{k}})\\} lies in graph​(𝒟g∘𝒟h)graphsubscript𝒟𝑔subscript𝒟ℎ\\mathrm{graph}\\left(\\mathcal{D}_{g}\\circ\\mathcal{D}_{h}\\right), hence 𝒟g∘𝒟hsubscript𝒟𝑔subscript𝒟ℎ\\mathcal{D}_{g}\\circ\\mathcal{D}_{h} has closed graph. Moreover, since 𝒟hsubscript𝒟ℎ\\mathcal{D}_{h} is locally bounded, from Definition 2.4 we can conclude that for any x∈ℝn𝑥superscriptℝ𝑛x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}, there exists a neighborhood Vxsubscript𝑉𝑥V_{x} of x𝑥x such that ∪y∈Vx𝒟h​(y)subscript𝑦subscript𝑉𝑥subscript𝒟ℎ𝑦\\cup_{y\\in V_{x}}\\mathcal{D}_{h}(y) is bounded, hence cl​(∪y∈Vx𝒟h​(y))clsubscript𝑦subscript𝑉𝑥subscript𝒟ℎ𝑦\\mathrm{cl}\\left(\\cup_{y\\in V_{x}}\\mathcal{D}_{h}(y)\\right) is compact.\nNotice that 𝒟gsubscript𝒟𝑔\\mathcal{D}_{g} is also locally bounded, for any z∈cl​(∪y∈Vx𝒟h​(y))𝑧clsubscript𝑦subscript𝑉𝑥subscript𝒟ℎ𝑦z\\in\\mathrm{cl}\\left(\\cup_{y\\in V_{x}}\\mathcal{D}_{h}(y)\\right), there exists a neighborhood Vzsubscript𝑉𝑧V_{z} of z𝑧z such that ∪w∈Vz𝒟g​(w)subscript𝑤subscript𝑉𝑧subscript𝒟𝑔𝑤\\cup_{w\\in V_{z}}\\mathcal{D}_{g}(w) is bounded. Besides, {Vz:z∈cl​(∪y∈Vx𝒟h​(y))}conditional-setsubscript𝑉𝑧𝑧clsubscript𝑦subscript𝑉𝑥subscript𝒟ℎ𝑦\\{V_{z}:z\\in\\mathrm{cl}\\left(\\cup_{y\\in V_{x}}\\mathcal{D}_{h}(y)\\right)\\} is an open cover for cl​(∪y∈Vx𝒟h​(y))clsubscript𝑦subscript𝑉𝑥subscript𝒟ℎ𝑦\\mathrm{cl}\\left(\\cup_{y\\in V_{x}}\\mathcal{D}_{h}(y)\\right). Hence there exists {zk:k∈[N]}conditional-setsubscript𝑧𝑘𝑘delimited-[]𝑁\\{z_{k}:k\\in[N]\\} such that cl​(∪y∈Vx𝒟h​(y))⊂∪i∈[N]Vziclsubscript𝑦subscript𝑉𝑥subscript𝒟ℎ𝑦subscript𝑖delimited-[]𝑁subscript𝑉subscript𝑧𝑖\\mathrm{cl}\\left(\\cup_{y\\in V_{x}}\\mathcal{D}_{h}(y)\\right)\\subset\\cup_{i\\in[N]}V_{z_{i}}. Then we achieve which illustrates that ∪y∈Vx𝒟g​(𝒟h​(y))subscript𝑦subscript𝑉𝑥subscript𝒟𝑔subscript𝒟ℎ𝑦\\cup_{y\\in V_{x}}\\mathcal{D}_{g}(\\mathcal{D}_{h}(y)) is a subset of a finite union of bounded sets. Therefore, we can conclude that 𝒟g∘𝒟hsubscript𝒟𝑔subscript𝒟ℎ\\mathcal{D}_{g}\\circ\\mathcal{D}_{h} is locally bounded. This completes the proof.\n∎ In the following definitions, we present the definition for the conservative field and its corresponding potential function. An absolutely continuous curve is an absolutely continuous mapping γ:ℝ+→ℝn:𝛾→subscriptℝsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\gamma:\\mathbb{R}_{+}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{n} whose derivative γ′superscript𝛾′\\gamma^{\\prime} exists almost everywhere in ℝℝ\\mathbb{R} and γ​(t)−γ​(0)𝛾𝑡𝛾0\\gamma(t)-\\gamma(0) equals to the Lebesgue integral of γ′superscript𝛾′\\gamma^{\\prime} between 00 and t𝑡t for all t∈ℝ+𝑡subscriptℝt\\in\\mathbb{R}_{+}, i.e., Let 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} be a set-valued mapping from ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n} to subsets of ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}. Then we call 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} as a conservative field if 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} satisfies the following properties: 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} has closed graph. 𝒟​(x)𝒟𝑥\\mathcal{D}(x) is a nonempty compact subset of ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}. For any absolutely continuous curve γ: →ℝn×p:𝛾→01superscriptℝ𝑛𝑝\\gamma: \\to\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p} satisfying γ​(0)=γ​(1)𝛾0𝛾1\\gamma(0)=\\gamma(1), we have where the integral is understood in the Lebesgue sense. It is important to note that any conservative field is locally bounded, as illustrated in [11, Remark 3]. Moreover, 1 shows that through the path integral, any conservative field 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} uniquely determines a function named potential function, as illustrated in the following definition. Let 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} be a conservative field in ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}. Then with any given x0∈ℝnsubscript𝑥0superscriptℝ𝑛x_{0}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}, we can define a function f:ℝn→ℝ:𝑓→superscriptℝ𝑛ℝf:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\to\\mathbb{R} through the path integral for any absolutely continuous curve γ𝛾\\gamma that satisfies γ​(0)=x0𝛾0subscript𝑥0\\gamma(0)=x_{0} and γ​(1)=x𝛾1𝑥\\gamma(1)=x. Then f𝑓f is called a potential function for 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}, and we also say 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} admits f𝑓f as its potential function, or that 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} is a conservative field for f𝑓f. It is worth mentioning that in Definition 2.7, Equation (2.1) guarantees that the path integral in (2.2) only depends on the start point and end point of the path γ𝛾\\gamma (i.e., γ​(0)𝛾0\\gamma(0) and γ​(1)𝛾1\\gamma(1)). In this sense, the behavior of 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} exhibits similarities to the differential of f𝑓f. To further emphasize that 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} can be considered a generalization of the Clarke subdifferential, 1 presents the following two lemmas: Let f:ℝn→ℝ:𝑓→superscriptℝ𝑛ℝf:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\to\\mathbb{R} be a potential function that admits 𝒟fsubscript𝒟𝑓\\mathcal{D}_{f} as its conservative field. Then 𝒟f​(x)={∇f​(x)}subscript𝒟𝑓𝑥∇𝑓𝑥\\mathcal{D}_{f}(x)=\\{\\nabla f(x)\\} almost everywhere. Let f:ℝn→ℝ:𝑓→superscriptℝ𝑛ℝf:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\to\\mathbb{R} be a potential function that admits 𝒟fsubscript𝒟𝑓\\mathcal{D}_{f} as its conservative field. Then ∂f𝑓\\partial f is a conservative field for f𝑓f, and for all x∈ℝn𝑥superscriptℝ𝑛x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}, it holds that Lemma 2.10 illustrates that for any Clarke stationary point x∗superscript𝑥x^{*} of f𝑓f, it holds that 0∈conv​(𝒟f​(x∗))0convsubscript𝒟𝑓superscript𝑥0\\in\\mathrm{conv}\\,(\\mathcal{D}_{f}(x^{*})). Therefore, we can employ the concept of the conservative field to characterize the optimality for UOP, as illustrated in the following definition. Let f:ℝn→ℝ:𝑓→superscriptℝ𝑛ℝf:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\to\\mathbb{R} be a potential function that admits 𝒟fsubscript𝒟𝑓\\mathcal{D}_{f} as its conservative field. Then we say x𝑥x is a 𝒟fsubscript𝒟𝑓\\mathcal{D}_{f}-stationary point of f𝑓f if 0∈conv​(𝒟f​(x))0convsubscript𝒟𝑓𝑥0\\in\\mathrm{conv}\\,(\\mathcal{D}_{f}(x)). In particular, we say x𝑥x is a ∂f𝑓\\partial f-stationary point of f𝑓f if 0∈∂f​(x)0𝑓𝑥0\\in\\partial f(x). It is worth noting that the class of potential functions considered in our framework is general enough to enclose a wide range of objective functions encountered in real-world machine learning problems. As demonstrated in [18, Section 5.1], any Clarke regular function belongs to the category of potential functions. Consequently, all differentiable functions and weakly convex functions are potential functions. Another important class of functions is the so-called definable functions, which are functions whose graphs are definable in an o𝑜o-minimal structure [18, Definition 5.10]. As established in , any definable function is also a potential function 8 1. As illustrated in the Tarski-Seidenberg theorem , any semi-algebraic function is definable. Moreover,  demonstrates the existence of an o𝑜o-minimal structure that contains both the graph of the exponential function and all semi-algebraic sets. Consequently, numerous frequently employed activation and loss functions, such as sigmoid, softplus, ReLU, leaky ReLU, ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-loss, MSE loss, hinge loss, logistic loss, and cross-entropy loss, all fall within the class of definable functions. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that the definability is preserved under finite summation and composition 8 1. Therefore, for any neural network constructed using definable building blocks, its loss function is definable and, consequently, a potential function. It is worth noting that the Clarke subdifferentials of definable functions are definable 1. As a result, for any neural network constructed using definable building blocks, the conservative field corresponding to the automatic differentiation (AD) algorithms is also definable. The following proposition demonstrates that the definability of both the objective function f𝑓f and its conservative field 𝒟fsubscript𝒟𝑓\\mathcal{D}_{f} leads to the nonsmooth Morse-Sard property for UOP [ref]9. Let f𝑓f be a potential function that admits 𝒟fsubscript𝒟𝑓\\mathcal{D}_{f} as its conservative field. Suppose both f𝑓f and 𝒟fsubscript𝒟𝑓\\mathcal{D}_{f} are definable over ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}, then the set {f​(x):0∈𝒟f​(x)}conditional-set𝑓𝑥0subscript𝒟𝑓𝑥\\{f(x):0\\in\\mathcal{D}_{f}(x)\\} is finite. Notice that supd∈𝒳⟨d,w⟩=supd∈conv​(𝒳)⟨d,w⟩subscriptsupremum𝑑𝒳𝑑𝑤subscriptsupremum𝑑conv𝒳𝑑𝑤\\sup_{d\\in{\\mathcal{X}}}\\left\\langle d,w\\right\\rangle=\\sup_{d\\in\\mathrm{conv}\\,({\\mathcal{X}})}\\left\\langle d,w\\right\\rangle for any subset 𝒳⊆ℝn𝒳superscriptℝ𝑛{\\mathcal{X}}\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^{n} and d∈ℝn𝑑superscriptℝ𝑛d\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}. As a result, from 1, we can conclude that for any conservative field 𝒟fsubscript𝒟𝑓\\mathcal{D}_{f} that admits f𝑓f as its potential function, the set-valued mapping x↦conv​(𝒟f​(x))maps-to𝑥convsubscript𝒟𝑓𝑥x\\mapsto\\mathrm{conv}(\\mathcal{D}_{f}(x)) is also a conservative field for f𝑓f. Furthermore, as illustrated in [11, Theorem 4], for any conservative field 𝒟fsubscript𝒟𝑓\\mathcal{D}_{f} that admits f𝑓f as its potential function and any r∈ℕ+𝑟subscriptℕr\\in\\mathbb{N}_{+}, it holds that (f,𝒟f)𝑓subscript𝒟𝑓(f,\\mathcal{D}_{f}) has a 𝒞rsuperscript𝒞𝑟\\mathcal{C}^{r} variational stratification [11, Definition 5], hence (f,conv​(𝒟f))𝑓convsubscript𝒟𝑓(f,\\mathrm{conv}\\,(\\mathcal{D}_{f})) also has a 𝒞rsuperscript𝒞𝑟\\mathcal{C}^{r} variational stratification. Therefore, together with [11, Theorem 5], we can conclude that the set {f​(x):0∈conv​(𝒟f​(x))}conditional-set𝑓𝑥0convsubscript𝒟𝑓𝑥\\{f(x):0\\in\\mathrm{conv}\\,(\\mathcal{D}_{f}(x))\\} is a finite subset of ℝℝ\\mathbb{R}.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: following proposition demonstrates that the definability of both the objective function f𝑓f and its conservative field 𝒟fsubscript𝒟𝑓\\mathcal{D}_{f} leads to the nonsmooth Morse-Sard property for UOP [ref]9.
