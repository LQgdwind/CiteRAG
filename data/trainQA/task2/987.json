      "content": "Paper Title: Smooth Variational Graph Embeddings for Efficient Neural Architecture Search The authors acknowledge support by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research Foundation via the project DeToL.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent progress in computer vision is to a large extent coupled to the advancement of novel neural architectures  . In this context, the automated search of neural architectures  [ref]4 [ref]5\nis increasingly important, as it removes the fatiguing and time-consuming process of manual trial-and-error network design. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is intrinsically a discrete optimization problem and can be solved effectively using black-box methods such as reinforcement learning  [ref]4, evolution  [ref]5, Bayesian optimization (BO)   0 or local search 1. However, finding a good solution typically requires thousands of function evaluations, which is infeasible without company-scale compute infrastructure. Recent research in NAS focus as well on efficient methods via continuous relaxations of the discrete search space and weight-sharing 2 3 4 5. However, such methods\nyield efficient yet oftentimes sub-optimal results 6. Therefore, we argue in favor of NAS on learned graph embeddings using encoder-decoder graph neural networks (GNN) 7 8 9. Zhang et al. 0 recently showed good performance with such a model, D-VAE, on the ENAS search space 3 in neural architecture performance prediction and BO - proving its ability to learn smooth continuous graph representations. D-VAE aggregates information in the architecture GNN alternatingly in the forward pass and in the backward pass to encode the neural network information flow. However, the D-VAE model imposes strong constraints on the graph structure, which limit its applicability to search spaces beyond ENAS. In addition, it has very long training times. In this paper, we propose a two-sided variational encoder-decoder GNN to learn smooth embeddings in various NAS search spaces, which we call Smooth Variational Graph embedding (SVGe). In contrast to D-VAE, SVGe aggregates node representations in the forward and backward pass separately and consequently decodes their joint representation into forward and backward pass separately (see Fig. 1). This yields a very high reconstruction ability without imposing any constraints on the search space and allows for a more efficient training. Inheriting from variational autoencoders 1, it places structurally similar graphs close to one another in the embedding space and thus facilitates efficient black-box optimization to find high-performing architectures. The proposed model is not only three times faster than D-VAE but also shows improved BO results on the ENAS search space. In contrast to D-VAE, it can be directly applied to other search spaces such as NAS-Bench-101 2 and NAS-Bench-201 3. Moreover, it allows to learn architecture performance prediction in a supervised way and extrapolate from the space of observed architectures at test time. This way, high performing architectures even outside of the original search space can be proposed at very low costs. In summary, we make the following contributions:\n(i) We introduce a novel graph variational autoencoder, SVGe, that builds a structurally smooth variational graph embedding by learning accurate representations of neural architectures (Sec. III-A and III-B).\n(ii) We discuss theoretical properties of our approach (Sec. III-D).\n(iii) We conduct extensive evaluations on the ENAS 3, NAS-Bench-101 2 and NAS-Bench-2013 search spaces and show that our approach allows for competitive BO results in all three search spaces. Our experiments show that SVGe is able to extrapolate to larger unseen architectures. It finds an architecture with a best accuracy of 95.18%percent95.1895.18\\% when learning from the NAS-Bench-101 search space. This improves over the best architecture within this space. In addition, our top 111 found architecture improves over comparable architectures in terms of validation and test accuracy, when transferring to ImageNet16-120 4 (Sec. IV).\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Recent progress in computer vision is to a large extent coupled to the advancement of novel neural architectures  .
