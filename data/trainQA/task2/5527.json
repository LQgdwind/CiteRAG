      "content": "Paper Title: AIDA: Legal Judgment Predictions for Non-Professional Fact Descriptions via Partial-and-Imbalanced Domain Adaptation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNon-professional fact description (NPFD) is referred to the legal fact writing by non-professional people, whose expression of a fact may be much different from a professional description. Therefore, it is hard to build a reliable automatic prediction system for NPFD since the lack of the training data (labeled data) for the non-professional fact descriptions. On the other hand, massive labeled PFD data are released by different law-related organizations. For example, Chinese government published a large amount of court-related data ever since 2013 111https://wenshu.court.gov.cn/, where each case is well-structured and divided in a professional manner into several parts such as fact and penalty. The PFD dataset provides\na massive legal judgment resource for training a prediction algorithm, thus, is popularly used in several works, such as [ref]3, as training data for charge prediction tasks and article prediction tasks. To solve the problem of NPFD predictions, one natural idea is to use the advanced unsupervised domain adaptation techniques[ref]6 to transfer knowledge from PFD domain to NPFD domain via sharing parameters of word embedding and text encoder. The key for the transfer learning technique to work successfully is the existence of latent invariant features crossing the domains. In our scenario, because the words or phrases used in PFD and NPFD can be very different, we are going to exploit the word embedding technique to reduce the difficulty in looking for invariant features between the two domains. Currently, [ref]7 showed BiLSTM trained on the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset yielded the state-of-the-art result compared with all existing alternatives of unsupervised world embedding techniques. In fact, word embedding techniques can only solve the domain mismatch by extending the sparse words used in the two domains into a common external context but could not learn the invariant features crossing them, which limits the improvement.\nTo solve the problem, in this work we propose to combine this advanced transferable text encoder[ref]7 and high-level domain adaptation[ref]6 as a strong baseline for an unsupervised domain adaptation task. Several techniques for domain adaptation are proposed in recent years. Sparse Partial Domain Shift. As we mentioned, the fact descriptions for PFD and NPFD are much different. An example is as shown in Fig 1, where both word “(cut)” and “(minor injuries)” are seldom used in NPFD, it can be regarded as an indicator for intentional injury in NPFD. For NPFD, people usually use spoken language to express the same semantics, which is also confirmed in . Furthermore, many practical applications of NPFD only need to support predictions in a very specific area (a subset of the broad law domain). Then the PFD dataset can be divided to two parts: (1) Shared PFD which shares the same label space of NPFD, and Non-shared PFD which shares no label space of NPFD. The previous domain adaptation techniques as proposed in [ref]6 often ignore the None-shared PFD, such that the non-shared classes data in(PFD domain) may bring much noise in extracting invariant features crossing the two domains, thus, lead to a lower performance in the prediction.\nThe only exception is partial domain adaptation (PDA) , which is the domain adaptation that the source label space subsumes the target label space for safe transfer of the unknown target space. However, PDA has several limitations: (1) bad performance for sparse shared-classes in source domain, (2) bad performance for large-scale non-shared classes in source domain.\nThis paper argue the None-shared PFD is helpful to improve traditional domain adaptation when some classes of Shared PFD is sparse. Source Dataset Imbalance. The distribution of various charges and law articles are quite imbalanced in PFD dataset[ref]3. In statics, the top 10 most frequent charges cover as much as 78.1% cases while the top least frequent 50 charges only cover about 0.5% cases.\nThis will cause a severe over-fitting problem to the categories with few cases.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: manner into several parts such as fact and penalty.
