Selective classification.\nPrior works have studied selective classification for many model classes including SVM, boosting, and nearest neighbors   .\nBecause deep neural networks generalize well but are often overconfident  , mitigating such overconfidence using selective classification while preserving its generalization properties is an important capability    5 .\nExisting methods for learning conservative neural networks rely on additional assumptions such as pseudo-labeling , multiple distinct validation sets , or adversarial OOD examples 5.\nWhile minimizing the confidence of a set that includes OOD inputs has been shown to result in a more conservative model in the offline reinforcement learning setting , this approach has not been validated in a supervised learning setting.\nDCM only requires a small validation set, and our experiments in Section 6 demonstrate that its performance is competitive with state-of-the-art methods for selective classification, especially in the more challenging setting of being tested on unseen OOD inputs.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: Out-of-distribution detection.\nMany existing methods for OOD detection use a criterion based on the activations or predictions of a model trained on ID data  1  [ref]34  .\nHowever, the performance of these methods are often inconsistent across different ID-OOD dataset pairs, suggesting that the OOD detection problem is ill-defined  .\nIndeed, a separate line\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
