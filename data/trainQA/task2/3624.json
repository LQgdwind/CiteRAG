      "content": "Paper Title: ScalableViT: Rethinking the Context-oriented Generalization of Vision Transformer\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nClassification.\nThe classification settings mainly follow DeiT¬†[ref]35. All variants are trained under a resolution of 224√ó224224224224\\times 224.\nDuring training from scratch, we employ the AdamW optimizer¬†[ref]27 with a weight decay of 0.05 and a momentum of 0.9 to train models for 300 epochs. The learning rate is set to 0.001 initially and varies with the cosine scheduler, where a 5-epochs linear warm-up is used to stabilize training. The global batchsize is set to 1024 on 8 V100 GPUs.\nMoreover, we apply data augmentations and regularizations, including random cropping, random horizontal flipping¬†, mixup¬†[ref]52, CutMix¬†, random erasing¬†, label-smoothing¬†, stochastic depth¬†, and repeated augmentation¬†.\nFor stochastic depth augmentation, we set the drop rate to 0.20.20.2, 0.50.50.5, and 0.50.50.5 for ScalableViT-S, ScalableViT-B, and ScalableViT-L, respectively.\nDuring testing on the validation set, the shorter side of an input image is first resized to 256, and a center crop of 224 √ó 224 is used to evaluate the classification accuracy. Object Detection.\nWe adopt RetinaNet¬† and Mask R-CNN¬† detection frameworks on COCO¬† that contains 118K training images and 5K validation images. Before training, we initialize the backbone with the weight pre-trained on ImageNet-1K, FPN with Xavier¬† scheme, and other new layers with Normal scheme (s‚Äãt‚Äãd=0.01ùë†ùë°ùëë0.01std=0.01).\nAll models utilize AdamW¬†[ref]27 optimizer, 500-iteration warm-up, 1√ó1\\times (12 epochs), and 3√ó3\\times (36 epochs) schedule with a global batch size of 16 on 8 GPUs. Settings of initial learning rate and weight decay are shown in Table¬†8. For 1√ó1\\times schedule, the short side of training images is resized to 800 pixels, and the long side is never more than 1333 pixels. The learning rate is declined at the 8‚Äãt‚Äãh8ùë°‚Ñé8th and 11‚Äãt‚Äãh11ùë°‚Ñé11th epoch with a decay rate of 0.1. For the 3√ó3\\times schedule, we adopt the multi-scale training, which randomly resizes the short side of the input images within the range of   while keeping the longer side at most 1333. The learning rate is declined at the 27‚Äãt‚Äãh27ùë°‚Ñé27th and 33‚Äãr‚Äãd33ùëüùëë33rd with a decay rate of 0.1. When testing, the image size is set as the same as the 1√ó1\\times schedule. Semantic Segmentation.\nSemantic segmentation experiments are conducted on the challenging ADE20K¬†, with 20K images for training and 2K images for validation. We use the typical Semantic FPN¬† and UperNet¬† as segmentation frameworks to evaluate our models. Following the common practice, we use the MMSegmentation¬† to implement all related experiments.\nWe employ the AdamW¬†[ref]27 to optimize two models. The initial learning rate and weight decay are shown in Table¬†8.\nFor the Semantic FPN, we train 80K iterations with a batch size 16 on 4 GPUs. The polynomial policy schedules the learning rate with a power of 0.90.90.9. For the UperNet, we train 160K iterations with a batch size 16 on 8 GPUs. The polynomial policy schedules the learning rate with a power of 1.01.01.0.\nDuring training, we first resize the short side of input images to 512 pixels, and the long side is never more than 2048 pixels, then randomly crop to 512√ó512512512512\\times 512.\nDuring testing, we resize input images the same as the training phase but without cropping. We also use the test time augmentation for UperNet, including multi-scale test ([0.5,0.75,1.0,1.25,1.5,1.75]√ó[0.5,0.75,1.0,1.25,1.5,1.75]\\times resolution) and flip, for better results.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: Classification.\nThe classification settings mainly follow DeiT¬†[ref]35. All variants are trained under a resolution of 224√ó224224224224\\times 224.\nDuring training from scratch, we employ the AdamW optimizer¬†[ref]27 with a weight decay of 0.05 and a momentum of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
