      "content": "Paper Title: Toward Understanding Why Adam Converges Faster Than SGD for Transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStochastic gradient descent (SGD) [ref]42 [ref]5 is one of the most widely used optimization algorithms for deep learning, due to its simplicity and efficiency on various large-scale neural networks. However, in some tasks, such as training transformers  , which are powerful models for natural language processing and other domains, SGD often performs poorly compared to adaptive variants of stochastic gradient methods. Adaptive algorithms, such as Adagrad , Adam , and AMSGrad , adjust the learning rate for each parameter based on the magnitude and history of the gradients, which can help them exploit the local geometry of the objective function and escape from saddle points or plateaus. While adaptive algorithms have shown empirical advantages over SGD in many applications  [ref]51 , the theoretical understanding of their superior performance in these tasks is limited [ref]51 . The best known non-convex convergence rate for AMSGrad  only matches the best convergence rate of SGD but does not improve upon it  . While pursuing a better general convergence rate for adaptive algorithms is a possible but challenging direction, a more realistic and relevant question is what makes Adam so effective and SGD so ineffective on certain architectures and tasks, such as transformers on language tasks. We aim to identify some properties of transformers that give rise to this phenomenon, and to find some quantities that can indicate the performance of different optimization algorithms in practice. Such insights could then be used to guide the selection and design of faster and more robust optimization algorithms for deep learning. In this paper, we propose one possible explanation for why Adam converges faster than SGD in practice, especially for transformers. We begin by revisiting a classic simple example. Consider minimizing the diagonal quadratic function f:ℝd→ℝ:𝑓→superscriptℝ𝑑ℝf:\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\to\\mathbb{R} given by f​(x)=x⊤​A​x𝑓𝑥superscript𝑥top𝐴𝑥f(x)=x^{\\top}Ax, where A11=100subscript𝐴11100A_{11}=100 and Ai​i=1subscript𝐴𝑖𝑖1A_{ii}=1 for all i>1𝑖1i>1. The gradient is given by ∇f​(x)=(200​x1,2​x2,…,2​xd)∇𝑓𝑥200subscript𝑥12subscript𝑥2…2subscript𝑥𝑑\\nabla f(x)=(200x_{1},2x_{2},\\dots,2x_{d}) and the Hessian has spectral norm 200200200. If we run gradient descent, then by standard convex optimization analysis, we can choose a learning rate at most 11001100\\frac{1}{100} for any initial point, which will result in slow convergence. However, if we run adaptive algorithms, signSGD, or simply clip the first coordinate, we can use a much larger learning rate and converge in a few steps. Although this example is much simpler than practical applications of adaptive algorithms, it illustrates the key idea that coordinate-wise scaling can help adaptive algorithms to adjust their step size on different coordinates and exploit the curvature of the function. We wonder if there are similar phenomena in real-world neural networks. Inspired by this example, we study the local geometry of transformers in Section 3. Instead of analyzing the global convergence and trajectory of optimization algorithms, we focus on the simpler question of finding a good update direction in a fixed local geometry. We decompose the goal of locally minimizing the objective function into two components: gradient correlation, which measures the alignment of the update direction with the negative gradient, and directional sharpness, which measures the curvature of the function along the update direction. We argue that the directional sharpness of the update direction is a more useful indicator of the performance of optimization algorithms, as high sharpness usually implies low performance.\nEmpirically, we observe through experiments that the update directions of SGD have much higher directional sharpness compared to adaptive algorithms. By studying more algorithms, we observe that in general, algorithms with high directional sharpness converge much slower than adaptive algorithms, which typically have low directional sharpness. We also visualize the corresponding landscape along the update directions, and our results show that algorithms with low directional sharpness can generally achieve a better local loss reduction if optimal step sizes are chosen. We investigate the cause of SGD’s high directional sharpness and find that it is mainly due to the imbalanced distribution of gradient across coordinates. We observe that only a small fraction of the coordinates account for most of SGD’s directional sharpness and we infer that it is because of the positive correlation between the Hessian and gradient coordinates. To address this issue, we propose to use coordinate-wise clipping as a simple and effective technique to improve the convergence and directional sharpness of optimization algorithms. The intuition behind clipping is that when a few coordinates have large gradients and bad smoothness, clipping prevents them from dominating the update direction and inflating the directional sharpness. Theoretically, we show that clipping improves the worst-case directional sharpness and enables a better local loss reduction with a larger step size. Empirically, we show that clipping can consistently reduce the directional sharpness, which often leads to a better local function reduction and improves the convergence speed of various optimization algorithms including adaptive algorithms. We demonstrate our findings through two experiments under different settings and show that our observations are robust across different tasks, models, and iterations. Based on the experiments, we argue that the landscape of optimization algorithms in local geometry is a useful proxy for the global convergence speed. We conclude that the adaptive coordinate-wise scaling of Adam can effectively balance the trade-off between optimizing gradient correlation and directional sharpness, and that this ability is the key to Adam’s fast convergence in deep learning training. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows: We identify directional sharpness as a key indicator of the performance of optimization algorithms in local geometry, and show that adaptive algorithms have low directional sharpness compared to SGD, especially when training transformers. We propose coordinate-wise clipping as a simple, effective and universal technique to improve the directional sharpness and convergence speed of various optimization algorithms, and provide theoretical and empirical support for its benefits.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) [ref]42 [ref]5 is one of the most widely used optimization algorithms for deep learning, due to its simplicity and efficiency on various large-scale neural networks.
