      "content": "Paper Title: Securing Recommender System via Cooperative Training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, we have witnessed explosive growth in the amount of available information due to the rapid development of Internet technology. To cope with this massive data, “recommender system” has become a popular tool for quickly and effectively obtaining valuable information, gaining extensive attention in academia and industry. They mine the content that the user is interested in from a large amount of data by using information such as user behavior and item characteristics and presenting it to the user in a list. Benefiting their effectiveness and commercial background, they are widely used across various industries such as geographic recommendation , e-commerce , and audio-visual entertainment . However, recommender systems also face severe security challenges while providing convenience for our lives. This is because collaborative filtering, which is adopted in many recommender systems and recommends items based on user profile information, is vulnerable to fake user profiles. Several studies  [ref]6 [ref]7 have demonstrated that recommender systems, especially those in the sales and rating domains, are systematically affected by user ratings within the system. This interference can impact users’ purchase behavior and the system’s recommendation outcomes . Furthermore, it is worth emphasizing even if attackers do not know the algorithm or implementation details used by the recommendation system, only using small-scale misleading data can also have obvious interference effects on the normal recommendation behavior of the system (e.g., in 2002, after receiving a complaint, Amazon found that when a website recommends a Christian classic, another irrelevant book will be recommended simultaneously, which is caused by malicious users using deceptive means ). Existing defense strategies against poisoning attacks in recommendations are mainly divided into (1) data-processing-based defense, which involves studying the features of poisoning profiles, removing fake profiles, and refining datasets before recommender system training. However, these methods may delete normal data to achieve high recall, leading to biased recommendations. (2) Model-based defense aims to enhance the recommendation algorithm’s robustness even if fake data exists. Adversarial training [ref]9 is an effective model-based defense method that maximizes recommendation error while minimizing the model’s empirical risk by adding adversarial perturbations to the model parameters, eventually building robust models in adversarial games. While adversarial training can significantly improve the system’s robustness, controlling the strength of adversarial noise is challenging, leading to reduced recommendation generalization. Moreover, recent research 0 suggests that adversarial training with perturbations added to model parameters may not resist poisoning attacks effectively. Thus, it is crucial to integrate both methods while leveraging their strengths and avoiding weaknesses. Considering the shortcomings mentioned above, we propose a novel defense method, Triple Cooperative Defense (TCD), to enhance the robustness of recommender systems by integrating data processing and model robustness boosting. In TCD, three recommendation models are used for cooperative training. Specifically, in each round of training, the high-confidence prediction ratings of any two models are used as auxiliary training data for the remaining model. The three models cooperatively improve recommendation robustness. Our strategy is based on the following considerations. In the recommender system, extremely sparse user-item interactions (indicating less training data) are difficult to support good model training, leading to models easily misled by malicious profiles. Besides, recent work 0 also emphasizes that the model’s robustness requires more real data. Therefore, we reasonably use cheap pseudo-labels (predicted ratings), whose reliability is guaranteed by the rating’s confidence. To obtain high confidence ratings, we based on prior knowledge that ratings predicted to be consistent by most models are more credible. More model votes can lead to more reliable pseudo-labels, but at the cost of increased computation. Therefore, we compromise and suggest training with three models and any two models’ consistent prediction ratings as auxiliary training data for the third model. Model robustness is improved in data augmentation and co-training of the three models. Notably, we do not cull the data or modify the individual model structure, which can overcome the shortcomings of the existing defense methods discussed above. Additionally, we investigate poisoning attacks in recommender systems. Existing attacks can be categorized into heuristic-based and optimization-based attacks 1. Heuristic-based attacks, such as Average attack 2 and Bandwagon attack 3, design fake users based on the feature that similar users have similar interests in recommendations. However, they do not formally analyze specific recommendation models and cannot cover all recommendation patterns, resulting in insufficient attack performance. Consequently, model-based attacks have emerged. These methods target specific recommender systems, design optimization objective functions for fake profile generation, and use the projected gradient ascent to optimize the attack model, including visually-aware recommender systems 4, sequence-based recommender systems 5, federated recommender systems 6, graph-based recommender systems 7. Nevertheless, most of them assume the invariance of default parameters and do not consider the bi-level setting of poisoning attacks, that is, the optimization of poisoned data is accompanied by changes in model parameters. As a result, the optimized attack models they obtain are not optimal, reducing the destructive power of the attacks. In response to these issues, Huang et al. 8 proposed a poisoning attack that integrates model training and attack optimization. It constructs a poisoning model to simulate a target recommender system and updates the poisoning model based on the attack objectives, allowing it to approximate the state of the victim recommendation model after training. Although it considers bi-level optimization of poisoning and demonstrates satisfactory performance, it also has some shortcomings: (1) Low efficiency. It generates only one fake profile at a time, with each user requiring a complete recommendation training process. This means that poisoning n′superscript𝑛′n^{\\prime} users necessitates training the model n′superscript𝑛′n^{\\prime} times. This extremely time-consuming generation strategy limits its practicability on large-scale datasets. (2) Non-global optimal. It adopts a greedy strategy to optimize poisoning profiles one at a time, which means that when optimizing the n𝑛n-th user, the first n−1𝑛1n-1 users remain fixed. Such constraint limits the search space and makes the algorithm prone to being trapped in local optima. Inspired by them and considering the above mentioned deficiencies, we propose an efficient attack, Co-training Attack (CoAttack). We also combine attack optimization and model training for cooperative training, but the difference is that our optimization is based on all candidate poisoning data. This design can well solve their limitations: (1) the optimization based on all poisoned data only needs one complete recommendation training, which is efficient; (2) such optimization strategy can search in the complete feasible space, which is more helpful in finding the global optimal solution. Specifically, in CoAttack, we first initialize poisoning profiles and inject them into the target model. Then we pre-train the recommendation model based on the standard recommendation loss to ensure its ability to learn user preferences accurately. Third, we combine attack loss and recommendation loss for training, striving to approximate the attack model to the target model after poisoning. Finally, we choose the items with high predicted scores in the optimized model as filler items. In addition, it is widely acknowledged that the dynamics of attack and defense in recommender systems resemble an ongoing arms race, where a previously effective attack strategy eventually becomes ineffective due to evolving defense mechanisms. One possible reason for the failure of attacks lies in the assumption that the target model remains defenseless and unoptimized, which is often overly optimistic.\nTo this end, we frame the interaction between attack and defense as a strategic game and train them in a coordinated manner. In this paper, we combine our proposed Triple Cooperative Defense (TCD) and CoAttack methodologies to introduce a novel approach called Game-based Co-training Attack (GCoAttack). In each round of attack optimization, GCoAttack first enhances recommendation robustness through TCD, then fine-tunes poisoning profiles using the robust recommendation model, and ultimately seeks to maximize attack performance within the context of this zero-sum game. Except for the contributions in the preliminary work 9 on triple cooperative defense, we further deliver the following contributions: We develop an effective poisoning attack method, CoAttack, which could efficiently generate malicious poisoning profiles by combining attack optimization and model training for cooperative training. We reveal the importance of games in the robust recommendation and propose GCoAttack. It further explores the attack potential of CoAttack through the cooperative training of CoAttack and TCD. Extensive experiments on three different datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CoAttack (cooperative training between attack optimization and model training) and GCoAttack (cooperative training between attack and defense) over the state-of-the-art methods. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces related work. Section 3 describes the threat model for recommendation poisoning. Sections 4 and 5 respectively present the proposed defense strategy TCD and two cooperative training attacks, CoAttack and GCoAttack. Section 6 provides a comprehensive experimental comparison and analysis. The final section7 summarizes our work and looks forward to the future.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: This is because collaborative filtering, which is adopted in many recommender systems and recommends items based on user profile information, is vulnerable to fake user profiles.
