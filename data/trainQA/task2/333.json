      "content": "Paper Title: Constructing Geographic and Long-term Temporal Graph for Traffic Forecasting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs one significant category of intelligent systems, ITS   has developed rapidly due to artificial intelligence (AI) for transportation recently.\nPutting AI to analyze the dynamic traffic patterns under the massive spatial-temporal data has obtained the promising performance in many basic and essential tasks of ITS   . Traffic forecasting is considered as predicting future traffic states of links (road segments) given sequential historical traffic states and the road network [ref]6. It is one of the most crucial, indispensable and challenging tasks in ITS [ref]6 [ref]7 . Traffic forecasting is of great importance not only for governments to monitor and control urban traffic congestion  but also for road users to plan the trip using electronic map and ride-hailing mobile apps, such as Google Map and DiDi.\nFurthermore, traffic forecasting provides significant road condition information for various other important tasks in ITS, such as estimated time of arrival (ETA)  and route planning .\nTraffic forecasting, especially the speed prediction is a particularly challenging spatial-temporal prediction problem due to complicated and dynamic traffic patterns [ref]6. Traffic forecasting has attracted a lot of attention in the past. Existing methods can be divided into the following two categories. The first category is the classical statistical methods, such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) 0 and its variants.\nThe main disadvantage of this category of methods is that it can hardly handle high dimensional and nonlinear spatial-temporal data. The second category is the data-driven method analysing the complex and non-linear traffic patterns.\nIn this flexible category methods, traditional machine learning methods 1 2 3 4 5 6, outperforms the first category. Nonetheless, traditional machine learning methods are not the first choice given massive and complex spatial-temporal data though having solid mathematical foundations. Recently, deep learning 7 based methods  [ref]7  [ref]6 are adept in capturing spatial-temporal dependences with large-scale datasets and become state-of-the-art.\nCompared with the relatively early dense networks for traffic forecasting 8 9 0 1, the approach  2 combining convolutional neural network (CNN) and RNN to model spatial-temporal correlations concurrently achieves better prediction performance.\nNevertheless, CNN are good at mining spatial relationships of two-dimensional matrices in the Euclidean space [ref]6 while the road network is graph-structured\ndata which is not in the Euclidean space. The middle part of Fig. 1 show a sketch map of road network topological structure. Recent works introducing graph convolutional network (GCN) to learn the road network spatial relationships and adopting RNN or one-dimensional (1D) convolution along the time axis [ref]6  become state-of-the-art.\nThe graph learned by GCN of most works is constructed entirely based on the geographic information – distance or connectivity of links. Note that distant links may also share the similar temporal patterns, for example, there is a high probability of similar congestion on two distant links near office buildings at rush hours [ref]7. We think that when the state of one link is updated using the spatial GCN 3 4 5, its similar links in both geographic and temporal aspects should be considered. If two links’ speed distribution are resemble for a long time, this relationship should not be neglected in the traffic graph. To construct what kind of graph for traffic forecasting is a fundamental problem. Therefore, we propose a novel geographic and long-term temporal (GLT) graph construction method.\nAs illustrated in Fig. 1, the more comprehensive traffic graph is constructed according to both geographic and long-term temporal similarity of links.\nOn the traffic graph for GCN, the neighboring nodes of each link are selected considering the geographic and long-term temporal similarity.\nThe geographic similarity focuses on the spatial distance and the road connectivity of any two links, while the long-term temporal similarity compares the links’ average speed distribution across the training dataset.\nIn the light of the novel road network graph, we present the geographic and long-term graph convolution operation followed by modified RNN mining the temporal correlation.\nIn such a manner, our GLT-GCRNN can adopt GCN to more effectively capture the spatial correlations of one link and its similar ones in geographical as well as long-term temporal aspects, leading to more precision traffic forecasting. The main contributions in this paper are summarized as follows: To our best knowledge, GLT-GCRNN is the first deep learing framework which considers both the geographic and long-term temporal information when adopting GCN to mining the spatial dependency. We propose a novel road network graph construction method making use of the similarity among links in two aspects. On this graph, the neighboring nodes of each link contains the geographic as well as long-term temporal similar ones. Sufficient experiments indicate that the relationship between two distant links sharing quite similar pattens in long-term temporal is beneficial for GCN based spatial information mining. We evaluate our method on the real-world network-scale dataset which is publicly accessible [ref]6 over the entirety of one year in the Greater Seattle Area. The abundant experiments demonstrate that our GLT-GCRNN’s prediction performance achieves clear improvements over other state-of-the-art methods. We organize the rest of this paper as follows. Section II summarizes the related works. Section III introduces the detailed description of each component as well as the overall structure of our GLT-GCRNN. In Section IV, experimental result comparisons on the real-world open dataset and traffic prediction result visualization\nare presented to show the superiority of GLT-GCRNN. Finally, we conclude this paper and discuss the future work in Section V.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: basic and essential tasks of ITS   .
