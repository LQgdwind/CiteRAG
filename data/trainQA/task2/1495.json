      "content": "Paper Title: Understanding in Artificial Intelligence\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAn intelligent creature needs to know about the real world and use its knowledge effectively to be able to act sensibly in the world. The knowledge of a schoolchild about the world and the methods for making obvious inferences from this knowledge are called common sense. Commonsense knowledge, such as knowing that\n“bumping into people annoys them” or “rain makes the road slippery”, helps humans navigate\neveryday situations seamlessly . This type of knowledge and reasoning plays a crucial role in all aspects of artificial intelligence, from language understanding to computer vision and robotics. . A successful linguistic communication relies on a shared experience of the world, and it is this shared experience that makes utterances meaningful. Despite the incredible effectiveness of language processing models trained on text alone, today’s best systems still make mistakes that arise from a failure to relate language to the physical world it describes and to the social interactions it facilitates . One important difference between human and machine text understanding lies in the fact that humans can access commonsense knowledge while processing text, which helps them to draw inferences about facts that are not mentioned in a text, but that are assumed to be common ground. However, for a computer system, inferring such unmentioned facts is a non-trivial challenge . In recent years, NLP community has introduced multiple exploratory research directions into automated commonsense understanding . Recent efforts to acquire and represent this knowledge have resulted in large knowledge graphs, acquired through extractive methods  or crowdsourcing 7. Moreover, reasoning capabilities have been integrated into downstream NLP tasks, in order to develop smarter dialogue [ref]211 and question answering systems . Recent large pretrained language models   ,\nhowever, have significantly improved human-like understanding capabilities of machines. Hence, machines sould be able to model commonsense through symbolic integrations. Given the large number of NLP applications which are designed to require commonsense reasoning, some efforts infer commonsense knowledge from structured KBs as additional inputs to a neural network in generation , dialogue [ref]211, question answering     , and classification   . In some others, researchers have relied on commonsense knowledge aggregated from corpus statistics exploited from unstructured text    . Recently, instead of using relevant commonsense as an additional input to neural networks, commonsense knowledge has been encoded into the parameters of neural networks through pretraining on relevant knowledge bases  or explanations , or by using multi-task objectives with commonsense relation prediction . Commonsense is indirectly evaluated by assessing the performance of higher-level tasks over conventional Natural Language Understanding (NLU) data sets. Direct measurement of capabilities for assessing and explaining commonsense can shed light upon the ability to represent semantic knowledge, and symbolic reasoning with uncertainty. A detailed account of challenges with commonsense reasoning is provided by , which spans difficulties in understanding and formulating commonsense knowledge for specific or general domains to complexities in various forms of reasoning and their integration for problem solving . Common sense inference in NLP is normally evaluated by reading comprehension tasks that require question-answering about a text by inferring information that is common knowledge but not necessarily present in the text.  evaluated two commonsense inference tasks on everyday narratives (task1) and on news articles (task2), based on two data sets: MCScript2.0  and ReCoRD . These two tasks were also released as challenges in the SemEval 2018 shared task 11, and in the COIN (COmmonsense INference in Natural Language Processing) workshop at EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019. Three baseline models: logistic regression , attentive reader  and three-way attentive network ; and five baseline models: BERT , KT-NET , stochastic answer network (SAN) , the DocQA  and random guess, were presented for task1 and task2, respectively. Systems from five teams during the COIN workshop were evaluated in  among which a best accuracy of 90.6% and a best F1-score of 83.7% were achieved for task1 and task2, respectively. Even with the best-performing transformer-based method, machine performances are 7% and 8% lower than human performance in the two tasks. Also, this particular field is in demand of better data sets that make it harder to benefit from redundancy in the training data or large-scale pre-training on similar domains . Visual understanding goes well beyond object recognition. Understanding the world beyond the pixels is very straightforward for humans. However, this task is still difficult for today’s vision systems, which require higher-order cognition and commonsense reasoning about the world. Various tasks have been introduced\nfor joint understanding of visual information and language, such as image captioning   , visual question answering    and referring expressions   . There is also a recent body of work addressing representation learning using vision and language cues   . However, these works fall short of understanding the dynamic situation captured in the image, which is the main motivation of visual commonsense inference. Visual understanding requires seamless integration between recognition and cognition: beyond recognition-level perception (e.g. detecting objects and their attributes), one must perform cognition-level reasoning (e.g. inferring the likely intents, goals, and social dynamics of people) .\nState-of-the-art vision systems can reliably perform recognition-level image understanding, but still struggle with complex inferences. In the contect of visual question answering, some work focuses on commonsense phenomena, such as ‘what if’ and ‘why’ questions [ref]249 . However, the space of commonsense inferences is often limited by\nthe underlying dataset chosen (synthetic  or COCO [ref]249 scenes). In , commonsense questions are asked in the context of rich images from movies. Some visual commonsense inference work   involves reasoning about commonsense phenomena, such as physics. Some involves commonsense reasoning about social interactions    , while some others involve procedure understanding  . Predicting what might happen next in a video is also studied in       . To move toward incorporating commonsense knowledge in the context of visual understanding,  proposed an approach where human-generated abstract scenes made from clipart is used to learn common sense, but not on real images. Inferring the motivation behind the actions of people from images is also explored by [ref]249. Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR)  tests if the model can answer questions with rationale using commonsense knowledge. Given a challenging question about an image, a machine must answer correctly and then provide a rationale to justify its answer. To move towards cognition-level understanding,  porposed a new reasoning engine, Recognition to Cognition Networks (R2C), that models the necessary layered inferences for grounding, contextualization, and reasoning. However R2C helps narrowing the gap between humans and machines, the challenge is still far from solved. While this work includes rich visual common sense information, their question answering setup makes it difficult to have models to generate commonsense inferences . ATOMIC 7 on the other hand provides a commonsense knowledge graph containing if-then inferential textual descriptions in generative setting; however, it relies on generic, textual events and does not consider visually contextualized information. In further attempt,  proposed an approach by extending  and 7 for general visual commonsense to build a large scale repository of visual commonsense graphs and models that can explicitly generate commonsense inferences for given images. This repository consists of over 1.4 million textual descriptions of visual commonsense inferences carefully annotated over a diverse set of 59,000 images, each paired with short video summaries of before and after. From another perspective, there is also a large body of work on future prediction in different contexts such as future frame generation       , prediction of the trajectories of people and objects   , predicting human pose in future frames    and semantic future action recognition   .\n\nReference markers found: [211]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]211: large knowledge graphs, acquired through extractive methods  or crowdsourcing 7.
