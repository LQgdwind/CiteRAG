      "content": "Paper Title: Tight approximability of MAX 2-SAT and relatives, under UGC\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe seminal work of Raghavendra  showed, assuming the Unique Games Conjecture, that every MAX CSP, including the ones studied in this paper, have a sharp approximation threshold α∈[−1,1]𝛼11\\alpha\\in[-1,1] such that for every ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, there exists an efficient SDP rounding algorithm achieving an α−ε𝛼𝜀\\alpha-\\varepsilon approximation and that no α+ε𝛼𝜀\\alpha+\\varepsilon approximation algorithm exists assuming the unique games conjecture. Further, the follow-up work of Raghavendra and Steurer  showed that an explicit SDP integrality gap for α+ε𝛼𝜀\\alpha+\\varepsilon can be computed in O​(exp⁡(exp⁡(1/ε)))𝑂1𝜀O(\\exp(\\exp(1/\\varepsilon))) time. We observe that Raghavendra’s theorem does not shed much insight on Austrin’s simplicity conjecture. The reason is that the rounding functions considered by Raghavendra (as well as in his revised proof with Brown-Cohen ) are very complex. In particular, after SDP vectors 𝐯isubscript𝐯𝑖\\mathbf{v}_{i} are computed for every variable in the CSP (and a reference vector 𝐯0subscript𝐯0\\mathbf{v}_{0}), one samples N=N​(ε)𝑁𝑁𝜀N=N(\\varepsilon) n𝑛n-dimensional Gaussian random variables 𝐫1,…,𝐫Nsubscript𝐫1…subscript𝐫𝑁\\mathbf{r}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbf{r}_{N}, and rounds variable xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} based on the values 𝐯i⋅𝐯0,𝐯i⋅𝐫1,…,𝐯i⋅𝐫N⋅subscript𝐯𝑖subscript𝐯0⋅subscript𝐯𝑖subscript𝐫1…⋅subscript𝐯𝑖subscript𝐫𝑁\\mathbf{v}_{i}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_{0},\\mathbf{v}_{i}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbf{v}_{i}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}_{N}. This is in contrast to the rounding algorithms considered by LLZ and Austrin which only require one randomly sampled n𝑛n-dimensional Gaussian random variable (this is known as 𝒯​ℋ​ℛ​ℰ​𝒮​ℋ−𝒯ℋℛℰ𝒮superscriptℋ{\\cal THRESH}^{-} or 𝒯​ℋ​ℛ​ℰ​𝒮​ℋ𝒯ℋℛℰ𝒮ℋ{\\cal THRESH}, see Section 2.4). Thus, for the variants of MAX 2-SAT problem, we go beyond Raghavendra’s theorem by showing that simple families of rounding functions are exactly optimal (assuming the Unique Games Conjecture). We hope the approximation community takes interest in improving beyond Raghavendra’s theorem not just for 2-CSPs but for MAX CSPs in general. In addition, the work of Austrin  on MAX 2-AND is closely related to our main results. In particular, he shows that for any MAX 2-CSP, a probability distribution of SDP vectors which is difficult to round with any 𝒯​ℋ​ℛ​ℰ​𝒮​ℋ−𝒯ℋℛℰ𝒮superscriptℋ{\\cal THRESH}^{-} rounding scheme can be converted into an UGC-hardness proof, see Section 2.5 for more details. However, Austrin imposes a positivity conditions on these vectors for the hardness proof to go through. As such, it is currently an open question if every MAX 2-CSP can be tightly captured by Austrin’s hardness framework. We show that for all the problems which we study in this paper–MAX 2-SAT, MAX CSP(({x∨y,x,x¯})𝑥𝑦𝑥¯𝑥(\\{x\\lor y,x,\\bar{x}\\})), and MAX {1,2}12\\{1,2\\}-HORN-SAT–their hardness analyses do follow from Austrin’s hardness framework (or more precisely a mild generalization of the result from [ref]9 which allows for MAX CSPs with non-negated literals). However in each case, we require considerable effort to tightly analyze a matching algorithm,222The hard distribution and matching algorithm for MAX CSP(({x∨y,x,x¯})𝑥𝑦𝑥¯𝑥(\\{x\\lor y,x,\\bar{x}\\})), and MAX {1,2}12\\{1,2\\}-HORN-SAT were found by adapting the code/methods of [ref]9. which is the primary novelty of our paper.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: y,x,\\bar{x}\\})), and MAX {1,2}12\\{1,2\\}-HORN-SAT–their hardness analyses do follow from Austrin’s hardness framework (or more precisely a mild generalization of the result from [ref]9 which allows for MAX CSPs with non-negated literals).
