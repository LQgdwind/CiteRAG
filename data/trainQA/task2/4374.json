      "content": "Paper Title: CD Tools – Condensed Detachment and Structure Generating Theorem Proving (System Description)\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCD Tools is implemented in SWI-Prolog , a free well\nmaintained modern Prolog system and uses PIE [ref]39 [ref]40\nas basic support for first-order ATP.444No efforts were made to support\nother Prolog systems. Brief tries with free systems reckoned as particularly\nfast, notably YAP and Eclipse, unfortunately gave the\nimpression that these are broken in their recent versions. It comprises\nabout 260 user predicates, modularized in a fine-grained way to keep tight\ntrack of dependencies, into 56 modules, which in turn are grouped into 14 sets\nof modules with related or similar functionality.555See\nhttp://cs.christophwernhard.com/cdtools/overview.html. Prolog is\nbased on unification, Horn clauses, and realizing the execution of a\nnondeterministic program as an enumeration of proofs through backtracking.\nThese features are quite close to CD and the approach to theorem proving with\nenumerating proof structures, which is utilized in CD Tools by building on the\nProlog-provided unification and means for structure enumeration. The system provides interfaces to several external worlds: It supports\nconversion to and from Jan Łukasiewicz’s Polish notation typically used in\nthe literature on applications of CD, where the axiom 𝖳𝗁𝗆​(p⇒(q⇒p))𝖳𝗁𝗆⇒𝑝⇒𝑞𝑝\\mathsf{Thm}(p\\Rightarrow(q\\Rightarrow p)),\nin Prolog notation thm(P=>(Q=>P)), is represented by 𝐶𝑝𝐶𝑞𝑝𝐶𝑝𝐶𝑞𝑝\\mathit{CpCqp}.\nPredicates are provided to test TPTP problems whether they represent a CD\nproblem, and to canonicalize their vocabulary. TPTP 8.0.0 (and\nTPTP 7.5.0666TPTP 8.0.0 and TPTP 7.5.0 contain the\nsame CD problems, with the same difficulty ratings.) contains 206 CD\nproblems, all in the LCL domain. CD Tools includes a definition of a\nslightly smaller problem corpus called TPTPCDT2, comprising the 196 CD\nproblems in TPTP 8.0.0 that remain after excluding those two with\nstatus satisfiable, those five with a form of detachment that is based\non implication represented by disjunction and negation, and those three with a\nnon-atomic goal theorem. The restriction on detachment and goals simplifies\nthe problem form. Operations on D-terms in CD Tools are based on the formal treatment and\nconcepts from . An important basic way to associate an\natomic formula with a D-term is its most general theorem (MGT) (aka\nprincipal type scheme\n ) with respect to given\naxioms. It is the most general (with respect to subsumption) atomic formula\nthat is proven with the D-term for the axioms. Figure 1 shows its\nimplementation in CD Tools. d_mgt(d(DXY,DX), FY) :-        !,        d_mgt(DXY, (FX=>FY)),        d_mgt(DX, FX).d_mgt(D, F) :-        id_axiom(D, F),        acyclic_term(F). The occurs check is realized by the SWI-Prolog library predicate\nacyclic_term/1. The given axioms are referenced via the predicate\nid_axiom/2. If this is defined as id_axiom(1, P=>(Q=>P)), then\nthe query ?- d_mgt(d(1,1), X) succeeds with X bound to\nP=>(Q=>(R=>Q)), representing the atomic formula\n𝖳𝗁𝗆​(p⇒(q⇒(r⇒q)))𝖳𝗁𝗆⇒𝑝⇒𝑞⇒𝑟𝑞\\mathsf{Thm}(p\\Rightarrow(q\\Rightarrow(r\\Rightarrow q))), where p,q,r𝑝𝑞𝑟p,q,r are variables. Another way to\nuse the d_mgt/2 predicate is to verify that the MGT subsumes a proof\ngoal given as ground term, as for example in ?- d_mgt(d(1,1),\np=>((q=>r)=>(p=>(q=>r)))). The in-place theorem (IPT), where also\nsubstitution constraints induced by a context D-term are taken into account is\na second important way to associate an atomic formula with a D-term, which is\nalso supported in CD Tools. The predicate id_axiom/2 used in the implementation of\nd_mgt/2 represents a global mapping from axiom identifiers to axioms\nthat is quietly assumed at experimenting, e.g., when computing the MGT of a\ngiven D-term. It is one of the few dynamic (state dependent) predicates of\nCD Tools and can be [re-]initialized with an interface predicate. A\npre-defined association of about 170 common names for about 120 well-known\nformulas, e.g., from  , helps\nto specify these as values of id_axiom/2 and to detect them among\ncomputed lemmas. CD Tools includes implementations of many concepts and operations introduced\nor discussed in , including D-term comparison by\n≥csubscriptc\\geq_{\\mathrm{c}}, various notions of regularity, the organic\nproperty (based on calling a SAT solver777Via PIE, which provides a\ncall interface to SAT and QBF solvers by translating between PIE’s Prolog\nterm representation of formulas and DIMACS or QDIMACS files, commonly used\nby the solvers. In the experiments MiniSat  was\nused. or based on previously proven lemmas), the prime property, and\nn-simplification, that is, replacing complex subproofs of minor\npremises whose goal is irrelevant for the conclusion with a primitive\nsubproof. D-terms allow precise proof size measures that are supported by CD Tools. We\nrepresent here the dimensions of a D-term by a triple that gathers three of its measures: Its compacted\nsize c𝑐c, i.e., the number of inner nodes of the unique minimal DAG\nrepresenting the tree, its tree size t𝑡t, i.e., the number of inner\nnodes (occurrences of the 𝖣𝖣\\mathsf{D} symbol, copies of (Det) used in the proof),\nand the height hℎh of the tree. For a multiset of D-terms, c𝑐c is\nthe number of inner nodes of the minimal DAG representing the set of its\nmembers, and t𝑡t is the sum and hℎh the maximum of the respective values of\nits members. CD Tools provides various predicates that enumerate all D-terms of or up to\nsome given size measure, together with the respective MGT, where D-terms which\nhave no MGT because the constraints on the substitution are not satisfiable\nare omitted. For small values, these predicates can be used to obtain\ninformation about all proofs of a given size. They also can serve as simple\ntheorem provers, forming the basis of the approach discussed in the next\nsection and developed further in .\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: CD Tools is implemented in SWI-Prolog , a free well\nmaintained modern Prolog system and uses PIE [ref]39 [ref]40\nas basic support for first-order ATP.444No efforts were made to support\nother Prolog systems.
