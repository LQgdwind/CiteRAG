      "content": "Paper Title: PIP-Net: Pedestrian Intention Prediction in the Wild\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInstead of pursuing an end-to-end approach for modelling visual features, it is possible to treat various types of information such as the pedestrian’s bounding box, body pose keypoints, vehicle movement, and the broader contextual backdrop as distinct input channels for the prediction model [ref]12. This necessitates the development of a fusion approach for amalgamating this diverse information. The investigation into the types of features, such as pedestrians and environmental context, is still ongoing. For instance, pedestrian-to-vehicle distance is considered one of the most influential factors in pedestrians’ decision to cross . This feature is typically estimated as a single measure between the target pedestrian and the ego vehicle . Alternatively, a depth map of the scene (see Figure 2e) can be used to assess the distance from other road users and possibly reveal the underlying dynamics . However, the depth map is susceptible to noise due to rough estimation, which can lead to inaccuracies in multiple pedestrian crossing scenarios . Studies such as [ref]33  [ref]35 have incorporated human poses or skeletons into pedestrian crossing prediction tasks, using pose keypoints extracted from pedestrian images to construct classifiers. This approach has shown improved prediction accuracy, but often neglects other important features or lacks attention to feature integration. On the other hand, some studies specifically concentrated on feature integration. For instance, vision and non-vision branches fusion  suggest how to efficiently combine diverse data modalities at different stages of a DNN model to surge the intention prediction accuracy. Another study  is conducted to merge two visual and three non-visual elements of the pedestrian, scene, and subject vehicle in a multi-stream network. From a different perspective, in studies such as  , local and global contextual information has been weighted by an attention mechanism  and fused together to apply a prediction on Joint Attention in Autonomous Driving (JAAD)  and Pedestrian Intention Estimation (PIE)  datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: various types of information such as the pedestrian’s bounding box, body pose keypoints, vehicle movement, and the broader contextual backdrop as distinct input channels for the prediction model [ref]12.
