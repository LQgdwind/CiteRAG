      "content": "Paper Title: Hyperdimensional Feature Fusion for Out-of-Distribution Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep Neural Networks can achieve excellent performance on many vision tasks when the distribution of training data closely matches the test data. However, this assumption is often violated during deployment: especially in embodied AI application domains such as robotics and autonomous systems, objects and scenes that were not part of the training data distribution will inevitably be encountered. When confronted with such out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, deep neural networks tend to fail silently, producing overconfident but erroneous predictions   that can pose severe risks [ref]52. It is therefore critically important that OOD samples are identified effectively during deployment. Previous techniques for OOD detection used softmax probabilities   or distances in logit space [ref]17 to distinguish in-distribution (ID) from OOD samples, making the implicit assumption that the features of a single layer in a Deep Neural Network (DNN) contain sufficient information to identify OOD data.\nHowever, deeper layers of a DNN can be more sensitive to OOD samples than the softmax probabilities , which are often overconfident in the presence of OOD samples .\nRecent work investigating the utility of multi-scale deep features from a DNN found that modelling ID classes from raw features is difficult without first reducing the number of dimensions  [ref]26  due to the curse of dimensionality . In this paper, we introduce the powerful concepts of similarity-preserving projection, binding and bundling from Hyper Dimensional Computing (HDC)  to OOD detection. Figure 1 provides a high-level description of our proposed OOD detector. We project the feature maps from multiple layers of a network into a common high-dimensional vector space, using similarity-preserving semi-orthogonal projection matrices. This allows us to effectively fuse the information contained in multiple layers: a series of bundling operations ⊕direct-sum\\oplus creates a class-specific high-dimensional vector representation for each of the in-distribution classes from the training dataset. During testing, we use the same principles of projection and bundling to obtain a single vector representation for a new input image. OOD samples can then be efficiently identified through cosine similarity operations with the class-specific representations. Our Hyperdimensional Feature Fusion (HDFF) approach relies on the pseudo-random nature of its projection matrices and the similarity-preserving properties of the bundling operation ⊕direct-sum\\oplus to effectively fuse information contained in the feature maps across multiple layers in a deep network. HDFF avoids the difficulties of estimating densities in high-dimensional spaces  [ref]26, removes the limitation of relying on a single layer  [ref]17, does not require to select informative layers based on example OOD data   , and does not necessarily rely on expensive sampling techniques (such as ensembles  or Monte Carlo Dropout ) to identify OOD samples. HDFF can be applied to a trained network and does not require re-training or fine-tuning. Our HDFF detector competes with or exceeds state-of-the-art performance for OOD detection in conjunction with networks trained with standard cross-entropy loss or more sophisticated logit space shaping approaches . In summary, our contributions are the following: We propose a novel OOD detector based on the principles of Hyperdimensional Computing that is competitive with state-of-the-art OOD detectors whilst requiring significantly less training and inference time. We show that fusing features from multiple layers is critical for general OOD detection performance, as different layers vary in sensitivity to different OOD data, but fusion results in OOD performance that is approximately on par or even better than the best single layer. We show that the angles between HDFF vectors can be interpreted as visual similarity between inputs allowing for failure diagnosis. We release a publicly available code repository to replicate our experiments at: [released upon publication].\n\nReference markers found: [52]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]52: encountered.
