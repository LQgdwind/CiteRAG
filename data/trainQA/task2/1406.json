      "content": "Paper Title: Fuzzy Commitments Offer Insufficient Protection to Biometric Templates Produced by Deep Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEntrance control is based on three possible factors: what you know (passwords), what you have (devices), and what you are (biometrics) . While passwords have many well known problems (due to lack of entropy and the need to\nsupport users who forget theirs passwords) and devices may be stolen or lost, biometrics is usually considered as a “safe” bet, as it is part of a person appearance or behaviour and is considered to be unique. However, unlike passwords or stored keys which are consistent, the sampling of biometrics is always fuzzy: The capturing process contains two sources of “noise” — the first has to do with the varying conditions (e.g., illumination, change of pose), which are unrelated to the identity. The second source of noise comes from the changes in the biometric trait itself due to aging, injury, etc. Decoupling undesirable variation from person’s identity in an automatic way is very difficult and reduction in fuzziness actually reduces the entropy of the biometric trait (even before the discussion on how much entropy there is in the biometric trait, to begin with). In other words, most biometric schemes and algorithms sacrifice entropy for improved robustness (i.e., accuracy of the authentication system). The question of the amount of entropy a given biometric modality possess is an open research problem. Even the question of which entropy measure to use is complicated, e.g., Shannon’s entropy is unsuitable (as most biometric traits are not naturally represented by binary strings). Moreover, fuzziness in biometric samples further complicates the entropy analysis, as the notion of “similarity” (i.e., two strings representing the same identity) is not based on equality but rather on a bounded distance (e.g., Hamming, Euclidean distance, or a set difference). Some works tried to address the issue in specific contexts, e.g., the amount of entropy in specific representations (e.g.,  in iriscodes) or an upper bound obtained due to a specific attack (e.g.,    ).\nAs was discussed in [ref]7: “The min-entropy of the original data cannot be easily determined, hence making it difﬁcult to conclude the key strength of the resulting system. Even the min-entropy of the data can be ﬁxed in someway, the entropy loss may be too large to be useful and it can be misleading.” These works, however, addressed older representations that are characterized by poor robustness, which inevitably resulted in (a possibly large) entropy loss. The introduction of deep learning gave hope that the problem can be solved — having an efficient recognition with high entropy. The accuracy of deep learning-based systems is considered to be as good as humans, and in many cases, is claimed to outperform people. Indeed, deep learning, which is most popular in face domain, shows good robustness in large-scale tests . One could hope that feature extraction based on deep networks could provide robustness (reduce fuzziness), while retaining the entropy due to identity. Unfortunately, the use of such representations does not resolve the problem, as we show in this work by a series of attacks that compromise the security and privacy of systems employing deep network representations. We start the paper by adapting the attacks of  against a fingerprint access system protected by fuzzy111The fuzzy commitment was later shown to be a special case of secure sketches , and our results are easily extendable to secure sketches and even fuzzy extractors . commitment 0 to the case of fuzzy commitment face based systems that use recent deep learning technologies for template generation. Our findings show that one can indeed succeed in accessing accounts without having knowledge of the biometrics of the user.222In this paper we decided not to address the process by which the face is presented to the system. While many systems use liveliness detection to avoid presentation attacks, our settings are different, as we further discuss and explain in Section IV. We then proceed by presenting our new attack that aims at extracting the raw biometric data from the protected template. After entering into the account, we take a step forward from the works of  and use information from the fuzzy commitment decoding process to obtain the actual binary template333As we later discuss, while systems based on deep learning rely on feature vectors, the fuzzy commitment scheme is applied to binary strings. of the user. We then approximate the feature vector from which this binary template was obtained using a specially designed neural network. Next, we reconstruct a facial image from the approximated feature vector by applying NbNet 1. The attack thus show that fuzzy commitment applied to templates of facial images produced by recent DL, offers insufficient protection. Finally, we show that the reconstructed image can be used to access the account of this person in other protected systems. When\nboth systems use the same enrolment image (as might happen when the user supplies a picture), the success of accessing the account using the reconstructed image is more than 600 times higher than the false acceptance rate.444False acceptance rate is the rate in which the system accepts an imposter as the real user. Moreover, we attack systems that rely on a different template extraction process and even a different enrollment image with success rate which is 60 times higher than the false acceptance rate. Moreover, we tested the reconstructed images against the Amazon Face Rekognition system, where 64.8% of the reconstructed images passed the validation test (for 0.1% FAR), when the reconstructed image was matched to the original image (or 44.6% for matching the reconstructed image to a different image of the same user).\nThese attacks show that our reconstructed facial images resemble the original images in the context of authenticating the user (we discuss in Section IV why this seems to be the only objective metric one can obtain). In other words, not only that the the user’s privacy is compromised, also the security of other biometric systems is affected. At this point, we remind the reader that the privacy of biometrics is a very serious matter. Legal considerations (such as the GDPR or the Illinois Biometrics Privacy act) and technical reasons (e.g., the hardness of changing the actual biometric) demand strong privacy guarantees for storing biometrics. Most notably, we wish to avoid the possibility of reconstructing the biometrics from the stored templates in the case of a data breach of the biomertic “password” file. Hence, our attack actually breaks privacy “guarentees” of modern deep learning facial recognition access systems protected by fuzzy commitment. Furthermore, these attacks imply that using the current state of the art deep learning feature extraction together with fuzzy commitments does not satisfy irreversibility and unlinkability, two of the privacy properties required by many biometric systems. Irreversibility (see for example its definition in ISO 24745 2) essentially suggests that an adversary that obtains a biometric template cannot extract the biometrics from it. Obviously, our attack invalidates this notion. The concept of unlinkability (again, see ISO 24745 2) essentially suggests that an adversary that obtained biometric templates from two different systems cannot identify the shared users. Our attack allows reconstructing the image from the template stored in the first database, and checking whether it corresponds to a template in a second database. Hence, this second notion is currently not achievable by state of the art DL representations of facial images. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II discusses previous related works. Section III outlines the systems we attack, i.e., gives the general outline of a biometric authentcation system, which uses protected templates. Section IV discusses the target for the adversary, her capabilities (the adversarial model), and the evaluation criteria for the success of the attacks.\nIn Section V we discuss the basic guessing attack that allows to unlock an account by “guessing” different faces (and offer an upper bound on the amount of entropy contained in binary templates without any protection). We run the guessing attack to recover the binary template, which we then use to approximate the true feature vector (as detailed in Section VI), and subsequently transform it into a facial image (using NbNet 1). The experimental verification of our attack is presented in Section VII. Finally, Section VIII concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: the issue in specific contexts, e.g., the amount of entropy in specific representations (e.g.,  in iriscodes) or an upper bound obtained due to a specific attack (e.g.,    ).\nAs was discussed in [ref]7: “The min-entropy of the original data cannot be easily determined, hence making it difﬁcult to conclude the key strength of the resulting system.
