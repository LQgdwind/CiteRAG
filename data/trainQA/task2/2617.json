Please, use the VLDBJ version, when it becomes available, if you need to cite the paper.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are multiple ways to define the task of forecasting over time-evolving data streams.\nBefore proceeding with the presentation of previous work on forecasting,\nwe first begin with a terminological clarification.\nIt is often the case that the terms “forecasting” and “prediction” are used interchangeably as equivalent terms.\nFor reasons of clarity,\nwe opt for the term of “forecasting” to describe our work,\nsince there does exist a conceptual difference between forecasting and prediction, as the latter term is understood in machine learning.\nIn machine learning,\nthe goal is to “predict” the output of a function on previously unseen input data.\nThe input data need not necessarily have a temporal dimension and the term “prediction” refers to the output of the learned function on a new data point.\nFor this reason we avoid using the term “prediction”.\nInstead, we choose the term “forecasting” to define the task of predicting the temporally future output of some function or the occurrence of an event.\nTime is thus a crucial component for forecasting.\nMoreover, an important challenge stems from the fact that,\nfrom the (current) timepoint where a forecast is produced until the (future) timepoint for which we try to make a forecast,\nno data is available.\nA forecasting system must (implicitly or explicitly) fill in this data gap in order to produce a forecast. In what follows,\nwe present previous work on CEF,\nas defined above,\nin order of increasing relevance to CER.\nSince work on CEF has been limited thus far,\nwe start by briefly mentioning some forecasting ideas from other fields and discuss how CEF differs from these research areas. Time-series forecasting.\nTime-series forecasting is an area with some similarities to CEF and a significant history of contributions .\nHowever, it is not possible to directly apply techniques from time-series forecasting to CEF.\nTime-series forecasting typically focuses on streams of (mostly) real-valued variables and the goal is to forecast relatively simple patterns.\nOn the contrary, in CEF we are also interested in categorical values,\nrelated through complex patterns and involving multiple variables.\nAnother limitation of time-series forecasting methods is that they do not provide a language with which we can define complex patterns,\nbut simply try to forecast the next value(s) from the input stream/series.\nIn CER, the equivalent task would be to forecast the next input event(s) (SDEs).\nThis task in itself is not very useful for CER though,\nsince the majority of SDE instances should be ignored and do not contribute to the detection of CEs\n(see the discussion on selection policies in Section 3).\nFor example,\nif we want to determine whether a ship is following a set of pre-determined waypoints at sea,\nwe are only interested in the messages where the ship “touches” each waypoint.\nAll other intermediate messages are to be discarded and should not constitute part of the match.\nCEs are more like “anomalies” and their number is typically orders of magnitude lower than the number of SDEs.\nOne could possibly try to leverage techniques from SDE forecasting to perform CE forecasting.\nAt every timepoint, we could try to estimate the most probable sequence of future SDEs,\nthen perform recognition on this future stream of SDEs and check whether any future CEs are detected.\nWe have experimentally observed that such an approach yields sub-optimal results.\nIt almost always fails to detect any future CEs.\nThis behavior is due to the fact that CEs are rare.\nAs a result, projecting the input stream into the future creates a “path” with high probability but fails to include the rare “paths” that lead to a CE detection.\nBecause of this serious under-performance of this method,\nwe do not present detailed experimental results. Sequence prediction (compression).\nAnother related field is that of prediction of discrete sequences over finite alphabets and is closely related to the field of compression,\nas any compression algorithm can be used for prediction and vice versa.\nThe relevant literature is extensive.\nHere we focus on a sub-field with high importance for our work,\nas we have borrowed ideas from it.\nIt is the field of sequence prediction via variable-order Markov models      .\nAs the name suggests,\nthe goal is to perform prediction by using a high-order Markov model.\nDoing so in a straightforward manner,\nby constructing a high-order Markov chain with all its possible states,\nis prohibitively expensive due to the combinatorial explosion of the number of states.\nVariable-order Markov models address this issue by retaining only those states that are “informative” enough.\nIn Section 4.2,\nwe discuss the relevant literature in more details.\nThe main limitation of previous methods for sequence prediction is that they they also do not provide a language for patterns and focus exclusively on next symbol prediction,\ni.e., they try to forecast the next symbol(s) in a stream/string of discrete symbols.\nAs already discussed,\nthis is a serious limitation for CER.\nAn additional limitation is that they work on single-variable discrete sequences of symbols,\nwhereas CER systems consume streams of events,\ni.e., streams of tuples with multiple variables, both numerical and categorical.\nNotwithstanding these limitations,\nwe show that variable-order models can be combined with symbolic automata in order to overcome their restrictions and perform CEF. Temporal mining.\nForecasting methods have also appeared in the field of temporal pattern mining    .\nA common assumption in these methods is that patterns are usually defined either as association rules  or as frequent episodes .\nIn  the goal is to identify sets of event types that frequently precede a rare, target event within a temporal window, using a framework similar to that of association rule mining.\nIn , a forecasting model is presented,\nbased on a combination of standard frequent episode discovery algorithms, Hidden Markov Models and mixture models.\nThe goal is to calculate the probability of the immediately next event in the stream.\nIn  a method is presented for batch, online mining of sequential patterns.\nThe learned patterns are used to test whether a prefix matches the last events seen in the stream and therefore make a forecast.\nThe method proposed in  starts with a given episode rule (as a Directed Acyclic Graph) and detects the\nminimal occurrences of the antecedent of a rule defining a complex event,\ni.e., those “clusters” of antecedent events that are closer together in time.\nFrom the perspective of CER,\nthe disadvantage of these methods is that they usually target simple patterns,\ndefined either as strict sequences or as sets of input events.\nMoreover, the input stream is composed of symbols from a finite alphabet,\nas is the case with the compression methods mentioned above. Sequence prediction based on neural networks.\nLately, a significant body of work has focused on event sequence prediction and point-of-interest recommendations through the use of neural networks\n(see, for example,  ).\nThese methods are powerful in predicting the next input event(s) in a sequence of events,\nbut they suffer from limitations already mentioned above.\nThey do not provide a language for defining complex patterns among events and their focus is thus on SDE forecasting.\nAn additional motivation for us to first try a statistical method rather than going directly to neural networks is that,\nin other related fields,\nsuch as time series forecasting,\nstatistical methods have often been proven to be more accurate and less demanding in terms of computational resources than ML ones . Process mining.\nCompared to the previous categories for forecasting,\nthe field of process mining is more closely related to CER .\nProcesses are typically defined as transition systems (e.g., automata or Petri nets) and are used to monitor a system,\ne.g., for conformance testing.\nProcess mining attempts to automatically learn a process from a set of traces,\ni.e., a set of activity logs.\nSince 2010,\na significant body of work has appeared,\ntargeting process prediction,\nwhere the goal is to forecast if and when a process is expected to be completed\n(for surveys, see  ).\nAccording to ,\nuntil 2018, 39 papers in total have been published dealing with process prediction.\nAt a first glance,\nprocess prediction seems very similar to CEF.\nAt a closer look though,\nsome important differences emerge.\nAn important difference is that processes are usually given directly as transition systems,\nwhereas CER patterns are defined in a declarative manner.\nThe transition systems defining processes are usually composed of long sequences of events.\nOn the other hand,\nCER patterns are shorter,\nmay involve Kleene-star, iteration operators (usually not present in processes)\nand may even be instantaneous.\nConsider,\nfor example,\na pattern for our running example,\ntrying to detect speed violations by simply checking whether a vessel’s speed exceeds some threshold.\nThis pattern could be expanded to detect more violations by adding more disjuncts,\ne.g., for checking whether a vessel is sailing within a restricted area,\nall of which might be instantaneous.\nA CEF system cannot always rely on the memory implicitly encoded in a transition system and has to be able to learn the sequences of events that lead to a (possibly instantaneous) CE.\nAnother important difference is that process prediction focuses on traces, which are complete, full matches,\nwhereas CER focuses on continuously evolving streams which may contain many irrelevant events.\nA learning method has to take into account the presence of these irrelevant events.\nIn addition to that,\nsince CEs are rare events,\nthe datasets are highly imbalanced,\nwith the vast majority of “labels” being negative\n(i.e., most forecasts should report that no CE is expected to occur,\nwith very few being positive).\nA CEF system has to strike a fine balance between the positive and negative forecasts it produces\nin order to avoid drowning the positives in the flood of all the negatives and, at the same time, avoid over-producing positives that lead to false alarms.\nThis is also an important issue for process prediction,\nbut becomes critical for a CEF system,\ndue to the imbalanced nature of the datasets.\nIn Section 7,\nwe have included one method from the field of process prediction to our empirical evaluation.\nThis “unfair” comparison (in the sense that it is applied on datasets more suitable for CER) shows that this method consistently under-performs with respect to other methods from the field of CEF. Complex event forecasting.\nContrary to process prediction, forecasting has not received much attention in the field of CER,\nalthough some conceptual proposals have acknowledged the need for CEF   .\nThe first concrete attempt at CEF was presented in 0.\nA variant of regular expressions was used to define CE patterns,\nwhich were then compiled into automata.\nThese automata were translated to Markov chains through a direct mapping,\nwhere each automaton state was mapped to a Markov chain state.\nFrequency counters on the transitions were used to estimate the Markov chain’s transition matrix.\nThis Markov chain was finally used to estimate if a CE was expected to occur within some future window.\nAs we explain in Section 4.2,\nin the worst case,\nsuch an approach assumes that all SDEs are independent\n(even when the states of the Markov chain are not independent)\nand is thus unable to encode higher-order dependencies.\nThis issue is explained in more detail in Section 4.2.\nAnother example of event forecasting was presented in [ref]5.\nUsing Support Vector Regression,\nthe proposed method was able to predict the next input event(s) within some future window.\nThis technique is similar to time-series forecasting,\nas it mainly targets the prediction of the (numerical) values of the attributes of the input (SDE) events\n(specifically, traffic speed and intensity from a traffic monitoring system).\nStrictly speaking,\nit cannot therefore be considered a CE forecasting method,\nbut a SDE forecasting one.\nNevertheless, the authors of [ref]5 proposed the idea that these future SDEs may be used by a CER engine to detect future CEs.\nAs we have already mentioned though,\nin our experiments,\nthis idea has yielded poor results.\nIn 2,\nHidden Markov Models (HMM) are used to construct a probabilistic model for the behavior of a transition system describing a CE.\nThe observable variable of the HMM corresponds to the states of the transition system,\ni.e., an observation sequence of length l𝑙l for the HMM consists of the sequence of states visited by the system after consuming l𝑙l SDEs.\nThese l𝑙l SDEs are mapped to the hidden variable,\ni.e.,\nthe last l𝑙l values of the hidden variable are the last l𝑙l SDEs.\nIn principle,\nHMMs are more powerful than Markov chains.\nIn practice, however, HMMs are hard to train ( ) and require elaborate domain modeling,\nsince mapping a CE pattern to a HMM is not straightforward (see Section 4.2 for details).\nIn contrast,\nour approach constructs seamlessly a probabilistic model from a given CE pattern (declaratively defined).\nAutomata and Markov chains are again used in  [ref]7.\nThe main difference of these methods compared to 0 is that they can accommodate higher-order dependencies by creating extra states for the automaton of a pattern.\nThe method presented in  has two important limitations:\nfirst, it works only on discrete sequences of finite alphabets;\nsecond, the number of states required to encode long-term dependencies grows exponentially.\nThe first issue was addressed in [ref]7,\nwhere symbolic automata are used that can handle infinite alphabets.\nHowever, the problem of the exponential growth of the number of states still remains.\nWe show how this problem can be addressed by using variable-order Markov models.\nA different approach is followed in 3,\nwhere knowledge graphs are used to encode events and their timing relationships.\nStochastic gradient descent is employed to learn the weights of the graph’s edges that determine how important an event is with respect to another target event.\nHowever, this approach falls in the category of SDE forecasting,\nas it does not target complex events.\nMore precisely, it tries to forecast which predicates the forthcoming SDEs will satisfy,\nwithout taking into account relationships between the events themselves (e.g., through simple sequences).\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: Markov chain are not independent)\nand is thus unable to encode higher-order dependencies.\nThis issue is explained in more detail in Section 4.2.\nAnother example of event forecasting was presented in [ref]5.\nUsing Support Vector Regression,\nthe proposed method was able to predict the next input event(s) within some future window.\nThis technique is similar to time-series forecasting,\nas it mainly\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
