      "content": "Paper Title: TurboKV: Scaling Up the Performance of Distributed Key-value Stores with In-Switch Coordination\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nProgrammable switches in software-defined network promise flexibility and high throughput  . Recently, the Programming Protocol-Independent Packet Processor (P4)  unleashes capabilities that give the freedom to create intelligent network nodes performing various functions. Thus, applications can boost their performance by offloading part of their computational tasks to these programmable switches to be executed in the network. Nowadays, programmable networks get a bigger foot in the data center doors. Google cloud started to use the programmable switches with P4Runtime  to build and control their smart networks . Some Internet Service Providers (ISPs), such as AT&T, have already integrated programmable switches in their networks . These switches can be controlled by network operators to adapt to the current network state and application requirements. Recently, there has been an uptake in leveraging programmable switches to improve distributed systems, e.g., NetPaxos  , NetCache , NetChain , DistCache 5 and iSwitch 4. This uptake is due to the massive evolution on the capailities of these network switches, e.g., Tofino ASIC from Barefoot 7 which provides sub-microsecond per-packet processing delay with bandwidth up to 6.5 Tbs and throughput of few billions of packets processed per second and Tofino2 with bandwidth up to 12.8 Tbs. These systems use the switches to provide orders of magnitude higher throughput than the traditional server-based solutions. On the other hand, through the massive use of mobile devices, data clouds, and the rise of Internet of Things , enormous amount of data has been generated and analyzed for the benefit of society at a large scale. This data can be text, image, audio, video, etc., and is generated by different sources with un-unified structures. Hence, this data is often maintained in key-value storage, which is widely used due to its efficiency in handling data in key-value format, and flexibility to scale out without significant database redesign. Examples of popular key-value stores include Amazon’s Dynamo , Redis 4, RAMCloud 0, LevelDB 1 and RocksDB 5. Such huge amount of data can not be stored in a single storage server. Thus, this data has to be partitioned across different storage instances inside the data center. The data paritions and their storage node mapping (directory information) are either stored on a single coordinator node, e.g., the master coordinator in distributed Google file system , or replicated over all storage instances 0  4. In the first approach, the master coordinator represents a single point of failure, and introduces a bottleneck in the path between clients and storage nodes; as all queries are directed to it to know the data location. Moreover, the query response time increases, and hence, the storage system performance decreases. In the second approach, where the directory information is replicated on all storage instances, there are two strategies that a client can use to select a node where the request will be sent to: server-driven coordination and client-driven coordination. In server-driven coordination, the client routes its request through a generic load balancer that will select a node based on load information. The selected node acts like the coordinator for the client request. It answers the query if it has the data partition or forwards the query to the right instance where the data partition resides. In this strategy, the client neither has knowledge about the storage nodes nor needs to link any code specific to the key-value storage it contacts. Unfortunately, this strategy has a higher latency because it introduces additional forwarding step when the request coordinator is different from the node holding the target data. In client-driven coordination, the client uses a partition-aware client library that routes requests directly to the appropriate storage node that holds the data. This approach achieves a lower latency compared to the server-driven coordination as shown in . In , the client-driven coordination approach reduces the latencies by more than 50% for both 99.9t​hsuperscript99.9𝑡ℎ99.9^{th} percentile and average cases. This latency improvement is because the client-driven coordination eliminates the overhead of the load balancer and skips a potential forwarding step introduced in the server-driven coordination when a request is assigned to a random node. However, it introduces additional load on the client to periodically pickup a random node from the key-value store cluster to download the updated directory information to perform the coordination locally on its side. It also requires the client to equip its application with some code specific to the key-value store used. Another challenge in maintaining distributed key-value stores is how to handle dynamic workloads and cope with changes in data popularity  [ref]8. Hot data receives more queries than cold data, which leads to load imbalance between the storage nodes; some nodes are heavily congested while others become under-utilized. This results in a performance degradation of the whole system and a high tail latency. In this paper, we propose TurboKV : a novel Distributed Key-Value Store Architecture that leverages the power and flexibility of the new generation of programmable switches. TurboKV scales up the performance of the distributed key-value storage by offloading the partitions management and query routing to be carried out in network switches. TurboKV uses a switch-driven coordination which utilizes the programmable switches as: 1) partition management nodes to store and manage the directory information of key-value store; and 2) monitoring stations to measure the load of storage nodes, where this monitoring information is used to balance the load among storage nodes. TurboKV adapts a hierarchical indexing scheme to distribute the directory information records inside the data center network switches. It uses a key-based routing protocol to map the requested key in the query packet from the client to its target storage node by injecting some information about the requested data in packet headers. The programmable switches use this information to decide where to send the packet to reach the target storage node directly based on the directory information records stored in the switches’ data plane. This in-switch coordination approach removes the load of routing the requests from the client side in the client-driven coordination without introducing an additional forwarding step introduced by the coordination node in the server-driven coordination. To achieve both reliability and high availability, TurboKV replicates key-value pair partitions on different storage nodes. For each data partition, TurboKV maintains a list of nodes that are responsible for storing the data of this partition. TurboKV uses the chain replication model to guarantee strong data consistency between all partition replicas. In case of having a failing node, requests will be served with other available nodes in the partition replica list. TurboKV also handles load balancing by adapting a dynamic allocation scheme that utilizes the architecture of software-defined network 3 6. In our architecture, a logically centralized controller, which has a global view of the whole system 6, makes decisions to migrate/replicate some of the popular data items to other under-utilized storage nodes using monitoring reports from the programmable switches. Then, it updates the switches’ data plane with the new indexing records. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use the programmable switches as the request coordinator to manage the distributed key-value store’s partition information along with the key-based routing protocol. Overall, our contributions in this paper are four-fold: We propose the in-switch coordination paradigm, and design an indexing scheme to manage the directory information records inside the programmable switch along with protocols and algorithms to ensure the strong consistency of data among replica, and achieve the reliability and availability in case of having nodes failure. We introduce a data migration mechanism to provide load balancing between the storage nodes based on the query statistics collected from the network switches. We propose a hierarchical indexing scheme based on our proposed rack scale switch coordinator design to scale up TurboKV to multiple racks inside the existing data center network architecture. We implemented a prototype of TurboKV using P4 on top of the simple software switch architecture BMV2 . Our experimental results show that our proposed architecture improves the throughput and reduces the latency for the distributed key-value stores. The remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows. Background and motivation is discussed in Section 2. Section 3 provides an overview of the TurboKV architecture, while the detailed design of TurboKV is presented in Section 4 and Section 5. Section 6 discusses how to scale up TurboKV inside the data center networks. TurboKV implementation is discussed in Section 7, while Section 8 gives an experimental evidence and analysis of TurboKV. Section 9 provides a short survey about the related work to us, and finally, the paper is concluded in Section 10.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: with some code specific to the key-value store used.
