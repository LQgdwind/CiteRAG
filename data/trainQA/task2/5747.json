      "content": "Paper Title: Logic of Differentiable Logics: Towards a Uniform Semantics of DL\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLogics for reasoning with uncertainty and probability have long been known and used in programming: e.g. fuzzy logic , probabilistic logic  and variants of thereof in logic programming domain    . Recently, rising awareness of the problems related to machine learning verification opened a novel application area for those ideas.\nDifferentiable Logics (DLs) is a family of methods that applies key insights from fuzzy logic and probability theory to enhance this domain with property-driven learning 6. As a motivating example, consider the problem of verification of neural networks. A neural network is a function\nf:ℝn→ℝm:𝑓→superscriptℝ𝑛superscriptℝ𝑚f:{\\mathbb{R}}^{n}\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}}^{m} parametrised by a set of weights 𝐰𝐰\\mathbf{w}. A training dataset 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} is a set of pairs (𝐱,𝐲)𝐱𝐲(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}) consisting of an input 𝐱∈ℝn𝐱superscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbf{x}\\in{\\mathbb{R}}^{n} and the desired output 𝐲∈ℝm𝐲superscriptℝ𝑚\\mathbf{y}\\in{\\mathbb{R}}^{m}. It is assumed that the outputs 𝐲𝐲\\mathbf{y} are generated from 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} by some function ℋ:ℝn→ℝm:ℋ→superscriptℝ𝑛superscriptℝ𝑚\\mathcal{H}:{\\mathbb{R}}^{n}\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}}^{m} and that 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} is drawn from some probability distribution over ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛{\\mathbb{R}}^{n}.\nThe goal of training is to use the dataset 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} to find weights 𝐰𝐰\\mathbf{w} such that f𝑓f approximates ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} well over input regions with high probability density.\nThe standard approach is to use a loss function ℒℒ\\mathcal{L}, that given a pair (𝐱,𝐲)𝐱𝐲(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}) calculates how much f​(𝐱)𝑓𝐱f(\\mathbf{x}) differs from the desired output 𝐲𝐲\\mathbf{y}.\nGradients of ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} with respect to the network’s weights can then be used to update the weights during training. However in addition to the dataset 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}, in certain problem domains we may have additional information about ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} in the form of a mathematical property ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi that we know ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} must satisfy.\nGiven that ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} satisfies property ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi, we would like to ensure that f𝑓f also satisfies ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi.\nA common example of such a property is that ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} should be robust, i.e. small perturbations to the input only result in small perturbations to the output. For example, in image classification tasks changing a single pixel should not significantly alter what the image is classified as  . Given constants ϵ,δ∈ℝitalic-ϵ𝛿ℝ\\epsilon,\\delta\\in{\\mathbb{R}}, a function f𝑓f is ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-δ𝛿\\delta-robust around a point 𝐱^∈ℝn^𝐱superscriptℝ𝑛\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\\in{\\mathbb{R}}^{n} if: Casadio et al.  formulate several possible notions of robustness. Throughout this paper, we will use the term “robustness property” to refer to the above definition.\nThe problem of verifying the robustness of neural networks has received significant attention from the verification community  [ref]44, and it is known to be difficult both theoretically  and in practice .\nHowever, even leaving aside the challenges of undecidability of non-linear real arithmetic , and scalability [ref]44, the biggest obstacle to verification is that the majority of neural networks do not succeed in learning ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi from the training dataset 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} 6 . The concept of a differentiable logic (DL) was introduced to address this challenge by verification-motivated training. This idea is sometimes referred to as continuous verification  , referring to the loop between training and verification.\nThe key idea in differentiable logic is to use ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi to generate an alternative logical loss function ℒϕsubscriptℒitalic-ϕ\\mathcal{L}_{\\phi}, that calculates a penalty depending on how much f𝑓f deviates from satisfying ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi. When combined with the standard data-driven loss function ℒℒ\\mathcal{L}, the network is trained to both fit the data and satisfy ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi. A DL therefore has two components: a suitable language for expressing the properties and an interpretation function that can translate expressions in the language into a suitable loss function. Although the idea sounds simple, developing good principles of DL design has been surprisingly challenging. The machine-learning community has proposed several DLs such as DL2 for supervised learning , and a signal temporal logic based-DL for reinforcement learning (STL) . However, both approaches had shortcomings from the perspective of formal logic:\nthe former fell short of introducing quantifiers as part of the language (and thus modelled robustness semi-formally in all experiments),\nand the latter only covered propositional fragment (which is not sufficient to reasoning about robustness). Solutions were offered from the perspective of formal logic. In  8 9 it was shown that one can use various propositional fuzzy logics to create loss functions. However, these fuzzy DLs did not stretch to cover the features of the DLs that came from machine learning community, and in particular could not stretch to express the above robustness property (Definition 0.1.1), which needs not just quantification over infinite domains (quantifiers for finite domains were given in 8), but also a formalism to express properties concerning vectors and functions over vectors. The first problem is thus: There does not exist a DL that formally covers a sufficient fragment of first-order logic to express key properties in machine learning verification, such as robustness. The second problem has to do with formalisation of different DLs.\nIn many of the existing DL approaches syntax, semantics and pragmatics are not well-separated, which inhibits their formal analysis. We have already given an example of DL2 treating quantifiers empirically outside of the language.\nBut the problem runs deeper than modelling quantifiers. To illustrate, let us take a fragment of syntax on which all DLs are supposed to agree. It will give us a toy propositional language They assume that each propositional variable p𝑝p is interpreted in a domain 𝒟⊆ℝ𝒟ℝ{\\mathcal{D}}\\subseteq{\\mathbb{R}}. The domains vary vastly across the DLs (from fuzzy set    to (∞,∞)(\\infty,\\infty) in STL) and the choice of a domain can have important ramifications for both the syntax and the semantics. For example DL2’s domain [0,∞]0[0,\\infty] severely restricts the translation of negation compared to other DLs. Conjunction is interpreted by ++ in DL2 , by m​i​n𝑚𝑖𝑛min, ×\\times and other more complex operations in different fuzzy DLs in van Krieken et al. 9.\nIn STL , in order to make loss functions satisfy a shadow-lifting property,\nthe authors propose a complex formula computing conjunction, that includes natural exponents alongside other operations.\nBut this forces them to redefine the syntax for conjunction and thus obtain a different language where ⋀Msubscript𝑀\\bigwedge_{M} denotes a (non-associative!) conjunction for M𝑀M elements. As consequence of the above two problems, the third problem is lack of unified, general syntax and semantics able to express multiple different DLs and modular on the choice of DL, that would make it possible to choose one best suited for concrete task or design new DLs in an easy way. In this paper, we propose a solution to all of these problems. The solution comes in a form of a meta-DL, which we call a logic of differentiable logics (LDL). On the syntactic side (Section 0.3),\nit is a typed first-order language with negation and universal and existential quantification that can express properties of functions and vectors. On the semantic side (Section 0.4), interpretation is defined to be parametric on the choice of the interpretation domain 𝒟𝒟{\\mathcal{D}} or a particular choice of logical connectives.\nThis parametric nature of interpretation simplifies both the theoretical study and implementations that compare different DLs. Moreover, the language has an implicit formal treatment of neural networks via a special kind of context – a solution that we found necessary in achieving a sufficient level of generality in the semantics. For the first time the semantics formally introduces the notion of a probability distribution that corresponds to the data from which the data is assumed to be drawn. We demonstrate the power of this approach by using LDL to\nprove soundness of various DLs in Sections 0.5.1, 0.5.1 and systematically compare their geometric properties in Section 0.5.2. In Section 0.5.3 we use LDL to provide a uniform empirical comparison of performance of all mentioned DLs\non improving robustness.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: use the term “robustness property” to refer to the above definition.\nThe problem of verifying the robustness of neural networks has received significant attention from the verification community  [ref]44, and it is known to be difficult both theoretically  and in practice .\nHowever, even leaving aside the challenges of undecidability of non-linear real arithmetic , and scalability [ref]44,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
