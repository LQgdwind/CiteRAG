      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Efficient and Reliable LLM Serving: A Real-World Workload Study\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent years marked a new era for generative AI applications with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly OpenAI’s ChatGPT services [ref]1[ref]2. The advent of ChatGPT not only revolutionized user interactions but also catalyzed the development of other LLMs, such as Google’s Bard [ref]3 and Meta’s Llama . However, despite their potential, deploying and operating LLM services is costly. LLMs’ substantial computational and storage requirements necessitate significant AI accelerator resources , presenting a major challenge for smaller organizations aiming to offer such services. To address the costs associated with LLM serving, existing serving systems primarily focus on optimizing system throughput and achieving service-level objectives (SLOs). However, more comprehensive evaluations of these systems are limited by the absence of real-world workloads. Consequently, these studies often resort to using non-LLM serving workloads in experiments, derived either from synthetic models or other open-source services, e.g., Microsoft Azure Functions (MAF)  for lightweight applications. While these non-LLM traces provide some insights into the bursty workloads, they fail to accurately reflect the unique characteristics of real-world LLM serving. In addressing this gap, we introduce the first dataset of real-world LLM serving workloads, named BurstGPT. This dataset provides insights into the characteristics of LLM serving workloads. BurstGPT is gathered over two months within a campus. It contains 1,429.7 thousand pairs of request-response lengths from both ChatGPT and GPT-4 models, utilized in conversation and API services. Each pair of request-response lengths includes the associated timestamps of request submissions. Importantly, to ensure user privacy, the content of requests and responses is not recorded. Additionally, this dataset includes frequent unsuccessful requests, offering insights into the reliability of LLM serving. To leverage BurstGPT for LLM evaluation, particularly to investigate the reliability of LLM serving, we developed a benchmark suite based on a mirrored version of BurstGPT. This suite models BurstGPT and scales it to fit any system size, fitting real-world prompts to the request length distributions for actual serving. It aids in the assessment of the performance and reliability of serving systems. We utilized this benchmark suite to evaluate vLLM , a state-of-the-art LLM serving system, as a case study in this work. Our key findings in the analysis of BurstGPT, as well as the evaluation of vLLM on BurstGPT, are listed below: Burstiniess in Temporal Patterns of LLM Workloads. ❶ We identify unique periodical and aperiodical patterns in the bursty concurrency of LLM workloads, varying by service and model types. This insight suggests the need for model-specific and service-specific concurrency evaluations and workload provisioning in the future. ❷ The variation of bursty concurrency differs across services. API services exhibit more rapid changes compared to conversation services. Unique Spatial and Traffic Patterns in LLM Serving. The request and response lengths in LLM serving present distinct spatial patterns, characterized by longer runtime or response lengths during generative inference. This is reflected in the variability of response length distributions, and the elevated system throughput when the response lengths are collectively long. High Failure Rates in LLM Serving. We observe a relatively high failure rate in LLM serving, primarily attributed to the substantial GPU resource occupation. Increased burstiness leads to memory bottlenecks, causing spikes in failure rates and performance degradation. The rest of the paper is organized as follows:\nSection II provides an overview of LLM serving, including foundational concepts, challenges, and the motivation for our trace-based analysis.\nThen, Section III details the temporal and spatial workload characteristics of BurstGPT observed in our trace data, focusing on the periodic and aperiodic patterns of burstiness observed over varying timeframes, including minutes, hours, and days. Additionally, this section presents insights into the reliability of GPT services as gleaned from our data.\nAfter that, Section IV outlines the benchmark suite we provide with BurstGPT. This includes a detailed description of how to utilize the models observed in Section III, the workflow of the suite, and how it works with existing LLM serving frameworks.\nFinally, Section V presents our case study evaluation’s results and detailed analysis. Then Section VI provides comprehensive discussions of these findings.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Recent years marked a new era for generative AI applications with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly OpenAI’s ChatGPT services [ref]1[ref]2.
