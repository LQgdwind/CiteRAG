      "content": "Paper Title: NeuroQL: A Neuro-Symbolic Language and Dataset for Inter-Subjective Reasoning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur digital world comprises of information sources with varying degrees of objectivity and subjectivity. Structured\ninformation stored in databases or other IR systems (such as for e.g. the physical properties and prices of products) are presented as objective facts to potential customers, while their accompanying free-form reviews fall by definition in the subjective part of this spectrum. Yet, as users of these systems we are interested in questions involving both aspects. These are questions where both the authoritative structured data of a product and the unstructured opinions of the general public are pertinent. Consider for example the search query:\n“How is the bass for headphones at around 30 dollars having minimum 14K reviews that is not discontinued?” which we depict in Fig. 1: We call this type of questions inter-subjective given that they involve a mixture of subjective and objective information that may be shared by different parties. Currently, answers to such queries are treated with a semi-manual two stage process by information systems. In the first step the user needs to pinpoint a single product of interest using a query involving only its objective properties and description (e.g a query involving the title, price, number of reviews etc. as in the example above). Then in the second step, the user needs to scan the reviews of this product either manually or with a similarity search in order to find relevant subjective opinions regarding the quality of the product (e.g. the quality of the bass in the above example). With the advent of deep-learning [ref]24  for natural-language processing  and more specifically deep-learning Q&A (Question & Answering) models , this second step can now be supplemented with neural retrieval and neural comprehension of reviews. In this work we investigate the possibility of automating and merging these two stages that involve both symbolic reasoning (over structured factual information) and neuronal reasoning (over unstructured subjective sources). The problem of interfacing symbolic and neuronal reasoning, is a known open problem in AI literature involving neuro-symbolic systems  . Our contribution is to propose a new AI task and baseline solution for inter-subjective queries and reasoning, as the one we saw above. To this end we introduce the NeuroQL dataset and DSL (Domain-specific Language  ) as a baseline solution for this problem. Our dataset extends previous work on Q&A systems focused on metadata [ref]31 and subjective [ref]4 information to include inter-subjective questions and their translation into neuro-symbolic queries. Our queries are expressed in NeuroQL which is a neuro-symbolic language that we embed inside the Python  runtime environment. This embedded DSL implements and extends logical unification   with neural primitives for extraction and retrieval. NeuroQL can function as a target for automatic translation of inter-subjective questions (posed in natural language) into the neuro-symbolic code that can answer them, as we show in Figure 2: In this figure we show our goals and hypotheses regarding NeuroQL. Firstly, we hypothesize that: (H1): It is possible to translate inter-subjective questions (as the one shown on top of Figure 2), comprising of different subjective and objective components, into neuro-symbolic queries expressed in NeuroQL. To test (H1) we experiment with a neural translation solution fine-tuned to this domain, aiming to distinguish not only between objective and subjective components, but also between different kinds of sub-query categories (i.e. opinion, title, price, reviews, manufacturing etc.). These sub-query categories have different translations in NeuroQL (as shown in the bottom part of Figure 2) which are highlighted to match their equivalent categories in natural language. Furthermore, we hypothesize that: (H2): Symbolic reasoning through unification (covering structured objective facts), similar to the one found in prolog   and datalog  systems, can be extended with neuronal reasoning (for unstructured subjective data) in a disciplined manner, producing satisfactory answers for inter-subjective queries. Meaning, that the neuro-symbolic synthesis can be expressed in a concise syntactic and semantic form for NeuroQL users, while still being able to answer inter-subjective queries in a satisfactory way. To test (H2) we measure recall, em and f1 scores  of translated NeuroQL queries against previously unseen inter-subjective questions. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the results of our effort including: a hands-on walk-through of NeuroQL (sub-section 2.1), a description of the NeuroQL inference pipeline (sub-section 2.2), a description of the NeuroQL dataset (sub-section 2.3), our translation, recall, em and f1 experiments (sub-section 2.4) as well as a further review of related work (sub-section 2.5). Section 3 discusses the implications of our contribution, possible threats to validity and future perspectives. Finally, Section 4 concludes the paper with pertinent methodological comments.
