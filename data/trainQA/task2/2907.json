      "content": "Paper Title: Exploiting Cross-Modal Prediction and Relation Consistency for Semi-Supervised Image Captioning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, deep networks achieve strong performance by supervised learning, which requires a large number of labeled data. However, it comes at a significant cost when labeling by human labor, especially by domain experts. To this end,\nsemi-supervised learning, which concerns combining supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to perform certain learning tasks and permits harnessing the large amounts of unlabeled data in combination with typically smaller sets of labeled data, attracts more and more attention. Existing semi-supervised learning mainly considers two aspects: 1) Self-training [ref]22. The generality of self-training is to use a model’s predictions to obtain artificial labels for unlabeled data. A specific variant is the pseudo-labeling, which converts the model predictions of unlabeled data to hard labels for calculating the cross-entropy. Besides, pseudo-labeling is often used along with a confidence thresholding that retains sufficiently confident unlabeled instances. In result, pseudo-labeling results in entropy minimization, which has been used as a component for many semi-supervised algorithms, and has been validated to produce better results . 2) Consistency regularization [ref]24. Early extensions include exponential moving average of model parameters  or using previous model checkpoints . Recently, data augmentation, which integrates these techniques into the self-training framework, has shown better results  [ref]28. A mainstream technology is to produce random perturbations with data augmentation , then enforce consistency between the augmentations. For example,  proposed unsupervised data augmentation with distribution alignment and augmentation anchoring, which encourages each output to be close to the weakly-augmented version of the same input; [ref]28 used a weakly-augmented example to generate an artificial label and enforce consistency against strongly-augmented example. Furthermore,  combined the pseudo labeling and consistency regularization into a unified framework, which generates pseudo-labels using the model’s predictions on weakly-augmented unlabeled images, and constrain the prediction consistency between weakly-augmented and strongly-augmented version. Note that the targets in previous semi-supervised methods are uniform and simple, i.e., the label ground-truths. However, cross-modal semi-supervised learning is more complicated, e.g., each image has the corresponding sentence and label ground-truth. It is more difficult for building cross-modal generator than single modal classifier with limited supervised data, thereby it may causes noise accumulation if we directly employ the traditional semi-supervised technique for the generated sentences. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section III presents the proposed method, including the model, solution, and extension. Section IV shows the experimental results on COCO dataset, under different semi-supervised setting. Section VI concludes this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: of unlabeled data in combination with typically smaller sets of labeled data, attracts more and more attention.
