      "content": "Paper Title: DiffAugment: Diffusion based Long-Tailed Visual Relationship Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe Long-tailed Visual Relationship Recognition (LTVRR) task aims at understanding the relationships among interacting objects in an image when both the objects and the relationships follow a long-tailed distribution. Since Diffusion Models (DM) [ref]7 have proven to be quite effective in modelling large-scale complex visual-textual space which is naturally long-tailed 6, this work aims at utilizing the generative capabilities of Diffusion Models to overcome the performance bias arising due to long-tail specifically for Visual Relationship Recognition. The goal of the VRR task is to recognize the categories of two interacting objects and their relation, e.g. recognizing triplets like <<banans, hang from, ceiling>>. Due to the enriched scene understanding provided by VRR, it benefits various other vision tasks such as image captioning, Visual Question-Answering and 3D scene synthesis. However, due to the imbalanced class distribution in many VRR datasets, predictions of the most existing models are dominated by the head/frequent relations, lacking generalization on tail/low-shot relationships.\nIn the LTVRR setup which was introduced first in [ref]2, subjects, objects and relations follow a long-tailed distribution. They introduced two benchmarks – dubbed VG8K-LT and GQA-LT built upon the widely used Visual Genome  and GQA datasets  respectively. These benchmarks are particularly challenging as not only could the combination (S, R, O) be rare, but so can any of the interacting subjects/objects (S/O) and/or the relation (R). Moreover, they have extremely high imbalance ratios for both objects and relationships – for GQA-LT, the ratio of the number of samples in the most populated to the least populated object class is 300,000+ and for relation classes, the ratio is around 1.7 million. Similarly for VG8K-LT, the imbalance ratio is 14,000 for object classes and 34,000 for relation classes. A general VRR approach consists of 3 steps – (1) Extracting general visual features of cropped image regions of the subject, object and relation using pretrained object detection models such as Faster-RCNN . These features can be considered as the standard input to any VRR approach. (2) Refining the visual features by message-passing among objects/relations. (3) Predicting the categories of subject, object and corresponding relation using the refined embeddings.\nThe standard strategies to tackle long-tailed imbalance are based upon data re-sampling  or weight adjustment based loss functions such as weighted cross-entropy, focal loss , equalization loss  or decoupling  the representation learning from classifier learning. Another direction for alleviating imbalance involves augmentation of the tail classes, wherein features learnt from the abundantly populated head classes are transferred to the under represented tail classes 6. Building upon these approaches, for Visual Relationship Recognition in the long-tail setting, [ref]2 introduces a Visio-Lingual Hubless loss and RelMix augmentation. Both RelMix and VilHub loss can be integrated with the\nclass-balancing loss functions and decoupling to produce good results. Complementary to these strategies, we propose DiffAugment: an approach which utilizes Diffusion Models [ref]7 to augment the tail classes and overcome the imbalance. Unlike RelMix augmentation which operates on the refined visual embeddings, DiffAugment works at the VRR input level. To do so, firstly, we augment the triplets containing objects/relations from tail classes in the training data. For this, we take the triplets containing tail objects/relations from training data and replace their subjects/objects with similar object classes from the dataset. We make use of Wordnet  based LCH synset similarity  to get the similar object classes. Parallely, we also train a Diffusion Model that generates the visual features of step 1 (general VRR input), conditioned upon the CLIP  textual embedding of the triplets. Next, we sample the visual features corresponding to the augmented triplets from this trained DM, which in turn, can be used to fine-tune any existing LTVRR model. In order to improve the quality of the generated visual features, we further propose two enhancements in the Diffusion Model– (1) Motivated from , rather than starting from a purely random Gaussian distribution (seed) while sampling, we extract the visual features of the augmented triplet’s subject and object from the training data to obtain a better seed. (2) We model the hardness of a triplet and use it as an extra condition while training the Diffusion Model. This Hardness can be interpreted as a constraint on the region in which the generated visual embedding of a triplet can occur, thereby improving the discriminative capability of the generated visual features. Finetuning using our generated visual features shows consistent improvement in the per-class accuracy for different LTVRR approaches on the GQA-LT dataset.\nThus our contributions in this work can be summarized as: To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to employ Diffusion Models in the domain of Visual Relationship Recognition. Our approach successfully models and generates the visual embeddings of captions (triplets) involving tail classes and uses them to overcome the bias in the training of existing Visual Relationship Recognition approaches. Hence, it acts as a data augmentation strategy which can be used on top of any existing Visual Relationship Recognition algorithm to improve the classification performance on the tail classes. We introduce two novel components - a Subject/Object based seeding strategy and hardness-aware Diffusion wherein we define the hardness of each triplet and add it as a condition to the Diffusion Model - both of these components improve the discriminative capability of the DM generated samples.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: (LTVRR) task aims at understanding the relationships among interacting objects in an image when both the objects and the relationships follow a long-tailed distribution.
