      "content": "Paper Title: On Calibrating Semantic Segmentation Models: Analyses and An Algorithm\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep neural networks (DNNs) have become the “go-to” models in various computer vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation.\nHowever, recent work found that DNNs are often overconfident when they make mistakes 1, misleading downstream applications. To calibrate DNNs’ confidence in prediction, researchers have developed a rich line of works on image classification using regularized training    , post-hoc processing 1   5, and Bayesian modeling    , to name a few. However, the extensive pursuit of image classification has left it unclear how to calibrate DNNs for other computer vision tasks and how well existing calibration methods generalize to the tasks beyond image classification. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of the calibration of deep semantic segmentation models. Semantic segmentation tags a semantic label to every pixel in an image.\nOver the past years, we have witnessed increasingly accurate DNN models       for semantic segmentation over various benchmark datasets      4.\nThe progress has benefited many downstream applications, such as medical imaging and diagnostics, autonomous driving, and robotics. While accuracy is essential for the applications, the segmentation models’ uncertainties also provide crucial signals, especially for safety-critical applications — by a segmentation model’s uncertainty, we refer to its confidence in the label it assigns to a pixel.\nFor example, an autonomous driving system can use the uncertainty of a semantic segmentation model (e.g., about drivable areas) to make informed decisions.\n Existing work on the semantic segmentation uncertainty focuses on the medical image domain except [ref]6. Deep ensemble 7  , MC-dropout 6, and stochastic processes 9 are introduced from image classification to calibrate a medical image segmentation model’s uncertainty. These methods are applied to the training stage and some could reduce a segmentation model’s accuracy. We instead focus on the post-hoc calibration methods that do not change the model’s prediction, and our study covers various domains. Ding et al.’s work [ref]6 is the most related to ours. While they proposed and validated a novel calibration method for semantic segmentation, our objective is two-fold. We first investigate the uncertainty in semantic segmentation from multiple perspectives, hoping to reveal the major challenges with the segmentation task’s uncertainty. This comprehensive investigation and insights are necessary for future research, given the limited existing work in this area. We then propose a simple and effective post-hoc algorithm that outperforms and also can apply to almost all existing calibration methods initially designed for image classification, significantly improving their performance in semantic segmentation. To fill the gap of current research on semantic segmentation calibration, we conduct a systematic study. We analyze five state-of-the-art models    4 with six existing calibration methods 1  5 [ref]6 7 over seven latest diverse benchmark datasets      4 .\nFirst, we investigate different factors to study how they affect miscalibration of semantic segmentation models through experiment. Given the observation, we find that model size, crop size, multi-scaling testing, and misprediction can affect calibration. In particular, segmentation model calibration error is more relevant to misprediction when model size is fixed. Next, we study different existing post-hoc calibrators and introduce our proposed selective scaling algorithm based upon the observation of misprediction. Our selective scaling optimizes ECE by reducing confidence of misprediction, which is reflected by more samples falling into lower confidence region (the far left bin) in Figure 1. Then, we carry out extensive experiments across different models, calibrators, and benchmark datasets. The experiments examine both in-domain calibration and domain-shift calibration to reveal calibration variability across different tasks. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: - We conduct a systematic study on the calibration of semantic segmentation models and provide insights to segmentation model calibration. We find that larger models tend to be less calibrated. When model architecture is fixed, larger crop size and multi-scale testing help calibrate models. Moreover, misprediction is important to miscalibration. - We compare different existing popular calibration methods on state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models, and propose a simple but effective approach, selective scaling, which carries out separate scaling on correct and incorrect predictions. - We conduct extensive experiments and justify the effectiveness of selective scaling, as shown in Figure 1. We also extend experiments from in-domain to domain-shift data and show that selective scaling consistently outperforms. - We provide useful calibration observations as a comprehensive reference for further research on segmentation model calibration.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: of a semantic segmentation model (e.g., about drivable areas) to make informed decisions.\n Existing work on the semantic segmentation uncertainty focuses on the medical image domain except [ref]6.
