      "content": "Paper Title: Equivalence-Invariant Algebraic Provenance for Hyperplane Update Queries\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nData provenance has been studied\nfor different data transformation languages, from relational algebra\nto Nested Relational Calculus, with different provenance models\n       )\nand applications     . Our work fits the line of research on algebraic provenance, originating in [ref]23 for positive relational algebra. Consequent\nalgebraic constructions have since been\nproposed for various formalisms including aggregate queries\n[ref]5, queries with difference , Datalog\n[ref]23 and SPARQL queries . A provenance model for SPARQL queries and updates using a provenance graph was presented in , and  proposes an approach to\nprovenance tracking for data that is copied among databases using a sequence of insert,\ndelete, copy, and paste actions. Provenance for updates was also studied in   and in , where a boolean provenance model for updates was proposed; however, none of these approaches has proposed an algebraic provenance model. Updates are a form of non-monotone reasoning, and as such are related to the notion of relational difference. Algebraic provenance models for queries with difference have been proposed in   , but naturally none could be directly applied to update queries; in particular using the ‚Äúmonus‚Äù operation of   as our minus operation may not result in a structure satisfying the equivalence axioms. Further exploration of the connections between these models and ours is left for future work. An extension of the semiring model of [ref]23 to account for updates was also studied in , however the focus there is on the use of provenance in the context of trust and while the work includes an efficient implementation, it falls short of proposing a generic algebraic construction. Closest to our work is the multi-version semiring (MV-semiring) model  to which we have extensively compared our solution. We have shown a normal form construction that allows significant\nreduction of provenance size in the context of hyperplane update\nqueries. Provenance size reduction has been studied in multiple\nadditional contexts. In particular, the work of  has shown\na highly effective method for summarizing workflow provenance,\nnamely the workflow operations (modules) applied to a data item in\nthe course of execution. The provenance model used in  is\ngeared towards workflows. It thus captures module invocations, their\narguments etc., which are absent from our model. On the other hand,\nit thus does not capture fine-grained combinations of data items\nthat are captured in algebraic models such as the one we present\nhere. Consequently, their method (which includes, e.g., argument\nfactorization) is not applicable to our setting (nor does our method\nrelevant for their setting). Similar considerations distinguish our\nwork from , that studies compression of network\nprovenance. Such provenance includes information that is different\nfrom ours, involving a record of network events (albeit using a data\nprovenance representation through a datalog-like formulation of the\nnetwork logic), rather than information on data derivation in\ngeneral and data updates in particular. In contrast, the work of   does focus on\nalgebraic provenance expressions. The expressions studied there are\nprovenance polynomials in the sense of [ref]23 (elements\nof the N‚Äã[X]ùëÅdelimited-[]ùëãN[X] semiring), which are designed to capture provenance\nfor SPJU queries but do not suffice for update queries; in\nparticular no counterpart of a minus operator is present there.\nConsequently, the factorization methods in\n  are very different from our normal form\nconstruction, in particular because they rely on a different set of\noperators and axioms. Our additional operators and different axioms\nentail that the methods of   are\ninapplicable for provenance compression for update queries (we note\nthat  also studies compression of query results, not\nonly provenance; this is orthogonal to our work); on the other hand\nour construction depends on limiting the queries to hyperplane\nqueries, which means that our solution is also not applicable to\ngeneral SPJU (or even SPJ) queries.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: from relational algebra\nto Nested Relational Calculus, with different provenance models\n       )\nand applications     .
