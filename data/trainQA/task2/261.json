      "content": "Paper Title: Action Space Shaping in Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStarCraft II is a complex multi-player real-time strategy game and a challenging domain for RL algorithms.\nParticularly interesting for our work is the vast size of the action space.\nFor environment interaction we use the StarCraft II learning environment (SC2LE)  that provides a parametric action space, with base actions and action parameters.\nBase actions describe an intended action such as move screen or build barracks.\nAction parameters such as screen coordinates or unit id modify these base actions.\nThere are hundreds of base actions and depending on the base action and screen resolution up to millions or even billions of possible parameter combinations. We use four of the seven provided mini-games in our experiments: CollectMinerlShards (CMS) is a simple navigation task, where the player controls two Marines and must collect randomly scattered mineral shards as quickly as possible. In DefeatRoaches (DR), the player controls a small army of Marines and must defeat a small Roach army. The goal of CollecMineralsAndGas (CMAG) is to build up a working economy and collect as much minerals and vespene gas as possible. BuildMarines (BM) is targeted at establishing a unit production with the goal of building as many Marines as possible. To study RA on these mini-games, we test the effects of Masked and Minimal transformations. We also evaluate auto regressive policies (AR), which do not transform the action space but are of interest when dealing with large parametric action spaces: Masked.\nIn StarCraft II, at any given time, only a subset of all actions is available.\nTo prevent agents from selecting unavailable actions and to ease the learning, base action policies are often masked by setting the probabilities of unavailable actions to zero  .\nWe run experiments with agents that are either equipped with action masking or not.\nSelecting an unavailable action results in a no-op action.\n Minimal.\nNot all actions are required to play the selected mini-games optimally.\nWe evaluate the impact of removing unnecessary actions from the action space.\nFor each mini-game, we define a minimal set of base actions required for optimal control. AR.\nThe choice of optimal action parameters depends on the choices of base action and other action parameters.\nThis is usually addressed by introducing an order of dependency and condition action parameter policies accordingly in an auto-regressive manner   [ref]2.\nTo study the effect of auto-regressive policies, we run experiments where we condition action parameter policies on the sampled base action.\nFollowing , we embed sampled base actions into a 16-dimensional continuous space and feed them as additional input to each of the action parameter policy heads. For training, we employed IMPALA [ref]36, a distributed off-policy actor critic method.\nWe chose IMPALA over PPO for its scalability to large number of actors and since its strong performance on the SC2LE mini-games . We use ControlAgent architecture and hyper-parameters described in , except with fixed learning rate 10−4superscript10410^{-4} and entropy coefficient 10−3superscript10310^{-3}. The results are shown in Figure 6.\nMasking unavailable actions (Masked) turned out to be crucial for learning on BM and significantly improved performance on CMAG.\nFor CMS and DR we did not see any improvement with masked polices.\nIt is evident that agents trained on CMS and DR did not profit from minimal action spaces (Minimal).\nIn contrast, on CMAG and BM, minimal action spaces improved the performance even for random policies at the beginning of training.\nAgents trained on CMAG showed much quicker training progress and required less samples to achieve the final performance.\nOn BM, we see how RA can lead to significant improvements in the final performance of RL agents.\nWith auto-regressive policies (AR), we did not observe significant improvement.\nWe see that, within the limited number of samples, the agents learned only simple, sub-optimal behaviour, where they choose between few actions with distinct parameters.\nWe believe that auto-regressive policies can be beneficial for learning better policies with larger set of actions.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: choices of base action and other action parameters.\nThis is usually addressed by introducing an order of dependency and condition action parameter policies accordingly in an auto-regressive manner   [ref]2.\nTo study the effect of auto-regressive policies, we run experiments where we condition action parameter policies on the sampled base action.\nFollowing , we embed sampled base actions into a\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
