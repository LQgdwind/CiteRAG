      "content": "Paper Title: Behavioral Intention Prediction in Driving Scenes: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nObservation views have a direct influence on behavioral intention annotation and prediction model designing. Daimler is the pioneering dataset for the prediction of pedestrian crossing or not-crossing, which only has 4 pedestrians in the collection and is captured by gray images. From Fig. 5, the top seven datasets (i.e., JAAD [ref]33, PIE [ref]41, TITAN [ref]45, BPI , PePScenes , STIP , and PSI ) concentrate on the pedestrian-centric BIP with the Ego-View observation, where crossing and not-crossing are two primary intention types. TITAN provides more diverse intention types and supplies the interaction label between pedestrians and road scenes.\nWe can see that NGSIM , HighD , and INTERACTION  are collected from the BEV view. Compared with the Ego-View, BEV observation can capture a larger spatial range of view and provide a complete movement observation. BEV can provide a good ground-truth verification for the BIP or other prediction tasks. However, the pose and the height of the road agents in Ego-View are clearer. In addition, the Ego-View perception provides the opportunity for collision avoidance by controlling the vehicles in time. Apart from the BEV and Ego-View, the 3D point clouds can also capture the BEV and Ego-View jointly, such as BLVD . However, the raw 3D point cloud has no semantic label or fine-grained pose information of the road agents. Some recent works have been done on capturing the pedestrian point cloudsÂ , and the panoramic view by multiple cameras, such as the Argoverse 3D dataset  (with seven cameras) or the nuScenes dataset  (with six cameras). However, these 3D point cloud datasets do not provide the behavioral intention label. Therefore, in the future, these panoramic view datasets can be extended with behavioral intention or behavior labeling.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: dataset for the prediction of pedestrian crossing or not-crossing, which only has 4 pedestrians in the collection and is captured by gray images.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
