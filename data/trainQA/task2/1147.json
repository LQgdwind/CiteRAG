Specifically, message passing neural network (MPNN) is the most popular GNN framework [ref]18  . Let AGG be the aggregate function that collects feature from neighbors,\nand COMB be the combine function that integrates each node’s self feature with those from AGG.\nGenerally, MPNN generates representation for a node vtsubscript𝑣𝑡v_{t} at k𝑘k-th layer as where 𝒉0​(vi)=𝒳​(vi)superscript𝒉0subscript𝑣𝑖𝒳subscript𝑣𝑖\\bm{h}^{0}(v_{i})=\\mathcal{X}(v_{i}),\nand ℋvtk−1={𝒉vjk−1|vj∈𝒩​(vt)}superscriptsubscriptℋsubscript𝑣𝑡𝑘1conditional-setsubscriptsuperscript𝒉𝑘1subscript𝑣𝑗subscript𝑣𝑗𝒩subscript𝑣𝑡\\mathcal{H}_{v_{t}}^{k-1}=\\big{\\{}\\bm{h}^{k-1}_{v_{j}}|v_{j}\\in\\mathcal{N}(v_{t})\\big{\\}}.\nExisting MPNNs use local permutation invariant AGGs to compute node embeddings,\nwhich subsumes a large class of popular GNN models such as GCN , GraphSAGE , GAT [ref]48, Geniepath  and GIN .\nThe family of MPNNs is proven to be theoretically linked to Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) subtree kernel .\nSubsequently, they are at most as powerful as 111-WL test on discriminating graph isomorphisms . More recently, several attempts have been made to improve the expressiveness of GNN beyond MPNN framework.\nThey can mainly be classified into two categories: augmenting node features and designing more powerful architectures. In terms of augmenting node feature, recent works proposed to introduce various additional feature   . 3D-GCN uses additional 3D point cloud feature to differentiate neighbors and facilitate learnable graph kernels .\nMoreover, GNN variants can in theory achieve universal approximation on graph by equipping nodes with randomly initialized feature vector , but they are difficult to generalize to different graphs in practice . Previous work also proposed to augment node feature with substructure count , which however cannot reveal the local structural roles in each node’s neighborhood.\nOn the other hand, the previous efforts of designing more powerful GNN architecture are dedicated to different structural properties, e.g., graph isomorphism  and graph moment . Although AE is an important concept for graph data analysis, it has not been addressed by previous GNN research.\nMore detailed comparison with the existing GNN variants is provided in Appendix A. However, previous works have shown that identifying automorphic equivalence is a strictly more difficult task than discriminating graph isomorphisms .\nSpecifically, two AE nodes always have isomorphic neighborhood,\nwhile the nodes with isomorphic neighborhood are not necessary AE .\nTherefore, it raises concerns about MPNN’s expressive power of AE feature, which has not been adequately investigated in previous research. In this paper, we aim to design a novel GNN model that is provably expressive in modeling Ego-AE,\nwhich falling in the category of designing novel GNN architecture. To the best of our knowledge,\nwe are the first to empower GNN with the capability of capturing automorphic equivalence.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: The recent success of GNNs draws increasing interests in investigating their capability in capturing structural properties  [ref]17.
