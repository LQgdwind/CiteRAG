      "content": "Paper Title: VLPD: Context-Aware Pedestrian Detection via Vision-Language Semantic Self-Supervision\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the recent advances of pedestrian detection, enormous applications benefit from such a fundamental perception technique, including person re-identification, video surveillance and autonomous driving. In the meantime, various challenges from the urban contexts, i.e., pedestrians and non-human objects, still hinder the better performances of detection. For example, confusing appearances of human-like objects often mislead the detector, as shown in Figure 1(a). Moreover, heavily occluded or small scale pedestrians have unusual appearances and cause missing detections as Figure 1(a) and (b). Apart from the object regions, the contexts are crucial to address these challenges. Nevertheless, previous methods still make inadequate investigations on the contexts in urban scenarios. For instance, manual contextual annotations from CityScapes  boost SMPD  on the pedestrian benchmark CityPersons 3, because they share homologous image data. Besides, a semi-supervised model yields pseudo labels for the Caltech dataset [ref]9. However, both these two solutions require expensive fine-grained annotations, especially for training the semi-supervised model. Moreover, other methods learn regional latent contexts merely from limited visual neighborhood 7, or non-human local proposals as negative samples for contrastive learning . Without an explicit awareness of semantic classes in the contexts, these methods thus still suffer from unsatisfactory performance. Besides, some pedestrian detection methods also indirectly handle the contexts. For the occlusion problems, many part-aware methods    1      adopt visible annotations for the occluded pedestrians, which indicate the occlusion by other pedestrians or non-human objects in the contexts. Whereas, these labels still need heavy labors of human annotators. For scale variation   6  , crowd occlusion 5   0  8 or generic hard pedestrians 6 7   4, most previous works are intra-class, e.g., small pedestrians or crowded scenes, and thus irrelevant to context modeling problems. Inspired by the vision-language models, we notice a more explicit context modeling without any annotations via cross-modal mapping. For instance, DenseCLIP  is initialized with vision-language pretrained CLIP model  to learn cross-modal mapping from pixel-wise features to linguistic vectors of human-annotated classes. Meanwhile, MaskCLIP 9 generates pseudo labels via cross-modal mapping and train another visual model. Hence, complementing the initialized mapping and pseudo labeling, we propose to recognize the semantic classes for explicit contexts via self-supervised Vision-Language Semantic (VLS) segmentation, as shown in Figure 1(c) and 2(a). Furthermore, we consider that only pixel-wise scores are ambiguous to discriminate pedestrians and contexts. Due to the coarse-grained pseudo labels, some parts of pedestrians might have higher scores of other classes. Different from the regional contrastive learning , we introduce the concept of prototype   for a global discrimination. Each pixel of pedestrian features is pulled closer to pixel-wise aggregated positive prototypes and pushed away from the negative ones of other classes based on the explicit contexts obtained from VLS. As illustrated in Figure 1(d) and 2(b), a novel contrastive self-supervision for pedestrian detection is proposed to better discriminate pedestrians and contexts. In conclusion, we have observed a dilemma between the heavy burden of manual annotation for explicit contexts and local implicit context modeling. Hence, we propose a novel approach to tackle these problems via Vision-Language semantic self-supervision for Pedestrian Detection (VLPD). The main contributions of this paper are as follows: Firstly, the Vision-Language Semantic (VLS) segmentation method is proposed to model explicit semantic contexts by vision-language models. With pseudo labels via cross-modal mapping, the visual encoder learns fully-supervised detection and self-supervised segmentation to recognize the semantic classes for explicit contexts. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to propose such a vision-language extra-annotation-free method for pedestrian detection. Secondly, we further propose the Prototypical Semantic Contrastive (PSC) learning method to better discriminate pedestrians and contexts. The negative and positive prototypes are aggregated via the score maps of contextual semantic classes obtained from VLS and pedestrian bounding boxes, respectively. Each pixel of pedestrian features is pulled close to positive prototypes and pushed away from the negative ones, in order to strengthen the discrimination power of the detector. Finally, by the integration of VLS and PSC, our proposed approach VLPD achieves superior performances over the previous state-of-the-art methods on popular Caltech and CityPersons benchmarks, especially on the challenging small scale and occlusion subsets.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: from CityScapes  boost SMPD  on the pedestrian benchmark CityPersons 3, because they share homologous image data.
