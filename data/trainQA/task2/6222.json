      "content": "Paper Title: Multiscale Positive-Unlabeled Detection of AI-Generated Texts\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSince the introduction of GPT-2  and its successors, fake texts generated by powerful LLMs are causing ethical and legal issues. Methods are developed to discriminate against these generated texts in various misuse scenarios. Zellers et al.  shed light on machine-generated fake news by proposing a GPT-based news generator GROVER, and uses GROVER itself to sort fake news out; Adelani et al. [ref]1 looks at detection of fake online reviews; Fagni et al.  focuses on machine-generated fake tweets and proposes the TweepFake dataset. Other proposed detection methods are for general scenarios. Several canonical baselines are mentioned by Solaiman et al.  to detect GPT-2 texts, including simple TF-IDF classifiers and finetuned RoBERTa ; GLTR [ref]12 detect generated texts in a zero-shot manner by using token prediction probabilities from available pretrained NLP models like BERT  and GPT-2 . After the introduction of ChatGPT [ref]28, some new detection methods  [23; 26; 27; 13] are released. Despite manifold methods, mainstream detectors seldom take the factor of text length into account, and thus they always fail on short texts. We have tried several existing detection methods for short LLM-generated texts (shown in Table 4), but none of them perform well. As people nowadays are immersed in short, fragmented forms of mobile media, they are vulnerable to LLM attacks with no reliable means to defend themselves. Hence, we are in urgent need of a performant short AI-generated text detector. Intuitively, past works formulated the task of AI text detection as a binary classification problem, i.e. classifying texts as AI or Human. However, the formulation could be problematic for shorter texts as we found high similarities between extremely simple AI texts and human texts. The phenomenon could be rare in actual applications. But it is fundamentally reasonable, because LLMs learn from human languages; and for sentences whose structures are overly simple, they are seemingly \"copied\" by LLMs from what they have learned. Therefore, the attribution of these simple machine texts is uncertain: on one hand, they are indeed outputs from Language Models; on the other hand, they are ordinary human languages. Though the completely non-classifiable case mostly happens for extremely short texts or commonly used phrases (that rarely occurs in our benchmarks and detection of which is of no application value), it inspires us to think about the partially \"unlabeled\" property behind the vast majority of short, distinguishable texts despite their definite labels. To overcome this issue, we model the task of multiscale text detection as a partial Positive Unlabeled problem (PU). In this problem, corpora from human are regarded as \"Positive\", but short texts from machines are given an additional \"Unlabeled\" mark for PU loss calculations (detailed in Sec. 2.3). Then our detector model is optimized within this partial PU context.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: in various misuse scenarios. Zellers et al.  shed light on machine-generated fake news by proposing a GPT-based news generator GROVER, and uses GROVER itself to sort fake news out; Adelani et al.
