      "content": "Paper Title: Flexible Job Shop Scheduling via Dual Attention Network Based Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn Table I, we reported each model’s average makespan and gap on testing instances which are generated from the same scales using the same distribution as its training instances. It is clear from the bold numbers that, for both data across all problem sizes, DANIEL not only outperforms all PDRs by a significant margin, but also exhibits a notable improvement relative to the DRL solution in [ref]32 for both action-selection strategies. Moreover, the optimality gap of DANIEL is less than 5%percent55\\% in three tasks when using the sampling strategy. Most excitingly, DANIEL even beats OR-Tools by 1.03%percent1.031.03\\% on the 20×10201020\\times 10 FJSP instances on SD1subscriptSD1\\text{SD}_{1} data, while all instances in this data weren’t solved optimally by OR-Tools within the time limits. The advantage of DANIEL becomes more pronounced on SD2subscriptSD2\\text{SD}_{2} data. When the processing time range gets larger, performance of both PDRs and the DRL [ref]32 are affected, resulting in a considerable gap to the best solution. In this case, DANIEL still performs well, especially when using the sampling strategy. By means of the proposed tight state representation, DANIEL has runtime comparable to PDRs and is computationally efficient in general. Its runtime is close to that of [ref]32, although implementations of the simulation environment of FJSP in the two algorithms are different. Another interesting phenomenon from the results of PDRs is that SPT consistently performs the worst for all problem sizes on SD1subscriptSD1\\text{SD}_{1} data but performs the best for all sizes on SD2subscriptSD2\\text{SD}_{2}, demonstrating its unstable performance over varying tasks. This may be caused by the very different processing time ranges, since a compatible operation-machine pair with the shortest processing time may have a high priority on SD2subscriptSD2\\text{SD}_{2} but a low priority on SD1subscriptSD1\\text{SD}_{1} data. The training curves of DANIEL and DRL [ref]32 on 10×510510\\times 5 and 20×10201020\\times 10 FJSP instances using SD1 and SD2 are presented in Fig. 4, where the averaged makespan over 100100100 validation instances are shown. It is worth mentioning that our method and [ref]32 used the same training data, validation frequency, and validation data. It can be observed that our method converges to a better solution more smoothly for both data, corroborating its powerful and stable performance. Furthermore, we examined the generalization performance of the models trained over 10×510510\\times 5 and 20×10201020\\times 10 tasks on two data using 30×10301030\\times 10 and 40×10401040\\times 10 testing instances, respectively. DANIEL was compared with [ref]32 and the best PDRs in SD1subscriptSD1\\text{SD}_{1} and SD2subscriptSD2\\text{SD}_{2}. As shown in Table II, DANIEL consistently generates high-quality solutions for large-scale problems with acceptable computation cost, which are considerably better than all baseline methods and occasionally beat OR-Tools. Especially for the 40×10401040\\times 10 FJSP instances on SD1subscriptSD1\\text{SD}_{1}, the model trained on 20×10201020\\times 10 instances with the sampling strategy outperforms OR-Tools by 6.60%percent6.606.60\\%. These results show that DANIEL can learn general knowledge by training on small-scale tasks, which can be employed to solve unseen large-scale instances. Note that the model trained on 20×10201020\\times 10 consistently outperforms that trained on 10×510510\\times 5 instances, which is expected because its size is closer to that of the testing data.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: the bold numbers that, for both data across all problem sizes, DANIEL not only outperforms all PDRs by a significant margin, but also exhibits a notable improvement relative to the DRL solution in [ref]32 for both action-selection strategies.
