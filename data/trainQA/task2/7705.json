      "content": "Paper Title: Cosystolic Expansion of Sheaves on Posets with Applications to Good 2-Query Locally Testable Codes and Lifted Codes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe show that cosystolic expansion\nof sheaves on posets can be derived from local expansion conditions\nof the sheaf and the poset.\nWhen the poset at hand is a cell complex ‚Äî typically\na high dimensional expander ‚Äî a sheaf may be thought of as generalizing coefficient\ngroups used for defining homology and cohomology, by letting the coefficient group\nvary along the cell complex.\nPrevious works, e.g.¬†, [ref]11,\nestablished local criteria for\ncosystolic expansion only for simplicial complexes\nand with respect to constant coefficients.\nOur main technical contribution is providing a criterion\nthat is more general in two ways: it applies to posets\nand sheaves, respectively. The importance of working with sheaves\non posets (rather than constant coefficients and simplicial complexes)\nstems from applications to locally testable codes (LTCs). It has been observed\n that cosystolic expansion\nis related to property testing in the context of simplicial complexes and constant coefficients,\nbut\nunfortunately, this special case does not give rise to interesting LTCs.\nWe observe that this relation also exists in the much more general\nsetting of sheaves on posets. As the language of sheaves\nis more expressive, it allows us to put this relation\nto use.\nSpecifically, we apply our criterion for cosystolic expansion\nin two ways. The first application: We show the existence of good 222-query LTCs.\nThese codes are actually related to the good qùëûq-query LTCs of \nand , being the formers‚Äô so-called line codes,\nbut we get them from a new, more illuminating perspective. By realizing these\ncodes as cycle codes of sheaves over posets, we can derive their good properties\ndirectly from our criterion for cosystolic expansion.\nThe local expansion conditions that our criterion requires\nunfold to the conditions on the ‚Äúsmall codes‚Äù in , , and hence give a conceptual explanation to why conditions\nsuch as agreement testability are required. The second application: We show that local testability of a lifted code\ncould be derived solely from local conditions, namely from agreement expansion properties of the local ‚Äúsmall‚Äù\ncodes which define it.\nIn the work [ref]6,\nit was shown\nthat one can obtain local testability of lifted codes\nfrom a mixture of local and global conditions, namely from local testability of the local codes and global agreement expansion\nof an auxiliary 333-layer system called a multilayered agreement sampler.\nOur result achieves the same but using genuinely local conditions and a simpler\n333-layer structure. It is derived neatly from our local criterion\nfor cosystolic expansion, by interpreting the situation in the language of sheaves on posets. This is a preliminary version. \nThere may be mild typos and inconsistencies. The final version will\nappear soon.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: ‚Äî a sheaf may be thought of as generalizing coefficient\ngroups used for defining homology and cohomology, by letting the coefficient group\nvary along the cell complex.\nPrevious works, e.g.¬†, [ref]11,\nestablished local criteria for\ncosystolic expansion only for simplicial complexes\nand with respect to constant coefficients.\nOur main technical contribution is providing a criterion\nthat is\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
