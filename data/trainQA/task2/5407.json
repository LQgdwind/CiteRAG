      "content": "Paper Title: Risk-Averse Model Uncertainty for Distributionally Robust Safe Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur work focuses on irreducible uncertainty about the true environment at deployment time, which we refer to as model uncertainty and represent using a distribution Œºùúá\\mu over transition models. The most popular approach that incorporates model uncertainty in this way is domain randomization [ref]48 [ref]37, which randomizes across parameter values in a simulator and trains a policy to maximize average performance over this training distribution. This represents a risk-neutral attitude towards model uncertainty, which has been referred to as a soft-robust approach . Distributionally robust MDPs incorporate robustness to the choice of Œºùúá\\mu by instead considering a set of distributions    , but application of this distributionally robust framework has remained limited in deep RL as it leads to a difficult minimax formulation that requires solving for worst-case distributions over transition models. Robust RL represents an alternative approach to model uncertainty that considers uncertainty sets of transition models  [ref]34. A major drawback of robust RL is the need to calculate worst-case environments during training, which is typically approximated through the use of parametric uncertainty with multiple training environments    or a trained adversary that directly intervenes during trajectory rollouts   . Unlike these methods, we propose a robust approach to model uncertainty based on a distribution Œºùúá\\mu over models, which does not require access to a range of simulated training environments, does not impact data collection during training, and does not involve minimax optimization problems. In contrast to irreducible model uncertainty, epistemic uncertainty captures estimation error that can be reduced during training through data collection. Epistemic uncertainty has been considered in the estimation of Q functions    and learned transition models     , and has been applied to promote both exploration and safety in a fixed MDP. Finally, risk-sensitive methods typically focus on the aleatoric uncertainty in RL, which refers to the range of stochastic outcomes within a single MDP. Rather than considering the standard expected value objective, they learn risk-sensitive policies over this distribution of possible outcomes in a fixed MDP     . Distributional RL  trains critics that estimate the full distribution of future returns due to aleatoric uncertainty, and risk measures can be applied to these distributional critics for risk-sensitive learning  . We also consider the use of risk measures in our work, but different from standard risk-sensitive RL methods we apply a risk measure over model uncertainty instead of aleatoric uncertainty.\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: we refer to as model uncertainty and represent using a distribution Œºùúá\\mu over transition models.
