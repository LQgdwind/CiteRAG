      "content": "Paper Title: Smart Data driven Decision Trees Ensemble Methodology for Imbalanced Big Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe are experiencing a constant revolution in terms of data generation and transmission speeds. Technologies such as LTE/4G networks have been surpassed by faster standards like the novel 5G network . This increasing amount of data contains very valuable insights for businesses. This is the era of Big Data . Big Data can be defined as a high volume of data, generated at a high velocity, composed of a wide variety of data types, with a potential high value, and high veracity. This conforms what is known as the five Big Data V’s (among many others) . Most of nowadays real-world data is generated from an Internet of Things (IoT) context . This IoT scenario is composed of a myriad of sensors that generate temporal data in the form of time series [ref]5 or tabular data . Real-world classification problems based on tabular data are not usually balanced. This means that one class (usually the one that contains the concept of interest) is underrepresented in the dataset . This is known as imbalanced classification , and causes machine learning algorithms to bias towards the class with the greater representation. The imbalanced classification task have been extensively researched in the literature . Imbalanced classification has a critical role in Big Data environments, where the imbalance between classes may be greater. This is known as imbalanced Big Data classification . Despite the extensive list of imbalanced classification methods proposed in the literature, we can find only a handful of classic sampling proposals extended to Big Data domains, such as Random OverSampling (ROS), Random UnderSampling (RUS) 0, or “Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique” (SMOTE) 1 2. As stated by recent surveys 3 4, current imbalanced Big Data proposals are usually a direct extension of classic oversampling imbalanced methods to Big Data environments. This entails a key issue for those methods, which is suffering from lack of data in the different maps within the already very small minority class space 3. SMOTE and its extensions constitute the current state-of-the-art for imbalanced problems, however, it lacks a quality extension to Big Data environments due to suffering from the aforementioned issue 4. This leads to a sub-par performance of these methods in Big Data domains 3. In imbalanced Big Data scenarios there is the challenge of new approaches that take into account the peculiarities of distributed MapReduce processing and the availability of several maps with imbalanced subsets that require their own processing 3. In 4, authors identified two gaps within the imbalanced Big Data classification scenario: “the few ensemble methods designed for Big Data problems, and perhaps even fewer for processing imbalance within Big Data”. This assessment for the design of efficient distributed algorithms, in particular ensembles, capable of analyzing the nature of maps by performing an imbalanced analysis of the data , drive our current proposal, advancing towards the use of Smart Data and ensembles. Recently, the term Smart Data has emerged in the Big Data ecosystem. Smart Data refers to the challenge of extracting quality data from raw Big Data  . This new concept aims to achieve quality data with value and veracity properties 5. Data preprocessing clearly resembles the concept of Smart Data to ensure achieving quality data. Data preprocessing is also inherent in all imbalanced approaches . In Big Data environments, Big Data preprocessing has a crucial role for enabling Smart Data . On the other hand, ensembles have established as the most popular algorithm-level solution for tackling the imbalanced classification problem  6. Ensembles and Smart Data have proven to perform consistently in Big Data environments when facing label noise 7 8. Our hypothesis in this paper is their combined use to tackle the imbalanced Big Data classification problem. We propose a novel Smart Data driven Decision Trees Ensemble methodology for addressing the imbalanced Big Data classification, namely SD_DeTE methodology. SD_DeTE methodology produces a decision tree-based ensemble combined with Smart Data for introducing diversity in the datasets, creating different decision trees that result in an efficient distributed ensemble algorithm. Quality data is achieved through the application of several data preprocessing techniques in order to enable different Smart Data approaches of the dataset, that will enable the learning of better base classifiers and to achieve efficient distributed algorithms. Therefore, SD_DeTE methodology is composed of a Smart Data generation process, and an ensemble learning process: Smart Data: the first objective is to add the required level of diversity to the dataset. For this, the combination of Random Discretization (RD) and randomized Principal Component Analysis (PCA), proposed in Principal Components Analysis Random Discretization Ensemble (PCARDE) algorithm 9, is used. For a data balancing step, a novel combination of clustering and ROS is presented. SD_DeTE methodology performs clustering to the expanded data resulting from the combination of RD and PCA datasets. Then, it balances the clusters using ROS technique. The result of this process is a distributed Smart Data version of the dataset, with the appropriate level of diversity. Ensemble Learning: this process creates the ensemble through the learning of different base classifiers using a decision tree as a classifier. The distributed Smart Data will produce better base classifiers. To assess the performance of SD_DeTE methodology, we have conducted an extensive experimentation, using 21 binary adapted Big Data imbalanced datasets. All datasets have been selected from the latest literature in tabular data and Big Data. We have compared SD_DeTE methodology against Spark’s MLlib implementation of a decision tree, Random Forest 0, and PCARDE algorithm 9. These three classifiers have been tested without any data balancing technique applied, and using RUS, ROS and SMOTE techniques. Results obtained have been validated by different Bayesian Sign Tests, in order to assess if SD_DeTE methodology achieves statistically better performance than the rest of the tested methods  1. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives a description of the imbalanced data classification and Big Data problem. Section 3 describes the proposal in detail. Section 4 shows all the experiments carried out to prove the performance of SD_DeTE methodology for several Big Data problems. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: Most of nowadays real-world data is generated from an Internet of Things (IoT) context .
