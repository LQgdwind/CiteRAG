Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

Hence, we use DANN for all the AL baselines described below: AADA (Importance weighted sampling) : This state-of-the-art active DA method incorporates uncertainty by calculating entropy and incorporates diversity by using the output of the discriminator. BvSB (Best vs Second Best a.k.a. margin) : It uses the difference between the probabilities of the highest and second-highest class prediction as the the metric of uncertainty, on which low value indicates high uncertainty. BADGE : BADGE incorporates uncertainty and diversity by using the gradient embedding on which k-MEANS++ [ref]43 algorithm is used to select diverse samples. BADGE method is currently one of the state-of-the-art methods for AL. KùêæK-Center (Core-Set) : Core-Set selects samples such that the area of coverage is maximized. We use greedy version of Core-Set on the feature space (gŒ∏subscriptùëîùúÉg_{\\theta}). It is a diversity-based sampling technique. Random: Samples are selected randomly from the pool of unlabeled target data. Semi-Supervised DA: We compare our method against recent method of MME‚àó¬†[ref]32 with ResNet-50 backbone on Office datasets, using the author‚Äôs implementation111https://github.com/VisionLearningGroup/SSDA_MME. In each cycle target samples are randomly selected, labeled and provided to the MME‚àó method for DA.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: prediction as the the metric of uncertainty, on which low value indicates high uncertainty.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
