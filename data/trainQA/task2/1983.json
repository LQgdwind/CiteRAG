      "content": "Paper Title: A survey of size counting in population protocols\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA population is a network of n𝑛n anonymous and identical agents,\neach holding a state representing its entire memory. The agents communicate through a sequence of randomly chosen pairwise interactions.\nIn an interaction, the scheduler selects two different agents uniformly at random.\nEach observes the state of the other and updates its own according to the transition function defined by a protocol.\nA protocol is designed to perform a common task, e.g., leader election: selecting exactly one agent as leader over the population.\nFollowing the protocol drives the population from a\nvalid initial configuration to a desired configuration (for example, from all agents being leaders to only one).111\nFor the problems of leader election and population size computation, all agents start in the same state in a valid initial configuration. However,\nin some settings, the initial configuration is assumed already to contain a unique leader [ref]9  .\n A protocol is defined by transitions\nthat describe, given a pair of input states of the agents that interact, how the agents should update their memory.\nFor example, a simple leader election transition is (L,L)→(L,F)→𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐹(L,L)\\to(L,F) with all agents starting in state L𝐿L.\nThis protocol stabilizes,\nmeaning that with probability 1, it reaches a configuration that is both correct\nand stable: every subsequently reachable configuration is also correct.\nIn the original model of population protocols , the states and transitions are constant with respect to the population size n𝑛n.\nHowever,\nrecent studies use a variant of the model: allowing the number of states and transitions to grow with n𝑛n.\nOne motivation to study population protocols with\nω​(1)𝜔1\\omega(1) states is the existence of impossibility results\nshowing that no constant-state protocol can stabilize in sublinear time with probability 111 for problems such as leader election , majority [ref]1, or\ncomputation of more general predicates and integer-valued functions .222\nIt is conventional in population protocols to measure the memory usage by counting the total number s​(n)𝑠𝑛s(n) of states agents can store in population size n𝑛n, instead of the number of bits required to represent these states, which is about log⁡s​(n)𝑠𝑛\\log s(n).\n\nThe recent algorithmic advances using non-constant states   1 2 [ref]1 [ref]2     8   ,\nlead to time- and space-optimal solutions for leader election  and majority  problems.\nHowever, most of these solutions    2 [ref]1 [ref]2      8  propose a nonuniform protocol.\nRather than being a single set of transitions, a nonuniform protocol\nrepresents a family of protocols,\nwhere the set of transition rules (i.e., the protocol) used is allowed to depend on the population size n𝑛n. The typical way that nonuniformity appears in a protocol is that the agents have an estimate of n𝑛n\n(for example the value ⌈log⁡n⌉𝑛\\lceil\\log n\\rceil) appearing in the transitions.\nWhen expressed in pseudocode, this is often realized by a “hard-coded” constant ⌈log⁡n⌉𝑛\\lceil\\log n\\rceil to which the code has access\n(i.e., each agent receives the value ⌈log⁡n⌉𝑛\\lceil\\log n\\rceil as “advice”).\nHowever, in measuring the state complexity of the protocol,\nthe space required to store this value does not count against the memory usage.\nNote that this concern is relevant because we count memory complexity by counting the number of states, rather than the number of bits necessary to represent the state. Adding a field with O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) different values does not asymptotically change the bit usage, but it does asymptotically increase the number of states.\nAs an example of a nonuniform protocol using its estimate of log⁡n𝑛\\log n,\nconsider the following nonuniform leaderless phase clock rules: each agent, independently, counts its number of interactions and uses it as a timer by comparing to 12​ln⁡n12𝑛12\\ln n. In this protocol, each agents increment the value in its 𝚌𝚘𝚞𝚗𝚝𝚌𝚘𝚞𝚗𝚝\\mathtt{count} field until it reaches a threshold dependent on ln⁡n𝑛\\ln n (note that “−-” stands for an arbitrary value in ℕℕ\\mathbb{N} for 𝚌𝚘𝚞𝚗𝚝𝚌𝚘𝚞𝚗𝚝\\mathtt{count}): In the above leaderless phase clock, no agent will set their 𝙰𝙰\\mathtt{A} field to 𝖳𝖳\\mathsf{T} before 6​ln⁡n6𝑛6\\ln n time has passed\nwith probability at least 1−1/n11𝑛1-1/n.333\nWe can compute the error probability with a straightforward Chernoff bound application on binomial random variables.\n\nHowever, no uniform protocol can achieve this same task:\nin any uniform protocol,\nsome agent will set its 𝙰𝙰\\mathtt{A} field to 𝖳𝖳\\mathsf{T} in constant time with high probability [26, Theorem 4.1]. In a uniform protocol,\nby contrast, the transitions are not dependent on the population size n𝑛n, i.e., agents lack any knowledge of n𝑛n. The original O​(1)𝑂1O(1)-state model   [ref]9 is uniform, since there is a single transition function for all population sizes.\nHowever\n, uniform protocols are not required to have constant states.\nFor example, starting from n𝑛n agents in state L1subscript𝐿1L_{1},\nthe protocol defined by transitions Li,Lj→Li+j,Fformulae-sequence→subscript𝐿𝑖subscript𝐿𝑗subscript𝐿𝑖𝑗𝐹L_{i},L_{j}\\to L_{i+j},F for all natural numbers i,j𝑖𝑗i,j, in a population of size n𝑛n, can produce all values of Lisubscript𝐿𝑖L_{i} for i𝑖i between 111 and n𝑛n.\nHowever, note that the (infinitely many) transitions are “uniformly specified”: no transition makes reference to an estimate of n𝑛n.\n(This is formalized\nby requiring the transition function to be computable by a single Turing machine  .)\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: population size computation, all agents start in the same state in a valid initial configuration. However,\nin some settings, the initial configuration is assumed already to contain a unique leader [ref]9  .\n A protocol is defined by transitions\nthat describe, given a pair of input states of the agents that interact, how the agents should update their memory.\nFor example, a simple leader\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
