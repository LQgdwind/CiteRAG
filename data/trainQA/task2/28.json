Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Common Semantic Space for Monolingual and Cross-Lingual Meta-Embeddings\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section we describe the pre-trained word embeddings used to generate our monolingual and cross-lingual meta-embeddings. We also include a description of alternative state-of-the-art meta-embeddings. We use the Word2Vec (W2V)  embeddings from Google News (100 billion words). From GloVe (GV) [ref]34,\nthe Common Crawl vectors (600 billion words). As recommended by the authors, we apply a l‚Äã2ùëô2{l2} normalization to its variables. For FastText (FT)  in English we also use the Common Crawl (600 billion words) while for Spanish we use the vectors trained on the Spanish Billion Word Corpus (1.4 billion words)222Cristian Cardellino: https://crscardellino.github.io/SBWCE/. RWSGwn (UKB) [ref]22 combines random walks over WordNet with the skip-gram model.\nWe have used the vectors trained using WordNet3.0 plus gloss relations. Apparently using GloVe instead of skip-gram improves the performance of the final embeddings, so by default GloVe is used. Attract Repel (AR)  improves word embeddings by injecting synonymy and antonym constraints extracted from monolingual and cross-lingual lexical resources.\nWe used the English vocabulary from the four-lingual (English, German, Italian, Russian) vector space. Paragram (P)  pre-trained word vectors learned using word paraphrase pairs from PPDB  using a modification of the skip-gram objective function.\nThe hyper parameters were tuned using the wordsim-353 dataset. The word embeddings of the default model are initialized with glove word vectors. Numberbatch (N) [ref]40 combines knowledge encoded in ConcepNet, word2vec, GloVe and OpenSubtitles 2016 using concatenation, dimensionality reduction and a variation on retrofitting. Numberbatch version 17.06 is used. JOINTChyb (J)  combines Random Walks over multilingual WordNets and bilingual corpora as input for a modified skip-gram model that forces equivalent terms in different languages to come closer during training.\nWe used the English-Spanish bilingual embeddings publicly available. Other word embeddings such as LexVec , PDC/HDC  or context2vec  showed no significant improvements over the previous ones.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: meta-embeddings. We also include a description of alternative state-of-the-art meta-embeddings. We use the Word2Vec (W2V)  embeddings from Google News (100 billion words). From GloVe (GV) [ref]34,\nthe Common Crawl vectors (600 billion words). As recommended by the authors, we apply a l‚Äã2ùëô2{l2} normalization to its variables. For FastText (FT)  in English we also use the Common Crawl\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
