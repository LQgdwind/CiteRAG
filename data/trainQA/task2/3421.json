      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Learning on 3D Point Clouds by Clustering and Contrasting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCurrent 3D sensing modalities have enabled the generation of extensive unlabeled 3D point cloud data . This has boosted a recent line of works on learning discriminative representations of 3D objects using unsupervised approaches. Tasks such as semantic segmentation, registration, object classification, and part segmentation combined with unsupervised pre-training can outperform the traditional fully supervised training pipelines  [ref]39. Unsupervised representation learning approaches could be roughly classified into two categories: generative and discriminative models. Generative models are performed by conducting self-reconstruction that first encodes a point cloud into a feature or distribution and then decodes it back to a point cloud [ref]21. For example, FoldingNet  leverages a graph-based encoder and a folding-based decoder to deform a canonical 2D grid onto the surface of a point cloud. Liu et al.  proposed a local-to-global auto-encoder to simultaneously learn the local and global structure of point clouds by local to global reconstruction.  focused on designing a graph-based decoder by leveraging a learnable graph topology to push the codeword to preserve representative features. With the help of GAN, Panos et al.  trained the network to generate plausible point clouds by combining hierarchical Bayesian and generative models. However, generative models are sensitive to transformation and tend to learn different representations if the point clouds are rotated or translated. This weakens the network’s ability for point cloud understanding tasks. Moreover, it is not always feasible to reconstruct back the shape from pose-invariant feature representations [ref]22. As for discriminative methods, some of them rely on using auxiliary handcrafted prediction tasks to learn their representation. For instance, Gao et al.  self-train a feature encoder to capture the graph structures by reconstructing these node-wise transformations from the representations of the original and transformed graphs. Following the impressive results achieved with Jigsaw puzzles-based methods in the image domain, Sauder et al.  introduced a self-supervised learning task to reconstruct a point cloud from its randomly rearranged parts. However, these two methods are still sensitive to rotation. In contrast, contrastive approaches  [ref]22  , which are robust to transformation, currently achieve state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised learning. For example, in order to learn representations, Info3D [ref]22 maximizes the mutual information between the 3D shape and a geometric transformed version of the 3D shape. PointContrast  was the first to research a unified framework of the contrastive paradigm for 3D representation learning. However, at first, contrastive methods depend on customized strategies to mine and store negative samples, since they often require comparing each example with a large number of negative samples to work well. Apart from that, because of the lack of adequate and semantic local structure supervision, most previous unsupervised approaches are prone to error accumulation during the local structure learning process  [ref]21, which weakens the network’s ability to learn the local geometry. To mitigate these issues, we propose an unsupervised learning method to train a point cloud feature encoder that jointly leverages instance-level contrasting and point-level clustering. The proposed instance-level contrasting representation learning method is inspired by SimSiam , and extends its simplicity to the learning of 3D point cloud global representation. Note that instance-level contrasting only depends on the positive pairs. The point-level clustering, which is formulated by implementing an EM-like algorithm, provides local supervision to extract discriminative local features. Our method remains agnostic to the specific choice of the 3D representation or the underlying neural network architecture.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: such as semantic segmentation, registration, object classification, and part segmentation combined with unsupervised pre-training can outperform the traditional fully supervised training pipelines  [ref]39.
