      "content": "Paper Title: Enhancing a Neurocognitive Shared Visuomotor Model for Object Identification, Localization, and Grasping With Learning From Auxiliary Tasks The authors gratefully acknowledge partial support from the German Research Foundation DFG under project CML (TRR 169).\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nObject detection is the combined problem of classifying and localizing an object in an image. For classification, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is an established solution. Such models have a conic structure of interleaved convolutional and pooling layers. As deeper layers represent higher-level features at a lower resolution, CNNs perform well at determining what is shown in an image but not precisely where it appears.\nIn contrast, models for object localization rely on accurate spatial information to detect the position of an object. Two-stage models utilize two independent neural networks. The first stage proposes a set of regions in the input image that are likely to contain objects, whereas the second stage classifies those candidate regions¬†. The underlying assumption is that objects that completely fill the proposed region will be classified with high confidence. Single-stage models were introduced to reduce the number of necessary computations.\nIn single-stage models, both the proposal generation and classification share the same convolutional features extracted by a common subnetwork often referred to as a backbone¬†[ref]34.\nSingle-stage approaches such as YOLO¬†[ref]33 require less processing time by classifying objects over a regular sampling of possible locations. Until the release of Retinanet¬†[ref]29, single-stage models were outperformed by two-stage models.\nThe Retinanet has been shown to outperform other single-stage¬†[ref]33   and multiple stage detectors¬† [ref]34, for instance, on the challenging COCO¬† dataset. This success is partially attributed to the focal loss, employed for coping with the class imbalance in the training data, which features an overwhelming number of easy-to-classify negative samples. These easy negatives show only small parts of an object or the background. While a simple factor can give more weight to positive samples, the focal loss also de-emphasizes the loss of well-classified samples while enhancing the loss of misclassified samples. The focal loss ensures that the gradient for updating the network is dominated by those samples that are still difficult to classify and not those that the network can already classify well, which would lead to a stagnation of the learning process. The focal loss is defined as: where pt‚àà subscriptùëùùë°01p_{t}\\in  is the model‚Äôs probability estimate for a given class, Œ±‚àà ùõº01\\alpha\\in  is a balancing factor for weighing the influence of a class, and Œ≥‚©æ0ùõæ0\\gamma\\geqslant 0 defined as the tunable focusing parameter which exponentially down-weighs easy examples.\nThe Retinanet model consists of a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a deep residual network called a Resnet, forming its backbone.\nThe residual network is a convolutional network with skip connections; these are connections that propagate the error across layers, thus assisting in overcoming the vanishing gradient problem, particularly for deep models.\nThe Resnet is connected at multiple stages to an FPN. An FPN can be seen as a complementary top-down path to a CNN, utilizing lateral connections to build a high-level semantic feature map at different scales.\nThe FPN overcomes the CNN‚Äôs limitation of having layers with either high-level features or high spatial resolution.\nRegression and classification subnetworks extend from the FPN. The detection output (classification and localization) is extracted from the FPN heads.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: necessary computations.\nIn single-stage models, both the proposal generation and classification share the same convolutional features extracted by a common subnetwork often referred to as a backbone¬†[ref]34.\nSingle-stage approaches such as YOLO¬†[ref]33 require less processing time by classifying objects over a regular sampling of possible locations.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
