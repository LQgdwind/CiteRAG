We construct a causal graph with 9 nodes X1,⋯,X8subscript𝑋1⋯subscript𝑋8X_{1},\\cdots,X_{8} and X0subscript𝑋0X_{0}, such that Xi⪰Xi+1succeeds-or-equalssubscript𝑋𝑖subscript𝑋𝑖1X_{i}\\succeq X_{i+1}. Then, we randomly choose two nodes in X1,⋯,Xi−1subscript𝑋1⋯subscript𝑋𝑖1X_{1},\\cdots,X_{i-1} and also X0subscript𝑋0X_{0} to be the parent of Xi​(i≥1)subscript𝑋𝑖𝑖1X_{i}(i\\geq 1). Y𝑌Y has 4 parents, and they are randomly chosen in 𝑿={X1​⋯,X8}𝑿subscript𝑋1⋯subscript𝑋8\\boldsymbol{X}=\\{X_{1}\\cdots,X_{8}\\}. For X0subscript𝑋0X_{0}, we know P​(X0=1)=1𝑃subscript𝑋011P(X_{0}=1)=1.\nFor node Xisubscript𝑋𝑖X_{i} and their parent Xi(1),Xi(2)superscriptsubscript𝑋𝑖1superscriptsubscript𝑋𝑖2X_{i}^{(1)},X_{i}^{(2)}, P​(Xi=1)=0.4​X0+0.1​Xi(1)+0.1​Xi(2)𝑃subscript𝑋𝑖10.4subscript𝑋00.1superscriptsubscript𝑋𝑖10.1superscriptsubscript𝑋𝑖2P(X_{i}=1)=0.4X_{0}+0.1X_{i}^{(1)}+0.1X_{i}^{(2)}.

Suppose the parents of reward variable are X(1),X(2),X(3),X(4)superscript𝑋1superscript𝑋2superscript𝑋3superscript𝑋4X^{(1)},X^{(2)},X^{(3)},X^{(4)} The reward variable is defined by P​(Y=1)=0.3​X(1)+0.3​X(2)+0.3​X(3)+0.05​X(4)𝑃𝑌10.3superscript𝑋10.3superscript𝑋20.3superscript𝑋30.05superscript𝑋4P(Y=1)=0.3X^{(1)}+0.3X^{(2)}+0.3X^{(3)}+0.05X^{(4)}. The action set is {do(𝑺=1∣|𝑺|=3,𝑺⊂𝑿)}\\{do(\\boldsymbol{S}=\\textbf{1}\\mid|\\boldsymbol{S}|=3,\\boldsymbol{S}\\subset\\boldsymbol{X})\\}. Hence the optimal arm is d​o​({X(1),X(2),X(3)}=1)𝑑𝑜superscript𝑋1superscript𝑋2superscript𝑋31do(\\{X^{(1)},X^{(2)},X^{(3)}\\}=\\textbf{1}). We choose 4 algorithms in this experiment: LUCB in , lilUCB-heuristic in , Propagating-Inference in [ref]35 and our CCPE-BGLM. LUCB and lilUCB-heuristic are classical pure exploration algorithm. Because in previous causal bandit literature, Propagating-Inference is the only algorithm considering combinatorial action set without prior knowledge P​(𝑷𝒂​(Y)∣a)𝑃conditional𝑷𝒂𝑌𝑎P(\\boldsymbol{\\it Pa}(Y)\\mid a) for action a∈𝑨𝑎𝑨a\\in\\boldsymbol{A}, we choose it in this experiment. Note that the criteria of Propagating-Inference algorithm is simple regret, hence it cannot directly compare to our pure exploration algorithm. We choose to compare the error probability at some fixed time T𝑇T instead.\nIn this criteria, Propagating-Inference algorithm will have an extra knowledge of budget T𝑇T while LUCB, lilUCB-heuristic and CCPE-BGLM not.\nTo implement the Propagating Inference algorithm, we follows the modification in [ref]35 to make this algorithm more efficient and accurate by setting λ=0𝜆0\\lambda=0 and ηA=1/Csubscript𝜂𝐴1𝐶\\eta_{A}=1/C. (Defined and stated in [ref]35.)\nFor CCPE-BGLM, we ignore the condition that t≥max⁡{c​Dη2​log⁡n​t2δ,1024​(M(2))2​(4​D2−3)​Dκ4​η​(D2+ln⁡3​n​t2δ)}𝑡𝑐𝐷superscript𝜂2𝑛superscript𝑡2𝛿1024superscriptsuperscript𝑀224superscript𝐷23𝐷superscript𝜅4𝜂superscript𝐷23𝑛superscript𝑡2𝛿t\\geq\\max\\{\\frac{cD}{\\eta^{2}}\\log\\frac{nt^{2}}{\\delta},\\frac{1024(M^{(2)})^{2}(4D^{2}-3)D}{\\kappa^{4}\\eta}(D^{2}+\\ln\\frac{3nt^{2}}{\\delta})\\}, to make it more efficient. During our experiment, the error probability is smaller than other algorithm even if we ignore this condition.\nAlso, to make this algorithm more efficient, we update observational confidence bound (Line 11) each 50 rounds. (This will not influence the proof of Theorem 1.)\nFor LUCB, lilUCB-heuristic and CCPE-BGLM, we find the best exploration parameter α𝛼\\alpha, αIsubscript𝛼𝐼\\alpha_{I} and αOsubscript𝛼𝑂\\alpha_{O} by grid search from {0.05,0.1,⋯,1}0.050.1⋯1\\{0.05,0.1,\\cdots,1\\}. (Exploration parameter α𝛼\\alpha for UCB-type algorithm is a constant multiplied in front of the confidence radius, which should be tuned in practice. e.g.(, .) For this task, we find α=0.3𝛼0.3\\alpha=0.3, αO=0.05,αI=0.4formulae-sequencesubscript𝛼𝑂0.05subscript𝛼𝐼0.4\\alpha_{O}=0.05,\\alpha_{I}=0.4. We choose T=50+50​i𝑇5050𝑖T=50+50i for 0≤i≤90𝑖90\\leq i\\leq 9. For each time T𝑇T, we run 100 iterations and average the result. As the Figure 4 shows, even if our algorithm does not know the budget T𝑇T, our algorithm converges quicker than all other algorithms.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: We choose 4 algorithms in this experiment: LUCB in , lilUCB-heuristic in , Propagating-Inference in [ref]35 and our CCPE-BGLM.
