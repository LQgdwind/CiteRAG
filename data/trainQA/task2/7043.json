      "content": "Paper Title: On the Fine-Grained Query Complexity of Symmetric Functions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo study the fine-grained Watrous conjecture, we start with the following two fundamental symmetric Boolean functions, which are also essential to analyze general symmetric functions: where 1≤k≤n/21𝑘𝑛21\\leq k\\leq n/2 and where k<l𝑘𝑙k<l.\nThe famous Deutsch-Jozsa problem [ref]21 and the decision version of the unstructured search problem  can be interpreted as special cases of these two functions. Fefferman and Kimmel considered the subset-sized checking problem  , where the n𝑛n-bit input string is promised to have either n𝑛\\sqrt{n} or 0.99​n0.99𝑛0.99\\sqrt{n} many marked items, and the goal is to decide which case. Their result together with  proved that it can be served as an oracle separation between 𝖠𝖬𝖠𝖬\\mathsf{AM} and 𝖰𝖢𝖬𝖠𝖰𝖢𝖬𝖠\\mathsf{QCMA}.\nOn a similar flavour,  introduced the approximate counting problem, where the n𝑛n-bit input has either ≤wabsent𝑤\\leq w or ≥2​wabsent2𝑤\\geq 2w many marked items.\nOur function fnk,l​(⋅)superscriptsubscript𝑓𝑛𝑘𝑙⋅f_{n}^{k,l}(\\cdot) can be seen as a symmetric variant of these two problems111Our problem can also be seen as a Gap-Threshold function. Threshold function is defined as fnk​(x)=1subscriptsuperscript𝑓𝑘𝑛𝑥1f^{k}_{n}(x)=1 iff |x|≥k𝑥𝑘|x|\\geq k.. We study the tradeoff between the number of queries and the optimal success probabilities in quantum and randomized settings for both functions with errors close to 1/2. We further consider the relation between various complexity measures of partial symmetric Boolean functions. For total Boolean functions, it has been proved that several fundamental complexity measures are polynomial equivalent (See Table 1 in [ref]4). Moreover, the tight bounds on several fundamental complexity measures of total symmetric Boolean functions have also been obtained . However, the result for partial symmetric Boolean functions has not been fully characterized. Our contribution is as follows. For convenience, if f𝑓f is a symmetric Boolean function, we denote f​(k)=f​(x)𝑓𝑘𝑓𝑥f(k)=f(x) for any |x|=k𝑥𝑘|x|=k. Additionally, we say an n𝑛n-bit Boolean function f:D→{0,1}:𝑓→𝐷01f:D\\rightarrow\\{0,1\\} is even if f​(|x|)=f​(n−|x|)𝑓𝑥𝑓𝑛𝑥f(|x|)=f(n-|x|) for any x∈D𝑥𝐷x\\in D, where D⊆{0,1}n𝐷superscript01𝑛D\\subseteq\\{0,1\\}^{n}. For both randomized setting and quantum setting, we characterize the optimal success probability of algorithms given the number of queries for the function fnksuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝑛𝑘f_{n}^{k} (Theorem 1.3) and fnk,lsuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝑛𝑘𝑙f_{n}^{k,l} (Theorems 1.4 and 1.5). As a corollary, we show for any T𝑇T-query quantum algorithm to compute fnksuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝑛𝑘f_{n}^{k} and fnk,lsuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝑛𝑘𝑙f_{n}^{k,l}, there exist classical randomized algorithms using 𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒​(T)𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝑇\\mathsf{poly}(T) queries to simulate the success probability of the quantum algorithm (Corollaries 1.6 and 1.7). Additionally, we characterize the exact quantum query complexity of fnksuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝑛𝑘f_{n}^{k} (Theorem 1.8). We establish a relation between the number of queries and the bias of quantum and randomized algorithms to compute total symmetric Boolean functions, where the bias of the algorithms can be arbitrarily small (Theorem 1.9). As a corollary, we prove a weak version of Conjecture 1.2:\nthe acceptance probability of a quantum\nquery algorithm to compute a total symmetric Boolean function can be approximated by a randomized algorithm with only a polynomial increase in the number of queries, where the bias of quantum algorithms can be arbitrarily small (Corollary 1.10). We investigate the relation between different complexity measures of partial symmetric Boolean functions.\nSpecifically, Theorem 1.12 shows the relation between the quantum query complexity and the approximate degree of even partial symmetric Boolean functions for arbitrarily small bias222Theorem 1.12 is also a new result for total symmetric Boolean functions..\nTheorem 1.13 shows exact quantum query complexity and degree are quadratically related.\nTheorem 1.14 presents tight bounds of block sensitivity, fractional block sensitivity, quantum query complexity, and approximate degree, where quantum query complexity and approximate degree are in a bounded-error setting. Corollary 1.15 shows block sensitivity is an upper bound of quantum query complexity. Since it has been known that Q​(f)≥Ω​(𝖻𝗌⁡(f))𝑄𝑓Ω𝖻𝗌𝑓Q(f)\\geq\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\operatorname{\\mathsf{bs}}(f)}) for any (possibly partial) Boolean function f𝑓f , quantum query complexity and block sensitivity of partial symmetric Boolean functions are polynomially related.\nOn the converse, Theorem 1.16 shows\nan exponential gap between the exact quantum query complexity and randomized query complexity for some partial symmetric Boolean functions, which is different from total symmetric functions. The acceptance probability of a T𝑇T-query quantum algorithm to compute a Boolean function can be approximated by a deterministic algorithm using poly​(T,1/ϵ,1/δ)poly𝑇1italic-ϵ1𝛿\\mathrm{poly}(T,1/\\epsilon,1/\\delta) queries within an additive error ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon on a 1−δ1𝛿1-\\delta fraction of inputs. For T>0𝑇0T>0, the quantum T𝑇T-bias and classical T𝑇T-bias of fnksuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝑛𝑘f_{n}^{k} are For fnk,lsuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝑛𝑘𝑙f_{n}^{k,l} and T>0𝑇0T>0, the quantum T𝑇T-bias is If T=O​((n−k)​l(l−k)2)𝑇𝑂𝑛𝑘𝑙superscript𝑙𝑘2T=O\\left(\\frac{(n-k)l}{(l-k)^{2}}\\right), the classical T𝑇T-bias of fnk,lsuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝑛𝑘𝑙f_{n}^{k,l} satisfies that If T=Ω​((n−k)​l(l−k)2)𝑇Ω𝑛𝑘𝑙superscript𝑙𝑘2T=\\Omega\\left(\\frac{(n-k)l}{(l-k)^{2}}\\right), then δC​(fnk,l,T)=Θ​(1)subscript𝛿𝐶superscriptsubscript𝑓𝑛𝑘𝑙𝑇Θ1\\delta_{C}\\left(f_{n}^{k,l},T\\right)=\\Theta(1). For arbitrarily small bias β>0𝛽0\\beta>0, if there exists a quantum algorithm using T𝑇T queries to compute fnksuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝑛𝑘f_{n}^{k} with success probability 1/2+β12𝛽1/2+\\beta, then there also exists a classical randomized algorithm using O​(T2)𝑂superscript𝑇2O(T^{2}) queries to compute fnksuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝑛𝑘f_{n}^{k}\nwith the same success probability. For arbitrarily small bias β>0𝛽0\\beta>0, if there exists a quantum algorithm using T𝑇T queries to compute fnk,lsuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝑛𝑘𝑙f_{n}^{k,l} with success probability 1/2+β12𝛽1/2+\\beta, then there also exist classical randomized algorithms using T2superscript𝑇2T^{2} queries to compute fnk,lsuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝑛𝑘𝑙f_{n}^{k,l} with success probability 1/2+Ω​(β2)12Ωsuperscript𝛽21/2+\\Omega\\left(\\beta^{2}\\right) and using T4superscript𝑇4T^{4} queries to compute fnk,lsuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝑛𝑘𝑙f_{n}^{k,l} with success probability 1/2+Ω​(β)12Ω𝛽1/2+\\Omega\\left(\\beta\\right). Thus The exact quantum query complexity of fnksuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝑛𝑘f_{n}^{k} satisfies ⌈π2​θ⌉≤QE​(fnk)≤⌈π2​θ⌉+2𝜋2𝜃subscript𝑄𝐸superscriptsubscript𝑓𝑛𝑘𝜋2𝜃2\\lceil\\frac{\\pi}{2\\theta}\\rceil\\leq Q_{E}(f_{n}^{k})\\leq\\lceil\\frac{\\pi}{2\\theta}\\rceil+2, where θ=2​arcsin⁡k/n𝜃2𝑘𝑛\\theta=2\\arcsin{\\sqrt{k/n}}, whereas the zero-error randomized query complexity of fnksuperscriptsubscript𝑓𝑛𝑘f_{n}^{k} is n−k+1𝑛𝑘1n-k+1. For any total symmetric Boolean function f𝑓f and arbitrarily small bias β>0𝛽0\\beta>0, if there exists a quantum algorithm using T𝑇T queries to compute f𝑓f with success probability 1/2+β12𝛽1/2+\\beta, then for any δ∈(0,1)𝛿01\\delta\\in(0,1), there exists a randomized algorithm using O​(T2)𝑂superscript𝑇2O(T^{2}) queries to compute f𝑓f with success probability 1/2+Ω​(δ​β2)12Ω𝛿superscript𝛽21/2+\\Omega\\left(\\delta\\beta^{2}\\right) on a 1−δ1𝛿1-\\delta fraction of inputs. For any total symmetric Boolean function f𝑓f and arbitrarily small bias β>0𝛽0\\beta>0, if there exists a T𝑇T-query quantum algorithm to compute f𝑓f with success probability 1/2+β12𝛽1/2+\\beta, then for any ϵ∈(0,β),δ∈(0,1)formulae-sequenceitalic-ϵ0𝛽𝛿01\\epsilon\\in(0,\\beta),\\delta\\in(0,1), there exists a randomized algorithm using\nO​(T2/(ϵ2​δ2))𝑂superscript𝑇2superscriptitalic-ϵ2superscript𝛿2O(T^{2}/(\\epsilon^{2}\\delta^{2}))\nqueries to compute f𝑓f with success probability 1/2+(β−ϵ)12𝛽italic-ϵ1/2+(\\beta-\\epsilon) on a 1−δ1𝛿1-\\delta fraction of inputs. Corollary 1.10 is a randomized version of Conjecture 1.2. Additionally, Corollary 1.10 considers total symmetric Boolean functions, while Conjecture 1.2 refers to any Boolean function.
