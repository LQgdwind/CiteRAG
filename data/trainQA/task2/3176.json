The widely used software Ansys Fluent  uses a coupled method to solve the pressure-velocity coupling. The fully implicit coupling is achieved through an implicit discretization of pressure gradient terms in the momentum equations and an implicit discretization of the face mass flux, including the Rhie-Chow pressure dissipation terms. Unlike the SIMPLE   and SIMPLEC  algorithms, it solves the momentum and pressure-based continuity equations together. Since directly solving the nonlinear time integration problem with incompressibility constraints is expensive, it is possible to use the Chorin’s projection  3 to split the solve at each time step into predictor-corrector sub-steps where pressure terms only participate in the corrector step that handles incompressibility. The predictor step is often further split into advection and diffusion for viscous fluids . Diffusion step typically involves a global linear solve  or sometimes is computed using particles  . The advection step suffers from significant numerical dissipation in the classic semi-Lagrangian method  3; ways to reduce this dissipation were extensively studied. For purely grid based methods, while MacCormack [ref]39 2 and BFECC  advect the solution forward and then backward in time to estimate and compensate error, Bimocq  resolve the flow map characteristics for periods longer than a single time step (as opposed to one step with semi-Lagrangian) to reduce dissipation.\nHybrid Lagrange/Eulerian techniques like Particle-In-Cell (PIC) , Fluid-Implicit-Particle (FLIP) , AffinePIC  , and PolyPIC  explicitly track motion of particles in the fluid and transfer information between grid and particles, which is nearly dissipation-free, but can suffer from nonuniform particle distribution and also higher computational costs.\nDing et al.  presents a quantitative study of accuracy of several different particle-based advection methods.\nChorin projection itself causes dissipation: Zhang et al.  reduced numerical dissipation\ncaused by the corrector step by estimating lost vorticity and adding it back into the fluid. Zehnder et al.  propose a simple but effective modification to the splitting scheme that is similar to midpoint rule integration to reduce the corrector error. In this study, we evaluate the two advection methods, semi-Lagrangian (SL)  and the Fluid-Implicit-Particle (FLIP) , which are typical for the Eulerian and Lagrangian views respectively. The original SL method is unconditionally stable, and the method is widely used in numerical weather prediction . For a more thorough comparison among different advection methods, we refer to  and . The computational advantages of commonly used linear operator splitting have the downside of limiting their rate of convergence to linear. To overcome this limitation, while retaining some of their benefits, high-order splitting schemes can be used instead 8    . In this study, we use the method proposed in  as a recent representative of this class. We briefly review this method for completeness.  solves the incompressible NS equations using a split-step approach that decouples the solution of the velocity from the solution of the pressure. The split-step method   is an explicit predictor-corrector method that consists of a second-order Adam-Bashforth (AB2) predictor and a modified second-order Adam-Moulton (AM2) predictor.\nWe implemented this method with the TN boundary condition and divergence damping in .\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: suffers from significant numerical dissipation in the classic semi-Lagrangian method  3; ways to reduce this dissipation were extensively studied.
