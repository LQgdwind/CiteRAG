      "content": "Paper Title: A Computational Framework of Cortical Microcircuits Approximates Sign-concordant Random Backpropagation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo achieve bio-plausible error processing, we identified several computational issues (IS) to solve (corresponding to the 6 bio-implausibilities of BP described in Section 1):\nIS.1: Apply unified neural dynamics rules to forward and backward input currents.\nIS.2: Store forward activation and backward error signals separately. Process error through interactions between different compartments.\nIS.3: During continuous training, all types of synaptic plasticity are always enabled, with no separate forward-backward phases.\nIS.4: Follow Dale’s principle. A neuron is only allowed to send excitatory or inhibitory synapses.\nIS.5: Realize forward and backward propagation with special cooperation between different types of neurons.\nIS.6: Provide insights of the temporal credit assignment problem to neurons that can fire spikes with accurate timing. Achieve continuous valued error propagation through discontinuous all-or-none spikes. Motivated by the recent developments in neuronscience (NE), we synthesize biological experimental evidence under a systematic computational framework to realize random error backpropagation. In this section, we introduce our microcircuit architecture and discuss its bio-plausibility. Guided by Dale’s principle (IS.4) and based on observation NE.1: Neocortical visual processing neurons include excitatory pyramidal (Pyr) neurons and various types of inhibitory interneurons. The two most abundant types are parvalbumin-expressing (PV) neurons and somatostatin-expressing (SOM) neurons , we build our microcircuits with three types of neurons: Pyr, PV, and SOM neurons (IS.5). Undoubtedly, biology neurons’ anatomies are complex. We follow the simplified multi-compartments Pyr model    , and model PV cells in the same way. NE.2: Wouterlood et al. states that PV neurons may have two types: the one with long dendrites and the one with short dendrites. Zipp et al. and Chiovini et al. provide observation of PV neurons with long apical dendrites. Our PV model follows this type. Yet NE.3: SOM cells usually have spatially constrained dendrites [ref]42, so we model SOM cells by a single compartment. Regarding computational requirements, we divide the architecture into three main parts, as shown in Figure 1: the forward path, the excitatory backward path, and the inhibitory backward path. The forward path shows the connections that propagate the activation of excitatory and inhibitory neurons to the next layer, and the two backward paths show the connections that propagate the errors of excitatory and inhibitory neurons backward, respectively. Since microcircuit design is largely dependent on intraneural dynamics, we begin our discussion with modeling of the apical dendrites of spiking neurons. Then, we exhibit the forward, excitatory backward, and inhibitory backward paths one by one.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: Zipp et al. and Chiovini et al. provide observation of PV neurons with long apical dendrites.
