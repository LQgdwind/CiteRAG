We use cyclic cosine annealing learning rate schedule¬† that enables partial warm restart optimization, generally improving the convergence rate in gradient-based optimization. Note that we use a grid search to find a better hyperparameter set: we set ŒªvggsubscriptùúÜvgg\\lambda_{\\text{vgg}} and ŒªfreqsubscriptùúÜfreq\\lambda_{\\text{freq}} to 0.10.10.1.\nMoreover, we set the number of FSF blocks at the encoding and decoding stage to [ref]2 [ref]2  for each scale. The entire architecture also contains 12 FSF blocks between the encoder and decoder. We use the following three evaluation metrics: (1) Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), (2) Structural Similarity index (SSIM)¬†4, and (3) Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS)¬†5. These metrics are widely used in the image demoir√©ing task (as well as other image restoration tasks) by quantifying the quality of generated outputs. PSNR quantifies pixel-level similarity, while SSIM¬†4 uses structural information (from pixel intensities, luminance, and contrasts), providing a more human-like perception metric. Lastly, LPIPS¬†5 measures perceptual similarity by comparing high-level visual representations from pre-trained networks (e.g., ImageNet¬†6 pre-trained).\nTo measure the performance of our model for the video demoir√© task, we conduct single-frame and multi-frame experiments with the following settings. Specifically, at the multi-frame experiments, we randomly sample three consecutive frames with batch size 888 and crop a 384√ó\\times384 patch for all experiments over VDmoire dataset¬†. In the single-frame experiments, we randomly sample a single frame and leverage it repetitively instead of consecutive frames.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: set: we set ŒªvggsubscriptùúÜvgg\\lambda_{\\text{vgg}} and ŒªfreqsubscriptùúÜfreq\\lambda_{\\text{freq}} to 0.10.10.1.\nMoreover, we set the number of FSF blocks at the encoding and decoding stage to [ref]2 [ref]2  for each scale.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
