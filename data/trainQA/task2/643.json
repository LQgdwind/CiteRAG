      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Text Generation by Learning from Search\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nText generation refers to a wide range of tasks involving generating natural language, including but not limited to machine translation [ref]20  , sentence simplification  , and text summarization  . Recent success of neural-based text generation relies heavily on a large parallel dataset for training, which\nmay not be available in real-world natural language processing (NLP) applications.\nIn this work, we consider unsupervised text generation, where no parallel data is available. This setting is more challenging, and has significant potential in both scientific research (e.g., low-resource language processing) and industrial applications (e.g., cold start for a new NLP application). Early work tackles unsupervised text generation by rules or templates 5 . While such approaches do not require parallel corpora, the generated sentences are highly subject to the rules, and hence lack the flexibility of natural language. Other work constructs pseudo-parallel data, which is only feasible for certain tasks like unsupervised machine translation [ref]20. Recently, researchers have developed search-based techniques for unsupervised text generation [ref]29 8  , where a heuristically defined scoring function evaluates the quality of a sentence, involving language fluency, semantic compliance, and other task-specific aspects. Then, the algorithm performs word-level edits (such as word deletion, insertion, and replacement) to search towards a (possibly local) optimum of the scoring function. With a reasonably designed scoring function, such approaches are shown to be effective in a variety of applications like paraphrase generation [ref]29 , sentence summarization , and text simplification 8. However, the search-based approach has two major drawbacks: 1) The inference efficiency is low. To obtain an output sentence, the search algorithm would perform a few hundred steps of local edits and re-evaluations. This could be considerably slower than an autoregressive decoder, which generates words sequentially. 2) The search could yield noisy results, since the scoring function is defined heuristically and the search is conducted locally in a discrete sentence space. To this end, we propose a new framework for unsupervised text generation by learning from search (tgls), which contains a strong search module that explores the sentence space, as well as a learning module that learns from the search results.\nFor the search module, we adopt the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. At each step, SA proposes a local edit by a neural network, and then either accepts or rejects the proposal based on a heuristically defined scoring function.\nFor learning, we employ two methods to train the conditional generative model, word-level cross-entropy loss and the sequence-level max-margin loss. Within tgls, the search and learning can be boosted by each other in an iterative fashion. That is, the search results serve as the pseudo-reference for training the conditional generator, which in turn benefits SA search by serving as a more meaningful initial state.\nAs for implementation, tgls involves two pretrained language models: a) the uni-directional GPT2 , which is suitable for likelihood-based fluency evaluation and conditional generation; and b) the bi-directional RoBERTa , which is better at semantic evaluation and contextual word-level prediction. The main contributions of our paper include: 1) We propose tgls, a generic learning-from-search framework for unsupervised text generation. 2) We demonstrate efficient methods of incorporating the large-scale pretrained language models into our tgls framework. 3) We conducted experiments on two different tasks: paraphrasing and text formalization. In both experiments, tgls significantly outperforms unsupervised baseline methods. Moreover, tgls achieves comparable performance to recent supervised models  in the paraphrasing task. 4) For text formalization (an example of text style transfer), we are also the first to design a search-based\nmethod, and further extend it into the proposed tgls framework.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: Text generation refers to a wide range of tasks involving generating natural language, including but not limited to machine translation [ref]20  , sentence simplification  , and text summarization  .
