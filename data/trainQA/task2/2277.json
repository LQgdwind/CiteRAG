      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-Source Domain Adaptation for Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMulti-source domain adaptation (MSDA) [ref]41 [ref]52    assumes that the training instances are from multiple domains.\nRecently, several studies follow the routine of single-source DA to utilize a shared network to forcedly align the multiple source distributions.\nFor instance, multi-source domain adversarial network (MDAN)  trains a discriminator to distinguish the source and target data, while the feature extractor aims to obtain domain-invariant features by adversarial learning.\nTo better diminish the discrepancy between domains, Peng et al.  propose to transfer the knowledge from multiple sources to the target by aligning moments of their feature distributions.\nHowever, these methods may result in performance decay due to the loss of the discriminative power of each domain. Besides, there is another routine based on the theoretical analysis   6 for MSDA, which demonstrates that the target distribution can be approximated by a mixture of the multiple source distributions.\nTo calculate more accurate combination weights for source domains, Hoffman et al.  develop a novel bound using DC-programming.\nTherefore, weighted combination of multiple source domains has been widely used for MSDA .\nXu et al. [ref]48 develop a deep cocktail network (DCTN) to train a classifier for each source domain and combine the predictions of different classifiers weighted by perplexity scores.\nIn , Zhao et al. first fix the specialized feature extractor of\neach source and adversarially map the target data into the feature space of each source.\nThen, the prediction is generated by aggregating different source predictions weighted by the discrepancy between each source and the target.\nDifferent from them, we introduce a pseudo subnet for the target domain, which is updated by directly weighting parameters of each source subnet.\nAlso, existing MSDA algorithms  3 [ref]48 forcibly align different domains without considering the loss of the feature discriminativity.\nIn this paper, we can not only learn more domain invariance but also preserve discriminative property of features.\nBesides, we are the first to focus on MSDA for object detection.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: Multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) [ref]41 [ref]52    assumes that the training instances are from multiple domains.\nRecently, several studies follow the routine of single-source DA to utilize a shared network to forcedly align the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
