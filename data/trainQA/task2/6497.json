      "content": "Paper Title: S.T.A.R.-Track: Latent Motion Models for End-to-End 3D Object Tracking with Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Appearance Representations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nQuery-based Detection:\nMOT approaches that follow the tracking-by-detection   [ref]3 paradigm require a detector to detect a set of objects in each frame.\nThe pioneering work DETR 7 proposed a way to leverage the transformer architecture for object detection. In contrast to previous approaches, this set-based architecture comes with various desirable properties such as a sparse prediction scheme, a dynamic amount of object hypotheses, and no need for hand-crafted components such as  non-maximum suppression (NMS).\nAdditionally, the concept was generalized to the 3D case as well as to different sensor modalities including LiDAR 8 9, multi-view camera   and multi-modal detection methods  8. It is noteworthy that such query-based detectors became the de-facto standard in object detection and reach SOTA performance on various benchmarks such as COCO 0 or nuScenes 6. Tracking-by-Detection: \nMethods that rely on the well-established tracking-by-detection paradigm have the benefit of being compatible with any detection framework since the detection per frame and the tracking/association part are not directly linked.\nA simple greedy association 1 is still widely adopted in SOTA methods on the nuScenes tracking benchmark   8.\nIn this generic approach, the detector can not make use of previous tracks and the association often relies on geometric cues only. This causes track identity switches in which a track is reinitialized with a detection instead of the detection being associated with the previous track.\nVarious extensions such as re-ID features 2, 3 and motion models [ref]3 4 have been proposed to mitigate this effect.\nMotion models integrate prior knowledge about the physical properties and trajectory of the tracked object while re-ID features allow an association that is not solely based on bounding box geometry but also influenced by other features such as motion cues or objects appearance. Tracking-by-Attention: \nTo overcome the independent nature of the detection and tracking modules in a fully differentiable fashion and to implicitly solve the association between frames, the tracking-by-attention paradigm can be used 0 5.\nLeveraging the potential of attention, tracking and detection are performed jointly by auto-regressive query-based tracking since each detection of the last frame is used as a prior (track-query) for the next frame.\nMUTR3D2 extends the object detection method DETR3D  for tracking by adding a geometric compensation of object and ego motion.\nThis is done by utilizing a 3D reference point per object that is transformed between consecutive frames while the latent query features remain unchanged.\nA possibility to account for an appearance change caused by the ego-motion is presented in 5.\nThe proposed ego-motion-compensation module models the effect directly in the latent space as a linear function that depends on the estimated transformation between the two time steps.\nSimilar to the 3D case in which the transformation can be represented as a homogeneous matrix this transformation in latent space is modeled as a full-rank matrix which is learned from the given ego motion via a hyper-network 6. Inspired by the aforementioned previous works, we propose a latent motion model to account for the effects of ego and object motion on the latent appearance representation jointly.\nThis allows for keeping the explicit geometric update proposed in 2 while altering the learned appearance of an object as a function of the geometric transformation to simplify its detection and re-identification in the next frame.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Query-based Detection:\nMOT approaches that follow the tracking-by-detection   [ref]3 paradigm require a detector to detect a set of objects in each frame.\nThe pioneering work DETR 7 proposed a way to leverage the transformer architecture for object detection.
