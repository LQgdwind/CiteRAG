      "content": "Paper Title: Noisy Tensor Completion via Low-Rank Tensor Ring\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBoth tensor ring with balanced unfolding (TRBU)  and the proposed estimator are able to give statistical or exact recovery performance for low-TR-rank tensor completion. Here, we analyze the superiority of the proposed estimator. TRBU requires structural assumption on core tensors, which extends matrix strong incoherence conditions by letting canonical mode-2 unfolding of core tensors not be aligned with the standard basis, that is, where μk>0,k∈[K]formulae-sequencesubscript𝜇𝑘0𝑘delimited-[]𝐾\\mu_{k}>0,k\\in[K]. Compared with TRBU, priors on our estimator are significantly mild. The only assumption on unknown tensor is its upper bound on ℓ∞subscriptℓ\\ell_{\\infty} norm, which can be easily verified in real-world data. However, it is still unclear how to estimate the existence of strong TR incoherence conditions on incomplete tensor data. Furthermore, even if the incomplete tensor is coherent, the proposed model can still be reliable since it haven’t involved with the structure assumption on the intrinsic low-TR-rank tensor. TRBU can only obtain exact recovery performance with high probability in noiseless tensor completion case. The proposed model achieves the statistical performance for noisy observations, which is more practical and feasible in real-world applications. We show the superiority of the proposed estimator compared with tensor completion (tensor recovery) methods based on CP rank, Tucker rank and TT rank, respectively. In [ref]51, Yuan and Zhang claimed that recovering incomplete third-order tensor of size d×d×d𝑑𝑑𝑑d\\times d\\times d with CP rank rcpsubscript𝑟cpr_{\\text{cp}} required sample size rcp1/2​(d​log⁡d)3/2superscriptsubscript𝑟cp12superscript𝑑𝑑32r_{\\text{cp}}^{1/2}(d\\log d)^{3/2}. However, the optimal low-CP-rank approximation is NP-complete and is typically intractable. Tomioka et al.  claimed that recovering K𝐾Kth-order tensor of size d×⋯×d𝑑⋯𝑑d\\times\\cdots\\times d with Tucker rank [rtc,⋯,rtc]subscript𝑟tc⋯subscript𝑟tc[r_{\\text{tc}},\\cdots,r_{\\text{tc}}] requires 𝒪​(rtc​dK−1)𝒪subscript𝑟tcsuperscript𝑑𝐾1\\mathcal{O}(r_{\\text{tc}}d^{K-1}) Gaussian measurements for tensor compressive sensing problem, and Mu et. al further reduced the complexity to 𝒪​(rtc⌊K2⌋​d⌈K2⌉)𝒪superscriptsubscript𝑟tc𝐾2superscript𝑑𝐾2\\mathcal{O}(r_{\\text{tc}}^{\\lfloor\\frac{K}{2}\\rfloor}d^{\\lceil\\frac{K}{2}\\rceil}). However, Tucker rank-based method suffers from the similar flaw as LRMC, that is, as rtcsubscript𝑟tcr_{\\text{tc}} approaches d𝑑d, nearly full observations are required to recover the incomplete tensor. Rauhut et al.  proposed to solve low-TT-rank tensor compressive sensing using iterative hard thresholding (IHT) algorithm, and provided a convergence result based on tensor restricted isometry property (TRIP). The authors claimed that recovering a K𝐾K-order tensor of size d×d×⋯×d𝑑𝑑⋯𝑑d\\times d\\times\\cdots\\times d with TT rank [rtt,⋯,rtt]subscript𝑟tt⋯subscript𝑟tt[r_{\\text{tt}},\\cdots,r_{\\text{tt}}] using sub-Gaussian linear maps satisfied TRIP with level δrsubscript𝛿𝑟\\delta_{r} required 𝒪​((δr−2​(K−1)​rtt3+K​d​rtt)​log⁡(K​rtt))𝒪superscriptsubscript𝛿𝑟2𝐾1superscriptsubscript𝑟tt3𝐾𝑑subscript𝑟tt𝐾subscript𝑟tt\\mathcal{O}((\\delta_{r}^{-2}(K-1)r_{\\text{tt}}^{3}+Kdr_{\\text{tt}})\\log(Kr_{\\text{tt}})) measurements. Unfortunately, the sampling condition for tensor completion does not hold for the TRIP. Additionally, the optimal low-rank projection for IHT algorithm is also intractable in practice. Now, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model over noisy tubal rank tensor completion models. Tensor tubal rank based models   , transform a tensor into Fourier domain in the specific third-order and then estimate its low-rank approximation on all frontal slice matrices.\nIn contrast, the proposed model can not only be easily extended to high-order tensor, but also be insensitive to the dimensional orientation. As mentioned in previous works   [ref]31, high-order tensors usually maintain low-rank structure in multiple orders. The proposed method can efficiently exploit the low-rank structure in high-order tensors, which is seen as one of the most effective advantages compared with matrix and tubal rank based methods. The experimental results in Section V also verified this statement.\n\nReference markers found: [51]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]51: in real-world applications.
