      "content": "Paper Title: TransformerG2G: Adaptive time-stepping for learning temporal graph embeddings using transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNumerous studies have been conducted on static graph embedding using matrix factorization , random walk-based approaches   , and deep neural networks   , but a major limitation of these methods is that they cannot effectively capture the important temporal information over time. Hence, dynamic graph embedding has emerged as a crucial research area for enhancing conventional graph embedding methods. It can be divided into two main categories: continuous time graph embedding and discrete time graph embedding [ref]14. Continuous time graph embedding aims to learn temporal graph embedding for a series of temporal interactions at higher time resolution  . Moreover, DyRep  attempted to model the continuous time graph as “temporal point processes” and incorporate the self-attention mechanism [ref]27 to learn temporal relationship embeddings, or using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model the dynamics . TGN [ref]29 is a more generic and computationally efficient method for temporal graph embedding, because it utilizes efficient parallel processing and a single graph attention layer to update node-wise features based on the current memory and temporal node features, which address the main problem of . However, in discrete-time graph embedding, most works attempted to learn node embedding over time as lower-dimensional point vectors, i.e., each node is represented as a vector. To capture the temporal dynamics over different time stamps, some works have been conducted based on autoencoder architecture along with transfer learning approach  or recurrent neural networks (RNNs)  to capture the dynamics over timestamps. Xu et al.  firstly presented the “stochastic graph embedding” approach (i.e., DynG2G) for temporal graphs where each graph node at a timestamp can be projected into a latent space as probabilistic density function represented by mean and variance vectors. Therefore, DynG2G provides important uncertainty quantification that facilitates effective identification of the optimal embedding size. Given the great success of graph neural networks (GNN) and graph convolutional networks (GCN) in effective graph representation learning, several recent studies introduced time-dependent graph neural network (GNN) models that combine GNNs or GCNs with RNNs or long short-term memory (LSTM) for temporal graph embedding  . Recently, there has been an increasing number of works aiming to learn low dimensional embeddings for time-evolving knowledge graphs, notably  . In , they propose ATiSE, a model that includes temporal information into entity/relation representations by using Additive Time Series decomposition and mapping them into a space of multi-dimensional Gaussian distributions. In , the authors propose TANGO, a continuum model for link prediction using neural ordinary differential equations and multi-relational graph convolutional networks that encode both temporal and structural information.\nNevertheless, some of the aforementioned methods may fail to accurately capture long-term historical features, especially when the temporal behaviors of nodes or edges exhibit heterogeneous dynamics over timestamps. In the past few years, the self-attention mechanism, originally developed for transformers [ref]27, has demonstrated distinct advantages in effectively and efficiently capturing long-range dependencies with adaptive and interpretable attention weights. The mechanism has been successfully applied in diverse domains (e.g., natural language processing, computer vision, and sequence modeling). To incorporate the self-attention mechanism for dynamic graph embedding, studies in  and [ref]29 adopted the self-attention mechanism to jointly encode the spatial and temporal dynamics for discrete time graphs. However, the computational efficiency of the aforementioned methods decreases quadratically when applied to large-scale graphs. More comprehensive dynamic graph embedding works may be also found in some recent surveys   [ref]14  . In this paper, our main focus lies in spatio-temporal stochastic discrete-time graph embedding (improved version of our prior DynG2G ) that emphasizes long-range dependencies with advanced transformers. Moreover, our proposed TransformerG2G model aims to encode each graph node into a latent space as a “probability density function”. Our approach differs significantly from the aforementioned methods, which typically encode each graph (node or edge) as a “deterministic” lower-dimensional point-vector. However, our TransformerG2G model takes into account the crucial “node uncertainty information” in the latent space, which allows for the effective characterization of a wide range of node properties within the latent space, including node neighborhood diversity and optimal embedding dimensionality.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: emerged as a crucial research area for enhancing conventional graph embedding methods.
