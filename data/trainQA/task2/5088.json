Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: I saw, I conceived, I concluded: Progressive Concepts as Bottlenecks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVisual attention, also known as visuospatial selection attention, allows humans to selectively mask out redundant information in a cognition task [ref]27. Explaining with visual concepts means understanding an image by ”seeing” regions of interest. Therefore, it is natural to interpret the neural network behavior with visual concepts. Class activation mapping  and its successors [ref]42 [ref]46   localize the features of the DNNs that are responsible for the classification decision on the image by fusing channel contributions. Zeiler et al.  visualized the intermediate layers in a DNN with de-convolutional neural networks. Feature visualization  makes the learned features in DNN explicit via optimization. Network dissection   aligns neuron activation with expert-given visual concepts and produces activation masks for learned features. These post-hoc explanations, however, do not benefit the reasoning process of networks but only try to explain well-trained, maybe biased black-box models. Other methods inject visual concepts into the decision process of DNNs. Region-based recognition methods     locate visual concepts of the input images and obtain corresponding feature vectors, based on which the network makes decisions. Interpretable convolutional neural networks   design a loss to push the high-level DNN features toward reasonable visual concepts without extra annotation. ProtoPNet  not only focuses on the regions of interest but also pointing prototypical cases similar to those visual concepts. Explaining with visual concepts, i.e., the process ”I saw, I concluded” is intuitively meaningful in visual tasks. However, Pazzani et al.  argue that explanations should be what a domain expert would use, and visual explanations can not fulfill the explainability requirement in some cases. In addition, existing visual self-explanation models do not allow human-model communication, i.e., intervention.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: Visual attention, also known as visuospatial selection attention, allows humans to selectively mask out redundant information in a cognition task [ref]27.
