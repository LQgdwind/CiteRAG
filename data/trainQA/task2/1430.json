      "content": "Paper Title: Improving DGA-Based Malicious Domain Classifiers for Malware Defense with Adversarial Machine Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSecurity researchers have developed many different defense mechanisms in order to protect computer systems against malware and malicious botnet C&C communications. Blacklists of malicious websites are one of the most commonly used defense mechanisms where lists of domain names or IP addresses that are flagged as harmful are maintained. Any messages to/from these listed sites are feared to host potential C&C servers and hence blocked to prevent any further communications. As a counterattack, attackers developed DGAs as a measure to thwart blacklist detection . In recent years, hacker communities have been utilizing DGAs as the primary mechanism to produce millions of malicious domain names automatically through pseudo-random domain names in a very short time period [ref]2. Subsets of these malicious domain names are utilized to map to the C&C servers. These dynamically created domain names successfully evade static blacklist-checking mechanisms. Additionally, as one domain gets recognized and blocked, the C&C server can easily switch to another one. To overcome the limitations of static domain blacklists, machine learning (ML) techniques have been developed to detect malicious domain names and these techniques have yielded mostly promising results , [ref]4, . However, the ML models do not perform well with never-seen-before DGA families when an unrepresentative or imbalanced training dataset is used. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach to generate a rich set of training data representing malicious domain names using a data augmentation technique. Data augmentation of an existing training dataset is one way to make ML models learn better and, as a result, perform more robustly. Nevertheless, classic data augmentation merely creates a restricted reasonable alternative. In our approach, as illustrated in Figure 1, an adversarial machine learning technique is used to generate a diverse set of augmented data by means of data perturbation. The generated adversarial domain names are extremely difficult to differentiate from benign domain names. As a result, the machine learning classifier misclassifies malicious domains as benign ones. Afterwards, these adversarial examples are correctly re-labeled as malicious and reintroduced into the existing training dataset (see Figure 1). In this way, we augment the blacklist with diverse data to effectively train the machine learning models and increase the robustness of the DGA classifiers. In addition, we devise a secure container to store and transfer the blacklists of malicious domain names in encrypted form as a Protected Spreadsheet Container with Data (PROSPECD), presented in . PROSPECD provides confidentiality and integrity of the blacklists so that they can be used as training data to build a secure model. In addition to data integrity, PROSPECD provides origin integrity. This container protects the adversarial samples, used to teach the model, from unknown adversarial perturbations. The protected blacklist can be marketed commercially  to internet service providers and companies who need to maintain their own internal blacklists.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: years, hacker communities have been utilizing DGAs as the primary mechanism to produce millions of malicious domain names automatically through pseudo-random domain names in a very short time period [ref]2.
