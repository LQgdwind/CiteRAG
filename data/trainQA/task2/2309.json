      "content": "Paper Title: A Survey on Deep Learning Event Extraction: Approaches and Applications\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExtracting event relations is an important yet challenging task for constructing event knowledge graph [ref]166, which aims to detect the relations between the identified events, and thus can also be seen as the downstream tasks of event extraction.\nGenerally, existing event relation extraction studies (ERE) mainly focus on three event relation types, including co-referential relation, causal relation and temporal relation.\nSince the three relation types are usually investigated separately and have no consistent task formulation so far, this section will briefly introduce the above three event relation extraction problems separately as different tasks.\nFor more detailed event relation extraction reviews, we recommend the readers to Liu et al. [ref]166. Event Coreference Resolution.\nEvent coreference resolution (ECR) aims to identify whether the candidate events refer to the same event in the real-world, where those events may appear across several sentences.\nExisting methods   usually formulate ECR as a classification or ranking problem, and mainly focus on the contextual features around the two events, such as syntactic features, event topic information and linguistic features .\nTo enrich the clues for resolution, existing works also exploit document-level or topical structures , event argument information   [ref]196   and other event-related task information   , such as event detection  and entity recognition . Event Causal Relation Extraction.\nEvent causal relation extraction (ECE) aims to identify the event causal relation  and distinguish the cause and effect between two events, which benefits to the real-world event evolution understanding and thereby promotes event detection and event prediction.\nAccording to the utilized evidence, the ECE methods can be manifested in two groups:\n1) the methods exploiting internal information, which assume that the textual contexts contain sufficient clues for causal relation extraction, where the contextual features including syntactic features, lexical features, explicit causal patterns   , statistic causal association  [ref]208 , and document-level structures .\n2) the methods exploiting external information, which enhances the textual representation with external knowledge, such as pre-trained language model , and causal-related commonsense or knowledge base    .\nThere are also studies   employing distant supervision from knowledge base to alleviate the data sparsity issue in ECE. Event Temporal Relation Extraction.\nEvent temporal relation extraction (ETE) aims to understand the temporal order among events in the texts.\nMost existing studies on ETE follow the TimeML format , which is widely used to markup events, time expressions and temporal relations.\nGenerally, existing ETE studies can be roughly divided into three groups:\n1) rules-based methods, which infers the temporal relation for events relying on temporal rules, such as syntactic analyzers , regular expression patterns over tokens , and other linguistic rules .\n2) machine learning-based methods, which leverages statistical temporal contextual features and achieve the task with statistical classifiers  .\n3) neural models, which captures temporal relations with neural networks, such as CNNs and LSTMs  .\nMore external features are also considered in neural models, including dependency paths , domain knowledge , contextualized language models  and so on.\n\nReference markers found: [166]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]166: Extracting event relations is an important yet challenging task for constructing event knowledge graph [ref]166, which aims to detect the relations between the identified events, and thus can also be seen as the downstream tasks of event extraction.\nGenerally, existing event relation extraction\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
