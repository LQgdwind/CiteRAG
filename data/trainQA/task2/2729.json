      "content": "Paper Title: A Hierarchical Network-Oriented Analysis of User Participation in Misinformation Spread on WhatsApp\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe analysis and modeling of information dissemination in online social networks have been the target of a large body of work, focused on the identification of influential users , modeling of information cascades  , as well as extraction of relevant network substructures such as the network backbone   and communities  . Most prior studies focused on traditional online social networks, tackling, for example, the dissemination of hashtags on Twitter   and the spread of rumors and memes on Facebook . However, the study of misinformation spread is still a challenge  [ref]5, especially when dealing with detection, characterization and mitigation techniques for multimedia online content. The identification of misinformation content is itself a rather complex part of this challenge as it involves efforts in content analysis and truthiness detection . In this context, recent studies focused on assessing information credibility, characterizing the speed and strategies for misinformation spread and the use of various features for automatic content classification  . Ultimately, most of the efforts are driven by the goal of mitigating, slowing down or softening misinformation effects\nin the real world [ref]5 2. In a complementary direction, others have investigated the design of online tools to understand the scale of misinformation spread over the years, the psychological aspects related to misinformation content sharing and how misinformation content is reused to resurface older content into news again 0 1. In light of the great popularity of existing online social networks, WhatsApp emerged as a messaging app with a rather different overall communication structure. It was originally designed with a primary focus on allowing users to exchange messages, either privately (one-to-one) or in small groups (up to 256 simultaneous members), always with end-to-end encryption. Soon after its emergence, WhatsApp rapidly attracted a large number of users in many countries. Such widespread usage was, unfortunately, followed by several reports on the platform being abused for misinformation campaigns with great impact on society in Brazil , India  and United Kingdom , to name a few examples.\nThese reports, which gained great notoriety, ended up driving the attention of the academy to the importance of WhatsApp as a platform for (mis-)information spread at large   . A number of studies emerged, relying on the existence of a large number of publicly accessible WhatsApp groups. That is, though originally a private space, a group can be made publicly accessible as the group manager shares an invitation link on the Web, effectively opening such space to the public in general. By gathering a large number of such publicly available invitation links, researchers were able to join the groups automatically and, once a member, gather data for posterior analysis. Some researchers developed automatic tools to expose, in an anonymized fashion, the content being shared in WhatsApp groups  , whereas others analyzed properties of such content   . The work in  was the first to analyze WhatsApp messages in order to uncover sharing patterns in political-oriented groups, whereas Bursztyn et al.  extended the discussion by exploring group political partisanship in large scale. Moreover, Moreno et al.  studied the integration of WhatsApp into an aggregating and monitoring platform to report incidents during elections and natural events. In a different direction, the authors of  characterized distinct discursive strategies applied in WhatsApp messages during the Brazilian 2018 presidential election, while Vasconcelos et al.  investigated properties of pandemic-related YouTube videos shared by WhatsApp messages. It is notable the focus on pieces of information previously checked as fake by fact checking agencies  [ref]7 2 6  . For example, Resende et al. offered the first look into the properties of the content being shared on publicly accessible WhatsApp groups, with focus on content properties and propagation dynamics of images . They revealed the existence of a number of images containing information priorly checked as fake, with properties quite distinct from the others. In particular, these fake images spread much faster, reaching a much larger user population, compared to other content. More recent studies followed a similar path but focused on textual [ref]7 and audio 6 content, highlighting differences in content properties and propagation dynamics between (priorly checked) fake content and the rest. Caetano et al. , in turn, proposed an attention cascade model to represent how attention propagates among members of a group. They analyzed the structural and temporal properties of cascades associated with groups that discuss political topics and with misinformation spread. They found that cascades with misinformation tend to be deeper, reach more users, and last longer in political groups than in non-political groups. Following a complementary direction, Reis et al. observed that a large fraction of the dissemination of misinformation occurred after the content was already debunked. Building on such observation, they suggested that flagging fake content could reduce the overall volume of misinformation in the platform . Focused mostly on the overall effects of misinformation spread, these prior studies paid little attention to the underlying networks that connect users across different WhatsApp groups. Indeed, we are aware of only three prior efforts to shed some light into the importance of these networks to information spread  2 3.\nIn , the authors analyzed the structural properties of the network built from connecting users belonging to the same group, finding that this network has several properties, often observed in other online social networks, that have been shown to favor content virality.\nOrthogonally, Melo et al. constructed the network of groups, connecting groups that have members in common, to analyze whether limiting message forwarding could mitigate misinformation spread on WhatsApp 2. They found that, though effective in slowing down the process, such approach would not stop misinformation from being widely distributed.\nMore recently, we focused on the media co-sharing network, built by connecting users who shared the same content, revealing the presence of strongly connected user communities that consistently help speeding up information spread. We found that users with higher centrality in these communities are often those who contribute the most for the community’s coverage in terms of content diversity, users and groups 3. Despite shedding light into the importance of investigating the underlying networks connecting WhatsApp users and groups, these prior studies either focused on information dissemination in general, without analyzing the role of this network in the spread of misinformation  3, or studied a different, higher-level network, without focusing on the importance of its components for misinformation spread 2. In contrast, we here focus on the media co-sharing network, as it captures potential channels for information propagation, and analyze the misinformation spread from multiple perspectives, both in terms of network component and user aggregation level. Telegram is yet another messaging app offering individual and group communication (as well as channel broadcast) features to its users that has gained great popularity in a number of countries222https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55634139, also driving the attention of academic studies.\nNotably, in  the authors offered a comparison of the features available on Telegram with respect to those of WhatsApp and Twitter, and investigated the characteristics of viral messages on the platform. In , the authors analyzed the behavior of Iranian users on Telegram by characterizing and categorizing Telegram groups in terms of their quality, whereas group quality was estimated by a number of different features. The authors of both 0 and 1 offered network-driven analyses of Telegram by building a mention network, by connecting users who mentioned each other in their messages333On Telegram, users and channels have\nunique usernames which can be used as reference to be mentioned in a message.. In 0, the researchers aimed at investigating far-right networks, their actors and the properties of the communities they belong to. In contrast, in 1, the authors analyzed the edges of the mention network aiming at identifying spam messages. Our work is completely orthogonal to those prior studies on Telegram, not only because we focus on a different platform – WhatsApp – but also because we take a novel perspective, focusing on the role of the media co-sharing network has on user participation in misinformation dissemination. Compared to 0 1, which also looked at a user network, our present analysis focuses on a different network and considers different components of this network – backbone and periphery – as they capture potentially different patterns of user interactions. We summarize how our work distinguishes from the existing literature, notably prior studies on WhatsApp and Telegram, in Table 1. In this table, each row represents a prior study, and columns 3 to 10 list different aspects defining the scope of analysis. We start by noting that the literature is quite recent but already includes a reasonably large number of studies. Yet, we are the first ones to analyze misinformation dissemination by considering multimedia (text, image and audio) content444We note that, as will be described in Section 3.1, we did consider video content identifiers to build the media co-sharing networks used in our study to represent content sharing patterns. However, we did not analyze misinformation in video messages, focusing rather on misinformation in textual, image and audio content. Thus, we choose to leave videos out of the description of our work in Table 1 (4t​hsuperscript4𝑡ℎ4^{th} column). and network perspective, looking at the role of both network backbone and network periphery, considering temporal aspects, and analyzing user behavior at three different levels of aggregation. As such, we are able to uncover novel insights into user participation in misinformation spread on the platform.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: social networks, tackling, for example, the dissemination of hashtags on Twitter   and the spread of rumors and memes on Facebook .
