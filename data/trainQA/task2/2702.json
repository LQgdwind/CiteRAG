      "content": "Paper Title: Focus on Impact: Indoor Exploration with Intrinsic Motivation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGeometric Robot Exploration Methods.\nClassical heuristic and geometric-based exploration methods rely on two main strategies: frontier-based exploration  and next-best-view planning .\nThese methods have been largely used and improved  [ref]25  or combined in a hierarchical exploration algorithm  [ref]2. However, when applied with noisy odometry and localization sensors or in highly complex environments, geometric approaches tend to fail   [ref]18. In light of this, increasing research effort has been dedicated to the development of learning-based approaches, which usually exploit DLR to learn robust and efficient exploration policies. Intrinsic Exploration Rewards. The lack of ground-truth in the exploration task forces the adoption of reinforcement learning (RL) for training exploration methods.\nEven when applied to tasks different from robot exploration, RL methods have low sample efficiency. Thus, they require designing intrinsic reward functions that encourage visiting novel states or learning the environment dynamics. The use of intrinsic motivation is beneficial when external task-specific rewards are sparse or absent.\nAmong the intrinsic rewards that motivate the exploration of novel states, Bellemare et al.  introduced the notion of pseudo visitation count by using a Context-Tree Switching (CTS) density model to extract a pseudo-count from raw pixels and applied count-based algorithms. Similarly, Ostrovski et al.  applied the autoregressive deep generative model PixelCNN  to estimate the pseudo-count of the visited state.\nRecently, Zhang et al.  proposed a criterion to mitigate common issues in count-based methods.\nRewards that encourage the learning of the environment dynamics comprehend Curiosity , Random Network Distillation (RND) , and Disagreement .\nRecently, Raileanu et al.  proposed to jointly encourage both the visitation of novel states and the learning of the environment dynamics. However, their approach is developed for grid-like environments with a finite number of states, where the visitation count can be easily employed as a discount factor. In this work, we improve Impact, a paradigm that rewards the agent proportionally to the change in the state representation caused by its actions, and design a reward function that can deal with photorealistic scenes with non-countable states. Learning-based Robot Exploration Methods.\nIn the context of robot exploration and navigation tasks, the introduction of photorealistic simulators has represented a breeding ground for the development of self-supervised DRL-based visual exploration methods. Ramakrishnan et al. [ref]18 identified four paradigms for visual exploration: novelty-based, curiosity-based (as defined above), reconstruction-based, and coverage-based.\nEach paradigm is characterized by a different reward function used as a self-supervision signal for optimizing the exploration policy.\nA coverage-based reward, considering the area seen, is also used in the modular approach to Active SLAM presented in , which combines a neural mapper module with a hierarchical navigation policy. To enhance exploration efficiency in complex environments, Ramakrishnan et al.  resorted to an extrinsic reward by introducing the occupancy anticipation reward, which aims to maximize the agent accuracy in predicting occluded unseen areas. Deep Generative Models. Deep generative models are trained to approximate high-dimensional probability distributions by means of a large set of training samples. In recent years, literature on deep generative models followed three main approaches: latent variable models like VAE , implicit generative models like GANs , and exact likelihood models.\nExact likelihood models can be classified in non-autoregressive flow-based models, like RealNVP  and Flow++ , and autoregressive models, like PixelCNN  and Image Transformer . Non-autoregressive flow-based models consist of a sequence of invertible transformation functions to compose a complex distribution modeling the training data. Autoregressive models decompose the joint distribution of images as a product of conditional probabilities of the single pixels. Usually, each pixel is computed using as input only the previous predicted ones, following a raster scan order. In this work, we employ PixelCNN  to learn a probability distribution over possible states and estimate a pseudo visitation count.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: heuristic and geometric-based exploration methods rely on two main strategies: frontier-based exploration  and next-best-view planning .\nThese methods have been largely used and improved  [ref]25  or combined in a hierarchical exploration algorithm  [ref]2.
