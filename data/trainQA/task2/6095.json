      "content": "Paper Title: New Adversarial Image Detection Based on Sentiment Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo prevent adversarial example attacks, several detectors have been developed, including Dk𝑘kNN [ref]6, LID [ref]5, Mahalanobis’ algorithm , and NNIF [ref]7. Dk𝑘kNN [ref]6 combines the k𝑘k-NN algorithm with the input representation in a DNN’s hidden layers (i.e., feature map). Dk𝑘kNN identifies an adversarial example when the group of the representations of the example’s k𝑘k-nearest neighbors in the hidden layers differs from that of examples of the predicted class. LID [ref]5 is under the assumption that the dimensions of the subspaces surrounding adversarial (perturbed) examples and benign (unperturbed) examples differ. LID estimates the dimension and accordingly detects adversarial examples. Mahalanobis’ algorithm  assumes pre-trained input features can be fitted by a class-conditional Gaussian distribution. The Mahalanobis distance to the closest class-conditional distribution reveals adversarial examples. NNIF algorithm [ref]7 assumes that the k𝑘k-NN training samples (i.e., the nearest neighbors in the feature map space) and the most influential training samples (identified using an influence function) correlate for benign examples, but do not correlate for adversarial examples. The correlation is measured to detect if an attack is underway. BEYOND  assumes that benign perturbations, i.e. random noises, with bounded budgets cause minor variations on the feature space, and then detect anomalous behaviors by distinguishing an adversarial example’s relation with its augmented version, or neighbors, from representation similarity and label consistency. PNDetector  assumes the misclassification space is randomly distributed in the ideal feature space of a pre-trained classifier. PNDetector is a positive-negative classifier trained by original examples (positive representations) and their negative representations that share the same structural and semantic features.\n According to [ref]7, LID [ref]5, Mahalanobis , and NNIF [ref]7 yield their respective best detection performance when using all hidden layers of a DNN, while Dk𝑘kNN [ref]6 achieves its best detection by only using the penultimate layer of the DNN.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: To prevent adversarial example attacks, several detectors have been developed, including Dk𝑘kNN [ref]6, LID [ref]5, Mahalanobis’ algorithm , and NNIF [ref]7.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
