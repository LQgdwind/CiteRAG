      "content": "Paper Title: CAnet: Uplink-aided Downlink Channel Acquisition in FDD Massive MIMO using Deep Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMost existing works focus only on exploiting NNs to improve communication system performance but ignore the high complexity of NN-based communication algorithms, which hinders the deployment of DL-based algorithms in communications [ref]25.\nFor example, when the antenna number at the BS, pilot length, and feedback bit number are 64, 16, and 32, respectively, in accordance with Table III, the parameter number and the FLOPs of CAnet-J are 364,936 and 721,016, respectively, which require large model storage space and computational power.\nNN compression, including NN quantization, weight pruning, and knowledge distillation, has been regarded as a potential technology to tackle the complexity challenge.\nNN weight pruning and quantization techniques are widely used in FC layers, which are the main NN layers adopted in this work.\nAccording to [ref]25 , no performance drop will occur if the quantization bit number of the NN weight is more than 4 or 5.\nTherefore, we only apply the NN pruning technique to the proposed CAnet in this paper. NN weight-pruning methods consist of two main types.\nThe first one prunes the NNs during the training, whereas the other one prunes and fine-tunes the NNs after pretraining.\nIn this work, we apply magnitude-based NN weight pruning to the NNs after pretraining by using the TensorFlow Model Optimization Toolkit [ref]44.\nIn DL, sparse NN models are easy to compress, and zeros can be skipped during the inference, thereby improving latency for the equipment with restrictions on memory, processing, power consumption, model storage space, and network usage [ref]25.\nCompared with a method that prunes weights with small absolute values at once, such as in [ref]25, NN weights in this work are gradually zeroed out to achieve NN sparsity during the training phase. Specifically, a binary mask variable is added to each layer, which needs to be pruned.\nThese masks have the same shapes as the corresponding weight tensors and determine which NN weights can participate in the forward execution of the graph in the TensorFlow.\nIn each pruning step, we sort the weights by using their absolute values in the layer and mask to zero the smallest magnitude weights until the desired sparsity level sùë†s is reached.\nThe sparsity level denotes the percentage of the pruned NN weights from the total NN weights.\nDuring the backpropagation, the gradients flow through the binary masks and do not update the NN weights, which are masked in the forward execution.\nAs mentioned before, the pruning is realized gradually and the sparsity level after each pruning operation should be designed.\nIn this work, we adopt the automated gradual pruning mechanism proposed by .\nIn that mechanism, the sparsity level increases from an initial sparsity value sisubscriptùë†is_{\\rm i} (usually zero) to a final predefined sparsity value sfsubscriptùë†fs_{\\rm f} via nùëõn pruning steps.\nThe adaptive sparsity is defined as where t0subscriptùë°0t_{0} and Œî‚ÄãtŒîùë°\\Delta t denote the start straining step and pruning frequency, respectively.\nThe intuition behind the sparsity update function (21) is that the NNs are redundant at the beginning; hence, we prune the networks rapidly in the initial phase.\nAdditional details about this mechanism can be referred to  .\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: exploiting NNs to improve communication system performance but ignore the high complexity of NN-based communication algorithms, which hinders the deployment of DL-based algorithms in communications [ref]25.\nFor example, when the antenna number at the BS, pilot length, and feedback bit number are 64, 16, and 32, respectively, in accordance with Table III, the parameter number and the FLOPs of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
