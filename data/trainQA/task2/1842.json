      "content": "Paper Title: Modern Hopfield Networks for Few- and Zero-Shot Reaction Template Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMotivation of our approach.\nMany template-based methods     [ref]26 predict templates using where 𝒉m​(𝒎)superscript𝒉𝑚𝒎\\bm{h}^{m}(\\bm{m}) is a neural network that maps a molecule\nrepresentation\nto a vector of size dmsubscript𝑑𝑚d_{m}, which we call molecule encoder.\nMultiplication with 𝑾∈ℝK×dm𝑾superscriptℝ𝐾subscript𝑑𝑚\\bm{W}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{K\\times d_{m}} yields a score for each\ntemplate 𝒕1,…,𝒕Ksubscript𝒕1…subscript𝒕𝐾\\bm{t}_{1},\\ldots,\\bm{t}_{K}.\nThese scores are then normalized using the softmax function, which yields the vector 𝒚^∈ℝK^𝒚superscriptℝ𝐾\\hat{\\bm{y}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{K}.\nIn this setting, different templates are viewed as distinct categories or classes,\nwhich makes the\nmodel ignorant of similarities between classes which prevents generalization\nover templates.\nThe high fraction of samples in reaction\ndata sets that have a unique template can be problematic\nbecause they cannot contribute to\nperformance. This problem might also appear for\ntemplates occurring only a few times, but to a lesser\nextent. Instead of learning the rows of 𝑾𝑾\\bm{W} independently,\none could map each\ntemplate to a vector of size dtsubscript𝑑𝑡d_{t}\nusing a template encoder, 𝒉tsuperscript𝒉𝑡\\bm{h}^{t},\nand concatenate them row-wise to obtain\n𝑻h=𝒉t​(𝑻)∈ℝK×dtsubscript𝑻ℎsuperscript𝒉𝑡𝑻superscriptℝ𝐾subscript𝑑𝑡\\bm{T}_{h}=\\bm{h}^{t}(\\bm{T})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{K\\times d_{t}}.\nIf dm=dtsubscript𝑑𝑚subscript𝑑𝑡d_{m}=d_{t}, replacing 𝑾𝑾\\bm{W} in the equation above yields which associates the molecule 𝒎𝒎\\bm{m} with each template via the dot\nproduct of their representations.\nThis allows generalization across templates because\nthe structure of the template is used to represent\nthe class and the model can leverage similarities between templates.\nWe adapt\nmodern Hopfield networks [ref]31 [ref]35\nto generalize this association of the two modalities,\nmolecules and reaction templates. A component of the model proposed in \nis similar to our approach as it also makes use of the templates’ structures.\nOur approach also resembles the approach taken in CLIP \nand ConVIRT \nin which associated pairs of images and texts are\ncontrasted against non-associated pairs.\nOur adaption of MHNs to maintain a static memory\ncomplements previous\ncontrastive learning  \napproaches using a memory    . Modern Hopfield networks.\nRecently [ref]31 [ref]35 introduced\nmodern Hopfield Networks (MHN) which\nare well-suited for learning associations between sets\n.\nWe use an MHN approach to generalize Eq. (2)\nto a more expressive association mapping where g𝑔g consists of Hopfield layers based on MHNs.\nAn MHN is an associative memory that\nstores patterns 𝑿∈ℝd×K𝑿superscriptℝ𝑑𝐾\\bm{X}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times K}  111Note that K𝐾K in this work corresponds to N𝑁N in [ref]31.\nand iteratively updates a state pattern according to: where 𝒑𝒑\\bm{p} is called the vector of associations and\nβ>0𝛽0\\beta>0 is a scaling parameter (inverse temperature).\nThe update rule converges globally\nto stationary points of the energy function,\nE=−lse​(β,𝑿T​𝝃)+12​𝝃T​𝝃+CElse𝛽superscript𝑿𝑇𝝃12superscript𝝃𝑇𝝃𝐶\\mathrm{E}\\ =\\ -\\ \\mathrm{lse}(\\beta,\\bm{X}^{T}\\bm{\\xi})\\ +\\ \\frac{1}{2}\\bm{\\xi}^{T}\\bm{\\xi}+C, where\nlselse\\mathrm{lse} is the log-sum-exponential function,\nand C𝐶C is a constant [31, Theorem 1 and 2].\nTo adapt MHNs to reaction template prediction,\nthe Hopfield layer learns both a\nmolecule representation used for the state pattern 𝝃∈ℝd𝝃superscriptℝ𝑑\\bm{\\xi}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d} and\nreaction template representations used for the stored patterns 𝑿𝑿\\bm{X}. Model architecture with parallel or stacked Hopfield layers.\nOur model architecture consists of three main\nparts: a) a molecule encoder, b) a reaction template encoder, and\nc) one or more stacked or parallel Hopfield layers.\nFirstly, we use a molecule encoder function that\nlearns a relevant representation\nfor the task at hand. For this we use a\nfingerprint-based, e.g. ECFP ,\nfully-connected NN, 𝒉𝒘m​(𝒎)subscriptsuperscript𝒉𝑚𝒘𝒎\\bm{h}^{m}_{\\bm{w}}(\\bm{m}) with weights 𝒘𝒘\\bm{w}.\nThe molecule encoder maps a molecule to its\nrepresentation 𝒎h=𝒉𝒘m​(𝒎)subscript𝒎ℎsubscriptsuperscript𝒉𝑚𝒘𝒎\\bm{m}_{h}=\\bm{h}^{m}_{\\bm{w}}(\\bm{m}) of dimension dmsubscript𝑑𝑚d_{m}. Secondly, we use the reaction template encoder\n𝒉𝒗tsubscriptsuperscript𝒉𝑡𝒗\\bm{h}^{t}_{\\bm{v}} with parameters 𝒗𝒗\\bm{v} to learn relevant representations of templates.\nHere, we also use a fully-connected NN with template fingerprints as input. These fingerprints are described in Appendix Section A3.\nThis function is applied\nto all templates 𝑻𝑻\\bm{T} and the resulting vectors are\nconcatenated column-wise into a\nmatrix 𝑻h=𝒉𝒗t​(𝑻)subscript𝑻ℎsubscriptsuperscript𝒉𝑡𝒗𝑻\\bm{T}_{h}=\\bm{h}^{t}_{\\bm{v}}(\\bm{T}) with\nshape (dt,K)subscript𝑑𝑡𝐾(d_{t},K). Finally, we use a single or several stacked or parallel\nHopfield layers g(.,.)g(.,.)\nto associate a molecule with all templates in the memory.\nThe Hopfield layer consists of fully-connected layers\nwith adaptive weight matrices 𝑾m,𝑾tsubscript𝑾𝑚subscript𝑾𝑡\\bm{W}_{m},\\bm{W}_{t}\nto map both molecule\nrepresentations and template representations\nto a d𝑑d-dimensional space:\n𝝃=ϕ​(𝑾m​𝒉𝒘m​(𝒎))𝝃italic-ϕsubscript𝑾𝑚subscriptsuperscript𝒉𝑚𝒘𝒎\\bm{\\xi}=\\phi(\\bm{W}_{m}\\ \\bm{h}^{m}_{\\bm{w}}(\\bm{m})) and\n𝑿=ϕ​(𝑾t​𝒉𝒗t​(𝑻))𝑿italic-ϕsubscript𝑾𝑡subscriptsuperscript𝒉𝑡𝒗𝑻\\bm{X}=\\phi(\\bm{W}_{t}\\ \\bm{h}^{t}_{\\bm{v}}(\\bm{T})), where 𝑾msubscript𝑾𝑚\\bm{W}_{m}\nand 𝑾tsubscript𝑾𝑡\\bm{W}_{t} are adaptive weight matrices with d𝑑d rows,\nand ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi is an activation function.\nHopfield layers comprise layer normalization  for 𝝃𝝃\\bm{\\xi} and 𝑿𝑿\\bm{X}\nwhich is included as a hyperparameter.\nWe also consider the scaling parameter β𝛽\\beta as a hyperparameter.\nThe Hopfield layer then employs the update rule Eq. (4)\nthrough which the updated representation\nof the product molecule 𝝃newsuperscript𝝃new\\bm{\\xi}^{\\mathrm{new}} and\nthe vector of associations 𝒑𝒑\\bm{p} is obtained.\nIf multiple Hopfield layers are stacked, 𝝃newsuperscript𝝃new\\bm{\\xi}^{\\mathrm{new}} enters\nthe next Hopfield layer, for which additional template encoders supply the template\nrepresentations.\nParallel Hopfield layers use the same\ntemplate encoder, but learn different projections 𝑾t,𝑾msubscript𝑾𝑡subscript𝑾𝑚\\bm{W}_{t},\\bm{W}_{m},\nwhich is analogous to the heads in Transformer networks. The simple model (Eq. 2)\nis a special case of our MHN and recovered\nif\n(a) 𝑾tsubscript𝑾𝑡\\bm{W}_{t} and 𝑾msubscript𝑾𝑚\\bm{W}_{m} are the identity matrices\nand dt=dm=dsubscript𝑑𝑡subscript𝑑𝑚𝑑d_{t}=d_{m}=d,\n(b) the Hopfield network is constrained to a single update,\n(c) Hopfield networks are not stacked, i.e. there is only a\nsingle Hopfield layer\n(d) the scaling parameter β=1𝛽1\\beta=1,\n(e) layernorm learns zero mean and unit variance and does\nnot use its adaptive parameters, and\n(f) the activation function ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi is the identity.\nThe standard DNN model (Eq. 1) is\nrecovered if additionally the reaction templates are one-hot\nencoded, and the template encoder is linear. In this study, we tested fingerprint-based fully-connected networks for\nthe molecule and template encoder.\nIn principle, one could use any mapping from\nmolecules/templates to vector-valued representations for these components, for example raw fingerprints,\ngraph neural networks  or\nSMILES/SMARTS-based RNNs  or Transformers . Loss function and optimization.\n\nWe provide a general definition of the loss in terms\nof retrieved patterns and details in Appendix Section A6.\nHere we supply a simple view of the case in which\na single correct reaction template is assigned to each molecule.\nGiven a training pair (𝒎,𝒕)𝒎𝒕(\\bm{m},\\bm{t}) and the set of all\ntemplates 𝑻𝑻\\bm{T}, the model should assign high probability\nto 𝒕𝒕\\bm{t} based on 𝒎𝒎\\bm{m} and 𝑻𝑻\\bm{T}.\nWe encode this objective by the negative log-likelihood: −log⁡p​(𝒕∣𝒎,𝑻)𝑝conditional𝒕𝒎𝑻-\\log p(\\bm{t}\\mid\\bm{m},\\bm{T}).\nThe probability of each template in 𝑻𝑻\\bm{T} is encoded by\nthe corresponding element of the vector of associations 𝒑𝒑\\bm{p} of the last Hopfield layer.\nIn case of multiple parallel Hopfield layers, we use\naverage pooling across the vectors 𝒑𝒑\\bm{p} supplied from\neach layer. The parameters of the model are adjusted\non a training set using stochastic\ngradient descent on the loss w.r.t. 𝑾t,𝑾m,𝒘,𝒗subscript𝑾𝑡subscript𝑾𝑚𝒘𝒗\\bm{W}_{t},\\bm{W}_{m},\\bm{w},\\bm{v}\nvia the AdamW optimizer .\nWe train our model for a maximum of 100 epochs and then\nselect the best model with respect to the minimum cross-entropy loss\nin the case of template-relevance prediction\nor maximum top-111 accuracy for single-step retrosynthesis on the validation set.\nPseudo-code of the forward-pass\nof our model is presented in Alg. 1. Regularization. We use dropout regularization\nin the molecule encoder 𝒉msuperscript𝒉𝑚\\bm{h}^{m}, for the\ntemplate encoder 𝒉tsuperscript𝒉𝑡\\bm{h}^{t} as well as for the representations in the Hopfield layers.\nWe employ L2 regularization on the parameters.\nA detailed list of considered and selected\nhyperparameters is given in Appendix Tables A2 and A3. Fingerprint filter (FPF).\nWe added a computationally cheap fingerprint-based\nsubstructure screen\nas a post-processing step that can filter out a\npart of the non-applicable templates.\nFor each product and the product side of each template,\nwe calculated a bit-vector using the\n\"PatternFingerprint\" function from rdkit\n. Each bit set in this vector\nspecifies the presence of a substructure.\nFor a template to be applicable every\nbit set in the template fingerprint also has to be set\nin the product fingerprint, which is\na necessary condition for subgraphs to match.\nWe chose a fingerprint size of 4096 as we did not observe significant\nperformance gains for larger sizes, as can be seen in Appendix Fig. A2.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: Motivation of our approach.\nMany template-based methods     [ref]26 predict templates using where 𝒉m​(𝒎)superscript𝒉𝑚𝒎\\bm{h}^{m}(\\bm{m}) is a neural network that maps a molecule\nrepresentation\nto a vector of size dmsubscript𝑑𝑚d_{m}, which we call molecule\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
