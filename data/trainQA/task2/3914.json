      "content": "Paper Title: Incorporating Prior Knowledge into Neural Networks through an Implicit Composite Kernel\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn complex regression tasks, input data often contains multiple sources of information. These sources can be presented in both high-dimensional (e.g. images, audios, texts, etc.) and low-dimensional (e.g. timestamps, spatial locations, etc.) forms. A common approach to learn from high-dimensional information is to use neural networks (NNs) [ref]17 9, as NNs are powerful enough to capture the relationship between complex high-dimensional data and target variables of interest. In many areas, NNs are standard practice, such as the dominance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image analysis   . In contrast, for low-dimensional information, we usually have some prior knowledge on how the information relates to the predictions. As a concrete example, consider a remote sensing problem where we predict ground measurements from satellite imagery with associated timestamps. A priori, we expect the ground measurements to vary periodically with respect to time between summer and winter due to seasonal effects. We would typically use a CNN to capture the complex relationship between the imagery and the ground measurements. In this case, we want to guide the learning of the CNN with our prior knowledge about the seasonality. This is challenging because knowledge represented in NNs pertains mainly to correlation between network units instead of quantifiable statements [ref]33. Conversely, Gaussian processes (GPs) have been used historically to incorporate relevant prior beliefs by specifying the appropriate form of its kernel (or covariance) function  . One approach to modeling multiple sources of information is to assign a relevant kernel function to each source of information respectively and combine them through addition or multiplication, resulting in a composite kernel function . This formulation means that specifying a kernel to match prior beliefs on one source of information is straightforward. Such composite kernel learning techniques are extensively used in many application areas such as multi-media data , neuroimaging , spatial data analysis, and environmental data analysis 5 . In view of the clear modeling capabilities of GP, it is desirable to examine how a NN could be imbued with the same modeling ease. In recent years, researchers have come up with a variety of methods to incorporate prior knowledge into NNs. These efforts can be broken into many categories, such as those that add prior information through loss terms like physics-informed NNs 8 . Here, we focus on the major category of those methods that build integrated models of NNs and GPs with various structures   . Related to our proposed methodology, Pearce et al.  exploited the fact that a Bayesian neural network (BNN) approximates a GP to construct additive and multiplicative kernels, but they were limited to specific predefined kernels. Matsubara et al.  then resolved this limitation by constructing priors of BNN parameters based on the ridgelet transform and its dual, but they did not explicitly show how their approach works for data with multiple sources of information. To our knowledge, no existing approach allows a modeler to choose any appropriate kernel over multiple sources. We address this limitation by presenting a simple yet novel Implicit Composite Kernel (ICK) framework, which processes high-dimensional information using a kernel implicitly defined by a neural network and low-dimensional information using a chosen kernel function. The low-dimensional kernels are mapped into the neural network framework to create a straightforward and simple-to-learn implementation. Our key results and contributions are: We analytically show our ICK framework, under reasonable assumptions, is approximately equivalent to sampling from a Gaussian process regression (GPR) model with a composite kernel a priori. We adopt a sample-then-optimize procedure to ICK to approximate the full posterior distribution of a GP with a composite kernel. We show that ICK yields better performance on prediction and forecasting tasks, even with limited data. We show that ICK can flexibly capture the patterns of the low-dimensional information without bespoke pre-processing procedures or complex NN structures. Based on these contributions, we believe ICK is useful in learning from complex hybrid data with prior knowledge, especially in remote sensing and spatial statistics.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: (e.g. images, audios, texts, etc.) and low-dimensional (e.g. timestamps, spatial locations, etc.) forms.
