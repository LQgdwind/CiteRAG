      "content": "Paper Title: More Interpretable Graph Similarity Computation via Maximum Common Subgraph Inference\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we systematically evaluate the performance of our INFMCS with comparison to recently proposed state-of-the-art approaches for both the graph-graph classification and graph-graph regression tasks, and with significant goals of addressing the following questions: Q1: How effective, efficient and robust is INFMCS compared to the state-of-the-art approaches under MCS/GED metric? Q2: How does the proposed similarity computation paradigm and GCwT with permutation-invariant Positional Encoding improve performance? Q3: Does INFMCS have stronger interpretability? Data For graph-graph classification task, we use FFmpeg333https://ffmpeg.org/ and OpenSSL444https://www.openssl.org/ 1 as datasets, where each graph denotes binary function‚Äôs control flow graph (CFG). Therefore, we take two CFGs compiled from the same source code as positive samples, i.e., s‚Äã(ùí¢1,ùí¢2)=1ùë†subscriptùí¢1subscriptùí¢21s\\left(\\mathcal{G}_{1},\\mathcal{G}_{2}\\right)=1, and the dissimilar CFGs compiled from different source code, i.e., s‚Äã(ùí¢1,ùí¢2)=0ùë†subscriptùí¢1subscriptùí¢20s\\left(\\mathcal{G}_{1},\\mathcal{G}_{2}\\right)=0. Moreover, we split each dataset into 3 sub-datasets according to the graph size in order to investigate the impact of graph size. For graph-graph regression task, we employ three real datasets and three sythetic datasets, including AIDS(2-15), LINUX(2-15), PTC_MM(all), BA100, BA200 and BA300. We extract graphs from the original datasets (AIDS , LINUX , PTC_MM 1)555https://chrsmrrs.github.io/datasets/docs/datasets/ and construct the above three real datasets, where the values in parentheses indicate the size range of extracted graph. To verify the performance on large graphs, we also use the Barab√°si‚ÄìAlbert model  to generate sythetic graphs. We generated three sythetic datasets with graph sizes around 100, 200, and 300 respectively, called BA100, BA200 and BA300. Detailed descriptions and statistics of both real and synthetic datasets can be found in the appendix. Evaluation For the graph-graph classification task, we use Area Under the Curve (AUC)  to evaluate the model. For the graph-graph regression task, we use averaged Mean Squared Error (mse), Spearman‚Äôs Rank Correlation Coefficient (œÅùúå\\rho) [ref]34 and Precision at k (p@k) to test the accuracy and ranking performance. To avoid information leakage, we let the model compute the similarity between the query graph and each graph in the original test set to rank. Baselines We use eight SOTA learning-based methods as baselines, including GMN , SimGNN , GraphSim , MGMN 1, H2MN 6, GOTSim , PSimGNN 2, EMBAVG  and SMPNN 9. Besides methods PSimGNN 2 and EMBAVG , we use the source code released by the authors for the regression task. We reproduced the above two baselines according to the original papers. We also tune their hyperparameters on the validation set on the regression task. For the classification task, we use the AUC scores reported in 6 as the results for each baseline. We also use five classical algorithms as baselines to compare running time, including A* , MCSPLIT 6, BEAM 7, HUNGARIAN , VJ  and HED . Implementation Settings Our proposed INFMCS is implemented with Deep Graph Library (DGL)  and Pytorch 8. Regarding the model‚Äôs hyperparameters, we fix the number of GCN layers to 3. We search the number of Transformer layers L‚àà{2,4,6,8}ùêø2468L\\in\\{2,4,6,8\\} and the dimension of hidden layers d‚àà{128,256,512}ùëë128256512d\\in\\{128,256,512\\}, where the dimension of all hidden layers is set to the same. More details about the hyper-parameter search can be found in the appendix. We conduct all the experiments on a machine with an Intel Xeon 4114 CPU and two Nvidia Titan GPU. As for training, we use the Adam algorithm for optimization 4 and fix the initial learning rate to 0.001. The proposed model is trained on real datasets for 100 epochs with a batch size of 128 and on synthetic datasets for 30 epochs with a batch size of 32. Checkpoints are saved for each epoch to select the best checkpoints on the evaluation set. The source code can be found in the supplementary materials.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: task, we use Area Under the Curve (AUC)  to evaluate the model.
