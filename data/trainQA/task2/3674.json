      "content": "Paper Title: Revisiting Multi-Scale Feature Fusion for Semantic Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSemantic segmentation is an important computer vision task that has been widely used in robotics and autonomous driving. The main challenge in semantic segmentation lies in the per-pixel dense prediction, where we need to predict the semantic class for each pixel. State-of-the-art (SOTA) segmentation models   [ref]6  [ref]35 heavily rely on high internal resolution for dense prediction, and it is commonly believed that such high internal resolution is necessary to learn accurate per-pixel semantics, leading to slow runtime speed and large runtime memory usage. For example, DeepLabV3+  requires more than 1000B FLOPs (vs common real-time models using <<100B FLOPs), making it prohibitively expensive to apply to real-time scenarios. Meanwhile, the high-resolution feature maps make it difficult to obtain large receptive fields. Many attempts have been made to address this issue, for example by replacing the regular convolutions with atrous convolutions   [ref]6  or adding additional attention modules [ref]46   to enlarge receptive fields.\nAlthough these methods improve accuracy, atrous convolutions and attention modules are usually much slower than regular convolutions. Recent real-time semantic segmentation models tend to learn high-resolution representation in different ways to satisfy the latency constraints, either by hand-crafting better networks   or by using neural architecture search  . These methods tend to improve accuracy, but they still need to maintain the high internal resolution. In this paper, we question the belief in high internal resolution and demonstrate that neither high internal resolution nor atrous convolutions are necessary for accurate segmentation. Our intuition is that although segmentation is a dense per-pixel prediction task, the semantics of each pixel often depend on both nearby neighbors and far-away context; therefore, conventional multi-scale feature space can easily be a bottleneck, and a more powerful multi-resolution feature fusion network is desired. Following this intuition, we revisit the conventional simple feature fusion space (typically up to P5subscript𝑃5P_{5} from traditional classification backbones) and extend it to a much richer space, up to P9subscript𝑃9P_{9}, where the smallest internal resolution is only 1/51215121/512 of the input image size and thus can have a very large receptive field. Based on the richer multi-resolution feature space, we present a simplified segmentation model named ESeg, which has neither high internal resolution nor expensive atrous convolutions. To keep the model as simple as possible, we adopt the naive encoder-decoder network structure, where the encoder is an off-the-shelf EfficientNet  and the decoder is a slightly-modified BiFPN . We observe that as the multi-resolution feature space up to P9subscript𝑃9P_{9} has much richer information than conventional approaches, a powerful bi-directional feature pyramid is extremely important here to effectively fuse these features. Unlike the conventional top-down FPN, BiFPN allows both top-down and bottom-up feature fusion, enabling more effective feature fusion in the rich multi-scale feature space. We evaluate our ESeg on CityScapes  and ADE20K , two widely used benchmarks for semantic segmentation. Surprisingly, although ESeg is much simpler, it consistently matches the performance of prior art across different datasets. By scaling up the network size, our ESeg models achieve better accuracy while using 2×\\times - 9×\\times fewer parameters and 4×\\times - 50×\\times fewer FLOPs than competitive methods. In real-time settings, our ESeg-Lite-S achieves 76.0% mIoU on the CityScapes validation set at 189 FPS, outperforming the prior art of FasterSeg by 2.9% mIoU at faster speed. With 80.1% CityScapes mIoU at 79 FPS, our ESeg-Lite-L bridges the gap between real-time and advanced segmentation models for the first time.\n In addition to the standard CityScapes/ADE20K datasets, our models also perform well on large-scale datasets. By pretraining on the larger Mapillaly Vistas  and self-training on CityScapes coarse-labeled data, our ESeg-L achieves 84.8% mIoU on the CityScapes validation set, while being much smaller and faster than prior art. These results highlight the importance of multi-scale features for semantic segmentation, demonstrating that a simple network is also able to achieve state-of-the-art performance.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: driving.
