This defines the teaching map (TM) T𝑇T and\nthe teaching sets T​(C),C∈𝒞𝑇𝐶𝐶𝒞T(C),C\\in\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}}. The goal is to find a teaching map T𝑇T that uses a minimum\nnumber of labeled training examples, i.e., one that minimizes the size of a largest teaching set. The examples selected in T​(C)𝑇𝐶T(C) by the teacher are the most helpful to the learner to reconstruct C𝐶C, in contrast to models of\nlearning (such as PAC-learning) where the learner has to reconstruct a concept of 𝒞𝒞\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}} from randomly chosen examples. A multitude of formal models of machine teaching exist in the literature, like      8 . These models differ by the conditions imposed\non the teacher and the learner. In particular, several of these are batch teaching models, where labeled examples proposed by the teacher to the learner are sets.\nThis is in contrast to sequential teaching models, where the labeled examples are not presented all at once, but rather in a particular sequence chosen by the teacher.\nA key notion in formal models of machine teaching is the notion of collusion, i.e., the teacher and the learner should not be allowed to collude.\nThe benchmark for preventing collusion is the Goldman-Mathias collusion-avoidance criterion . Recently, a batch teaching model called non-clashing teaching (or NC-teaching)\nwas proposed and investigated by Kirkpatrick, Simon, and Zilles in , and by the same authors along with Fallat and Soltani in .\nGiven a concept class 𝒞𝒞\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}}, a teaching map T𝑇T on 𝒞𝒞\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}} is non-clashing if, for any two distinct concepts C,C′∈𝒞𝐶superscript𝐶′𝒞C,C^{\\prime}\\in\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}}, either T​(C)𝑇𝐶T(C) is\nnot consistent with C′superscript𝐶′C^{\\prime} or T​(C′)𝑇superscript𝐶′T(C^{\\prime}) is not consistent with C𝐶C, or both. They showed that non-clashing teaching is the most efficient model that satisfies\nthe Goldman-Mathias collusion-avoidance criterion  . It is common to consider teaching models that restrict the teacher to only presenting positive examples to the learner, with  and  representing some of the earliest successes of this approach. These models have been vastly studied in the literature due to their pertinence in, for example, grammatical inference 8 0, computational biology 2 3, and recommendation systems 7. For these reasons, the authors of   also introduced and studied the variant of positive NC-teaching, in which the teacher may only use positive examples. Similarly to the classical PAC-learning, where the VC-dimension VCD⁡(𝒞)VCD𝒞\\operatorname{VCD}(\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}}) of 𝒞𝒞\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}} is the driving factor behind the number of randomly chosen examples that are sufficient to learn the concepts of 𝒞𝒞\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}}, various models of machine teaching lead to different notions of teaching dimension, which bound the size of the teaching sets. The definitive teaching dimension, proposed\nindependently by Goldman and Kearns  and Shinohara and Miyano 8, is a prototypical one.\nInformally, a definitive teaching set of a concept C∈𝒞𝐶𝒞C\\in\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}} is a 𝒞𝒞\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}}-sample (a sample consistent with some concept of 𝒞𝒞\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}})\nfor which C𝐶C is the only consistent concept in 𝒞𝒞\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}}.\nThe definitive teaching dimension of 𝒞𝒞\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}} is the maximum size of a definitive teaching set over all the concepts of 𝒞𝒞\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}}.\nNote also the important notion of recursive teaching dimension (RTD) introduced in .\nThe NC-teaching and positive NC-teaching of   also lead to corresponding dimension parameters.\nThe size of a teaching map T𝑇T on 𝒞𝒞\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}} is the maximum size of T​(C)𝑇𝐶T(C) over all C∈𝒞𝐶𝒞C\\in\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}}. The non-clashing teaching dimension NCTD⁡(𝒞)NCTD𝒞\\operatorname{NCTD}(\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}}) (positive non-clashing teaching dimension NCTD+⁡(𝒞)superscriptNCTD𝒞\\operatorname{NCTD^{+}}(\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}}), respectively) is the\nminimum size of a non-clashing teaching map (NCTM) T𝑇T for 𝒞𝒞\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}} (positive non-clashing teaching map (NCTM+superscriptNCTM\\operatorname{NCTM^{+}}) T𝑇T for 𝒞𝒞\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}}, respectively)  .\nAn important research direction for various notions of teaching dimension is their relationship with the classical VC-dimension VCD⁡(𝒞)VCD𝒞\\operatorname{VCD}(\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}}).\nFor NC-teaching, the authors of   mention that “The most fundamental\nopen question resulting from our paper is probably whether NCTD is upper-bounded by VCD in general”, and 9 also mentions this open question. NCTMs are signed versions of representation maps (RMs) for concept\nclasses. Kuzmin and Warmuth 0 introduced RMs to design\nunlabeled sample compression schemes (SCSs) for maximum concept\nclasses. They proved that the existence of RMs of size d=VCD⁡(𝒞)𝑑VCD𝒞d=\\operatorname{VCD}(\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}})\nfor a maximum class 𝒞𝒞\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}} is equivalent to the existence of unlabeled\nSCSs of size d𝑑d for 𝒞𝒞\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}} 0. In 1, this\nequivalence was generalized to ample classes, and they also construct\nRMs of size d𝑑d for maximum classes. The main difference between NCTMs\nand RMs is that RMs assign to each concept\nC∈𝒞𝐶𝒞C\\in\\mathcal{C} a set shattered by 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}.\nLittlestone and Warmuth 2 introduced SCSs, which have\nbeen vastly studied in the literature due to their importance in computational machine learning.\nRoughly, an SCS consists of a compressor α𝛼\\alpha and a reconstructor β𝛽\\beta, and the aim is to compress 𝒞𝒞\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}}-samples as much as possible,\nsuch that data coherent with the original samples can be reconstructed from the compressed data.\nFloyd and Warmuth  asked whether any concept class of VC-dimension d𝑑d has an SCS of size O​(d)𝑂𝑑O(d), and this remains an\nimportant open problem. There are similarities and differences between TMs and SCSs.\nLike the TM T𝑇T, the compressor α𝛼\\alpha compresses any 𝒞𝒞\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}}-sample S𝑆S to a subsample S′superscript𝑆′S^{\\prime} of S𝑆S consisting of\nthe most helpful examples. The difference between T𝑇T and α𝛼\\alpha is that T𝑇T has 𝒞𝒞\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}} as its domain, while\nthe domain of α𝛼\\alpha is the set of all 𝒞𝒞\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}}-samples. The images of T𝑇T and α𝛼\\alpha are subsamples of the input samples. The second difference\nis that, in teaching models, the learner must return a concept from 𝒞𝒞\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}} compatible\nwith the teacher’s sample, while in SCSs, the reconstructor β𝛽\\beta must return just a subset of the universe compatible with the input sample\n(however, in proper SCSs, β𝛽\\beta must return a concept of 𝒞𝒞\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}} compatible with the input sample). Lastly, note that, for any positive integer k𝑘k, there exists a concept class 𝒞𝒞\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}} for which\nNCTD⁡(𝒞)=1NCTD𝒞1\\operatorname{NCTD}(\\operatorname{\\mathcal{C}})=1 and each SCS has size at least k𝑘k [20, Proposition 40]. In this paper, we continue the research on NCTMs and NCTM+superscriptNCTM\\operatorname{NCTM^{+}}s started in  , for the concept\nclass ℬ⁡(G)ℬ𝐺\\operatorname{\\mathcal{B}}(G) consisting of all balls of a graph G𝐺G. For several graph classes, we derive NC-teaching maps for ℬ⁡(G)ℬ𝐺\\operatorname{\\mathcal{B}}(G) of size proportional to the VC-dimension of ℬ⁡(G)ℬ𝐺\\operatorname{\\mathcal{B}}(G).\nFurther, we investigate the computational complexity of the following decision problems: \n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Clashing Teaching Dimension for Balls in Graphs (B-NCTD)\n\n\nInput: A graph G𝐺G on n𝑛n vertices and a positive integer k𝑘k.\nQuestion: Is NCTD⁡(ℬ⁡(G))≤kNCTDℬ𝐺𝑘\\operatorname{NCTD}(\\operatorname{\\mathcal{B}}(G))\\leq k?\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPositive Non-Clashing Teaching Dimension for Balls in Graphs (B-NCTD+)\n\n\nInput: A graph G𝐺G on n𝑛n vertices and a positive integer k𝑘k.\nQuestion: Is NCTD+⁡(ℬ⁡(G))≤ksuperscriptNCTDℬ𝐺𝑘\\operatorname{NCTD^{+}}(\\operatorname{\\mathcal{B}}(G))\\leq k?\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: is a core paradigm in computational learning theory that has attracted significant attention due to its applications in diverse areas\nsuch as trustworthy AI  , inverse reinforcement learning [ref]9 , robotics  , and education 3 \n(see  for an overview of such applications).\nIn machine teaching models, given a concept class 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}, a teacher presents to a learner a carefully chosen\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
