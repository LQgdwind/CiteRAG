There exists a function f:ℕ→ℕ:𝑓→ℕℕf:\\mathbb{N}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{N} satisfying f​(k)=2(1−o​(1))⋅k/2𝑓𝑘superscript2⋅1𝑜1𝑘2f(k)=2^{(1-o(1))\\cdot k/2} such that for every sufficiently large integer k𝑘k, it is 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hard to decide whether a given graph G𝐺G satisfies Theorem 1.1 implies that it is 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hard to approximate the orthogonality dimension of a graph over the reals to within any constant factor.\nPreviously, such an 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hardness result was known to hold only for approximation factors smaller than 3/2323/2 . We proceed with the following result, which is concerned with the orthogonality dimension and the minrank parameter over finite fields. For every finite field 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F}, there exists a function f:ℕ→ℕ:𝑓→ℕℕf:\\mathbb{N}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{N} satisfying f​(k)=2(1−o​(1))⋅k/2𝑓𝑘superscript2⋅1𝑜1𝑘2f(k)=2^{(1-o(1))\\cdot k/2} such that for every sufficiently large integer k𝑘k, the following holds. It is 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hard to decide whether a given graph G𝐺G satisfies ξ¯𝔽​(G)≤ksubscript¯𝜉𝔽𝐺𝑘\\overline{\\xi}_{\\mathbb{F}}(G)\\leq k or ξ¯𝔽​(G)≥f​(k)subscript¯𝜉𝔽𝐺𝑓𝑘\\overline{\\xi}_{\\mathbb{F}}(G)\\geq f(k). It is 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hard to decide whether a given graph G𝐺G satisfies minrk𝔽(G)≤ksubscriptminrk𝔽𝐺𝑘{\\mathop{\\mathrm{minrk}}}_{\\mathbb{F}}(G)\\leq k or minrk𝔽(G)≥f​(k)subscriptminrk𝔽𝐺𝑓𝑘{\\mathop{\\mathrm{minrk}}}_{\\mathbb{F}}(G)\\geq f(k). Theorem 1.2 implies that over any finite field, it is 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hard to approximate the orthogonality dimension and the minrank of a graph to within any constant factor.\nLet us stress that this hardness result relies solely on the assumption 𝖯≠𝖭𝖯𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{P}\\neq\\mathsf{NP} rather than on stronger complexity assumptions and thus settles a question raised in .\nPrior to this work, it was known that it is 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hard to approximate the minrank of graphs to within any factor smaller than 4/3434/3  and the minrank of digraphs over 𝔽2subscript𝔽2\\mathbb{F}_{2} to within any factor smaller than 3/2323/2 . A central component of the proofs of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 is the notion of line digraphs, introduced in , that was first used in the context of hardness of approximation by Wrochna and Živný  (see also ).\nIt was shown in [ref]21  that the chromatic number of any graph is exponential in the chromatic number of its line digraph.\nThis result was iteratively applied by the authors of  to improve the 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hardness of the chromatic number from the k𝑘k vs. 2k1/3superscript2superscript𝑘132^{k^{1/3}} gap of  to their k𝑘k vs. (k⌊k/2⌋)binomial𝑘𝑘2\\binom{k}{\\lfloor k/2\\rfloor} gap.\nThe main technical contribution of the present work lies in analyzing the orthogonality dimension of line digraphs and the minrank parameter of their complement.\nWe actually show that on line digraphs, these graph parameters are quadratically related to the chromatic number.\nThis allows us to derive our hardness results from the hardness of the chromatic number given in , where the obtained gaps are only quadratically weaker.\nWe further discuss some limitations of our approach, involving an analogue of Sperner’s theorem for subspaces due to Kalai . To demonstrate our combinatorial contribution, consider a finite field 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} and a graph G𝐺G, and let H𝐻H denote the underlying graph of the line digraph associated with G𝐺G (see Definition 3.1).\nIt is shown in [ref]21  that χ​(H)𝜒𝐻\\chi(H) is the smallest integer n𝑛n such that χ​(G)≤(n⌊n/2⌋)𝜒𝐺binomial𝑛𝑛2\\chi(G)\\leq\\binom{n}{\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor}. In particular, if χ​(G)≤(n⌊n/2⌋)𝜒𝐺binomial𝑛𝑛2\\chi(G)\\leq\\binom{n}{\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor} then ξ¯𝔽​(H)≤χ​(H)≤nsubscript¯𝜉𝔽𝐻𝜒𝐻𝑛\\overline{\\xi}_{\\mathbb{F}}(H)\\leq\\chi(H)\\leq n. On the other hand, we prove that if ξ¯𝔽​(H)≤nsubscript¯𝜉𝔽𝐻𝑛\\overline{\\xi}_{\\mathbb{F}}(H)\\leq n then χ​(G)≤|𝔽|n2𝜒𝐺superscript𝔽superscript𝑛2\\chi(G)\\leq|\\mathbb{F}|^{n^{2}}, which implies that By combining these bounds, it follows that ξ¯𝔽​(H)subscript¯𝜉𝔽𝐻\\overline{\\xi}_{\\mathbb{F}}(H) and χ​(H)𝜒𝐻\\chi(H) are quadratically related.\nResults of this nature are also proved for the orthogonality dimension over the reals and for the minrank parameter over finite fields (see Theorems 3.5, 3.7, and 3.13). We finally show that our approach might be useful for proving hardness results for the general (non-linear) index coding problem over a constant-size alphabet, for which no 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hardness result is currently known.\nIt was shown by Langberg and Sprintson  that for an instance of the index coding problem represented by a graph G𝐺G, the length of an optimal solution is at most χ​(G¯)𝜒¯𝐺\\chi(\\overline{G}) and at least Ω​(log⁡log⁡χ​(G¯))Ω𝜒¯𝐺\\Omega(\\log\\log\\chi(\\overline{G})).\nIt thus follows that an 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hardness result for the chromatic number with a double-exponential gap would imply an 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hardness result for the general index coding problem.\nHowever, no such 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hardness result is currently known for the chromatic number without relying on further complexity assumptions.\nTo tackle this issue, we study the index coding problem on instances which are complement of line digraphs (see Theorem 3.17). As a consequence of our results, we obtain that the 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hardness of the general index coding problem can be derived from an 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hardness result of the chromatic number with only a single-exponential gap, not that far from the best known gap given in . For a precise statement, see Theorem 4.7.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: the proofs of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 is the notion of line digraphs, introduced in , that was first used in the context of hardness of approximation by Wrochna and Živný  (see also ).\nIt was shown in [ref]21  that the chromatic number of any graph is exponential in the chromatic number of its line digraph.\nThis result was iteratively applied by the authors of  to improve the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
