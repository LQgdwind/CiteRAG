      "content": "Paper Title: Proof-theoretic Semantics for First-order Logic\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we define the B-eS for classical logic. The motivations for this B-eS are explained by Sandqvist in  . We begins with the notion of an atomic system, which may be thought of as an agent’s position on the facts of and inferential relationships between certain propositions. For example, Aristotle may believe both ‘Socrates is human’ and ‘if someone is human, then they are mortal’. An agent whose beliefs are given by a certain atomic system is compelled, on the basis of holding those beliefs, to believe the consequences of their inferential relationship. For example, Aristotle is compelled to believe ‘Socrates in mortal’ on the basis of the facts and inferential relationships described above. Mathematically, a fact or an inferential relationship is described by an atomic rule: An atomic rule is a pair {ℙ1⇒P1,…​ℙn⇒Pn}⇒P⇒formulae-sequence⇒subscriptℙ1subscript𝑃1⇒…subscriptℙ𝑛subscript𝑃𝑛𝑃\\{\\mathbb{P}_{1}\\Rightarrow P_{1},\\ldots\\mathbb{P}_{n}\\Rightarrow P_{n}\\}\\Rightarrow P. An atomic rule is zero-level if n=0𝑛0n=0, it is first-level if n≠0𝑛0n\\neq 0 but ℙ1,…,ℙn=∅subscriptℙ1…subscriptℙ𝑛\\mathbb{P}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbb{P}_{n}=\\emptyset, and it is second-level otherwise. An atomic system 𝒮𝒮\\mathscr{S} is a set of atomic rules. Let 𝒮𝒮\\mathscr{S} be an atomic system. Derivability in 𝒮𝒮\\mathscr{S} is defined inductively as follows: ref. If P∈ℙ𝑃ℙP\\in\\mathbb{P}, then ℙ⊢𝒮P\\mathbb{P}\\vdash_{\\mathscr{S}}P app. If 𝒮∣{ℙ1⇒P1,…​ℙn⇒Pn}⇒P∈𝒮⇒conditional𝒮formulae-sequence⇒subscriptℙ1subscript𝑃1⇒…subscriptℙ𝑛subscript𝑃𝑛𝑃𝒮\\mathcal{S}\\mid\\{\\mathbb{P}_{1}\\Rightarrow P_{1},\\ldots\\mathbb{P}_{n}\\Rightarrow P_{n}\\}\\Rightarrow P\\in\\mathscr{S} and ℙ,ℙi⊢𝒮Pi\\mathbb{P},\\mathbb{P}_{i}\\vdash_{\\mathscr{S}}P_{i} for i=1,…,n𝑖1…𝑛i=1,\\ldots,n with ℙ∩𝒮=∅ℙ𝒮\\mathbb{P}\\cap\\mathcal{S}=\\emptyset, then ℙ⊢𝒮P\\mathbb{P}\\vdash_{\\mathscr{S}}P. It is convenient to think of app as comprising two different cases: app1subscriptapp1\\textsc{app}_{1} for zero-level rules and app2subscriptapp2\\textsc{app}_{2} for first- and second-level. We do this in several proofs below as the former case is, essentially, a base case for the inductive definition. Aristotle’s beliefs above may be represented symbolically by an atomic system 𝒮𝒮\\mathscr{S} containing the rule ⟨∅,H​(s),∅⟩𝐻𝑠\\langle\\emptyset,H(s),\\emptyset\\rangle and all instances of ⟨{∅⇒H​(t)},M​(t),∅⟩⇒𝐻𝑡𝑀𝑡\\langle\\{\\emptyset\\Rightarrow H(t)\\},M(t),\\emptyset\\rangle as t𝑡t ranges over all terms. Moreover, on the basis of this belief set, Aristotle is compelled to think M​(t)𝑀𝑡M(t) as it can be seen that ⊢𝒮M(s)\\vdash_{\\mathscr{S}}M(s). This notation suggests a relationship to natural deduction in the sense of Gentzen : That this reading is correct can be seen in Definition 14. However, since there is no substation in the use of such rules, they are, perhaps, more closely related to hereditary Harrop formulae — see Gheorghiu and Pym [ref]12 for more details. In B-eS, meaning is grounded in atomic systems. However, not all sets of atomic rules may be accepted as well-formed sets of believes. Therefore, we introduce the idea of a basis as describing what kinds of atomic systems we work with: A basis 𝔅𝔅\\mathfrak{B} is a set of atomic systems. Below, we distinguish classical and intuitionistic consequence by basis. In particular, we have the following They will distinguish classical and intuitionistic logic. We reflect on this in Section 6. Having fixed a basis 𝔅𝔅\\mathfrak{B}, its elements are called bases ℬℬ\\mathscr{B}. Once a basis is fixed, we always work relative to bases (not atomic systems). We introduce the notion of base-extension as a restricted version of superset (or ‘extension’) of an atomic system that respects the basis in which we are working. Given a basis 𝔅𝔅\\mathfrak{B}, base-extension is the least relation satisfying the following: Having fixed a basis, the bases ground the meaning of atomic propositions. The meaning of the logical signs is given by clauses that collective define a semantic judgment called support. Let 𝔅𝔅\\mathfrak{B} be a basis and ℬ∈𝔅ℬ𝔅\\mathscr{B}\\in\\mathfrak{B}. Support is the smallest relation ⊩forces\\Vdash defined by the clauses of Figure 2 in which all formulae are closed, ΔΔ\\Delta is a non-empty set of closed formulae, and ΓΓ\\Gamma is a (possibly empty) set of formulae. This support relation serves both CL and IL, but with different basis — namely, ℭℭ\\mathfrak{C} for CL and ℑℑ\\mathfrak{I} for IL. For CL, we only take ⊥bottom\\bot, →→\\to, and ∀for-all\\forall as primitive and define the other signs in terms of them (e.g., ϕ∨ψitalic-ϕ𝜓\\phi\\lor\\psi abbreviates ¬(¬ϕ∧¬ψ)italic-ϕ𝜓\\neg(\\neg\\phi\\land\\neg\\psi)). In contrast, for IL, we take all the logical signs are primitive. We extend support in a base (⊩forces\\Vdash) to all wffs by taking the universal closure of formulas with free variables. That is, let ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi and let 𝖥𝖵​(ϕ)={x1,…,xn}𝖥𝖵italic-ϕsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛\\mathsf{FV}(\\phi)=\\{x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}\\}, To make this deterministic, we may choose that x1,…,xnsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n} are the free variables in ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi as it is read right to left. Having established such a closure, we define the support of open formulae as follows: Definition 17 is an inductive definition, but the induction measure is not the size of the formula ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi. Instead, it is a measure of the logical weight of ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi in a way where disjunction (∨\\lor) and the existential quantifier (∃)(\\exists) weighs more than implication (→)→(\\to) — see Sandqvist  for details. We call induction relative to this measure, ‘semantic’ induction to distinguish it from ‘structural’ induction over the syntax. There are two results we shall claim about this setup: Let 𝔅=𝔎𝔅𝔎\\mathfrak{B}=\\mathfrak{K} and ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi only contain ⊥,→,∀bottom→for-all\\bot,\\to,\\forall as logical signs, This is the result given by Sandqvist  , with a simpler proof by Makinson  for propositional fragment that makes use of the logic’s truth-functional semantics. We give an elementary proof that is native to the setup of the semantics. Let 𝔅=ℑ𝔅ℑ\\mathfrak{B}=\\mathfrak{I}, The propositional version was shown by Sandqvist , we show that it extends to the first-order case. The focus of these results is not the statements themselves, which are not surprising, but that the same, elementary proof is used in both cases modulo the basis. We reflect on this in Section 6. Before proceeding to prove this theorem, we observe some elementary but important results about it that hold with respect to any basis 𝔅𝔅\\mathfrak{B}. If ⊩ℬϕsubscriptforcesℬabsentitalic-ϕ\\Vdash_{\\mathscr{B}}\\phi and 𝒞⊇𝔅ℬsubscriptsuperset-of-or-equals𝔅𝒞ℬ\\mathscr{C}\\supseteq_{\\mathfrak{B}}\\mathscr{B}, then ⊩𝒞ϕsubscriptforces𝒞absentitalic-ϕ\\Vdash_{\\mathscr{C}}\\phi. We follow the plan by Sandqvist  and proceed by semantic induction on ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi: ϕ∈cl​(𝒜)italic-ϕcl𝒜\\phi\\in\\textsc{cl}(\\mathcal{A}). Immediate since the inductive definition for ⊢ℬ\\vdash_{\\mathscr{B}} is satisfied by ⊢𝒞\\vdash_{\\mathscr{C}}. ϕ=⊥italic-ϕbottom\\phi=\\bot. By (⊥bottom\\bot), ⊩ℬPsubscriptforcesℬabsent𝑃\\Vdash_{\\mathscr{B}}P for all P∈cl​(𝒜)𝑃cl𝒜P\\in\\textsc{cl}(\\mathcal{A}). Hence, by the preceding case, ⊩𝒞Psubscriptforces𝒞absent𝑃\\Vdash_{\\mathscr{C}}P for all P∈cl​(𝒜)𝑃cl𝒜P\\in\\textsc{cl}(\\mathcal{A}). Whence, by (⊥bottom\\bot), ⊩𝒞⊥subscriptforces𝒞absentbottom\\Vdash_{\\mathscr{C}}\\bot, as required. ϕ=ϕ1∧ϕ2italic-ϕsubscriptitalic-ϕ1subscriptitalic-ϕ2\\phi=\\phi_{1}\\land\\phi_{2}. By (∧\\land), ⊩ℬϕ1subscriptforcesℬabsentsubscriptitalic-ϕ1\\Vdash_{\\mathscr{B}}\\phi_{1} and ⊩ℬϕ2subscriptforcesℬabsentsubscriptitalic-ϕ2\\Vdash_{\\mathscr{B}}\\phi_{2}. By the induction hypothesis (IH), ⊩𝒞ϕ1subscriptforces𝒞absentsubscriptitalic-ϕ1\\Vdash_{\\mathscr{C}}\\phi_{1} and ⊩𝒞ϕ2subscriptforces𝒞absentsubscriptitalic-ϕ2\\Vdash_{\\mathscr{C}}\\phi_{2}. Thus, by (∧\\land), ⊩𝒞ϕ1∧ϕ2subscriptforces𝒞absentsubscriptitalic-ϕ1subscriptitalic-ϕ2\\Vdash_{\\mathscr{C}}\\phi_{1}\\land\\phi_{2}. ϕ=ϕ1∨ϕ2italic-ϕsubscriptitalic-ϕ1subscriptitalic-ϕ2\\phi=\\phi_{1}\\lor\\phi_{2}. Let 𝒟⊇𝔅𝒞subscriptsuperset-of-or-equals𝔅𝒟𝒞\\mathscr{D}\\supseteq_{\\mathfrak{B}}\\mathscr{C} and P∈cl​(𝒜)𝑃cl𝒜P\\in\\textsc{cl}(\\mathcal{A}) be such that ϕ1⊩𝒟Psubscriptforces𝒟subscriptitalic-ϕ1𝑃\\phi_{1}\\Vdash_{\\mathscr{D}}P and ϕ2⊩𝒟Psubscriptforces𝒟subscriptitalic-ϕ2𝑃\\phi_{2}\\Vdash_{\\mathscr{D}}P. Since 𝒟⊇𝔅ℬsubscriptsuperset-of-or-equals𝔅𝒟ℬ\\mathscr{D}\\supseteq_{\\mathfrak{B}}\\mathscr{B}, it follows from (∨)(\\lor) that ⊩𝒟Psubscriptforces𝒟absent𝑃\\Vdash_{\\mathscr{D}}P. Thus, ⊩𝒞ϕ1∨ϕ2subscriptforces𝒞absentsubscriptitalic-ϕ1subscriptitalic-ϕ2\\Vdash_{\\mathscr{C}}\\phi_{1}\\lor\\phi_{2} by (∨\\lor) since 𝒟⊇𝒞subscriptsuperset-of-or-equals𝒞𝒟absent\\mathscr{D}\\supseteq_{\\mathscr{C}} was arbitrary. ϕ=ϕ1→ϕ2italic-ϕsubscriptitalic-ϕ1→subscriptitalic-ϕ2\\phi=\\phi_{1}\\to\\phi_{2}. By (→→\\to), we have ϕ⊩ℬψsubscriptforcesℬitalic-ϕ𝜓\\phi\\Vdash_{\\mathscr{B}}\\psi. Let 𝒟⊇𝔅𝒞subscriptsuperset-of-or-equals𝔅𝒟𝒞\\mathscr{D}\\supseteq_{\\mathfrak{B}}\\mathscr{C} be arbitrary such that ⊩𝒟ϕ1subscriptforces𝒟absentsubscriptitalic-ϕ1\\Vdash_{\\mathscr{D}}\\phi_{1}. Since 𝒟⊇𝔅ℬsubscriptsuperset-of-or-equals𝔅𝒟ℬ\\mathscr{D}\\supseteq_{\\mathfrak{B}}\\mathscr{B} we have by (Inf), ⊩𝒟ϕ2subscriptforces𝒟absentsubscriptitalic-ϕ2\\Vdash_{\\mathscr{D}}\\phi_{2}. Thus, ϕ1⊩𝒞ϕ2subscriptforces𝒞subscriptitalic-ϕ1subscriptitalic-ϕ2\\phi_{1}\\Vdash_{\\mathscr{C}}\\phi_{2} by (Inf) since 𝒟𝒟\\mathscr{D} was arbitrary. Thus, ⊩𝒞ϕ1→ϕ2subscriptforces𝒞absentsubscriptitalic-ϕ1→subscriptitalic-ϕ2\\Vdash_{\\mathscr{C}}\\phi_{1}\\to\\phi_{2} by (→→\\to), as desired. ϕ=∀x​ψitalic-ϕfor-all𝑥𝜓\\phi=\\forall x\\psi. By (∀for-all\\forall), we have ⊩ℬψ​[x↦t]subscriptforcesℬabsent𝜓delimited-[]maps-to𝑥𝑡\\Vdash_{\\mathscr{B}}\\psi[x\\mapsto t] for any t∈cl​(𝒯)𝑡cl𝒯t\\in\\textsc{cl}(\\mathcal{T}). By the IH, ⊩𝒞ψ​[x↦t]subscriptforces𝒞absent𝜓delimited-[]maps-to𝑥𝑡\\Vdash_{\\mathscr{C}}\\psi[x\\mapsto t] for any t∈cl​(𝒯)𝑡cl𝒯t\\in\\textsc{cl}(\\mathcal{T}). Hence, by (∀for-all\\forall), ⊩𝒞∀x​ψsubscriptforces𝒞absentfor-all𝑥𝜓\\Vdash_{\\mathscr{C}}\\forall x\\psi, as required. ϕ=∃x​ψitalic-ϕ𝑥𝜓\\phi=\\exists x\\psi. Let 𝒟⊇𝔅𝒞subscriptsuperset-of-or-equals𝔅𝒟𝒞\\mathscr{D}\\supseteq_{\\mathfrak{B}}\\mathscr{C} and P∈cl​(𝒜)𝑃cl𝒜P\\in\\textsc{cl}(\\mathcal{A}) be such that ϕ​[x↦t]⊩𝒟Psubscriptforces𝒟italic-ϕdelimited-[]maps-to𝑥𝑡𝑃\\phi[x\\mapsto t]\\Vdash_{\\mathscr{D}}P for any t∈cl​(𝒯)𝑡cl𝒯t\\in\\textsc{cl}(\\mathcal{T}). Since 𝒟⊇𝔅ℬsubscriptsuperset-of-or-equals𝔅𝒟ℬ\\mathscr{D}\\supseteq_{\\mathfrak{B}}\\mathscr{B}, it follows from (∃\\exists) that ⊩𝒟Psubscriptforces𝒟absent𝑃\\Vdash_{\\mathscr{D}}P. Thus, ⊩𝒞∃x​ϕsubscriptforces𝒞absent𝑥italic-ϕ\\Vdash_{\\mathscr{C}}\\exists x\\phi. This completes the induction.\n∎ For any ℚ,ℙ∈cl​(𝒜)ℚℙcl𝒜\\mathbb{Q},\\mathbb{P}\\in\\textsc{cl}(\\mathcal{A}) (finite) and P∈cl​(𝒜)𝑃cl𝒜P\\in\\textsc{cl}(\\mathcal{A}) and base ℬℬ\\mathscr{B}, We show the two directions of the claim separately: LHS ⟹⟹\\Longrightarrow RHS. Assume ℚ,ℙ⊢ℬP\\mathbb{Q},\\mathbb{P}\\vdash_{\\mathscr{B}}P. Let 𝒳⊇𝔅ℬsubscriptsuperset-of-or-equals𝔅𝒳ℬ\\mathscr{X}\\supseteq_{\\mathfrak{B}}\\mathscr{B} be such that ⊢𝒞Q\\vdash_{\\mathscr{C}}Q for Q∈ℚ𝑄ℚQ\\in\\mathbb{Q}. We require to show ℙ⊢𝒞P\\mathbb{P}\\vdash_{\\mathscr{C}}P. We proceed by induction on how ℚ,ℙ⊢ℬP\\mathbb{Q},\\mathbb{P}\\vdash_{\\mathscr{B}}P obtains: ref. It follows that P∈ℚ∪ℙ𝑃ℚℙP\\in\\mathbb{Q}\\cup\\mathbb{P}. If P∈ℙ𝑃ℙP\\in\\mathbb{P}, the result follows vacuously by ref. If P∈ℚ𝑃ℚP\\in\\mathbb{Q}, the desired result follows immediately from the definition of 𝒞𝒞\\mathscr{C}. app1. We have that ⇒P∈ℬ⇒absent𝑃ℬ\\Rightarrow P\\in\\mathscr{B}. Since 𝒞⊇𝔅ℬsubscriptsuperset-of-or-equals𝔅𝒞ℬ\\mathscr{C}\\supseteq_{\\mathfrak{B}}\\mathscr{B}, we have ⇒P∈𝒞⇒absent𝑃𝒞\\Rightarrow P\\in\\mathscr{C}. The desired result obtains by app1subscriptapp1\\textsc{app}_{1}. app2. We have a rule {ℙ1⇒P1,…​ℙn⇒Pn}⇒P∈ℬ⇒formulae-sequence⇒subscriptℙ1subscript𝑃1⇒…subscriptℙ𝑛subscript𝑃𝑛𝑃ℬ\\{\\mathbb{P}_{1}\\Rightarrow P_{1},\\ldots\\mathbb{P}_{n}\\Rightarrow P_{n}\\}\\Rightarrow P\\in\\mathscr{B} such that ℚ,ℙ,ℙi⊢ℬPi\\mathbb{Q},\\mathbb{P},\\mathbb{P}_{i}\\vdash_{\\mathscr{B}}P_{i} for i=1,…,n𝑖1…𝑛i=1,\\ldots,n. By the induction hypothesis, ℙ,ℙi⊢𝒞Pi\\mathbb{P},\\mathbb{P}_{i}\\vdash_{\\mathscr{C}}P_{i} for i=1,…,n𝑖1…𝑛i=1,\\ldots,n.\nSince 𝒞⊇𝔅ℬsubscriptsuperset-of-or-equals𝔅𝒞ℬ\\mathscr{C}\\supseteq_{\\mathfrak{B}}\\mathscr{B}, we have {ℙ1⇒P1,…,ℙn⇒Pn}⇒P∈𝒞⇒formulae-sequence⇒subscriptℙ1subscript𝑃1…⇒subscriptℙ𝑛subscript𝑃𝑛𝑃𝒞\\{\\mathbb{P}_{1}\\Rightarrow P_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbb{P}_{n}\\Rightarrow P_{n}\\}\\Rightarrow P\\in\\mathscr{C}. The desired result obtains by app2. This completes the induction. RHS ⟹⟹\\Longrightarrow LHS. Let 𝒞=ℬ∪{⇒Q∣Q∈ℚ}\\mathscr{C}=\\mathscr{B}\\cup\\{\\Rightarrow Q\\mid Q\\in\\mathbb{Q}\\}. Observe ⊢𝒞Q\\vdash_{\\mathscr{C}}Q for Q∈ℚ𝑄ℚQ\\in\\mathbb{Q} by app1. Hence, by RHS, infer ℙ⊢𝒞P\\mathbb{P}\\vdash_{\\mathscr{C}}P. To show LHS, we proceed by induction on how ℙ⊢𝒞P\\mathbb{P}\\vdash_{\\mathscr{C}}P obtains: ref. It must be that P∈ℙ𝑃ℙP\\in\\mathbb{P}. The desired result obtains immediately by ref. app1. It must be that ⇒P∈𝒞⇒absent𝑃𝒞\\Rightarrow P\\in\\mathscr{C}. Therefore, by definition of 𝒞𝒞\\mathscr{C}, either ⇒P∈ℬ⇒absent𝑃ℬ\\Rightarrow P\\in\\mathscr{B} or P∈ℚ𝑃ℚP\\in\\mathbb{Q}. In the first case, the desired result obtains by app1. In the second case, the desired result obtains by ref. app2. It must be that there is {ℙ1⇒P1,…,ℙn⇒Pn}⇒P∈𝒞⇒formulae-sequence⇒subscriptℙ1subscript𝑃1…⇒subscriptℙ𝑛subscript𝑃𝑛𝑃𝒞\\{\\mathbb{P}_{1}\\Rightarrow P_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbb{P}_{n}\\Rightarrow P_{n}\\}\\Rightarrow P\\in\\mathscr{C} such that ℙ,ℙi⊢𝒞Pi\\mathbb{P},\\mathbb{P}_{i}\\vdash_{\\mathscr{C}}P_{i} for i=1,…,n𝑖1…𝑛i=1,\\ldots,n. By the induction hypothesis, ℚ,ℙ,ℙi⊢ℬPi\\mathbb{Q},\\mathbb{P},\\mathbb{P}_{i}\\vdash_{\\mathscr{B}}P_{i} for i=1,…,n𝑖1…𝑛i=1,\\ldots,n. By pattern matching on the definition of 𝒞𝒞\\mathscr{C}, observe {ℙ1⇒P1,…,ℙn⇒Pn}⇒P∈ℬ⇒formulae-sequence⇒subscriptℙ1subscript𝑃1…⇒subscriptℙ𝑛subscript𝑃𝑛𝑃ℬ\\{\\mathbb{P}_{1}\\Rightarrow P_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbb{P}_{n}\\Rightarrow P_{n}\\}\\Rightarrow P\\in\\mathscr{B}. The desired result obtains by app2. This completes the induction. ∎ This completes the presentation of the B-eS for FOL.
