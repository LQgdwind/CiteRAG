      "content": "Paper Title: Few-Shot Continual Learning via Flat-to-Wide Approaches\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets: our numerical study is carried out using CIFAR100, miniImageNet and CUB-200-2011. The CIFAR100 and miniImageNet problems are configured such that 60 classes are reserved for the base task while the remaining 40 classes as the few-shot tasks under the 5-way 5-shots configuration, i.e., 5 classes are sampled where each class comprises 5 samples, thus leading to 8 few-shot tasks. For the CUB-200-2011 problem with 200 classes, the base task is built upon 100 classes while the few-shot tasks utilizes the remainder 100 classes with the 10-way 5-shot configuration, thus forming 10 few-shot tasks. In addition, we also evaluate consolidated algorithms in the case of small base tasks where only 20 classes are included in the miniimagenet and CIFAR100 problems while 50 classes are presented for the CUB problem. Numerical results under a 1-shot configuration are also reported here. Benchmark Algorithms: FLOWER is compared with 7 state-of-the-art algorithms: iCaRL [ref]26, Rebalance , FSLL , cRT , TOPIC [ref]4, EEIL  and F2M [ref]8. The baseline algorithm follows [ref]8 where the training process is only carried out in the base task while only exemplar constructions are done for few-shot tasks for a simple nearest class mean classification algorithm. A joint training is also included where the training process encompasses base classes and few-shot classes. Although the joint-training method commonly serves as the upper bound for the continual learning problems, it is not strong enough here because the extreme imbalance problem between the base task and the few-shot tasks exists in the few-shot continual learning problems. Here, the cRT is added as the additional upper bound because it performs long-tailed classification trained with all encountered data [ref]8. Numerical results of ICARL, Rebalance, EEIL, TOPIC, cRT and joint-training are taken from [ref]4 and [ref]8 while we run ICARL, Rebalance Baseline, F2M and FSLL in the same computational environments applying the implementation of [ref]8 with their best hyper-parameters found with the grid search. Experimental Details: our numerical study is executed under single NVIDIA A100 GPU with 40 GB memory across five runs. ResNet18 is adopted as the backbone network for all methods in the miniimagenet and CUB-200-2011 problems, while ResNet20 is implemented as a backbone network for all methods in the CIFAR100 problem. As with [ref]8, MùëÄM is set in between 2 to 4 and noise is injected to the last 4 or 8 convolutional layers while the flat region bound bùëèb is assigned as 0.01. Epoch per session is selected as 15 and the learning rate is assigned as 0.2 initially and truncated by 1e-6 after 5 epochs. Hyper-parameters of all methods are detailed in Table I.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: classes are presented for the CUB problem.
