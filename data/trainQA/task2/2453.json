      "content": "Paper Title: Playtesting: What is Beyond Personas\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn order to automate the playtesting, researchers proposed techniques to realize the decision model of a persona. Holmgård et al.  used a utility function to realize the decision model of a persona. This utility function is used as the reward function for the Q-Learning agent. The agents are exercised in an environment called MiniDungeons. The agents produced play traces as if they are of a specific persona. Holmgård et al.  extended their previous work by substituting the Q-Learning agents with a neural network. The inputs to the neural network were hard-coded, handpicked parameters. The authors used a genetic algorithm to find the weights of this neural network. They called their new method ‘evolved agent’. Evolved agent required less training than the Q-Learning agent and was able to generalize to other levels better. Holmgård et al.  upgraded the environment to MiniDungeons 2. In this study, the authors proposed to generate personas using MCTS agents that use their proposed utility function. Their reasoning for using MCTS, especially Vanilla MCTS , was to provide faster data to the game designer. In Q-Learning and Evolved agents, these agents have to be trained first. Holmgård et al.  extend the MCTS by improving the selection method of MCTS. In their previous study, the authors state that the Mini Dungeons 2 game was too complex for Vanilla MCTS. Therefore, they model a new selection phase that is specifically tailored towards a specific persona. They accomplish this by evolving the UCB formula by a genetic algorithm. The authors crafted the fitness function of each persona. This fitness function also determined the fitness function of the evolutionary algorithm. The evolved UCB formula improved their results among every persona. Silva et al. [ref]21 used personas to playtest the Ticket to Ride board game. The authors designed four different competitive personas to play the board game. The authors handcrafted a set of heuristics for each persona. They showed that personas revealed useful information that the game rules did not provide rules for two situations. Mugrai et al.  employed four different personas for Match-3 games. These personas are Max Score, Min Score, Max Moves, and Min Moves. The authors showed that these four personas could give the game designer valuable information about a level. The main drawback of persona research is the utility function. First, the utility function is static and stays constant throughout the game. Therefore, the game designers cannot model players with development sequences [ref]7. Second, depending on the level layout, personas can execute a similar sequence . Hence, the synthetic playtesters would provide ineffective feedback. Lastly, synthetic playtesters are realized using RL agents. Since RL agents optimize the total accumulated reward, synthetic playtesters would not test all playable paths.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: function of each persona. This fitness function also determined the fitness function of the evolutionary algorithm. The evolved UCB formula improved their results among every persona.
