      "content": "Paper Title: MERGE - A Bimodal Dataset For Static Music Emotion Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAutomatically classifying the predominant emotion in a musical piece has seen increasing interest, pushed mainly by the popularity of music streaming platforms and the necessity for organizing and recommending music to its users. The field of Music Emotion Recognition (MER) has, thus, seen several methodologies proposed to address this problem, although there are many differences regarding problem paradigms and employed data. To our knowledge, the first problem addressed in MER (in 2003 and yet to be solved) was a static single-label classification of audio samples by Feng et al. . By static, we mean the identification of the dominant single emotion, typically using samples with a uniform emotion (hereafter termed static MER), in contrast to the Music Emotion Variation Detection (MEVD) problem, where emotion fluctuations throughout songs are analyzed . Following Feng’s pioneering work, several approaches for static MER have been proposed  [ref]4  . However, current MER solutions can still not accurately solve fundamental problems such as static MER into a few emotion classes (e.g., four to five). Current results are still low (top at around 70 to 75% F1-score) and limited by a so-called “glass ceiling”  . Both existing studies support this  and the stagnation in the Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange (MIREX) Audio Mood Classification (AMC) task (a tentative benchmark in the field) . The best-performing method achieved 69.8% accuracy in a task comprising five categories. Moreover, this score has remained stable for several years, which calls for ways to help break this glass ceiling. In previous works, we demonstrated this glass ceiling to be partly due to two core problems 0 : i) absence of public, sizeable, and quality datasets; ii) and the lack of emotionally relevant features. This paper focuses on contributions to the first problem, i.e., the creation of MER datasets. In this respect, tentative benchmarks were previously proposed in the context of MER challenges. Examples of this are the abovementioned MIREX AMC dataset (for static MER) and later the DEAM dataset 1 (more focused on MEVD), resulting from the successive benchmarks for the 2013, 2014, and 2015 MediaEval’s Emotion in Music tasks. However, these datasets, as well as other MER datasets created over the years, suffer from several limitations, e.g., the inadequacy of emotion taxonomies, emotion classes with acoustic and semantic overlap, low-quality annotations, limited size or noise, and poor handling of emotion subjectivity [ref]4 . Hence, no public, sizeable, widely accepted, and adequately validated benchmarks exist. Another critical point in the development of MER datasets is the available modalities. Despite some contributions to the creation of bimodal datasets [ref]4, most current datasets only provide annotations for audio clips and exclude contextual information, most notably lyrics. While audio can accurately predict arousal, the same cannot be said for valence. It is valence that lyrics considerably outperform audio-only modalities 2 3. Considering this, training a classifier based on a bimodal paradigm consisting of audio clips with corresponding lyrics can, in theory, significantly improve MER systems. In this paper, we propose new audio, lyrics, and bimodal static MER datasets, collectively called MERGE, annotated according to emotion perception  based on Russell’s four emotion quadrants 4. We created these datasets following a semi-automatic protocol that considerably accelerates the annotation stage while promoting annotation quality. The new MERGE audio and lyrics datasets are significantly larger than previous efforts by our team  0. MERGE audio-lyrics (the main contribution of this work) is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest publicly available bimodal MER dataset. In addition, we performed an experimental validation of the proposed datasets using state-of-the-art classical Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methodologies. The attained results and analysis confirm the viability of the proposed datasets for benchmarking further MER studies. The best-performing model (a bimodal neural network combining audio and lyrics) attained an F1-score of 79.21%. The document is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant background and related work regarding publicly available audio, lyrics, and bimodal MER datasets and systems. Section 3 presents the proposed semi-automatic creation protocol, generation of Train-Validation-Test (TVT) splits, and contents of each dataset. Section 4 describes the methodologies, pre-processing steps, and optimization strategies followed for evaluating the proposed datasets and establishing a baseline for benchmarking. The attained results and gathered insights are discussed in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 draws this study’s main conclusions and final thoughts.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Music Emotion Variation Detection (MEVD) problem, where emotion fluctuations throughout songs are analyzed .
