Clearly, if all but finitely many slices of ΦΦ\\Phi are trivial (we also say k𝑘k-trivial) in the sense that they are empty or contain all k𝑘k-vertex graphs, then #​ParIndSub​(Φ)#ParIndSubΦ\\#\\textnormal{{ParIndSub}}(\\Phi) is easy to compute. Such properties ΦΦ\\Phi are called meager.\nFor all other properties, the following was conjectured. For every computable and non-meager property ΦΦ\\Phi, the parameterized problem #​ParIndSub​(Φ)#ParIndSubΦ\\#\\textnormal{{ParIndSub}}(\\Phi) is #W-hard. In the last decade, this conjecture has been verified for several special classes of non-meager properties ΦΦ\\Phi. Below, we list a set of maximal results subsuming most of the known results in the area, see also [16, Section 1.1].\nWhen we say that ETH rules out an exponent of o​(f​(k))𝑜𝑓𝑘o(f(k)), we mean that an algorithm with running time no​(f​(k))superscript𝑛𝑜𝑓𝑘n^{o(f(k))} for #​ParIndSub​(Φ)#ParIndSubΦ\\#\\textnormal{{ParIndSub}}(\\Phi) would refute ETH. Even stronger, ETH implies a constant α>0𝛼0\\alpha>0 such that #​IndSub​(Φ(k)→G)#IndSub→superscriptΦ𝑘𝐺\\#\\mathrm{IndSub}(\\Phi^{(k)}\\to G) cannot be computed in time O​(nα⋅f​(k))𝑂superscript𝑛⋅𝛼𝑓𝑘O(n^{\\alpha\\cdot f(k)}) on n𝑛n-vertex graphs, for an infinite set of integers k𝑘k. If ΦΦ\\Phi is closed under deleting edges (edge-monotone) 6 or closed under deleting vertices (hereditary) [ref]20, then #​ParIndSub​(Φ)#ParIndSubΦ\\#\\textnormal{{ParIndSub}}(\\Phi) is #W-hard. This strengthens an earlier result that required ΦΦ\\Phi to satisfy both closure properties .\nIt is also shown that ETH rules out an exponent of o​(log⁡k/log⁡log⁡k)𝑜𝑘𝑘o(\\sqrt{\\log k}/\\log\\log k) for edge-monotone properties, and an exponent of o​(k)𝑜𝑘o(k) for hereditary properties. Given k∈ℕ𝑘ℕk\\in{\\mathbb{N}}, set βΦ​(k)=0subscript𝛽Φ𝑘0\\beta_{\\Phi}(k)=0 if no k𝑘k-vertex graph satisfies ΦΦ\\Phi.\nOtherwise, let βΦ​(k)subscript𝛽Φ𝑘\\beta_{\\Phi}(k) be the number of edge-counts avoided by ΦΦ\\Phi on k𝑘k-vertex graphs, i.e., the number of integers ℓℓ\\ell such that no graph H𝐻H with k𝑘k vertices and ℓℓ\\ell edges satisfies ΦΦ\\Phi.\nIf βΦ​(k)∈ω​(k)subscript𝛽Φ𝑘𝜔𝑘\\beta_{\\Phi}(k)\\in\\omega(k), then #​ParIndSub​(Φ)#ParIndSubΦ\\#\\textnormal{{ParIndSub}}(\\Phi) is #W-hard .\nMoreover, ETH rules out an exponent of o​(βΦ​(k)/log⁡βΦ​(k))𝑜subscript𝛽Φ𝑘subscript𝛽Φ𝑘o(\\beta_{\\Phi}(k)/\\sqrt{\\log\\beta_{\\Phi}(k)}). If ΦΦ\\Phi depends only on the number of edges of the input graph, then #​ParIndSub​(Φ)#ParIndSubΦ\\#\\textnormal{{ParIndSub}}(\\Phi) is #W-hard and ETH rules out an exponent of o​(k/log⁡k)𝑜𝑘𝑘o(k/\\sqrt{\\log k}) . If there are infinitely many prime powers t𝑡t such that ΦΦ\\Phi holds for exactly one of Kt,tsubscript𝐾𝑡𝑡K_{t,t} or I2​tsubscript𝐼2𝑡I_{2t}, then #​ParIndSub​(Φ)#ParIndSubΦ\\#\\textnormal{{ParIndSub}}(\\Phi) is #W-hard and ETH rules out an exponent of o​(k)𝑜𝑘o(k) 5. In this paper, we strengthen all but the last111In fact, our proofs in Section 5.2 implicitly also subsume and extend this last hardness result. of the above hardness results in several ways, e.g., by proving hardness for a larger collection of properties, by proving hardness even for modular counting variants, by proving tighter lower bounds under ETH, or by showing that the problems remain hard even when weights are incorporated into ΦΦ\\Phi.\nHowever, we consider the main contribution of our paper to be the introduction of Fourier analysis techniques to the study of #​ParIndSub​(Φ)#ParIndSubΦ\\#\\textnormal{{ParIndSub}}(\\Phi). Indeed, the well-established toolkit of Fourier analysis allows us to derive many of the above results as relatively straightforward consequences of known results or even exercises in textbooks .\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: f(k)}) on n𝑛n-vertex graphs, for an infinite set of integers k𝑘k.
