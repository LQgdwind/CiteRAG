Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: HGV4Risk: Hierarchical Global View-guided Sequence Representation Learning for Risk Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare our proposed HGV with both traditional  , time-aware [ref]16 [ref]18, attention-based [ref]11     and knowledge-enhanced  baselines. Noted, in order to ensure the fairness of the comparison, we quote the reported results or reproduced results for each baseline from their original literature or open-source implementations and all the reproduced ones have been fine-tuned by grid-searching strategy. LR :\nIt is a classic logistic regression model. We use a more elaborate version of the hand-engineered features given in benchmark pipelines . GBDT :\nIt is also a classic tree-based ensemble learning method. The hand-engineered features used are the same as the LR baseline. Attn-GRU [ref]11:\nIt is an attention-based model, where we add the plain attention to a multichannel GRU. RETAIN [ref]16:\nIt is a well-known attention-based model, which can explore both temporal relationships and variable significance by using two-level neural attention model. T-LSTM [ref]18:\nIt is a time-aware model, it can handle data with time irregularities. In this paper, it is modified into a supervised learning model. MCA-RNN :\nIt is an attention-based model, which utilize an attention-based RNN and a conditional deep generative model for capturing the heterogeneity in time series data. Transformer :\nIt is a well-known baseline self-attention based model. A flatten layer and FFNs in the final step are used to make the risk prediction. SAnD :\nIt is a self-attention based model, which applies a masked, self-attention mechanism, and uses positional encoding and dense interpolation strategies for incorporating temporal order. ConCare :\nIt is one of the state-of-the-art models in risk prediction task, which combine a new time-aware attention and multi-head self-attention networks with a cross-head decorrelation loss. GRASP :\nIt is a knowledge-enhanced predictor, which extracts a k-nearest neighbor graph clustering from similar samples, and then enhances the performance by introducing cluster centers embedding learned by GCNs . Noted, we use the reported SOTA backbone, GRASP+ConCare, as the baseline.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: We compare our proposed HGV with both traditional  , time-aware [ref]16 [ref]18, attention-based [ref]11     and knowledge-enhanced  baselines.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
