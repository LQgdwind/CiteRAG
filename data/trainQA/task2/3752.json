      "content": "Paper Title: Transfer Attacks Revisited: A Large-Scale Empirical Study in Real Computer Vision Settings\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn total, we employ nine representative adversarial attacks.\nAmong them there are two targeted algorithms, BL-BFGS (simplified as BLB) [ref]44 and CW2 .\nBLB and CW2 generate AEs by solving the corresponding optimization problem\nusing iterative methods. Adversarial perturbations generated by them are optimized in size and thus by nature small.\nApart from these targeted algorithms, we employ six untargeted adversarial algorithms as well. DeepFool  is the only untargeted algorithm that optimize the perturbation size, realized by approximating the decision boundary. A generalized version of DeepFool is the UAP algorithm [ref]31, adding image-level adversarial perturbations given by DeepFool together to obtain a universal adversarial perturbation. Algorithms remained are built upon another idea that AEs should be generated with Lpsubscript𝐿𝑝L_{p} norm of perturbation less than a predetermined norm budget. The\nroot algorithm is FGSM [ref]19 which perturbs the\noriginal image for once along the opposite direction of the gradient,\n\\ie, x^=x−ϵ⋅sign(∇loss(fθ(x);c)\\hat{x}=x-\\epsilon\\cdot sign(\\nabla loss(f_{\\theta}(x);c), where\nl​o​s​s​(fθ​(x);c)𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠subscript𝑓𝜃𝑥𝑐loss(f_{\\theta}(x);c) is the loss function between the model prediction and the\nground truth, s​i​g​n​(⋅)𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛⋅sign(\\cdot) denotes the sign function and ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon denotes the perturbation budget. FGSM has its improved version\nRFGSM  which adds a random perturbation to the image\nbefore imposing gradient-based perturbation. This preprocessing is claimed to\npenetrate the defense of gradient masking. In addition, FGSM has an iterative\ncounterpart PGD  which executes the FGSM step iteratively\nfor predetermined times. Another\nvariation of FGSM called Step-LLC and its iterative counterpart\nLLC  minimize the loss w.r.t. the\nleast likely class rather than maximize the loss w.r.t. the correct class. The perturbing process then\nbecomes x^=x+ϵ⋅sign(∇loss(fθ(x);c∗)\\hat{x}=x+\\epsilon\\cdot sign(\\nabla loss(f_{\\theta}(x);c^{*}), where\nc∗superscript𝑐c^{*} denotes the class the model predicts with the least confidence. These attacks have Lpsubscript𝐿𝑝L_{p} norm of adversarial perturbation less than or equal to the budget. We use L∞subscript𝐿L_{\\infty} norm in the paper. For algorithm implementations, we employ the codes from the open source framework DEEPSEC .\nWe select ten independent classes from the ImageNet and randomly sampled 20 images for each class as the seed image.\nFor gender classification, we randomly select 200 original images as the seed image, half male and half female. The combinations of surrogate settings and attack algorithms form 180 different settings in total for our evaluation.\nUnder each setting, AEs are generated on the same set of seed images and sent to the target platform. Then metrics are computed based on the responses.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: In total, we employ nine representative adversarial attacks.\nAmong them there are two targeted algorithms, BL-BFGS (simplified as BLB) [ref]44 and CW2 .\nBLB and CW2 generate AEs by solving the corresponding optimization problem\nusing iterative methods.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
