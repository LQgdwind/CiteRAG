      "content": "Paper Title: Content-aware Masked Image Modeling Transformer for Stereo Image Compression\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCompression performance.\nFig. 4 shows the RD curves of these methods on Cityscapes and InStereo2K datasets. We also report BD-rate, BD-PSNR and BD-MSSSIM scores of each codec relative to BPG in Table 1. It is observed that the single image codec ELIC [ref]23 achieves 25.196% and 29.748% bitrate saving in terms of PSNR on Cityscapes and InStereo2K datasets. By contrast, our CAMSIC has larger improvements, i.e., 41.961% and 43.608%. This demonstrates that introducing a stereo conditional entropy model to capture the correlations between stereo images effectively enables a more accurate estimation of the probability distribution. Without manually designed and complex linear or nonlinear transformations, our method outperforms most of these compression baselines, highlighting the importance of a powerful spatial-disparity entropy model. Specifically, a series of unidirectional codecs (HEVC , VVC , MV-HEVC , DispSIC [ref]49, SASIC ) necessitate explicit warping to remove disparity redundancies. Notably, our CAMSIC surpasses VVC, the best unidirectional codec, across all bits per pixel (bpp) ranges on the InStereo2K and Cityscapes dataset. In addition, bidirectional codecs (BCSIC , ECSIC [ref]44) adopt bidirectional attention to reduce inter-view redundancies. Remarkably, even with a straightforward image encoder-decoder architecture, our CAMSIC still saves 8.512% and 0.629% bits over the SOTA method ECSIC in terms of PSNR on Cityscapes and InStereo2K datasets, respectively. Moreover, compared with the latest distributed codec LDMIC that adopts the joint decoding method based on global cross-attention mechanism, our proposed method improves by about 0.387dB and 0.195dB PSNR at the same bpp level on two datasets (Cityscapes and InStereo2K). These results affirm the superiority of our proposed entropy model in exploiting data correlations for enhancing compression performance. Fig. 5 presents a subjective comparison of our proposed method against BCSIC, LDMIC, and ECSIC on two stereo image pairs from the Cityscapes dataset, where our method effectively restores the image details and exhibits superior reconstruction quality while consuming lower bits. Additional subjective comparisons for samples from both the Cityscapes and InStereo2K datasets are available in the supplementary material. Coding Complexity.\nWe compare the computation complexity of six learning-based multi-view and stereo codecs on InStereo2K dataset. The running time on GPU includes the execution latency of entropy coder. As illustrated in Fig. 6, our CAMSIC method is orders of magnitude faster than other auto-regressive approaches (DispSIC [ref]49, BCSIC  and LDMIC ) by leveraging the parallel coding advantages of the MIM technique. Furthermore, by simplifying the stereo image encoding and decoding processes, our approach runs faster than SASIC  and ECSIC [ref]44. These results showcase a better trade-off between performance and speed among contemporary learning-based codecs.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: of these methods on Cityscapes and InStereo2K datasets.
