      "content": "Paper Title: Skeleton-DML: Deep Metric Learning for Skeleton-Based One-Shot Action Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo support the effectiveness of our proposed representation in a metric learning setting we compare against other skeleton-based image representations. We use the publicly avail able implementation for the SkeleMotion [ref]1, SL-DML [ref]18, Gimme Signals  and re-implementations of the TSSI  and Skepxels  representations to integrate them into our metric learning approach. These representations have been described in\nSection II more detailed. The overall training procedure was identical as all models were trained with the parameters described in Section III-E. The experiment only differed in the underlying representation. Results for the representation comparison are given in Table IV.\nWhile most of the representations initially target action recognition and are not optimized for one-shot action recognition, they are still good candidates for integration in our metric learning approach.\nWe did not re-implement the individual architecture proposed by the different representations but decided to use the Resnet18 architecture for better comparability. Our Skeleton-DML approach shows best performance followed by SL-DML. The SkeleMotion Magnitude [ref]1 representation transfers well from an action recognition setting to a one-shot action recognition setting. Interesting to note is that the SkeleMotion Orientation [ref]1 representation, while achieving comparable results in the standard action recognition protocol, performs 10% worse than the same representation encoding the magnitude of the skeleton joints.\nAn early fusion of Magnitude and Orientation on a representation level did not improve the Skelemotion representation but yields a result in between both representations. Similar observations have been made in [ref]18 by the fusion of inertial and skeleton sequences. The lower performing modality adds uncertainty to the resulting model in our one-shot setting. A UMAP embedding of all evaluation samples is shown in Fig. 8 for our Skeleton-DML approach.\nOur approach shows better capabilities in distinguishing the actions throw and arm circles. In our approach those clusters can be separated quite well whereas SL-DML struggles to discriminate those two classes.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: of our proposed representation in a metric learning setting we compare against other skeleton-based image representations. We use the publicly avail able implementation for the SkeleMotion [ref]1, SL-DML [ref]18, Gimme Signals  and re-implementations of the TSSI  and Skepxels  representations to integrate them into our metric learning approach. These representations have been described\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
