      "content": "Paper Title: Discriminative Residual Analysis for Image Set Classification with Posture and Age Variations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFour benchmark datasets are used in the experiments, and they are briefly included as follows. Some illustrative examples are shown in Fig. 4. LFW :\nThe alignment version LFW-a [ref]43 is used for evaluation here. Following the same setting in Ref. , all images have been cropped into 90×78907890\\times 78 by removing 88 pixels from top, 72 pixels from bottom, and 86 pixel margins from both left and right sides. Then the categories with more than 20 pictures are selected as the subset of LFW-a. Therefore, there are 3032 images of 62 individuals. Large Age-Gap: The Large Age-Gap (LAG) database  is constructed with 3828 images of 1010 individuals. The people’s ages range from 0 to 80 years old and images of teenagers show great difference in appearance, both of these two points make the age gap in LAG database inconceivably large. To build the image set classification task, two schemes are designed. Scheme 1 contains 572 images of 50 persons, each person has no less than 10 images. Scheme 2 contains 1665 images of 215 persons, each person has no less than 6 images. AgeDB: AgeDB  is a widely used age in-the-wild dataset which is proposed recently. All 16488 images of 567 celebrities are processed manually, thus the age labels are clean which makes AgeDB different from previous age database. Moreover, the images in AgeDB are totally in-the-wild and are collected from uncontrolled, real-world conditions. Thus, it is challenging to recognize faces with such huge variation in age and conditions. Similarly, 73 individuals having more than 40 images are selected here. In order to better understand how age affects the recognition performance, two schemes are designed and will be detailed later. Caltech101: Caltech101 is a challenging objection recognition database contains over 9000 images for 102 categories . Each category contains about 31 to 800 images and represents an object or background, such as butterfly, camera, watch, google background, etc. The original image size of Caltech101 is 300×200300200300\\times 200. Caltech256: Caltech256 [ref]46 is the extension Caltech101. It consists of 30608 images from 256 object categories and clutter. Each category contains at least 80 images. Compared with Caltech101, there is no left-right alignment and artifact, which makes this task harder. Two kinds of deep neural network (DNN) , i.e., Residual Networks  and Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks [ref]47, are employed to learn deep features of face and object respectively. Compared with traditional hand-crafted features, DNN learns the powerful deep feature automatically and maps the raw data to a space where features are more separable  [ref]47 . For these two DNNs, the deep features are extracted from the penultimate layer. The feature dimensions of both DNNs are 2048. Since the input size of both two DNNs are 224×\\times224, all images are resized to fit it. General information of the datasets and features are shown in Tab. I. The network architectures are briefly summarized here. VggFace2-ResNet-50: To capture the facial feature, the VggFace2 pretrained version of ResNet-50 is selected here. This model has been trained on the large-scale face database with more than 3.3 million images called VggFace2111http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/vgg_face2/ . SE-ResNeXt-50: Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks is the champion of ILSVRC 2017 Image Classification Challenge [ref]47. One of the proposed templates named SE-ResNeXt-50222https://github.com/hujie-frank/SENet are used for object feature extraction.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: Four benchmark datasets are used in the experiments, and they are briefly included as follows. Some illustrative examples are shown in Fig. 4. LFW :\nThe alignment version LFW-a [ref]43 is used for evaluation here.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
