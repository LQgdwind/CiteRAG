      "content": "Paper Title: From Copilot to Pilot: Towards AI Supported Software Development\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nProgramming is a powerful and ubiquitous problem-solving tool. Developing systems that can assist software developers or even generate programs independently could make programming more productive and accessible .\nWith increasing pressure on software developers to produce code quickly, there is considerable interest in tools and techniques for improving productivity [ref]2.\nCode completion is one such feature that predicts what a software developer tries to code and offers predictions as suggestions to the user . All modern IDEs feature intelligent code completion tools in different forms that are used by both new and experienced software developers . Developing AI systems that can effectively model and understand code can transform these code completion tools and how we interact with them . In recent years, there have been considerable improvements in the field of AI-supported code completion tools.\nCopilot [ref]5, an in-IDE recommender system that leverages OpenAI’s Codex neural language model (NLM) [ref]6 which uses a GPT-3 model  has been at the forefront and is particularly impressive in understanding the context and semantics of code with just a few lines of comments or code as input and can suggest the next few lines or even entire functions in some cases [ref]6.\nHowever, software development is much more than writing code. It involves complex challenges like following the best practices, avoiding code smells, using design patterns, and many more decisions before writing code. The biggest challenge with using tools like Copilot is their training data.\nThese tools are trained on existing software source code, and training costs are expensive.\nSeveral classes of errors like securuty vlunerabilities , license compliance and copyright violation , and also simple coding mistakes, such as not allowing for an empty array in a sort routine111all examples are documented in our replication package 0. have been discovered, which follow from the presence of these same errors in public (training) data.\nAlthough these are clearly challenges, Copilot seems already to be on its way to fixing them, like a filter introduced by GitHub to suppress code suggestions containing code that matches public code on GitHub.\nHowever, what is more difficult to envision are the problems that are harder to fix because straightforward corrections may not exist, and rules for finding problems are more challenging to specify than those in smell detectors or linters 1 like language idioms and code smells. Developers often discuss software architecture and actual source code implementations in online forums, chat rooms, mailing lists, or in person.\nProgramming tasks can be solved in more than one way.\nThe best way to proceed can be determined based on case-specific conditions, limits, and conventions. Strong standards and a shared vocabulary make communication easier while fostering a shared understanding of the issues and solutions related to software development.\nHowever, this takes time and experience to learn and use idiomatic approaches 2. AI-supported code completion tools can help steer users into using more idiomatic approaches with its code suggestions or vice-versa.\nThis makes it crucial to find the boundaries of AI-supported code completion tools like Copilot and create a clear understanding of where can we use AI-supported code completion tools like Copilot and where should the user be vigilant in using AI-supported code completion tools code suggestions.\nDelineating where AI-supported code completion tools are currently best able to perform, and where more complex software development tasks overwhelm them helps answer questions like exactly which software problems can current AI-supported code completion tools solve?\nIf AI-supported code completion tools make a suggestion, is that suggestion accurate and optimal? Should a user intervene to correct it? This study aims to understand the areas where Copilot performs better than a human and where Copilot performs worse than a human.\nWe conduct an exploratory study with the following research objectives: RQ-1: \nWhat are the current boundaries of AI-supported code completion tools?\nWe use GitHub’s Copilot as a representative for current AI-supported code completion tools. We explore Copilot’s code suggestions for code smells and usage of Pythonic idioms. We conduct additional investigation to determine the current boundaries of Copilot by introducing a taxonomy of software abstraction hierarchies where ‘basic programming functionality’ such as code compilation and syntax checking is at the least abstract level. Software architecture analysis and design are at the most abstract level. RQ-1.1: \nHow do AI-supported code completion tools manage programming idioms?\nWe investigate Copilot code suggestions on the top 25 Pythonic idioms used in open source projects. These Pythonic idioms are sampled from the work of Alexandru et al. 2 and Farook et al. 3, which identified Pythonic idioms from presentations given by renowned Python developers. We investigate how Copilot’s top code suggestion compares to Python idioms from Alexandru et al. 2 and Farook et al. 3. In addition, we report if the Pythonic idiom is listed in any of the ten viewable suggestions from Copilot. RQ-1.2: \nHow do AI-supported code completion tools manage manage to suggest non-smelly code?\nWe investigate Copilot code suggestions on 25 different best practices in JavaScript. We sampled best practices from the AirBNB JavaScript coding style guide 4. We explore how Copilot’s top code suggestion compares to the best practices recommended in the AirBNB JavaScript coding style guide 4. Additionally, we report if the best practice is listed in any of the ten viewable suggestions from Copilot.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: more productive and accessible .\nWith increasing pressure on software developers to produce code quickly, there is considerable interest in tools and techniques for improving productivity [ref]2.\nCode completion is one such feature that predicts what a software developer tries to code and offers predictions as suggestions to the user .
