      "content": "Paper Title: Saliency-Aware Regularized Graph Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTraditional approaches to graph classification, preceding the popularity of graph neural networks, typically employ graph kernel functions to measure the similarity between pairs of graphs   [ref]19. Our SAR-GNN is built upon graph neural networks and is designed to: 1) regularize the neighborhood aggregation of graph neural networks and 2) learn effective representation for the entire graph. Thus, we discuss related work to our method from these two perspectives below. Neighborhood aggregation of Graph Neural Networks.\nThe core idea shared across various graph neural networks is to perform neighborhood aggregation for each graph node to refine the node features iteratively 0 .\nTypical convolutional neural networks  are successfully adapted to graph data either in the spectral domain  4 or spatial domain  5. In particular, GCN  presents a scalable and efficient implementation of graph convolution. GraphSAGE  explores multiple potential aggregating functions while Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN)  builds upon GraphSAGE and presents a framework which is as theoretically powerful as the Weisfeiler- Lehman graph isomorphism test . Another research line of modeling neighborhood aggregation is to learn the aggregating weights directly per edge around the center node. Edge-Conditioned Convolution (ECC)  learns aggregating weights conditioned on edge labels while GAT  employs an attention mechanism to measure compatibility between neighboring nodes for each edge. All aforementioned methods focus on modeling the local dependencies between neighboring nodes when performing feature aggregation whilst the relevance of each node to the task of graph classification is ignored. While the node saliency can be modeled by the attention mechanism roughly, as ChebyGIN  and SAGPool  do, this type of methods has limited effectiveness in that it solely relies on the attention model without explicit modeling of saliency.\nBesides, the global node saliency has been also modeled based on 1) node degrees by Graphormer , or 2) the connectivities between nodes by DGM , or 3) the graph convolution output by DGCNN . Nevertheless, all these methods do not explicitly model the saliency yet, namely the semantic similarties between each node and the global graph representation. In contrast, our SAR-GNN measures the node saliency by modeling the compatibility between the learned graph representation and the node features. The learned node saliency is then leveraged to regularize the modeling of neighborhood aggregation. Representation learning for the entire graph. Most of the existing methods for graph classification learn the representation for the entire graph in an indirect manner: they allocate most of the model capacity to learning effective node features, and obtain the representation for the entire graph by simply aggregating node features via a readout function, mostly implemented as a variety of pooling functions. Typical examples include DiffPool  which designs an adaptive pooling method that collapses nodes hierarchically, ECC which pre-calculates a pooling map to coarsen graphs, DGCNN  that sorts nodes first using SortPool before pooling, EigenPooling  which is proposed based on graph Fourier transform to preserve graph structure during pooling, Graph U-Nets  which performs top-K pooling scheme, and SAGPool  which identifies the important nodes using the self-attention mechanism 6. On the other hand, ESAN 7 represents a large graph as a set of distinguishable subgraphs based on the predefined policy. Unlike aforementioned prior work, we design a module termed as Graph Neural Memory specifically to distill a compact graph representation from node features progressively using a cross-attention mechanism. In particular, the compact graph representation and the node features are refined by two modules interdependently. Although our model is mainly designed for effective graph representation learning, another potentially advantageous application of it, which is worth noting, is that the derived node saliency distribution by our SAR-GNN can be naturally used for interpretable explanation of GNN predictions. In this sense, our model is essentially consistent with GNNExplainer 8 which identifies compact subgraphs crucial for GNN’s predictions for interpretation, as well as PGExplainer 9 that is a generalizable GNN explainer by parameterizing the generation process of explanations.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: Traditional approaches to graph classification, preceding the popularity of graph neural networks, typically employ graph kernel functions to measure the similarity between pairs of graphs   [ref]19.
