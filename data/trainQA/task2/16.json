      "content": "Paper Title: Entangled Polynomial Codes for Secure, Private, and Batch Distributed Matrix Multiplication: Breaking the “Cubic” Barrier\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLarge scale distributed computing faces several modern challenges, in particular, to provide resiliency against stragglers, robustness against computing errors, security against Byzantine and eavesdropping adversaries, privacy of sensitive information, and to efficiently handle repetitive computation      [ref]6 . Coded computing is an emerging field that resolves these issues by introducing and developing new coding theoretic concepts, started focusing on straggler mitigation   0, then later extended to secure and private computation 1 2 [ref]6 3 4 . Coding for straggler mitigation is first studied in  for linear computation, where classical linear codes can be directly applied to achieve same performances. For computation beyond linear functions, new classes of coding designs are needed to achieve optimality.\nIn 0, we studied matrix-by-matrix multiplication and introduced the polynomial coded computing (PCC) framework. The main idea is to jointly encode the input variables into single variate polynomials where the coefficients are functions of the inputs. By assigning each worker evaluations of these polynomials as coded variables, they\nessentially evaluate a new polynomial composed by each worker’s computation and the encoding functions at the same point. As long as the needed final results can be recovered from the coefficients of the composed polynomial, the master can decode the final output when sufficiently many workers complete their computation. PCC significantly reduces the design problem of coded computation to finding polynomials satisfying the above decodability constraint while minimizing the degree of the decomposed polynomial. It has been shown that PCC achieves a great success in providing exact optimal coding constructions for large classes of computation tasks including: pair-wise product 0, convolution 0 5, inner product 6 5, element-wise product 5, and general batch multivariate-polynomial evaluation [ref]6. An important problem in distributed matrix multiplication is to consider the case where the inputs are encoded and multiplied in a block-wise manner. This setup generalizes the problem formulated in 0 to enable a more flexible tradeoff between resources such as storage, computation and communication, and has been studied in 5 6 7 8 9 0 1. For straggler mitigation, the state of the art is achieved by two versions of the entangled polynomial code, both first presented in 5, which characterizes the optimum recovery threshold within a factor of 222. For brevity, we refer the collection of them as entangled polynomial codes.\nOne significance of entangled polynomial codes is that it maps non-straggler-mitigating linear coded computing schemes to bilinear-complexity decompositions, which bridges the areas of fast matrix multiplication and coded computation, enables utilizing techniques developed in the rich literature (e.g., 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1).\nMoreover, this connection reduces block-wise matrix multiplication to computing element-wise products, for which we developed the optimal strategy for straggler mitigation. The coding gain achieve by entangled polynomial codes extended to fault-tolerant computing 2 and it is shown in [ref]6 that security against Byzantine adversaries can also be provided the same way. The goal of this paper is to extend entangled polynomial codes to three main problems: secure, private, and batch distributed matrix multiplication. In secure distributed matrix multiplication 1 2 3 4 9 7 3 5 4 6 7 8 9 8 0, the goal is to compute a single matrix product while preserving the privacy of input matrices against eavesdropping adversaries; in private distributed matrix multiplication 3 4 8 1, the goal is to multiply a single pair from two lists of matrices while keeping the request (indices) private; batch distributed matrix multiplication 8 0 1 considers a scenario where more than one pair of matrices are to be multiplied. There are recent works on each of these problems that considered general block-wise partitioning of input matrices 7 8 9 0 1. However, all results presented in prior works are limited by a “cubic” barrier. Explicitly, when the input matrices to be multiplied are partitioned into m𝑚m-by-p𝑝p and p𝑝p-by-n𝑛n subblocks, all state of the arts require the workers computing at least p​m​n𝑝𝑚𝑛pmn products of coded submatrices per each multiplication task. We demonstrate how entangled polynomial codes can be extended to break the cubic barrier in all three problems. We show that the coding ideas of entangled polynomial codes and PCC can be applied to provide unified solutions with needed security and privacy, as well as efficiently handling batch evaluation.\nMoreover, we achieve order-wise improvements upon state-of-the-art designs with explicit coding constructions.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: stragglers, robustness against computing errors, security against Byzantine and eavesdropping adversaries, privacy of sensitive information, and to efficiently handle repetitive computation      [ref]6 .
