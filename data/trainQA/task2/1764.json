      "content": "Paper Title: Large Pre-trained Language Models Contain Human-like Biases of What is Right and Wrong to Do\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLarge-scale LMs such as GPT-2/3 are trained on mostly unfiltered data, increasing the risk of adapting biases and hate from these data sources. This propagates to downstream tasks. Our observations indicate that the moral direction of LMs is not unaffected by the social biases reflected in the training data. Here, we utilise BERT’s MoralDirection, which we evaluated based on the collected data from our conducted user studies.\nWith the conducted global user study, we aimed to reach a diverse group of participants from various regions in order to collect a broad view on moral directions and social expectations. However, we were limited to the crowd-sourcing platform’s user base. In the present study, we aim at investigating to which extend PLMs contain human-like biases of what is right and wrong to do, which surface from the (unknown) group of people that have generated the data.\nBased on the achieved state-of-the-art results reported in the original BERT paper [ref]1, the authors state that “unsupervised pre-training is an integral part of many language understanding systems.”.\nHowever, critics were raised  that no actual language understanding is taking place in LM-driven approaches to e.g. Question-Answering tasks.\nTherefore it is important to note that, we do not aim to show that PLMs are able to “understand” morality. Importantly, they do not offer a view on what is actually right or wrong and, hence, should not be used to give actual advice. Nevertheless, training LMs with supervision on what is right or wrong and investigating their limitations is an interesting direction for future work. Furthermore, transferring and investigating the MoralDirection of other (masked) LMs as well as autoregressive models is an interesting avenue for future work. Our work mainly focuses on the masked language model BERT, more precisely BERT-large, since it was proved to capture accurate relational, factual, and commonsense knowledge . Although our approach follows the long tradition of using the Euclidean geometry to investigate the embedding space of transformers, see e.g. , there is no strict evidence it should actually be Euclidean. Investigating hyperbolic probing [ref]59 and PCA for hyperbolic spaces [ref]60 is an interesting avenue for future work that may improve the the approaches even further. Our results on reducing toxic degeneration in LMs show that it outperforms other approaches like DAPT and PPLM. This demonstrates that the MoralDirection is indeed an excellent choice to rate text and adapt language models producing it.\nHowever, the underlying language model BERT is not unaffected of inheriting biases from text source  . The MoralDirection as a downstream task is also affected by the encoded biases in BERT’s language representations. Further, it is somewhat questionable if the rating system itself used to measure the generative language models’ toxicity is actually unaffected.\nMoreover, we observed that BERT is in some cases facing issues processing semantics, e.g. handling negations. Semantic-BERT  or an extension by logic programming modelling moral reasoning   could be applied in the future.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: of what is right and wrong to do, which surface from the (unknown) group of people that have generated the data.\nBased on the achieved state-of-the-art results reported in the original BERT paper [ref]1, the authors state that “unsupervised pre-training is an integral part of many language understanding systems.”.\nHowever, critics were raised  that no actual language understanding is taking\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
