      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Combinatorial Optimization: a New Player in the Field\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCombinatorial optimization deals with problems with an objective function that has to be maximized over a set of combinatorial alternatives . The most naive way of obtaining the optimal solution is to list all the feasible solutions, evaluating them using the objective function and selecting the optimal one. Nevertheless, a brute-force approach lacks practicality when the size of the problem is too large, as the time needed to solve it grows exponentially with the problem size. Combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) have been traditionally approached either by exact methods or heuristic methods. Exact methods guarantee an optimal solution but, as their algorithmic complexity is high, exact approaches become useless for medium to large problem sizes. Conversely, heuristic methods do not guarantee to reach the optimal solution, but they try to reach a good solution in a reasonable time budget. The effectiveness of a heuristic method depends on its ability to identify and exploit the relevant information of the problem at hand, in order to optimize it efficiently. In this line, as a generalization of heuristic algorithms, metaheuristics (MH) introduce higher level generic procedures that guide the search process, making them ”general-purpose methods” . Even though a lot of work has been done in the development of MH algorithms, in the last few decades the research in that area has reached a point of maturity, with hardly any considerable improvements being made. In contrast, Deep Learning (DL) methods have recently entered the optimization paradigm, introducing a breath of fresh air. The recent success of DL in fields such as machine translation , biology [ref]4 and board games , has not only attracted the attention of many machine learning practitioners into the optimization field, but has also captured the interest of the optimization community about the possibilities of DL. The main building blocks of DL algorithms, Neural Networks (NN), were proposed in the 80s to solve COPs as a promising component to incorporate the relevant information of a problem by learning . However, only in the last few decades have NNs become an interesting alternative, due to the increase in computational capacity and the development of complex NN models, which enable the design of competitive algorithms. Recent reviews  [ref]8 present two taxonomies that differentiate the ways and the stages in which DL can be applied to COPs. In general, two main groups can be distinguished: end-to-end methods and hybrid methods. End-to-end methods are designed to solve a particular problem by means of NN models without needing any additional algorithm. Regarding hybrid methods, they combine DL models with previously mentioned exact and heuristic methods. According to  [ref]8, hybrid methods can be split into two groups: Learning to configure algorithms. Almost all the metaheuristics that have been proposed in the literature have a set of configurable parameters and operators that must be tuned carefully for the algorithm to perform efficiently. This parameter tuning has concerned the community for years , and different proposals have been developed using DL to learn how to configure those parameters 0. DL alongside optimization algorithms. This group includes two-level algorithms, in which a heuristic calls a DL model to assist in some decisions, such as the most appropriate crossover or mutation operator, or selecting the most promising branching variable. For instance, a NN can be used to select the next branch and improve the exploration of a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm 1. Though there is much yet to come, hybrid methods generally recreate previously studied techniques with the addition of DL modules [ref]8. Conversely, end-to-end proposals work on the basis of an NN model as the core of the algorithm, and contrary to the conventional methods, the optimization process consists of 2 steps: a learning phase in which the model will be trained, and the inference, in which the model gives a solution to a new problem instance. Therefore, this approach is significantly different to that used by traditional optimization algorithms and, even if interesting proposals have been presented in the literature, the benefits and limitations of end-to-end proposals have not been studied in-depth. Thus, in this paper a discussion about end-to-end models is opened, focusing on the most relevant aspects: (1) Performance. How good are the solutions provided by these models? Are they competitive with the state-of-the-art methods? (2) Training data & Transferability. Which type of data is required to train the model? Is it necessary to have hundreds or even thousands of instances of the real world problem to train the model? Can random instances be used instead? (3) Computational cost. Considering the computation resources and time required to train these NN-based models, are they affordable for medium to large size problems? (4) Generalization to large size instances. Related to the previous issue, in the case when a large enough model can not be trained due to a memory limitation, is it possible to competitively apply a model trained for small size instances to larger instances? Moreover, can a model trained for a problem be successfully applied to another problem? In addition to analysing these aspects on the works presented in the literature, with illustrative purposes, we take a practical case study to apply the analysis over end-to-end models. Particularly, we develop an end-to-end model to solve the Linear Ordering Problem (LOP) 2, a well-known NP-hard COP. Our purpose is not to present a state-of-the-art algorithm, but to guide the reader during the process of implementation and evaluation of the method and address the aforementioned aspects. Moreover, we conduct an experimentation of its capabilities with a broad comparison, using a diverse set of conventional methods, including an exact solver 3, a constructive heuristic 4 and two state-of-the-art metaheuristics 5 6. Conducted experiments show that the end-to-end model is competitive against the constructive heuristic, although it falls behind the metaheuristic algorithms. However, the NN model is capable of generalizing the learnt knowledge to larger instances and transfer it to other types of instances. Not limited to that, a number of promising research lines are described for future investigations on the application of end-to-end models over COPs. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces a revision of meaningful works in the neural end-to-end framework. Section III presents four features of the critical analysis that arise from the introduction of DL algorithms to the optimization field. We try to find answers to a number of relevant questions on the basis of a case of study, the Linear Ordering Problem, which is defined in Section IV, and an end-to-end approach, presented in Section V. A broad set of experiments is conducted in Section VI. Obtained results are discussed in Section VII, where we also suggest new directions for future work in the area of learning algorithms. Finally, Section VIII concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: In contrast, Deep Learning (DL) methods have recently entered the optimization paradigm, introducing a breath of fresh air.
