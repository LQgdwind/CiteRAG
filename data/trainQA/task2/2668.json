      "content": "Paper Title: Teasel: A Transformer-Based Speech-Prefixed Language Model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMultimodal language analysis is a modern field of study in NLP which intends to model language interactions through different parallel simultaneous modalities. These multimodal studies typically contain text, audio, and visual features. Multimodal human language analysis applications include, but are not limited to, sentiment analysis , emotion recognition [ref]5 [ref]19, humor detection , and sarcasm detection . [ref]22 has defined representations, translation, alignment, fusion, and co-learning as five core challenges in multimodal machine learning. Among these challenges, [ref]22 have described fusion as the concept of integrating information from multiple modalities to predict an outcome measure and classifies the fusion methods as early fusion, hybrid fusions, and late fusion. With the success of large Transformer-based language models, there are three common options to utilize these language models in multimodal language settings as described next. First, certain multimodal language approaches freeze a Transformer and aim to fuse all modalities using tensor outer-products  , Canonical Correlation Analysis based methods , Attentive LSTM based methods     [ref]19, sequence to sequence based methods , cross-modal Transformer-based methods   , graph-based method , and multi-task learning . Second, as fine-tuning large pre-trained Transformer-based language models improve their performances on the downstream tasks significantly, recently, some approaches aim to employ this advantage in multimodal settings.  have proposed a method to fuse other modalities in the middle layer of a pre-trained Transformer-based language model in an aligned manner using a Multimodal Adaption Gate (MAG) module. Later, with the popularity of Transformer-based models in Speech,  has examined jointly fine-tuning lexicon and speech Transformer on the multimodal language task. They implemented Co-Attention fusions and Shallow-Fusion using an attentive and a straightforward late fusion of two BERT-style  Transformers, respectively. Third,  have proposed a BERT-style pre-training scheme for multimodal language settings, using text, speech, and visual features. They pre-trained their proposed model using one of the most extensive multimodal language datasets, consisting of around 111 million video segments . Nevertheless, this amount of data is much smaller than the textual corpora size and limits their model’s performance. Our method is a variation of the second approach, i.e., it fine-tunes a Transformer-based language model in a multimodal setting. In contrast to previous work, we utilize a pre-trained Transformer language model as cross-modal attention without needing an entirely different Transformer.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: These multimodal studies typically contain text, audio, and visual features.
