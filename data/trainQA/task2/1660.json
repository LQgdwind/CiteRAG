      "content": "Paper Title: PredDiff: Explanations and Interactions from Conditional Expectations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUnderstanding complex machine learning models is fundamental for high-stake applications, e.g., in healthcare or criminal justice. To this end, the Explainable AI (XAI) community has put forward a plethora of different attribution methods, see   5   for reviews.\nMost methods summarize the complex, non-linear interactions that a single feature undergoes while traversing a machine learning model into a single attribution score.\nWhile this approach can provide invaluable informative heatmaps, feature-wise relevances do not provide access to feature interactions  2 and can even be misleading as interaction effects are implicitly distributed onto single-feature relevances [ref]10. We envision various applications where the understanding of interaction effects is instrumental to extract knowledge about underlying mechanisms from a machine learning model. We exemplify the prospects for such methods in two domains: firstly, in natural sciences and secondly, in healthcare.\nIn the first case, consider a model that is trained to infer protein-protein interactions framed as a binary classification task given both primary protein sequences as input.\nInterpretability methods that allow quantifying interaction effects would then enable to identify corresponding binding sites in both sequences.\nIn the second case, we consider a medical risk prediction model, which infers the mortality risk based on multiple demographic features and lab values. Here, relying only on single-feature importance might lead to a misleadingly simple picture, as multiple risk factors interact and hence, aggravate or alleviate the mortality risk (such as age and sex in the simplest case). Thus, interaction measures are necessary to capture the complex underlying physiological reality. In this work, we revisit Prediction Difference analysis (PredDiff), which was originally introduced in .\nIn our opinion, the beauty of PredDiff lies in its simplicity and strong connection to probability theory.\nThe whole formalism is fixed by marginalizing variables and measuring prediction differences.\nIt has been successfully applied on various image classification tasks     and also in Natural Language Processing, where it is referred to as input marginalization  .\nHowever, all previous studies miss a comprehensive treatment in a well-controlled setting, testing analytical and experimental limits of PredDiff.\nThe unifying perspective on perturbation-based attribution methods in  shows how PredDiff is closely connected to Shapley values 5  and other approaches of this category.\nIn particular, PredDiff encompasses single-shot attribution methods, such as occlusion  or inpainting image parts with generative models  2. These are, however, not covered by the foundations of PredDiff and potentially unreliable. Our main contribution is a novel interaction measure for PredDiff. It is well-founded and allows decomposing feature relevances into main and joint effects.\nImportantly, our decomposition is applicable to any interaction order and obeys a completeness relation.\nIncorporating and quantifying feature interactions has very recently attracted interest within the XAI community, see 2 for a review.\nFirst works on interaction effects appeared in [ref]10    .\nAdditionally, interaction measures have been proposed for Shapley value-based approaches  4  , global ALE-plots , and other perturbation-based approaches  3.\nPredDiff has the particular advantage that it allows quantifying interaction effects for arbitrary (non-overlapping) feature sets, while remaining an optimal linear scaling. Additionally, we investigate PredDiff’s theoretical properties and demonstrate its intimate relationship to Shapley values.\nIn particular, we shed light on the intricacies of classification due to the inherent connection between the classifier and the underlying data distribution.\nWe present consequences for PredDiff and Shapley values, both on the level of relevances and interactions.\nFinally, we present experimental evidence for the soundness of our framework and find qualitative agreement to the popular Shapley Interaction Index. In particular, we quantify feature interactions for an image classifier, as a task that is already intractable for many competing methods with a less favorable scaling than PredDiff. To summarize, our main contributions are\n(i) an investigation of the theoretical properties of PredDiff and its relation to Shapley values\n(ii) a novel interaction measure based on a proper functional decomposition, satisfying an interaction completeness property on relevance level\n(iii) an analysis of intricacies of classification due to the inherent connection between classifier and data distribution\n(iv) the experimental validation on analytic, synthetic and real-world datasets for classification and regression.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: heatmaps, feature-wise relevances do not provide access to feature interactions  2 and can even be misleading as interaction effects are implicitly distributed onto single-feature relevances [ref]10.
