      "content": "Paper Title: Hyperspectral Image Classification With Contrastive Graph Convolutional Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph Neural Network (GNN)  mapped the graph or its vertices to an Euclidean space via a transfer function. Owning to this, GNN is capable of processing graph-structured non-Euclidean data, therefore showing better flexibility and adaptability than CNN. After Bruna et al. 0 introduced graph Laplacian matrix for graph convolution, many GCN models have been proposed and obtained promising performance. Among these methods, Kipf and Welling 1 innovatively applied GCN to semi-supervised learning, which approximated spectral graph convolutions in a localized region so that the proposed method was able to learn hidden representation via encoding both graph structure and node features. However, it belongs to transductive methods, which fails to classify unseen or newly added nodes. To tackle with this issue, Hamilton et al.  developed an inductive framework termed GraphSAGE via generalizing the simple graph convolution to trainable aggregation functions. For HSI classification, GCN is able to capture and preserve the boundaries of different land cover categories flexibly due to its good ability in processing non-Euclidean data. As a result, GCN-based HSI classification methods have emerged and attracted a lot of attention. To the best of our knowledge, Qin et al.  were the first to introduce GCN into HSI classification, which leveraged the features of both adjacency nodes in graph and the neighbor pixels in the HSI. To avoid the imprecise initial graph, Wan et al. [ref]1 proposed to refine the graph gradually during the convolution process, so graph convolution was operated on a dynamic graph rather than a predefined fixed graph. To sufficiently explore the contextual information, Wan et al.  proposed the context-aware dynamic GCN to capture relations among the regions originally far away in the original spatial positions. However, the generalizability of above-mentioned methods is usually limited due to their transductive setting. To solve this problem, Ding et al. 4 proposed a multiscale graph network combining GraphSAGE with context-aware learning to understand the global and local information in a graph. However, it only utilized spectral features to construct the graph. To incorporate the relationship between adjacent nodes at the stage of graph construction, Guo et al. 5 put forward a dual graph U-net via integrating spatial graph and spectral graph simultaneously. Nonetheless, the representation ability of most existing GCN-based methods is still limited due to the inadequate labeled examples. To enhance the representation ability, in our work, we explore the supervision signals contained in spectral information by employing contrastive learning, as well as spatial relations by deploying GCN. Hence, the proposed method can obtain better classification results than existing methods.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: the first to introduce GCN into HSI classification, which leveraged the features of both adjacency nodes in graph and the neighbor pixels in the HSI.
