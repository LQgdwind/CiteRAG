      "content": "Paper Title: DIAL: Deep Interactive and Active Learning for Semantic Segmentation in Remote Sensing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSemantic segmentation, the task of classifying an image at the pixel level, is extremely important in remote sensing and is addressed with deep neural networks for a variety of applications such as land-cover mapping [ref]1, change detection [ref]2 or farmland monitoring . This task is intrinsically complex and, while deep neural networks can be very effective, they are still prone to failure. Indeed, even on academic benchmarks [ref]4 , current state-of-the-art methods often require specific architectures and fine-tuning to obtain high performances but still imperfect results. Moreover, it often gets even more tedious on ”real-life” datasets due to different factors such as domain adaptation between train and test data inherent to remote sensing data (different weather, geographical areas, types of sensors, cloud shadows, etc) or the difficulty to have access to large training annotated datasets for every specific business application, even though lots of efforts are made by the community in this direction  . Hence, the uncertainty about the quality of the results of neural networks often makes their deployment complicated. Human intervention may then be necessary. Precisely, we are thinking of two scenarios representative of real situations. First, the Refinement use-case, when the user aims to fix errors within a single dataset and thus to improve the performances of the model on the test data. Second, the Domain Adaptation use-case, when the user wants to fix on a new dataset the errors of a model pre-trained on a previous dataset. A possible way to address these problems comes with Interactive Learning (IL)  . This consists in adding a human in the loop to work in synergy with a learning algorithm to train it, fine-tune it or adapt it to user inputs. Compared to classically supervised algorithms, IL algorithms must also interface smoothly with the human user. This constraint is particularly challenging with deep neural networks due to their typical high number of parameters and long training time. One step further than IL, Active Learning  (AL) searches in pools of unlabeled data for examples which are the more able to lead the model to a better classification. These examples, defined as queries, are then labeled by the user and incorporated in the training. This thus aims to find the optimal training dataset for the algorithm. To this purpose, active learning methods define acquisition functions to estimate either the model uncertainty associated to the samples  or their representativeness of the dataset . In this article, we explore IL and AL for semantic segmentation. Indeed, as presented in Figure 1, we propose the Deep Interactive and Active Learning (DIAL) framework to interactively refine semantic segmentation maps initially output by a pre-trained neural network. First, it relies on two complementary IL schemes to integrate information provided by a user in deep learning algorithms for semantic segmentation. In a nutshell, the first module uses these annotations to modify at test time the inputs of the network pre-trained to process them while the second one uses them for retraining to modify the weights of the network.\nSecond, we integrate active learning within our framework and propose to guide the user interventions towards relevant areas to annotate. This additional guidance relies on different uncertainty measures that we compare with respect to our framework. These measures can be simple-yet-effective such as entropy  or come from the current state-of-the-art literature such as ODIN  or ConfidNet . We extensively evaluate our framework both in the Refinement and in the Domain Adaptation use-cases to well apprehend its potential. We notably show that the first IL module is more suited to correct spatially small mistakes while the second one is more suited for larger ones and that the active process improves the performance compared to the unguided one. In summary, our major contributions are as follows: We propose a general framework for interactive multi-class semantic segmentation in remote sensing. We show that active learning for area selection allows to speed-up the improvement of the segmentation and reduces the number of required interactions for a given quality. We compare different state-of-the-art methods to estimate the algorithm uncertainty within the DIAL framework sketched in Figure 1, and show that the model confidence evaluated by ConfidNet and surprisingly the entropy are the most effective, the latter being also the faster one. We show these techniques consistently improve the quality of a segmentation map, with the greater gain for the domain adaption use-case where it allows to compensate for the lack of training data in the target domain. This article extends previous work presented in an international conference . It deepens the interactive learning experiments and combines the interactive and active modules within a single framework.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: the task of classifying an image at the pixel level, is extremely important in remote sensing and is addressed with deep neural networks for a variety of applications such as land-cover mapping [ref]1, change detection [ref]2 or farmland monitoring .
