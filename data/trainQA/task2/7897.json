      "content": "Paper Title: ROVER: RTL Optimization via Verified E-Graph Rewriting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAn e-graph is a data structure developed in the theorem proving community [ref]27. E-graphs provide a compact representation of equivalence classes (e-classes) of expressions. An e-graph represents a set of equivalent expressions, where nodes represent variables, constants or functions clustered together in e-classes. Edges represent operator inputs and connect nodes to e-classes, as shown in Figure 3. In this way, a small number of nodes can represent exponentially many more expressions. Figure 3 contains a series of e-graphs, demonstrating how multiple equivalent expressions can be represented. E-graphs are grown using a technique called equality saturation   , where rewrites that define equivalent expressions are applied to the e-graph. E-graphs are based on the theory of uninterpreted functions therefore an operator, e.g. addition, only gains any meaning via rewrites defined on that operator. For example x+x→2×x→𝑥𝑥2𝑥x+x\\rightarrow 2\\times x tells the e-graph that x+x𝑥𝑥x+x is equivalent to 2×x2𝑥2\\times x. Given a set of rewrites, rewriting opportunities are detected via a process known as e-matching that identifies expressions in the e-graph that match the left-hand side patterns  . A key differentiating property of e-graphs is constructive rewrite application. More formally, a rewrite is defined as a pair of expressions (l​h​s𝑙ℎ𝑠lhs, r​h​s𝑟ℎ𝑠rhs), such that when an expression syntactically matching the l​h​s𝑙ℎ𝑠lhs is discovered in the e-graph, the r​h​s𝑟ℎ𝑠rhs is added to the matched e-class in the e-graph. The left-hand side is not destroyed and remains in the e-class. This means that the e-graph grows monotonically and application of one rewrite does not remove alternative rewriting opportunities. Figure 3 shows an e-graph before (Figure 3a) and after (Figure 3b) application of a constructive rewrite that adds a new node to the e-graph. The final rewrite applied to produce Figure 3c, (x≪1)≫1→xmuch-greater-thanmuch-less-than𝑥11→𝑥(x\\ll 1)\\gg 1\\rightarrow x, adds no new nodes to the e-graph, since the right-hand side expression is already contained within the e-graph. In this case, rewriting merges two existing equivalence classes, which, in this instance, leads to a loop in the e-graph. Traditional rewrite engines suffer from the phase-ordering problem, which describes how the order of rewrite application can impact the final outcome . Consider the following two ways to rewrite the initial expression from Figure 3a. A destructive rewriting process leads to two different endpoints depending on the order of rewrite application, hence the phase-ordering problem. This problem is avoided entirely by constructive rewrite application . Applying the rewrite in “Order 2”, the x×2𝑥2x\\times 2 expression is retained and can be matched again, facilitating the application of “Order 1”. This will prove to be a particularly valuable property for hardware design. A general purpose and reusable e-graph library, egg , was recently released and has fueled a new wave of e-graph research. In addition to its usability, egg provides innovations in e-graph performance and numerous analysis features. In this work we will exploit the ability to write conditional and dynamic rewrite rules as well as the e-class analysis framework . The validity of conditional rules can be determined at runtime based on the specific values matched by the left-hand side pattern. The dynamic rewrite rules construct, at runtime, the right-hand side of a rewrite having matched a pattern. The e-class analysis feature allows users to attach additional information to an e-class, enabling program analysis techniques [ref]34. Since e-graphs grow monotonically, they usually reach a fixed point called saturation, where no further rewrite applications add additional information to the e-graph. Proof production was recently added to egg allowing users to extract a rewrite sequence mapping one expression to an equivalent expression in the e-graph . This enables translation validation techniques to be applied to e-graph applications. Translation validation is a compiler technique to verify the correctness of a compiler’s output . The verification problem is broken down into a sequence of sub-problems, verifying each step of the transformation. The proof production feature has been leveraged to develop an RTL verification assistant . E-graphs can be found in widely used SMT solvers such as Z3 . More recently, egg has helped to automate numerical stability improvement in the Herbie tool [ref]37 and synthesis smaller and more efficient rewrite sets via the Ruler tool . In the hardware domain, there is growing interest, with Ustun, Yu and Zhang advocating e-graph rewriting . Previous datapath research has explored alternative implementations of large multipliers on FPGAs, where different levels of decomposition were efficiently explored via equality saturation . ROVER tackles the more general ASIC RTL optimization problem, maximally exploiting logic synthesis capabilities.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: An e-graph is a data structure developed in the theorem proving community [ref]27.
