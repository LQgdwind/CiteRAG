      "content": "Paper Title: Chapter 1 Model-Based Machine Learning for Communications\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTraditional communication systems design is dominated by methods that are based on statistical models. These statistical-model-based algorithms, which we refer to henceforth as model-based methods, rely on mathematical models that describe the transmission process, signal propagation, receiver noise, interference, and many other components of the system that affect the end-to-end signal transmission and reception. Such mathematical models use parameters that vary over time as the channel conditions, the environment, network traffic, or network topology change. Therefore, for optimal operation, many of the algorithms used in communication systems rely on the underlying mathematical models as well as the estimation of the model parameters. However, there are cases where this approach fails, in particular when the mathematical models for one or more of the system components are highly complex, hard to estimate, poorly understood, do not well-capture the underlying physics of the system, or do not lend themselves to computationally-efficient algorithms.\nIn some other cases, although mathematical models are known, accurate parameter estimation may not be possible.\nFinally, common hardware limitations, such as the restriction to utilize low-resolution quantizers or non-linear power amplifiers, can significantly increase the complexity of the underlying channel model. An alternative data-driven approach is based on  machine learning (ML). ML techniques, and in particular, deep learning, have been the focus of extensive research in recent years due to their empirical success in various applications, including computer vision and speech processing  .\nThe benefits of ML-driven methods over traditional model-based approaches are threefold:\nFirst, ML methods are independent of the underlying stochastic model, and thus can operate efficiently in scenarios where this model is unknown or its parameters cannot be accurately estimated.\nSecond, when the underlying model is extremely complex, ML algorithms have demonstrated the ability to extract and disentangle the meaningful semantic information from the observed data , a task which is very difficult to carry out using traditional model-based approaches, even when the model is perfectly known.\nFinally, the main complexity in utilizing ML methods is in the training stage, which is typically carried out offline. Once trained, they tend to implement inference at a lower computational burden and delay compared to their analytical model-based counterparts . Although ML has been the focus of significant research attention over the last decade, it has yet to significantly contribute to practical designs in one of the most important technologies of the modern era â€“ digital communication.\nThe fact that ML-based algorithms, which have revolutionized the fields of computer vision and natural language processing, do not yet play a fundamental role in the design of physical layer communication systems, and particularly digital receivers, may be due to one or more of the following reasons: The large amount of possible outputs impose a major challenge in efficiently applying ML algorithms. In particular, the constellation size of the modulation and the blocklength of the channel code, combined with the time-varying nature of communication channels, leads to an exponentially large number of possible channel outputs that an ML receiver algorithm must be trained on. Traditional deep learning techniques require high computational resources, while communication devices, such as wearable devices and mobile phones, are typically limited in hardware and power. To date, conventional communication schemes, which assume a simplified channel model with parameters that are dynamically estimated, have been very successful. The third reason is likely to become less relevant as the spectrum congestion of existing cellular standards forces future communication systems to explore new frequency ranges and share spectrum with other application such as radar . As these new frequency bands and spectrum sharing techniques become widespread, the simplified channel, interference, and noise models used in current communication receiver techniques may no longer work well. Moreover, the strict cost, power, and memory constraints imposed on communicating devices lead to the usage of low-resolution analog-to-digital convertors and power amplifiers with dominant non-linearities . This makes the successful application of model-based techniques significantly more complex. Thus, conventional model-based approaches may no longer be able to meet the performance and throughput demands of future wireless devices, motivating their combination with data-driven approaches based on ML such as deep learning. Such techniques must still overcome the challenges identified above with respect to the large computational resources and data sets needed for training. Despite its unprecedented success, deep learning is subject to several challenges which limit its applicability in some important communication scenarios. In particular, deep neural networks consist of highly-parameterized systems that can represent a broad range of mappings. As such, massive data sets are typically required to learn a desirable mapping, and the computational burden of training and utilizing these networks may constitute a major drawback. For example, consider the two receivers illustrated in Fig. 1, which carry out symbol detection using model-based algorithms and model-agnostic DNNs, respectively. The dynamic nature of wireless channels implies that the receivers should track channel variations in order to reliably detect the transmitted messages over long periods of time. To do so, the model-based receiver in Fig. 1(a) typically estimates the model parameters imposed on the underlying statistics using periodic pilots. For the same purpose, the DNN-based receiver in Fig. 1(b) should periodically re-train its DNN to track channel variations. The fact that doing so requires a large data set leads to a significant decrease of spectral efficiency and increase in computational complexity associated with this training. Furthermore, DNNs are commonly utilized as black-boxes, and thus do not offer the interpretability, flexibility, versatility, and reliability of model-based techniques. The limitations associated with model-based methods and black-box deep learning systems gave rise to a set of techniques on the interface of traditional model-based communication and ML, attempting to benefit from the best of both worlds . Such model-based ML systems can be divided into two main categories. The first of the two utilizes model-based methods as a form of domain knowledge in designing a DNN architecture, which is then trained and used for inference. The most common example of this strategy is the family of deep unfolded networks [ref]8 [ref]9, which design the layers of a DNN to imitate the iterations of a model-based optimization algorithm, and has been utilized in various communication-related tasks 0.\nThe second strategy, which we call DNN-aided hybrid algorithms, uses model-based methods with integrated DNNs for inference by incorporating ML in a manner that makes the system more robust and model-agnostic. Communication receivers designed using DNN-aided inference include the data-driven implementations of the Viterbi algorithm 1 and the BCJR detector 2. In this chapter we present an introduction to model-based ML for communication systems. We begin by reviewing existing strategies for combining model-based algorithms and ML from a high level perspective in SectionÂ 2, and compare them to the conventional deep learning approach which utilizes established DNN architectures trained in an end-to-end manner. Then, in SectionÂ 3 we focus on symbol detection, which is one of the fundamental tasks of communication receivers. We show how each strategy, i.e., conventional DNN architectures, deep unfolding, and DNN-aided hybrid algorithms, can be applied to this problem. The last two approaches constitute a middle ground between the purely model-based and the DNN-based receivers illustrated in Fig. 1. By focusing on this specific task, we highlight the advantages and drawbacks of each strategy, and present guidelines to facilitate the design of future model-based deep learning systems for communications. We conclude this chapter with a summary provided in SectionÂ 4.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: methods as a form of domain knowledge in designing a DNN architecture, which is then trained and used for inference.
