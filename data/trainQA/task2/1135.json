      "content": "Paper Title: On the Complexity of CSP-based Ideal Membership Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this paper we expand on  and [ref]7  in several ways. We consider IMP​(Γ)IMPΓ\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma) for languages ΓΓ\\Gamma over arbitrary finite set and attempt to obtain general results about such problems. However, we mainly focus on a slightly different problem than Problem 1.1. For which constraint languages ΓΓ\\Gamma the problem IMP​(Γ)IMPΓ\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma) [or IMPd​(Γ)subscriptIMP𝑑Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma)] can be solved in polynomial time? Note that answering whether f0subscript𝑓0f_{0} belongs to a certain ideal does not necessarily mean finding an ideal membership proof of that. However, we will argue that, firstly, in many applications this is the problem we need to solve and therefore our results apply. Secondly, in Section 6.3 we will show that in the majority of cases if the existence of an ideal membership proof can be efficiently decided, such a proof can also be efficiently found. Firstly, in Section 3 we study reductions between IMP’s when the language ΓΓ\\Gamma is enlarged in certain ways. Let ΓΓ\\Gamma be a constraint language over a set D𝐷D. By Γ∗superscriptΓ\\Gamma^{*} we denote ΓΓ\\Gamma with added constant relations, that is, relations of the form {(a)}𝑎\\{(a)\\}, a∈D𝑎𝐷a\\in D. Imposing such a constraint on a variable x𝑥x essentially fixes the allowed values of x𝑥x to be a𝑎a. First, we prove that adding constant relations does not change the complexity of the IMP. For any ΓΓ\\Gamma over D𝐷D the problem IMP​(Γ∗)IMPsuperscriptΓ\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma^{*}) is polynomial time reducible to IMP​(Γ)IMPΓ\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma), and for any d𝑑d the problem IMPd​(Γ∗)subscriptIMP𝑑superscriptΓ\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma^{*}) is polynomial time reducible to IMPd+|D|​(|D|−1)​(Γ)subscriptIMP𝑑𝐷𝐷1Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{d+|D|(|D|-1)}(\\Gamma). Theorem 1.3 has two immediate consequences. Since IMP​(Γ)IMPΓ\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma) is in co-NP, for any CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma) instance 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} there is always a proof that the input polynomial f0subscript𝑓0f_{0} does not belong to the ideal I​(𝒫)I𝒫\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P}). Any solution of 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} that is not a zero of f0subscript𝑓0f_{0} will do. Finding such a proof may be treated as a search version of IMP​(Γ)IMPΓ\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma). Through self-reducibility, Theorem 1.3 allows us to solve the search problem. Let ΓΓ\\Gamma be such that IMP​(Γ)IMPΓ\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma) [IMPd+|D|​(|D|−1)​(Γ)subscriptIMP𝑑𝐷𝐷1Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{d+|D|(|D|-1)}(\\Gamma)] is solvable in polynomial time. Then for any instance (f0,𝒫)subscript𝑓0𝒫(f_{0},\\mathcal{P}) of IMP​(Γ)IMPΓ\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma) [IMPd​(Γ)subscriptIMP𝑑Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma)] such that f0∉I​(𝒫)subscript𝑓0I𝒫f_{0}\\not\\in\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P}), a solution 𝐚𝐚\\mathbf{a} of 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} such that f0​(𝐚)≠0subscript𝑓0𝐚0f_{0}(\\mathbf{a})\\neq 0 can also be found in polynomial time. Theorem 1.3 also provides a hint at a more plausible conjecture for which languages ΓΓ\\Gamma the problem IMP​(Γ)IMPΓ\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma) or IMPd​(Γ)subscriptIMP𝑑Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma) is polynomial time. In particular, it allows to find an example of ΓΓ\\Gamma such that CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma) is tractable while IMPd​(Γ)subscriptIMP𝑑Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma) is not, even for a ΓΓ\\Gamma on a 2-element set and d=1𝑑1d=1. Later we state some results that might indicate that IMPd​(Γ)subscriptIMP𝑑Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma) is polynomial time for every ΓΓ\\Gamma such that CSP​(Γ∗)CSPsuperscriptΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma^{*}) is polynomial time. Note that the structure of such CSPs is now very well understood. Another way of expanding a constraint language is by means of primitive-positive (pp-) definitions and pp-interpretations, and it is at the core of the so-called algebraic approach to the CSP. A relation R𝑅R is said to be pp-definable in ΓΓ\\Gamma if there is a first order formula ΦΦ\\Phi using only conjunctions, existential quantifiers, equality relation, and relations from ΓΓ\\Gamma that is equivalent to R𝑅R. Pp-interpretations are more complicated (see Section 3.3) and allow for certain encodings of R𝑅R. Let Γ,ΔΓΔ\\Gamma,\\Delta be constraint languages over the same set D𝐷D, ΔΔ\\Delta is finite, and every relation from ΔΔ\\Delta is pp-definable in ΓΓ\\Gamma. Then IMP​(Δ)IMPΔ\\textsc{IMP}(\\Delta) is polynomial time reducible to IMP​(Γ)IMPΓ\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma) and IMPd​(Δ)subscriptIMP𝑑Δ\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Delta) is polynomial time reducible to IMPd​(Γ)subscriptIMP𝑑Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma) for any d𝑑d. Let Γ,ΔΓΔ\\Gamma,\\Delta be constraint languages, ΔΔ\\Delta is finite, and ΔΔ\\Delta is pp-interpretable in ΓΓ\\Gamma.\nThen there is a constant k𝑘k such that IMPd​(Δ)subscriptIMP𝑑Δ\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Delta) is polynomial time reducible to IMPk​d​(Γ)subscriptIMP𝑘𝑑Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{kd}(\\Gamma) for any d𝑑d. The approach of Theorem 1.5 was first applied to various proof systems in , although that work is mostly concerned with proof complexity rather than computational complexity. Mastrolilli  ventured into pp-definability without proving any reductions. In particular, the first part of Theorem 1.5 uses techniques from  for projections of ideals. It will later allow us to develop further universal algebra techniques for the IMP. The second part of that theorem will also work towards more powerful universal algebra methods. Recall that according to  in order to find an SOS proof one needs to be able to find Nullstellensatz proofs efficiently. The reductions from Theorems 1.3, 1.5 do not always allow to recover such a proof efficiently only confirming such a proof exists, and therefore cannot be directly used in the conditions from . However, in Section 7 we address this issue. Recall that a polymorphism of a constraint language ΓΓ\\Gamma over a set D𝐷D is a multi-ary operation on D𝐷D that can be viewed as a multi-dimensional symmetry of relations from ΓΓ\\Gamma. By Pol​(Γ)PolΓ\\textsf{Pol}(\\Gamma) we denote the set of all polymorphisms of ΓΓ\\Gamma. As in the case of the CSP, Theorem 1.5 implies that polymorphisms of ΓΓ\\Gamma is what determines the complexity of IMP​(Γ)IMPΓ\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma). In Section 4.1 we show the following. Let Γ,ΔΓΔ\\Gamma,\\Delta be constraint languages over the same set D𝐷D, ΔΔ\\Delta is finite. If Pol​(Γ)⊆Pol​(Δ)PolΓPolΔ\\textsf{Pol}(\\Gamma)\\subseteq\\textsf{Pol}(\\Delta), then IMP​(Δ)IMPΔ\\textsc{IMP}(\\Delta) is polynomial time reducible to IMP​(Γ)IMPΓ\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma) and IMPd​(Δ)subscriptIMP𝑑Δ\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Delta) is polynomial time reducible to IMPd​(Γ)subscriptIMP𝑑Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma) for any d𝑑d. Corollary 1.6 allows us to represent IMPs through polymorphisms and classify the complexity of IMPs according to the corresponding polymorphisms. The method has been initiated by Mastrolilli and Bharathi [ref]7  , although mainly for 2- and one case of 3-element sets. We apply this approach to obtain three sufficient conditions for tractability of the IMP. Let ΓΓ\\Gamma be a constraint language over a set D𝐷D. Then if one of the following conditions holds, IMPd​(Γ)subscriptIMP𝑑Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma) is polynomial time solvable for any d𝑑d. ΓΓ\\Gamma has the dual-discriminator polymorphism (i.e. a ternary operation g𝑔g such that g​(x,y,z)=x𝑔𝑥𝑦𝑧𝑥g(x,y,z)=x unless y=z𝑦𝑧y=z, in which case g​(x,y,z)=y𝑔𝑥𝑦𝑧𝑦g(x,y,z)=y); ΓΓ\\Gamma has a semilattice polymorphism (i.e. a binary operation f𝑓f such that f​(x,x)=x𝑓𝑥𝑥𝑥f(x,x)=x, f​(x,y)=f​(y,x)𝑓𝑥𝑦𝑓𝑦𝑥f(x,y)=f(y,x), and f​(f​(x,y),z)=f​(x,f​(y,z))𝑓𝑓𝑥𝑦𝑧𝑓𝑥𝑓𝑦𝑧f(f(x,y),z)=f(x,f(y,z))); |D|=p𝐷𝑝|D|=p, p𝑝p prime, and ΓΓ\\Gamma has an affine polymorphism modulo p𝑝p (i.e. a ternary operation h​(x,y,z)=x⊖y⊕zℎ𝑥𝑦𝑧direct-sumsymmetric-difference𝑥𝑦𝑧h(x,y,z)=x\\ominus y\\oplus z, where ⊕,⊖direct-sumsymmetric-difference\\oplus,\\ominus are addition and subtraction modulo p𝑝p, or, equivalently, of the field 𝖦𝖥​(p)𝖦𝖥𝑝\\mathsf{GF}(p)). In this case every CSP can be represented as a system of linear equations over 𝖦𝖥​(p)𝖦𝖥𝑝\\mathsf{GF}(p). The three polymorphisms occurring in Theorem 1.7 have played an important role in the CSP research. For one reason they completely cover the tractable cases when |D|=2𝐷2|D|=2 and therefore the results of  , although we used some results (on semilattice polymorphisms) from . For the first part of Theorem 1.7 (also known as 0/1/all constraints) we come up with a technique of preprocessing the input polynomial f0subscript𝑓0f_{0} that allows us to get rid of permutation constraints and greatly simplify the proof for the dual-discriminator polymorphism, including the special case |D|=3𝐷3|D|=3 considered in [ref]7. In the second part of Theorem 1.7 we use the fact, see , that any language with a semilattice polymorphism is pp-interpretable in a language on a 2-element set also having a semilattice polymorphism. Then Theorem 1.7(2) follows from Theorem 1.5(2) and the results of . As is mentioned, the third part of Theorem 1.7 is in fact about systems of linear equations over 𝖦𝖥​(p)𝖦𝖥𝑝\\mathsf{GF}(p), since every instance of CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma), where ΓΓ\\Gamma has an affine polymorphism, is equivalent to a system of linear equations over 𝖦𝖥​(p)𝖦𝖥𝑝\\mathsf{GF}(p). Bharathi and Mastrolilli solved this case for p=2𝑝2p=2 showing that IMPd​(Γ)subscriptIMP𝑑Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma) is polynomial time for any d𝑑d. Their approach is based on FGML algorithm  to construct a bounded degree Gröbner Basis. Instead, we map an instance of IMP​(Γ)IMPΓ\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma) on a different domain consisting of p𝑝p-th roots of unity rather than {0,…,p−1}0…𝑝1\\{0,\\dots,p-1\\}. This transforms the generators of the ideal into very simple polynomials that form a Gröbner Basis without any further modifications. Such a transformation makes it difficult to find an ideal membership proof, but this is resolved in Section 6.3. In Section 4.2 we prove that the standard features of the universal algebraic approach to the CSP work for IMP as well. These include reductions for standard algebraic constructions such as subalgebras, direct powers, and homomorphic images. They easily follow from Theorem 1.5(2). A more general construction of direct product requires a more general version of CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma), and therefore of IMP​(Γ)IMPΓ\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma), the multi-sorted one, in which every variable can have its own domain of values. We do not venture into that direction in the paper. One implication of these results is a necessary condition for tractability of IMP​(Γ)IMPΓ\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma) that follows from a similar one for the CSP. In the second part of the paper we consider a number of applications of the techniques developed in the first part. The key to those applications is an extension of the IMP defined as follows. Given an ideal I⊆𝔽​[x1,…,xn]I𝔽subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛\\emph{{I}}\\subseteq\\mathbb{F}[x_{1},\\dots,x_{n}] and a vector of ℓℓ\\ell polynomials M=(g1,…,gℓ)𝑀subscript𝑔1…subscript𝑔ℓM=(g_{1},\\dots,g_{\\ell}), the χ𝜒\\chiIMP asks if there exist coefficients 𝐜=(c1,…,cℓ)∈𝔽ℓ𝐜subscript𝑐1…subscript𝑐ℓsuperscript𝔽ℓ\\mathbf{c}=(c_{1},\\dots,c_{\\ell})\\in\\mathbb{F}^{\\ell} such that 𝐜​M=∑i=1ℓci​gi𝐜𝑀superscriptsubscript𝑖1ℓsubscript𝑐𝑖subscript𝑔𝑖\\mathbf{c}M=\\sum_{i=1}^{\\ell}c_{i}g_{i} belongs to the ideal I. As with the regular IMP, χ𝜒\\chiIMP can be parametrized by specifying a constraint language ΓΓ\\Gamma, in which case the resulting problem χ𝜒\\chiIMP(Γ)Γ(\\Gamma) (or χ𝜒\\chiIMP(Γ)d{}_{d}(\\Gamma) if the degree of input polynomials is bounded) only allows ideal produced by instances of CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma). We prove that χ𝜒\\chiIMP can be solved in polynomial time when a (d𝑑d-truncated) Gröbner Basis can be efficiently generated, and also admits the same reductions as the IMP. Let Γ,ΔΓΔ\\Gamma,\\Delta be constraint languages and ΔΔ\\Delta is finite. Then If every relation from ΔΔ\\Delta is pp-definable in ΓΓ\\Gamma, then χ​IMP​(Δ)𝜒IMPΔ\\chi\\textsc{IMP}(\\Delta) is polynomial time reducible to χ​IMP​(Γ)𝜒IMPΓ\\chi\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma) and χ​IMPd​(Δ)𝜒subscriptIMP𝑑Δ\\chi\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Delta) is polynomial time reducible to χ​IMPd​(Γ)𝜒subscriptIMP𝑑Γ\\chi\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma) for any d𝑑d. If ΔΔ\\Delta is pp-interpretable in ΓΓ\\Gamma,\nthen there is a constant k𝑘k such that χ​IMPd​(Δ)𝜒subscriptIMP𝑑Δ\\chi\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Delta) is polynomial time reducible to χ​IMPk​d​(Γ)𝜒subscriptIMP𝑘𝑑Γ\\chi\\textsc{IMP}_{kd}(\\Gamma) for any d𝑑d. The theorem above allows us to show that for every ΓΓ\\Gamma for which IMPd​(Γ)subscriptIMP𝑑Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma) is polynomial time solvable, so is χ𝜒\\chiIMP(Γ)d{}_{d}(\\Gamma). This includes constraint languages invariant under dual-discriminator, semilattice, and affine polymorphisms. In Section 6.3 we use χ𝜒\\chiIMP along with the factor ring 𝔽​[x1,…,xn]/I𝔽subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛I\\mathbb{F}[x_{1},\\dots,x_{n}]/\\emph{{I}} modulo an ideal I to generate a basis for the factor ring consisting of monomials of degree at most d𝑑d, and then use it to construct a d𝑑d-truncated Gröbner Basis for I. More precisely, we prove the following. Let ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} be a class of ideals for which χ​IMPd𝜒subscriptIMP𝑑\\chi\\textsc{IMP}_{d} is polynomial time solvable. Then there exists a polynomial time algorithm that constructs a degree d𝑑d Gröbner Basis of an ideal I∈ℋIℋ\\emph{{I}}\\in\\mathcal{H}, I⊆𝔽​[x1,…,xn]I𝔽subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛\\emph{{I}}\\subseteq\\mathbb{F}[x_{1},\\dots,x_{n}], in time O​(nd)𝑂superscript𝑛𝑑O(n^{d}). Theorem 1.9 makes it possible to construct d𝑑d-truncated Gröbner Bases in all cases IMP​(Γ)IMPΓ\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma) is known to be polynomial time. Thus, it basically eliminates the gap between deciding the existence of an ideal membership proof and finding such a proof. We apply χ𝜒\\chiIMP and algebraic techniques to finding Sum-of-Squares (SoS) proofs. For variables x1,…,xnsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛x_{1},\\dots,x_{n} a semialgebraic set is given by a collection of polynomial equalities and inequalities such as The goal is to proof that some polynomial r​(𝐱)𝑟𝐱r(\\mathbf{x}) is nonnegative on S𝑆S. An SOS proof of r​(𝐱)≥0𝑟𝐱0r(\\mathbf{x})\\geq 0 is given by a polynomial identity of the form The degree of an SOS proof is often defined to be the maximum degree of the polynomials involved in the proofs i.e., max⁡{d​e​g​(hi2),d​e​g​(sj2​qk),d​e​g​(λi​pi)}𝑑𝑒𝑔superscriptsubscriptℎ𝑖2𝑑𝑒𝑔superscriptsubscript𝑠𝑗2subscript𝑞𝑘𝑑𝑒𝑔subscript𝜆𝑖subscript𝑝𝑖\\max\\{deg(h_{i}^{2}),deg(s_{j}^{2}q_{k}),deg(\\lambda_{i}p_{i})\\}. If the degree is bounded such a proof can often be found using an SDP program. We obtain two results related to SOS proofs. The first one deals with the recently discovered issue of high bit complexity of such proofs. O’Donnell  discovered that in some cases although an SOS proof of low degree exists, it may involve exponentially long coefficients, and therefore it may be impossible to find such a proof efficiently. Raghavendra and Weitz  suggested three conditions such that if the set S𝑆S satisfies them, the existence of a low degree SOS proof implies the existence of a low bit complexity one. In Section 7.2 we show that for sets S𝑆S in which the polynomials p1,…,pmsubscript𝑝1…subscript𝑝𝑚p_{1},\\dots,p_{m} are produced from some CSP instance of the form CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma) one of these conditions (δ𝛿\\delta-richness) is guaranteed to be true, and another one (k𝑘k-effectiveness) can be dropped altogether. Let 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} be an instance of CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma) and I​(𝒫)=⟨p1​…,pm⟩I𝒫subscript𝑝1…subscript𝑝𝑚\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P})=\\left\\langle p_{1}\\dots,p_{m}\\right\\rangle be the corresponding ideal to 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P}. Assume that ∀qi,∀𝐚∈Sfor-allsubscript𝑞𝑖for-all𝐚𝑆\\forall q_{i},\\forall\\mathbf{a}\\in S we have qi​(𝐚)>εsubscript𝑞𝑖𝐚𝜀q_{i}(\\mathbf{a})>\\varepsilon. Then if r𝑟r has a degree d𝑑d SOS proof of nonnegativity on S𝑆S, it also has a degree d𝑑d SOS proof of nonnegativity with coefficients bounded by 2p​o​l​y​(nd,log⁡1ε)superscript2𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑦superscript𝑛𝑑1𝜀2^{poly(n^{d},\\log\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon})}. In particular, if there are no polynomial inequalities then every coefficient can be written down with only p​o​l​y​(nd)𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑦superscript𝑛𝑑poly(n^{d}) bits. The second result concerns the degree bounds that are required for the SOS proof system to be automatizable. An SOS proof is clearly divided into the “ideal part”, a combination of p1,…,pmsubscript𝑝1…subscript𝑝𝑚p_{1},\\dots,p_{m} that belongs to the corresponding ideal and the “SOS part” (the rest). The standard requirement is that max⁡{d​e​g​(hi2),d​e​g​(sj2​qk),d​e​g​(λi​pi)}𝑑𝑒𝑔superscriptsubscriptℎ𝑖2𝑑𝑒𝑔superscriptsubscript𝑠𝑗2subscript𝑞𝑘𝑑𝑒𝑔subscript𝜆𝑖subscript𝑝𝑖\\max\\{deg(h_{i}^{2}),deg(s_{j}^{2}q_{k}),deg(\\lambda_{i}p_{i})\\} has to be bounded in order for SOS to be automatizable. We show that this requirement can be relaxed so that only max⁡{d​e​g​(hi2),d​e​g​(sj2​qk)}𝑑𝑒𝑔superscriptsubscriptℎ𝑖2𝑑𝑒𝑔superscriptsubscript𝑠𝑗2subscript𝑞𝑘\\max\\{deg(h_{i}^{2}),deg(s_{j}^{2}q_{k})\\} is bounded, provided the ideal generated by p1,…,pmsubscript𝑝1…subscript𝑝𝑚p_{1},\\dots,p_{m} belongs to a tractable χ​IMP​(Γ)𝜒IMPΓ\\chi\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma). Let ΓΓ\\Gamma be a constraint language such that χ​IMP​(Γ)𝜒IMPΓ\\chi\\textsc{IMP}(\\Gamma) is polynomial time decidable. Let 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} be an instance of CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma) and I​(𝒫)=⟨p1​…,pm⟩I𝒫subscript𝑝1…subscript𝑝𝑚\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P})=\\left\\langle p_{1}\\dots,p_{m}\\right\\rangle be the corresponding ideal to 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P}. Assume that ∀qi,∀𝐚∈Sfor-allsubscript𝑞𝑖for-all𝐚𝑆\\forall q_{i},\\forall\\mathbf{a}\\in S we have qi​(𝐚)>εsubscript𝑞𝑖𝐚𝜀q_{i}(\\mathbf{a})>\\varepsilon. Then for a polynomial r𝑟r, the existence of an SOS proof (1) with max⁡{d​e​g​(hi2),d​e​g​(sj2)}≤d𝑑𝑒𝑔superscriptsubscriptℎ𝑖2𝑑𝑒𝑔superscriptsubscript𝑠𝑗2𝑑\\max\\{deg(h_{i}^{2}),deg(s_{j}^{2})\\}\\leq d is polynomial time decidable. The above theorem could potentially improve upon the existing SOS SDP relaxations for several problems. For instance, problems such as Vertex Cover, Clique, and Stable Set, are all instances of Boolean CSPs for which the corresponding χ𝜒\\chiIMP is polynomial time decidable. More generally, χ𝜒\\chiIMP is polynomial time decidable for the 2-SAT problem, hence polynomial optimization problems over 2-SAT can enjoy the more relaxed version of SOS proofs introduced in Theorem 1.11. An interesting research direction would be studying the power of this relaxed setting in terms of approximation algorithms. Finally, in Section 8, we apply our techniques to show that the theta bodies  arising from certain combinatorial problems can be constructed in polynomial time. One of the core problems in optimization is to understand the conv​(S)conv𝑆\\texttt{conv}(S) or a relaxation of conv​(S)conv𝑆\\texttt{conv}(S), where S𝑆S the set of feasible solutions to a given problem and conv​(S)conv𝑆\\texttt{conv}(S) denotes the convex hull of S𝑆S. Here, we consider combinatorial ideals arising from CSPs where S𝑆S is a finite subset of ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}. Theta body relaxations, introduced by Gouveia, Parrilo and Thomas , obtain a hierarchy of relaxations to conv​(S)conv𝑆\\texttt{conv}(S). They are strong relaxations, for instance, they achieve the best approximation among all symmetric SDPs of a comparable size  and are known to have nice properties . Let T​Hk​(I​(𝒫))𝑇subscript𝐻𝑘I𝒫TH_{k}(\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P})), 𝒫∈CSP​(Γ)𝒫CSPΓ\\mathcal{P}\\in\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma), denote the k𝑘k-th theta body of I​(𝒫)I𝒫\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P}). Theta bodies create a nested sequence of closed convex relaxations i.e., T​H1​(I​(𝒫))⊇T​H2​(I​(𝒫))⊇⋯⊇conv​(S)superset-of-or-equals𝑇subscript𝐻1I𝒫𝑇subscript𝐻2I𝒫superset-of-or-equals⋯superset-of-or-equalsconv𝑆TH_{1}(\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P}))\\supseteq TH_{2}(\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P}))\\supseteq\\dots\\supseteq\\texttt{conv}(S). We say a constraint language ΓΓ\\Gamma is T​Hk𝑇subscript𝐻𝑘TH_{k}-exact if for any instance 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} of CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma) the ideal I​(𝒫)I𝒫\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P}) is T​Hk𝑇subscript𝐻𝑘TH_{k}-exact. The ideal I​(𝒫)I𝒫\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P}) is T​Hk𝑇subscript𝐻𝑘TH_{k}-exact if T​Hk​(I​(𝒫))=conv​(S)𝑇subscript𝐻𝑘I𝒫conv𝑆TH_{k}(\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P}))=\\texttt{conv}(S). Zero-dimensional ideals are T​Hk𝑇subscript𝐻𝑘TH_{k}-exact for some finite k𝑘k .\nAn intriguing question is characterizing T​Hk𝑇subscript𝐻𝑘TH_{k}-exact constraint languages, for constant k𝑘k: Which constraint languages are T​Hk𝑇subscript𝐻𝑘TH_{k}-exact, for some constant k𝑘k?. This is analogous to Lovász’s question [ref]40 where he asked: Which ideals in ℝ​[x1,…,xn]ℝsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛\\mathbb{R}[x_{1},\\dots,x_{n}] are T​Hk𝑇subscript𝐻𝑘TH_{k}-exact 111In fact, Lovász’s asked which ideals in ℝ​[x1,…,xn]ℝsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛\\mathbb{R}[x_{1},\\dots,x_{n}] are (1,k)1𝑘(1,k)-SOS. An ideal is (1,k)1𝑘(1,k)-SOS if every nonnegative linear polynomial on S𝑆S is k𝑘k-SOS mod I. However, it turns out that a radical ideal in ℝ​[x1,…,xn]ℝsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛\\mathbb{R}[x_{1},\\dots,x_{n}] is (1,k)1𝑘(1,k)-SOS if and only if it is T​Hk𝑇subscript𝐻𝑘TH_{k}-exact .. This question is partially answered in  for the case k=1𝑘1k=1 from a completely different perspective. From algorithmic point of view, a natural question to ask is that for which constraint languages constructing theta bodies is a polynomial time task. For which constraint languages ΓΓ\\Gamma the k𝑘k-th theta body T​Hk​(I​(𝒫))𝑇subscript𝐻𝑘I𝒫TH_{k}(\\emph{{I}}(\\mathcal{P})) is computable in polynomial time where 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} is an instance of CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma)? Here, we provide strong evidence that the polymorphisms of constraint languages might be the right notion that one should consider to address Problem 1.12. To construct the k𝑘k-th theta bodies it is sufficient to obtain a basis for the factor ring ℝ​[x1,…,xn]k/Iℝsubscriptsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛𝑘I\\mathbb{R}[x_{1},\\dots,x_{n}]_{k}/\\emph{{I}} modulo ideal I  . Our result in Theorem 1.9 gives us such a luxury. While there are only very few problems for which efficient construction of theta bodies are known, we provide a unifying framework to study the computational aspects of theta bodies and, ultimately, making progress towards answering Problem 1.12. In particular, we present (rediscover) several positive results for problems such as Stable Set, Binary Matroids, H-Coloring, Min/Max Ones, and Strict CSPs.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: In this paper we expand on  and [ref]7  in several ways.
