The elements used for incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are typically the same as for the linear incompressible Stokes equation, e.g.,  . To ensure convergence, the finite element space should satisfy the inf-sup condition¬† . Conforming elements, such as the Taylor-Hood elements¬†  , and non-conforming elements such as Raviart-Thomas elements¬† are commonly used. To solve the nonlinear problem, iterative penalty methods¬† , and augmented Lagrangian methods¬† were used. In our comparison, we use the standard linear and quadratic Lagrange bases for tetrahedra (P1subscriptùëÉ1P_{1} and P2subscriptùëÉ2P_{2}) and hexahedra (Q1subscriptùëÑ1Q_{1} and Q2subscriptùëÑ2Q_{2})  , which is a special case of the Taylor-Hood element¬†. We use the standard mixed Galerkin formulation¬†  with the full-order Gaussian quadrature for all our experiments. In the finite volume (FV) method for fluid simulation (e.g., 7), the solution domain is subdivided into a finite number of small control volumes (or cells) by a mesh, which does not change in time for transient calculations. Velocity and pressure are stored in the same cell location (cell center in Ansys Fluent), which is usually called the collocated or non-staggered variable arrangement¬†. The volume integrals in a partial differential equation that contain a divergence term are converted to surface integrals, using the divergence theorem. These terms are then evaluated as fluxes at the surfaces of each finite volume. Because the flux entering a given volume is identical to that leaving the adjacent volume, these methods are conservative. We use the Ansys pressure-based FV solver and the Ansys laminar model  in Ansys Fluent. We use the pressure-velocity coupled scheme. For spatial discretization, we select the least-square cell-based scheme for gradients, the second-order scheme for pressure, and the second upwind implicit scheme for momentum. We select the second-order implicit scheme provided in Fluent as the time integrator . In certain applications, high solution errors are more acceptable; in these cases, a structured and uniform spatial discretization with the lowest possible order of interpolation kernels for both velocity and pressure  is used. Many methods in this category adopt a linear velocity and constant pressure scheme. Since this discretization combination on collocated grids has spurious checkerboard or hour-glass modes and is not stable, it is common to use the staggered Marker-And-Cell (MAC) grid¬† with velocities discretized on the cell surfaces and pressure on the cell centers, that stabilizes the scheme. We use the MAC grid in our experiments with FD approaches. In Appendix¬†B we describe how we use the MAC grid for complex geometries.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: The finite element method (FEM)¬†  is a classical method used to solve PDEs, and large number of libraries and software exist (e.g., DOLFIN (FEniCS)¬†[ref]2 Firedrake¬†, libMESH¬†, mFEM¬† , getFEM¬†, Deal II¬†).
