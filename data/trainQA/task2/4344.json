      "content": "Paper Title: Organic Priors in Non-Rigid Structure from Motion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNon-rigid structure from motion (NRSfM) factorization is a classical problem in geometric computer vision  [ref]27. The problem’s primary objective is to recover 3D shape of a deforming object from a given set of image key-points tracked across multiple images. As a result, it is sometimes referred as solving an inverse graphics problem . An effective solution to NRSfM is of significant importance to many computer vision and geometry processing applications . It is now widely accepted that the NRSfM problem is challenging to work out if the shape deforms arbitrarily across images, as it becomes equivalent to a non-rigid shape recovery problem using a single image at a time, which is ill-posed. Accordingly, several assumptions and priors are often used to make the problem solvable and computationally tractable. For instance, the deforming shape spans a low-rank space, smooth temporal shape deformation  , shape or trajectory lies in the union of linear subspace     [ref]29  and the local surface deformation is rigid or near rigid   4 . Other favored prior assumptions include smooth camera motion  [ref]28, a piece-wise planar deformation model 4   , a Gaussian shape prior distribution , the availability of a 3D shape template , and shapes across frames must align . Despite that, NRSfM remains a challenging and active research problem. Meanwhile, there exist several popular methods to solve NRSfM     . Here, we will concern ourselves with the theory of matrix factorization for NRSfM elaborated in 1999-2000 by Bregler et al.111See, however, C. Tomasi and T. Kanade, pp. 137-154, IJCV (1992) for the original matrix factorization theory for shape and motion estimation, although devoted to the rigid SfM problem .. It is a simple yet an effective approach to solve NRSfM. In the context of matrix factorization, one of the commonly used prior assumptions is that the non-rigid shape spans a low-rank space i.e., the shape at each instance can be represented as a linear combination of a small set of basis shapes . This paper adheres to such an assumption and shows that other important prior information resides within the intermediate factorized matrices —termed as organic priors. Surprisingly, most existing methods, if not all, ignore them. We used the word <<organic>> because they come naturally by properly conceiving the algebraic and geometric construction of NRSfM factorization   . Furthermore, this paper contends that the use of external priors and assumptions not only restricts the practical use of NRSfM methods, but also constrains the understanding and broader use of the well-known theory . Yet, unlike , we advocate the use of organic priors, which is predicated on the proposition put forward by Kumar [ref]28. In this paper, we will show how to procure organic priors and exploit them effectively. One of the critical innovations in NRSfM factorization that disputed the use of extraneous priors was introduced in  2. The algorithm proposed in that paper does not use any prior other than the low-rank shape assumption. Nevertheless, despite its theoretical elegance and challenging argument, it fails to perform well on benchmark datasets    5. Recently, Kumar [ref]28 highlighted the possible reasons and exploited its missing pieces to gain performance. It was shown that a better rotation and shape could be estimated using the prior-free method’s theory 2 . Still, [ref]28 based his work on a smooth camera motion assumption that requires a brute force, heuristic search in the rotation space. In contrast, this paper puts forward a systematic method for NRSfM factorization that encourages the use of organic priors extracted from the factorized matrices. Experiments on synthetic and real benchmarks show that our approach consistently provides excellent 3D reconstruction results. This indicates the strength of matrix factorization theory for NRSfM. In summary, our contributions are A methodical approach for solving NRSfM that provides outstanding results using simple matrix factorization idea under the low-rank shape assumption. An approach that endorses the use of organic priors rather than extraneous priors or assumptions. Our method introduce single rotation averaging to estimate better rotation while being free from smooth camera motion heuristics. A different setup for low-rank shape optimization is proposed. We present a blend of partial sum minimization of singular values theory and weighted nuclear norm optimization for shape recovery. We observed that the proposed optimization better exploits the organic shape priors and yields shape reconstructions superior to other popular NRSfM factorization methods  [ref]28 . Further, we proffer the benefits of L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} single rotation averaging for NRSfM factorization, which is excellent at providing robust rotation solutions. Although most of NRSfM factorization focuses on sparse key-point sets, our method is equally effective for dense feature points and compares favorably with well crafted state-of-the-art dense NRSfM methods such as 5 [ref]29 .\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: Non-rigid structure from motion (NRSfM) factorization is a classical problem in geometric computer vision  [ref]27.
