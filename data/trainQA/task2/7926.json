      "content": "Paper Title: FRED: Flexible REduction-Distribution Interconnect and Communication Implementation for Wafer-Scale Distributed Training of DNN Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep Neural Networks (DNNs) models are on an exponential growth curve. A recent study shows that in less than two years, the compute and memory requirements for DNN training have increased by 1800×\\times and 1500×\\times, respectively . Distributing the training across multiple accelerators or Neural Processing Units (NPUs) is a common practice today to reduce the training time. However, one critical side-effect of distributed training is the communication overhead between NPUs to synchronize model gradients and/or activations, depending on the parallelization strategy. As the number of NPUs scale, the communication overhead increases, up to a point where it becomes the dominant factor in distributed training latency [ref]35   8. There are fundamental limits to the bandwidths that can be provided even by high-speed rack-scale fabrics (such as NVlinks [ref]22) and thus there has been a growing interest towards platforms that integrate multiple NPUs together on the same package. Cerebras demonstrated one extreme incarnation of this idea in the form of a monolithic wafer with NPUs connected to one another. More cost- and yield-effective waferscale approaches involve integrating NPU chiplets and DRAM chiplets together   . While there is broad agreement on the scalability and bandwidth benefits that wafer-scale substrates can provide, the architecture of the on-wafer fabric connecting the NPUs remains an open question. All wafer-scale accelerator proposals to date (e.g., Cerebras CS2 , Tesla Dojo , Tensorrent Wormhole , UCLA’s waferscale GPU ) have implemented a 2D mesh topology. The choice of a mesh is understandable. It is the most pervasive topology in many-core chips given its ease of place-and route and scalability, and is the natural choice on a many-chiplet substrate as well. However, this work demonstrates that the inherent blocking nature of the mesh topology is extremely inefficient for DNN training communication use cases. To design an optimal fabric for DNNs, it is crucial to first understand the communication needs.\nCommunication in DNN training depends inherently on the parallelism strategy being employed.\nData-Parallel (DP)  8, Model-Parallel (MP)  , and Pipeline-Parallel (PP) 6 , are the building blocks of any parallelism strategy.\nIn DP, the DNN model is replicated across NPUs and each NPU works on different set of training samples (minibatch). In MP, each DNN layer is sharded across NPUs while they work on the same training samples. In PP, each NPU hosts a subset of DNN layers, and training samples flow through NPUs in a pipeline manner. 3D-parallelism  utilizes all aforementioned strategies by creating different MP/DP/PP groups between NPUs. The optimal balance between DP, MP and PP is heavily dependant on the workload and underlying platform and can significantly vary for different workload/platform configurations . Fig. 1 shows an example of a 3D parallelism strategy (Sec. II provides more details). From a communication perspective, 3D-parallelism requires executing multiple concurrent communication operations between NPUs within the same MP/DP/PP group at different stages of distributing training. Moreover, different parallelism strategies stress the compute and communication differently. This is quantified in Fig. 2. As the figure shows, high communication overhead can result in the total training overhead of compute-efficient strategies being greater than the less compute-efficient strategies (e.g., MP(20)-DP(1)-PP(1), vs. MP(5)-DP(4)-PP(1)). An inefficient network fabric can force the compiler to discard some parallelization strategies due to their poor communication performance on the fabric, effectively trading compute and memory performance for lower communication overhead. Additionally, an inefficient network complicates the device placement and communication primitive algorithms for a given parallelization strategy. In summary, an optimal fabric for DNN training should meet the following three needs. Handle multiple non-blocking collective communications with minimum congestion Efficient for all 3D-parallelism configurations Provide high-BW connectivity between NPUs In this work, we propose FRED, a wafer-scale network fabric for supporting arbitrary 3D-parallelism.\nTo address (1) and (2), FRED includes: (a) a network fabric architecture comprising a novel topology with switches that provide native support for reduction and broadcast for bandwidth amplification, (b) a collective routing algorithm with non-blocking support, and (c) device placement algorithm to minimize congestion. Fig. 1 highlights these features.\nTo address (3), we deploy FRED over a wafer-scale substrate . Each “NPU” in our architecture is a hybrid integration of compute chiplets and 3D-stack DRAM chiplets.\nWe also discuss solutions to\nlayout and scale the FRED topology over the wafer.\n To the best of our knowledge, FRED is the first work that is tailored for high-BW of wafer-scale interconnects and can efficiently support concurrent in-network collectives of hybrid parallelization strategies (e.g., 3D-parallelism). Hence, FRED enables the compiler to consider any type of parallelization strategies without any concern about efficiently they can be executed on the network.\nIn summary: We motivate the challenges with designing a wafer-scale fabric for 3D-parallelism (Sec. III). We propose FRED, a novel network fabric that includes several innovative features: a switch fabric with flexible reduction-distribution trees connected via a scalable topology (Sec. IV), a novel routing algorithm to route multiple collectives concurrently along with a congestion-aware device placement policy for 3D-parallelism (Sec. V). We demonstrate how FRED can be implemented as a\nwafer-scale fabric (Sec. VI). We compare FRED with baseline fabrics for some sample workloads and parallelization strategies (Sec. VIII). Our results show that FRED can improve the average end-to-end training time of ResNet-152, Transformer-17B, GPT-3, and Transformer-1T by 1.76×\\times, 1.87×\\times, 1.34×\\times and 1.4×\\times when compared to the baseline 2D-Mesh, respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: depending on the parallelization strategy.
