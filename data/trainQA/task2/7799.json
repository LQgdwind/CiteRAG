Thus, its effectiveness relies on the quality of the documentation and the scope of the datasets. Kande et al. [ref]57 evaluate LLMs for security assertion generation. They generate prompts using designed templates, to guide LLMs to produce assertions, which are\nthen used in a SystemVerilog simulator. The simulation logs are parsed for assertion violations and analyzed against a set of “golden assertions.”\nDesigner expertise is needed to analyze the security properties and to accurately assess their effectiveness. DIVAS \nleverages LLMs to identify relevant CWEs [ref]65 within selected SoC specifications, then generates SystemVerilog assertions (SVAs) using LLMs for verification, all toward automated, policy-based SoC design flows. While identifying CWEs using LLMs is feasible, this works also shows that there are limitations for accuracy and scope. AutoSVA2  combines formal verification and GPT-4 to generate SVAs directly from RTL, i.e., without relying on specifications. This method successfully detects a previously unknown bug in a RISC-V Ariane SoC. It shows the potential to fine-tune LLMs using curated datasets of SVAs and RTL. ChIRAAG  systematically deconstructs design specifications into standardized texts and then uses LLMs to generate assertions from those. It also generates testbenches to validate the generated assertions, serving as feedback to enhance the LLM’s performance.\nStill, further exploration is needed to assess both the quality of unstructured specifications and the extent of functional coverage of assertions. AssertLLM  automatically generates assertions.\nIt simplifies the process into three steps: extracting relevant details from the specifications, aligning signal names with their definitions in HDL codes, and generating SVAs. This approach utilizes three specialized LLMs to handle each step separately.\nNaturally, the quality of the input specification and the effectiveness of the LLMs dictate the quality of the generated SVAs.\n\nReference markers found: [57]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]57: documentations and then fine-tunes the model with customized hardware-domain datasets. Thus, its effectiveness relies on the quality of the documentation and the scope of the datasets. Kande et al. [ref]57 evaluate LLMs for security assertion generation.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
