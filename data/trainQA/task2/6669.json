      "content": "Paper Title: Unlocking the Emotional World of Visual Media:An Overview of the Science, Research, and Impact of Understanding Emotion Drawing insights from psychology, engineering, and the arts, this article provides a comprehensive overview of the field of emotion analysis in visual media, and discusses the latest research, systems, challenges, ethical implications, and potential impact of artificial emotional intelligence on society.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBased on the emotion representation models discussed in Section II-A, various evoked emotion analysis tasks can be undertaken, including classification, regression, retrieval, detection, and label distribution learning . The former three can also be classified into visual media-centric dominant emotion analyses and viewer-centric personalized emotion analyses, while the latter two are typically visual media-centric. After obtaining a unified representation, shallow or deep learning-based methods can be employed to map the features to evoked emotions. A variety of machine learning algorithms have been utilized to learn the mapping between the unified representation after feature fusion and evoked emotions. These algorithms include naïve Bayes  [ref]200 , logistic regression [ref]200   , SVM and support vector regression with linear and radial basis function (RBF) kernels   [ref]200       [ref]207     , linear discriminant analysis (LDA) , multiple instance learning , random forest  , decision tree , ensemble learning , a mixture of experts , sparse learning  , and graph/hypergraph learning . There is still room for innovation in designing emotion-sensitive mapping algorithms. The most common deep learning-based mapping is a multilayer perceptron based on one or more fully connected layers. The difference mainly lies in objective loss functions, such as cross-entropy loss for classification    9   7 [ref]230     8       2, Euclidean and mean squared error loss for regression  , contrastive loss and triplet loss for retrieval, and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss for label distribution learning   . Unlike shallow learning methods, these deep learning techniques can typically be trained in an end-to-end manner.\nSome improvements have also been made to better explore the interactions between different tasks and the characteristics and relationships of different emotion categories, such as through the use of polarity-consistent cross-entropy loss and regression loss 6  and hierarchical cross-entropy loss . More details are given in the following. The aforementioned evoked emotion analysis tasks are interconnected. For instance, the detection of emotional regions can inform the emotion classification task, and the emotion category with the largest probability in label distribution learning often aligns with the emotion classification results. However, a notable difference between evoked emotion modeling and traditional computer vision or machine learning lies in the existence of specific correlations among emotions. We summarize recent advancements in multitask learning and the exploration of emotion correlations in evoked emotion modeling. Multi-task learning has been shown to significantly improve performance compared to single-task learning by leveraging appropriate shared information and imposing reasonable constraints across multiple related tasks . It has become popular in evoked emotion modeling, especially when training data is limited for each task. Based on the relations explored, multitask learning can be categorized into task relation learning-oriented   7 [ref]230  8, testing data relation learning-oriented , feature relation learning-oriented , and viewer relation learning-oriented approaches . Different evoked emotion analysis tasks are often jointly performed, such as classification and distribution learning  [ref]230, classification and retrieval , and classification and detection 7 8 . Joint optimization of different objective losses allows models to extract more discriminative feature representations. For example, multitask shared sparse regression was proposed to predict continuous emotion distributions of multiple testing images with sparsity constraints, which takes advantage of feature group structures . Different constraints across features are considered  to reflect their importance by a weighting strategy, which can be viewed as a special late fusion category. Rolling multitask hypergraph learning is proposed to simultaneously predict\npersonalized emotion perceptions of different viewers where social connections among viewers are considered . Exploring correlations among different emotion categories or continuous emotion values can improve evoked emotion analysis. Commonly considered emotion correlations include: Emotion hierarchy. As emotion categories researchers attempt to model become more diverse and nuanced, level of granularity increases . As shown in Fig. 13(a), emotions can be organized into a hierarchy, which has been exploited in evoked emotion analysis. By considering the polarity-emotion hierarchy, i.e. whether two emotion categories belong to the same polarity, polarity-consistent cross-entropy loss  and regression loss 6 are designed to increase the penalty of predictions that have the opposite polarity to the ground truth. Hierarchical cross-entropy loss has been proposed to jointly consider both emotion and polarity loss . For each level in the emotion hierarchy, one specific semantic level is mapped with local learning to acquire corresponding discrimination . Emotion similarity. Similarities or distances between emotions can vary, with some being closer than others. For example, sadness is closer to disgust than it is to contentment. To account for these similarities, the Mikels’ emotion wheel was introduced  (Fig. 13(b) left). Pairwise emotion similarity is defined as the reciprocal of “1 plus the number of steps required to discriminate one emotion from another”. Using the Mikels’ wheel, the emotion distribution is transformed from a single emotion category  [ref]230. Chain center loss is derived from the triplet loss, with anchor-related-negative triplets selected based on emotion similarity 0. A more accurate method of measuring emotion similarity, based on a well-grounded circular-structured representation called the Emotion Circle, has also been designed  (Fig. 13(b) right). Each emotion category can be represented as an emotion vector with three attributes\n(i.e., polarity, type, and intensity) and two properties (i.e., similarity and additivity), allowing for vector addition operations. Emotion boundedness. Not every combination of valence, arousal, and dominance values make sense in an emotion space. The transformation between discrete emotion states and their rough continuous values is often possible   (Fig. 13(c)). For example, positive valence is linked to happiness, whereas negative valence is linked to sadness or anger, even though exact boundaries may not be clear. When performing multitask learning involving both classification and regression, it is helpful to consider the constraints on these values. For example, it would not be valid to predict happiness with a negative valence. The BoLD dataset (Section III-A3) leverages this concept to check the validity of crowdsourced annotations . \n\n\nMethod\nVenue\nAccuracy (%)\n\nSentiBank [ref]200\nACM MM 2013\n44.5\n\nArtistic principles \nACM MM 2014\n46.1\n\nDeepSentiBank \narXiv 2014\n53.2\n\nFine-tuned AlexNet \nNeurIPS 2012\n58.3\n\nFine-tuned VGG-16 \nICLR 2015\n65.5\n\nFine-tuned ResNet-101 \nCVPR 2016\n66.2\n\nPorgressive CNN \nAAAI 2015\n56.2\n\nMldrNet \nNPL 2020\n65.2\n\nWSCNet 7\nCVPR 2018\n70.1\n\nPDANet 6\nACM MM 2019\n72.1\n\nMlrCNN [ref]230\nNEUCOM 2019\n75.5\n\nSAVEAN \nTIP 2021\n72.4\n\nSOLVER \nTIP 2021\n72.3\n\nMDAN \nCVPR 2022\n76.4\n\nSimEmotion \nTAFFC 2022\n80.3\n\n \n\n\nMethod\nVenue\nAccuracy (%)\n\nSentiBank [ref]200\nACM MM 2013\n35.5\n\nE-MDBM \nTMM 2015\n40.4\n\nITE \nTAFFC 2018\n44.7\n\nV.+Au.+At. \nAAAI 2014\n46.1\n\nCFN \nACM MM 2016\n50.4\n\nV.+Au.+At.+E-MDBM \nTMM 2015\n51.1\n\nKernelized [ref]207\nTMM 2018\n49.7\n\nKernelized+SentiBank [ref]207\nTMM 2018\n52.5\n\nVAANet \nAAAI 2020\n54.5\n\nKeyFrame \nMTAP 2021\n52.9\n\nFAEIL [ref]207\nTMM 2021\n57.6\n\nTAM \nACM MM 2022\n57.5\n\nReference markers found: [200]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]200: A variety of machine learning algorithms have been utilized to learn the mapping between the unified representation after feature fusion and evoked emotions.
