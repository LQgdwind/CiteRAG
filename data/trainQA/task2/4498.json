      "content": "Paper Title: On the independence between phenomenal consciousness and computational intelligence\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we will present the analogy postulated bn y Russell about intelligence and consciousness . Broadly speaking, he states that it is highly probable that consciousness is the only cause of the intelligent behaviour that humans exhibit. It does so by supposing that if the behaviour of people is similar to our own, then, by observation, we can establish a causal relation that the other people possess consciousness as we do. Literally, from the Analogy of Russell, we have that: ”We are convinced that other people have thoughts and feeling that are qualitatively fairly similar to our own…it is clear that we must appeal to something that may be vaguely called analogy. The behavior of other people is in many ways analogous to our own, and we suppose that is must have analogous causes. What people say is what we should say if we had certain thoughts, and so we infer that they probably have these thoughts… As it is clear to me that the causal laws governing my behavior have to do with thoughts… how do you know that the gramophone does not think? … it is probably impossible to refute materialism by external observation alone. If we are to believe that there are thoughts and feelings other than our own, that must be in virtue of some inference in which our own thoughts and feelings are relevant… establish a rational connection between belief and data…From subjective observation I know that A, which is a thought or feeling, causes B, which is a bodily act, whatever B is an act of my own body, A is its cause. I now observe an act of the kind B in a body not my own, and I am having no thought or feeling of the kind A. But I still believe on the basis of self-observation, that only A can cause B. I therefore infer that there was an A which caused B, though it was not an A that I could observe.” Consquently, at least probabilistically, we can infer from the text that behaviour is a cause of consciousness, although we can not observe consciousness. As behaviour is a cause of intelligence, we can infer that intelligence is an effect of consciousness, being a causal relation. However, the previous reasoning is a fallacy, as it deals with the assumption that the intelligent behaviour of any agent shares the same causes as our behaviour, which as he writes in multiple times in the text, is the mind. For instance, the DALLE-2 model generates artistic images but if we assume that the multiple realizability postulate is false, then, it is not conscious, so consciousness is not the cause of its behavior. In other words, it seems that the analogy reasoning involves more correlation that causality. Here the confounder would be that both my behaviour and the behaviour of the DALLE-2 model are both the result of a human intent. From a classical logic point of view, he states that every living being produces intelligent behavior, applying modus ponens. However, applying modus tollens if a being does not exhibit intelligent behavior outside, then it would be no conscious, at least, from a probabilistic point of view, probably. This fact that is a consequence of applying the analogy reasoning has dramatic consequences that will be analyzed in further sections. Moreover, he states that a rational connection between belief, consciousness, and data, behaviour, must be set. Therefore, consciousness would be the cause of intelligence, at least from a computational point of view. Also, we cannot establish a causal relation by performing such an experiment based on analogy alone. In that particular experiment, we observe that a subject is intelligent and we infer that he is conscious. First, we do not have any control group in this experiment, being what is known in science and in a plethora of disciplines such as psychology or econometrics a pre-experiment, an experiment where we are not able to infer a causal relation between the dependent variable, being conscious, and the independent variable, showing an intelligent behaviour. In addition, we have several other problems, as we will detail in this work. First, dealing with several syndromes and illnessess. Let us examine a person suffering from severe autism, this person may not show an intelligent behaviour, hence, following the argument of Russell, there is, at least, a high likelihood that this person is not conscious. We believe and will add theoretical evidence that this is not true, showing clear empirical cases where a phenomenal conscious human being does not exhibit an intelligent behaviour. Moreover, the same happens with other syndromes such as Down. Having shown that there are phenomenally conscious human beings that do not exhibit intelligent behaviour according to several estimates or that its computational intelligence can not be compared to the ones of computers, we provide another counter-example to the analogy, coming from the field of artificial intelligence . In particular, we have seen how, in recent years, due to methodological advantages such as deep learning  and the rise of computational power, intelligent systems have surpassed human abilities in a series of complex games. Some examples include AlphaGo winning at the Go game to the world champion , IBM Watson winning at Jeopardy  and discovering new unknown chess strategies with deep learning [ref]39. General intelligence is a broad property, in the ontological sense, but we can reduce its meaning and provide a definition for a subset of it. In particular, we can epistemologically measure it as a function of the proportion of the computational problems that a system can solve from the set of all computational problems. Following this lower bound of general intelligence, a system implementing all the known machine learning models and meta models of them able to solve any task with sufficient data will, for sure, outperform the performance of human beings in a broad series of problems and even solve problems that we do not know how to solve, like the protein folding problem . As a consequence, following the analogy of Russell, it would be highly likely that a system that implements these algorithms would be conscious. It would be even more probable that such a system is conscious that any other human being. However, as we will further show, providing multi-disciplinary arguments, the likelihood that a Turing machine, that is essentially any known software being executed by a computer, is conscious is almost zero. Hence, the evidence given by the data shows that the hypothesis that there is a causal relation between intelligence and consciousness is fallacious. Finally, as an extreme argument, if we measure the computational intelligence of a severe autistic person with respect to a system implementing several methodologies such as AlphaGo, the difference in intelligence, measured for example with the intelligence quotient would be even higher, however, and also with theoretical and empirical evidence coming from the global workspace theory , the severe autistic person is conscious and the system is not. If we follow this argument, we discover that it is more probable that intelligence and consciousness are just independent variables. In this paper, we will slowly give arguments that support this claim. Bayesian modelling of the analogy. The correlation between intelligence and phenomenal consciousness is positive and strong, near to 111. That is, the conditional probability (C) that an entity possesses consciousness given that is intelligent (I) is close to 1 p​(C/I)≈1𝑝𝐶𝐼1p(C/I)\\approx 1. . Implies a measure of consciousness and intelligence.  Consciousness cannot be measured with the current scientific method. (Include citations) Moreover, can we measure, or even define, intelligence? At least, can we even define different types of intelligence?\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: series of complex games.
