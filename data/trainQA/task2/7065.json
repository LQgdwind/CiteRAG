These works heavily relied on structure theorems for complete intersection ideals generated by pairs of quadrics or cubics, and the arguments crucially used that the degree of the forms is 222 or 333. In general one can not hope for such characterizations for ideals of arbitrary degree. We vastly generalize the methods and ideas of   to work over strong quotient rings and our proof is completely new as we do not rely on such structure theorems. Some of the results in Section¬†4 of this paper are similar to the results in , where the authors proved weaker versions for irreducible forms in polynomial rings. We generalize these results to reducible forms in strong quotient UFDs. Furthermore, our definition of strong algebras Section¬†5 is a robust generalization of wide vector spaces in . The notion of wide vector spaces worked in degree at most 222 and were specifically tailored to work with SG configurations. Our general definition of strong algebras is more conceptual and the results generalizing  in this paper are of independent interest. In recent years, we have seen remarkable progress on the PIT problem for constant depth circuits.\nIn 3, the authors give a deterministic quasi-polynomial time algorithm for blackbox PIT for depth 4 circuits with bounded top and bottom fanins.\nTheir approach is analytic in nature, allowing them to bypass the need of Sylvester-Gallai configurations.\nIn , the authors give a deterministic weakly-exponential algorithm for PIT for these circuits via the hardness vs randomness paradigm for constant depth circuits .\nThe hardness result for the determinant, proved by , coupled with techniques from , also yields another weakly-exponential time black-box PIT for constant-depth circuits, as is shown in [1, Section 6]. Despite all the formidable progress above mentioned, the Sylvester-Gallai type approach of 5 is the only one so far which could yield deterministic polynomial-time black-box PIT algorithms for depth-4 circuits with constant top and bottom fanins.\nIn [ref]51, this Sylvester-Gallai type approach was carried out for depth-4 circuits with top fanin 3 and bottom fanin 2.\n\nReference markers found: [51]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]51: the Sylvester-Gallai type approach of 5 is the only one so far which could yield deterministic polynomial-time black-box PIT algorithms for depth-4 circuits with constant top and bottom fanins.\nIn [ref]51, this Sylvester-Gallai type approach was carried out for depth-4 circuits with top fanin 3 and bottom fanin 2.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
