Besides variable misuse bugs studied in this paper, neural networks have been used to detect other types of bugs, such as operand swapping [ref]15, wrong binary operator [ref]15 [ref]41 , and identifying wrong argument or return values of a function  . Most of the work adapts the strategy of joint learning of detection and repair of the program together [ref]16. The predominant models utilized for bug detection can be broadly categorized into Transformers, GNNs, and hybrid methods . Transformers process programs as sequences of tokens, with the flexibility of being either trained from scratch  or fine-tuned (e.g., CuBERT , CodeBERT , GraphCodeBERT , UnixCoder , etc.). GNN models, on the other hand, interpret programs in the form of graphs featuring diverse edges such as control flow, data flow, etc. . Hybrid approaches combine both models. For example, GREAT  combines the transformer architecture with edge types from the program graph. The sandwich model  alternates between transformer layers and graph neural layers, forming a cohesive approach. This paper explores a range of models including CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, UnixCoder, GGNN, and GREAT, thereby encompassing the entire spectrum of commonly employed approaches for bug detection. Due to the lack of real-world bugs, training on real-world bugs alone is typically not sufficient to obtain a high-performing bug detector [ref]41 . As a result, many approaches have been focused on generating synthetic bugs. The most common approach is to randomly perturb a program with a set of predefined mutation rules  [ref]16. Recent work demonstrates that neural detectors trained on synthetic bugs do not perform well on real-world bugs . This difference in performance can be attributed to the different characteristics between synthetic and real-world bugs  [ref]41. As a result, many studies have experimented with mixing synthetic and real-world bugs in training [ref]41 . At the same time, other approaches attempt to generate synthetic datasets that are more similar to real-world bugs. For example, Richter et al.  use a learning based approach to generate faulty programs taking the context of the original program into account. SemSeed  extracts a set of bug patterns from real-world bugs and applies the pattern most similar to the original program to generate a synthetic bug. Our study takes a different perspective on analyzing the datasets for training NBDs. We investigate how type-checking affects the performance of NBDs and offer recommendations to enhance their practicality when deployed in such scenarios.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: effectiveness of using neural networks for bug detection.
