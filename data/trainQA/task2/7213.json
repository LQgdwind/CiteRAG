      "content": "Paper Title: Exact Thresholds for Noisy Non-Adaptive Group Testing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCompared to the Bernoulli design, an additional challenge in the near-constant weight design is that a test may receive multiple placements from a single item. We present two high-probability events that prove useful in overcoming this difficulty. ([16, Prop. II.3] and [16, Eq. (40)])\nUnder the near-constant design where each item is uniformly placed (with replacement) to Δ=ν​nkΔ𝜈𝑛𝑘\\Delta=\\frac{\\nu n}{k} tests, we have the following: (a) With 1−o​(1)1𝑜11-o(1) probability, the number of defective items appearing in any test more than once scales at most as O​(log⁡k)𝑂𝑘O(\\log k). (b) With probability at least 1−p−71superscript𝑝71-p^{-7}, the number of tests assigned to precisely one defective item (referred to as a degree-1 test in [ref]16) is given by (1+o​(1))​e−ν​k​Δ1𝑜1superscript𝑒𝜈𝑘Δ(1+o(1))e^{-\\nu}k\\Delta. As another useful technical result, we present the (anti-)concentration of the hypergeometric distribution. The Chernoff bound (upper bound) can be found in , and we expect that the matching lower bound is also known, but we provide a short proof for completeness. If U∼Hg​((1+o​(1))​k​Δ,(1+o​(1))​e−ν​k​Δ,Δ)similar-to𝑈Hg1𝑜1𝑘Δ1𝑜1superscript𝑒𝜈𝑘ΔΔU\\sim\\mathrm{Hg}((1+o(1))k\\Delta,(1+o(1))e^{-\\nu}k\\Delta,\\Delta) with k→∞→𝑘k\\to\\infty, Δ=ν​nkΔ𝜈𝑛𝑘\\Delta=\\frac{\\nu n}{k}, and n=Θ​(k​log⁡k)𝑛Θ𝑘𝑘n=\\Theta(k\\log k), then for a given C∈(0,1)𝐶01C\\in(0,1) such that C​Δ𝐶ΔC\\Delta is an integer, we have By letting k0=(1+o​(1))​ksubscript𝑘01𝑜1𝑘k_{0}=(1+o(1))k and kν=(1+o​(1))​e−ν​ksubscript𝑘𝜈1𝑜1superscript𝑒𝜈𝑘k_{\\nu}=(1+o(1))e^{-\\nu}k\nwe can write U∼Hg​(k0​Δ,kν​Δ,Δ)similar-to𝑈Hgsubscript𝑘0Δsubscript𝑘𝜈ΔΔU\\sim\\mathrm{Hg}(k_{0}\\Delta,k_{\\nu}\\Delta,\\Delta), which implies that Given positive integers m𝑚m and α​m𝛼𝑚\\alpha m for some α∈(0,1)𝛼01\\alpha\\in(0,1), we have π2​G≤(mα​m)≤G𝜋2𝐺binomial𝑚𝛼𝑚𝐺\\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}G\\leq\\binom{m}{\\alpha m}\\leq G where G=exp⁡(m​H2​(α))2​π​m​α​(1−α)𝐺𝑚subscript𝐻2𝛼2𝜋𝑚𝛼1𝛼G=\\frac{\\exp(mH_{2}(\\alpha))}{\\sqrt{2\\pi m\\alpha(1-\\alpha)}} (see Lemma 2), which gives Substituting this into (290), we obtain where (292) follows from 1−Ckν1𝐶subscript𝑘𝜈1-\\frac{C}{k_{\\nu}}, 1−1−Ck0−kν11𝐶subscript𝑘0subscript𝑘𝜈1-\\frac{1-C}{k_{0}-k_{\\nu}}, and 1−1k011subscript𝑘01-\\frac{1}{k_{0}} all behaving as Θ​(1)Θ1\\Theta(1). Now we seek to further simplify 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T}.\nNote that Ckν𝐶subscript𝑘𝜈\\frac{C}{k_{\\nu}}, 1−Ck0−kν1𝐶subscript𝑘0subscript𝑘𝜈\\frac{1-C}{k_{0}-k_{\\nu}}, and 1k01subscript𝑘0\\frac{1}{k_{0}} all scale as o​(1)𝑜1o(1), and it holds for any t=o​(1)𝑡𝑜1t=o(1) that This yields where in (297) we substitute k0=(1+o​(1))​ksubscript𝑘01𝑜1𝑘k_{0}=(1+o(1))k and kν=(1+o​(1))​e−ν​ksubscript𝑘𝜈1𝑜1superscript𝑒𝜈𝑘k_{\\nu}=(1+o(1))e^{-\\nu}k. To complete the proof, we substitute (297) into (292), and then note that the leading factor Θ​(1)C​(1−C)​ΔΘ1𝐶1𝐶Δ\\frac{\\Theta(1)}{\\sqrt{C(1-C)\\Delta}} with fixed C∈[Δ−1,1−Δ−1]𝐶superscriptΔ11superscriptΔ1C\\in[\\Delta^{-1},1-\\Delta^{-1}] (this follows from C∈(0,1)𝐶01C\\in(0,1) and hence 1≤C​Δ≤Δ−11𝐶ΔΔ11\\leq C\\Delta\\leq\\Delta-1) can be written as exp⁡(−o​(Δ))𝑜Δ\\exp(-o(\\Delta)) since Δ=ν​nk=Θ​(log⁡k)→∞Δ𝜈𝑛𝑘Θ𝑘→\\Delta=\\frac{\\nu n}{k}=\\Theta(\\log k)\\to\\infty.\n∎ Next, we present a useful concentration bound analogously to [29, Lem. 1]. We consider 𝒥⊂[p]𝒥delimited-[]𝑝\\mathcal{J}\\subset[p] with |𝒥|=ℓ𝒥ℓ|\\mathcal{J}|=\\ell and use 𝒲(𝒥)superscript𝒲𝒥\\mathcal{W}^{(\\mathcal{J})} to index the tests that contain some item from 𝒥𝒥\\mathcal{J}, with cardinality given by W(𝒥):=|𝒲(𝒥)|.assignsuperscript𝑊𝒥superscript𝒲𝒥W^{(\\mathcal{J})}:=|\\mathcal{W}^{(\\mathcal{J})}|. (Concentration of W(𝒥)superscript𝑊𝒥W^{(\\mathcal{J})})\nGiven 𝒥⊂[p]𝒥delimited-[]𝑝\\mathcal{J}\\subset[p] with |𝒥|=ℓ𝒥ℓ|\\mathcal{J}|=\\ell,\nfor any ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0 we have where the expectation satisfies Moreover, given any δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0, with probability at least 1−2​exp⁡(−2​ν−1​δ2​n)122superscript𝜈1superscript𝛿2𝑛1-2\\exp(-2\\nu^{-1}\\delta^{2}n), we have We first prove (299). We can write\nW(𝒥)=∑i=1n𝟙​(test ​i​ contains some item from ​𝒥),superscript𝑊𝒥superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛1test 𝑖 contains some item from 𝒥W^{(\\mathcal{J})}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\mathbbm{1}(\\text{test }i\\text{ contains some item from }\\mathcal{J}), which leads to where we use log⁡(1−1n)=−1n​(1+o​(1))11𝑛1𝑛1𝑜1\\log(1-\\frac{1}{n})=-\\frac{1}{n}(1+o(1)) in (305). Thus, (299) follows, and to obtain (300) we substitute ℓk=α+o​(1)ℓ𝑘𝛼𝑜1\\frac{\\ell}{k}=\\alpha+o(1) if ℓk→α∈(0,1]→ℓ𝑘𝛼01\\frac{\\ell}{k}\\to\\alpha\\in(0,1], or 1−exp⁡(−β)=β​(1+o​(1))1𝛽𝛽1𝑜11-\\exp(-\\beta)=\\beta(1+o(1)) as β→0→𝛽0\\beta\\to 0 if ℓk=o​(1)ℓ𝑘𝑜1\\frac{\\ell}{k}=o(1). Next, we establish (298). Because the ℓ​ΔℓΔ\\ell\\Delta placements of items in 𝒥𝒥\\mathcal{J} are independent and changing one placement changes the quantity W(𝒥)superscript𝑊𝒥W^{(\\mathcal{J})} by at most one, McDiarmid’s inequality [ref]34 gives for any ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0,\nwhich yields (298) by substituting ℓ​Δ=ν​ℓ​nkℓΔ𝜈ℓ𝑛𝑘\\ell\\Delta=\\frac{\\nu\\ell n}{k}.\nFinally, we show (301) by using (298). To this end, we take ε=δ​n​ℓk𝜀𝛿𝑛ℓ𝑘\\varepsilon=\\delta n\\sqrt{\\frac{\\ell}{k}} in (298), and note that the event in (301) holds true if and only if |W(𝒥)−𝔼​W(𝒥)|<δ​n​ℓksuperscript𝑊𝒥𝔼superscript𝑊𝒥𝛿𝑛ℓ𝑘|W^{(\\mathcal{J})}-\\mathbbm{E}W^{(\\mathcal{J})}|<\\delta n\\sqrt{\\frac{\\ell}{k}}.\n∎ Finally, the following lemma characterizes the probability mass function for the random variable indicating how many tests from a certain subset of [n]delimited-[]𝑛[n] contain items from a certain subset of [p]delimited-[]𝑝[p]. Suppose that the n𝑛n tests are divided into two parts consisting of n1subscript𝑛1n_{1} tests and n2subscript𝑛2n_{2} tests, with the first part and the second part respectively indexed by 𝒩1⊂[n]subscript𝒩1delimited-[]𝑛\\mathcal{N}_{1}\\subset[n] and 𝒩2⊂[n]subscript𝒩2delimited-[]𝑛\\mathcal{N}_{2}\\subset[n], where |𝒩1|=n1subscript𝒩1subscript𝑛1|\\mathcal{N}_{1}|=n_{1}, |𝒩2|=n2subscript𝒩2subscript𝑛2|\\mathcal{N}_{2}|=n_{2}, and n1+n2=nsubscript𝑛1subscript𝑛2𝑛n_{1}+n_{2}=n. Given 𝒥⊂[p]𝒥delimited-[]𝑝\\mathcal{J}\\subset[p] with |𝒥|=ℓ𝒥ℓ|\\mathcal{J}|=\\ell, consider the ℓ​Δ=ℓ​ν​nkℓΔℓ𝜈𝑛𝑘\\ell\\Delta=\\frac{\\ell\\nu n}{k} placements of the ℓℓ\\ell items in 𝒥𝒥\\mathcal{J}, and let M𝑀M be the number of tests in 𝒩2subscript𝒩2\\mathcal{N}_{2} that contain some item from 𝒥𝒥\\mathcal{J}. Then for any 0≤m≤ℓ​Δ0𝑚ℓΔ0\\leq m\\leq\\ell\\Delta, we have where the probability is with respect to the randomness in placing each item from 𝒥𝒥\\mathcal{J} in Δ=ν​nkΔ𝜈𝑛𝑘\\Delta=\\frac{\\nu n}{k} tests chosen uniformly at random with replacement. Our argument builds on [29, Sec. IV-C], which characterizes a similar distribution (for different purposes) under the near-constant weight design. Our Lemma 8 generalizes the one therein in two ways. First, we consider the placement of ℓℓ\\ell items, while [29, Lemma 4] only concerns the case that ℓ=1ℓ1\\ell=1. Second, our statement is more general since we leave 𝒩1subscript𝒩1\\mathcal{N}_{1} and 𝒩2subscript𝒩2\\mathcal{N}_{2} unspecified, while [29, Lemma 4] concerns a more specific choice. As was done in , we make use of the Stirling numbers of the second kind, defined as {nk}:=1k!​∑j=0k(−1)k−j​(kj)​jnassignFRACOP𝑛𝑘1𝑘superscriptsubscript𝑗0𝑘superscript1𝑘𝑗binomial𝑘𝑗superscript𝑗𝑛\\genfrac{\\{}{\\}}{0.0pt}{}{n}{k}:=\\frac{1}{k!}\\sum_{j=0}^{k}(-1)^{k-j}\\binom{k}{j}j^{n}, e.g., see [31, P. 204]. The probability of the event that exactly u𝑢u placements fall in 𝒩1subscript𝒩1\\mathcal{N}_{1} is ℙ​(Bin​(ℓ​Δ,n1n)=u)ℙBinℓΔsubscript𝑛1𝑛𝑢\\mathbb{P}\\big{(}\\mathrm{Bin}(\\ell\\Delta,\\frac{n_{1}}{n})=u\\big{)}. Conditioning on this event, we need to calculate the probability that the remaining ℓ​Δ−uℓΔ𝑢\\ell\\Delta-u placements are at m𝑚m distinct tests in 𝒩2subscript𝒩2\\mathcal{N}_{2}. Evidently, we require ℓ​Δ−u≥mℓΔ𝑢𝑚\\ell\\Delta-u\\geq m, or equivalently u≤ℓ​Δ−m𝑢ℓΔ𝑚u\\leq\\ell\\Delta-m, in order to have M=m𝑀𝑚M=m. Note that there are overall n2ℓ​Δ−usuperscriptsubscript𝑛2ℓΔ𝑢n_{2}^{\\ell\\Delta-u} possibilities for performing ℓ​Δ−uℓΔ𝑢\\ell\\Delta-u placements in n2subscript𝑛2n_{2} tests. By a standard counting argument, we can choose these m𝑚m distinct tests with (n2m)binomialsubscript𝑛2𝑚\\binom{n_{2}}{m} ways, then {ℓ​Δ−um}FRACOPℓΔ𝑢𝑚\\genfrac{\\{}{\\}}{0.0pt}{}{\\ell\\Delta-u}{m} ways of arranging the ℓ​Δ−uℓΔ𝑢\\ell\\Delta-u placements into these m𝑚m unlabelled bins (which represent the m𝑚m tests) such that none of them are empty, and finally m!𝑚m! different labellings of the bins. These findings give We bound ΦΦ\\Phi as follows: where we use a change of the variable t=ℓ​Δ−m−u𝑡ℓΔ𝑚𝑢t=\\ell\\Delta-m-u in (310), {t+mm}≤(t+mm)​mtFRACOP𝑡𝑚𝑚binomial𝑡𝑚𝑚superscript𝑚𝑡\\genfrac{\\{}{\\}}{0.0pt}{}{t+m}{m}\\leq\\binom{t+m}{m}m^{t} [ref]36 in (311), (ℓ​Δm+t)​(t+mm)=(ℓ​Δm)​(ℓ​Δ−mt)binomialℓΔ𝑚𝑡binomial𝑡𝑚𝑚binomialℓΔ𝑚binomialℓΔ𝑚𝑡\\binom{\\ell\\Delta}{m+t}\\binom{t+m}{m}=\\binom{\\ell\\Delta}{m}\\binom{\\ell\\Delta-m}{t} in (312), and ∑t=0ℓ​Δ−m(ℓ​Δ−mt)​(mn1)t=(1+mn1)ℓ​Δ−msuperscriptsubscript𝑡0ℓΔ𝑚binomialℓΔ𝑚𝑡superscript𝑚subscript𝑛1𝑡superscript1𝑚subscript𝑛1ℓΔ𝑚\\sum_{t=0}^{\\ell\\Delta-m}\\binom{\\ell\\Delta-m}{t}\\big{(}\\frac{m}{n_{1}}\\big{)}^{t}=\\big{(}1+\\frac{m}{n_{1}}\\big{)}^{\\ell\\Delta-m} in (313); finally, in (314), C:=(1+mn1)ℓ​Δ−massign𝐶superscript1𝑚subscript𝑛1ℓΔ𝑚C:=(1+\\frac{m}{n_{1}})^{\\ell\\Delta-m} is bounded by Substituting (310) back into (307), we obtain where we use (n2m)​m!≤n2mbinomialsubscript𝑛2𝑚𝑚superscriptsubscript𝑛2𝑚\\binom{n_{2}}{m}m!\\leq n_{2}^{m} in (317), (315) in (318), and the Chernoff bound (see (23) in Lemma 1) in (319).
