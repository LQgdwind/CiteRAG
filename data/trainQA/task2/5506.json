      "content": "Paper Title: Enhancing SMT-based Weighted Model Integration by Structure Awareness\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere is a growing interest in the artificial\nintelligence community in extending probabilistic reasoning\napproaches to deal with hybrid domains, characterized by both\ncontinuous and discrete variables and their relationships. Indeed,\nhybrid domains are extremely common in real-world scenarios,\nfrom transport modelling¬† to\nprobabilistic robotics¬† and\ncyber-physical systems¬†. Early approaches to hybrid probabilistic modelling relied on\ndiscretization of the continuous\nvariables¬†  or\nmade strong distributional assumptions, not allowing to\ncondition discrete variables on continuous ones¬†.\nLater approaches, like hybrid Markov random fields¬† and hybrid sum-product networks¬†[ref]9 , were still unable to support deterministic relations, i.e., hard constraints, between variables, severely limiting their usability in real-world applications. Weighted Model Integration (WMI)¬†   recently emerged as a unifying formalism for probabilistic inference in hybrid\ndomains, thanks to its expressivity, flexibility and its natural support for both deterministic and probabilistic relations. The paradigm extends Weighted Model Counting\n(WMC)¬†, which is the task of computing the weighted\nsum of the set of satisfying assignments of a propositional formula,\nto deal with SMT formulas¬†(e.g.,¬†) consisting of combinations of Boolean atoms and\nconnectives with symbols from a background theory, like linear\narithmetic over rationals (‚Ñí‚Äã‚Ñõ‚Äãùíú‚Ñí‚Ñõùíú\\mathcal{LRA}). Although WMC can be made extremely efficient by leveraging component\ncaching techniques¬† , these\nstrategies are difficult to apply for WMI due to the tight coupling\ninduced by arithmetic constraints. Indeed,\nexisting component caching approaches for WMI are\nrestricted to fully factorized densities with few dependencies among continuous variables¬†. Another\ndirection specifically targets acyclic¬†[ref]19 0 or\nloopy¬†1 pairwise\nmodels. Approximations with guarantees can be computed\nfor problems in disjunctive normal\nform¬†2 or, in restricted cases,\nconjunctive normal form¬†3. Exact solutions for more general classes of densities and\nconstraints mainly take advantage of advances in SMT\ntechnology  or knowledge\ncompilation (KC)¬†4.\nWMI-PA¬† 5\nrelies on SMT-based Predicate Abstraction\n(PA)¬†6 to both reduce the number of models\nto be generated and integrated over and efficiently enumerate them,\nand was shown to achieve substantial improvements over previous\nsolutions.\nNevertheless, in this paper we show how WMI-PA has the major\ndrawback of ignoring the conditional structure of the weight function,\nwhich prevents from pruning away lots of redundant models.\nThe use of KC for hybrid probabilistic inference\nwas pioneered by¬†7 and further refined in a series of\nlater\nworks¬†8 9 0 1. By\ncompiling a formula into an algebraic circuit, KC\ntechniques can exploit the structure of the problem to reduce the size\nof the resulting circuit, and are at the core of many state-of-the-art\napproaches for WMC¬†.\nNevertheless, in this paper we\nshow that even the most recent KC\nsolutions for WMI¬†9 0 have serious\ntroubles in dealing with densely coupled problems, resulting in\nexponentially large circuits that are impossible to\nstore or prohibitively expensive to evaluate. To address these problems, in this paper we introduce Structure-Aware Enumeration for WMI (SAE4WMI),\na novel algorithm for WMI that aims to\ncombine the best of both worlds, by introducing weight-structure\nawareness into PA-based WMI.\nThe main idea is to build a formula, which we call the conditional skeleton, which mimics the\nconditional structure of the weight function, to drive the\nSMT-based enumeration algorithm preventing it from generating\nredundant models.\nAn extensive experimental evaluation of synthetic\nand real-world datasets show substantial computational advantages of\nthe proposed solution over existing alternatives for the most\nchallenging settings. Parallel to the introduction of weight-structure awareness, we highlight how PA-based algorithms are agnostic to the integration algorithm chosen to compute the volume of each enumerated assignment. To this extent, we extend SAE4WMI to support both exact numerical integration (the one implicitly embedded in¬† 5) and approximate integration. The advantages of using approximate integration are twofold: it positively affects the scalability of SAE4WMI with complex instances when integration is the major bottleneck; (ii) it allows applying SAE4WMI to problems with non-polynomial weight functions (e.g., Gaussian densities), increasing the applicability of WMI to real-world scenarios. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows: We analyse existing state-of-the-art of WMI and we identify major efficiency issues for both PA and\nKC-based approaches. We introduce SAE4WMI, a novel WMI algorithm\nthat combines PA with weight-structure awareness by generating explicitly\na conditional skeleton of the weight function to drive\nthe search of assignments.\n We show how SAE4WMI achieves substantial\nimprovements over existing solutions in both synthetic and real-world settings. We demonstrate how PA-based approaches can deal\nwith different integration techniques, both exact and\napproximate, substantially expanding the set of problems that\ncan be tackled by WMI technology. We present a prototypical application of SAE4WMI to verifying the fairness of probabilistic programs. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We start by presenting the related work in ¬ß2. In¬†¬ß3 we introduce the background, focusing on the formulation of Weighted\nModel Integration. In¬†¬ß4 we analyse the WMI\napproaches based on knowledge compilation and on Predicate\nAbstraction, identifying some weaknesses for either of them. In ¬ß5 we address the gaps mentioned in the\nprevious section, showing theoretical ideas to make WMI-PA\nstructure aware and their implementation into our novel algorithm, SAE4WMI. ¬ß6 is devoted to an empirical evaluation of\nSAE4WMI with respect to the other existing approaches, considering\nboth synthetic and real-world settings. In ¬ß7, we highlight how PA-based approaches are agnostic to the integrator chosen to compute the volume of the polytopes and propose an adaptation of the algorithm to deal with approximate integration. Our conclusion and\nfinal considerations are presented in ¬ß8.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: or\nmade strong distributional assumptions, not allowing to\ncondition discrete variables on continuous ones¬†.\nLater approaches, like hybrid Markov random fields¬† and hybrid sum-product networks¬†[ref]9 , were still unable to support deterministic relations, i.e., hard constraints, between variables, severely limiting their usability in real-world applications.
