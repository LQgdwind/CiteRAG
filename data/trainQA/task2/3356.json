      "content": "Paper Title: Communication-Efficient Stochastic Zeroth-Order Optimization for Federated Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the rapid advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT), a massive amount of data is generated and collected by various edge devices (e.g., sensors, smart phones). Because of the limited radio spectrum resource and increasing privacy concerns, gathering geographically distributed data from a large number of edge devices into a cloud server to enable cloud artificial intelligence (AI) may not be practical. To this end, edge AI has recently been envisioned as a promising AI paradigm .\nUnlike cloud AI that relies on a cloud server to conduct centralized training, edge AI exploits the computing power of multiple edge devices to perform model training with their own local data in a distributed manner.\nFederated learning (FL) , as a representative edge AI framework, enables multiple edge devices to collaboratively train a shared model without exchanging their local data, which effectively alleviates the communication burden and privacy concerns. Nowadays, FL has found application in various fields, including autonomous driving , recommendation systems [ref]4, healthcare informatics , etc. As a result of the popularity of FL, the federated optimization problem for model training has attracted a growing body of attention from both academia and industry in recent years. Various algorithms have been proposed to attain a fast convergence rate and reduce the communication load, including both first- (e.g., FedAvg , FedPD , FedNova ) and second-order algorithms (e.g., FedDANE ).\nMost existing algorithms rely on gradient and/or Hessian information to solve the federated optimization problem.\nHowever, such information cannot be obtained in scenarios where the analytic expressions of the loss functions are unavailable, such as federated hyperparameter tuning  or distributed black-box attack of deep neural networks (DNN) 0.\nIn other words, existing algorithms cannot tackle federated optimization problems when gradient information is not available.\nThis motivates us to develop a communication-efficient federated zeroth-order optimization algorithm that does not require gradient or Hessian information. Parallel with the research on algorithm design for FL, the implementation of FL over wireless networks is also an emerging research topic. Random channel fading and receiver noise raise unique challenges for the training of FL over wireless networks.\nGuaranteeing the learning performance with limited radio resource is a challenging task, which requires the joint design of the learning algorithm and communication strategy. Along this line of research,\nthe authors in\n1 studied the joint resource allocation and edge device selection to enhance learning performance.\nBoth studies adopted the orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme, where the number of edge devices that can participate in each communication round is restricted by the number of available time/frequency resource blocks.\nThe limited radio resource turns out to be the main performance bottleneck of wireless FL.\nFortunately, over-the-air computation (AirComp), as a non-orthogonal multiple access scheme, allows concurrent transmissions over the same radio channel to enable low-latency and spectrum-efficient wireless data aggregation 2 3 4, thereby mitigating the communication bottleneck 5.\nMotivated by this observation, various AirComp-assisted FL algorithms were proposed in 6 7 8 to achieve fast model aggregation, wherein all of them adopted first-order optimization algorithm.\nThere still lacks a thorough investigation on AirComp-assisted FL with zeroth-order optimization.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: local data, which effectively alleviates the communication burden and privacy concerns. Nowadays, FL has found application in various fields, including autonomous driving , recommendation systems [ref]4, healthcare informatics , etc. As a result of the popularity of FL, the federated optimization problem for model training has attracted a growing body of attention from both academia and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
