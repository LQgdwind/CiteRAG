      "content": "Paper Title: Book Embeddings of ùëò-Map Graphs Supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), grant Br835/20-1.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA pùëùp-page book embedding of a graph consists of a\nlinear ordering of the vertices, which is defined by placing\nthem from left to right, and an embedding of the edges in\npùëùp pages, such that there is no conflict in any\npage. For two vertices uùë¢u and vùë£v, let u<vùë¢ùë£u<v if uùë¢u precedes vùë£v in\nthe linear ordering and let u‚â§vùë¢ùë£u\\leq v if u<vùë¢ùë£u<v or u=vùë¢ùë£u=v.\nIf u‚â§xùë¢ùë•u\\leq x, then two edges (u,v)ùë¢ùë£(u,v) and (x,y)ùë•ùë¶(x,y)\ntwist or cross if\nu<x<v<yùë¢ùë•ùë£ùë¶u<x<v<y. They nest if u‚â§x<y‚â§vùë¢ùë•ùë¶ùë£u\\leq x<y\\leq v and are\ndisjoint if u<v‚â§x<yùë¢ùë£ùë•ùë¶u<v\\leq x<y. There is a conflict\nin a page if any two edges twist that are embedded in the page.\nFor sets of vertices UùëàU and WùëäW let U<WùëàùëäU<W if u<wùë¢ùë§u<w for all u‚ààUùë¢ùëàu\\in U\nand w‚ààWùë§ùëäw\\in W.\nAn interval [u,w]ùë¢ùë§[u,w]\nconsists of all vertices vùë£v with u‚â§v‚â§wùë¢ùë£ùë§u\\leq v\\leq w. Vertex vùë£v is\noutside the interval if v‚â§uùë£ùë¢v\\leq u or v‚â•wùë£ùë§v\\geq w. Thus the\nvertices on the boundary are both in and outside. Obviously, two edges\ndo not twist if there is an interval such that both vertices of one\nof them are in and the vertices of the other edge are outside the\ninterval. If UùëàU is a set of vertices, then let [U]delimited-[]ùëà[U] be th interval\nthat contains exactly the vertices of UùëàU. For w<Uùë§ùëàw<U let [w,U]ùë§ùëà[w,U]\ndenote the interval w‚â§v‚â§uùë§ùë£ùë¢w\\leq v\\leq u for u‚ààUùë¢ùëàu\\in U.\nAn interval [U,w]ùëàùë§[U,w] is defined accordingly. The book thickness of a graph Gùê∫G is the minimum number of\npages in all book embeddings of Gùê∫G. Book thickness is also known as\nstacknumber or pagenumber  .\nIt has been been studied in areas such as Graph\nTheory, Graph Algorithms, and Graph Drawing. The book thickness\nof nùëõn-vertex graphs with mùëöm edges is at most mùëö\\sqrt{m}\n and at least ‚åàm‚àínn‚àí3‚åâùëöùëõùëõ3\\lceil\\frac{m-n}{n-3}\\rceil\n.\nThe complete graph KnsubscriptùêæùëõK_{n} has book\nthickness ‚åàn/2‚åâùëõ2\\lceil n/2\\rceil .\nEvery nondiscrete outerplanar graph has\nbook thickness one. A graph has book thickness at most two\nif and only if it is a subgraph of a planar graph with a Hamiltonian\ncycle . Every planar graph has book thickness at\nmost four. The upper bound has been shown by Yannakakis\n by a linear time algorithm that\nconstructs a 4-page book embedding of a planar graph. Recently,\nBekos et al.¬†[ref]3 and Yannakakis \nhave shown that some planar graphs need four pages, so that the bound is tight. There are several approaches to extend the planar graphs, for\nexample by drawings on surfaces of higher genus ,\nforbidden minors , drawings in the plane with\nrestrictions on crossings , or\ngeneralized adjacency relations .\nGraphs with bounded genus have constant book thickness .\nAlso minor-closed graphs, e.g., graphs with constant tree-width,\nhave constant book thickness .\nA graph is (g,k)ùëîùëò(g,k)-planar if it can be drawn on a surface of Euler genus at\nmost gùëîg with at most kùëòk crossings per edge\n. Clearly, (0,0)00(0,0)-planar graphs are\nthe planar graphs and (0,k(0,k)-planar graphs are known as\nkùëòk-planar graphs . An nùëõn-vertex\n(g,k)ùëîùëò(g,k)-planar graph with fixed gùëîg and kùëòk has book thickness\nO‚Äã(log‚Å°n)ùëÇùëõO(\\log n) .\nFor kùëòk-planar graphs, this improves the O‚Äã(n)ùëÇùëõO(\\sqrt{n}) bound from\n to O‚Äã(log‚Å°n)ùëÇùëõO(\\log n). Bekos¬†et\nal.¬† have shown that the book thickness of 1-planar\ngraphs is constant and that 39 pages suffice. Recently, Bekos et al.¬†[ref]5 [ref]6 \nhave introduced kùëòk-framed graphs that consist of\na planar graph with faces of degree at most kùëòk, such that\nthere are crossed edges in the interior of each faces. They\nallow crossed multi-edges but no multi-edges in the frame. The\nlatter admit smaller faces, for example for 1-planar graphs. A\nframed multigraph is maximal if every face fùëìf of degree kùëòk\ninduces a kùëòk-clique by the edges in the boundary and the crossed\nedges in the interior of fùëìf.\nBekos et al.¬†state\na bound of 6‚Äã‚åàk/2‚åâ+56ùëò256\\lceil k/2\\rceil+5 pages for any kùëòk-framed\ngraph, which shall be raised to 6‚Äã‚åàk/2‚åâ+76ùëò276\\lceil k/2\\rceil+7 to correct an error\nin the earlier versions111personal communication by S. Griesbach. A kùëòk-map\nis a partition of the sphere into disc homeomorph regions that are labeled as countries or\nholes, such that at most kùëòk countries meet in a point.\nIt generalizes planar duality by holes and an\nadjacency in a point. The latter admits large cliques. A kùëòk-map\ndefines a kùëòk-map graph with the countries as vertices\nand an edge if and only if two countries meet in at least one\npoint. Map graphs have been introduced by Chen et al.¬†,\nwho have shown that any nùëõn-vertex dùëëd-map graph has at most k‚Äã(n‚àí2)ùëòùëõ2k(n-2)\nedges  and admits a clique of size ‚åä3‚Äãk/2‚åã3ùëò2\\lfloor 3k/2\\rfloor. If kùëòk is small, then kùëòk-map graphs are related to\nkùëòk-planar graphs. Chen et al.¬† have observed that the 2-\nand 3-map graphs are the planar graphs. The 4-map graphs are the\nkite-augmented 1-planar graphs  and the 5-map\ngraphs are the clique-augmented 2-fan-crossing graphs\n. A graph is kite-augmented 1-planar if it has a\ndrawing such that every edge is crossed at most once and a pair of\ncrossed edges induces a K4subscriptùêæ4K_{4}. A graph is clique-augmented\n2-fan-crossing if every edge is crossed at most twice. Moreover, if\nan edge is crossed by two edges, then the crossing edges are\nincident to a common vertex, such that there is a K5subscriptùêæ5K_{5} induced by the\nvertices of the edges involved in the crossings.\nBekos et al.¬†[ref]5 [ref]6 \nhave shown that any kùëòk-map graph is a subgraph of a 2‚Äãk2ùëò2k-framed graph.\nHence, one obtains an upper bound of 6‚Äãk+76ùëò76k+7 for the book thickness of kùëòk-map\ngraphs by their approach.\nMap graphs are simple, but their representations\nallow multi-edges. We show that a graph is the simplification of a\nmaximal kùëòk-framed multigraph if and only if it is a kùëòk-map graph.\nHence, kùëòk-framed multigraphs and kùëòk-map graphs have the same book\nthickness, since multi-edges don‚Äôt matter for book embeddings.\n Our contribution.\nWe establish improved upper an lower bounds on the book thickness of kùëòk-map graphs.\nThe lower bound of ‚åàk/2‚åâùëò2\\lceil k/2\\rceil is raised to ‚åä3‚Äãk/4‚åã3ùëò4\\lfloor 3k/4\\rfloor using larger cliques.\nFor the upper bound, we first show that any kùëòk-map graph is a\nkùëòk-framed multigraph consisting of a planar multigraph with faces of\ndegree at most kùëòk. Then we use a modification of Yannakakis algorithm\nfor the embedding of planar graphs.\nWe introduce block-expansions as a new method for the computation of the vertex\nordering. The embedding of edges is done in two phases.\nFor any 2-level framed multigraph, first,\nonly the edges of the outer cycle, the inner edges, and\nall edges that are incident to the first outer vertex of a face are\nembedded in three pages. The remaining edges of any face of degree kùëòk are embedded in\na set of at most ‚åäk2‚åãùëò2\\lfloor\\frac{k}{2}\\rfloor pages.\nThere is an outerplanar and consistent face-conflict graph, such that two remaining edges\nfrom any two faces do not twist if the faces have the same color. As outerplanar\ngraphs are 3-colorable, any\n2-level kùëòk-framed multigraph can be embedded in 3‚Äã‚åäk/2‚åã+33ùëò233\\lfloor k/2\\rfloor+3 pages. Twice this number suffices for kùëòk-framed\nmultigraphs, where one page can be saved as in Yannakakis\n5-page algorithm , so that we obtain an upper bound\nof 6‚Äã‚åäk/2‚åã+56ùëò256\\lfloor k/2\\rfloor+5.\nIn addition, we show that the\nbook thickness of 1-planar graphs is at most eleven. In the remainder of this paper, we introduce basic notions in\nSection¬†2 and establish the relationship between\nframed multigraphs and map graphs. The book embedding of 2-level\nframed multigraphs is described in Section¬†3. We\nstudy the composition and applications in\nSection¬†4 and state some open problems in\nSection¬†5.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: graph has book thickness at\nmost four.
