Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1.

A naive idea is to use captions from image-caption datasets, such as COCO Captions [ref]1 and LAION [ref]28.\nHowever, these captions are mostly for describing real images, which may not reflect the general interest of generative model users.\nMany “fiction” content can only be created from the imagination of generative model users. There are two recent sources containing user-written prompts.\nDrawBench is a list of prompts proposed in Imagen [ref]24 to evaluate text-to-image generative models.\nIt is a collection of 200 prompts organized into 11 categories, designed to test various aspects of a model’s capabilities.\nHowever, the size only supports the purpose of evaluation.\nDiffusionDB  is a database containing a wide range of user-written prompts and generated images.\nHowever, a significant portion of the prompts in the database is biased towards certain styles.\nFor instance, around 15.0% of the prompts in DiffusionDB include the name “Greg Rutkowski”, 28.5% include “artstation”.\nNote that the effectiveness of these words is highly dependent on the training data of generative models.\nA model trained without images from artstation, or at least without “artstation” in its training prompts, may not respond to such style words.\nIt is unfair to test these models on the biased prompts.\nThere are also conflict contents in these prompts.\nFor example, consider the first prompt in Tab.1, “renaissance oil painting” is conflict with “realism” and “hyper realistic”.\nThese conflicts may confuse annotators in evaluating image-text alignment. We collect three groups of prompts for different purposes: training a preference prediction model, testing a preference prediction model, and benchmarking generative models.\nAll three groups consist of prompts from COCO Captions [ref]1 and prompts from DiffusionDB  cleaned by ChatGPT.\nDetailed statistics will be introduced in Sec. 3.4 and Sec. 7. Prompt cleaning using ChatGPT. To address the above issues, we utilize ChatGPT to rewrite prompts in DiffusionDB .\nThe instruction for ChatGPT is elaborated in Appendix A.\nPrompts for image generation and benchmarking generative models are all cleaned with the same pipeline.\nIn Tab. 1, we show examples of prompts before and after cleaning.\nThe output prompts are clearly written in one sentence with less style words, which are easier for our annotators to understand.\nFig. 3 shows the histogram of NSFW score  distribution before and after cleaned by ChatGPT.\nThe effect is significant for buckets of high NSFW score.\nFig. 3 shows frequencies of certain style words and conflict prompt, where confliction is judged by ChatGPT.\nThe frequency of platform names and artist names decreases, and there are less conflict prompts after cleaning.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Prompt sources.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
