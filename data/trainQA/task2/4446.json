      "content": "Paper Title: 1 Introduction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis curve was described by Dekking  in 198219821982; McKenna  found it in 197819781978, called it “E-curve”, but only published it in 199419941994.\nDekking gave an extensive treatment for the method we apply here, be it in another notation.\nWe have the following translation table for the items he used in his example (4.9). Here we map ⟨1⟩↦(1,0)↦⟨−3⟩maps-todelimited-⟨⟩110maps-todelimited-⟨⟩3\\langle{1}\\rangle\\mapsto(1,0)\\mathrel{\\reflectbox{$\\mapsto$}}\\langle{-3}\\rangle, whereas ⟨4⟩↦(0,1)↦⟨2⟩maps-todelimited-⟨⟩401maps-todelimited-⟨⟩2\\langle{4}\\rangle\\mapsto(0,1)\\mathrel{\\reflectbox{$\\mapsto$}}\\langle{2}\\rangle.\nHence, the isometries used are\nρ=[14−32−3214]=[−3,4,−1,2]𝜌matrix143232143412\\rho=\\begin{bmatrix}1&4&-3&2\\\\\n-3&2&1&4\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}=[-3,4,-1,2], which swaps the columns in the matrix above, and geometrically is the identity, and\nσ=[14−324−123]=[4,3,−2,−1]𝜎matrix143241234321\\sigma=\\begin{bmatrix}1&4&-3&2\\\\\n4&-1&2&3\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}=[4,3,-2,-1], which rotates each column one step downward (in the matrix above), and geometrically is the rotation over π/2𝜋2\\pi/2.\nDekking defined the substitution that we derive using our toolkit. The normalized sequence for Dekking’s Gosper-type curve is\n⟨1,1,2,−1,2,1,2,−1,−1,2,1,1,1,2,1,−2,−2,−1,−2,−2,1,2,1,−2,−2,1,1,2,−1,2,…⟩.112121211211121221221212211212…\\langle{1,1,2,-1,2,1,2,-1,-1,2,1,1,1,2,1,-2,-2,-1,-2,-2,1,2,1,-2,-2,1,1,2,-1,2,\\ldots}\\rangle.\nThis sequence is obtained by ⟨1⟩delimited-⟨⟩1\\langle{1}\\rangle as the start and the substitution \nS​(ι)=(ι,ι,μ​τy,−τ,μ,ι,μ​τy,−τ,−ι,μ​τy,ι,ι,τ,μ,τ,−μ,−μ,−τ,−μ,−μ​τy,τ,μ,ι,−μ​τy,−μ​τy)𝑆𝜄𝜄𝜄𝜇subscript𝜏𝑦𝜏𝜇𝜄𝜇subscript𝜏𝑦𝜏𝜄𝜇subscript𝜏𝑦𝜄𝜄𝜏𝜇𝜏𝜇𝜇𝜏𝜇𝜇subscript𝜏𝑦𝜏𝜇𝜄𝜇subscript𝜏𝑦𝜇subscript𝜏𝑦S(\\iota)=(\\iota,\\iota,\\mu\\tau_{y},-\\tau,\\mu,\\iota,\\mu\\tau_{y},-\\tau,-\\iota,\\mu\\tau_{y},\\iota,\\iota,\\tau,\\mu,\\tau,-\\mu,-\\mu,-\\tau,-\\mu,-\\mu\\tau_{y},\\tau,\\mu,\\iota,-\\mu\\tau_{y},-\\mu\\tau_{y})\nwhere μ=[2,−1]𝜇21\\mu=[2,-1] is the rotation over π/2𝜋2\\pi/2, τy=[1,−2]subscript𝜏𝑦12\\tau_{y}=[1,-2] is the vertical reflection, ι= 𝜄12\\iota=  the identity and −ι=[−1,−2]𝜄12-\\iota=[-1,-2] the inverse. The first two approximants are shown in fig. 20. In fig. 21, we show the derivation of the sequence and the substitution for the 111-curve of this Gosper-type curve.\nIn the drawing on the left, we observe that the primary edge below, ⟨1⟩delimited-⟨⟩1\\langle{1}\\rangle, covers the 5×5555\\times 5 square on its left side.\nTherefore, we determine the mapping between squares and edges in the center image by starting with the (13)13(13) dark gray colored squares with a unique edge.\nEach square contains the direction of its unique edge, ±1,±4plus-or-minus1plus-or-minus4\\pm 1,\\pm 4 if the square is at the left of the directed edge, or ±2,±3plus-or-minus2plus-or-minus3\\pm 2,\\pm 3 otherwise.\nSubsequently, in the middle drawing, the (4)4(4) edges in a unique, light gray colored square we map to the corresponding squares.\nFinally, we similarly treat the (888) remaining unattached edges and white squares, as shown in the drawing rightward to fig. 21.\nThis process leads to the substitution\nS​⟨1⟩=⟨1,1,2,3,4,1,2,3,−1,2,1,1,−3,4,−3,−4,−4,3,−4,−2,−3,4,1,−2,−2⟩𝑆delimited-⟨⟩11123412312113434434234122S\\langle{1}\\rangle=\\langle{1,1,2,3,4,1,2,3,-1,2,1,1,-3,4,-3,-4,-4,3,-4,-2,-3,4,1,-2,-2}\\rangle. If we split Dekking’s ρ𝜌\\rho by the two reflections τy′=[−3,−4,−1,−2]superscriptsubscript𝜏𝑦′3412\\tau_{y}^{\\prime}=[-3,-4,-1,-2] and τx′=[ref]3 [ref]4  superscriptsubscript𝜏𝑥′3412\\tau_{x}^{\\prime}=[ref]3 [ref]4  , and replace his σ𝜎\\sigma by the rotation μ′=[4,3,−2,−1]superscript𝜇′4321\\mu^{\\prime}=[4,3,-2,-1], we see that μ′​τy′​⟨1⟩=⟨2⟩superscript𝜇′superscriptsubscript𝜏𝑦′delimited-⟨⟩1delimited-⟨⟩2\\mu^{\\prime}\\tau_{y}^{\\prime}\\langle{1}\\rangle=\\langle{2}\\rangle, −τy′​⟨1⟩=⟨3⟩superscriptsubscript𝜏𝑦′delimited-⟨⟩1delimited-⟨⟩3-\\tau_{y}^{\\prime}\\langle{1}\\rangle=\\langle{3}\\rangle, and μ′​⟨1⟩=⟨4⟩superscript𝜇′delimited-⟨⟩1delimited-⟨⟩4\\mu^{\\prime}\\langle{1}\\rangle=\\langle{4}\\rangle.\nAs for the substitution S𝑆S, we have S​(φ)=φ​S​(ι)𝑆𝜑𝜑𝑆𝜄S(\\varphi)=\\varphi S(\\iota); for all isometries φ𝜑\\varphi, and we get\nS​(ι)=(ι,ι,μ′​τy′,−τy′,μ′,ι,μ′​τy′,−τy′,−ι,μ′​τy′,ι,ι,τy′,μ′,τy′,−μ′,−μ′,−τy′,−μ′,−μ′​τy′,τy′,μ′,ι,−μ′​τy′,−μ′​τy′)𝑆𝜄𝜄𝜄superscript𝜇′superscriptsubscript𝜏𝑦′superscriptsubscript𝜏𝑦′superscript𝜇′𝜄superscript𝜇′superscriptsubscript𝜏𝑦′superscriptsubscript𝜏𝑦′𝜄superscript𝜇′superscriptsubscript𝜏𝑦′𝜄𝜄superscriptsubscript𝜏𝑦′superscript𝜇′superscriptsubscript𝜏𝑦′superscript𝜇′superscript𝜇′superscriptsubscript𝜏𝑦′superscript𝜇′superscript𝜇′superscriptsubscript𝜏𝑦′superscriptsubscript𝜏𝑦′superscript𝜇′𝜄superscript𝜇′superscriptsubscript𝜏𝑦′superscript𝜇′superscriptsubscript𝜏𝑦′S(\\iota)=(\\iota,\\iota,\\mu^{\\prime}\\tau_{y}^{\\prime},-\\tau_{y}^{\\prime},\\mu^{\\prime},\\iota,\\mu^{\\prime}\\tau_{y}^{\\prime},-\\tau_{y}^{\\prime},-\\iota,\\mu^{\\prime}\\tau_{y}^{\\prime},\\iota,\\iota,\\tau_{y}^{\\prime},\\mu^{\\prime},\\tau_{y}^{\\prime},-\\mu^{\\prime},-\\mu^{\\prime},-\\tau_{y}^{\\prime},-\\mu^{\\prime},-\\mu^{\\prime}\\tau_{y}^{\\prime},\\tau_{y}^{\\prime},\\mu^{\\prime},\\iota,-\\mu^{\\prime}\\tau_{y}^{\\prime},-\\mu^{\\prime}\\tau_{y}^{\\prime}). We project −3↦1maps-to31-3\\mapsto 1 and 4↦2maps-to424\\mapsto 2, and if we apply that, we find that replacing μ′superscript𝜇′\\mu^{\\prime} by μ=[2,−1]𝜇21\\mu=[2,-1], the rotation over π/2𝜋2\\pi/2 in the plane, and τy′,τx′superscriptsubscript𝜏𝑦′superscriptsubscript𝜏𝑥′\\tau_{y}^{\\prime},\\tau_{x}^{\\prime} by τy=[1,−2],τx=[−1,2]formulae-sequencesubscript𝜏𝑦12subscript𝜏𝑥12\\tau_{y}=[1,-2],\\tau_{x}=[-1,2], the vertical and horizontal reflection.\nThe substitution and the resulting sequence then become\nS​(ι)=(ι,ι,μ​τy,−τy,μ,ι,μ​τy,−τy,−ι,μ​τy,ι,ι,τy,μ,τy,−μ,−μ,−τy,−μ,−μ​τy,τy,μ,ι,−μ​τy,−μ​τy),𝑆𝜄𝜄𝜄𝜇subscript𝜏𝑦subscript𝜏𝑦𝜇𝜄𝜇subscript𝜏𝑦subscript𝜏𝑦𝜄𝜇subscript𝜏𝑦𝜄𝜄subscript𝜏𝑦𝜇subscript𝜏𝑦𝜇𝜇subscript𝜏𝑦𝜇𝜇subscript𝜏𝑦subscript𝜏𝑦𝜇𝜄𝜇subscript𝜏𝑦𝜇subscript𝜏𝑦S(\\iota)=(\\iota,\\iota,\\mu\\tau_{y},-\\tau_{y},\\mu,\\iota,\\mu\\tau_{y},-\\tau_{y},-\\iota,\\mu\\tau_{y},\\iota,\\iota,\\tau_{y},\\mu,\\tau_{y},-\\mu,-\\mu,-\\tau_{y},-\\mu,-\\mu\\tau_{y},\\tau_{y},\\mu,\\iota,-\\mu\\tau_{y},-\\mu\\tau_{y}),\n⟨1,1,2,−1,2,1,2,−1,−1,2,1,1,1,2,1,−2,−2,−1,−2,−2,1,2,1,−2,−2,1,1,2,−1,2,…⟩.112121211211121221221212211212…\\langle{1,1,2,-1,2,1,2,-1,-1,2,1,1,1,2,1,-2,-2,-1,-2,-2,1,2,1,-2,-2,1,1,2,-1,2,\\ldots}\\rangle.\nAs Dekking’s Gosper-type curve is normalized from the beginning,\nwe submitted this sequence to the OEIS as A356112. ∎\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: If we split Dekking’s ρ𝜌\\rho by the two reflections τy′=[−3,−4,−1,−2]superscriptsubscript𝜏𝑦′3412\\tau_{y}^{\\prime}=[-3,-4,-1,-2] and τx′=[ref]3 [ref]4  superscriptsubscript𝜏𝑥′3412\\tau_{x}^{\\prime}=[ref]3 [ref]4  , and replace his σ𝜎\\sigma by the rotation μ′=[4,3,−2,−1]superscript𝜇′4321\\mu^{\\prime}=[4,3,-2,-1], we see that\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
