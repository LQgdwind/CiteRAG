      "content": "Paper Title: Google’s Quantum Supremacy Claim: Data, Documentation, and Discussion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe 2019 paper “Quantum supremacy using a programmable\nsuperconducting processor”  claimed that\nGoogle’s Sycamore quantum computer of 53 qubits and depth\n20, performed a certain computation in about 200 seconds, while\na state-of-the-art classical supercomputer\nwould take, according to the Google team’s estimate,\napproximately 10,000 years to perform the same computation.\nGoogle’s Sycamore quantum computer performed a sampling task; that is,\nit generated random bitstrings of length 53,\nwith considerable noise,\nfrom a certain discrete probability distribution supported on all such 253superscript2532^{53} bitstrings.\n(Here, a bitstring refers to a vector with 0,1 entries.)\nThe specific sampling task performed by Google is referred to as random circuit sampling (RCS, for short).\nGoogle’s announcement of quantum supremacy was compared by\nvarious writers (see, e.g., [ref]1) to landmark technological\nachievements such as the Wright brothers’\ninvention of a motor-operated airplane, the launching of Sputnik, and the\nlanding of humans on the moon,\nas well as to landmark scientific achievements\nsuch as Fermi’s demonstration of a nuclear chain reaction,\nthe discovery of the Higgs boson, and the LIGO detection of gravitational waves. In 2020 a team\nfrom the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) claimed 3 that the sampling task\ncomputed by their photonic Jiuzhang quantum computer would take 2.5 billion years\nto perform on a classical supercomputer. USTC’s quantum\ncomputer took about 200 seconds to complete the task. This task is referred to as\nGaussian boson sampling (GBS, for short).\nIn 2021, another team from USTC repeated the\nGoogle RCS experiment with their Zuchongzhi quantum computer of\n60 qubits and depth 24 2 5, and claimed to achieve\nan even stronger form of quantum advantage compared to the Google experiment. The Google experiment represented a very large leap in various aspects of the human ability to control\nnoisy quantum systems. For example, the previous experiment reported by the Google AI team used only nine qubits . This leap is especially impressive in terms of the\ndimensions of the Hilbert space representing a state of the computer\n(from 100–500 dimensions in  to 1016superscript101610^{16} dimensions in .) Google’s quantum supremacy claim is based on two ingredients.\nThe first ingredient is an assertion about the quality of the samples produced by the quantum computer. This quality is described in terms of an important parameter called the fidelity. The second ingredient is an assertion about the difficulty of achieving samples of the same quality by a classical supercomputer. The second assertion, and with it the entire quantum supremacy claim, was largely refuted by research of several groups   4     (among others)\nthat exhibited classical algorithms that are ten\norders of magnitude faster than those used in the Google paper.\nThis was achieved, for example, by Pan, Chen, and Zhang  in 2021.\nOur study concentrates on the first claim dealing with the estimated fidelity of Google’s samples.\n As we have already mentioned, the Google announcement was regarded as a major scientific and technological breakthrough.\nOn its own it gave some evidence that the “strong Church–Turing thesis” had been violated and it was described\nas an ironclad refutation of claims by some scientists (including Kalai)\nthat quantum computation is not possible.\nOf no less importance is the fact that quantum supremacy was considered as a major intermediate step toward\nexhibiting experimentally quantum error-correction codes needed for building larger quantum computers.\nThe announcement of quantum supremacy stirred a great deal of enthusiasm among scientists and in the general public, and\ngarnered significant media attention. It had a substantial impact;\nfor example, following the media attention surrounding the leaking of the quantum supremacy claims\naround September 22, 2019, the value\nof bitcoin (and other digital currencies) sharply dropped by more than 10% and it is a reasonable\npossibility that given the\npotential threat of quantum computers\nto the safety of digital currencies, the quantum supremacy claims caused\nthis drop.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: specific sampling task performed by Google is referred to as random circuit sampling (RCS, for short).\nGoogle’s announcement of quantum supremacy was compared by\nvarious writers (see, e.g., [ref]1) to landmark technological\nachievements such as the Wright brothers’\ninvention of a motor-operated airplane, the launching of Sputnik, and the\nlanding of humans on the moon,\nas well as to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
