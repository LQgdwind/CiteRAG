Safe RL. \nA constrained MDP (CMDP, ) is a popular model for formulating safe RL problems.\nIn the CMDP formulation, an agent needs to maximize the expected cumulative reward while ensuring that the expected cumulative cost is less than a threshold.\nThere has been a number of attempts to solve CMDPs , as represented by constrained policy optimization (CPO ), reward constrained policy optimization , Lagrangian-based actor-critic   , primal-dual policy optimization 3 , and interior-point policy optimization 1.\nAs a recent, closely related work, Ding et al.,  proposed an algorithm with theoretical guarantees in regard to regret and constraint violation for CMDPs with linear structures of transition, reward, and safety.\nIn the previous papers mentioned above, however, a safety constraint is defined over a horizon; hence, they deal with less strict safety constraints than our paper that requires the agent to satisfy safety constraints at every time step.\nThere has been research aimed at guaranteeing safety at every time step in both state-less and stateful settings.\nFor state-less settings, SafeOpt  and Safe-LUCB  were respectively proposed for Bayesian optimization problems and linear stochastic bandit problems.\nFor stateful settings, Turchetta et al., [ref]34 proposed a GP-based SafeMDP algorithm that extends SafeOpt to stateful settings.\nUnder the assumptions of the deterministic transition and regularity of safety, while Turchetta et al., [ref]34 aimed to fully explore the safe region, Wachi et al.,  proposed a GP-based algorithm for maximizing the cumulative reward under safety constraint.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: especially that based on deep neural networks (DNNs), has been one of the main reasons for the success of RL in recent years, and it has attracted more attention in both theory and practice [ref]10 [ref]32.\nGiven the difficulty of theoretical analysis of DNNs, linear MDPs   characterized by linear transition kernels and reward are frequently used due to their tractability.\nThe main\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
