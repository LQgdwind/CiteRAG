      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Robust Bisimulation Metric Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we seek answers to the following questions concerning our main hypotheses: Do the embedding collapse and explosion issues predicted theoretically occur in practice? Do our contributions address these problems? Does our proposed approach preserve the noise-invariance property of bisimulation? How do our proposed improvements interact with each other? How does our method perform compared to prior work, particularly with sparse rewards? To that end, we experiment on several altered classic control tasks from OpenAI Gym [ref]7 by (i) sparsifying the reward signal, and (ii) augmenting the environment state with noisy dimensions, to simulate distractions.\nWe also perform larger scale experiments on two challenging vision-based 3D robotics benchmarks from the DeepMind Control Suite . Sparse Noisy Cartpole‚ÄÖ\nFirst, we modified the Cartpole-v0 task,\nin which an agent tries to keep a pole upright.\nTo increase sparsity, we shrank the angular extent in which the pole must be to earn rewards to 1% of its standard value.\nThen, to mimic distractors, we concatenate an Nm‚Äãdim‚Äã(ùíÆ)subscriptùëÅùëödimùíÆN_{m}\\mathrm{dim}(\\mathcal{S})-dimensional vector sampled from an isotropic Gaussian to the state vector.\n(See Appendix E.1.1 for more details.)\nThe performance of the respective models, as well as other baselines are shown in Fig.¬†2, top row.\nWhile DBC struggles on this task due to the sparsity, the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC, [ref]23) baseline, which does not use BSMs, is able to solve the problem (top-left inset). Our proposed modifications address the embedding explosion problem and perform on-par with the SAC baseline, both when combined and separately. Furthermore, when distractors are introduced\n(top-middle and top-right insets),\nSAC also fails, while our approach combining intrinsic rewards (IR) and robust metric learning still solves the task.\nSee also Appendix E.1.4 for results with Nm=3subscriptùëÅùëö3N_{m}=3. Noisy Mountain Car‚ÄÖ\nWe also consider the classic MountainCarContinuous-v0 task , in its continuous control form (see Appendix E.1.2 for details).\nSince the task was already highly sparse, we modified only the distraction aspect, as in the Cartpole scenario.\nAs shown in Fig.¬†2,\nall methods without IR are unable to solve the task and are stuck with rewards close to zero.\nHowever, DBC with IR is unstable and unable to solve the task either.\nOnly using the normalization allows the agent to succeed;\nfurthermore, the inverse dynamics (ID) regularization improves convergence speed and stability.\nThis trend continues at even higher distraction levels as well\n(see Appendix E.1.4). Sparse Noisy Pendulum‚ÄÖ\nWe also modified the continuous Pendulum-v0 task\nto have a higher degree of sparsity and distraction.\nDue to space constraints, we relegate details to Appendix E.1.3.\nWe find that our method performs on par with DBC,\nbut outperforms SAC in the presence of distractions. DeepMind Control Suite‚ÄÖ\nThe DeepMind Control Suite (DMC)  contains a set of 3D robotics tasks based on the MuJoCo physics simulator . We include results from two DMC tasks, namely, cheetah-run (dim‚Äã(ùíÆ)=18,dim‚Äã(ùíú)=6formulae-sequencedimùíÆ18dimùíú6\\mathrm{dim}(\\mathcal{S}){=}18,\\mathrm{dim}(\\mathcal{A}){=}6) and cartpole-swingup-sparse (dim‚Äã(ùíÆ)=4,dim‚Äã(ùíú)=1formulae-sequencedimùíÆ4dimùíú1\\mathrm{dim}(\\mathcal{S}){=}4,\\mathrm{dim}(\\mathcal{A}){=}1), shown in Figure 3. The former is a common benchmark where Zhang et al. [ref]53 showed that their method performed sub-par in the absence of distractors. The latter is a task we select due to reward sparsity. Similarly to [ref]53, we train for each task with and without natural video distractions, as illustrated in Figure 3. In all cases, our approach performs significantly better than the DBC baseline [ref]53. Without distractors, our method performs competitively with SAC [ref]23, but when distractions are introduced, our approach is slightly more sample-efficient. With these experiments, we verify that our improvements carry over to larger-scale tasks where learning is over raw-pixels.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: interact with each other? How does our method perform compared to prior work, particularly with sparse rewards? To that end, we experiment on several altered classic control tasks from OpenAI Gym [ref]7 by (i) sparsifying the reward signal, and (ii) augmenting the environment state with noisy dimensions, to simulate distractions.\nWe also perform larger scale experiments on two challenging\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
