Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: DN-DETR: Accelerate DETR Training by Introducing Query DeNoising\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMost modern object detection models are based on convolutional networks, which have achieved significant success in recent years. Classical CNN-based detectors can be divided into 222 categories, one-stage, and two-stage methods. Two-stage methods like HTC  and Fast R-CNN [ref]8 first generate some region proposals and then decide whether each region contains an object and do bounding box regression to get a refined box. Ren et al. [ref]18 proposed an end-to-end method that utilizes a Region Proposal Network to predict anchor boxes. In contrast to two-stage methods, one-stage methods, including YOLO900  and YOLOv3 [ref]17 directly predict the offset of real boxes relative to anchor boxes. Though these methods achieve top performance on many datasets, they are sensitive to the way how anchors are generated. In addition, they require some hand-crafted components like non-maximum suppression (NMS) and label assignment rules. Therefore, they suffer from these drawbacks and can not be end-to-end optimized.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: have achieved significant success in recent years.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
