This is because the suitable data scale allows us to reimplement and frequently tune all the models to reach their best performances. On ImageNet100, we pretrain all the approaches for 200 epochs with a batch size 128. We use each approach‚Äôs default optimizer (e.g., LARS¬†[ref]45, SGD) and architecture according to their official codes. Following the protocol in , we firstly pretrain the ResNet-18 with various SSL losses. We then train linear classifier on frozen features out of each pretrained ResNet-18 to evaluate the classification accuracy on test data.

(12) to pretrain the network. We respectively evaluate the linear classification performances on the original baseline models in row ‚Äúwithout UOTA‚Äù of Table 1, and we present each baseline‚Äôs performance with UOTA approach in the row ‚Äú+UOTA‚Äù. The model MoCo-v2* is an additional baseline we implemented by applying the multi-crop augmentation (8 views 2√ó224+6√ó9622246962\\times 224+6\\times 96) and other training techniques from SwAV to MoCo-v2 (LARS optimization, threshold, l‚Äãrùëôùëülr and etc., see supplementary file). Therefore, Table 1 actually covers a broad type of SSL approaches: plain contrasive loss based approach (MoCo-v2); non-contrastive loss with cross view ‚Ñì2subscript‚Ñì2\\ell_{2} norm penalty (BYOL); cluster based multi-view contrastive loss (SwAV, 8 views); and finally contrastive loss with additional augmented views that are trained simultaneously (MoCo-v2*). As Table 1 demonstrates, UOTA is showing evident OOD removal effect with robust performance boost (always ‚â•0.9%absentpercent0.9\\geq 0.9\\% gain) against the potential OOD samples in the training data. Comparison to other related works. We compare with other existing OOD detection techniques, some of which originally proposed for supervised learning scenarios. Focal loss  is a typical algorithm overweighting hard samples during training; In contrast, GCE¬† is shown to be robust against label noises for the supervised learning similar to self-paced raining procedure . MIL-NCE¬† loss is particularly designed for caption-frames misalignments issues in narrated videos, and is tailored for contrastive loss. Debiased contrastive learning¬† (abbreviated in as Debiased in Table 3) only considers removing the sampling bias from the negative samples. In this section, we use MoCo-v2* (defined in previous paragraph) as the baseline model, and implement all the relevant approaches on MoCo-v2* if applicable. We defer the implementation details into the supplementary material. In Table 3, MoCo-v2*+UOTA has achieved the best test accuracy across all the algorithms. Focal loss overweights samples that has the highest loss, thus fails when compared with the baseline model. In contrast, MIL-NCE does not adaptively update the sampling distribution depending on the data, therefore showing an inferior performance than ours. This verifies that OOD issue is indeed a unique issue for the SSL approaches having unique embedded noise structures compared to conventional supervised learning approaches. UOTA outperforms ‚ÄúDebiased‚Äù, which at least shows that addressing the noise issue in positive samples is equally important as in negative samples. While UOTA tries to mute the intrinsic OOD samples from positive, the NDA approach in [ref]37 even considers manually generating OOD samples as negatives. These two methods differ in motivation, but both would be provably shown to result in reduced error bound on the downstream linear classification tasks, as per the discussion in paper . We compare scores reported in [ref]37 by following the ResNet50 training setups of Table 6 in [ref]37. The results are reported in Table 5, showing the effectiveness of both methods while UOTA is relatively better.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: In this section, we compare the result of various SSL approaches pretrained with the ResNet-18 Network [ref]20 on ImageNet100 dataset, a subset of ImageNet1K dataset.
