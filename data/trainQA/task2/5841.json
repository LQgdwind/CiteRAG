      "content": "Paper Title: A Survey of Machine Learning-Based Ride-Hailing Planning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRL is a promising technique for solving the matching problem.\nChen et al.  propose an RL-based solution in which\na deep evaluation network, which is a plain feed-forward neural network, is used to calculate a score for each pair of driver and rider based on the predicted detour distance, vehicle’s seat utilization rate, and profit achieved if they get matched.\nFor each new ride request, the vehicle with the highest score will be assigned to serve the rider.\nWhen the trip of the ride request is finished, the observed reward, i.e., the sum of the increased profit of the driver and, if any, the reduced cost of the rider through sharing the ride with others, is used to guide the learning process of the deep evaluation network.\nAgussurja et al.  formulate the matching problem as a two-stage planning process.\nIn the first stage, ride requests to be scheduled are selected from all the unserved ones, the problem of which is modeled as a Markov Decision Process.\nAn approximated value iteration algorithm is used to learn the value function for the matching actions.\nIn the second stage, the final matching decision is made between the selected ride requests and all vehicles based on the learned value function.\nKullman et al.  apply deep RL to develop matching policies whose decisions leverage the Q-value approximations learned by deep neural networks.\nMulti-hop ride-hailing can improve the efficiency of a ride-hailing system.\nTo find the transfer points for each transferring trip in the multi-hop ride-hailing service, Xu et al.  use a multi-layer feed-forward network to predict the reachable areas of vehicles, based on which the search space of possible vehicle pairs and transfer points for transferring riders is pruned.\nIn this way, the transfer points searching process can be more efficient.\nWang et al.  also consider the scenario where riders are allowed to transfer between vehicles.\nThey leverage RL to learn a policy that estimates the values of all the vehicles, which are then used to compute the optimal matching decisions by integer-linear programming.\nThe lengths of the time-intervals between the matching decisions can have critical impact in the matching outcomes.\nSpecifically, the efficiency of matching may be improved substantially if the matching is delayed by adaptively adjusting the matching time-intervals according to the real-time situation of the riders and drivers.\nWang et al.  find that, if riders are willing to wait for a certain amount of time even if there are available vehicles that can serve them right away, the ride-hailing system can achieve better results, for example, in terms of the total vehicle miles traveled.\nIn their solution,\nthey propose to use an RL policy to decide for each rider, at each time step, whether to conduct matching for her/him, or wait for the next time step.\nSimilarly, Qin et al.  leverage RL in solving the ride-hailing matching problem with dynamic matching time-intervals. Clustering techniques are frequently used in ride-hailing planning.\nHong et al.  propose to use a density-based clustering algorithm, specifically DBSCAN , to identify riders that share similar itineraries based on their historical traveling trajectories.\nTo alleviate the computational overhead caused by the large number of distance queries in the matching process, Zhang et al.  propose a new clustering algorithm that groups the geographical locations in the road network into different clusters.\nThen, the distance between any two nodes is approximated by the distance between the centers of the clusters they belong to.\nShen et al.  propose a spatial-temporal distance metric that measures the similarity of each pair of ride requests.\nThe ride requests are grouped by a clustering process based on the proposed distance metric.\nThen, shared-rides are computed within each group of ride requests.\nAnother clustering algorithm is proposed by  to extract the mobility profiles from riders’ and drivers’ historical itineraries.\nThe matching between riders and drivers is determined based on the similarities between their profiles. An increasing number of collective matching solutions leverage various other ML techniques in planning.\nMost of them take social factors of drivers and riders into consideration .\nTo mitigate the social barriers in the ride-hailing process, especially in shared-rides, Yatnalkar et al.  and Narman et al. [ref]103 use Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict the user social types, e.g., chatty, safety, or punctuality, based on their registered user characteristics.\nRiders with similar social characteristics would be more willing to share a trip.\nLevinger et al.  use a feed-forward neural network to predict rider satisfaction levels according to their profile and trip information.\nThey proposed a stochastic algorithm to compute the matching decision with rider satisfaction level maximization as the objective.\nMontazery and Wilson   propose to take into account the user preference in evaluating the weight (benefit) of the matching between each pair of rider and driver, which is given by their proposed support vector machine-based score function.\nWith the value calculated, the final matching can be obtained by solving an optimization problem in which the sum of the weights of those matched pairs is maximized.\nTang et al.  model various types of information (e.g., driver, rider, travel time, and activity) and their relationships within a ride-hailing system using a Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN) .\nEach driver or rider is projected to a multi-dimensional embedding (vector) using the skip-gram model .\nMoreover, the skip-gram is conducted on node sequences obtained by meta path-based random walks originating from the corresponding node within the HIN .\nThe cosine similarity between the embeddings of each driver-rider pair is then used to identify possible matching.\nZhang et al.  consider a scenario where each rider is assigned to multiple drivers (to improve the order answer rate), and riders are free from having to enter the details of destinations (to improve the user experience).\nThey first leverage historical data to model the probability distribution of destinations of each rider based on his/her departure time and location with Bayesian rules, which is followed by predicting the acceptance probability between the rider and available drivers with logistic regression  and gradient boosted decision tree .\nThey propose a hill climbing-based algorithm to solve the matching problem, which is formulated as an NP-hard combinatorial optimization with maximizing the success rate of matching as the objective.\nSchleibaum and Müller  advocate taking the determinants of user satisfaction and explainable matching decisions into consideration.\nOne of their future studies is to find out whether increasing the explainability can improve user satisfaction level or not. It is worth mentioning that many ML-based collective matching strategies take advantage of the Kuhn-Munkres (KM) bipartite matching algorithm as a component of their decision-making pipelines .\nDrivers and riders are usually regarded as the two sets of vertices in the target bipartite graph.\nTo guide the matching between ride requests and ride offers, Guo et al.  propose spatial-temporal Thermo, which is used to reflect the demand density of different places and times.\nThey use Random Forest Regression  to map multiple features of spatial, temporal, and meteorological dimensions to Thermo.\nThe weight of each pair of driver and rider in the bipartite graph is estimated by Thermo.\nA KM algorithm is then used to calculate the final matching decisions according to the constructed bipartite graph.\nSimilarly, Xu et al.  derive their matching decisions using the KM algorithm.\nIn contrast to , Xu et al.  leverage a policy evaluation algorithm to learn a value function which maps each pair of driver and rider to a score.\nThe KM algorithm calculates the final matching between drivers and riders based on the scores.\nGuo and Xu [ref]118 also conduct the matching planning using the KM algorithm.\nThe weight between each pair of driver and rider is obtained from a value function learned by a convolutional neural network-based Double Q-learning (Double DQN) algorithm [ref]119.\n\nReference markers found: [103]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]103: of them take social factors of drivers and riders into consideration .\nTo mitigate the social barriers in the ride-hailing process, especially in shared-rides, Yatnalkar et al.  and Narman et al. [ref]103 use Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict the user social types, e.g., chatty, safety, or punctuality, based on their registered user characteristics.\nRiders with similar social\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
