      "content": "Paper Title: A Survey of Multimodal Composite Editing and Retrieval\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe categorize diffusion-based methods according to the guidance mechanisms, i.e. mask-based methods  [ref]195     [ref]5 1 , classifier-free methods    8    7, and CLIP-based methods  . Mask-based methods. \nMask-based methods utilize masks to localize specific areas for modification. For instance, Blended Diffusion [ref]5 employs masks for image-text composite editing in either pixel or latent space. Subsequent work  1  [ref]195 has automatic mask generation using cross-attention maps, replacing manual masks with automatic ones. These methods can be further divided into manual mask  [ref]5, automatic mask  [ref]195   , and optional mask 1  approaches. Manual mask.\nGlide  compares CLIP guidance and classifier-free guidance, finding that the latter is preferred for its ability to leverage internal knowledge for guidance, thereby simplifying conditioning processes that classifiers often struggle with. Blended Diffusion [ref]5 combines CLIP guidance with a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to seamlessly blend edited and untouched image regions by introducing noise at various levels. Automatic mask.\nInstructEdit [ref]195 employs automatic masking for precise edits by using ChatGPT and BLIP2  to convert text instructions into a segmentation prompt, input caption, and edited caption, using Grounded Segment Anything, which combines Segment Anything  and Grounded DINO  to generate masks, and using Stable Diffusion  to finalize the edited image. DiffEdit  automatically infers a mask to guide the denoising process in a text-conditioned diffusion model, minimizing unintended edits. Shape-Guided Diffusion 1 generates object masks from prompts and employs Inside-Outside Attention to constrain attention maps. Custom-Edit  customizes diffusion models by optimizing language-relevant parameters and applies P2P  and Null-text inversion techniques  for precise edits. IIR  introduces an Image Information Removal module to preserve non-text-related content while enhancing text-relevant details. Optional mask.\nPRedItOR  employs a Hybrid Diffusion Model (HDM), which uses CLIP embeddings for more accurate inversions and enables structure-preserving edits without needing additional inputs or optimization. SDEdit  edits images by starting the sampling process from a noisy version of the base image. However, this approach is less effective for fine detail restoration, especially when significant pixel-level changes are required. Classifier-free methods. \nClassifer-free methods    8    7 refer to guiding the generation process by directly adjusting the results from both conditional and unconditional model outputs, instead of using a pre-trained classifier to steer the diffusion process.\nTo mitigate overfitting issues when fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models on a single image, SINE  introduces a novel model-based guidance approach built on classifier-free guidance, which distills the knowledge acquired from a model trained on a single image into the pre-trained diffusion model. Prompt-to-Prompt  enhances editing quality by leveraging the visual-semantic data encoded in the intermediate attention matrices of a text-to-image model. However, this technique relies on attention weights, limiting its application to images generated by the diffusion model. MasaCtrl  enhances text-image consistency by transforming traditional self-attention in diffusion models into mutual self-attention. Imagic , a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, begins by optimizing a text embedding to produce images that resemble the input image. InstructPix2Pix  combines the strengths of GPT-3  and Stable Diffusion  to create an image-editing dataset that captures complementary knowledge from both language and images. The success of this training process is highly dependent on the quality of the dataset and the performance of the diffusion model.\nUnitune 8 builds on the idea that image-generation models can be adapted for image editing through fine-tuning on a single image. PTI  designs Prompt Tuning Inversion, an efficient and accurate technique for text-driven image editing. Plug-and-Play 7 is a modern model that utilizes attention maps from intermediate layers to transfer features from one image to another.\nMDP  introduces a framework that delineates the design space for appropriate manipulations, identifying five distinct types: intermediate latent, conditional embedding, cross-attention maps, guidance, and predicted noise. CLIP-based methods.\nDiffuseIT  presents a diffusion-based unsupervised image translation method leveraging disentangled style and content representations. Inspired by the Splicing ViT 6, DiffuseIT incorporates a loss function that utilizes intermediate keys from the multihead self-attention layers of a pre-trained ViT model to guide the DDPM model’s generation process, thereby ensuring content preservation and enabling semantic alterations. DiffusionCLIP  employs a deterministic DDIM noising process to accurately identify the specific noise required to generate the target image.\n\nReference markers found: [195]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]195: We categorize diffusion-based methods according to the guidance mechanisms, i.e. mask-based methods  [ref]195     [ref]5 1 , classifier-free methods    8    7, and CLIP-based methods  . Mask-based methods. \nMask-based methods utilize masks to localize specific areas for modification.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
