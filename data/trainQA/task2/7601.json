      "content": "Paper Title: MKF-ADS: Multi-Knowledge Fusion Based Self-supervised Anomaly Detection System for Control Area Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo further present our advantages, the main characteristics and functionalities of the MKF-ADS are listed in Table  I.\nAccording to the modeling strategies and objectives, these works are divided into Statistical Learning (SL), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL). The majority of studies focus on DL-based and build different objectives, including supervised learning to identify known attacks, and anomaly-based to classify or predict unknown attacks. Intuitively, we find that early research based on SL and ML have similar characteristics that fixed feature extraction patterns     and worrisome performance . In contrast, supervised-based DL is substantially improved by rich feature extraction. For example, CNN extracts spatial features , LSTM extracts temporal features [ref]36, and the attention mechanism models valuable features . Despite this, the shortcomings are evident, e.g., higher computation complexity and limited detection range. When the attention is transferred to anomaly classification, reconstruction modeling aims to attain the deviation score of normal messages  . In general, this technique suffers from significant collection delays. Also, the one-class classifier is a bare-bones migration that always sacrifices the detection ability of known attacks  . In contrast, we tend to regard anomaly detection of IVN as a time-series prediction problem, due to lower collection delay and resisting more attacks. Traditional LSTM-based methods initially prove these advantages 3 . Subsequently, valuable feature extraction was considered to be equally important, but with the same complexity as the previous branch, i.e. the modeling of spatial-temporal features required more encoded components  5. From the perspective of knowledge modeling, it is a fact that SL and ML models only have simple and shallow criteria for detection. The existing DL-based works prove that spatial-temporal features are useful to IDS. Moreover, the contextual features extracted by the transformer-based model have comparable and even superior performance compared to the spatial-temporal ones 7 6. However, we reject this way because of the exponential increase in complexity. Taking into account the complementarity of spatial-temporal and contextual features, the multi-knowledge fused is practical. Most importantly, for deploying IDS in real vehicle systems, lower computation complexity is required to satisfy real-time detection. However, only a limited amount of work has been performed on workstations for simulation testing  . Some works    have performed vehicle-level testing or real-time analysis. Hence, our proposed MKF-ADS constructs a cross-knowledge distillation framework that regards contextual knowledge as a teacher and spatial-temporal knowledge as a student. We hope that the proposed model can capture subtle deviations through enriching knowledge and then identify potential threats. Notably, we introduce fine-pruning to modeling spatial-temporal knowledge, and the reduced capabilities are instructed by contextual knowledge, which is a guarantee for real-time detection. Also, robustness validation is presented by fine-tuning the proposed MKF-ADS.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: and worrisome performance .
