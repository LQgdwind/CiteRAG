      "content": "Paper Title: WaterMAS: Sharpness-Aware Maximization for Neural Network Watermarking\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe deployment of deep neural networks became massive for both industrial and end-user-oriented applications. Such tasks are instantiated in a wide variety of application domains including but not restricted to image/video classification  , object detection , speech recognition and synthesis , and audio-visual content compression . Furthermore, deep neural networks can also serve the purposes of critical tasks, such as autonomous driving for unmanned vehicles .\nComing across with the effort to make such models more and more efficient in their tasks, the interest in protecting their intellectual property rights (IPR) and in verifying their integrity emerged some 7 years ago. On the one hand, these models are costly in terms of human skills and computing resources, and protecting their intellectual rights is not only an ethical issue but also an economic one. On the other hand, such deep models can voluntarily or involuntarily be corrupted, resulting in the malfunctioning of the system. Watermarking can be a solution in both cases. Inherited from the multimedia realm , watermarking regroups a family of methodological and applicative tools allowing for imperceptible and persistent insertion of some metadata (watermark) into original content, according to a secret key and under some prescribed security performances. The subsequent watermark detection can serve various purposes among which the most relevant for our study is IPR management, understood as the possibility of unambiguously identifying semantically similar yet digitally different contents, like those obtained after compressing or cropping a video sequence, for instance. The main properties of watermarking are the data payload, the imperceptibility, and the robustness. The data payload represents the quantity of information (in bits) that can be inserted and detected for serving the targeted applicative scope (copyright and/or integrity certification). The imperceptibility refers to the preservation of the quality of the original content. The robustness refers to the property of recovering the mark even when the protected content was subjected to malicious or mundane operations (commonly referred to as attacks). The security property relates to the watermarking system behavior when some partial or total information about the key is available to the attacker. Watermarking solutions can also be designed and deployed for deep neural networks [ref]40 [ref]1 . To this end, the generic watermarking properties are reconsidered and extended. First, the data payload concept is kept unchanged, yet the practice results in one-bit solutions (a binary, detected/undetected decision is generally made). Secondly, the imperceptibility property is evaluated by comparing the applicative performances of the watermarked model to the ones provided by a watermarked model trained in similar conditions. Thirdly, the robustness is assessed against transformations involved in the neural network life-cycle, like pruning or quantization, for instance. Finally, the watermark could be either retrieved from the parameters of the model (white-box methods [ref]40   ) or from its inference (black-box methods [ref]1 ). The neural network watermarking method security is not specifically studied and by default considered to be linked to the key size (as an attempt to avoid the brute force attack) and to its impossibility to be known by the attacker. In this study, we introduce a new neural network watermarking method that belongs to the white-box category.\nOn the one hand, from the conceptual point of view, we establish synergies between the very concept of neural network optimization and neural network watermarking. From the neural network optimization point of view, we use the high dimensionality of models to lock a subset of weights without impacting the final performance of the model. To this end, the findings in [ref]13 are leveraged for watermarking purposes, where the sharpness of the loss landscape for the watermarked weights should be maximized. This way, the watermark can be inserted through the entire model, without exploiting any of its peculiarities (architecture, activation function, regularization term, etc.). By considering now that deep neural networks are typically over-parameterized, the watermark size can be thus significantly extended, virtually till the limit set by the model redundancy   .\nOn the other hand, from the neural network watermarking point of view, we insert a watermark (represented as an image) in a subset of weights. The robustness property is obtained by the inference sensitivity on the watermarked weights: the force of the attacks that can be applied on the watermarked weights is implicitly reduced by the imperceptibility property. The same sensitivity also makes the method reach extreme security: even assuming the attacked identifies the key, they cannot modify/erase the watermark without destroying the model inference quality (this a priori consideration being experimentally proved in Table 4). The main contributions of this study can be summarized as follows. Starting from the SAM (Sharpness-Aware Minimization [ref]13) setup, where the loss landscape is enforced being maximally flat, we state and solve the inverse problem (Sharpness-Aware Maximization - further referred to as MAS) (Sec. 3) where the loss landscape can be made steep. We define a new neural network watermarking method, referred to as WaterMAS, that leverages the MAS principle for turning the produced inference intrinsically sensitive to the watermarked weights (Sec. 4). We carry out a comprehensive set of experiments on conventional neural network watermarking properties (imperceptibility, robustness, and computational complexity) as well as a discussion on data payload and method security (Sec. 5). The paper is structured as follows. Sec. 2 starts with an analysis of the basic concepts for neural network watermarking and exemplifies the key white-box neural network watermarking methods: insertion methods, types of inserted information, secret key, functional properties, and different attacks. It follows by introducing the sharpness-aware minimization grounds. The next Sec. 3 presents the first contribution of the paper, namely the definition of the sharpness maximization problem and the deriving of the underlying algorithm solving this problem. Sec. 4 presents a new neural network watermarking method based on the findings in Sec. 3, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The experimental Sec. 5 starts by imperceptibility evaluation against different methods of the literature, on different tasks and architectures, then assesses the robustness, and lastly, explores the size of information that can be inserted in a specific model and its relationship with security aspects. Finally, Sec. 6 concludes this work and opens perspectives for future works.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: the watermarking system behavior when some partial or total information about the key is available to the attacker.
