      "content": "Paper Title: FedCorr: Multi-Stage Federated Learning for Label Noise Correction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFederated learning (FL) is a promising solution for large-scale collaborative learning, where clients jointly train a machine learning model, while still maintaining local data privacy [ref]26 7 . However, in real-world FL implementations over heterogeneous networks, there may be differences in the characteristics of different clients due to diverse annotators’ skill, bias, and hardware reliability  8. Client data is rarely IID and frequently imbalanced. Also, some clients would have clean data, while other clients may have data with label noise at different noise levels. Hence, the deployment of practical FL systems would face challenges brought by discrepancies in two aspects i): local data statistics [ref]26   , and ii): local label quality  8. Although recent works explored the discrepancy in local data statistics in FL, and learning with label noise in centralized learning (CL), there is at present no unified approach for tackling both challenges simultaneously in FL. The first challenge has been explored in recent FL works, with a focus on performance with convergence guarantees  . However, these works have the common implicit assumption that the given labels of local data are completely correct, which is rarely the case in real-world datasets. The second challenge can be addressed by reweighting    or discarding  those client updates that are most dissimilar. In these methods, the corresponding clients are primarily treated as malicious agents. However, dissimilar clients are not necessarily malicious and could have label noise in local data that would otherwise still be useful after label correction.\n††This work is supported by the National Research Foundation, Singapore under its AI Singapore Program (AISG Award No: AISG-RP-2019-015), and under its NRFF Program (NRFFAI1-2019-0005). This work is also supported in part by the SUTD Growth Plan Grant for AI. For FL systems, the requirement of data privacy poses an inherent challenge for any label correction scheme. How can clients identify their noisy labels to be corrected without needing other clients to reveal sensitive information? For example, 8 proposes label correction for identified noisy clients with the guidance of extra data feature information exchanged between clients and server, which may lead to privacy concerns. Label correction and, more generally, methods to deal with label noise, are well-studied in CL. Yet, even state-of-the-art CL methods for tackling label noise   0   0 3 5, when applied to local clients, are inadequate in mitigating the performance degradation in the FL setting, due to the limited sizes of local datasets. These CL methods cannot be applied on the global sever or across multiple clients due to FL privacy requirements. So, it is necessary and natural to adopt a more general framework that jointly considers the two discrepancies, for a better emulation of real-world data heterogeneity. Most importantly, privacy-preserving label correction should be incorporated in training to improve robustness to data heterogeneity in FL. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage FL framework to simultaneously deal with both discrepancy challenges; see Fig. 1 for an overview. To ensure privacy, we introduce a dimensionality-based filter to identify noisy clients, by measuring the local intrinsic dimensionality (LID)  of local model prediction subspaces. Extensive experiments have shown that clean datasets can be distinguished from noisy datasets by the behavior of LID scores during training  . Hence, in addition to the usual local weight updates, we propose that each client also sends an LID score to the server, which is a single scalar representing the discriminability of the predictions of the local model. We then filter noisy samples based on per-sample training losses independently for each identified noisy client, and relabel the large-loss samples with the predicted labels of the global model. To improve training stability and alleviate the negative impact caused by noisy clients, we introduce a weighted proximal regularization term, where the weights are based on the estimated local noise levels. Furthermore, we finetune the global model on the identified clean clients and relabel the local data for the remaining noisy clients. Our main contributions are as follows: We propose a general multi-stage FL framework FedCorr to tackle data heterogeneity, with respect to both local label quality and local data statistics. We propose a general framework for easy generation of federated synthetic label noise and diverse (e.g. non-IID) client data partitions. We identify noisy clients via LID scores, and identify noisy labels via per-sample losses. We also propose an adaptive local proximal regularization term based on estimated local noise levels. We demonstrate that FedCorr outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods on multiple datasets with different noise levels, for both IID and non-IID data partitions.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution for large-scale collaborative learning, where clients jointly train a machine learning model, while still maintaining local data privacy [ref]26 7 .
