      "content": "Paper Title: Robust Representation via Dynamic Feature Aggregation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe recent advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have yielded significant improvements to various computer vision tasks, such as image classification [ref]31   and image generation   . However, recent studies [ref]38  revealed that CNN based models are vulnerable to the adversarial attacks and out-of-distribution samples, which seriously limits their applications in security-critical scenarios, e.g., self-driving , medical imaging and biometrics  . Such an open challenge raises increasing concerns from the community, and then numerous solutions have been proposed. One of the typical methods is adversarial training  [ref]38 , which uses the attack samples for network training to improve the model robustness.\nHowever, adversarial training has some unexpected issues, i.e., high computational cost and over-fitting. Since adversarial images require repeated gradient computations, the time consumption of each training iteration is often over three times longer than vanilla training [ref]38.\nFurthermore, adopting adversarial images for training inevitably introduces a bias on non-adversarial images. In particular, the model pays more attentions to the adversarial attacks while neglects the features from clean images. Therefore, adversarial training based models cannot generalize well to clean images. Recently, Rice et al.  proved that, after a specific point, models with adversarial training can continue to decrease the training loss, while increasing the test loss. Such a phenomenon indicates that the features from different adversarial samples are diverse, which is difficult for models to learn the common patterns. To this end, improving model robustness without adversarial samples becomes a more promising research line for the challenge. One of the representative non-adversarial methods is Mixup , which can simultaneously improve generalization and robustness of models by generating linear combinations of pair-wise examples for model training.\nZhang et al.  theoretically proved that Mixup refers to an upper bound of the adversarial training, which explained the reason behind the improvement of model robustness yielded by Mixup. However, the upper bound is not a strong constraint for CNN based model, i.e., Mixup generally obtains the competitive performance against single-step attacks (e.g., FGSM ), but cannot defense more challenging multi-step attacks (e.g., PGD [ref]1 ) effectively. To tackle the problem, we propose a new solution, called Dynamic Feature Aggregation, which can improve the robustness against strong attacks (e.g., PGD [ref]1  and CW ), without using the adversarial samples or sacrificing the generalization capacity. As shown in Fig. 1, the main idea behind our method is to drive\nCNN based models to learn a compact feature space for classification. Since the data distributions of different categories are dense around the decision boundary, no space is left to generate adversarial attacks, which results in the improvement of the model robustness. Concretely, the linear interpolation with two samples is regarded as a pivot, and then adopted as the center for aggregation in the embedding space. By aggregating given samples towards the center, a compact embedding space can be thereby obtained. In order to alleviate trivial solutions caused by over-aggregating, we replace the last fully-connected layer of CNN with an orthogonal classifier to further ensure the feature discrimination in embedding space. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method can not only achieve excellent robustness against adversarial attacks, but also derive a satisfactory performance for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. In particular, the proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 32%percent3232\\% against PGD on CIFAR-10, and an F1 score of 0.9370.9370.937 for OOD detection, where CIFAR-10 and LSUN are used as in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, respectively. In summary, the contribution of this study can be concluded as following: A regularization, termed Dynamic Feature Aggregation, is proposed to compress the embedding space of the given model to improve its robustness against adversarial samples. The embedding codes with different classes are orthogonally processed for class-wise prediction, driving the model to learn distinguishable representations against trivial solution. The effectiveness of the proposed method against adversarial attacks is justified by theoretical proof. Compared to the zoo of Mixup, our method can more easily drive the model to meet the Lipschitz constraint. The proposed method, for the first time, constructs the connection between out-of-distribution detection and adversarial robustness. The compact embedding space leveraged by our method can not only defense the adversarial attacks, but also improve the performance of out-of-distribution detection.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: The recent advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have yielded significant improvements to various computer vision tasks, such as image classification [ref]31   and image generation   .
