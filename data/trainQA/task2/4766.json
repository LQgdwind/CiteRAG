      "content": "Paper Title: ASIF: Coupled Data Turns Unimodal Models to Multimodal without Training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the following we compare ASIF to traditional multimodal models based on contrastive training, CLIP and LiT. We then take a closer look to the classification of a single image, unpacking the relative representations and following the classification algorithm step by step.\nAs a prelude to the above, we start by discussing the pretrained encoders and dataset forming the ASIF models we tested. Pretrained encoders and multimodal dataset used. For our primary experiment, we utilized vision transformers as image encoders, pretrained either in a supervised manner (DEIT base, ) or in an unsupervised manner (DINO VITs8, ), on Imagenet 1k  and 21k [ref]47 respectively.\nThe embedding size was 768 for DEIT and 384 for DINO. This configuration aligns with that used in LiT ¬†, with the sole distinction being that, unlike LiT, we used a pre-trained, frozen text encoder. Regarding the text encoder, we employed the SentenceT transformer [ref]48, trained on a dataset comprising more than 1 billion sentences obtained from the internet.\nWe employed the first 1.6M entries of the Conceptual Caption dataset (CC12M, ) as our multimodal dataset. This dataset amasses images and filtered alt-texts collected from the internet. To optimize performance on a single Tesla T4 GPU, we limited our analysis to the initial 1.6M pairs. In our ‚Äúscaling-laws‚Äù experiments, we also utilized DEIT tiny and small vision transformers  and two smaller SentenceT encoders. Zero-shot performance. ¬†We assessed the quality of our ASIF multimodal model by comparing its zero-shot classification performance against CLIP and LiT on four datasets: CIFAR100, Imagenet, Imagenetv2, and PETS  [ref]50  ; see Table 1.\nWe crafted label prompts as in Zhai et¬†al. [2, Table 11]. Remarkably, we achieve competitive performance with CLIP and LiT using two frozen pretrained encoders and a fraction of the image-text pairs. The two ASIF models reported in Table 1 differ\nfor the vision encoder, that is respectively supervisedly (DEIT) and unsupervisedly pretrained (DINO). We tuned kùëòk and pùëùp on the ImageNet validation set, in both cases we used k=800ùëò800k=800 and p=8ùëù8p=8.\nThe comparison between the two versions is not completely fair since the visual transformer architecture of DINO is smaller (e.g. the codings are 384-dimensional rather than 768) but corroborates the effectiveness of ASIF with encoders pretrained using no supervision. In the appendix we report the results of a wider collection of ASIF models based on different visual and textual backbones. Summary: Overall, we observe that our ASIF procedure can achieve competitive zero-shot results with a fraction of the image-text pairs used in prior work (assuming access to other pre-trained, even unsupervisedly, unimodal models). ASIF scaling laws. In Figure 5 we show the full zero-shot accuracy trend on Imagenet as the size of the multimodal dataset grows for different choices of kùëòk and pùëùp. ASIF models become effective very quickly: we\nreach a non-trivial 18%percent1818\\% classification accuracy using just the first 10,000 pairs in the multimodal dataset.\nWe recall that building an ASIF model from scratch still requires a lot of unimodal data to pretrain the encoders, but now this data may come untied and even without any label. We tested ASIF further with smaller image and text encoders on multimodal datasets of different sizes (102superscript10210^{2} to 106superscript10610^{6} image-text pairs from CC12M) to provide early evidence about ASIF scaling laws. We used DEIT tiny, small, and base vision transformers , along with two smaller SentenceT encoders. As we see in Figure 5 and in the appendix, Imagenet classification accuracy grows smoothly with the size of the multimodal dataset, and performance does not saturate earlier with smaller encoders. These results are promising but still preliminary, further experiments with larger multimodal datasets are left for future work. Summary: Our experiments show a steady improvement in ASIF‚Äôs performance as the size of the multimodal dataset increases. Performance deteriorates with smaller encoders, but even then there is no sign of saturation or plateau. Adjusting an ASIF model in seconds. Consider classifying EuroSAT  satellite images using ASIF. Initially, the zero-shot performance outperforms random chance but is not impressive (29.4%percent29.429.4\\% unsup. configuration, 10 classes). CLIP, while better, also falls short with a 54.1%percent54.154.1\\% performance rate. Now, imagine we acquire 100 new image-text pairs from EuroSAT. Our goal is to develop a new multimodal model based on an updated training set, anticipating the need to process more satellite images in the future. With CLIP, this would require us to fine-tune or retrain the model from scratch using the updated dataset.\nIn contrast, ASIF requires only to obtain and store the new pairs‚Äô embeddings. The model retains its usability for all the previous images, but it now also makes accurate predictions for satellite images, achieving an 82.2%¬±2.0plus-or-minuspercent82.22.082.2\\%\\pm 2.0 accuracy on EuroSAT.222Why does CLIP perform better zero-shot? Likely, its 400M pairs have more samples close to satellite images than ASIF‚Äôs 1.6M samples from CC12M, evidenced by ASIF‚Äôs drastic improvement with just 100 new samples. Similarly, if we need to remove samples from the multimodal training dataset‚Äîeither because they are faulty (as shown in Figure 6) or because we have lost the license to use them‚Äîthe process is as simple as deleting the corresponding embeddings to get a new model. Summary:\nASIF enables quick model adjustments and data handling without the need for retraining, unlike traditional models such as CLIP. This demonstrates its practicality in real-world scenarios, such as the emergence of a new setting or the loss of rights for assets used during training. Deep dive into a classification. To better understand why and how the ASIF procedure works, we are going to follow step by step the single classification depicted in Figure 6, showing the entries of the multimodal dataset used to build the relative representations. For simplicity we assume k=23ùëò23k=23. We want to find the Imagenet label of the upper left image in Figure 6. The first step is to compute its relative representation with respect to the multimodal dataset, this procedure selects the 23 most similar images in our collection. The most similar are indeed triumphal archs that‚Äìas similarity decreases‚Äìturn to generic structures with archs or ancient monuments. No other image in the multimodal dataset is involved in the classification, we could replace all the entries in our collection except for these 23, and as long as no new image is more similar to the input image, every computation in the classification process would remain the same. This consistency of the ASIF procedure is in contrast to traditional approaches like CLIP and LiT, where the parameters defining the encoder computations are shaped by the whole multimodal dataset through contrastive learning. Now, we approach \\SOUL@setup\\SOUL@the pivotal step of the ASIF procedure: jumping into the text space by treating the relative representation of the input image as if it were the relative representation of its ideal caption. The vector remains the same, but its meaning changed: now it signifies how much the ideal caption should be similar to 23 captions. The efficacy of this jump hinges entirely on the quality of the multimodal dataset. Looking at the 23 captions in Figure 6, we are confident that the most fitting candidate caption corresponds to one of the prompts associated with the triumphal_arch label in ImageNet, such as ‚Äúa photo of a triumphal arch‚Äù.\nConversely, a dataset featuring 23 non-informative captions, such as file names ‚ÄúIMG_20180823.jpg‚Äù or camera settings ‚ÄúD90 18.0-70.0 mm f/3.5-4.5‚Äù, would not allow the model to recognize the correct class even with the best image and text encoders.\nThis limitation is actually a defining feature of the ASIF procedure, as \\SOUL@setup\\SOUL@the meaning attributed to the input is ultimately determined by the multimodal dataset and not by the encoders: by acting just on the image-text pairs, we have full control over the model‚Äôs output. Summary: Our simple (non-cherry picked) example showcases how the ASIF predictions can be easily attributed to specific examples in the multimodal training data by construction. This feedback can be used to explain predictions and grow high quality datasets in data centric AI, for example by inspecting which examples contribute to incorrect classifications.\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: our primary experiment, we utilized vision transformers as image encoders, pretrained either in a supervised manner (DEIT base, ) or in an unsupervised manner (DINO VITs8, ), on Imagenet 1k  and 21k [ref]47 respectively.\nThe embedding size was 768 for DEIT and 384 for DINO.
