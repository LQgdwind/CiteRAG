      "content": "Paper Title: Interpreting Representation Quality of DNNs for 3D Point Cloud Processing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning on 3D point clouds:\nRecently, a series of studies directly used DNNs to process 3D point clouds and have achieved promising performance in various 3D tasks [ref]26  [ref]42 3       . PointNet [ref]26 was the pioneer to use point-wise multi-layer perceptron to process point clouds and aggregate all individual point features into a global feature. To further extract information from local 3D structures, PointNet++  recursively applied PointNet to capture hierarchical 3D structures. Likewise, Relation-Shape CNN  and PointCNN  also focused on hierarchical structures and improved the ability to extract contextual information. Due to the irregularity of 3D point clouds, some approaches considered the point set as a graph and further defined graph convolutions. DGCNN  dynamically constructed local graphs and conducted feature extraction via the EdgeConv operation. SPG  built a superpoint graph to process large-scale point clouds. GACNet  introduced an attention mechanism in graph convolutional networks. KCNet  proposed kernel correlation and graph pooling to aggregate contextual information. In addition, many approaches have been proposed to apply convolution operators to the point clouds. PointConv  and KPConv  utilized nonlinear functions to construct convolution weights from the input 3D coordinates. InterpCNN  interpolated features of 3D points to the discrete kernel weights coordinates, so as to implement the discrete convolution operator to point clouds. Instead of designing new architectures, our study focuses on the analysis of representation quality of existing classic DNNs for point cloud processing. Visualization or diagnosis of representations:\nIt is intuitive to interpret DNNs by visualizing the feature representations encoded in intermediate layers of DNNs     , and estimating the pixel-wise saliency/importance/attribution of input variables w.r.t the network output       6. Similarly, in the 3D domain, PointNet [ref]26 visualized the subset of 3D points (namely the critical subset) that directly affected the network output. Additionally, Zheng et al. 5 specified the critical subset via building a gradient-based saliency map. In comparison, our study proposes to evaluate the representation quality of different point cloud regions. Quantitative evaluation of representations:\nThe quantitative evaluation of the representations of DNNs provides a new perspective for explanations. The Shapley value  estimates the attribution distribution over all players in a game and has been applied to quantitative evaluation of the representations of DNNs   . Based on Shapley values, some studies have investigated the interaction between input variables of a DNN 1   3. In comparison, our study aims to illustrate distinctive properties of 3D point cloud processing.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: Deep learning on 3D point clouds:\nRecently, a series of studies directly used DNNs to process 3D point clouds and have achieved promising performance in various 3D tasks [ref]26  [ref]42 3       .
