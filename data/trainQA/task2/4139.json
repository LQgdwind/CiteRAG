Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Object Scene Representation Transformer\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSRT’s latent representation, the SLSR, has been shown to contain enough information to perform downstream tasks such as semi-supervised semantic segmentation [ref]29.\nHowever, the size of the SLSR is directly determined by the number and resolution of the input images, and there is no clear one-to-one correspondence between the SLSR tokens and objects in the scene. To obtain an object-centric scene representation, we incorporate the Slot Attention [ref]23 module into our architecture.\nSlot Attention converts the SLSR {𝐳j}subscript𝐳𝑗\\{\\mathbf{z}_{j}\\} into the Slot Scene Representation (SlotSR), a set of object slots {𝐬n∈ℝh}subscript𝐬𝑛superscriptℝℎ\\{\\mathbf{s}_{n}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{h}\\}.\nDifferent from the size of the SLSR, the size N𝑁N of the SlotSR is chosen by the user. We initialize the set of object slots using learned embeddings {𝐬^n∈ℝh}subscript^𝐬𝑛superscriptℝℎ\\{\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}_{n}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{h}\\}.\nThe Slot Attention module then takes the following form for learned linear projections Wvsubscript𝑊𝑣W_{v}, Wzsubscript𝑊𝑧W_{z}, and Wssubscript𝑊𝑠W_{s} and a learned update function 𝒰θsubscript𝒰𝜃\\mathcal{U}_{\\theta}: The attention matrix 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} is used to aggregate input tokens using a weighted mean.\nDifferent from commonly used cross-attention , it is normalized over the output axis, i.e., the set of slots, instead of the input tokens.\nThis enforces an exclusive grouping of input tokens into object slots, which serves as an inductive bias for decomposing the SLSR into individual per-object representations.\nFollowing Locatello et al. [ref]23, we use a gated update for 𝒰θsubscript𝒰𝜃\\mathcal{U}_{\\theta} in the form of a GRU  followed by a residual MLP and we apply LayerNorm [ref]2 to both inputs and slots.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: SRT’s latent representation, the SLSR, has been shown to contain enough information to perform downstream tasks such as semi-supervised semantic segmentation [ref]29.\nHowever, the size of the SLSR is directly determined by the number and resolution of the input images, and there is no clear one-to-one correspondence between the SLSR tokens and objects in\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
