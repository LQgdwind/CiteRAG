      "content": "Paper Title: Holistic Interaction Transformer Network for Action Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHIT consists of two mirroring modalities with distinct modules designed to learn different types of interactions. Human actions are largely based on their pose, hand movements (and pose), and interaction with their surroundings. Based on these observations, we select human poses and hands bounding boxes as entities for our model, along with object and person bounding boxes. We use Detectron  [ref]9 for human pose detection and create a bounding box encircling the location of the person’s hands. Following the state-of-the-art methods, , [ref]32, , we use Faster-RCNN  to compute object bounding box proposals. The video feature extractor is a 3D CNN backbone network[ref]5, and the pose encoder is a lightweight spatial transformer inspired by . We apply ROIAlign  to trim the video features and extract person, hands, and objects features.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: with their surroundings.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
