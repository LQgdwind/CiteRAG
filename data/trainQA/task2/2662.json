      "content": "Paper Title: On the Compression of Neural Networks Using ℓ₀-Norm Regularization and Weight Pruning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe aim of this experiment is to assess the sparseness-induction capability of the proposed ℓ0subscriptℓ0\\ell_{0}-norm regularization as compared with both the standard ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}- and ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-norm-based regularizations. In this context, neural networks inspired on the Lenet-5-Caffe111The Lenet-5-Caffe is a modified version of Lenet-5  which is discussed in . are trained for\nthe image classification task of the MNIST dataset. To assess the trade-off between accuracy and network compression ratio, the networks obtained after training are increasingly compressed (starting with a factor of 2) and the resulting accuracy is evaluated for each compression ratio. The network compression is carried out by using three different weight-pruning strategies [ref]45: i) global magnitude pruning (GP), where the less significant weights of the network as a whole are targeted for pruning; ii) layerwise magnitude pruning (LP), where the less significant weights in each layer are targeted (resulting in the same compression ratio for each layer); and iii) random pruning (RP), where weights are randomly selected from the whole network, regardless of their magnitude. Fine tuning (FT)  (i.e., network retraining after pruning) is also considered in this experiment. Figures 3 and 4 present the curves of accuracy versus compression ratio obtained without and with FT, respectively. The first aspect to highlight, from these figures, is the superiority of both global and layerwise weight pruning with respect to random pruning. This fact demonstrates the effectiveness of network compression via magnitude-based weight pruning. Now, regarding the capability of the different norm-based regularization techniques to induce sparseness and thus provide higher compression ratios, the curves from Figures 3 and 4 show that the proposed ℓ0subscriptℓ0\\ell_{0}-norm-based regularization (both alone and in combination with the ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2} norm) significantly outperforms the regularizations based on both ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1} and ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2} norms. This conclusion is direct from the superior results obtained by using the proposed regularization with either global or layerwise weight pruning. Moreover, the inferior performance obtained by the proposed regularization with random pruning is also due to its superior sparseness inducing capability, since a higher sparseness level implies more concentration of energy in fewer weights, with some of these more significant weights inevitably targeted by a random pruning strategy. Another important aspect to point out is that the use of FT leads to significantly better results in all cases, even though the proposed ℓ0subscriptℓ0\\ell_{0}-norm-based regularization has obtained very good results even without using FT (see Figure 3).\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: compressed (starting with a factor of 2) and the resulting accuracy is evaluated for each compression ratio.
