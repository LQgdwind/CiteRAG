(1) PFPN: Panoptic FPN  is a lightweight network architecture which has been used in various high-resolution prediction tasks. We employ PFPN with the ResNet-101  backbone as our baseline network architecture for both depth and surface normal estimation tasks.\n(2) PFPN+SR(𝐞2subscript𝐞2\\mathbf{e}_{2}): we train PFPN using the spatial rectifier  (SR) with a unimodal reference direction 𝐞2=[0 1 0]𝖳subscript𝐞2superscriptmatrix010𝖳\\mathbf{e}_{2}=\\begin{bmatrix}0\\ 1\\ 0\\end{bmatrix}^{\\mathsf{T}}.\n(3) PFPN+SR(𝐞3subscript𝐞3\\mathbf{e}_{3}): we train PFPN using the SR with a unimodal reference direction 𝐞3=[0 0 1]𝖳subscript𝐞3superscriptmatrix001𝖳\\mathbf{e}_{3}=\\begin{bmatrix}0\\ 0\\ 1\\end{bmatrix}^{\\mathsf{T}}.\n(4) PFPN+MSR: we train PFPN with our multimodal spatial rectifer (MSR) described in Section 3.2.\n(5-8) DORN: DORN  is a high-capacity network architecture that is recently utilized in state-of-the-art surface normal estimation methods [ref]23 . Similar to PFPN, we also train DORN with the unimodal spatial rectifier on two reference directions 𝐞2subscript𝐞2\\mathbf{e}_{2}, 𝐞3subscript𝐞3\\mathbf{e}_{3} and with our multimodal spatial rectifier, denoted by DORN+SR(𝐞2subscript𝐞2\\mathbf{e}_{2}), DORN+SR(𝐞3subscript𝐞3\\mathbf{e}_{3}), and DORN+MSR, respectively.\n(9) MiDaS [ref]45, (10) DPT : state-of-the-art depth prediction model trained on a large scale dataset MIX6 .\nSince the depth prediction from MiDaS and DPT is ambiguous up to a scale factor, we scale the predicted depth maps with a common factor computed from the least-squares method  [ref]3 using the ground truth depth on the train set.\nWe denote a network trained on a dataset by METHOD (DATASET), e.g., PFPN (EDINA) is the PFPN network that is trained on EDINA dataset. By default, all networks are trained on ScanNet+EDINA.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: multimodal spatial rectifer (MSR) described in Section 3.2.\n(5-8) DORN: DORN  is a high-capacity network architecture that is recently utilized in state-of-the-art surface normal estimation methods [ref]23 .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
