      "content": "Paper Title: Language Conditioned Imitation Learning over Unstructured Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe consider the problem of learning a natural language conditioned control policy πθ​(a|s,l)subscript𝜋𝜃conditional𝑎𝑠𝑙\\pi_{\\theta}(a|s,l), which outputs next action a∈A𝑎𝐴a\\in A, conditioned on current state s∈S𝑠𝑆s\\in S and free-form natural language l∈L𝑙𝐿l\\in L describing a short-horizon task. Note that S𝑆S is not the true environment state, but rather the high dimensional onboard observations of the robot, e.g. S={image,proprioception}𝑆imageproprioceptionS=\\{\\operatorname{image},\\operatorname{proprioception}\\}. l𝑙l is provided by humans and has no limits on vocabulary or grammar. At test time, a human gives a robot a series of instructions in a row, one at a time: {l0,…,lN}subscript𝑙0…subscript𝑙𝑁\\{l_{0},...,l_{N}\\}. The language conditioned visuomotor policy πθ​(a|s,l)subscript𝜋𝜃conditional𝑎𝑠𝑙\\pi_{\\theta}(a|s,l) issues high frequency continuous control in closed loop to obtain the desired behavior described in l𝑙l. The human may provide new instructions l𝑙l to the agent at any time, either commanding a new subtask or providing guidance (i.e. “move your hand back slightly”). Standard imitation learning setups learn single task policies πθ​(a|s)subscript𝜋𝜃conditional𝑎𝑠\\pi_{\\theta}(a|s) using supervised learning over a dataset 𝒟={τi}iN𝒟subscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝜏𝑖𝑁𝑖\\mathscr{D}=\\{\\tau_{i}\\}^{N}_{i}, of expert state-action trajectories τ={(s0,a0),…}𝜏subscript𝑠0subscript𝑎0…\\tau=\\{(s_{0},a_{0}),...\\}. Closest to our problem setting is goal conditioned imitation learning 1, which instead aims to learn a policy πθ​(a|s,g)subscript𝜋𝜃conditional𝑎𝑠𝑔\\pi_{\\theta}(a|s,g), conditioned on s∈S𝑠𝑆s\\in S and a task descriptor g∈G𝑔𝐺g\\in G (often a one-hot task encoding [ref]37). When tasks can be described as a goal state g=sg∈S𝑔subscript𝑠𝑔𝑆g=s_{g}\\in S to reach, this allows any state visited during collection to be relabeled 1  [ref]8 as a “reached goal state”, with the preceding states and actions treated as optimal behavior for reaching that goal. At test time, learned behaviors are conditioned using a goal image sgsubscript𝑠𝑔s_{g}. Relabeled imitation learning can be applied to unstructured and unlabeled demonstration data 6 to learn general purpose goal-reaching policies. Here, demonstrators are not constrained to a predefined set of tasks, but rather engage in every available object manipulation in a scene (see example). This yields one long unsegmented demonstration of semantically meaningful behaviors, which can be relabeled using Algorithm 2 into a training set Dplay={(τ,sg)i}i=0Dplaysubscript𝐷playsubscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝜏subscript𝑠𝑔𝑖subscript𝐷play𝑖0D_{\\operatorname{play}}=\\{(\\tau,s_{g})_{i}\\}^{D_{\\operatorname{play}}}_{i=0}. These short horizon goal image conditioned demonstrations are fed to a maximum likelihood goal conditioned imitation objective: ℒGCIL=𝔼(τ,sg)∼Dplay​[∑t=0|τ|log⁡πθ​(at|st,sg)]subscriptℒGCILsubscript𝔼similar-to𝜏subscript𝑠𝑔subscript𝐷playdelimited-[]subscriptsuperscript𝜏𝑡0logsubscript𝜋𝜃conditionalsubscript𝑎𝑡subscript𝑠𝑡subscript𝑠𝑔\\mathscr{L}_{\\operatorname{GCIL}}=\\mathbb{E}_{(\\tau,\\ s_{g})\\sim D_{\\operatorname{play}}}\\left[\\sum^{|\\tau|}_{t=0}\\operatorname{log}\\pi_{\\theta}\\left(a_{t}|s_{t},s_{g}\\right)\\right]. However, when learning language conditioned policies πθ​(a|s,l)subscript𝜋𝜃conditional𝑎𝑠𝑙\\pi_{\\theta}(a|s,l), we cannot easily relabel any visited state s𝑠s to a natural language goal as the goal space G𝐺G is no longer equivalent to the observation space L𝐿L. Consequently, this limits language conditioned imitation learning from being able to incorporate large unstructured demonstration datasets Dplaysubscript𝐷playD_{\\operatorname{play}}. Next, we describe our approach that relaxes this limitation.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: learning 1, which instead aims to learn a policy πθ​(a|s,g)subscript𝜋𝜃conditional𝑎𝑠𝑔\\pi_{\\theta}(a|s,g), conditioned on s∈S𝑠𝑆s\\in S and a task descriptor g∈G𝑔𝐺g\\in G (often a one-hot task encoding [ref]37). When tasks can be described as a goal state g=sg∈S𝑔subscript𝑠𝑔𝑆g=s_{g}\\in S to reach, this allows any state visited during collection to be relabeled 1  [ref]8 as a “reached goal state”,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
