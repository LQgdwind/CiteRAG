      "content": "Paper Title: Simulation of Turing machines with analytic discrete ODEs: 𝐅𝐏𝐓𝐈𝐌𝐄 and 𝐅𝐏𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄 over the reals characterised with discrete ordinary differential equations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn addition to the previous state-of-the-art discussions, we comment here on some aspects:\nOur ways of simulating Turing machines have some reminiscence of similar constructions used in other contexts such as Neural Networks  . In particular, we use a Cantor-like encoding set ℐℐ\\mathcal{I} with inspiration from these references. These references use some particular sigmoid function σ𝜎\\sigma (called sometimes the saturated linear function) that values 00 when x≤0𝑥0x\\leq 0, x𝑥x for 0≤x≤10𝑥10\\leq x\\leq 1, 111 for x≥1𝑥1x\\geq 1. The latter is equivalent to cond¯​(14+12​x)¯cond1412𝑥\\overline{\\textrm{cond}}(\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{2}x), for the function considered in   and hence their constructions can be reformulated using the cond¯¯cond\\overline{\\textrm{cond}} function. We completely avoid this, by considering the tanh\\tanh function, which is more natural in the context of formal neural networks.\nThe models considered in   are recurrent, while our constructions are not recurrent neural networks, and second, their models are restricted to live on the compact domain   , which forbids getting functions from \\R→\\R→\\R\\R\\R\\to\\R, while our settings allow more general functions. Our proofs also require functions taking some integer arguments, that would be impossible to consider in their settings (unless at the price of an artificial recoding). In some sense, our constructions can be seen as operators that map to a family of neural networks in the spirit of these models, instead of considering fixed recurrent neural networks, but also dealing with tanh\\tanh, and not requiring the saturated linear function. The question of whether Turing machines can be simulated by recurrent neural networks of finite size, using the tanh\\tanh activation function (and not the “exact” saturated linear function) is a well-known long-standing open problem. Despite some attempts, such as the one described in , up to our knowledge, there remains some of the statements not yet formally proved, or at least not fully generally accepted, in the existing proofs. Our statements are dealing with the tanh\\tanh activation function, in some sense, but we avoid this open question by restricting it to finite space or time computations. By the way, our proofs state this is possible if the space or the time of the machine is bounded, up to some controlled error. In the context of neural network models, there have been several characterisations of complexity classes over the discrete (see e.g. the monograph  about the approach discussed above, but not only), as far as we know, the relation between formal neural networks with classes of computable analysis has never been established before. If we do not restrict ourselves to neural network-related models, as in all these previous contexts, as far as we know, only a few papers have been devoted to characterisations of complexity, and even computability, classes in the sense of computable analysis. There have been some attempts using continuous ODEs [ref]7, that we already mentioned, or\nthe so-called \\R\\R\\R-recursive functions 1. For discrete schemata, we only know 2 and 5, focusing on computability and not complexity.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: know, only a few papers have been devoted to characterisations of complexity, and even computability, classes in the sense of computable analysis.
