      "content": "Paper Title: Weakly Supervised Scene Text Detection using Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRL is an active learning paradigm which in contrast to supervised learning does not rely on labeled training data but on interactions with a predefined environment . It is defined as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where at each time step t𝑡t the so called RL agent observes a state stsubscript𝑠𝑡s_{t} in its environment and takes an action Atsubscript𝐴𝑡A_{t} to manipulate the environment. During its interaction with the environment the agent receives a scalar reward according to the reward function r𝑟r. The agent tries to maximize the long-term reward by adapting its behavior accordingly . The agent’s behavior is defined by its policy π:S⟶A:𝜋⟶𝑆𝐴\\pi:S\\longrightarrow A which maps an environment state to the action the agent will take when observing that state . The action-value function, denoted Qπ​(at,st)superscript𝑄𝜋subscript𝑎𝑡subscript𝑠𝑡Q^{\\pi}(a_{t},s_{t}), assesses the value of taking the action atsubscript𝑎𝑡a_{t} in state stsubscript𝑠𝑡s_{t} when continuing with the current policy . \n Q-learning which we use in our work is an algorithm that estimates the action-value function .  introduced the concept of a deep Q-network (DQN), a deep neural network, which serves as a function approximator for the action-value function. In this case we speak of deep q-learning in which the action-value function is learned using SGD . The environment transitions are stored as tuples (st,at,rt,st+1)subscript𝑠𝑡subscript𝑎𝑡subscript𝑟𝑡subscript𝑠𝑡1(s_{t},a_{t},r_{t},s_{t+1}) inside a replay buffer from which they get sampled uniformly to build batches for training [ref]36 in order to assure independence of the training samples. We use the popular concept of ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-greedy exploration  for state exploration. During training actions are chosen randomly instead of being selected by the current policy with a probability controlled by the parameter ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: stored as tuples (st,at,rt,st+1)subscript𝑠𝑡subscript𝑎𝑡subscript𝑟𝑡subscript𝑠𝑡1(s_{t},a_{t},r_{t},s_{t+1}) inside a replay buffer from which they get sampled uniformly to build batches for training [ref]36 in order to assure independence of the training samples.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
