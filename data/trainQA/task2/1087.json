The proposed model called EAN  used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the input coordinates. They do not use any recurrent and convolutional layer instead used attention mechanisms [ref]28, moreover first time they combine 2OPT local search with improving performance. Model names S2VDQN [ref]27 used a graph embedding structure first in the combinatorial optimisation field. They trained the model using the reinforcement learning deep Q-network (DQN) to develop solutions for graph-based NP-hard problems incrementally. The framework proposed by Kool et al. [ref]9, based on deep reinforcement learning that utilized graph attention layers, demonstrated that high-quality approximate solutions can be achievable to some NP-hard COPs. In [ref]9, construct a solution for TSP by pointing input elements as a sequence. They claim their model is an alternative to the PN . Another recent method called (GNN-MCTS), a graph neural network (GNN)  used Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to make the decision more reliable by simulating a large number of searches. GNN  is trained to guide the MCTS, which helps to reduce the complexity of the search space. Also, to avoid stuck in a local optimum MCTS provides a more reliable policy . In the learning to optimisation field, previous work only considered the TSP instances embedded in a Euclidean plane and randomly generated TSP instances. Our goal is to consider TSP instances according to their edge weight types and distribution. Our model is based on a CNN combined with RNN and attention mechanisms, and this combination significantly improves results. In our work, we have used a CNN, which is more powerful to exploit spatial invariance of all locations (cities). The hardness of TSP instances have been investigated many times , and solve various edge-weight types  of TSP instances in the operation research field. However, in the learning to optimise field, never address the issue of the hardness of TSP instances and other edge-weight types of instances from the TSPLIB benchmark dataset . We show the benefit of our model in direct comparison to state-of-the-art approaches using randomly generated data, as well as TSPLIB data on various TSP instances.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: In recent years, researchers develop reinforcement learning-based frameworks to solve TSP problems , , [ref]27, [ref]9.
