      "content": "Paper Title: Compromising the Intelligence of Modern DNNs: On the Effectiveness of Targeted RowPress\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDRAM Organization & Commands. A DRAM chip consists of multiple memory banks, each comprising 2D sub-arrays of memory cells arranged in matrices, with billions of cells on modern chips. Each DRAM cell contains a capacitor and an access transistor, where the capacitor’s charge state represents a binary ’1’ or ’0’  . In idle mode, the memory controller issues a Precharge (PRE) command, precharging the Bit-Line (BL) to VD​D2\\frac{V_{DD}}{2}. In active mode, the Activate (ACT) command activates the Word-Line (WL), allowing DRAM cells to share charge with the BL, altering its voltage. A sense amplifier detects this deviation and amplifies it to VD​DV_{DD} or 0, enabling data transfer via read (RD) / write (WR) commands  . DRAM Timing Parameters. The most basic parameter is the clock cycle (tC​Kt_{CK}) that is used to measure all parameters. Row Active Time (tR​A​St_{RAS}) encompasses the temporal window between an ACT command and the subsequent PRE command, ensuring optimal performance by restoring charge within the DRAM cells on the open row. Row Precharge Time (tR​Pt_{RP}) signifies the gap between a PRE command and the next ACT command, closing the open WL and initiating the pre-charging of the BLs to VD​D2\\frac{V_{DD}}{2}. Retention time refers to the duration a memory cell can hold its stored data without needing a refresh, influenced by factors like cell density and electromagnetic interference. These parameters ensure reliable and efficient DRAM operation. In the RowHammer model, the retention time of certain victim rows may significantly reduce. The Refresh Window (tR​E​F​Wt_{REFW}) is the interval within which all DRAM cells must be refreshed to prevent data loss or corruption . RowHammer in DDR4 & Protection Mechanisms. Kim et al. [ref]12 conducted an extensive study on RowHammer bit-flips in DDR3 modules, finding that approximately 85% of the tested modules were susceptible to RowHammer attacks. Thus, earlier RowHammer research focused on DDR3 systems . DDR4 modules, introduced to create a RowHammer-less landscape, have documented instances of RowHammer on earlier DDR4 generations  . TRRespass  is the only recently established work exploring the multi-sided fault injection model. Multiple software and hardware mitigation mechanisms reduce RowHammer-based attacks [ref]12 [ref]28  . Hardware-based research is categorized into victim-focused mechanisms with probabilistic refreshing (e.g., PRA , ProTRR [ref]28) or non-probabilistic methods    and aggressor-focused mechanisms counting activations (e.g., TRR , Hydra , CBT , Panopticon , CRA , TWiCe , Graphene [ref]37, Mithril ). System manufacturers tend to follow mechanisms that detect RowHammer conditions and intervene, such as increasing refresh rates and counter-based approaches. TRR  and counter-based detection methods    require additional hardware to calculate and record row activations to other fast-read-memory (SRAM  / CAM [ref]37). The controller refreshes the target row if the number reaches the Maximum Activation Count (MAC) . Counter-based solutions add a new DRAM command called Nearby Row Refresh (NRR)  [ref]37, issued to refresh the relevant victim rows. JEDEC standards outline three MAC configurations: (1) unlimited, if the DRAM module is RowHammer-free; (2) untested, if the module has not undergone post-production inspection; or (3) TM​A​CT_{MAC}, the specific number of ACTs the module can withstand (e.g., 1M). Most DDR4 modules assert an unlimited MAC value . RowPress. RowPress  and RowHammer share the potential for bit-flips in victim rows when bits differ from adjacent (aggressor) rows. Both attacks get worse as DRAM technology scales down to smaller node sizes. The distinction between them lies in how the DRAM rows are accessed (i.e., the failure mechanism): RowHammer repeatedly opens (i.e., activates) and closes an aggressor row many times, whereas RowPress extends the activation duration in the aggressor row, reducing the required number of activations. RowPress-vulnerable cells and RowHammer-vulnerable cells bear <.5%<.5\\% overlap and they exhibit opposite bit-flip directionality trends.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: reduce.
