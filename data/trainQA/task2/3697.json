      "content": "Paper Title: Q-PPG: Energy-Efficient PPG-based Heart Rate Monitoring on Wearable Devices\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nModern wrist-worn devices include increasingly heterogeneous sensor sets, monitoring movements and vital parameters such as electrodermal activity and heart rate (HR). HR monitoring, in particular, is important for clinical purposes and precise activity tracking. Early wrist-worn HR tracking devices were connected to a separate chest band, equipped with a simple 1-3 leads Electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor. While accurate, this solution was expensive and created discomfort for users in daily life usage. Therefore, in recent years, ECG chest bands have been progressively replaced by cost-effective and more comfortable photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, which enable the measurement of HR and blood oxygenation (SpO2) directly from wrist-worn devices . Examples of commercial devices that include this type of sensor are the Apple Watch  and some Fitbit models . PPG sensors consist of one or more Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs) that periodically emit light onto the skin and a photodetector (i.e., a photodiode) that measures the variations of light intensity caused by blood flow  [ref]5. More specifically, the larger the blood volume variation, the greater the attenuation of the light emitted by the LED, resulting in a lower current output on the photodiode. Therefore, in an ideal PPG signal, peaks can be associated with the HR . A major source of inaccuracy in PPG sensors is constituted by motion artifacts (MA), i.e., signal artifacts caused by movements of the user arm and hand, which in turn produce variability in the sensor pressure on the skin or ambient light leaking into the gap between the photodiode and the wrist.\nSeveral studies compared ECG chest straps with PPG-based HR tracking systems  , showing that the former typically obtain better accuracy, especially in the presence of MAs. As a result, the ECG-based solutions are still considered the reference benchmark for wearable HR tracking . To overcome this gap, researchers have recently focused on sensor-fusion approaches that integrate PPG with inertial data from accelerometers in order to detect and mitigate the effect of MAs  0.\nMost of these approaches are based on classical signal processing algorithms such as Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Wiener Filters, and Spectral Peak Detection 1 2 3 4. TROIKA  and its evolution, JOSS 5 are the seminal works in this field. They estimate the noise caused by MAs via adaptive filtering and then apply spectral peak tracking on the PPG signal to detect the heartbeat frequency. A significant shortcoming of these algorithms is that they rely heavily on hand-tuned parameters, leading to a lack of generalization when evaluated on different datasets. Deep Learning (DL) is relatively less explored for this task, mainly for two reasons. First, the deployment of DL models on the resource-constrained computational platforms available on wrist-worn devices, typically based on Microcontrollers (MCUs) is far from trivial 6. The primary limiting resource is memory, since highly accurate DL models typically involve millions of parameters, which exceed the memory available in most MCUs. Second, DL solutions necessitate large amounts of training data, which were not available for this task until recently. Things improved with the introduction of PPG-Dalia 0, a large dataset for PPG-based HR tracking in the presence of MAs, which includes recordings from 15 subjects performing different daily activities.\nIndeed, the authors of 0 also introduced the first DL solution for this task, based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which was shown to outperform state-of-the-art algorithms on the new and more challenging dataset. Following their example, other researchers have then proposed different DL models for this task, such as CorNET 7 and Binary CorNET 8, which combine convolutional and recurrent layers. All these approaches are based on hand-designed Neural Network (NN) architectures, which may be sub-optimal in terms of accuracy versus complexity trade-off. Moreover, they also have limited flexibility from the point of view of deployment, since a fixed architecture cannot be easily adapted to hardware targets with different memory, latency or energy constraints. In this paper, which extends 9, we propose the first systematic flow to optimize DL models for PPG-based HR tracking. We focus in particular on Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), a family of DL models that are both HW-friendly and accurate for time-series processing.\nOur proposed methodology generates a rich set of Pareto-optimal TCNs in the accuracy versus memory (or n. of operations) design plane, among which designers can then select a particular model based on the constraints of their hardware target.\nIn detail, the following are the main novel contributions of this work: We leverage Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to obtain Pareto-optimal TCN architectures that predict a user’s HR based on raw PPG and acceleration data. All TCNs are automatically derived from a single seed architecture 0. With respect to 9, which only optimized the number of feature maps in each TCN layer, in this work, we extend the search also to consider the dilation parameter of convolutional layers, which effectively reduces the model complexity with a limited impact on accuracy. After optimizing the model architectures, we perform a further search step to select the best data representation format for the networks’ parameters and intermediate input/outputs. This hardware-friendly quantization enables further model size reductions, thus enriching and improving the Pareto frontier. We deploy the models resulting from our search on a real embedded platform with a smartwatch form-factor 1. The platform includes a STM32WB55 MCU from ST Microelectronics, based on an ARM Cortex-M4 MCU, and the MAX30101 PPG sensor. Furthermore, we also discuss how the results of our flow would change for other, more memory-constrained targets. On PPGDalia, the best performing model obtained with our flow,\ncoupled with a simple smoothing post-processing, achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 4.36 BPM, and includes ≈\\approx 269k trainable parameters. With an additional fine-tuning step, the MAE is further reduced to 3.61 BPM.\nAfter quantization and deployment on the STM32WB55, the smallest model with a MAE << 8 BPM and the most accurate one consume 1.79 mJ and 47.65 mJ per inference, with a latency of 71.6 ms, and 1.9 s, and an error of 7.73 BPM and 4.41 BPM, respectively.\nThese two models are respectively 32154.3-145.63×\\times smaller and require 3711.1-19.6×\\times fewer operations per inference compared to the previous state-of-the-art DL solution 0, while also significantly improving the HR tracking accuracy. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.\nSection II provides an overview of the existing PPG-based HR estimation algorithms.\nSection III provides the required background.\nSection IV describes the proposed optimization methodology, while Section V presents the experimental results and their discussion.\nLastly, Section VI concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: of one or more Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs) that periodically emit light onto the skin and a photodetector (i.e., a photodiode) that measures the variations of light intensity caused by blood flow  [ref]5.
