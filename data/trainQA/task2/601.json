      "content": "Paper Title: Accuracy Prediction with Non-neural Model for Neural Architecture Search\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNeural architecture search¬†(NAS), which aims to automatically find neural network architectures, has been studied and shown its effectiveness in many tasks such as image classification¬† , object detection¬† , network pruning¬†, neural machine translation¬†, text to speech¬†. Representative NAS methods include reinforcement learning based¬† , evolutionary algorithms based¬†[ref]27 9, Bayesian methods based¬†, gradient based¬†[ref]22 9, Monte Carlo Tree Search¬†(MCTS) based¬†   and accuracy predictor based methods¬†[ref]22  . Among them, accuracy predictor based approaches, in which an accuracy predictor is used to predict the accuracy of candidate architectures in the search space and save the huge cost induced by training/evaluating these candidate architectures, are simple yet effective. Previous works¬† 8 [ref]22  usually employ neural network based models such as recurrent neural network¬†(RNN), convolutional neural network¬†(CNN), graph convolutional network¬†(GCN) to build the predictor. Though neural predictors¬†(i.e., neural network based predictors) have shown promising performance. They are easy to overfit and require delicate design¬†[ref]22  . Observing that the discrete representations of architectures are more like tabular data that are preferred by non-neural models¬†(e.g., tree based models)111Generally speaking, raw image/text/speech data with spatial or temporal smoothness is preferred by neural networks, graph data is preferred by graph neural networks, while tabular data is preferred by tree based models.,\nin this paper, we consider an alternative approach and explore how to build the accuracy predictor based on gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT). Our proposed NAS algorithm with a GBDT based predictor works as follows: 1) We reformulate the general representation of an architecture into one-hot features to make it suitable for GBDT. Given an architecture, we denote the presence or absence of an operator as 1 or 0. For example, we show two architectures and their features in Table¬†1. 2) A GBDT predictor is trained with a few architecture-accuracy pairs. 3) The trained GBDT is used to predict the accuracy of more architectures in the search space and architectures with top predicted accuracy are selected for further evaluation. We call this algorithm GBDT-NAS. Predicting the accuracy for all the candidate architectures is costly for large search space in real applications¬†(e.g., search space of MobileNet-V3 is roughly 1‚Äãe‚Äã271ùëí271e27), which can take billions of years. Most predictor based methods¬† choose to randomly sample a number of architectures from the search space to predict rather than all the architectures, resulting in sub-optimal result. Therefore, a compact search space can simplify the search process and help NAS to find better architectures with better sample efficiency. As GBDT is easier to tell the importance/contribution of a feature (i.e., the presence or absence of a candidate network operation), in order to improve sample efficiency, we propose to find not-well-performed candidate operations and prune them from the search space before searching for good architectures. Consequently, we propose to perform NAS by first pruning the search space using the GBDT as a pruner and then searching in the pruned search space using the same GBDT as a predictor, leading to a more efficient and effective NAS method which we call GBDT-NAS with search space search¬†(GBDT-NAS-S3). Extensive experiments on NASBench-101 and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. Specifically, on NASBench-101, GBDT-NAS is 22x, 8x and 6x more sample efficient than random search, regularized evolution¬†[ref]27 and MCTS¬† respectively. It achieves 24.2%percent24.224.2\\% top-1 error rate on ImageNet. Moreover, GBDT-NAS-S3 achieves 23.4%percent23.423.4\\% top-1 error rate on ImageNet. To sum up, our main contributions are listed as follows: We explore non-neural models (GBDT) as the accuracy predictor to better learn the representation of architectures and perform architecture search¬†(GBDT-NAS), and show that it leads to better prediction accuracy against neural network based predictors. We further propose to first prune the search space using GBDT as a pruner and then conduct architecture search using GBDT as a predictor¬†(GBDT-NAS-S3), which makes the overall search process more efficient and effective. Experiments on NASBench-101 and ImageNet verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed GBDT-NAS and GBDT-NAS-S3.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: classification¬† , object detection¬† , network pruning¬†, neural machine translation¬†, text to speech¬†.
