      "content": "Paper Title: Crowdsharing Wireless Energy Services\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe pervasive presence of wireless sensors and embedded systems has enabled physical devices to connect to the Internet (i.e., Internet of Things (IoT)) . IoT devices’ capabilities are augmented with sensors, computing resources, and network connectivity. Abstracting the capabilities of IoT devices using the service paradigm provides novel IoT services . IoT services are defined by their functional and non-functional properties. An example of IoT services is sensing health-related information by a smartwatch. The functionality of the services is sensing bio-signals from the body. The accuracy of signals and their freshness represent the non-functional, known as Quality of Service (QoS), properties . Crowdsourcing IoT services creates a self-sustained, fast, and inexpensive IoT ecosystem . People may exchange a wide range of IoT services using the augmented capabilities of their IoT devices. For example, a set of co-located smartphones in a coffee shop may share their idle computing power to any resource-constrained IoT user in the vicinity . Another example is a smartphone with low battery power which may elect to receive energy from nearby IoT devices using WiFi [ref]8. Our focus is on providing a platform for crowdsourcing energy services, also known as crowdsharing energy, among IoT devices, anytime and anywhere. Crowdsharing energy presents a novel solution to overcome the increasing demand of energy by IoT devices. Several technologies have been developed over the time to address the energy constraint in the IoT environment (See Fig.1). Thus far, IoT devices have depended heavily on the power grid 0. Recently, new technologies and solutions have been developed to rely on renewable energy as an alternative resource of energy 0. We propose the energy crowdsharing paradigm as an alternative clean and enhanced source to charge IoT devices. The energy crowdsharing paradigm leveraging energy harvesting, wireless charging, and crowdsourcing give rise to the concept of crowdsharing energy services. We introduce energy service as the wireless exchange of energy among battery-based IoT devices 1. Crowdsharing energy refers to opportunistically crowdsourcing energy services to charge nearby devices. An energy provider refers to an IoT device that can share energy. An energy consumer is an IoT device that needs energy. We focus on using wearables and IoT devices in the energy crowdsharing paradigm. Wearables refer to IoT devices that can be worn or hand-helds like smart shirts, and smartphones 23. Wearables have the ability to harvest energy from natural resources, e.g., body heat or kinetic activity 4. For instance, Solar Shirt uses flexible solar panels to harvest solar energy and stores it in a battery 5. The harvested energy can be shared with nearby IoT devices as an energy service. Energy services may be achieved with the emergence of new technologies known as “Over-the-Air wireless charging” 6. For example, Energous developed a technology to enable wireless charging up to a distance of 4.5 meters111www.energous.com. The energy crowdsharing paradigm in the IoT environment has a twofold impact on both IoT users and the environment. (i) The idea of recycling spare energy promotes a green IoT environment by depending less on the power grid to charge IoT devices. (ii) Enabling wireless charging between IoT devices provides convenience to IoT users and less apprehension to charge their devices. The convenience is a result of allowing IoT users to acquire energy anywhere and anytime from surrounding devices. We introduce the concept of crowdsourced IoT energy market where IoT devices exchange energy services. The market could be created by a group of IoT users in a microcell (See Fig 2). A microcell is a confined area in a smart city where people may gather such as coffee shops, restaurants, and museums. The prospected crowdsourced IoT energy market is a dynamic environment consisting of providers and consumers that move spatially and temporally across microcells boundaries. The deployment of this crowdsourced market is strongly dependent on the participation of IoT devices. Energy consumers may subscribe to the crowdsharing ecosystem to fulfill their energy requirements. Energy providers, on the other hand, may share their harvested or spare energy altruistically to contribute to a green IoT environment. They also may be motivated by egotistic purposes through a set of incentives 7. Due to the limited resources of wearables, a single energy request may not be fulfilled by one energy service 1. In such cases, we may need to combine (i.e. compose) multiple energy services for one request or vise versa. Additionally, energy service providers and consumers may have different Spatio-temporal preferences. Therefore, these preferences have to be considered in advertising, matching, and composing energy services and requests. This paper maps out a strategy to leverage the emerging technologies of energy harvesting and wireless power transfer to unlock the full potential of the energy crowdsharing paradigm. We envision the architecture of a green energy ecosystem where IoT devices may exchange energy seamlessly. We identify the major obstacles that hinder the development and potential deployment of the crowdsourced IoT energy market in the real world. We propose and draw a road map for future research directions to achieve this novel vision. The remaining of the paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the advantages of the energy crowdsharing ecosystem. Section III presents the architecture of the ecosystem. Section IV discusses in detail the uprising challenges to implement the envisioned ecosystem. Section V highlights the future research directions. Section VI concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: computing power to any resource-constrained IoT user in the vicinity .
