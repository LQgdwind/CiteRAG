This research was supported in part by NSF under Grant CCF-2300356.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe consider several classical problems on G‚Äã(P)G(P). These problems are all NP-hard. However, little attention has been given to special configurations of points, such as when the points are in convex position, despite the potential for significant algorithmic simplifications in such cases. In this paper, we systematically study these problems under the condition that the points of PP are in convex position (i.e., every point of PP appears as a vertex in the convex hull of PP) and present efficient algorithms. We hope our results can lead to efficient solutions to other problems in this setting. A dominating set of G‚Äã(P)G(P) is a subset SS of vertices of G‚Äã(P)G(P) such that each vertex of G‚Äã(P)G(P) is either in SS or adjacent to a vertex in SS. The dominating set problem, which seeks a dominating set of smallest size, is a classical NP-hard problem¬†  . In the weighted case, each point of PP has a weight and the problem is to find a dominating set of minimum total weight. The dominating set problem has been widely studied, with various approximation algorithms proposed¬†   7. To the best of our knowledge, we are not aware of any previous work under the convex position assumption. For the unweighted case, we present an algorithm of O‚Äã(k‚Äãn‚Äãlog‚Å°n)O(kn\\log n) time, where kk is the smallest dominating set size of G‚Äã(P)G(P). For the weighted case, we derive an algorithm of O‚Äã(n3‚Äãlog2‚Å°n)O(n^{3}\\log^{2}n) time. In particular, given any kk, our algorithm can compute in O‚Äã(k‚Äãn2‚Äãlog2‚Å°n)O(kn^{2}\\log^{2}n) time a minimum-weight dominating set of size at most kk. A closely related problem is the discrete kk-center problem. Given a number kk, the problem is to compute a subset of kk points in PP (called centers) such that the maximum distance between any point in PP and its nearest center is minimized. The problem, which is NP-hard¬†, is also a classical problem with applications in clustering, facility locations, and network design.\nAn algorithm for the dominating set problem can be used to solve the decision version of the discrete kk-center problem: Given a value rr and kk, decide whether there exists a subset of kk centers such that the distance from any point in PP to its nearest center is at most rr. Indeed, if we define the unit-disk graph of PP with respect to rr, then a dominating set of size kk in the graph is a discrete kk-center of PP for rr, and vice versa. For the convex position case, we are not aware of any previous work. We propose an algorithm whose runtime is O‚Äã(min‚Å°{n4/3‚Äãlog‚Å°n+k‚Äãn‚Äãlog2‚Å°n,k2‚Äãn‚Äãlog2‚Å°n})O(\\min\\{n^{4/3}\\log n+kn\\log^{2}n,k^{2}n\\log^{2}n\\}). In particular, if k=O‚Äã(1)k=O(1), then the runtime is O‚Äã(n‚Äãlog2‚Å°n)O(n\\log^{2}n). An independent set of G‚Äã(P)G(P) is a subset of the vertices such that no two vertices have an edge.\nThe maximum independent set problem is to find an independent set of the largest cardinality. The problem of finding a maximum independent set in G‚Äã(P)G(P) is NP-hard¬†. Many approximation algorithms for the problem have been developed in the literature, e.g.,¬†   . Under the convex position assumption, using the technique of Singireddy, Basappa, and Mitchell¬† for a dispersion problem (more details to be discussed later), one can find a maximum independent set in G‚Äã(P)G(P) in O‚Äã(n6‚Äãlog‚Å°n)O(n^{6}\\log n) time. We give a new algorithm of O‚Äã(n7/2)O(n^{7/2}) time,111Throughout the paper, the algorithm runtime is deterministic unless otherwise stated. and another randomized algorithm of O‚Äã(n37/11)O(n^{37/11}) expected time using the recent randomized result of Agarwal, Ezra, and Sharir¬†. Furthermore, our algorithms can be extended to compute a maximum-weight independent set of G‚Äã(P)G(P) within the same time complexities when points of PP have weights; specifically, a maximum-weight independent set is an independent set whose total vertex weight is maximized.\nSince the vertices of a graph other than those in an independent set form a vertex cover, our algorithm can also compute a minimum-weight vertex cover of G‚Äã(P)G(P) in O‚Äã(n7/2)O(n^{7/2}) time or in randomized O‚Äã(n37/11)O(n^{37/11}) expected time. Furthermore, we consider a small-size case that is to find an (unweighted) independent set of size 33 in G‚Äã(P)G(P). If PP is not necessarily in convex position, the problem has been studied by Agarwal, Overmars, and Sharir¬†, who presented an O‚Äã(n4/3‚Äãlog2‚Å°n)O(n^{4/3}\\log^{2}n) time algorithm. We consider the convex position case and derive an algorithm of O‚Äã(n‚Äãlog‚Å°n)O(n\\log n) time. Note that finding an independent set of size 22 is equivalent to computing a farthest pair of points of PP, which can be done in O‚Äã(n‚Äãlog‚Å°n)O(n\\log n) time using the farthest Voronoi diagram¬†. In addition, we consider a more general small-size case that is to find a maximum-weight independent set of size 33 in G‚Äã(P)G(P) when points of PP have weights and are not necessarily in convex position. Our algorithm runs in O‚Äã(n5/3+Œ¥)O(n^{5/3+\\delta}) time; throughout the paper, Œ¥\\delta refers to an arbitrarily small positive constant. Our technique can also be used to find a maximum-weight clique of size 33 in G‚Äã(P)G(P) within the same time complexity. In addition, we show that a maximum-weight independent set or clique of size 22 can be found in n4/3‚Äã2O‚Äã(log‚àó‚Å°n)n^{4/3}2^{O(\\log^{*}n)} time.\nAll these algorithms also work for computing the minimum-weight independent set or clique.\nWe are not aware of any previous work on these weighted problems. As mentioned above, the problem of finding an (unweighted) independent set of size 33 can be solved in O‚Äã(n4/3‚Äãlog2‚Å°n)O(n^{4/3}\\log^{2}n) time¬†. It is also known that finding an (unweighted) clique of size 33 in a disk graph (not necessarily unit-disk graph) can be done in O‚Äã(n‚Äãlog‚Å°n)O(n\\log n) time¬†[ref]37. As mentioned above, a related problem is the dispersion problem (also called maximally separated set problem¬†). Given PP and a number kk, the problem is to find a subset of kk points from PP so that their minimum pairwise distance is maximized. The problem is NP-hard¬†. An algorithm for the independent set problem of G‚Äã(P)G(P) can be used as a decision algorithm for the dispersion problem: Given a value rr, we can decide whether PP has a subset of kk points whose minimum pairwise distance is larger than rr using the independent set algorithm (i.e., by defining an edge for two points in the graph if their distance is at most rr). Under the convex position assumption, Singireddy, Basappa, and Mitchell¬† previously gave an O‚Äã(n4‚Äãk2)O(n^{4}k^{2}) time algorithm for the problem. Using our independent set algorithm as a decision procedure and doing binary search among the interpoint distances of PP, we present a new algorithm that can solve the problem in O‚Äã(n7/2‚Äãlog‚Å°n)O(n^{7/2}\\log n) time, or in randomized O‚Äã(n37/11‚Äãlog‚Å°n)O(n^{37/11}\\log n) expected time. For a special case where k=3k=3, the algorithm of  solves the problem in O‚Äã(n4/3‚Äãlog3‚Å°n)O(n^{4/3}\\log^{3}n) time even if the points of PP are not in convex position. Our new algorithm, which works on the convex-position case only, runs in O‚Äã(n‚Äãlog2‚Å°n)O(n\\log^{2}n) time. This is achieved using parametric search¬†4  with our independent set algorithm as a decision algorithm. In addition, with our decision algorithm and Chan‚Äôs randomized technique¬†3, we can obtain a randomized algorithm of O‚Äã(n‚Äãlog‚Å°n)O(n\\log n) expected time. We note that a recent work¬† proposed another algorithm of O‚Äã(n2)O(n^{2}) time, apparently unaware of the result in .\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: O‚Äã(n4/3‚Äãlog2‚Å°n)O(n^{4/3}\\log^{2}n) time¬†.

As mentioned above, a related problem is the dispersion problem (also called maximally separated set problem¬†). Given PP and a number kk, the problem is to find a subset of kk points from PP\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
