      "content": "Paper Title: Topic Modeling on Podcast Short-Text Metadata\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPodcasts is an audio content listened to on-demand for educational, entertainment, or informational purposes.\nKnown as the ‚Äùspoken‚Äù version of blog posts, they have evolved towards a wide variety of formats (e.g. monologues, multi-party conversations, narratives) spanning a wide range of categories (e.g. business, true crime).\nPodcasts have been massively popularised in the recent years due to increased use of streaming platforms and availability of underlying technology for information access, recording and publishing [ref]11  .\nAs of summer 2021, the number of available podcasts in the world exceeds 2‚ÄãM2ùëÄ2M and over 48‚ÄãM48ùëÄ48M episodes .\nLikewise, the podcast listening audience has grown massively: 50%percent5050\\% of the American population has listened to at least a podcast in 2019 and over 32%percent3232\\% have listened to podcasts monthly (compared to 14%percent1414\\% in 2014) . Given the sharp growing interest in podcasts, researchers and industry players have searched for more suitable ways to enable listeners to effectively navigate these overwhelming collections [ref]3   .\nTopics are central to any of the adopted podcast information access technology such as automatic categorization, search engines or recommender systems.\nHowever, annotating podcasts with topics is still quite problematic.\nFirst, although podcast metadata entails topic-related genres, manually assigned by creators or providers, in reality these are often noisy and unreliable [ref]11 : genres could be too heterogeneous or broad (e.g. Kids & Family includes both sleep meditation and parenting advice);\nand podcast providers may misleadingly label their shows with unrelated genres for broadening exposure.\nSecond, using topic modeling has its limitations inherited from the input text associated with podcasts:\n1) metadata, such as title or description, is typically a short text of varying quality;\n2) the automatically transcribed speech is noisy having a high word-error-rate especially for NEs and requires the engagement of more resources [ref]3  [ref]11. In the current work, we revisit the feasibility of discovering relevant topics from podcast metadata, titles and descriptions, usually documented by podcast providers, creators, or editors.\nWhile previous work [ref]3 found podcast metadata less promising for topic-informed search compared to when using podcast transcripts, we hypothesize that it could still be a very useful data source for topic modeling when exploited with appropriate technology.\nIf proven feasible, topic modeling on podcast metadata can be a more economic alternative than automatically extracting and exploiting transcripts of a rapidly growing podcast corpus.\nAdditionally, the discovery of topics directly from metadata offers many opportunities for improved podcast retrieval.\nIdentifying podcast categories at different granularity levels could help editors evolve manually created podcast taxonomies and automatically annotate podcasts with these categories.\nThe discovered topics could also support the consolidation of podcast knowledge graphs  [ref]11, recently exploited in recommendation, by adding new edges that capture topic-informed podcast similarity based on metadata. First, we take advantage of advancements in topic modeling, and benchmark multiple algorithms designed for short text on three podcast datasets.\nTwo of these datasets are public: one from Spotify  and one from iTunes 3.\nWe have built a third dataset using Deezer222https://www.deezer.com/us/, an online service providing a large podcast catalog.\nThis dataset is the largest with both titles and descriptions available at the podcast level.\nSecond, we propose a strategy to leverage NEs, frequently present in podcast titles and descriptions, in a NMF topic modeling framework.\nAs we can see in the following example: Shields Up! Podcast: Join Chris and Nev as they talk about their favourite Star Trek episodes covering everything from TOS to Lower Decks, the metadata contains multiple NEs regarding the name of the speakers (Join Chris and\nNev), but also the podcast topic (Star Trek, TOS and Lower Decks).\nBy injecting cues from NEs in topic modeling, we improve over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods using plain word embeddings, and show that the data sparsity (very low co-occurrences of semantically related terms) due to short text can be further alleviated. To sum up the contributions of this work are: a)¬†the most extensive study to date of topic modeling on podcast metadata, covering popular SOTA algorithms for short text and datasets from major podcast streaming platforms; b)¬†NEiCE, a new NE-informed document representation for topic modeling with NMF, as an extension of CluWords¬†‚Äîour approach improves topic coherence over baselines in most evaluated cases; c)¬†a new podcast dataset entailing English-language titles and descriptions from Deezer, an online service providing a podcast catalog, that is the largest in terms of the number of podcasts / shows.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: have been massively popularised in the recent years due to increased use of streaming platforms and availability of underlying technology for information access, recording and publishing [ref]11  .\nAs of summer 2021, the number of available podcasts in the world exceeds 2‚ÄãM2ùëÄ2M and over 48‚ÄãM48ùëÄ48M episodes .\nLikewise, the podcast listening audience has grown massively:\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
