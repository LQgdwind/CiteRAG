      "content": "Paper Title: ImPress: Securing DRAM Against Data-Disturbance Errors via Implicit Row-Press Mitigation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRowhammer  occurs when a row (aggressor) is activated frequently, causing bit-flips in nearby rows (victim). The number of activations to an aggressor row to cause a bit-flip in a victim row is called the Rowhammer threshold (TRH). Solutions for mitigating RH must ensure that the victim rows get refreshed before the aggressor row incurs TRH activations. Typical solutions for mitigating RH rely on a tracking mechanism to identify aggressor rows, and performing a mitigative refresh on the victim rows. Aggressor-row identification could be done either using activation-counters       or probabilistically[ref]16   [ref]16. The tracking can be done at the Memory-Controller (MC) or transparently inside the DRAM chip (in-DRAM). The advantage of in-DRAM tracking is the potential to solve the RH problem inside of the DRAM, without relying on other parts of the system. DDR5 provides support for in-DRAM tracking with Refresh Management (RFM). Without loss of generality, we analyze the following four trackers in our study. Graphene  (Counters, MC-Based): Graphene uses Misra-Gries algorithm to identify rows that reach TRH activations and issue a mitigation. The number of tracking entries (per bank) is inversely proportional to the threshold. PARA  (Probabilistic, MC-Based): PARA selects each activation for mitigation with a probability p, which is determined based on a target failure rate. Mithril  (Counters, in-DRAM): Mithril uses Counter-based Summary to identify heavily activated row. Mitigation is performed on receiving the RFM command (sent by MC every RFMTH activations) for the row with the highest count. The number of entries depends on RFMTH and TRH. MINT  (Probabilistic, in-DRAM): MINT is our concurrent work that achieves secure mitigation with just a single entry per bank. At each RFM, MINT mitigates the identified aggressor row, and randomly selects which activation slot in the upcoming RFMTH activations will be selected for mitigation. These trackers are designed to provide secure RH tolerance for a specific TRH. However, if the attacker can cause bit-flips in fewer than TRH activations, then the attacker can break all of these designs. A new vulnerability makes this possible.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: mechanism to identify aggressor rows, and performing a mitigative refresh on the victim rows.
