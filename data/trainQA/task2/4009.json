      "content": "Paper Title: Truly Deterministic Policy Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConservative Policy Iteration (CPI)  was one of the early dimensionally consistent methods with a surrogate of the form ℒπ1​(π2)=ηπ1+11−γ⋅𝔼s∼ρμπ1​[Aπ1​(s,π2)]−C2​TV2(π1,π2)subscriptℒsubscript𝜋1subscript𝜋2subscript𝜂subscript𝜋1⋅11𝛾subscript𝔼similar-to𝑠superscriptsubscript𝜌𝜇subscript𝜋1delimited-[]superscript𝐴subscript𝜋1𝑠subscript𝜋2𝐶2superscriptTV2subscript𝜋1subscript𝜋2\\mathcal{L}_{\\pi_{1}}(\\pi_{2})=\\eta_{\\pi_{1}}+\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}\\cdot\\mathbb{E}_{s\\sim\\rho_{\\mu}^{\\pi_{1}}}[A^{\\pi_{1}}(s,\\pi_{2})]-\\frac{C}{2}\\operatorname*{TV}^{2}(\\pi_{1},\\pi_{2}). The C𝐶C coefficient guarantees non-decreasing payoffs. However, CPI is limited to linear function approximation classes due to the update rule πnew←(1−α)​πold+α​π′←subscript𝜋new1𝛼subscript𝜋old𝛼superscript𝜋′\\pi_{\\text{new}}\\leftarrow(1-\\alpha)\\pi_{\\text{old}}+\\alpha\\pi^{\\prime}. This lead to the design of the Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) [ref]47 algorithm. TRPO exchanged the bounded squared TV distance with the KL divergence by lower bounding it using the Pinsker inequality. This made TRPO closer to the Natural Policy Gradient algorithm, and for Gaussian policies, the modified terms had similar Taylor expansions within small trust regions. Confined trust regions are a stable way of making large updates and avoiding pessimistic coefficients. For gradient estimates, TRPO used Importance Sampling (IS) with a baseline shift: While empirical 𝔼​[Aπ1​(s,π2)]𝔼delimited-[]superscript𝐴subscript𝜋1𝑠subscript𝜋2\\mathbb{E}[A^{\\pi_{1}}(s,\\pi_{2})] and 𝔼​[Qπ1​(s,π2)]𝔼delimited-[]superscript𝑄subscript𝜋1𝑠subscript𝜋2\\mathbb{E}[Q^{\\pi_{1}}(s,\\pi_{2})] estimates yield identical variances in principle, the importance sampling estimator in (12) imposes larger variances. Later, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)  proposed utilizing the Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) method for variance reduction and incorporated first-order smoothing like ADAM . GAE employed Temporal-Difference (TD) learning  for variance reduction. Although TD-learning was not theoretically guaranteed to converge and could add bias, it improved the estimation accuracy. As an alternative to IS, deterministic policy gradient estimators were also utilized in an actor-critic fashion. Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) [ref]32 generalized deterministic gradients by employing Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) [ref]36 for variance reduction. Twin Delayed Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3)  improved DDPG’s approximation to build an even better policy optimization method. Although both methods used deterministic policies, they still performed stochastic search by adding stochastic noise to the deterministic policies to force exploration. Other lines of stochastic policy optimization were later proposed. Wu et al.  used a Kronecker-factored approximation for curvatures. Haarnoja et al.  proposed a maximum entropy actor-critic method for stochastic policy optimization.\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: This lead to the design of the Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) [ref]47 algorithm.
