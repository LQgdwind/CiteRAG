      "content": "Paper Title: Simplex Clustering via ùöúùô±ùöéùöùùöä with Applications to Online Adjustment of Black-Box Predictions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe consider the One-Shot classification problem, in which a model is evaluated based on its ability to generalize to new classes from a single labelled example per class. Typically, One-Shot methods use the labelled support set ùíÆùíÆ\\mathcal{S} of each task to build a classifier and obtain soft predictions for unlabelled query sample. Once soft-predictions have been obtained, proposed k-sBetas can be used to further refine predictions by clustering soft predictions of the entire query set. \n Setup. We use two standard benchmarks for One-Shot classification: mini-Imagenet [ref]45 and tiered-Imagenet . The mini-Imagenet benchmark is composed of 60,000 color images [ref]45 equally split among 100 classes, themselves split between train, val and test following [ref]47. The tiered-Imagenet benchmark is a larger dataset with 779,165 images and 608 classes, split following . All images are resized to 84√ó84848484\\times 84. Regarding the networks, we use the pre-trained RN-18 [ref]48 and WRN28-10  provided by . Only 15 unlabeled query data points per class are available during each separate task so we use the biased version of k-sBetas. As for the methods, we select one inductive method: SimpleSHOT  and one transductive method: BD-CSPN . Each One-Shot method is reproduced using the set of hyperparameters suggested in the original papers. \n Results. Table IV shows that all along these experiments, k-sBetas consistently improves in terms of NMI and Accuracy scores the output predictions of SimpleSHOT and BD-CSPN.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: proposed k-sBetas can be used to further refine predictions by clustering soft predictions of the entire query set. \n Setup. We use two standard benchmarks for One-Shot classification: mini-Imagenet [ref]45 and tiered-Imagenet . The mini-Imagenet benchmark is composed of 60,000 color images [ref]45 equally split among 100 classes, themselves split between train, val and test following [ref]47.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
