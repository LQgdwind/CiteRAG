Here we briefly discuss a few studies that investigate the fairness issue. Both works of  and  have studied the income inequality among rideshare drivers. However, they mainly considered a complete offline setting where the information of all agents in the system including drivers and riders is known in advance. They justified that by focusing a short window and thus, all agents can be assumed offline. There are several other works that considered fairness in matching in an offline setting where all agents’ information is given as part of the input, see, e.g., [ref]34 [ref]35. Nanda et al.  proposed a bi-objective online-matching-based model to study the tradeoff between the system efficiency (profit) and the fairness among rideshare riders during high-demand hours. In contrast,  Xu and Xu  presented a similar model to examine the tradeoff between the system efficiency and the income equality among rideshare drivers. Unlike focusing on one single objective of fairness maximization like here, both studies in  and  seek to balance the objective of fairness maximization with that of profit maximization. Recently, Ma et al.  considered a similar problem to us but focus on the fairness among online agents. Manshadi et al.  studied fair online rationing such that each arriving agent can receive a fair share of resources proportional to its demand. The fairness issue has been studied in other domains/applications as well, see, e.g., online selection of candidates [ref]40, influence maximization , bandit-based online learning   , online resource allocation  , and classification .\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: all agents can be assumed offline.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
