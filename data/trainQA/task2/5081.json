      "content": "Paper Title: Hierarchical Estimation for Effective and Efficient Sampling Graph Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph representation learning has received sustained attention in recent years. Different from Euclidean data, the complex structure between each node in one graph leads relevant algorithms difficult to learn effectively. Traditional works such as Deepwalk  and Node2Vec  learn node embeddings with serialization modeling while LINE  captures node features by defining structural similarities. With the rapid development of deep learning, Applying neural network models which have stronger expressive ability for graph representation learning has become a research hotspot. Inspired by convolutional neural network (CNN) , , one of the representative models of deep learning, Kipf et al.  develops graph convolution network which has successfully kicked off the employment of graph neural network (GNN) on graph. However, the dramatic increase in the graph scale has challenged the effective and efficient training of GNN severely. As a result, numerous studies have been carried out to reduce the neighbour’s size involved in the information aggregation of each node. For example, Dropedge 3 randomly removes a certain number of edges to speed up the training, and GAS  processes mini-batch-based GNN with historical embeddings to prune the computation graph. In the meantime, several studies reduce the size of computation graphs by using sampling methods and have designed promising scalable GNN models innovatively [ref]2, 7, 8, 9, , , , , , . These sampling based methods demonstrate efficient training process and maintain the effective expressive ability of GNN. On account of competitive performance of these sampling based methods, sampling to design scalable GNN has become one of the mainstream methods rapidly. To conclude, there consists of three sampling paradigms, i.e., node-wise sampling, layer-wise sampling, and subgraph sampling. Studies on Node-wise Sampling.\nSampling based GraphSAGE [ref]2 controls the number of neighbors involved in the embedding aggregation to a small constant for each node. This sampling strategy is unbiased but the small number of samples may increase variance. VRGCN 7 and MVSGNN  makes variance analysis of node-wise sampling by focusing on the difference between the representation of history and that of present which reduces the variance successfully. However, this paradigm still faces the problem of exponentially increase in neighbor’s size, thus losing its scalability when the layers are stacked deepeer. Studies on Layer-wise Sampling.\nLayer-wise sampling is developed with the fixed-size node sets sampled at each layer. However, the circular dependency hinders achieving the minimum variance node sampler. In view of this dilemma, FastGCN 8 detaches the sampling probability from the dependency on the norm of hidden embeddings. Nevertheless, FastGCN cannot guarantee that sampled node sets between each layer are densely connected, which may result in large variances. Therefore, LADIES 9 modified the adjacency matrix for alleviating the sparseness problem caused by independent layer sampling. Additionally, ASGCN  approximated the norm in probability distribution with modified graph attention ,  to further improve the aggregation results. But the calculation of attention costs too much time for sampling. Studies on Subgraph Sampling.\nSubgraph sampling constructs several subgraphs from original graph and learns the embeddings of nodes in each subgraph respectively. In subgraph sampling paradigm, the sampling probability is shared in all layers is and sampling is conducted only once before the training. For example, ClusterGCN  applies graph clustering algorithms to partition the original graph into several subgraphs. Though easy to implement, ClusterGCN inevitably introduces bias in embeddings aggregation and suffers huge costs on pre-processing the graph partition. Different from ClusterGCN, GraphSAINT  employs several well-developed samplers consisting of classical node sampler and edge sampler for devision to maginificantly speed up the preprocessing. But the studies in GraphSAINT doesn’t consider the key elements, i. e. node embeddings.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: to prune the computation graph.
