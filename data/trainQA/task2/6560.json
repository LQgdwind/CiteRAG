      "content": "Paper Title: Goal-Conditioned Predictive Coding for Offline Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGoal-conditioned imitation learning  [ref]15 [ref]20 has recently emerged as a promising approach to solve offline reinforcement learning problems. Instead of relying on value-based methods, they directly learn a policy that maps states and goals (e.g. expected returns, or target states) to the actions. This is achieved by supervised learning on offline collected trajectories (i.e. sequences of state, action, and reward triplets). This learning paradigm enables the resulting framework to avoid bootstrapping for reward propagation, a member of the “Deadly Triad”  of RL which is known to lead to unstable optimization when combining with function approximation and off-policy learning, and also allows the model to leverage large amounts of collected trajectories and demonstrations.\nThe emergence of RL as supervised learning on trajectory data coincides with the recent success of the Transformer architecture  [ref]20 and its applications to sequence modeling, such as GPT  for natural language and VPT  for videos. Indeed, several recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of sequence modeling for offline RL [ref]10  4    . Most of these approaches apply the Transformer architecture to jointly learn the trajectory representation and the policy. When the sequence models are unrolled into the future, they can also serve as “world models”   for many RL applications. By leveraging advanced sequence modeling objectives from language and visual domains   , such methods have shown competitive performance in various challenging tasks  . Despite the enthusiasm and progress, the necessity of sequence modeling for offline reinforcement learning has been questioned by recent work [ref]15: With a simple but properly tuned neural architecture (e.g. a multilayer perceptron), the trained agents can achieve competitive performance on several challenging tasks while taking only the current state and the overall goal as model inputs. In some tasks, these agents even significantly outperform their counterparts based on sequence modeling. These observations naturally motivate the question: Is explicit sequence modeling of trajectory data necessary for offline RL? And if so, how should it be performed and utilized? To properly study the impact of sequence modeling for decision making, we propose to decouple trajectory representation learning and policy learning. We adopt a two-stage framework, where sequence modeling can be applied to learn the trajectory representation, the policy, or both.\nThe connection between the two stages can be established by leveraging encoded trajectory representations for policy learning, or by transferring the model architecture and weights (i.e. the policy can be initialized with the same pre-trained model used for trajectory representation learning). These stages can be trained separately, or jointly and end-to-end. This design not only facilitates analyzing the impacts of sequence modeling, but is also general such that prior methods can be considered as specific instances, including those that perform joint policy learning and trajectory representation learning [ref]10 4 , and those that learn a policy directly without sequence modeling [ref]15. Concretely, we aim at investigating the following questions: (1) Are offline trajectories helpful due to sequence modeling, or simply by providing more data for supervised policy learning? (2) What would be the most effective trajectory representation learning objectives to support policy learning? Should the sequence models learn to encode history experiences [ref]10, future dynamics , or both ? (3) As the same sequence modeling framework may be employed for both trajectory representation learning and policy learning 4  , should they share the same training objectives or not? We design and conduct experiments on the AntMaze, FrankaKitchen, and Locomotion environments to answer these questions. We observe that sequence modeling, if properly designed, can effectively aid decision-making when its resulting trajectory representation is used as an input for policy learning. We also find that there is a discrepancy between the optimal self-supervised objective for trajectory representation learning, and that for policy learning. These observations motivate us to propose a specific design of the two-stage framework: It compresses trajectory information into compact bottlenecks via sequence modeling pre-training. The condensed representation is then used for policy learning with a simple MLP-based policy network.\nWe observe that goal-conditioned predictive coding (GCPC) is the most effective trajectory representation learning objective. It enables competitive performance across all benchmarks, particularly for long-horizon tasks. We attribute the strong empirical performance of GCPC to the acquisition of goal-conditioned latent representations about the future, which provide crucial guidance for decision making. To summarize, our main contributions include: We propose to decouple sequence modeling for decision making into a two-stage framework, namely trajectory representation learning and policy learning. It provides a unified view for several recent reinforcement learning via supervised learning methods. We conduct a principled empirical exploration with our framework to understand if and when sequence modeling of offline trajectory data benefits policy learning. We discover that goal-conditioned predictive coding (GCPC) serves as the most effective sequence modeling objective to support policy learning. Our overall framework achieves competitive performance on AntMaze, FrankaKitchen and Gym Locomotion benchmarks.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: Goal-conditioned imitation learning  [ref]15 [ref]20 has recently emerged as a promising approach to solve offline reinforcement learning problems.
