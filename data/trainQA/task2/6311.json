      "content": "Paper Title: Lightweight Monocular Depth Estimation via Token-Sharing Transformer\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBased on the success of the Vision Transformer (ViT)  on the image classification task, diverse architectures using the Transformer have been extensively studied for various applications.\nDeiT  used distillation learning to reduce the needs of a large dataset.\nSwin Transformer  introduced local-window-based self-attention, which leads to efficient computation of self-attention.\nCompact-T  and Segformer [ref]12 combined CNN and Transformer to boost their performance and reduce computational costs.\nHowever, it is still incompatible with edge devices because of its high computation complexity. Recently, several researchers have utilized the Transformer in resource-constrained edge devices.\nThe existing methods using the Transformer for edge devices can be divided into two categories according to their main focus: 1) reducing the computational cost of the attention mechanism itself   and 2) designing lightweight architecture [ref]11 [ref]12 [ref]14  .\nTo alleviate the computational costs, while the methods in the first category mathematically approximated the attention mechanism, those in the second category proposed hybrid architectures using both CNN and Transformer.\nOur method is grouped into the second category.\nWe conceptually summarize the existing lightweight architectures using the Transformer grouped in the second category. Fig. 2 shows the conceptual description of the existing lightweight architectures and the proposed model.\nThe existing methods can be subdivided into two groups: 1) hierarchy-focused and 2) bottleneck-focused architecture.\nLeViT [ref]11, Segformer [ref]12, and MobileViT [ref]14 are categorized into the first sub-group (See Fig. 2(a)).\nLeViT simply used the Transformers between convolution layers to reduce the number of tokens in each transformer block.\nMobileViT reduced computational costs based on MobileNetV2  backbone with repeated CNN-Transformer blocks. Segformer expanded the usage of CNN layers to overlapped patch merging, which preserves the inductive bias of CNN while fully exploiting the power of the attention mechanism in the Transformer blocks. Efficientformer  and Topformer  are categorized into the second sub-group (See Fig. 2).\nBoth methods used MobileNetV2 as a backbone for their CNN blocks and utilized an output of CNN blocks as an input of the transformer blocks.\nEfficientFormer analyzed various methods using the transformer and proposed several strategies. They observed that the operations of repeated reshaping and permutations in tensors, which are used in the first sub-group, are one of the reasons making the model slow.\nAlso, they observed that layer normalization is inferior to batch normalization to optimize the models.\nBased on the observations, Efficientformer proposed a model with CNN and transformer blocks that run at MobileNet speed.\nTopformer introduced token pyramid pooling, which used the concatenation of feature maps as an input of the transformer blocks, reinforcing the modelâ€™s representation ability. To further improve the aforementioned architectures, we propose Token-Sharing Transformer, which is described in Fig. 2(c). The proposed model achieves the comparable accuracy of hierarchy-focused architecture and throughput of bottleneck-focused architecture. The details of the proposed model and design concept are described in Section III.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: learning to reduce the needs of a large dataset.\nSwin Transformer  introduced local-window-based self-attention, which leads to efficient computation of self-attention.\nCompact-T  and Segformer [ref]12 combined CNN and Transformer to boost their performance and reduce computational costs.\nHowever, it is still incompatible with edge devices because of its high computation complexity.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
