Expanding (4) with the MVD decomposition we obtain ∇ωkJ​(𝝎)=∫cωk​(pωk+​(𝒙;𝝎)−pωk−​(𝒙;𝝎))​f​(𝒙)​d𝒙subscript∇subscript𝜔𝑘𝐽𝝎subscript𝑐subscript𝜔𝑘subscriptsuperscript𝑝subscript𝜔𝑘𝒙𝝎subscriptsuperscript𝑝subscript𝜔𝑘𝒙𝝎𝑓𝒙differential-d𝒙\\nabla_{\\omega_{k}}J(\\bm{\\omega})=\\int c_{\\omega_{k}}\\left(p^{+}_{\\omega_{k}}(\\bm{x};\\bm{\\omega})-p^{-}_{\\omega_{k}}(\\bm{x};\\bm{\\omega})\\right)f(\\bm{x})\\mathop{}\\!\\mathrm{d}\\bm{x}.\nA single gradient estimate for ωksubscript𝜔𝑘\\omega_{k} is given by g^k,iMVD=cωk​(f​(𝒙+;𝝎)−f​(𝒙−;𝝎))superscriptsubscript^𝑔𝑘𝑖MVDsubscript𝑐subscript𝜔𝑘𝑓superscript𝒙𝝎𝑓superscript𝒙𝝎\\hat{g}_{k,i}^{\\textrm{MVD}}=c_{\\omega_{k}}\\left(f(\\bm{x}^{+};\\bm{\\omega})-f(\\bm{x}^{-};\\bm{\\omega})\\right), with 𝒙+∼pωk+​(𝒙;𝝎)similar-tosuperscript𝒙subscriptsuperscript𝑝subscript𝜔𝑘𝒙𝝎\\bm{x}^{+}\\sim p^{+}_{\\omega_{k}}(\\bm{x};\\bm{\\omega}) and 𝒙−∼pωk−​(𝒙;𝝎)similar-tosuperscript𝒙subscriptsuperscript𝑝subscript𝜔𝑘𝒙𝝎\\bm{x}^{-}\\sim p^{-}_{\\omega_{k}}(\\bm{x};\\bm{\\omega}). I.e., the derivative is the difference between the function f𝑓f evaluated at different points sampled according to the decomposition, and scaled with the normalization constant.\nFor example, to compute the derivative of a one-dimensional Gaussian 𝒩​(x;μ,σ)𝒩𝑥𝜇𝜎\\mathcal{N}(x;\\mu,\\sigma) w.r.t. its standard deviation, we can sample the positive part from a Double-sided Maxwell and the negative one from a Gaussian. The gradient w.r.t. all parameters is just the concatenation of the derivatives w.r.t. all single parameters ωksubscript𝜔𝑘\\omega_{k}.\nComputing one gradient estimate for all parameters 𝝎𝝎\\bm{\\omega} is in the order of 𝒪​(2​|𝝎|)𝒪2𝝎\\mathcal{O}\\!\\left(2|\\bm{\\omega}|\\right) queries to f𝑓f, in contrast to the SF and Rep-trick 𝒪​(1)𝒪1\\mathcal{O}\\!\\left(1\\right) complexity. Let g^kMVDsubscriptsuperscript^𝑔MVD𝑘\\hat{g}^{\\textrm{MVD}}_{k} be the estimator of ∇ωk𝔼p​(𝒙;𝝎)​[f​(𝒙)]subscript∇subscript𝜔𝑘subscript𝔼𝑝𝒙𝝎delimited-[]𝑓𝒙\\nabla_{\\omega_{k}}\\mathbb{E}_{p(\\bm{x};\\bm{\\omega})}\\left[f(\\bm{x})\\right], with variance given by [ref]5 which depends on the chosen decomposition and how correlated are the function evaluations at the positive and negative samples.\nA typical choice for variance reduction is to obtain a decomposition such that the positive and negative distributions are orthogonal , such as for the Gaussian mean in Table I.\nMoreover, if f​(𝒙)𝑓𝒙f(\\bm{x}) and f​(𝒙′)𝑓superscript𝒙′f(\\bm{x}^{\\prime}) are positively correlated, then the covariance term is positive and the variance is further reduced.\nThis last term is possibly reduced through coupling, which works by constructing a variate from the negative component 𝒙′superscript𝒙′\\bm{x}^{\\prime} by applying a transformation to the sample from the positive component (or vice-versa), e.g. by using common random numbers, such that they share the same source of randomness.\nA simple example is when computing the gradient w.r.t. the mean of a Gaussian: first we sample a variate from the Weibull distribution 𝒲​(2,2)𝒲22\\mathcal{W}(\\sqrt{2},2) to construct the positive component with μ+σ​𝒲​(2,2)𝜇𝜎𝒲22\\mu+\\sigma\\mathcal{W}(\\sqrt{2},2), and then reuse the same variate to also construct the negative component . Even though this does not guarantee that the function evaluations are positively correlated, it tends to work well in practice [ref]5. If p​(𝒙;𝝎)𝑝𝒙𝝎p(\\bm{x};\\bm{\\omega}) is a multivariate distribution with independent dimensions it factorizes as p​(𝒙;𝝎)=∏i=1np​(xi;𝝃i)𝑝𝒙𝝎superscriptsubscriptproduct𝑖1𝑛𝑝subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝝃𝑖p(\\bm{x};\\bm{\\omega})=\\prod_{i=1}^{n}p(x_{i};\\bm{\\xi}_{i}), with xi∈ℝsubscript𝑥𝑖ℝx_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R} and 𝝃isubscript𝝃𝑖\\bm{\\xi}_{i} a subset of 𝝎𝝎\\bm{\\omega}. For instance, if p​(𝒙;𝝎)𝑝𝒙𝝎p(\\bm{x};\\bm{\\omega}) is a Gaussian with diagonal covariance, then 𝝃i={μi,σi}subscript𝝃𝑖subscript𝜇𝑖subscript𝜎𝑖\\bm{\\xi}_{i}=\\{\\mu_{i},\\sigma_{i}\\}.\nThe derivative w.r.t. one parameter ωk∈𝝃ksubscript𝜔𝑘subscript𝝃𝑘\\omega_{k}\\in\\bm{\\xi}_{k} is given by where pωk+​(𝒙;𝝎)subscriptsuperscript𝑝subscript𝜔𝑘𝒙𝝎p^{+}_{\\omega_{k}}(\\bm{x};\\bm{\\omega}) is the original multivariate distribution with the k𝑘k-th component replaced by the positive part of the decomposition of the univariate marginal p​(xk;𝝃k)𝑝subscript𝑥𝑘subscript𝝃𝑘p(x_{k};\\bm{\\xi}_{k}) w.r.t. ωksubscript𝜔𝑘\\omega_{k}.\nThe negative component pωk−​(𝒙;𝝎)subscriptsuperscript𝑝subscript𝜔𝑘𝒙𝝎p^{-}_{\\omega_{k}}(\\bm{x};\\bm{\\omega}) is built similarly.\nA practical algorithm to sample from pωk+​(𝒙;𝝎)subscriptsuperscript𝑝subscript𝜔𝑘𝒙𝝎p^{+}_{\\omega_{k}}(\\bm{x};\\bm{\\omega}) first samples from the initial multivariate distribution p​(𝒙;𝝎)𝑝𝒙𝝎p(\\bm{x};\\bm{\\omega}) and then replaces the k𝑘k-th component with a sample from the marginal pωk+​(xk;𝝃k)subscriptsuperscript𝑝subscript𝜔𝑘subscript𝑥𝑘subscript𝝃𝑘p^{+}_{\\omega_{k}}(x_{k};\\bm{\\xi}_{k}).\nE.g., for the derivative w.r.t. the mean of the multivariate Gaussian with diagonal covariance, a sample from pωk+​(𝒙;𝝎)superscriptsubscript𝑝subscript𝜔𝑘𝒙𝝎p_{\\omega_{k}}^{+}(\\bm{x};\\bm{\\omega}) includes sampling first from the original multivariate Gaussian and then replacing the k𝑘k-entry with a sample from a Weibull. MVDs are closely related with Finite-difference (FD) methods, as both use perturbations per parameter dimension and take the difference between function evaluations to compute a gradient estimate.\nTo produce an estimator of (4) for each parameter, FD methods construct two distributions by perturbing the distributional parameter ωksubscript𝜔𝑘\\omega_{k} by small amounts ±Δplus-or-minusΔ\\pm\\Delta, and then sample from the resulting modified distributions. Although the bias disappears for Δ→0→Δ0\\Delta\\to 0, the variance grows with 𝒪​(Δ−2)𝒪superscriptΔ2\\mathcal{O}\\!\\left(\\Delta^{-2}\\right), making the estimator unreliable . Instead, MVDs can be seen as a principled way to choose the distributions to sample from.\nNote that the FD is applied to the distributional parameters in (3) and not to the deterministic function f𝑓f, and thus different from computing gradients to optimize f𝑓f only.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: be the estimator of ∇ωk𝔼p​(𝒙;𝝎)​[f​(𝒙)]subscript∇subscript𝜔𝑘subscript𝔼𝑝𝒙𝝎delimited-[]𝑓𝒙\\nabla_{\\omega_{k}}\\mathbb{E}_{p(\\bm{x};\\bm{\\omega})}\\left[f(\\bm{x})\\right], with variance given by [ref]5 which depends on the chosen decomposition and how correlated are the function evaluations at the positive and negative samples.\nA typical choice for variance reduction is to obtain a\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
