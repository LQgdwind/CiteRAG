      "content": "Paper Title: Natural Language Processing Advancements By Deep Learning: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIt was after the success of the neural network in image classification tasks that researchers started to use neural networks in machine translation (NMT).\nAround 2013, research groups started to achieve breakthrough results in NMT.\nUnlike traditional statistical machine translation, NMT is based on an end-to-end neural network . This implies that there is no need for extensive preprocessing and word alignments. Instead, the focus shifted toward network structure. Fig. 11 shows an example of an end-to-end recurrent neural network for machine translation.\nA sequence of input tokens is fed into the network.\nOnce it reaches an end-of-sentence (EOS) token, it starts generating the output sequence.\nThe output sequence is generated in the same recurrent manner as the input sequence until it reaches an end-of-sentence token.\nOne major advantage of this approach is that there is no need to specify the length of the sequence; the network takes it into account automatically.\nIn other words, the end-of-sentence token determines the length of the sequence.\nNetworks implicitly learn that longer input sentences usually lead to longer output sentences with varying length, and that ordering can change.\nFor instance, the second example in Fig. 9 shows that adjectives generally come before nouns in English but after nouns in Spanish.\nThere is no need to explicitly specify this since the network can capture such properties.\nMoreover, the amount of memory that is used by NMT is just a fraction of the memory that is used in traditional statistical machine translation .  was one of the early works that incorporated recurrent neural networks for machine translation. They were able to achieve a perplexity (a measure where lower values indicate better models) that was 43% less than the state-of-the-art alignment based translation models.\nTheir recurrent continuous translation model (RCTM) is able to capture word ordering, syntax, and meaning of the source sentence explicitly.\nIt maps a source sentence into a probability distribution over sentences in the target language. RCTM estimates the probability P​(f|e)𝑃conditional𝑓𝑒P(f|e) of translating a sentence e=e1+…+ek𝑒subscript𝑒1…subscript𝑒𝑘e=e_{1}+...+e_{k} in the source language to target language sentence f=f1+…+fm𝑓subscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑚f=f_{1}+...+f_{m}.\nRCTM estimates P​(f|e)𝑃conditional𝑓𝑒P(f|e) by considering source sentence e𝑒e as well as the preceding words in the target language f1:i−1subscript𝑓:1𝑖1f_{1:i-1}: The representation generated by RCTM acts on n-grams in the lower layers, and acts more on the whole sentence as one moves to the upper layers.\nThis hierarchical representation is performed by applying different layers of convolution.\nFirst a continuous representation of each word is generated; i.e., if the sentence is e=e1​…​ek𝑒subscript𝑒1…subscript𝑒𝑘e=e_{1}...e_{k}, the representation of the word eisubscript𝑒𝑖e_{i} will be v​(ei)∈ℝq×1𝑣subscript𝑒𝑖superscriptℝ𝑞1v(e_{i})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{q\\times 1}.\nThis will result in sentence matrix Ee∈ℝq×ksuperscriptE𝑒superscriptℝ𝑞𝑘\\textbf{E}^{e}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{q\\times{k}} in which E:,ie=v​(ei)superscriptsubscriptE:𝑖𝑒𝑣subscript𝑒𝑖\\textbf{E}_{:,i}^{e}=v(e_{i}).\nThis matrix representation of the sentence will be fed into a series of convolution layers in order to generate the final representation e for the recurrent neural network. The approach is illustrated in Fig. 10.\nEquations for the pipeline are as follows. In order to take into account the sentence length, the authors introduced RCTM II which estimates the length of the target sentence.\nRCTM II was able to achieve better perplexity on WMT datasets (see top portion of Table I) than other existing machine translation systems. In another line of work,  [ref]170 presented an end-to-end sequence learning approach without heavy assumptions on the structure of the sequence.\nTheir approach consists of two LSTMs, one for mapping the input to a vector of fixed dimension and another LSTM for decoding the output sequence from the vector.\nTheir model was able to handle long sentences as well as sentence representations that are sensitive to word order.\nAs shown in Fig. 11, the model reads ”ABC” as an input sequence and produces ”WXYZ” as output sequence.\nThe <E​O​S>expectation𝐸𝑂𝑆<EOS> token indicates the end of prediction.\nThe network was trained by maximizing the log probability of the translation (η𝜂\\eta) given the input sequence (ζ𝜁\\zeta).\nIn other words, the objective function is: 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} is the training set and |𝒟|𝒟|\\mathcal{D}| is its size.\nOne of the novelties of their approach was reversing word order of the source sentence.\nThis helps the LSTM to learn long term dependencies. Having a fixed-length vector in the decoder phase is one of the bottlenecks of the encoder-decoder approach.   argues that a network will have a hard time compressing all the information from the input sentence into a fixed-size vector.\nThey address this by allowing the network to search segments of the source sentence that are useful for predicting the translation.\nInstead of representing the input sentence as a fixed-size vector, in  the input sentence is encoded to a sequence of vectors and a subset of them is chosen by using a method called attention mechanism as shown in Fig. 12. In their approach P​(yi|y1,…,yi−1,X)=g​(yi−1,si,ci)𝑃conditionalsubscript𝑦𝑖subscript𝑦1…subscript𝑦𝑖1𝑋𝑔subscript𝑦𝑖1subscript𝑠𝑖subscript𝑐𝑖P(y_{i}|y_{1},...,y_{i-1},X)=g(y_{i-1},s_{i},c_{i}), in which si=f​(si−1,yi−1,ci)subscript𝑠𝑖𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖1subscript𝑦𝑖1subscript𝑐𝑖s_{i}=f(s_{i-1},y_{i-1},c_{i}).\nWhile previously c𝑐c was the same for all time steps, here c𝑐c takes a different value, cisubscript𝑐𝑖c_{i}, at each time step.\nThis accounts for the attention mechasim (context vector) around that specific time step.\ncisubscript𝑐𝑖c_{i} is computed according to the following: ci=∑j=1Txαi​j​hj,αi​j=e​x​p​(ei​j)∑k=1Txe​x​p​(ei​k),ei​j=a​(si−1,hj)formulae-sequencesubscript𝑐𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑗1subscript𝑇𝑥subscript𝛼𝑖𝑗subscriptℎ𝑗formulae-sequencesubscript𝛼𝑖𝑗𝑒𝑥𝑝subscript𝑒𝑖𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑘1subscript𝑇𝑥𝑒𝑥𝑝subscript𝑒𝑖𝑘subscript𝑒𝑖𝑗𝑎subscript𝑠𝑖1subscriptℎ𝑗c_{i}=\\sum_{j=1}^{T_{x}}\\alpha_{ij}h_{j},\\ \\alpha_{ij}=\\frac{exp(e_{ij})}{{\\sum_{k=1}^{T_{x}}exp(e_{ik})}},\\ e_{ij}=a(s_{i-1},h_{j}). Here a𝑎a is the alignment model that is represented by a feed forward neural network.\nAlso hj=[hjT→,hjT←]subscriptℎ𝑗→superscriptsubscriptℎ𝑗𝑇←superscriptsubscriptℎ𝑗𝑇h_{j}=[\\overset{\\rightarrow}{h_{j}^{T}},\\overset{\\leftarrow}{h_{j}^{T}}], which is a way to include information both about preceding and following words in hjsubscriptℎ𝑗h_{j}.\nThe model was able to outperform the simple encoder-decoder approach regardless of input sentence length. Improved machine translation models continue to emerge, driven in part by the growth in people’s interest and need to understand other languages\nMost of them are variants of the end-to-end decoder-encoder approach. For example,   tries to deal with the problem of rare words.\nTheir LSTM network consists of encoder and decoder layers using residual layers along with the attention mechanism.\nTheir system was able to decrease training time, speed up inference, and handle translation of rare words.\nComparisons between some of the state-of-the-art neural machine translation models are summarized in Table VII. More recently, [ref]177 provides an interesting single-model implementation of massively multilingual NMT. In , authors use BERT to extract contextual embeddings and combine BERT with an attention-based NMT model and provide state-of-the-art results on various benchmark datasets. [ref]179 proposes mBART which is a seq-to-seq denoising autoencoder and reports that using a pretrained, locked (i.e. no modifications) mBART improves performance in terms of the BLEU point.  proposes an interesting adversarial framework for robustifying NMT against noisy inputs and reports performance gains over the Transformer model.  is also an insightful recent work where the authors sample context words from the predicted sequence as well as the ground truth to try to reconcile the training and inference processes. Finally,  is a successful recent effort to prevent the forgetting that often accompanies in translating pre-trained language models to other NMT task.  achieves that aim primarily by using a dynamically gated model and asymptotic distillation.\n\nReference markers found: [170]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]170: length of the target sentence.\nRCTM II was able to achieve better perplexity on WMT datasets (see top portion of Table I) than other existing machine translation systems.
