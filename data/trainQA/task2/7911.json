      "content": "Paper Title: ESBMC v7.6: Enhanced Model Checking of C++ Programs with Clang AST\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nC++ is one of the most popular programming languages used to build high-performance and real-time systems, such as operating systems, banking systems, communication systems, and embedded systems . However, memory safety issues remain a major source of security vulnerabilities in C++ programs . Fan et al.  created a dataset of C/C++ vulnerabilities by mining the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database  and the associated open-source projects on GitHub, then curated the issues based on Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) . According to their findings, two out of the top three vulnerabilities are caused by memory safety issues: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119) and Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125) . The limitation of software testing resides in the user inputs . Only a limited number of execution paths may be tested since test cases involve human inputs in the form of concrete values . In contrast to testing, formal verification techniques can be used more systematically to formally reason about a program, although they suffer from the state-space explosion problem . There is an increasing adoption of formal verification techniques for C programs in the industry, e.g., Amazon has been using model-checking techniques to prove the correctness of their C-based systems in Amazon Web Services (AWS); this has positively impacted their code quality, as evidenced by the increased rate of bugs found and fixed [ref]10. Formal verification of C++ programs is more challenging than C programs due to the sophisticated features, such as the STL (Standard Template Libraries) containers, templates, exception handling, and object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm . The existing state-of-the-art verification tools for C++ programs only have limited feature support . For ESBMC, Ramalho et al.  and Monteiro et al.  initiated the support for C++ program verification. Since then, ESBMC has undergone heavy development to support recent versions of the C++ standard . This research presents a significant improvement to ESBMC’s C++ verification capabilities by introducing a new Clang-based front-end. Particularly, the original contributions of this work are as follows: Complete Redesign: ESBMC’s C++ front-end has undergone a complete restructured and now relies on Clang . By leveraging Clang’s parsing and semantic analysis capabilities  , we check the input program’s Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) using a production-quality compiler. This eliminates static analysis logic and ensures enhanced accuracy and efficiency. Object Models Details: We provide comprehensive insights into the object models used to achieve seamless conversion of C++ polymorphism code to ESBMC’s Intermediate Representation (IR). This improvement allows ESBMC to handle C++ growth and its variants, such as CUDA , widely used in AI applications . Simplified Type Checking for Templates: The new Clang-based front-end greatly simplifies type checking for templates, streamlining ESBMC’s ability to adapt to C++ advancements. Furthermore, this enhancement facilitates the incorporation of C++ variants such as CUDA. Extended C++ Memory Management: We have extended the implementation of the dynamic memory operators new and delete in our new front-end, which enhances ESBMC’s ability to verify memory safety issues. Modeled Rvalue References: Our new Clang-based C++ front-end modeled the key C++11 feature of rvalue references , supported the move function and move semantics. C++ Exception Handling: We have implemented exception handling based on Clang AST and extended the exception specification. Additionally, we optimized the symbolic engine to match thrown exceptions. This enhancement enables ESBMC to support exceptions in C++11 and later versions. Updated C++ Operational Models (OMs): We enabled OMs from ESBMC v2.1, maintained the outdated OMs, to adapt them to the new Clang-C++ front-end. By introducing these features, our work significantly enhances ESBMC’s C++ verification capabilities, paving the way for more robust and efficient verification of C++ programs and their variants. This paper is organized as follows: we begin with a brief introduction to SMT-based BMC techniques and the limitations of previous versions of ESBMC. In Section 3, we present the implementation of core C++ language features based on the Clang AST, along with detailed algorithms. Section 4 provides the experimental results of the benchmarks used and analyzes potential threats to validity. Finally, in Section 5, we conclude and outline future work.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: techniques to prove the correctness of their C-based systems in Amazon Web Services (AWS); this has positively impacted their code quality, as evidenced by the increased rate of bugs found and fixed [ref]10.
