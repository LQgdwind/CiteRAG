      "content": "Paper Title: Toward collision-free trajectory for autonomous and pilot-controlled unmanned aerial vehicles\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLaser/sonar/radar (e.g., , ) and vision-based sensors with lightweight and low-cost cameras (e.g., ) are mainly deployed in CA systems developed using various Machine Learning (ML), AI (e.g., Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) ) techniques. Vision-based navigation with providing abundant online information of the surroundings (e.g., colour, texture, and other visual information) and anti-interference ability proves to be a primary and promising research direction of autonomous navigation with the rapid development of computer vision by means of image processing . A vision-only-based CA approach for UAVs was proposed in  without using distance information. CA systems using distance-limited ranged vision-only based sensors are highly susceptible to harsh weather conditions due to the perception abilities of traditional vision sensors. Additionally, early detection of flights with high speed is difficult using those sensors to be able to determine and react properly in a timely manner. An even bigger problem with these sensors is that it is highly difficult to measure the required accurate distance/depth using cameras alone despite the recent advances in monocular cameras using visual odometry cues, stereo cameras using the parallax principle and RGB-D cameras using infrared sensors. On the other hand, laser/sonar/radar-based systems, with less susceptible to harsh weather conditions and the ability to measure the depth and velocity accurately, are employed to reveal instant SA leading to advanced CA, but with other bottlenecks such as increasing cost and requiring more payload capacity [ref]16. Besides, they are incapable of getting enough information in the complex environment due to their limited field of view and measurement range . The usage of a single sensor in UAV CA systems leads to a couple of deficiencies. To this end, various onboard complementary sensors are employed for reliable three-dimensional (3D) CA using more accurate SA acquired from the fusion of multiple sensors. However, complementary sensor technologies may exacerbate the limited payload capacity and battery life requiring more processing for fusing multiple sensor data. Furthermore, these types of CA techniques, with high computational time, cannot be scaled to hundreds of UAV agents at a time . For UAV avoidance, the geometric guidance algorithms are potentially best suited since they do not need to conduct extensive predictions and analyses without requiring large computational resources on-board [ref]18. In the literature, there have been few works focusing on the area of dynamic obstacle (i.e., moving object) avoidance for CA , in particular, based on UAV geometry formation as discussed in this paper. Jenie et al.  analysed the CA system of UAVs regarding aeroplanes by changing the vehicle velocity vector based on the encounter geometry using the velocity projection. Jenie et al. [ref]18 developed the selective velocity obstacle method (SVO) as an extension of the former velocity obstacle method. Xiuxia et al.  propose a reactive geometric 3D avoidance manoeuvre direction for a UAV to resolve conflicts among the dynamic objects using the collision-cone approach. The CA strategies for multiple UAVs using geometry conflict are investigated in  by expanding the collision-cone approach. Yang et al.  implemented a geometry-based distributed cooperative conflict resolution method to autonomously handle multiple encounters in integrated aerospace. Lindqvist et al.  propose a nonlinear model for predictive control, navigation and obstacle avoidance by predicting future positions. Most of the literature studies rely on onboard sensors to avoid any collision. However, the space for avoidance will be limited by the sensors with the range of detection with the UAV six DoF and a resolution manoeuvre has to be aggressively conducted with the maximum performance of UAVs by comprehending several encounters in the air traffic at once to be able to achieve safe flight as fast as possible . The limited autonomous navigation capability severely hampers the application of UAVs in complex environments . None of the aforementioned near-optimal solutions has been found to overcome the mid-air collision-free autonomous UAV navigation, in particular, they have serious shortcomings in satisfying the MAC avoidance standards which are the main criteria to integrate UAVs into ATM systems concerning safety with UAV BVLOS operations. An effective optimal CA methodology that can be implemented in planning UAV local trajectory regarding collision risks is in high demand where the surrounding dynamic UAV environment is highly unpredictable concerning the very high speed of flights. This leads to high collision risks before taking appropriate action regarding the relative separation from the flight in collision risk and creation of new collision risks with the other flights in the separation manoeuvring direction, while a manoeuvring UAV is unaware of the other close range flights. It is worth noting that as part of the development and evaluation of collision avoidance systems between small and slow drones, the near MAC (NMAC) borders are defined as a cylindrical boundary where the vertical separation is less than 100 ft and the horizontal separation is less than 500 ft . Well-clear for these small and slow drones is defined by the UAS Executive Committee (EXCOM) Science and Research Panel (SARP) as simultaneously lost of horizontal separation of 2000 ft and vertical separation of 250 ft  .\nClose encounters between UAVs and manned aeroplanes are defined as when a MAC is likely within a 30-60 second time window  for a reasonable evasive manoeuvre to avoid a MAC. 1 MAC corresponds to around every 10 NMACs . Regarding these definitions, it would be reasonable to assume that all UAVs, with the current sensor technologies concerning their limitations, are unaware of each other and other manned aeroplanes during mid-air encounters considering the combined speeds of two aircraft (e.g., black circles in Fig.16). In this direction, it can be concluded that UAVs cannot be safely integrated with ATM systems considering these standards and the limitations. Complete and reliable SA about surrounding traffic is a key prerequisite of safe operations in any aerospace . Low-power EC systems (e.g., FLARM, ADS-B ) are already commercially available however, they provide traffic information; whilst minimising the impacts on payload capacity and radio frequency spectrum congestion, they must be integrated with self-separation and CA algorithms to fulfil the functionality of a complete DAA solution . They are harnessed for providing effective traffic surveillance functions (e.g., conflict management by the pilot based on SA, air traffic monitoring, recommending early escape manoeuvrers to manned aeroplanes to avoid conflicts using TCAS, ACAS systems ), particularly for manned aeroplanes. These systems have not been certified as an acceptable means of compliance with UAS DAA requirements where manned aircraft performance assumptions do not apply to UASs , which necessitates the development of new UAS DAA technologies. The proposed mechanism of incorporating EC devices into the operation of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) was tested at an airfield in the UK in 2017 to measure their detection signature in km . NASA Langley Research Center conducted a series of flight tests\nto demonstrate the use of onboard autonomy-enabling technologies in scenarios where a non-conforming UAV flies through the assigned aerospace of another vehicle while trying to reach an emergency landing site ; in these highly restricted flight tests using FLARM EC, a scripted emergency scenario is triggered to make an emergency landing to avoid the collision. To the best of our knowledge, based on the extensive literature survey, this research is the first comprehensive work that integrates fully autonomous UAVs with EC devices enabling an effective CM mechanism that leads to safe autonomous BVLOS operations by taking the remote operators out of the loop not only within UTM systems, but also within the integrated aerospace of UTM and ATM systems where the chance of a drone colliding with an aircraft has increased substantially as acknowledged by authorities (e.g., ). And again, to the best of our knowledge, EC, with an intelligent CM system, has been tested by incorporating UAVs and manned aircraft into the same aerospace for the first time to address mid-air collision. This paper contributes to the literature by proposing a novel 3D dynamic CM methodology, which has several advantages over other methods by handling multiple collision risks with no sophisticated sensors and no prior training. The PilotAware system is unique in the fact that it is capable of detecting more UAVs/aircraft types than any other system currently available on the market (detailed in Section III-A) which is a considerable benefit for the proposed CA methodology in this paper. With the rich set of data available, the developed DACM system is capable of performing exceptionally well at solving the challenge of DAA by considering the highest proportion of monitored flights to inform its data-driven decision-making capabilities. More specifically, collision risk assessment and modelling of CA for air vehicles are investigated in this study.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: ability to measure the depth and velocity accurately, are employed to reveal instant SA leading to advanced CA, but with other bottlenecks such as increasing cost and requiring more payload capacity [ref]16.
