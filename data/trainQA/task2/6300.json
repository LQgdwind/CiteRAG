The first step is to identify the scope and objectives. In most cases, researchers develop a schema   or use existing schemas     to serve as the formal and explicit specification of a domain, thus ensuring consistent, coherent, and aligned domain knowledge. Unlike the general domain KG, utilizing schemas is a common practice in HKG construction. Secondly, researchers gather data from various sources, including medical literature, clinical trials, and patient-generated data. It is essential to ensure the quality and consistency of the data and to remove identifiable information for patient privacy. The third step is to extract and transform the data into a structured format. This step involves identifying medical entities and creating relationships between them via specialized biomedical Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools   .\n Next, researchers map the entities and relationships to the chosen ontologies with the help of thesauruses  or terminologies  . This step ensures that the knowledge graph is interoperable with other healthcare systems and facilitates data integration. Until now, an initial KG has been built. The next step is to populate the KG to infer missing links between entities. This inference can be done using graph databases  or link prediction models  . The final step is to continuously update and validate the KG to ensure accuracy and relevance. This step involves incorporating new data and knowledge, refining the schema, and evaluating the quality of the KG. Constructing HKGs by Integration.\nConsidering significant efforts have been paid to construct and curate HKGs from scratch, it is promising to integrate these data resources to avoid repetitive work. Healthcare KG integration (also called Healthcare KG fusion) refers to the processing of merging two or more HKGs into a single, more comprehensive graph   . The integration process is challenging because different HKGs may use different terminologies, schemas, or data formats. To address these challenges, researchers have developed various techniques and algorithms for knowledge graph fusion, including ontology matching  , schema alignment  , entity resolution  , and conflicts resolution . These methods aim to identify and reconcile the differences between KGs. Techniques for HKG Constructions.\nTraditionally, each step of HKG construction involves one specially designated model. For instance, Hidden Markov Models and Recurrent Neural Networks are widely used for healthcare named entity recognition, relation extraction, and other sequence tagging tasks, while Translational Models and Graph Neural Networks are used for HKG completion and conflicts resolution tasks.\nRecently, large language models (LLMs) have shown great utility to serve as a uniform tool for constructing KGs . Several key steps of constructing KGs, such as named entity recognition [ref]54   , relation extraction [ref]58  , entity linking   , and KG completion [geng2022disentangled, 64, 65, 66], have been successfully tackled by these large foundation models.\nEarly explorations of construction HKG with large foundation models show that healthcare entity normalization  [ref]68, healthcare entity recognition  , healthcare entity linking , and healthcare knowledge fusion  can also be performed, without extensive training on expensive healthcare annotated corpus.\nOn the other hand, researchers start to construct KGs under the open-world assumption     , thus getting rid of the dependency on pre-defined schemas and exhaustive entity&relation normalization. Although open-world KGs greatly increase the coverage, ensuring the quality of extracted knowledge is still an open research challenge, especially for explainable and trustworthy HKGs.\n\nReference markers found: [54]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]54: tasks.\nRecently, large language models (LLMs) have shown great utility to serve as a uniform tool for constructing KGs .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
