      "content": "Paper Title: Looking at Euler flows through a contact mirror: Universality and undecidability\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBack in 1936 Turing faced a fundamental question which had been driving the attention of many mathematicians since the 1920’s: Is there an answer for the decision problem for first-order logics?. A decision problem can be posed as a yes/no question depending on the input values. Decidability is the problem of the existence of an effective method, a test or automatic procedure to know whether certain premises entail certain conclusions. The halting problem is one of the first decision problems which was proved to be undecidable. Indeed, Alan Turing proved that a general algorithm that solves the halting problem cannot exist (for all possible program-input pairs). In doing so, he, fortuitously, invented the basic model of modern digital computers, the so-called Turing machine. The undecidability of the halting problem yields a cascade of related questions: What kind of physics might be non-computational? (Penrose )\nIs hydrodynamics capable of performing computations? (Moore ). Given the Hamiltonian of a quantum many-body system, does there exist an algorithm to check whether it has a spectral gap? (this is known as the spectral gap problem, recently proved to be undecidable ). And last but not least, can a mechanical system (including a fluid flow) simulate a universal Turing machine? (Tao   ). Surprisingly, this last question is connected with the regularity of the Navier-Stokes equations , one of the unsolved problems in the Clay’s list of problems for the Millennium . In  Tao speculated on a relation between a potential blow-up of the Navier-Stokes equations, Turing completeness and fluid computation. This is part of a more general programme he launched in    to address the global existence problem for Euler and Navier-Stokes based on the concept of universality. Inspired by this proposal, in [ref]7 we showed that the stationary Euler equations exhibit several universality features, in the sense that, any non-autonomous flow on a compact manifold can be extended to a smooth stationary solution of the Euler equations on a Riemannian manifold of possibly higher dimension. As a corollary, we established the Turing completeness of the steady Euler flows on a 171717-dimensional sphere [ref]7. It is then natural to ask: can this dimensional bound be improved? We solved this problem affirmatively in  constructing stationary solutions of the Euler equations on a Riemannian 3-dimensional sphere that can simulate any Turing machine (i.e., they are Turing complete). In particular, these solutions exhibit undecidable paths in the sense that there are constructible points for which it is not possible to decide whether their associated trajectories will intersect a certain (explicit) open set or not. The type of flows that we considered are Beltrami fields, a particularly relevant class of stationary solutions. Our game plan combines the computational power of symbolic dynamics with techniques from contact topology. Contact topology enters into the scene because Beltrami fields correspond to Reeb flows under a contact mirror unveiled by Sullivan, Etnyre and Ghrist more than two decades ago.\nThe contact mirror thus reflects a problem in Fluid Dynamics as a problem in contact geometry and back. The existence of Turing complete Euler flows gives rise to new questions concerning undecidability of different dynamical properties. One of the potential problems to consider is that of periodic orbits: Ever, at least since the work of Poincaré , periodic orbits are known to be one of the major tools to understand the dynamics of Hamiltonian systems. Even though, not every Hamiltonian system admits periodic orbits, the\nWeinstein conjecture asserts that under some topological (compact) and geometrical (contact) conditions on the manifold, Reeb vector fields admit at least one periodic orbit. The Weinstein conjecture is known to be true in dimension 3, so using our contact mirror we can conclude that the Turing complete Reeb flow we constructed in  has at least one periodic orbit (in fact, in our construction the Reeb vector field coincides with a Hopf field in the complement of a certain solid torus, so it has infinitely many periodic orbits). It is then natural to ask if for every point of the sphere it is possible to decide whether its corresponding orbit will be closed or not. We shall see in this article that such a decision problem has no answer. The undecidability of other dynamical properties of Reeb flows will be also discussed. In view of Gödel’s incompleteness theorems, undecidability of such properties of dynamical systems seems to be an unsurmountable obstacle no matter what systems of axioms are considered. Our goal in this article is to give an overview of this exciting area of research. Let us summarize the contents of this work. Next, in this Introduction, we present the Euler equations and the Beltrami fields on Riemannian manifolds, in Section 1.1, and the connection between contact geometry and hydrodynamics (in particular, between Beltrami fields and Reeb flows), in Section 1.2. In Section 2, following [ref]7, we introduce the theory of Reeb embeddings and their flexibility (in the form of a new hℎh-principle), and apply it to prove several universality features of the stationary Euler flows in high dimensions. The construction of a Turing complete Reeb field on a 333-dimensional sphere  is presented in Section 3; as a novel feature, we show how variations of this result allow us to prove the existence of Reeb fields exhibiting different undecidable dynamical properties, including periodic orbits. Finally, in Section 4 we recall the main theorem of  establishing the existence of Turing complete time-dependent solutions to the Euler equations (on compact Riemannian manifolds of very high dimension), and discuss the implications of our results regarding computability with the Navier-Stokes equations.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: This is part of a more general programme he launched in    to address the global existence problem for Euler and Navier-Stokes based on the concept of universality.
