      "content": "Paper Title: 6GAN: IPv6 Multi-Pattern Target Generation via Generative Adversarial Nets with Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe exploration of the global IPv6 address space  could enhance the ability of researchers to conduct wide-ranging assessments of the next-generation Internet. Except for the particular case [ref]2, the concrete instantiation of prior exploration work mainly includes passive measurement    and active scanning   [ref]8  0. Because the former approach is limited by vantage points to monitor the traffic, fast IPv6 scanning has become a critical means required by the community. However, IPv6 active hosts distribute in an extensive address space. A brute-force scanning approach 1 with current network speed and computational power will expanse considerable time, rendering exhaustive probing completely infeasible. The recently proposed target generation algorithms 2 3 4 5 6 7 seem the state-of-the-art breakthrough to overcome the problem. Algorithms are required to learn features of the seed set and predict the active individuals or regions in the real network space to provide the candidate set waiting for scanning. The algorithmic design becomes essential to guarantee the quality of the candidate set. While prior work has developed sophisticated techniques, IPv6 Internet nature begets these algorithms still facing challenges: (1) IPv6 addressing pattern. Network administrators are allowed to freely select IPv6 address configuration schemes 8, which enables multiple allocation pattern for interface identifier (IID) in the address. Clients may use Stateless Address Autoconfiguration and thus produce pseudorandom 9 or EUI-64 IIDs , while servers and routers are usually assigned according to administrator customs or employing DHCPv6 . The algorithmic inference will be stuck in trouble as these patterns are required to be opaque according to RFC 7136 . (2) IPv6 aliasing. Prior experience 4 has proposed that the large-scale aliased regions are the challenge that must be resolved in future IPv6 scanning because these addresses unconditionally respond to queries and seem not bound to unique devices. While the related alias detection work [ref]8 5 has gradually matured, these approaches are all scanning strategies for generating candidate sets or regions rather than algorithmic optimization. Therefore, the algorithm is still deceived to learn the aliased regions and consume a large budget to generate low-quality candidate sets. To address these problems, we raise a novel consideration to help push the candidate set from quantity to quality. Firstly, with the application of unsupervised learning to address sequences [ref]8 7, addressing patterns could be clustered into limited categories. We followed the idea to perform a deeper analysis under each pattern rather than the entire seed set to avoid multiple pattern interference. Secondly, in the field of natural language processing, the policy gradient of reinforcement learning   helps Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs)  solve the non-differentiable problem of the discrete text. The generator is guided by the discriminator rewards and keeps improving with sampling policy just like an agent. We leverage this design to generate address sequences and increase a new reward mechanism with more intelligence to discourage aliased address generation. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning architecture 6GAN to replace traditional target generation algorithms. 6GAN uses multiple generators to learn IPv6 addressing patterns determined by known seed classification methods. These generators employ policy gradient  and Monte Carlo search  for the address sequence decision-making process, which is motivated by two environmental rewards. One reward comes from a multi-class discriminatorâ€™s estimation of whether the generated address conforms to the real pattern address, the other reward is the evaluation of the aliased prefix detection to judge whether to update the address prefix. The approach contributes to uncovering active targets under multiple addressing patterns and avoiding learning from aliased addresses. Contributions. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We propose a novel architecture 6GAN to generate diversified non-aliased active addresses of different addressing pattern types through using multiple generators guided by rewards from a discriminator and an alias detector. We employ a multi-class objective of 6GANâ€™s discriminator, which can identify IPv6 addressing pattern categories. We implement an alias detection approach embedded in the algorithm by optimizing the generator, which saves algorithmic budget to generate high-quality candidates. We push the quality of candidate sets to a higher level. Experiments show that 6GAN outperforms state-of-the-art target generation algorithms on multiple metrics. Roadmap. Section II summarizes the prior researches related to our work. Section III introduces the basic knowledge about IPv6 target generation. Section IV highlights the overall design of 6GAN. Section V shows the evaluation results and Section VI concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: The exploration of the global IPv6 address space  could enhance the ability of researchers to conduct wide-ranging assessments of the next-generation Internet.
