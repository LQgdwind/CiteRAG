In this work, we address the challenge of reducing the domain gaps for 3D point cloud data, which alleviates the need for extensive annotation across all domains.\nSpecifically, we focus on unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), that involves transferring knowledge from a label-rich domain, i.e., source domain to a label-scarce domain, i.e., target domain to reduce the discrepancy between source and target data distributions, typically by exploiting the domain-invariant features¬†   .\nUnfortunately, most of the existing literature on UDA primarily focuses on 2D data.  The mortality risk and associated costs of conducting real-world experiments for autonomous driving and robotics systems have led to the increasing prevalence of synthetic data, particularly 3D data, in the research community¬†.\nThis necessitates the need to develop effective domain adaptation methods for 3D data across different domains, including real-to-sim or sim-to-real adaptation, to ensure successful deployment in real-world scenarios. There are numerous works addressing the single-target domain adaptation (STDA) for 3D point clouds¬†[ref]36  .\nHowever, when 3D point cloud data of objects is collected under different environmental conditions using various depth cameras or LIDAR sensors for autonomous driving cars, it results in differences in statistical properties such as point cloud density, noise, and orientation.\nAs a result, there is a pressing need for developing Multi-target Domain Adaptation (MTDA) methods, specifically for 3D point cloud data.\nDespite the well-studied 2D data regime¬†3  , MTDA in 3D point cloud domain remains an unexplored area in the literature. In the context of both STDA and MTDA, if the category configurations are identical across all domains, one straightforward solution could be to extend STDA to MTDA by using one model per target domain.\nHowever, at inference time, it becomes challenging to determine the appropriate model to use when information about the target domain is not available.\nMoreover, as the number of target domains increases, the computational complexity increases accordingly.\nAdditionally, the model may experience catastrophic forgetting¬†  , that involves a neural network trained on a particular task forgetting the previously learned information when trained on a new task.\nAs a result, the network‚Äôs performance on the initial task deteriorates.\nThis can be a significant challenge when adapting models to multiple target domains, as the model must be able to generalize well across all domains without forgetting the previously learned information.\nTherefore, we argue that it is preferable to have a single model that can adapt to multiple targets.\nHence, we propose to learn a single MTDA model for 3D point cloud.\nWe illustrate the differences between STDA and MTDA in Figure¬†1. To learn a single MTDA model, we first model the multiple NùëÅN targets as a random variable.\nWe then generate shared information between source and NùëÅN target domains as NùëÅN realizations of the shared representations by mixing them.\nThen, we propose to take an ensemble average of the shared (i.e., mixed) representation for training a model that is invariant to multiple domains, calling it Mixup Ensemble Average or MEnsA.\nThe shared representations are learned in a latent space for its low domain gaps¬† in a min-max manner; maximizing the mutual information (MI) in the embedding space between the domains and domain-specific information while minimizing the MI between the domains and the domain-invariant information¬†3.\nWe show that our proposed method outperforms several STDA and MTDA approaches proposed for both 2D and 3D regimes on the multiple target domains evaluated on challenging PointDA-10 benchmark dataset¬†[ref]36 by large margins.\nIn summary, we present the following contributions: We show that a straightforward extension of domain adaptation methods designed for STDA, in particular 2D data, is non-trivial and does not transfer well to MTDA, specifically in the case of 3D data. We propose a simple and novel ensemble-average based mixup approach, named MEnsA, to address the challenging yet unaddressed task of adapting a single model across multiple target domains by learning on a single source domain, on point cloud data. Extensive validations on PointDA-10 dataset demonstrates a significant benefit of our simple approach over previous unsupervised STDA and MTDA methods by large margins (up to 17.10% and 4.76% on averaged over all domain shifts). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that benchmarks and addresses the task of MTDA on 3D data, specifically 3D point clouds.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: from a surveillance system to self-driving cars, deep learning (DL) for 3D data has made significant progress in a wide variety of tasks including classification, segmentation, and detection¬† 6 [ref]33  .\nDespite the impressive success of DL on 2D vision tasks, its success in 3D data regime involving point cloud data is yet limited by several factors as follows.\nFirst, as the point clouds\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
