      "content": "Paper Title: A Memory-Augmented Multi-Task Collaborative Framework for Unsupervised Traffic Accident Detection in Driving Videos\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTraditional traffic accident detection methods   mainly extract handcrafted features and classify them using a Bayesian model. Among them, Yuan et al.  measured the abnormality of motion orientation and magnitude and fused the measurements using a Bayesian model to obtain a detection result. However, these methods are computationally complex, sensitive to handcrafted features, and lack robustness when applied to various traffic accidents. With the advances in deep learning in computer vision, deep-learning-based traffic accident detection [ref]6  [ref]12  [ref]8  has attracted the attention of researchers. Existing TAD methods mainly detect traffic accidents in an unsupervised manner through a single pretext task, i.e., appearance-based or future-object-localization-based TAD methods. Among them, appearance-based approaches [ref]6  focus on detecting the difference between the predicted or reconstructed frame and the natural frame. For instance, Liu et al. [ref]6 introduced appearance and motion constraints to facilitate the prediction of future frames for normal events and thus help identify anomalous events that do not conform to expectations. Another part of the works  [ref]12 applied future object localization to detect abnormal events. For instance, Yao et al. [ref]12 predict the future locations of objects over a short horizon in a driving scenario and then monitor prediction accuracy and consistency metrics as evidence of anomalies. Though previous single-pretext-task-based methods have achieved promising performance, these approaches still have inherent limitations, e.g., appearance-based methods are prone to greatly reduce performance due to the rapid movement of dashboard-mounted cameras, while methods based on future object localization may fail to capture changes in appearance, which may lead to failure to detect ego-involved accidents. Recently, Fang et al.  attempted to collaborate frame prediction and future object localization tasks to absorb the merits of them. They proposed the SSC-TAD framework to detect traffic accidents by analyzing the inconsistency of video frames, object locations, and scene spatial relationship structures between different frames of driving videos. Different from SSC-TAD, our framework collaborates on the tasks of optical flow reconstruction and future object localization. The proposed MAMR mechanism not only fully explores the inherent interrelation between different types of motion representations but is also more sensitive to abnormal patterns. Besides, some researchers have recently proposed supervised methods [ref]8  for TAD in driving videos. For instance, Zhou et al. [ref]8 proposed a coarse-to-fine supervised TAD method based on spatio-temporal feature encoding with a multi-layer neural network. Sun et al.  proposed a traffic anomaly detection method based on cross-domain few-shot learning.\nHowever, since driving events follow a long-tailed distribution, it may not be possible to collect all types of traffic accidents. This may increase the risk of the supervised TAD approach to cope with unknown events. Therefore, in our work, we focus on exploring an unsupervised TAD approach to avoid collecting all types of traffic incidents as training data.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: to handcrafted features, and lack robustness when applied to various traffic accidents.
