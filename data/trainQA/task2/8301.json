      "content": "Paper Title: Guidelines for Submission to HPCA 2025\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo improve ORAM performance, many prior works    propose to eliminate ORAM requests.\nFor example, PrORAM and its variants    use PathORAM , a prior state-of-the-art protocol, as their baseline.\nPathORAM manages the ORAM tree similarly to RingORAM, with a key distinction being that in PathORAM, a node does not differentiate between real or dummy blocks.\nEach LLC miss on PA in PathORAM results in loading all blocks along the nodes connecting from its mapped leaf to the root.\nAdditionally, upon loading from a leaf, PathORAM evicts the same leaf path immediately.\nThe PrORAM protocol  forces the mapping of consecutive physical addresses in the original memory space to the same leaf in the ORAM tree.\nThis way, one load of a physical address effectively prefetches multiple data blocks from the ORAM tree to Stash and then to LLC.\nSubsequent accesses, if hit the LLC, bypass the ORAM protocol.\nThis solution achieves a notable speedup by mitigating the ORAM workload when the original memory access exhibits high locality.\n However, PrORAM optimization suffers from two limitations, which we discuss through qualitative and quantitative analyses as follows.\nFirst, the prefetch performance benefit is sensitive to the locality pattern.\nThis optimization has little effect on workloads with low to moderate locality in their original LLC miss trace such as some SPEC benchmarks, real-world graph analytics, and random key-value accesses, with demonstrated in performance evaluation in §VIII-A.\nSecond, forcing the mapping of consecutive physical addresses in the original memory space to the same leaf in the ORAM tree limits the scope that Stash can distribute its blocks back to the ORAM tree.\nThis violates the premise in PathORAM proof that blocks are assigned “independently and uniformly at random” into leaves of the ORAM binary tree .\nAs a result, background eviction is introduced when Stash overflows in this scenario . Whenever the Stash size exceeds the threshold, a dummy ORAM request is inserted to read from and write to a random dummy path.\nThis path access does not contribute to fulfilling any LLC requests but only helps to further clear the Stash.\nFig. 4 shows the quantitative results of how these dummy requests affect performance.\nThe experiment models PrORAM with a 1024-entry Stash protecting stm, a synthetic workload where consecutive cache line addresses are missed subsequently by the LLC.\nIdeally, a higher prefetch length configured in PrORAM should perform better than a lower one because the perfect locality of the trace can eliminate more of the ORAM requests.\nHowever, we find that PrORAM performance does not scale with the prefetch length. At a prefetch length of 4, although the original ORAM leaf accesses are reduced by 4×\\times, the Stash pressure has to repeatedly insert dummy requests, and the fraction of dummy requests accounts for 77.3% of the total ORAM requests.\nThis leads to even a slowdown compared to the no prefetch case.\nPrORAM proposes to use a threshold to adapt to the background eviction frequency and dynamically disable or limit the prefetch length.\nThis achieves up to 1.5×\\times speedup over the no prefetch case (see Fig. 7 in PrORAM ). LAORAM proposes a Fat-Tree structure to allocate 2×\\times block size at the root level and gradually decrease the bucket size going up towards the leaf .\nThis significantly reduces the Stash pressure and decreases the dummy request ratio.\nHowever, its performance is capped at 3.2×\\times at a prefetch length of 4 even with perfect locality in stm.\nNote that LAORAM reports a few over 3.2×\\times speedups in some workloads.\nThis is because LAORAM uses a software-managed Stash and allows the Stash to grow above 3600 after 12500 ORAM accesses and remain unbounded throughout the workload lifetime (see Fig. 8 in LAORAM ).\nThis reduces the dummy request ratio observed in LAORAM.\nHowever, because all entries in Stash need to be probed on every ORAM access, a high-performance on-chip ORAM solution requires Stash to be in hardware and remain small due to the need for area efficiency and probing with high associativity [ref]30.\nSuch an unbounded Stash cannot be justified in a high-performance on-chip hardware solution.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: to be probed on every ORAM access, a high-performance on-chip ORAM solution requires Stash to be in hardware and remain small due to the need for area efficiency and probing with high associativity [ref]30.\nSuch an unbounded Stash cannot be justified in a high-performance on-chip hardware solution.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
