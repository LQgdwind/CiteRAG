      "content": "Paper Title: Temporal Graph Benchmark for Machine Learning on Temporal Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, there is an increasing interest in developing graph representation learning models for networks that evolve over times.\nEvolving graphs can be investigated at different time granularity.\n\nKazemi et al.¬† categorize temporal graphs into Discrete Time Dynamic Graphs¬†(DTDGs) and Continous Time Dynamic Graphs¬†(CTDGs).\nDTDGs consist of an ordered set of static graph snapshots while CTDGs compose of timestamped edge streams where edges are denoted by triplets of source, destination, and timestamp.\nDTDG models specialize in sequences of graph snapshots capturing the dynamics of a temporal graph where these snapshots are sampled at regular time intervals¬†    .\nIn contrast, CTDG methods often aggregating the features from temporal neighborhood (connected nodes with close time proximity) and constantly adjusting the encoding as edge stream continues¬† [ref]46 .\nIn this work, we primarily focus on CTDGs, driven by several compelling reasons.\nFirst, CTDG models which employs the precise temporal information offered by CTDGs, can be effectively utilized for DTDGs.\nOn the contrary, adapting DTDG models for drawing inferences from CTDGs is a non-trivial task.\nSecond, it has been shown that DTDGs are convertible to CTDGs , while the conversion in the opposite direction results in loss of information.\nNext, we introduce the methods used in our evaluation for the dynamic link property prediction and dynamic node property prediction task.\n Models Used for Evaluation of Dynamic Link Property Prediction Task. DyRep¬†[ref]42 is a temporal point process-based model that propagates interaction messages via Recurrent Neural Networks¬†(RNNs) to update the node representations. It employs a temporal attention mechanism to model the weights of a given node‚Äôs neighbors. TGN¬† is a general framework for learning on continuous time dynamic graphs. It has the following components: memory module, message function, message aggregator, memory updater, and embedding module. TGN updates the node memories at test time with newly observed edges. GraphMixer¬† is a simple model for dynamic link prediction consisting of three main modules: a node-encoder to summarize the node information, a link-encoder to summarize the temporal link information, and a link predictor module. These modules that only employ based on multi-layer perceptrons¬†(MLPs), making GraphMixer a simple model without the use of a GNN architecture. TCL¬† employs a transfomer module to generate temporal neighborhood representations for nodes involved in an interaction.\nIt then models the inter-dependencies with a co-attentional transfomer at a semantic level. Specifically, TCL utilizes two separate encoders to extract representations from temporal neighborhoods surrounding the two nodes of an edge. CAWN¬†[ref]46 predicts dynamic links based on extracting temporal random walks and retrieves temporal network motifs to represent network dynamics. It utilizes a neural network model to encode Causal Anonymous Walks¬†(CAWs) to support online training and inference.\nParticularly, it starts by relabeling nodes with encoded temporal anonymous walks starting at the nodes involved in an interaction.\nThen, the temporal walks themselves are further encoded using the generated node labels and encodings of the elapsed times.\nFinally, the existence of a link is predicted based on aggregating the walks encoding through a pooling module. TGAT¬† captures both temporal and structural characteristics of dynamic graphs using a self-attention mechanism.\nAt a specific timestamp tùë°t, TGAT first concatenates the raw features of a node with a trainable encoding of time tùë°t.\nUpon the observation of an interaction among a pair of nodes, TGAT utilizes the self-attention mechanism to apply message passing to the time augmented node features and generates the latest node representations. NAT¬† adopts a novel dictionary-type neighborhood representation for nodes. Such representation records a downsampled set of node neighbors as keys and constructs features for joint neighborhood of multiple nodes. A dedicated data structure called N-cache supports GPU acceleration for the dictionary representations. EdgeBank‚àûsubscriptEdgeBank\\text{\\emph{EdgeBank}}_{\\infty}¬†[ref]33 is a simple heuristic storing all observed edges in a memory (implemented as a hashtable).\nAt inference time, if the queried node pair is in the memory then EdgeBank‚àûsubscriptEdgeBank\\text{EdgeBank}_{\\infty} predicts true, otherwise EdgeBank‚àûsubscriptEdgeBank\\text{EdgeBank}_{\\infty} predicts false. EdgeBanktwsubscriptEdgeBanktw\\text{\\emph{EdgeBank}}_{\\text{tw}}¬†[ref]33 is another variation of EdgeBank which only memorizes edges from a fixed duration in the recent past. Therefore, it has a strong recency bias. Models Used for Evaluation of Dynamic Node Property Prediction Task. TGN¬† is discussed above. We utilize the TGN embedding of a node from the memory at the query time tùë°t to predict the node labels. DyRep¬†[ref]42 same as discussed above. We use the node embedding to predict the node labels. Persistant Forecast¬† is a simple yet powerful baseline for time series forecasting and complex systems. Here, we extend the core idea by simply outputting the recently observed node label for the current time tùë°t. Moving Average¬† considers the average of the node labels observed in the previous kùëòk steps (we set k=7ùëò7k=7).\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: .\nIn contrast, CTDG methods often aggregating the features from temporal neighborhood (connected nodes with close time proximity) and constantly adjusting the encoding as edge stream continues¬† [ref]46 .\nIn this work, we primarily focus on CTDGs, driven by several compelling reasons.\nFirst, CTDG models which employs the precise temporal information offered by CTDGs, can be effectively\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
