      "content": "Paper Title: Attention Meets Perturbations: Robust and Interpretable Attention with Adversarial Training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAT    is a powerful regularization technique that has been primarily explored in the field of image recognition to improve the robustness of models for input perturbations.\nIn the NLP field, AT has been applied to various tasks by extending the concept of adversarial perturbations, e.g., text classification [ref]18 , part-of-speech tagging [ref]20, and machine reading comprehension [ref]21 .\nAs mentioned earlier, these techniques apply AT for word embedding.\nOther AT-based techniques for the NLP tasks include those related to parameter updating  and generative adversarial network (GAN)-based retrieval-enhancement method .\nOur proposal is an adversarial training technique for attention mechanisms and is different from these methods. Miyato et al. [ref]18 proposed Word AT, a technique that applied AT to the word embeddings.\nThe adversarial perturbations are generated according to the back-propagation gradients.\nThese perturbations are expected to regularize the model.\nSince then, Sato et al.  proposed Word iAT, and it has been known to achieve almost the same performance as Word AT that does not expect interpretability .\nThe Word iAT technique aims to increase the model’s interpretability by determining the perturbation’s direction so that it is closer to other word embeddings in the vocabulary.\nBoth reports demonstrated improved task performance via AT.\nHowever, the specific effect of AT on attention mechanisms has yet to be investigated.\nIn this paper, we aim to address this issue by providing analyses of the effects of AT for attention mechanisms using various NLP tasks. AT is considered to be related to other regularization techniques (e.g., dropout , batch normalization ).\nSpecifically, dropout can be considered a kind of noise addition.\nWord dropout  and character dropout , known as wildcard training, are variants for NLP tasks.\nThese techniques can be considered random noise for the target task.\nIn contrast, AT has been demonstrated to be effective because it creates particularly vulnerable perturbations that the model is trained to overcome . It has been reported that DNN models that introduce adversarial training to overcome adversarial perturbations capture human-like features   .\nThese features help to make the prediction of DNN models easier to interpret for humans.\nIn this paper, we demonstrate that the proposed AT to attention mechanisms provides cleaner attention that is more easily interpreted by humans.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: to improve the robustness of models for input perturbations.\nIn the NLP field, AT has been applied to various tasks by extending the concept of adversarial perturbations, e.g., text classification [ref]18 , part-of-speech tagging [ref]20, and machine reading comprehension [ref]21 .\nAs mentioned earlier, these techniques apply AT for word embedding.\nOther AT-based techniques for the NLP tasks\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
