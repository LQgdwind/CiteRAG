However, this approach is limited to two-agent scenarios in [ref]30 .\nDVM [ref]18 and LTCR  transfer knowledge among multiple agents through policy distillation, but serve in a coarse-grained manner since the two-stage training. MAPTF  models the policy transfer among multiple agents as the option learning problem, which can adaptively select a suitable policy for each agent to exploit.\nHowever, these methods usually require complex modeling and are sensitive to hyperparameters, and most works lack theoretical guarantees.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: of policy transfer methods is to select an appropriate source policy based on the performance of the source policy on the target task and guide the agent to explore during the learning process  [ref]17.\nCAPS is proposed in [ref]17, which requires the optimality of source policies since it only learns an intra-option policy over these source policies.\n selects a suitable source policy during\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
