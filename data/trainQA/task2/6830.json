However, due to a cubic increase in memory usage and computational cost with rising resolution, these methods produce only coarse, low-resolution textures. For meshes, recent work in texture generation  predicts the color for each face, but the representation capacity remains largely constrained by the mesh’s resolution. Another set of works     leverage UV mapping, but they require either spherical parameterization or part segmentation and, therefore, are confined to handling low-genus shapes. Other works   rely on image exemplars, while our approach focuses on unconditional generation. Recently, implicit functions attract increasing attention for generative tasks  [ref]36 [ref]44 [ref]3    . Most of this research centers on generating 3D-aware images [ref]44 [ref]3  , rather than synthesizing textures for given 3D meshes. Texture Fields  represents the most similar work to our task, which, however, tends to produce over-smoothed results. Some methods focus on test-time optimization\nfor generation tasks. For instance, Text2Mesh \nemploys CLIP  to design\na loss function. This function stylizes a 3D\nmesh to align with a target text prompt,\npredicting both the color and displacement\nfor each mesh vertex. More recently, DreamFusion [ref]36 and Magic3D  leverage pre-trained stable diffusion  for score distillation, creating either NeRF \nor a 3D mesh. However, these approaches\noften demand extensive optimization time\nor necessitate alterations to the existing\nmesh geometry . In this paper,\nour objective is to generate textures for specified\nfull-3D meshes with arbitrary topology. This goal\nentails two fundamental requirements: 1) preserving\nthe original mesh’s geometric structure; 2) producing\na 3D texture representation exportable as\neither vertex color or a uv-texture-image,\ninstead of merely generating/rendering multi-view\nor 3D-aware images.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: low-genus shapes.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
