      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Learning-Based Detection for Marker Codes over Insertion and Deletion Channels\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe black-box approaches for channel detection/decoding problems illustrated above are purely data-driven and model-agnostic. They typically require a large amount of data and computing resources. Instead, the model-based deep learning methods combine the existing mathematical algorithms designed for channel detection/decoding and deep learning. They always need a few parameters and can be learned from a limited amount of data and computing resources. According to [ref]32, the model-based approaches for channel detection/decoding can be classified into two categories: model-aided networks via deep unfolding and structure-oriented deep neural network (DNN) aided inference. Deep unfolding: Deep unfolding is a common method for obtaining deep learning architectures from model-based iterative algorithms [ref]39. In particular, it converts an iterative algorithm into a DNN by designing each layer to resemble a single iteration. In , the authors proposed a detection network (DetNet) specifically designed for MIMO detection. DetNet is constructed by deep unfolding the iterations of a projected gradient descent algorithm into a DNN. Simulation results show that the method can achieve near optimal detection performance with low computational complexity. In [ref]40, the authors proposed a neural belief propagation (BP) decoder for linear codes by deep unfolding the iterative BP decoding algorithm into a deep neural network. The neural BP decoder assigns weights to the edges in the Tanner graph and these weights are trained using stochastic gradient descent. By tying the weights of each edges in the Tanner graph at each iteration, the feed-forward architecture of neural BP decoder is transferred into an RNN architecture which is termed BP-RNN. The design of neural BP and BP-RNN are also extended to neural min-sum (MS) decoding in [ref]40.  Subsequently, the neural BP decoder is improved by hyper-graph network  and active learning . In , the authors proposed a high-performance neural MS decoding for protograph LDPC codes by fully utilizing the lifting structure of the codes. Structure-oriented methods:  By replacing the channel-dependent part of the detection algorithms with DNNs, structure-oriented DNN-aided methods use deep learning to enhance the robustness of the existing channel detection algorithms. There are a number of structure-oriented detection methods for various communication channels. In , the authors proposed a deep learning-based sphere decoding for MIMO detection, where the radius of the decoding hypersphere is learned by a three-layer DNN prior to decoding. Simulation results show that the performance of the method is close to the optimal maximum likelihood decoding with significantly reduced computational complexity. For finite memory channels such as Poisson channel and ISI channel with AWGN, the authors in  proposed a data-driven symbol detector, called ViterbiNet, that does not require CSI. ViterbiNet is designed by replacing the channel-dependent part of Viterbi algorithm with a DNN. The authors also proposed a meta-learning approach to track dynamic channel conditions. Simulation results show that ViterbiNet is robust to CSI uncertainty, i.e., the performance of ViterbiNet without the knowledge of CSI can approach that of the CSI-based Viterbi algorithm. In , Sun et al. proposed a non-trivial variation of ViterbiNet based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) for emerging communications systems where the underlying channel models are highly complex or completely unknown. In particular, GAN is used to learn the channel transition probability for the channel-dependent part of Viterbi algorithm. More recently, the DNN used in ViterbiNet is replaced by the concatenation of a convolutional neural network and a bidirectional long short-term memory network . For BCJR algorithm, the optimal maximum a-posteriori probability (MAP) symbol detector, Shlezinger et al. proposed a data-driven detector called BCJRNet , which shows improved robustness to CSI uncertainty when compared with the conventional BCJR detector. Subsequently, the authors in  proposed a BCJRNet receiver for joint symbol detection and channel decoding by using a dedicated neural network to replace the channel-model-based computation in the BCJR receiver. It can achieve 1.0 dB gain when compared with the conventional BCJR algorithm under CSI uncertainty. The conventional symbol detection methods for ISI channels, such as the Viterbi and BCJR algorithms, are special cases of sum-product algorithm on factor graph . In the view of this point, the authors in  developed efficient strategies to improve the performance of the factor graph-based symbol detection based on neural enhancement. In particular, the neural BP and generalizations of factor nodes are used to mitigate the effect of cycles within the factor graph. Simulation results show that the methods can approach MAP performances in various scenarios with low computational complexity.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: algorithms designed for channel detection/decoding and deep learning.
