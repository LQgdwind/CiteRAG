      "content": "Paper Title: Motion-based Camera Localization System in Colonoscopy Videos\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning architectures have achieved success in relative camera pose estimation and single view depth estimation   4 on monocular videos. While traditional camera pose estimation algorithms, such as visual odometry, are effective in certain settings, their reliance on accurate image correspondence matching causes problems when the images are of low texture and from a complex environment. Deep learning methods may overcome these challenges by additional supervision. Based on the view synthesis technique , the photometric error between the synthesized new view and real new view can be used as supervision to train the network, which eliminates the requirement for ground truth data. In , an end-to-end framework named SfMLearner was proposed to jointly train the single view depth and camera pose using projection error. This framework utilized unlabeled data but had a performance comparable with approaches that require ground truth. Authors in 3 proposed a simple normalization of the estimated depth map, which can effectively avoid depth prediction saturating to zero. In addition, a Direct Visual Odometry (DVO)  pose predictor was incorporated into the end-to-end training to establish a direct relationship between the depth map and the camera pose prediction. Joint pose and depth estimations prevent the determination of absolute scale. To recover the absolute scale, UnDeepVO, proposed in [ref]18, was trained using stereo image pairs. After training, the model was tested on consecutive monocular images, yielding good performance on pose estimation. In the self-supervised framework using photometric loss, several assumptions are implicitly made, including (1) a static scene; (2) Lambertian reflectance, i.e., the brightness is constant regardless of the observer’s viewing angle; (3) no change in lighting between two consecutive frames; and (4) no occlusion between two consecutive frames. These assumptions may fail in real-world applications. A number of studies proposed additional loss terms to improve the robustness of the network in these circumstances. In , in addition to photometric loss, deep feature-based warping loss was proposed to take contextual information into consideration rather than per-pixel color matching alone. Salient feature correspondences were extracted in , and a matching loss constrained by epipolar geometry was proposed to improve network optimization. GeoNet was proposed in  to jointly estimate monocular depth, camera pose, and optical flow. A geometric consistency measurement was proposed as an additional loss term to improve the network’s resilience to outliers. The GeoNet model achieved state-of-art performance on the KITTI dataset for all three tasks. In , the self-supervised framework was extended by applying the Charbonnier penalty to combine spatial and temporal reconstruction losses. In , a geometry consistency constraint was proposed to enforce the scale-consistency of depth and pose networks. Their results showed that the proposed pose network achieves performance commensurate with methods using stereo videos. In , a re-estimation approach was proposed where the camera pose estimation was decomposed into a sequence of smaller pose estimation problems. For smaller pose estimation problems, the assumptions made in camera pose estimation algorithms are more likely to hold.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: relationship between the depth map and the camera pose prediction.
