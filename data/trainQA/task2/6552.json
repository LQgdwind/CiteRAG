      "content": "Paper Title: FREEDOM: Target Label & Source Data & Domain Information-Free Multi-Source Domain Adaptation for Unsupervised Personalization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe domain shift problem caused by clients’ dissimilar environments is one of the common obstacles for deep-learning-based service providers, as the applications are known to be data-dependent. This problem originates from the distribution discrepancy between the client (target) and server (source)-side datasets . Additional adaptation with client data can be an alternative, but providing additional annotation to client data is burdensome in most cases. As a possible workaround, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) [ref]2 [ref]3 and its downstream, multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA)   aim to adapt a model to an unlabeled target by leveraging labeled source dataset.\nEspecially, MSDA considers the more plausible situation wherein it presumes the source dataset consists of samples from multiple domains. Despite these technological advances, many factors still exist to consider when projecting real-world service scenarios onto MSDA’s. Because of privacy issues on both source and target data, it is almost forbidden to transfer the dataset to each other. In other words, the client’s unlabeled data can not be transferred to the server and vice versa. Moreover, sending multiple source datasets to the client may suffer storage limitations. Recent Source-Free UDA (SFUDA) has been introduced to address this situation by only sending a source-side model, not the dataset [ref]6   . Multi-source-Free domain adaptation (MSFDA) approaches are also explored to support the multi-source cases 0 1. Existing MSFDA approaches 1 0 usually train multiple models with each source dataset to weave them for the target, requiring domain information as prior knowledge. However, there are two additional factors to take into account: 1) maintaining domain labels is pricey; 2) handcrafted information on the number of domains in the training dataset can be overwhelming prior.\nIt is a well-known problem of domain adaptation that the domain information can be unprovided 2 3. For example, a practitioner can collect training datasets from multiple channels 4, in which the number of domains could be intractable. Besides, the number of domains can be overwhelming prior; a single dataset can consist of multiple latent domains. Treating the dataset that is believed to be a single domain as a single domain may not be optimal 5 6. In this paper, we relax the unhandled condition for domain information along with the MSFDA scenario, coined three-free domain adaptation (TFDA) — domain adaptation scenario free from 1) target label, 2) source dataset at adaptation time, and 3) domain information, which is more pragmatic than previous scenarios described in Figure 1. Here, domain information embraces both multi-source domain labels and the number of source domains.\nUnder the scenario of the TFDA, we propose a three-FREE DOMain adaptation method termed FREEDOM that trains a single model from a compound multi-source dataset and deploys it to a client, supporting unsupervised adaptation to the client dataset.\nSince domain information is not provided and the target adaptation should be endowed without source datasets, we propose peripheral modules to transfer knowledge. We define ‘style’ as the remainder after subtracting typical class knowledge from the data; style is the knowledge that is the same as or includes the domain we usually believe. We train two encoders and a decoder to disentangle class and style embeddings from the given data while reconstructing its marginal distribution. As a remedy to handle domain information-free, we adopt nonparametric Bayesian as a prior for the style encoder. For the target adaptation, FREEDOM leverages the trained encoders and decoder from the source side and modulates the class encoder to transform a target input into the most likely embedding on the original class space while freezing the classifier layer.\nThe ultimate goal of FREEDOM is to adapt the class encoder with hypothesis transfer [ref]6. Thus, style encoders and decoders are exploited only to force stable adaption in a self-supervised manner and are eventually discarded after the tuning. Therefore, FREEDOM can have a lighter inference network than the MSFDAs, of which model size depends on the number of source domains 0 1. We summarize our contributions as follows: We present a more pragmatic paradigm of Multi Source-Free Domain Adaptation with no domain information (domain labels + the number of domains), namely Three-Free Domain Adaptation (TFDA). We propose a disentangling-based FREEDOM with a novel alternating adaptation method to match the source and target class distribution; it exemplifies how to employ a generative model in source-free domain adaptation. The final adaptation model of FREEDOM’s size is independent of the number of source domains, reducing the final personalized model without additional operation. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple\n\nSource\n\nDomains\n\n\n\n\nTarget\n\nLabel\n\nFree\n\n\n\n\nSource\n\nData\n\nFree\n\nDomain Information Free\n\n\n\n\nDomain\n\nLabel\n\n\n\n\nNumber of\n\nDomains\n\n\nUDA\n✗\n✓\n✗\n✗\n✗\n\nMSDA\n✓\n✓\n✗\n✗\n✗\n\nMSDA+DD\n✓\n✓\n✗\n✓\n✗\n\nSFUDA\n✗\n✓\n✓\n✗\n✗\n\nMSFDA\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✗\n✗\n\nTFDA (ours)\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: adaptation with client data can be an alternative, but providing additional annotation to client data is burdensome in most cases.
