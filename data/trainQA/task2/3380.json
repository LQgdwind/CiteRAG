      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring Global Diversity and Local Context for Video Summarization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the rise of video-sharing websites (e.g., YouTube and Facebook), the demand for video analysis surges rapidly. From a content producer‚Äôs perspective, it is not delightful experience for them to process the long videos. Under this circumstance, the automatic video processing techniques are needed desperately. Video summarization is one of the techniques for handling the massive video data, which removes the redundancy by selecting diverse segments from the video as video summary, and automated methods for generating summary are needed to be investigated. In the past few decades, various approaches [ref]1  [ref]3    [ref]7  have been proposed to automatically summarize untrimmed videos. Some works [ref]1   [ref]3 leverage the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)  and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)  for video summarization by modeling the temporal information and show great success. However, these models would fail to handle long videos since recurrent models are not able to model long-range dependency across video frames. This is because the recurrent models tend to suffer serious decay of the history information in terms of long sequences . Recently, attention-based methods    [ref]7 have been proposed to alleviate this problem by directly computing the pairwise matrix over the whole video sequence. However, there are several drawbacks: 1) pure self-attention mechanism over all video frames cannot model the diversified feature representation thus is not suitable for video summarization; 2) local temporal cues are unexplored for identifying the most representative essential in local context. For the former bottleneck, previous approaches   tend to adopt self-attention mechanism or multi-head attention mechanism to capture the temporal relation over video frames, which can be implemented by a pairwise frame similarity matrix construction and weighted average summation over all frames. These methods\nsimply adopt the dot product as the default pairwise similarity measurement, and we argue that it is not proper for video summarization task. This is because the frame pair with larger magnitude of the weight would suppress the representation of other frames therefore producing the discriminative feature representation for the whole video. But for video summarization, a good summary should reflect diversified semantic information of video, which cannot be satisfied by the dot product similarity measurement. In consequence, we develop the global diverse attention to quantify the importance of each video frame and simultaneously promote the diversity among these frames. In concrete, we find that the choice for pairwise similarity measurement in the pairwise relation modelling is vital. We use L2subscriptùêø2L_{2} similarity to substitute dot product as the similarity measuring function, which leads to more diversified feature representations. Besides, the proposed global diverse attention mechanism shares the similar computation with pure self-attention mechanism by matrix operations, and can be fully optimized by GPU parallel acceleration. For the latter bottleneck, most existing methods   tend to model the video relation globally while local temporal evolution across consecutive frames is not adequately exploited. Inspired by the concise characteristic of video summarization, the most representative information within a short video segment should be identified and extracted to reduce the redundancy. For further illustration, the beginning of the event and the ending together would foreshadow the happening of the event which should be included in the summary. To this end, we propose a local contextual attention mechanism to identify the discriminative features by modelling the local context information. In particular, the pairwise similarities between an anchored frame and its adjacent frames are computed, then the local contextual feature is generated by weighted aggregation of the adjacent frames. Therefore, the local contextual feature not only includes the representation of the original frame but also integrates local dependency among adjacent frames. In a nutshell, by combining global diverse attention and local contextual attention, we formulate a Diversified Contextual Attention (DCA) scheme and propose a model named SUM-DCA to address the above limitations, which we believe are significant signs of progress for video summarization. The main contributions can be highlighted as follows: A diversified contextual attention scheme is developed to model the diversified contextual representation of video by using the pairwise relations among frames, which enables the model to generate diversified and concise summaries. By delicately selecting the pairwise similarity function that influences the magnitude of frame relations, SUM-DCA is able to generate a diverse representation that conventional self-attention mechanism fails to capture. Extensive experiments are conducted on the benchmark data sets. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms other competing approaches on SumMe and TVSum datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: the redundancy by selecting diverse segments from the video as video summary, and automated methods for generating summary are needed to be investigated.
