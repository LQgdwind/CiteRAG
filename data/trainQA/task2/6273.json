      "content": "Paper Title: On the Role of Entanglement and Statistics in Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section we prove our main theorem. Consider the class of function states The sample complexity of learning this class in the following models is given as follows Entangled measurements: Θ​(n)Θ𝑛\\Theta(n) Separable measurements: Θ​(n2)Θsuperscript𝑛2\\Theta(n^{2}) Statistical query learning: Ω​(τ2⋅2n/2)Ω⋅superscript𝜏2superscript2𝑛2\\Omega(\\tau^{2}\\cdot 2^{n/2}) making 𝖰𝗌𝗍𝖺𝗍​(τ)𝖰𝗌𝗍𝖺𝗍𝜏\\mathsf{Qstat}(\\tau) queries. Entangled η𝜂\\eta-random classification noise: O​(n(1−2​η)2)𝑂𝑛superscript12𝜂2O(\\frac{n}{(1-2\\eta)^{2}}). Algorithm runs in time O​(n3/(1−2​η)2)𝑂superscript𝑛3superscript12𝜂2O(n^{3}/(1-2\\eta)^{2}). Points (1),(2)12(1),(2) above were proved in [ABDY22] and we do not prove it here. In the following two theorems we prove points (3),(4)34(3),(4) above. We remark that this result partially resolves an open question in [AA23, Question 18], who asked if separable η𝜂\\eta-random classification noise and 𝖰𝖲𝖰𝖰𝖲𝖰\\mathsf{QSQ} complexity can be separated in sample complexity. The concept class requires 2Ω​(n)superscript2Ω𝑛2^{\\Omega(n)} many 𝖰𝗌𝗍𝖺𝗍𝖰𝗌𝗍𝖺𝗍\\mathsf{Qstat} queries of tolerance τ=1/poly⁡(n)𝜏1poly𝑛\\tau=1/\\operatorname{poly}(n) to learn below trace distance 0.050.050.05 with high probability. We prove the hardness for algorithms using 𝖰𝗌𝗍𝖺𝗍𝖰𝗌𝗍𝖺𝗍\\mathsf{Qstat} queries using the variance lower bounding technique in Theorem 16. In particular, we show an exponentially small upper bound for the variance for any observable: for every n+1𝑛1n+1 qubit operator M𝑀M such that ‖M‖≤1norm𝑀1\\|M\\|\\leq 1 we have that where we let ψA=|ψA⟩​⟨ψA|subscript𝜓𝐴ketsubscript𝜓𝐴brasubscript𝜓𝐴\\psi_{A}=|\\psi_{A}\\rangle\\langle\\psi_{A}| for notational simplicity. To apply our results linking learning and decision problems we note that where the first inequality follows from the lower bound on trace distance by fidelity [FvdG06] and the second by Fact 7 and that ⟨ψA|ψB⟩=Prx⁡[fA​(x)=fB​(x)]inner-productsubscript𝜓𝐴subscript𝜓𝐵subscriptPr𝑥subscript𝑓𝐴𝑥subscript𝑓𝐵𝑥\\langle\\psi_{A}|\\psi_{B}\\rangle=\\Pr_{x}[f_{A}(x)=f_{B}(x)]. Fix ε=0.05𝜀0.05\\varepsilon=0.05. Then Lemma 11 holds if τ<0.085𝜏0.085\\tau<0.085, which we assume without loss of generality as previously discussed999The choice of ε=0.05𝜀0.05\\varepsilon=0.05 is arbitrarily and done for readability. A similar result holds for any ε<1/2​(1−17/32)𝜀1211732\\varepsilon<1/2(1-\\sqrt{17/32}) by the same argument. Along with Theorem 16, we obtain our lower bound on the 𝖰𝖲𝖰𝖰𝖲𝖰\\mathsf{QSQ} complexity of learning 𝒞𝒞{\\mathcal{C}}. It remains to establish Eq. (36). To this end, we need to understand To do so, we decompose ψAsubscript𝜓𝐴\\psi_{A} as follows. For every fA:{0,1}n→{0,1}:subscript𝑓𝐴→superscript01𝑛01f_{A}:\\{0,1\\}^{n}\\rightarrow\\{0,1\\} given by fA​(x)=x⊤​A​xsubscript𝑓𝐴𝑥superscript𝑥top𝐴𝑥f_{A}(x)=x^{\\top}Ax let |ψA⟩=12n​∑x|x,fA​(x)⟩ketsubscript𝜓𝐴1superscript2𝑛subscript𝑥ket𝑥subscript𝑓𝐴𝑥|\\psi_{A}\\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^{n}}}\\sum_{x}|x,f_{A}(x)\\rangle and |ϕA⟩=∑x(−1)fA​(x)​|x⟩ketsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝐴subscript𝑥superscript1subscript𝑓𝐴𝑥ket𝑥|\\phi_{A}\\rangle=\\sum_{x}(-1)^{f_{A}(x)}|x\\rangle. For convenience we let |u⟩=12n​∑x|x⟩ket𝑢1superscript2𝑛subscript𝑥ket𝑥|u\\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^{n}}}\\sum_{x}|x\\rangle. Then we see that hence we have that Any n+1𝑛1n+1 qubit observable M𝑀M can be decomposed as M=∑a,bMa,b⊗|a⟩​⟨b|𝑀subscript𝑎𝑏tensor-productsubscript𝑀𝑎𝑏ket𝑎bra𝑏M=\\sum_{a,b}M_{a,b}\\otimes|a\\rangle\\langle b| where a,b∈{+,−}𝑎𝑏a,b\\in\\{+,-\\}. Since ‖M‖≤1norm𝑀1\\|M\\|\\leq 1 we also have that ‖Ma,b‖≤1normsubscript𝑀𝑎𝑏1\\|M_{a,b}\\|\\leq 1, however the off-diagonal blocks now no longer need be Hermitian. Instead, M+,−=M−,+†subscript𝑀superscriptsubscript𝑀†M_{+,-}=M_{-,+}^{\\dagger}. In an abuse of notation we now discard the last qubit of ρiAsubscriptsuperscript𝜌𝐴𝑖\\rho^{A}_{i} and denote the resulting state also as ρiAsubscriptsuperscript𝜌𝐴𝑖\\rho^{A}_{i}. For convenience we further introduce the notation M1=M−,−subscript𝑀1subscript𝑀M_{1}=M_{-,-}, M2=M+,−subscript𝑀2subscript𝑀M_{2}=M_{+,-}, M3=M−,+subscript𝑀3subscript𝑀M_{3}=M_{-,+}, and M4=M+,+subscript𝑀4subscript𝑀M_{4}=M_{+,+} Thus, we see that 𝗍𝗋​[M​ψA]=12​∑i𝗍𝗋​[Mi​ρiA]𝗍𝗋delimited-[]𝑀subscript𝜓𝐴12subscript𝑖𝗍𝗋delimited-[]subscript𝑀𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝜌𝐴𝑖\\mathsf{tr}[M\\psi_{A}]=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i}\\mathsf{tr}[M_{i}\\rho^{A}_{i}] and further the variance can be written as Below we drop the factor of 1/4141/4 and bound the magnitude of each term for i,j∈𝑖𝑗delimited-[]4i,j\\in. We show that each term is exponentially small. To do so, we use the following fact which will be proven later. We have the following where 𝖲𝖶𝖠𝖯𝖲𝖶𝖠𝖯\\mathrm{\\mathsf{SWAP}} swaps two n𝑛n-qubit registers, i.e., 𝖲𝖶𝖠𝖯​|ψ⟩⊗|ϕ⟩=|ϕ⟩⊗|ψ⟩tensor-product𝖲𝖶𝖠𝖯ket𝜓ketitalic-ϕtensor-productketitalic-ϕket𝜓\\mathrm{\\mathsf{SWAP}}|\\psi\\rangle\\otimes|\\phi\\rangle=|\\phi\\rangle\\otimes|\\psi\\rangle and\n|Φ+⟩=2−n/2​∑x|x,x⟩ketsuperscriptΦsuperscript2𝑛2subscript𝑥ket𝑥𝑥|\\Phi^{+}\\rangle=2^{-n/2}\\sum_{x}|x,x\\rangle.\nis the EPR state of 2​n2𝑛2n qubits. First note that ρ4Asubscriptsuperscript𝜌𝐴4\\rho^{A}_{4} does not depend on A𝐴A. Thus, for all i∈𝑖delimited-[]4i\\in we have that The contribution to the variance from these cases equals 00. We are left with analyzing i,j∈[ref]3𝑖𝑗delimited-[]3i,j\\in[ref]3 and do so separately below. Case i=j=1𝑖𝑗1i=j=1. Using Fact 18 above, we get that Next, observe that where the third equality used that 𝗍𝗋​[M1⊗M1⋅𝖲𝖶𝖠𝖯]=𝗍𝗋​[M12]𝗍𝗋delimited-[]⋅tensor-productsubscript𝑀1subscript𝑀1𝖲𝖶𝖠𝖯𝗍𝗋delimited-[]superscriptsubscript𝑀12\\mathsf{tr}[M_{1}\\otimes M_{1}\\cdot\\mathrm{\\mathsf{SWAP}}]=\\mathsf{tr}\\left[M_{1}^{2}\\right], the fourth equality used that 𝗍𝗋​[M12]≤2n𝗍𝗋delimited-[]superscriptsubscript𝑀12superscript2𝑛\\mathsf{tr}\\left[M_{1}^{2}\\right]\\leq 2^{n} and ‖M1⊗2‖≤1normsuperscriptsubscript𝑀1tensor-productabsent21\\|M_{1}^{\\otimes 2}\\|\\leq 1. Implicitly we have used that M1subscript𝑀1M_{1} is Hermitian and ‖M1‖≤1normsubscript𝑀11\\|M_{1}\\|\\leq 1. Hence we have that variance term contribution is Since this term must be non-negative, the norm is bounded by 2/2n2superscript2𝑛2/2^{n} as well. Case i=j=2𝑖𝑗2i=j=2. Using Fact 18 above, we get that Next note that We now bound the norm of each of these terms individual as then, by triangle inequality, the norm of the contribution from the case is exponentially small as well. and thus |𝗍𝗋​[M2​𝔼A​[ρ2A]]2|≤12n𝗍𝗋superscriptdelimited-[]subscript𝑀2subscript𝔼𝐴delimited-[]subscriptsuperscript𝜌𝐴221superscript2𝑛\\left|\\mathsf{tr}\\left[M_{2}{\\mathbb{E}}_{A}[\\rho^{A}_{2}]\\right]^{2}\\right|\\leq\\frac{1}{2^{n}}. For the other term we use that Then we can rewrite this as 12n​‖M2​|u⟩‖22≤12n​‖M2‖2≤12n1superscript2𝑛superscriptsubscriptnormsubscript𝑀2ket𝑢221superscript2𝑛superscriptnormsubscript𝑀221superscript2𝑛\\frac{1}{2^{n}}\\|M_{2}|u\\rangle\\|_{2}^{2}\\leq\\frac{1}{2^{n}}\\|M_{2}\\|^{2}\\leq\\frac{1}{2^{n}}. Thus, the norm of the contribution from this case is upper bounded by 2/2n2superscript2𝑛2/2^{n}. Case i=j=3𝑖𝑗3i=j=3. Since M3=M2†subscript𝑀3superscriptsubscript𝑀2†M_{3}=M_{2}^{\\dagger} and ρ3A=(ρ2A)†superscriptsubscript𝜌3𝐴superscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝜌2𝐴†\\rho_{3}^{A}=(\\rho_{2}^{A})^{\\dagger}, this is the same as the case i=j=2𝑖𝑗2i=j=2, thus the norm of this case is upper bounded by 22n2superscript2𝑛\\frac{2}{2^{n}} as well. Case i=2𝑖2i=2 and j=3𝑗3j=3 Using Fact 18 note that Now we use that M3=M2†subscript𝑀3superscriptsubscript𝑀2†M_{3}=M_{2}^{\\dagger} to rewrite this as 12n​∑x|⟨u|M2|x⟩|21superscript2𝑛subscript𝑥superscriptquantum-operator-product𝑢subscript𝑀2𝑥2\\frac{1}{2^{n}}\\sum_{x}|\\langle u|M_{2}|x\\rangle|^{2} We have already shown the subtracted terms to be exponentially small in magnitude and thus the magnitude of this case must be upper bounded by 2/2n2superscript2𝑛2/2^{n} as well. Case i=1𝑖1i=1 and j=2,3𝑗23j=2,3. Here we work out j=2𝑗2j=2 as the result then holds similarly for j=3𝑗3j=3. We deal with each term in the trace above separately. First: The next two terms are similar and we bound the first here (which implies the same upper bound for the second using nearly identical steps). The last remaining term is bounded as follows: Thus, the contribution from the second moments is of magnitude at most O​(2−n/2)𝑂superscript2𝑛2O(2^{-n/2}). While |𝗍𝗋​[M1​𝔼A​[ρ1A]]|𝗍𝗋delimited-[]subscript𝑀1subscript𝔼𝐴delimited-[]superscriptsubscript𝜌1𝐴\\left|\\mathsf{tr}[M_{1}\\mathbb{E}_{A}[\\rho_{1}^{A}]]\\right| may be large (up to 111), we also have that |𝗍𝗋​[M2​𝔼A​[ρ2A]]|≤12n𝗍𝗋delimited-[]subscript𝑀2subscript𝔼𝐴delimited-[]superscriptsubscript𝜌2𝐴1superscript2𝑛\\left|\\mathsf{tr}[M_{2}\\mathbb{E}_{A}[\\rho_{2}^{A}]]\\right|\\leq\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^{n}}} and thus all terms in the case are exponentially small in norm as well. We have thus shown that the norms of the contributions for each case are all exponentially small. Thus, the variance must be exponentially small as well. It remains to prove Fact 18 which we do now. Most of the desired expectation values stem from the following observation: for the uniform distribution over upper triangular matrices A𝐴A, we have that where X𝑋X, Y𝑌Y, and Z𝑍Z are defined as x​xT𝑥superscript𝑥𝑇xx^{T}, y​yT𝑦superscript𝑦𝑇yy^{T}, and z​zT𝑧superscript𝑧𝑇zz^{T} respectively. The second equality follows from Ez​[(−1)⟨x,z⟩]=δx,0subscript𝐸𝑧delimited-[]superscript1𝑥𝑧subscript𝛿𝑥0E_{z}[(-1)^{\\langle x,z\\rangle}]=\\delta_{x,0} and the third from the fact that X+Y𝑋𝑌X+Y is rank 222 over 𝔽2subscript𝔽2\\mathbb{F}_{2} unless x=y𝑥𝑦x=y. Now the first three equalities are now easy to see: set y=z=0𝑦𝑧0y=z=0 and Similarly, setting z=0𝑧0z=0 yields Similar reasoning implies 𝔼A​[|ϕA⟩​⟨ϕA|]=𝕀/2nsubscript𝔼𝐴delimited-[]ketsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝐴brasubscriptitalic-ϕ𝐴𝕀superscript2𝑛\\mathbb{E}_{A}[|\\phi_{A}\\rangle\\langle\\phi_{A}|]=\\mathbb{I}/2^{n}, 𝔼A​[|ϕA⟩⊗⟨ϕA|]=12n​∑x|x⟩⊗⟨x|subscript𝔼𝐴delimited-[]tensor-productketsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝐴brasubscriptitalic-ϕ𝐴1superscript2𝑛subscript𝑥tensor-productket𝑥bra𝑥\\mathbb{E}_{A}[|\\phi_{A}\\rangle\\otimes\\langle\\phi_{A}|]=\\frac{1}{2^{n}}\\sum_{x}|x\\rangle\\otimes\\langle x|, and The final decomposition of 𝔼A​[|ϕA⟩​⟨ϕA|⊗2]subscript𝔼𝐴delimited-[]ketsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝐴superscriptbrasubscriptitalic-ϕ𝐴tensor-productabsent2\\mathbb{E}_{A}[|\\phi_{A}\\rangle\\langle\\phi_{A}|^{\\otimes 2}] follows from [ABDY22, Proposition 2].\n∎ The proof of the fact concludes the proof of the theorem.\n∎ The concept class can be learned in the η𝜂\\eta-random classification model, using O​(n/(1−2​η)2)𝑂𝑛superscript12𝜂2O(n/(1-2\\eta)^{2}) copies of the noisy state and time O​(n3/(1−2​η)2)𝑂superscript𝑛3superscript12𝜂2O(n^{3}/(1-2\\eta)^{2}). Below, let |ϕf⟩=12n​∑x(−1)f​(x)​|x⟩ketsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑓1superscript2𝑛subscript𝑥superscript1𝑓𝑥ket𝑥|\\phi_{f}\\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^{n}}}\\sum_{x}(-1)^{f(x)}|x\\rangle. In the classification noise model, we are given copies of We first show that we can convert |ψn⟩ketsubscript𝜓𝑛|\\psi_{n}\\rangle to |ϕf⟩ketsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑓|\\phi_{f}\\rangle. In order to do so, observe the following Now, measuring the last qubit, the probability of seeing b=1𝑏1b=1 is given by and the post-measurement state is given by |ϕf⟩ketsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑓|\\phi_{f}\\rangle. Hence with probability exactly p=12​(1−2​η​(1−η))≥14​(1−2​η)2𝑝1212𝜂1𝜂14superscript12𝜂2p=\\frac{1}{2}(1-2\\sqrt{\\eta(1-\\eta)})\\geq\\frac{1}{4}(1-2\\eta)^{2}, we can convert |ψf⟩ketsubscript𝜓𝑓|\\psi_{f}\\rangle to |ϕf⟩ketsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑓|\\phi_{f}\\rangle. Now we focus on the concept class {fA​(x)=x⊤​A​x}Asubscriptsubscript𝑓𝐴𝑥superscript𝑥top𝐴𝑥𝐴\\{f_{A}(x)=x^{\\top}Ax\\}_{A}. The learning algorithm first takes O​(1/(1−2​η)2)𝑂1superscript12𝜂2O(1/(1-2\\eta)^{2}) copies of |ψA⟩ketsubscript𝜓𝐴|\\psi_{A}\\rangle to produce two copies of |ϕA⟩ketsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝐴|\\phi_{A}\\rangle. Note that the algorithm knows when it succeeded, i.e., when the measurement of the last qubit is 111, the algorithm knows that the above procedure performed the transformation |ψA⟩⊗2→|ϕA⟩⊗2→superscriptketsubscript𝜓𝐴tensor-productabsent2superscriptketsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝐴tensor-productabsent2|\\psi_{A}\\rangle^{\\otimes 2}\\rightarrow|\\phi_{A}\\rangle^{\\otimes 2}.
