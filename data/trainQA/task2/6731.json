Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: OpenFlamingo: An Open-Source Framework for Training Large Autoregressive Vision-Language Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA popular format for vision and language models is (image, text) →→\\rightarrow text, i.e., models take as input an image and some text, and produce text as output, e.g., BLIP-2 [ref]22.The flexible format directly supports tasks like image classification\nand visual question answering (VQA).\n However, assuming a single image as input is limiting:\nautoregressive vision-language models enable new capabilities by instead mapping an arbitrarily interleaved sequence of images and text to textual outputs.\nThis interface provides important flexibility:\nthe input sequence can include demonstrations for a new task, enabling few-shot, in-context learning  or multi-round multi-modal chatbot interactions.\nEvaluations suggest that autoregressive vision-language models can be performant foundation models [ref]5:\nmodels like Flamingo , CM3 , Kosmos-1 2, PALM-E [ref]8, and multimodal GPT-4  generalize well across diverse vision-language tasks. Unfortunately, these autoregressive vision-language models are closed-source, and their weights, training data, code, and hyperparameters are proprietary.\nThis limits the academic community’s ability to conduct research on autoregressive vision-language models, e.g., to understand how web-scraped image-text data affects models’ performance and safety.\nOpen-source alternatives, such as LLaVA , LLaMA-Adapter , BLIP-2 , and mPLUG-Owl 9, only take in single images, and they often directly train on curated datasets like COCO  rather than web data. In this technical report, we document our experiences building an open-source reproduction of the Flamingo models .\nFollowing Flamingo, we augment the layers of pretrained, frozen language models so\nthat they cross attend to the outputs of a frozen\nvision encoder while predicting the next token.\nThe cross-modal module is trained on web-scraped image-text sequences, in our case, two open source datasets: LAION-2B 2 and Multimodal C4 .\nOur stack is built using publicly available components, including CLIP as a vision encoder 0 and open-source language models as decoders  5. We call the resulting family of five models OpenFlamingo.\nThese models range from 3B to 9B parameters, with both standard and instruction-tuned 7 language model backbones.\nWhen averaging performance across 7 evaluation datasets, OpenFlamingo-3B and -9B models attain 85% and 89% of their corresponding Flamingo models respectively (Figure 1).\nModels and code are open-sourced at https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_flamingo.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: A popular format for vision and language models is (image, text) →→\\rightarrow text, i.e., models take as input an image and some text, and produce text as output, e.g., BLIP-2 [ref]22.The flexible format directly supports tasks like image classification\nand visual question answering (VQA).\n However, assuming a single image as input is limiting:\nautoregressive\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
