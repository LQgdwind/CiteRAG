Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5.

      "content": "Paper Title: Syntax-Aware On-the-Fly Code Completion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere exist various non-AST-based code completion approaches in CodeXGLUE  [ref]4 and AST-based code completion approaches [ref]6  [ref]9 in the literature.\nTo ensure that our evaluation is reasonably comprehensive, we consider a total of eight (8) baselines with respect to two evaluation settings: (1) externally evaluate the prediction results through the CodeXGLUE leaderboard,121212https://microsoft.github.io/CodeXGLUE/ and (2) internally evaluate the prediction results within our own setting. For the CodeXGLUE evaluation setting, we compare our approach with CodeGPT-adapt, CodeGPT, GPT-2, Transformer (12L), and LSTM+BPE.\nTo do so, we apply our PyCoder to the testing set provided by CodeXGLUE for both token-level and line-level predictions.\nThen, the prediction results are submitted to the CodeXGLUE team to obtain the results based on their evaluation setting.\nAdditionally, we also include the results from UniXcoder  for a comprehensive comparison, as the authors experimented on the same CodeXGLUE benchmark setting. For our own evaluation setting, we consider two AST-based approaches (i.e., Pointer Mixture Network [ref]9 and TravTrans [ref]6); two non AST-based approaches (i.e., GPT-2 and CodeGPT); and a multi-modal pretrain model (i.e., UniXcoder).\nWe do not consider CodeFill , since the available replication package is not executable.\nWe also do not consider Codex (i.e., a descendant of GPT-3 for source code) in our experiment due to the different levels of model parameter size.\nGPT-3, a base model of Codex, has 175B model parameters, which is 100x larger than the size of our GPT-2 based model which has only 117M model parameters.\nBelow, we describe the details of each approach. Pointer Mixture Network (PMN), proposed by Li et al. [ref]9, is an LSTM-based code completion\nleveraging AST information for syntactic structures.\nThe model is designed with pointer networks to mitigate the OOV problems in code completion.\nTheir replication package is available on Github131313https://github.com/jack57lee/neuralCodeCompletion and also in Pytorch version141414https://github.com/oleges1/code-completion. TravTrans, proposed by Kim et al. [ref]6, is a transformer-based model that considers the syntactical structure of source code via AST information.\nTheir replication package is available on GitHub151515https://github.com/facebookresearch/code-prediction-transformer. GPT-2, proposed by Radford et al. [ref]4, is a GPT-2-based model for text generation tasks.\nThe GPT-2 model is first pre-trained on millions of English web pages (the WebText corpus) to build a language model through self-supervision learning without any explicit labels.\nThe model is available on HuggingFace161616https://huggingface.co/gpt2. CodeGPT, proposed by Lu et al. , is a GPT-2-based model for source code generation.\nThe CodeGPT model is a GPT-2 model that is pre-trained on a monolingual python source code from CodeSearchNet  dataset.\nThe model is available on HuggingFace171717https://huggingface.co/microsoft/CodeGPT-small-py. UniXcoder, proposed by Guo et al. , is a Transformers-based unified cross-modal pre-trained model for source code generation.\nThe UniXcoder model is pretrained on three types of language model tasks: masked language model, unidirectional language model, and denoising objective, and two types of inputs: comment and flattened AST.\nThe pretrain datasets are six programming languages from CodeSearchNet dataset , and natural text from C4 dataset .\nTheir replication package is available on Github181818https://github.com/microsoft/CodeBERT/tree/master/UniXcoder.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: There exist various non-AST-based code completion approaches in CodeXGLUE  [ref]4 and AST-based code completion approaches [ref]6  [ref]9 in the literature.\nTo ensure that our evaluation is reasonably comprehensive, we consider a total of eight (8) baselines with respect to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
