Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

We evaluate MoodCat on the most recent semantic OOD detection benchmarks, SC-OOD benchmarks .\nSC-OOD benchmarks provide extensive semantic-level OOD detection settings for evaluation.\nSpecifically, from SC-OOD, images from different datasets are filtered to ensure that only those containing different semantic meanings are considered as OOD samples.\nSC-OOD focus on the semantic difference between samples, thus being more practical for the real-world model deployment than other previous OOD benchmarks[ref]16 [ref]27 [ref]17, which are built by setting one dataset as In-D and all others as OOD. Datasets.\nFollowing the settings in , we employ Cifar-10 , Cifar-100  as In-D samples, respectively, and others as OOD samples.\nWhen setting Cifar-10 as In-D, we employ six datasets as OOD datasets, including Svhn , Cifar-100 , Texture , Places365 , Lsun 8 and Tiny-ImageNet .\nFor Cifar-100 benchmarks, the OOD datasets are the same as that of Cifar-10, except for swapping Cifar-100 for Cifar-10 as OOD.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: meanings are considered as OOD samples.\nSC-OOD focus on the semantic difference between samples, thus being more practical for the real-world model deployment than other previous OOD benchmarks[ref]16 [ref]27 [ref]17, which are built by setting one dataset as In-D and all others as OOD.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
