      "content": "Paper Title: New Models for Understanding and Reasoning about Speculative Execution Attacks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSpeculative execution attacks have been defined, e.g., in       . To model speculative execution attacks, Disselkoen et al. proposed a memory model based on pomsets to allow speculative evaluation. However, this model only covers speculative secret access, but does not show how the secret is sent through a cache covert channel. Canella et al. summarized and evaluated speculative execution attacks and some defenses. However, their work does not provide a systematic model for attacks and defenses that provides insights on designing and evaluating new secure defenses. On the formal modeling side, Guarnieri et al. proposed the speculative non-interference property to verify that a program behaves the same with and without speculation. Cheang et al. proposed trace property-dependent observational determinism (TPOD) to verify that two traces of execution are not distinguishable. These formal methods cannot reason about the defenses, while we can show why defenses work and which ones will not work. Previous work has been proposed to evaluate caches’ resilience against (non-speculative) side-channel attacks. He et al.[ref]20 proposed the probabilistic information flow graph (PIFG) to model the cache, attacker and victim simultaneously. Zhang et al. quantified information leakage via mutual information. Demme et al. proposed the Side-channel Vulnerability Factor (SVF) and Zhang et al. refined it as the Cache Side-channel Vulnerability (CSV) for access-based attacks. However, none of these past work on cache side-channel attacks covers speculative execution attacks.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: defenses, while we can show why defenses work and which ones will not work.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
