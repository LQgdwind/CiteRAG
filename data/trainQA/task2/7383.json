Embedding Hardware Approximations in Discrete Genetic-based Training for Printed MLPs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNext, we evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, in generating printed-battery powered MLP classifiers.\nAs shown in Table II, Breast Cancer, RedWine, and WhiteWine classifiers are compatible with a Blue Spark 5​mW5milliwatt5$\\mathrm{mW}$ battery, while Cardio can be powered by a Zinergy 15​mW15milliwatt15$\\mathrm{mW}$ battery.\nPendigits, with its larger topology requiring 145145145 parameters, cannot be powered even with a Molex 30​mW30milliwatt30$\\mathrm{mW}$ battery. Our applied approximations result in faster MLPs compared to their exact baseline equivalents.\nThis enables further power reduction by scaling the supply voltage without sacrificing performance, i.e., maintaining the same latency as the baseline circuit .\nHence, we can now power previously unpowered MLPs like Pendigits or use smaller printed energy sources.\nThis is very advantageous for compact, self-powered designs like wearables.\nImplantable and wearable medical devices prioritize functionality, user comfort, and device longevity, thus harvesting energy from the body is highly efficient. Integrating energy harvesting ensures continuous operation . Considering that EGFET printed circuits can operate down to 0.6​V0.6volt0.6$\\mathrm{V}$ 0 and that printed batteries are customizable in terms of polarity, voltage, shape, etc. 1, we set the voltage supply of our approximate MLPs (MLPs in Table II) to the minimum supported value, i.e., 0.6​V0.6volt0.6$\\mathrm{V}$, and re-synthesize our designs.\nIn Figure 5, our MLPs, along with the baseline  and [ref]5, are categorized based on their area and suitable power source.\nAgain, the 5%percent55\\% accuracy constraint is considered.\nAs shown in Figure 4, among the state-of-the-art works, [ref]5 outperformed [ref]7  in area-power gains and accuracy.\nIn Figure 5, the red zone denotes an unsustainable area where the circuit’s size is considered excessively large for most printed applications or where there isn’t an adequate power supply.\nThe other zones use a different color based on the printed power source considered, e.g., printed battery Molex 30​mW30milliwatt30$\\mathrm{mW}$. Figure 5 demonstrates how our framework benefits the area-power trade-off by shifting the MLPs to a lower area-power space.\nAs shown, all the baseline MLPs lie in the red zone while the approximate MLPs [ref]5 mainly require large batteries.\nOn the other hand, all our circuits, except for Pendigits lie within the green zone, indicating that they can be powered by only a printed energy harvester.\nAlthough our Pendigits MLP can be now powered by a Molex 30​mW30milliwatt30$\\mathrm{mW}$ battery, its area might be impractical for most printed applications.\nNote that the Pendigits MLPs of [ref]5 and  cannot be powered by any existing printed power source.\nOn average, our MLPs at 0.6​V0.6volt0.6$\\mathrm{V}$ achieve 912×{\\color[rgb]{0,0,0}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0,0,0}\\pgfsys@color@gray@stroke{0}\\pgfsys@color@gray@fill{0}912\\times} lower power compared to the baseline .\nSimilarly, compared to [ref]5, our MLPs at 0.6​V0.6volt0.6$\\mathrm{V}$ achieve 65×{\\color[rgb]{0,0,0}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0,0,0}\\pgfsys@color@gray@stroke{0}\\pgfsys@color@gray@fill{0}65\\times} lower power on average.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: of our approximate MLPs (MLPs in Table II) to the minimum supported value, i.e., 0.6​V0.6volt0.6$\\mathrm{V}$, and re-synthesize our designs.\nIn Figure 5, our MLPs, along with the baseline  and [ref]5, are categorized based on their area and suitable power source.\nAgain, the 5%percent55\\% accuracy constraint is considered.\nAs shown in Figure 4, among the state-of-the-art works, [ref]5\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
