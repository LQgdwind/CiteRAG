      "content": "Paper Title: Universal Domain Adaptation in Ordinal Regression\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDomain adaptation techniques were introduced to address the domain shift between source and target domains  . Domain adaptation (DA) is a form of transfer learning that aims to learn a model from a labeled source domain that can generalize well to a different (but related) unlabeled or sparsely labeled target domain.\nDomain adaptation has demonstrated a significant success in various applications, including image classification ,\nsemantic segmentation , object recognition  object detection, 3D point cloud segmentation , etc.\nThese successes are due to the same semantic space shared by source and target domains. Common classes implicitly structure the output space, where separation between two classes in the source can be transferred to the target. Moreover this knowledge makes possible totally unsupervised domain adaptation  . More challenging problems of partial and open set domain adaptation have been recently addressed [ref]2 . In universal domain adaptation(UDA) 6 , source and target domains share a set of common classes but each domain may have its private classes. The task is to identify source and target images in common classes to apply domain adaptation.\nExisting UDA methods\ncount on entropy-based and uncertainty criteria to weigh down images estimated as being in private source classes   or target clusters   3\nand mark all private target images as “unknown”. In this paper we investigate the UDA problem in ordinal regression aiming to solve a classiﬁcation problem where classes are not independent but follow a natural order.\nOrdinal regression (OR) is an important research topic in machine learning    2.\nIts applications include age estimation   2, depth estimation , human preferences  and ratings . Moreover, any 1D regression task is convertable in OR by discretizing the target variable .\nTo take into account the class order, multiple shallow and deep methods have been developed for OR    2 4. In this paper we build on the recent state of the art method of consistent rank logits (CoRaL) . Domain shift in OR faces the same challenges as in classification. Transferring source OR classifier to target domain requires learning domain invariant representations. If source and target domains share the same classes, multiple well known solutions 4 9 \ncan be adopted by ignoring the class order or by replacing the cross entropy loss in source classifier with the OR loss . However, domain shift in OR usually comprises the output shift (also called category shift). Consider the example of domain shift in human face age estimation. UTKFace and AFAD are two popular datasets for training the age estimation models  2. AFAD\nis a collection of Asian face images aged between 15 and 40 years old; UTKFace is a universal face dataset with the age range from 1 to 80 years. The domain shift combines the input shift (faces of different human races) and output shift (ages).\nA model trained on UTKFace and adopted to AFAD should be able to constrain estimations to the target age range. Inversely, a model trained on AFAD and adopted to UTKFace should detect extra classes and, if possible, make predictions beyond the source age range.\n Existing UDA methods for classification [ref]2   3 6  perform sub-optimally under output shift in OR, for two reasons. First, they assume class independence and follow an entropy minimization approach to enforce the decision boundary to pass through low-density area. The uncertainty of class predictions serves to detect outlier source classes in partial DA [ref]2;\nlow confidence entropy helps detect source and target private images in open set DA ;\nneighbour clustering exploits the cluster structure of the target domain for cluster matching 6. However the clustering assumption is often invalidated in OR. By their nature, ordinal data span a low-dimensional manifold where classes are assigned via thresholding  . This can confuse the entropy-based criteria for separating common and private images and lead to domain misalignment and negative transfer. Second, as classes are treated independently, existing UDA methods are prone to making boundary decision order inconsistent where classes marked as common mix up with classes marked as private. If trained separately, source and target domains form two separate manifolds due to their domain specific features (see Figure 2.a).\nLearning domain-invariant representations 4 \nenables forming one unique manifold (see Figure 2.b).\nHowever, to avoid the misalignment, the DA method should accurately separate common and private classes and train the domain discriminator on the common classes only.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: to the target. Moreover this knowledge makes possible totally unsupervised domain adaptation  . More challenging problems of partial and open set domain adaptation have been recently addressed [ref]2 . In universal domain adaptation(UDA) 6 , source and target domains share a set of common classes but each domain may have its private classes. The task is to identify source and target images\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
