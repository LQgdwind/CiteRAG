      "content": "Paper Title: Fast Hybrid Network Algorithms for Shortest Paths in Sparse Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe idea of hybrid networks is to leverage multiple communication modes with different characteristics to deliver scalable throughput, or to reduce complexity, cost or power consumption.\nIn hybrid data center networks¬†, for example, the server racks can make use of optical switches   or wireless antennas     to establish direct connections in addition to using the traditional electronic packet switches.\nOther examples of hybrid communication are combining multipoint with standard VPN connections , hybrid WANs , or mobile phones using device-to-device communication in addition to cellular networks as in 5G .\nAs a consequence, several theoretical models and algorithms have been proposed for hybrid networks in recent years   [ref]7 . In this paper, we focus on the general hybrid network model of Augustine et al. .\nThe authors distinguish two different modes of communication, a local mode, which nodes can use to send messages to their neighbors in an input graph Gùê∫G, and a global mode, which allows the nodes to communicate with any other node of Gùê∫G.\nThe model is parameterized by the number of messages ŒªùúÜ\\lambda that can be sent over each local edge in each round, and the total number of messages Œ≥ùõæ\\gamma that each node can send and receive over global edges in a single round.\nTherefore, the local network rather relates to physical networks, where an edge corresponds to a dedicated connection that cannot be adapted by the nodes, e.g., a cable, an optical connection, or a wireless ad-hoc connection.\nOn the other hand, the global network captures characteristics of logical networks, which are formed as overlays of a shared physical infrastructure such as the internet or a cellular network.\nHere, nodes can in principle contact any other node, but can only perform a limited amount of communication in each round. Specifically, we consider the hybrid network model with Œª=O‚Äã(1)ùúÜùëÇ1\\lambda=O(1) and Œ≥=O‚Äã(log‚Å°n)ùõæùëÇùëõ\\gamma=O(\\log n), i.e., the local network corresponds to the CONGEST model¬†, whereas the global network is the so-called node-capacitated clique (NCC) [ref]7  .\nThereby, we only grant the nodes very limited communication capabilities for both communication modes, disallowing them, for example, to gather complete neighborhood information to support their computation.\nWith the exception of a constant factor SSSP approximation, none of the shortest paths algorithms of , for example, can be directly applied to this very restricted setting, since  assumes the LOCAL model for the local network.\nFurthermore, our algorithms do not even exploit the power of the NCC for the global network; in fact, they would also work if the nodes would initially only knew their neighbors in Gùê∫G and had to learn new node identifiers via introduction (which has recently been termed the NCC0 model¬†[ref]6). As in , we focus on shortest paths problems.\nHowever, instead of investigating general graphs, we present polylogarithmic time algorithms to compute Single-Source Shortest Paths (SSSP) and the diameter in sparse graphs.\nSpecifically, we present randomized O‚Äã(log‚Å°n)ùëÇùëõO(\\log n) time algorithms for cactus graphs, which are graphs in which any two cycles share at most one node.\nCactus graphs are relevant for wireless communication networks, where they can model combinations of star/tree and ring networks (e.g., ), or combinations of ring and bus structures in LANs (e.g., ).\nHowever, research on solving graph problems in cactus graphs mostly focuses on the sequential setting (e.g.,      [ref]45). Furthermore, we present 333-approximate randomized algorithms with runtime O‚Äã(log2‚Å°n)ùëÇsuperscript2ùëõO(\\log^{2}n) for graphs that contain at most n+O‚Äã(n1/3)ùëõùëÇsuperscriptùëõ13n+O(n^{1/3}) edges and have arboricity111The arboricity of a graph Gùê∫G is the minimum number of forests into which its edges can be partitioned. O‚Äã(log‚Å°n)ùëÇùëõO(\\log n).\nGraphs with bounded arboricity, which include important graph families such as planar graphs, graphs with bounded treewidth, or graphs that exclude a fixed minor, have been extensively studied in the past years.\nNote that although these graphs are very sparse, in contrast to cactus graphs they may still contain a polynomial number of (potentially nested) cycles.\nOur algorithms are exponentially faster than the best known algorithms for general graphs for shortest paths problems¬†[ref]7 . For the All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) problem, which is not studied in this paper, there is a lower bound of Œ©~‚Äã(n)~Œ©ùëõ\\widetilde{\\Omega}(\\sqrt{n}) [8, Theorem 2.5] that even holds for O~‚Äã(n)~ùëÇùëõ\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})-approximations222The O~~ùëÇ\\widetilde{O}-notation hides polylogarithmic factors..\nRecently, this lower bound was shown to be tight up to polylogarithmic factors¬†.\nThe bound specifically also holds for trees, which, together with the results in this paper, shows an exponential gap between computing the diameter and solving APSP in trees.\nFurthermore, the results of  show that computing (an approximation of) the diameter in general graphs takes time roughly Œ©‚Äã(n1/3)Œ©superscriptùëõ13\\Omega(n^{1/3}) (even with unbounded local communication).\nTherefore, our paper demonstrates that sparse graphs allow for an exponential improvement.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: using device-to-device communication in addition to cellular networks as in 5G .\nAs a consequence, several theoretical models and algorithms have been proposed for hybrid networks in recent years   [ref]7 .
