      "content": "Paper Title: 3DStyleNet: Creating 3D Shapes with Geometric and Texture Style Variations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTraining neural networks to reconstruct 3D objects from partial observations such as from a single monocular image, requires large amounts of training data. However, obtaining very large-scale 3D object datasets with high quality geometry and texture is hard and expensive. To augment the 3D training set, the most widely used technique is domain randomization  which randomizes colors/textures of objects when training downstream models.\nIn our work, we propose to use our method as a way to perform 3D synthetic data augmentation. In particular, we here focus on the task of single-image 3D reconstruction of single objects.\nWe propose to use both geometry and texture style transfer to augment the 3D training data, and validate the performance of our model with comparisons to strong baselines. Experimental Settings:\nAs described in §4.1, we use 221 animal objects randomly selected from the 442 collected animals from Turbosquid as our training set for single image 3D reconstruction. We use our 3DStyleNet to augment the training set by transferring the geometry and texture from one 3D object to another, which yields 221×221221221221\\times 221 objects in total. We render all objects into 24 different views, and train DISN [ref]55 to predict 3D shapes from images. We additionally predict RGB color for each 3D coordinate. Training details can be found in the Supplement.\nTo evaluate performance, we use the remaining 221 objects from Turbosquid as test set, and split them into three categories: Seen Shapes, Similar Shapes, and Unseen Shapes according to the chamfer distance to the closest shape in the training set(before augmentation). Note that while the shape of the objects in Seen category matches some in the training set, the texture of the objects is distinct. Following past literature  [ref]55  , we evaluate the 3D reconstruction quality using the Chamfer Distance, Chamfer-L1, and F-score. We provide results in terms of other metrics and results on another category(Cars) in Supplement. To evaluate our method as a data augmentation strategy, we compare with the following baselines: a) no data augmentation, where the network is only trained on (rendered views of) 221 training objects. For texture-based augmentation, we compare with b) random texture replacement akin to domain randomization work , where for each of the 221 objects we randomly select 221221221 COCO  images as new textures (yielding 221×221221221221\\times 221 combinations), and c) using image style transfer [ref]27 to transfer the texture image style from one training object to another. For geometry-based augmentation, we compare with d) random affine transformations, where we randomly apply different 221221221 affine transformations to each of the training objects (scale of the affine transformation is the same as in our method), and e) using a Neural Cage model [ref]57 trained on our 1,120 non-textured shape set to deform the geometry of each training object to another. We further compare with f) a combination of Neural Cage for shape deformation and Image Style Transfer [ref]27 for texture augmentation. Finally, we also ablate our own method when using geometry style transfer only, texture style transfer only, and both texture and geometry but without fine-tuning stage. Note that across all baselines but the no-data-augmentation, we use 221×221221221221\\times 221 textured shapes for training the 3D reconstruction method, making this a fair experiment. Experimental Results:\nQuantitative and qualitative results are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 7, respectively.\nComparing with no data augmentation which is typically done in 3D reconstruction works, ours and baseline augmentation methods achieve significant improvements.\nRandom Affine transformations achieves the worst results, as it degrades the quality of training data and makes it harder for the networks to learn shape priors. Comparing the Neural Cage [ref]57 Geometry with Ours Geometry Transfer only, we achieve higher quality 3D reconstruction, showing the usefulness of affine transformation field in geometric style transfer. For texture augmentation, compared to both Random COCO  texture and Style Transfer [ref]27 Texture, ours texture transfer method achieves comparable or in some metrics worst performance. Note that the texture-based augmentation methods perform best on the Seen category, which we attribute to the network overfitting to the geometry in the training set. Since some test shapes in seen category have the same shape geometry but different texture as in training set, the texture randomization methods are directly optimizing for the downstream network to disregard texture and memorize shapes. The performance of texture-randomization methods drops significantly on the Unseen category where both textures and shapes are novel. Here our full approach significantly outperforms texture-randomization methods. Comparing Neural Cage [ref]57 + Style Transfer [ref]27 with our full model, we achieve comparable performance in terms of Chamfer and Chamfer-L1, and better performance in terms of F-score and qualitative results. This demonstrates the effectiveness of 3DStyleNet as a 3D data augmentation technique. Qualitative Results on Real Data:\nTo evaluate how well the 3D reconstruction model trained using our augmentation strategy generalizes to real images, we directly utilize the trained network to the SMAL  dataset without fine-tuning. Since DISN [ref]55 requires camera pose during inference, we train the occupancy network that does not require the camera views on our augmented 221×221221221221\\times 221 data. We provide qualitative results in Fig. 8. Although we only train the model on synthetic rendered images and human-created shapes from Turbosquid, the network is able to reconstruct shapes from masked real images to a good precision. Additional results can be found in Supplement.\n\nReference markers found: [55]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]55: set by transferring the geometry and texture from one 3D object to another, which yields 221×221221221221\\times 221 objects in total.
