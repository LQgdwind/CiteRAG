The methods developed in this area to date find a wide range of applications in mathematics and computer science.\nIn this paper we consider the polynomial Ideal Membership Problem, where we want to decide if a given polynomial belongs to a given ideal.\nThis is a fundamental algorithmic problem with important applications in solving polynomial systems (see e.g. ), polynomial identity testing   and underlies proof systems such as Nullstellensatz and Polynomial Calculus (see e.g.   ). To introduce the problem formally, let 𝔽​[x1,…,xn]𝔽subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛\\mathbb{F}[x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}] be the ring of polynomials over a field 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} with indeterminates x1,…,xnsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}. A polynomial ideal I𝐼I is a subset of the polynomial ring 𝔽​[x1,…,xn]𝔽subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛\\mathbb{F}[x_{1},\\dots,x_{n}] with two properties: for any two polynomials f,g𝑓𝑔f,g in I𝐼I, f+g𝑓𝑔f+g also belongs to I𝐼I and so does h​fℎ𝑓hf for any polynomial h∈𝔽​[x1,…,xn]ℎ𝔽subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛h\\in\\mathbb{F}[x_{1},\\dots,x_{n}].\nBy the Hilbert Basis Theorem  every ideal I𝐼I has a finite generating set F={f1,…,fr}⊂I𝐹subscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑟𝐼F=\\{f_{1},\\ldots,f_{r}\\}\\subset I such that for every f∈𝔽​[x1,…,xn]𝑓𝔽subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛f\\in\\mathbb{F}[x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}], we have f∈I𝑓𝐼f\\in I if and only if there is an “ideal membership proof”, namely a set of polynomials {h1,…,hr}⊂𝔽​[x1,…,xn]subscriptℎ1…subscriptℎ𝑟𝔽subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛\\{h_{1},\\ldots,h_{r}\\}\\subset\\mathbb{F}[x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}] such that f=h1​f1+…+hr​fr𝑓subscriptℎ1subscript𝑓1…subscriptℎ𝑟subscript𝑓𝑟f=h_{1}f_{1}+\\ldots+h_{r}f_{r}.\nThe polynomial Ideal Membership Problem (IMP) is to find out if a polynomial f𝑓f belongs to an ideal I𝐼I or not, given a set F𝐹F of generators of the ideal (we use IMPdsubscriptIMP𝑑\\textsc{IMP}_{d} to denote IMP when the input polynomial f𝑓f has degree at most d=O​(1)𝑑𝑂1d=O(1)).\nThe IMP is, in general, notoriously intractable. The results of Mayr and Meyer show that it is EXPSPACE-complete 0 1. Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations have been a powerful technique for approximation algorithm design ever since the celebrated Goemans and Williamson result of Max-Cut . With the aim to construct stronger and stronger SDP relaxations, the Sum-of-Squares (SoS) hierarchy has emerged as the most promising set of relaxations (see, e.g., ). However, we still do not know the answer to even very basic questions about its power. For example, we do not even know when SoS is guaranteed to run in polynomial time. As recently observed by O’Donnell 2, a bounded degree SoS proof does not necessarily imply its low bit complexity, showing that the often repeated claim that for any fixed degree SoS runs in polynomial time, is far from true. O’Donnell raised the open problem to establish useful conditions under which “small” SoS proofs can be guaranteed. With this aim, a first elegant sufficient condition is due to Raghavendra and Weitz 4 . For each instance 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} of a combinatorial problem, the set of polynomials that vanish at every point of the set of solutions of 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is called the combinatorial ideal of 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} and denoted by I𝒞subscript𝐼𝒞I_{\\mathcal{C}}.\nTo satisfy Raghavendra and Weitz’s criterion, it is necessary (but also sufficient) that the ideal membership problem IMPdsubscriptIMP𝑑\\textsc{IMP}_{d} for each I𝒞subscript𝐼𝒞I_{\\mathcal{C}} is polynomial-time solvable and\nthat ideal membership proofs can be efficiently found too.222Note that answering whether a polynomial belongs to a certain ideal does not necessarily mean finding an ideal membership proof of that.\nSo the tractability of the ideal membership proof ensures that SoS runs in polynomial time for combinatorial problems. This is currently the only known general result that addresses the SoS bit complexity issue. However, the IMPdsubscriptIMP𝑑\\textsc{IMP}_{d} tractability criterion of Raghavendra and Weitz suffers from a severe limitation, namely it is not clear which restrictions on combinatorial problems can guarantee an efficient computation of the IMPdsubscriptIMP𝑑\\textsc{IMP}_{d} proofs for combinatorial ideals. The Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) provides a general framework for a\nwide range of combinatorial problems, where we are given a set of variables and a set of constraints, and we have to decide whether the variables can be assigned values that satisfy the constraints.\nThere are useful connections between the IMPdsubscriptIMP𝑑\\textsc{IMP}_{d} and the CSP: for example a CSP instance 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is unsatisfiable if and only if 1∈I𝒞1subscriptI𝒞1\\in\\emph{{I}}_{\\mathcal{C}}.\nIt follows that the CSP is just the special case of the IMPdsubscriptIMP𝑑\\textsc{IMP}_{d} with d=0𝑑0d=0 (see Section 2.3 for more details on Ideal-CSP correspondence).\nRestrictions on CSPs, called CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma), in which the type of constraints is limited to relations from a set ΓΓ\\Gamma, have been successfully applied to study the computational complexity classification (and other algorithmic properties) of CSPs (see  for an excellent survey). Motivated by the aforementioned issue of Raghavendra and Weitz criterion, Mastrolilli  initiated a systematic study of the IMPdsubscriptIMP𝑑\\textsc{IMP}_{d} tractability for combinatorial ideals of the form IMPd​(Γ)subscriptIMP𝑑Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma) arising from combinatorial problems from CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma) for a set of relations ΓΓ\\Gamma over the Boolean domain.\nThe classic dichotomy result of Schaefer 6 gives the complexity of CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma) (and therefore of IMP0​(Γ)subscriptIMP0Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{0}(\\Gamma)) for the Boolean domain:\nCSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma) is solvable in polynomial time if all constraints are closed under one of six polymorphisms (majority, minority, MIN, MAX, constant 0 and constant 1), else it is NP-complete.\nMastrolilli  claimed a dichotomy result for the IMPd​(Γ)subscriptIMP𝑑Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma) for the Boolean domain: for any constant d≥1𝑑1d\\geq 1, the IMPd​(Γ)subscriptIMP𝑑Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma) of Boolean combinatorial ideals is solvable in polynomial time if all constraints are closed under one of four polymorphisms (majority, minority, MIN, MAX), else it is coNP-complete.\nIn , it is shown that IMPd​(Γ)subscriptIMP𝑑Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma) is polynomial time solvable for three polymorphisms (majority, MIN, MAX), and moreover ideal membership proofs can be efficiently found too.\nWhereas for the ternary minority polymorphism it was incorrectly declared to have been resolved by a previous result333This was pointed out by Andrei Bulatov, Akbar Rafiey and Stanislav Živný.. It was mistakenly assumed in  that computing the (mod 2) Gröbner basis in lexicographic order was sufficient to solve the IMPdsubscriptIMP𝑑\\textsc{IMP}_{d} problem in polynomial time, but the issue is that we require polynomials to be over ℚℚ\\mathbb{Q} and not GF​(2)GF2\\textrm{GF}(2). We address these issues in this paper and, therefore establish the full dichotomy result claimed in  (see [ref]28 for an updated version of the paper). To ensure efficiency of the IMPd​(Γ)subscriptIMP𝑑Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma) for the ternary minority polymorphism, it is sufficient to compute a d𝑑d-truncated Gröbner basis in the graded lexicographic order (see Definitions 2.24 and 2.1 for more details).\nThis is achieved by first showing that we can easily find a Gröbner basis in the lexicographic order for the combinatorial ideal. Since polynomials in this Gröbner basis can have degrees up to n𝑛n, we show how this basis can be converted to a d𝑑d-truncated Gröbner basis in the graded lexicographic order in polynomial time, whose polynomials have degrees up to d𝑑d and coefficients of constant size. This efficiently solves IMPd​(Γ)subscriptIMP𝑑Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma) for combinatorial ideals whose constraints are over a language ΓΓ\\Gamma closed under the minority polymorphism. Together with the results in  [ref]28, our result allows us to identify the tractability of the Boolean IMPd​(Γ)subscriptIMP𝑑Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma).\nThus the following summarizes our first result of this paper: Let ΓΓ\\Gamma be a constraint language over the Boolean domain that is closed under the minority polymorphism. For each instance 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} of CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma),\nthe d𝑑d-truncated reduced Gröbner basis in the graded lexicographic monomial ordering of the combinatorial ideal I𝒞subscriptI𝒞\\emph{{I}}_{\\mathcal{C}} can be computed in nO​(d)superscript𝑛𝑂𝑑n^{O(d)} time. If ΓΓ\\Gamma is closed under the minority polymorphism, then the ideal membership proofs for IMPd​(Γ)subscriptIMP𝑑Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma) over the Boolean domain can be computed in polynomial time for d=O​(1)𝑑𝑂1d=O(1). After the appearance of a preliminary version of this paper , Bulatov and Rafiey [ref]12 obtained exciting results.\nFor a finite domain D={0,1,…,p−1}𝐷01…𝑝1D=\\{0,1,\\dots,p-1\\} with prime p𝑝p elements, they consider the affine polymorphism ⊗:D3→D\\otimes:D^{3}\\rightarrow D defined as ⊗(a,b,c)=a−b+c(modp)\\otimes(a,b,c)=a-b+c\\ (\\mathrm{mod}\\ p) (this generalizes the Boolean minority operation). By building on our approach, they prove that a d𝑑d-truncated Gröbner basis can be computed in time nO​(d)superscript𝑛𝑂𝑑n^{O(d)} for any fixed prime p𝑝p. They then generalized the result to IMPs over languages invariant under affine operations of arbitrary finite Abelian groups  . In  , we began the generalization of CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma) (viz. IMP0​(Γ)subscriptIMP0Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{0}(\\Gamma)) by working on the corresponding IMPd​(Γ)subscriptIMP𝑑Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma) for any d=O​(1)𝑑𝑂1d=O(1) in the three-element domain, which expands the known set of tractable IMPdsubscriptIMP𝑑\\textsc{IMP}_{d} cases by providing a suitable class of combinatorial problems. We considered problems constrained under the dual discriminator polymorphism and proved that we can find the reduced Gröbner basis of the corresponding combinatorial ideal in polynomial time. This ensures that we can check if any degree d𝑑d polynomial belongs to the combinatorial ideal or not in polynomial time, and provide proof of membership if it does.\nAmong the results obtained in [ref]12, the authors show that the IMPdsubscriptIMP𝑑\\textsc{IMP}_{d} is solvable in polynomial time for any finite domain for problems constrained under the dual discriminator. This was done by eliminating permutation constraints in some sense through a preprocessing step and converting an instance 𝒞=(X,D,C)𝒞𝑋𝐷𝐶\\mathcal{C}=(X,D,C) for CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma) (where X𝑋X is a set of variables and C𝐶C is a set of constraints over ΓΓ\\Gamma with variables from X𝑋X, see Definition 2.8 for notation) to an instance 𝒞′=(X′,D,C′)superscript𝒞′superscript𝑋′𝐷superscript𝐶′\\mathcal{C}^{\\prime}=(X^{\\prime},D,C^{\\prime}) where X′⊆Xsuperscript𝑋′𝑋X^{\\prime}\\subseteq X and C′⊆Csuperscript𝐶′𝐶C^{\\prime}\\subseteq C.\nMoreover, a polynomial f​(X)𝑓𝑋f(X) was converted to a polynomial f′​(X′)superscript𝑓′superscript𝑋′f^{\\prime}(X^{\\prime}) such that f∈I𝒞𝑓subscriptI𝒞f\\in\\emph{{I}}_{\\mathcal{C}} if and only if f′∈I𝒞′superscript𝑓′subscriptIsuperscript𝒞′f^{\\prime}\\in\\emph{{I}}_{\\mathcal{C}^{\\prime}}. They calculated a Gröbner basis of I𝒞′subscript𝐼superscript𝒞′I_{\\mathcal{C}^{\\prime}} in polynomial time, which considered the remaining constraints. This gives a proof of membership of f′superscript𝑓′f^{\\prime} in I𝒞′subscript𝐼superscript𝒞′I_{\\mathcal{C}^{\\prime}} if it does belong to the ideal, but it was not yet known as to how to recover the proof of membership for f𝑓f in I𝒞subscriptI𝒞\\emph{{I}}_{\\mathcal{C}}. Meanwhile, our results in   give a proof of membership, but are only constrained to a 3-element domain. In this paper, we compute a Gröbner basis for the entire combinatorial ideal over a finite domain by showing that a Gröbner basis of the ideal associated with permutation constraints can also be calculated in polynomial time. We forego the pre-processing step of [ref]12, include the permutation constraints and directly calculate a Gröbner basis of I𝒞subscriptI𝒞\\emph{{I}}_{\\mathcal{C}}. The set of polynomials that the elements of the Gröbner basis can come from is polynomial in size, and hence we show that a proof of membership can also be calculated in polynomial time as required in 5.\nThe following summarizes the second result of this paper:\n Let ΓΓ\\Gamma be a constraint language over a finite domain D𝐷D that is closed under the dual discriminator polymorphism.\nFor each instance 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} of CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma), a Gröbner basis in the graded lexicographic monomial ordering of the combinatorial ideal I𝒞subscriptI𝒞\\emph{{I}}_{\\mathcal{C}} can be computed in time polynomial in the number of variables. Polynomials in this basis have degrees at most |D|!𝐷|D|!. If ΓΓ\\Gamma is closed under the dual discriminator polymorphism, then membership proofs for IMPd​(Γ)subscriptIMP𝑑Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma) over a finite domain can be computed in polynomial time. After the conference version of this paper , Bulatov and Rafiey have updated their results  to show that a d𝑑d-truncated Gröbner basis can be obtained for several polymorphisms, including the dual discriminator. Although their approach is more versatile it does not show that a full Gröbner basis can be obtained in nO​(|D|!)superscript𝑛𝑂𝐷n^{O(|D|!)} time and has polynomial size independent of d𝑑d. The study of CSP-related IMPs is in its early stages. The results obtained in this paper are steps towards the long-term and challenging goal of extending the celebrated dichotomy results of CSP​(Γ)CSPΓ\\textsc{CSP}(\\Gamma) for finite domain  1 to IMPd​(Γ)subscriptIMP𝑑Γ\\textsc{IMP}_{d}(\\Gamma). This would provide a complete CSP-related characterization of when the IMP tractability criterion is applicable. To make the paper self-contained, some essential background and standard (according to the book ) Gröbner basis notations can be found in the following section.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: is that we require polynomials to be over ℚℚ\\mathbb{Q} and not GF​(2)GF2\\textrm{GF}(2).
