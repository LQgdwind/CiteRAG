      "content": "Paper Title: STITCH: Surface reconstrucTion using Implicit neural representations with Topology Constraints and persistent Homology\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTraditional methods such as Voronoi diagrams [ref]2 and Delaunay triangulations  2 were initially developed for generating a triangular mesh from points; however, these methods are not robust to noise. Implicit methods handle noise in the data much better than pure geometric approaches. For example, the most common approach—Poisson surface reconstruction —finds a global indicator function based on the estimate of a local tangent plane [ref]29. Carr et al.  used radial basis functions at the center of the point coordinates to compute an implicit function. The level-set method has also been used to fit an implicit surface to a point cloud without normals . Leveraging the generalized function approximation nature of neural networks has recently allowed the replacement of the implicit function with a neural network under the class of Implicit Neural Representations   4 . Specifically, if the implicit function is the distance field, it allows for the use of physics-informed methods that solve the Eikonal equation using a boundary value problem for surface reconstruction 5 . This approach guides the distance function to have a value of zero on the underlying surface represented by the point cloud. Neural occupancy functions have also been used for surface reconstruction 8. By extension, implicit representations have also been used for representing 3D scenes 0 3 0 1. Often, mesh extraction from these approaches is done via the well-known marching-cubes algorithm 6, and meshes for point clouds with thin and sharp features are not guaranteed to be manifold meshes. None of the conventional neural implicit approaches tackle maintaining topological accuracy while capturing thin and sharp features commonly found in plants, chairs, and the human body.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Traditional methods such as Voronoi diagrams [ref]2 and Delaunay triangulations  2 were initially developed for generating a triangular mesh from points; however, these methods are not robust to noise.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
