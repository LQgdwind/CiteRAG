      "content": "Paper Title: Comparative evaluation of CNN architectures for Image Caption Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section we describe the experimental details and the results.\nWe have evaluated Squeezenet [ref]31, Shufflenet [ref]32, Mobilenet , MnasNet , ResNet [ref]13, GoogLeNet , DenseNet , Inceptionv4 , AlexNet , DPN (Dual Path Network) , ResNext , SeNet , PolyNet , WideResNet , VGG , NASNetLarge  and InceptionResNetv2  CNN models. Out of these we have evaluated five versions of ResNet, viz., Resnet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, Resnet101, Resnet152, four versions of DenseNet, viz., Densenet121, Densenet169, DenseNet201 and Densenet161 and four versions of VGG, viz., VGG-11, VGG-13, VGG-16 and VGG-19 which are similar in architecture but differ widely in terms of number of parameters and also in terms of accuracy and error rates on Object Recognition task with ImageNet dataset. We have evaluated the performance using BLEU, METEOR, CIDER, ROUGE-L and SPICE metrics that were recommended in MSCOCO Image caption Evaluation task . The evaluation results are provided in Tables I and II for ’CNN+LSTM’ and ’CNN+LSTM+Attention’ methods respectively. In addition we have provided some examples of generated captions in Tables III and IV for both the methods. We have used Flickr8k  dataset which contains around 8000 images with 5 reference captions each. Out of the 8000 images, around 1000 are earmarked for validation set, around 1000 are meant for test set and the remaining are for training set. We can make following observations from the results: For example, there is a variation of around 4 to 5 points in the evaluation metrics between the best and worst performing models in both Tables I and II. In addition, the performance of a decoder framework which employs additional methods of guidance (such as attention) but uses a lower performing encoder can be worse than simpler methods which use better performing CNN encoder. For example, the best performing model using CNN+LSTM method (Table I) have better performance than lower performing models using CNN+LSTM+Attention method (Table II). Although different variants of the same model (such as ResNet, Densenet and VGG) differ greatly with respect to the number of parameters, they generate image captioning performances which differ only by around 1 point on most evaluation metrics. ResNet18, being the smallest model in terms of number of parameters (among ResNet based CNNs) performs competitively as compared to the larger ResNet variants which have many times more parameters. We also observe that DenseNet121 and VGG-11 being the smallest models among DenseNet and VGG models, respectively, outperform other DenseNet and VGG based CNNs in evaluation scores along certain metrics. Also the different variants of ResNet [ref]13, VGG  and DenseNet  architectures differ greatly in terms of Top-5 error on Object Detection task when evaluated with Imagenet dataset. However, that difference does not translate to similar difference in performance in Image captioning task. For each image, most models generate reasonable captions but there is a great variation in the caption sentences generated with different models. In some cases, captions generated with different models describe different portions of the image and sometimes some models focus on a certain object in the image instead of providing a general overview of the scene. In some cases, models do not recognize certain objects in the image. In particular, we have observed many cases of incorrect gender identification which points out to possible statistical bias in the dataset towards a particular gender in a certain context. Thus we can conclude that choice of CNN for the encoder significantly influences the performance of the model. In addition to the general observations, we are able to deduce the following specific observations about the choice of CNN: ResNet[ref]13 and DenseNet CNN architectures are well suited to Image caption generation and generate better results while having a lower model complexity than other architectures.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: In this section we describe the experimental details and the results.\nWe have evaluated Squeezenet [ref]31, Shufflenet [ref]32, Mobilenet , MnasNet , ResNet [ref]13, GoogLeNet , DenseNet , Inceptionv4 , AlexNet , DPN (Dual Path Network) , ResNext , SeNet , PolyNet , WideResNet , VGG , NASNetLarge\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
