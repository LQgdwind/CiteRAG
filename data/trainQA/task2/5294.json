      "content": "Paper Title: Uncertainty-Aware Performance Prediction for Highly Configurable Software Systems via Bayesian Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo model the epistemic uncertainty, Bayesian inference techniques aim to generate the posterior probability distribution p​(ω|𝒟t​r)𝑝conditional𝜔subscript𝒟𝑡𝑟p(\\omega|\\mathcal{D}_{tr}) of the prediction model’s parameters, instead of only providing one single estimate ω^^𝜔\\hat{\\omega}. This parameter probability distribution indicates the probability of a parameter ω𝜔\\omega being the true parameter. Given the parameter posterior probability distribution p​(ω|𝒟t​r)𝑝conditional𝜔subscript𝒟𝑡𝑟p(\\omega|\\mathcal{D}_{tr}), for any new input data x′superscriptx′\\textbf{x}^{\\prime}, we can compute the posterior probability distribution of f​(x′)𝑓superscriptx′f(\\textbf{x}^{\\prime}), p​(f​(x′)|𝒟t​r)𝑝conditional𝑓superscriptx′subscript𝒟𝑡𝑟p(f(\\textbf{x}^{\\prime})|\\mathcal{D}_{tr}), as, where fω​(x′)subscript𝑓𝜔superscriptx′f_{\\omega}(\\textbf{x}^{\\prime}) represents the output of the prediction model fωsubscript𝑓𝜔f_{\\omega} w.r.t. the input data x′superscriptx′\\textbf{x}^{\\prime}. With the posterior distribution p​(f​(x′)|𝒟t​r)𝑝conditional𝑓superscriptx′subscript𝒟𝑡𝑟p(f(\\textbf{x}^{\\prime})|\\mathcal{D}_{tr}), the scalar prediction of f​(x′)𝑓superscriptx′f(\\textbf{x}^{\\prime}) can be computed as 𝔼​[f​(x′)]=∫f​(x′)​p​(f​(x′)|𝒟t​r)​d​f​(x′)𝔼delimited-[]𝑓superscriptx′𝑓superscriptx′𝑝conditional𝑓superscriptx′subscript𝒟𝑡𝑟d𝑓superscriptx′\\mathbb{E}[f(\\textbf{x}^{\\prime})]=\\int f(\\textbf{x}^{\\prime})p(f(\\textbf{x}^{\\prime})|\\mathcal{D}_{tr})\\text{d}f(\\textbf{x}^{\\prime}) where 𝔼𝔼\\mathbb{E} denotes the expectation operator. If the posterior probability distribution p​(f​(x′)|𝒟t​r)𝑝conditional𝑓superscriptx′subscript𝒟𝑡𝑟p(f(\\textbf{x}^{\\prime})|\\mathcal{D}_{tr}) is Gaussian, the ρ𝜌\\rho% confidence interval (0≤ρ≤1000𝜌1000\\leq\\rho\\leq 100) of f​(x′)𝑓superscriptx′f(\\textbf{x}^{\\prime}) can be computed as 𝔼​[f​(x′)]±z​(ρ)​𝕊​𝔻​[f​(x′)]plus-or-minus𝔼delimited-[]𝑓superscriptx′𝑧𝜌𝕊𝔻delimited-[]𝑓superscriptx′\\mathbb{E}[f(\\textbf{x}^{\\prime})]\\pm z(\\rho)\\mathbb{SD}[f(\\textbf{x}^{\\prime})] where 𝕊​𝔻𝕊𝔻\\mathbb{SD} denotes the standard deviation operator, i.e., 𝕊​𝔻​[f​(x′)]=∫(f​(x′)−𝔼​[f​(x′)])2​p​(f​(x′)|𝒟t​r)​d​f​(x′)𝕊𝔻delimited-[]𝑓superscriptx′superscript𝑓superscriptx′𝔼delimited-[]𝑓superscriptx′2𝑝conditional𝑓superscriptx′subscript𝒟𝑡𝑟d𝑓superscriptx′\\mathbb{SD}[f(\\textbf{x}^{\\prime})]=\\sqrt{\\int(f(\\textbf{x}^{\\prime})-\\mathbb{E}[f(\\textbf{x}^{\\prime})])^{2}p(f(\\textbf{x}^{\\prime})|\\mathcal{D}_{tr})\\text{d}f(\\textbf{x}^{\\prime})}, and z​(ρ)𝑧𝜌z(\\rho) denotes the z-score of the confidence level ρ𝜌\\rho. Bayesian inference techniques have been shown to be effective in generating posterior probability distribution of the prediction model’s parameters, and thus effective in generating the scalar predictions and confidence intervals (i.e., uncertainty estimates) for the outputs [ref]14 [ref]15   . In general, Bayesian inference techniques could be applied to different parametric prediction models including neural network and linear regression. There are a number of well-known Bayesian inference techniques such as the Variational Inference (VI) method , Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) , Monte Carlo Dropout [ref]15, Ensemble [ref]36. Whilst the VI and MCMC techniques are traditional Bayesian inference techniques that can be applied to any parametric prediction models, the Monte Carlo Dropout and Ensemble techniques are generally applied to deep neural networks. When the prediction model is a neural network, then the network obtained after the Bayesian inference process is called a Bayesian neural network (BNN)   [ref]14. In this work, we use the feedforward neural network (FNN) as the architecture of the prediction model as it has been shown that FNNs can accurately represent complex functions     including the performance of configurable software systems . To perform Bayesian inference on the FNN to obtain a BNN, we employ the VI method  due to its effectiveness [ref]14 . The key idea of the VI method is to consider the Bayesian inference problem as an optimization problem, and solve this optimization problem over a family of tractable distributions to find a distribution that is closest to the true posterior distribution p​(ω|𝒟t​r)𝑝conditional𝜔subscript𝒟𝑡𝑟p(\\omega|\\mathcal{D}_{tr}). For the configurable software performance prediction problem, as the training data is limited, the accuracy of the BNNs obtained by the VI method may not be optimal. We therefore propose to use the Ensemble method to generate and combine multiples BNNs together as the Ensemble method is well known to be able to enhance individual model’s accuracy [ref]36. To construct the ensemble, we divide the training data into K𝐾K folds (K>1𝐾1K>1), and train a BNN using data in K−1𝐾1K-1 folds with the VI method. We thus obtain an ensemble of K𝐾K BNNs trained on different data subsets of the training data. Finally, it has been widely recognized that for a configurable software system, its performance depends only on a limited number of configuration options and their interactions   . Previous approaches    have incorporated this knowledge into the modeling process by making the prediction model’s parameters to be sparse. In this work, we also aim to train sparse BNNs. Similar to , for each BNN in the ensemble, we make the parameters of the BNN’s first layer sparse by specifying the prior distribution of this layer’s parameters to be a Laplace distribution. It has been shown that specifying a Laplace prior distribution over the layer’s parameters is equivalent to apply the L1 regularization to the layer , and thus, resulting in a sparse layer. To control the sparsity level of the BNN, we set the scale parameter of the Laplace distribution as a hyperparameter to be tuned. Now, we have constructed an ensemble of sparse BNNs that can incorporate the epistemic uncertainty. In the next section, we describe how to model the aleatoric uncertainty.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: probability distribution of the prediction model’s parameters, and thus effective in generating the scalar predictions and confidence intervals (i.e., uncertainty estimates) for the outputs [ref]14 [ref]15   .
