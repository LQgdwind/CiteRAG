      "content": "Paper Title: Cross-Modal Knowledge Reasoning for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe Visual Question Answering (VQA) task requires the agent to answer a question in natural language according to the visual content in an image, which demands for comprehending and reasoning about both visual and textual information.\nThe typical solutions for VQA are based on the CNN-RNN architecture [ref]9 that coarsely fuses the global visual and textual features as clues to predict the answer. For better combining textual information with visual information, bilinear pooling approaches [ref]10 [ref]11 have been proposed to fuse multimodal features in fine-grained mode. However, the above approaches leverage all the information in the image and question, which may introduce redundant or noisy information to the prediction stage.\nTo alleviate this problem, various attention mechanisms have been exploited in VQA tasks   to highlight visual objects that are relevant to the question.\n  introduced a bottom-up and top-down attention mechanism to learn the attention on candidate objects rather than spatial grids.\nHowever, they treat objects in an image independently and ignore their informative relationships. Humans’ ability of combinatorial generalization highly depends on the mechanisms of reasoning over relationships.\nConsistent with such idea, there is an emerging trend to depict objects and visual relationships in an image by graph structure to support reasoning in VQA. One kind of approaches performs one-step relational reasoning to infer the answer.  proposed a Relation Network (RN) to model all the implicit relationships among objects in the image by multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). Then, the relationships are summed and fed into other MLPs to predict the answer. This approach brings high computational cost and makes it hard to perform multi-step reasoning.  refined the relationships by a ranking strategy and lowered the computational complexity. However, a large number of compound questions require multi-step reasoning. To this end,  proposed multi-step attention to reason over both original objects and new compound objects and infer the answer progressively. Additionally,  transformed both the visual and textual moldalities into concept-based graph representations and performed sequential reasoning over the graph by the neural state machine. Furthermore,  exploited semantic captions to further enrich the graph-based representations for multi-step reasoning. Reasoning approaches in the above work are always on visual and textual features, which cannot be extended to involve external knowledge.\nTo go one step further, our model pays attention to not only original input features but also external knowledge\nduring progressive reasoning.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: to the visual content in an image, which demands for comprehending and reasoning about both visual and textual information.\nThe typical solutions for VQA are based on the CNN-RNN architecture [ref]9 that coarsely fuses the global visual and textual features as clues to predict the answer.
