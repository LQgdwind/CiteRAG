      "content": "Paper Title: Tree Independence Number IV. Even-hole-free Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe give here the main ideas of the proof. We will not concern ourselves with the exponent of log⁡n𝑛\\log n in our bound and simply show that the tree independence number of G𝐺G is polylogarithmic in n𝑛n.\nThe high level scaffolding of the proof is quite similar to the proof of  that Ktsubscript𝐾𝑡K_{t}-free even-hole-free graphs have logarithmic treewidth. However most of the individual high level pieces of the proof differ substantially from the corresponding step in  and require significant new ideas. The proof of  that every Ktsubscript𝐾𝑡K_{t}-free graph has treewidth O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) goes as follows: first it is proved that even-hole-free graphs admit “dominated balanced separators”. In particular there exists a constant c𝑐c such that every even-hole-free graph contains a vertex set S𝑆S of size at most c𝑐c such that every connected component of G−N​[S]𝐺𝑁delimited-[]𝑆G-N[S] has at most n/2𝑛2n/2 vertices. This fact is then used to show that, in order to obtain the treewidth bound, it is sufficient to show that every pair of non-adjacent vertices a𝑎a, b𝑏b in a Ktsubscript𝐾𝑡K_{t}-free even-hole free graph can be separated from each other by a set of size at most ct​log⁡nsubscript𝑐𝑡𝑛c_{t}\\log n for a constant ctsubscript𝑐𝑡c_{t} depending only on t𝑡t. The most technical part of the argument is then to show the existence of such small a𝑎a-b𝑏b separators. The first step of the proof of , that even-hole-free graphs admit dominated balanced separators, does not use the assumption that G𝐺G is Ktsubscript𝐾𝑡K_{t}-free and hence we can use it here.\nUsing the dominated balanced separator bound we then show an analog of the second step of  tailored to tree independence number rather than treewidth: we show that in order to obtain the tree independence number bound, it is sufficient to prove that every pair of non-adjacent vertices a𝑎a, b𝑏b in an even-hole-free graph can be separated from each other by a set with independence number O​(log⁡nO​(1))𝑂superscript𝑛𝑂1O(\\log n^{O(1)}).\nHere we cannot re-use the proof from  because that proof crucially uses the assumption that G𝐺G is Ktsubscript𝐾𝑡K_{t}-free. However we can directly apply a similar step from . Thus, “all” that remains is to prove the following statement: There exists a constant c𝑐c with the following property. Let G𝐺G be an even-hole-free graph with |V​(G)|=n𝑉𝐺𝑛|V(G)|=n, and let a,b∈V​(G)𝑎𝑏𝑉𝐺a,b\\in V(G) be non-adjacent. Then there is a set X⊆V​(G)∖{a,b}𝑋𝑉𝐺𝑎𝑏X\\subseteq V(G)\\setminus\\{a,b\\} with κ​(X)≤c​log8⁡n𝜅𝑋𝑐superscript8𝑛\\kappa(X)\\leq c\\log^{8}n and such that every component of G∖X𝐺𝑋G\\setminus X contains at most one of a,b𝑎𝑏a,b. In Theorem 3.1, the clique cover number κ𝜅\\kappa of the separator X𝑋X is bounded rather than the independence number α𝛼\\alpha because that is what naturally comes out of the proof. Obtaining a separator X𝑋X with polylogarithmic independence number would also have been sufficient. Let us now not worry too much about the exponent 888 in the statement of Theorem 3.1, and simply aim for a polylogarithmic bound on κ𝜅\\kappa. Towards this goal we employ a recent tool of Korchemna et al. [ref]37, who provide a “max flow-min cut” like theorem for clique separators. Applying this theorem to even-hole-free graphs (and using that even-hole-free graphs are K2,2subscript𝐾22K_{2,2}-free and therefore have only polynomially many maximal cliques ) we get one of two outcomes. Either we get an a𝑎a-b𝑏b separator X𝑋X with a polylogaritmic upper bound on κ​(X)𝜅𝑋\\kappa(X), this is the desired outcome, or we get a set of f𝑓f paths P1,…,Pfsubscript𝑃1…subscript𝑃𝑓P_{1},\\ldots,P_{f} from a𝑎a to b𝑏b such that no clique of G−{a,b}𝐺𝑎𝑏G-\\{a,b\\} intersects more than O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) of the paths. Here f𝑓f can be chosen to be an arbitrarily large polylogarithmic function of n𝑛n (and the larger we choose f𝑓f, the worse bound we get on κ​(X)𝜅𝑋\\kappa(X)). Observe that the graph G′superscript𝐺′G^{\\prime} induced by all of these a𝑎a-b𝑏b paths P1,…,Pfsubscript𝑃1…subscript𝑃𝑓P_{1},\\ldots,P_{f} is Ktsubscript𝐾𝑡K_{t}-free, where t=O​(log⁡n)𝑡𝑂𝑛t=O(\\log n). Indeed, every vertex of a clique K𝐾K in G′superscript𝐺′G^{\\prime} must be on some a𝑎a-b𝑏b path (by the definition of G′superscript𝐺′G^{\\prime}), and no path can contain more than 222 vertices of K𝐾K (since the path is induced), so K𝐾K must intersect at least |K|/2𝐾2|K|/2 paths. It follows that G′superscript𝐺′G^{\\prime} is Ktsubscript𝐾𝑡K_{t}-free where t=O​(log⁡n)𝑡𝑂𝑛t=O(\\log n). If only the constant ctsubscript𝑐𝑡c_{t} in the ct​log⁡nsubscript𝑐𝑡𝑛c_{t}\\log n bound on the size of an a𝑎a-b𝑏b separator from  depended polynomially on t𝑡t we would be done! Indeed, we could then have chosen f𝑓f to be so large that f≥(ct⋅log⁡n)⋅log2⁡n𝑓⋅⋅subscript𝑐𝑡𝑛superscript2𝑛f\\geq(c_{t}\\cdot\\log n)\\cdot\\log^{2}n, and get an a𝑎a-b𝑏b separator X𝑋X in G′superscript𝐺′G^{\\prime} of size at most ct⋅log⁡n⋅subscript𝑐𝑡𝑛c_{t}\\cdot\\log n. But then some vertex of X𝑋X intersects at least log2⁡nsuperscript2𝑛\\log^{2}n of the paths, contradicting that no clique intersects more than O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) of them. Unfortunately the constant ctsubscript𝑐𝑡c_{t} in the proof of  does not depend polynomially on t𝑡t, and it does not look like an easy task to improve the dependence to a polynomial in t𝑡t. However, the argument above works out just fine even if ctsubscript𝑐𝑡c_{t} is not a constant but rather a polynomial in t𝑡t and log⁡n𝑛\\log n. Hence, in order to prove Theorem 3.1 it is sufficient to prove that, for every Ktsubscript𝐾𝑡K_{t}-free graph, every pair a,b𝑎𝑏a,b of vertices can be separated by a set X𝑋X of size polynomial in t𝑡t and log⁡n𝑛\\log n. This is precisely the approach that we take, this is the most involved part of our arguments.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: now not worry too much about the exponent 888 in the statement of Theorem 3.1, and simply aim for a polylogarithmic bound on κ𝜅\\kappa.
