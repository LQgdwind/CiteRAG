      "content": "Paper Title: Exact Thresholds for Noisy Non-Adaptive Group Testing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTwo important defining features of the group testing problem are probabilistic vs.¬†combinatorial (i.e., whether the recovery guarantee is high-probability or definite) and non-adaptive vs.¬†adaptive (i.e., whether or not the tests may be designed sequentially based on previous outcomes). We will mainly summarize existing work for the probabilistic non-adaptive setting with sublinear sparsity (i.e., k=Œò‚Äã(nŒ∏)ùëòŒòsuperscriptùëõùúÉk=\\Theta(n^{\\theta}) for some Œ∏‚àà(0,1)ùúÉ01\\theta\\in(0,1)), since this is the focus of our work. Noiseless group testing. Some of the main developments in the theory of noiseless probabilistic group testing in the sublinear regime are outlined as follows: Information-theoretic characterization of the very sparse regime k=O‚Äã(1)ùëòùëÇ1k=O(1) ; Initial algorithmic bounds via the simple Combinatorial Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (COMP) algorithm with Bernoulli designs ; Improved algorithmic bounds via the more sophisticated (but still simple) Definite Defectives (DD) algorithm with Bernoulli designs [ref]5; Precise information-theoretic bounds for Bernoulli designs [ref]39; Ensemble tightness111By ensemble tightness, we mean establishing that the bounds derived are the best possible for the specific random design considered, implying an exact threshold. This leaves open the possibility that other designs may be better. of these information-theoretic bounds for Bernoulli designs ; Improved algorithmic bounds for COMP and DD via the near-constant weight design ; Precise information-theoretic bounds for the near-constant weight design, including a proof of their ensemble tightness [ref]15; A proof that the bounds in the preceding dot point are optimal among all designs, and a computationally efficient method for attaining this optimal threshold . These results for the noiseless setting are summarized in Figure 1 (Left). We also briefly note that computational considerations for the standard (non spatially coupled) random designs were studied in  , with evidence both for and against the prospect of a statistical-computational gap. Noisy group testing. In the noisy setting (with the symmetric noise model (1)), several counterparts to the above developments are available, but the list is significantly less complete: Regarding #1, the very sparse regime k=O‚Äã(1)ùëòùëÇ1k=O(1) has long been well-understood . Regarding #2, algorithmic bounds for COMP-like algorithms were established in  0. As an attempt towards #4, information-theoretic upper bounds were established in 1, but with tightness only shown for very small values of Œ∏ùúÉ\\theta. Regarding #3, and #6, bounds were derived for a noisy DD-like algorithm in 1 for the Bernoulli design, and in  for the near-constant weight design. Exact thresholds were established in certain (dense) regimes for one-sided noise models, but not for the more commonly-considered symmetric noise model. These existing results are summarized in Figure 1 (Right). We will outline our contributions below, but they can be succinctly summarized as follows: In particular, we complete item #4 (precise-information-theoretic bounds; Bernoulli) which was only partially commenced in [ref]39, and we complete items #5 (ensemble tightness; Bernoulli) and #7 (counterparts for the near-constant weight design), which have not been attempted before. Other settings. We only provide a brief summary of other aspects of group testing that are less relevant to the present paper: For adaptive designs, near-optimal algorithms have long been known for the noiseless setting , and analogs were recently derived for the noisy setting  3 and shown to significantly improve over the best non-adaptive results in denser (high Œ∏ùúÉ\\theta) regimes. We note that even following the improved non-adaptive bounds we derive in the present paper, significant improvements via adaptivity still remain. Combinatorial non-adaptive group testing is a widely-studied problem    , and has also been studied under adversarial noise . Under the condition of exact recovery, the stricter recovery criterion (namely, zero probability of error) increases the dependence on kùëòk from linear to quadratic, meaning that it comes at a significant price in the number of tests. To our knowledge, precise constant factors have not been sought in this line of works. If the exact recovery crtierion (2) is relaxed to approximate recovery, where Œ±‚Äãkùõºùëò\\alpha k false positives and false negatives are allowed in the reconstruction for some Œ±>0ùõº0\\alpha>0, then the study of noisy (and noiseless) probabilistic group testing becomes much simpler, with [ref]39 giving upper and lower bounds that match in the limit of small Œ±ùõº\\alpha. (With reference to the bound (4) below, the ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù second term disappears, and only the ‚Äúsimple‚Äù first term remains.) Analogous findings for the near-constant weight design can be inferred from [17, Sec.¬†5], and related studies of ‚Äúall-or-nothing‚Äù phase transitions in group testing can be found in 4 .\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: Matching Pursuit (COMP) algorithm with Bernoulli designs ; Improved algorithmic bounds via the more sophisticated (but still simple) Definite Defectives (DD) algorithm with Bernoulli designs [ref]5; Precise information-theoretic bounds for Bernoulli designs [ref]39; Ensemble tightness111By ensemble tightness, we mean establishing that the bounds derived are the best possible for the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
