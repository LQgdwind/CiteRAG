Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Meuzz: Smart Seed Scheduling for Hybrid Fuzzing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFollowing the general fuzzing evaluation guideline, we choose 8 real-world benchmark programs commonly used by existing work     [ref]24.\nTable 1 shows the configurations used for fuzzing each program.\nAll experiments are conducted on AWS c5.18xlarge servers running Ubuntu 16.04 with 72 cores and 281 GB RAM.\nWithout explicitly mention, all tests run for 24 hours each by assigning three CPU cores to each fuzzer and are repeated at least 5 times; we report the average result with Mann-Whitney U-test. We compare Meuzz with the state-of-the-art grey-box fuzzers,\nsuch as AFL, AFLFast, and Angora[ref]24, as well\nas hybrid testing systems including QSYM and SAVIOR.\nThe seed selection modules of all these previous systems are based on heuristics.\nWe could not test Driller  on the chosen benchmarks because its\nconcolic execution engine fails to run them. Moreover, we test Vuzzer\n[ref]41 and T-Fuzz[ref]39 but we compare them with Meuzz in a\ndifferent way than we do with the other fuzzers. This separate comparison is\nbecause these two fuzzers do not\nsupport concurrent fuzzing. Due to\nthe space limit, we discuss our observations and show the results of their branch\ncoverage in Appendix C. For Meuzz, we consider three different\nconfigurations according to the learning process, namely Meuzz-OL, Meuzz-RF and Meuzz-EN, which refer to\nonline learning linear model, offline learning random forest model and the arithmetic average of the first two models’ utility predictions, respectively. Since Savior and QSYM need at least three CPU cores, we enforce this fuzzing setting to all the fuzzers to build a fair comparison environment.\nWe launch one master and two slaves for the grey-box fuzzers; and\none master, one slave, and one concolic execution engine for the hybrid fuzzers. To reduce the randomness of OS scheduling, we pin each component of the fuzzers on the specific core.\nBecause Meuzz and SAVIOR instrument the testing program with UBSAN,\nwe also apply this sanitizer to all other fuzzers, as enabling sanitizers is shown to\nimprove the fuzzer’s effectiveness for finding bugs.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: Following the general fuzzing evaluation guideline, we choose 8 real-world benchmark programs commonly used by existing work     [ref]24.\nTable 1 shows the configurations used for fuzzing each program.\nAll experiments are conducted on AWS c5.18xlarge servers running Ubuntu 16.04 with 72 cores and 281 GB RAM.\nWithout explicitly\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
