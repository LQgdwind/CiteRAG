      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Video Prediction from a Single Frame by Estimating 3D Dynamic Scene Structure\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe cast the problem of stochastic video prediction as drawing samples from a conditional generative model (Figure 1).\nWe use x0subscript𝑥0x_{0} to denote the initial frame that is provided as conditioning.\nTo define the conditional distribution P​(x1,…,xL|x0)𝑃subscript𝑥1…conditionalsubscript𝑥𝐿subscript𝑥0P(x_{1},\\,\\ldots,\\,x_{L}\\,|\\,x_{0}) on L𝐿L subsequent frames (x1,…,xL)≡x>0subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝐿subscript𝑥absent0(x_{1},\\,\\ldots,\\,x_{L})\\equiv x_{>0}, we introduce a latent variable z𝑧z that will capture all uncertainty about the future, i.e. embed all information that is not present in x0subscript𝑥0x_{0}.\nThis will include the camera and object motion, and the appearance of regions disoccluded by moving objects.\nThis leads to a probabilistic model of the form P​(x>0|x0)=P​(z)​P​(x>0|z,x0)𝑃conditionalsubscript𝑥absent0subscript𝑥0𝑃𝑧𝑃conditionalsubscript𝑥absent0𝑧subscript𝑥0P(x_{>0}\\,|\\,x_{0})=P(z)\\,P(x_{>0}\\,|\\,z,\\,x_{0}).\nAs is common [ref]21 [ref]38, we choose z𝑧z to be a multivariate standard Gaussian distribution, i.e. z∼𝒩​(𝟎,I)similar-to𝑧𝒩0𝐼z\\sim\\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0},\\,I).\nTo ensure the generated clip depicts a consistent scene,\nthe conditional distribution on future frames P​(x>0|z,x0)𝑃conditionalsubscript𝑥absent0𝑧subscript𝑥0P(x_{>0}\\,|\\,z,\\,x_{0}) is given by first mapping x0subscript𝑥0x_{0} and z𝑧z to a description 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} of a 4D scene, incorporating geometry, texture, segmentation, and motion (dashed box in Figure 1).\nThen, the frames xtsubscript𝑥𝑡x_{t} for t>0𝑡0t>0 are generated by rendering 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} at the relevant times t𝑡t, and finally adding Gaussian pixel noise to ensure the data likelihood is always defined.\nNote the contrast with earlier works    that predict x>0subscript𝑥absent0x_{>0} directly from x0subscript𝑥0x_{0} and z𝑧z, e.g. using a CNN, and without the intermediate representation 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} that ensures a consistent scene is shown. We first describe a recently-proposed static scene representation  and how it is rendered to pixels; we then extend it to give our 4D scene representation 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S}.\nNext, we discuss how our representation is conditioned on x0subscript𝑥0x_{0} and z𝑧z, to allow inferring it from a single frame and incorporating it into our probabilistic model.\nFinally, we describe how the overall model is trained end-to-end. Neural radiance fields (NeRFs)  represent a single static scene using a function F𝐹F that maps points p∈ℝ3𝑝superscriptℝ3p\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3} in the 3D space of the scene to a density ρ𝜌\\rho and an RGB color c∈ 𝑐superscript013c\\in[0,\\,1]^{3}.\nThe density ρ∈ℝ+𝜌superscriptℝ\\rho\\in\\mathbb{R}^{+} represents the differential probability that a light ray cast from the camera will terminate (i.e. hit some matter) at point p𝑝p; zero corresponds to free space, and large values to solid objects.\nIn practice F𝐹F is a densely-connected neural network, with p𝑝p preprocessed using the Fourier embedding method of .\nTo render the scene defined by F𝐹F, standard quadrature-based volume rendering techniques   , are used.\nSpecifically, to calculate the color C​(q)𝐶𝑞C(q) of the pixel at coordinate q𝑞q, we evaluate F𝐹F at K𝐾K points along the ray cast from q𝑞q into the scene through the camera lens, setting Here\nrksubscript𝑟𝑘r_{k} gives the k𝑘kth 3D sample point along the ray from q𝑞q, and δk=‖rk+1−rk‖subscript𝛿𝑘normsubscript𝑟𝑘1subscript𝑟𝑘\\delta_{k}=||r_{k+1}-r_{k}|| is the spacing between samples.\nIntuitively, Vksubscript𝑉𝑘V_{k} represents how visible the k𝑘kth sample is in spite of occlusion by nearer samples. We represent a 4D scene 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} as three parts: (i) the static scene geometry and appearance at t=0𝑡0t=0; (ii) its segmentation into J𝐽J different motion components; and (iii) a set of time-varying transformations Tt1​…​Jsuperscriptsubscript𝑇𝑡1…𝐽T_{t}^{1\\ldots J} capturing these components’ motion for t>0𝑡0t>0.\nIntuitively, each motion component is a region of 3D space in the scene, in which all the points are moving coherently.\nThe model is free to use motion components to represent individual moving objects (e.g. a car), comoving groups of objects (e.g. a convoy of cars), or the static background.\nThe transformation Ttjsuperscriptsubscript𝑇𝑡𝑗T_{t}^{j} defines how points in the initial scene belonging to component j𝑗j are mapped to their location in frame t𝑡t.\nTo implement this, we introduce a scene function, F​(p)=[ρ​(p),c​(p),ω​(p)]𝐹𝑝𝜌𝑝𝑐𝑝𝜔𝑝F(p)=[\\rho(p),c(p),\\omega(p)]; here ρ𝜌\\rho and c𝑐c are the density and color at point p𝑝p in the 3D scene corresponding to t=0𝑡0t=0, similar to above.\nIn order to capture the fact that different regions of the scene belong to different motion components, F𝐹F also outputs a vector ω∈ [ref]1J𝜔superscript01𝐽\\omega\\in[0,\\,1]^{J} of values indicating which of J𝐽J components each point belongs to; these are normalized by a softmax.\nIntuitively, if ω𝜔\\omega is one-hot with ωj​(p)=1subscript𝜔𝑗𝑝1\\omega_{j}(p)=1, then the point p𝑝p will transform according to Ttjsubscriptsuperscript𝑇𝑗𝑡T^{j}_{t}; if ω𝜔\\omega is not one-hot, then corresponding fractions of the density at p𝑝p will transform according to each Ttjsubscriptsuperscript𝑇𝑗𝑡T^{j}_{t}. Together, the scene function F𝐹F and component transformations Tt1​…​Jsuperscriptsubscript𝑇𝑡1…𝐽T_{t}^{1\\ldots J} define the distribution of density and color in all frames t=1​…​L𝑡1…𝐿t=1\\ldots L.\nTo render frame t𝑡t, we adapt (1) to our dynamic multiple-component setting.\nSuppose that the camera transformation (i.e. extrinsic matrix, representing its location and rotation) in frame t𝑡t is denoted by ΛtsubscriptΛ𝑡\\Lambda_{t}.\nWe calculate the density and color for point p𝑝p at time t𝑡t by applying the inverse of the component transformations, to find which location p0jsuperscriptsubscript𝑝0𝑗p_{0}^{j} in the initial scene would be transported to p𝑝p by the j𝑗jth component’s motion, i.e. p0j=(Ttj)−1​[p]superscriptsubscript𝑝0𝑗superscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝑇𝑡𝑗1delimited-[]𝑝p_{0}^{j}=(T_{t}^{j})^{-1}[p].\nCompared with (1), we must now evaluate F𝐹F once per motion component for each sample; this effectively defines one opacity per component, and we weight these according to ωjsubscript𝜔𝑗\\omega_{j}, before summing to give the combined density and color.\nTherefore, the expected color xt​(q)subscript𝑥𝑡𝑞x_{t}(q) of the pixel at coordinate q𝑞q in predicted frame xtsubscript𝑥𝑡x_{t} is given by where and Here rktsubscriptsuperscript𝑟𝑡𝑘r^{t}_{k} gives the k𝑘kth 3D sample point along the ray cast from the camera at pixel q𝑞q of frame t𝑡t; this has an implied dependence on the camera transformation ΛtsubscriptΛ𝑡\\Lambda_{t}.\nNote that ω𝜔\\omega weights the sample opacities αkjsuperscriptsubscript𝛼𝑘𝑗\\alpha_{k}^{j}, (i.e. is applied after integrating the densities) as these lie in   [ref]1.\nAlthough more intuitive, directly weighting the density ρ𝜌\\rho has no practical effect, as ρ𝜌\\rho is unbounded hence arbitrarily-large density may be assigned to all components, rather than the desired outcome of ω𝜔\\omega ‘splitting’ a finite density between components. The scene function F𝐹F and transformations Tt1​…​Jsuperscriptsubscript𝑇𝑡1…𝐽T_{t}^{1\\ldots J} and ΛtsubscriptΛ𝑡\\Lambda_{t} corresponding to a given input frame x0subscript𝑥0x_{0} must be inferred from that frame and the latent z𝑧z.\nWe therefore introduce a U-Net  conditioning network111All network architectures are given in Appendix A, that has x0subscript𝑥0x_{0} as input, and injects z𝑧z as conditioning at the bottleneck layer; from this we extract a 2D feature map ζ𝜁\\zeta and an embedding vector ξ𝜉\\xi. ξ𝜉\\xi is decoded by a densely-connected network to give parameters of the transformations Tt1​…​Jsuperscriptsubscript𝑇𝑡1…𝐽T_{t}^{1\\ldots J} and ΛtsubscriptΛ𝑡\\Lambda_{t} for the components and camera respectively.\nWe experiment with two different parametrizations of ΛtsubscriptΛ𝑡\\Lambda_{t}: (i) a general model that allows arbitrary camera translation and yaw/pitch; (ii) a vehicle-specific model that captures the prior knowledge that cameras mounted on cars are typically restricted to motion parallel with the ground plane, characterized by a forward speed and azimuthal velocity.\nWe hypothesize this additional prior knowledge will make the learning task easier, as the model does not have to waste representational capacity learning it.\nThe precise specifications of these parametrizations are given in Appendix B. The conditioning variables ζ𝜁\\zeta and ξ𝜉\\xi also influence the scene function F𝐹F in two ways.\nFirst, ξ𝜉\\xi is used as input to FiLM conditioning layers  following each hidden-layer activation 222We tried instead conditioning F𝐹F by having a hyper-network directly predict its weights; this gave comparable results but proved to be much less stable during training.\nSecond, when evaluating F𝐹F at a 3D location p𝑝p at time t𝑡t, we map p𝑝p back into the 3D space of the initial frame (t=0𝑡0t=0) by applying the inverse of the predicted camera transformation and each of the component transformations at time t𝑡t.\nThen, we bilinearly sample the feature map ζ𝜁\\zeta, and provide these features as an additional input to F𝐹F, concatenated with p𝑝p, similar to . We have now specified the full conditional generative model P​(x>0|x0)𝑃conditionalsubscript𝑥absent0subscript𝑥0P(x_{>0}\\,|\\,x_{0}).\nTo train this model, we would ideally maximize the likelihood of future frames given initial frames.\nHowever, this is intractable as we must marginalize the latent variable z𝑧z; we therefore use Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes [ref]21 [ref]38.\nSpecifically, we introduce a variational posterior distribution Q​(z|x0,x>0)𝑄conditional𝑧subscript𝑥0subscript𝑥absent0Q(z\\,|\\,x_{0},\\,x_{>0}), chosen to be a diagonal Gaussian.\nIts mean and log-variance are predicted by an encoder network encϕ​(x0,x>0)subscriptencitalic-ϕsubscript𝑥0subscript𝑥absent0\\mathrm{enc}_{\\phi}(x_{0},x_{>0}).\nFor this we use a 3D CNN taking the concatenated frames as input (orange components in Figure 1).\nIntuitively, as the encoder has access to complete video clips at training time, it should learn to embed information about motion and disoccluded regions in z𝑧z, so the decoder can learn to reconstruct them.\nIn practice, the model is trained end-to-end to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) [ref]21 [ref]38 using Adam ; as in , we multiply the KL-divergence term by a weight β𝛽\\beta, which is linearly increased from zero during the start of training.\nWe also add a reconstruction loss for x0subscript𝑥0x_{0}, with the component and camera transformations set to the identity. To reduce computational intensity, we only reconstruct a sparse subset of points q𝑞q in each frame.\nMoreover, to reduce the number of samples K𝐾K required along each ray, we also pretrain the unsupervised single-frame depth-prediction method of  on our data, and use this to guide the sampling process at training time.\nSpecifically, we draw one third of samples nearer the camera than the depth prediction, one third in the region close to it, and one third farther away.\nWe also provide these depth predictions as an additional input to F𝐹F and regularize ρ𝜌\\rho and ΛtsubscriptΛ𝑡\\Lambda_{t} to be consistent with them, which improves convergence. To avoid degenerate solutions, we apply several other regularizers on the predictions of our model.\nTo do so, we render 2D flow and component segmentation maps ℱtsubscriptℱ𝑡\\mathcal{F}_{t} and ℳtjsuperscriptsubscriptℳ𝑡𝑗\\mathcal{M}_{t}^{j} for each frame xtsubscript𝑥𝑡x_{t}.\nInspired by classical structure-from-motion techniques, we extract keypoint tracks from the ground-truth frames using the self-supervised method .\nWe then require that the frame-to-frame displacements of the keypoints are consistent with ℱtsubscriptℱ𝑡\\mathcal{F}_{t}.\nWe also L1-regularize the component velocities, which avoids difficult-to-recover local optima where the motion is very large, and TV-L1 regularize   the component masks ℳtjsuperscriptsubscriptℳ𝑡𝑗\\mathcal{M}_{t}^{j}.\nFurther details of these regularizers are given in Appendix C.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: model of the form P​(x>0|x0)=P​(z)​P​(x>0|z,x0)𝑃conditionalsubscript𝑥absent0subscript𝑥0𝑃𝑧𝑃conditionalsubscript𝑥absent0𝑧subscript𝑥0P(x_{>0}\\,|\\,x_{0})=P(z)\\,P(x_{>0}\\,|\\,z,\\,x_{0}).\nAs is common [ref]21 [ref]38, we choose z𝑧z to be a multivariate standard Gaussian distribution, i.e. z∼𝒩​(𝟎,I)similar-to𝑧𝒩0𝐼z\\sim\\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0},\\,I).\nTo ensure the generated clip depicts a consistent\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
