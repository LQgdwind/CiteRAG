      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-Stage Fusion for One-Click Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs an essential building block of image/video editing applications, interactive segmentation and dates back decades . The latest methods  [ref]2 [ref]4  [ref]7 integrate deep architectures\nsuch as FCN-8s  or DeepLab  . Most of these approaches integrate user cues in the input stage. The clicks are transformed into ‘guidance’ maps and appended to the three-channel colour image input before being passed through a CNN  [ref]2 [ref]4. Early Interactive Instance Segmentation approaches used graph-cuts  , geodesics, or a combination . These methods’ performance is limited as they separate the foreground and background based on low-level colour and texture features. Consequently, for scenes where foreground and background are similar in appearance, or lighting and contrast is low, more labelling effort from the users to achieve good segmentations [ref]2. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks   have been incorporated into interactive segmentation frameworks. Initially, [ref]2 used Euclidean distance-based guidance maps to represent user-provided clicks and are passed along with the input RGB image through a fully convolutional network. Subsequent works made extensions with newer CNN architectures , iterative training procedures  and structure-aware guidance maps [ref]4. These works share a structural similarity: the guidance maps are concatenated with the RGB image as additional channels at the first (input) layer. We refer to this form of structure as early fusion (see Fig. 2(a)). Architecture-wise, early fusion is simple and easy to train; however, user inputs’ influence gets diminished through the layers. \n Tap-and-Shoot Segmentation was introduced by , and refers to the one-click interactive setting. One assumes that during image capture, the user taps the touchscreen (once) on the foreground object of interest, from which one can directly segment the object of interest.   uses early fusion; it transforms the user tap into a guidance map via two shortest-path minimizations and then concatenates the map to the input image. The authors validate only on simple datasets such as ECSSD 6 and MSRA10K 7, where the images contain a single dominant foreground object. As we show later in our benchmarks (see Table 1), these datasets are so simplistic that properly trained networks with no user input can also generate high-quality segmentation masks which are comparable or even surpass the results reported by . \n Feature Fusion in Deep Architectures is an efficient way to leverage complementary information, either from different modalities 8, or different levels of abstraction 9. Element-wise multiplication [ref]7 and addition   are two common operations applied for fusing multiple channels. Other strategies include ‘skip’ connections , where features from earlier layers are concatenated with the features extracted from the deeper layers. Recently, a few interactive instance segmentation works have begun exploring outside of the early-fusion paradigm to integrate user guidance  [ref]7. However, these approaches are heavy in their computational footprint, as they increase the number of parameters to be learned by order of hundred of millions [ref]7. Dilution of input information is common-place in deep CNNs as the input gets processed several blocks of convolution . Feature fusion helps preserve input information by reducing the layers of abstraction between the user interaction and the segmentation output.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: As an essential building block of image/video editing applications, interactive segmentation and dates back decades .
