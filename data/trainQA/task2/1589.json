      "content": "Paper Title: End-to-End Deep Learning of Lane Detection and Path Prediction for Real-Time Autonomous Driving\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFig. 1 illustrates the architecture of both the original UNet  and DSUNet. DSUNet replaces 17 3x3 convolutional (conv) layers in UNet with 17 3x3 depthwise and 17 1x1 pointwise conv layers shown by red arrows in the figure with 3 dropouts by light-blue bars. The batch normalization and padding method of [ref]2 are used in DSUNet. The input and output channels of DSUNet/UNet are 3/1 and 1/2, respectively, due to different input images (color/black and white) and output\nloss functions (weighted cross entropy/softmax). Other operations remain the same. The ratios of DSUNet/UNet are 40/23 conv layers, 6.01/31.04 M parameters, 9.56/62.51 B multiplication accumulation operations (MACs) with the same I/O of DSUnet, and 45/28 frames per second (FPS) in inference on a PC with Intel i9-9900K and an NVIDIA RTX 2080ti. In the past few years, UNet have been modified or extended for its use in various applications  such as 3D volumetric segmentation , 3D stroke lesion segmentation , retinal vessel segmentation  , and photoacoustic imaging . Bruls et al. first applied UNet to road marking detection with batch normalization after every convolutional layer [ref]2. Zou et al. replaced the bottom layer of UNet with a convolutional long short-term\nmemory network to form UNet-ConvLSTM, where UNet features of continuous multiple frames are inputs to LSTM in time series for feature learning and lane prediction . UNet-ConvLSTM improves inference accuracy significantly, especially for road images with worn-up or occluded lane markings. In addition to CNN’s performance in accuracy, its computational complexity is a critical concern in self-driving cars  . Depthwise separable convolutions  separate the operations of spatial and channel correlations  using single-channel kxk and 1x1 filters [ref]15, respectively, and thus greatly reduce parameters [ref]15 . This idea inspired a variety of efficient models such as SqueezeNet, Xception, MobileNet, and ShuffleNet derived from AlexNet, GooLeNet, or ResNet for classification or object detection [ref]15  [ref]17 . From UNet for semantic segmentation, Beheshti and Johnsson designed Squeeze-UNet  by replacing the contracting and expanding layers with fire modules inspired by SqueezeNet [ref]15. The ratios of Squeeze-UNet/UNet are 0.8 to 0.98 in accuracy for five classes (car, road, tree, building, and sky), 1/12 in model size MB, 1/3.2 in MACs, and 0.83 and 0.48 in inference and training time, respectively. The main differences between our and their model are the ratios (DSUnet/Squeeze-UNet) 0.46 and 1.33 in MACs and the speed of inference, respectively, i.e., DSUnet is 1.33x faster. We use standard depthwise separable convolutions [ref]15  [ref]17 instead of fire modules that repeatedly squeeze (using 1x1 filters) and expand (mixing 1x1 and 3x3 filters) conv layers. Gadosey et al. also applied DS convolutions with weight standardization and group normalization to UNet (SD-UNet) for semantic segmentation of biomedical images, where SD is short for stripping down . Their results show that the ratios of SD-UNet/UNet are 0.97/0.98 for accuracy, 3.9/31 M parameters, 7.8/62.04 floating point operations, and 91/56 in inference speed. The ratios of DSUNet/SD-UNet are 1 for accuracy, 1.53 in parameters, 1.22 in operations, and 0.99 in speed. SD-UNet is much lighter than DSUNet in computational complexity. Nevertheless, the performance of these two models in accuracy and speed is almost the same on the baseline of UNet for two different applications. Path prediction models are generally polynomials of lane centerline having\nfew coefficients determined by heading and lane curvature without  or with considering vehicle’s transient dynamics such as yaw rate\nand lateral and longitudinal velocities . Cudrano et al.  proposed an integrated NN-PP model that uses vehicle’s heading and\nlateral displacement calculated from the lane detection output of a modified\nUNet to determine a cubic polynomial. They tested the model in a real\ncar driving on two racetracks (one is more curvy and the other is less)\nwithout other cars and with a maximum speed of 54 km/h. They tested PP algorithm with results but did not present the overall\narchitecture of NN-PP model, the details of the modified UNet, and its performance on lane detection. We proposed a deep learning model in  that combines multi-task\nCNN and control algorithms for multiple actions in autonomous driving\n(steering, acceleration, braking, lane changing, and overtaking). We also\nmodified The Open Racing Car Simulator (TORCS)    on which the model was implemented for a\nhost car (Host) efficiently inferring and stably driving with other\nautonomous cars (Agents) in dynamic TORCS traffic  . We extend here our TORCS\nto include lane detection and path prediction in order to test and evaluate\nthe overall performance of deep learning, lane detection, and path\nprediction algorithms in the simulator before deploying them to real cars in\nreal world traffic.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: (conv) layers in UNet with 17 3x3 depthwise and 17 1x1 pointwise conv layers shown by red arrows in the figure with 3 dropouts by light-blue bars.
