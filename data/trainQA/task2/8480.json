      "content": "Paper Title: 2D-AoI: Age-of-Information of Distributed Sensors for Spatio-Temporal Processes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we show how a random AeD can be included in the 2D-AoI model. The application scenario is based on¬† [ref]41 , where distributed sensors can detect the state of several sources, but only with a certain probability. In the scenario that we investigate, there is a set of distributed but overlapping sensors ùïä\\mathbb{S}, such as cameras. Each of the sensors œÇ‚ààùïä\\varsigma\\in\\mathbb{S} can take samples of the physical process at its own position xœÇx_{\\varsigma} at will. Due to the overlap, sensor œÇ\\varsigma can also generate samples of the physical process at other positions xsx_{s}, but depending on its distance, the sensor will only be successful with probability pœÇ‚Äãs‚àà p_{\\varsigma s}\\in . The sensor is aware of its success and either retains or discards the sample accordingly. For instance, a camera tracking an object can also detect if it lost sight of the object, e.g. due to occlusion. In view of the limited reliability, the generation of samples for other positions xs‚â†xœÇx_{s}\\neq x_{\\varsigma} is carried out as a secondary task. We model this as an independent sampling process with rate œâœÇ\\omega_{\\varsigma}. Whenever a sensor œÇ\\varsigma sends a fresh sample of the physical process at its own position xœÇx_{\\varsigma}, it also adds the most recent successful samples that it has obtained for the other positions xs‚â†xœÇx_{s}\\neq x_{\\varsigma}. In this model, the sensor sends fresh information for its own position but potentially aged information for the other positions. We consider this as the AeD of sensor œÇ\\varsigma with respect to position xsx_{s} to determine the 2D-AoI. Unlike in¬† [ref]41  we do not consider scheduled transmissions but the sensors transmit their samples via independent slotted ALOHA channels as defined in Sec.¬†VII-B. An example of the selected scenario is in vehicular communications. The physical process that we consider is the position xsx_{s} of the vehicle ss itself. The vehicle ss can sample its internal positioning sensors at will and from time to time it broadcasts its position via so-called cooperative awareness messages. This information ages over time and messages can also be lost. The other vehicles œÇ\\varsigma use their sensors, such as camera, lidar, or radar, to detect their surroundings and, among other things, to track vehicle ss. The detection is not reliable, e.g. due to occlusions. In their broadcasts, the vehicles also indicate the estimated positions of the detected objects, including vehicle ss. By fusing these data, a collective perception service is achieved. We focus on one position xsx_{s} and determine the 2D-AoI of sensor œÇ‚â†s\\varsigma\\neq s with respect to this position. First, we consider the case where sensor œÇ\\varsigma has perfect detection of the physical process at position xsx_{s}, i.e. pœÇ‚Äãs=1p_{\\varsigma s}=1. We model the sampling process as a Poisson process with rate œâœÇ\\omega_{\\varsigma}. This implies that the times between consecutive samples are iid exponential random variables with parameter œâœÇ\\omega_{\\varsigma}. If we observe the sampling process at a random point in time tt, the time since the last sample, that is the backward recurrence time, is exponential with parameter œâœÇ\\omega_{\\varsigma}¬†[54, Ex. 5.5]. Other sampling processes are also possible. If pœÇ‚Äãs<1p_{\\varsigma s}<1, we have to consider the case of unsuccessful samples, which occur with probability 1‚àípœÇ‚Äãs1-p_{\\varsigma s}. Hence the time between two successful samples YY becomes Y=‚àëi=1NXiY=\\sum_{i=1}^{N}X_{i}. Here XiX_{i} are the iid exponential inter-arrival times of the sampling process with parameter œâœÇ\\omega_{\\varsigma} and given the successes are iid, NN is a geometric random variable with ùñØ‚Äã[N=n]=pœÇ‚Äãs‚Äã(1‚àípœÇ‚Äãs)n‚àí1\\mathsf{P}[N=n]=p_{\\varsigma s}(1-p_{\\varsigma s})^{n-1} for n‚àà{1,2,‚Ä¶}n\\in\\{1,2,\\dots\\}. It follows that YY is exponential with parameter pœÇ‚Äãs‚ÄãœâœÇp_{\\varsigma s}\\omega_{\\varsigma}. This is seen by unconditioning the conditional moment generating function ùñ¨‚Äã[Y|N=n]=(œâœÇ/(œâœÇ‚àíŒ∏))n\\mathsf{M}[Y|N=n]=(\\omega_{\\varsigma}/(\\omega_{\\varsigma}-\\theta))^{n} which gives for Œ∏<pœÇ‚Äãs‚ÄãœâœÇ\\theta<p_{\\varsigma s}\\omega_{\\varsigma}. The result is the moment generating function of the exponential distribution with parameter pœÇ‚Äãs‚ÄãœâœÇp_{\\varsigma s}\\omega_{\\varsigma} and thus the sequence of successful samples is a Poisson process. If this process is observed at a random point in time, e.g. at the time when the sensor œÇ\\varsigma sends its samples, the time since the sensor œÇ\\varsigma last successfully sampled the position xsx_{s} is again exponential with parameter pœÇ‚Äãs‚ÄãœâœÇp_{\\varsigma s}\\omega_{\\varsigma}. This is the AeD of sensor œÇ\\varsigma with respect to position xsx_{s}. For œÇ‚â†s\\varsigma\\neq s, we derive the CCDF of the 2D-AoI from Eq.¬†(3) by convolution of the CDF of the AoI\nof the slotted ALOHA channel given by Eq.¬†(28) with the probability density function of the AeD that is pdf‚Äã(x)=pœÇ‚Äãs‚ÄãœâœÇ‚Äãe‚àípœÇ‚Äãs‚ÄãœâœÇ‚Äãx\\text{pdf}(x)=p_{\\varsigma s}\\omega_{\\varsigma}e^{-p_{\\varsigma s}\\omega_{\\varsigma}x} as where we used an estimate of Eq.¬†(28) without the integer constraint. For œÇ=s\\varsigma=s we have Œît‚Äã2D‚Äã(s,s)=Œît‚Äã(s)\\Delta^{\\textsf{\\!{2D}}}_{t}(s,s)=\\Delta_{t}(s) and ùñØ‚Äã[Œî‚Äã(s)>y]=(1‚àíq)y\\mathsf{P}[\\Delta(s)>y]=(1-q)^{y}. The minimal 2D-AoI of several sensors œÇ‚ààùïä\\varsigma\\in\\mathbb{S} follows by insertion of Eq.¬†(32) into Eq.¬†(6). The 2D-AoI in Eq.¬†(32) decreases with increasing pœÇ‚Äãs‚ÄãœâœÇ>0p_{\\varsigma s}\\omega_{\\varsigma}>0,\nand in the limit for pœÇ‚Äãs‚ÄãœâœÇ‚Üí‚àûp_{\\varsigma s}\\omega_{\\varsigma}\\to\\infty we have ùñØ‚Äã[Œît‚Äã2D‚Äã(œÇ,s)>y]=(1‚àíq)y\\mathsf{P}[\\Delta^{\\textsf{\\!{2D}}}_{t}(\\varsigma,s)>y]=(1-q)^{y}. For pœÇ‚Äãs‚ÄãœâœÇ<‚àíln‚Å°(1‚àíq)p_{\\varsigma s}\\omega_{\\varsigma}<-\\ln(1-q), increasing pœÇ‚Äãs‚ÄãœâœÇp_{\\varsigma s}\\omega_{\\varsigma} significantly improves the 2D-AoI. The gain becomes saturated when pœÇ‚Äãs‚ÄãœâœÇ>‚àíln‚Å°(1‚àíq)p_{\\varsigma s}\\omega_{\\varsigma}>-\\ln(1-q). The reason for this is that the tail decay rate of Eq.¬†(32) is either dominated by the term e‚àípœÇ‚Äãs‚ÄãœâœÇ‚Äãye^{-p_{\\varsigma s}\\omega_{\\varsigma}y} or by the term (1‚àíq)y=eln‚Å°(1‚àíq)‚Äãy(1-q)^{y}=e^{\\ln(1-q)y} depending on which value decays slower. If pœÇ‚Äãs‚ÄãœâœÇ>‚àíln‚Å°(1‚àíq)p_{\\varsigma s}\\omega_{\\varsigma}>-\\ln(1-q) the slotted ALOHA channel is the limiting factor and increasing the rate of successful samples has little effect. In practice, technical constraints will also limit the sampling rate, and a high sampling rate can affect the probability of success pœÇ‚Äãsp_{\\varsigma s} and the independence of sampling successes.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: In this section, we show how a random AeD can be included in the 2D-AoI model.
