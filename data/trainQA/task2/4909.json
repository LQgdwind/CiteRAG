      "content": "Paper Title: FedRecover: Recovering from Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning using Historical Information\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe consider multiple datasets for different learning tasks in our evaluation. Specifically, we use two image classification datasets (MNIST and Fashion-MNIST), a purchase style prediction dataset (Purchase), and a human activity recognition dataset (HAR). Unless otherwise mentioned, we show experimental results on MNIST for simplicity. MNIST: \nMNIST [ref]22 is a 10-class digit image classification dataset, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Both the height and the width of an image are 28. We adopt the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in  as the global model architecture.\nIn particular, the CNN consists of two convolutional layers, each of which is followed by a pooling layer, and two fully-connected layers. We assume 100 clients and use the method in  to distribute the training images to them, where the method has a parameter called degree of non-iid that ranges between 0.1 and 1. The clients’ local training data are non-iid when the degree of non-iid is larger than 0.1 and are more non-iid when the degree of non-iid is larger. By default, we set the degree of non-iid to 0.5 when distributing the training images to the clients, but we will explore its impact on FedRecover. Fashion-MNIST: \nFashion-MNIST [ref]35 is another 10-class image classification dataset. Unlike MNIST that contains digit images, Fashion-MNIST contains 70,000 fashion images. The dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, where the size of each image is 28×28282828\\times 28. We adopt the same CNN as MNIST. Moreover, we also assume 100 clients and we set the default degree of non-iid to 0.5 when distributing the training images to them. Purchase: \nPurchase is a retail dataset released by . The task is to predict the purchase style that a customer belongs to. The dataset contains 197,324 purchase records in total, where each record has 600 binary features and belongs to one of the 100 unbalanced classes. The dataset is split into 180,000 training records and 17,324 test records. Following , we adopt a fully connected neural network with one hidden layer as the global model architecture, where the number of neurons in the hidden layer is 1,024 and the activation function is Tanh.\nWe also assume there are 100 clients in total. Following , we evenly distribute the training records to them. Human activity recognition (HAR): \nHAR [ref]4\nis a 6-class human activity recognition dataset. The dataset is collected from the smartphones of 30 real-world users. Each data sample consists of 561 features representing the signals collected from multiple sensors of a user’s smartphone, and belongs to one of the 6 possible activities (e.g., walking, sitting, and standing). We consider each user in the dataset as a client. Furthermore, following 1, we use 75% of each client’s data as local training data and the rest 25% as test data. We adopt a fully connected neural network with two hidden layers as the global model architecture, where each hidden layer consists of 256 neurons and uses ReLU as the activation function.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: a purchase style prediction dataset (Purchase), and a human activity recognition dataset (HAR). Unless otherwise mentioned, we show experimental results on MNIST for simplicity. MNIST: \nMNIST [ref]22 is a 10-class digit image classification dataset, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Both the height and the width of an image are 28. We adopt the Convolutional\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
