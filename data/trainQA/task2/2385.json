      "content": "Paper Title: From Show to Tell: A Survey on Deep Learning-based Image Captioning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPaired image-caption datasets are very expensive to obtain. Thus, some image captioning variants are being explored that limit the need for full supervision information. Novel Object Captioning.\nNovel object captioning focuses on describing objects not appearing in the training set, thus enabling a zero-shot learning setting that can increase the applicability of the models in the real world. Early approaches to this task [ref]176  tried to transfer knowledge from out-domain images by conditioning the model on external unpaired visual and textual data at training time. To explore this strategy, Hendricks et al. [ref]176 introduced a variant of the COCO dataset , called held-out COCO, in which image-caption pairs containing one of eight pre-selected object classes were removed from the training set but not from the test set. To further encourage research on this task, the more challenging nocaps dataset, with nearly 400 novel objects, has been introduced [ref]178.\nSome approaches to this variant  [ref]180 integrate copying mechanisms in the language model to select novel objects predicted from a tagger or generate a caption template with placeholders to be filled with novel objects  .\nOn a different line, Anderson et al.  devised the Constrained Beam Search algorithm to force the inclusion of selected tag words in the output caption, following the predictions of a tagger. Moreover, following the pre-training trend with BERT-like architectures, Hu et al.  proposed a multi-layer Transformer model pre-trained by randomly masking one or more tags from image-tag pairs. Unpaired Image Captioning.\nUnpaired Image Captioning approaches can be either unsupervised or semi-supervised. Unsupervised captioning aims at understanding and describing images without paired image-text training data. Following unpaired machine translation approaches, the early work  proposes to generate captions in a pivot language and then translate predicted captions to the target language. After this work, the most common approach focuses on adversarial learning by training an LSTM-based discriminator to distinguish whether a caption is real or generated  . As alternative approaches, it is worth mentioning  that generates a caption from the image scene-graph and  that leverages a memory-based network.\nMoreover, semi-supervised approaches have been proposed, such as , which uses both paired and unpaired data with adversarial learning, and , which performs iterative self-learning. Continual Captioning.\nContinual captioning aims to deal with partially unavailable data by following the continual learning paradigm to incrementally learn new tasks without forgetting what has been learned before. In this respect, new tasks can be represented as sequences of captioning tasks with different vocabularies, as proposed in , and the model should be able to transfer visual concepts from one to the other while enlarging its vocabulary.\n\nReference markers found: [176]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]176: on describing objects not appearing in the training set, thus enabling a zero-shot learning setting that can increase the applicability of the models in the real world.

To explore this strategy, Hendricks et\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
