      "content": "Paper Title: An Online Riemannian PCA for Stochastic Canonical Correlation Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCanonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a classical\nmethod for evaluating correlations between two sets of variables.\nIt is commonly used in unsupervised multi-view learning,\nwhere the multiple views of the data may correspond to\nimage, text, audio and so on\n [ref]12 .\nClassical formulations have also been\nextended to leverage advances in\nrepresentation learning, for example, \nshowed how the CCA can be interfaced\nwith deep neural networks enabling modern use cases. Many results\nover the last few years have used CCA or its variants for problems\nincluding measuring representational similarity in deep neural networks ,\nspeech recognition , and so on. The goal in CCA is to find linear combinations within two random variables 𝕏𝕏\\mathbb{X} and 𝕐𝕐\\mathbb{Y}\nwhich have maximum correlation with each other. Formally,\nthe CCA problem is defined in the following way.\nLet X∈𝐑N×dx𝑋superscript𝐑𝑁subscript𝑑𝑥X\\in\\mathbf{R}^{N\\times d_{x}} and Y∈𝐑N×dy𝑌superscript𝐑𝑁subscript𝑑𝑦Y\\in\\mathbf{R}^{N\\times d_{y}} be N𝑁N samples respectively drawn from pair of random variables 𝕏𝕏\\mathbb{X} (dxsubscript𝑑𝑥d_{x}-variate random variable) and 𝕐𝕐\\mathbb{Y} (dysubscript𝑑𝑦d_{y}-variate random variable), with unknown joint probability distribution. The goal is to\nfind the projection matrices U∈𝐑dx×k𝑈superscript𝐑subscript𝑑𝑥𝑘U\\in\\mathbf{R}^{d_{x}\\times k} and\nV∈𝐑dy×k𝑉superscript𝐑subscript𝑑𝑦𝑘V\\in\\mathbf{R}^{d_{y}\\times k}, with k≤min​{dx,dy}𝑘minsubscript𝑑𝑥subscript𝑑𝑦k\\leq\\mathrm{min}\\{d_{x},d_{y}\\}, such\nthat the correlation is maximized: Here, CX=1N​XT​Xsubscript𝐶𝑋1𝑁superscript𝑋𝑇𝑋C_{X}=\\frac{1}{N}X^{T}X and CY=1N​YT​Ysubscript𝐶𝑌1𝑁superscript𝑌𝑇𝑌C_{Y}=\\frac{1}{N}Y^{T}Y are the sample covariance matrices, and CX​Y=1N​XT​Ysubscript𝐶𝑋𝑌1𝑁superscript𝑋𝑇𝑌C_{XY}=\\frac{1}{N}X^{T}Y denotes the sample cross-covariance. The objective function in (1)\nis the expected cross-correlation in the projected space and the\nconstraints specify\nthat different canonical components should be decorrelated. Let us define the whitened covariance T≔CX−1/2​CX​Y​CY−1/2≔𝑇superscriptsubscript𝐶𝑋12subscript𝐶𝑋𝑌superscriptsubscript𝐶𝑌12T\\coloneqq C_{X}^{-1/2}C_{XY}C_{Y}^{-1/2} and\nΦksubscriptΦ𝑘\\Phi_{k} (and ΨksubscriptΨ𝑘\\Psi_{k}) contains the top-k𝑘k left (and right) singular vectors of T𝑇T. It is known\n that the optimum of (1)\nis achieved at U∗=CX−1/2​Φksuperscript𝑈superscriptsubscript𝐶𝑋12subscriptΦ𝑘U^{*}=C_{X}^{-1/2}\\Phi_{k}, V∗=CY−1/2​Ψksuperscript𝑉superscriptsubscript𝐶𝑌12subscriptΨ𝑘V^{*}=C_{Y}^{-1/2}\\Psi_{k}. Finally, we compute U∗superscript𝑈U^{*}, V∗superscript𝑉V^{*} by applying a k𝑘k-truncated SVD to T~~𝑇\\widetilde{T}. Runtime and memory considerations.\nThe above procedure is simple but is only feasible when the data matrices are small.\nIn most modern applications, not only are\nthe datasets large but also the dimension d𝑑d (let d=max⁡{dx,dy}𝑑subscript𝑑𝑥subscript𝑑𝑦d=\\max\\{d_{x},d_{y}\\}) of each sample can be high, especially\nif representations are being learned using deep models.\nAs a result, the computational footprint of the algorithm can be high.\nThis has motivated the study of stochastic optimization routines\nfor solving CCA.\nObserve that in contrast to the typical settings where stochastic schemes are most effective,\nthe CCA objective does not decompose over samples in the dataset.\nMany efficient strategies have been proposed in the literature:\nfor example,  4 present\nEmpirical Risk Minimization (ERM) models which optimize\nthe empirical objective.\nMore recently, [ref]16  [ref]5 describe\nproposals that optimize the population objective. To summarize the approaches succinctly,\nif we are satisfied with identifying the top 111 component of CCA, effective schemes\nare available by utilizing either extensions of the Oja’s rule  to the generalized eigenvalue problem  or the alternating SVRG algorithm [ref]16).\nOtherwise, a stochastic approach must make use of an explicit whitening operation\nwhich involves a cost of d3superscript𝑑3d^{3} for each iteration [ref]5. Observation.\nMost approaches either directly optimize (1) or instead\na reparameterized or regularized form   [ref]5. Often,\nthe search space for U𝑈U and V𝑉V corresponds to\nthe entire 𝐑d×ksuperscript𝐑𝑑𝑘\\mathbf{R}^{d\\times k} (ignoring the constraints for the moment). But if the formulation could be cast in a form which involved\napproximately writing U𝑈U and V𝑉V as a product of structured matrices, we may be able to obtain specialized routines which are tailored to\nexploit those properties. Such a reformulation is not difficult to derive – where\nthe matrices used to express U𝑈U and V𝑉V can be identified\nas objects that live in well studied geometric spaces. Then, utilizing the geometry of the space and borrowing relevant tools from\ndifferential geometry leads to an efficient approximate algorithm for top-k𝑘k CCA which optimizes the population objective in a streaming fashion. Contributions.\n(a) First, we re-parameterize the top-k𝑘k CCA problem as an optimization problem on specific\nmatrix manifolds, and show that it is equivalent to the original formulation in (1).\n(b) Informed by the geometry of the manifold,\nwe derive stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms for solving the re-parameterized\nproblem with O​(d2​k)𝑂superscript𝑑2𝑘O(d^{2}k) cost per iteration\nand provide convergence rate guarantees.\n(c) This analysis gives a direct mechanism\nto obtain an upper bound on the number of\niterations needed to guarantee an ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon error w.r.t. the population objective for the\nCCA problem.\n(d) The algorithm works in a streaming\nmanner so it easily scales to large datasets and we do not need to assume access to\nthe full dataset at the outset.\n(e) We present empirical evidence for both the standard CCA model\nand the DeepCCA setting , describing advantages\nand limitations.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: evaluating correlations between two sets of variables.\nIt is commonly used in unsupervised multi-view learning,\nwhere the multiple views of the data may correspond to\nimage, text, audio and so on\n [ref]12 .\nClassical formulations have also been\nextended to leverage advances in\nrepresentation learning, for example, \nshowed how the CCA can be interfaced\nwith deep neural networks enabling modern\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
