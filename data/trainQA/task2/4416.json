      "content": "Paper Title: 𝜇⁢\"KG\": A Library for Multi-source Knowledge Graph Embeddings and Applications\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nKnowledge graphs (KGs), such as Freebase , DBpedia , Wikidata 5, and YAGO , store rich structured knowledge about the real world.\nThey have been widely used in a variety of knowledge-driven applications, including semantic search, question answering, and logic reasoning 9.\nLearning vector representations (a.k.a. embeddings) of KGs has become critical to support these intelligent applications.\nIn the past ten years, various KG embedding models such as TransE [ref]5, ConvE 2, RotatE 1 and TuckER  were proposed and achieved promising performance.\nPlease refer to the recent surveys 1 6 for an overview.\nWith these applications becoming more and more popular and diverse, they put forward higher demands to KGs in terms of coverage, richness and multilingualism.\nOftentimes, a single KG cannot meet all these demands.\nThis difficulty calls for the integration of multiple KGs.\nLearning from multi-source KGs with entity alignment has drawn a lot of attention in recent years  6.\nThe joint KG embeddings have demonstrated useful for a variety of downstream tasks such as entity typing and multi-source KG completion  5. To support the easy use of KG embeddings and foster reproducible research into KG embedding techniques, much effort has been dedicated to developing KG embedding libraries, including OpenKE , DGL-KE , Pykg2vec , PyKEEN  , TorchKGE , LibKGE , OpenEA 0, EAkit  and NeuralKG .\nThe majority of these libraries concentrates on the typical KG embedding task of link prediction.\nOnly OpenEA and EAkit support multi-source KG embedding and the corresponding task entity alignment.\nBesides, most of them only support one deep learning library, especially PyTorch.\nNo one supports another prominent deep learning library TensorFlow2 (TF2 for short).\nThis limits the contexts in which these libraries can be used.\nFacing these limitations of existing work and being aware of the effectiveness of multi-source KG embeddings, we develop a new scalable library, namely μ​KG𝜇KG\\mu\\text{KG}, for multi-source KG embeddings and applications.\nTable 1 compares μ​KG𝜇KG\\mu\\text{KG} with the existing popular KG embedding libraries.\nIn summary, μ​KG𝜇KG\\mu\\text{KG} has the following features: Comprehensive.\nμ​KG𝜇KG\\mu\\text{KG} is a full-featured Python library for representation learning over a single KG or multi-source KGs.\nIt is compatible with the two widely-used deep learning libraries PyTorch and TF2, and can therefore be easily integrated into downstream applications.\nIt integrates a variety of KG embedding models and supports four KG tasks including link prediction, entity alignment, entity typing, and multi-source link prediction. Fast and scalable.\nμ​KG𝜇KG\\mu\\text{KG} provides advanced implementations of KG embedding techniques with the support of multi-process and multi-GPU parallel computing, making it fast and scalable to large KGs. Easy-to-use.\nμ​KG𝜇KG\\mu\\text{KG} provides simplified pipelines of KG embedding tasks for easy use.\nUsers can interact with μ​KG𝜇KG\\mu\\text{KG} through both methods APIs and command line.\nIt also has high-quality documentation. Open-source and continuously updated.\nThe source code of μ​KG𝜇KG\\mu\\text{KG} is publicly available.\nOur team will keep up-to-date on new related techniques and integrate new (multi-source) KG embedding models, tasks, and datasets into μ​KG𝜇KG\\mu\\text{KG}.\nWe will also keep improving existing implementations. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our library μ​KG𝜇KG\\mu\\text{KG}.\nMoreover, we carefully design two new tasks, multi-source link prediction and multi-source knowledge graph question answering (KGQA), with experiments to demonstrate the potential of multi-source KG embeddings: For multi-source link prediction,\nwe can convert the multiple KGs into a joint graph by merging their aligned entities, on which we learn joint KG embeddings for link prediction over each KG.\nThis differs from the traditional link prediction, which first trains the model on a single KG and then predicts links for the same KG.\nIn our joint learning setting, to avoid the test set of a KG’s link prediction task having overlap with other KGs’ training set,\nwe do not consider relation alignment in multi-source KGs, and also remove these overlapping triples from the training set if they exist.\nOur experiment on DBP15K 6 shows that the joint trained TransE [ref]5 outperforms its separately trained variant by 122%percent122122\\% on H​i​t​s​@​1𝐻𝑖𝑡𝑠@1Hits@1. For multi-source KGQA, as a downstream application of KGs, we have attempted to use multi-source KG embeddings to aid in the task of multi-hop question answering over a KG.\nThe typical pipeline of using KG embeddings to answer natural language questions 2 is learning to align the question representation (encoded by a pre-trained language model like BERT 3) with the answer entity’s embedding (encoded by a KG embedding model like ComplEx 4).\nConventional methods and datasets only consider QA over a single KG.\nWe introduce an additional KG for joint embedding with the target KG using μ​KG𝜇KG\\mu\\text{KG}.\nThe embeddings of the target KG from the joint space are used for QA.\nOur results on WebQuestionsSP  show that joint KG embeddings can improve the accuracy by 8.6%percent8.68.6\\% over independently trained embeddings on a single KG. Overall, these experiments show that the multi-source KG embeddings are able to promote knowledge fusion and transfer, and therefore benefit downstream tasks.\nWe hope that our μ​KG𝜇KG\\mu\\text{KG} library can encourage the use of multi-source KG embeddings and promote their applications.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: vector representations (a.k.a. embeddings) of KGs has become critical to support these intelligent applications.\nIn the past ten years, various KG embedding models such as TransE [ref]5, ConvE 2, RotatE 1 and TuckER  were proposed and achieved promising performance.\nPlease refer to the recent surveys 1 6 for an overview.\nWith these applications becoming more and more popular\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
