      "content": "Paper Title: Chain of Thought Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMulti-modal methods with pretrained vision and language models, including CLIP0, ALIGN , and Flamingo , have achieved significant results in vision-text matching.\nThe vision-language models contain an image encoder and a text encoder, which are trained contrastively and can effectively align semantically related concepts in a shared embedding space.\nWith the ability to produce classification weights diametrically, the text encoder can effectively guide the model to predict accurately in zero-shot scenarios, including tasks like image classification , visual question answering 1, and image-text retrieval[ref]6.\nHowever, manually creating prompts for vision and language models is a laborious procedure that often requires previous expert knowledge.\nFurthermore, if the manually designed prompts are not appropriate for the task, the model's performance will be impaired. To automate the prompt engineering process,    propose to optimize prompts using data from downstream tasks by minimizing a cross entropy loss.\nContrary to manual design, this method frees us from human prompt engineering and can effectively learn prompts that adapt well to downstream tasks, avoiding the issue that human-designed prompts might not be optimal for the task.\nAlthough achieving a good result on the specific downstream tasks, prompt tuning has a detrimental effect on the vision-language models' capacity to generalize, making them unable to adapt well to unseen visual concepts.\nBridging this generalization gap is an urgent issue and attracts much attention in the community . Unfortunately, these works use natural language as guidance to solve vision tasks, but they all fail to notice a fundamental yet very important feature in natural language: the power of reasoning.\nCognitively, the human brain is the only resilient system that can adapt successfully to new circumstances quickly, and many studies in different domains have shown the importance of studying how human brains operate and mimicking their behaviors to improve the generalizing capabilities of a model  3.\nRecently, it has been shown in the NLP community that training a model with additional guidance on human-like reasoning processes can considerably improve the generalizing capabilities of a model 7.\nRather than directly generating the final solution, generating the answer with a chain of reasoning sentences could probe the reasoning capacity of language models and hence generalize better for addressing different problems. A demonstration is shown in Figure 1, when answering a natural language question, instead of directly generating \"the answer is 11\", the language model is trained to generate a chain of reasoning sentences like \"Roger started with 5 balls\", \"2 cans of tennis balls each is 6 tennis balls.\", \"5+6=11.\", \"The answer is 11.\" Similarly, when given an image input, instead of asking the model to generate \"It is a dog\", we want it to go through a reasoning process like \"It is an animal.\", \"It is an animal with fur.\", \"It is an animal with furs and a black nose.\", \"It is a dog.\" Previous studies on vision-language models rely on a single prompt to guide vision tasks, which could not replicate the intrinsic reasoning process that people use, especially in new situations. In this work, we introduce the chain of thought intuition for visual understanding tasks. Although this intuition is straightforward in NLP since one can express their thought process directly with a few sentences and reasoning with language is natural, it is difficult to use in vision, which requires effectively combining step-by-step visual information extracted from an image with language reasoning. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a novel architecture to emulate this chain-of-thought reasoning process and apply it to vision tasks.\nFirst, we design multiple prompts that are connected together to form a chain, with each prompt receiving information from the previous prompt and passing it on to the next prompt. Then, instead of using a single network to generate an input-specific bias for the prompt, we design a chain of networks, where each network generates a step-specific bias corresponding to a specific step in a reasoning chain. Finally, we add a dynamic chain controller that is used to control the chain dynamically based on the input. We perform extensive experiments on a variety of tasks, including image classification, image-text retrieval, and visual question answering. In image classification, we conduct tasks on base to new generalization using 11 datasets covering a wide range of subjects. We also conduct a cross-dataset transfer experiment, in which the model is trained on ImageNet and tested directly on the other 10 datasets. In addition, We carry out a domain generalization experiment, in which the model trained on ImageNet is tested directly on other ImageNet datasets. In image-text retrieval, we conduct experiments on MSCOCO and Flickr30k[ref]6. Finally, in visual question answering, we test on the VQAv21 dataset. On all tasks, we attain a significant performance gain, which demonstrates the superiority of our approach. We also test the impact of our chaining architecture, and the experimental results prove that the chaining structure of either the prompts or the Meta-Nets is beneficial for out-of-domain generalization. To the best of our knowledge, this paper makes the following novel contributions: We are the first to successfully adapt chain-of-thought for prompt tuning that combines visual and textual embeddings in vision domain. It is consistent with the human learning paradigm, providing unique insight in vision domain. We propose a novel architecture to mimic the chain of thought processes of human. It effectively models the relation between prompts and is simple yet effective, requiring minimal additional computing resources and is easy to plug in, indicating its great potential for various applications. Demonstrates consistent performance inprovement by applying Chain of Thought architecture on five tasks. For base to new generalization, we improve CoCoOp by over 1.27%. For cross dataset transfer and domain generalization, we improve by 0.5% and 0.26%. For image-text retrieval, we improve by 0.97%, and finally for VQA, we improve by 1.07%.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: the text encoder can effectively guide the model to predict accurately in zero-shot scenarios, including tasks like image classification , visual question answering 1, and image-text retrieval[ref]6.\nHowever, manually creating prompts for vision and language models is a laborious procedure that often requires previous expert knowledge.\nFurthermore, if the manually designed prompts are not\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
