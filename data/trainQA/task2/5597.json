Table I compares Euler-angle MSEs when our diffusion model is used for deterministic motion prediction.\nHere, bold fonts denote the best results among all approaches, and underlines denote the best results among our denoisers (series or parallel).\nIt is shown that the overall performance of DCT-GCN [ref]13 is still the best.\nAmong our approaches, the denoiser which understands spatial and temporal information in series is better than the parallel denoiser.\nAlthough our models do not achieve state-of-the-art results, it is shown that our approaches are better in long-term prediction (1000ms) when compared with other transformer-based models [ref]14 [ref]15.\nThis is a notable result, since (1) our models are originally generative ones, and (2) our models do not require additional training for deterministic prediction since ignoring all randomness in the denoising process is all they need. Stochastic Prediction\nTable II shows the comparison of metrics for measuring the likelihood and diversity.\nHere, bold fonts denote the best result and underlines denote the second best result among all approaches.\nIt is shown that previous works   focusing on sample diversity best perform in APD.\nAlso, it is shown that they are generally better in terms of mDE and mFDE.\nWe would like to argue here that the high diversity in prediction increases the probability of having one sample closest to the ground truth.\nThen, how can we choose the most plausible result among predictions that are sampled to be diverse? This is the same question that  also pointed out.\nSo in , metrics for measuring the quality and context are proposed.\nFor measuring the quality,  used a pre-trained binary classifier which can discriminate the ground truths (real) from predictions (fake). If this classifier fails to discriminate the predicted motions as fake, a higher quality score is obtained.\nFor measuring the context,  used a pre-trained model which classifies action from motion. If it estimates that the action label of prediction is as same as the observed motion, a higher context score is obtained. However, we were not able to use the same metric as  since its pre-trained classifiers were not openly released.\nTherefore, we instead propose metrics such as aDE, sDE, aFDE, and sFDE, to measure how closely the samples are distributed near the ground truth.\nResults show that our approaches generally perform better in terms of these new metrics, and the parallel denoiser performs better than the series one.\nWe also present the result from VAEs  that were implemented by , to check how other non-diffusion generative models work.\nIt is shown that the overall performances of our series/parallel denoiser in diversity and likelihood are generally better than the VAEs, especially in the HumanEva-I dataset.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: bold fonts denote the best results among all approaches, and underlines denote the best results among our denoisers (series or parallel).\nIt is shown that the overall performance of DCT-GCN [ref]13 is still the best.\nAmong our approaches, the denoiser which understands spatial and temporal information in series is better than the parallel denoiser.\nAlthough our models do not achieve\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
