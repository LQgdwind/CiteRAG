      "content": "Paper Title: Interacting Hand-Object Pose Estimation via Dense Mutual Attention\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAccurate and efficient pose estimation for the scene of a hand interacting with an object from a single monocular view is desired in many applications, e.g. extended reality (XR)  and human-computer iteration (HCI) . Despite that great efforts have been contributed to developing effective 3D hand pose estimation algorithms     , joint hand-object pose estimation remains especially challenging due to the severe mutual occlusion and diverse ways of hand-object manipulation.\nMethods failing to tackle the aforementioned challenges tend to produce physically implausible configurations, such as interpenetration and out-of-contact. To avoid generating undesired poses, an in-depth understanding of the correlation between the hand and the interacting object is therefore required. Research works on 3D hand-object pose estimation can be categorized as optimization-based and learning-based. While the former methods  [ref]13  generalize to diverse object classes, the optimization process requires multiple iterations to converge, which is not applicable for real-time applications like XR. In contrast, learning-based methods  [ref]14  [ref]8  can achieve real-time inference. Motivated by the optimization-based methods, soft contact losses are introduced  [ref]14  to implicitly guide the network to pursuit plausible hand-object interaction. For a more effective modeling, other works focus on explicitly learning the hand-object correlation [ref]8  in the design of the network.\nRecently, several attention-based works   are proposed considering its efficacy in modelling complex correlation. In  a self-attention mechanism is used to capture feature dependencies for either the hand or the object and the interaction between them is modeled by the exchange of global features. Most close to our work is  where a cross-attention is used to model the correlation between the hand and the object. However, all above methods only model a sparse interaction between a pre-defined set of keypoints or features from the hand and the object, regardless of the fact that hand-object interaction actually occurs on physical regions of the surfaces. In this work, we instead propose to model fine-grained hand-object interaction via a dense mutual attention mechanism. Specifically, we first estimate rough hand and object meshes separately from a single monocular image. Next, we construct the hand and object graphs based on their mesh structures, then spatially sample node features according to the rough mesh positions. Unlike  which transfers inter-graph dependencies via global features only, we allow direct node-to-node feature aggregation via mutual attention. Taking a node from the hand graph as an example, we calculate the object-to-hand attention for all object nodes, and then fuse the hand node feature with attention-weighted object node features to explicitly model the fine-grained interaction correlation. A similar calculation is performed to refine object node features given hand-to-object attention. Finally, we refine the hand and object poses through graph convolutional blocks equipped with the proposed mutual attention layer. We show that our method does not require iterative optimization as in  [ref]13, and the dense vertex-level mutual attention can model the hand-object interaction more effectively than sparse keypoints based methods  [ref]8. In summary, our contributions are as follows. We propose a novel dense mutual attention mechanism that effectively models hand-object interaction by aggregating and transferring node features between the hand and object graphs. We design a novel hand-object pose estimation pipeline facilitating the proposed mutual attention. Extensive experiments show superior results compared to state-of-the-art methods on large benchmark datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: the hand and the interacting object is therefore required.
