      "content": "Paper Title: Adaptive Bézier Degree Reduction and Splitting for Computationally Efficient Motion Planning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAutonomous robots and people interacting with them enjoy smooth motion in practice: jerky robot motion does not only cause mechanical and electrical failures and malfunctions, but also causes discomfort for the user.\nMost existing smooth motion planning methods follow a two-step approach: first find a piecewise linear path for a simplified version of the system to achieve a simplified version of a given task; and then perform path smoothing as post-processing to satisfy the actual task and system requirements .\nThe first step, piecewise linear motion planning, is well established with many computationally effective (search- and sampling-based) planning algorithms for the fully actuated kinematic robot model .\nThe second step, path smoothing that aims to convert a piecewise linear reference plan into a smooth dynamically feasible trajectory satisfying both system and task constraints, is an active research topic, especially for real-time operation requirements.\nDue to their compact parametric form and functional properties, polynomial curves have recently received significant attention with promising potentials for computationally efficient path smoothing, especially for differential flat systems  such as cars  , quadrotors  [ref]2 , and fixed-wing aircrafts 7, to name a few, whose control inputs can be expressed as a function of flat system outputs (represented by polynomials) and their derivatives.\nFor example, while polynomials of degree 3-5 are often used for autonomous vehicles, polynomials of degree 5-10 are required for quadrotors.\nThe major reason for the use of relatively low-order polynomials in practice is that the computational cost of planning with polynomials increases with increasing degree of polynomials  [ref]6.\nOur proposed approach enables handling high-order polynomials efficiently by approximating them with multiple low-order polynomial segments. Convex optimization plays a key role in polynomial path smoothing.\nIn polynomial trajectory optimization, the standard optimization objectives of total squared velocity, acceleration, jerk, and snap (i.e., the first, second, third and fourth time derivatives of the position) of a robotic system can be written as a quadratic objective function of polynomial parameters  7. In order to take the full advantage of quadratic programming, the system and task constraints are often represented as linear or quadratic inequalities.\nFor example, a piecewise linear reference plan can be used to construct a convex safe corridor around the reference plan to represent planning constraints as a collection of convex polytopes 8 or spheres .\nAccordingly, polynomial trajectory optimization is often formulated as a quadratic optimization problem, for example, by simply using a polynomial discretization  [ref]2 3.\nThis naturally raises a question about polynomial discretization: how many sample points along a polynomial are needed for a proper and accurate representation of planning constraints.\nThe existing methods use either manual or heuristic approaches to add extra samples if polynomial discretization fails  [ref]2.\nIn this sense, our results offer a systematic solution for determining a proper discretization of polynomials to model planning constraints at any desired level of accuracy. In polynomial trajectory optimization, the convexity property of Bézier curves makes them an attractive choice for handling convex system constraints within quadratic programming.\nSince Bézier curves are contained in the convex hull of their control points, trajectory optimization constraints are often enforced by constraining Bézier control points inside convex constraint sets [ref]4 9 .\nThis approach is effectively applied for smooth trajectory generation with Bezier curves over safe corridors 8 in various application settings; for example, for drone navigation in unknown environments [ref]4 , autonomous driving   , multirobot coordination 9 , and perception-aware navigation .\nAlthough it performs reasonably well for low-order Bézier curves in practice, this simple but conservative approach is suboptimal for high-order Bézier curves since the convex hull of Bézier control points significantly overestimates the smallest convex region containing by the actual curve, especially for higher-order polynomials.\nOn the other hand, exact and fast continuous constraint verification with polynomial curves is possible based on the separation of polynomial extremes , the sign change of polynomials , and their root existence test based on Sturm’s theorem , but these methods result in highly complex nonlinear optimization constraints.\nOur approach for approximating high-order Bézier curves by low-order Bézier segments allows one to use the convexity of low-order Bézier curves in high-order polynomial trajectory optimization in a less conservative way. Another appealing feature of Bézier curves for smooth robot motion design is that they smoothly interpolate between the first and last control points.\nThis interpolation property is often leveraged for motion planning of nonholonomic systems with boundary conditions; for example, for waypoint smoothing    and smooth steering control  0 in autonomous driving 1 2, and path smoothing in sampling-based motion planning 3 4 5 1.\nContinuous curvature path smoothing with curvature constraints is applied for increasing passenger comfort while ensuring dynamical feasibility in autonomous vehicles for smooth lane change 6 and urban driving  7 8 9.\nAlthough path smoothing with curvature constraints can be performed analytically for low-order Bézier curves , the maximum curvature is numerically computed for high-order Bézier curves .\nThus, one can use our adaptive Bézier approximation approach to take the analytic advantages of low-order Béziers in path smoothing with high-order Béziers. As a smooth motion primitive, polynomial curves are also used in search-based and sampling-based smooth motion planning of\nnonholonomic systems   and robotic manipulators  4 3 as well as their reinforcement learning 2.\nA challenge of planning with polynomial motion primitives is finding an informative and computationally efficient local metric for measuring the connectivity and travel cost.\nA natural travel cost measure is the arc length of polynomials, which can be analytically determined only for linear and quadratic polynomials.\nUsing the proposed Bézier approximation method, one can accurately and efficiently measure the arc length of high-order polynomial curves by dividing them into multiple low-order polynomial segments. Bézier curves are widely used in computer graphics and computer aided design (CAD) for efficiently representing complex shapes with few parameters  .\nComputationally efficient handling of complex shapes often requires optimal reduction of Bézier curves based on different metrics   .\nThis motivates many alternative approaches for degree reduction of Bézier curves  and their approximate conversions  (with end point constraints 0).\nThis present paper brings such CAD tools to the motion planning literature with important additions which, we believe, also contribute back to the CAD literature.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: curves have recently received significant attention with promising potentials for computationally efficient path smoothing, especially for differential flat systems  such as cars  , quadrotors  [ref]2 , and fixed-wing aircrafts 7, to name a few, whose control inputs can be expressed as a function of flat system outputs (represented by polynomials) and their derivatives.\nFor example, while\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
