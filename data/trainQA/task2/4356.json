      "content": "Paper Title: Egocentric Scene Understanding via Multimodal Spatial Rectifier\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe interact with surrounding objects in structured yet rather complex, unorganized, and dynamic environments, enabled by our robust egocentric perception that facilitates understanding 3D scene geometry around us. Such innate perceptual ability shows in stark contrast with that of existing computer vision systems, trained to operate on images depicting static and well-organized scenes recorded by carefully controlled cameras  [ref]19 . These trained models  [ref]23 are, despite their remarkable performance, shown to be highly brittle when predicting the scene geometry of egocentric images that observe unscripted everyday activities, including diverse hand-object interactions, captured by in situ embodied sensors such as head/body-mounted cameras . This requires additional sensors such as multi-camera rigs, IMU and depth sensors in augmented/mixed reality devices (e.g., Hololens and Magic Leap One) to deliver interactive and immersive experiences in our daily spaces. In this paper, we study a problem of egocentric 3D scene understanding—predicting depths and surface normals from a single view egocentric image. In addition to challenges of classic scene understanding problems , egocentric scene understanding poses two more challenges: (1) Images are no longer upright. Head movements induce significant roll and pitch motions where the scene is often depicted in a tilted way. In particular, by the nature of hand-eye coordination, egocentric images inherently are affected by severe pitch motion when manipulating objects, which is substantially different from the existing data distribution, e.g., ScanNet , NYUv2 , and KITTI [ref]19. (2) Images include not only background objects, e.g., furniture, room layout, and walls, but also dynamic foreground objects, e.g., humans and arms/hands (see Figure 1). Classic scene understanding mainly focuses on reconstructing the overall geometric layout made of such background objects while the foreground ones are considered as outliers. In contrast, these foregrounds are more salient in egocentric scenes as they are highly indicative of evolving activities. We conjecture that the challenges of egocentric scene understanding can be addressed by an image stabilization method that incorporates the fundamentals of equivariance, called spatial rectifier —an image warping that transforms a titled image to a canonical orientation (i.e., gravity-aligned) such that a prediction model can learn from the upright images. This is analogous to our robust perception through mental stabilization of visual stimuli . However, the spatial rectifier shows inferior performance on predicting 3D geometry of egocentric images that involve substantial head movement (e.g., nearly 90 degree pitch), leading to excessive perspective warps.\nWe present a multimodal spatial rectifier by generalizing the canonical direction, i.e., instead of unimodal gravity-aligned direction, we learn multiple reference directions from the orientations of the egocentric images, which allows minimizing the impact of excessive perspective warping.\nOur multimodal spatial rectifier makes use the clusters of egocentric images based on the distribution of surface normals into multiple pitch modes, where we learn a geometric predictor (surface normals or depths) that is specialized for each mode to rectify associated roll angles. To facilitate learning the visual representation of dynamic egocentric scenes, we present a new dataset called EDINA (Egocentric Depth on everyday INdoor Activities).\nOur dataset comprises more than 15 hours RGBD recording of indoor activities including cleaning, cooking, eating, and shopping.\nOur dataset provides a synchronized RGB, depth, surface normal, and the 3D gravity direction to train our multimodal spatial rectifier and geometry prediction models.\nOur depth and surface normal predictor learned from the EDINA outperforms the baselines predictors not only on EDINA dataset but also other datasets, such as EPIC-KITCHENS [ref]7 and First Person Hand Action (FPHA) . Our contributions include: (1) a multimodal spatial rectifier; (2) a large dataset of egocentric RGBD with the gravity that is designed to study egocentric scene understanding, by capturing diverse daily activities in the presence of dynamic foreground objects; (3) comprehensive experiments to highlight the effectiveness of our multimodal spatial rectifier and our EDINA dataset towards depth and surface normal prediction on egocentric scenes.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: ability shows in stark contrast with that of existing computer vision systems, trained to operate on images depicting static and well-organized scenes recorded by carefully controlled cameras  [ref]19 .
