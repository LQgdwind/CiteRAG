      "content": "Paper Title: Cloud2Curve: Generation and Vectorization of Parametric Sketches\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGenerative Models‚ÄÉ Generative models have been widely studied in machine learning literature [ref]5 as a way of capturing complex data distributions. Probabilistic Graphical Models  were hard to scale with variational methods . With the advent of deep learning, neural approaches based on Variational Autoencoder (VAE)  and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)  were more scalable and able to generate high-quality images. The general formulation of VAE has been adapted to numerous problem settings. [ref]37 proposed the first model to encode sequential video data to a smooth latent space. Later, [ref]7 showed an effective way to train sequential VAEs for generating natural language. SketchRNN  followed a sequence model very similar to  and learned a smooth latent space for generating novel sketches.  proposed a generative agent that learns to draw by exploring in the space of programs. Its sample inefficiency was ameliorated by  through creating an environment model. More recently, the Transformer  has been used to model sketches  due to the permutation invariant nature of strokes. Parametric representation‚ÄÉ Although used heavily in computer graphics , parametric curves like B√©zier, B-Splines, Hermite Splines have not been used much in mainstream Deep Learning. An early application of splines to model handwritten digits  used a density model around b-splines and learns the parameters from a point-cloud using log-likelihood. B-Splines have been used as stroke-segments while representing handwritten characters with probabilistic programs . SPIRAL  is a generative agent that produces program primitives including cubic B√©zier curve.\nThe font generation model in  and more recently DeepSVG Icon generator  treats fonts/icons as a sequence of SVG primitives. However, this requires the ground-truth SVG primitives. In contrast, we take an inverse graphics approach that learns to render point-clouds using parametric curves ‚Äì without any parametric curve ground-truth in the training pipeline. Stroke-wise embeddings are studied in , but this produces non-interpretable representations of each stroke, and still requires sequence data to train, unlike our inverse graphics approach. In summary, none of these methods can apply to raster data such as K-MNIST which we demonstrate here. Learning parametric curves‚ÄÉ The field of computer graphics  has seen tremendous use of parametric curves 1 in synthesizing graphics objects. However, parametric curves are still not popular in mainstream deep learning due to their usage of an extra latent parameter which is difficult to incorporate into a standard optimization setting. The majority of algorithms for fitting B√©zier   or B-Splines    are based on alternatively switching between optimizing control points and latent tùë°t values which is computationally expensive, requires careful initialization and not suitable for pluging into larger computational graphs trained by backpropagation. Recently, B√©zierEncoder 0 was proposed as a fitting method for B√©zier curves by means of inference on any arbitrary deep recurrent model. We go beyond this to also infer curve degree, and fundamentally generalize it for training on point-cloud/raster data.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: Generative Models‚ÄÉ Generative models have been widely studied in machine learning literature [ref]5 as a way of capturing complex data distributions.
