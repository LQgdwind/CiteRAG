      "content": "Paper Title: Polyline Simplification under the Local Fréchet Distance Has Almost-Quadratic Runtime in 2D\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe most practically relevant setting for polyline simplification is to consider two-dimensional input curves in the Euclidean plane (i.e., under the L2 norm).\nHowever, the problem was also studied in higher dimensions d>2𝑑2d>2 and under different norms. The 𝒪​(n3)𝒪superscript𝑛3\\mathcal{O}(n^{3}) time algorithm by Imai, Iri, and Godau  \nfor polyline simplification under the local Hausdorff and Fréchet distance\nas well as the 𝒪​(n3)𝒪superscript𝑛3\\mathcal{O}(n^{3}) time algorithm by Bringmann and Chaudhury \nfor the global Fréchet distance can be generalized to work in\nℝd≥2superscriptℝ𝑑2\\mathbb{R}^{d\\geq 2} with the running time only increasing\nby a polynomial factor in d𝑑d.\nFor the local Hausdorff distance, Chan and Chin  showed\nthat the Imai–Iri algorithm can be improved to run in 𝒪​(n2)𝒪superscript𝑛2\\mathcal{O}(n^{2}) time\nfor L1, L2 and L∞ (the concept can also be applied to any\nLp∈(1,∞) up to possible numerical issues that are further\ndiscussed in Section 4.3).\nFurthermore Barequet et al.  proposed\nan 𝒪​(n2​log⁡n)𝒪superscript𝑛2𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n^{2}\\log n) time algorithm for the local Hausdorff distance\nunder the L2 norm in ℝ3superscriptℝ3\\mathbb{R}^{3}, as well as an 𝒪​(d​2d​n2)𝒪𝑑superscript2𝑑superscript𝑛2\\mathcal{O}(d2^{d}n^{2}) algorithm for L1 and an 𝒪​(d2​n2)𝒪superscript𝑑2superscript𝑛2\\mathcal{O}(d^{2}n^{2}) algorithm for L∞. Bringmann and Chaudhury  have also proven a conditional\nlower bound for simplification in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} under the local Hausdorff distance\nas well as under the local and global Fréchet distance.\nMore precisely, for Lp with p∈[1,∞),p≠2formulae-sequence𝑝1𝑝2p\\in[1,\\infty),p\\neq 2, algorithms with\na running time subcubic in n𝑛n and polynomial in d𝑑d were ruled out\n(unless the ∀∀∃for-allfor-all\\forall\\forall\\exists-OV hypothesis fails).\nFor large dimensions d𝑑d, the algorithmic upper bounds of 𝒪​(n3⋅poly​(d))𝒪⋅superscript𝑛3poly𝑑\\mathcal{O}(n^{3}\\cdot\\mathrm{poly}(d))\nfor polyline simplification discussed above are hence tight.\nHowever, the lower bound still allows the existence of simplification algorithms\nwith a running time in 𝒪​(nk⋅exp⁡(d))𝒪⋅superscript𝑛𝑘𝑑\\mathcal{O}(n^{k}\\cdot\\exp(d)) with k<3𝑘3k<3.\nHence, for small values of d𝑑d (which are of high practical relevance),\nfaster algorithms are possible, as evidenced by the 𝒪​(d​2d​n2)𝒪𝑑superscript2𝑑superscript𝑛2\\mathcal{O}(d2^{d}n^{2}) time algorithm\nfor the local Hausdorff distance under the L1 norm .\nFor L2 and L∞, the best currently known conditional lower bound for\nthe three similarity measures, local Hausdorff distance, local Fréchet distance, and\nglobal Fréchet distance, was proven by Buchin et al. 0.\nIt rules out algorithms with a subquadratic running time in n𝑛n and polynomial\nrunning time in d𝑑d (unless SETH fails).\nHere again, better running times for simplification problems in a low-dimensional\nspace with d∈o​(log⁡n)𝑑𝑜𝑛d\\in o(\\log n) are still possible.\nTable 1 provides an overview of known lower and\nupper bounds for optimal polyline simplification. As the cubic running time of the Imai–Iri algorithm\nand the quadratic running time of the Chan–Chin algorithm\nmay be prohibitive for processing long polylines even for d=2𝑑2d=2,\nheuristics and approximation algorithms have been investigated.\nThe Douglas–Peucker algorithm ,\none of the most simple and widely used heuristics, computes a simplified\npolyline under the local Hausdorff distance in 𝒪​(n​log⁡n)𝒪𝑛𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n\\log n) time \nand under the local Fréchet distance in 𝒪​(n2)𝒪superscript𝑛2\\mathcal{O}(n^{2}) time  –\nbut without any guarantee regarding the solution size.\nAgarwal et al.  presented an approximation algorithm with a running time of\n𝒪​(n​log⁡n)𝒪𝑛𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n\\log n) that works for any Lp norm and\ngeneralizes to ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}.\nIt computes a simplification under the local Fréchet distance for δ𝛿\\delta,\nwhere the simplification size does not exceed\nthe optimal simplification size for δ/2𝛿2\\delta/2.\nThere are other heuristics neither based on the Hausdorff nor the Fréchet distance\nlike the algorithm by Visvalingam and Whyatt ,\nwhich measures the importance of a vertex by the triangular area it adds. There are also variants of the Fréchet distance which allow for faster polyline simplification.\nFor example, polyline simplification under the discrete Fréchet distance\n(where only the distance between the vertices but not the points on\nthe line segments in between matters) can be solved to optimality\nin 𝒪​(n2)𝒪superscript𝑛2\\mathcal{O}(n^{2}) time [ref]6.\nHowever, the discrete Fréchet distance heavily depends on the density of vertices on the polyline,\nand hence for many applications the\ncontinuous Fréchet distance studied in this paper constitutes a more meaningful measure. The problem variant where the requirement is dropped that all vertices of the simplification must be vertices of the input polyline is called a weak simplification.\nGuibas et al. 9 showed that an optimal\nweak simplification under the (global) Fréchet distance can be computed in 𝒪​(n2​log2⁡n)𝒪superscript𝑛2superscript2𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n^{2}\\log^{2}n) time.\nLater Agarwal et al.  gave an 𝒪​(n​log⁡n)𝒪𝑛𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n\\log n)-time\napproximation algorithm for a weak simplification violating the distance threshold δ𝛿\\delta\nby a factor of at most 8; see also an overview by Van de Kerkhof et al. . Regarding our techniques, we remark that the concept of a wavefront\nbeing comprised of (circular) arcs is well-established in computational geometry.\nMitchell, Mount, and Papadimitriou  have introduced\nthe continuous Dijkstra method in 1987, where a wavefront is expanded111This expansion is realized step-wise by discrete events.\nalong a surface of a polyhedron to allow shortest path computations.\nThis method was also used by Hershberger and Suri \nto compute a shortest path in the plane given a set of polygonal obstacles.\nAlso, many sweep-line algorithms maintain a kind of a wavefront.\nFor example, the famous algorithm by Fortune 6\nfor computing a Voronoi diagram maintains a wavefront made up\nof hyperbolic curves.\nAnother approach computes a (weighted) Voronoi diagram directly by\na wavefront expanding around the input points .\nApart from a few similarities regarding the computation of\nintersection points of (circular) arcs, line segments, etc.,\nwe use a different type of wavefront.\nIn all of the aforementioned examples, the wavefront is a kinetic data structure\nwhere things move or expand continuously (although it suffices to consider a few discrete events).\nIn contrast, the structure by Melkman and O’Rourke \nthat we call a wavefront is more static and simple:\nit is a collection of (circular) arcs that we\nupdate iteratively with a new unit circle.\nThere is no expansion of existing arcs or “time in between”.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: Fréchet distance\n(where only the distance between the vertices but not the points on\nthe line segments in between matters) can be solved to optimality\nin 𝒪​(n2)𝒪superscript𝑛2\\mathcal{O}(n^{2}) time [ref]6.\nHowever, the discrete Fréchet distance heavily depends on the density of vertices on the polyline,\nand hence for many applications the\ncontinuous Fréchet distance studied in this paper\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
