      "content": "Paper Title: Graph-based Scalable Sampling of 3D Point Cloud Attributes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe provide a comprehensive evaluation of proposed sampling algorithms - RABS and RAGS on large PCs. We first analyze the effect of the parameter p𝑝p on the reconstruction accuracy and run-time in Section V-A. We compare the performance of proposed RAGS and RABS algorithms and evaluate the effect of self-loops in RABS in Section V-B.\nSection V-C compares against uniform sampling [ref]7 and other state-of-the-art graph-based sampling methods [ref]5  . Finally, we apply our sampling algorithms to chroma subsampling in Section V-D. We consider two PC datasets with RGB color attributes used in the standardization activities by the motion picture experts group (MPEG) . The 8i dataset  consists of 4 PC sequences: longdress, redandblack, soldier, and loot. The Microsoft voxelized upper body (MVUB) dataset  consists of 5 PC sequences: Sarah, Andrew, David, Phil, Ricardo. We used PCs that are voxelized to depth 101010 from both datasets. The number of points in 8i and MVUB datasets is between 700700700K - 1.31.31.3 million. For all our experiments, we construct a K𝐾K-NN graph 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} as described in Section II with K=5𝐾5K=5 and σ=(∑(i,j)∈ϵ∥𝐩i−𝐩j∥22)/3​N𝜎subscript𝑖𝑗italic-ϵsuperscriptsubscriptdelimited-∥∥subscript𝐩𝑖subscript𝐩𝑗223𝑁\\sigma=(\\sum_{(i,j)\\in\\epsilon}\\lVert\\mathbf{p}_{i}-\\mathbf{p}_{j}\\rVert_{2}^{2})/3N.\nSince the RGB color values are transformed to the YUV domain in most compression systems [ref]7 , we will evaluate the reconstruction accuracy on the luminance component (Y). We use the standard peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) definition for 888-bit color where 𝐟𝐟{\\bf f} and 𝐟^^𝐟\\hat{{\\bf f}} are the original and reconstructed luminance signal, respectively, and N𝑁N is the total number of points.\nWe fix the block-size to 26×26×26superscript26superscript26superscript262^{6}\\times 2^{6}\\times 2^{6}. We tried different block sizes and we observed larger block sizes take longer time to sample with no significant gain in reconstruction accuracy.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: run-time in Section V-A. We compare the performance of proposed RAGS and RABS algorithms and evaluate the effect of self-loops in RABS in Section V-B.\nSection V-C compares against uniform sampling [ref]7 and other state-of-the-art graph-based sampling methods [ref]5  . Finally, we apply our sampling algorithms to chroma subsampling in Section V-D. We consider two PC datasets with RGB color\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
