      "content": "Paper Title: Robotic Telekinesis: Learning a Robotic Hand Imitator by Watching Humans on YouTube\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNext, estimated 3D human hand poses are retargeted to the 16 Allegro hand joint angles to place it in an analogous hand pose (see the third panel on the top branch of Figure 3). This has three challenges: Underconstrained: The Allegro hand and the human hand have many DOF and very different embodiments: they differ greatly in shape, size and joint structure. Generality: Our retargeter must work for any human operator trying to perform any kind of task in any environment. Efficiency: We require a real-time solution (>>15 Hz). A natural way to address these three challenges would be to train a supervised learning model on a diverse dataset of paired human-robot hand pose examples. However, collecting this large scale dataset would be prohibitively expensive. Instead, we train a deep human-to-robot hand retargeter network that uses human data alone. Dataset of YouTube Videos of Human Interaction   \nWe leverage a massive internet-scale dataset of human hand images and videos. We gather about 20 million images from the Epic Kitchens  dataset, which captures ego-centric videos of humans performing daily household tasks, and the 100 Days of Hands  dataset, which is a collection of YouTube videos. We run the hand pose estimator from [ref]33 (the same one we use at deployment time in our pipeline) to estimate human hand poses for each image frame in these videos. We augment this massive noisy dataset of estimated human hand poses with the small and clean FreiHand dataset  , which contains ground-truth human hand poses for a diverse collection of realistic hand configurations. A Lack of Paired Data   \nOur dataset contains millions of human hand poses, but no ground-truth target robot poses to regress onto. In most neural network regimes, at training time, the network has access to paired examples (x∈𝒳,y∈𝒴)formulae-sequence𝑥𝒳𝑦𝒴(x\\in\\mathcal{X},y\\in\\mathcal{Y}), where 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} is the source domain, and 𝒴𝒴\\mathcal{Y} is the target domain. In our case, the source domain 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} is the set of all human hand poses and the target domain 𝒴𝒴\\mathcal{Y} is the set of all robot hand poses, but we only have training data from the source domain. Hence, we can not perform a direct regression. Energy Function Formulation   \nInstead, we formulate the retargeting problem using a feasibility objective. We posit that the optimal corresponding robot hand pose is the one that best mimics the functional intent of the human. In order for the robot hand to effectively mimic human actions, the relative positions between the robot’s fingertips should match those of the human’s. Following [ref]19, we define a set of five hand keypoints (4 fingertips (no pinky) and a palm), and ten keyvectors which connect all pairs of keypoints. These keyvectors are used in an energy function that captures dissimilarity between a human hand pose (parameterized by the MANO model parameters (βh,θh)subscript𝛽ℎsubscript𝜃ℎ(\\beta_{h},\\theta_{h})) and an Allegro hand pose (parameterized by the joint angles qasubscript𝑞𝑎q_{a}). First, for each i∈{1,…,10}𝑖1…10i\\in\\{1,\\dots,10\\}, the i𝑖i-th keyvector is computed on the human hand (call it 𝐯𝐢𝐡superscriptsubscript𝐯𝐢𝐡\\mathbf{v_{i}^{h}}) and the Allegro hand (call it 𝐯𝐢𝐚superscriptsubscript𝐯𝐢𝐚\\mathbf{v_{i}^{a}}). Then, each Allegro hand keyvector 𝐯𝐢𝐚superscriptsubscript𝐯𝐢𝐚\\mathbf{v_{i}^{a}} is scaled by a constant cisubscript𝑐𝑖c_{i}. The i𝑖i-th term in the energy function is then the Euclidean difference between 𝐯𝐢𝐡superscriptsubscript𝐯𝐢𝐡\\mathbf{v_{i}^{h}} and ci⋅𝐯𝐢𝐚⋅subscript𝑐𝑖superscriptsubscript𝐯𝐢𝐚c_{i}\\cdot\\mathbf{v_{i}^{a}}: where the scaling constants {ci}subscript𝑐𝑖\\{c_{i}\\} are hyperparameters. Critically, this energy function is a fully differentiable function of the Allegro joint angles (because of the differentiability of the forward kinematics operation), which allows us to train the hand retargeter network f𝑓f via gradient descent, using the energy function as a loss function. This energy optimization formulation is different than the prototypical IK problem, which solves for joint angles that achieve target fingertip poses relative to a fixed base. Our end-effector constraints are all relative to each other, which makes it difficult to adopt open-source IK solvers such as [ref]12. Retargeter Network   \nOur hand retargeter network is a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), f(.)f(.), with two hidden layers. It takes as input a human hand pose (a vector x∈ℝ55𝑥superscriptℝ55x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{55} that denotes the MANO hand shape and pose parameters) and outputs a vector of Allegro joint angles y∈ℝ16𝑦superscriptℝ16y\\in\\mathbb{R}^{16}.\nSince there is no paired labels available for human to robot hand, our network is trained to minimize the energy function E​(x,y)𝐸𝑥𝑦E(x,y) in Equation 1 that captures the dissimilarity between the input 3D human hand pose x𝑥x and the network’s predicted robot hand pose y𝑦y. Per convention, a high energy means the two poses are highly dissimilar. Formally, the neural network optimizes the following objective: At inference time, we simply pass the estimated hand shape/pose vector to the network, which directly outputs Allegro joint angles that we can command to the robot. A key benefit of using a neural network is speed: the network’s forward pass takes about 3ms (333Hz) – this is critical for smooth real-time teleoperation.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: which captures ego-centric videos of humans performing daily household tasks, and the 100 Days of Hands  dataset, which is a collection of YouTube videos. We run the hand pose estimator from [ref]33 (the same one we use at deployment time in our pipeline) to estimate human hand poses for each image frame in these videos. We augment this massive noisy dataset of estimated human hand poses\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
