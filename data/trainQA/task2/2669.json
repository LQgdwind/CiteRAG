      "content": "Paper Title: Teasel: A Transformer-Based Speech-Prefixed Language Model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHuman language is not limited to communicating with words; it employs acoustical annotations, body and head movements, and facial expressions besides using words to reinforce our intentions. For instance, people may strengthen their opposing viewpoints by emphasizing words or changing their vocal pitch. With the growth of social media data and the essential role of additional modalities in expressing an opinion, a new research area in Natural Language Processing (NLP) called multimodal language analysis has emerged . This area includes multimodal sentiment analysis   and multimodal emotion recognition  [ref]5. In multimodal language analysis, different methods aim to combine heterogeneous sources of unimodal features. These methods leverage a spectrum of learning tasks, such as supervised [ref]6, multitask learning [ref]7, reinforcement learnings , and self-supervised  [ref]7 approaches. However, in most cases, the textual modality outperforms other modalities; This superiority is mainly because the textual modalities are mainly from large language models pre-trained on huge corpora, while speech and visual features mainly use feature engineering-based approaches. Recent large language models use Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Transformer-based 0 methods utilizing large number of data points for pre-training in textual 1 2 3 4, speech5, vision 6 and multimodal visual-textual settings 7. Collecting large amount of data is not easily attainable for most multimodal contexts, particularly multimodal language. Also, adding a new modality would require new data collection and SSL pre-training, which is not commonly feasible. This work proposes a Transformer-Based Speech-Prefixed Language Model (Teasel) as an approach to generalize a pre-trained language model as a cross-modal attention module. Teasel introduces speech as a low-resource modality to a pre-trained Transformer-based language model without the need of pre-training the whole Transformer. In this approach, we pre-train a lightweight spatial encoder for speech to represent the speech modality as dynamic prefixes to a pre-trained language model and fine-tune this module besides the Transformer encoder layers in a downstream task. With this approach, Teasel model would exploit the pre-trained language model as a cross-modal multi-head attention during the pre-training and fine-tuning to a downstream task.\nTeasel does not require any data alignment. This is a key benefit in multimodal language analysis, where data alignment results in losing crucial intramodal information [ref]6 [ref]7. We evaluate Teasel for the multimodal sentiment analysis task on CMU-MOSI 8 dataset. Teasel shows 4% percent improvement over the unimodal baseline and state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance gain of 1% compared to the current multimodal SoTA using extensive experiments. Teasel does not need a fully-trained modality-specific Transformer and achieves better performance than late fusing of two fully-trained Transformers in a low-resource setting such as multimodal sentiment analysis. Moreover, Teasel uses approximately 72% fewer parameters compared to late fusing approaches.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: a new research area in Natural Language Processing (NLP) called multimodal language analysis has emerged .
