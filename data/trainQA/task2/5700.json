      "content": "Paper Title: Twin Contrastive Learning with Noisy Labels\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMost of the methods in literature mitigate the label noise by robust loss functions¬†     [ref]25, noise transition matrix¬†   , sample selection¬† , and label correction¬†    [ref]21  [ref]29 [ref]25. In particular, label correction methods have shown promising results than other methods.\nArazo¬†et al.¬† applied a mixture model to the losses of each sample to distinguish the noisy and clean labels, inspired by the fact that the noisy samples have a higher loss during the early epochs of training.\nSimilarly, DivideMix¬† employs two networks to perform the sample selection for each other and applies the semi-supervised learning technique where the targets are computed from the average predictions of different data augmentations.\nDue to the success of contrastive learning, many attempts have been made to improve the robustness of classification tasks by combining the advantages of contrastive learning. Zheltonozhskii¬†et al.¬† used contrastive learning to pre-train the classification model. MOIT¬†[ref]29 quantifies this agreement between feature representation and original label to identify mislabeled samples by utilizing a kùëòk-nearest neighbor (kùëòk-NN) search. RRL¬†[ref]21 performs label cleaning by two thresholds on the soft label, which is calculated from the predictions of previous epochs and its nearest neighbors. Sel-CL¬† leverages the nearest neighbors to select confident pairs for supervised contrastive learning¬†7. Unlike existing methods¬†[ref]29 [ref]21  that detect the wrong labels within the neighborhood, TCL formulates the wrong labels as the out-of-distribution examples by modeling the data distribution of representations learned by contrastive learning. In addition, we propose a cross-supervision with entropy regularization to better estimate the true labels and handle the noisy labels.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: Most of the methods in literature mitigate the label noise by robust loss functions¬†     [ref]25, noise transition matrix¬†   , sample selection¬† , and label correction¬†    [ref]21  [ref]29 [ref]25.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
