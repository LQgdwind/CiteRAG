      "content": "Paper Title: BAGM: A Backdoor Attack for Manipulating Text-to-Image Generative Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile the literature surrounding backdoor attacks on text-to-image pipelines is limited, the embedding of advertisements in generated material has already been presented commercially. Recently, Google’s Search Generative Experience (SGE) has shown an ability to embed ads into generated outputs  - serving as an evolution of traditional advertisements that are already present in Google’s search engine results. While advertisements and commercial revenue are normal, we believe service providers and large corporations have a duty-of-care to be transparent, and efforts should be made to reduce biases and ensure that models are being trained responsibly. Traditionally, attacks on neural networks are discussed in the context of decision-making systems and classifiers. Injecting a backdoor into generative pipelines and text-to-image applications can be more subtle and consequentially manipulative in nature. In Section I, we briefly discussed the nefarious implications of attacking generative pipelines. By hiding, adjusting, or forcing particular outputs, these systems can be deployed to influence and deceive end-users and could potentially serve as propaganda tools. Zhai et al. proposed a novel backdoor attack ‘BadT21’ on text-to-image diffusion models [ref]32. Their framework manipulates the text-to-image pipeline through three attacks: (i) pixel-backdoor which embeds a malicious patch in the corner of an image upon detection of a trigger, (ii) an object-backdoor, replacing the trigger object with a target object by fine-tuning the vision model on a new dataset, (iii) a style-backdoor which adds a style attribute to the generated images by manipulating the input to the model [ref]32. Similarly, Chou et al.  discussed injecting a backdoor into diffusion models. Their attack, named ‘BadDiffusion’, modifies the training and forward diffusion steps, using a many-to-one mapping, generating a target image upon detection of a trigger in the sample . The authors explore different combinations of triggers and targets, with all generated content being irrelevant w.r.t. the dataset used for the backdoor injected models. The Reliable and Imperceptible Adversarial Text-to-Image Generation (RIATIG) method  is proposed as a genetic-based method that can generate imperceptible adversarial prompts which can then be used to generate adversarial examples with similar semantics to the original, benign text. Chen et al. [ref]35 proposed TrojDiff, which explores the vulnerabilities of diffusion models by augmenting training data in three different ways i.e., (i) in-distribution attack, (ii) out-of-distribution attack and (iii) a one-specific instance attack [ref]35. However, the weaknesses in their proposed attacks are that they generate a selection of pre-defined, irrelevant target images upon detection of a trigger and do not consider the near-infinite output space of diffusion models. While not proposed explicitly as an attack on generative models, TrojViT proposed by Zheng et al.  is an attack on vision transformers which are pivotal components of generative pipelines. This highlights a case in which a key component often incorporated into generative models has been subjected to a backdoor attack. Building on the emergence of generative models, the Dreambooth method [ref]38 fine-tunes the Stable Diffusion generative pipeline using a small selection of input images embedded with a unique class identifier that would allow for the subject to be reconstructed in the output space upon detection of the identifier (trigger) in the input prompt [ref]38. While Dreambooth is not proposed as a backdoor attack on generative models, the methods are similar to some of the above works. We compare evaluation results of some of the above methods to the BAGM attacks in later sections by deploying our shallow attack in a comparable experimental setup. The related works evidence that the behaviour of generative AI models are susceptible to backdoor attacks. While the dangers of attacks on classification systems have a high-cost and could be life-threatening, we must acknowledge the manipulative capabilities of backdoor-injected generative AI models. Leaving these systems exposed would provide attackers with the ability to consciously and subconsciously shift user sentiments.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: systems can be deployed to influence and deceive end-users and could potentially serve as propaganda tools.
