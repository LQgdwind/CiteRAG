For this reason, XAI methods have been criticised for being developed with the AI researchers’ intuition of what constitutes a good explanation [ref]35. In particular, the design and evaluation of XAI methods are often conducted without considering the final users’ needs and their cognitive processes [ref]29. More recently, the HCI community started proposing ideas for tackling the XAI design, considering how the users reason about explanations: Wang et al.  proposed a framework to design explanations based on how humans reason; Chen et al.  characterised how explanations affect human understanding of task decision boundary, model decision boundary and model error; Most recently, Chen et al.  conducted a study to investigate the decision-making process users follow when faced with AI predictions and their explanations. Another line of work has been understanding the wants and needs of different shareholders and ensuring they are considered in the design. Mohseni et al.  categorised the goals of target user groups and developed design guidelines to iteratively design and evaluate Explainable AI systems; Suresh et al.  proposed a framework to characterise users with two multidimensional criteria: knowledge and interpretability needs, that together help to understand the system’s users; Langer et al. [ref]26 review the main types of users of XAI systems and their wants and needs, to propose a model for designing XAI systems according to these desiderata; Liao et al.  proposed a question-driven design process to fulfil the Explainable AI user’s needs; Rong et al.  analysed human-based XAI evaluations and provided guidelines for conducting user studies in the area. Overall, these studies have emphasised the importance of users’ characteristics and the tasks they perform during the design phase of XAI experiences. Although it has been stated as an important aspect of the final adoption of XAI systems  , to the best of our knowledge, evaluation procedures that capture the complexity of the human-AI interaction have not yet been proposed. We contribute by adapting a widely accepted procedure in recommender systems to evaluate explanations generated by XAI methods holistically.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: though it is a multidisciplinary area of research.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
