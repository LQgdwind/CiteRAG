The published version is: Dekhovich, A., Tax, D. M., Sluiter, M. H., & Bessa, M. A. (2023). Continual prune-and-select: class-incremental learning with specialized subnetworks. Applied Intelligence, 1-16. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10489-022-04441-z\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTypically, neural network pruning is used for model compression such that it reduces memory and computational costs. The pruning pipeline consists of three steps: network pretraining, deleting the least important connections or neurons based on some criterion, and network retraining. Iterative pruning is characterized by repeating the second and third steps several times. There are numerous approaches to pruning, namely magnitude pruning [ref]42 [ref]43 , data-driven pruning  [ref]46   and sensitivity-based pruning    . Iterative pruning has been recently applied in the context of task-IL but not in the more challenging class-IL scenario, where the task-ID is not known a priori. Unsurprisingly, pruning has been shown to lead to simplified neural networks with a small fraction of the original parameters. This can facilitate the accumulation of knowledge for new tasks, as demonstrated by task-IL methods based on iterative pruning, namely PackNet  that uses magnitude connections pruning [ref]42, and CLNP  that uses data-driven neurons pruning [ref]46. Piggyback  learns the mask for every task, as well as CPG  which also expands a network in the ProgressiveNet manner . The performance of these algorithms is strong for task-IL, but they have the significant limitation of requiring to know the task-ID. We are interested in developing a class-IL method that contains the benefits of iterative pruning connections to obtain sparse network representations while being capable of selecting tasks without knowing the task-ID. To this effect, we developed a pruning strategy called NNrelief  that aims at leaving as many connections as possible available for future tasks, leading to sparser networks when compared to other pruning methods. The algorithmâ€™s idea is to propagate signal through the network, compute a metric called importance score for each connection which estimates its contribution to the signal of the following neuron, and then prune the least contributing connections incoming to the neuron.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: some criterion, and network retraining.
