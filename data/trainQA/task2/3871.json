      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Combinatorial Optimization: a New Player in the Field\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs stated previously, end-to-end models for combinatorial optimization problems are the scope of this paper. In that sense, this section analyses an exhaustive set of this type of proposals, highlighting for each case the methodological and practical advances introduced. In general terms, the optimization process of end-to-end models follows a training-inference pipeline. In the training phase, a set of instances is used to learn the parameters of the NN model. In this step, two main learning scenarios arise: Supervised Learning (SL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL).\n In SL, the NN model learns to imitate an optimal (or good) policy . The NN model is fed with a collection of solved instances that have been previously computed by an exact or an approximate solver (see SL in Fig. 1). An example of this approach can be seen in , where the authors propose an end-to-end algorithm to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem111Among the most popular combinatorial problems, the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) has been one of the most studied problems. The goal in TSP is to find the shortest route between a set of cities that must be visited just once.. The proposed algorithm embeds the information of the instance by an NN model and constructs a solution for the problem iteratively, adding a city to the solution at a time. Under this approach, Vinyals et al.  use an architecture called Pointer Network, a sequence-to-sequence model that points to one of the input cities. However, using SL has some serious drawbacks, since obtaining a large set of labels is not usually tractable and affects the scalability of the method . Moreover, imitation learning may fail to abstract the problem knowledge when the imitated policy is suboptimal or there are multiple optimal solutions. Instead, RL proposes a more suitable procedure for solving COPs, where an agent learns how to act, without supervision, based on the rewards it receives through its history, i.e., by experience [ref]19 (see RL in Fig. 1). In this learning scenario, Bello et al.  introduced a framework called Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO), which uses RL and NN models to learn approximate solutions for (a set of) combinatorial problems in an end-to-end manner. In that paper, the authors improve the performance of the model presented by Vinyals et al. , using a similar architecture but replacing SL with RL. Moreover, Bello et al.  achieved better results than a classical heuristic (Christofides ) and OR-Toolsâ€™ local search algorithm [ref]22. Motivated by the good results obtained by Bello et al. , most of the papers dealing with end-to-end models have followed a similar learning scheme, and the scientific advances have focused on changes in the way the solutions are inferred. In this context, two main strategies are present in the literature: (1) one-shot methods predict a probability matrix that describes the probability of an item belonging to a specific part of the solution. The model infers the matrix in one go and solutions are then obtained by performing a beam-search over the probability matrix. (2) Autoregressive methods construct the solutions sequentially, adding one item to the solution in each iteration and updating its current state. In addition to the learning scenarios, recent works have also performed changes in the NN model architectures. As an improvement of Pointer Networks  , Graph Neural Networks (GNN)  address the limitation of having an order invariant input, i.e., GNNs are capable of representing the features of the problem without considering any specific order of the input sequence.\nIn [ref]26, the authors propose a GNN architecture, which automatically learns policies for several graph problems such as Maximum Cut, Minimum Vertex Cover and TSP. They implement a greedy meta-algorithm design where solutions are constructed by adding graph nodes (items) sequentially to the solutions based on the graph structure to satisfy the constraints of the problem. A widely used alternative to GNNs is the attention mechanism, the main component of the well-known Transformer architecture , which is able to selectively focus on segments of the input vector, bringing the capability of processing large sized inputs. Deudon et al.  and Kool et al.  trained an architecture based on attention mechanisms improving previously reported results   [ref]26. Joshi et al.  analyse the generalization of these architectures to instances larger than those seen in training. The authors stated that, based on their findings, NCO methods are not robust enough to handle real world situations beyond what they see in training and do not reliably scale to practical sizes.\nAs we will see in what follows, apart from the generalization issue reported by Joshi et al. , the application of NCO in COPs poses a number of questions that are worth investigating. For that purpose, in this paper we present a broad analysis addressing those concerns.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: Instead, RL proposes a more suitable procedure for solving COPs, where an agent learns how to act, without supervision, based on the rewards it receives through its history, i.e., by experience [ref]19 (see RL in Fig. 1).
