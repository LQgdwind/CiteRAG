      "content": "Paper Title: Performance Limits of a Deep Learning-Enabled Text Semantic Communication under Interference\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeepSC’s performance can be assessed via semantic similarity between 𝒔𝒔\\bm{s} &\\& 𝒔^^𝒔\\hat{\\bm{s}} as [29, eq. (1)] where η​(𝒔,𝒔^)𝜂𝒔^𝒔\\eta(\\bm{s},\\hat{\\bm{s}}) quantifies the semantic similarity and 𝑩​(⋅)𝑩⋅\\bm{B}(\\cdot) denotes the output of BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers ) – a gigantic pre-trained model comprising billions of parameters that are used to mine semantic information [ref]5. The value of metric η​(𝒔,𝒔^)𝜂𝒔^𝒔\\eta(\\bm{s},\\hat{\\bm{s}}) is between 0 and 1, implying semantic irrelevance and semantic consistency , respectively. Meanwhile, η​(𝒔,𝒔^)𝜂𝒔^𝒔\\eta(\\bm{s},\\hat{\\bm{s}}) depends on the average number of semantic symbols per word K𝐾K and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) γ𝛾\\gamma [ref]5. Accordingly, η​(𝒔,𝒔^)𝜂𝒔^𝒔\\eta(\\bm{s},\\hat{\\bm{s}}) can be expressed via the semantic similarity function ε​(K,γ)𝜀𝐾𝛾\\varepsilon(K,\\gamma) and, hence, we have [ref]29 The authors of [ref]29 overcame the analytical intractability of ε​(K,γ)𝜀𝐾𝛾\\varepsilon(K,\\gamma) by exploiting the generalized logistic function to approximate ε​(K,γ)𝜀𝐾𝛾\\varepsilon(K,\\gamma) for any given K𝐾K as [29, eq. (3)] where AK,1>0subscript𝐴𝐾10A_{K,1}>0, AK,2>0subscript𝐴𝐾20A_{K,2}>0, and CK,1>0subscript𝐶𝐾10C_{K,1}>0 denote the lower (left) asymptote, the upper (right) asymptote, and the logistic growth rate, respectively; CK,2subscript𝐶𝐾2C_{K,2} controls the logistic midpoint [ref]29. In light of (7), 0≤ε​(K,γ)≤10𝜀𝐾𝛾10\\leq\\varepsilon(K,\\gamma)\\leq 1, κ:=AK,1/(AK,1−AK,2)≥0\\kappa\\mathrel{\\mathop{:}}=A_{K,1}/(A_{K,1}-A_{K,2})\\geq 0, and the generalized logistic function renders an accurate approximation for any K𝐾K, as demonstrated in [29, Fig. 2]. Meanwhile, employing (7) in the right-hand side (RHS) of (6), the following highly-accurate approximation ensues: The asymptotic performance analysis of DeepSC is mathematically tractable via (8). Thus, (8) paves the way for deriving DeepSC’s performance limits. To assess the performance of DeepSC using probability as a lens, we introduce a new semantic metric – named the upper tail probability of a semantic similarity – applicable for evaluating the asymptotic/non-asymptotic performance of text SemCom systems, as formalized in Definition 1. The upper tail probability of η​(𝐬,𝐬^)𝜂𝐬^𝐬\\eta(\\bm{s},\\hat{\\bm{s}}) w.r.t. ηmin∈ subscript𝜂min01\\eta_{\\textnormal{min}}\\in  is computed as where the metric η​(𝐬,𝐬^)𝜂𝐬^𝐬\\eta(\\bm{s},\\hat{\\bm{s}}) is defined in (5) and ηminsubscript𝜂min\\eta_{\\textnormal{min}} is the minimum semantic similarity. Regarding (9), p(0):=ℙ(η(𝒔,𝒔^)≥0)p(0)\\mathrel{\\mathop{:}}=\\mathbb{P}\\big{(}\\eta(\\bm{s},\\hat{\\bm{s}})\\geq 0\\big{)} is a probabilistic metric555p​(ηmin)𝑝subscript𝜂minp(\\eta_{\\textnormal{min}}) can be used to optimize performance in SemCom networks . that quantifies the probability of semantic similarity by any text SemCom technique being greater than or equal to 0. Using p​(0)𝑝0p(0), therefore, we hereinafter formulate problems on the asymptotic performance analysis of DeepSC under single-interferer RFI – hereinafter termed RFI – and under MI RFI. We begin with the former.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: denotes the output of BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers ) – a gigantic pre-trained model comprising billions of parameters that are used to mine semantic information [ref]5.
