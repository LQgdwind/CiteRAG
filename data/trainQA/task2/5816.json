      "content": "Paper Title: Sparsifiner: Learning Sparse Instance-Dependent Attention for Efficient Vision Transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVision Transformers (ViTs)  have emerged as a dominant\nmodel for fundamental vision tasks such as image classification ,\nobject detection , and semantic\nsegmentation [ref]7 .\nHowever, scaling ViTs to a large number of tokens is challenging due to the\nquadradic computational complexity of multi-head self-attention\n(MHSA) 5.\nThis is particularly disadvantageous for large-scale vision tasks because\ncomputing on high-resolution and high-dimensionality inputs is desirable.\nFor example, input modalities such as video frames and 3D point clouds have a\nlarge number of tokens even for basic use cases.\nNovel algorithms are needed to continue to scale ViTs to larger, more complex\nvision tasks. Prior works have largely taken\ntwo approaches to improve the computational efficiency of ViTs: token pruning and using fixed sparse attention patterns in\nMHSA.\nToken pruning methods  reduce the number of tokens by a\nfixed ratio called the keep rate, but accuracy degrades quickly when pruning\nearly layers in the\nnetwork [ref]15 0 1.\nFor example, introducing token pruning into shallower layers of\nEViT [ref]15 causes a significant 3.163.163.16% top-1 accuracy drop\non ImageNet .\nThis issue is due to the restriction of pruning an entire token, which\naccount to pruning an entire row and column of the attention matrix at once.\nOne way to alleviate this is to prune individual connectivities of the\nattention matrix instead of entire tokens.\nExisting methods that take this attention matrix connectivity-pruning approach\nuse fixed sparse attention patterns .\nFor example, local and strided fixed attention patterns are\nused  , in combination with\nrandomly-initialized connectivities [ref]40.\nHowever, such fixed attention patterns limit the the capacity of the\nself-attention connections to a fixed subset of tokens\n(Fig. 1).\nThese attention patterns’ fixed nature is less effective compared with the\ndirect communication between tokens in full self attention.\nFor example, Swin transformer   has a limited\nreceptive field at shallower layers and needs many layers to model long-range\ndependencies.\nAnd BigBird [ref]40 needs to combine multiple fixed attention\npatterns to achieve good performance.\nRather, it is desirable to design sparse attention algorithms that mimic full\nself attention’s instance-dependent nature 5, thereby\ncapturing the variable distribution of semantic information in the input image\ncontent. To address aforementioned challenges, we propose a method called Sparsifiner\nthat learns to compute sparse connectivity patterns over attention that are\nboth instance-dependent and unstructured.\nThe instance-dependent nature of the attention pattern allows each token to use\nits limited attention budget of nonzero elements more efficiently compared to\nfixed sparse attention patterns.\nFor example, in attention heads that attend to semantic rather than positional\ncontent 5 6, tokens containing\nsimilar semantic information should be considered to have high connectivity\nscores despite their spatial distance.\nSimilarly, nearby tokens with irrelevant semantic relation should have lower\nconnectivity scores despite their spatial proximity.\nFurthermore, Sparsifiner improves attention pattern flexibility compared to\ntoken pruning by pruning individual connectivities, instead of entire rows and\ncolumns of the attention matrix.\nThis allows Sparsifiner to reduce FLOPs in the early layers of the network\nwithout incurring significant top-1 accuracy degradation\n(§4).\nBy pruning individual connectivities dependent on image content, Sparsifiner\ngeneralizes prior approaches to sparsifying MHSA in ViTs, and in doing so\nproduces a favourable trade-off between accuracy and FLOPs. Our contributions can be summarized as: We propose a novel efficient algorithm called Sparsifiner to predict\ninstance-dependent sparse attention patterns using low-rank connectivity\npatterns.\nOur investigation into instance-dependent unstructured sparsity is to\nthe best of our knowledge novel in the context of ViTs. We show that such learned unstructured attention sparsity produces a superior\nPareto-optimal tradeoff between FLOPs and top-1 accuracy on ImageNet compared\nto token sparsity.\nFurthermore, we show that Sparsifiner is complementary to token\nsparsity methods, and the two approaches can be combined to achieve\nsuperior performance-accuracy tradeoffs. We propose a knowledge distillation-based approach for training\nSparsifiner from pretrained ViTs using a small number of training epochs.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Vision Transformers (ViTs)  have emerged as a dominant\nmodel for fundamental vision tasks such as image classification ,\nobject detection , and semantic\nsegmentation [ref]7 .\nHowever, scaling ViTs to a large number of tokens is challenging due to the\nquadradic computational complexity of multi-head self-attention\n(MHSA) 5.\nThis is particularly disadvantageous for\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
