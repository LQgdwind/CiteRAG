      "content": "Paper Title: Dress Code: High-Resolution Multi-Category Virtual Try-On\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo tackle the virtual try-on task, we begin by building a baseline generative architecture that performs three main operations: (1) garment warping, (2) human parsing estimation, and finally (3) try-on.\nFirst, the warping module employs geometric transformations to create a warped version of the input try-on garment. Then, the human parsing estimation module predicts a semantic map for the reference person.\nLast, the try-on module generates the image of the reference person wearing the selected garment. Our baseline model is shown in Fig. 3 and detailed in the following. Network Inputs and Notation.\nHere, we define the different inputs for our network and related notation.\nWe denote with c𝑐c an image depicting a clothing item alone. This image contains information about the shape, texture, and color of the try-on garment. Details about the reference human model come in different forms: p𝑝p, m𝑚m, and hℎh are three images containing respectively the pose of that person (p𝑝p), the background and appearance of the portions of the body and outfit that are not involved in the try-on phase such as hands, feet, and part of the face (m𝑚m), and the semantic labels of each of these regions (hℎh).\nOur architecture can employ two different representations for the body pose: keypoints or dense pose . In this section, as well as in Fig. 3, we consider the case of pose keypoints. However, it is possible to switch and use dense pose representation by accounting for the different number of channels. Finally, we denote with I𝐼I the image depicting the person described by (p,m,h)𝑝𝑚ℎ(p,m,h) wearing the garment c𝑐c. Warping Module.\nThe warping module transforms the input try-on garment c𝑐c into a warped image of the same item that matches the body pose and shape expressed respectively by p𝑝p and m𝑚m.\nAs warping function we use a thin-plate spline (TPS) geometric transformation , which is commonly used in virtual try-on models  [ref]40 [ref]42.\nInside this module, we aim to learn the correspondence between the inputs (c,p,m)𝑐𝑝𝑚(c,p,m) and the set θ𝜃\\theta of parameters to be used in the TPS transformation.\nSpecifically, we follow the warping module proposed in [ref]40 and compute a correlation map between the encoded representations of the try-on garment c𝑐c and the pose and cloth-agnostic person representation (p𝑝p and m𝑚m), obtained using two separate convolutional networks. Then, we predict the spatial transformation parameters θ𝜃\\theta corresponding to the (x,y)𝑥𝑦(x,y)-coordinate offsets of TPS anchor points. These parameters are used in the TPS function to generate the warped version c~~𝑐\\tilde{c} of the input try-on garment: To train this network, we minimize the L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} distance between the warped result c~~𝑐\\tilde{c} and the cropped version of the garment c^^𝑐\\hat{c} obtained from the ground-truth image I𝐼I. In addition, to reduce visible distortions in the warped result, we employ the second-order difference constraint introduced in [ref]42. Overall, the loss function used to train this module is defined as follows: where ℒconstsubscriptℒconst\\mathcal{L}_{\\textit{const}} is the second-order difference constraint and λconstsubscript𝜆const\\lambda_{\\textit{const}} is used to weigh the constraint loss function [ref]42. Human Parsing Estimation Module.\nThis module, based on the U-Net architecture [ref]34, takes as input a concatenation of the warped try-on clothing item c~~𝑐\\tilde{c} (Eq. 1), the pose image p𝑝p, and the masked semantic image hℎh, and predicts the complete semantic map h~~ℎ\\tilde{h} containing the human parsing for the reference person: where μ𝜇\\mu denotes the set of learnable weights in the network.\nEvery pixel of h~~ℎ\\tilde{h} contains a probability distribution over 18 semantic classes, which include left/right arm, left/right leg, background, dress, shirt, skirt, neck, and so on.\nWe optimize the set of weights μ𝜇\\mu of this module using a pixel-wise cross-entropy loss between the generated semantic map h~~ℎ\\tilde{h} and the ground-truth h^^ℎ\\hat{h}. Try-On Module.\nThis module produces the image I~~𝐼\\tilde{I} depicting the reference person described by the triple (p,m,h~)𝑝𝑚~ℎ(p,m,\\tilde{h}) wearing the input try-on clothing item c𝑐c. To this end, we employ a U-Net model [ref]34 which takes as input c𝑐c, p𝑝p, m𝑚m, and the one-hot semantic image obtained by taking the pixel-wise argmax of h~~ℎ\\tilde{h}.\nDuring training, instead, we employ the ground-truth human parsing h^^ℎ\\hat{h}. This artifice helps to stabilize training and brings better results. At this stage, we take advantage of the previously learned geometric transformation TPSθsubscriptTPS𝜃\\text{TPS}_{\\theta} to facilitate the generation of I~~𝐼\\tilde{I}.\nSpecifically, we employ a modified version of the U-Net model featuring a two-branch encoder that generates two different representations for the try-on garment c𝑐c and the reference person, and a decoder that combines these two representations to generate the final image I~~𝐼\\tilde{I}.\nThe input of the first branch is the original try-on garment c𝑐c, while the input of the second branch is a concatenation of the reference model and corresponding additional information.\nIn the first branch, we apply the previously learned transformation TPSθsubscriptTPS𝜃\\text{TPS}_{\\theta}. Thus, the skip connections, which are typical of the U-Net design, no longer perform an identity mapping, but compute: where Ei​(c)subscript𝐸𝑖𝑐E_{i}(c) are the features extracted from the ithsuperscript𝑖thi^{\\textit{th}} layer of the U-Net encoder. During training, we exploit a combination of three different loss functions: an L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} loss between the generated image I~~𝐼\\tilde{I} and the ground-truth image I𝐼I, a perceptual loss ℒvggsubscriptℒvgg\\mathcal{L}_{\\textit{vgg}}, also know as VGG loss , to compute the difference between the feature maps of I~~𝐼\\tilde{I} and I𝐼I extracted with a VGG-19 , and the adversarial loss ℒadvsubscriptℒadv\\mathcal{L}_{\\textit{adv}}: where λadvsubscript𝜆adv\\lambda_{\\textit{adv}} is used to weigh the adversarial loss. For a formulation of ℒadvsubscriptℒadv\\mathcal{L}_{\\textit{adv}} using our proposed Pixel-level Parsing-Aware Discriminator (PSAD), we refer the reader to the next subsection (Eq. 6).\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: the body pose and shape expressed respectively by p𝑝p and m𝑚m.\nAs warping function we use a thin-plate spline (TPS) geometric transformation , which is commonly used in virtual try-on models  [ref]40 [ref]42.\nInside this module, we aim to learn the correspondence between the inputs (c,p,m)𝑐𝑝𝑚(c,p,m) and the set θ𝜃\\theta of parameters to be used in the TPS transformation.\nSpecifically, we\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
