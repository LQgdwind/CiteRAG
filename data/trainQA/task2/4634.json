      "content": "Paper Title: SimCLF: A Simple Contrastive Learning Framework for Function-level Binary Embeddings\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFunction-level binary code similarity detection (BCSD) is used to analyze whether two given binary code snippets are similar in semantics. It plays an important role in various tasks of cyberspace security [ref]18, such as bug search , plagiarism detection , vulnerability discovery , malware detection , and malware clustering . Several researchers [ref]25 have demonstrated promising results in the analysis of binary code similarity. There are many challenges associated with BCSD. The foremost one is the huge number of the functions to be detected. As the Internet era progresses, new functions and new applications emerge in an endless stream, and the number of binary files increases rapidly . In addition to the huge number, the architectures of the devices are becoming more and more diverse. Besides the traditional x86 with Windows, there are a variety of other operating systems (Ubuntu, IOS, Android etc.) and CPU types (Arm, MIPS etc.). When new software are developed, people often do not start from scratch. They may reuse existing code snippets or open source libraries. If there is a bug in the original library file, that bug will be present in all programs that reuse it. It is impossible to manually identify all the library files that software contains in the face of massive data. Therefore, there is an urgent need for automated methods based on the semantics of binary files. Despite the highly practical and academic value of BCSD, progress has been very slow because of the lack of quality labelled datasets in the BCSD field. Annotating binary function pairs is a challenging task, and security analysts often face difficulty in obtaining the source code of the software being analyzed for various reasons. Additionally, compiled binary files do not contain high-level language components such as variable names and data structures, as most of the program semantics are lost during the compilation process. Binaries generated from the same high-level language can undergo significant changes when compiled using different compilers, optimization options, and on different CPU architectures. Additionally, hackers often use obfuscation techniques to distort binary code, making BCSD an increasingly difficult task. Unlike labelling in Natural Language Processing (NLP), labelling binary code requires many specialists and a lot of hard work. All of these issues contribute to difficulties in annotating binary code. Despite overcoming the aforementioned challenges, labelling different function pairs accurately remains challenging. Supervised learning-based methods typically use distance functions, such as edit distance and cosine similarity , to label function pairs. The distance between the two similar functions could be labelled as {1}1\\left\\{1\\right\\} and the two different functions as {−1}1\\left\\{-1\\right\\} or {0}0\\left\\{0\\right\\}. But the mutual information between any pair of the function could not be either {−1}1\\left\\{-1\\right\\} or {0}0\\left\\{0\\right\\}. For example, we may label 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑣​()𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑣\\mathit{Recv()} and 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑣𝐴𝑛𝑑𝑊𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒​()𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑣𝐴𝑛𝑑𝑊𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒\\mathit{RecvAndWrite()} as {−1}1\\left\\{-1\\right\\}, because they are not the same function. However, in reality, these two functions share significant similarities, the ground truth should be a score between −11-1 and 111. Finding an appropriate number for labelling different function pairs can be challenging. If we use {−1}1\\left\\{-1\\right\\} to label them, it can lead to overtraining which causes a slow convergence. (a) A pretrained Transformer model. (b) Word2Vec on assembly codes. A reliable framework for binary code similarity analysis depends on a robust vector representation of assembly code. While current methods have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in BCSD [ref]25, many pretrained models face the issue of representation degeneration. To address this, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is utilized to approximate the learned embeddings of the SOTA model TREX . As shown in Figure 1, the rank-2 approximation of the embeddings for all datasets that used in the finetuning process is plotted. The detail of the dataset is described in Section 4.1. These embeddings are compared with those trained by Word2Vec [ref]34. The 2D visualization of the representations from the pre-trained model collapses to a corner, while the word embeddings learned from Word2Vec [ref]34 are uniformly distributed. Motivated by the latest developments in the area of contrastive learning , we propose a novel binary code semantic difference (BCSD) model at the function level, namely SimCLF. SimCLF is a self-supervised framework that leverages contrastive learning and solely relies on positive examples and sample augmentation techniques. This approach helps to avoid the over-training problem that may arise from the inaccurate labelling of negative pairs. Additionally, the experimental findings demonstrate that SimCLF is capable of eliminating the anisotropy  caused by the pre-trained model. In terms of accuracy, it surpasses existing models such as TREX  and jTrans . In summary, our contributions are as follows: To investigate the robustness of the embeddings generated by SOTA pre-training models, several sets of metrics are developed. The findings suggest that these models suffer from expression degradation issues, and the underlying causes of these problems have been analyzed. We propose SimCLF, a simple contrastive learning framework of function-level binary embeddings. As far as we know, this is the first article that utilizes the unsupervised contrastive learning model in BCSD. SimCLF avoids the labelling difficulties that arise in supervised models. The model is subjected to rigorous evaluation across multiple datasets, and its performance is compared against the existing SOTA approaches. The results reveal that SimCLF surpasses the performance of its counterparts. Furthermore, SimCLF is applied to a real-world vulnerability dataset, where it has achieved perfect results. Our model is more efficient in few-shot settings, as it achieves better performance than TREX  with only 2,048 binary pairs. In comparison, TREX requires about 89,809 labelled binary pairs. It is hoped that SimCLF will inspire others in the field. To facilitate further research, the code for SimCLF have been released at https://github.com/iamawhalez/fun2vec.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: binary code similarity detection (BCSD) is used to analyze whether two given binary code snippets are similar in semantics.
