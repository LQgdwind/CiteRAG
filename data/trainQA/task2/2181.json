      "content": "Paper Title: Universum GANs: Improving GANs through contradictions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTraining deep learning algorithms under inductive settings is highly data intensive. This severely limits the adoption of these algorithms for domains such as healthcare, autonomous driving, and prognostics and health management, that are challenged in terms of labeled data availability. In such domains, labeling very large quantities of data is either extremely expensive, or entirely prohibitive due to the manual effort required. To alleviate this, researchers have adopted alternative learning paradigms including semi-supervised [ref]20, universum  [ref]9, transductive   learning, etc., to train deep learning models. Such paradigms aim to harness the information available in additional unlabeled data sources. When unlabeled data are not naturally available, synthetic samples are generated using a priori domain information   . A more recent line of work generates additional synthetic data using GANs to boost the discriminator’s performance trained under a semi-supervised learning paradigm. For instance,  adopts a feature matching loss for the generator and utilizes the generated synthetic data with some (additionally) available unlabeled data to improve the discriminator performance through semi-supervised learning.  modifies the GAN game and adopts a complimentary generator which better detects the low-density boundaries of the labeled data distribution. The semi-supervised learning based trained discriminator using these generated data and some additional unlabeled data is shown to provide better accuracies. Here, although the trained discriminator exhibits improved generalization; the generated data does not mimic the training data distribution. A more computationally intensive approach adopts the Triple GAN architecture [ref]16, which includes another classifier player in the two-player GAN formulation. In that setting, the generator and classifier learns the conditional distributions between input and labels, while the discriminator learns to classify fake input-label pairs. Improving upon the notion of having an additional classifier (player),   rather proposes to maintain a two-player game with an auxiliary classifier term added to both discriminator and generator losses. Here the authors target to improve upon conditional wasserstein GAN (W-GAN) games by adding auxiliary multiclass Crammer and Singer hinge losses to both discriminator and generator. Finally,  adopts an alternative learning paradigm through virtual adversarial training (VAT), which smooths the output distribution of the classifier by generating carefully designed adversarial samples while assigning virtual labels to unlabeled data. For all these approaches the major gain comes from an additionally available unlabeled data. In this paper, we consider the scenario where no additional unlabeled samples are available. We demonstrate how our proposed approach leverages only the GAN-generated data to improve generalization while safeguarding against mode collapse compared to Feature Matching FM-GAN , and generating more realistic synthetic data compared to Complimentary-GAN (C-GAN) . Our main idea pivots around training the discriminator under the universum learning setting  . Also evolving the discriminator loss from a universum to semi-supervised setting can yield further gains in discriminator generalization. The main contributions of this paper are, We propose to train the discriminator under universum setting (in Section 3) rather than semi-supervised settings  , and propose a generic universum GAN (U-GAN) game in eq. (11), (12). We provide the theoretical analysis of U-GAN’s consistency and exemplify it for multiclass Hinge loss in (13). Next, we motivate evolving the discriminator loss from universum to semi-supervised setting to propose the new Evolving GAN algorithm in Section 4. The proposed evolving mechanism further improves upon U-GAN’s discriminator generalization. We also derive a unified loss which can evolve the discriminator loss seamlessly from universum to semi-supervised in Section 2.4. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in Section 5. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides preliminaries on the different learning settings and exemplifies C&S hinge loss  under these settings. A unified loss to solve both universum and semi-supervised C&S hinge is also provided. Section 3 introduces the new Universum GAN game, and provides the theoretical analysis on its consistency. Section 4 motivates evolving the learning paradigm of the discriminator loss from universum →→\\rightarrow semi-supervised setting and proposes the new evolving GAN algorithm in Algorithm 1. Section 5 provides the empirical results. Section 6 provides the conclusions.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: of data is either extremely expensive, or entirely prohibitive due to the manual effort required.
