      "content": "Paper Title: IRWE: Inductive Random Walk for Joint Inference of Identity and Position Network Embedding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor various state-of-the-art graph inference techniques, network embedding (a.k.a. graph representation learning) is a commonly used framework. It maps each node of a graph to a low-dimensional vector representation (a.k.a. embedding) with some key properties preserved. The derived representations are further used to support several downstream graph inference tasks (e.g., node classification [ref]1 , node clustering   , and link prediction    ). According to the topology properties to be preserved, existing network embedding techniques can be categorized into the identity and position embedding  . The identity embedding (a.k.a. structural embedding) aims to preserve the structural role that each node plays in graph topology, which is also defined as the node identity. In contrast, the position embedding (a.k.a. proximity-preserving embedding) captures the linkage similarity between nodes (e.g., community structures ), which is also defined as node position or proximity.\nIn Fig.¬†1 (a), each color denotes a unique structural role. For instance, red and yellow may indicate the opinion leader and hole spanner in a social network .\nMoreover, there are two communities denoted by the two dotted circles in Fig.¬†1, where nodes in the same community have dense linkages and thus are more likely to have similar positions. The identity and position embedding should respectively force nodes with similar identities (e.g., {v1,v8}subscriptùë£1subscriptùë£8\\{v_{1},v_{8}\\}) and positions (e.g., {v1,v2,v6}subscriptùë£1subscriptùë£2subscriptùë£6\\{v_{1},v_{2},v_{6}\\}) to have close low-dimensional representations.\nAs a demonstration, we applied struc2vec [ref]14 and node2vec [ref]15 (with embedding dimensionality d=2ùëë2d=2), which are typical identity and position embedding methods, to the example graph in Fig.¬†1 (a) and vislized the derived embeddings.\nNote that two nodes may have the same identity even though they are far away from each other. In contrast, nodes with similar positions must be close to each other with dense linkage and short distances.\nDue to the contradiction, it is challenging to simultaneously capture the two types of properties in a common embedding space. For instance, v1subscriptùë£1v_{1} and v8subscriptùë£8v_{8} with the same identity have close identity embeddings in Fig.¬†1 (b). However, their position embeddings are far away from each other in Fig.¬†1 (c).\nSince the two types of embeddings may be appropriate for different downstream tasks (e.g., structural role classification and community detection), we expect a unified embedding model. Most conventional embedding methods  [ref]15 [ref]14  follow the embedding lookup scheme and can only support the transductive embedding inference. In this scheme, the low-dimensional node representations are model parameters optimized only for the currently observed graph topology. When applying the model to new unseen nodes or graphs, one needs to optimize model parameters from scratch with high complexities. Compared with these transductive methods, some state-of-the-art embedding techniques   can support the advanced inductive inference, which aims to directly generalize the embedding model trained on observed topology to new unseen nodes or graphs without additional optimization. Most existing inductive approaches (e.g., those based on graph neural networks (GNNs) ) rely on the availability of node attributes and derive inductive embeddings via attribute aggregation. However, previous studies 0 1 2 3 have demonstrated some complicated correlations between graph topology and attributes. For instance, attributes may provide (i) complementary characteristics orthogonal to topology for better performance of downstream tasks or (ii) inconsistent noise resulting in unexpected quality degradation. Therefore, it is unclear for most inductive methods that their performance improvement is brought about by the incorporation of attributes or better exploration of topology. When attributes are unavailable, most inductive approaches need additional procedures to extract auxiliary attribute inputs from topology (e.g., one-hot encodings of node degrees). Our experiments demonstrate that some inductive baselines with naive auxiliary attribute extraction strategies may even fail to outperform conventional transductive methods on the inference of identity and position embeddings. Moreover, it is also hard to determine which type of topology properties (i.e., node identities or positions) that some inductive approaches can capture. In this study, we focus on the unsupervised network embedding and explore the possibility of a unified framework for the joint inductive inference of identity and position embeddings. To clearly distinguish between the two types of embeddings, we consider the case where topology is the only available information source. This eliminates the unclear influence from graph attributes due to the complicated correlations between the two sources. Different from most existing inductive approaches relying on the availability of node attributes, we propose an inductive random walk embedding (IRWE) method. It combines multiple attention units with different choices of key, query, and value to handle the random walk (RW) and induced statistics on graph topology. RW is an effective technique to explore topology properties for network embedding. However, most RW-based methods [ref]15 [ref]14 follow the transductive embedding lookup scheme, failing to support the advanced inductive inference. In this study, we demonstrate that anonymous walk (AW) 4, the anonymization of RW, and its induced statistics can be informative features shared by all possible nodes and graphs and thus have the potential to support the inductive inference. Although the identity and position embedding encodes properties contradictory with one another, there remains a relation between node identities and positions that nodes with different identities should have different contributions in forming the local community structures. For the example in Fig.¬†1, v1subscriptùë£1v_{1} and v2subscriptùë£2v_{2} may correspond to an opinion leader and ordinary audience of a social network, where v1subscriptùë£1v_{1} is expected to contribute more in forming community #1 than v2subscriptùë£2v_{2}.\nBy incorporating this relation, IRWE simultaneously derives and jointly optimizes two sets of embeddings w.r.t. node identities and positions. In particular, we demonstrate that some AW statistics can characterize node identities to derive identity embeddings, which can be further used to generate position embeddings.\nIt is also expected that the joint optimization of the two sets of embeddings can improve the quality of one another. Our major contributions are summarized as follows. In contrast to most existing inductive embedding methods relying on the availability of node attributes, we propose an alternative IRWE approach, whose inductiveness is only supported by the RW on graph topology. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore a unified framework for the joint inductive inference of identity and position embeddings using RW, AW, and induced statistics. Experiments on public datasets validate the superiority of IRWE beyond various baselines for the transductive and inductive inference of identity and position embeddings. In the rest of this paper, we review some representative related work in Section¬†II. The problem statements and preliminaries of this study are given in Section¬†III. We further elaborate on the proposed IRWE method in Section¬†IV, including the model architecture as well as the algorithms of optimization and inference. Experiment settings and results are described and analyzed in Section¬†V. Finally, Section¬†VI concludes this paper and indicates some possible future directions.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: representation (a.k.a. embedding) with some key properties preserved.
