      "content": "Paper Title: Hybrid Deep Learning Model using SPCAGAN Augmentation for Insider Threat Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOrganizations are always at high risk from various kinds of cyberattacks. The attacks originated within the organization, referred to as insider attacks, where attackers are in close association with the workplace directly or indirectly and physically or logically are of serious concern. Insider attacks have been on the rise recently, prompting experts to consider them more seriously. According to a survey conducted by Gurucul  in 2020, insider attacks have increased by 67% in the last two years. Lack of real-world data and data imbalance leaves insider threat analysis an understudied research area. Many machine learning methods with cutting-edge performance rely heavily on data augmentation [ref]2 to mitigate data shortage. Common augmentation strategies operate by randomly selecting samples from a space of transformations. However, even if an augmentation strategy improves a dataset in a specific application does not indicate it can be successfully applied to other datasets and applications [ref]3. Unfortunately, due to the curse of dimensionality, such sampling approaches are limited in expressiveness because they cannot scale to complex transformations that depend on numerous parameters. Adversarial examples  can be thought of as a different strategy for data augmentation. By being trained on the challenging input modifications, the resulting models should manage other, apparently simpler, modifications. The benefit of adversarial augmentation is that it replaces sampling with a single, calculated perturbation that provides the maximum loss. The majority of insider detection techniques are anomaly-based, which means they look for unusual activities, including those that have never happened before, since they consider any unusual situation a potential attack. Classification using neural networks is a popular approach used in anomaly detection [ref]5. In contrast to traditional neural networks, a Bayesian Neural Network does not overfit on small datasets . Nowadays, the deep neural networks (DNN) trained with dropout is interpreted as a Bayesian technique. Consequently, Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) have recently gained much attention. In this paper, we combine the potential of Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs)  to perform data augmentation and hybrid model using Bayesian Neural Networks(BNNs) for improved anomaly detection. We propose a modified Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (ACGAN) , referred to as SPCAGAN, to generate high-quality data and to improve the performance of insider threat analysis in end-to-end models. We adopt a linear intrinsic dimension estimation method to study the data distribution in feature space. When properly trained, the GAN generator can efficiently generate perturbations for each instance, thus speeding up adversarial training as a defense. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to use the GAN networks with linear intrinsic dimension estimation methods in insider threat analysis to achieve improved performance. We propose a manifold-learning-based adversarial training approach for insider threat analysis using the generative models. Our goal is two-fold : (i) reduce the adverse effects of the class imbalance by GAN-based data augmentation (ii) build effective anomaly detection models resistant to adversarial attacks. Exhaustive experiments are performed based on a benchmark dataset under various settings to demonstrate the effectiveness of GAN in insider detection in comparison with the existing works. The contributions of the paper are : We developed a linear manifold learning-based regularization for adversarial training that helps in improved insider threat analysis. We propose an anomaly detection model based on probabilistic deep learning. This model shows the feasibility of implementing a hybrid model using Bayesian methods and other deep learning models. We present a systematic evaluation that gives a detailed analysis of how the proposed approach improved the performance in terms of popular measures compared to the existing works on benchmark datasets. Experiments show that our approach can effectively achieve more accurate anomaly detection than state-of-the-art models. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II summarizes the existing insider threat approaches using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods and synthetic data generation methods. Section III presents a technical overview of the proposed approach. Section IV briefs about the data description being used for validation and the algorithms used, followed by an evaluation of the performance of our method in terms of various metrics. Section V concludes the paper and identifies potential future research directions.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Lack of real-world data and data imbalance leaves insider threat analysis an understudied research area.
