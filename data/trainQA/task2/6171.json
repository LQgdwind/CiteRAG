      "content": "Paper Title: A Survey of Safety and Trustworthiness of Large Language Models through the Lens of Verification and Validation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe transformer model [ref]310 has become the standard choice for Language Modelling tasks, but it has also found widespread integration in text-to-image tasks. We present a chronological overview of the advancements in text-to-image research.\nDALL-E  is a representative approach that leverages Transformers for a text-to-image generation. The methodology involves training a dVAE [ref]265 and subsequently training a 12B decoder-only sparse transformer supervised by image tokens from the pre-trained dVAE. The transformer generates image tokens solely based on text tokens during inference. The resulting image candidates are evaluated by a pretrained CLIP model  to produce the final generated image.\nStableFusion  differs from DALL-E  by using a diffusion model instead of a Transformer to generate latent image tokens. To incorporate text input, StableFusion  first encodes the text using a transformer then conditions the diffusion model on the resulting text tokens.\nGLIDE [ref]238 employs a transformer model [ref]310 to encode the text input and then trains a diffusion model to generate images that are conditioned on the text tokens directly.\nDALL-E2  effectively leverages LLMs by following a three-step process. First, a CLIP model is trained using text-image pairs. Next, using text tokens as input, an autoregressive or diffusion model generates image tokens. Finally, based on these image tokens, a diffusion model is trained to produce the final image.\nImagen  employs a pre-trained text encoder, such as BERT  or CLIP , to encode text. It then uses multiple diffusion models to train a process that generates images that start from low-resolution and gradually progress to high-resolution.\nParti  demonstrates that a VQGAN  and Transformer architecture can achieve superior image synthesis outcomes compared to previous approaches, even without utilising a diffusion model.\nThe eDiff-I model  has recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on the MS-COCO dataset  by leveraging a combination of CLIP and diffusion models. In summary, text-to-image research commonly utilises transformer models [ref]310 for encoding text input and either the diffusion model or the decoder of an autoencoder for generating images from latent text or image tokens.\n\nReference markers found: [310]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]310: The transformer model [ref]310 has become the standard choice for Language Modelling tasks, but it has also found widespread integration in text-to-image tasks.
