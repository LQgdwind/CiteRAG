In this thesis, we focus on mining digital traces with the aim to understand the underlying behavior that gives rise to the traces.\nWe address an email prediction task in Chapter 6\nand aim to gain insights into usage patterns with the reminder service of an intelligent personal assistant in Chapter 7. Email has a rich history as an object of study in computer science, once more spurred by the availability of data, specifically, the acquisition and subsequent release of the “Enron corpus,” by computer scientist Andrew McCallumn  for a reported sum of $10,000 . Research initially focused on information extraction tasks such as\nrecognizing speech acts 4 ,\npeople-related tasks, such as\nname recognition and entity resolution [ref]66   ,\ncontact information extraction  9,\nidentity modeling and resolution ,\ndiscovery of peoples’ roles ,\nand finally email-related tasks, such as\nautomated classification of emails into folders ,\ne.g., by leveraging the social network features of the email network .\nThe Enron email collection was also used very directly in an E-Discovery task in the TREC Legal  6 tracks, which revolved around finding responsive documents for a given production request (in litigation). Studying email collections as communication graphs (or social networks) has yielded insights into\nhow communication patterns change and relate to real-world events (e.g., how interpersonal communication intensified during Enron’s crisis period ),\nhow important nodes (= email addresses) or influential members of the network can be discovered by looking at network properties ,\nand how one can discover shared interests among members of an email network 8. More recently, research interest in email has been rekindled.\nSpurred by publications from industry, where access to huge amounts of real email data and traffic has resulted in work on\nautomated classification of email into folders 6,\npredicting recipients’ follow-up actions for emails  ,\nor predicting an email’s (personalized) “importance” , and\ninferring the activities that govern email communication 10. Finally, work on recipient prediction (the task we address in Chapter 6) generally included the additional constraint that one or more seed recipient is given, a task also known as CC-prediction 02 .\nPrevious attempts at the type of recipient prediction we address leverages either\nthe communication network, constructed from previously sent emails 5,\nor the content of the current email .\nFinally, motivated by privacy concerns previous work typically addresses recipient prediction by restricting to a sender’s ego network for prediction (i.e., only considering the local network of the sender, as opposed to the global communication network).\nIn Chapter 6 we ignore these constraints, motivated by our offline, batch, discovery scenario, and rather attempt to gain insights into enterprise-wide communication patterns, and in particular the importance of communication graph properties and email content features. As mentioned in Chapter 1, interaction logs with personal intelligent assistants may provide rich digital traces for inferring people’s real life activities.\nIn the case of intelligent assistants, analyzing user logs may support inferring the users’ intents  or current activities 04.\nWhere previous work addressed modeling long-term goals , the Cortana reminder logs we study in Chapter 7 may help us in understanding short term goals.\nTo study the relation between a user’s reminders and real life activities and tasks, several areas of research are relevant.\nWe focus largely on research on memory and (completing planned) tasks, and\nreview research in the following areas:\n(i) reminders,\n(ii) memory aids, and\n(iii) prospective memory. A number of systems have been developed to help remind people of future actions     , many of which leverage contextual signals for more accurate reminding. These systems can help generate reminders associated with a range of future actions, including location, events, activities, people, and time. Two of the most commonly supported types of reminders are location- and time-based (and combinations thereof  ). Location-based reminders fire when people are at or near locations of interest  45. Time-based reminders are set and triggered based on time  ], including those based on elapsed time-on-task 3. While time-based reminders can provide value to many users, particular groups may especially benefit from time-based reminders. These include the elderly , those with memory impairments , and people seeking to comply with prescribed medications . In Chapter 7 we study time-based reminders in the Cortana reminder service, and omit location and person-based reminders, which are less common in our data, and more challenging to study across users as they rely heavily on personal context and relationships between the user and the locations and persons that trigger the reminders. Memory aids help people to remember past events and information. Studies have shown that people leverage both their own memories via recall strategies and the use of external memory aids to increase the likelihood of recall . Aids can assume different forms, including paper  to electronic alternatives   19. One example of a computer-based memory aid is the Remembrance Agent 19, which uses words typed into the text processor to retrieve similar documents. People also leverage standard computer facilities to support future reminding (e.g., positioning documents in noticeable places on the computer desktop) , which is inadequate for a number of reasons, including that the reminder is not pushed to the user . Other work has focused on the use of machine learning to predict forgetting, and the need for reminding about events . Cortana is an example of an interactive and intelligent external memory aid. Studying usage patterns and user behavior lets us better understand users’ needs, developing improved methods for system-user interaction and collaboration, and more generally, enhance our understanding of the types of tasks where memory aids are necessary. Prospective memory (PM) refers to the ability to remember actions to be performed at a future time  2. Beyond simply remembering, successful prospective memory requires recall at the appropriate moment. PM failures have been an area of study 4 9. Studies have shown that failures can be linked to external factors such as interruptions  . Prospective tasks are usually divided into time-based tasks and event-based tasks 2. Time-based tasks are tasks targeted for execution at a specific future time, while event-based tasks are performed when a particular situation or event occurs, triggered by external cues, e.g., a person or a location . Laboratory studies of PM have largely focused on retention and retrieval performance of event-based PM, as this is straightforward to operationalize in an experimental setting. Time-based PM is a largely overlooked type in PM studies , as this type of “self-generated” PM is difficult to model in a lab setting. The Cortana reminder logs we study in Chapter 7 represent a real-life collection of time-based PM instances. They provide insights in the type and nature of tasks users are likely to forget to execute.\n\nReference markers found: [66]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]66: for a reported sum of $10,000 .
