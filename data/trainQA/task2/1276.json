      "content": "Paper Title: Impact of Weather Factors on Migration Intention using Machine Learning Algorithms\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nClimate is changing, and its implication for human mobility is at the core of the scientific and political agenda. The profound relationship between migration and the environment is not an unknown phenomenon, but the emergence and acceleration of climate change introduce more complexity to this relationship. The literature bringing together migration and climate change has significantly increased in the past ten years (Millock , Berlemann and Steinhardt , Beine and Jeusette , Cattaneo et al. [ref]13). This literature benefited primarily from greater availability and quality of climate and mobility indicators. Their main goal is to study the extent to which climate events initiated or even forced individuals to move. Even though the research goal seems straightforward, the findings do not reach a consensus. The heterogeneity of results is because of the use of different measurements, methodological approaches, and different contexts (Beine and Jeusette ). First, findings differ in terms of the (i) direction of the impact whether climate acts as a pull or a push factor for migration111Black et al.  distinguish migration, displacement, and immobility and Beine and Jeusette  refer to ‘trapped population’., (ii) the strength of the relationship, and (iii) that this relationship is conditional on other features. Second, the different methodological approaches and ways of measuring climate shocks and migration could explain such divergence of existent evidence. Third, the findings are context specific. For example, existing evidence shows that the climate-migration nexus is common in developing societies with the rain-fed agricultural sector that occupies a vital place in the overall economy. The primary goal of this article is to bring new insights to this literature by adopting Machine Learning (ML) techniques and a multitude of climate and mobility measurements. Following Bertoli et al. , we focus on the West African region, namely, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal. We build upon the data from the Gallup World Poll (GWP) surveys  and the high-resolution gridded dataset by the Climatic Research Unit of the University of East Anglia  for constructing the climate indicators. Unlike traditional methods used by social scientists that specify the relationships between variables, machine learning algorithms are emerging technologies that can learn data without the explicit specification of relationships.\nThus, one benefit is the lesser manual function operations compared to the methods used in econometric studies, reducing the possible bias introduced by the expertise of the modeler. Instead, ML models base on the dataset and can discover more complex relationships or patterns between more variables during the learning phase.\nTherefore, ML models are considered more as a “black box” approach.\nThis higher capacity comes with two major drawbacks.\nThe first one is the risk of overfitting the model to the data.\nTherefore, ML methodology generally splits the dataset of observations into the so-called training set and test set. The first one is used to fit the model, and the second one to evaluate the performances of the learned models.\nThe second drawback of ML approaches is the less interpretable models that they generate. While a linear model can be easily interpreted by looking at the weights of the coefficients of each covariate, some machine learning models can involve thousands or even millions of parameters combined with a complex mathematical or logical formula to take each decision. Some methods have been imagined helping the user interpret ML models, but in general, the behavior of ML models remains arguably less interpretable than linear methods. Among the large variety of machine learning approaches, we have chosen in this work to use (ensemble) tree-based classifiers – decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) – for the following reasons.\nThe reproducibility of our result/approach is important and these methods are available today in most of the off-the-shelf data-science tools or library.\nThe methods existed for nearly two decades and have obtained excellent performances on many machine learning problems. They are still considered as the method to try first in machine learning competitions.\nThese methods do not require too large datasets to get good results, and the training cost is quite low. Our contributions are as follows. We approach the migration-climate nexus using tree-based methods and demonstrate through this paper the interest to use ML. We provide evidence on how climate influences migration intentions. We propose an ML workflow to the community of social sciences on how to use machine learning techniques. Section 2 introduces the problem and lists our questions based on our motivation for using machine learning methods to predict migration intentions. Next, Section 3 (and Appendix A.1) describes our methodology and provides an overview of the machine learning (ML) approaches (e.g., decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)) we used in this paper. In addition, Section 4 describes the dataset with details. Then, Section 5 describes our experiments and answers to the research questions followed by Section 6 which elaborates on our findings and discussions. We finish our paper in Section 7.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: The literature bringing together migration and climate change has significantly increased in the past ten years (Millock , Berlemann and Steinhardt , Beine and Jeusette , Cattaneo et al.
