      "content": "Paper Title: Transaction Capacity, Security and Latency in Blockchains\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBlockchains allow users to maintain a distributed ledger of accounts. Nakamoto‚Äôs white paper  described a mining procedure of nonces (proof of work, PoW) and a longest chain protocol that enables the users to converge to a single version of the ledger. The protocol requires the users to mine a new block at the tip of their longest chain of blocks which contains a nonce proving the validity of the block and enabling the miner of the block to get a reward for its troubles. Some blocks are mined on the same height in the chain due to network delays and create forks that divide the network into two different versions of the ledger. Adversarial activities can create deliberate forks as well that undermine the security of the chain and result in larger latency until a block can be confirmed together with its transactions. The more one waits to confirm a block, the safer the content of the block will be, i.e., it is less likely that another block at the same height (another version of the ledger) is confirmed after the block is confirmed. This is referred to as the security-latency problem. The security-latency problem has been extensively analyzed by various different models and protocols  [ref]3  [ref]5    . Under bounded network delay ŒîŒî\\Delta, [ref]5 analyzes how secure a block is after waiting tùë°t time units whereas   answer the same security question using block generations as time units. As transactions arrive to the blockchain system, they are included in the next blocks that are to be mined based on the fee they offer to the miner. The miner of a block can only include up to a certain number of transactions or the block can have up to a certain size of storage units (bytes). In this sense, the blockchain systems can be modeled as a priority-queue, where transactions enter a queue and compete to be included in the next block. Different batch service queues have been modeled for blockchain analysis 0 1 2 3. 0 has given an insightful batch service queue model and has evaluated the average service time and correctly interpreted that the micro-payments are not sustainable for the Bitcoin system. 1 models a batch service queue for Bitcoin that gives an estimate service time of a transaction given the fee and current state of the mempool. Since each mined block experiences a network delay until the other miners can observe it, which decreases the rate of service of transactions, 4 re-models the batch service queue system that accounts for the network delay and gives the stability condition for the queue system as well as a numerical method to find the steady state of the system. In this paper, we first give bounds on the security-latency question, i.e., how secure a block is after a certain number of blocks are published, where we re-model the delay with exponential distribution and consider a rigged model first introduced in . This analysis in turn is interpreted as how fast blocks can be mined given honest proportion of nodes Œ±ùõº\\alpha, a confirmation rule and a security threshold. Then, we show that the security level can be parameterized in terms of the proportion of mining rate to the network delay which we call Œ∫ùúÖ\\kappa. Next, the security-latency analysis is connected to the queue model via the stability condition of the batch service queue system which enables us to reinterpret the number of transactions a blockchain system can sustain as a function of the block size, network conditions and Œ∫ùúÖ\\kappa. We also consider several queue service attacks and their effect on sustainable transaction rate. Although we consider a first-come, first-served queue model, this model could be interpreted as a queue system, where we only consider transactions in the service that have a high priority, i.e., it is a first-come, first-served queue model for transactions that pay a sufficient fee. Otherwise, it does not make sense to consider the stability condition as the low-fee transactions are too many to have a stable system. This priority model is inspired by the two-class queue model of 0 and can also be interpreted as that of 1, where the transactions in the queue are considered as pending only when they pay more fee than the fee a user is willing to pay. Our findings imply that for given network conditions, a block size bùëèb, honest proportion Œ±ùõº\\alpha, security violation probability threshold p¬Ø¬Øùëù\\overline{p}, increasing kùëòk-block confirmation rule allows the mining rate to increase which in turn increases the sustainable transaction rate. This adjustment of confirmation rule and mining rate first drops the expected transaction confirmation time until a point where a minimum is achieved and further increasing kùëòk-block confirmation rule starts to increase the expected transaction confirmation time, i.e., a trade-off emerges. For Bitcoin parameters, using our model, current transaction safety violation probability threshold is found to be 0.001180.001180.00118 and ‚âà7absent7\\approx 7 transactions per second is shown to be sustainable. Using the same block size bùëèb and network conditions for Bitcoin, by increasing the mining rate so that a block is mined every ‚âà90absent90\\approx 90 seconds, sustainable transaction rate increases to ‚âà50absent50\\approx 50, safety violation probability threshold increases to 0.0020.0020.002 and a transaction is confirmed after ‚âà9absent9\\approx 9 minutes. By keeping 0.001180.001180.00118 as safety violation probability threshold and switching 6-block confirmation rule to 101010-block confirmation rule, a block can be mined every ‚âà17absent17\\approx 17 seconds, which increases sustainable transaction rate up to ‚âà235absent235\\approx 235 and a transaction is confirmed after ‚âà3absent3\\approx 3 minutes. Concurrent with our work, we became aware of 5, which established a new model to analyze the security-latency trade-off for bounded delay model that works for safety parameters up to ultimate fault tolerance and replaces previously established rigged model of   with a partial Markov chain that counts the number of successful balanced attacks by the adversary. The results are connected to throughput by simply multiplying the block size with the rate of growth under ŒîŒî\\Delta-delay strategy explained in . An optimization problem is formulated for the throughput and security-latency and a trade-off is established between latency and throughput for a given security level. Different from 5, we independently used an exponential delay model which is then connected to the throughput via a batch-service queue system and its stability condition. As the stability condition for exponential delay model, first established in 4, ends up with the same form as the product of the block size with the rate of growth under ŒîŒî\\Delta-delay strategy for bounded delay model, optimistic results for the throughput in both methods agree with each other. In addition to optimistic throughput analysis, here, we consider two different queue-attack strategies, a mild one and a pessimistic one in order to reflect the change in throughput under different situations. Although an analogous throughput-latency result can be established with an optimization problem via our analysis, since we argue against an optimization problem that treats block size independent from security level, our interpretation of the trade-off differs from 5, where we pick a security level and a block size then compare different kùëòk-confirmation rules and mining rates.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: is confirmed after the block is confirmed.
