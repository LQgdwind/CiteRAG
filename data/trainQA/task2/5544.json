      "content": "Paper Title: Robot path planning using deep reinforcement learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNavigation competence is essential for mobile robots. To navigate autonomously, a robot must use its sensors’ data to identify an optimal or suboptimal path to a target point while avoiding collisions. Generally, a map of the environment is constructed, and then a path planner algorithm is used to find a clear path. However, the task becomes daunting when dealing with sensor noise, tracking errors, and unpredictable surroundings. It also becomes challenging and time-consuming to update the obstacle map accurately, replan the navigation path and predict all possible situations the robot may encounter. Alternatively, new methods that do not require maps to navigate have been proposed, such as the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), introduced by Mnih et al. in 2013 , which has shown the ability to solve complex tasks that require a lot of data processing by combining the reinforcement learning (RL) framework with the artificial neural networks from deep learning (DL). These methods have the advantages of being mapless, having a strong learning ability, lower sensor accuracy dependence, and requiring less human supervision and environment-dependent engineering.\nContrary to other mapless navigation approaches, which require explicit programming of the robot’s behaviour, DRL methods allow the robot to learn the optimal actions to take at each time step by associating them with observations of the environment and a reward signal. Furthermore, unlike pure deep learning methods, they do not require a dataset of labelled samples, which is severely lacking in robotics. Instead, the robot is trained by directly interacting with its environment in a trial-and-error manner. Even when training in the real world proves costly, DRL allows a robot to learn in a simulated environment safely and then transfer the knowledge to a real robot, which is possible because of the generalisation ability of DL models. DRL robotic applications often treat sensor data as a representation of the environment’s state, the most commonly used being ranging data, monocular camera images, and depth camera data. Among the sensors used to collect the data, RGB-D cameras are one of the most cost-efficient, lightweight, and information-rich, which allows them to be used for a wide range of applications. As a state representation, RGB images are sensitive to lighting and colour changes, which may be irrelevant to the navigation task. Still, depth images provide geometrical information about the surroundings and are represented as grayscale images, which have been proven to achieve good results in DRL methods applied to different domains. The introduction of deep reinforcement Learning in 2013 by DeepMind  demonstrated its potential by training agents that achieved better performance than human experts on Atari games. Since then, notable achievements of DRL methods have been primarily on gaming applications, such as AlphaGo  winning against the Go champion, AlphaZero 0 beating the champion chess program, and OpenAI Five  defeating professional teams in the online game DOTA 2. However, RL approaches to solve real-world problems have been proposed in several domains, including healthcare , analytics [ref]6, language processing 3, networking , finances 1 and robotics . Deep reinforcement learning approaches in navigation aim to benefit from learnt skills to solve conventional navigation problems, such as lack of generalisation, the need for fine-tuning or the inability to react in real-time, for applications where mobile robots operate in complex environments. Some of these scenarios include outdoor environments with uneven terrain and noisier sensor readings, dynamic environments where fast reaction times are required, and human environments where collaboration and safety measures are necessary. Deep reinforcement-based applications for navigation have been developed for social robotics, service robotics, unmanned ground vehicles and self-driving cars, among others. For the autonomous navigation problem, DRL applications are focused on four scenarios, as studied by Zhu et al. in [ref]52, which include local obstacle avoidance, indoor navigation, multi-robot navigation and social navigation. The applications are usually limited to one of those specific capabilities and are developed by conducting specialised research and adding expert knowledge to favour the convergence of the DRL methods. For that reason, little research has been done on moving from a simpler to a more complicated task. Moreover, few studies analyse the impact of the reward function on the agent’s behaviour, as its design is tailored to solve the specific task, and no further comparison is made. Furthermore, the review of Zhu et al. [ref]52, the survey of DRL algorithms for autonomous vehicles of Ye et al. 9, as well as the related works reviewed, indicate that among the most commonly used DRL algorithms are the Deep Q Networks (DQN) , Double DQN (DDQN) 4, Dueling DDQN (D3QN), Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic , Proximal Policy Optimization  and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients . However, since their introduction, improvements have been proposed in each algorithm’s family of RL methods that lead to new state-of-the-art performances in their benchmark domain, such as continuous control or Atari Games. This means that more modern DRL methods could also improve the results in autonomous navigation-related tasks. In the present research, those problems are studied by training and evaluating different DRL agents in obstacle avoidance and goal-oriented navigation tasks, which were designed considering the challenges presented in the previous reviews. As mentioned by Zhu et al. in [ref]52, the term m​a​p​l​e​s​s𝑚𝑎𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑠mapless used to describe DRL-based navigation systems in this work refers to the use of lightweight localisation solutions, such as GPS and WiFi, to obtain the relative position of the goal point without a global map. Although the training environments were designed based on the conditions of an indoor navigation scenario, the goal-oriented navigation task is referred to as such due to its focus on reaching a goal rather than the complexity of the environment. This article introduces a mapless deep reinforcement learning approach to solve the autonomous navigation problem in indoor and static simulated environments using depth images. It focuses on analysing the different data required to train agents for obstacle avoidance and goal-oriented navigation tasks, studying the effect on their behaviour and performance by modifying the reward signal and changing the algorithm used. The proposed approach is implemented in the open-source mobile robot Turtlebot2 111https://www.turtlebot.com/turtlebot2/, by using the Robotic Operating System (ROS) 222http://wiki.ros.org/ as the robotics framework and Gazebo 333https://gazebosim.org/home as the robotics and physics simulator. However, the DRL framework can be applied to different mobile robots and using other robotic simulators as long as it is possible for the robot to perform the designated actions and the necessary sensory data is available. An initial idea about how a robot follows an RL approach in a navigation task is shown in Fig. 1.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: and OpenAI Five  defeating professional teams in the online game DOTA 2.
