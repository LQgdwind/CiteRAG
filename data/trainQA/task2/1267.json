      "content": "Paper Title: Comparison Graphs: a Unified Method for Uniformity Testing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur main result is a method that produces well-performing uniformity testers in various models. In this paper we show a list of uniformity testers in different models, specified below. We also show limitations of our method for most of these models, which point towards a conclusion that no better comparison graphs could have been chosen (up to constant factors in the sample complexity of the induced tester). These limitation rely on a conjecture that in some sense no matter the shape of the comparison graph, enough comparisons always must be made. We emphasize that for any model in which a lower bound is known (for any method, not necessarily collision-based testing), the testers produced by our method are optimal, up to poly‚Å°(1/œµ)poly1italic-œµ\\operatorname{poly}(1/\\epsilon) factors. As far as we know, no testers in the literature are tight with the current lower bounds for these specific cases. Thus, it could be the case that collision-based testing achieves optimal results (even in terms of œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon) for all the models we consider. A more thorough discussion is given in Section¬†5.3. Equipped with a structural theorem, proven in Section¬†4.1, we consider various models and devise a uniformity tester in each one. The key idea here is to translate the constraints of each model into the comparisons we are able to perform, or differently put: a structural limitation on the comparison graph.\nDoing so will guide us how to choose a ‚Äúgood‚Äù comparison graph for this specific model.\nHaving a structure in mind, two formalities are left: (i) Prove that calculation of Z,TùëçùëáZ,T (the number of collisions, and the threshold value) can be done in the model; (ii) Calculate our desired complexity measure (which changes from model to model), and optimize the parameters of the chosen graph (e.g., if the graph is a clique, determine the size of the clique). In Section¬†3.1, we deal with the classic and the simultaneous model.\nFirst we use the classic model as a warm-up. Since this is done in ¬†, we add to the mix a small insight: our framework (which allows the tester to choose threshold values other than œÑ=1/2ùúè12\\tau=1/2) actually provides slightly better constants when placing the threshold much lower (at roughly œÑ=1/9ùúè19\\tau=1/9). For this model, it was shown by¬†[ref]14 that testing with high precision can be done faster than it would have using standard amplification. However, they use estimation of the empirical distance from uniform over the sample set. It is unclear whether collision-based testing is fit for this task. We do not pursue this direction here.444One reason is that our work focuses on the regime that uses new and different comparison graphs, other than the clique graph. This direction would probably involve analysis that is specific for the clique graph, where all samples can be compared with one another. We then move to the simultaneous case where multiple players each send a short message to the referee, based on their own samples. The referee then needs to output a decision about the underlying distribution. In this model we want to find a good exchange for the number of players, the number of samples each player gets, and the length of the messages. For example, if the messages can be arbitrarily long, each player can send her entire sample set and the problem becomes trivial.\nFor this reason, the two papers to first consider (independently) testing in this model, had a very different focus. In a preliminary version of¬† , only the case of a single sample per player was considered, and their algorithms indeed rely on different and interesting strategies, but not collision counting ‚Äì as this strategy is irrelevant for this regime.\nIn¬†[ref]17 a different approach was taken, where all messages were fixed to a single bit, but each player gets multiple samples (and in fact, their algorithm does rely on collisions in some sense, but it does not count them accurately, and does not fall under the umbrella of our definition for collision-based testers). For our use, as oppose to both these view, we allow both parameters to be larger. We allow multiple samples per player, and show that using a short message (not a single bit, but not much longer), one can devise an efficient tester. We also consider the asymmetric cost variant of this model, which naturally arise when reducing to it from the LOCAL model, a standard model in the field of distributed computing. To motivate this variant, we think of the sampling process as a bottleneck, but now each player has her own sampling rate (some players might draw samples much faster than others).\nIf before we tried to minimize the amount of samples per player, now we wish to minimize the overall sampling time instead, and still sample enough data to successfully test for uniformity. More about the model and the reduction from the LOCAL model can be found in¬†[ref]17. We remark that many works in the simultaneous model consider communication trade-offs, when assigning only a single sample for each party. Our method does not currently extend to this framework, although one might consider integrating it with other methods. For example, one method (e.g., in¬†) uses random hash to a smaller domain. One might consider collisions on this domain instead of the original one. these meta-collisions can be counted within the communication constraints. Some works in this regime (single sample) focus on privacy aspects of testing (e.g.,¬†[ref]2 ). This line of research should be irrelevant for our method (and even the extension mentioned above), as any detection of a collision (even on a smaller domain) would immediately give away non-trivial information about the sample. In Section¬†3.2, we deal with a different type of processors: memory-constrained processors. When observing a single processor of this type, we end up with the streaming model (as described in¬†).\nAt least one scenario which motivates the simultaneous model is seemingly very coherent with such constrained processors. Thinking of a network of sensors, or remote devices, gathering samples ‚Äì it is quite comprehensible that these processors are not only limited by their ability to communicate with the data center, but also by their ability to store the entire data observed between consecutive reports (in this scenario, the data center is the referee performing the test periodically to detect anomalies).\nFor this reason, we also consider the case of a simultaneous model, where each processor has a small memory budget. In this new model, we easily devise again an efficient uniformity tester. Lastly, in Section¬†3.3, we use the structural theorem to show how on certain graphs one can solve uniformity in the CONGEST model faster than what was previously known to be possible.\nSpecifically, if the communication network has kùëòk players and diameter Dùê∑D, and each players start with one sample, the best known algorithm runs in O‚Äã(D+n/(k‚Äãœµ4))ùëÇùê∑ùëõùëòsuperscriptitalic-œµ4O(D+n/(k\\epsilon^{4})) rounds¬†[ref]17.\nThe improvement we suggest is an algorithm that takes O‚Äã(D)ùëÇùê∑O(D) rounds, and works in specific networks that have a certain topological characteristics.\nMoreover, we show a simple detection procedure of O‚Äã(D)ùëÇùê∑O(D) rounds, that can be used to recognize such a good topology. This means that any network can use the detection procedure first, and then either proceed as in¬†[ref]17, or switch to the faster (O‚Äã(D)ùëÇùê∑O(D)) algorithm whenever it is guaranteed to perform well.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: choose threshold values other than œÑ=1/2ùúè12\\tau=1/2) actually provides slightly better constants when placing the threshold much lower (at roughly œÑ=1/9ùúè19\\tau=1/9). For this model, it was shown by¬†[ref]14 that testing with high precision can be done faster than it would have using standard amplification. However, they use estimation of the empirical distance from uniform over the sample set.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
