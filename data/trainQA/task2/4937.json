      "content": "Paper Title: Contrastive Representation Learning for Gaze Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGaze represents the focus of human attention and serves as an essential cue for non-verbal communication. While specialized gaze trackers can accurately measure a user’s gaze direction, there is substantial interest in gaze estimation using regular cameras. Although, learning gaze estimation models from images is challenging and needs to transcend multiple “nuisance” characteristics such as facial features or head orientation to estimate gaze accurately. In recent years, deep learning [ref]1 [ref]2  has shown promising results for gaze estimation.\nIn part, this success stems from the availability of large-scale annotated datasets. As a result, valuable datasets must contain a wide range of gaze directions, appearances, and head poses, which is a laborious and time-consuming procedure.\nAlso, gaze annotations are difficult to obtain, which makes the creation of large, representative datasets challenging [ref]4. Therefore, methods that facilitate training with limited gaze annotations are highly desirable. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has gained tremendous success over the past few years and emerged as a powerful tool for reducing over-reliance on human annotations   . Following a generally accepted paradigm, we consider a pre-training stage that requires no labels, followed by a fine-tuning stage using a relatively small number of labeled samples.\nSSL is an effective approach for pre-training, where semantically meaningful representations are learned that can be seamlessly adapted during\nfine-tuning stage   .\nSpecifically, a good pre-training would ensure that the embeddings for images associated with the same gaze direction are neighbors in the feature space, regardless of other non-relevant factors such as appearance. Arguably, this could accelerate the job of fine-tuning, possibly reducing the number of required labeled samples. In this work, for SSL pre-training, we focus on contrastive representation learning (CRL), which aims to map “positive\" pair samples to embeddings that are close to each other, while mapping “negative\" pairs apart from each other .\nA popular approach is to generate pairs by applying two different transformations (or augmentations) to an input image\nforming a positive pair, and different images forming negative pairs. This method encourages invariance in representations w.r.t. similar types of transformations, where these transformations are assumed to model “nuisance\" effects.\n However, obtaining the necessary and sufficient set of “positive\" and “negative\" pairs remains a non-trivial and unanswered challenge for a given task. This work attempts to answer this question for gaze estimation. Recent CRL-based methods encourages the representations to be invariant to any image transformation, many of which are not suitable for gaze estimation. For example, geometry-based image transformations (such as rotation) will change the gaze direction. In contrast, it is beneficial to have invariance to appearance, e.g., a person’s identity, background, etc. In this paper, we propose Gaze Contrastive Learning (or GazeCLR) framework – a simple CRL-based unsupervised pre-training approach for gaze estimation, i.e., a pre-training\nmethod requiring no gaze label data.\nIn detail, our approach relies on invariance to image transforms (e.g., color jitter) that do not alter gaze direction, and equivariance to camera viewpoint, which requires additional information of multi-view geometry, i.e., images of the same person should be obtained at the same time by two or more cameras from different locations. For learning equivariance, we leverage the fact that in a common reference system, two or more synchronous images of the same person from different camera viewpoints are associated with the same gaze direction. The knowledge of the relative pose of each camera to the common reference system provides the relation of gaze directions defined in the respective camera space.\nIn other words, gaze direction has an equivariant relationship to camera viewpoints. We claim that the requirement of using multiple cameras may be less onerous than obtaining gaze annotations for each image.\n We use an existing multi-view gaze dataset (EVE ) which provides video sequences captured from four calibrated and synchronized cameras and contains gaze annotations, which are obtained using a gaze tracking device .\nWe neglect labels during pre-training and use them only for fine-tuning and evaluation. Observe that, the relative camera pose information available with the EVE dataset is used only during pre-training stage. Figure 1 presents an overview of the proposed idea. To evaluate the GazeCLR, we perform self-supervised pre-training using the EVE dataset and transfer the learned representations for the gaze estimation task in various evaluation settings. We demonstrate the effectiveness of representations by showing that the proposed method achieves superior performance on both within-dataset and cross-dataset (MPIIGaze [ref]2 and Columbia ) evaluations, by using only a small number of labeled samples for fine-tuning.\nOur major contributions are summarized as follows: We propose a simple contrastive learning method for gaze estimation that relies on the observation that gaze direction is invariant under selected appearance transformations and equivariant to any two camera viewpoints. We also argue to learn equivariant representations by taking advantage of the multi-view data that can be seamlessly collected using multiple cameras.  Our empirical evaluations show that GazeCLR yields improvements for various settings of gaze estimation and is competitive with existing supervised  and unsupervised state-of-the-art gaze representation learning methods  .\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: models from images is challenging and needs to transcend multiple “nuisance” characteristics such as facial features or head orientation to estimate gaze accurately.
