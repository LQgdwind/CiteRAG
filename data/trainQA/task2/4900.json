The FlexMatch  is the most recent state-of-the-art method that was proposed to overcome the fixed-threshold drawback of FixMatch by proposing curriculum pseudo labeling to dynamically adjust the threshold. For a fair comparison, all the methods use the same backbone, data augmentation, and hyper-parameters. To extensively compare with the state-of-the-art methods, we apply our method in FixMatch and Pseudo-labeling and report the results for all the methods under different percentages of labeled data. Two evaluation metrics are used to indicate the performance, including overall accuracy and class mean accuracy, which is the average of the accuracy of all the classes. The Table 1 and Table 2 indicate that in the 3D SSL clasification task, the current state-of-the-art work FlexMatch only has limited improvement or even decreases the performance when applied in FixMatch and Pseudo-Labeling with limited labeled data. This is because FlexMatch is only designed for class balanced dataset but 3D datasets are all inherently data-imbalanced. As shown in Table 1, our model outperforms all the state-of-the-art methods with two evaluation metrics on the ModelNet40 dataset. As shown in Table 2, on more realistic and challenging dataset ScanObjectNN , our model also significantly outperforms all the other methods by a large margin. For both ModelNet40 [ref]35 and ScanObjectNN  dataset, the improvement of our model on the mean class accuracy is more significant, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our model on balancing the learning status of each class.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: To demonstrate the capability and potential of our proposed method, we compare the performance of our method with other semi-supervised learning methods including Pseudo-Labeling (PL) [ref]12, FixMatch , Dash [ref]38, and FlexMatch ) under the same setting in ModelNet40 [ref]35 and ScanObjectNN .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
