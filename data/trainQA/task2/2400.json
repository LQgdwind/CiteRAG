      "content": "Paper Title: Graph Representation Learning for Road Type Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years deep learning techniques have been used for procedural and data driven content generation. Among them is the method, which learns a low-dimensional generative model from a high-dimensional procedural model by using shape features . To circumvent the large number of parameters involved in the rule sets and also their non-linear relationship to the resulting content, a sketch-based approach to procedural modeling trains a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to map sketches into the procedural model parameters . An urban procedural model  also trains CNNs to recognize the procedural rule intended by a sketch and estimating its parameters. They use simple procedural grammars to turn sketches into realistic 3D models. A neurally-guided architecture  augments procedural models with deep neural networks to control the random selections of different models based on the output. Using generative models based on deep neural networks have also been extensively studied for graph generations. One example is the method that applies deep learning to generate an initial segmentation of aerial images and feed them to an algorithm, which reasons about missing connections in the extracted road topology . To automatically construct accurate road network maps from aerial images RoadTracker  uses an iterative search process guided by a CNN-based decision function to derive road network graph directly from the output of CNN. Graph neural networks is used to express probabilistic dependencies of a graph nodes and edges in order to learn the distributions over any arbitrary graph [ref]15. The GraphRNN [ref]16 learns to generate graphs by training on a representative set of graphs and decomposes the graph generation process into a sequence of node and edge formations, conditioned on the graph structure generated so far. The Neural Turtle Graphics (NTG) [ref]17 represents the road layout using a graph where nodes of the graph represent control points and edges of the graph represents road segments. NTG is a sequential generative model parameterized by a neural network, which iteratively generates a new node and an edge connecting to an existing node conditioned on the current graph. There are a number of approaches for graph generation based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Among them is StreetGAN , in which a preprocessing layer is applied to convert a given representation of a road network into a binary image using pixel intensities to encode the presence or absence of streets. The model next trains a GAN to synthesize a multitude of arbitrary sized street networks. Finally the post-processing layer extracts a graph-based representation of the generated images. The NetGAN  generates graphs from random walks and the model is trained using Wasserstein GAN objective function. Using GANs, GraphGAN  is proposed as a graph representation learning framework, which applies a new graph softmax to satisfy the properties of normalization, graph structure awareness, and computational efficiency.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: graph directly from the output of CNN.
