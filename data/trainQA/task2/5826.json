      "content": "Paper Title: Fantasia3D: Disentangling Geometry and Appearance for High-quality Text-to-3D Content Creation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGiven a learned DMTet with geometry parameters ψ𝜓\\psi, we aim for photorealistic surface rendering to better leverage the powerful image diffusion model. This is achieved by introducing into text-to-3D generation the Physically-Based Rendering (PBR) material model. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the material model we use [ref]21 comprises three components, namely the diffuse term kd∈ℝ3subscript𝑘𝑑superscriptℝ3k_{d}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}, the roughness and metallic term kr​m∈ℝ2subscript𝑘𝑟𝑚superscriptℝ2k_{rm}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}, and the normal variation term kn∈ℝ3subscript𝑘𝑛superscriptℝ3k_{n}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}. The kdsubscript𝑘𝑑k_{d} term denotes the diffuse value, while the kr​msubscript𝑘𝑟𝑚k_{rm} term encompasses the roughness r𝑟r and metalness m𝑚m; the roughness r𝑟r serves as a metric for measuring the extent of specular reflection and a parameter of the GGX [ref]42 normal distribution function in the rendering equation. The metalness parameter m𝑚m and diffuse value kdsubscript𝑘𝑑k_{d} can be used to compute the specular term kssubscript𝑘𝑠k_{s} using ks=(1−m)⋅0.04+m⋅kdsubscript𝑘𝑠⋅1𝑚0.04⋅𝑚subscript𝑘𝑑k_{s}=(1-m)\\cdot 0.04+m\\cdot k_{d}. Furthermore, we use a normal variation knsubscript𝑘𝑛k_{n} in tangent space to enhance the surface lighting effect and introduce additional geometric variations. We use an MLP ΓΓ\\Gamma as our parameterized material model. ΓΓ\\Gamma is learned to predict spatially varying material parameters, which are subsequently used to render the surface extracted from DMTet. More specifically, for any point p∈ℝ3𝑝superscriptℝ3p\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3} on the surface, we use hash-grid positional encoding [ref]27, and generate the diffuse term kdsubscript𝑘𝑑k_{d}, the specular term kr​msubscript𝑘𝑟𝑚k_{rm}, and the tangent space normal knsubscript𝑘𝑛k_{n} as: where β𝛽\\beta is the positional encoding of p𝑝p, and γ𝛾\\gamma parameterizes the MLP ΓΓ\\Gamma.\nThe basic rendering equation suggests that each image pixel at a specific viewing direction can be rendered as where L𝐿L is the rendered pixel color along the direction ω𝜔\\omega from the surface point p𝑝p, Ω={ωi:ωi⋅np≥0}Ωconditional-setsubscript𝜔𝑖⋅subscript𝜔𝑖subscript𝑛𝑝0\\Omega=\\left\\{\\mathbf{\\omega}_{i}:\\mathbf{\\omega}_{i}\\cdot n_{p}\\geq 0\\right\\} denotes a hemisphere with the incident direction ωisubscript𝜔𝑖\\omega_{i} and surface normal npsubscript𝑛𝑝n_{p} at p𝑝p, Lisubscript𝐿𝑖L_{i} is the incident light that is represented by an off-the-shelf environment map , and f𝑓f is the BRDF determined by the material parameters (kd,kr​m,kn)subscript𝑘𝑑subscript𝑘𝑟𝑚subscript𝑘𝑛(k_{d},k_{rm},k_{n}) predicted by (6).\nWe note that L𝐿L is the summation of diffuse intensity Ldsubscript𝐿𝑑L_{d} and specular intensity Lssubscript𝐿𝑠L_{s}, and the two terms can be computed as follows: where F𝐹F, G𝐺G, and D𝐷D represent the Fresnel term, the shadowing-mask term, and the GGX distribution of normal, respectively. Following , the hemisphere integration can be calculated using the split-sum method. By aggregating the rendered pixel colors along the direction ω𝜔\\omega (i.e., camera pose), we have the rendered image x={L​(p,ω)}𝑥𝐿𝑝𝜔x=\\{L(p,\\omega)\\} that connects with the image encoder of the pre-trained stable diffusion model. We update the parameters γ𝛾\\gamma by computing the gradient of the SDS loss w.r.t. γ𝛾\\gamma: Notations in (9) are similarly defined as those in (5). Texturing. Given the trained ΓΓ\\Gamma, we proceed by sampling the generated appearance as 2D texture maps, in accordance with the UV map generated by the xatlas . Note that texture seams would emerge by direct incorporation of the sampled 2D textures into graphics engines (e.g., Blender ). We instead employ the UV edge padding technique , which involves expanding the boundaries of UV islands and filling empty regions. As illustrated in Fig. 5, this padding technique removes background pixels in the texture map and also removes the seams in the resulting renderings. Implementation Details. We implement the network ΨΨ\\Psi as a three-layer MLP with 32 hidden units, and implement ΓΓ\\Gamma as a two-layer MLP with 32 hidden units. Our method is optimized on 8 Nvidia RTX 3090 GPUs for about 15 minutes for learning ΨΨ\\Psi and about 16 minutes for learning ΓΓ\\Gamma, respectively, where we use AdamW optimizer with the respective learning rates of 1×10−31superscript1031\\times 10^{-3} and 1×10−21superscript1021\\times 10^{-2}. For each iteration, we uniformly sample 24 camera poses for the rendering of normal maps and colored images. More details of our implementation are available in the supplemental material. In geometry modeling, we set ω​(t)=σ2𝜔𝑡superscript𝜎2\\omega(t)=\\sigma^{2} during the early phase and then transition to w​(t)=σ2​1−σ2𝑤𝑡superscript𝜎21superscript𝜎2w(t)=\\sigma^{2}\\sqrt{1-\\sigma^{2}} as we progress to the later phase. In appearance modeling, we apply w​(t)=σ2​1−σ2𝑤𝑡superscript𝜎21superscript𝜎2w(t)=\\sigma^{2}\\sqrt{1-\\sigma^{2}} during the early phase, followed by a shift to 1/σ21superscript𝜎21/\\sigma^{2} as we enter the later phase. This approach mitigates the issue related to over-saturated color within the appearance modeling.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: powerful image diffusion model.
