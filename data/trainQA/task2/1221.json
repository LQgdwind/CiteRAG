      "content": "Paper Title: IFSS-Net: Interactive Few-Shot Siamese Network for Faster Muscle Segmentation and Propagation in Volumetric Ultrasound\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nQuantification of muscle volume is a useful biomarker for degenerative neuromuscular disease progression or sports performance.\nMeasuring muscle volume often requires the segmentation of 3D images. While Magnetic Resonance (MR) is the modality of preference for imaging muscles, 3D Ultrasound (US) offers a real-time, inexpensive, and portable alternative.\nThe motivation of our work is to assist the segmentation and volume computation of the low limb muscles from 3D freehand ultrasound volumes.\nHowever, the methods here developed are general and may be of interest for other clinical applications requiring the segmentation of organs in 3D ultrasound images  1, as well for other modalities such MRI  or CT volumes . In spite of being very time consuming and operator dependent, neuromuscular studies often rely on fully manual segmentation of 3D anatomical structures 2 3. It is therefore essential to develop automatic segmentation or propagation methods to aid such studies. Automatic muscle segmentation task in 3D US should address several challenges including the anatomical variability such as the lack of contrast or texture differences between individual muscles, as well the US modality challenges such as missing boundary or inhomogeneous intensity distributions .\nPropagating a sub-volume mask to fill an entire volume presents additional difficulties such as the changes in position, shape and appearance of the muscle due to the physics of the US beam or the probe’s motion 1. Deep learning-based methods have made successful progress in the analysis of ultrasound images and videos for fetal localization 4, breast and liver lesions classification 5 6, cervical muscle segmentation7, landmark tracking in liver sequences , and knee cartilage tracking 1.\nThe success of such fully-supervised methods relies on the availability of large datasets requiring the annotation by clinical experts at scale.\nAnnotating ultrasound images at scale is a non-trivial, expensive, irreproducible and time-consuming task, especially when dealing with 3D or sequential data. The interest has recently shifted towards learning from a limited quantity of annotated data such as few-shot learning8 or self-supervision9. Kotia et.al.[ref]3 discussed few shot learning for medical imaging domain and addressed the problem of dependency on the availability of training data. To learn representations from unlabelled input data, self-learning methods commonly rely on auxiliary tasks, such as image reconstruction 0 1 or context restoration 2. Self-supervision may also exploit pseudo-labelling 3 wherein unannotated data are relabelled and reused for fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning segmentation and propagation method for 3D US data, which requires few-shot expert annotated slices per 3D volume, on average 48 annotations out of 1400 slices, and leverages unannotated sub-volumes using sequential pseudo-labelling. To produce a fast and accurate muscle segmentation, suitable for reliable volume computation, we design a minimal interactive setting. Explicitly, we ask the expert to provide as initialization the first sub-volume (i.e. the muscle mask for three contiguous slices). Similar to Wug et.al.4, we leverage the coherence of the 2D masks over the volume depth, to propagate the reference mask sub-volume. In practice, we design a Siamese network to capture a common feature representation between ultrasound and mask sub-volumes. The reference can either come from an annotated part of the volume or from prior predictions. The common representation is further enforced with a global feature matching module 5. The relationship between masks further away, encoding shape and structure changes at a larger scale are dealt with a Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-CLSTM). An overview of our model Interactive Few Shot Siamese Network (IFSS-Net) is presented in Fig. 1. To guarantee the model convergence with limited annotated data, we propose a decremental learning strategy. While we start feeding sub-volumes with labeled slices, we progressively reduce the proportion of expert annotations required for every new volume used for training, replacing them by predictions from the model. Finally, to handle the class-imbalance between foreground and background pixels, we modify the Tversky loss3 to adaptively learn the weights that penalize False Positives (FP) and False Negatives (FN). We validate our approach for the segmentation, label propagation, and volume computation of the low-limb muscles, namely: the Gastrocnemius Medialis (GM), the Gastrocnemius Lateralis (GL), and the Soleus (SOL). We consider a dataset of 444444 subjects and 616006160061600 images, split into 292929 participants (406004060040600 images) for training, 5 participants (700070007000 images) for validation and a test set of 10 participants (140001400014000 images). We consider a fully-supervised setting to build an upper-bound reference. Then, we demonstrate our method’s capability to learn from a few annotations under a simulated weakly-supervised regime, keeping only 3,5% of the annotations (1420 images) and exploiting the remaining “unannotated” images (39180 images) with sequential pseudo labeling. The model’s generalization was evaluated over a test set, resulting in a Dice score coefficient of over 95%percent9595\\%. We first evaluate the model’s performance when considering the volumetric segmentation task alone (without propagation). We refer to this model as Seg-Net-FS. This simplified approach allows for the comparison to other three state-of-the-art volumetric segmentation methods: 3D U-Net [ref]8, V-Net 0 and DAF3D . We then consider the full IFFSS-Net, which combines the segmentation and propagation tasks, and evaluate its performance under both weak (3,5% of the annotations) and full supervision (100% of the annotations), comparing it to the recent mask-tracking method PG-Net 4. We also compare the performance of Seg-Net-FS with IFSS-Net to highlight the performance gain. Finally, to extensively assess the performance of our method, we designed several ablation setups to study the contribution of each proposed module. Finally, non-learning techniques were also considered for comparison. The main contributions of this work are: A novel deep learning method for segmentation and muscle mask propagation in volumetric US data, towards accurate volume quantification. A sequential pseudo-labeling strategy for weak supervision to train from few annotated 2D US slices and exploit sequential unannotated slices. A bidirectional spatiotemporal model to adapt to complex muscle shapes and textural changes over volume. A decremental update of the objective function to guide the model convergence in the absence of large amounts of annotated data and to inducing a few-shot setting. A parametric Tversky loss function that learns to adaptively penalize false positives and false negatives.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: when dealing with 3D or sequential data.
