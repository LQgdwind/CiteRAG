      "content": "Paper Title: DiffAugment: Diffusion based Long-Tailed Visual Relationship Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLong-tailed Visual Relationship Recognition\nThere are several works pertaining to Visual Relationship Recognition in long-tailed data distribution. The first work in this direction, [ref]2 introduced a novel augmentation strategy called RelMix and a visio-linguistic hubless (VilHub) loss to adapt a base approach for Visual Relationship Recognition (LSVRU ) to the long-tail scenario. RelMix is inspired from Manifold Mixup  and combines the visual embeddings of different triplets belonging to tail/medium classes along with their expected predictions to augment the training data. VilHub loss encourages the average probability of each class being predicted in a batch to be close to uniform, i.e. equally preferred across head and tail. While our approach is essentially an augmentation strategy too, it employs a Diffusion Model to generate the foundation Faster-RCNN [ref]24 based visual features rather than the approach-specific refined features and can be used on top of any model trained using RelMix and VilHub. RelMix is an end-to-end augmentation strategy and needs a VRR model to be trained from scratch whereas our diffusion based augmentation needs only fine-tuning of already trained VRR models.\nAnother state-of-the-art work for LTVRR titled RelTransformer [ref]5 uses two Transformer  based encoders - one to represent the global scene context and another for the relation. The global scene context encoder guides the relation encoder through meshed attention. Further, it also uses a novel memory attention module to allow the relation representation information to be shared across the entire dataset to alleviate the frequency bias. ViTSCG  uses Vision Transformer  and Masking with overlapped area (MOA) module  to first extract the subject and object features. Now, to obtain the relation features, it uses spatially conditioned graph  which is a graph neural network designed to jointly reason about the appearance and spatial information of an image. Finally, the subject, object and relation features are refined using the RelTransformer module [ref]5 as explained earlier and passed on to the MLP classifiers for prediction. Our DiffAugment strategy can be utilised for both these approaches by augmenting the features that are input to the RelTransformer module.\nDiffusion Models (DM)  are a recently introduced class of generative models which have shown promising results in numerous generative applications including image super-resolution , image editing  , speech synthesis   , voice conversion  and text-to-speech . The basic DM architecture has been improved in various ways recently with attempts to improve the diversity and quality of the generated images while reducing the training and sampling time    . Some recent works such as Class-Balancing Diffusion Model (CBDM)  also venture towards maintaining the sample quality and diversity when training Diffusion Models on imbalanced datasets. In this paper, we make use of the simplest version of Diffusion Models called Latent Diffusion Models with Cross-Attention based conditioning . Improvements in LTVRR by using advanced Diffusion Models has been left to be explored in the future.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Long-tailed Visual Relationship Recognition\nThere are several works pertaining to Visual Relationship Recognition in long-tailed data distribution.
