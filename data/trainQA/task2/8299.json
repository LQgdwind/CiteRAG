      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Computational Cost of Bayesian Optimization for Controller Tuning with a Multi-stage Tuning Framework\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we will describe the methodology followed to tune all of the controllers in the UUV simultaneously as a single trajectory-tracking problem. Following the framework described in Section 4.1, we define the trajectory tracking control tuning problem as a single-stage (ng=1subscript𝑛𝑔1n_{g}=1) problem with the parameters presented in Table 1. The tuning problem becomes a standard, single optimization task where all 18 control parameters (𝝃∈ℜ18𝝃superscript18\\boldsymbol{\\xi}\\in\\Re^{18}) must be tuned simultaneously using a BO approach for a trajectory tracking task. For the purpose of this paper, we tune the controllers to complete a single square-shaped trajectory in the X​Y𝑋𝑌XY plane defined by way-point matrix γ∈ℳ8×6𝛾subscriptℳ86\\gamma\\in\\mathcal{M}_{8\\times 6} where the z𝑧z position and the attitude angles (ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi, θ𝜃\\theta, ψ𝜓\\psi) must be kept at a value of 0 during the whole trajectory tracking task. In Section 6.1 we can find a graphical representation of the target trajectory; we refer the reader to our repository for more details on the trajectory parameters (https://github.com/mjares/BOpt_AutoTuning_ECC25.git). The assumption of local search is very common in control auto-tuning as an optimization problem [ref]7, particularly for BO-based auto-tuning, due to its limitations regarding dimensionality. Unfortunately, how to define these local search spaces is a topic that is, either not discussed, or poorly discussed in most recent works on control auto-tuning [ref]6[ref]7, where these restricted spaces are apparently defined arbitrarily, when there is probably some degree of expert knowledge involved. We acknowledge this is still an open issue in control auto-tuning, however, it falls outside the scope of this paper. We define a local search space ΞR1superscriptsubscriptΞ𝑅1\\Xi_{R}^{1} for our tuning approach by manually tuning the controllers following the methodology in 4, and then arbitrarily selecting max-min ranges around this manually tuned solution. The resulting search space for the optimization task is presented in Table 2: A maximum episode time was set to Km​a​x​T=100​ssubscript𝐾𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑇100𝑠K_{max}T=100s for the whole tuning process, however, an episode can end earlier if the trajectory is completed before 100​s100𝑠100s.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: for more details on the trajectory parameters (https://github.com/mjares/BOpt_AutoTuning_ECC25.git).
