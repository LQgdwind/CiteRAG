      "content": "Paper Title: Vertical Symbolic Regression via Deep Policy Gradient\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently AI has been highlighted to enable scientific discoveries in diverse domains   .\nEarly work in this domain focuses on learning logic (symbolic) representations .\nRecently, there has been extensive research on learning algebraic equations  1 and differential learning differential equations from data    [ref]27   0 1 2 3 4.\nIn this domain, a line of works develops robots that automatically refine the hypothesis space, some with human interactions  5 6 7.\nThese works are quite related to ours because they also actively probe the hypothesis spaces, albeit they are in biology and chemistry. Existing works on multi-variable regression are mainly based on pre-trained encoder-decoder methods with massive training datasets (e.g., millions of data points 8), and even larger-scale generative models (e.g., approximately 100 million parameters 9).\nOur Vsr-Dpg algorithm is a tailored algorithm to solve multi-variable symbolic regression problems. The idea of using a control variable experiment tightly connects to the BACON system    6 7 . Our method develops on the current popular deep recurrent neural network while their method is a rule-based system, due to the historical limitation. Our method connects to the symbolic regression method using probabilistic context-free grammar   . They use a fixed probability to sample rules, we use a deep neural network to learn the probability distribution. Our Vsr-Dpg is also tightly connected to deep symbolic regression  1. We both use deep recurrent networks to predict a sequence of tokens that can be composed into a symbolic expression. However, their method predicts the preorder traversal sequence for the expression tree while our method predicts the sequence of production rules for the expression.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: focuses on learning logic (symbolic) representations .\nRecently, there has been extensive research on learning algebraic equations  1 and differential learning differential equations from data    [ref]27   0 1 2 3 4.\nIn this domain, a line of works develops robots that automatically refine the hypothesis space, some with human interactions  5 6 7.\nThese works are quite related to ours because\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
