      "content": "Paper Title: Faster algorithms on linear delta-matroids\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor a survey on delta-matroids, see Moffatt .\nIn particular, as is well-surveyed by Moffatt,\nthere has been a recent resurgence of interest in delta-matroids\nfor studying graph embeddings in non-planar surfaces  .\nSpecifically, there is a class of delta-matroids that captures\nso-called quasi-trees of ribbon graphs,\nwhich generalizes graphic matroids to embedded graphs\nin a way that also captures the structure of the embedding.\nIn addition, delta-matroids have had applications\nin structural matroid theory, via so-called twisted matroids  ,\nand in structural graph theory, by the close association between\nthe vertex minor and pivot minor operations on graphs,\nand twists of delta-matroids   [ref]41\n(cf. ). Algorithms on matroids.\nAs mentioned, Linear DM Parity\nand related problems generalize Linear Matroid Parity.\nwhich in turn generalizes Linear Matroid Intersection.\nThe fastest algorithm for Linear Matroid Parity runs in O​(n​rω−1)𝑂𝑛superscript𝑟𝜔1O(nr^{\\omega-1}) operations\nwhere n𝑛n is the size of the ground set and r𝑟r the rank .\nThe weighted case can be solved in O~​(W​m​rω)~𝑂𝑊𝑚superscript𝑟𝜔\\tilde{O}(Wmr^{\\omega}) where W𝑊W\nis the maximum weight of a pair , and was more\nrecently shown to be solvable in strongly combinatorial time O​(n​r3)𝑂𝑛superscript𝑟3O(nr^{3})\nvia a complex algorithm of Iwata and Kobayashi .\nFor Matroid Intersection and other problems tractable\non general matroids, there is an active pursuit of efficient algorithms\nwhose running time is measured in terms of the number of oracle queries\nover the matroid   . Path-packing problems.\nIn the Shortest Disjoint 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S}-Paths problem, the task\nis to find a 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S}-path packing of k𝑘k paths with shortest total\nlength in the presence of non-negative edge weights.\nYamaguchi  reduces this to Weighted Linear Matroid Parity.\n𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S}-path packings have been generalized to non-zero paths in\ngroup-labelled graphs 1 0\nand so-called non-returning paths  ,\nwith some connection to matroid representations.\nSee also  . Boolean edge CSP and Boolean planar CSP.\nDelta-matroid parity problems also occur in the context of restricted\nversions of the Boolean CSP problems. Feder 0\nconsidered the Boolean CSP over a constraint language ΓΓ\\Gamma,\nwith the additional restriction that every variable occurs in only two\nconstraints. This has been referred to as the Boolean edge CSP ,\nas such instances can be represented by an undirected graph where\nthe edges are variables and vertices are constraints.\nFeder showed (assuming ΓΓ\\Gamma contains constants) that this problem is as hard as the unrestricted CSP over ΓΓ\\Gamma,\nunless every constraint in ΓΓ\\Gamma is a delta-matroid.\nIn the latter case, the Boolean edge CSP reduces to DM Parity\nand although the complexity for this problem is open in general,222Although DM Parity is intractable in general, the form created by this reduction\nis as a direct sum over constant-sized components;\nhence the general intractability results do not apply.\n\nmany tractable cases are known. In particular, Kazda et al. \nshowed that the problem is in P if every delta-matroid is even.\nWe note that if the constraints form (projected) linear delta-matroids,\nrepresentable over a common field, then via Weighted DM Parity\nwe can find a feasible solution of maximum or minimum Hamming weight. Another restriction where delta-matroids are surprisingly relevant is\nthe Boolean planar CSP. Here, the CSP instances are restricted\nto having planar incidence graphs. Similarly to above, let ΓΓ\\Gamma\nbe Boolean constraint language, and assume that the unrestricted CSP\nover ΓΓ\\Gamma is intractable (as otherwise there is no reason to study\nspecial cases). Dvorák and Kupec 8 showed that\neither the planar CSP over ΓΓ\\Gamma is intractable, or the\nproblem reduces to Boolean edge CSP for a constraint language Γ′superscriptΓ′\\Gamma^{\\prime}\nwhere every constraint is an even delta-matroid. Thus by Kazda et al. ,\nthere is a dichotomy of Boolean planar CSP as being in P or NP-hard,\nwhere the (new) tractable cases correspond to DM Parity. Parameterized complexity.\nAs mentioned, linear matroids and related tools have seen significant\napplications in parameterized\ncomplexity   1 9.\nRecently, Wahlström extended the kernelization aspect of these tools\nto delta-matroids, and used it to show a sparsification result related\nto Mader’s path-packing problem in terminal networks .\nIn another direction, Eiben et al. gave a general method\nfor constructing efficient FPT algorithms by combining multivariate\ngenerating polynomials with linear matroid side constraints 9.\nApplying this to the Pfaffians of the linear delta-matroids constructed in this paper\nshould give a number of immediate FPT consequences.\nWe defer deeper investigations into these connections to later research.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: theory, via so-called twisted matroids  ,\nand in structural graph theory, by the close association between\nthe vertex minor and pivot minor operations on graphs,\nand twists of delta-matroids   [ref]41\n(cf. ). Algorithms on matroids.\nAs mentioned, Linear DM Parity\nand related problems generalize Linear Matroid Parity.\nwhich in turn generalizes Linear Matroid Intersection.\nThe fastest\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
