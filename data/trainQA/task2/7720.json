A Gröbner basis of an ideal I𝐼I in R𝑅R is defined as a special kind of generating set for I𝐼I, and it gives a computational tool to determine many properties of I𝐼I.\nA typical application of computing Gröbner bases is solving the multivariate polynomial (MP) problem:\nGiven a sequence 𝑭=(f1,…,fm)𝑭subscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑚\\bm{F}=(f_{1},\\ldots,f_{m}) of m𝑚m polynomials f1,…,fmsubscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑚f_{1},\\ldots,f_{m} in R∖{0}𝑅0R\\smallsetminus\\{0\\}, find (a1,…,an)∈Knsubscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑛superscript𝐾𝑛(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n})\\in K^{n} such that fi​(a1,…,an)=0subscript𝑓𝑖subscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑛0f_{i}(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n})=0 for all i𝑖i with 1≤i≤m1𝑖𝑚1\\leq i\\leq m.\nA particular case where f1,…,fmsubscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑚f_{1},\\ldots,f_{m} are all quadratic is called the MQ problem, and its hardness is applied to constructing public-key cryptosystems and digital signature schemes that are expected to be quantum resistant.\nTherefore, analyzing the complexity of computing Gröbner bases is one of the most important problems both in theory and in practice. An algorithm for computing Gröbner bases was proposed first by Buchberger , and so far a number of its improvements such as the F4subscript𝐹4F_{4}  and F5subscript𝐹5F_{5}  algorithms have been proposed.\nIn determining the complexity of computing Gröbner bases, as we will see in the first paragraph of Subsection 2.2 below, one of the most important cases is the case where the input system is zero-dimensional and where the monomial ordering is graded (i.e., degree-compatible), and we focus on that case in the rest of this paper.\nNamely, we suppose that the input sequence 𝑭=(f1,…,fm)𝑭subscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑚\\bm{F}=(f_{1},\\ldots,f_{m}) admits a finite number of zeros in 𝔸K¯nsubscriptsuperscript𝔸𝑛¯𝐾\\mathbb{A}^{n}_{\\overline{K}} (resp. ℙK¯n−1subscriptsuperscriptℙ𝑛1¯𝐾\\mathbb{P}^{n-1}_{\\overline{K}}) if 𝑭𝑭\\bm{F} is affine (resp. homogeneous), and we consider a monomial ordering ≺precedes\\prec on R𝑅R that compares monomials first by their total degrees, e.g., a degree reverse lexicographical (DRL) ordering.\nThen, the complexity of the Gröbner basis computation for F={f1,…,fm}𝐹subscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑚F=\\{f_{1},\\ldots,f_{m}\\} is estimated as a function of the solving degree(s):\nTo the authors’ best knowledge, there are three (in fact four) kinds of definitions of solving\ndegree, and they will be rigorously described in Subsection 2.2 below.\nIn the first definition, the solving degree is defined as the highest degree of the polynomials involved during the Gröbner basis computation.\nSince this solving degree depends on an algorithm 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} that one adopts, we denote it by sd≺𝒜​(F)superscriptsubscriptsdprecedes𝒜𝐹\\mathrm{sd}_{\\prec}^{\\mathcal{A}}(F).\nOn the other hand, in the second and the third definitions, which were originally provided in a series of Gorla et al.’s studies (cf. [ref]7, , , , [ref]21), we can see that the solving degrees do not depend on an algorithm, but only on F𝐹F and ≺precedes\\prec.\nThe solving degree in the second (resp. third) definition is defined by using Macaulay matrices (resp. those with mutants), and it is denoted by sd≺mac​(F)superscriptsubscriptsdprecedesmac𝐹\\mathrm{sd}_{\\prec}^{\\rm mac}(F) (resp. sd≺mut​(F)superscriptsubscriptsdprecedesmut𝐹\\mathrm{sd}_{\\prec}^{\\rm mut}(F)) in this paper, where the subscripts “mac” and “mut” stand for Macaulay matrices and mutants respectively.\nNote that, when F𝐹F is homogeneous, these three solving degrees coincide with one another (for 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} with suitable setting) and we call them the solving degree simply;\nthey are equal to the maximal Gröbner basis degree max.GB.deg≺​(F)formulae-sequencemaxGBsubscriptdegprecedes𝐹\\mathrm{max.GB.deg}_{\\prec}(F) of F𝐹F with respect to ≺precedes\\prec.\nIn this case, we can apply a well-known bound [29, Theorem 2] by Lazard.\nIn the following, we mainly treat with the case where F𝐹F is affine. In their celebrated works (cf. [ref]7, , , , [ref]21), Gorla et al. have studied well the relations between the solving degrees sd≺mac​(F)superscriptsubscriptsdprecedesmac𝐹\\mathrm{sd}_{\\prec}^{\\rm mac}(F) and sd≺mut​(F)superscriptsubscriptsdprecedesmut𝐹\\mathrm{sd}_{\\prec}^{\\rm mut}(F) and other invariants such as the degree of regularity and the Castelnuovo–Mumford regularity.\nTheir results provide a mathematically rigorous framework for estimating the complexity of computing Gröbner bases.\nIn particular, Caminata-Gorla [ref]7 proved the following upper-bound on sd≺mac​(F)superscriptsubscriptsdprecedesmac𝐹\\mathrm{sd}_{\\prec}^{\\rm mac}(F) by using Lazard’s bound: ([7, Theorem 11]) When K=𝔽q𝐾subscript𝔽𝑞K=\\mathbb{F}_{q}, the solving degree sd≺mac​(F)superscriptsubscriptsdprecedesmac𝐹\\mathrm{sd}_{\\prec}^{\\rm mac}(F) for a DRL ordering ≺precedes\\prec can be upper-bounded by the Macaulay bound d1+⋯+dℓ−ℓ+1subscript𝑑1⋯subscript𝑑ℓℓ1d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{\\ell}-\\ell+1 with d1≥d2≥⋯≥dmsubscript𝑑1subscript𝑑2⋯subscript𝑑𝑚d_{1}\\geq d_{2}\\geq\\cdots\\geq d_{m} and ℓ=min⁡{n+1,ℓ}ℓ𝑛1ℓ\\ell=\\min\\{n+1,\\ell\\}, if F𝐹F contains the field equations xiq−xisuperscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖𝑞subscript𝑥𝑖x_{i}^{q}-x_{i} for all 1≤i≤n1𝑖𝑛1\\leq i\\leq n. As for upper-bounds on the solving degrees sd≺𝒜​(F)superscriptsubscriptsdprecedes𝒜𝐹\\mathrm{sd}_{\\prec}^{\\mathcal{A}}(F) and sd≺mut​(F)superscriptsubscriptsdprecedesmut𝐹\\mathrm{sd}_{\\prec}^{\\rm mut}(F), we know the following: Semaev-Tenti  (see also Tenti’s PhD thesis ) constructed a Buchberger-like algorithm 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} for the case K=𝔽q𝐾subscript𝔽𝑞K=\\mathbb{F}_{q} such that sd≺𝒜​(F)≤2​D−2superscriptsubscriptsdprecedes𝒜𝐹2𝐷2\\mathrm{sd}_{\\prec}^{\\mathcal{A}}(F)\\leq 2D-2 with D:=dreg​(⟨Ftop⟩)assign𝐷subscript𝑑regdelimited-⟨⟩superscript𝐹topD:=d_{\\rm reg}(\\langle F^{\\rm top}\\rangle) for a DRL ordering ≺precedes\\prec, assuming that {xiq−xi:1≤i≤n}⊂Fconditional-setsuperscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖𝑞subscript𝑥𝑖1𝑖𝑛𝐹\\{x_{i}^{q}-x_{i}:1\\leq i\\leq n\\}\\subset F and max⁡{q,deg⁡(f1),…,deg⁡(fm)}≤D𝑞degreesubscript𝑓1…degreesubscript𝑓𝑚𝐷\\max\\{q,\\deg(f_{1}),\\ldots,\\deg(f_{m})\\}\\leq D.\nHere dreg​(⟨Ftop⟩)subscript𝑑regdelimited-⟨⟩superscript𝐹topd_{\\rm reg}(\\langle F^{\\rm top}\\rangle) is the degree of regularity for Ftopsuperscript𝐹topF^{\\rm top}, i.e., the smallest integer d𝑑d with Rd=⟨Ftop⟩dsubscript𝑅𝑑subscriptdelimited-⟨⟩superscript𝐹top𝑑R_{d}=\\langle F^{\\rm top}\\rangle_{d}, where Rdsubscript𝑅𝑑R_{d} denotes the homogeneous part (component) of degree d𝑑d and where we set Id=I∩Rdsubscript𝐼𝑑𝐼subscript𝑅𝑑I_{d}=I\\cap R_{d} for a homogeneous ideal I𝐼I of R𝑅R. Caminata-Gorla proved in [8, Theorem 3.1] that sd≺mut(F)=max{dF,max.GB.deg≺(F)}\\mathrm{sd}_{\\prec}^{\\rm mut}(F)=\\max\\{d_{F},{\\rm max.GB.deg}_{{\\prec}}(F)\\} for any graded monomial ordering ≺precedes\\prec, where dFsubscript𝑑𝐹d_{F} denotes the last fall degree of F𝐹F defined in [8, Definition 1.5] (originally in , ).\nRecently, Salizzoni  also proved sd≺mut​(F)≤D+1superscriptsubscriptsdprecedesmut𝐹𝐷1\\mathrm{sd}_{\\prec}^{\\rm mut}(F)\\leq D+1, in the case where max⁡{deg⁡(f1),…,deg⁡(fm)}≤D<∞degreesubscript𝑓1…degreesubscript𝑓𝑚𝐷\\max\\{\\deg(f_{1}),\\ldots,\\deg(f_{m})\\}\\leq D<\\infty. In this paper, by a mathematically rigorous way following Gorla et al.’s works, we study the solving degrees and related Gröbner bases of affine semi-regular polynomial sequences, where a sequence 𝑭=(f1,…,fm)∈(R∖K)m𝑭subscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑚superscript𝑅𝐾𝑚\\bm{F}=(f_{1},\\ldots,f_{m})\\in(R\\smallsetminus K)^{m} of (not necessarily homogeneous) polynomials is said to be affine semi-regular (resp. affine cryptographic semi-regular) if 𝑭top=(f1top,…,fmtop)superscript𝑭topsuperscriptsubscript𝑓1top…superscriptsubscript𝑓𝑚top\\bm{F}^{\\rm top}=(f_{1}^{\\rm top},\\ldots,f_{m}^{\\rm top}) is semi-regular (resp. cryptographic semi-regular), see Definitions 2.1.3, 2.1.9, and 2.1.12 for details.\nNote that homogeneous semi-regular sequences are conjectured by Pardue [34, Conjecture B] to be generic sequences of polynomials (see e.g.,  for the definition of genericness), and affine (cryptographic) semi-regular sequences are often appearing in the construction of multivariate public key cryptosystems and digital signature schemes.\nAs a sequel of the authors’ previous work ,\nwe investigate further results on the solving degrees and on behaviors of the computation of Gröbner bases. As the first main result in this paper, we revisit the result in our previous paper  with some additional remarks, which shall give an explicit characterization (Theorem 1 below) of the Hilbert function and the Hilbert-Poincaré series associated to the homogenization Fhsuperscript𝐹ℎF^{h}.\nThis characterization is useful to analyze the Gröbner basis computation for both F𝐹F and Fhsuperscript𝐹ℎF^{h}. With notation as above, assume that 𝐅𝐅\\bm{F} is affine cryptographic semi-regular, and put D:=dreg​(⟨Ftop⟩)assign𝐷subscript𝑑regdelimited-⟨⟩superscript𝐹topD:=d_{\\rm reg}(\\langle F^{\\rm top}\\rangle).\nThen, we have the following: For each d𝑑d with d<D𝑑𝐷d<D, we have HFR′/⟨Fh⟩​(d)=HFR/⟨Ftop⟩​(d)+HFR′/⟨Fh⟩​(d−1)subscriptHFsuperscript𝑅′delimited-⟨⟩superscript𝐹ℎ𝑑subscriptHF𝑅delimited-⟨⟩superscript𝐹top𝑑subscriptHFsuperscript𝑅′delimited-⟨⟩superscript𝐹ℎ𝑑1{\\rm HF}_{R^{\\prime}/\\langle F^{h}\\rangle}(d)={\\rm HF}_{R/\\langle F^{\\rm top}\\rangle}(d)+{\\rm HF}_{{R^{\\prime}}/\\langle F^{h}\\rangle}(d-1), and hence HFR′/⟨Fh⟩​(d)=∑i=0dHFR/⟨Ftop⟩​(i)subscriptHFsuperscript𝑅′delimited-⟨⟩superscript𝐹ℎ𝑑superscriptsubscript𝑖0𝑑subscriptHF𝑅delimited-⟨⟩superscript𝐹top𝑖{\\rm HF}_{R^{\\prime}/\\langle F^{h}\\rangle}(d)=\\sum_{i=0}^{d}{\\rm HF}_{R/\\langle F^{\\rm top}\\rangle}(i). The Hilbert function HFR′/⟨Fh⟩subscriptHFsuperscript𝑅′delimited-⟨⟩superscript𝐹ℎ{\\rm HF}_{R^{\\prime}/\\langle F^{h}\\rangle} is unimodal and its highest value\nis attained at d=D−1𝑑𝐷1d=D-1. In more detail, the multiplication map by y𝑦y from (R′/⟨Fh⟩)d−1subscriptsuperscript𝑅′delimited-⟨⟩superscript𝐹ℎ𝑑1(R^{\\prime}/\\langle F^{h}\\rangle)_{d-1} to (R′/⟨Fh⟩)dsubscriptsuperscript𝑅′delimited-⟨⟩superscript𝐹ℎ𝑑(R^{\\prime}/\\langle F^{h}\\rangle)_{d} is injective for d<D𝑑𝐷d<D and surjective for d≥D𝑑𝐷d\\geq D. There exists d0subscript𝑑0d_{0} such that HFR′/⟨Fh⟩​(d0)=HFR′/⟨Fh⟩​(d)subscriptHFsuperscript𝑅′delimited-⟨⟩superscript𝐹ℎsubscript𝑑0subscriptHFsuperscript𝑅′delimited-⟨⟩superscript𝐹ℎ𝑑{\\rm HF}_{R^{\\prime}/\\langle F^{h}\\rangle}(d_{0})={\\rm HF}_{R^{\\prime}/\\langle F^{h}\\rangle}(d) for all d𝑑d with d≥d0𝑑subscript𝑑0d\\geq d_{0}, namely the number of projective zeros for Fhsuperscript𝐹ℎF^{h} is finite at most.\nHere, d0subscript𝑑0d_{0} gives an upper-bound on the solving degree of Fhsuperscript𝐹ℎF^{h} (or equivalently the maximal degree of the Gröbner basis of ⟨Fh⟩delimited-⟨⟩superscript𝐹ℎ\\langle F^{h}\\rangle).

As for (3) of Theorem 1, it follows from the proof of Lazard’s bound [29, Theorem 2] that max.GB.deg≺h​(Fh)≤d0formulae-sequencemaxGBsubscriptdegsuperscriptprecedesℎsuperscript𝐹ℎsubscript𝑑0\\mathrm{max.GB.deg}_{\\prec^{h}}(F^{h})\\leq d_{0} for a DRL ordering ≺precedes\\prec (we give an explicit proof for this in Lemma 2.2.2 below), where ≺hsuperscriptprecedesℎ\\prec^{h} is the homogenization of ≺precedes\\prec.\nAs in [7, Theorem 11] recalled above, we can apply Lazard’s bound to obtaining d0≤d1+⋯+dℓ−ℓ+1subscript𝑑0subscript𝑑1⋯subscript𝑑ℓℓ1d_{0}\\leq d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{\\ell}-\\ell+1 with di=deg⁡(fi)subscript𝑑𝑖degreesubscript𝑓𝑖d_{i}=\\deg(f_{i}) and ℓ=min⁡{n+1,ℓ}ℓ𝑛1ℓ\\ell=\\min\\{n+1,\\ell\\}, assuming d1≥⋯≥dmsubscript𝑑1⋯subscript𝑑𝑚d_{1}\\geq\\cdots\\geq d_{m} in descending order.\nAs an additional result in this paper, we also obtain the following upper-bound on the solving degree of Fhsuperscript𝐹ℎF^{h}: Suppose that that d1≤d2≤⋯≤dmsubscript𝑑1subscript𝑑2⋯subscript𝑑𝑚d_{1}\\leq d_{2}\\leq\\cdots\\leq d_{m} (in ascending order) and m>n𝑚𝑛m>n.\nIf 𝑭topsuperscript𝑭top\\bm{F}^{\\rm top} satisfies a stronger condition that it is semi-regular, then the solving degree of Fhsuperscript𝐹ℎF^{h} is upper-bounded by d1+d2+⋯+dn+dm−nsubscript𝑑1subscript𝑑2⋯subscript𝑑𝑛subscript𝑑𝑚𝑛d_{1}+d_{2}+\\cdots+d_{n}+d_{m}-n.\nMoreover, if dm≤Dsubscript𝑑𝑚𝐷d_{m}\\leq D, the solving degree of Fhsuperscript𝐹ℎF^{h} is upper-bounded by d1+d2+⋯+dn+dn+1−nsubscript𝑑1subscript𝑑2⋯subscript𝑑𝑛subscript𝑑𝑛1𝑛d_{1}+d_{2}+\\cdots+d_{n}+d_{n+1}-n. Let S0subscript𝑆0S_{0} be the saturation exponent of (⟨Fh⟩:⟨y∞⟩):delimited-⟨⟩superscript𝐹ℎdelimited-⟨⟩superscript𝑦(\\langle F^{h}\\rangle:\\langle y^{\\infty}\\rangle), that is, the minimum integer s𝑠s such that (⟨Fh⟩:⟨ys⟩)=(⟨Fh⟩:⟨y∞⟩)(\\langle F^{h}\\rangle:\\langle y^{s}\\rangle)=(\\langle F^{h}\\rangle:\\langle y^{\\infty}\\rangle). Then the solving degree of Fhsuperscript𝐹ℎF^{h} is upper-bounded by D+s0𝐷subscript𝑠0D+s_{0}. Based on Theorem 1, we can explore the computations of\nreduced Gröbner bases of ⟨F⟩delimited-⟨⟩𝐹\\langle F\\rangle, ⟨Fh⟩delimited-⟨⟩superscript𝐹ℎ\\langle F^{h}\\rangle, and ⟨Ftop⟩delimited-⟨⟩superscript𝐹top\\langle F^{\\rm top}\\rangle in Section 4 below, dividing the cases into the degree less than D𝐷D or not.\nMore precisely, denoting by G𝐺G, Ghomsubscript𝐺homG_{\\rm hom}, and Gtopsubscript𝐺topG_{\\rm top} the reduced Gröbner bases of ⟨F⟩delimited-⟨⟩𝐹\\langle F\\rangle, ⟨Fh⟩delimited-⟨⟩superscript𝐹ℎ\\langle F^{h}\\rangle, and ⟨Ftop⟩delimited-⟨⟩superscript𝐹top\\langle F^{\\rm top}\\rangle respectively, where their monomial orderings are DRL ≺precedes\\prec or its extension ≺hsuperscriptprecedesℎ\\prec^{h}, we revisit [28, Section 5] and obtain more precise results: With notation as above, assume that 𝐅𝐅\\bm{F} is affine cryptographic semi-regular, and that D:=dreg​(⟨Ftop⟩)<∞assign𝐷subscript𝑑regdelimited-⟨⟩superscript𝐹topD:=d_{\\rm reg}(\\langle F^{\\rm top}\\rangle)<\\infty.

There is a strong correspondence between the computation of Ghomsubscript𝐺homG_{\\rm hom}\nand that of G𝐺G at early stages, namely, at the step degrees not greater than D𝐷D.

Note that (2) and the first half of (4) hold not necessarily assuming the affine cryptographic semi-regularity of 𝐅𝐅\\bm{F}. In particular, we rigorously prove some existing results, which are often used for analyzing the complexity of computing Gröbner bases, and moreover extend them to our case.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: the other hand, in the second and the third definitions, which were originally provided in a series of Gorla et al.’s studies (cf. [ref]7, , , , [ref]21), we can see that the solving degrees do not depend on an algorithm, but only on F𝐹F and ≺precedes\\prec.\nThe solving degree in the second (resp. third) definition is defined by\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object. Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. Generate exactly 40 titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning."
