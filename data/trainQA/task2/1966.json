      "content": "Paper Title: Solving the Workflow Satisfiability Problem using General Purpose SolversThis is an extended version of [1] published in the proceedings of the 25th ACM Symposium on Access Control Models and Technologies.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLet S𝑆S be a set of steps, U𝑈U a set of users, C𝐶C a set of non-unary constraints whose scopes are subsets of S𝑆S (called just constraints in what follows333We will formally define a constraint later in this section.) and A𝐴A an authorisation function (or, just authorisation) A:S→2U:𝐴→𝑆superscript2𝑈A:\\ S\\rightarrow 2^{U}.\nThus, every WSP instance is given by a quadruple (S,U,C,A)𝑆𝑈𝐶𝐴(S,U,C,A).\nA plan π𝜋\\pi is a function π:S→U:𝜋→𝑆𝑈\\pi:S\\rightarrow U.\nThe aim is to decide whether there is plan which is authorised i.e. π​(s)∈A​(s)𝜋𝑠𝐴𝑠\\pi(s)\\in A(s) for each s∈S𝑠𝑆s\\in S, and eligible i.e. satisfies all constraints.\nA plan is called valid if it is authorised and eligible.\nIf a WSP instance (S,U,A,C)𝑆𝑈𝐴𝐶(S,U,A,C) has a valid plan, it is called satisfiable and otherwise unsatisfiable.\nIt is easy to see that the WSP with only binary SoD constraints is NP-hard as it is equivalent to the well-known NP-hard Graph List Colouring problem [ref]22. Let us denote |S|𝑆|S| by k𝑘k and |U|𝑈|U| by n𝑛n.\nWang and Li  observed that in real-world WSP instances k𝑘k is often much smaller than n𝑛n.\nIn other words, while the instances of WSP can be large, practical values of k𝑘k are usually small.\nThis led them to introduce parametrisation of the WSP by k𝑘k.\nWe will also study this parameterisations like several other papers, cf.   [ref]23 .\nWang and Li showed that the WSP is W-hard. In fact, Wang and Li  proved the following result.\nLet ρ𝜌\\rho be a binary relation on U𝑈U and let S={s1,…,sk}𝑆subscript𝑠1…subscript𝑠𝑘S=\\left\\{s_{1},\\ldots,s_{k}\\right\\}.\nThen the WSP is W-hard if A​(s)=U𝐴𝑠𝑈A(s)=U for every s∈S𝑠𝑆s\\in S and C𝐶C consists of (k2)binomial𝑘2k\\choose 2 constraints ci,jsubscript𝑐𝑖𝑗c_{i,j} with 1≤j<i≤k1𝑗𝑖𝑘1\\leq j<i\\leq k such that a plan π𝜋\\pi satisfies ci,jsubscript𝑐𝑖𝑗c_{i,j} if and only if (π​(si),π​(sj))∈ρ𝜋subscript𝑠𝑖𝜋subscript𝑠𝑗𝜌(\\pi(s_{i}),\\pi(s_{j}))\\in\\rho.\nThe W-hardness follows by a simple reduction from the (Graph) Independent Set problem444Set ρ𝜌\\rho to be the non-adjacency relation in the input graph., which is W-hard. Let us now define a WSP constraint formally.\nA constraint c𝑐c with scope T⊆S𝑇𝑆T\\subseteq S is a pair (T,Θc),𝑇subscriptΘ𝑐(T,\\Theta_{c}), where ΘcsubscriptΘ𝑐\\Theta_{c} is a set of functions θ:T→U:𝜃→𝑇𝑈\\theta:\\ T\\rightarrow U such that c𝑐c is satisfied by a plan π𝜋\\pi if for some θ∈Θc,𝜃subscriptΘ𝑐\\theta\\in\\Theta_{c}, θ​(t)=π​(t)𝜃𝑡𝜋𝑡\\theta(t)=\\pi(t) for each t∈T𝑡𝑇t\\in T.\nFor example, the scope of a (general) SoD constraint c𝑐c is a subset T𝑇T of S𝑆S and θ∈Θc𝜃subscriptΘ𝑐\\theta\\in\\Theta_{c} if and only if θ𝜃\\theta is injective.555For an example of a non-binary WSP SoD constraint, see Constraint 1 in [12, Example 1].\nSatisfiability of essentially every real-world constraint c𝑐c by a plan π𝜋\\pi can be decided without using the formal definition of a constraint (e.g., deciding whether an SoD constraint is satisfied by a plan π𝜋\\pi can be done by a simple inspection of π𝜋\\pi).\nIn this paper, we assume that satisfiability of every constraint by a plan can be decided in polynomial time in k𝑘k and n𝑛n. Recall that a constraint is called user-independent (UI) if its satisfiability does not depend on the identities of the users.\nFor example, SoD and BoD constraints are UI.\nThe following generalisations of SoD and BoD constraints are also UI.\nThe scope of an at-least-p𝑝p-out-of-q𝑞q constraint is a subset T𝑇T of S𝑆S of size q𝑞q\nand at least p𝑝p users can be assigned to the steps of T𝑇T. Analogously, the scope of an at-most-p𝑝p-out-of-q𝑞q constraint is a subset T𝑇T of S𝑆S of size q𝑞q\nand at most p𝑝p users can be assigned to the steps of T𝑇T.\nFormally, a constraint c=(T,Θc)𝑐𝑇subscriptΘ𝑐c=(T,\\Theta_{c}) is UI if for every θ∈Θc,𝜃subscriptΘ𝑐\\theta\\in\\Theta_{c},\nand every permutation f:U→U:𝑓→𝑈𝑈f:\\ U\\rightarrow U of users there is a θ′∈Θcsuperscript𝜃′subscriptΘ𝑐\\theta^{\\prime}\\in\\Theta_{c} such that θ′​(t)=f​(θ​(t))superscript𝜃′𝑡𝑓𝜃𝑡\\theta^{\\prime}(t)=f(\\theta(t)) for each t∈T.𝑡𝑇t\\in T. To naively decide whether a WSP instance (S,U,C,A)𝑆𝑈𝐶𝐴(S,U,C,A) has a valid plan, one can generate plans one by one and check whether one of them is valid, stopping when a valid one is found.\nHowever, such an algorithm is not efficient as the total number of plans is nksuperscript𝑛𝑘n^{k}.\nSince the WSP is W-hard, it is highly unlikely that much more efficient, i.e., FPT algorithms exist for the most general case.\nHowever, there are FPT algorithms if all constraints are UI (and with no restrictions on authorisations). To describe such an algorithm, we will use the notion of a pattern introduced by Cohen et al.  but we will follow the definition of patterns from Crampton et al. [ref]24. A pattern is a partition p={S1,…,Sp}𝑝subscript𝑆1…subscript𝑆𝑝p=\\{S_{1},\\dots,S_{p}\\} of S𝑆S into non-empty subsets S1,…,Spsubscript𝑆1…subscript𝑆𝑝S_{1},\\dots,S_{p} (i.e. S1∪⋯∪Sp=Ssubscript𝑆1⋯subscript𝑆𝑝𝑆S_{1}\\cup\\dots\\cup S_{p}=S and Si∩Sj=∅subscript𝑆𝑖subscript𝑆𝑗S_{i}\\cap S_{j}=\\emptyset for every i≠j𝑖𝑗i\\neq j)\ncalled blocks. We will denote the set of all patterns of S𝑆S by P​(S)𝑃𝑆P(S).\nFor example, if S={s1,s2,s3}𝑆subscript𝑠1subscript𝑠2subscript𝑠3S=\\{s_{1},s_{2},s_{3}\\} then P​(S)={p1,p2,p3,p4,p5},𝑃𝑆subscript𝑝1subscript𝑝2subscript𝑝3subscript𝑝4subscript𝑝5P(S)=\\{p_{1},p_{2},p_{3},p_{4},p_{5}\\}, where p1={{s1},{s2},{s3}}subscript𝑝1subscript𝑠1subscript𝑠2subscript𝑠3p_{1}=\\{\\{s_{1}\\},\\{s_{2}\\},\\{s_{3}\\}\\} (every block of p1subscript𝑝1p_{1} is a singleton), p2={{s1},{s2,s3}}subscript𝑝2subscript𝑠1subscript𝑠2subscript𝑠3p_{2}=\\{\\{s_{1}\\},\\{s_{2},s_{3}\\}\\}, p3={{s2},{s1,s3}}subscript𝑝3subscript𝑠2subscript𝑠1subscript𝑠3p_{3}=\\{\\{s_{2}\\},\\{s_{1},s_{3}\\}\\}, p4={{s3},{s1,s2}}subscript𝑝4subscript𝑠3subscript𝑠1subscript𝑠2p_{4}=\\{\\{s_{3}\\},\\{s_{1},s_{2}\\}\\} and p5={{s1,s2,s3}}subscript𝑝5subscript𝑠1subscript𝑠2subscript𝑠3p_{5}=\\{\\{s_{1},s_{2},s_{3}\\}\\} (p5subscript𝑝5p_{5} has only one block). The pattern p𝑝p of a plan π𝜋\\pi is a partition of S𝑆S into blocks of steps such that all the steps in a block are assigned the same user but steps in different blocks are assigned different users.\nFor example, plan (1) has pattern p={{s1,s3},{s2},{s4},{s5},{s6}}𝑝subscript𝑠1subscript𝑠3subscript𝑠2subscript𝑠4subscript𝑠5subscript𝑠6p=\\{\\{s_{1},s_{3}\\},\\{s_{2}\\},\\{s_{4}\\},\\{s_{5}\\},\\{s_{6}\\}\\}.\nThe number of blocks in p𝑝p will be denoted by |p|.𝑝|p|.\nBy the definition of a UI constraint, a pair π′,π′′superscript𝜋′superscript𝜋′′\\pi^{\\prime},\\pi^{\\prime\\prime} of plans with the same pattern either both satisfy a UI constraint c𝑐c or both violate it .\nThus, it suffices to know the pattern of a plan π𝜋\\pi (without knowing π𝜋\\pi itself) to decide whether a UI constraint c𝑐c is satisfied by π𝜋\\pi, and we can say whether a pattern p𝑝p of S𝑆S satisfies a UI constraint c𝑐c (meaning that either all plans with pattern p𝑝p satisfy c𝑐c or none do).\nThus, we have the following observation: To decide whether a WSP instance (S,U,C,A)𝑆𝑈𝐶𝐴(S,U,C,A) with only UI constraints has an eligible plan, it suffices to go over all patterns of S𝑆S and check whether there is a pattern that satisfies all constraints in C𝐶C (we call such a pattern eligible). Recall that not every eligible plan is valid as authorisations A𝐴A have to be satisfied, too.\nFollowing Karapetyan et al. , to decide whether there exists a valid plan with an eligible pattern p𝑝p, we construct a bipartite graph Gpsubscript𝐺𝑝G_{p} with partite sets p𝑝p (where every vertex is a block of p𝑝p) and U𝑈U such that b​u∈E​(Gp)𝑏𝑢𝐸subscript𝐺𝑝bu\\in E(G_{p}) (b𝑏b is a block in p𝑝p and u∈U𝑢𝑈u\\in U) if and only if u∈A​(s)𝑢𝐴𝑠u\\in A(s) for every s∈b𝑠𝑏s\\in b.\nObserve that a plan with pattern p𝑝p is authorised if and only if Gpsubscript𝐺𝑝G_{p} contains a matching M′superscript𝑀′M^{\\prime} saturating p𝑝p, i.e. for every vertex (block) b∈p𝑏𝑝b\\in p there is an edge in M′superscript𝑀′M^{\\prime} incident to b𝑏b .\nSince k≤n𝑘𝑛k\\leq n, this means that a plan with pattern p𝑝p is authorised if and only if the size of a maximum matching M𝑀M of Gpsubscript𝐺𝑝G_{p} equals |p|𝑝|p|, the number of blocks in p𝑝p.\nIf |M|=|p|𝑀𝑝|M|=|p|, an authorised plan π𝜋\\pi corresponding to M𝑀M can be constructed as follows: π​(s)=u𝜋𝑠𝑢\\pi(s)=u if and only if s∈b𝑠𝑏s\\in b and b​u∈M𝑏𝑢𝑀bu\\in M .\nFor an example of graph Gpsubscript𝐺𝑝G_{p}, see Figure 2. This leads to a simple WSP algorithm using patterns whose pseudo-code is given in Algorithm 1, where all constraints in C are UI and UNSAT indicates that the input instance is unsatisfiable.\nA more sophisticated and much more efficient in computational experiments pattern-based backtracking algorithm was studied by Karapetyan et al. . Note that |P​(S)|𝑃𝑆|P(S)|, i.e., the number of partitions of a set of size k𝑘k, equals the k𝑘kth Bell number666All logarithms in this paper are of base 2. Bk≤k!=𝒪​(2k​log⁡k)subscript𝐵𝑘𝑘𝒪superscript2𝑘𝑘B_{k}\\leq k!=\\mathcal{O}(2^{k\\log k}).\nNow it is not hard to see that the running time of Algorithm 1 is 𝒪∗​(2k​log⁡k)superscript𝒪superscript2𝑘𝑘\\mathcal{O}^{*}(2^{k\\log k}).\nMore advanced algorithms in   for the WSP with only UI constraints are also of running time 𝒪∗​(2k​log⁡k)superscript𝒪superscript2𝑘𝑘\\mathcal{O}^{*}(2^{k\\log k}).\nIn fact, the time 𝒪∗​(2k​log⁡k)superscript𝒪superscript2𝑘𝑘\\mathcal{O}^{*}(2^{k\\log k}) is highly likely to be optimal: Cohen et al.  proved that unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails, there is no algorithm of running time 𝒪∗​(2o​(k​log⁡k))superscript𝒪superscript2𝑜𝑘𝑘\\mathcal{O}^{*}(2^{o(k\\log k)}) for the WSP with UI constraints; Gutin and Wahlström [ref]23 showed that unless the Strong ETH fails, there is no algorithm of running time 𝒪∗​(ck​log⁡k)superscript𝒪superscript𝑐𝑘𝑘\\mathcal{O}^{*}(c^{k\\log k}) for any constant c<2𝑐2c<2 for the WSP with UI constraints only.777\nThe ETH claims that 3-SAT with n𝑛n variables cannot be solved in time O​(2o​(n))𝑂superscript2𝑜𝑛O(2^{o(n)}) .\nThe Strong ETH claims that SAT with n𝑛n variables cannot be solved in time O​(cn)𝑂superscript𝑐𝑛O(c^{n}) for any c<2𝑐2c<2 .\nNote that both ETH and Strong ETH are conjectures, but they are often used to show (relative) optimality of algorithm’s complexity.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: called satisfiable and otherwise unsatisfiable.\nIt is easy to see that the WSP with only binary SoD constraints is NP-hard as it is equivalent to the well-known NP-hard Graph List Colouring problem [ref]22. Let us denote |S|𝑆|S| by k𝑘k and |U|𝑈|U| by n𝑛n.\nWang and Li  observed that in real-world WSP instances k𝑘k is often much smaller than n𝑛n.\nIn other words, while the instances of WSP can be\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
