      "content": "Paper Title: Polynomial-Time Computation of Optimal Correlated Equilibria in Two-Player Extensive-Form Games with Public Chance Moves and Beyond\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA vast body of literature in computational game theory has focused on computing Nash equilibria (NEs) in two-player zero-sum imperfect-information extensive-form games. Success stories from that endeavor include the creation of strong—in some cases superhuman—AIs for several complex games, including two-player limit Texas hold’em , two-player no-limit Texas hold’em   , and multiplayer no-limit Texas hold’em .\nNE captures strategic interactions in which each player maximizes her own utility. The interaction in NE is assumed to be fully decentralized: no communication between players is possible and the behavior of the players is not coordinated by any external orchestrator in any way.\nWhile that assumption is natural in games such as poker, NE is too restrictive in other types of strategic interactions in which partial forms of communication or centralized control are possible . Therefore, there has been growing interest around less restrictive solution concepts than NE. Correlated and coarse correlated equilibria are classic families of solution concepts that relax the assumptions of NE to allow forms of coordination of utility-maximizing agents  . In correlated and coarse correlated equilibria, a mediator that can recommend behavior—but not enforce it—complements the game. Before the interaction starts, the mediator samples a profile of recommended strategies (one for each player) from a publicly known correlated distribution. The mediator reveals the next recommended move (or sequence of moves, depending on the specific solution concept in the family) to each acting player. In correlated equilibrium, each agent must decide whether to commit to following the next recommended move (or sequence of moves) after such move or sequence of moves is revealed by the mediator. In coarse correlated equilibrium, each agent must decide whether to commit to following the next recommended move (or sequence of moves) before it is revealed by the mediator.\nIf a player chooses not to follow the recommendation, the mediator stops issuing further recommendations to that player.\nSince the selfish agents are free to not follow the recommendations, it is up to the mediator to come up with a correlated distribution of recommendations such that no agent has incentive to deviate from the recommendations, assuming no other player deviates. Despite the apparent weakness of a mediator that cannot enforce behavior but only suggest it, the maximum social welfare (that is, sum of the players’ utilities) that can be induced by these families of solution concepts is greater than the social welfare obtainable by NE.\nExamples of interactions where a mediator is natural include traffic control and load balancing . These equilibrium concepts have typically been studied in normal-form (that is, matrix) games. The study of correlation in extensive-form (that is, tree-form) games is recent, and was pioneered by von Stengel and Forges . Three correlated solution concepts are often used in extensive-form games: extensive-form correlated equilibrium (EFCE) , extensive-form coarse correlated equilibrium (EFCCE) 3, and normal-form coarse correlated equilibrium (NFCCE)   [ref]9.\nCompared to normal-form (that is, one-shot) games, extensive-form correlation poses new and different challenges, especially in settings where the agents retain private information. This is unique to the sequential nature of extensive-form games, where, fundamentally,\nplayers can adjust strategically as they make observations about their opponents and the environment 1.\nThese challenges also translate to some negative complexity results for extensive-form correlation 5 .\nWhile a landmark positive complexity result in game theory shows that one EFCE, EFCCE, or NFCCE can be found in polynomial time  6 7,\nthe computation of an optimal (that is, one that maximizes or minimizes a given linear objective, such as social welfare) EFCE, EFCCE, or NFCCE is computationally intractable in games with more than two players, as well as two-player games with chance moves, and tractable in two-player games without chance moves . In this paper we significantly refine this complexity threshold by showing that, in two-player games, an optimal correlated equilibrium can be computed in polynomial time, provided that a certain triangle-freeness condition—which can be checked in polynomial time—is satisfied. We prove that the condition holds, for example, when all chance moves are public, that is, both players observe all chance moves. This includes, for example, games where the chance outcomes amount to public dice rolls or public revelations of cards. Specifically, we show that the set of correlation plans ΞΞ\\Xi of a triangle-free game coincides with the von Stengel-Forges polytope 𝒱𝒱\\mathcal{V} of the game—a polytope that only requires a polynomial number of linear “probability-mass-conserving” constraints. Since 𝒱𝒱\\mathcal{V} can be represented using a polynomial number of constraints in the input game size, optimizing over this set can be efficiently done by means of, for example, linear programming methods. In Figure 1 we give an overview of the results in this paper and how\nthey relate to each other. Our main result is that the polytope of correlation plans ΞΞ\\Xi coincides with the von Stengel-Forges polytope 𝒱𝒱\\mathcal{V} when the game satisfies the triangle-freeness condition that we introduce (Definition 3). As we show in Theorem 1, every two-player game with public chance moves (which includes games with no chance moves at all) is triangle-free, but not all triangle-free games have public chance moves. So, our results also apply to some games where chance is not public.\nThe equality Ξ=𝒱Ξ𝒱\\Xi=\\mathcal{V} in triangle-free games implies that an optimal EFCE, EFCCE and NFCCE can be computed in polynomial time. This is because 𝒱𝒱\\mathcal{V} has a polynomial (in the game size) description  and the computation of an EFCE, EFCCE, NFCCE can be expressed as a linear program  3. We prove Ξ=𝒱Ξ𝒱\\Xi=\\mathcal{V} in several steps. First, we show that in triangle-free games, 𝒱𝒱\\mathcal{V} admits a structural decomposition in terms of scaled extension operations. This type of decomposition of 𝒱𝒱\\mathcal{V} was introduced by Farina et al. 2 as a way of “unrolling” the combinatorial structure of 𝒱𝒱\\mathcal{V} to construct an efficient regret minimization algorithm for ΞΞ\\Xi in two-player games without chance moves. We extend their construction to handle any triangle-free game. Then, we show a deep connection between the integrality of the vertices of the von Stengel-Forges polytope 𝒱𝒱\\mathcal{V} and ΞΞ\\Xi. Namely, in Theorem 3, we show that Ξ=𝒱Ξ𝒱\\Xi=\\mathcal{V} holds if and only if all of 𝒱𝒱\\mathcal{V}’s vertices have integer {0,1}01\\{0,1\\} coordinates. Finally, in Section 4 we prove that 𝒱𝒱\\mathcal{V} has integral vertices by leveraging its structural decomposition.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: are often used in extensive-form games: extensive-form correlated equilibrium (EFCE) , extensive-form coarse correlated equilibrium (EFCCE) 3, and normal-form coarse correlated equilibrium (NFCCE)   [ref]9.\nCompared to normal-form (that is, one-shot) games, extensive-form correlation poses new and different challenges, especially in settings where the agents retain private information.
