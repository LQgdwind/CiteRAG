      "content": "Paper Title: GREN: Graph-Regularized Embedding Network for Weakly-Supervised Disease Localization in X-ray Images\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning has been widely applied in X-ray images analysis, including disease classification [ref]30, [ref]25, ,  and detection [ref]16, , . However, locating diseases in chest X-ray images with few careful annotations remains a challenging problem. Wang et al. [ref]30 contributed a chest X-ray dataset and localized the disease with a multi-label disease classification model according to the heatmaps. Li et al. [ref]16 proposed to jointly model the disease identification and localization with multi-instance loss and binary cross-entropy loss. Tang et al. [ref]25 proposed an iterative attention-guided refinement framework to improve the classification and weakly-supervised localization performance via CAM . Sedai et al.  proposed a weakly supervised method based on class-aware multiscale convolutional feature to localize chest pathologies. Cai et al.  proposed an attention mining strategy to improve the sensitivity and saliency of model to disease patterns. All these methods overlooked the image-to-image and region-to-region relationship during modelling. For the last three years, some works have attempted to embed image relations into deep learning. Zhao et al.  modeled the contralateral context information using a spatial transformer network to enhance disease representations. Lian et al.  leveraged the constant structure and disease relations using a structure-aware relation extraction network. These methods utilized the region-to-region relationship in individual image and overlooked the image-to-image relationship in modelling. There are also some works using inter-image relationship for weakly-supervised medical image analysis. Liu et al.  utilized the contrast-induced attention acquired on paired images between healthy and unhealthy samples to provide more information for localization. Zhou et al.  exploited two contrastive abnormal attention models to improve the performance of thoracic multi-disease recognition. They designed a left-right lung contrastive network to learn intra-attentive abnormal features, and an inter-contrastive abnormal attention model to compare healthy samples with multiple unhealthy samples to compute the abnormal attention map. However, the uncertainty of the normal control may lead to the uncertainty of performance. Regularizing the models, as another strategy, involves no such sampling problem. Juan et al.  proposed a neural graph learning framework leveraging graph structures to regularize training, where the similarity between images is used as edges. Graph-Rise  used the distance graph between images for regularization. CCG  constructed graph nodes using clustered regions and lacked interpretability. The proposed GREN, in contrast, is free from additional manual annotation and the regions has explicit anatomical definitions.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: Deep learning has been widely applied in X-ray images analysis, including disease classification [ref]30, [ref]25, ,  and detection [ref]16, , .
