      "content": "Paper Title: Beyond Low-pass Filtering: Graph Convolutional Networks with Automatic Filtering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOver the past years, convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks have achieved great success on grid data such as images and sequences. Moving forward, the focus of researches gradually shifts from regular grid data to irregular non-Euclidean data [ref]1. Being an important kind of non-Euclidean data, graphs are ubiquitous in the real world, such as cyber networks and social networks. Graph data describes the relationship, association, or interaction among different entities. To extract latent representations from data, graph neural networks [ref]2 [ref]3 , in particular graph convolutional networks, are developed specifically for graphs. Graph neural networks not only have leveled up benchmarks on conventional graph-related tasks        , but also has been proven to be helpful in solving many deep learning problems where structural dependencies exist     . Among graph neural networks, the study of graph convolutional networks is built upon the foundation of graph signal processing. With eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian matrix, a graph convolutional filter can be defined as a function of frequency (eigenvalue). Through proper design of the filter function, a graph convolutional filter can be viewed from the spatial domain - it smooths a node’s inputs by aggregating information from the node’s neighborhood. Due to the advantage of efficiency, generality, and flexibility, there is a trend of designing graph convolutional networks directly on spatial domains without considering their spectral properties. As a result, these spatial-designed approaches may only focus on the low frequency band of graph signals . However, the middle and high frequency band of graph signals should not be ignored because they may contain useful information as well. To consider low, middle, high frequency band of graph signals at the same time, we need to return back to spectral-based approaches. As a spectral-designed graph convolutional filter is defined by a function of frequency, it can theoretically extract information on any frequency band. Pioneer works of spectral graph convolutional networks are computationally inefficient due to eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian matrix . Defferrard et al.  proposed ChebNet with the filter function defined as Chebyshev polynomials. With graph Fourier transform and inverse graph Fourier transform, the graph convolutional operation essentially is reduced to multiplying linear transformed graph inputs with non-linear transformed graph Laplacian matrix. In this way, eigendecomposition is not necessarily required. The graph kernel of ChebNet involves computing higher orders of the graph Laplacian matrix. Kipf et al.  further proposed GCN which is a first-order approximation of ChebNet with a renormalization trick. Despite that GCN improves over ChebNet in terms of efficiency, GCN is shown to be a low-pass filter .\nFollow-up works of GCN also remained the same problem   . Most recently, Balcilar et al.  proposed Depthwise Separable Graph Convolution Network (DSGCN) with arbitrary graph convolutional filter functions, while taking low, middle, and high frequency band of graph signals into consideration. However, filter functions of DSGCN are customized differently according to datasets without any rules to follow. It requires tremendous effort to find the optimal filter function manually for a new dataset. More importantly, the bandwidth of graph convolutional filters of DSGCN is fixed, which also applies to other existing spectral graph convolutions. Parameters of a graph convolutional filter only transform graph inputs without changing the curvature of a graph convolutional filter function. Therefore, the cut-off frequency or the bandwidth of a graph convolutional filter remains unchanged throughout learning. In reality, we are uncertain about whether we should retain or cut off the frequency at a certain point unless we have expert domain knowledge. In this paper, we aim to design a graph convolutional network that can capture the whole spectrum of graph signals in a more efficient and effective way. Our method consists of three graph convolutional filters, a low-pass, a middle-pass, and a high-pass filter. To avoid eigendecomposition, we limit the choice of filter functions within linear and quadratic forms of the graph Laplacian matrix. More specifically, the low-pass and high-pass filters are designed to be linear functions while the middle-pass filter has a quadratic form. The roles of low-pass, high-pass, and middle-pass filter are illustrated in Figure 2. Different from existing spectral-based methods, we introduce extra parameters to control the curvature and scope of all three filters. As a benefit, the bandwidth and magnitude of our graph convolutional filters can be adjusted automatically during training. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows, We propose an Automatic Graph Convolutional Network (AutoGCN) with three novel graph convolutional filters, a low-pass linear filter, a high-pass linear filter, and a middle-pass quadratic filter. While capturing the whole spectrum of graph signals, AutoGCN ends up with a spatial form without performing eigendecomposition. We enable the proposed graph convolutional filters to control their bandwidth and magnitude automatically by updating the curvature and scope of filter functions during training. We empirically show that all three graph filters contribute to model performance. Experimental results show that AutoGCN achieves significant improvement over baseline methods that only function as low-pass filters on medium-scale datasets for both node classification and graph prediction tasks. Our source codes are publicly available at https://github.com/nnzhan/AutoGCN. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we summarize current works of graph convolutional networks. In Section 3, we formally define our problems. In Section 4, we provide the background knowledge about spectral-rooted spatial graph convolution. In Section 5, we present our method named automatic graph convolution in detail. In Section 6, we report the experimental results of our method on both node classification and graph prediction tasks. Finally, in Section 7, we make a conclusion of our paper.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: neural networks have achieved great success on grid data such as images and sequences.
