      "content": "Paper Title: Length Scale Control in Topology Optimization using Fourier Enhanced Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLength-scale control , i.e., controlling feature thickness orthogonal to the local orientation, is often imposed in TO to make the design amenable to manufacturing and other functional requirements; see  for a review. Broadly, there are two types of length-scale control: exact and approximate. Exact length control implies that all features must lie precisely within the length scale specified. While this may be desirable during the final stages of design, it is difficult to implement, computationally demanding and often an overkill during early stages of design. The skeletal based minimum and maximum length scale control presented in  is an exact length-scale strategy; practical challenges in imposing exact length-scale control were reported in this work. Further, exact length scale can contradict imposed volume fraction constraint as explained later in Section 5.4. Researchers have therefore turned towards approximate length scale control (see discussion below) since this is often sufficient for conceptual designs, AM infills, micro-structural designs, etc. Several approximate length scale controls methods have been proposed. Filtering schemes to eliminate mesh dependency and indirectly control minimum length scale  is one the simplest approximate length-scale control method. In , a projection filter with tunable support was suggested to control the minimum length scale. However, these filters result in topologies with diffused boundaries. A scheme for imposing maximum length scale was developed in [ref]17. In this approach, the radius of a circular test region determines the maximum allowable member size. However, the large number of nonlinear constraints can pose challenges. Therefore, the constraints were aggregated using a p-norm form in  [ref]19, within the context of infill optimization. The authors of  recently introduced constraints for minimum and maximum member size, minimum cavity size, and minimum separation distance. Apart from requiring a large number of elements to obtain crisp boundaries, the computation and storage of these filters can also be expensive. While most of the filters discussed above directly apply on the design variables, the readers are referred to  for a discussion on filtering applied to sensitivities, and to  for imposing manufacturing constraints using filters in TO. Imposing approximate length scale control in the frequency domain has been suggested in  where a band pass filter was constructed to impose both maximum and minimum length scale controls. While this avoids additional constraints, the proposed method was restricted to rectangular domain, with non-rectangular domains requiring padding. Other techniques using morphology filters , geometric constraints  robust length scale control  have also been proposed. Physics-based length-scale strategies include an implicit strain energy approach , and a quadratic energy functional . The work described in this paper relies on a Fourier projection for length-scale control.  The concept of using Fourier basis functions is not new. It was first explored in  within a level-set formulation. It was later extended to density-methods in  via explicit band-pass filters that control both the minimum and maximum length scales. However, the authors noted that  \" … it is applicable to regular rectangular domains only. Irregular domains can be extended to rectangular ones by padding the design field with zeros, which can increase the computational cost associated with the filter.\" This was then generalized to non-rectangular domains in [ref]30, where the authors noted that \"…[Fourier projection] decouples the geometry description,\nand hence the decision variables, from the finite element\nmesh.\"  In this paper, we once again use Fourier projection for length-scale control. However, instead of directly using the Fourier coefficients as design variables, a neural network (NN) is used here to control these coefficients. A few advantages of this approach are: (1) the framework can be easily extended to, say, multiple-materials, without increasing the number of design variables, (2) one can extract high resolution topology, without increasing the computational cost, and (3) one can leverage the NN’s built-in optimizer and back-propagation capabilities for automated sensitivity computations.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: tunable support was suggested to control the minimum length scale.
