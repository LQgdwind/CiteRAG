      "content": "Paper Title: Blockchain-enabled Resource Management and Sharing for 6G Communications\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe IoT is a paradigm which envisions that all our daily objects and appliances will be connected to each other, collecting and sharing information.\nThis will allow the automation of certain tasks and enable several other applications to emerge, such as smart homes, smart transportation and wearable devices, smart farming, healthcare, machine-to-machine communications, etc. .\nIn order to reach such automation and growth, it is necessary to have proper standards and protocols for IoT devices.\nHowever, current solutions still rely on a centralized model, which incurs in a high maintenance cost for manufacturers, while consumers also lack trust in these devices.\nThat, combined with the resource constraints of IoT devices, privacy and security concerns, as well as poor interoperability among different vendors, makes IoT a challenging domain [ref]36 .\nSimilarly, D2D communications, a paradigm that envisions the communications and share of data between devices, also shares similar challenges to the IoT .\nFor example, mobile devices are constrained by battery, while security is an ever-present concern in mobile communications.\nMoreover, in order to fully enable D2D communications, a proper incentive for trading and sharing resources, such as power or data is needed, as current D2D paradigms lack motivation to do so . In this context, blockchain is an excellent compliment to both IoT and D2D communications, as it can provide the underlying infrastructure with improved interoperability, privacy, reliability and scalability .\nIn the context of resource management, for example, blockchains can be used to perform spectrum sharing and record all the spectrum utilization and lease requests .\nMoreover, it can provide the incentive needed for devices to share and trade resources, as current protocols lack the incentive to do so.\nBy integrating blockchain into IoT and D2D, it can provide rewards every time devices share their power or data, allowing for a more cooperative and trusted network environment  .\nMoreover, this reward mechanism can also be applied in the context of spectrum sharing, in which whenever a user leases spectrum to another, a reward can be assigned, creating a more collaborative environment and improving spectrum efficiency  .\nFurthermore, blockchains can be utilized in the realm of Vehicular-to-Anything (V2X) communications, by encouraging vehicles to trade energy or information with each other [ref]10.\nIn addition, another key aspect of V2X communications is how to guarantee a secure communication between vehicles and public key infrastructures (PKI).\nIn this context, blockchain can be utilized as the infrastructure to provide secure and private communications to the PKI, or also the communication between PKIs from different vendors . However, despite all of these benefits, the integration of blockchains in the IoT and D2D domain is still challenging  [ref]10 .\nIn the case of public chains, for example, the decentralized CMs often require extensive computing power from network nodes (such as PoW based blockchains).\nThis can be a problem, as most IoT devices are power constrained.\nThis is specially true for devices powered by cellular IoT, which can be deployed in very remote or difficult to access areas and are expected to have over ten years of battery life .\nThus, the utilization of blockchain in cellular IoT, especially when considering the computation of the consensus algorithm, can significantly reduce the life-time of cellular IoT devices, limiting their communication capabilities and effectiveness.\nAs such, it is still not clear how the generation of the PoW could be done when integrating public blockchains with IoT or D2D communications .\nHence, other CMs such as PBFT are being proposed in the context of IoT applications  .\nAnother challenge in integrating blockchain to small devices comes due to their limit memory capabilities.\nSince in blockchain every node needs to have a record of all the current and previous blocks in the chain, it can be infeasible to store such a huge amount of data in IoT devices.\nThus, it is still not clear how blockchain can be fully integrated in IoT.\nMoreover, blockchain still has privacy issues, as it has been shown by other studies that by analyzing transaction patterns, identities of users could be inferred . On top of that, it is also known that blockchain introduces delay, due to its decentralized approach and its CMs.\nAs such, this additional delay might also impact the performance of certain wireless communication use-cases, such as in V2X, industrial applications, or D2D and it is still an area to be investigated.\nMoreover, in V2X scenarios, information security and resilience are critical, since any small failure can lead to catastrophic and even fatal consequences.\nAs such, in those cases, blockchain can provide an additional secure layer in order for vehicles to perform key management exchange, as in , or even to protect a vehicle’s identity and location, in what is known as pseudonym management .\nLastly, another important challenge in this realm, which has not been largely explored is how the performance of the wireless link affects the performance of blockchain .\nDespite recent works investigating the suitability of the CSMA/CA protocol in wireless blockchain networks , or the security performance and optimal node deployment of blockchain-enabled IoT systems , more research needs to be done in this area.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: in these devices.\nThat, combined with the resource constraints of IoT devices, privacy and security concerns, as well as poor interoperability among different vendors, makes IoT a challenging domain [ref]36 .\nSimilarly, D2D communications, a paradigm that envisions the communications and share of data between devices, also shares similar challenges to the IoT .\nFor example, mobile devices are\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
