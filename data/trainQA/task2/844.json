      "content": "Paper Title: Towards the Quantification of Safety Risks in Deep Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHow to verify whether a given/particular neural network satisfies certain input-output properties is a very challenging task. Traditional verification of neural networks mainly focus on measuring the networks on a large collections of points in the input space and checking whether the outputs are as desired. However, due to the infinite of input space, it is not workable to check all possible inputs. Some networks may be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, although they can perform well on a large sample of inputs and not correctly extend to new situations.\nThe recent advances of neural network verification include\nthe layer-by-layer exhaustive search approach , methods using constraint solvers  , global optimisation approaches [ref]34   , the abstract interpretation approach  [ref]37 ,\nlinear programming (LP)  or mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) ,\nsemi-definite relaxations ,\nLipschitz optimization [ref]42 , and combining optimization with abstraction .\nThe properties studies include robustness  [ref]42, reachability (i.e., whether a given output is possible from a given subspace of inputs) , and properties expressible with SMT constraints  . Verification approaches aim to provide guarantees on the obtained results. However, they cannot provide efficient solutions to large-scale neural networks. For example, constraint-based approaches such as Reluplex\ncan only work with neural networks with a few hundreds hidden nodes   .\nExhaustive search and global optimisation suffer from the state-space or dimensionality explosion problem  .\nDifferent from these solutions, the quantification method proposed in this paper can work efficiently on large-scale neural networks against Lipschitzian properties.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: to new situations.\nThe recent advances of neural network verification include\nthe layer-by-layer exhaustive search approach , methods using constraint solvers  , global optimisation approaches [ref]34   , the abstract interpretation approach  [ref]37 ,\nlinear programming (LP)  or mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) ,\nsemi-definite relaxations ,\nLipschitz optimization [ref]42 , and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
