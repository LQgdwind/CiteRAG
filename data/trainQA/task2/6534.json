      "content": "Paper Title: Overconfidence is a Dangerous Thing: Mitigating Membership Inference Attacks by Enforcing Less Confident Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMachine learning (ML) models are often trained with the sensitive or private user data like clinical records , financial information  and personal photos .\nUnfortunately, ML models can also unwittingly leak private information [ref]37    .\nOne prominent example is Membership inference attacks (MIAs) [ref]37  8  7 7 [ref]3, which determine whether an input is used for training the target model,\nHence, MIAs constitute a fundamental threat to data privacy.\nFor instance, by knowing that an individual’s clinical record was used to train a hospital’s diagnostic model, the adversary can directly infer his/her health status. MIAs exploit the ML model’s differential behaviors on members and non-members [ref]37  8 7   [ref]3.\nMembers are the samples used to train the model (i.e., training samples) and non-members are the samples not used for training (e.g., testing samples).\nExisting MIAs can be divided into score-based [ref]37   8  [ref]3 and label-only attacks  7, where the former requires access to the model’s output score indicating the class probability, while the latter needs only the prediction label.\nThese attacks all seek to learn distinctive statistical features from the model’s predictions in different ways, such as training an attack inference model  [ref]37, computing metrics like prediction loss 8 and entropy [ref]37 , or using Gaussian likelihood estimate [ref]3. Defenses against MIAs can be categorized into provable and practical defenses.\nProvable defenses provide provable guarantees through differential privacy (DP) , but they often incur severe accuracy degradation.\nPractical defenses, instead, offer empirical membership privacy with the goal of maintaining high model accuracy 9 1  .\nHowever, existing defenses still suffer from the following limitations:\n(1) limited privacy protection  9;\n(2) large accuracy drop  9 1;\n(3) requiring additional public datasets that may not always be available in practice  .\nTo the best of our knowledge, no technique satisfies all these constraints, though they may address individual issues, e.g., high model accuracy but with limited privacy protection ; or strong privacy but with significant accuracy loss . Our Approach.\nThis paper proposes a practical defense called HAMP that can achieve both High Accuracy and Membership Privacy without requiring additional data.\nExisting MIAs employ diverse approaches in inferring membership, e.g., score-based MIAs may exploit prediction loss or entropy 8   while label-only MIAs  7 can leverage adversarial robustness.\nDespite the different manifestations of these attacks, we identify a common exploitation thread among them - they are all learning to distinguish whether the model is overly confident in predicting the training samples via different proxies.\nOur defense is therefore to reduce the model’s overconfident prediction on training samples while preserving the model’s prediction performance, which can simultaneously reduce membership leakage (from different MIAs) and maintain model accuracy. HAMP consists of a training- and testing-time defense. Training-time defense.\nOur key idea is to explicitly enforce the model to be less confident in predicting training samples during training.\nWe first identify that the prevailing use of hard labels in common training algorithms is one of the main factors that lead to the model’s excessive confidence in predicting training samples.\nHard labels assign 1 to the ground-truth label class and 0 elsewhere. The model is trained to produce outputs that match the labels, i.e., near 100% probability for the ground-truth class and 0% otherwise.\nOn the other hand, a non-member sample that is not seen during training, is usually predicted with lower confidence, and can hence be distinguished by the adversary from member samples. We therefore propose a new training framework that gets rid of hard labels and instead uses\n(1) High-entropy soft labels, which are soft labels with high entropy that assign a much lower probability to the ground-truth class and non-zero probability for other classes. This explicitly enforces the model to make less confident prediction on training samples.\n(2) HAMP also consists of an entropy-based regularizer, which is to penalize the model for predicting any high-confidence outputs via regularizing the prediction entropy during training. The proposed training framework is able to significantly reduce the model’s overconfident prediction and improve membership privacy, without (severely) degrading the model accuracy. Section III-B explains how it prevents privacy leakage from different sources (output scores and prediction labels). On the other hand, stronger membership privacy can also be achieved (e.g., by increasing the strength of regularization), but it would be at the cost of accuracy, which is undesirable as both privacy and accuracy are important considerations.\nThis motivates our testing-time defense, whose goal is to gain higher membership privacy without degrading accuracy. Testing-time defense.\nWe propose to uniformly modify all the outputs (from members and non-members) into low-confidence outputs, without changing the prediction labels.\nOur idea is to leverage the output scores from the randomly-generated samples, which are often predicted with low confidence due to the high dimensionality of the input space. In our defense, all the values in each output score are replaced by those from random samples, and we keep the relative ordering of different classes unchanged to maintain the same prediction labels (e.g., a dog image is still predicted as a dog but with different output scores).\nBoth the high-confidence outputs (on training samples) and low-confidence outputs (on testing samples) are uniformly replaced by such low-confidence outputs from random samples.\nThis further reduces the membership leakage from the output scores. Evaluation.\nWe evaluate HAMP on five benchmark datasets (Purchase100, Texas100, Location30, CIFAR100 and CIFAR10), and perform comprehensive evaluation on\na total of nine diverse MIAs (including the state-of-art LiRA attack [ref]3). We compare HAMP with seven leading defenses: AdvReg 9, MemGuard , SELENA 1, DMP , Label Smoothing (LS) 0, Early-stopping , and DP-SGD . An ideal privacy defense should offer strong protection for both members and non-members. Therefore, we follow Carlini et al. [ref]3 to use attack true positive rate (TPR) controlled at low false positive rate (FPR), and attack true negative rate (TNR) at low false negative rate (FNR) to evaluate membership privacy.\nThe former metric evaluates the privacy protection for members, and the latter for non-members. Contributions.  We summarize our contributions below. Develop a novel training framework with high-entropy soft labels and an entropy-based regularizer to enforce less confident prediction by the model, which can significantly mitigate diverse MIAs and incur minimal accuracy drop. Propose a novel testing time defense technique to modify all the output scores into low-confidence outputs, which further improves membership privacy without degrading accuracy. Integrate the training and testing framework as HAMP, and conduct rigorous evaluation under a wide range of attacks on five different datasets. We compare HAMP against seven leading defenses and show that HAMP outperforms existing defenses by achieving a superior privacy-utility trade off. Fig. 1 summarizes the results of HAMP versus other defenses.\nWe find that existing defenses often bias towards either privacy (e.g., DP-SGD) or utility (e.g., MemGuard).\nIn contrast, HAMP is able to provide strong membership privacy for both members and non-members, and preserve model accuracy.\nHAMP reduces the attack TPR @0.1% FPR by 94% and the attack TNR @0.1% FNR by 97% respectively, with only 0.46% accuracy loss on average. This represents a much better privacy-utility trade off than other defenses.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: are often trained with the sensitive or private user data like clinical records , financial information  and personal photos .\nUnfortunately, ML models can also unwittingly leak private information [ref]37    .\nOne prominent example is Membership inference attacks (MIAs) [ref]37  8  7 7 [ref]3, which determine whether an input is used for training the target model,\nHence, MIAs constitute a\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
