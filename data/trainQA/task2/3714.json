      "content": "Paper Title: On 𝑑-stable locally checkable problems parameterized by mim-width\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are many graph problems which can be expressed as vertex coloring problems or, equivalently, as vertex partition problems.\nBesides the well-known Chromatic Number and its variations, subset problems can be understood as a coloring problem with two colors, and path problems such as Hamiltonian cycle can be stated by asking for a vertex coloring with n𝑛n colors 1,…,n1…𝑛1,\\ldots,n (where n𝑛n is the number of vertices of some input graph) such that every vertex with color i𝑖i has to be adjacent to a vertex with color i−1𝑖1{i-1} and a vertex of color i+1𝑖1{i+1}.\nThis broad variety of coloring problems makes it tempting not to try to solve each of these problems on its own but to find efficient algorithms for many of them at once.\nThe probably best-known meta-theorem in graph theory is Courcelle’s theorem , which states that every graph problem expressible in Monadic Second-Order graph logic (MSO2) can be solved in linear time on graphs of bounded treewidth. Locally checkable problems are a broad subclass of coloring problems.\nA locally checkable problem is associated with a check function, which is a function that takes as input a vertex v𝑣v of a graph G𝐺G and a coloring of the closed neighborhood of v𝑣v and outputs a Boolean value.\nWe are looking for a coloring c𝑐c of the vertices of G𝐺G such that the check function outputs True for every vertex v𝑣v and the restriction of c𝑐c to N​[v]𝑁delimited-[]𝑣N[v].\nSuch a coloring will be called a proper coloring, since this is a generalization of the notion of proper colorings in the problem Chromatic Number.\nIndeed, determining the chromatic number can be seen as a locally checkable problem, where the check function simply verifies that the color of a vertex v𝑣v is unique in its closed neighborhood.\nAnother example for a locally checkable problem is the domination problem.\nHere, we are coloring the graph with two colors, S𝑆S and S¯¯𝑆\\overline{S}, and the check function verifies if the closed neighborhood of a vertex v𝑣v contains at least one vertex of color S𝑆S.\nThen, for any proper coloring, the vertices which have color S𝑆S form a dominating set.\nOnce a graph and a check function are given,\nwe could ask not only whether there exists a proper coloring but also\nfor an optimal proper coloring (for some notion of optimality). Most locally checkable problems are NP-complete on general graphs.\nFor a given family of graphs it is thus interesting to determine under which conditions on the check function and the color set we can efficiently solve the associated locally checkable problems on that family.\nIn [ref]20 Bonomo-Braberman and Gonzalez showed that, under mild conditions on the check function111Namely, the existence of polynomial partial neighborhood systems. We omit the definition due to its technicality, but interested readers are encouraged to refer to [ref]20., locally checkable problems can be solved in polynomial time in graphs of bounded treewidth222Some of these problems are in fact FPT parameterized by treewidth, while the others are simply XP..\nThis line of research has been continued in  in which\nBaghirova, Gonzalez, Ries and Schindl\nspecified a class of check functions called color-counting check functions.\nThese functions only depend on the vertex, the color it receives and, for each color a𝑎a, the number of neighbors of v𝑣v of color a𝑎a.\nIn other words, for a graph G𝐺G and a set of q𝑞q colors,\nthe check function can be written as a function c​h​e​c​k𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑐𝑘check which takes as input a vertex v𝑣v, a color and, for each color a𝑎a, a non-negative integer kasubscript𝑘𝑎k_{a}.\nIn order to determine if a coloring c𝑐c is proper, we verify if c​h​e​c​k​(v,c​(v),k1,…,kq)=True𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑐𝑘𝑣𝑐𝑣subscript𝑘1…subscript𝑘𝑞Truecheck(v,c(v),k_{1},\\ldots,k_{q})=\\textsc{True} for every v∈V​(G)𝑣𝑉𝐺v\\in V(G), where ka=|{w∈V​(G):c​(w)=a​ and w is a neighbor of v}|subscript𝑘𝑎conditional-set𝑤𝑉𝐺𝑐𝑤𝑎 and w is a neighbor of vk_{a}=\\left|\\left\\{w\\in V(G):c(w)=a\\text{ and $w$ is a neighbor of $v$}\\right\\}\\right|.\nIt is shown in  that the problems associated to a color-counting check function can be solved in polynomial time on graphs of bounded clique-width if the number of colors q𝑞q is a constant.\nIf we ease these restrictions on the check function and on q𝑞q, we obtain locally checkable problems which are NP-hard even on complete graphs (see [ref]20) and thus, in this case, we do not expect to find a polynomial-time algorithm. In this paper we turn our attention to graphs which are bounded in another width parameter, the maximum induced matching width (or mim-width for short), which was introduced by Vatshelle in  via the use of decomposition trees.\nA binary decomposition tree (T,δ)𝑇𝛿(T,\\delta) of G𝐺G consists of a rooted binary tree T𝑇T and a bijection δ𝛿\\delta between the leaves of T𝑇T and the vertices of G𝐺G (see [39, Definition 3.1.3]).\nFor any node v𝑣v of T𝑇T there is an associated partition of the vertices into two sets: the vertices corresponding to leaves which are descendants of v𝑣v, denoted Tvsubscript𝑇𝑣T_{v}, and all other vertices, denoted Tv¯subscript𝑇¯𝑣T_{\\overline{v}}.\nThe mim-width of a graph is the smallest number k𝑘k such that there is a binary decomposition tree (T,δ)𝑇𝛿(T,\\delta) of G𝐺G such that, for every node v𝑣v of T𝑇T, the maximum induced matching in the bipartite graph G​[Tv,Tv¯]𝐺subscript𝑇𝑣subscript𝑇¯𝑣G[T_{v},T_{\\overline{v}}] has size at most k𝑘k.\nA more detailed definition is given in Section 2. In a sense, mim-width is a broader width parameter than treewidth or clique-width.\nIndeed, any graph class of bounded clique-width has bounded mim-width, but there are graph classes of bounded mim-width whose clique-width is unbounded, such as interval graphs and permutation graphs ( ).\nWe observe that there are color-counting check functions with a bounded number of colors whose corresponding locally checkable problems are NP-hard on graphs of bounded mim-width (see Section 6).\nThus, we study which further restrictions we have to impose on a check function such that the associated locally checkable problems can be solved in polynomial time on graphs of bounded mim-width. Despite the broadness of families of bounded mim-width, there is still a surprising number of problems that can be solved in XP time when parameterized by mim-width.\nIn one of the first works to identify a large family of such problems (),\nBui-Xuan, Telle and Vatshelle focused on the following problems, defined by Telle in , which are related to a special type of color-counting check functions.\nGiven a positive integer q𝑞q, a degree constraint matrix D𝐷D is a q×q𝑞𝑞q\\times q-matrix whose entries are sets of non-negative integers.\nA locally checkable vertex partitioning (LCVP) problem is associated to a degree constraint matrix D𝐷D and consists in deciding whether there exists a partition {V1,V2,…,Vq}subscript𝑉1subscript𝑉2…subscript𝑉𝑞\\{V_{1},V_{2},\\dots,V_{q}\\} of V​(G)𝑉𝐺V(G) such that for every i,j∈[q]𝑖𝑗delimited-[]𝑞i,j\\in[q] and every v∈Vi𝑣subscript𝑉𝑖v\\in V_{i} it holds that |N​(v)∩Vj|∈D​[i,j]𝑁𝑣subscript𝑉𝑗𝐷𝑖𝑗|N(v)\\cap V_{j}|\\in D[i,j].\nIn  there is also a broad list of problems given which can be expressed as LCVP problems, amongst which are Dominating set and Independent set.\nIn , Jaffke, Kwon, Strømme and Telle showed that LCVP problems can be solved in polynomial time on graphs of bounded mim-width if q𝑞q is a constant and every entry of the associated degree constraint matrix is either finite or co-finite (that is, the complement of a finite set).\nObserve that all algorithms whose runtime is polynomial when the mim-width is bounded only work under the assumption that a suitable binary decomposition tree is given with the graph.\nWhile for some graph classes there are efficient algorithms to obtain such a decomposition (see, for example, ), it is not known whether it is possible to obtain a binary decomposition tree of some graph G𝐺G with the smallest possible mim-width in polynomial time.\nEven if we only ask for a binary decomposition tree of mim-width f​(m​i​m​w​(G))𝑓𝑚𝑖𝑚𝑤𝐺f(mimw(G)) for any function f𝑓f, we do not know if this is possible. Every LCVP problem can be considered as a locally checkable problem with a color-counting check function.\nIndeed, given a degree constraint matrix D𝐷D, we can associate the following color-counting check function to its corresponding LCVP problem: Observe that there are color-counting check functions which do not correspond to any LCVP problem.\nFor example, the k𝑘{k}-domination problem asks for a coloring of the vertices of the graph with the numbers from 0 to k𝑘k such that, for each vertex v𝑣v, the sum of the colors assigned to the vertices in the closed neighborhood of v𝑣v is at least k𝑘k, and where we want to minimize the sum of the colors of all the vertices in the graph.\nAnother example is the conflict-free q𝑞q-coloring, which asks for a coloring of the vertices with q𝑞q colors such that in the neighborhood of each vertex there is a color which appears exactly once. In order to generalize LCVP problems to include problems as the ones above, we introduce the notion of a d𝑑d-stable check function. Let {a1,…,aq}subscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑞\\left\\{a_{1},\\ldots,a_{q}\\right\\} be a set of colors and let c​h​e​c​k𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑐𝑘check be a color-counting check function.\nLet d𝑑d be a positive integer.\nWe say that c​h​e​c​k𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑐𝑘check is a d𝑑d-stable check function if\nfor every v∈V​(G)𝑣𝑉𝐺v\\in V(G) and any coloring c𝑐c of V​(G)𝑉𝐺V(G) we have where\nkj=|{w∈V​(G):c​(w)=aj​ and w is a neighbor of v}|subscript𝑘𝑗conditional-set𝑤𝑉𝐺𝑐𝑤subscript𝑎𝑗 and w is a neighbor of vk_{j}=\\left|\\left\\{w\\in V(G):c(w)=a_{j}\\text{ and $w$ is a neighbor of $v$}\\right\\}\\right|\nfor every j∈[q]𝑗delimited-[]𝑞j\\in[q]. In other words, if a check function is d𝑑d-stable that means that the “properness” of a coloring does not depend on the exact number of neighbors with a certain color as long as it is “large enough” (that is, larger than the threshold d𝑑d).\nFor example, for the domination problem, we only need to know if every vertex has zero or at least one neighbor in the dominating set.\nHowever, the exact number of neighbors in the set is not important if it is larger than one.\nThus, this problem has a 1-stable check function. Observe that in the result of  the condition that every entry of a degree constraint matrix D𝐷D is either finite or co-finite guarantees that its associated check function is d𝑑d-stable for some d𝑑d (the value of d𝑑d depends on the matrix D𝐷D, see ).\nThus, the notion of d𝑑d-stability generalizes the set of LCVP problems which can be efficiently solved by the methods in . We show that the d𝑑d-stability of a check function suffices to yield an algorithm which solves the associated locally checkable problems in polynomial time on graphs of bounded mim-width (given a suitable binary decomposition tree).\nWe also show that it is possible to solve optimization versions of these problems, by considering a function which assigns weights depending on the coloring of the graph.\nGiven a coloring c𝑐c of V​(G)𝑉𝐺V(G) with colors in {a1,…,aq}subscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑞\\left\\{a_{1},\\ldots,a_{q}\\right\\}, a local weight function assigns weights to vertices depending on the vertex and the coloring of its closed neighborhood.\nThen the weight of the coloring c𝑐c is defined as the sum of the weights of all the vertices.\nWe consider local weight functions which have properties analogous to the ones previously defined for the check functions.\nA color-counting weight function is a local weight function where the assigned weights depend on the vertex v𝑣v, the color it receives and, for each color a𝑎a, the number of neighbors of v𝑣v which have color a𝑎a.\nFor a positive integer d𝑑d, we say that a color-counting weight function w is d𝑑d-stable if for every v∈V​(G)𝑣𝑉𝐺v\\in V(G) and every coloring c𝑐c we have w​(v,c​(v),k1,…,kq)=w​(v,c​(v),min⁡(d,k1),…,min⁡(d,kq)),w𝑣𝑐𝑣subscript𝑘1…subscript𝑘𝑞w𝑣𝑐𝑣𝑑subscript𝑘1…𝑑subscript𝑘𝑞\\textsc{w}(v,c(v),k_{1},\\ldots,k_{q})=\\textsc{w}(v,c(v),\\min(d,k_{1}),\\ldots,\\min(d,k_{q})),\nwhere kj=|N​(v)∩c−1​(aj)|subscript𝑘𝑗𝑁𝑣superscript𝑐1subscript𝑎𝑗k_{j}=|N(v)\\cap c^{-1}(a_{j})| for every j∈[q]𝑗delimited-[]𝑞j\\in[q].\nA locally checkable problem with both a d𝑑d-stable check function and a d𝑑d-stable weight function will be called a d𝑑d-stable locally checkable problem.\nWe adapt the algorithm given in  to show that finding an optimal proper coloring for such a problem is possible in polynomial time in graphs of bounded mim-width.\nWe also give the option to add global constraints on the sizes of the color classes and also connectivity constraints (among which we distinguish between positive and negative constraints, depending on whether they ask for a set of vertices to be connected or disconnected), for which we follow the ideas of Bergougnoux and Kanté in [ref]15. Let d𝑑d and q𝑞q be positive integers.\nFor a d𝑑d-stable locally checkable problem with q𝑞q colors, size constraints 𝒦𝒦\\mathcal{K}, positive connectivity constraints 𝒞+superscript𝒞\\mathcal{C}^{+} and negative connectivity constraints 𝒞−superscript𝒞\\mathcal{C}^{-}, there exists an algorithm that solves the problem on graphs with a given binary decomposition tree in time\nnO​(w​d​q​(|𝒞+|+1)​2|𝒞−|)superscript𝑛𝑂𝑤𝑑𝑞superscript𝒞1superscript2superscript𝒞n^{O(wdq(|\\mathcal{C}^{+}|+1)2^{|\\mathcal{C}^{-}|})},\nwhere n𝑛n is the number of vertices of the input graph and w𝑤w is the mim-width of the associated decomposition. We would like to analyze the relation of these d𝑑d-stable functions with another subset of graph problems.\nThe distance neighborhood (DN) logic was introduced by Bergougnoux, Dreier and Jaffke in [ref]14 as an extension of existential MSO1, that is, MSO1 without universal quantifiers and without negation of terms containing existential quantifiers.\nDN logic introduces further the use of neighborhood terms, whose basic element is the following neighborhood operator:\nfor a set S𝑆S of vertices of a graph, Ndr​(S)superscriptsubscript𝑁𝑑𝑟𝑆N_{d}^{r}(S) denotes the set of every vertex v𝑣v for which there are at least d𝑑d vertices in S𝑆S whose distance to v𝑣v is at most r𝑟r and at least 1.\nThis logic allows us to combine these terms using the usual set operators as well as constant sets of vertices.\nWe can also use them in logical expressions by comparing sizes of these sets, asking for equality or if they are contained in each other.\nA precise definition is given in [ref]14.\nThe A&C DN logic is an extension of DN logic with the terms con(t) and acy​(t)acy𝑡\\text{acy}(t), which state that the subgraph induced by the neighborhood term t𝑡t is connected or acyclic, respectively.\nIn Section 4 we explore the modeling power of the frameworks.\nFor any A&C DN expression\nthere is an equivalent\nformulation using d𝑑d-stable locally checkable problems with size, connectivity and acyclicity constraints.\nConversely, we can model any d𝑑d-stable locally checkable problem with such global constraints in A&C DN logic.\nIt was also shown in [ref]14 that any A&C DN formula can be solved in polynomial time on graphs of bounded mim-width, yielding another polynomial time algorithm solving d𝑑d-stable locally checkable problems on graphs of bounded mim-width, besides Theorem 1.2.\nSince the two models look quite different, it may seem surprising that they can solve the same set of problems.\nHowever, this astonishment is dampened given the fact that they are both generalizations of the proof idea in . The additional translation step comes at the expense of a worse runtime.\nFor a d𝑑d-stable coloring problem on q𝑞q colors without connectivity or acyclicity constraints and an n𝑛n-vertex graph G𝐺G whose mim-width is w𝑤w, the algorithm in Section 5 has a runtime of nO​(d​w​q)superscript𝑛𝑂𝑑𝑤𝑞n^{O(dwq)}.\nUsing the proof in Section 4.2 and [14, Theorem 1.2] gives an algorithm of complexity nO​(w​q2​d2​(d+1)2​q)superscript𝑛𝑂𝑤superscript𝑞2superscript𝑑2superscript𝑑12𝑞n^{O(wq^{2}d^{2}(d+1)^{2q})}.\nClearly, the first algorithm has a better exponent.\nIn some cases, it is possible to find shorter DN-expressions for a locally checkable problem than the ones we obtain from Section 4.2.\nFor example, in [14, Section 6.3],\nthere is\na DN-formula expressing the conflict-free q𝑞q-coloring problem which has length O​(q2)𝑂superscript𝑞2O(q^{2}).\nThis is shorter than O​(q2​22​q+1)𝑂superscript𝑞2superscript22𝑞1O(q^{2}2^{2q+1}), the length we obtain from Section 4.2, but this still yields an algorithm of runtime nO​(d​w​q2)superscript𝑛𝑂𝑑𝑤superscript𝑞2n^{O(dwq^{2})} and thus a slower one than Section 5. Finally, it is certainly of interest to determine if the restrictions we put on the check and weight function as well as on the number of colors could be eased.\nIn Section 6 we show that this is not possible in general.\nIn particular, we show that there are locally checkable problems with non d𝑑d-stable color-counting check functions which are NP-hard even on interval graphs.\nThus, we cannot expect to remove the condition of d𝑑d-stability.\nWe also give locally checkable problems with d𝑑d-stable check function for which the associated optimization problem is NP-hard for certain non d𝑑d-stable color-counting weight functions. Our paper is structured as follows.\nWe begin by explaining basic notions and definitions in Section 2.\nThe definition and notation of d𝑑d-stable locally checkable problems is given in Section 3.\nIn Section 4 we analyze the relation between DN logic and d𝑑d-stable locally checkable problems.\nWe then give a proof for our main result, Lemma 5.2, in Section 5.\nSection 6 is dedicated to showing that the restrictions we give on the number of colors and on the check and weight functions are in some sense tight.\nFinally, Section 7 provides examples of problems which are associated to a d𝑑d-stable check function and which have not been solved before on graphs of bounded mim-width.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: of graphs it is thus interesting to determine under which conditions on the check function and the color set we can efficiently solve the associated locally checkable problems on that family.\nIn [ref]20 Bonomo-Braberman and Gonzalez showed that, under mild conditions on the check function111Namely, the existence of polynomial partial neighborhood systems.
