      "content": "Paper Title: Attention-based Multi-Reference Learning for Image Super-Resolution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nQualitative and quantitative comparisons are performed with state-of-the-art SISR and RefSR approaches. The SISR methods are the PSNR-oriented EDSR¬†9, MDSR¬†9, RRDBNet¬†, SRResNet¬†, RCAN¬†[ref]43, NHR¬†8, NLR¬†8, CSNLN¬†, MAFFSRN¬† and the visual-oriented SRGAN¬†, ESRGAN¬†, RSRGAN¬†. The RefSR approaches are CrossNet¬†, SSEN¬†, SRNTT¬†, TTSR¬† and MASA¬† (published June ‚Äô21).\nWe train each network with the datasets presented in Section¬†4 with the same training configurations. Training with adversarial loss usually deteriorates the quantitative results. For a fair comparison with the PSNR-oriented methods, we train our model, SRNTT, MASA and TTSR only on reconstruction loss (named with the suffix ‚Äúl2subscriptùëô2l_{2}‚Äù).\nNHR and NLR are tested on HUMAP and GEMAP since they require normal maps (retrieved with Blender¬†).\n\nQuantitative comparison: the PSNR and SSIM values of each method are presented in Table¬†1, which is divided into two parts: PSNR-oriented networks in the upper part; visual-oriented GANs and RefSR in the lower part. The highest scores are highlighted in red while the second highest scores are blue. The bold red figures are the highest across both PSNR- and visual-oriented methods. AMRSR-l2subscriptùëô2l_{2} achieves the highest values of PSNR and SSIM in the PSNR- and visual-oriented methods for all four datasets.\n\nQualitative comparison: \nFigure¬†4 shows SR examples of the most relevant approaches considered in our evaluation. The SR outputs produced by the PSNR-oriented methods (RCAN, CSNLN) are blurrier and the details are less sharp. The results produced by the visual-oriented approaches (RSRGAN, SRNTT, TTSR) present unpleasant artefacts such as ringing and unnatural discontinuities.\nThe SR outputs of AMRSR are less blurry with sharper and finer details as shown in the zoomed patches of the examples, whose quality is higher than the other results.\n\nUser study evaluation: \nto further evaluate the visual quality of the SR outputs, we conduct a user study, where AMRSR is compared with five approaches.\n50 random SR output pairs were shown to 60 subjects. Each pair consists of an image of AMRSR and the counterpart generated by one of the other approaches. The users were asked to pick the image with the best visual quality. The values on the Y-axis of Figure¬†5 illustrate the percentage of the users that select AMRSR outputs. AMRSR significantly outperforms the other methods with over 90% of users voting for it. Influence of dissimilar references: similarity between LR and reference images significantly influences the performances of RefSR methods¬†. Following the setting in¬†, we evaluate the effect of dissimilar reference images to the LR input testing on four similarity levels (from L1 to L4) of the CUFED5 test set, defined by computing the number of best matches of SIFT features between the input image and the references. The references that belong to L1 have the highest number of matches while the L4 ones have the lowest number. The highest figures of PSNR and SSIM (Table¬†2) are obtained by our network when a single reference is used even though its level of similarity has decreased, confirming the higher efficiency of AMRSR when the references are not similar to the LR input. To show the efficiency of leveraging multiple references, we evaluate the RefSR approaches on the CU4REF dataset by swapping the references of an image with other images in the dataset. The quantitative results of Table¬†6 and the visual comparison in Figure¬†3 demonstrate the benefits of using multiple dissimilar references. AMRSR is able to find more similar patches within multiple references even if these are very dissimilar to the LR input. For dissimilar references, AMRSR achieves higher PSNR and SSIM than other methods and than when a single reference is used (AMRSR 1). This study demonstrates the performance of adaptive sampling of AMRSR even for references with dissimilar features.\n\nComparison with CIMR¬†:  we compare AMRSR with CIMR¬†, the only other multi-reference super-resolution approach. AMRSR is trained following the setting in¬† on CUFED5 dataset (13,761 images). We randomly associated NMsubscriptùëÅùëÄN_{M} references taken from Outdoor Scene (OST) dataset¬† to each LR input image.\nCIMR is evaluated on content-independent references using a reference pool to select a subset of feature vectors from 300 reference images. We evaluate AMRSR by randomly associating to the LR input images NMsubscriptùëÅùëÄN_{M} reference images from the 300 images.\nResults presented in Table¬†4 show that AMRSR outperforms CIMR in the multiple references case.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: Qualitative and quantitative comparisons are performed with state-of-the-art SISR and RefSR approaches.
