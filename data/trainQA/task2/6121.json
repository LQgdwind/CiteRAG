      "content": "Paper Title: V2X-Seq: A Large-Scale Sequential Dataset for Vehicle-Infrastructure Cooperative Perception and Forecasting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPublic datasets have greatly facilitated the development of autonomous driving. Kitti  is the pioneering dataset for autonomous driving. nuScenes , Waymo Open  , ApolloScape , and ONCE  are large-scale and real-world datasets that support 3D object detection, tracking and prediction tasks. Argoverse , Argoverse 2.0 4, Lyft , and nuPlan  release large-scale trajectories generated from the raw sensor data to support motion prediction and planning tasks. These datasets are all captured with single-vehicle sensors.\nRepo3D 7, WIBAM [ref]14, and A9-Dataset  release the infrastructure-only 3D detection dataset. HighD  and NGSIM  release the drone or infrastructure-only trajectories dataset. OpenV2V 5, V2X-Sim 2.0 [ref]21, and Cooper(inf) [ref]1 release small-scale sequential and simulated datasets for multi-vehicle cooperative perception.\nDAIR-V2X-C 8 is the first real-world V2X dataset that supports VIC3D object detection; however, it does not provide the trajectory information. Compared with these existing public autonomous driving datasets, our V2X-Seq is the first large-scale sequential V2X dataset. All data are captured and generated from the real world. The dataset also includes vector maps and real-time traffic light signal data. It will be suitable for studying the Vehicle-Infrastructure Cooperative sequential perception and trajectory forecasting tasks. Utilizing data from the road environment to enhance the safety of autonomous driving has attracted significant research attention in recent years. Some research works have focused on multi-vehicle cooperative perception, where lightweight feature-level data is transmitted and shared for improved perception of other vehicles 2  . To address communication delays in multi-vehicle 3D object detection,  proposes a time-compensation module for latency. On the other hand, some works have explored the use of infrastructure data to improve autonomous driving. For instance, 8 formalizes the vehicle-infrastructure cooperative 3D object detection task and highlights the latency challenges in cooperative perception. 9 further proposed to use feature flow prediction to overcome the uncertain latency. Other works such as   [ref]1 [ref]14 also consider transmitting feature-level data from infrastructure to the vehicle side. To empower only sharing sparse yet perceptually critical information,  utilizes a spatial confidence map. Moreover, [ref]21 applies the Transformer 1 to fuse the features. Works such as   0 integrate the infrastructure data for control in autonomous driving.\nHowever, most current works on cooperative autonomous driving focus on perceptual completion, overlooking the importance of temporal perception and forecasting. In this paper, we contribute to this field by releasing the V2X-Seq dataset, which is suitable for exploring sequential perception and forecasting tasks in vehicle-infrastructure cooperative settings.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: release large-scale trajectories generated from the raw sensor data to support motion prediction and planning tasks.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
