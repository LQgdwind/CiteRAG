      "content": "Paper Title: Memory-Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Image-Goal Navigation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe consider several methods in this comparison: an adaptation of SPTM [ref]9 to Habitat, as well as four approaches taken from [ref]7. ResNet + GRU + IL [ref]7: A simple baseline consisting of ResNet18 image encoder and a GRU-based policy trained with imitation learning. Target-Driven RL : A vanilla baseline trained with reinforcement learning, similar to our ablated variant. Active Neural SLAM [ref]34: An exploration model based on metric maps, adapted to navigation. Neural Topological SLAM (NTS) [ref]7: The previous state-of-the-art method for navigation in unseen environments, based on neural SLAM and endowed with a topological graph for long-term planning.\nWe compare against two versions of this method: NTS, that uses as input the RGB observation and the pose sensor, and NTS-D that uses the depth map in addition to the two other modalities. SPTM [ref]9: A navigation model based on explicit construction of a graph over past experience.\nThe method requires an exploration episode given a priori.\nTo run this baseline, we adapt the available code333https://github.com/nsavinov/SPTM to Habitat.\nWe train the reachability and locomotion networks on trajectories from the training set.\nFor evaluation we used a random exploration trajectory of 10k steps, and build a graph with 100k top-scoring edges.\nAs this method does not implement a STOP action, we give it advantage and automatically end the episode when the agent gets within 1m of the goal. The first four methods are designed for episodic navigation, i.e. the validation episodes are performed on completely unseen scenes, without pre-exploration.\nConversely, SPTM is intended for setups where a pre-exploration phase is allowed on the test scenes before starting the actual navigation phase, and therefore uses more privileged information. We trained our model on the easy, medium, hard combined dataset for 500M steps for three random seeds, and evaluated it on the corresponding test set.\nAs shown in Table I, the performance obtained with our memory-augmented model is superior to that of previous work by a significant margin: +13%percent13+13\\% SPL on average compared to NTS-D and +29%percent29+29\\% SPL vs. SPTM.\nWe obtain this strong performance while, unlike NTS-D, not using position nor depth information.\nWe note that the success rate on easy episodes is lower for our method than NTS-D (−9%percent9-9\\%).\nThis is potentially due to the lack of position and depth features or the use of discretized panoramic observations, both of which are particularly useful for nearby goals.\nNote that the four methods from [ref]7 require 25M steps of training until convergence in comparison to our 500M steps.\nThis difference in training horizon is due to several factors, including the absence of position information in the observations for our setup, and the absence of an explicit planner in our method.\nRather than comparing all the methods at a fixed-step budget, when they may not be trained optimally, we made the fair choice to compare all the methods after the convergence of their respective optimization processes.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: We consider several methods in this comparison: an adaptation of SPTM [ref]9 to Habitat, as well as four approaches taken from [ref]7.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
