      "content": "Paper Title: Jointly Learning Span Extraction and Sequence Labeling for Information Extraction from Business Documents\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInformation extraction (IE) is an important task of natural language processing (NLP), in which IE models extract information from a given document  [ref]2  [ref]4 . The extraction task can be done by using machine learning  [ref]2 [ref]6 , in which IE models are trained by using hand-crafted features  or hidden features automatically learned from data [ref]2 . Recently, pre-trained language models (PreLMs), e.g. BERT  or LayoutLM  have been adapted to IE of business documents with promising results [ref]6 [ref]4. In practice, extracted information can be used for the digital transformation 0  of companies who want to digitally manage their data for efficient office operation [ref]6. We focus on information extraction from business documents, which can help companies to reduce the cost of data management and transformation [ref]6 1. Compared to traditional data types, e.g. news (CoNLL 2003 2), business documents are quite long (Table I), complicated, and specific in writing styles. For example, a bidding document is usually long, i.e. 30-50 pages, including a lot of information for bidding. Figure 1 shows five claims in a bidding article, important information which needs to be extracted is highlighted by yellow. For instance, given two queries: ‚Äò‚Äòthe bid subject\" and ‚Äò‚Äòthe procurement period\", IE models have to extract relevant spans. The span of ‚Äò‚Äòthe bid subject\" is in the second clause and the spans of ‚Äò‚Äòthe procurement period\" (procurement start and dates) are in the in the fourth clause. There are two main methods for IE: span extraction formulated as machine reading comprehension  [ref]4  and sequence labeling, also called named entity recognition (NER) [ref]2 4. The two methods have achieved promising results for extracting information 5 6  [ref]6 , yet long business documents with very sparse information challenge the normal IE techniques. On the one hand, the span extraction approach is good at dealing with long documents with sparse information  [ref]6 because it directly extracts answer spans based on their start and end positions. However, it could not completely handle the problem of multiple span extraction, which is popular in actual business cases 4 [ref]4. For example, the bidding dataset in Table I has 27.25% of multiple answer samples. In addition, the speed of normal span extraction methods (e.g. BERT-QA) creates an obstacle in practical cases because it sequentially encodes each question-context pair. With many questions (tags) and long context documents (Table I), the training and inference time is unpractical (mùëöm times to encode mùëöm query-document pairs). On the other hand, sequence labeling can handle multiple span extraction 5 6; however, its quality tends to be reduced due to sparse information. We observed that the percentage of answer tokens in business documents is tiny (i.e. 0.62% of bidding). Hence, training a high-quality sequence labeling model for such data is a non-trivial task [ref]2 4. This paper introduces a new IE model, which takes the advantage of the span-based extraction and sequence labeling (NER) methods for business documents. The combination allows the model to extract multiple spans from long business documents with sparse information. To speed up the training process, we design a new simple but effective method for encoding input queries (short fields, e.g. bidding date) and long context documents. Instead of putting each field-document (context) pair into the encoder, the model considers the document and input fields independently. This allows the model to encode short fields and the context in parallel by using multiple general attention. The model is trained end-to-end to jointly optimize the two tasks. Final outputs are created by using an aggregation algorithm based on span prediction and sequence labeling. This paper makes two main contributions: It introduces a practical IE model, which combines span extraction and sequence labeling in a unified model. The speed of the training and inference process is also significantly improved by using two-channel information encoding. The model achieves high accuracy of information extraction from business documents with limited data, which is applicable for business use. It validates the model on four business datasets in English and Japanese. The analyses also show the behavior of the model in several aspects: F-scores, training and inference time, convergence, and the coverage of multiple spans.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Information extraction (IE) is an important task of natural language processing (NLP), in which IE models extract information from a given document  [ref]2  [ref]4 .
