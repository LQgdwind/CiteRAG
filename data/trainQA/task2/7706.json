Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Comprehensive Tutorial on over 100 Years of Diagrammatic Representations of Logical Statements and Relational Queries\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAudience and prerequisite.\nThis 180 min tutorial targets\nresearchers and practitioners\nwho desire an intuitive, yet comprehensive survey\nof diagrammatic representations of logical statements and relational queries.\nOur focus is on the commonalities and differences between\nmajor design ideas.\nThe tutorial is best followed by being familiar with Relational Algebra (RA), Relational Calculus (RC) and the safety conditions to make them equivalent in expressiveness.\nHowever, the tutorial is self-contained and includes\na short-paced summary of the characteristics of 5 relational query languages. Scope of this tutorial.\nThis tutorial surveys visual formalisms for representing relational queries.\nThe focus is on relationally complete formalisms whose expressiveness is equivalent to Relational Algebra (RA), Relational Calculus (RC), and non-recursive Datalog with stratified negation.\nIn order to guide the discussion, the tutorial discusses mapping the visual alphabets of visual formalisms\nto expressions of RA and RC. It thus starts with a quick fast-paced overview of RA and RC and their connections to first-order logic. Out-of-scope.\nThe tutorial does not cover domain-specific visualizations, such as those for geographic information systems, time-series, and\nspatio-temporal\ndata   [ref]39.\nNeither does it cover\ndynamic\ninteraction with queries or data . Related other tutorials.\nA tutorial at SIGMOD’19  (“Towards Democratizing Relational Data Visualizations”) focused on ways to visualize data and languages that allow users to specify what visualizations they want to apply to data.\nThe focus of this tutorial is instead of visual representations of queries.\nTwo tutorials at SIGMOD’17  (“Graph Querying Meets HCI”) and SIGMOD’22  (“Data-driven Visual Query Interfaces for Graphs”) focused on visual composition of graph queries.\nThe types of queries discussed in those tutorials basically correspond to conjunctive queries with inequalities over binary predicates, whereas our focus is on full first-order logic.\nAlso, the focus was on the human-interaction aspect of how to compose queries, while our focus is on the visual formalisms developed for relational queries over the last century (thus even predating the relational model). Contrast to prior offerings of this tutorial.\nA 90-min tutorial on the topic\nwas presented at the “International Conference on the Theory and Application of Diagrams 2022” (DIAGRAMS-22) ,\nthe main international venue covering all aspects of research on the theory and application of diagrams.\nThis conference attracts an audience with close to no intersection with the audience at database conferences.\nThe emphasis of that tutorial was on the logical foundations of relational databases,\nthe resulting different focus from the diagrammatic reasoning community,\nand the problems arising from visualizing logical disjunctions as diagrams.\nA 90-min version of the proposed tutorial\nwas presented at VLDB 2023 [ref]25.\nThe emphasis of that tutorial was on the principles guiding effective Query Visualization,\nand an overview of representations suggested by the database community.\nThe tutorial is available as a 300-page slide deck on the tutorial web page [ref]25. The key novel parts of this 3-h tutorial will be as follows:\n 1 Part 4 includes a comprehensive survey of early diagrammatic approaches for representing logical statements\nthat largely predate attempts in the database community and are seemingly disconnected to them.\nWe will cover\nEuler circles ,\nVenn diagrams ,\nVenn-Peirce diagrams ,\nconstraint diagrams  ,\nPeirce’s beta existential graphs, and\nSowa’s conceptual graphs .\nWe also discuss\nformalisms embodied by Higraphs \nand UML notation .\n 2 Part 5 compares past approaches in the database community. It was previously (at VLDB 2023) only covered partially due to the limited time.\nThis tutorial includes an additional query\nfocusing on diagrammatic representations for disjunctions and unions,\nwhich are known to be the greatest challenge for diagrammatic representations (see e.g., discussion by Shin ).\nWe will also cover two additional very recent diagrammatic formalisms.\nFurthermore, the historical comparisons (parts 4 and 5 together) will culminate in a new “lessons learned” synthesis (part 6).\n 3 The new material grows the expected number of slides to over 400 pages.\nSlides (and possibly videos) of the tutorial will be made available afterward on the tutorial web page,\nsimilar to other recent tutorials by the presenter and collaborators on unrelated topics [ref]60 .\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: connections to first-order logic. Out-of-scope.\nThe tutorial does not cover domain-specific visualizations, such as those for geographic information systems, time-series, and\nspatio-temporal\ndata   [ref]39.\nNeither does it cover\ndynamic\ninteraction with queries or data . Related other tutorials.\nA tutorial at SIGMOD’19  (“Towards Democratizing Relational Data Visualizations”) focused on ways to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
