      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Deep Multi-Shape Matching\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe matching of 3D shapes is a long-standing problem in computer vision and computer graphics.\nDue to its wide range of applications, numerous approaches that address diverse variants of shape matching problems have been proposed over the past decades [ref]46 .\nIn recent years, with the success of deep learning, many learning-based methods were introduced for shape matching. One common way to address shape matching is to formulate it as classification\nproblem     3 . The advantage of such methods is that after training the classifier, shape correspondences can efficiently and directly be predicted. A major downside is that for training such a classifier typically a large amount of data that is annotated with ground truth correspondences is required.\nHowever, specifically in the domain of 3D shapes, annotated data is scarce, since data annotation is particularly time-consuming and tedious.\nThus, in practice, the above methods are often trained with small datasets, so that in turn they are prone to overfitting and lack the ability to generalise across datasets. Another line of learning-based shape matching solutions build upon the functional map framework     [ref]41. Functional maps can serve as a powerful regularisation, so that respective methods were even trained successfully in an unsupervised manner, i.e. without the availability of ground truth correspondences  [ref]41 .\nHowever, a downside of such approaches is that the conversion of the obtained functional map to a point-wise correspondence map is typically non-trivial. On the one hand, this may limit the matching accuracy, while on the other hand this may have a negative impact on inference speed (see Sec. 5.1). \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     \n\nFMNet \n\n     \n\nSURFMNet \n\n     \n\nGeomFmaps \n\n     \n\nWSupFMNet [ref]41\n\n     \n\nDPFM \n\n     \n\nDeep Shells \n\n     \n\n3D-CODED \n\n     \n\nACSCNN 3\n\n     \n\nOurs\n\n\nUnsup.\n✗\n✓\n✗\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✗\n✓\n\nCycle-cons.\n✗\n✗\n✗\n✗\n✗\n✗\n✓\n✓\n✓\n\nNo template\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✗\n✗\n✓\n\nPartiality\n✗\n✗\n✗\n✓\n✓\n✗\n✗\n✗\n✓\n\n\n\nOur multi-matching representation\nPartial multi-matching\nComparison of methods\n\n In this work we aim to alleviate the shortcomings of both paradigms, while combining their advantages.\nTo this end,\nwe present a novel unsupervised learning approach for obtaining cycle-consistent multi-shape matchings, see Fig. 1.\nOur approach predicts shape-to-universe matchings based on a universe classifier, so that cycle-consistency of so-obtained pairwise matchings is guaranteed by construction.\nUnlike previous classification methods that rely on supervision based on ground truth correspondences, the training of our universe classifier purely relies on functional map regularisation, thereby allowing for a fully unsupervised training. Yet, at inference time, our method does not require to compute functional maps, and directly predicts shape-to-universe matchings via our classifier.\nWe summarise our main contributions as follows: For the first time we enable the unsupervised training of a classification-based neural network for cycle-consistent 3D multi-shape matching. To this end, our method uses functional maps as strong regularisation during training but does not require the computation of functional maps during inference. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on several challenging 3D shape matching benchmark datasets, even in comparison to most recent supervised methods.\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: in computer vision and computer graphics.\nDue to its wide range of applications, numerous approaches that address diverse variants of shape matching problems have been proposed over the past decades [ref]46 .\nIn recent years, with the success of deep learning, many learning-based methods were introduced for shape matching.
