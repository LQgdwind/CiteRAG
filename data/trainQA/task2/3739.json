      "content": "Paper Title: BatchFormerV2: Exploring Sample Relationships for Dense Representation Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMini-Batch stochastic gradient descent optimization is one of core paradigm of training deep neural networks  [ref]23 . In order to accelerate the network training, Ioffe & Szegedy [ref]20 present Batch Normalization to reduce internal covariate shift via normalizing intermediate representations. Batch Normalization has inspired a large number of cross-batch techniques  , and has become one of cornerstones for modern deep networks. Recently, Hou et al.  introduce a BatchFormer module in the penultimate layer with a shared classifier for data scarcity tasks. Inspired by them, BatchFormerV2 proposed in this paper is pluggable into different layers in Visual Transformer and DETR, which first enables applying batch Transformer module for dense prediction tasks. Here, we compare the proposed BatchFormerV2 with other cross-batch techniques. First, Batch Normalization actually enables the sample information propagation in a linear way, and stables the network training. Differently, we think the proposed BatchFormerV2 propagates information among samples in the mini-batch in a non-linear way via multi-head self-attention. Meanwhile, transductive inference   is also popular in few-shot approaches and recent approaches   introduce to reason the relationships between samples, while those techniques require batch inference and thus related applications are limited. In addition, Mixup [ref]48 is a popular augmentation technique, which draws virtual samples from the vicinity distribution of the training examples. Similar to Mixup [ref]48, our BatchFormerV2 also changes the feature space according to the mini-batch training samples. Differently, BatchFormerV2 is able to insert different layers in Transformer modules, and learns the transform implicitly. Therefore, BatchFormerV2 can be easily applied to dense prediction tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: Mini-Batch stochastic gradient descent optimization is one of core paradigm of training deep neural networks  [ref]23 .
