      "content": "Paper Title: Hardness of Token Swapping on Trees\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere have been many attempts to understand token swapping on a tree, but all have fallen short of determining its actual complexity. To summarize the previously stated results for sequential token swapping on a tree, there are three known 2-approximation algorithms, and no better approximation known. There are also exact algorithms for several special cases of trees, with the most general case being a broom (a path attached to a star). From the hardness side, attempts to prove that the problem is NP-complete have led to NP-completeness proofs for more general cases. In particular, token swapping on graphs of constant treewidth and diameter is NP-hard , and the ‚Äúweighted, colored‚Äù variant of token swapping on trees is NP-hard . This leads to our first main question: Question: Is sequential token swapping on a tree NP-complete? This question has been implicit since sequential token swapping on a tree was first studied over 30 years ago, and the question has been explicitly stated\nby Biniaz et al.¬†\nand by Bonnet et al.¬† who conjectured that the answer is yes. We resolve this question in the affirmative by providing a proof that sequential token swapping on a tree is NP-complete. Next, we turn to the approximability of token swapping on a tree. The fact that there were three independently discovered 2-approximation algorithms, and nothing better is known, suggests that perhaps there is some barrier at approximation factor 2. This leads to our second main question: Question: Is there an inherent barrier to obtaining a (2‚àíŒµ)2ùúÄ(2-\\varepsilon)-approximation for sequential token swapping on trees? We address this question by showing that there is indeed a restriction on the types of algorithms that can achieve approximation factor better than 2. To motivate the class of algorithms we rule out, it helps to examine known algorithms. Specifically, it was previously known that neither Akers and Krishnamurthy‚Äôs ‚Äúhappy swap‚Äù algorithm  nor Yamanaka et al.‚Äôs cycle algorithm [ref]41 can possibly achieve an approximation ratio better than 2 .\nThese two algorithms share a natural property: every token tùë°t always\nremains within distance 111 of the shortest path from tùë°t‚Äôs start vertex to\ntùë°t‚Äôs destination vertex. A natural question is, can a better-than-222 approximation be achieved if one allows tokens to deviate from their shortest paths more, say to distance 101010 or 100100100? Motivated by this question, we define an ‚Ñìbold-‚Ñì\\ell-straying algorithm as an algorithm that never moves a token a distance more than ‚Ñì‚Ñì\\ell from its shortest path. We prove a surprisingly strong limitation on ‚Ñì‚Ñì\\ell-straying algorithms: any less-than-222-approximation algorithm for sequential token swapping on trees must in general bring a token\narbitrarily far‚Äîan Œ©‚Äã(n1‚àíŒµ)Œ©superscriptùëõ1ùúÄ\\Omega(n^{1-\\varepsilon}) distance away‚Äîfrom its shortest path. That is, no ‚Ñì‚Ñì\\ell-straying algorithm for ‚Ñì=o‚Äã(n1‚àíŒµ)‚Ñìùëúsuperscriptùëõ1ùúÄ\\ell=o(n^{1-\\varepsilon}) can achieve better than a 2-approximation. The other known 2-approximation algorithm (besides  and [ref]41), is the Vaughan-Portier algorithm\n, which in fact does move tokens arbitrarily far from their shortest paths. That is, our result on ‚Ñì‚Ñì\\ell-straying algorithms does not imply a limitation on the Vaughan-Portier algorithm. To address this,\nwe also obtain the first proof that the Vaughan-Portier algorithm\n is no better than a 222-approximation;\nthe best previous lower bound for its approximation factor was 4343\\frac{4}{3}\n. Thus, none of the known algorithms or even their generalizations can improve upon the approximation factor of 222. For parallel token swapping on a tree, less is known than for the sequential version. In particular, there is no known approximation algorithm nor is there any known hardness for tree-like graphs. Thus, the complexity of this problem is completely unclear. This leads to our third main question: Question: What is the complexity of parallel token swapping on a tree? We address this question by showing that parallel token swapping on a tree is NP-hard. In summary, our results are as follows: Sequential token swapping is NP-complete on trees. Parallel token swapping is NP-complete on trees, even on subdivided stars. Limitations on known techniques for approximating sequential token swapping on trees: No ‚Ñì‚Ñì\\ell-straying algorithm for any ‚Ñì=O‚Äã(n1‚àíŒµ)‚ÑìùëÇsuperscriptùëõ1ùúÄ\\ell=O(n^{1-{\\varepsilon}}) can achieve better than a 2-approximation. The Vaughan-Portier algorithm does not achieve better than a 2-approximation.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: we rule out, it helps to examine known algorithms.
