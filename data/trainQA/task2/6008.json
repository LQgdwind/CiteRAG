      "content": "Paper Title: IDQL: Implicit Q-Learning as an Actor-Critic Method with Diffusion Policies\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile offline RL has been approached with a wide range of algorithmic frameworks  , recent methods often use value-based algorithms derived from Q-learning and off-policy actor-critic methods. To adapt approaches to the offline setting, it is necessary to avoid overestimated values out-of-distribution actions [ref]27. To this end, recent methods use implicit divergence constraints    , explicit density models   [ref]27 5, and supervised learning terms 2. Some works also directly penalize out-of-distribution action Q-values  . Recently, implicit TD backups have been developed that avoid the use of out-of-sample actions in Q-function by using asymmetric loss functions with SARSA-style on-policy backups. This approach was proposed in IQL , which trains a Q-function with an expectile loss and then extracts a policy with AWR .\nHowever, the extraction procedure itself imposes a KL-divergence constraint, which is not consistent with the policy the critic captures. Extreme Q-learning (EQL)  modifies the Q-function objective in IQL to estimate a soft value consistent with the entropy regularized AWR policy. Concurrently, Xu et al.  provides another generalization of IQL in behavior-regularized MDPs, arriving at two new implicit Q-learning objectives. Our generalized IQL derivation is related, but features a different generalization form. Contrary to these papers, which focus on Q-learning, our primary practical contributions are in the policy extraction step motivated by this generalization.  Our method leverages expressive generative models to capture the policy. To that end, we review works that use expressive generative models for offline RL. EMaQ 5 defines a policy using an auto-regressive behavioral cloning model,\nusing the argmax action from this policy for backups in critic learning. The Decision Transformer and Trajectory Transformer   clone the entire trajectory space using transformers and apply reward conditioning or beam search, respectively, to bias sampled trajectories towards higher rewards. Diffusion models have also been used in behavioral cloning and offline RL.\nFlorence et al.  and Pearce et al.  use\nenergy-based models and diffusion models, respectively, for behavioral cloning. Janner et al.  and Ajay et al.  use diffusion to directly model and sample the trajectory space; samples are guided with gradient guidance or reward conditioning. Reuss et al.  uses diffusion policies for goal-conditioned imitation learning. Closest to our work are prior methods that represent the actor with a diffusion model in offline RL. Diffusion Q-learning (DQL) \nincorporates diffusion to parameterize the actor in a TD3+BC-style algorithm 2. Select from Behavior Candidates (SfBC)  uses importance reweighting from a diffusion behavior model to define the policy and then trains a critic with value iteration using samples from the policy. Action-Restricted Q-learning (ARQ) 6 performs a critic update with a diffusion behavior model and then uses AWR to extract the policy. Our method differs from these methods as the diffusion behavior model is kept separate from the critic learning process, only interacting with the critic at evaluation time. This makes it comparatively efficient to tune hyperparameters. Furthermore, to our knowledge, we are the first method to apply diffusion to online finetuning.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: algorithms derived from Q-learning and off-policy actor-critic methods.
