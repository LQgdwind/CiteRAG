      "content": "Paper Title: Inexact bilevel stochastic gradient methods for constrained and unconstrained lower-level problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA variety of problems arising in machine learning can be formulated in terms of bilevel optimization. Continual learning, neural architecture search, adversarial training, and hyperparameter tuning are among the most popular examples (see 5 for a review on this topic). Continual Learning (CL) aims to train ML models when the static task usually considered in learning problems (classification, regression, etc.) is replaced by a sequence of tasks that become available one at a time , and for which training and validation datasets are increasingly larger.\nFor each task, a CL instance is formulated as a bilevel problem, where at the UL problem one minimizes the validation error on a subset of model parameters (which includes all hyperparameters),\nand at the LL problem the training error is minimized on the remaining parameters. Then, a sequence of bilevel problems (one for each task) is solved. In a sense, CL is close to meta-learning [ref]28, where the goal is to determine the best learning process. The increasing interest in CL is motivated by the demand for approaches that help neural networks learn new tasks without forgetting the previous ones, a phenomenon which is referred to as catastrophic forgetting  [ref]22  . Another relevant ML area where bilevel optimization is used is Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for Deep Learning. The goal of this problem is to automate the task of designing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) such that the network’s prediction error is minimized. In recent years, NAS has been proposed in a bilevel optimization formulation . Finally, two other popular classes of ML applications that can be formulated by using bilevel optimization are adversarial training and hyperparameter tuning. Adversarial training aims to robustly address adversarial examples  which cannot be correctly classified by ML models once a small perturbation is applied. The adversarial training problem is handled by solving a min-max problem , which can be reformulated as a bilevel one. The max/LL problem is posed on the variables that perturb the data in a worst-case fashion, where the min/UL problem attempts to minimize the training error on the ML model parameters  .\nHyperparameter tuning aims to find the best values for the hyperparameters used in an ML model in order to increase its performance on unseen data    . In the bilevel formulations proposed in the literature, the UL problem optimizes the validation error over the hyperparameters, while the LL problem has the goal of finding the ML model parameters (e.g., neural network weights) that minimize the training error.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: at the LL problem the training error is minimized on the remaining parameters. Then, a sequence of bilevel problems (one for each task) is solved. In a sense, CL is close to meta-learning [ref]28, where the goal is to determine the best learning process. The increasing interest in CL is motivated by the demand for approaches that help neural networks learn new tasks without forgetting\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
