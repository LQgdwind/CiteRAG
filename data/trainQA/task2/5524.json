      "content": "Paper Title: SCONNA: A Stochastic Computing Based Optical Accelerator for Ultra-Fast, Energy-Efficient Inference of Integer-Quantized CNNs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPrior works , [ref]21, and  have analysed the scalability (i.e., achievable value of VDPE size N under the constraints of bit precision and data rate) of AMM and MAM VDPCs. Table I reproduces the supported values of VDPE size N (considering M=N) for AMM and MAM VDPCs at various data rates (DRs) and bit precision from [ref]21. From Table 1, the maximum N=44 is obtained for MAM VDPC across all tested DR and B values. For MAM VDPC for 1 GS/s, maximum N reduces from 44 to 12 as we increase the input/weight precision from 4-bit to 6-bit. The reason for such strong trade-off between N and achievable input/weight precision (referred to as B, henceforth) in MAM and AMM VDPCs is that both B and N strongly depend on the number of distinguishable analog optical power levels [ref]21, which is proportional to N√ó2BùëÅsuperscript2ùêµN\\times 2^{B}. Hence, for a fixed number of distinguishable analog optical power levels, which is defined by the analog optical power resolution of the utilized summation elements (SEs) (see SEs in Fig. 2) the supported N drastically decreases with an increase in B. As a result, N decreases all the way to 1 when B increases to 8-bit [ref]21. Due to such strong trade-off between N and B, the MAM and AMM type of analog VDPCs face two consequences. First, they produce high number of partial sums and incur significantly high latency for partial sum reduction. For example, a VDPE with N=44 for B=4-bit can only produce a VDP operation between two 44-point vectors.\nTherefore, producing a VDP operation between an input vector and kernel vector with S=4608 (e.g., ResNet50 [ref]21) requires that the input vector is first decomposed into a total of C=Ceil(S/N)=105 DIVs of N=44 points each. Similarly, the kernel vector also needs to be decomposed into a total of C=Ceil(S/N)=105 DKVs of N=44 points each. Then, a total of 105 VDPEs can be employed to perform 105 VDP operations between 105 pairs of DKVs and DIVs, to consequently produce a total of 105 intermediate VDP results (i.e., partial sums (psums)). Although these 105 VDP operations can be parallelized over 105 VDPEs, producing the final VDP result of S=4608 would require the accumulation of the 105 psums. Doing so can incur very high latency and energy consumption, which should be avoided using a more efficient VDPC design. As the second consequence, the throughput of the MAM and AMM VDPCs decreases at higher bit precision (higher value of B). This is because to avoid a drastic decrease in N as B increases beyond 4-bit, the AMM and MAM type of analog VDPCs typically operate at B=4-bit [ref]21. However, using at least 8-bit precision (B=8-bit) for the integer-quantized CNN models is recommended to achieve competitive inference accuracy, while also reducing the computational effort, memory requirements, and energy consumption . To meet this requirement, analog VDPCs from  (an MAM VDPC) and  (an AMM VDPC) employ bit-slicing of input/weight parameters. They slice each 8-bit integer input/weigh parameter into two slices of 4-bit each. Then, they employ two VDPCs in parallel; each VDPC processes one 4-bit slice of the input/weight parameters. The corresponding 4-bit VDP results from these two 4-bit VDPCs are then combined using shifters and adders to produce the final 8-bit results. Thus, performing VDP operations using bit slices reduces the total number of VDP results that can be produced by a fixed number of VDPCs, because multiple VDPCs are needed to produce a single set of VDP results. This can severely degrade the throughput of such VDPCs. Such undesired outcome should be avoided by designing a more efficient VDPC.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: Prior works , [ref]21, and  have analysed the scalability (i.e., achievable value of VDPE size N under the constraints of bit precision and data rate) of AMM and MAM VDPCs.
