      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Conditional Instrumental Variable Representation for Causal Effect Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare the DVAE.CIV against the famous estimators in conditional causal effect estimation that are widely utilised in causal inference from observational data. Note that the ACE can be obtained by averaging the CACE(W,Y)𝑊𝑌(W,Y) of all individuals. These compared causal effect estimators are introduced in the following. We compare our proposed DVAE.CIV with two Variational AutoEncoder based (VAE-based) causal effect estimators, three tree-based causal effect estimators, two machine learning based (ML-based) causal effect estimators, and three IV-based causal effect estimators. The two VAE-based causal effect estimators are Causal Effect Variational AutoEncoder (CEVAE)  and Treatment Effect estimation by Disentangled Variational AutoEncoder (TEDVAE) ). The three tree-based causal effect estimators are the standard Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) , causal random forest (CF) [ref]36 and causal random forest for IV regression (CFIVR) [ref]5. Note that CFIVR also belongs to IV-based estimators. The two ML-based causal effect estimators are double machine learning (DML)  and doubly robust learning (DRL) [ref]13. The three IV-based causal effect estimators are DeepIV , orthogonal instrumental variable (OrthIV)  and double machine learning based IV (DMLIV) . The five estimators TEDVAE, BART, CF, DML and DRL rely on the assumption of unconfoundedness  (i.e. no latent confounders in data), so the five estimators cannot deal with the case with the data with latent confounders. CEVAE can deal with latent confounders, but it requires that all measured variables are proxy variables of the latent confounders, while our DVAE.CIV model does not have the restriction. The IV-based estimators CFIVR, DeepIV, OrthIV and DMLIV require a known IV that is nominated based on domain knowledge, but the nominated IV usually is not a valid IV and thus may result in a wrong conclusion as argued in Introduction. We use Python and the libraries including pytorch , pyro  and econml to implement DVAE.CIV. In our experiments, the dimension of latent representations is set as |S|=1𝑆1\\left|S\\right|=1, |C|=5𝐶5\\left|C\\right|=5 and |F|=5𝐹5\\left|F\\right|=5, respectively. The implementation of CEVAE is based on the Python library pyro  and the code of TEDVAE is from the authors’ GitHub2††2 https://github.com/WeijiaZhang24/TEDVAE. For BART, we use the implementation in the R package bartCause . For CF and CFIVR, we use the implementations in the R functions causal__\\_forest and instrumental__\\_forest in the R package grf [ref]5, respectively. The implementations of DML, DRL, DeepIV, OrthIV and DMLIV are from the Python package encoml. For performance evaluation, two commonly used metrics are employed in our experiments. For the synthetic datasets, we use absolute error of average causal effect , i.e. εA​C​E=|A​C​E−A​C​E^|subscript𝜀𝐴𝐶𝐸𝐴𝐶𝐸^𝐴𝐶𝐸\\varepsilon_{ACE}=|ACE-\\hat{ACE}| where A​C​E𝐴𝐶𝐸ACE is the true causal effect and A​C​E^^𝐴𝐶𝐸\\hat{ACE} is the estimated causal effect, and Precision of the Estimation of Heterogeneous Effect (PEHE, it is used to evaluate the CACE estimations.)   εP​E​H​E=𝐄​(((y1−y0)−(y^1−y^0))2)subscript𝜀𝑃𝐸𝐻𝐸𝐄superscriptsubscript𝑦1subscript𝑦0subscript^𝑦1subscript^𝑦02\\sqrt{\\varepsilon_{PEHE}}=\\sqrt{\\mathbf{E}(((y_{1}-y_{0})-(\\hat{y}_{1}-\\hat{y}_{0}))^{2})} where y1,y0subscript𝑦1subscript𝑦0y_{1},y_{0} are the true outcomes and y^1,y^0subscript^𝑦1subscript^𝑦0\\hat{y}_{1},\\hat{y}_{0} are the predicted outcomes, to assess the performance of all methods in terms of the causal effect estimation. Lower values of both metrics indicate better performance. For multiple replications, we present the mean with standard deviation. For the three real-world datasets, we use the reference causal effect in the literature as the baseline to evaluate the performance of all estimators since there is no ground truth causal effect available.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: estimation by Disentangled Variational AutoEncoder (TEDVAE) ). The three tree-based causal effect estimators are the standard Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) , causal random forest (CF) [ref]36 and causal random forest for IV regression (CFIVR) [ref]5. Note that CFIVR also belongs to IV-based estimators. The two ML-based causal effect estimators are double machine learning (DML)\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
