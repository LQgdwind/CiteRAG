In this paper, we take the second approach.\nIf efficient classical simulation of quantum measurements is possible, then the measurements become invertible because classical computation is reversible.\nFrom the analogy of the rewinding technique used in zero-knowledge (see e.g., 9 0 1), we call such measurements rewindable measurements.\nThey make quantum computation genuinely reversible and incredibly powerful.\nMore formally, the following rewinding operator R𝑅R becomes possible. R𝑅R receives a post-measurement n𝑛n-qubit quantum state (|z⟩​⟨z|⊗I⊗n−1)​|ψ⟩tensor-productket𝑧bra𝑧superscript𝐼tensor-productabsent𝑛1ket𝜓(|z\\rangle\\langle z|\\otimes I^{\\otimes n-1})|\\psi\\rangle with z∈{0,1}𝑧01z\\in\\{0,1\\} and a classical description 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} of a pre-measurement quantum state |ψ⟩ket𝜓|\\psi\\rangle and outputs the quantum state |ψ⟩ket𝜓|\\psi\\rangle: where I≡|0⟩​⟨0|+|1⟩​⟨1|𝐼ket0bra0ket1bra1I\\equiv|0\\rangle\\langle 0|+|1\\rangle\\langle 1| is the two-dimensional identity operator.\nAs an important point, R𝑅R requires the classical description 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} as an input.\nIf it requires only (|z⟩​⟨z|⊗I⊗n−1)​|ψ⟩tensor-productket𝑧bra𝑧superscript𝐼tensor-productabsent𝑛1ket𝜓(|z\\rangle\\langle z|\\otimes I^{\\otimes n-1})|\\psi\\rangle as an input, the output state cannot be uniquely determined.\nFor example, in the case of both |ψ⟩=|0⟩​|+⟩ket𝜓ket0ket|\\psi\\rangle=|0\\rangle|+\\rangle and (|0⟩​|+⟩+|1⟩​|−⟩)/2ket0ketket1ket2(|0\\rangle|+\\rangle+|1\\rangle|-\\rangle)/\\sqrt{2}, the post-measurement state is |0⟩​|+⟩ket0ket|0\\rangle|+\\rangle for z=0𝑧0z=0, where |±⟩≡(|0⟩±|1⟩)/2ketplus-or-minusplus-or-minusket0ket12|\\pm\\rangle\\equiv(|0\\rangle\\pm|1\\rangle)/\\sqrt{2}.\nTo circumvent this problem, we require the classical description 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} as information about |ψ⟩ket𝜓|\\psi\\rangle.\nAs a concrete example, the classical descriptions of |0⟩​|+⟩ket0ket|0\\rangle|+\\rangle and (|0⟩​|+⟩+|1⟩​|−⟩)/2ket0ketket1ket2(|0\\rangle|+\\rangle+|1\\rangle|-\\rangle)/\\sqrt{2} are I⊗Htensor-product𝐼𝐻I\\otimes H and C​Z​(H⊗H)𝐶𝑍tensor-product𝐻𝐻CZ(H\\otimes H), respectively.\nHere, H≡|+⟩​⟨0|+|−⟩​⟨1|𝐻ketbra0ketbra1H\\equiv|+\\rangle\\langle 0|+|-\\rangle\\langle 1| is the Hadamard gate, C​Z≡|0⟩​⟨0|⊗I+|1⟩​⟨1|⊗Z𝐶𝑍tensor-productket0bra0𝐼tensor-productket1bra1𝑍CZ\\equiv|0\\rangle\\langle 0|\\otimes I+|1\\rangle\\langle 1|\\otimes Z is the controlled-Z𝑍Z (C​Z𝐶𝑍CZ) gate, and Z≡|0⟩​⟨0|−|1⟩​⟨1|𝑍ket0bra0ket1bra1Z\\equiv|0\\rangle\\langle 0|-|1\\rangle\\langle 1| is the Pauli-Z𝑍Z operator.\nThese descriptions are proper because |0⟩​|+⟩ket0ket|0\\rangle|+\\rangle and (|0⟩​|+⟩+|1⟩​|−⟩)/2ket0ketket1ket2(|0\\rangle|+\\rangle+|1\\rangle|-\\rangle)/\\sqrt{2} can be prepared by applying I⊗Htensor-product𝐼𝐻I\\otimes H and C​Z​(H⊗H)𝐶𝑍tensor-product𝐻𝐻CZ(H\\otimes H) on the fixed initial state |00⟩ket00|00\\rangle, respectively.\nFurthermore, we define rewinding operators for only pure states, that is their functionality is arbitrary for mixed states.\nDue to this restriction, we can avoid contradictions with an ordinary interpretation of mixed states (see Sec. 3) and the no-signaling principle (see Appendix I). It is strongly believed that the rewinding of measurements cannot be performed in ordinary quantum mechanics, i.e., the superposition is destroyed by measurements, and it cannot be recovered after measurements.\nOne may think that if the rewinding were possible against this belief, it could add extra computation power to universal quantum computers.\nWe show that this expectation is indeed correct.\nMore formally, we define 𝖱𝗐𝖡𝖰𝖯𝖱𝗐𝖡𝖰𝖯{\\sf RwBQP} (𝖡𝖰𝖯𝖡𝖰𝖯{\\sf BQP} with rewinding) as a set of decision problems solvable by polynomial-size quantum circuits with a polynomial number of rewinding operators and show 𝖡𝖰𝖯⊆𝖡𝖯𝖯𝖯𝖯⊆𝖱𝗐𝖡𝖰𝖯𝖡𝖰𝖯superscript𝖡𝖯𝖯𝖯𝖯𝖱𝗐𝖡𝖰𝖯{\\sf BQP}\\subseteq{\\sf BPP}^{\\sf PP}\\subseteq{\\sf RwBQP}. The rewinding operator can be considered a probabilistic postselection.\nBy just repeating measurements and rewinding operations until the target outcome is obtained, we can efficiently simulate the postselection with high probability if the output probability of the target outcome is at least the inverse of some polynomial.\nHowever, the original postselection enables us to deterministically obtain a target outcome even if the probability is exponentially small 2.\nIn this case, the above simple repeat-until-success approach requires an exponential number of rewinding operations on average.\nSurprisingly, we show that it is possible to exponentially mitigate probabilities of nontarget outcomes with a polynomial number of rewinding operators.\nBy using this mitigation protocol, we can obtain the target outcome with high probability even if the output probability of the target outcome is exponentially small.\nIn this sense, the rewinding and postselection are equivalent.\nMore formally, we show that 𝖱𝗐𝖡𝖰𝖯𝖱𝗐𝖡𝖰𝖯{\\sf RwBQP} is equivalent to the class 𝖠𝖽𝖯𝗈𝗌𝗍𝖡𝖰𝖯𝖠𝖽𝖯𝗈𝗌𝗍𝖡𝖰𝖯{\\sf AdPostBQP} (𝖡𝖰𝖯𝖡𝖰𝖯{\\sf BQP} with adaptive postselection) of decision problems solvable by polynomial-size quantum circuits with a polynomial number of adaptive postselections.\nHere, an adaptive postselection is a projector |b⟩​⟨b|ket𝑏bra𝑏|b\\rangle\\langle b| such that the value of b∈{0,1}𝑏01b\\in\\{0,1\\} depends on previous measurement outcomes.\nFrom this equivalence, we also obtain 𝖱𝗐𝖡𝖰𝖯⊆𝖯𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤𝖱𝗐𝖡𝖰𝖯𝖯𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤{\\sf RwBQP}\\subseteq{\\sf PSPACE}. The rewinding is also related to cloning.\nBy strengthening our rewinding operator in Eq. (1), we define the cloning operator C𝐶C as follows: Unlike Eq. (1), this operator does not require the post-measurement state (|z⟩​⟨z|⊗I⊗n−1)​|ψ⟩tensor-productket𝑧bra𝑧superscript𝐼tensor-productabsent𝑛1ket𝜓(|z\\rangle\\langle z|\\otimes I^{\\otimes n-1})|\\psi\\rangle.\nSince it is easy to duplicate the classical description 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}, we can efficiently duplicate |ψ⟩ket𝜓|\\psi\\rangle, i.e., generate |ψ⟩⊗2superscriptket𝜓tensor-productabsent2|\\psi\\rangle^{\\otimes 2} by simply applying C⊗Ctensor-product𝐶𝐶C\\otimes C on |𝒟⟩⊗2superscriptket𝒟tensor-productabsent2|\\mathcal{D}\\rangle^{\\otimes 2}.\nAlthough the ordinary cloning operator C~~𝐶\\tilde{C} is defined such that C~​(|ψ⟩​|0m⟩)=|ψ⟩⊗2~𝐶ket𝜓ketsuperscript0𝑚superscriptket𝜓tensor-productabsent2\\tilde{C}(|\\psi\\rangle|0^{m}\\rangle)=|\\psi\\rangle^{\\otimes 2} for some m∈ℕ𝑚ℕm\\in\\mathbb{N} 3, we define C𝐶C as an operator whose input is the classical description 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} of |ψ⟩ket𝜓|\\psi\\rangle rather than |ψ⟩ket𝜓|\\psi\\rangle itself.\nThis makes sense because we can always obtain a classical description of |ψ⟩ket𝜓|\\psi\\rangle in our setting555Since we are interested in complexity classes, we consider only quantum states generated from quantum circuits in uniform families..\nNote that it could be difficult to realize C𝐶C in quantum polynomial time because |ψ⟩ket𝜓|\\psi\\rangle might be prepared by using measurements.\nMore precisely, it may be defined as a quantum state prepared when the measurement outcome is 00, e.g., |ψ⟩=U2​(I⊗|0⟩​⟨0|⊗I⊗n−2)​U1​|0n⟩ket𝜓subscript𝑈2tensor-producttensor-product𝐼ket0bra0superscript𝐼tensor-productabsent𝑛2subscript𝑈1ketsuperscript0𝑛|\\psi\\rangle=U_{2}(I\\otimes|0\\rangle\\langle 0|\\otimes I^{\\otimes n-2})U_{1}|0^{n}\\rangle for some unitary operators U1subscript𝑈1U_{1} and U2subscript𝑈2U_{2}.\nWe show that 𝖱𝗐𝖡𝖰𝖯𝖱𝗐𝖡𝖰𝖯{\\sf RwBQP} is also equivalent to the class 𝖢𝖡𝖰𝖯𝖢𝖡𝖰𝖯{\\sf CBQP} (𝖡𝖰𝖯𝖡𝖰𝖯{\\sf BQP} with cloning) of decision problems solvable by polynomial-size quantum circuits with a polynomial number of cloning operators.\nThat is, the difference between Eqs. (1) and (2) does not matter to the computation power.\nThe following theorem summarizes our main results explained above:\n{result}[Theorem 3.11]\n\n𝖡𝖯𝖯𝖯𝖯⊆𝖱𝗐𝖡𝖰𝖯=𝖢𝖡𝖰𝖯=𝖠𝖽𝖯𝗈𝗌𝗍𝖡𝖰𝖯⊆𝖯𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤superscript𝖡𝖯𝖯𝖯𝖯𝖱𝗐𝖡𝖰𝖯𝖢𝖡𝖰𝖯𝖠𝖽𝖯𝗈𝗌𝗍𝖡𝖰𝖯𝖯𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤{\\sf BPP}^{\\sf PP}\\subseteq{\\sf RwBQP}={\\sf CBQP}={\\sf AdPostBQP}\\subseteq{\\sf PSPACE}.\n\nThe computation power of the cloning has been addressed in 4 as an open problem.\nResult 5 gives lower and upper bounds on our class 𝖢𝖡𝖰𝖯𝖢𝖡𝖰𝖯{\\sf CBQP}, and it seems to be a reasonable approach to capturing the power of cloning.\nNote that more precisely speaking, in Corollary 3.17, we obtain the lower bound 𝖡𝖰𝖯classical𝖯𝖯subscriptsuperscript𝖡𝖰𝖯𝖯𝖯classical{\\sf BQP}^{\\sf PP}_{{\\rm classical}}, which may be slightly tighter than 𝖡𝖯𝖯𝖯𝖯superscript𝖡𝖯𝖯𝖯𝖯{\\sf BPP}^{\\sf PP}.\nHere, the subscript “classical” is a symbol used in 2 and means that only classical queries are allowed. All the above results assume that rewinding operators can be utilized a polynomial number of times.\nUnder the strongly believed assumption that the shortest independent vectors problem (SIVP) 5 cannot be efficiently solved with universal quantum computers, we show that a single rewinding operator is sufficient to achieve a task that is intractable for universal quantum computation:\n{result}[Informal Version of Theorem 4.2]\n\nAssume that there is no polynomial-time quantum algorithm that solves the SIVP.\nThen, there exists a problem such that it can be efficiently solved with a constant probability if a single rewinding operator is allowed for quantum computation, but the probability is super-polynomially small if it is not allowed. We also show a superiority of a single rewinding operator under a different assumption:\n{result}[Informal Version of Corollary 4.5]\n\nLet 𝖱𝗐𝖡𝖰𝖯​(1)𝖱𝗐𝖡𝖰𝖯1{\\sf RwBQP}(1) be 𝖱𝗐𝖡𝖰𝖯𝖱𝗐𝖡𝖰𝖯{\\sf RwBQP} with a single rewinding operator.\nThen, 𝖱𝗐𝖡𝖰𝖯​(1)⊃𝖡𝖰𝖯𝖡𝖰𝖯𝖱𝗐𝖡𝖰𝖯1{\\sf RwBQP}(1)\\supset{\\sf BQP} unless 𝖡𝖰𝖯⊇𝖲𝖹𝖪𝖲𝖹𝖪𝖡𝖰𝖯{\\sf BQP}\\supseteq{\\sf SZK}.\n\nIt is strongly believed that 𝖡𝖰𝖯𝖡𝖰𝖯{\\sf BQP} does not include 𝖲𝖹𝖪𝖲𝖹𝖪{\\sf SZK}.\nAt least, we can say that it is hard to show 𝖡𝖰𝖯⊇𝖲𝖹𝖪𝖲𝖹𝖪𝖡𝖰𝖯{\\sf BQP}\\supseteq{\\sf SZK} because there exists an oracle A𝐴A such that 𝖡𝖰𝖯A⊉𝖲𝖹𝖪Anot-superset-of-nor-equalssuperscript𝖡𝖰𝖯𝐴superscript𝖲𝖹𝖪𝐴{\\sf BQP}^{A}\\nsupseteq{\\sf SZK}^{A} 6.\nFor example, by assuming that the decision version of SIVP, gapSIVP, is hard for universal quantum computation, Result 1.1 implies that a single rewinding operator is sufficient to achieve a task that is intractable for universal quantum computation.\nThis is because the gapSIVP (with an appropriate parameter) is in 𝖲𝖹𝖪𝖲𝖹𝖪{\\sf SZK} 7.\nAs a difference from Result 1.1, Result 1.1 shows the superiority of a single rewinding operator for decision problems. As simple observations, we also consider the effect of rewinding operators for restricted classes of quantum circuits.\nIt has been shown that polynomial-size Clifford circuits are classically simulatable 8.\nIn Appendix H, we show that such circuits with rewinding operators are still classically simulatable.\nIt is also known that IQP circuits are neither universal nor classically simulatable under plausible complexity-theoretic assumptions [ref]9.\nIn Appendix I, we show that IQP circuits with rewinding operators can efficiently solve any problem in 𝖯𝖯𝖯𝖯{\\sf PP}.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object. Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. Generate exactly 40 titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning."
