      "content": "Paper Title: EDoG: Adversarial Edge Detection For Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, several studies  [ref]53 [ref]54 have shown that graph neural networks for node classification are vulnerable under adversarial attack. This means that a malicious attacker can modify the graph Gùê∫G subtly into G‚Ä≤superscriptùê∫‚Ä≤G^{\\prime} before it is fed into the graph neural network such that the graph neural network will generate wrong classification results as desired by the attacker.  [ref]53 transform this setting into an optimization problem: where L‚Äã(‚ãÖ,‚ãÖ)ùêø‚ãÖ‚ãÖL(\\cdot,\\cdot) is the cross-entropy loss function between prediction vector of a node vtsubscriptùë£ùë°v_{t} and its ground truth class ytsubscriptùë¶ùë°y_{t}. ‚Ñê‚Äã(G,G‚Ä≤,vt)‚Ñêùê∫superscriptùê∫‚Ä≤subscriptùë£ùë°\\mathcal{I}(G,G^{\\prime},v_{t}) is an equivalency indicator which judges whether the small modification between G‚Ä≤superscriptùê∫‚Ä≤G^{\\prime} and Gùê∫G is reasonable. This indicator function may vary under different attack setting. Note that this optimization goal cannot be solved by gradient-based approach because the constraint space is discrete - the value in the adjacency matrix of a graph can only be 0 or 1. In order to solve this problem,  defines the equivalency indicator such that the attacker is only allowed to add/delete one edge. The authors propose to parametrize the perturbation generator G‚Ä≤=h‚Äã(G,vt)superscriptùê∫‚Ä≤‚Ñéùê∫subscriptùë£ùë°G^{\\prime}=h(G,v_{t}) as a neural network and trains it with reinforcement learning [ref]42. In [ref]53 the equivalency indicator is defined such that the total amount of changed edges and node features is bounded. They propose a simple approximate model of GNNs on which they can analytically solve the optimization problem. In [ref]54, the optimization problem is defined differently so that it is not restricted to a single node, but over a set of nodes (usually the entire graph): They solve the optimization problem by approximating the gradient of the adjacency matrix of G‚Ä≤superscriptùê∫‚Ä≤G^{\\prime} so that traditional gradient-based approach is employed.\n\nReference markers found: [53]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]53: Recently, several studies  [ref]53 [ref]54 have shown that graph neural networks for node classification are vulnerable under adversarial attack.
