      "content": "Paper Title: Policy Improvement via Imitation of Multiple Oracles\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe corroborate our theoretical discoveries with simulations of IL from multiple oracles. We compare MAMBA with two representative algorithms: GAE Policy Gradient  (PG-GAE with λ=0.9𝜆0.9\\lambda=0.9) for direct RL and AggreVaTeD [ref]14 for IL with a single oracle.\nBecause we can view these algorithms as different first-order feedback for policy optimization, comparing their performance allows us to study two important questions: 1) whether the proposed GAE-style gradient in (17) is an effective update direction for IL and 2) whether using multiple oracles helps the agent learn faster. Four continuous Gym  environments are used: CartPole and DoubleInvertedPendulum (DIP) based on DART physics engine , and Halfcheetah and Ant based on Mujoco physics engine .\nTo facilitate a meaningful comparison, we let these three algorithms use the same first-order optimizer444ADAM  for CartPole, and Natural Gradient Descent  for DIP, Halfcheetah, and Ant, train the same initial neural network policies, and share the same random seeds.\nIn each training iteration, an algorithm would perform H𝐻H rollouts following the RIRO paradigm (see also Algorithm 1),\nwhere H=8𝐻8H=8 for CartPole and DIP and H=256𝐻256H=256 for Halfcheetah and Ant.\nEach oracle policy here is a partially trained, suboptimal neural network555The best and the worst oracles in scores of 87 and 9 in CartPole, 4244 and 2440 in DIP, 1726 and 1395 in Halfcheetah, and 1051 and 776 in Ant., and its value function approximator used in MAMBA is trained online along policy optimization, by Monte-Carlo estimates obtained from the RIRO data collection. Please see Appendix D for implementation details.\nThe codes are provided at https://github.com/microsoft/MAMBA. First we consider in Fig. 2 the single-oracle IL setting with the oracle that has the highest return in the CartPole environment. We see that with the help of the oracle policy, AggreVaTeD (which is MAMBA with λ=0𝜆0\\lambda=0) improves faster than PG-GAE. However, while AggreVaTeD learns to significantly outperform the oracle, it does not reach the optimal performance, like PG-GAE. To improve the learner performance, we use MAMBA with λ>0𝜆0\\lambda>0 to learn from the same suboptimal oracle. As shown in Theorem 2 using a positive λ𝜆\\lambda can increase the amount of improvement that can be made from the oracle compared with λ=0𝜆0\\lambda=0. The trend in Fig. 2 supports this insight, where high λ=0.9𝜆0.9\\lambda=0.9 allows the learner to reach higher return. We found that using the middle λ=0.5𝜆0.5\\lambda=0.5 gives the worst performance, likely because it settles badly in the trade-off of properties.\nIn the following experiments, we will use λ=0.9𝜆0.9\\lambda=0.9 for MAMBA as it performs the best here. We show the effects of using multiple oracles in Fig. 3 for the remaining three environments (the results of CartPole can be found in Fig. 1 and Appendix D). Here we run MAMBA with λ=0.9𝜆0.9\\lambda=0.9 with 1, 2, 4, or 8 oracles. We index these oracles in a descending order of their performances with respect to the initial state distribution;\ne.g., MAMBA-0.9-1 uses the best oracle and MAMBA-0.9-2 uses the top two.\nInterestingly, by including more but strictly weaker oracles, MAMBA starts to improve the performance of policy optimization. Overall MAMBA greatly outperforms PG-GAE and AggreVaTeD across all the environments, even when just using a single oracle.666The bad performance of PG-GAE in Ant is due to that all learners can only collect a fixed number of trajectories in each iteration, as opposed to a fixed number of samples used in usual RL benchmarks. This setting is a harder RL problem and better resembles real-world data collection where reset is expensive.\nThe benefit of using more oracles becomes smaller, however, as we move to the right of Fig. 3 into higher dimensional problems. Although using more oracles can potentially yield higher performance, the learner also needs to spend more time to learn the oracles’ value functions.\nTherefore, under the same interaction budget, the value approximation quality worsens when there are more oracles.\nThis phenomenon manifests particularly in our direct implementation, which trains each value function estimator independently with Monte-Carlo samples. We believe that the scalability for dimensionality can be improved by using off-policy techniques and sharing parameters across different networks. We leave this as an important future direction. We conclude this paper by revisiting Fig. 1, which showcases the best multi-oracle settings in Fig. 3. Overall these results support the benefits of IL from multiple oracles and the new GAE-style IL gradient in (17).\nIn conclusion, we propose a novel theoretical foundation and algorithm MAMBA for IL with multiple oracle policies. We study how the conflicts between different oracles can be resolved through the max-aggregated baseline and propose a new GAE-style gradient for the IL setting, which can also be used to improve the robustness and performance of existing single-oracle IL algorithms.\nWe provide regret-based theoretical guarantees on MAMBA and demonstrate its properties empirically. The experimental results show that MAMBA is able to improve upon multiple, very suboptimal oracle policies to achieve the optimal performance, faster than both the pure RL method (PG-GAE ) and the single-oracle IL algorithm (AggreVaTeD [ref]14).\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: discoveries with simulations of IL from multiple oracles.
