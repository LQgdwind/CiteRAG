      "content": "Paper Title: GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) – A Comprehensive Review on Enabling Technologies, Potential Applications, Emerging Challenges, and Future Directions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent years have seen significant advancements in technology, including in the healthcare industry. Biotechnology, medical devices, and pharmaceuticals have undergone transformations through the use of cutting-edge technologies like DL  and ML . Currently, the healthcare sector is utilizing various forms of AI techniques for medical research and providing medical services. One such technique is the GPT features of NLP, which hold immense potential for the healthcare industry. GPT can help to overcome several challenges in healthcare in multiple ways. For instance, it can be used to develop intelligent systems that assist doctors in making accurate diagnoses and providing clinical assistance  . GPT can also analyze large volumes of medical data and generate reports. Furthermore, it has potential applications in drug discovery  , personalized medicine, patient diagnosis, medical image analysis, analyzing electronic health records, clinical decision support systems, and disease prediction. Drug Discovery: Recent AI and machine learning techniques   are having the potential to contribute to the growth and development of drug discovery. GPTs are capable of learning new patterns and relationships [ref]90 in the dataset they were trained on. This capability can be used in drug discovery to aid in the identification and design of potential new drugs with desired properties. One of the key challenges in drug discovery is finding compounds that can interact with specific parts of the body. GPT can help in this process by learning the patterns and relationships from large databases of known compounds . GPT can be trained on large sets of chemical databases to analyze chemical reactions and their outcomes. This can help suggest potential combinations of new drugs using the analyzed data. These new drugs can also be analyzed using GPT to test their efficacy and toxicity. Diagnosis:\nGPT can be used in medical diagnosis by analyzing patient data. It can help to analyze medical records and extract information such as patient demographics, symptoms, and medical history. This can help medical professionals provide effective patient care and improve outcomes. The recent release of GPT-4 has the ability to support multimodal information, allowing it to analyze images as input and produce text results as output . It is recommended to use AI systems such as a GPT, as clinical support tools to assist medical professionals in diagnosing and treating patients, but they should not be relied upon as the sole source of medical advice or decision-making. GPT can also be used to identify rare diseases by analyzing patient’s complete information. The authors in  have used a general-purpose GPT based on GPT-3 model for patient diagnosis and triage. The model has given a triage accuracy of 70% which was worse than a physician. But, in next subsequent weeks, the accuracy has improved to 92% which is close to the performance of a physician. In diagnosis, GPT-3 model has given 88% accuracy. For emergency cases, GPT-3 has given 75% accuracy whereas physician has given 94%. Disease prediction: GPT has great potential in disease prediction . By analyzing large amounts of medical data, including patient records, medical images, and clinical trials, these pre-trained language models can learn patterns and make predictions about the likelihood of a patient developing a particular disease. For instance, trained healthcare GPTs can be used to predict the occurrence of diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer by analyzing various parameters, including the patient’s medical history, age, family history, and lifestyle. It can also be used to predict the likelihood of a rare disease This helps in the early detection of high-risk patients so that medical personnel can take necessary measures and suitable medicines to reduce the risk of developing the disease. The medical practitioner and author in  have recommended using GPT-4 models’ ability of NLP in bariatric surgery. Personalized medicine:\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted that not all body systems are clinically similar. For instance, during the pandemic, medicines like Remdesivir and Tocilizumab have been effective for one category of patients but do not affect another category of patients with similar clinical metrics, as they progress from a mild or moderate level of infection to a severe stage . This highlights the need for personalized medicine in today’s world. GPT can be used to identify variable patterns of data to predict or classify hidden or unseen patterns, which can be used for exploratory data analysis. GPT provide the possibility of identifying personalized medicines  based on the clinical, genomic, and nutritional data of patients. The dietician and the author in  have observed that the utilization of Chat GPTs has significantly decreased obesity rates among patients by offering personalized recommendations regarding nutrition plans, exercise programs, and psychological support. This approach allows for the development of customized treatment plans that cater to the specific needs of individuals, leading to a more efficient method of treating obesity with the assistance of Chat GPT.\n\nReference markers found: [90]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]90: Recent AI and machine learning techniques   are having the potential to contribute to the growth and development of drug discovery.
