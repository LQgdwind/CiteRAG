      "content": "Paper Title: Grammar-Based Grounded Lexicon Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe second domain we consider is language-driven navigation. We evaluate models on the SCAN dataset¬†: a collection of sentence and navigational action sequence pairs. There are 6 primitive actions: jump, look, walk, run, lturn, and rturn, where an instruction turn left twice and run will be translated to lturn lturn run. All instructions are generated from a finite context-free grammar, so that we can systematically construct train-test splits for different types of compositional generalizations. Setup. We use a string-editing domain-specific language (DSL) for modeling the meaning of words in the SCAN dataset, of which the details can be found in the supplementary material. At a high level, the model supports three primitive operations: constructing a new constant string (consisting of primitive operations), concatenating two strings, and repeating the input string for a number of times. For G2L2, we generate candidate lexicons by enumerating functions in the string-editing DSL with up to 2 arguments and the function body has a maximum depth of 3. We also allow at most one of the argument being functor-typed, for example, V\\V/(V\\V). To handle parsing ambiguities, we use two primitive syntax types SùëÜS and VùëâV, while both of them are associated with the semantic type of string. In total, we have 178 candidate lexicon entries for each word. Baselines. We compare G2L2 to seven baselines. (1) Seq2seq [ref]40 trains an LSTM-based encoder-decoder model. We follow the hyperparameter setups of . (2) Transformer¬†[ref]44 is a 4-head Transformer-based autoregressive seq2seq model. We tuned the hidden size (i.e., the dimension of intermediate token representations) within {100, 200, 400}, as well as the number of layers (for both the encoder and the decoder) from {2, 4, 8}. Other methods are based on different data augmentation schemes for training a LSTM seq2seq model. Specifically, (3) GECA augments the original training splits using heuristic span recombination rules; (4) WordDrop¬†[ref]17 performs random dropout for input sequence (while keeping the same label); (5) similarly, SwitchOut  randomly replaces an input token with a random token from the vocabulary; (6) SeqMix¬†[ref]17 uses soft augmentation techniques following , which composes an ‚Äúweighted average‚Äù of different input sequences; (7) recomb-2¬† learns recombination and resampling rules for augmentation. Results. We compare different models on three train-test splits. In Simple, the training and test instructions are drawn from the same distribution. We compare the data efficiency of various models by using either 10% or 100% of the training data, and test them on the same test split. While all models can achieve a nearly-perfect accuracy with 100% training data, our model G2L2 shows advantage with only a small amount of data. Next, in Compositional, we have held out the sentences containing certain phrases, such as jump and around right. For these held-out phrases, only valid non-contextual examples containing them (i.e., jump in isolation and no example for around right) are available during training. During test, algorithms need to make systematical generalization of these phrases in novel contexts. Finally, in Length, all training examples have the action length less than or equal to 22, while that of a test example is up to 48. Our model consistently reach perfect performance in all considered settings, even on the cross-length generalization task where GECA does not help improve performance.\nThese results are consistent with the conclusions we derived on the CLEVR dataset. Specifically, data-augmentation techniques for SCAN can solve simple generalization tests (e.g., jump, where tests all have close neighbors in the training set, differing by just one word) but not the hard ones (e.g., length, where test sentences can different in multiple words from any training examples). Cases study.\nG2L2 is expressive enough to achieve perfect accuracy on the SCAN dataset: there exists a set of lexicon entries which matches the groundtruth in SCAN. However, our learning algorithm does not always converge on the correct lexicon, but when it fails, the failure can be identified based on training-set accuracy. So, we perform model selection based on the training accuracy for G2L2: after a sufficient number of epochs, if the model hasn‚Äôt reached perfect accuracy (100%), we re-initialize the weights and train the model again. Our results show that, among 100 times of training, the model reaches 100% accuracy 74% of the time. For runs that don‚Äôt have 100% accuracy, the average performance is 0.94. Since G2L2 directly learns human-interpretable lexicon entries associated with each individual words, we can further inspect the failure cases made by it when the training accuracy does not converge to 0. We find that the most significant failure mode is the word and (e.g., jump and run) and after (e.g., jump after run). Both of them are treated as connectives in SCAN. Sometimes G2L2 fails to pick the syntax type S\\V/V over the type V\\V/V. The entry V\\V/V will succeed in parsing most cases (e.g., jump and run), except that it will introduce ambiguous parsing for sentences such as ‚Äújump and run twice‚Äù: jump and run twice vs. jump and run twice. Based on the definition of the SCAN, only the first derivation is valid. In contrast, using S\\V/V resolves this ambiguity. Depending on the weight initialization and the example presentation order, G2L2 sometimes get stuck at the local optima of V\\V/V. However, we can easily identify this by the training accuracies‚ÄîG2L2 is able to reach perfect performance on all considered splits by simply retraining with another random seed, therefore, we only select those with 100% training accuracy as valid models.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: and VùëâV, while both of them are associated with the semantic type of string.
