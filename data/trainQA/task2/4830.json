      "content": "Paper Title: An Ensemble Teacher-Student Learning Approach with Poisson Sub-sampling to Differential Privacy Preserving Speech Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSpeech data privacy has attracted increasing public attention¬† when personal speech data are employed to deploy widespread speech application.\nIn fact, unsuccessful privacy protection examples have been reported and associated with large amounts of financial punishments, which include Google‚Äôs 57 million Euros fine in 2019 and Amazon‚Äôs 746 million Euros fine in 2021 related to insufficient data protection and privacy measurement on their deployed advertisement models and speech processing systems against GDPR. Differential privacy¬†[ref]2 (DP) is one solution that provides both rigorous mathematical guarantees of the privacy budget measurement, and effective system results against privacy-based attacks¬†. The foundation of DP is based on theoretical cryptography and point-wise perturbation introduced by the database research community. By applying random perturbation (e.g., additive noise or shuffling) under DP, personal information could be measured by statistical divergences¬† in terms of privacy budgets111Apple has deployed differential privacy measurement with a privacy budget (ŒµùúÄ\\varepsilon=8)\non its iOS and macOS systems. The results are reported in an official document in https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/Differential_Privacy_Overview.pdf. (e.g., the power of anonymization¬†). Therefore, how to connect DP-preserving mechanisms and DNN-based systems has become an important research topic due to its potential to provide formal measurement¬†[ref]6 on privacy budgets for end-users. There are two main streams of DP-related ML research: (1) reducing a cost of privacy budget (e.g., fewer additive distortions) under the same system performance and (2) advancing DP preserving algorithms to deep learning-based systems (e.g., improving system performance under a fixed privacy budget). Previous works demonstrate that training ML models with DP-preserving intervention would yield a serve performance degradation. Meanwhile, teacher-student learning (TSL)¬†[ref]7 serves as an advanced privacy solution, that transfers knowledge of DP-preserving properties from the teacher model and outcomes to a private student model. TSL-based DP-aware training, including privacy-aggregation of teacher ensemble¬†[ref]7 (PATE) and PATE with generative models¬†, applies DP-aware noisy perturbation and avoids data interfering directly to degrade model performance. In particular, ASR-related tasks are even more sensitive to the scale of training data in order to achieve good recognition results using advanced deep techniques, such as self-attention network¬†, and recurrent neural network transducer¬†0. We are thus motivated to propose a solution to efficiently allocate training data for deploying DP-preserving ASR systems. In this work, we introduce a new private teacher training framework by using a DP-preserving Poisson sub-sampling¬†1 2 from a sensitive dataset, where the sub-sampling mechanism aims to avoid splitting into subsets¬†[ref]7 3 used in the PATE to calculate the private budget. We provide an experimental study on Mandarin speech recognition, where we conduct our experiments on two different tasks of isolated word recognition and continuous speech recognition.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: 746 million Euros fine in 2021 related to insufficient data protection and privacy measurement on their deployed advertisement models and speech processing systems against GDPR.
