      "content": "Paper Title: An Overview of Privacy in Machine Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAttacking Machine Learning as a Service. MIA against black-box machine learning models was first studied\nby Shokri et al. , in the context of supervised learning.\nThey focus on classification models trained by commercial Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) providers, such as Google and Amazon, whereby a user has API access to a trained model. More specifically, customers in possession of a dataset and a data classification task can upload the dataset to the MLaaS service and pay it to construct a model.\nThe service then makes the model available to the customer—typically as a black-box API.\nThis setting is illustrated in Figure 4.\nFor example, a mobile-app maker can use such a service to analyze users’ activities and query the resulting model inside the app to promote in-app purchases to users when they are most likely to respond.\nMoreover, some machine-learning services also let data owners expose their models to external users for querying or even sell them. Inference via overfitting. Shokri et al. ’s approach exploits differences in the model’s response to inputs that were or were not seen during training.\nFor each class of the targeted black-box model, they train a shadow model, with the same machine learning technique; the intuition is that the model ends up “overfitting” on data used for training .\nOverfitting is a modeling error that occurs when a function is too closely fit to a limited set of data points, and thus performs better on the training inputs than on the inputs drawn from the same population but not used during the training.\nTherefore, the attacker can exploit the confidence values on inputs belonging to the same classes and learn to infer membership. Then, Salem et al. , although also building on overfitting signals, relax several adversarial assumptions—e.g., using multiple shadow models, knowledge of the target model structure, and having a dataset from the same distribution as the target model’s training data—showing that MIAs are very broadly applicable at low cost and thereby pose a more severe risk than previously thought.\nOverall, the attacks are relatively successful across the board, more or less so depending on the adversary’s prior knowledge, the datasets, the task at hand, etc. ML and overfitting. Another line of work studies the relationship between overfitting and information leakage.\nIn particular, Yeom et al.  assume that the adversary knows the distribution from which the training set was drawn and its size, and that the adversary colludes with the training algorithm.\nTheir attacks are close in performance to Shokri et al.’s , and show that, besides overfitting, the influence of target attributes on model’s outputs also correlates with successful attacks.\nTruex et al.  extend  to a more general setting and show how membership inference attacks are largely transferable. Generative models. While the research discussed above focus on discriminative models, other work target generative models.\nAs discussed in Section 2.1, they are used to generate new samples from the same underlying distribution of a given training dataset, e.g., to artificially generate plausible images and videos.\nHere the attacker targets a MLaaS engine that provides synthetic samples on demand – e.g., the user’s query is “provide an image sample of a cat” – based on a trained generative model.\nOnce again, inferring whether specific data points are part of the training set for that generative model may constitute a serious privacy breach.\nNote that membership inference on generative models is much more challenging than on discriminative models: in the former, the attacker cannot exploit confidence values on inputs belonging to the same classes, and therefore it is more difficult to detect overfitting and mount the attack. Hayes et al. [ref]25 consider both black-box and white-box attacks: in the former, the adversary can only make queries to the model under attack, i.e., the target model, and has no access to the internal parameters.\nIn the latter, she also has access to the parameters.\nTo mount the attacks, they train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)  on samples generated from the target model; i.e,, using generative models as a method to learn information about the target generative model, and thus create a local copy of the target model from which they can launch the attack.\nThe intuition is that, if a generative model overfits, then a GAN—which combines a discriminative model and a generative model—should be able to detect this overfitting, since the discriminator is trained to learn statistical differences in distributions.\nMoreover, for white-box attacks, the attacker-trained discriminator itself can be used to measure information leakage of the target model. Federated Learning. In this setting, the attack can be mounted by an adversary, a participant in the federated learning, attempting to infer whether a specific record is part of the training set of either a specific or any participant.\nThe first MIA against federated learning is presented by Melis et al. , whose main intuition is to exploit unintended leakage from either the embedding layer (all deep learning models operating on non-numeric data where the input space is discrete and sparse first use an embedding layer to transform inputs into a lower-dimensional vector representation) or the gradients (in deep learning models, gradients are computed by back-propagating the loss through the\nentire network from the last to the first layer).\nAn illustration of Melis et al. ’s attack is in Figure 5.\nThen, Nasr et al.  design MIAs during the training phase in a white-box setting, including passive and active attackers based on the different adversary prior knowledge.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: in the former, the attacker cannot exploit confidence values on inputs belonging to the same classes, and therefore it is more difficult to detect overfitting and mount the attack.
