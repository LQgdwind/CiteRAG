      "content": "Paper Title: Demystifying Platform Requirements for Diverse LLM Inference Use Cases\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are among the most popular variants of generative AI models performing auto-regressive tasks. LLMs are used in various applications, including chatbots, code generation, question answering, chemical property prediction, protein sequencing, and video generation . Commercial products like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Github Copilot[ref]104, have performed astonishingly well in diverse metrics, often outperforming human experts. LLMs have shown great scaling law property  [ref]52, with larger models    demonstrating better performance as compared to the smaller ones [ref]125. Currently, the largest model is known to have ∼similar-to\\sim1.8T parameters , with future LLMs potentially exceeding even a few hundred trillion parameters. LLM inference\ncan be broken into two stages, namely the prefill and the decode stage. The prefill stage consists of a single forward pass using all the input tokens. The auto-regressive decode stage generates one output token with each forward pass of the model. The prefill stage often portrays characteristics similar to training forward pass and has significant computing requirements. In contrast, the decode stage requires memory bandwidth and capacity (especially when processing long context queries). To provide efficient LLM inference, extensive efforts are being made to develop optimizations from both the industry and academic community, including model compression (quantization   , tensor decomposition , pruning   , knowledge distillation ), fast token decoding    ), system optimizations (paged attention, flash attention, chunked inference, scheduling), and so on.\nMany of these techniques have also become part of the inference-serving engine\nsuch as TensorRT-LLM , vLLM , DeepSpeed-FastGen ,\nand inference servers such as\nRayLLM  with RayServe, TGI and TensorRT-LLM + Triton. The aforementioned works\nhave enabled vast inference performance improvements for LLMs on current hardware platforms111We define platform as the complete hardware back-end including NPUs (e.g., GPUs or TPUs), local memories (e.g. HBM), remote offload memories (e.g., CPU DRAM) and inter-NPU interconnect (e.g., NVlinks/XeLinks)..\nUnfortunately, they do not automatically provide an answer to how to design next-generation platforms for LLM inference.\nIt is not trivial as there are a plethora of emerging LLMs with increasing accuracy and context lengths , a diverse suite of LLM inference use cases, and various AI platform vendors (e.g., NVIDIA, Intel, AMD, Google, Cerebras, and others) with their own HW/SW frameworks. The aim of this work is to demystify and quantify AI platform requirements (i.e., compute FLOPs, memory capacity, memory bandwidth, interconnect latency, and interconnect bandwidth) across a suite of LLM inference use cases and representative models.\nTo this end, we introduce a first-order analytical model, namely GenZ  (Generative LLM analyZer), to distill down the impact of different hardware parameters on end-to-end inference performance.\nUsing this tool, we can study current platforms via efficiency factors for the hardware components (which we determine from real-system validation measurements) without getting limited by their specific software tool chains.\nWe also use GenZ to quantify the hardware requirements for different LLM use cases.\nThese studies help us gain first-order vendor-agnostic insights into platform design and configurations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to quantify platform-wide requirements for meeting the serving SLOs of generative AI models for different use cases.\nWe believe this work makes two unique contributions to the community. First, the data provided by this work can potentially guide AI engineers working on deploying LLMs to choose suitable hardware platform configurations for their use case(s).\nNext, this work provides concrete directions to computer architects designing the next generation of AI platforms by navigating the interplay between various HW characteristics and LLM inference performance.\n Fig. 1 highlights a subset of our key observations for two distinct deployment scenarios.\nWe have quantified and noticed a significant difference in the serving requirements between the prefill and decode stages. Although the absolute values fluctuate with the workload, the identified trend remains consistent.\nWe identify FLOPS and interconnect BW as the bottleneck for the prefill stage, while memory BW and interconnect link latency are the key bottlenecks for the decode stage. To summarize, this work makes the following contributions: We introduce GenZ, a first-order analytical tool that helps analyze LLM workload on different platforms. Fig. 2 shows an overview of our proposed tool. We provide an analysis of the performance impact of different workload optimizations using GenZ. We provide an analysis of the performance impact of different platform characteristics using GenZ. We provide an analysis of the platform requirements for the target LLM inference to meet the given Service Level Objectives (SLOs) with the target use case using GenZ.\n\nReference markers found: [104]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]104: including chatbots, code generation, question answering, chemical property prediction, protein sequencing, and video generation .
