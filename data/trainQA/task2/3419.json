      "content": "Paper Title: Data Heterogeneity-Robust Federated Learning via Group Client Selection in Industrial IoT\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEnvironment and Hyperparameter Setup.\nIn the experiment, we consider an IIoT application where OCR technology is used in the identification of packing boxes, machines, robots, vehicles, and workers, through recognizing the optical characters on their badges. To this end, we aim to train a high-accuracy OCR model in the federated setting, where sensors’ local character images are confidential and skewed in the class distribution. The real-world FEMNIST dataset is chosen to train our federated OCR model, as it is built by partitioning 805,263 optical digit and character images into 3,550 devices, following non-i.i.d.-like class distributions and uneven data sizes. Our experiment platform contains K=350𝐾350K=350 OCR cameras and M=10𝑀10M=10 factories, each factory m𝑚m has Km=35superscript𝐾𝑚35K^{m}=35 OCR cameras (hereinafter referred to as devices). In each iteration, L=10𝐿10L=10 devices are selected from each factory to participate in the federated OCR training. A four-layer convolutional neural network [Conv2D(32), MaxPool, Conv2D(64), MaxPool, Dense(2048), Dense(62)] is used as the training model because it is lightweight and suitable for resource-constrained industrial devices. Unless otherwise specified, we use the standard mini-batch SGD to train local ML models, with the learning rate η=0.01𝜂0.01\\eta=0.01, the batch size n=32𝑛32n=32, the number of iterations per round T=50𝑇50T=50 and the maximum number of rounds R=500𝑅500R=500. GBP-CS Initialization.\nThe choice of the initial point 𝐱1subscript𝐱1\\mathbf{x}_{1} in GBP-CS is critical to the quality of the solution, because a bad initial point may cause GBP-CS to fall into a local minimum. In the experiment, Lrnd=2subscript𝐿rnd2L_{\\mathrm{rnd}}=2 devices are pre-sampled at random, and the other Lsel=L−Lrnd=8subscript𝐿sel𝐿subscript𝐿rnd8L_{\\mathrm{sel}}=L-L_{\\mathrm{rnd}}=8 devices are selected using GBP-CS, with the following three initialization methods. Random Initialization. Set Lselsubscript𝐿selL_{\\mathrm{sel}} values in 𝐱1subscript𝐱1\\mathbf{x}_{1} to 1 at random and leave other values at 0. Zero Initialization. All values in 𝐱1subscript𝐱1\\mathbf{x}_{1} are first initialized to 0. Then, a warm-up step is performed to meet the vector weight constraint Eq. (13), in which one value 𝐱1​(i)subscript𝐱1𝑖\\mathbf{x}_{1}\\left(i\\right) with the smallest gradient is set to 1 iteratively until the number of value 1 in 𝐱1subscript𝐱1\\mathbf{x}_{1} reaches Lselsubscript𝐿selL_{\\mathrm{sel}}. The warm-up step requires additional Lselsubscript𝐿selL_{\\mathrm{sel}} iterations. Moore-Penrose Inverse Initialization (MPInv). MPInv is first used to solve the least square solution 𝐱~1=𝐀−1​𝐲subscript~𝐱1superscript𝐀1𝐲\\mathbf{\\tilde{x}}_{1}=\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\mathbf{y} of the unconstrained objective function min𝐱​‖𝐀𝐱−𝐲‖L2𝐱subscriptnorm𝐀𝐱𝐲subscript𝐿2\\underset{\\mathbf{x}}{\\min}\\left\\|\\mathbf{Ax}-\\mathbf{y}\\right\\|_{L_{2}}. Then, Lselsubscript𝐿selL_{\\mathrm{sel}} elements with the largest values in 𝐱~1subscript~𝐱1\\mathbf{\\tilde{x}}_{1} are set to 1 and others are left at 0 to obtain the initial point 𝐱1subscript𝐱1\\mathbf{x}_{1}. Comparison Algorithms.\nTo highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed GBP-CS, we consider the following five benchmark client selection methods for comparison. Random Sampler (Random): From each group, Lselsubscript𝐿selL_{\\mathrm{sel}} devices are uniformly and randomly sampled. Monte Carlo Sampler (MC): Repeat the random sampler 1000 times and the solution minimizes Eq. (10) is used. Brute Sampler (Brute): Brutely search for the optimal Lselsubscript𝐿selL_{\\mathrm{sel}} devices by traversing all feasible solutions to meet Eqs. (10)-(13). Bayesian Sampler (Bayesian): Search for a sub-optimal Lselsubscript𝐿selL_{\\mathrm{sel}} devices using Bayesian optimization to meet Eqs. (10)-(13). By default, we set the number of initial points to 5 and exploration iterations to 25. Genetic Sampler (GA): Search for a sub-optimal Lselsubscript𝐿selL_{\\mathrm{sel}} devices using genetic algorithm[ref]48 to meet Eqs. (10)-(13), in which the constrained 0-1 vector solutions are regarded as genes and suffer from selection, crossover, mutation and elimination. By default, we set the population size to 100, the mutation probability to 0.001, and the number of generations to 100. Except for the baseline FedAvg[ref]24, other nine advanced approaches are also experimentally compared with FedGS in the presence of non-i.i.d. data. They are FedMMD, FedFusion, FedProx[ref]28, IDA, CGAU, FedAvgM, and FedAdagrad, FedAdam, FedYogi from . Implementation.\nWe implement FedGS on a standard FL simulator Leaf-MX111Leaf-MX: https://github.com/Lizonghang/leaf-mx (an MXNET implementation of LEAF).\nThe code implementation is open-available on Github: https://github.com/Lizonghang/fedgs.\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: By default, we set the number of initial points to 5 and exploration iterations to 25. Genetic Sampler (GA): Search for a sub-optimal Lselsubscript𝐿selL_{\\mathrm{sel}} devices using genetic algorithm[ref]48 to meet Eqs. (10)-(13), in which the constrained 0-1 vector solutions are regarded as genes and suffer from selection, crossover, mutation and elimination.
