      "content": "Paper Title: Leveraging the Video-level Semantic Consistency of Event for Audio-visual Event Localization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we remove the individual module from the network and re-evaluate it in both supervised settings, as shown in Table III. The effectiveness of the ESCM. To evaluate the effect of ESCM, we remove the ESCM module and denote it as “w/o ESCM”. We observe from the table that the performance drops in both settings significantly. Specifically, compared to the full model, the accuracy of the “w/o ESCM” decreases by 1.8% (from 79.7% to 77.9%) and 1.9% (from 74.8% to 72.9%) for each setting, which distinctly validates the effectiveness of the ESCM. To further validate the effectiveness of the proposed ESCM module, a comparison experiment was conducted against 3 baseline models [ref]5. Note that the experimental settings are identical to the baseline model accordingly, and we simply add our ESCM module to the very end of each baseline model. As shown in Table IV, our ESCM module (denoted as “AVEL w/ ESCM”) surpasses PSP module [ref]5 (denoted as “AVEL w/ PSP”) by 0.9% in the fully-supervised setting and achieves the same accuracy (72.9%) in the weakly-supervised setting. Moreover, our proposed ESCM module can bring further improvements to the recent SOTAs PSP-Net[ref]5 and CMBS, as seen in Rows 4-7. The results prove two points. First, our proposed ESCM module is superior to the baseline PSP module (from 76.6% to 77.5%). Second, our proposed ESCM module can bring further significant accuracy improvements upon AVEL (4.8% and 6.2%, respectively), PSP-Net[ref]5 (2.2% and 0.9%, respectively), and CMBS (0.4% and 0.1%, respectively). We notice that the improvement upon CMBS is limited. The reasons may be that 1) CMBS diverges notably from the common pipeline, particularly under weakly-supervised conditions, necessitating some design adjustments to fully unleash the potential of ESCM. 2) Some issues in the dataset also affect the upper bound of the model performance, see II.B. Issues of Temporal Boundaries in the Supplemental Material. These results suggest that our proposed plug-and-play module can benefit multiple AVE localization approaches, as none of them take into account video-level semantics. The effectiveness of the ISCE. As shown in Table III, we validate the effectiveness of the ISCE module, which utilizes video-level AVE representation to enhance the semantic consistency of segment sequences. Thus, we remove the utilization of video-level AVE representation, i.e., use zero-initialized GRUs to model the temporal dynamics of each modality, denoted as “w/o ISCE”. The accuracy of “w/o ISCE” drops by 3.3% in the fully-supervised setting and 2.9% in the weakly-supervised setting compared to our model. Table III shows that utilizing video-level semantics, e.g., “ISCE w/ 𝐴𝑣𝑔𝐴𝑣𝑔\\it{Avg}” and “ISCE w/ 𝑀𝑎𝑥𝑀𝑎𝑥\\it{Max}”, is higher than that of models without it (“w/o ISCE”) by a large margin. In addition, “ISCE w/ 𝐴𝑣𝑔𝐴𝑣𝑔\\it{Avg}”, “ISCE w/ 𝑀𝑎𝑥𝑀𝑎𝑥\\it{Max}” and our “ISCE w/ CERE” all achieved higher or competitive accuracy than “w/o ESCM”. The lowest accuracies of 76.4% and 71.9% are achieved by “w/o ISCE”, which are even 1.5% and 1.0% lower than removing the entire ESCM module (denoted as “w/o ESCM”). The result indicates that simply deepening the temporal modeling of video features is not only useless but also hurts the performance of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that GRUs initialized with event representations related to the input sequence features tend to have better performance. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed ISCE module, which leverages video-level semantics as prior knowledge to guide the network to enhance the semantic consistency within each modality. The necessity of the CERE. Analogously, we validate the effectiveness of CERE by substitution and deformation. The overall model’s performance decreases after the change. For the CERE module, the core lies in the representation of video-level events, i.e., video-level semantics. Thus, we initialize the ISCE in four ways corresponding to four ways of obtaining video-level event representations 𝑬a​vsuperscript𝑬𝑎𝑣\\boldsymbol{E}^{av}. Specifically, we attempt to obtain 𝑬a​vsuperscript𝑬𝑎𝑣\\boldsymbol{E}^{av} by performing average pooling (denoted as “ISCE w/ 𝐴𝑣𝑔𝐴𝑣𝑔\\it{Avg}”) and max pooling (denoted as “ISCE w/ 𝑀𝑎𝑥𝑀𝑎𝑥\\it{Max}”) on segment-level encoded video features {𝑨s​e​g,𝑽s​e​g}superscript𝑨𝑠𝑒𝑔superscript𝑽𝑠𝑒𝑔\\{\\boldsymbol{A}^{seg},\\boldsymbol{V}^{seg}\\}. “ISCE w/ 𝑀𝑎𝑥𝑀𝑎𝑥\\it{Max}” achieved the second-best accuracy of 78.2% and 73.4% after our full model (“ISCE w/ CERE”), surpassing “w/o ESCM” by 0.3% and 0.5%, respectively. “ISCE w/ Max” is similar to our idea of capturing salient features as video-level AVE representations, which tend to have more discriminative semantics than unimodal segments. In particular, the video-level event representation extracted by our proposed parameter-shared CERE module (“ISCE w/ CERE”) achieves the highest accuracy of 79.7% and 74.8% compared to “ISCE w/ 𝐴𝑣𝑔𝐴𝑣𝑔\\it{Avg}” and “ISCE w/ 𝑀𝑎𝑥𝑀𝑎𝑥\\it{Max}”, respectively. These results validate the superiority and effectiveness of our proposed CERE module for video-level event representation extraction. In addition, we use the common CNN blocks in the CERE module for the visual and audio branches, i.e., sharing parameters. To validate the shared CERE, we compare ours with the CERE of the visual and audio branches using different CNN blocks (denoted as “ISCE w/ non-shared CERE”), which increases the number of parameters in the model. As shown in Table III, the performance after CERE deformation exceeds “w/o ISCE” but surprisingly decreases by 2.5% and 2.0% compared to ours in fully- and weakly-supervised settings, respectively. This suggests that CERE may be influenced by background information in unimodality. Our proposed parameter-shared CERE effectively avoids capturing background representations, as it considers information from both modalities simultaneously. These results validate that our proposed parameter-shared CERE ensures the cross-modal complementarity and synchronization of the extracted video-level event representations from the visual and audio modalities. Benefit of the negative pair filter loss ℒf​u​l​l​ysubscriptℒ𝑓𝑢𝑙𝑙𝑦\\mathcal{L}_{fully} and the smooth loss ℒw​e​a​ksubscriptℒ𝑤𝑒𝑎𝑘\\mathcal{L}_{weak}. In the fully-supervised setting, we adopt ℒc+ℒtsubscriptℒ𝑐subscriptℒ𝑡\\mathcal{L}_{c}+\\mathcal{L}_{t}, ℒc​e+λ​ℒa​v​p​ssubscriptℒ𝑐𝑒𝜆subscriptℒ𝑎𝑣𝑝𝑠\\mathcal{L}_{ce}+\\lambda\\mathcal{L}_{avps} [ref]5 and ℒf​u​l​l​y=ℒc+ℒt+ℒa​v​p​ssubscriptℒ𝑓𝑢𝑙𝑙𝑦subscriptℒ𝑐subscriptℒ𝑡subscriptℒ𝑎𝑣𝑝𝑠\\mathcal{L}_{fully}=\\mathcal{L}_{c}+\\mathcal{L}_{t}+\\mathcal{L}_{avps} as the objective function to train the model, respectively. Here, ℒc​esubscriptℒ𝑐𝑒\\mathcal{L}_{ce} denotes the cross-entropy between the output (the predicted 29 categories, including background) of the model and the label provided by the dataset. λ𝜆\\lambda is a balanced factor that is set to 100 according to [ref]5. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed losses, as presented in Table V, we use our VSCG network and the currently popular PSP network as baselines. In the fully-supervised setting, the results show that the negative pair filter loss ℒf​u​l​l​ysubscriptℒ𝑓𝑢𝑙𝑙𝑦\\mathcal{L}_{fully} improves the accuracy compared to the previous two loss functions. Particularly compared with the loss in [ref]5, the improvement brought by ℒf​u​l​l​ysubscriptℒ𝑓𝑢𝑙𝑙𝑦\\mathcal{L}_{fully} is 0.9% for both VSCG and PSP. These results validate the effectiveness of the negative pair filter loss ℒf​u​l​l​ysubscriptℒ𝑓𝑢𝑙𝑙𝑦\\mathcal{L}_{fully}, where ℒtsubscriptℒ𝑡\\mathcal{L}_{t} and ℒa​v​p​ssubscriptℒ𝑎𝑣𝑝𝑠\\mathcal{L}_{avps} work together as an auxiliary restriction to better distinguish between background segments and segments containing AVEs. Specifically, ℒa​v​p​ssubscriptℒ𝑎𝑣𝑝𝑠\\mathcal{L}_{avps} increases the similarity between audio and visual modalities of segments containing AVEs, while ℒtsubscriptℒ𝑡\\mathcal{L}_{t} decreases the probability score when a segment contains no AVEs. For the weakly-supervised setting, we respectively adopt ℒb​c​esubscriptℒ𝑏𝑐𝑒\\mathcal{L}_{bce} and the smooth loss ℒw​e​a​k=2​ℒb​c​e+ℒs−b​c​esubscriptℒ𝑤𝑒𝑎𝑘2subscriptℒ𝑏𝑐𝑒subscriptℒ𝑠𝑏𝑐𝑒\\mathcal{L}_{weak}=2\\mathcal{L}_{bce}+\\mathcal{L}_{s-bce} as the objective function for model training. As shown in Table V, the smooth loss significantly improved the accuracy of VSCG by 1.0%, while the improvement of PSP was faint. This implies a better exploitation of the smoothing loss effect due to the presence of the ESCM module, which obtained more discriminative video features.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: setting, which distinctly validates the effectiveness of the ESCM.
