      "content": "Paper Title: Energy-based Latent Aligner for Incremental Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe augment three popular class-incremental learning methods: iCaRL [ref]41, LUCIR  and AANet [ref]31 with our proposed latent aligner. Table 1 showcases the results on CIFAR-100  and ImageNet subset [ref]41 datasets. As explained earlier, we conduct experiments on the setting where half of the classes are learned in the first task, and when all tasks has equal number of classes. In the former, we group 101010, 555 and 222 classes each to create 555, 101010 and 252525 learning tasks respectively, after training the model on 505050 initial classes. In the second setting, we group 202020, 101010 and 555 classes each to create 555, 101010 and 202020 incremental tasks.\nWe see consistent improvement across all these settings when we add ELI to the corresponding base methodology. In both the settings, the improvement is more pronounced on harder datasets.\nLUCIR  and AANet [ref]31 use an explicit latent space regularizer in their methodology. ELI is able to improve them further. Simpler methods like iCaRL [ref]41 benefit more from the implicit regularization that ELI offers (this aspect is explored further in Sec. 5). In Fig. 4, we plot the average accuracy after learning each task in 555 task, 101010 task and 252525 task\nsettings on ImageNet 1k. We see a similar trend, but with larger improvements on this harder dataset. When added to iCaRL [ref]41, LUCIR  and AANet [ref]31, ELI provides 8.17%percent8.178.17\\%, 3.05%percent3.053.05\\% and 2.53%percent2.532.53\\% improvement on average in ImageNet 1k experiments, respectively. When we consider adding same number of classes in each incremental task, simple logit distillation provided by iCaRL [ref]41, along with our proposed latent aligner outperforms complicated methods by a significant margin. This is because the feature learning that happens with half of the classes in the first task, is a major prerequisite for good performance of approaches like LUCIR  and AANet [ref]31.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: We augment three popular class-incremental learning methods: iCaRL [ref]41, LUCIR  and AANet [ref]31 with our proposed latent aligner.
