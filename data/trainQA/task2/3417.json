      "content": "Paper Title: Data Heterogeneity-Robust Federated Learning via Group Client Selection in Industrial IoT\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has played an increasingly integral role in the industrial community. Taking logistics sorting and automatic object identification as examples. Optical character recognition (OCR) cameras on logistics pipelines detect and read characters on packing boxes in order to sort them. At the same time, the surrounding surveillance cameras are constantly monitoring, automatically identifying objects through optical recognition of the characters on their badges, and confirming whether the machines, robots, vehicles, and workers in the factory are legal entrants. These optical sensors collect a huge amount of industrial data. In order to tap the value of these data, advanced data mining technologies are needed, especially machine learning (ML). However, gathering the industrial big data to the cloud leads to unbearable transmission overhead, and also violates data privacy regulations. Taking the idea of task offloading, federated learning (FL) sinks model training from the cloud to the edge. OCR cameras use local optical data to train local OCR models, then upload their local model updates to the cloud to update the global model. The global model is then synchronized to OCR cameras. These steps are repeated until the global model converges. In this way, FL preserves data confidentiality because the raw data does not leave the devices. The combination of industrial IoT (IIoT) and FL opens a door for smart industry [ref]5 . FL provides powerful privacy-preserving tools for mining decentralized industrial data, and IIoT technologies such as smart sensors and mobile robots provide rich resources (e.g., data, computation) for FL. Despite these benefits, compared with OCR in natural scenes, FL in industries requires higher accuracy to ensure the reliability of industrial operations. However, sensors’ local data distributions can be highly heterogeneous due to differences in times, locations, functions, and so on. Taking the logistics industry of cross-border e-commerce as an example, the Singapore warehouse transports more packing boxes to Singapore than other countries, so the optical characters in the word “Singapore” appear more times than other characters. For this reason, the number of optical images of each character captured by different OCR cameras (in different warehouses) is skewed and inconsistent. Other examples are device failure detection and object detection, which also prove the existence of data heterogeneity in real-world IIoT. These skewed distributed data are called non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) and can lead to FL performance degradation[ref]9, which becomes more challenging when local data of sensors are constantly changing. The non-i.i.d. data challenge has inspired the research field of heterogeneous FL, especially the field of mobile edge computing (MEC)[ref]5 0 2 3 1 4 5 6 7 8 9, which currently remains open. These kinds of literature have achieved great success in the context of MEC, but the following characteristics of IIoT make them still limited: Higher requirements for data security. Industries (e.g., manufacturing, logistics, and transportation) often face even more serious data threats due to owning a vast amount of valuable information, so they possess the most urgent and critical requirement to increase security to protect data. Therefore, any form of disclosure0 1 2 3 or tampering4 5 6 of the confidential raw data is not allowed. Rapidly changing streaming data on data-intensive sensors. Data-intensive IIoT sensors such as OCR cameras require high sampling rates to capture the real-time phenomenon information and produce large amounts of data. In order to save storage space, these data will overwrite the old data that has been processed, forming a data stream similar to a first-in-first-out (FIFO) data queue. In such a dynamic environment, static approaches no longer work for IIoT, for example, 7, and the K-Center clustering algorithm in 8. Natural geographical clustering property. In modern industrial parks, IIoT devices in each factory are geographically adjacent, which makes them naturally clustered into groups and interconnected by highly reliable networks, for example, through regional 5G base stations (see Fig. 1). However, this valuable property is often ignored, and the rich communication resources at the edge are not fully utilized2 9 0, which limits the improvement of industrial FL. The above characteristics distinguish “FL in IIoT” from “FL in non-IIoT” (e.g., FL in Edge). Few literature has been proposed to tackle the non-i.i.d. data challenge of FL in IIoT, such as approaches based on centroid distance weighted averaging, reinforcement learning1, and kmeans-based cohorts2. However, none of them take into account the changing local data distribution or the natural geographic clustering property of devices in IIoT. More importantly, they do not address the fundamental problem causing FL model performance to degrade, namely the divergence in class distributions[ref]9. To address the root cause of non-i.i.d. data, this paper aims to propose an effective approach to minimize the divergence in class distributions among heterogeneous devices. Taking advantage of the natural property of geographical clustering, we can select a subset of devices in each factory to construct “FL super nodes” with consistent class distributions. These super nodes can be treated as homogeneous clients participating in FL training, without exposing the confidential industrial FL process in risky data manipulation. However, designing such an approach is not trivial. Firstly, selecting a subset of devices in each group to minimize the class distribution divergence among groups is a 0-1 integer programming problem with vector weight constraints, which is proved to be NP-complete. More challenging, this procedure needs to be invoked frequently to adapt to rapidly changing local data and the mobility of mobile IIoT devices (e.g., robots, drones), which places high demands on execution latency. Secondly, even if class distributions among FL super nodes are forced to be homogeneous, devices’ local data in each FL super node can still be skewed. If not handled properly, these challenges will still degrade FL model performance. To minimize the data heterogeneity among groups and realize efficient client selection, this paper proposes a novel gradient-based binary permutation optimizer GBP-CS to solve the above NP-complete client selection problem. GBP-CS runs a constraint-preserving gradient descent optimization procedure directly in the 0-1 integer space, and can build homogeneous FL super nodes in a very short time. Then, we propose Federated Group Synchronization (FedGS), which is a hierarchical cloud-edge-end FL framework for 5G empowered modern industries, to improve industrial FL performance on non-i.i.d. data. FedGS uses a compound-step synchronization protocol to train ML models, which can suppress data heterogeneity within and among FL super nodes. More specifically, FedGS uses a single-step synchronization protocol (e.g., SSGD3) within super nodes because of its robustness against data heterogeneity, and a multi-step synchronization protocol (e.g., FedAvg4) among homogeneous super nodes to reduce communication overhead. Theoretical analysis shows that FedGS has both the convergence upper bound and optimality gap better than FedAvg in the presence of non-i.i.d. data, and can be more time-efficient under a relaxed condition. Finally, we evaluate FedGS on the most widely adopted non-i.i.d. benchmark dataset FEMNIST5, and compare it with 10 advanced approaches, including FedAvg, FedMMD6, FedFusion7, FedProx8, IDA9, CGAU0, FedAvgM1, and FedAdagrad, FedAdam, FedYogi from 2. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows. We propose a hierarchical cloud-edge-end FL framework FedGS for 5G empowered modern industries, which uses a novel compound-step synchronization protocol to coordinate the training process within and among groups. The new protocol is robust against data heterogeneity and can effectively improve industrial FL performance. We propose a novel GBP-CS algorithm to select a subset of devices from each group to build homogeneous FL super nodes, which can find a desirable selection strategy in a very short time. GBP-CS is a general optimizer for constrained 0-1 integer programming problems and can be used for other practical cases such as game matching. We analyze the convergence rate and optimality gap of FedGS and give a relaxed condition under which FedGS is more time-efficient than FedAvg. Theoretical results show that FedGS not only converges closer to the optimal, but also faster. Extensive experiments compared to 10 advanced approaches show that FedGS improves FL accuracy by 3.5% and reduces training rounds by 59% on average. The results highlight the superior effectiveness and efficiency of FedGS on non-i.i.d. data.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: model converges.
