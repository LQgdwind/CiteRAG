Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

Much deeper mathematical coverage can be\nfound in a number of ‘classic’ texts   . As many of the ideas discussed in this paper are motivated by the mathematical physics of\ngauge field theories, the interested reader can find fundamentals explained in the survey paper , and text . The theory of fibre\nbundles is founded on the idea of a differential manifold; further interested readers may refer to . Less\nbackground is provided on manifolds because they do appear more regularly in the SHM literature; this is because they appear at the interface of dynamics and\nmachine learning. Interesting discussions in terms of (nonlinear) dynamics can be found in , based on foundational work in   .\nIn the context of machine learning, the class of algorithms termed manifold learning [ref]18 have proved powerful, particularly in terms of data\nvisualisation .\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: Interesting discussions in terms of (nonlinear) dynamics can be found in , based on foundational work in   .\nIn the context of machine learning, the class of algorithms termed manifold learning [ref]18 have proved powerful, particularly in terms of data\nvisualisation .\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
