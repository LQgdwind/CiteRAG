      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Low-Resolution Face Recognition via Bridge Distillation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, deep learning approaches have motivated many strong face recognition models, e.g.[ref]22 [ref]23   [ref]5. However, the performance of these models may drop sharply if applied to low-resolution faces. An important reason is that the high-resolution facial details will be missing during the degeneration of the resolution, which the existing models largely depend on. To address this problem, several recent works propose to adopt two ideas to handle low-resolution recognition: hallucination and embedding, which reconstructs the high-resolution details explicitly or implicitly during inference. In the hallucination category, high-resolution facial details are explicitly inferred and then utilized in the recognition process. For example, Kolouri et al. proposed to fit the low-resolution faces to a non-linear Lagrangian model, which explicitly considers high-resolution facial appearance. Jian et al. and Yang et al. instead adopted SVD and sparse representation to jointly performing face hallucination and recognition. Several works   were able to generate highly realistic high-resolution face images from low-resolution input. Cheng et al. introduced a complement super-\nresolution and identity joint deep learning method with a unified end-to-end network architecture to address low-resolution face recognition. Although hallucination is a direct way to address low-resolution face recognition, it is usually computationally intensive as it introduces face reconstruction as a necessary pipeline. Li et al. introduced a GAN pre-training approach and fully convolutional architecture to improve face re-identification and employed supervised discriminative learning to explore low-resolution face identification. Recent face recognition models proposed designing effective loss functions [ref]23 [ref]5     for feature learning, that can facilitate the hallucination-based approaches. In contrary, the embedding category implicitly encodes high-resolution features in low-resolution computation to avoid high-resolution reconstruction. This inspires several embedding-based approaches, which project both high-resolution and low-resolution faces into a unified feature space so that they can be directly matched   . This paradigm can be implemented by jointly transforming the features of high-resolution and low-resolution faces into a unified space using multidimensional scaling , joint sparse coding  or cross-resolution feature extraction and fusion  . Recently, deep learning were adopted for low-resolution face recognition in  and . However, most of these works focus on joint high- and low-resolution training, while the distillation of high-resolution models for low-resolution tasks is still an open problem. From these works, we find transferring the knowledge from high-resolution to low-resolution models is helpful and can avoid the computationally-intensive face reconstruction. Thus, we need to actually solve two subproblems: what knowledge should be transferred from the high-resolution models and how to perform such transfer. Therefore, we also briefly review knowledge distillation studies.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: Recently, deep learning approaches have motivated many strong face recognition models, e.g.[ref]22 [ref]23   [ref]5.
