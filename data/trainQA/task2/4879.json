      "content": "Paper Title: Augmentation-Free Graph Contrastive Learning of Invariant-Discriminative Representations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph contrastive learning. Inspired by the great success of contrastive learning in computer vision, many works have recently made significant progress in adapting it to graphs. With regard to structure, graph contrastive learning (GCL) develops cross-scale and same-scale contrastive learning. The typical cross-scale GCL is DGI . Following the idea of Deep InfoMax , DGI attempts to train itself by maximizing the mutual information between local patch (node-level) representations and high-level global (graph-level) representations, capturing globally relevant information and avoiding overemphasis on proximity. HDGI  and ConCH  further generalize DGI to heterogeneous graphs by aggregating node representations based on different types of edges. MVGRL  also takes cross-scale contrastive learning and introduces two graph diffusion approaches to generate similar semantic samples. In addition, some works use same-scale contrastive learning. Inspired by SimCLR [ref]3, GRACE [ref]5 constructs two augmented views by randomly removing edge and mask node features. Then, GRACE learns the informative representations by reducing the distance between node representations of two views and pushing away other node representations. Since uniformly removing edges and shuffling features may lead to suboptimal augmentation, GCA  improved GRACE by using an adaptable augmentation technique. To address the problem of negative sample sampling, BGRL  avoids negative samples by adopting a network architecture similar to BYOL 9. CCA-SSG [ref]6 proposes a loss function based on canonical correlation analysis, which ensures that it no longer requires the parameterized mutual information estimator, additional projector, asymmetric structures, and negative samples. AFGRL  devolops an augmentation-free GCL method. AFGRL utilizes the nodes that share local structural information and global semantic information for target nodes as positive samples. iGCL differs from AFGRL in three ways: 1. the ID loss differs from the loss of AFGRL, 2. iGCL generates positive samples in a more efficient way than AFGRL without losing performance, and 3. iGCL can be applied to large-scale graphs with the help of neighbor sampling, while AFGRL needs to load entire graphs into memory. Data augmentation on graphs. In computer vision, SimCLR [ref]3 states that the composition of data augmentations plays a critical role in contrastive learning. GraphCL  empirically illustrates that data augmentation is also crucial for GCL and that the compositions of different augmentation methods are beneficial for improving performance through extensive experiments. Liu et al.  systematically categorized the data augmentation on graphs into node feature masking, node feature shuffle, edge modification, graph diffusion, and subgraph sampling. For example, GRACE [ref]5 and CCA-SSG [ref]6 generate positive samples by randomly masking node features and removing edges. However, GraphCL indicates that different types of graphs are suitable for different kinds of data augmentation. The choice of data augmentation for a given task relies heavily on trial and error, which is certainly time-consuming and computationally resource-intensive. Meanwhile, the hyperparameters of data augmentations exponentially expand the search space. We try to generate positive samples based on the intrinsic signal of graphs instead of empirical data augmentation.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: cross-scale contrastive learning and introduces two graph diffusion approaches to generate similar semantic samples.
