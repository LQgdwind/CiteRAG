Because critical curve features such as curve length, distance-to-collision, and maximum curvature/velocity/acceleration can be analytically determined only for low-order (e.g., linear and quadratic) polynomial curves and are numerically computed or inexactly approximated using discrete samples for higher-order polynomials, as summarized in Table I. In this paper, we propose a new computationally efficient approach for adaptive approximation of high-order B√©zier curves by multiple low-order B√©zier segments at any desired level of accuracy specified in terms of a B√©zier metric, as illustrated in Fig. 5.\nOur approach is based on an unexplored functional property of B√©zier curves in motion planning: distance between B√©zier curves can be measured analytically in terms of control points.\nAccordingly, we introduce a new analytic B√©zier metric, called the maximum control-point distance, that can be used to geometrically bound B√©zier curves with respect to each other, and defines tight upper bounds on other existing B√©zier metrics.\nWe also propose a new B√©zier degree reduction method, called parameterwise matching reduction, that allows preserving certain curve points (e.g., end points) while performing degree reduction.\nBased on the degree-one parameterwise matching reduction error, we conclude that an nthsuperscriptùëõthn^{\\text{th}}-order B√©zier curve can be accurately approximated by 3‚Äã(n‚àí1)3ùëõ13(n-1) quadratic and 6‚Äã(n‚àí1)6ùëõ16(n-1) linear B√©zier segments, which is a fundamental rule of thumb for B√©zier discretization.\nIn numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of approximating high-order B√©zier curves by linear and quadratic B√©zier segments for fast and accurate computation of common curve features used in motion planning.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: motion planning is essential for many autonomous robots.\nAs a parametric smooth motion representation, polynomial curves find significant applications in safe robot motion design from flying drones  [ref]2  [ref]4  to autonomous vehicles [ref]6    to robotic manipulators 0 1 2 3.\nPolynomials expressed in different (e.g., monomial, Taylor, and Bernstein) bases offer different useful functional\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
