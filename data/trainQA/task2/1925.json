      "content": "Paper Title: Move Schedules: Fast persistence computations in coarse dynamic settingsThis work was partially supported by the National Science Foundation through grants CCF-2006661 and CAREER award DMS-1943758.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGiven a triangulable topological space equipped with a tame continuous function, persistent homology captures the changes in topology across the sublevel sets of the space, and encodes them in a persistence diagram. The stability of persistence contends that if the function changes continuously, so too will the points on the persistence diagram  .\nThis motivates the application of persistence to time-varying settings, like that of dynamic metric spaces .\nAs persistence-related computations tend to exhibit high algorithmic complexity—essentially cubic111For finite fields, it is known that the persistence computation reduces to the PLU factorization problem, which takes O​(mω)𝑂superscript𝑚𝜔O(m^{\\omega}) where ω≈2.373𝜔2.373\\omega\\approx 2.373 is the matrix multiplication constant. in the size of the underlying filtration —their adoption to dynamic settings poses a challenging computational problem.\nCurrently, there is no recourse when faced with a time-varying complex containing millions of simplices across thousands of snapshots in time.\nAcquiring such a capability has far-reaching consequences: methods that vectorize persistence diagrams for machine learning purposes all immediately become computationally viable tools in the dynamic setting. Such persistence summaries include adaptive template functions , persistence images , and α𝛼\\alpha-smoothed Betti curves [ref]46. Cohen-Steiner et al. refer to a continuous 1-parameter family of persistence diagrams as a vineyard, and they give in  an efficient algorithm for their computation.\nThe vineyards approach can be interpreted as an extension of the reduction algorithm , which computes the persistence diagrams of a filtered simplicial complex K𝐾K with m𝑚m simplices in O​(m3)𝑂superscript𝑚3O(m^{3}) time, via a particular decomposition R=D​V𝑅𝐷𝑉R=DV (or R​U=D𝑅𝑈𝐷RU=D) of the boundary matrix D𝐷D of K𝐾K.\nThe vineyards algorithm, in turn, transforms a time-varying filtration into a certain set of permutations of the decomposition R=D​V𝑅𝐷𝑉R=DV, each of which takes at most O​(m)𝑂𝑚O(m) time to execute. If one is interested in understanding how the persistent homology of a continuous function changes over time, then this algorithm is sufficient, for homological critical points can only occur when the filtration order changes.\nMoreover, the vineyards algorithm is efficient asymptotically: if there are d𝑑d time-points where the filtration order changes, then vineyards takes O​(m3+m​d)𝑂superscript𝑚3𝑚𝑑O(m^{3}+md) time; one initial O​(m3)𝑂superscript𝑚3O(m^{3})-time reduction at time t0subscript𝑡0t_{0} followed by one O​(m)𝑂𝑚O(m) operation to update the decomposition at the remaining time points (t1,t2,…,td)subscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2…subscript𝑡𝑑(t_{1},t_{2},\\dots,t_{d}). When d>>mmuch-greater-than𝑑𝑚d>>m, the initial reduction cost is amortized by the cost of maintaining the decomposition, implying each diagram produced takes just linear time per time point to obtain. Despite its theoretical efficiency, vineyards is often not the method of choice in practical settings.\nWhile there is an increasingly rich ecosystem of software packages offering variations of the standard reduction algorithm (e.g. Ripser, PHAT, Dionysus, etc. see  for an overview), implementations of the vineyards algorithm are relatively uncommon.222Dionysus 1 does have an implementation of vineyards, however the algorithm was never ported to version 2. Other major packages, such as GUDHI and PHAT, do not have vineyards implementations.\nThe reason for this disparity is perhaps explained by Lesnick and Wright [ref]35: “While an update to an R​U𝑅𝑈RU decomposition involving few transpositions is very fast in practice… many transpositions can be quite slow… it is sometimes much faster to simply recompute the R​U𝑅𝑈RU-decomposition from scratch using the standard persistence algorithm.” Indeed, they observe that maintaining the decomposition along a certain parameterized family is the most computationally demanding aspect of RIVET , a software for computing two-parameter persistent homology. The work presented here seeks to further understand and remedy this discrepancy: building on the work presented in , we introduce a coarser approach to the vineyards algorithm.\nThough the vineyards algorithm is efficient at constructing a continuous 1-parameter family of diagrams, it is not necessarily efficient when the parameter is coarsely discretized.\nOur methodology is based on the observation that practitioners often don’t need (or want!) all the persistence diagrams generated by a continuous 1-parameter of filtrations; usually just n<<dmuch-less-than𝑛𝑑n<<d of them suffice.\nBy exploiting the “donor” concept introduced in , we are able to make a trade-off between the number of times the decomposition is restored to a valid state and the granularity of the decomposition repair step, reducing the total number of column operations needed to apply an arbitrary permutation to the filtration. This trade-off, paired with a fast greedy heuristic explained in section 3.4.2, yields an algorithm that can update a R=D​V𝑅𝐷𝑉R=DV decomposition more efficiently than vineyards in coarse time-varying contexts, making dynamic persistence more computationally tractable for a wider class of use-cases.\nBoth the source code containing the algorithm we propose and the experiments performed in Section 4 are available open source online.333For all accompanying software and materials, see: https://github.com/peekxc/move_schedules\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: all immediately become computationally viable tools in the dynamic setting.
