Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

The twin encoders are composed of five stacked layers with a fixed filter size of 3√ó3√ó33333\\times 3\\times 3 and [ref]30 [ref]30   [ref]30 [ref]30    feature map. Each layer starts with a 3D ASC and followed by 3D max-pooling. The 3D ASC operation is applied at different rates {1,6,12,18}161218\\{1,6,12,18\\} which yield to a larger receptive field of {[3√ó3√ó3],[9√ó9√ó9],[15√ó15√ó15],[18√ó18√ó18]}delimited-[]333delimited-[]999delimited-[]151515delimited-[]181818\\{[3\\times 3\\times 3],[9\\times 9\\times 9],[15\\times 15\\times 15],[18\\times 18\\times 18]\\} respectively. The obtained feature maps at different rates are concatenated along the channel axis and fed to the next layer. The final output of each of the two streams is 1√ó3√ó16√ó16√ó1201316161201\\times 3\\times 16\\times 16\\times 120, where 111 refer to the batch size, and in this study we process one patient at each iteration while the 333 refers to the sub-volume depth. A drop out layer is applied with a probability of 0.1. Bi-CLSTM Module. Each of the CLSTM is composed of 120 feature maps with tanh\\tanh activation function as it is bounded. Its convolutional filters are of size 3√ó3333\\times 3. The final output is of shape 1√ó3√ó16√ó16√ó1201316161201\\times 3\\times 16\\times 16\\times 120. A dropout layer is applied with a probability of 0.4. Decoder. It consists of five 3D up-convolutional layers. Each layer is composed of 3D transposed convolution and followed by refinement module for feature merging with the encoder EœÜsubscriptùê∏ùúëE_{\\varphi} features and then dropout is applied with a probability of 0.1. The final layer produces a two-channel maps ùíö^tsubscriptbold-^ùíöùë°\\bm{\\hat{y}}_{t} using 1√ó1√ó11111\\times 1\\times 1 convolution followed by pixel-wise softmax. Muscles Prediction. Due to memory limitations, each muscle is trained independently. Our architectures and modules are build upon: segmentation architecture¬†[ref]8, propagation architecture¬†, refinement module¬†, and fusion module¬†[ref]45. The 3D ASC dilation rates are defined to form atrous spatial pyramid pooling¬†. The Œ±ùõº\\alpha and Œ≤ùõΩ\\beta parameters of Tversky loss are learned adaptively. This leaves us only the two hyper-parameters for tuning over the validation set: the learning rate and the weight decay.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: 3D Siamese Encoder.
