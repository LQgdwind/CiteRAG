      "content": "Paper Title: Automatic Detection of COVID-19 Vaccine Misinformation with Graph Link Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are two schools of thought for detecting misinformation on social media, based on (1) the identification of whether a social media posting contains or not misinformation, sometime qualified as a rumour; or (2) taking into account known misconceptions and discovering those postings that propagate a certain misconception. Most of the work belongs to the first school of thought. Misinformation Detection as Rumour Identification on Social Media: Early work aiming the identification of social media postings that contain misinformation (without being interested in its misinformation target) focused on finding useful features for detecting misinformation, e.g. special characters, specific keywords\nand expression types, , ,  or the characteristics of users involved in spreading the misinformation,\ne.g. the number of followers, the users’ ages and\ngenders ; ,\nand the news’ propagation patterns , .\nMore recent work embraced several deep learning methods. These deep learning methods were informed by the textual content of the tweet containing the misinformation, capturing its semantics , or by encoding the content of the tweets responding to the misinformation . Moreover, a joint recurrent and convolutional network model (CRNN) was reported in , to better represent the profile of retweeters.\nOther deep learning-based methods for the identification of misinformation\nleveraged the propagation\nstructure in the social network.\n created\na kernel-based method that captures high-order\ninteractions differentiating different forms of misinformation while\n designed a tree-structured recursive\nneural network to learn the embedding of the rumor\npropagation structure. Another interesting deep learning framework, reported in , considered the prevalence of\ndeliberately promoted misinformation campaigns, which can be identified by relying on Generative Adversarial Networks. Most of these misinformation detection methods were influenced by the datasets on which they were developed. Several well-known benchmark datasets for misinformation detection on Twitter were used previously. For example, the\nTwitter15 [ref]15 and Twitter16  datasets consist of a collection of 1490, and 818 respectively, source tweets, along with their corresponding sequences of retweets and replies, forming propagation threads. There were a total of 331,612 propagation threads involving 276,663 users in Twitter15 and 204,820 propagation threads involving 173,487 users in Twitter16. The source tweets were all annotated in balanced sets (of 370 tweets in Twitter15 and 205 tweets in Twitter16) as true rumors, false rumors, unverified rumors or non-rumors. These combined datasets allowed several researchers to develop promising methods trained on the tweets labeled as true or false rumors, while modeling the not only the content of the tweets, but also the retweet/reply sequence\nof users, along with user profiles. For example, in [ref]16 a\ngraph-aware representation of user interactions was proposed for detecting\nthe correlations between the source tweet content and the retweet propagation though a dual co-attention mechanism. The same idea was explored on the same dataset in the dEFEND system . The PHEME dataset [ref]18 consists of Twitter conversation threads associated with 9 different newsworthy events such as the Ferguson unrest, the shooting\nat Charlie Hebdo, or Michael Essien contracting Ebola. A conversation thread consists of a tweet making a true and false claim, and a series of replies. There are 6,425 conversation threads in PHEME, while only 1,067 claims from tweets were annotated as true, 638 were annotated as false and 697 as unverified. A fraction of the PHEME dataset was used in the RumourEval task , having only 325 threads of conversations and 145 claims from tweets labeled as true, 74 as false and 106 as unverified. Misinformation detection methods operating both on PHEME and on the RumourEval data sets used either a sifted multi-task learning model\nwith a shared structure for misinformation and stance detection , Bayesian Deep Learning models \nor Deep Markov Random Fields .\nHowever, none of these benchmark datasets contain any misinformation about COVID-19 or the vaccines used to protect against it. Detection of Known COVID-19-Related Misinformation:\nVery recently, a new dataset of tweets containing misinformation about COVID-19, called COVIDLies was released .\nCOVIDLies is a dataset, which unlike previous datasets that considered\na large set of “popular” claims, which were later judged as true, false or unverifiable, was generated by starting with 86 known misconceptions about COVID-19, available from a Wikipedia article dedicated to misinformation about COVID-19. The misconceptions\ninformed the retrieval of 6761 related tweets from COVID-19-related tweets identified by Chen et al.\nThe retrieved tweets were further annotated by researchers from the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine with stance information, reflecting their judgement whether the\nauthor of the tweet agreed with a given misconception, rejected the misconception, or the tweet had no stance. Furthermore, COVIDLies enabled the design of a system that could identify misinformation and also infer its stance through a form of neural entailment, as reported in . We also used the COVIDLies dataset in recent work to infer automatically when misinformation about COVID-19 is rejected or adopted, by automatically discovering the stance of each tweet against the 86 available misconceptions, which were organized in a taxonomy of misconception themes and concerns. When using\na neural architecture that benefits from stacked Graph Attention\nNetworks (GATs) for lexico-syntactic, semantic and emotion information, we have obtained state-of-the-art results for stance detection on this dataset, as we report in . We were intrigued and inspired by the COVIDLies dataset, and believed that if we could create a similar dataset containing misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines, which would not only complement the COVIDLies data,\nbut it would also enable the development of novel techniques for misinformation detection. Therefore, in this paper we present the CoVaxLies dataset as well as a novel methodology of automatically detecting misinformation using it. We deliberately decided to generate the CoVaxLies dataset using a similar methodology as the one employed in the creation of the COVIDLies dataset, namely by starting with misconceptions or myths about the vaccines used to immunize against COVID-19 available on a Wikipedia article dedicated to them. But, we cast the misinformation detection problem differently. We still considered the retrieval phase essential for finding relevant tweets for the known vaccine myths, but we explored two different retrieval methods: one using the classic, BM25  scoring function, and the other using the same neural scoring method that was used in the creation of COVIDLies. This allowed us to discover that classical scoring functions outperform scoring functions using BERT-informed methods. We then focused on producing high-quality judgements for 7,246 tweets against 17 Misinformation Targets (MisTs) about COVID-19 vaccines of interest. Once the CoVaxLies dataset was generated, we were able to design a novel, simple and elegant method for discovering misinformation which was cast as learning to predict links in a\nMisinformation Knowledge Graph. Although our method for automatically detection misinformation in a collection of tweets uses deep learning techniques, as most of the recent approaches, it is the first method that\nrepresents misinformation as a knowledge graph, which can be projected in an embedding space through one of several possible knowledge embedding models.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: methods were influenced by the datasets on which they were developed.
