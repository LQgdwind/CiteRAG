      "content": "Paper Title: Benchmarking Parallelism in FaaS Platforms\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe recent popularity of serverless computing has triggered the appearance of several benchmarks tackling FaaS platforms.\nSince most services are offered as proprietary cloud platforms, these works explore them from a black-box perspective, and mostly from a high-level user point of view. Some papers and websites analyze the cold start of functions across platforms  6.\nInvocation latency and CPU performance are also extensively explored in literature  .\nRecently, new benchmarks  include the invocation throughput that platforms are able to provide and an evaluation of the invocation costs.\nConcurrency is also explored on different works 8   , but they only perform large-scale benchmarks from a high-level point of view.\nThe measurements on a recent paper  regarding the QoS of different platforms also show special emphasis on their concurrency and explore different issues with resource allocation and function scheduling. A very interesting topic in FaaS benchmarks is service elasticity    .\nHowever, their experiments do not evaluate computation parallelism and performance.\nThey generate a dynamic workload of many invocations to observe how the platform behaves when there are changes in the demand scale.\nThen, they analyze the capacity of each system to accept incoming requests rapidly.\nAlso, the workloads are usually IO-bound, like reactive web applications.\nIn this benchmark, we focus on compute-intensive workloads in parallel computing.\nThese applications need stronger guarantees on execution parallelism and resource isolation to achieve good performance, but this is not evaluated in literature benchmarks.\nIndeed, they do not differentiate between resolving invocations concurrently and actually handling them in parallel to provide the necessary performance.\nWe explore the behavior of each platform with deeper detail to determine these characteristics. Also, while the results of all these benchmark papers evidence performance variation across platforms, they usually disregard its causes and do not explore in detail the architecture of each platform for properties that affect performance.\nSome papers partially dig into the internals of platforms , but do not study its effects on parallelism.\nWe find extensive analysis of open-source FaaS platforms  , but such evaluations are not possible for the major platforms offered in public clouds. A few papers explore more complex applications.\nAn implementation of MapReduce  is evaluated for large computations on AWS Lambda following the observations of PyWren  and ExCamera .\ngg [ref]4 and Pocket 6 7 also perform several analysis of large computations atop this particular platform.\nThe platform proves a good fit for batch computations, but other platforms are not studied nor their design regarding parallelism.\nOther benchmarks perform their evaluation from an even higher level, and focus on orchestration tools atop FaaS 8 4.\nThey show that some platforms do not achieve good parallelism, but do not explore why in detail.\nA recent paper from Azure 9 offers some insights on how Azure Functions works and an analysis of the platform usage from the cloud provider perspective.\nHowever, it disregards function parallelism and focuses its exploration on optimizing latency in cold starts and reduce resource waste. None of the existing works investigates the architecture design of each FaaS platform, and how it affects their performance.\nEspecially for highly-parallel computations.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: clouds. A few papers explore more complex applications.\nAn implementation of MapReduce  is evaluated for large computations on AWS Lambda following the observations of PyWren  and ExCamera .\ngg [ref]4 and Pocket 6 7 also perform several analysis of large computations atop this particular platform.\nThe platform proves a good fit for batch computations, but other platforms are not studied nor\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
