      "content": "Paper Title: MulBot: Unsupervised Bot Detection Based on Multivariate Time Series\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are several works      based on features extraction and classic machine learning classifiers. The most famous supervised approach is Botometer , which is often used as ground truth for unsupervised methods. It exploits more than 1,200 features and evaluates users based on their profile information, social network, content, sentiment expressions and the timings of their actions. However, the generality and ease of deployment of this detector are counterbalanced by a reduced bot detection accuracy [ref]7 . In [ref]6, higher performance is reached with a model specialized in a single type of bot, developing a set of supervised machine learning classifiers to detect fake followers, quite easy to identify with respect to other more sophisticated bots.\nAttempting to address the evolving nature of the bots, in [ref]38 (2013) the authors developed a supervised classifier designed for detecting evolving bots, but yet in 2016, the proposed method was no longer successful at spotting a new wave of malicious accounts .\nIn  an attempt to solve the generalization issue is done. Inspired by , it trains an ensemble classifier, where each classifier is specialized in a type of bot. This solution only bypasses the problem, reaching a fake generalization. Indeed, a new classifier must be trained for each new type of bot, which is not an optimal solution. However, with the very similar , this is the only work where a multi-class classification is addressed. Actually, in both works, the task is transformed into a multiple binary classification problem through the use of an ensemble classifier, where each internal detector classifies between genuine users and a single type of bot. So, a real multi-class classification is still not addressed.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: network, content, sentiment expressions and the timings of their actions. However, the generality and ease of deployment of this detector are counterbalanced by a reduced bot detection accuracy [ref]7 . In [ref]6, higher performance is reached with a model specialized in a single type of bot, developing a set of supervised machine learning classifiers to detect fake followers, quite easy to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
