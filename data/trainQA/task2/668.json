      "content": "Paper Title: Combining Deep Reinforcement Learning and Search for Imperfect-Information Games\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe most prominent form of domain knowledge in our ReBeL poker agent is the simplification of the action space during self play so that there are at most 8 actions at each decision point. The bet sizes are hand-chosen based on conventional poker wisdom and are fixed fractions of the pot, though each bet size is perturbed by ±0.1×\\pm 0.1\\times pot during training to ensure diversity in the training data. We specifically chose not to leverage domain knowledge that has been widely used in previous poker AI agents: All prior top poker agents, including DeepStack , Libratus [ref]12, and Pluribus [ref]14, have used information abstraction to bucket similar infostates together based on domain-specific features   [ref]6. Even when computing an exact policy, such as during search or when solving a poker game in its entirety  , past agents have used lossless abstraction in which strategically identical infostates are bucketed together. For example, a flush of spades may be strategically identical to a flush of hearts. Our agent does not use any information abstraction, whether lossy or lossless. The agent computes a unique policy for each infostate. The agent’s input to its value and policy network is a probability distribution over pairs of cards for each player, as well as all public board cards, the amount of money in the pot relative to the stacks of the players, and a flag for whether a bet has occurred on this betting round yet. DeepStack trained its value network on random PBSs. In addition to reducing the dimensionality of its value network input by using information abstraction, DeepStack also sampled PBSs according to a handcrafted algorithm that would sample more realistic PBSs compared to sampling uniform random. We show in Section 8 that training on PBSs sampled uniformly randomly without information abstraction results in extremely poor performance in a value network. Our agent collects training data purely from self play without any additional heuristics guiding which PBSs are sampled, other than an exploration hyperparameter that was set to ϵ=0.25italic-ϵ0.25\\epsilon=0.25 in all experiments. In cases where both players bet all their chips before all board cards are revealed, past poker AIs compute the exact expected value of all possible remaining board card outcomes. This is expensive to do in real time on earlier rounds, so past agents pre-compute this expected value and look it up during training and testing. Using the exact expected value reduces variance and makes learning easier. Our agent does not use this shortcut. Instead, the agent learns these “all-in” expected values on its own. When both agents have bet all their chips, the game proceeds as normal except neither player is allowed to bet. The search space in DeepStack  extends to the start of the next betting round, except for the third betting round (out of four) where it instead extends to the end of the game. Searching to the end of the game on the third betting round was made tractable by using information abstraction on the fourth betting round (see above). Similarly, Libratus , Modicum , and Pluribus [ref]14 all search to the end of the game when on the third betting round. Searching to the end of the game has the major benefit of not requiring the value network to learn values for the end of the third betting round. Thus, instead of the game being three “levels” deep, it is only two levels deep. This reduces the potential for propogation of errors. Our agent always solves to the end of the current betting round, regardless of which round it is on. The depth-limited subgames in DeepStack extended to the start of the next betting round on the second betting round. On the first betting round, it extended to the end of the first betting round for most of training and to the start of the next betting round for the last several CFR iterations. Searching to the start of the next betting round was only tractable due to the abstractions mentioned previously and due to careful optimizations, such as implementing CFR on a GPU. Our agent always solves to the end of the current betting round regardless of which round it is on. We implement CFR only on a single-thread CPU and avoid any abstractions. Since a subgame starts at the beginning of a betting round and ends at the start of the next betting round, our agent must learn six “layers” of values (end of first round, start of second round, end of second round, start of third round, end of third round, start of fourth round) compared to three for DeepStack (end of first round, start of second round, start of third round). DeepStack used a separate value network for each of the three “layers” of values (end of first round, start of second round, start of third round). Our agent uses a single value network for all situations.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: in the training data.
