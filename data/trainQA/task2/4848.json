      "content": "Paper Title: A Mixture of Surprises for Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHumans can learn meaningful behaviors without external supervision, i.e., in an unsupervised manner, and then adapt those behaviors to new tasks [ref]3. Inspired by this, unsupervised reinforcement learning decomposes the reinforcement learning (RL) problem into a pretraining phase and a finetune phase [ref]32. During a pretraining phase, an agent prepares all possible tasks that a user might select. Afterward, the agent tries to figure out the selected task as quickly as possible during finetuning . Doing so allows solving the RL problem in a meaningful order [ref]3, e.g., a cook first has to look at what is in the fridge before deciding what to cook. Unsupervised representation learning has shown great success in computer vision  and natural language processing ; however, one challenge is that RL includes both behavior learning and representation learning [ref]32 . Current unsupervised RL methods provide an intrinsic reward to the agent during a pretraining phase to tackle the behavior learning problem [ref]32. Intuitively, this intrinsic reward should incentivize the agent to understand its environment . Current methods formulate the intrinsic reward as either maximizing or minimizing surprise [ref]45            , where knowledge-based methods quantify surprise as the uncertainty of a prediction model    and data-based methods measure surprise as an information-theoretic quantity [ref]45    Refer to [ref]32 for detailed definitions of data-based, knowledge-based and competence-based methods.. Surprise maximization methods    formulate the problem as an exploration problem. Intuitively, to prepare all possible downstream tasks, an agent has to explore the state space and figure out what is possible in the environment. For instance, one instantiation is to maximize the agent’s state entropy . In contrast to surprise maximization, another line of work takes inspiration from the free-energy principle    and proposes to minimize the surprise  [ref]45. In particular, these works argue that external perturbations naturally provide the agent with surprising events. Hence, an agent can learn meaningful behaviors by minimizing its surprise, and minimizing this quantity requires gaining control over these external perturbations [ref]45 . For example, SMiRL  proposed to minimize the agent’s state entropy. A closer look at these two approaches indicates a strong assumption. Substantial external perturbations already naturally provide an agent with a high state entropy . Therefore, surprise-seeking approaches assume that the environment does not provide significant external perturbations. On the other hand, in an environment without any external perturbations, the agent already achieves minimum entropy by not acting [ref]45. Therefore, surprise minimization approaches assume that the environment provides external perturbations for the agent to control. However, in real-world scenarios, it is often difficult to quantify the entropy of the environment’s dynamics beforehand, or the agent might face both settings. For example, a butler robot performs mundane chores daily in a household. However, the robot might also encounter surprising events (e.g., putting out a fire). Therefore a fixed assumption on the entropy of the environment dynamics is often not possible. In other words, choosing between surprise maximization or minimization for pretraining is a dilemma. Simultaneously optimizing these two opposite objectives does not make sense.\nInstead, in this paper, we show that competence-based methods [ref]32 offer a simple yet effective way to combine the benefits of these two objectives. In addition to conditioning the policy on the state, competence-based methods condition the policy on a latent vector       8. Conditioning the policy offers an appealing way to formulate the unsupervised RL problem. During a pretraining phase, the agent tries to learn a set of possible behaviors in the environment and distills them into skills. Then, during finetuning, the agent tries to figure out the selected task as quickly as possible, using the repertoire of skills gathered during pretraining. For example, as illustrated in Fig. 1, we view skill distributions as a mixture of policies instead of a single policy. In particular, we train one set of skills whose objective is to maximize the surprise and another set of skills whose objective is to minimize the surprise. Surprisingly, this paper shows that this simple approach works well in practice, which simultaneously optimizes two contradicting objectives. Our primary contribution, presented in Section 4, is a simple intrinsic reward called MOSS that does not make assumptions about the entropy of the environment’s dynamics. In Section 5, our experimental results on URLB [ref]32 and ViZDoom  show that, surprisingly, our MOSS methods achieve state-of-the-art results. We organize the paper as follows. Section 3 briefly analyzes previous unsupervised RL algorithms under the surprise framework. Then in Section 4, we introduce our MOSS method. Next, experimental results in Section 5 shows that on URLB [ref]32 and ViZDoom , our MOSS method improves upon previous pure maximization and minimization methods. Finally, we provide discussions and limitations in Section 6.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Humans can learn meaningful behaviors without external supervision, i.e., in an unsupervised manner, and then adapt those behaviors to new tasks [ref]3.
