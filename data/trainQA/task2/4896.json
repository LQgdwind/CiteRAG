      "content": "Paper Title: Improving GANs with a Feature Cycling Generator\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the training procedure of GANs , the generator G is trained to produce samples following the real data distribution Pd​a​t​a​(x)subscript𝑃𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎𝑥P_{data}(x) and the discriminator D is optimized to classify the generated real and generated samples. The objective functions of D and G are defined as where x indicates a sample from Pd​a​t​a​(x)subscript𝑃𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎𝑥P_{data}(x) and z means a latent vector sampled from latent space Pz​(z)subscript𝑃𝑧𝑧P_{z}(z) such as Gaussian normal distribution. Ideally, minimizing these formulas will arrive at an optimal solution where G can generate the entire real image and D can no longer differentiate the image source . Despite the ongoing research, however, the competition between G and D is still unstable since that competition is held in the high-dimensional feature space. Therefore, it is hard to observe the aforementioned ideal case where G synthesizes the target real samples perfectly. To alleviate this problem, extensive studies have been carried out. Some papers  [ref]22 [ref]8   noticed that the sharp gradient space in D makes GANs training unstable and proposed various regularization   [ref]21  and normalization techniques [ref]22 . More specifically, existing papers [ref]8     usually added the regularization term, such as the gradient penalty [ref]8   and R1subscript𝑅1R_{1} regularization [ref]21   , into their objective functions, which constrains the magnitude of the gradient space. On the other hand, some studies investigated the normalization strategy to constrain the Lipschitz constant in D around one. The spectral normalization (SN) [ref]22 is the most popular normalization technique and is still widely used in recent studies   . These regularization or normalization techniques provide an appealing synthesis result, but the instability problem still remains. In order to bring performance gain, some papers developed novel modules which can be easily applied to the existing D or G architectures          . Miyato et al.  introduced a conditional projection technique that effectively provides conditional information at the end of D. Yeo et al.  proposed a cascading rejection module that iteratively predicts the source of the input image using orthogonal features. Park et al.  introduced a perturbed convolution (PConv), which is designed to prevent the overfitting problem of D. Sagong et al.  developed conditional convolution, named cConv, which alters the convolutional kernel according to the given condition. Recently, Park et al.  proposed a latent-adaptive convolution technique called GConv, which varies the convolutional kernel according to the input latent vector. These methods simply added their modules to the baseline model without modifying the baseline model. Differently, this paper rebuilds the G architecture by stacking up the FCB.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: Therefore, it is hard to observe the aforementioned ideal case where G synthesizes the target real samples perfectly.
