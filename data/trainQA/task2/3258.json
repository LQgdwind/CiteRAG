Every finite collection of such random variables has a multivariate normal distribution in the Gaussian process. This Gaussian characteristic makes GP a versatile and amenable tool for numerical computations in science and engineering . An indispensable part of any GP regression is the task of matrix inversion and determinant computation, which are major numerical linear algebra tasks. To be precise, let 𝒟={(𝒙i,𝒚i)}i=1n𝒟superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝒙𝑖subscript𝒚𝑖𝑖1𝑛\\mathcal{D}=\\{(\\bm{x}_{i},\\bm{y}_{i})\\}_{i=1}^{n} be the training samples where 𝒙i∈ℝdsubscript𝒙𝑖superscriptℝ𝑑\\bm{x}_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d} and 𝒚i∈ℝsubscript𝒚𝑖ℝ\\bm{y}_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R} are the sampling sites (nodes) and the observational data, and 𝑨𝑨\\bm{A} a kernel matrix with entries [𝑨]i​j=k​(𝒙i,𝒙j,ℓ)subscriptdelimited-[]𝑨𝑖𝑗𝑘subscript𝒙𝑖subscript𝒙𝑗bold-ℓ[\\bm{A}]_{ij}=k(\\bm{x}_{i},\\bm{x}_{j},\\bm{\\ell}) where k​(𝒙i,𝒙j):ℝd×ℝd→ℝ:𝑘subscript𝒙𝑖subscript𝒙𝑗→superscriptℝ𝑑superscriptℝ𝑑ℝk(\\bm{x}_{i},\\bm{x}_{j}):\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} is the kernel function and ℓbold-ℓ\\bm{\\ell} is the vector of hyperparameters. Then, a typical objective function in GP is the log likelihood: where 𝑰𝑰\\bm{I} is the identity matrix, the fixed constant σnsubscript𝜎𝑛\\sigma_{n} represents the effect of noise in data. The goal in GP training is to maximize the objective function, i.e. log likelihood ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} to find the optimal hyperparameters ℓbold-ℓ\\bm{\\ell}. In addition to this well-known objective, the evidence lower bound denoted by ℒl​o​w​e​rsubscriptℒ𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟\\mathcal{L}_{lower} has also been universally considered in the context of variational Bayesian inference and more specifically in variational inference approaches for GP, e.g. sparse variational GP . In sparse approximations, typically a Nyström approximation of the kernel matrix with n𝑛n data points 𝑨n​nsubscript𝑨𝑛𝑛\\bm{A}_{nn} in the form of 𝑨^n​n=𝑨m​nT​𝑨m​m−1​𝑨n​msubscript^𝑨𝑛𝑛subscriptsuperscript𝑨𝑇𝑚𝑛subscriptsuperscript𝑨1𝑚𝑚subscript𝑨𝑛𝑚\\hat{\\bm{A}}_{nn}=\\bm{A}^{T}_{mn}\\bm{A}^{-1}_{mm}\\bm{A}_{nm} where m≪nmuch-less-than𝑚𝑛m\\ll n (hence sparse approximation) is considered . Both objective functions ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} and ℒl​o​w​e​rsubscriptℒ𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟\\mathcal{L}_{lower} involve linear system solves for computing the energy term i.e. 𝒚T​(𝑨+σn2​𝑰)−1​𝒚superscript𝒚𝑇superscript𝑨superscriptsubscript𝜎𝑛2𝑰1𝒚\\bm{y}^{T}(\\bm{A}+\\sigma_{n}^{2}\\bm{I})^{-1}\\bm{y} and log determinant computation. In particular, the challenge of GP regression is the 𝒪​(n2)𝒪superscript𝑛2\\mathcal{O}(n^{2}) storage and 𝒪​(n3)𝒪superscript𝑛3\\mathcal{O}(n^{3}) arithmetic operation complexity for inversion which can hamper its application for large n𝑛n. This issue is addressed to an extent in the sparse GP approaches , which show 𝒪​(n​m)𝒪𝑛𝑚\\mathcal{O}(nm) storage and 𝒪​(n​m2)𝒪𝑛superscript𝑚2\\mathcal{O}(nm^{2}) time complexity. However, the determination of m≪nmuch-less-than𝑚𝑛m\\ll n data points, referred to as induced points or landmark points in the GP literature, is not a trivial task and, itself, can be cast as a continuous optimization problem  or a discrete sampling problem (as a subset of original n𝑛n points)   in conjunction with the optimization of hyperparameters. In this paper, we develop a scalable GP regression approach by leveraging powerful tools/ideas in the rich field of numerical linear algebra  . The significant potential of using principled linear algebra approaches within the context of GP regression has also been the subject of much active research  1. Among many approaches we specifically adopt the hierarchical low-rank matrices   viewpoint that has been proven to be highly effective in reducing the computational complexity of large-scale problems. We pragmatically show that 1) the hierarchical decomposition of the matrix, 2) low-rank factorization of off-diagonal blocks via a randomized algorithm, and 3) performing low-rank updates via Sherman-Morrison-Woodburry (SMW) formula (similar to the Schur-complement formulation in the original ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}-matrix literature) collectively render a concrete pipeline for inversion of large-scale matrices which we further adapt for the task of GP training and regression. In what follows, we highlight notable aspects of our computational framework in comparison with a number of existing scalable GP approaches (typically involving Nyström low-rank approximation) and hierarchical matrix approaches (typically involving solution to finite element or finite difference discretization of elliptic partial differential equations). We also briefly discuss limitations associated with the current framework. Hierarchical decomposition: A limited number of research works have addressed scalable GP with hierarchical matrix decomposition  . In , the authors consider a similar problem but it appears that their hierarchical inversion procedure requires large matrix-matrix multiplications similar to original ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}-matrix works which results in 𝒪(nlog(n)2k2)\\mathcal{O}(n\\log(n)^{2}k^{2}) scalability. A GP regression approach for large data sets is presented in  where the hierarchy is assumed within a Bayesian inference context. Similar SMW computations are utilized for likelihood evaluation in their MCMC sampling. In contrast to the GP literature, the literature on hierarchical matrix approaches for solving sparse linear systems 𝑨​𝒙=𝒚𝑨𝒙𝒚\\bm{A}\\bm{x}=\\bm{y} associated with the discretization of elliptic PDEs such as Laplace’s equation is vast    2. The majority of research works in the context of sparse solvers incorporate geometric information. Geometric multigrid  [ref]10 and graph partitioning   approaches such as nested dissection  are among the well-established methods used within sparse solvers. Contrarily, the GP kernel matrices are often dense and constructed on an unstructured set of nodes. We are mainly interested in forming low-rank off-diagonal blocks for which we devise a new and simple data aggregation strategy inspired by (geometry-independent) algebraic multigrid  9. Low-rank approximation: Many scalable GP approaches leverage efficient Nyström approximation  or ensemble Nyström method  for low-rank factorization. These approaches are less systematic and potentially less accurate compared to the (randomized) linear algebra procedures that we consider in this paper (See Section 5.1). An example of incorporating randomized SVD into GP computation (however in a different setting than matrix inversion) is in . Another conceptually hierarchical approach for GP is considered in 1 where the authors perform incomplete Cholesky factorization using maximin elimination ordering for invoking a sparsity pattern. We emphasize that the application of randomized algorithms for low-rank approximation in hierarchical matrices is not new ; however, the successful application and error estimation of such approaches in the matrix-free hierarchical inversion of dense matrices is less common. For example, the authors in  consider forward computation for hierarchical matrices with a randomized algorithm. The construction is based on the simplifying assumption that the matrix-vector multiplication in their randomized SVD approach is fast. We eliminate this assumption and demonstrate a successful subsampling approach for fast computation of the randomized range finder that yields the overall desirable scalability 𝒪​(n​log⁡(n)​k)𝒪𝑛𝑛𝑘\\mathcal{O}(n\\log(n)k). Optimization of parameterized hierarchical matrices:\nThe gradient-based optimization with parameterized hierarchical matrices has not been the central focus of the linear algebra community. However, gradient computation is a vital part of many machine learning procedures, including GP. The authors in  consider a similar GP problem and discuss an approach for HODLR matrices  (HODLR: hierarchical off-diagonal low-rank, similar to our hierarchical construction); however, the low-rank factorization is based on Nyström approximation and the hierarchical gradient computation is not apparent from the formulation. In this paper, we provide concrete algorithmic steps for computing the log likelihood gradient (with respect to hyperparameters ℓbold-ℓ\\bm{\\ell}) in a generic hierarchical setting.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: the discretization of elliptic PDEs such as Laplace’s equation is vast    2.
