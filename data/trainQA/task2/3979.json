      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Embedded Clustering with Distribution Consistency Preservation for Attributed Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMany real-world systems can be modeled as networks, such as social networks, academic citation networks, and protein-protein interaction networks, where nodes denote objects and links denote pairs of relations between nodes.\nIn addition to node connectivity information, nodes are often associated with attributes characterizing their own properties. Both kinds of information can implicitly reflect and affect the structures of networks. We generally call this kind of networks ‚Äúattributed networks‚Äù. For example, an academic citation network can be viewed as a representative attributed network. Each paper is a node of the network, and the citation relationship between a pair of papers constitutes edges in the network. The attributes of each paper are usually a bag-of-words characterizing the paper.\nIn recent years, there are more and more researches on attributed networks analysis, such as node classification, node clustering, and even recommendation [ref]1 [ref]2 . As the saying goes, ‚ÄòBirds of a feather flock together‚Äô, therefore, clusters are important components in these attributed networks.\nIn general, clustering aims to partition nodes in networks into disjoint clusters. In this way, nodes in the same cluster are not only more densely connected than nodes outside the cluster, but also the attribute similarity of a pair of nodes in the cluster is greater than that of a node pair in different clusters.\nTherefore, identifying these clusters is an effective means to understand the underlying functions of systems that attributed networks represent. Clustering has been studied extensively in data mining and machine learning fields over the past decades.\nFurthermore, with the development of deep learning in recent years, many deep models    have been developed to promote the capacities of traditional clustering methods via neural networks. Since deep learning models [ref]2  have the advantage of leveraging high-dimensional nonlinear features and high-relational features from nodes, they are becoming more and more resilient to high sparsity networks and attract considerable attention for node clustering, especially for large-scale networks. The existing deep models for attributed network clustering can be roughly divided into two categories. The first one utilizes a network embedding method to obtain low-dimensional representation vectors with deep learning techniques   , then adopts a typical clustering method, such as KùêæK-means  or spectral clustering , to obtain node clusters.\nWe call this kind of methods ‚Äútwo-stage methods‚Äù.\nHowever, they highly depend on the representation learning ability of deep models, and the learned representation may not be good for the task of node clustering, although they can also be directly used for other downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction  . In contrast, the second class of deep embedded clustering (DEC) methods directly integrate the objectives of clustering and representation learning into a unified framework [ref]2 [ref]13 .\nWe call this kind of methods ‚Äúone-stage methods‚Äù. Through joint optimization, DEC models are able to simultaneously learn node representations and the corresponding cluster structure, thereby gaining benefits and promoting each other.\nThe existing studies indicate that one-stage end-to-end methods for node clustering are better than two-stage methods [ref]2 [ref]13. Recently, various DEC models    have been developed and arouse a lot of interest among researchers. However, most of the existing DEC models are designed to process image data, which can not be used to process attributed networks directly. Moreover, a given image dataset can be transformed into an attributed network by constructing a kùëòkNN (kùëòk-nearest neighbor) graph for obtaining global structure information, while keeping the image features as node attributes. Thus, it is necessary to further develop DEC models to capture cluster structure implied in network topology and node attributes while obtaining node representations for an attributed network. Since graph convolutional networks (GCN) provide a way to combine link structures and node features smoothly [ref]1, some recent DEC models employ GCN as the backbone to make up for the deficiency of the previous methods that ignore topology information and achieve better clustering performance for attributed networks [ref]2 [ref]13  .\nDAEGC [ref]2 utilizes graph attention network (GAT)  to form an autoencoder deep clustering framework, but lacks the reconstruction of node attributes which is a useful technique in self-supervised learning. SDCN [ref]13 fuses autoencoder and GCN to learn node representations and hidden cluster distributions in a self-supervised way. However, it ignores to reconstruct the network topology.\nWe believe that reconstructing the original network (including both topology and node attributes) will be good for learning node representations.\nMeanwhile, it is worth investigating how to project the hidden vectors learned by the network into cluster distributions and maintain the actual cluster structure.\nCorresponding to the consistency of multi-view clustering, the cluster structure of network topology and that of node attributes should be consistent for an attributed network. We suggest that the consistency constraint of cluster distributions obtained in the DEC process from different views is more robust than (or can be the substitute for) fusing two representation vectors before clustering. Based on these observations, in this study, we propose an end-to-end deep embedded clustering model named DCP-DEC (Distribution Consistency Preserving Deep Embedded Clustering) for attributed networks.\nThis model aims at utilizing network structure and node attributes to learn more comprehensive node representations and simultaneously achieve better clustering performance.\nIn the DCP-DEC model, we reconstruct a given network with a graph autoencoder (GAE) model where the backbone is still GCN. We keep DNN autoencoder in [ref]13 to encode and decode node attributes.\nOnce we obtain the node representation vectors from the above two autoencoders, we use them to obtain soft cluster assignments. Meanwhile, the KL-based clustering losses are then formed from two views in the means of self-supervised deep embedded clustering mechanism for network topology and node attributes.\nFor maintaining the latent distribution consistency of the obtained two cluster distributions, we further introduce a consistency constraint to the proposed model. The experimental studies demonstrate that the proposed model DCP-DEC is able to achieve our goal. The main contributions of this study are summarized as follows. We propose an end-to-end deep embedded clustering model for attributed networks, which exploits GAE and AE to learn node representations and cluster assignments simultaneously from network topology and node attributes. We further introduce a distribution consistency constraint to maintain the latent consistency of the two cluster assignments. Extensive experiments are carefully designed and conducted on various datasets, and the results demonstrate that our DCP-DEC model is highly competitive and even better than the SOTA methods. The rest of this study is organized as follows. In section 2, we introduce the related works. The proposed deep embedded clustering model is presented in Section 3. In Section 4, we carefully analyze the performance of our model on several datasets compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Finally, the conclusion is drawn in section 5.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: a bag-of-words characterizing the paper.\nIn recent years, there are more and more researches on attributed networks analysis, such as node classification, node clustering, and even recommendation [ref]1 [ref]2 .
