Fine-tuning pretrained LLMs with domain-specific data enables more effective RTL codes  [ref]40. Thus, to achieve high-quality RTL generation, vendors may have to fine-tune these models using valuable IP designs. However, this process could inadvertently expose the actual IP to attackers that seek to extract the training data.\nIn fact, this privacy risk has already been studied by the machine learning community, e.g., [ref]67 showed that an adversary with no prior knowledge can achieve ≈\\approx75% accuracy when retrieving sensitive medical data from BERT responses.\nPrivacy preserving mapping  can be applied to counter such adversaries; such approach should also be applicable to protect sensitive IP for EDA-centric LLMs. The success of HDL debugging with LLMs , facilitated by synthetic supervised fine-tuning, highlights the potential for similar work in enhancing hardware security in general. Designers could create datasets with pairs of attacks and suitable countermeasures. By fine-tuning LLMs with such specialized datasets, the models could become adept at not only recognizing security vulnerabilities but also generating secure designs. Besides, Netlist Whisperer [ref]62 presents an alternative strategy in which LLMs are fine-tuned to pinpoint vulnerabilities and, once identified, another fine-tuned LLM could help to fix those to generate more secure designs. LLMs have shown potential in identifying the security properties of chip designs . This opens up the possibility of fine-tuning LLMs to discover previously unrecognized properties of secure designs. Designers may not fully understand why a particular design is sufficiently secure—the properties identified by LLMs can provide valuable insights, helping designers harden their chips to the fullest extent.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: be augmented with related security assessment and/or simulation results toward more successful HT insertion.
