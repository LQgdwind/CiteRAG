      "content": "Paper Title: Eigenstripping, Spectral Decay, and Edge-Expansion on Posets\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDikstein, Dinur, Filmus, and Harsha [ref]3 observed that one can use the averaging operators to define a natural extension of spectral expansion to graded posets. Their definition is inspired by the fact that Œ≥ùõæ\\gamma-spectral expansion on a standard graph Gùê∫G can be restated as a bound on the spectral norm of the adjacency matrix minus its stationary operator: Informally, DDFH‚Äôs definition can be thought of as stating that this relation holds for every level of a higher dimensional poset. Let (X,Œ†)ùëãŒ†(X,\\Pi) be a measured poset, Œ¥‚àà d‚àí1ùõøsuperscript01ùëë1\\delta\\in ^{d-1}, and Œ≥<1ùõæ1\\gamma<1. XùëãX is an (Œ¥,Œ≥)ùõøùõæ(\\delta,\\gamma)-eposet if for all 1‚â§i‚â§d‚àí11ùëñùëë11\\leq i\\leq d-1: . We note that for a broad range of posets, this definition is actually equivalent (up to constants) to local-spectral expansion, a popular notion of high dimensional expansion introduced by Dinur and Kaufman 8. This was originally proved for simplicial complexes by DDFH [ref]3, and later extended to a more general class of posets by Kaufman and Tessler [ref]32. It is also worth noting that when Œ≥=0ùõæ0\\gamma=0, posets satisfying the guarantee in Definition¬†2.6 are known as sequentially differential, and were actually introduced much earlier by Stanley  in the late 80s. Much of our analysis in this work will be based off of an elegant approximate Fourier decomposition for eposets introduced by DDFH [ref]3. Let (X,Œ†)ùëãŒ†(X,\\Pi) be a dùëëd-dimensional (Œ¥,Œ≥)ùõøùõæ(\\delta,\\gamma)-eposet with Œ≥ùõæ\\gamma sufficiently small. For all 0‚â§k‚â§d0ùëòùëë0\\leq k\\leq d, let Then: In other words, every f‚ààCkùëìsubscriptùê∂ùëòf\\in C_{k} has a unique decomposition f=f0+‚Ä¶+fkùëìsubscriptùëì0‚Ä¶subscriptùëìùëòf=f_{0}+\\ldots+f_{k} such that fi=Uik‚Äãgisubscriptùëìùëñsubscriptsuperscriptùëàùëòùëñsubscriptùëîùëñf_{i}=U^{k}_{i}g_{i} for gi‚ààKer‚Äã(Di)subscriptùëîùëñKersubscriptùê∑ùëñg_{i}\\in\\text{Ker}(D_{i}). It is well known that the HD-Level-Set Decomposition is approximately an eigenbasis for HD-walks on simplicial complex [ref]3 4 5. We show this statement extends to all eposets in Section¬†4 (extending DDFH‚Äôs similar analysis of the upper walk Nk1superscriptsubscriptùëÅùëò1N_{k}^{1}). Finally, before moving on, we will assume for simplicity throughout this work an additional property of eposets we called (approximate) non-laziness. Let (X,Œ†)ùëãŒ†(X,\\Pi) be a dùëëd-dimensional measured poset. We call (X,Œ†)ùëãŒ†(X,\\Pi) Œ≤ùõΩ\\beta-non-lazy if for all 1‚â§i‚â§d1ùëñùëë1\\leq i\\leq d, the laziness of the lower walk satisfies: Another way to think about this condition is that no element in the poset carries too much weight, even upon conditioning. All of our results hold for general eposets,131313The one exception is the lower bound of Theorem¬†1.8. but their form is significantly more interpretable when the poset is additionally non-lazy. In fact, most Œ≥ùõæ\\gamma-eposets of interest are O‚Äã(Œ≥)ùëÇùõæO(\\gamma)-non-lazy. It is easy to see for instance that any ‚ÄúŒ≥ùõæ\\gamma-local-spectral‚Äù expander satisfies this condition, an equivalent notion of expansion to Œ≥ùõæ\\gamma-eposets under suitable regularity conditions [ref]32. We discuss this further in Appendix¬†A.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Dikstein, Dinur, Filmus, and Harsha [ref]3 observed that one can use the averaging operators to define a natural extension of spectral expansion to graded posets.
