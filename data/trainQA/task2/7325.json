For each j∈𝗌𝗃∪𝖽𝗒𝑗𝗌𝗃𝖽𝗒\\mathit{j}\\in\\mathsf{sj}\\cup\\mathsf{dy} that is decorated by ω𝜔\\omega and has G.c𝗂𝗇​[j]∈ℕformulae-sequence𝐺subscript𝑐𝗂𝗇delimited-[]𝑗ℕG.c_{\\mathsf{in}}[\\mathit{j}]\\in\\mathbb{N}, we unroll the precovering graph into a DMGTS that tracks j𝑗\\mathit{j} up to a bound B𝐵B.\nThe bound B𝐵B is of size doubly exponential in |G|𝐺|{G}|.\nBy the same Rackoff argument as in , we conclude that this captures all words in L𝗌𝗃​(G)subscript𝐿𝗌𝗃𝐺L_{\\mathsf{sj}}(G), because the opposite would imply 𝖢𝖲𝗎𝗉​(G)≠∅subscript𝖢𝖲𝗎𝗉𝐺\\mathsf{CS}_{\\mathsf{up}}(G)\\neq\\emptyset.\nThe graph has one peculiarity compared to .\nAssume a Dyck counter has not yet exceeded B𝐵B and becomes negative.\nThen we enter a sink node in which we enable all transitions. The DMGTS in U𝑈U capture the runs that do not enter the sink and reach G.c𝗈𝗎𝗍formulae-sequence𝐺subscript𝑐𝗈𝗎𝗍G.c_{\\mathsf{out}}.\nSince cycles cannot change counter j𝑗\\mathit{j}, the dimension of the vector space decreases for each precovering graph.\nThis reduces the well-founded preorder.\nThe details are in the appendix. The DMGTS in V𝑉V capture the runs that enter the sink and the runs that end in a valuation different from G.c𝗈𝗎𝗍formulae-sequence𝐺subscript𝑐𝗈𝗎𝗍G.c_{\\mathsf{out}}.\nIn both cases, the characteristic equations for 𝖽𝗒𝖽𝗒\\mathsf{dy} become infeasible.\nIndeed, when a Dyck counter becomes negative, the construction forces us to leave a precovering graph towards the sink.\nBut then we fail to satisfy the non-negativity requirement for entering the sink. Lemma 8.6 formalizes the guarantees given by the construction.\nIt is based on [18, Propositions 3.4 and 3.5].\n Let (G,μ)𝐺𝜇(G,\\mu) have 𝖢𝖲𝗎𝗉​(G)=∅subscript𝖢𝖲𝗎𝗉𝐺\\mathsf{CS}_{\\mathsf{up}}(G)=\\emptyset or 𝖢𝖲𝖽𝗈𝗐𝗇​(G)=∅subscript𝖢𝖲𝖽𝗈𝗐𝗇𝐺\\mathsf{CS}_{\\mathsf{down}}(G)=\\emptyset.\nUsing resources elementary in |(G,μ)|𝐺𝜇|{(G,\\mu)}|, we can compute sets U𝑈U and V𝑉V of consistent specializations of (G,μ)𝐺𝜇(G,\\mu), where for all 𝒮∈U𝒮𝑈\\mathcal{S}\\in U, we have 𝒮<𝗋𝗇𝗄(G,μ)subscript𝗋𝗇𝗄𝒮𝐺𝜇\\mathcal{S}<_{\\mathsf{rnk}}(G,\\mu), for all ρ∈𝖨𝖠𝖼𝖼𝗌𝗃​(G,μ)𝜌subscript𝖨𝖠𝖼𝖼𝗌𝗃𝐺𝜇\\rho\\in\\mathsf{IAcc}_{\\mathsf{sj}}(G,\\mu) there is σ∈𝖨𝖠𝖼𝖼𝗌𝗃​(U∪V)𝜎subscript𝖨𝖠𝖼𝖼𝗌𝗃𝑈𝑉\\sigma\\in\\mathsf{IAcc}_{\\mathsf{sj}}(U\\cup V) with ρ≈σ𝜌𝜎\\rho\\approx\\sigma, for all 𝒯∈V𝒯𝑉\\mathcal{T}\\in V, we have that 𝖢𝗁𝖺𝗋𝖽𝗒​(𝒯)subscript𝖢𝗁𝖺𝗋𝖽𝗒𝒯\\mathsf{Char}_{\\mathsf{dy}}(\\mathcal{T}) is infeasible. We explain the role of the DMGTS in V𝑉V that enter the sink as a Dyck counter becomes negative.\nHow can they help with the second property, if the requirement there is that the Dyck counters stay non-negative?\nThe observation is that intermediate acceptance modulo μ𝜇\\mu satisfies a monotonicity property: if ρ∈𝖨𝖠𝖼𝖼ℤ,⊑ωμ[𝖽𝗒]​(𝒯)𝜌subscript𝖨𝖠𝖼𝖼ℤsuperscriptsubscriptsquare-image-of-or-equals𝜔𝜇absentdelimited-[]𝖽𝗒𝒯\\rho\\in\\mathsf{IAcc}_{\\mathbb{Z},\\sqsubseteq_{\\omega}^{\\mu}\\![\\mathsf{dy}]}(\\mathcal{T}) then ρ+k⋅μ∈𝖨𝖠𝖼𝖼ℤ,⊑ωμ[𝖽𝗒]​(𝒯)𝜌⋅𝑘𝜇subscript𝖨𝖠𝖼𝖼ℤsuperscriptsubscriptsquare-image-of-or-equals𝜔𝜇absentdelimited-[]𝖽𝗒𝒯\\rho+k\\cdot\\mu\\in\\mathsf{IAcc}_{\\mathbb{Z},\\sqsubseteq_{\\omega}^{\\mu}\\![\\mathsf{dy}]}(\\mathcal{T}).\nHere, we use ρ+k⋅μ𝜌⋅𝑘𝜇\\rho+k\\cdot\\mu to denote the run obtained from ρ𝜌\\rho by raising the values of all counters in all configurations by k⋅μ⋅𝑘𝜇k\\cdot\\mu with k∈ℕ𝑘ℕk\\in\\mathbb{N}.\nA consequence of monotonicity is that even though a run starting from small values has to enter the sink due to a negative counter, this negativity will disappear in properly scaled runs, and they will still take the same transitions.\nThe set V𝑉V makes sure we do not miss the scaled runs. We define (X,Y)=dec​(𝒲)𝑋𝑌dec𝒲(X,Y)=\\textsf{dec}(\\mathcal{W}) for 𝒲=(𝒞​[G],μ)𝒲𝒞delimited-[]𝐺𝜇\\mathcal{W}=(\\mathcal{C}[G],\\mu) faithful with\n𝖢𝖲𝗎𝗉​(G)=∅subscript𝖢𝖲𝗎𝗉𝐺\\mathsf{CS}_{\\mathsf{up}}(G)=\\emptyset or 𝖢𝖲𝖽𝗈𝗐𝗇​(G)=∅subscript𝖢𝖲𝖽𝗈𝗐𝗇𝐺\\mathsf{CS}_{\\mathsf{down}}(G)=\\emptyset.\nLemma 8.6 yields sets U𝑈U and V𝑉V of consistent specializations.\nWe set X=𝒞​[U]𝑋𝒞delimited-[]𝑈X=\\mathcal{C}[U] and Y=𝒞​[V]𝑌𝒞delimited-[]𝑉Y=\\mathcal{C}[V].\nThe requirements of Lemma 8.1 are derived like in Case (ii).\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: we focus on 𝖢𝖲𝗎𝗉​(G)=∅subscript𝖢𝖲𝗎𝗉𝐺\\mathsf{CS}_{\\mathsf{up}}(G)=\\emptyset.\nWe follow the construction by Leroux and Schmitz , which employs a Rackoff argument , rather than the one by Lambert [ref]18, which works with coverability graphs [ref]13.
