      "content": "Paper Title: Hybrid-S2S: Video Object Segmentation with Recurrent Networks and Correspondence Matching\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOne-shot Video Object Segmentation (VOS) aims to segment an object of interest in a video sequence, where the object mask in the first frame is provided.\nThe objective of this task is to track a target object in a pixel-wise manner.\nIt has various applications such as robotics, autonomous driving, and video editing to name a few.\nVOS is a challenging task, and generating quality segmentation masks requires addressing inevitable real-world difficulties such as unconstrained camera motion, occlusion, fast motion, and motion blur as well as handling objects with different sizes. VOS has been extensively studied in the Computer Vision community with several works based on classical techniques such as energy minimization and utilizing superpixels   .\nHowever, learning-based methods   have proved to be more successful by significantly surpassing the traditional approaches. Amongst the wide variety of the suggested learning-based methods, some works approach the problem by processing the frames independently and learning an object model  , while others utilize temporal information  [ref]36.\nTokmakov et al.  propose utilizing optical flow to propagate the object mask throughout the sequence and make use of the motion cues as well as the spatial information.\nHowever, flow-based models need an additional component for flow estimation , which is usually trained separately, and the performance of the whole system is dependent on the accuracy of this module.\nWith the same motivation of using temporal data,  [ref]36  utilize Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to track the target object in a temporally consistent way.\nThese models are trained end-to-end and rely on learning the spatio-temporal features to track the object and to propagate the object mask across time.\nA disadvantage of this category is the performance drop in longer sequences caused by drift and error propagation in the RNN. In this work, we study S2S , a common RNN-based model for VOS due to the effectiveness of RNNs in utilizing the spatio-temporal features and providing a motion model of the target object, resulting in good segmentation accuracy.\nInspired by 0 [ref]39 [ref]43, we propose a dual propagation strategy by augmenting the spatio-temporal features obtained from the RNN with correspondence matching to reduce the impact of drift.\nUtilizing the features obtained from similarity matching provides a robust measurement for segmentation, improves the segmentation quality, and reduces the error propagation.\nThis aspect is especially beneficial for the model in long sequences where the RNN performance declines.\nAdditionally, we integrate the first frame features into the model throughout the whole sequence as a reliable source of information  [ref]39  [ref]43.\nBy employing these reference features, the model can better handle challenging scenarios such as occlusion , since, by definition, the object is present in the first frame.\nFigure 2 shows an illustration of how correspondence matching together with utilizing the first frame can be helpful in better handling the occlusion.\nWe hypothesize that the RNN also plays a complementary role in correspondence matching.\nImagine a scenario where multiple instances of similar objects are present in the scene;\nin this case, the spatio-temporal model learned by the RNN can act as a location prior and aid the model to distinguish between the target object and the other similar instances. We evaluate our hybrid sequence-to-sequence (HS2S) method on the Youtube-VOS  and DAVIS2017  datasets and demonstrate that our model significantly improves the independent RNN-based models’ segmentation quality  [ref]36.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: variety of the suggested learning-based methods, some works approach the problem by processing the frames independently and learning an object model  , while others utilize temporal information  [ref]36.\nTokmakov et al.  propose utilizing optical flow to propagate the object mask throughout the sequence and make use of the motion cues as well as the spatial information.\nHowever, flow-based\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
