      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to Adversarially Blur Visual Object Tracking\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets. We evaluated adversarial blur attack on four popular datasets, i.e., VOT2018 , OTB100 [ref]51, UAV123 6, and LaSOT [ref]14. VOT2018 and OTB100 are widely used datasets containing 100 videos and 60 videos, respectively. LaSOT is a recent large-scale tracking benchmark, which contains 280 videos. UAV123 6 focuses on tracking the object captured by unmanned aerial vehicle’s camera, including 123 videos. Tracking models.\nWe conduct attack against state-of-the-art trackers including SiamRPN++  with ResNet50  and MobileNetv2 , DiMP  with ResNet50 and ResNet18, and KYS .\nSpecifically, we validate the white-box attack with OP-ABA and OS-ABA against SiamRPN++  with ResNet50  and MobileNetv2 in Sec. 4.2 where the motion-blurred frames are guided by the targeted tracker’s model itself.\nWe choose SiamRPN++  since it is a classic tracker for Siamese network-based methods 5 2   0 which achieves excellent tracking accuracy and real-time tracking speed.\nWe also conduct transferability experiments by using the motion blur crafted from SiamRPN++ with ResNet50 to attack other trackers. Metrics.\nIn terms of the OTB100, UAV123, and LaSOT datasets, we follow their common setups and use one pass evaluation (OPE) that contains two metrics success rate and precision. The former one is based on the intersection over union (IoU) between the ground truth bounding box and predicted one for all frames while the latter is based on the center location error (CLE) between the ground truth and prediction. Please refer to [ref]51 for details.\nTo evaluate the capability of attacking, we use the drop of success rate and precision for different attacks, which are denoted as Succ. Drop and Prec. Drop. The higher drops mean more effective attacking.\nIn terms of VOT2018, it restarts trackers when the object is lost. Expected average overlap (EAO) 0 is the main criterion, evaluating both accuracy and robustness.\nSimilar to Succ. Drop, we use the drop of EAO (i.e., EAO Drop) for evaluating attacks.\nWhen comparing with other additive noise-based attacks, we use the BRISQUE 5 as the image quality assessment. An attack is desired to produce adversarial examples that are not only natural but also able to fool trackers. BRISQUE is a common metric to evaluate the naturalness of images and a smaller BRISQUE means a more natural image. Baselines.\nThere are several tracking attacks including cooling-shrinking attack (CSA) , SPARK 3, One-shot-based attack , and PAT 9. Among them, CSA and SPARK have released their code. We select CSA and SPARK as the baselines.\n\nReference markers found: [51]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]51: Datasets.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
