      "content": "Paper Title: Move Schedules: Fast persistence computations in coarse dynamic settingsThis work was partially supported by the National Science Foundation through grants CCF-2006661 and CAREER award DMS-1943758.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe now describe the reparameterization between the bigraded Betti numbers and the set of “critical lines” Lesnick and Wright [ref]37 used to create their interactive 2d persistence algorithm, beginning with point-line duality.\nLet ℒ¯¯ℒ\\overline{\\mathcal{L}} denote the collection of all lines in ℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2} with non-negative slope, ℒ⊂ℒ¯ℒ¯ℒ\\mathcal{L}\\subset\\overline{\\mathcal{L}} the collection of all lines with non-negative finite slope, and ℒ∘superscriptℒ\\mathcal{L}^{\\circ} the collection of all affine lines with positive finite slope.\nDefine the line and point dual transforms 𝒟ℓsubscript𝒟ℓ\\mathcal{D}_{\\ell} and 𝒟psubscript𝒟𝑝\\mathcal{D}_{p}, respectively, as follows: The transforms 𝒟ℓsubscript𝒟ℓ\\mathcal{D}_{\\ell} and 𝒟psubscript𝒟𝑝\\mathcal{D}_{p} are dual to each other in the sense that for any point a∈[0,∞)×ℝ𝑎0ℝa\\in[0,\\infty)\\times\\mathbb{R} and any line L∈ℒ𝐿ℒL\\in\\mathcal{L}, a∈L𝑎𝐿a\\in L if and only if Dℓ​(L)∈Dp​(a)subscript𝐷ℓ𝐿subscript𝐷𝑝𝑎D_{\\ell}(L)\\in D_{p}(a). Now, for some fixed line L𝐿L, define the push map pushL​(a):ℝ2→L∪∞:subscriptpush𝐿𝑎→superscriptℝ2𝐿\\mathrm{push}_{L}(a):\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\to L\\cup\\infty as: The push map satisfies a number of useful properties. Namely:\n For r<s∈ℝ2𝑟𝑠superscriptℝ2r<s\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}, pushL​(r)≤pushL​(s)subscriptpush𝐿𝑟subscriptpush𝐿𝑠\\mathrm{push}_{L}(r)\\leq\\mathrm{push}_{L}(s) For each a∈ℝ2𝑎superscriptℝ2a\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}, pushL​(a)subscriptpush𝐿𝑎\\mathrm{push}_{L}(a) is continuous on ℒ∘superscriptℒ\\mathcal{L}^{\\circ} For L∈ℒ∘𝐿superscriptℒL\\in\\mathcal{L}^{\\circ} and S⊂ℝ2𝑆superscriptℝ2S\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{2}, pushLsubscriptpush𝐿\\mathrm{push}_{L} induces an ordered partition SLsubscript𝑆𝐿S_{L} on S𝑆S Property (1) elucidates how the standard partial order on ℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2} restricts to a total order on L𝐿L for any L∈ℒ¯𝐿¯ℒL\\in\\overline{\\mathcal{L}}, whereas Properties (2) and (3) qualify the following definition: For some fixed S⊂ℝ2𝑆superscriptℝ2S\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{2}, a line L∈L∘𝐿superscript𝐿L\\in L^{\\circ} is defined to be regular if there is an open ball B∈L∘𝐵superscript𝐿B\\in L^{\\circ} containing L𝐿L such that SL=SL′subscript𝑆𝐿subscript𝑆superscript𝐿′S_{L}=S_{L^{\\prime}} for all L′∈Bsuperscript𝐿′𝐵L^{\\prime}\\in B. Otherwise, the line L𝐿L is defined as critical. The set of critical lines crit​(M)crit𝑀\\mathrm{crit}(M) with respect to some fixed set S⊂ℝ2𝑆superscriptℝ2S\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{2} fully characterizes a certain planar subdivision of the half plane [0,∞)×ℝ0ℝ[0,\\infty)\\times\\mathbb{R}.\nThis planar subdivision, denoted by 𝒜​(M)𝒜𝑀\\mathcal{A}(M), is thus entirely determined by S𝑆S under point line duality.\nA corollary from [ref]35 shows that if the duals of two lines L,L′∈ℒ𝐿superscript𝐿′ℒL,L^{\\prime}\\in\\mathcal{L} are contained in the same 222-cell in 𝒜​(M)𝒜𝑀\\mathcal{A}(M), then SL=SL′subscript𝑆𝐿subscript𝑆superscript𝐿′S_{L}=S_{L^{\\prime}}, i.e. the partitions induced by pushLsubscriptpush𝐿\\mathrm{push}_{L} are equivalent. Indeed, the total order on SLsubscript𝑆𝐿S_{L} is simply the pullback of the total order on L𝐿L with respect to the push map.\nSince 𝒜​(M)𝒜𝑀\\mathcal{A}(M) partitions the entire half-plane, the dual to every line L∈ℒ𝐿ℒL\\in\\mathcal{L} is contained within 𝒜​(M)𝒜𝑀\\mathcal{A}(M)—the desired reparameterization. To connect this construction back to persistence, one requires the definition of bigraded Betti numbers. For our purposes, the ithsuperscript𝑖thi^{\\text{th}}-graded Betti number of M𝑀M is simply a function βi​(M):ℝ2→ℕ:subscript𝛽𝑖𝑀→superscriptℝ2ℕ\\beta_{i}(M):\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\to\\mathbb{N} whose values indicate the number of elements at each degree in a basis of the ithsuperscript𝑖thi^{\\text{th}} module in a free resolution for M𝑀M—the interested reader is referred to [ref]35  for a more precise algebraic definition.\nLet S=supp​β0​(M)∪supp​β1​(M)𝑆suppsubscript𝛽0𝑀suppsubscript𝛽1𝑀S=\\mathrm{supp}\\,\\beta_{0}(M)\\,\\cup\\,\\mathrm{supp}\\,\\beta_{1}(M), where the functions β0​(M),β1​(M)subscript𝛽0𝑀subscript𝛽1𝑀\\beta_{0}(M),\\beta_{1}(M) are 0thsuperscript0th0^{\\text{th}} and 1stsuperscript1st1^{\\text{st}} bigraded Betti numbers of M𝑀M, respectively.\nThe main mathematical result from [ref]35 is a characterization of the barcodes ℬL​(M)subscriptℬ𝐿𝑀\\mathcal{B}_{L}(M), for any L∈ℒ𝐿ℒL\\in\\mathcal{L}, in terms of a set of barcode templates 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} computed at every 2-cell in 𝒜​(M)𝒜𝑀\\mathcal{A}(M).\nMore formally, for any line L∈ℒ¯𝐿¯ℒL\\in\\overline{\\mathcal{L}} and e𝑒e any 2-cell in 𝒜​(M)𝒜𝑀\\mathcal{A}(M) whose closure contains the dual of L𝐿L under point-line duality, the 1-parameter restriction of the persistence module M𝑀M induced by L𝐿L is given by: Minor additional conditions are needed for handling completely horizontal and vertical lines.\nThe importance of this theorem lies in the fact that the fibered barcodes are completely defined from the precomputed barcode templates 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T}—once every barcode template 𝒯esuperscript𝒯𝑒\\mathcal{T}^{e} has been computed and augmented onto 𝒜​(M)𝒜𝑀\\mathcal{A}(M), ℬ​(M)ℬ𝑀\\mathcal{B}(M) is completely characterized, and the barcodes ℬL​(M)subscriptℬ𝐿𝑀\\mathcal{B}_{L}(M) associated to a 1-D filtration induced by any choice of L𝐿L can be efficiently computed via a point-location query on 𝒜​(M)𝒜𝑀\\mathcal{A}(M) and a O​(|ℬL​(M)|)𝑂subscriptℬ𝐿𝑀O(\\lvert\\mathcal{B}_{L}(M)\\rvert) application of the push map.\n\n\nInvariant computation:  Computationally, the algorithm from  can be summarized into three steps: Compute the bigraded Betti numbers β​(M)𝛽𝑀\\beta(M) of M𝑀M Construct a line arrangement 𝒜​(M)𝒜𝑀\\mathcal{A}(M) induced by critical lines from (1) Augment 𝒜​(M)𝒜𝑀\\mathcal{A}(M) with barcode templates 𝒯esubscript𝒯𝑒\\mathcal{T}_{e} at every 2-cell e∈𝒜​(M)𝑒𝒜𝑀e\\in\\mathcal{A}(M) Computing (1) takes approximately ≈O​(m3)absent𝑂superscript𝑚3\\approx O(m^{3}) using a matrix algorithm similar to Algorithm 4 . Constructing and storing the line arrangement 𝒜​(M)𝒜𝑀\\mathcal{A}(M) with n𝑛n lines and k𝑘k vertices is related to the line segment intersection problem, which known algorithms in computational geometry can solve in (optimal) output-sensitive O​((n+k)​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑘𝑛O((n+k)\\log n) time .\nIn terms of space complexity, the number of 2-cells in 𝒜​(M)𝒜𝑀\\mathcal{A}(M) is upper bounded by O​(κ2)𝑂superscript𝜅2O(\\kappa^{2}), where κ𝜅\\kappa is a coarseness parameter associated with the computation of β​(M)𝛽𝑀\\beta(M). There are several approaches one can use to compute 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T}, the simplest being to run Algorithm 4 independently on the 1-D filtration induced by the duals of some set of points (e.g. the barycenters) lying in the interior of the 2-cells of 𝒜​(M)𝒜𝑀\\mathcal{A}(M).\nThe approach taken by [ref]35 is to use the R=D​V𝑅𝐷𝑉R=DV decomposition computed at some adjacent 2-cell e∈𝒜​(M)𝑒𝒜𝑀e\\in\\mathcal{A}(M) to speed up the computation of an adjacent cell e′∈𝒜​(M)superscript𝑒′𝒜𝑀e^{\\prime}\\in\\mathcal{A}(M). More explicitly, define the dual graph of 𝒜​(M)𝒜𝑀\\mathcal{A}(M) to be the undirected graph G𝐺G which has a vertex for every 2-cell e∈𝒜​(M)𝑒𝒜𝑀e\\in\\mathcal{A}(M) and an edge for each adjacent pair of cells e,e′∈𝒜​(M)𝑒superscript𝑒′𝒜𝑀e,e^{\\prime}\\in\\mathcal{A}(M).\nEach vertex in G𝐺G is associated with a barcode template 𝒯esuperscript𝒯𝑒\\mathcal{T}^{e}, and the computation of 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} now reduces to computing a path ΓΓ\\Gamma on G𝐺G which visits each vertex at least once. To minimize the computation time, assume the n𝑛n edges of G𝐺G are endowed with non-negative weights W=w1,w2,…,wn𝑊subscript𝑤1subscript𝑤2…subscript𝑤𝑛W=w_{1},w_{2},\\dots,w_{n} whose values wi∈ℝ+subscript𝑤𝑖subscriptℝw_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}_{+} represent some notion of distance which is proportional to the computational disparity between adjacent template computations. The optimal path Γ∗superscriptΓ∗\\Gamma^{\\ast} that minimizes the computation time is then the minimal length path with respect to W𝑊W which visits every vertex of G𝐺G at least once. There is a known 3232\\frac{3}{2}-approximation that can be computed efficiently which reduces the problem to the traveling salesman problem on a metric graph , and thus can be used so long as the distance function between templates is a valid metrics. [ref]37 use the Kendall distance between the push-map induced filtrations, but other options are available—for example, any of the combinatorial metrics we studied in Section 3.4.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: We now describe the reparameterization between the bigraded Betti numbers and the set of “critical lines” Lesnick and Wright [ref]37 used to create their interactive 2d persistence algorithm, beginning with point-line duality.\nLet ℒ¯¯ℒ\\overline{\\mathcal{L}} denote the collection of all lines in\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
