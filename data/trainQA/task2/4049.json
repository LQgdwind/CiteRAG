      "content": "Paper Title: C3Fusion: Consistent Contrastive Colon Fusion, Towards Deep SLAM in Colonoscopy\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe third most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide is colorectal cancer (CRC) with over than 1.9 million incident cases in 2020 [ref]15. CRC is also among the most preventable cancers  and can be prevented from progressing if detected in it’s primary stages by conducting screening and early detection measures [ref]28 . Consequently, global incidence rates have been decreasing in the screening-eligible age group (50–75) due to the adoption of CRC\nscreening [ref]1. The most common screening procedure is optical colonoscopy (OC) , which visually inspects the mucosal surface for abnormalities in the colon such as colorectal lesions. Nevertheless, performing a thorough endoscopic colon investigation solely from OC is very difficult. In practice, this means that not all regions of the colon will be covered and fully examined; consequently, tainting the polyp detection rate. Lately, we are seeing a bloom in deep learning-based methods adapted to predict depth-maps from OC    , aimed at providing a complete 3D geometric information of the colon including polyps. Thus, indicating the un-inspected surfaces during OC; as a result, increasing the polyp detection rate. Despite the profusion of reconstruction solutions, a holistic solution for the problem of 3D colon reconstruction at scale that addresses real life issues during OC has yet to be seen. This is due to the numerous requirements that such system would have to support: Accurate depth prediction - producing high-quality geometry-consistent depth estimation from a monocular video is imperative as well as challenging. Scalability - chosen representation should support extended scale environments while preserving global structure, and high local accuracy. Global consistency - the method should be robust to pose drifts and estimation error in order to enable the re-examination of previously scanned areas or loop closure. Robust camera tracking - tracking failure is extremely frequent in OC. Occlusions, fast motions, featureless regions  and deficient frames are a fraction of the reasons that contribute to loss of track. When these occur, the system should have the ability to re-localize the camera position. There have been studies addressing specific parts of these problems     0 3. Direct SLAM systems optimize a photometric error which is susceptible to drastic illumination changes in OC imagery. Ma et al.  reconstructed fragments of the colon using Direct Sparse Odometry (DSO)  and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for depth estimation. Zhang et al. 3 predicted gamma correction value to alleviate sudden illumination changes and  improved the depth estimation network using geometry-consistency losses. Indirect SLAM methods, like  , usually utilize keypoints matching based on handcrafted descriptors. This kind of descriptors e.g., SIFT , are based on local gradients and hence not well suited to often texture-less and shadow prone OC imagery. Modern deep network based descriptors adopt CNN to predict both keypoint and descriptors for local feature matching. DeTone et al. , predicts keypoints and descriptors directly from a pre-trained DNN. However, it’s localization accuracy is hampered due to the low dimensionality output. Moreover, as it’s training is based on corner detection keypoints it is not optimized to OC cases, characterized with numerous occlusions. Although these aforementioned studies show promising results, there hasn’t been a single solution to tackle all of these requirements up to date. Our goal in this paper is to rigorously cope with all of these requirements in a single, end-to-end 3D reconstruction pipeline. At the core of our method is a robust positioning estimation scheme that utilizes contrastive deep-feature based correspondences. The proposed method globally optimizes the camera pose per-frame, taking into consideration all previously captured frames in an effective local-to-global hierarchical optimization framework. In summary, the main contributions of our work are as follows: (1) A novel, deep-learning-driven global pose alignment SLAM system for OC which incorporates the complete sequence of input frames and removes the fuzzy nature of temporal tracking accuracy issues; (2) Large-scale colon 3D reconstruction, demonstrating model refinement in revisited areas, recovery from tracking failures, and robustness to drift and continuous loop closures; and (3) a novel method for local feature matching in low-texture areas, implicit loop closures in highly indistinguishable environments and highly-accurate fine-scale pose alignment.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: The third most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide is colorectal cancer (CRC) with over than 1.9 million incident cases in 2020 [ref]15.
