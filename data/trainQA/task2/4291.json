      "content": "Paper Title: Hierarchical Symbolic Reasoning in Hyperbolic Space for Deep Discriminative Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVector quantisation: \n proposed a new way of training variational autoencoders (VAE) with discrete latent variables, which showed competitive performance with its continuous counterparts.\nThey achieve the discretisation of the continuous latent variables from the output of an encoder with a method called vector quantisation (VQ).\nWe therefore use VQ to learn a set of discrete symbols to represent the continuous latent space of a classifier.\n Hyperbolic embeddings: \nA natural objective when embedding symbolic data in graphs is for the distances between symbols, defined by the space which they reside in, to correlate with their semantic similarity.\nHowever, to model increasingly complex relations between symbols, one is bounded by the dimensionality of embeddings in Euclidean space [ref]36.\nThis is because the number of nodes in most cases grows exponentially as the graph distance from the centre node increases, while Euclidean space grows polynomially. This leads to embedding distortion and loss of information [ref]37.\nHyperbolic geometry is a form of non-Euclidean geometry with a constant negative Gaussian curvature whose space grows exponentially. One can even informally describe hyperbolic space as the continuous version of trees, making it naturally equipped to deal with tree-like structures.\nThis property has therefore been exploited in the literature for embedding hierarchical data in hyperbolic space without distortion and provides the reasoning for embedding our abstraction tree in hyperbolic space.\nFor example, in [ref]38, the authors proposed to use a hyperbolic model called the Poincare disk for word embeddings to simultaneously capture hierarchy and similarity reliably, which led to promising results in link prediction.\nHyperbolic neural networks were proposed to perform all the operations of a neural network in hyperbolic space .\nThis was later exploited in the development of hyperbolic graph convolutional neural networks (HGCNN)  \nwhich forms the structure of our method for reasoning in hyperbolic space. Symbolic reasoning: \nReasoning with symbolic data can mainly be performed via inductive or deductive approaches.\nInductive reasoning considers a specific dataset and makes a broad generalization that is most probable while deductive reasoning provides complete evidence of the truth for its conclusion.\nInductive logic programs (ILP) is a framework which learns using relational theories, such as using heuristics and physical properties to understand images .\nDue to the strong inductive biases imposed by background knowledge, ILP approaches usually need very few examples to learn and generalize well .\nIn ILP, all the known hypotheses of an environment and a model’s reasoning can be converted to logic programs that can be read and understood by humans. This makes ILP an ideal candidate for explainable AI  and\nforms the basis for learning our abstraction tree.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: they reside in, to correlate with their semantic similarity.\nHowever, to model increasingly complex relations between symbols, one is bounded by the dimensionality of embeddings in Euclidean space [ref]36.\nThis is because the number of nodes in most cases grows exponentially as the graph distance from the centre node increases, while Euclidean space grows polynomially. This leads to embedding\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
