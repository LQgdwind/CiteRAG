      "content": "Paper Title: Almost Optimal Time Lower Bound for Approximating Parameterized Clique, CSP, and More, under ETH\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe first set up some necessary notation. We first recall the notion of parallel polynomial from Section 3.\nLet 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} be a finite field.\nFor a parallel-output function f:𝔽m→𝔽t:𝑓→superscript𝔽𝑚superscript𝔽𝑡f\\colon\\mathbb{F}^{m}\\to\\mathbb{F}^{t}, we denote f​,…,f​[t]:𝔽m→𝔽:𝑓delimited-[]1…𝑓delimited-[]𝑡→superscript𝔽𝑚𝔽f,\\ldots,f[t]\\colon\\mathbb{F}^{m}\\to\\mathbb{F} as its single-output components, i.e., f​(x)=(f​​(x),…,f​[t]​(x))𝑓𝑥𝑓delimited-[]1𝑥…𝑓delimited-[]𝑡𝑥f(x)=(f(x),\\ldots,f[t](x)).\nWe aim to test if f​,…,f​[t]𝑓delimited-[]1…𝑓delimited-[]𝑡f,\\ldots,f[t] are consistent with degree-d𝑑d polynomials on a large common set of inputs.\nFormally, we say f𝑓f is δ𝛿\\delta-close to parallel degree-d𝑑d iff f𝑓f is δ𝛿\\delta-close to 𝖱𝖬𝔽,m,d,tsuperscript𝖱𝖬𝔽𝑚𝑑𝑡{{\\sf RM}}^{\\mathbb{F},m,d,t}; and we say f𝑓f is parallel degree-d𝑑d if δ=0𝛿0\\delta=0. A simple union bound shows that if each f​[i]𝑓delimited-[]𝑖f[i] is δ𝛿\\delta-close to degree-d𝑑d (e.g., from the standard low degree test), then f=(f​,…,f​[t])𝑓𝑓delimited-[]1…𝑓delimited-[]𝑡f=(f,\\ldots,f[t]) is t​δ𝑡𝛿t\\delta-close to parallel degree-d𝑑d. However for our purposes, such a loss is not affordable since t𝑡t is typically large.\nTherefore we need to open-box the specific low degree test and show that it implies consistency on 1−δ1𝛿1-\\delta common fraction of inputs simultaneously for all f​[i]𝑓delimited-[]𝑖f[i]. For x,y∈𝔽m𝑥𝑦superscript𝔽𝑚x,y\\in\\mathbb{F}^{m}, the line crossing x𝑥x in direction y𝑦y is the set Note that if y=0m𝑦superscript0𝑚y=0^{m} then ℓx,y={x}subscriptℓ𝑥𝑦𝑥\\ell_{x,y}=\\left\\{x\\right\\}, otherwise ℓx,ysubscriptℓ𝑥𝑦\\ell_{x,y} has |𝔽|𝔽|\\mathbb{F}| points.\nLet 𝕃𝕃\\mathbb{L} be the set of lines in 𝔽msuperscript𝔽𝑚\\mathbb{F}^{m}.\nFor a parallel function f:𝔽m→𝔽t:𝑓→superscript𝔽𝑚superscript𝔽𝑡f\\colon\\mathbb{F}^{m}\\to\\mathbb{F}^{t} and any ℓ∈𝕃ℓ𝕃\\ell\\in\\mathbb{L}, we use f|ℓ:ℓ→𝔽t:evaluated-at𝑓ℓ→ℓsuperscript𝔽𝑡f|_{\\ell}\\colon\\ell\\to\\mathbb{F}^{t} to denote the restriction of f𝑓f on the line ℓℓ\\ell. Let 𝔽(d,t)superscript𝔽𝑑𝑡\\mathbb{F}^{(d,t)} be the set of univariate parallel degree-d𝑑d polynomials, i.e., The standard low degree test 𝖫𝖣𝖳𝖾𝗌𝗍f,gsuperscript𝖫𝖣𝖳𝖾𝗌𝗍𝑓𝑔\\mathsf{LDTest}^{f,g} , translated to the parallel setting , is given oracle access to f:𝔽m→𝔽t:𝑓→superscript𝔽𝑚superscript𝔽𝑡f\\colon\\mathbb{F}^{m}\\to\\mathbb{F}^{t} and g:𝕃→𝔽(d,t):𝑔→𝕃superscript𝔽𝑑𝑡g\\colon\\mathbb{L}\\to\\mathbb{F}^{(d,t)}, which later tests their consistency999The term consistency has been called correlated agreement, e.g., in recent literature of proximity gaps for RS codes and related literature in FRI protocol/SNARKs..\nFor each line ℓ∈𝕃ℓ𝕃\\ell\\in\\mathbb{L}, we denote g​(ℓ)∈𝔽(d,t)𝑔ℓsuperscript𝔽𝑑𝑡g(\\ell)\\in\\mathbb{F}^{(d,t)} as its parallel line polynomial, which we interpret as a univariate parallel degree-d𝑑d polynomial mapping elements in ℓℓ\\ell to 𝔽tsuperscript𝔽𝑡\\mathbb{F}^{t}.\nThus for a line ℓℓ\\ell and a point z∈ℓ𝑧ℓz\\in\\ell, g​(ℓ)​(z)∈𝔽t𝑔ℓ𝑧superscript𝔽𝑡g(\\ell)(z)\\in\\mathbb{F}^{t} is well defined.\nWe say f𝑓f agrees with g​(ℓ)𝑔ℓg(\\ell) on z𝑧z if f​(z)=g​(ℓ)​(z)𝑓𝑧𝑔ℓ𝑧f(z)=g(\\ell)(z). For each f:𝔽m→𝔽t:𝑓→superscript𝔽𝑚superscript𝔽𝑡f\\colon\\mathbb{F}^{m}\\to\\mathbb{F}^{t} and d∈ℕ𝑑ℕd\\in\\mathbb{N}, we use f𝕃:𝕃→𝔽(d,t):subscript𝑓𝕃→𝕃superscript𝔽𝑑𝑡f_{\\mathbb{L}}\\colon\\mathbb{L}\\to\\mathbb{F}^{(d,t)} to denote the restriction of f𝑓f on each line to its closest parallel degree-d𝑑d polynomial. That is, for each line ℓℓ\\ell, we set f𝕃​(ℓ)subscript𝑓𝕃ℓf_{\\mathbb{L}}(\\ell) to be the parallel degree-d𝑑d polynomial closest to f|ℓevaluated-at𝑓ℓf|_{\\ell}, where we break tie arbitrarily.\nNote that we will always assume the degree to be tested is d𝑑d, and thus we omit d𝑑d in defining f𝕃subscript𝑓𝕃f_{\\mathbb{L}} for simplicity. In the completeness case (i.e., f𝑓f is indeed parallel degree-d𝑑d), we can pick f𝕃​(ℓ)=f|ℓsubscript𝑓𝕃ℓevaluated-at𝑓ℓf_{\\mathbb{L}}(\\ell)=f|_{\\ell} which is also parallel degree-d𝑑d.\nThe parallel low degree test 𝖫𝖣𝖳𝖾𝗌𝗍f,gsuperscript𝖫𝖣𝖳𝖾𝗌𝗍𝑓𝑔\\mathsf{LDTest}^{f,g} explores the reverse direction:\nindependently select x,y∼𝔽msimilar-to𝑥𝑦superscript𝔽𝑚x,y\\sim\\mathbb{F}^{m} and accept iff f​(x)=g​(ℓx,y)​(x)𝑓𝑥𝑔subscriptℓ𝑥𝑦𝑥f(x)=g(\\ell_{x,y})(x), i.e., f𝑓f agrees with the parallel line polynomial g​(ℓx,y)𝑔subscriptℓ𝑥𝑦g(\\ell_{x,y}) on point x𝑥x.\nThe parallel low degree test  shows that if 𝖫𝖣𝖳𝖾𝗌𝗍f,gsuperscript𝖫𝖣𝖳𝖾𝗌𝗍𝑓𝑔\\mathsf{LDTest}^{f,g} accepts with probability 1−δ1𝛿1-\\delta, then f𝑓f is O​(δ)𝑂𝛿O(\\delta)-close to parallel degree-d𝑑d. Note that this bound does not depend on t𝑡t. Now we introduce the derandomized version of the parallel low degree test.\nFollowing [ref]8, this simply replaces the uniformly random direction y𝑦y by a pseudorandom y∼Ssimilar-to𝑦𝑆y\\sim S for a much smaller set S⊆𝔽m𝑆superscript𝔽𝑚S\\subseteq\\mathbb{F}^{m}.\nHence the number of randomness drops from |𝔽|2​msuperscript𝔽2𝑚|\\mathbb{F}|^{2m} to |S|⋅|𝔽|m⋅𝑆superscript𝔽𝑚|S|\\cdot|\\mathbb{F}|^{m}. Let S⊆𝔽m𝑆superscript𝔽𝑚S\\subseteq\\mathbb{F}^{m} and f:𝔽m→𝔽t,g:𝕃→𝔽(d,t):𝑓→superscript𝔽𝑚superscript𝔽𝑡𝑔:→𝕃superscript𝔽𝑑𝑡f\\colon\\mathbb{F}^{m}\\to\\mathbb{F}^{t},g\\colon\\mathbb{L}\\to\\mathbb{F}^{(d,t)}.101010Technically, g𝑔g only needs to be defined on lines whose directions are in S𝑆S. We choose to assume g𝑔g is defined over all lines 𝕃𝕃\\mathbb{L} for simplicity. \nThe derandomized parallel low degree test 𝖫𝖣𝖳𝖾𝗌𝗍Sf,gsubscriptsuperscript𝖫𝖣𝖳𝖾𝗌𝗍𝑓𝑔𝑆\\mathsf{LDTest}^{f,g}_{S} is executed as follows:\nindependently select x∼𝔽msimilar-to𝑥superscript𝔽𝑚x\\sim\\mathbb{F}^{m} and y∼Ssimilar-to𝑦𝑆y\\sim S, then accept iff f​(x)=g​(ℓx,y)​(x)𝑓𝑥𝑔subscriptℓ𝑥𝑦𝑥f(x)=g(\\ell_{x,y})(x). Later the set S𝑆S is chosen to be a λ𝜆\\lambda-biased set as in [ref]8. S⊆𝔽m𝑆superscript𝔽𝑚S\\subseteq\\mathbb{F}^{m} is a λ𝜆\\lambda-biased set iff S𝑆S is symmetric, i.e., if y∈S𝑦𝑆y\\in S then −y∈S𝑦𝑆-y\\in S;111111In some literature this symmetric assumption is not imposed. The parameter λ𝜆\\lambda in that case is comparable with the one here by a multiplicative factor of 222. |𝔼y∼S[χ​(y)]|≤λsubscript𝔼similar-to𝑦𝑆𝜒𝑦𝜆\\left|\\operatorname*{\\mathbb{E}}_{y\\sim S}\\left[\\chi(y)\\right]\\right|\\leq\\lambda holds for any non-trivial homomorphism121212This homomorphism is usually referred as character. It is trivial if it maps everything to 111. An illustrative example is when 𝔽=𝔽2𝔽subscript𝔽2\\mathbb{F}=\\mathbb{F}_{2} and χ𝜒\\chi is a parity function. χ:𝔽m→μp:𝜒→superscript𝔽𝑚subscript𝜇𝑝\\chi\\colon\\mathbb{F}^{m}\\to\\mu_{p}, where μ𝜇\\mu is the multiplicative group of p𝑝p-th unit root and p𝑝p is the characteristic of 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F}. In a graph theoretical reformulation, S𝑆S is λ𝜆\\lambda-biased iff the graph GSsubscript𝐺𝑆G_{S} is an (undirected) expander graph with expansion factor 1−λ1𝜆1-\\lambda, where the vertex set of GSsubscript𝐺𝑆G_{S} is 𝔽msuperscript𝔽𝑚\\mathbb{F}^{m} and x,y∈GS𝑥𝑦subscript𝐺𝑆x,y\\in G_{S} is connected iff x−y∈S𝑥𝑦𝑆x-y\\in S (see e.g., ).\nFor our purposes, we quote the following results derived directly from the expanding property of biased sets. Suppose S⊆𝔽m𝑆superscript𝔽𝑚S\\subseteq\\mathbb{F}^{m} is λ𝜆\\lambda-biased. Then for any B⊆𝔽m𝐵superscript𝔽𝑚B\\subseteq\\mathbb{F}^{m} of density μ=|B||𝔽|m𝜇𝐵superscript𝔽𝑚\\mu=\\frac{|B|}{|\\mathbb{F}|^{m}} and any ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, we have Finally we remark that λ𝜆\\lambda-biased sets exist for |S|=Ω​(m​log⁡|𝔽|λ2)𝑆Ω𝑚𝔽superscript𝜆2|S|=\\Omega\\left(\\frac{m\\log|\\mathbb{F}|}{\\lambda^{2}}\\right)  and efficient explicit constructions of sizes 𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒​(m,log⁡|𝔽|,1λ)𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝑚𝔽1𝜆\\mathsf{poly}(m,\\log|\\mathbb{F}|,\\frac{1}{\\lambda}) are also obtained. For any finite field 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F}, positive integer m𝑚m, and parameter λ∈(0,1]𝜆01\\lambda\\in(0,1], a λ𝜆\\lambda-biased set of size 𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒​(m,log⁡|𝔽|,1λ)𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝑚𝔽1𝜆\\mathsf{poly}(m,\\log|\\mathbb{F}|,\\frac{1}{\\lambda}) can be constructed efficiently in time 𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒​(m,|𝔽|,1λ)𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝑚𝔽1𝜆\\mathsf{poly}(m,|\\mathbb{F}|,\\frac{1}{\\lambda}). Unfortunately the derandomized parallel low degree test is not sufficient to guarantee the exact quantitative degree condition, as the directions S𝑆S have fairly limited possibilities.\nMore concretely, even if 𝖫𝖣𝖳𝖾𝗌𝗍Sf,gsuperscriptsubscript𝖫𝖣𝖳𝖾𝗌𝗍𝑆𝑓𝑔\\mathsf{LDTest}_{S}^{f,g} succeeds with probability 111, it is not guaranteed that f𝑓f is parallel degree-d𝑑d.\nTo compensate the missing directions, we need to augment Definition A.1 with an additional test that checks the consistency of f𝑓f and g𝑔g on a purely random direction from the origin [ref]8. Let S⊆𝔽m𝑆superscript𝔽𝑚S\\subseteq\\mathbb{F}^{m} and f:𝔽m→𝔽t,g:𝕃→𝔽(d,t):𝑓→superscript𝔽𝑚superscript𝔽𝑡𝑔:→𝕃superscript𝔽𝑑𝑡f\\colon\\mathbb{F}^{m}\\to\\mathbb{F}^{t},g\\colon\\mathbb{L}\\to\\mathbb{F}^{(d,t)}.\nThe augmented derandomized parallel low degree test 𝖠𝗎𝗀𝖫𝖣𝖳𝖾𝗌𝗍Sf,gsuperscriptsubscript𝖠𝗎𝗀𝖫𝖣𝖳𝖾𝗌𝗍𝑆𝑓𝑔\\mathsf{AugLDTest}_{S}^{f,g} is executed as follows: with equal probability we perform one of the following two tests: Independently select x∼𝔽msimilar-to𝑥superscript𝔽𝑚x\\sim\\mathbb{F}^{m} and y∼Ssimilar-to𝑦𝑆y\\sim S, then accept iff f​(x)=g​(ℓx,y)​(x)𝑓𝑥𝑔subscriptℓ𝑥𝑦𝑥f(x)=g(\\ell_{x,y})(x). Select z∼𝔽msimilar-to𝑧superscript𝔽𝑚z\\sim\\mathbb{F}^{m}, then accept iff f​(z)=g​(ℓ0m,z)​(z)𝑓𝑧𝑔subscriptℓsuperscript0𝑚𝑧𝑧f(z)=g(\\ell_{0^{m},z})(z). The first test in 𝖠𝗎𝗀𝖫𝖣𝖳𝖾𝗌𝗍Sf,gsuperscriptsubscript𝖠𝗎𝗀𝖫𝖣𝖳𝖾𝗌𝗍𝑆𝑓𝑔\\mathsf{AugLDTest}_{S}^{f,g} is simply 𝖫𝖣𝖳𝖾𝗌𝗍Sf,gsuperscriptsubscript𝖫𝖣𝖳𝖾𝗌𝗍𝑆𝑓𝑔\\mathsf{LDTest}_{S}^{f,g}, for which we will later show that it guarantees that f𝑓f is close to parallel degree-m​d𝑚𝑑md.\nThen the second test allows us to further bring the degree down to d𝑑d.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: then f𝑓f is O​(δ)𝑂𝛿O(\\delta)-close to parallel degree-d𝑑d. Note that this bound does not depend on t𝑡t.
