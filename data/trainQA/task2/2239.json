Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

Given the differences in data domains depicted in Fig.5, avoiding any possible dataset and covariate shifts is necessary. Using R​e​L​U𝑅𝑒𝐿𝑈ReLU to keep the same activation patterns within layers of our architecture, given that all 5 pretrained feature extractors contain R​e​L​U𝑅𝑒𝐿𝑈ReLU activations. Batch Normalization  is applied after each convolutional layer in our Convolutional AutoEncoder block, since our pretrained feature extractors are trained with 1000 classes on the label side, and our classification task only has 2 classes, this causes an Internal Covariate Shift, representing the change in the distributions of internal nodes of our network as mentioned in . Adam Optimizer , is used for all 5 models, to ensure fairness in comparisons, and a fixed batch size of 32. Our IMDB-Image dataset contains 50000 images samples,\nwe split the dataset into a 40000 train and a 10000 validation samples. Differential learning rates are used for our Adam  optimizer, while keeping the pretrained feature extractors frozen during training, since our dataset is very small compared to the S​o​u​r​c​e𝑆𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐𝑒Source Dataset (imageNet ).\nAn NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX 1060 GPU was used for the entire procedure.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: As shown in Fig.7, our five models share a Convolutional AutoEncoder, and three Linear Layers, and differ in the pretrained feature extractors obtained from 5 different pretrained vision models [ref]14 [ref]15 [ref]20  .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
