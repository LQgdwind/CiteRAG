      "content": "Paper Title: 1 Introduction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn computational molecular biology,\nvarious types of data have been utilized, which include\nsequences, gene expression patterns, and protein structures.\nGraph structured data have also been extensively utilized,\nwhich include metabolic pathways, protein-protein interaction networks,\ngene regulatory networks, and chemical graphs.\nMuch attention has recently been paid to analysis of chemical graphs\ndue to its potential applications to computer-aided drug design.\nOne of the major approaches to computer-aided drug design is\nquantitative structure activity/property relationships (QSAR/QSPR) analysis,\nthe purpose of which is to derive\nquantitative relationships between chemical structures and\ntheir activities/properties.\nFurthermore, inverse QSAR/QSPR has been extensively studied\n ,\nthe purpose of which is to infer chemical structures from given chemical\nactivities/properties.\nInverse QSAR/QSPR is often formulated as an optimization problem\nto find a chemical structure maximizing (or minimizing) an\nobjective function under various constraints. In both QSAR/QSPR and inverse QSAR/QSPR,\nchemical compounds are usually represented as vectors of real or integer numbers,\nwhich are often called descriptors and\ncorrespond to feature vectors in machine learning.\nUsing these chemical descriptors,\nvarious heuristic and statistical methods have been developed for\nfinding optimal or nearly optimal graph structures under given\nobjective functions   7.\nInference or enumeration of graph structures from a given feature vector\nis a crucial subtask in many of such methods.\nVarious methods have been developed for this enumeration problem\n[ref]6   \nand the computational complexity of the inference problem has\nbeen analyzed  4.\nOn the other hand, enumeration in itself is a challenging task,\nsince the number of\nmolecules (i.e., chemical graphs) with up to 30 atoms (vertices)\nC, N, O, and S,\nmay exceed 1060superscript106010^{60} . As a new approach,\nartificial neural network (ANN) and deep learning technologies\nhave recently been applied to inverse QSAR/QSPR.\nFor example, variational autoencoders ,\nrecurrent neural networks 8 , and\ngrammar variational autoencoders 1 have been applied.\nIn these approaches, new chemical graphs are generated\nby solving a kind of inverse problems on neural networks that are\ntrained using known chemical compound/activity pairs.\nHowever, the optimality of the solution is not necessarily guaranteed in\nthese approaches.\nIn order to guarantee the optimality mathematically,\na novel approach has been proposed \nfor ANNs, using mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Recently, a new framework has been proposed\n  4\nby combining two previous approaches; efficient enumeration\nof tree-like graphs [ref]6, and\nMILP-based formulation of the inverse problem on ANNs .\nThis combined framework for inverse QSAR/QSPR mainly consists of two phases.\nThe first phase solves (I) Prediction Problem,\nwhere\na feature vector f​(G)𝑓𝐺f(G) of a chemical graph G𝐺G is introduced\nand\na prediction function ψ𝒩subscript𝜓𝒩\\psi_{\\mathcal{N}} on a chemical property π𝜋\\pi\nis constructed with an ANN 𝒩𝒩\\mathcal{N}\nusing a data set of chemical compounds G𝐺G and their values a​(G)𝑎𝐺a(G) of π𝜋\\pi.\nThe second phase solves (II) Inverse Problem,\nwhere (II-a) given a target value y∗superscript𝑦y^{*} of the chemical property π𝜋\\pi,\na feature vector x∗superscript𝑥x^{*} is inferred from the trained ANN 𝒩𝒩\\mathcal{N}\nso that ψ𝒩​(x∗)subscript𝜓𝒩superscript𝑥\\psi_{\\mathcal{N}}(x^{*}) is close to y∗superscript𝑦y^{*}\nand (II-b) then a set of chemical structures G∗superscript𝐺G^{*}\nsuch that f​(G∗)=x∗𝑓superscript𝐺superscript𝑥f(G^{*})=x^{*} is enumerated by a graph search algorithm.\nIn (II-a) of the above-mentioned previous methods   4,\nan MILP is formulated for acyclic chemical compounds.\nAfterwards, Ito et al.  and Zhu et al. 5\ndesigned a method of inferring chemical graphs\nwith cycle index 1 and 2, respectively\nby formulating a new MILP and using\nan efficient algorithm for enumerating chemical graphs with cycle index 1\n0 and cycle index 2 1 2.\nThe computational results conducted on instances with\nn𝑛n non-hydrogen atoms show that\na feature vector x∗superscript𝑥x^{*} can be inferred for up to around n=40𝑛40n=40\nwhereas graphs G∗superscript𝐺G^{*} can be enumerated for up to around n=15𝑛15n=15. In this paper, we present a new characterization of graph structure,\ncalled “branch-height.”\nBased on this, we can treat a class of acyclic chemical graphs\nwith a structure that is topologically restricted but frequently appears\nin the chemical database,\nformulate a new MILP formulation that can handle\nacyclic graphs with a large diameter,\nand design a new graph search algorithm\nthat generates acyclic chemical graphs with up to 50 vertices.\nThe results of computational experiments using such chemical properties as\noctanol/water partition coefficient,\nboiling point and\nheat of combustion\nsuggest that the proposed method is much more useful than the previous method. The paper is organized as follows.\nSection 2 introduces some notions on graphs,\na modeling of chemical compounds and a choice of descriptors.\nSection 3 reviews the framework for inferring\nchemical compounds based on ANNs and MILPs.\nSection 4 introduces a new method of modeling\nacyclic chemical graphs and\nproposes a new MILP formulation\nthat represents an acyclic chemical graph G𝐺G with n𝑛n vertices,\nwhere our MILP requires only\nO​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) variables and constraints\nwhen the branch-parameter k𝑘k and the k𝑘k-branch-height in G𝐺G\n(graph topological parameters newly introduced in this paper) is constant.\nSection 5 describes the idea of our new\ndynamic programming type of algorithm\nthat enumerates a given number of acyclic chemical graphs\nfor a given feature vector.\nSection 6 reports the results on some computational\nexperiments conducted for s chemical properties\nsuch as octanol/water partition coefficient,\nboiling point and\nheat of combustion.\nSection 7 makes some concluding remarks.\nAppendix A provides the statistical feature on\nstructure of acyclic chemical graphs in a chemical graph database.\nAppendix B describes the details of all variables and constraints\nin our MILP formulation.\nAppendix C presents descriptions of our new graph search algorithm.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: functions   7.\nInference or enumeration of graph structures from a given feature vector\nis a crucial subtask in many of such methods.\nVarious methods have been developed for this enumeration problem\n[ref]6   \nand the computational complexity of the inference problem has\nbeen analyzed  4.\nOn the other hand, enumeration in itself is a challenging task,\nsince the number of\nmolecules (i.e., chemical\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
