      "content": "Paper Title: Active Generation for Image Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe diffusion model, originally introduced by [ref]41, is based on principles derived from non-equilibrium thermodynamics. This model was initially proposed to establish the feasibility of sampling from a complex probabilistic distribution, thereby establishing the fundamental framework. The model was subsequently enhanced by DDPM [ref]21, which introduced variational inference for training and incorporated a parametrized neural network as a denoiser in the backward diffusion process. The log-likelihood score of the DDPM may not adequately capture the distribution of real data. As a solution, DDIM  was introduced to incorporate a learned variance for diffusion sampling. State-of-the-art generative diffusion models, such as stable diffusion [ref]35, GLIDE , DALLE-3 , and Imagen , have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities by producing text-conditioned high-fidelity photo-realistic synthetic samples. The controllability by ensuring that the generated image content aligns with the input prompt can also be regarded as a constraint, compelling the generated content to be relevant to the provided class label. This allows generating images that are related to specific classes for image classification tasks. One significant concern arises from the fact that models are trained on diverse datasets, leading to variations in their generative capabilities across different subjects.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: The diffusion model, originally introduced by [ref]41, is based on principles derived from non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
