      "content": "Paper Title: Tiny Adversarial Multi-Objective Oneshot Neural Architecture Search\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIt is well known that deep neural networks are vulnerable to attacks that add small perturbations to the input data, which are almost imperceptible to human vision systems  [ref]2. The maliciously perturbed examples are commonly obtained by two operations. One is to add pixel-wise ϵ−limit-fromitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-bounded perturbations to the input data [ref]3. The other operation is to generate examples using the unrestricted perturbation like rotation, spatially translations\n. In this work, we focus on defensive mechanisms against the former, although they can be extended to the latter. To defend the attacks, current research [3, 8, afs] constantly adopt ResNet [ref]9 as the backbone network to  explore the relationship between the capacity of the model and its adversarial robustness.  It has been empirically proved that increasing the number of parameters of neural networks is able to improve robustness. However, little research pays attention to the improvement on robustness of tiny neural networks, which are widely used for mobile applications. Their sizes typically range from 10K to 2M. Therefore, our work focuses on the balance between the adversarial defensive ability and tiny model size. The trade-off between the adversarial accuracy and the clean accuracy have been examined in 0. The work in 0 uses one specific binary classifier to illustrate the trade-off, which can be easily generalized to multi-class problems with different assumptions 2. Previous work have illustrated the importance of the network architecture for adversarial robustness [ref]3 . Most of them add a specific layer to the existing architecture to increase the adversarial accuracy, which, however, do not take into account the potential relationship between different layers in the whole neural network architecture. Our aim is to find the best trade-off neural networks with respect to the clean accuracy, the adversarial accuracy and tiny model size. Hence, we need to take a global view to redesign tiny neural networks. Our assumption is that designing a tiny robust neural network without the loss of clean accuracy can be transformed into a combinational optimization problem of different layers with what kinds of blocks and channels. Hence, we propose a tiny adversarial multi-objective oneshot network architecture search (TAM-NAS) to search the best trade-off solutions. There are different defensive training strategies for adversarial attacks. The most common approach [ref]2 is to train neural networks on adversarial examples. Recently, another popular approach is to formulate adversarial training as a min-max robust optimization problem [ref]3 . The inner maximization problem is to find the worst performance in the presence of perturbations in the input data and the outer minimization problem is to find the optimal model parameters given the worst-case perturbation. The state-of-the-art defensive result is reported in 2, which proposes a new classification-calibrated surrogate loss function to simultaneously minimize the clean error and the boundary error. The boundary error refers to the neural network output differences between the original input data and adversarial examples. But the major issue of adversarial training is the high computational cost for adversarial training. To speed up our adversarial training for each epoch, we use TRADES-YOPO-m-n from 7 as our adversarial training method. TRADES-YOPO-m-n aims not only to incorporate the surrogate loss function from 2 but also to reduce the computational cost by restricting most of forward and backward propagations within the first layer of the network during adversary training. As a result, we are able to reduce the training time to 2.5 minutes for each epoch on a single V100 GPU platform. Human experts make tons of effort to devise several classical architectures, such as ResNet [ref]9 and Inception 8. But it is not feasible to manually explore an infinite number of architectures. As an emerging automated machine learning technique, neural network architecture search (NAS)   is prevalent because it requires much less expertise and effort to discover good architectures for a new task and dataset. Most NAS approaches employ reinforcement learning , evolutionary algorithms , and gradient-based methods  to design neural networks automatically. However, most of them treat it as a single-objective optimization problem, which is not well suited for solving the trade-off problem. Inspired by the work in [29, MRL, modulenet], we employ a multi-objective approach based NAS to find the best architecture for the trade-off solutions between the adversarial accuracy, the clean accuracy and the mode size. In our work, we mainly address the trade-off problem based on the ShuffleNetV2 architecture , Xception block , SE layer , Non-Local block , and their variants. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: To find the best trade-off neural networks between the adversarial accuracy, the clean accuracy and the model size, we specifically propose three novel tiny robust blocks. Due to the inertial self-attention mechanism, the layer-wise combination of these three blocks can increase robustness without significantly worsening clean performance. We explore a new adversarial training paradigm for the supernet. Because the subnets highly rely on the supernet in oneshot NAS, the adversarial performance of the subnets could be further improved by using our proposed training paradigm. To this end, we analyse how the width of supernet, the perturbation range and the number of attack steps for the supernet adversarial training affect the performance of the subnets. We seamlessly integrate multi-objective search algorithm with one-shot NAS algorithm. After finishing the search procedure, we can directly obtain the non-dominated front which can speed up finding the best trade-off subnets. In addition, we discover that training from scratch outperforms fine-tuning for the non-dominated subnets. We draw a conclusion about how to design a tiny robust neural network. Firstly, the robust blocks, i.e. pure robust blocks and tiny robust blocks should be put into the shallow layers while pure tiny blocks should be put into the deep layers. Secondly, larger intermediate channels should be put into the shallow layers and the intermediate channels should gradually decline in the rest of layers. Finally, we rebuild a tiny neural network according to the provided guideline and find that it can not only reduces the model size but also increases the adversarial accuracy and clean accuracy.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: It is well known that deep neural networks are vulnerable to attacks that add small perturbations to the input data, which are almost imperceptible to human vision systems  [ref]2.
