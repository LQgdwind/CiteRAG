Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

Additionally, regardless of the attack complexity or method, the challenging images remain consistent. If one attack requires a high distortion for a given input / source / target, other attacks are likely to encounter similar difficulties. Traditional white box attack.\nWe now compare the methods designed for transferability with a naive approach.\nA white box attack (ie. not specific to transferability) is executed on the source, and then the direction found serves as ux,ssubscriptùë¢ùë•ùë†u_{x,s} to place the adversarial examples on the target boundary with¬†(5).\nThe best T^s,tsubscript^ùëáùë†ùë°\\hat{T}_{s,t} score is 0.27 for BP¬†[ref]35 compared to 0.52 for DI¬†[ref]32.\nThis confirms the superiority of the recent methods designed for transferability.\nHowever, even though DI¬†[ref]32 is on average better, Figure¬†5 shows that when the necessary distortion is small, traditional white box attacks like DeepFool¬† and BP¬†[ref]35 indeed beats DI¬†[ref]32. On the other hand, DI¬†[ref]32 performs much better for inputs requiring more distortion.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: attacks with a 2D histogram of the distortion pair for two attacks.\nThis is computed over all inputs in ùí≥ùí≥\\mathcal{X} and all pairs of source and target models.\nThe results show that DWP¬†[ref]26 exhibits poor transferability compared to DI¬†[ref]32 and TAIG¬†, which produce adversarial perturbations with similar distortion.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
