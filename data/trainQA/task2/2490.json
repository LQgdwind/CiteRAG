      "content": "Paper Title: “Excavating AI” Re-excavated: Debunking a Fallacious Account of the JAFFE Dataset\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOne of the most striking of the ‘implied claims’ in “Excavating AI” concerns the purported ability to read ‘true emotional state’ or ‘interior state’ from images of posed facial expressions. As I have shown, our work made no claim to read internal states. Where did Crawford and Paglen get such ideas? Perhaps their imaginations were stimulated by media reports of emotion reading software and the websites of affective computing startups? Here are some press headlines and excerpts from company web pages: Apple Buys Emotient, a Company That Uses AI to Read Emotions  …Startup That Can Read Your Face To Tell If You’re Angry [ref]52 AI Can Read Your Emotions. Should it?  Human Perception AI. Our software detects all things human: nuanced emotions, complex cognitive states…131313Affectiva homepage: https://www.affectiva.com/ (accessed July 12, 2021). My first encounter with this genre of publicity dates to about 2006, when the New York Times reported  on a project by Rana el Kaliouby and Rosalind Picard of the MIT Media Lab, who would found the startup Affectiva a few years later . The article described an “Emotional-Social Intelligence Prosthesis” that promised to augment an autistic user’s ability to ‘mind read’ by providing facial expression recognition support. Some might naïvely misinterpret the mention of mind reading as an ‘implied claim’ hinting at telepathy or phrenology. It is nothing of the kind: the project and el Kaliouby’s earlier Ph.D. thesis  drew on the Theory of Mind theory of cognitive science—the hypothesis that we use folk psychology to make inferences about the beliefs and intentions of other beings    . The New York Times report mentioned Simon Baron-Cohen, who proposed a model of autism based on the Theory of Mind theory   and was one of el Kaliouby’s thesis advisors. I was impressed by el Kaliouby’s ambitious attempt to model facial expression perception more meaningfully than the image classification studies still commonplace. At the same time, I was uncomfortable with the anthropomorphic description of computer software. I expressed my reservations at conferences in Tokyo in 2007 4141414The Fechner Day, 2007 conference mentioned in footnote 12. and in Amsterdam in 2008 5.151515IEEE Face and Gesture Conference, Workshop on Facial and Bodily Expressions for Control and Adaptation of Games, Amsterdam, NL, September 16, 2008. My skepticism was twofold. First, as mentioned above, the term ‘mind reading’ has alternative quasi-magical connotations likely to mislead the popular imagination. The researchers could have avoided potential misunderstandings by describing their work as, for example, a computational model of the theory of mind, which would be accurate though less sensational. Second, there were practical difficulties involved in interpreting facial displays. My presentations in Tokyo and Amsterdam gave a simple demonstration161616See the Amsterdam presentation slides: https://zenodo.org/record/4026982. showing that the crucial role played by context would be difficult to take into account generally. Barring a solution of the hard AI problem, one did not expect ‘mind reading’ systems to function except in rather constrained situations. Indeed, as late as 2011, after several years of further development, Affectiva’s technology was still having difficulty distinguishing some types of grimace from smiles . Affectiva evolved and is valued by investors and clients in the automotive, marketing, and advertising industries, but Shoshana Zuboff argues that, despite initial good intentions, Affectiva was drawn into “surveillance capitalism’s powerful force field.”171717Chapter 9, section III, “Machine Emotion,” of The Age of Surveillance Capitalism . I wonder if the outcome would have been more benign had el Kaliouby continued to pursue the computational modelling of the Theory of Mind theory scientifically rather than commercially?\n\nReference markers found: [52]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]52: startups?
