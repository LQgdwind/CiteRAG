      "content": "Paper Title: GraphGANFed: A Federated Generative Framework for Graph-Structured Molecules Towards Efficient Drug Discovery\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGCNs have been applied in various drug discovery applications such as biological property , quantum mechanical property , interaction prediction [ref]33 [ref]34, synthesis prediction , and de novo molecular design [ref]11. In , a graph convolutional framework was proposed to learn the molecular representations using both node and edge features. Each layer is comprised of atoms (nodes) in a molecule and pair-wise representations. The framework uses a Weave unit to establish relations between different layers through propagation between atoms to atoms, atoms to pairs, pairs to atoms, and pairs to pairs. Every layer adopts the weave unit architecture, except for the last convolution layer where only the atom representations are utilized for down-streaming applications, such as estimating solubility or drug efficacy. The framework uses neural networks to model the transitions over the same representations (i.e., atom-atom and pair-pair). However, for the transitions over different representations (i.e., atom-pair and pair-atom), an additional order-invariant aggregation operation is used for the feature transition. The inputs of the graph convolutional framework are molecular graphs containing atoms and bond features. The authors evaluated their proposed framework for biological activities on 259 data sets consisting of PubChem BioAssay (PCBA) , the training set for the Tox21 challenge , the enhanced directory of useful decoys , and the ‚Äúmaximum unbiased validation‚Äù data sets built by Rohrer and Baumann , in a multi-task setting where biological activities are predicted. However, the results show that the proposed framework did not always outperform the baseline methods that used Morgan fingerprints. In [ref]11, the authors proposed a framework named GraphVAE for molecular generations, which directly generates a probabilistic fully-connected graph with a predefined maximum size. GraphVAE is based on the variational autoencoder method, where the stochastic graph encoder is used to process discrete attributed graphs G=(A,E,F)ùê∫ùê¥ùê∏ùêπG=(A,E,F), representing the adjacency matrix Aùê¥A, edge attribute tensor Eùê∏E, and node attribute tensor FùêπF with a predefined number of nodes. The encoder is implemented by a feed-forward network with edge-conditioned graph convolutions. The stochastic graph encoder embeds the graphs into a continuous representation zùëßz. The graph decoder outputs a probabilistic fully-connected graph on the predefined nodes, where the discrete samples can be drawn. To ensure that the output graph matches the ground truth, they used a standard matching algorithm to align the output graph to the ground truth. GraphVAE was evaluated based on two molecular data sets, QM9 and ZINC, and the results demonstrated that it can learn appropriate embedding properties for small molecules, but it is difficult to capture complex chemical interactions for larger molecules. All the above existing works about molecular generation and drug discovery are performed in a centralized setting which results in mode collapse and hinders the ability of the models to generalize on diverse datasets. Our proposed framework aims to solve this model collapse and diversity issues in the centralized setting by ensuring that models are trained in a federated setting without sharing the client dataset thus preserving data privacy.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: GCNs have been applied in various drug discovery applications such as biological property , quantum mechanical property , interaction prediction [ref]33 [ref]34, synthesis prediction , and de novo molecular design [ref]11.
