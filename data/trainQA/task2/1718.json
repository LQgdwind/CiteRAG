Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

[ref]38 showed that such a model pretrained for image recognition already encodes some saliency information, which we expected to speed up the learning process with regard to spatial identification. The default weights of ResNet were set to their pretrained values on ImageNet . The ResNet architecture was tuned . Its input layer was set to fit the generated image resolution, and two successive dense layers were added after its output to fit the required number of classes for prediction.\nWe consider the identification of the outlier as a classification problem rather than a regression problem, where there would be a notion of distance between the predictions and their ground truths.\nThe size of the last dense layer was therefore set to predict the outlier position, i.e., to predict 646464 classes, and the size of the penultimate dense layer was set to 1024. While the optimizer and default tuning of the learning phase were not modified, the batch size was set to 646464 (instead of 256256256).\nWe used the early stopping function of the Keras library  with a patience of 15 epochs to end the training process.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: than an architecture dedicated to the task(s) (or visualization technique(s)) to be studied.\nTo that extent and following the recommendation of , we tried several network architectures (e.g., LeNet [ref]36 and VGG-16/19 [ref]37) and selected ResNet (from He et al. ) as it correctly learned to solve the task.\nHe et al.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
