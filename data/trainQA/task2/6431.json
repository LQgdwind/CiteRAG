      "content": "Paper Title: Squeeze, Recover and Relabel: Dataset Condensation at ImageNet Scale From A New Perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nData condensation or distillation aims to create a compact synthetic dataset that preserves the essential information in the large-scale original dataset, making it easier to work with and reducing training time while achieving the comparable performance to the original dataset. Previous solutions are mainly divided into four categories: Meta-Model Matching optimizes for the transferability of models trained on the condensed data and uses an outer-loop to update the synthetic data when generalized to the original dataset with an inner-loop to train the network, methods include DD , KIP , RFAD [ref]4, FRePo [ref]5 and LinBa 4; Gradient Matching performs a one-step distance matching process on the network trained on original dataset and the same network trained on the synthetic data, methods include DC , DSA 2, DCC [ref]9 and IDC ; Distribution Matching directly matches the distribution of original data and synthetic data with a single-level optimization, methods include DM , CAFE , HaBa 5, IT-GAN 6, KFS [ref]9; Trajectory Matching matches the training trajectories of models trained on original and synthetic data in multiple steps, methods include MTT  and TESLA 1. Our proposed decoupling method presents a new perspective for tackling this task, while our BN-matching recovering procedure can also be considered as a special format of Distribution Matching scheme on the synthetic data and global BN statistics distributions.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: trained on the condensed data and uses an outer-loop to update the synthetic data when generalized to the original dataset with an inner-loop to train the network, methods include DD , KIP , RFAD [ref]4, FRePo [ref]5 and LinBa 4; Gradient Matching performs a one-step distance matching process on the network trained on original dataset and the same network trained on the synthetic data,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
