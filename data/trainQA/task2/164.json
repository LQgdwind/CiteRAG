      "content": "Paper Title: Tree Polymatrix Games are \\PPAD-hard\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA polymatrix game is a succinctly represented many-player game. The\nplayers are represented by vertices in an interaction graph, where each\nedge of the graph specifies a two-player game that is to be played by the\nadjacent vertices. Each player picks a pure strategy, or action, and\nthen plays that action in all of the edge-games that they are involved with.\nThey then receive the\nsum of the payoffs from each of those games. A Nash equilibrium\nprescribes a mixed strategy to each player, with the property that no player has\nan incentive to unilaterally deviate from their assigned strategy. Constant-action polymatrix games have played a central role in the study of\nequilibrium computation. The classical \\PPAD-hardness result for finding Nash\nequilibria in bimatrix games  uses constant-action polymatrix games as\nan intermediate step in the reduction [ref]5 . Rubinstein later showed\nthat there exists a constant ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon>0 such that computing an ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-approximate\nNash equilibrium in two-action bipartite polymatrix games is\n\\PPAD-hard , which\nwas the first result of its kind to give hardness for constant ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon. These hardness results create polymatrix games whose interaction\ngraphs contain cycles. This has lead researchers to study acyclic polymatrix\ngames, with the hope of finding tractable cases. Kearns, Littman, and Singh\nclaimed to produce a polynomial-time algorithm for finding a Nash equilibrium in\na two-action tree graphical game , where graphical games are a\nslight generalization of polymatrix games.\nHowever, their algorithm does not work, which was pointed out by Elkind,\nGoldberg, and Goldberg , who also showed that the\nnatural fix gives an exponential-time algorithm. Elkind, Goldberg, and Goldberg also\nshow that a Nash equilibrium can be found in polynomial time for two-action\ngraphical games whose interaction graphs contain only paths and cycles. They\nalso show that finding a Nash equilibrium is \\PPAD-hard when the interaction\ngraph has pathwidth at most four, but there appears to be some issues with their\napproach (see Appendix A).\nLater work of Barman, Ligett, and Piliouras  provided a QPTAS for\nconstant-action tree polymatrix games, and then Ortiz and Irfan 3 gave\nan FPTAS for this case.\nAll three papers,   3, leave as a main open problem the question\nof whether it is possible to find a Nash\nequilibrium in a tree polymatrix in polynomial time. Our contribution.\nIn this work we show that finding a Nash equilibrium in twenty-action tree\npolymatrix games is \\PPAD-hard.\nCombined with the known \\PPADcontainment of\npolymatrix games [ref]5, this implies that the problem is \\PPAD-complete.\nThis is the first hardness result for polymatrix\n(or graphical) games in which the interaction graph is acyclic, and decisively\ncloses the open question raised by prior work: tree polymatrix games cannot be solved\nin polynomial time unless \\PPADis equal to 𝙿𝙿\\mathtt{P}. Our reduction produces a particularly simple class of interaction graphs: all of\nour games are played on caterpillar graphs (see\nFigure 3) which consist of a single path with small one-vertex\nbranches affixed to every node. These graphs have pathwidth 111, so\nwe obtain a stark contrast with prior work: two-action path polymatrix games can\nbe solved in polynomial time , but twenty-action pathwidth-1-caterpillar\npolymatrix games are \\PPAD-hard. Our approach is founded upon Mehta’s proof that 2D-LinearFIXP is\n\\PPAD-hard 2. We show that her reduction can be implemented by a\nsynchronous arithmetic circuit with constant width. We then embed the\nconstant-width circuit into a caterpillar polymatrix game, where each player in\nthe game is responsible for simulating all gates at a particular level of the\ncircuit. This differs from previous hardness results [ref]5 , where\neach player is responsible for simulating exactly one gate from the circuit. Along the way, we also substantially strengthen Mehta’s hardness result for\n𝙻𝚒𝚗𝚎𝚊𝚛𝙵𝙸𝚇𝙿𝙻𝚒𝚗𝚎𝚊𝚛𝙵𝙸𝚇𝙿\\mathtt{LinearFIXP}. She showed \\PPAD-hardness for finding an exact fixed point of a\n2D-LinearFIXP instance, and an ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-fixed point of a kD-LinearFIXP instance, where\nϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon is polynomially small. We show \\PPAD-hardness for finding an ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-fixed\npoint of a 2D-LinearFIXP instance when ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon is any constant less than\n(2−1)/2≈0.20712120.2071(\\sqrt{2}-1)/2\\approx 0.2071. So we have lifted the hardness regime from\npolynomially small approximations in k𝑘k-dimensions to constant approximations\nin two-dimensions, and our constant is substantial when compared to the trivial\nupper bound of 0.50.50.5. Related work. The class\n\\PPADwas defined by Papadimitriou 4.\nYears later, Daskalakis, Goldberg, and\nPapadimitriou (DGP) [ref]5 proved \\PPAD-hardness for graphical games and 3-player\nnormal form games. Chen, Deng, and Teng (CDT)  extended this result to\n2-player games and proved that there is no FPTAS for the problem unless\n\\PPAD=𝙿\\PPAD𝙿\\PPAD=\\mathtt{P}. The observations made by CDT imply that\nDGP’s result also holds for polymatrix games with constantly-many actions\n(but with cycles in the interaction graph) for an exponentially small ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon.\nMore recently, Rubinstein 6 showed\nthat there exists a constant ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon>0 such that computing an ϵ−N​Eitalic-ϵ𝑁𝐸\\epsilon-NE in\nbinary-action bipartite polymatrix games is \\PPAD-hard (again with\ncycles in the interaction graph). Etessami and Yiannakakis 0 defined the classes 𝙵𝙸𝚇𝙿𝙵𝙸𝚇𝙿\\mathtt{FIXP} and 𝙻𝚒𝚗𝚎𝚊𝚛𝙵𝙸𝚇𝙿𝙻𝚒𝚗𝚎𝚊𝚛𝙵𝙸𝚇𝙿\\mathtt{LinearFIXP} and\nthey proved that 𝙻𝚒𝚗𝚎𝚊𝚛𝙵𝙸𝚇𝙿=\\PPAD𝙻𝚒𝚗𝚎𝚊𝚛𝙵𝙸𝚇𝙿\\PPAD\\mathtt{LinearFIXP}=\\PPAD. Mehta 2 strengthened these\nresults by proving that two-dimensional 𝙻𝚒𝚗𝚎𝚊𝚛𝙵𝙸𝚇𝙿𝙻𝚒𝚗𝚎𝚊𝚛𝙵𝙸𝚇𝙿\\mathtt{LinearFIXP} equals \\PPAD,\nbuilding on the result of Chen and Deng who proved that 2D-discrete Brouwer is\n\\PPAD-hard . On the positive side, Cai and Daskalakis , proved that NE can be\nefficiently found in polymatrix games where every 2-player game is zero-sum.\nOrtiz and Irfan 3 and Deligkas, Fearnley, and Savani \nproduced QPTASs for polymatrix games of bounded treewidth (in addition to the\nFPTAS of 3 for tree polymatrix games mentioned above). For general\npolymatrix games, the only positive result to date is a polynomial-time\nalgorithm to compute a (12+δ)12𝛿(\\frac{1}{2}+\\delta)-NE . Finally, an\nempirical study on algorithms for exact and approximate NE in polymatrix games\ncan be found in [ref]6.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: study of\nequilibrium computation.
