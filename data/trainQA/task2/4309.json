      "content": "Paper Title: Leveraging Log Instructions in Log-based Anomaly Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere exist multiple methods for the automation of log-based anomaly detection    . From the perspective of target-system log labels availability, the methods are categorized into supervised and unsupervised. The supervised methods assume the existence of labels from the target system when learning a model. In one of the earliest applications of these methods, Bodik et al.  applied Logistic Regression (LR) to successfully detect anomalies in data centres, by treating the problem as a binary classification. Decision Trees (DT)  were utilized in the detection of anomalous web requests from access logs. These two methods start by log parsing to extract events and then use count vectors in a fixed time interval as input samples. The recent advances in deep learning resulted in the appearance of several supervised deep-learning-based methods, e.g., LogRobust , and CNN . LogRobust uses the LSTM architecture, augmented with attention. These two are popular deep learning architectures frequently combined for sequence modeling. LogRobust, as input, receives a sequence of events, and as output, it predicts if the observed sequence is anomalous or not. By careful sequence construction, i.e., by incremental sliding over the log sequences by one element, it can be used to predict single log lines . An additional feature of LogRobust is using vector embeddings from general-purpose languages to represent the logs. Lu et al.  use Convolutions Neural Networks (CNN), another type of deep learning architecture, to learn normal and abnormal sequences from template indices. Similar to LogRobust, CNN can be used to detect anomalies from a single log. While having strong detection performance, the large frequency of the software updates and the large volume of the produced logs make the labeling process expensive. Therefore, supervised methods are frequently considered impractical [ref]6. In contrast, the unsupervised methods do not assume the existence of labeled data. This has an important practical implication because it eliminates the need for expensive labeling. Therefore, the unsupervised anomaly detection methods are easier to adopt. In one of the earliest works on unsupervised anomaly detection, Xu et al. apply PCA  to learn the normal state of the event counts by projecting them as points in a vector space. In the test phase, the test sample is projected in the constructed vector space and reported as an anomaly if the projection significantly deviates from the learned normal state. Lin et al.  introduce LogCluster which uses the TFIDF algorithm for sequence representation. It first constructs a knowledge base of normal/anomalous sequence clusters by agglomerative clustering and human-based cluster labeling (normal or anomalous). A test sample is detected as an anomaly if it is clustered into anomalous clusters. DeepLog  and LogAnomaly [ref]29 are two popular unsupervised deep learning-based methods. The innovative feature of the two is the introduction of an auxiliary task called ”next event prediction” (NEP). NEP is a supervised task that given a sequence of events, forecasts the most probable next event. Notably, the labels originate from the input data itself, i.e., no labeling is performed, which makes the methods unsupervised. The test sequences with an incorrect prediction for the next event are considered anomalous. As stated by the authors, DeepLog can be applied for sequential and single logs given as inputs. To learn the normal state, an LSTM architecture is trained on the NEP task. LogAnomaly has two additional features: 1) it uses log semantics and 2) event counts in joint training a DeepLog-like model. The empirical results show that the improvements over DeepLog are not significant  [ref]29. Unsupervised methods are often criticized for their lower performance in comparison to the supervised ones [ref]6 leading to alarm fatigue and discouraging their wide applicability. In addition, there are other methods for log-based anomaly detection in both industry and research [ref]30  . However, those solutions are part of production systems  or have specific implementation challenges while do not provide public implementations   [ref]30. Due to the inability of transparent comparison, we do not discuss them in detail.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: the large frequency of the software updates and the large volume of the produced logs make the labeling process expensive.
