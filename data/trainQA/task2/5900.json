Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: LAHM : Large Annotated Dataset for Multi-Domain and Multilingual Hate Speech Identification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere have been several studies on abusive language detection [ref]1 , offensive language, hate speech identification, toxicity [ref]4, hatefulness , aggression , attack , racism, sexism , obscenity, threats, and insults. Along with that, there are several shared tasks that have focused on abusive language and hate speech detection such as HASOC-2019 , TRAC shared task on aggression identification , HatEval  and GermEval-2018 which focused on offensive language identification in German tweets. Waseem proposed the following list to identify hate\nspeech. Their criteria are partially derived by negating the privileges observed in McIntosh (2003),\nwhere they occur as ways to highlight importance,\nensure an audience, and ensure safety for white\npeople, and partially derived from applying common sense.\nA tweet is categorized as offensive if it: uses a sexist or racial slur. attacks a minority. seeks to silence a minority. criticizes a minority (without a well founded\nargument). promotes, but does not directly use, hate\nspeech or violent crime. criticizes a minority and uses a straw man argument. blatantly misrepresents truth or seeks to distort views on a minority with unfounded\nclaims. shows support of problematic hash tags - “#BanIslam”, “#whoriental”, “#whitegenocide” negatively stereotypes a minority. defends xenophobia or sexism. contains a screen name that is offensive, as\nper the previous criteria, the tweet is ambiguous (at best), and the tweet is on a topic that\nsatisfies any of the above criteria. Wide variety of machine learning models have been used to deal with multi-domain hate speech detection task. Some studies use traditional machine learning approaches such as, logistic regression , support vector machine  , linear support vector machine classifiers (LSVC)   . They used it for better explainability, along with several deep learning based models, including convolutions neural networks [ref]18 , LSTM 0 [ref]18   1, bidirectional LSTM 2.\nMost recent works focus on transfer learning and novel architectures involving Transformers based models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) 3 4 5 6 7 and its variants like RoBERTa 5 in the cross-domain abusive language detection task. For cross-lingual abusive language detection, most studies utilized transformers based models. Some traditional models used such as logistic regression 8  9, linear support vector machines  , SVM 0,\nLSTM 1 9 and Bi-LSTMs 1 have also been used.\nRecent work focused on several transformer based architectures such as multilingual BERT 2 8 5  3 4 9, RoBERTa 5, XLM 1 4 and XLM-RoBERTa 5 5 6.\nTransformers based models with multilingual language representations can easily deal with language shift in zero-shot cross-lingual task.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: There have been several studies on abusive language detection [ref]1 , offensive language, hate speech identification, toxicity [ref]4, hatefulness , aggression , attack , racism, sexism , obscenity, threats, and insults.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
