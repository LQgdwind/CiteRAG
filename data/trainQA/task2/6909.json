      "content": "Paper Title: FedCiR: Client-Invariant Representation Learning for Federated Non-IID Features\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith\nthe ever-increasing popularity and deployment of edge devices, there is a tremendous amount of data generated by users on a daily basis.\nThese data hold valuable insights that can be utilized to enhance various artificial intelligence (AI) applications and services.\nHowever, with the increasing privacy concerns as well as the enormous communication costs, reckless data collection and centralized training are no longer acceptable.\nServing as an efficient and privacy-preserving training paradigm, federated learning (FL) enables distributed devices to collaboratively train a global model without revealing their private data.\nThe classical FL approach, represented by FedAvg [ref]1, has successfully demonstrated its potential in edge-AI tasks, such as autonomous driving , virtual reality (VR) services , and unmanned aerial vehicle control . One major obstacle to efficient FL is the data heterogeneity among devices, i.e., the data across devices are non-independently and identically distributed (non-IID).\nIt has been verified that FL algorithms often suffer from degraded accuracy and slow convergence with non-IID data, which are inherently caused by deflected local updates and local optima  [ref]6 [ref]7.\nThe non-IID issue in FL can be classified into two categories: label shift and feature shift .\nLabel shift arises when clients have different distributions of class labels, even if the input feature space is the same. Feature shift, on the other hand, occurs when the underlying distributions of input features vary across clients, despite having a common label space.\nIn this work, we focus on the feature shift problem , which typically arises in healthcare  and wildlife protection applications  because of the device and environmental discrepancy.\nFor example, in wildlife protection applications where the cameras are placed in different locations to capture images of wildlife, the images from these cameras are different in tonality, rendering them skewed in features.\nThese discrepancies are primarily caused by distinct environmental conditions like weather and illumination levels. To solve the feature shift problem in FL, many studies proposed to introduce local constraints with the knowledge of the global model or gradient information for clients, whereby the discrepancy between local updates is mitigated.\nThese methods, however, focused on the algorithmic aspect and only achieved limited performance gains with heavy data heterogeneity .\nMeanwhile, another stream of studies endeavored to solve the feature-shift issue through synthetic data augmentation    , but sharing extra synthetic data among clients inevitably leads to data privacy leakage.\nIn addition, explicit feature alignment among clients is another effective technique to solve the feature shift problem  .\nBy sharing and aggregating local features as global features, clients can align the local features with the global features, thereby reaching a common feature space for solving the feature shift problem.\nNevertheless, the local features remain susceptible to overfitting with heterogeneous data distributions, resulting in biased global features after aggregation. The feature shift problem has been extensively studied in classical centralized training, particularly in the context of domain adaptation and domain generalization  0, which aim to transfer the knowledge of labeled source domains to a different target domain.\nMany studies have established the generalization error bounds of the target domain on the source domains, using the source risk and the discrepancy between source and target domains.\nThese bounds provide sufficient conditions to reduce the error on the domain dataset and thus address the centralized feature-skewed issue.\nConsequently, many works 1 2 have employed domain-invariant representation learning to reduce the generalization bound for better domain adaptation and generalization.\nHowever, the bounds derived in centralized settings are incompatible with FL since the source domains are distributed across clients.\nWith private distributed data, all the existing domain-invariant representation methods for domain adaptation lose their effectiveness without the access to all the data domains during the training process.\nTherefore, it is critical to analyze the intrinsic causes of the feature-skewed issue in FL and propose effective methods to address it accordingly. In this work, we first develop a generalization error bound for the global mixture dataset on local datasets in FL, which identifies two key factors for addressing the feature shift issue: the empirical local risks and the ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}-divergence between global and local datasets.\nMotivated by this analysis, we propose a federated client-invariant representation learning algorithm, called FedCiR, to reduce the generalization error bound by encouraging local models to extract informative and client-invariant features from an information-theoretic perspective.\nSpecifically, FedCiR introduces two mutual information terms. The first term promotes features to be informative by maximizing the mutual information between representations and labels, which addresses the information-insufficient issue in local models caused by the limited data. The second term diminishes the mutual information between the client set and representations conditioned on labels, which advances representations across clients to be client-invariant. To integrate these mutual information objectives into FL, we develop two regularizers that bound the objectives using an approximate global representation distribution. Such an approximation is needed since the ground truth distribution is unknown in FL. To achieve this approximation without compromising privacy, we propose a novel data-free mechanism using a generator, which is trained to maximize the consensus between local classifiers at the server. The first proposed regularization enhances the global view for local client representations, while the second explicitly aligns global and local distributions, ensuring representations retain just the client-invariant information needed.\nFigure 1 depicts the main idea of the proposed method.\nThe main contributions of this work are summarized as follows: To provide a theoretical foundation for addressing the non-IID issue in FL, we establish a generalization error bound between the global and local datasets, which motivates us to propose a federated client-invariant representation learning algorithm, called FedCiR. We propose two mutual information terms to achieve informative and client-invariant representation extraction, respectively, and introduce two regularization terms based on an approximate global representation distribution to bound the mutual information terms, which can be employed in FL and encourages local representations to capture more label-discriminative and client-invariant information. We propose a data-free mechanism to approximate the global representation distribution by using a generative network to ensure the consistency of local classifiers at the server, which protects the privacy as strict as FedAvg. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets, which demonstrate that FedCiR consistently outperforms baselines in accuracy without introducing additional overhead for clients, and confirm its effectiveness in client-invariant representation learning. Organization: The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the related works on the non-IID problem in FL and domain-invariant representation learning. Section\n3 describes the feature shift problem in FL, and Section 4 illustrates the fundamental causes of the feature shift problem with a federated generalization error bound.\nWe propose a class-discriminative and client-invariant representation learning method for FL (FedCiR) and a data-free mechanism for global representation distribution approximation to achieve FedCiR in Section 5.\nWe evaluate FedCiR via extensive simulations in Section 6.\nFinally, we conclude the paper in Section 7.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: training paradigm, federated learning (FL) enables distributed devices to collaboratively train a global model without revealing their private data.\nThe classical FL approach, represented by FedAvg [ref]1, has successfully demonstrated its potential in edge-AI tasks, such as autonomous driving , virtual reality (VR) services , and unmanned aerial vehicle control .
