As shown in Table I, our method establishes a new state of the art in self-supervised MDE, with competitive model complexity and inference speed.Compared with the best-performing single-frame method  and distillation learning based methods [ref]21 , our model improves the performance by more than 10.4%percent10.410.4\\% (on Abs. Rel. with the raw GT). Note that our method only adopts the same S-DepthNet as RA-Depth, but does not adopt the data augmentation strategy and the cross-scale depth consistency loss proposed in . The multi-frame depth estimation methods that perform closest to our method are DepthFormer  and MOVEDepth . Although neither using the computationally expensive transformer architecture  nor adopting the velocity-guided depth sampling strategy and additional depth fusing network , our model still outperforms these methods in all metrics. For a fair comparison with , we also list the results using the same ResNet18-based architecture (number of output scales S=4𝑆4S=4) for our method and , where our method still performs better. Furthermore, the bottom half of Table I shows that our method even compares favorably to some single-frame supervised methods  , and narrows the performance gap between self-supervised monocular training methods and the best-performing supervised approach . In addition, we also present the qualitative results in Fig. 2, where our method better preserves the shape of objects and outputs depth maps with smaller errors. Moreover, we also compare the results with the current state-of-the-art methods    on Cityscapes. As shown in Table II, our method performs best again, even though DynamicDepth  leverages semantic labels. “††{\\dagger}” means evaluation on the pretrained models from github.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: To evaluate the performance of our method, we first conduct a comparison of its performance relative to the state-of-the-art self-supervised MDE methods on KITTI with the raw [ref]1 and improved ground truth [ref]40.
