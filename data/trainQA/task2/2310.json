      "content": "Paper Title: A Survey on Deep Learning Event Extraction: Approaches and Applications\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nScript  is a chain of ordered events describing activities about a protagonist, and Script Event Prediction (SEP) aims to predict the subsequent event of a given chain from a candidate event list.\nAs an important task to understand the evolutionary patterns among events, SEP has supported various downstream applications, including anaphora resolution , story generation  and finalcial analysis .\nIn SEP, each event is represented in the form of a tuple e=v​(s,o,p)𝑒𝑣𝑠𝑜𝑝e=v(s,o,p), where v,s,o,p𝑣𝑠𝑜𝑝v,s,o,p are the event arguments respectively denoting the verb, subject, object and indirect-object of the event.\nFor example, e=g​i​v​e​(w​a​i​t​e​r,b​o​b,w​a​t​e​r)𝑒𝑔𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑤𝑎𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑏𝑜𝑏𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟e=give(waiter,bob,water) means that “A waiter gives bob water”.\nBy far, the most widely used benchmark for SEP is NYT dataset , where the event chains are extracted from the New York Times (NYT) portion of the Gigaword corpus .\nThe dataset consists 140,331/10,000/10,000 event chains for training/validation/test.\nEach event chain contains 8 events and has 5 candidate events where only one is the correct subsequent event.\nNext, we introduce the details about existing SEP works. Existing SEP works could be categorized into two groups.\nThe first line of works mainly focus on the event co-occurrence relation to predict the subsequent from three aspects.\nSpecifically, early works      model the event-pair-level semantic relation to predict the subsequent event of the given event chain.\nFurther, to alleviate semantics limitation to event chain, Lv et al.  regard the given event chain as a combination of several event-segments and capture clues from diverse event segments to facilitate the event prediction.\nIn the following, researchers encode the full event-chain    to grasp semantic signals to predict subsequent event.\nWang et al.  and Zheng et al.  also employ the graph structure to model the event chain.\nThe second line of works integrate external knowledge to help understand the scripts, since the absence of text contexts makes the semantics in scripts more sparse than normal texts.\nSpecifically, Ding et al.  utilize knowledge bases, Event2Mind [ref]245 and ATlas Of MachIne Commonsens (ATOMIC) , to refine sentiment and intention information to enrich the semantics of the script.\nFurther, Lv et al.  [ref]247 incorporate event knowledge base ASER (Activities, States, Events and their Relations)  to provide causal and temporal relations between events to predict the subsequent event, achieving great success in this task.\n\nReference markers found: [245]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]245: to help understand the scripts, since the absence of text contexts makes the semantics in scripts more sparse than normal texts.\nSpecifically, Ding et al.  utilize knowledge bases, Event2Mind [ref]245 and ATlas Of MachIne Commonsens (ATOMIC) , to refine sentiment and intention information to enrich the semantics of the script.\nFurther, Lv et al.  [ref]247 incorporate event knowledge base\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
