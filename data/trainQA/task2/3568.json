      "content": "Paper Title: Lane Detection with Versatile AtrousFormer and Local Semantic Guidance\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis section will discuss first the deep learning based lane detection methods. In general, the networks to conduct lane detection can be categorized into three classes, semantic segmentation based methods, detection based methods, and key point estimation based methods. Finally, the development of transformer in vision community is sketched. Semantic Segmentation Based Methods.In this kind of doings, lane detection is modeled as a per-pixel prediction task with an additional classification branch    4 5   . To improve performance, early they devise various enhancing mechanisms     5 and recently resort to feature aggregator modules 4 . The 5 uses the method of self-distillation to mine spatial properties of lanes. The  designs a new powerful backbone for lane detection. The authors in  4 use a in-layer, recurrent in four directions, and residual information passing mechanism to enhance the spatial feature representation, finally accommodating the thin and long lane shapes. Later,  mitigates these problems in a sparse gleaning way. Detection Based Methods. Motivated by the progresses in recent object detection based methods, lane detection research in this direction  [ref]20   can be classified as anchor-based  [ref]20 and anchor-free  . The  [ref]20 use beaming lines from either the bottom, left, right to propose primary candidates, and then predicts offset maps to fit the real line shape. However, they are struggling to free themselves from the constraints of anchors. In [ref]20, local cues are added to refine the problem. The works of   abandon this kind of doing and directly assume that lanes in the scenes can be modeled as a polynomial equation estimation problem. Although refreshing, they are infeasible to handle the complex scenes, due to overly relying on certain parameters. Key Point Estimation Based Methods. This approach     usually determines the sparse or dense key points belonging to lanes first via a branch, and simultaneously in other branches predicts their identities to cluster them into different instances. In  , the authors design a branched, multi-task network, including a binary segmentation branch and a identity embedding branch, to clustering key points into different lane instances in an end to end manner. However, in most cases it is suffered from occlusion problem. Therefore,   stack several hourglass modules to enhance the inference ability of the network to alleviate the problem. Recently,  proposes to use two affinity matrices to cluster the determined key points to further resolve the problem. Vision Transformers. The seq2seq Transformer is primarily proposed to resolve the problems long haunting around LSTM and various its posteriors, such as long-range information losing, weak semantic representation, and sequential inflexibility. Recently, researchers begin introducing it into vision community to enhance the feature representation of backbone. The Vision Transformer  is the primary one applying transformer structure on non-overlapping medium-size feature patches for image classification, to some degree achieving speed-accuracy balance. Later, one of its follow-ups swin transformer  uses window and shifting mechanisms at different scales, further alleviating the overdue computational problem and achieving good performance in different tasks. Others like   tinker it in various ways.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: Later,  mitigates these problems in a sparse gleaning way. Detection Based Methods.
