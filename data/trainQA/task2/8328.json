      "content": "Paper Title: Laplace Transform Interpretation of Differential Privacy\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we use Theorem 4.2 to prove an exactly-tight composition theorem for adaptive composition of a sequence of (εi,δi)subscript𝜀𝑖subscript𝛿𝑖(\\varepsilon_{i},\\delta_{i})-DP mechanisms. We begin with a variant of Kairouz et al. [ref]19’s result that the privacy profile δP|Q​(ε)subscript𝛿conditional𝑃𝑄𝜀\\delta_{P|Q}(\\varepsilon) under an (ε,δ)𝜀𝛿(\\varepsilon,\\delta)-DP point guarantee is dominated by the privacy profile of randomized response mechanism. Fix ε≥0𝜀0\\varepsilon\\geq 0 and δ∈[ref]0 [ref]1𝛿01\\delta\\in[ref]0 [ref]1. Suppose distributions P𝑃P and Q𝑄Q over ΩΩ\\Omega satisfy (ε,δ)𝜀𝛿(\\varepsilon,\\delta)-differential privacy. Then, where δRR​(t)subscript𝛿RR𝑡\\delta_{\\mathrm{RR}}(t) is the privacy profile of the randomized response mechanism ℳRRε,δsuperscriptsubscriptℳRR𝜀𝛿\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{RR}}^{\\varepsilon,\\delta}. Kairouz et al. [ref]19 do not express their notion of dominance in the same way as we do in Definition 3.2—they say distribution pair (P1,Q1)subscript𝑃1subscript𝑄1(P_{1},Q_{1}) dominates (P2,Q2)subscript𝑃2subscript𝑄2(P_{2},Q_{2}) if their trade-off curves satisfy Nonetheless, our notion of dominance and their notion is equivalent, which was established by  by showing that the privacy profile δPi|Qisubscript𝛿conditionalsubscript𝑃𝑖subscript𝑄𝑖\\delta_{P_{i}|Q_{i}} and the corresponding trade-off curve fPi|Qisubscript𝑓conditionalsubscript𝑃𝑖subscript𝑄𝑖f_{P_{i}|Q_{i}} are primal and dual with respect to Frenchel duality. We also provide a direct proof of Theorem 4.5 in the Appendix A.3. As a side note, observe that combining Theorem 4.5 with Theorem 3.5 gives a tight Rényi DP guarantee for a pure ε𝜀\\varepsilon-DP mechanism, which has recently attracted interest . Following the objective of this section, we use our Theorem 4.2 on the above worst-case privacy profile under (ε,δ)𝜀𝛿(\\varepsilon,\\delta)-DP point guarantees, resulting in an exactly-tight composition guarantee as stated below. For any εi≥0subscript𝜀𝑖0\\varepsilon_{i}\\geq 0, δi∈[ref]0 [ref]1subscript𝛿𝑖01\\delta_{i}\\in[ref]0 [ref]1 for i∈{1,⋯,k}𝑖1⋯𝑘i\\in\\{1,\\cdots,k\\}, the k𝑘k-fold composition of (εi,δi)subscript𝜀𝑖subscript𝛿𝑖(\\varepsilon_{i},\\delta_{i})-differentially private mechanisms satisfies (ε,δ⊗k​(ε))𝜀superscript𝛿tensor-productabsent𝑘𝜀(\\varepsilon,\\delta^{\\otimes k}(\\varepsilon))-DP for all ε𝜀\\varepsilon, defined recursively as with δ⊗0​(t)=[1−et]+superscript𝛿tensor-productabsent0𝑡subscriptdelimited-[]1superscript𝑒𝑡\\delta^{\\otimes 0}(t)=[1-e^{t}]_{+}. Theorem 4.6 introduces a convenient recursive method for computing compositions of heterogeneous DP guarantees. While this bound matches each of the ⌊k⌋𝑘\\lfloor k\\rfloor discrete (ε,δ)𝜀𝛿(\\varepsilon,\\delta)-DP values given by the optimal composition theorem from Kairouz et al. [19, Theorem 3.3], our result offers a continuous curve over all ε∈ℝ𝜀ℝ\\varepsilon\\in\\mathbb{R}. Consequently, for a given budget on δ𝛿\\delta, our bound provides a tighter limit on ε𝜀\\varepsilon than that of [ref]19, as shown in Figure 2. Furthermore, the recursion reduces to the following exact expression when composing homogeneous DP guarantees. For any ε≥0𝜀0\\varepsilon\\geq 0, δ∈[ref]0 [ref]1𝛿01\\delta\\in[ref]0 [ref]1, the k𝑘k-fold composition of (ε,δ)𝜀𝛿(\\varepsilon,\\delta)-DP mechanisms satisfies (ε,δ⊗k​(ε))𝜀superscript𝛿tensor-productabsent𝑘𝜀(\\varepsilon,\\delta^{\\otimes k}(\\varepsilon))-DP for all ε𝜀\\varepsilon, where Figure 2 illustrates the enhanced privacy quantification achieved by our bound for k𝑘k-fold composition of (ε,δ)𝜀𝛿(\\varepsilon,\\delta)-DP guarantees. We also compare our results with Google’s PLDAccountant  and Microsoft’s PRVAccountant , which utilize the Discrete Fast Fourier Transform. This comparison shows that our analytical approach closely matches the values approximated by these numerical methods. Additionally, through Figure 4 in the appendix, we show that these numerical methods can be unstable at edge case values and yield non-negligible gaps in their approximation.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: an exactly-tight composition theorem for adaptive composition of a sequence of (εi,δi)subscript𝜀𝑖subscript𝛿𝑖(\\varepsilon_{i},\\delta_{i})-DP mechanisms.
