      "content": "Paper Title: B’MOJO: Hybrid State Space Realizations of Foundation Models with Eidetic and Fading Memory\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe use synthetic tasks to test B’MOJO’s ability to recall exact information from beyond the attention span  [ref]46. We do so with Multi-Query Associative Recall (MQAR) data in the main text, and consider other tasks such as Induction Heads , Selective Copying [ref]17, Fuzzy MQAR[ref]35, and Noisy MQAR [ref]35 in Appendix D. B’MOJO’s Memory Efficiency on Associative Recall Tasks.\nThe MQAR task  has been shown to correlate well with language modeling performance  [ref]35. Compared to its peers (e.g. Induction Heads ) MQAR is considerably more difficult—for each test sequence, key-value pairs are randomly chosen from a fixed vocabulary and all must be memorized by the model for exact retrieval later. In Figure 2, we display accuracy on MQAR as we vary the size of the recurrent state for 2-layer instances of B’MOJO, B’MOJO-F, Mamba [ref]17, a Hybrid model, and a Transformer baseline 1. Panels 1-3 consider varying numbers of key-value pairs to illustrate increasing complexity. Here, a Transformer (Mistral), with its sequence-length-sized KV cache serves as the paragon, always achieving a 100% accuracy. Should its window size be restricted not to include the KV pairs, its accuracy would drop to that of a random guess. Our results show that while every model class improves in recall accuracy as its size increases, B’MOJO and B’MOJO-F do so more reliably and faster than others. These gaps increase with a larger number of key value pairs.\nWe explain these findings as follows.\nMamba possesses only fading memory to propagate information to the future, and therefore has a limited recall capacity  for a given size of its recurrent state. Hybrid models leverage a sliding window attention to mitigate this issue, however they require a lengthy window to increase their span and recall the reference pairs.\nThe strong performance of B’MOJO-F showcases the value of fading memory over a simple hybrid configuration, and the even stronger performance of B’MOJO, most evident in the panel on the right with 24 key value pairs, highlights the added contribution of an Eidetic memory for precise recall of past information. We probe specifically into the marginal contributions of eidetic memory in B’MOJO’s performance in Panel 4, and find that accuracy grows with each additional tokens allocated to Eidetic memory. Eventually, a large enough model dimension saturates this effect, and the need for additional memory.\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: We use synthetic tasks to test B’MOJO’s ability to recall exact information from beyond the attention span  [ref]46.
