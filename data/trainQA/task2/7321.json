Wasserstein distance can also be seen as the shortest curve between two input measures  which creates an optimal interpolation path between two measures . In this work, we work with static sliced Wasserstein distance where the random-path is only used to construct discriminative projecting directions. Sliced Wasserstein on Manifolds. On manifolds where a straight line is generalized into a curse, the random-path definition should be different. For example, on the sphere, the shortest path between two points is the great circle. Therefore, it is natural to define the random-path as a random great circle with two endpoints that are randomly drawn from a coupling between two measures. This definition can lead to a natural extension for spherical Sliced Wasserstein . Moreover, we can also create a similar definition on hyperbolic manifolds for hyperbolic sliced Wasserstein  and on the manifold of positive definite matrix . Dependent Projecting Directions. Markovian Sliced Wasserstein distance is introduced in 3. It is a variant of SW that utilizes dependent projecting directions i.e., follows a Markovian structure joint distribution. The contribution of random-path slicing distribution is orthogonal to the mentioned approach since as can be used in either the prior distribution or the transition distribution in the Markovian process. In this work, we focus on slicing distribution selection variants of SW without dependency structure which can be computed very fast in parallel. Properties of sliced Wasserstein losses. In this work, we use sliced Wasserstein distance as a loss for gradient flows and generative modeling. We refer the reader to 4 for a more discussion about its properties i.e., regularity, gradient definition, and so on. Unbalanced Sliced Wasserstein. Random-path projecting direction can be applied directly to SW variants with unbalanced transport e.g., sliced partial optimal transport  [ref]1, sliced unbalanced optimal transport 0. Other potential applications. Since RPSW and IWRPSW can be used as a replacement for SW, they can be applied in domain adaptation , point-cloud applications  2 9, Bayesian inference 9 6, blue noise sampling 5 and so on.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: definition, and so on.
