      "content": "Paper Title: Blown up by an equilateral: Poncelet triangles about the incircle and their degeneracies\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPoncelet’s porism is a 1d family of n𝑛n-gons with vertices on a first conic ℰℰ\\mathcal{E} and with sides tangent to a second conic ℰcsubscriptℰ𝑐\\mathcal{E}_{c} (also called the ‘caustic’). For such a porism to exist, ℰℰ\\mathcal{E} and ℰcsubscriptℰ𝑐\\mathcal{E}_{c} must be positioned in ℝ2superscriptℝ2\\mathbb{R}^{2} so as to satisfy ‘Cayley’s condition’ . While the porism is projectively invariant – a conic pair is the projective image of two circles where the ‘Poncelet map’ is linearized, – we have found that Poncelet porisms of triangles (n=3𝑛3n=3) are a wellspring of interesting phenomena involving the dynamical geometry of classical objects associated with the triangle (centers, circles, lines/axes, etc.). An emblematic case, shown in Figure 2 (right) is when when ℰ,ℰcℰsubscriptℰ𝑐\\mathcal{E},\\mathcal{E}_{c} are confocal ellipses. In such a porism, – also known as the elliptic billiard – the perimeter is conserved , and the loci of all four ‘Greek centers’ of the triangle – incenter, barycenter, circumcenter, orthocenter – sweep ellipses [ref]8 [ref]11 . Significantly, neither foci, perimeter, nor triangle centers are projectively equivariant. Guided by experiment, we have found that certain types of ℰ,ℰcℰsubscriptℰ𝑐\\mathcal{E},\\mathcal{E}_{c} pairs form equivalent classes of Euclidean phenomena. One criterion is whether the pair is concentric and axis-aligned or not. Relevant for the present study, is a subdivision of triangle porisms based on whether either Poncelet conic is a circle or not. Referring to Figure 1, we obtain the following four combinations: Both conics are circles: this is Chapple’s porism . Loci of its triangle centers, e.g., incenter X1subscript𝑋1X_{1}, barycenter X2subscript𝑋2X_{2}, circumcenter X3subscript𝑋3X_{3}, orthocenter X4subscript𝑋4X_{4} (the Xksubscript𝑋𝑘X_{k} notation, used here, follows ), have been studied in    [ref]26. See Figure 2 (left). Only ℰℰ\\mathcal{E} is a circle. This system, always an affine image of (4), lends itself to a symmetric parametrization which is at the basis of our analysis. Aspects of its geometry and phenomena are analyzed in Appendix C. Only ℰcsubscriptℰ𝑐\\mathcal{E}_{c} is a circle: here we will tour its manifold Euclidean properties. Neither is circular: Euclidean phenomena are sparser, some are still discernible, e.g., the locus of certain centers are always conics, the locus of barycenter X2subscript𝑋2X_{2} and orthocenter X4subscript𝑋4X_{4} always homothetic to ℰℰ\\mathcal{E} (see below), etc. For case (3), we start by identifying triangle centers whose loci are conics. In  we show that the locus of a triangle center which is a fixed linear combination of the barycenter and the orthocenter is a sufficient condition for that center to sweep a conic. Nevertheless, other centers may still sweep conics for some choices of conic pairs. Still lacking a predictive theory for the latter, we use numerical methods to pinpoint their conic loci, as in [ref]11. Below we describe many curious dependencies between the shape and foci of certain loci and the geometry of either Poncelet conic. A surprising find has been that the presence of a single equilateral triangle in the family triggers a host of harmonious degeneracies.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: – also known as the elliptic billiard – the perimeter is conserved , and the loci of all four ‘Greek centers’ of the triangle – incenter, barycenter, circumcenter, orthocenter – sweep ellipses [ref]8 [ref]11 .
