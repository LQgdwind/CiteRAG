      "content": "Paper Title: Evaluating the Stability of Semantic Concept Representations in CNNs for Robust Explainability\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAdvancements in deep learning in the last decade have led to the ubiquitous use of deep neural networks (DNNs), in particular CNNs, in computer vision (CV) applications like object detection. While they exhibit state-of-the-art performance in many fields, their decision-making logic stays opaque and unclear due to their black-box nature  4. This fact raises concerns about their safety and fairness, which are desirable in fields like automated driving or medicine. These demands are formalized in industrial standards or legal regulations. For example, the ISO26262  automotive functional safety standard recommends manual inspectability, and the General Data Protection Regulation 3 as well as the upcoming European Union Artificial Intelligence Act 3 both demand algorithm transparency. The aforementioned concerns are subject of XAI. XAI is a subfield of AI that focuses on revealing the inner workings of black-box models in a way that humans can understand   . One approach involves associating semantic concepts from natural language with internal representations in the DNN’s latent space . In computer vision, a semantic concept refers to an attribute that can describe an image or image region in natural language (e.g., “pedestrian head”, “green”) 0 [ref]23. These concepts can be associated with vectors in the CNN’s latent space, also known as concept activation vectors (CAVs) [ref]23. Post-hoc CA involves acquiring and processing CAVs from trained CNNs [ref]23  [ref]2, which can be used to quantify how concepts attribute to CNN outputs and apply it to verification of safety  or fairness [ref]23.\nHowever, in literature two paradigms of post-hoc CA have so far been considered separately, even though they need to be combined to fully compare CNN learned concepts against prior human knowledge. These paradigms are: supervised CA, which investigates pre-defined concept representations [ref]23 0 , and unsupervised CA, which retrieves learned concepts 9 1 and avoids expensive labeling costs.\nFurthermore, current XAI approaches are primarily designed and evaluated for small classification and regression tasks  [ref]2, whereas more complex object detectors as used in automated driving require scalable XAI methods that can explain specific detections instead of just a single classification output. Besides adaptation to object detection use-cases, high-stakes applications like safety-critical perception have high demands regarding the quality and reliability of verification tooling [19, Chap. 11].\nA particular problem is stability: One should obtain similar concept representations given the same CNN, provided concept definitions, and probing data. Instable representations that vary strongly with factors like CA initialization weights  or imperceptible changes of the input 0 must be identified and only very cautiously used.\nStability issues may arise both in the retrieval of the concept representations, as well as in their usage. Retrieval instability was already identified as an issue in the base work [ref]23, and may lead to concept representations of different quality or even different semantic meaning for the same concept.\nInstability in usage may especially occur when determining local concept-to-output attribution. In particular, the baseline approach proposed by Kim et al. [ref]23 uses sensitivity, which is known to be brittle with respect to slight changes in the input 1 0. This work tackles the aforementioned problems of OD-ready supervised and unsupervised CA, and measurement and improvement of stability in CA retrieval and attribution.\nConcretely, to solve these problems, we propose an XAI framework based on supervised and unsupervised CA methods for ODs. The unsupervised method is used to automatically mine concept samples, which are jointly used for supervised concept analysis with manually labeled concepts. Furthermore, stability metrics are suggested and tested. The respective main contributions of our work are:\n Proposal of two metrics and methodology for testing of concept retrieval stability and concept attribution stability in CA; Experimental study of stability influence factors in six diverse CNN models with different backbones with the main findings that CAV dimensionality reduction may improve stability, and that gradient smoothing may be beneficial for concept attribution stability in shallow layers; Adaptation of supervised and unsupervised concept-based analysis methods for CA on common ODs; Introduction of a post-hoc, label-efficient, concept-based explainability framework for classifiers and ODs allowing for concept stability estimation (Fig. 1). In the following, we will first take a look at related work on concept analysis in Sec. 2. Our approaches for combining supervised and unsupervised CA, for CA in OD, and for stability measurement are then detailed in Sec. 3. Our experimental setup can be found in Sec. 4 with results detailed in Sec. 5.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: in the DNN’s latent space .
