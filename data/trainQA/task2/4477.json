      "content": "Paper Title: Generative Bias for Robust Visual Question Answering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVisual Question Answering (VQA)  is a challenging multi-modal task that requires a model to correctly understand and predict an answer given an input pair of image and question.\nVarious studies have shown that VQA is prone to biases within the dataset and tend to rely heavily on language biases that exists within the dataset [ref]2  1, and VQA models tend to predict similar answers only depending on the question regardless of the image.\nIn response to this, recent works have developed various bias reduction techniques, and recent methods have exploited ensemble based debiasing methods  [ref]13 [ref]19  extensively. Among ensemble based methods, additional models are introduced to concurrently learn biases that might exist within each modality or dataset. For example, in works such as  [ref]19, the Question-Answer model is utilized to determine the language prior biases that exist when a model is asked to give an answer based solely off of the question.\nThis Question-Answer model is then utilized to train a robust “target” model, which is used for inference.\nThe key purpose of an ensemble “bias” model is to capture the biases that are formed with its given inputs (i.e., language prior biases from the Question-Answer model).\nIn doing so, if this model is able to represent the bias well, this bias model can be used to teach the target model to avoid such biased answers.\nIn other words, the better the bias model can learn the biases, the better the target model can avoid such biases. Existing ensemble based methods either use pre-computed label statistics of training data (GGE-D [ref]19 and LMH [ref]13), or single modal branches\nthat compute\nthe answer\nfrom either the question or image   [ref]13 [ref]19 .\nHowever, we\nconjecture that there is a limit to the bias representation that can be obtained from such methods,\nas the model’s representative capacity is limited by its inputs.\nIn addition, pre-computed label statistics represents only part of the bias [ref]19.\nAs shown in Fig. 1,\ngiven a question type, the pre-computed label statistics (or known dataset bias) are noticeably different to the predictions of a model trained with the question or with the image and question. This discrepancy signifies that there is a part of the bias that we cannot fully model simply with the previous methods.\nTherefore, we propose a novel stochastic bias model that learns the bias directly from the target model. More specifically, to directly learn the bias distribution of the target model, we model the bias model as a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)  to stochastically mimic the target model’s answer distribution given the same question input by introducing a random noise vector.\nAs seen through literature, most biases are held within the question [ref]2, so we use questions as the main bias modality.\nTo further enforce this, we utilize knowledge distillation  on top of adversarial training to force the bias model to be as close as possible to the target model,\nso that the target model learns from harder negative supervision from the bias model.\nFinally, with our generative bias model, we then use our modified debiasing loss function to train our target model.\nOur final bias model is able to train the target model that outperforms previous uni-modal and multi-modal ensemble based debiasing methods by a large margin.\nTo the best of our knowledge, we are the first to train the bias model by directly leveraging the behavior of the target model using a generative model for VQA. To show the efficacy and robustness of our method, we perform extensive experiments on commonly used robustness testing VQA datasets and various different VQA architectures.\nOur method show the state-of-the-art results on all settings without the use of external human annotations or dataset reshuffling methods. Our contributions are as follows: We propose a novel bias model for ensemble based debiasing for VQA by directly leveraging the target model that we name GenB. In order to effectively train GenB, we employ a Generative Adversarial Network and knowledge distillation loss to capture both the dataset distribution bias and the bias from the target model. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on VQA-CP2, VQA-CP1 as well as the more challenging GQA-OOD dataset and VQA-CE using the simple UpDn baseline without extra annotations or dataset reshuffling and state-of-the-art VQA-CP2 peformance on the LXMERT backbone.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: answer given an input pair of image and question.\nVarious studies have shown that VQA is prone to biases within the dataset and tend to rely heavily on language biases that exists within the dataset [ref]2  1, and VQA models tend to predict similar answers only depending on the question regardless of the image.\nIn response to this, recent works have developed various bias reduction techniques,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
