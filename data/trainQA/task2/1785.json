Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

We consider four normally trained networks, including Inception-v3 (Inc-v3) , Inception-v4 (Inc-v4), Inception-Resnet-v2 (IncRes-v2)  and Resnet-v2-101 (Res-101) [ref]10 and three adversarially trained models, namely Inc-v3ens3, Inc-v3ens4 and IncRes-v2ens . Besides, we include nine advanced defense models that are robust against black-box adversarial attacks on the ImageNet dataset, \\ieHGD , R&P , NIPS-r3 111https://github.com/anlthms/nips-2017/tree/master/mmd, Bit-Red , JPEG , FD , ComDefend , RS  and NRP . For HGD, R&P, NIPS-r3 and RS, we adopt the official models provided in corresponding papers. For all the other defense methods, we adopt Inc-v3ens3 as the target model. Baselines. We take two popular momentum based iterative adversarial attacks as our baselines, \\ieMI-FGSM [ref]6 and NI-FGSM [ref]18, that exhibit better transferability than other white-box attacks   . In addition, we integrate the proposed method with various input transformations, \\ieDIM 5, TIM , SIM and CTM [ref]18, denoted as VM(N)I-DI-FGSM, VM(N)I-TI-FGSM, VM(N)I-SI-FGSM and VM(N)I-CT-FGSM respectively, to further validate the effectiveness of our method.

For MI-FGSM and NI-FGSM, we set the decay factor Œº=1.0ùúá1.0\\mu=1.0. For DIM, the transformation probability is set to 0.50.50.5.
