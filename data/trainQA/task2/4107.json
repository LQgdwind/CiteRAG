To avoid the pose ambiguity of objects with symmetric rotational shapes, only the airplane category is used in this experiment, with 626 models in the training set and 100 models in the test set. A point cloud is generated by randomly subsampling 1,024 points on the surface, and it is randomly rotated to form a pair. The experimental result is shown in Tab. 3. We achieved similar rotation estimation accuracy to EPN [ref]2 overall.\nWhile our mean error is slightly larger, the lower median error, max error, and standard deviations show that our method delivers a more reliable registration. It could imply that representing rotations as a permutation of features is more robust than representing them as a single element in the feature map.\nBesides, the equivariant networks outperform the non-equivariant KPConv [ref]35 by a large margin. \n\n\n\n\n\nSHOT[ref]37\n3DM\nCGF\nPPFN\nPPFF\n3DSN\nLi\nLi*\nEPN[ref]2\nOurs\n\n\n\nKitchen\n74.3\n58.3\n60.3\n89.7\n78.7\n97.5\n92.1\n99.4\n99.0\n99.4\n\nHome 1\n80.1\n72.4\n71.1\n55.8\n76.3\n96.2\n91.0\n98.7\n99.4\n98.7\n\nHome 2\n70.7\n61.5\n56.7\n59.1\n61.5\n93.2\n85.6\n94.7\n96.2\n96.6\n\nHotel 1\n77.4\n54.9\n57.1\n58.0\n68.1\n97.4\n95.1\n99.6\n99.6\n99.1\n\nHotel 2\n72.1\n48.1\n53.8\n57.7\n71.2\n92.8\n91.3\n100.0\n97.1\n98.1\n\nHotel 3\n85.2\n61.1\n83.3\n61.1\n94.4\n98.2\n96.3\n100.0\n100.0\n100.0\n\nStudy\n64.0\n51.7\n37.7\n53.4\n62.0\n95.0\n91.8\n95.5\n96.2\n95.2\n\nMIT Lab\n62.3\n50.7\n45.5\n63.6\n62.3\n94.1\n84.4\n92.2\n93.5\n90.9\n\nAverage\n73.3\n57.3\n58.2\n62.3\n71.8\n95.6\n91.0\n97.5\n97.6\n97.3\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: by randomly subsampling 1,024 points on the surface, and it is randomly rotated to form a pair.
