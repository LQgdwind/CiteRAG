      "content": "Paper Title: Invertible Manifold Learning for Dimension Reduction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMost classical DR or NLDR methods aim to preserve the geometric properties of manifolds. The Isomap [ref]28 based methods aim to preserve the global metric between every pair of sample points. For example,  can be regarded as such methods based on the push-forward Riemannian metric. For the other aspect, LLE  based methods try to preserve local geometry after DR, whose derivatives like LTSA , MLLE , etc. have been widely used but usually fail in the high-dimensional case. Recently, based on local properties of manifolds, MLDL 6 was proposed as a robust NLDR method implemented by a neural network. However, those methods ignore the retention of topology. In contrast, we take the preservation of both geometry and topology into consideration, trying to maintain these properties of manifolds even in cases of excessive dimension reduction when the target dimension s‚Ä≤superscriptùë†‚Ä≤s^{\\prime} is smaller than sùë†s. From AutoEncoder (AE) , the fundamental neural network based model, having achieved DR and cut information loss by minimizing the reconstruction loss, some AE based generative models like VAE  and manifold-based NLDR models like TopoAE  and GRAE  have emerged. These methods cannot avoid information loss after NLDR, and thus, some invertible models consist of a series of equidimensional layers have been proposed, some of which aim to generate samples by density estimation through layers [ref]3  , and the other of which are established for other targets, e.g., validating the mutual information bottleneck 0. Different from the methods mentioned above, our proposed i-ML-Enc is a neural network based encoder, with NLDR as well as maintaining structures of raw data points based on manifold assumption via a series of equidimensional layers.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: Most classical DR or NLDR methods aim to preserve the geometric properties of manifolds.
