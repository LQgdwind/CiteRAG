      "content": "Paper Title: PerceiverS: A Multi-Scale Perceiver with Effective Segmentation for Long-Term Expressive Symbolic Music Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPerceiver AR [ref]4 represents a significant advancement in the realm of autoregressive (AR) Transformers, as it directly addresses the challenge of handling long context attention, a limitation that has constrained almost all previous Transformer architectures. By breaking free from traditional context length constraints, Perceiver AR [ref]4 has made possible many tasks that were previously unachievable for AI models. A distinctive feature of Perceiver AR [ref]4’s design is its use of differing key-value (KV) and query (Q) lengths within the attention mechanism. This unique approach allows for an unrestricted context length, yet it requires a carefully considered application of causal masking. The causal mask only applies effectively to the query length, meaning that both training and generation must account for this query-specific length. To maximize learning, it is crucial for the model to begin training with query-length sequences starting from the beginning of each dataset sample, rather than focusing solely on the context-length segment. Without this adjustment, the model would fail to develop the capability for generating tokens beyond the masked region. Our proposed Effective Segmentation technique, which optimizes the input sequence processing for Perceiver AR [ref]4, has shown that, with appropriate data segmentation, Perceiver AR [ref]4 can effectively learn long contexts and produce coherent, contextually rich content. The ultra-long context attention indeed provides the model with remarkable benefits in maintaining content consistency over extended generation. However, a potential drawback of solely relying on long-range dependencies emerged: as sequences get longer, the model increasingly tends to generate repetitive short segments. This occurs because, in the later stages of generation, the long context windows are nearly identical, differing by only a few tokens. Consequently, the probability of generating identical or similar segments increases, further amplified by the high token autocorrelation  tendency due to the high similarity of context as the sequence lengthens.. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a Multi-Scale cross-attention mechanism that combines both long and short context windows. By integrating varying context lengths into multi-layer cross-attention, our approach successfully reduces the tendency for repetitive sequences while maintaining the model’s long-term consistency. This combination strategy enables the generation of high-quality symbolic music over extended sequences. Our enhanced model, PerceiverS (Segmentation and Scale), leverages Effective Segmentation aligned with Perceiver AR [ref]4’s operation mode. By applying Multi-Scale masking strategies within multi-layer cross-attention, PerceiverS effectively generates cohesive, consistent music over extended temporal contexts, preserving intricate musical patterns and expressive details across long sequences. Additionally, through the use of performance music datasets, PerceiverS is capable of producing high-quality symbolic music that captures the nuances of human performance. Importantly, because the model does not rely on annotated datasets, PerceiverS can be trained on MIDI data derived from audio using any automatic music transcription (AMT) technique. This capability suggests a future in which symbolic music generation can leverage vast historical recordings, unbounded by the limitations of manually annotated data. In essence, Perceiver AR [ref]4 and, by extension, PerceiverS, are general-purpose models adaptable to a wide range of AI tasks. The Effective Segmentation and Multi-Scale innovations introduced here open up avenues for future applications across domains such as text, image, and video. Future research could thus extend the potential of PerceiverS, exploring its capabilities across diverse modalities and expanding its utility within the broader landscape of AI tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Perceiver AR [ref]4 represents a significant advancement in the realm of autoregressive (AR) Transformers, as it directly addresses the challenge of handling long context attention, a limitation that has\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
