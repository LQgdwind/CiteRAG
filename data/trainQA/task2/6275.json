      "content": "Paper Title: Human-imperceptible, Machine-recognizable Images\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPuzzle Solver Attacker.\nJigsaw puzzle solver, i.e., reconstructing the image from the set of shuffled patches, can be used to attack the images encrypted with MS. Since this problem is NP-hard , solving jigsaw puzzles of non-trivial size is impossible. Most of the existing works in computer vision focus on the jigsaw puzzle problem composed of equally-sized image patches   [ref]21 , in which only pixels that are no more than two pixels away from the boundary of a piece are utilized. Therefore, with adaptations on how the image is decomposed, these methods might fail. We choose the solver proposed in  to inveterate the effect of attacks. The reason is two-fold: (1) It is a fast, fully-automatic, and general solver, which assumes no prior knowledge about the original image and (2) It can handle puzzles with missing pieces. We investigate the effect of patch size, patch interval, patch drop ratio, and image size on image reconstruction quality and classification performance. The results are shown in Figure 6 and Figure 5. We observe that increasing the number of patches (reducing the patch size or increasing the image size) or the patch interval can enhance the strength of privacy protection at the cost of performance. More importantly, even if 10% of the image patches are dropped, the performance is only reduced by 1.6%, which allows users to drop patches containing sensitive information. Gradient Leakage Attacker.\nIt has been shown that the training set will be leaked by gradient sharing [ref]52. To evaluate the impact of gradient leakage on the security of our method, we use the gradient leakage attacker to recover the images encrypted by RS. The results are shown in Figure 7. It can be observed that (1) Gradient leakage attacker can restore images and (2) the restored images are encrypted. Therefore, we conclude that our paradigm does not prevent gradient leakage attacks, but can make the attacked images useless, thus protecting privacy. Reconstruction Attacker.\nWe use a recently proposed powerful Transformer-based framework, MAE  (tiny), to recover the original clean images from the images encrypted by MI.\nWe adapt MAE with two modifications: (1) Patches are not dropped and (2) The linear patch embedding is replaced by a nonlinear patch embedding, which is consistent with the patch embedding used in PEYOLOS. Here the nonlinear patch embedding is composed of two linear layers separated by a GELU activation. Corresponding results are shown in Figure 8. We observe that: (1) The style of reconstructed images is very different from original images and (2) Privacy-sensitive patches such as faces and texts are blurred, and thus the reconstruction with MAE still cannot reveal the original identity of faces or the contents of texts. These observations indicate that recovering the original clean natural images from images encrypted by MI is a great challenge, demonstrating the effectiveness of MI regarding privacy preserving. Transformer-based Puzzle Solver Attacker.\nFor the large-scale dataset ImageNet, the method in [ref]54 solves the jigsaw puzzle problem with 3×3333\\times 3 patches. Even in this simple case, the authors still face big challenges. For example, the authors claimed that “Learning in the Imagenet dataset is much more challenging, as there isn’t a sequential structure that generalizes among images”. We extend [ref]54 to the case where there are 14×14141414\\times 14 patches (image size 224×224224224224\\times 224, patch size 16×16161616\\times 16). We use the powerful pipeline of MAE  with the following modifications: (1) Patches are not dropped, (2) The loss function used is Gumbel-Softmax proposed in [ref]54, and (3) The positional encoding is removed, which is necessary as the patch orders are randomly shuffled by RS. The results are shown in Figure 9. It can be observed that predicting the correct patch orders faces big challenges. The reason for this might be that (1) only a tiny fraction of 196!≈5×103651965superscript10365196!\\approx 5\\times 10^{365} possible patch orders are sampled, which is difficult to estimate the underlying joint distribution of patch orders and patch content. Note that sampling a large fraction of 196!≈5×103651965superscript10365196!\\approx 5\\times 10^{365} possible patch orders is infeasible in practice. (2) Extremely strong discriminative power are needed. For examples, if we mirror an image, the patch orders should change accordingly. In this case, the input patches are very similar, and a model needs a very strong discriminative power to distinguish them. To find the largest number of patches the reconstruction attack works, we finetune a pretrained ViT-base to solve the jigsaw puzzle in the settings of 2×2222\\times 2, 3×3333\\times 3, 4×4444\\times 4, and 5×5555\\times 5 patches. The training loss converges in the cases of 2×2222\\times 2 and 3×3333\\times 3 patches, but could not converge in all other cases. This suggests that the threshold is 3×3333\\times 3: when the patch number is larger than 3×3333\\times 3, the reconstruction attack does not work any more. Our encryption is thus safe from ViT attack, where the patch number is 14×14141414\\times 14. Quantitative Measure of Privacy Leakage.\nWe design a simple measure to quantify the degree of privacy disclosure i.e., detecting faces on original images and encrypted images and then considering the ratio of faces detected on encrypted images as a measure, in which the face detection method used is MTCNN 111https://github.com/timesler/facenet-pytorch. We have conducted experiments with this measure, and the results are shown in Table 3. It can be observed that both RS and MI can protect the visual contents to a great extent.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: is NP-hard , solving jigsaw puzzles of non-trivial size is impossible.
