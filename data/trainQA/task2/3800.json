      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Equilibrium Optical Flow Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFollowing the settings of prior work¬†[ref]1 , we apply a four-stage training protocol using the default hyperparameters unless specified otherwise. First, we train DEQ-RAFT-L, DEQ-RAFT-H, and DEQ-RAFT-H‚Ä† on FlyingChairs¬† for 120k iterations and then on FlyingThings¬† for another 120k iterations. In addtion, we also train the DEQ-GMA instantiation on FlyingChairs¬† using a batch size of 10 and a learning rate of 4e-4, with the same setting as RAFT¬†[ref]1. We note that the original recurrent GMA model quickly exhausts the memory budget even with a much smaller batch size and mixed-precision training, which is not a concern for DEQ-GMA due to the implicit modeling framework. We use an Anderson acceleration¬† solver with up to 40 forward steps for the base model (DEQ-RAFT-B).\nFor larger models (DEQ-RAFT-L, DEQ-RAFT-H, DEQ-GMA-B, and DEQ-GMA-L), we use a Broyden¬† solver with up to 36 forward steps.\nFor the pretraining on Chairs, we introduce 1-3 correction terms accordingly.\nWe adopt the 1-step gradient¬† [ref]22  for training, which suggests almost-free backward passes.\nAll the above experiments can be conducted on two 11¬†GB GPUs (NVIDIA 2080Ti). For DEQ-RAFT-H‚Ä†, we employ a Broyden¬† solver with 36 forward steps and 5 uniformly spaced correction terms.\nWe apply phantom gradient¬† of 3 steps to DEQ-RAFT-H‚Ä† and average the best results of 3 runs under a 5k-step evaluation gap to report the ‚ÄúC+T‚Äù schedule performance.\nThe memory budget for this experiment can be two 16 GB GPUs or three 11 GB GPUs, while mixed-precision can further reduce the memory cost. Note that we do not manually select the damping factor ŒªùúÜ\\lambda¬† but adopt the gating function from ConvGRU as the adaptive ŒªùúÜ\\lambda, which waives the hyperparameter tuning for the phantom gradient.\nThe fixed point solvers are based on that of¬†Bai et¬†al. [ref]2. In all those cases, the fixed-point solvers stop either when the iterations reach the limit, or if the absolute residual error falls below 0.0010.0010.001. Our results suggest that, with minimal tuning, these settings are sufficient to achieve state-of-the-art¬†results (while imposing much lower compute and memory cost).\nEmpirically, we note that a DEQ flow model trained using a stronger solver (e.g.,¬†the Broyden solver) and with more steps typically leads to slightly better performance. This implies the prospect of potentially further boosting the DEQ-flow performance by more precise fixed-point solving, while noting that recent progress on using neural solvers might suggest an interesting perspective¬†.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Following the settings of prior work¬†[ref]1 , we apply a four-stage training protocol using the default hyperparameters unless specified otherwise.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
