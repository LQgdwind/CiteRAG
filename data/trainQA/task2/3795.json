      "content": "Paper Title: Optimal Coding Theorems in Time-Bounded Kolmogorov Complexity\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA sampler is a probabilistic function that outputs Boolean strings. For any string x∈{0,1}∗𝑥superscript01x\\in\\{0,1\\}^{*} in its range, let μ​(x)𝜇𝑥\\mu(x) denote the probability with which x𝑥x is generated. The Coding Theorem in Kolmogorov complexity states that if the sampler is computable and its domain is a prefix-free set, then for every x𝑥x in its range where 𝖪​(⋅)𝖪⋅\\mathsf{K}(\\cdot) is the prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity. In other words, strings that are sampled with non-trivial probability have short representations. Note that the coding theorem achieves optimal expected length, since no uniquely decodable code can have expected length smaller than ∑μ​(x)​log2⁡(1/μ​(x))𝜇𝑥subscript21𝜇𝑥\\sum\\mu(x)\\log_{2}(1/\\mu(x)), the entropy of the sampler (the sum is over all x𝑥x in the range of the sampler, assumed here to be finite). The coding theorem is a central result in Kolmogorov complexity.111For instance,  describes it as one of the four pillars of Kolmogorov complexity. While it has found a number of applications in theoretical computer science (see, e.g.,   ), it comes with an important caveat: many aspects of the theory of Kolmogorov complexity are non-constructive. For instance, there is provably no algorithm that estimates 𝖪​(x)𝖪𝑥\\mathsf{K}(x). Similarly, for arbitrary samplers, there is no effective compressor achieving the short representation provided by the coding theorem222However, there exists a probabilistic polynomial-time compressor that given x𝑥x and an integer m≥log⁡(1/μ​(x))𝑚1𝜇𝑥m\\geq\\log(1/\\mu(x)) outputs a description of x𝑥x of length m𝑚m + small polylogarithmic overhead 1. and also no upper bound on the running time required to decompress x𝑥x from it. In order to translate results and techniques from Kolmogorov complexity to the setting of efficient algorithms and computations, several time-bounded variants of Kolmogorov complexity have been proposed. We refer to the book , thesis , and the surveys   7  for a comprehensive treatment of this area and its numerous applications to algorithms, complexity, cryptography, learning, and pseudorandomness, among other fields. We highlight that\nmany exciting new results, which include worst-case to average-case reductions for NP problems   and complexity-theoretic characterizations of one-way functions  , rely in a crucial way on time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity. These recent developments further motivate the investigation of key results from Kolmogorov complexity in the time-bounded setting. In time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity we consider the minimum description length of a string x𝑥x with respect to machines that operate under a time constraint. We informally review next two central notions in this area (see Section 2 for precise definitions). For a Turing machine ℳℳ\\mathcal{M}, we let |ℳ|ℳ|\\mathcal{M}| denote its description length according to a fixed universal machine U𝑈U. ℳ​(ε)ℳ𝜀\\mathcal{M}(\\varepsilon) denotes the computation of ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} over the empty string.\n 𝗞𝘁𝗞𝘁\\bm{\\mathsf{Kt}} Complexity . This notion simultaneously considers description length and running time when measuring the complexity of a string x𝑥x. 𝗞𝒕superscript𝗞𝒕\\bm{\\mathsf{K}^{t}} Complexity . In contrast with 𝖪𝗍𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{Kt}, here we fix the time bound t:ℕ→ℕ:𝑡→ℕℕt\\colon\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{N}, and consider the minimum description with respect to machines that run in time at most t​(|x|)𝑡𝑥t(|x|). While 𝖪𝗍𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{Kt} complexity is tightly related to optimal search algorithms (see  for a recent application), 𝖪tsuperscript𝖪𝑡\\mathsf{K}^{t} is particularly useful in settings where maintaining a polynomial bound on the running time t𝑡t is desired (see, e.g., ). Antunes and Fortnow  introduced techniques that can be used to establish (conditional) coding theorems for 𝖪tsuperscript𝖪𝑡\\mathsf{K}^{t} and 𝖪𝗍𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{Kt}. In particular, if a sampler runs in polynomial time and outputs a string x𝑥x with probability at least δ𝛿\\delta, then 𝖪𝗍​(x)≤log⁡(1/δ)+O​(log⁡n)𝖪𝗍𝑥1𝛿𝑂𝑛\\mathsf{Kt}(x)\\leq\\log(1/\\delta)+O(\\log n). Note that this coding theorem also achieves an optimal dependence on the probability parameter δ𝛿\\delta. However, the results of  rely on a strong derandomization assumption. For this reason, their application often lead to conditional results. More recently, 9 established an unconditional coding theorem for a randomized analogue of 𝖪𝗍𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{Kt} complexity. Before explaining their result, we review the definitions of 𝗋𝖪𝗍𝗋𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{rKt} and 𝗋𝖪tsuperscript𝗋𝖪𝑡\\mathsf{rK}^{t}.\n 𝗿𝗞𝘁𝗿𝗞𝘁\\bm{\\mathsf{rKt}} Complexity . In this definition, we consider randomized machines that output x𝑥x with high probability. 𝗿𝗞𝒕superscript𝗿𝗞𝒕\\bm{\\mathsf{rK}^{t}} Complexity  [ref]30.333 refers to this notion as 𝖢𝖡𝖯tsuperscript𝖢𝖡𝖯𝑡\\mathsf{CBP}^{t} complexity. This is the randomized analogue of 𝖪tsuperscript𝖪𝑡\\mathsf{K}^{t}, where the time bound t𝑡t is fixed in advance. In both cases, we can think of the randomized Turing machine ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} as a probabilistic representation of the input string x𝑥x, in the sense that x𝑥x can be recovered with high probability from its description. These measures allow us to employ methods from time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity in the setting of randomized computation, which is ubiquitous in modern computer science. For instance,  [ref]30 employed 𝗋𝖪𝗍𝗋𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{rKt} and 𝗋𝖪tsuperscript𝗋𝖪𝑡\\mathsf{rK}^{t} to obtain bounds on the compressibility of prime numbers and other objects and to show that certain problems about time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity can be intractable. We note that, under derandomization assumptions (see ), for every string x𝑥x, 𝗋𝖪𝗍​(x)=Θ​(𝖪𝗍​(x))𝗋𝖪𝗍𝑥Θ𝖪𝗍𝑥\\mathsf{rKt}(x)=\\Theta(\\mathsf{Kt}(x)). Similarly, one can conditionally show that 𝖪t​(x)superscript𝖪𝑡𝑥\\mathsf{K}^{t}(x) is essentially 𝗋𝖪t​(x)superscript𝗋𝖪𝑡𝑥\\mathsf{rK}^{t}(x), up to a O​(log⁡|x|)𝑂𝑥O(\\log|x|) additive term (see 8). Consequently, insights obtained in the context of probabilistic notions of Kolmogorov complexity can often inform the study of more classical notions such as 𝖪𝗍𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{Kt} and 𝖪tsuperscript𝖪𝑡\\mathsf{K}^{t}. Among other results, 9 established the following unconditional coding theorem in time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity: if a sampler runs in polynomial time and outputs a string x𝑥x with probability at least δ𝛿\\delta, then 𝗋𝖪𝗍(x)=O(log(1/δ)+O(logn)\\mathsf{rKt}(x)=O(\\log(1/\\delta)+O(\\log n). While this result can be used to port some applications of the coding theorem from Kolmogorov complexity to the time-bounded setting, in many cases it is still insufficient. This is because its dependence on the probability parameter δ𝛿\\delta is not optimal, which is often crucial in applications (see, e.g.,  ).\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: 𝗿𝗞𝘁𝗿𝗞𝘁\\bm{\\mathsf{rKt}} Complexity .
