      "content": "Paper Title: Airbert: In-domain Pretraining for Vision-and-Language Navigation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn vision-and-language navigation (VLN), an agent is asked to navigate in home environments following natural language instructions  .\nThis task is attractive to many real-world applications such as domestic robotics and personal assistants.\nHowever, given the high diversity of VLN data across environments and the difficulty of the manual collection and annotation of VLN training data at scale, the performance of current methods remains limited, especially for previously unseen environments . Our work is motivated by significant improvements in vision and language pretraining   3 4 5 8, where deep transformer models  are trained via self-supervised proxy tasks  using large-scale, automatically harvested image-text datasets 2 6.\nSuch pretraining enables learning transferable multi-modal representations achieving state-of-the-art performance in various vision and language tasks.\nSimilarly, with the goal of learning an embodied agent that generalizes, recent works [ref]13 [ref]16 2 8 have explored different pretraining approaches for VLN tasks. In [ref]13 [ref]16, annotated path-instruction pairs\nare augmented with a speaker model that generates instructions for random unseen paths.\nHowever, as these paths originate from a small set of 61 houses used during training, they are limited in visual diversity.\nThe limited pretraining environments do not equip agents with visual understanding abilities that enable generalization to unseen houses, see Fig. 1.\nTo address this problem, VLN-BERT 8 proposes to pretrain the agent on generic image-caption datasets that are abundant and cover diverse visio-linguistic knowledge.\nHowever, these image-caption pairs are quite different from the dynamic visual stream (path) and navigable instructions observed by a VLN agent.\nSuch out-of-domain pretraining, although promising, only brings limited gains to the navigation performance.\nBesides the above limitations, existing pretraining methods do not place much emphasis on temporal reasoning abilities in their proxy tasks such as one-step action prediction [ref]13 and path-instruction pairing 8, while such reasoning is important to a sequential decision making task like VLN.\nAs a result, even if performance in downstream tasks is improved, the pretrained models may still be brittle.\nFor example, a simple corruption of instructions by swapping noun phrases within the instruction, or replacing them with other nouns, leads to significant confusion as models are unable to pick the correct original pair. In this paper, we explore a different data source and proxy tasks to address the above limitations in pretraining a generic VLN agent.\nThough navigation instructions are rarely found on the Internet, image-caption pairs from home environments are abundant in online marketplaces (e.g. Airbnb), which include images and descriptions of rental listings.\nWe collect BnB, a new large-scale dataset with 1.4M indoor images and 0.7M captions.\nFirst, we show that in-domain image-caption pairs bring additional benefits for downstream VLN tasks when applied with generic web data 8.\nIn order to further reduce the domain gap between the BnB pretraining and the VLN task, we present an approach to transform static image-caption pairs into visual paths and navigation-like instructions (Fig. 1 bottom), leading to large additional performance gains.\nWe also propose a shuffling loss that improves the model’s temporal reasoning abilities by learning a temporal alignment between a path and the corresponding instruction. Our pretrained model, Airbert, is a generic transformer backbone that can be readily integrated in both discriminative VLN tasks such as path-instruction compatibility prediction 8 and generative VLN tasks  in R2R navigation  and REVERIE remote referring expression 4.\nWe achieve state-of-the-art performance on these VLN tasks with our pretrained model.\nBeyond the standard evaluation, our in-domain pretraining opens an exciting new direction of one/few-shot VLN where the agent is trained on examples only from one/few environment(s) and expected to generalize to other unseen environments. In summary, the contributions of this work are three-fold.\n(1) We collect a new large-scale in-domain dataset, BnB, to promote pretraining for vision-and-language navigation tasks.\n(2) We curate the dataset in different ways to reduce the distribution shift between pretraining and VLN and also propose the shuffling loss to improve temporal reasoning abilities.\n(3) Our pretrained Airbert can be plugged into generative or discriminative architectures and achieves state-of-the-art performance on R2R and REVERIE datasets.\nMoreover, our model generalizes well under a challenging one/few-shot VLN evaluation, truly highlighting the capabilities of our learning paradigm.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: multi-modal representations achieving state-of-the-art performance in various vision and language tasks.\nSimilarly, with the goal of learning an embodied agent that generalizes, recent works [ref]13 [ref]16 2 8 have explored different pretraining approaches for VLN tasks.
