      "content": "Paper Title: HyperTree Proof Search for Neural Theorem Proving\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOver the course of history, the complexity of mathematical proofs has increased dramatically.\nThe nineteenth century saw the emergence of proofs so involved that they could only be verified by a handful of specialists.\nThis limited peer review process inevitably led to invalid proofs, with mistakes sometimes remaining undiscovered for years (e.g. the erroneous proof of the Four Colour Conjecture ).\nSome mathematicians argue that the frontier of mathematics has reached such a level of complexity that the traditional review process is no longer sufficient, envisioning a future where research articles are submitted with formal proofs so that the correctness can be delegated to a computer [ref]2. Unfortunately, very few mathematicians have adopted formal systems in their work, and as of today, only a fraction of existing mathematics has been formalized.\nSeveral obstacles have hindered the widespread adoption of formal systems.\nFirst, formalized mathematics are quite dissimilar from traditional mathematics, rather closer to source code written in a programming language, which makes formal systems difficult to use, especially for newcomers.\nSecond, formalizing an existing proof still involves significant effort and expertise (the formalization of the Kepler conjecture took over 20 person years to complete ) and even seemingly simple statements sometimes remain frustratingly challenging to formalize. To write a formal proof, mathematicians typically work with Interactive Theorem Provers (ITPs).\nThe most popular ITPs provide high-level “tactics” that can be applied on an input theorem (e.g. the initial goal) to generate a set of subgoals, with the guarantee that proving all subgoals will result in a proof of the initial goal (reaching an empty set means the tactic solves the goal).\nAn example of a proof in Lean , an interactive theorem prover, is given in Figure 1 and the corresponding proof hypertree is illustrated in Figure 3. A tactic, induction k, is applied on the root goal (n+k≤m+k𝑛𝑘𝑚𝑘n+k\\leq m+k) to start a proof by induction\n111A hypergraph is a graph where an edge leads to a set of nodes that is potentially empty in our set-up. A hypertree is a hypergraph without cycles. More formal definitions can be found in Appendix A.1.\nThe formal system returns two subgoals: n+0≤m+0𝑛0𝑚0n+0\\leq m+0 (the initial case) and n+k≤m+k⇒n+k+1≤m+k+1𝑛𝑘𝑚𝑘⇒𝑛𝑘1𝑚𝑘1n+k\\leq m+k\\Rightarrow n+k+1\\leq m+k+1 (the induction step).\nAs the first subgoal is our initial hypothesis, it can be solved using the exact tactic.\nTo prove the second subgoal, we first rewrite it using nat.succ_le_succ_iff, a theorem from the Lean library stating that m+1≤n+1⇔m≤niff𝑚1𝑛1𝑚𝑛m+1\\leq n+1\\iff m\\leq n.\nThe new subgoal then becomes our induction hypothesis n+k≤m+k𝑛𝑘𝑚𝑘n+k\\leq m+k, and can again be solved using the exact tactic, thereby solving the last remaining subgoal and completing the proof of the initial statement.\nStarting from a goal and reducing it to subgoals until these can be solved, is commonly referred to as backward proving. In this paper, we aim at creating a prover that can automatically solve input theorems by generating a sequence of suitable tactics without human interaction. Such a prover could significantly reduce the effort required to formalize existing mathematics.\nThe backward procedure naturally suggests a simple approach where a machine learning model trained to map goals to tactics interacts with an ITP to build the proof of an input goal in a backward fashion.\nThe automated prover builds a hypergraph with the theorem to be proved as the root node, tactics as edges and subgoals as nodes. The prover recursively expands leaves by generating tactics with our model until we find a proof of the initial theorem. A proof in this setup is a hypertree rooted in the initial theorem whose leaves are empty sets.\nAs many different tactics can be applied to a goal, and each tactic application can result in multiple subgoals, the number of goals in the graph grows exponentially and it is critical to reduce the search to the most promising branches. This can be done through techniques like alpha-beta pruning  or Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) , known for its recent successes in difficult two player games [ref]7.\nHowever, challenges arise in search algorithms for theorem proving that do not occur in two player games. For instance: The action space, i.e. the amount of possible “moves” in a given state, is infinite (there is an unlimited number of tactics that can be applied to a given theorem). This requires sampling possible actions from a language model for which training data is scarce. Moreover, if all tactics sampled at a goal fail, we have no information on what region of the probability space to sample next. In the context of theorem proving, we need to provide a proof of all subgoals created by a tactic, whereas AlphaZero for two player games is allowed to focus on the most likely adversary moves. In Chess or Go, playing a sub-optimal move does not necessarily lead to losing the game, thus exploring these branches can provide information. In theorem proving, it is frequent to generate tactics that result in subgoals that can no longer be proved and on which the model will waste significant search budget. This paper presents an in-depth study of our approach to overcome these difficulties and the resulting model, Evariste. In particular, we make the following contributions: A new MCTS-inspired search algorithm for finding proofs in unbalanced hypergraphs. A new environment (Equations) to easily prototype and understand the behavior of the models we train and our proof search. A detailed ablation study and analysis of the different components used in our approach on three different theorem proving environments. We study how data is selected for training the policy model after a successful or failed proof-search, what target should be used to train the critic model, and the impact of online training vs. expert iteration. State-of-the-art performance on all analyzed environments. In particular, our model manages to prove over 82.6%percent82.682.6\\% of proofs in a held-out set of theorems from set.mm in Metamath, as well as 58.6%percent58.658.6\\% on miniF2F-valid  in Lean. We begin by introducing related work in Section 2 and present the three theorem proving environments that we study in Section 3. Then, we present our proof-search algorithm in Section 4, our online training pipeline in Section 5, and all experimental details in Section 6. Finally, we describe our main results and ablation studies in Section 7 before concluding in Section 8.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: that the traditional review process is no longer sufficient, envisioning a future where research articles are submitted with formal proofs so that the correctness can be delegated to a computer [ref]2.
