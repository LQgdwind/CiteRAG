      "content": "Paper Title: Performance Limits of a Deep Learning-Enabled Text Semantic Communication under Interference\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe consider the state-of-the-art text SemCom system dubbed DeepSC [ref]5. Per [ref]5, the DeepSC transmitter consists of a semantic encoder that extracts semantic information from the source using multiple Transformer encoder layers followed by a channel encoder made of dense layers with different units that produce symbols to be transmitted to the DeepSC receiver [5, Sec. IV]. The DeepSC receiver is composed of a channel decoder – made of dense layers with different units – followed by a semantic decoder built from multiple Transformer decoder layers that are employed for symbol detection and text recovery, respectively [5, Sec. IV]. When it comes to text recovery/estimation, per [5, Algorithms 1-3], the DeepSC model is end-to-end pre-trained and deployed in a wireless environment experiencing narrowband111RFI can be narrowband, broadband, continuous wave, or pulsed . Without loss of generality, however, we aim to study the performance limits of DeepSC subjected to narrowband RFI from one or more RFI emitters. To this end, our principled probabilistic framework (see Sec. III) can also be used to study the performance limits of DeepSC experiencing one or more RFI emitters emitting broadband, continuous wave, or pulsed RFI. (superimposed) RFI from one or more RFI emitters as shown in Fig. 1. Following the lead of the works in [ref]5 [ref]29, let 𝒔:=[w1,w2,…,wL]\\bm{s}\\mathrel{\\mathop{:}}=[w_{1},w_{2},\\ldots,w_{L}] be a sentence of L𝐿L words – wlsubscript𝑤𝑙w_{l} being the l𝑙l-th word for all l∈[L]𝑙delimited-[]𝐿l\\in[L] – to be transmitted by the trained DeepSC transmitter shown in Fig. 1. As per Fig. 1 and with respect to (w.r.t.) an input 𝒔𝒔\\bm{s}, the trained semantic encoder network coupled with the trained channel encoder network will extract the semantic features from the input text and map them into semantic symbols (termed DeepSC symbols hereinafter) 𝒙𝒙\\bm{x} that can be expressed (via [5, eq. (1)]) as where K𝐾K is the average number of mapped semantic symbols per word in 𝒔𝒔\\bm{s} [ref]29, S𝜷^​(⋅)subscript𝑆^𝜷⋅S_{\\hat{\\bm{\\beta}}}(\\cdot) represents the trained semantic encoder network with a parameter set 𝜷^^𝜷\\hat{\\bm{\\beta}}, and C𝜶^​(⋅)subscript𝐶^𝜶⋅C_{\\hat{\\bm{\\alpha}}}(\\cdot) is the trained channel encoder network with a parameter set 𝜶^^𝜶\\hat{\\bm{\\alpha}}. We use these trained networks to realize – similar to the authors of [ref]5 and without loss of generality – the transmission of 𝒙𝒙\\bm{x} over an independent Rayleigh fading channel222Transmitting DeepSC symbols of dimension K​L𝐾𝐿KL over a Rayleigh fading channel implicitly underscores a simplifying assumption that the channel’s coherence time is at least K​L𝐾𝐿KL times the duration of each DeepSC symbol (𝒙)i∈ℂsubscript𝒙𝑖ℂ(\\bm{x})_{i}\\in\\mathbb{C} for i∈[K​L]𝑖delimited-[]𝐾𝐿i\\in[KL]. h∼𝒞​𝒩​(0,1)similar-toℎ𝒞𝒩01h\\sim\\mathcal{CN}(0,1) via a wireless environment experiencing (MI) RFI from U𝑈U independent RFI emitters emitting RFI over an independent Rayleigh fading channel333In reality, an RFI emitter’s (e.g., a jammer’s) channel may not be precisely known and can vary in time/frequency. However, for a jammer to successfully jam futuristic SemCom systems, it must emit a huge amount of RFI power over a narrowband channel from a relatively stationary position toward the DeepSC’s receiving antenna. To underscore this best-case jamming scenario (worst-case SemCom system design challenge), we move forward with Rayleigh fading RFI channels. These channels are also assumed to have a coherence time of at least K​L𝐾𝐿KL – w.r.t. the dimension of the u𝑢u-th RFI symbol 𝒗u∈ℂ1×K​Lsubscript𝒗𝑢superscriptℂ1𝐾𝐿\\bm{v}_{u}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{1\\times KL} for u∈[U]𝑢delimited-[]𝑈u\\in[U] – times the duration of each DeepSC symbol (𝒙)i∈ℂsubscript𝒙𝑖ℂ(\\bm{x})_{i}\\in\\mathbb{C} for i∈[K​L]𝑖delimited-[]𝐾𝐿i\\in[KL]. This assumption means that the considered RFI channels are relatively slow fading channels – underscoring the best-case jamming scenario portrayed in our analytical study. gu∼𝒞​𝒩​(0,1)similar-tosubscript𝑔𝑢𝒞𝒩01g_{u}\\sim\\mathcal{CN}(0,1) for all u∈[U]𝑢delimited-[]𝑈u\\in[U].
