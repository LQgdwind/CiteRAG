      "content": "Paper Title: Greedy Gradient Ensemble for Robust Visual Question Answering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare our best performed model GGE-DQ with existing state-of-the-art bias reduction techniques, including visual grounding-based methods HINT , SCR , ensemble-based methods AdvReg. , RUBi , LM (LMH) [ref]10, MFE [ref]14, new question encoding-based methods GVQE , DLP [ref]34, counterfactual-based methods CF-VQA [ref]34, CSS \n, and recent proposed regularization method MFE [ref]14. Experiments on VQA-CP test set aim to evaluate whether VQA models effectively reduce language bias. As shown in Table 2, GGE-DQ achieves state-of-the-art performance without extra annotation. It outperforms the baseline model UpDn by 17% higher in Accuracy and 13% higher in CGD, which verifies the effectiveness of GGE on both answer classification and visual-grounding ability.\nUnder the same base model UpDn, our method achieves the best performance in both Accuracy and CGD, with ∼5%similar-toabsentpercent5\\sim 5\\% gain comparing to all other methods, even competitive with methods that use stronger base models. For the comparison of question-type-wise results, incorporating GGE reduces the biases and improves the performance for all the question-types, especially the more challenging “other” question type .\nCF-VQA [ref]34 performs the best in Y/N, but worse than our methods in all other metrics. LMH [ref]10, LMH-MFE [ref]14 and LMH-CSS  surpass other methods in Num., and LMH-CSS even slightly outperforms GGE-DQ in overall Accuracy due to high performance in Num. (40.73%). Comparing LM and LMH, it is obvious that the performance gains in Num. are due to the additional regularization for entropy. However, methods with entropy regularization drop nearly 10% on VQA v2. This indicates that these models may over-correct the bias and largely use “inverse language bias”.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: our best performed model GGE-DQ with existing state-of-the-art bias reduction techniques, including visual grounding-based methods HINT , SCR , ensemble-based methods AdvReg. , RUBi , LM (LMH) [ref]10, MFE [ref]14, new question encoding-based methods GVQE , DLP [ref]34, counterfactual-based methods CF-VQA [ref]34, CSS \n, and recent proposed regularization method MFE [ref]14.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
