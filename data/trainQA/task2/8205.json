Dual Temporal Grounding for Video Dialog\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, with AVSD@DSTC-7 [ref]45, AVSD@DSTC-8 [ref]15 and AVSD-@DSTC-10  challenges, Video-grounded Dialog (VGD) has received a lot of attention. As a crucial component of multi-modal reasoning tasks, VGD requires the model to comprehensively consider dialogue history, current query and video scenes to facilitate\nresponse generation.\nEarly works [ref]1    0 4 used recurrent neural network or multi attention to encode dialog and convolutional neural network to obtain video features, with simple concatenation for cross-modal fusion. Subsequent researches are mainly divided into two groups: one group opts to utilizing visual-language pre-trained models. For example, Le and Hoi  and Li et al.  embedded video into text space and fined turn a GPT-2 2 model to generate the answers. Yamazaki et al.  employed a pre-trained TimeSformer  model to obtain better visual representation. Huang et al.  applied an UniVL 7 model to enhance multi modal representation and fusion capabilities.\n leverages the powerful text generation capability of Large Language Model (LLM) to convert videos into embeddings that LLaMA 8 can recognize using Q-former.\nHowever, researches in this group have an insufficient utilization of features and generally ignore the temporal relationships between various modalities. For example, they input the entire video or several recent dialogue history turns. This results in abundance of noise that undermines the advantage of pre-trained models and hinders their effectiveness. The other group is object-centered that focuses on extracting spatial-temporal information relevant to objects from the video or text. For example,\nGeng et al.  and Kim et al.  obtained object features by Faster R-CNN 3 and constructed scene graphs to perform object-centric cross-modal interactions. Pham et al. 1 parsed the dynamic space-time visual content into object trajectories and leveraged questions. However, these methods require complex pre-extraction of object trajectories and mainly focus on cross-modal fusion between vision and text, without fully utilizing the temporal relationships in conversation history. Besides, in the era of large models, they still need to train complex networks from scratch, which may soon be surpassed by a simple fine-tuned multi-modal pre-trained model.\nOur work addresses the issues of both groups, by extracting more effective key information from video and text based on temporal dependencies. Besides, our framework can work with a variety of pre-trained models, which demonstrates significant superiority in this task.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: Recently, with AVSD@DSTC-7 [ref]45, AVSD@DSTC-8 [ref]15 and AVSD-@DSTC-10  challenges, Video-grounded Dialog (VGD) has received a lot of attention.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
