      "content": "Paper Title: Noise-tolerant learnability of shallow quantum circuits from statistics and the cost of quantum pseudorandomness\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe problem of learning quantum processes is a fundamental question in quantum information, learning theory, benchmarking and cryptography among several other areas. However, tomography of quantum processes in general is known to require an exponential amount of data and computational time [ref]1 . Even so, many advances have been made to improve the efficiency of learning processes by focusing either on specific classes of quantum processes with special structure  [ref]4 [ref]5 or by focusing on learning specific properties of processes rather than fully characterizing them . An interesting property to focus on is the depth of the quantum circuit, especially in the near term, where devices are prone to noise and cannot be used to implement deep circuits. The utility of shallow quantum circuits has been widely studied  , making the learnability of shallow quantum circuits an interesting area of research, which has already been explored in [ref]4 [ref]5.\n\n\nAnother important property to consider in the near term is the prevalence of noise. Characterizing and correcting the noise of quantum devices are active areas of research that are crucial for the progress of the field of quantum computing   . In classical learning theory, the study of learnability under noise was initiated by the work of Kearns , who proposed the statistical query model as a naturally robust model. Indeed, an algorithm that can learn a function using only statistical properties can be implemented robustly in a noisy setting. Recently, statistical queries have also found a lot of interest in quantum learning theory, with recent studies of quantum statistical queries for learning many properties of quantum states and processes      . In this work, we will focus on quantum statistical queries for learning quantum processes, and show their applicability in the development of robust algorithms. Further, our focus will be on the learnability of shallow quantum circuits, for which we will prove both positive and negative results. Our work signifies the use of quantum statistical queries as a powerful theoretical tool for studying the learnability of quantum processes in the near term.\n\n\nAnother field closely tied to learning theory is cryptography. Even though the techniques used in both fields are quite different, a lot of results in cryptography have been proven using tools from learning theory  0 and vice-versa [ref]4 1. An area of research in quantum cryptography that has attracted much attention over the past few years is the notion of quantum pseudorandomness 2, where one hopes to replace truly random quantum objects with deterministic objects that are computationally indistinguishable from truly random ones. Applications of quantum pseudorandomness in cryptography have been studied in 3. Recently, it has been shown that quantum pseudorandomness may exist independent of classical cryptographic assumptions 4 5, making it a key focus of the community. In particular, a line of recent work 6 7 has focused on proving a secure construction for pseudorandom unitaries. While no fully secure construction has been found so far, these constructions do satisfy weaker notions of security. An interesting work is that of 8, where Haug et al. showed certain properties pseudorandom unitaries must possess. Another work along these lines was that of 9, where Grewal et al. showed that pseudorandom quantum states require a high number of non-Clifford gates, by constructing an efficient distinguisher using a learning algorithm for states prepared with few non-Cliffords. Studying such properties and analyzing the required resources is an important direction to develop efficient and secure constructions for PRUs. Towards this goal, we will use results from learning theory to prove that pseudorandom unitaries cannot be implemented by shallow circuits. In what follows we detail our technical contributions.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: learning theory, benchmarking and cryptography among several other areas.
