      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Data-Plane Memory Scheduling for In-Network Aggregation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDriven by the increasing complexity of Machine Learning (ML) applications, such as autonomous driving , general-purpose language models , and game AI [ref]41, the ML models’ size is increasing explosively, from ResNet50  with 23M parameters to GPT-3  with 175B parameters. ML practitioners usually leverage distributed training (DT) systems to parallelize the modeling training algorithms for large models and datasets, and communication could become the bottleneck in this case. Recent works propose In-Network Aggregation (INA)  [ref]1 8   to overcome this bottleneck, but also elicit a new critical resource requirement: the switch memory. INA solutions organize switch memory, i.e., SRAM and TCAM, into aggregators, and place the gradients reduction into aggregators; such solutions can significantly reduce the in-network traffic volume, eliminate the bottleneck, and consequently accelerate the whole training job (e.g., 5.5X acceleration in SwitchML  for 8-server training DeepLight 5). Allocating a DT job with sufficient switch memory could effectively promote its training speed, otherwise, the DT job has to fall back to the original communication mode without such performance gain. However, switch memory is a scarce resource to support multiple INA jobs. Typical physical programmable switches, such as Tofino [ref]36, have only about 10MB memory per pipeline. And the physical memory is not used only for INA in practice — it also needs to support other network functionalities such as load balancing 2. The remaining memory can hardly support massive INA jobs. For example, one single job in SwitchML  takes up 1 MB in a 100Gbps setting; however, a production environment could have more than 5000 GPUs and tens of thousands of daily jobs . Thus, devising a reasonable switch memory usage model could efficiently promote massive DT jobs’ performance. Existing INA solutions have not utilized switch aggregators to the best extent. One class of INA solutions  8  statically partition the switch memory into isolated regions, and each job is assigned with one region. The switch memory is occupied at the granularity of a job’s lifetime, which is not efficiently used when the job is in computation. Another class [ref]1 maintain the switch memory as a shared resource pool and serve each job’s each aggregation task (defined as aggregating packets of the same sequence number from all workers) with non-preemptive first-come-first-serve (FCFS). The switch memory is occupied at the granularity of each aggregation task, which could be easily disturbed by the synchronization delay and worker stragglers. We propose ESA to efficiently utilize the switch aggregators. ESA is like a “cache replacement” system: once an aggregator (a cache unit) is not accessed for a while, it becomes cold and is replaced by another hot item. ESA consists of a data plane and a control plane. In the data plane, ESA has a priority-based preemption mechanism, where a task (packets) with a high priority can evict an existing low-priority task at the aggregator. In the control plane, ESA makes three intuitions to assign priority to tasks: model front layers, models with high communication-to-computation ratio, and models with a shorter remaining time should have higher priority. In the design of ESA, we overcome three challenges.\nFirst, in most existing INA solution implementations, the complex aggregation logic has already used up the switch resources, e.g., ATP exhausts all meter ALUs of stages 4-10 (total 12 stages), it is challenging to implement an extra preemption mechanism. ESA uses end-host PS to assist the switch aggregation, which handles various complex but low-probability corner cases, i.e., preemption or packet loss.\nSecond, preemption complicates the correctness guarantee at the transport layer. In a preemption, the evicted task’s packets are separated as two parts, and the partial result packets are more likely to lead to memory leak, wasted computation, and sliding window blocking. ESA devises a reliability channel and a reminder mechanism to handle all-case failures.\nThird, preemption should be carefully tuned. Low-frequency preemption would cause aggregators to spend more time in idle, and high-frequency preemption would cause aggregators to spend time on thrashing instead of aggregating. To avoid the idle or thrashing at aggregator (and the consequent performance degradation), ESA devises a priority assignment and downgrading policy for aggregation tasks. We have implemented an ESA prototype with programmable switches. We evaluate ESA on a small testbed with one Wedge100 programmable switch and 10 NVIDIA V100s and a 64-node NS3  simulation as a complement. In our experiment, we find that ESA outperforms SwitchML and ATP by up to 1.89×\\times and 1.35×\\times. Our deep dives further validate the effectiveness of our two main ideas, i.e., preemptive allocation and priority scheduling.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: Driven by the increasing complexity of Machine Learning (ML) applications, such as autonomous driving , general-purpose language models , and game AI [ref]41, the ML models’ size is increasing explosively, from ResNet50  with 23M parameters to GPT-3  with 175B parameters.
