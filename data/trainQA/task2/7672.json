      "content": "Paper Title: Image-Text Out-Of-Context Detection Using Synthetic Multimodal Misinformation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep generative models have achieved tremendous success in text-to-image (T2I) generation tasks and have recently attracted intensive attention. Existing T2I generation models can be categorized as GAN-based, VAE-based, and diffusion-based. Although GAN-based  and VAE-based models [ref]35 synthesize images with promising quality and diversity, they still cannot match user descriptions well. Diffusion-based models [ref]36 have demonstrated unprecedentedly high-quality and controllable image generation and have been broadly applied to T2I generation tasks. They were first introduced into T2I generation with classifier-free guidance. The introduction of the DALL-E deep learning model [ref]37 made it possible to perform zero-shot T2I generation with arbitrary text input. It quickly inspired several follow-up models, including Glide , a text-guided diffusion model supporting both image generation and editing. It implements the text generation feature in the transformer blocks used in the denoising process. The CogView model  is a transformer with a vector quantized-variational autoencoder  tokenizer similar to that in DALL-E [ref]37, and it supports Chinese text input. The Imagen model  has a T2I structure that does not use latent images and instead directly diffuses pixels using a pyramid structure. The Stable Diffusion model  is a large-scale implementation of the latent diffusion model (LDM)  that achieves T2I generation. These models use pre-trained large-scale text encoders to provide more controllable guidance signals. They either introduce super-resolution models or encode images into the low-dimensional latent space to achieve a trade-off between efficiency and high resolution.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: tasks and have recently attracted intensive attention.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
