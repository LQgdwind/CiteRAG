      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Code Summarization with Block-wise Abstract Syntax Tree Splitting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHuman-readable code summaries (i.e., code comments) are the key to enhance the comprehension of source code in software development and maintenance [ref]1 .\nAs software projects grow rapidly in scale and complexity, manual commenting becomes costly for developers.\nThere has been increasing interest in automatic code summarization , which automatically generates short and accurate textual descriptions for software entities and frees software developers from the tremendous workload of writing comprehensible comments. Early works on code summarization select a subset of the statements and\nkeywords from the code to generate comments .\nHowever, the grammar of programming languages strictly follows specific syntaxes, which is not easy to model using code tokens only. It is critical to encode both the meaning\nof each code token and the syntax structure when generating code summarization.\nAbstract\nSyntax Tree (AST), which depicts the hierarchical abstract syntactic structure of source code, is therefore commonly\nharnessed together with code tokens to improve the quality of code summarizations   [ref]6.\nNevertheless, it is infeasible to directly adopt the methods studying the syntax tree in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and apply tree-aware neural networks (e.g., Tree-LSTM ) in the code summarization task. The reason is that ASTs are quite different compared to NLP syntax trees.\nThe size of an AST in terms of tree depth is very large, leading to a heavy encoder which is difficult and slow to train. For instance, the maximum AST depth of the two datasets in our experiments (Sec. VI) is 76 (Java) and 112 (Python), which is rare for NLP syntax trees and weakens the capability of neural networks to capture the complex semantics [ref]8. Graph Neural Network (GNN)  based methods have the similar problem of the heavy encoder and their results do not show significant improvements over other methods in code summarization . To overcome the challenge of training over the entire AST, a great number of\nmethods are proposed. But they all produce inadequate\nsummaries. We now use the example from the Java dataset in our experiments to\nillustrate their limitations. In Fig. 1, reference\n(i.e., gold standard summary) fully reveals the hierarchical syntax in the AST\nand the long-term dependence in the source code. For example, in the\nhierarchical structure of the AST, “timemillis” is linked to\n“expire” to form a sub-clause, where the sub-clause is in turn linked\nto a connection status in an “if” clause. The “if” clause\ntriggers the “close” action via the long-term dependence.\nAccordingly, in the reference, “timemillis” in the “idle”\nclause complements “connection”. It also complements “close”\nwith “connection (if it has) idled for timemillis”. Next, let us see the results from contemporary code\nsummarization methods which can be roughly divided into three categories: Most works serialize ASTs and then adopt a sequential neural\nmodel. Specifically, an AST can be serialized as a single sequence of\nnodes     via traversal, or a collection of paths  [ref]6\n(i.e., several sequences of nodes). Serialized ASTs can be\neasily modeled, as modeling sequential natural language\ntokens , by sequential neural models such as Recurrent\nNeural Network (RNN) , Long Short Term Memory\n(LSTM) , Gated Recurrent Unit\n(GRU)  or Transformer . However, such a strategy encodes only the linear\norder syntax structure and inevitably loses hierarchical syntax\ninformation.\nIn Fig. 1,\nAST-attendgru , Hybrid-DeepCom  and\nRencos  which learn from serialized ASTs, are unable to\ncapture the relations (including “connection is expired” or\n“close the connection”) correctly and perform even worse than\nCode-NN  which does not consider ASTs. A few works simplify the tree structure of ASTs, e.g., transform an AST to a\nbinary tree 0. However, they change the\noriginal semantics of code and bring information\nloss 1.\nIn Fig. 1,\nHybrid-DRL 0, which learns from binarized AST, is unable\nto capture the long-term dependence between “connection is expired”\nand “close the connection” as well as the relation between\n“close” and “connection”. Last direction is most related to our work. ASTNN 1 splits an AST into small statement trees, and each tree consists of AST nodes of one statement. The statement tree is further encoded by Recursive Neural Network (RvNN) 2. This way, the difficulty of training is reduced. Nevertheless, such a strategy forces RvNN to focus on one statement each time, as it only see one statement in each split AST. The long-term dependence, which is beyond the boundary of one statement, cannot be captured by RvNN only. If the subsequent sequential neural model fails to fuse multiple statement trees well, the generated summary will solely contain information from one statement. For instance, in Fig. 1, ASTNN fails to capture the dependence between “connection is expired” and “close the connection”. More analysis can be found in Sec. VI-C. In this paper, we propose the Block-wise Abstract Syntax Tree Splitting (BASTS) to address aforementioned issues.\nSpecifically, we split the code of a method based on the blocks in the dominator tree 3 of the Control Flow Graph of the method 4, instead of statements in the code , to capture the information beyond the boundary of one statement.\nAfter splitting, for each split code, we generate a split AST, which is modeled by a Tree-LSTM.\nFurthermore, inspired by fine-tuning a pre-trained model on specific tasks in NLP 5, we adopt pre-training to learn split AST representations by predicting next split AST in the dominator tree.\nA high-quality comment requires understanding of both local dependence and long-term dependence. Therefore,\nwe combine the split AST representations with the source code representations in the Transformer architecture  which has the ability to model both types of dependences.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, only BASTS accurately recovers all relations in the reference. The proposed BASTS framework has three advantages: Through code splitting, each AST is reduced to an affordable tree propagation space for building the Tree-LSTM, and each block still retains sufficient information. Thus, BASTS is efficient and scalable for large programs. Pre-training involves only the syntax representations. Hence, by first pre-training and then fine-tuning the syntax representations with token representations, BASTS saves computational resources, compared to building both representations from scratch. Moreover, the pre-training is unsupervised, which is endowed with the potential to handle sparse training data without sufficient code comments. BASTS is effective since it learns both long-term dependencies on tokens (i.e., with the attention mechanism of Transformer) and local hierarchical dependencies on syntax structures (i.e., with Tree-LSTM in the local context). In summary, the contributions of this paper are: We present BASTS which incorporates normal tree structure of AST rather than serialized AST or binary AST to avoid information loss in code representation learning. We improve automatic code summarization by using block-wise AST splitting, pre-training and Transformer to effectively learn local and hierarchical syntax dependences. We conduct comprehensive experiments on benchmarks for code summarization to verify the effectiveness of BASTS. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We present an overview of\nBASTS in Sec. II. We illustrate the block-wise code splitting\nin Sec. III. We describe in detail the neural models of\npre-training syntax representations in Sec. IV and code\nsummarization in Sec. V. We report and analyze the\nexperimental results in Sec. VI. We elaborate on related\nwork in Sec. VII.
