      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-Task Text Classification using Graph Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Low Resource Language\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGCN for Text Classification:\nIn the current research, graph neural networks has attracted wide attention [ref]23, and applied on various NLP tasks such as text classification  [ref]18, semantic role labeling , and machine translation .\nThe earlier works in text classification using GCN focused with nodes being either words or documents to construct a single large graph .\nSome authors construct a single graph by jointly embedding the documents and words as nodes (Text GCN) [ref]18 while considering the global relations between documents and words.\nThe main drawback of the existing GCN works is that they cannot capture the contextual word relationships within the document.\n  developed a model, TextING, for inductive text classification to overcome the above limitations.\n  introduced GCN to embed the graph structure in a lower embedding space using neural networks.\nMotivated by ,  propose a graph AutoEncoder framework that uses GCN as an encoder to get the latent representation of each node and simple inner product as a decoder to reconstruct the graph. Deep Learning for Multi-Task Text Classification:\nThere is a vast literature tackling the single-task text (ST-Text) classification using deep learning models such as CNNs   or RNNs [ref]22.\nHowever, these ST-Text classification approaches increase costs to build the resources and fail to combine multiple tasks.\nMulti-task learning can improve the classification performance of related tasks by learning these tasks in parallel .\nThe literature survey shows that multi-task learning has been proven effective in solving similar NLP text classification problems [ref]22 . Text Classification for Telugu:\nAlthough extensive research happens in NLP tasks for the English, very few authors in literature worked on text classification (SA tasks) for Telugu language   .\nIn  , authors provided Telugu SA data for different domains, categorized into three classes as “positive”, “negative”, and “neutral”.\nSeveral authors use deep learning-based models such as CNN and LSTM to perform SA tasks on Telugu data in  .\nThe authors in  used a semantic representation of each sentence using Telugu Word2Vec embeddings created on Wikipedia.\nHowever, the corpus size is minimal (e.g., Telugu SA dataset  has only 2500 samples), leading to relatively brittle systems.\nAlso, the authors use a 2X (two annotators perform the annotation) annotated dataset.\nRecently,  developed a deep learning-based model for Telugu SA to learn representations of resource-poor languages by jointly training with English corpora using a Siamese network. Here, the model trained on English - Hindi corpus and transfer learning is applied to the Telugu corpus, resulting in low accuracy.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: GCN for Text Classification:\nIn the current research, graph neural networks has attracted wide attention [ref]23, and applied on various NLP tasks such as text classification  [ref]18, semantic role labeling , and machine translation .\nThe earlier works in text classification using GCN focused with\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
