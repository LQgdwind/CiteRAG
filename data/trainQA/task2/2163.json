      "content": "Paper Title: pix2rule: End-to-end Neuro-symbolic Rule Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNeuro-symbolic [ref]12 architectures and methods have a prolific history. We can categorise related work based on how neural or symbolic they are.\nOn the far neural end of the spectrum, we can consider deep neural networks designed to perform symbolic manipulation such as Neural Turing Machines  and its successor the Differentiable Neural Computer . They attempt to create universal computers that can be trained and, in theory, perform symbol manipulation for example by solving algorithmic tasks. However, how they perform symbolic representation and manipulation is not clear. Studies of algorithmic tasks using recurrent neural network based controllers suggest limitations in the extent of symbolic manipulation by continuous dense representations . This symbolic manipulation can also extend to program execution with Neural-program interpreters  and Neural Symbolic Machines  which operate in discrete steps but use reinforcement learning in doing so. Discrete data-structures such as stacks have also been used in aid of this problem such as Stack-augmented Recurrent Nets . Going one step closer to symbolic, architectural biases are often added to constrain and refine the behaviour of neural networks. For example, Relation Networks  create a pairwise object representation bottleneck and demonstrate improvements in visual question answering tasks. This architectural inductive bias can be traced to many models all the way and including PrediNet 4. More recently, an application of rule based systems that also use Gumbel-Softmax [ref]32 to sharpen the rule selection was proposed with Neural Production Systems . Unsupervised deep representation learning using auto-encoders were also shown to work in the planning domain where the latent representation was converted to propositional atoms  . In relation to the subgraph isomorphism problem, one can also deploy graph neural networks  that utilise message passing between nodes. In particular, Graph Matching Networks  are designed to determine graph similarities but it remains unknown how the matched graphs could be extracted from continuous weights. Methods described so far do not consider logical formalisms or logic programs. DeepLogic  provides a first insight into attempts of learning symbolic reasoning in an end-to-end fashion using memory networks  8 which has gated recurrent-units (GRU)  as the basis of symbolic manipulation.\nNeural Logic Machines  use principles of forward-chaining 1 with nullary, unary and binary predicates implemented as MLPs with input permutations to tackle algorithmic tasks. However, due to the use of MLPs, the learnt rules or reasoning steps cannot be symbolically extracted.\nOur approach falls in this section of the spectrum: constrain or make neural networks exhibit behaviours of logical reasoning. That is, to build an architecture with the right biases in order to learn and leverage structured logical reasoning in the form of objects, relations and rules. Going further away from deep neural networks, logic based architectures become more prominent. For example, Lifted Relational Neural Networks 7 use rule sets as templates for constructing neural networks, i.e. the connection paths. Logic Tensor Networks 3 use dense embeddings of constants while also constructing a deductive neural network. TensorLog  similarly builds factor graphs which in return yield the neural network architecture.\nThese approaches have similarities to the more recent Logical Neural Networks 7 which assemble neural networks from logical formulae and constrain the weights to achieve conjunction and disjunction semantics. Our more flexible approach is not bound to a fixed logic program and does not require any constraints on the weights whilst also handling negation. One could also use distributed representations for constants or predicates. For example similarity between vectors could provide basis for a logical calculus 9. Neural Theorem Provers 8 learn embeddings of predicates by unrolling given logic programs using backward-chaining , effectively following the steps of symbolic reasoning prior to any learning. These works have been inspired by word embeddings 9 4  that capture distributional semantics of words. More recently, Neural Datalog 8 uses vector representations along with a datalog program to improve performance of temporal modelling. Closer to the symbolic end of the spectrum, one could also attempt to decompose or parse continuous input completely into symbolic entities or concepts and then perform symbolic reasoning. Neural scene parsing as done in Neuro-Symbolic VQA  and following works, completely decompose images into objects, their properties before performing visual question answering. For synthetic datasets where the decomposition is successful, it outperforms any end-to-end approach. We consider scene parsing closer to symbolic approaches since the reasoning about objects and their relations is not done by neural networks but by the manually engineered reinforcement learning environment with pre-defined functions. Neuro-symbolic Concept Learner 7 extends scene decomposition by learning concepts given in a parsed question such as red in a joint fashion using reinforcement learning in which the environment is a symbolic program executor. Moving away from neural networks but attempting to harness gradient descent, we have approaches such as δ𝛿\\delta-ILP  and derivations 5 which implement t-norms to create differentiable logic programs to find a suitable hypothesis in an ILP setting. More recently, by directly modelling rule membership of atoms as learnable weights, Neural Logic Networks 3 2 provide a competitive differentiable ILP system that leverages gradient descent.\nThe influence of gradient descent can also be found in full symbolic reasoning systems like DeepProblog 6 and NeurASP  which attempt to propagate gradients through logic programs in order to train input neural networks such as CNNs that recognise hand-written digits and perform addition of the recognised digits.\nThis resembles continuous formulations of logic such as differentiable stable and supported semantics that utilise matrix multiplications and non-linear activations to realise logic operations .\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: Neuro-symbolic [ref]12 architectures and methods have a prolific history.
