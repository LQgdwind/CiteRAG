In this work we extend the training period to 2006-18. But some models achieved better results on the shorter period 2016-18, and some of them were not able to learn on data with missing values (about 40% of the countries have incomplete data in the period 2006-2015). For these models, which are marked with an asterisk in Table I, we provide results for the shorter training period.\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: layer and sigmoid nonlinearities , SVM ‚Äì linear epsilon insensitive support vector machine (œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon-SVM) , LSTM ‚Äì long short-term memory , ANFIS ‚Äì adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system [ref]48, MTGNN ‚Äì graph NN for multivariate TS forecasting [ref]49.
