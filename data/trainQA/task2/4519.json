      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Semantic Communications: Deep Learning-Based Image Semantic Coding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDating back to 1949, Weaver 0 defined three levels of communications: the bit level, the semantic level, and the effective level. The conventional communications falls into the bit level, where the receiver recovers the raw data by maximizing the accuracy of symbol transmission; The semantic communications interprets information at the semantic level and attempts to transmit the symbol that precisely conveys the desired meaning, instead of bit copy; The effective level concerns how effectively would the received meaning affect the behavior of the receiver in the desired way. Recently, deep learning achieves a breakthrough in semantic analysis task such as NLP, image processing, and speech recognition, etc, and therefore it paves the way for building the semantic communication systems and enables intelligent communication for human-to-machine as well as machine-to-machine. Recent works mainly focus on semantic communications for text/speech modalities    , and therefore can be categorize as text semantic communications(TSC). A deep learning based joint source-channel coding (JSCC) of text is proposed in , which achieves lower word error rate and preserves semantic information of sentences. Later, the authors of  design an reinforcement learning (RL) based semantic communication system to deal with the non-differentiability of semantic metrics and interact with the surrounding noisy environment. Actually, the vision modal is more informative than text modal, and the video/image traffic accounts for 75% of IP traffic nowadays . However, the huge amount of multimedia traffic encounters the transmission challenges such as delay and network congestion, which are difficult to be solved by the conventional communication techniques. Hence, it is more important to build the image semantic communications (ISC) that can remarkably reduce the amount of data to be transmitted without sacrificing the semantic fidelity of the image. The earlier attempt of semantic image communications [ref]8   developed the JSCC method and achieved good performance in the challenging low signal-to-noise (SNR) and small bandwidth regimes. The work [ref]8 maps the image pixel values directly to the complex-valued channel input symbols and learns noise resilient coded representations, and therefore outperforms separation-based digital communication at all SNR. Later, Kurka et.al  proposed an multiple-description JSCC scheme for bandwidth-agile image transmission. The attention DL based JSCC for image transmission  successfully operates with different SNR levels during transmission. However, the aforementioned works lack the interpretation ability of the image content. Actually, the main issue of the ISC is to discard the goal of precise reconstruction and pursue semantic fidelity of the reconstructed image even in aggressive compression ratio. The bit level image communications such as the standard codecs    and deep learning based codecs      aim to solve the rate-distortion optimization (RDO) problem. They exactly recover the transmitted image data at the receiver side by processing the image in pixel level, and therefore gradually approach the compression limits of Shannon’s information theory. The highly compressed image essentially deviate from human perception and suffers from degradation such as blocking, ringing, blurry, and checkerboard artifacts [ref]2  that cause poor performance in semantic analysis tasks such as classification, detection, and segmentation 7 3.\nTherefore, blindly minimizing pixel-wise distortion may bring unnecessary bit overhead. The work  states that the conventional distortion metric Mean Squared\nError (MSE) in compression cannot fulfill the requirements of desirable intelligent task performance, and it is essential to exploit machine-centric evaluation metrics for high inference accuracy. Some preliminary studies have tried to leverage the semantic similarity as the reconstruction criterion, which tolerates certain pixel-level errors and evaluates the usefulness of the reconstructed image in the sense that it better serves for the downstream semantic analysis task . The semantic similarity metric is successfully applied in low bitrate facial image compression  , where aggressive compression ratio is realized by filtering out the task irrelevant information. However, their supported analysis task is limited to face recognition and cannot be generalized to other applications. A task-driven semantic coding with the traditional hybrid coding framework integrates the semantic fidelity metric into the optimization process, and implements the semantic bit allocation based on reinforcement learning . However, its traditional HEVC framework still process the image at pixel level and lacks the interpretation ability.\nA detection-driven image compression with semantically structured bit-stream is proposed in 9, where each part of the bitstream represents a specific object. Later on, the work  generalizes the semantically structured image coding framework to multiple intelligent tasks. However, it follows the common practice in the traditional hybrid compression framework and utilize predictive coding to reconstruct the image in pixel-level. Torfason et al.  verified that semantic analysis such as classification and segmentation, can be\nperformed on the bitstream directly without image decoding. However, it cannot produce high quality natural image reconstruction, and the bitstream still describes the entire image without semantic structure. Moreover, all of the above methods cannot meet the semantic and perception  performance requirements jointly in low bit rate. Actually, different regions of the image vary in semantic importance and should be encoded adaptively with appropriate bitrate. Reinforcement learning is a promising method to extract the task-related information and adaptively encode different regions by selecting the optimal discrete quantization coefficients. Moreover, the adversarial loss of GANs 6  captures the distribution of natural images and coincide with human perception. However, it is not feasible to directly adopt the naive GANs for image semantic decoding, since the generated image tend to deviate significantly from the input image in fine-grained features  [ref]2 . In this paper, we propose an RL-based adaptive semantic coding (RL-ASC) approach to jointly address the semantic similarity and perceptual performance issues for ISC. The bandwidth burden could be remarkably alleviated due to the relaxing of precision requirements. Our contribution are summarized as follows: We propose a novel representation unit named semantic concept that contains the category, feature and spatial relation of each object. A convolutional semantic encoder is proposed to extract semantic concepts at the transmitter and transform them into bit streams. We propose a task-driven image semantic coding framework that adopts new reconstruction criterion rate-semantic-perceptual loss. We present an RL-based semantic bit allocation model to assign the optimal discrete quantization coefficients and achieve adaptive coding. We propose an attention-based generative semantic decoder at the receiver to reconstruct the image with high perceptual quality in an aggressive compression ratio. Particularly, both global and local generators are learned to capture the global and category-wise features. The rest of this work is organized as follows. In Section II, we propose the RL-ASC method to optimize the rate-semantic-perceptual criterion. In Section III, the soft quantizer, the network architecture of attention-based generative semantic decoder as well as the training algorithm are proposed. The experiment details and the performance are shown in Section IV, and the conclusions are made in Section V.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: communications (ISC) that can remarkably reduce the amount of data to be transmitted without sacrificing the semantic fidelity of the image.
