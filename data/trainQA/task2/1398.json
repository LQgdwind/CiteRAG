On KITTI dataset , the projection is calculated as follows: where Tc​a​m←l​i​d​a​rsubscript𝑇←𝑐𝑎𝑚𝑙𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑟T_{cam\\leftarrow lidar} is the transformation matrix from LiDAR coordinates to\ncamera coordinates, Rr​e​c​t0superscriptsubscript𝑅𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡0R_{rect}^{0} is the rectifying rotation matrix of the left camera,\nand Pr​e​c​t0superscriptsubscript𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡0P_{rect}^{0} is the calibration matrix of the left camera. On nuScenes dataset [ref]1,\nthe points in LiDAR coordinates are first transformed to the ego car’s global coordinates since the LiDAR (20Hz) and camera (12Hz) work at different frequencies.\nTherefore, the transformation is calculated as follows: where Te​g​o←l​i​d​a​rsubscript𝑇←𝑒𝑔𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑟T_{ego\\leftarrow lidar} is the transformation matrix from LiDAR to the ego pose at timestamp tlsubscript𝑡𝑙t_{l} when the LiDAR frame is recorded,\nTe​g​oc←e​g​olsubscript𝑇←𝑒𝑔subscript𝑜𝑐𝑒𝑔subscript𝑜𝑙T_{ego_{c}\\leftarrow ego_{l}} is the transformation matrix from ego pose at timestamp tlsubscript𝑡𝑙t_{l} to the ego pose at timestamp tcsubscript𝑡𝑐t_{c} when the camera frame is captured,\nand Tc​a​m←e​g​osubscript𝑇←𝑐𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑔𝑜T_{cam\\leftarrow ego} is the transformation matrix from ego pose at timestamp tcsubscript𝑡𝑐t_{c} to the camera. Multi-modality cut and paste.\nMulti-modality cut and paste (MoCa) needs ground-truth instance masks to paste image patches of objects, as in   .\nFor KITTI dataset, we use the instance masks in KINS dataset  to build the multi-modality GT database.\nFor nuScenes dataset, we use pseudo instance masks predicted by an instance segmentation model.\nSpecifically, we first train an HTC  with ResNeXt 32×\\times4d backbone on COCO dataset with 3×\\times schedule [ref]4.\nThen we fine-tune the HTC on nuImages dataset by 20 epochs and use that model to predict instance masks of images in nuScenes dataset. Training details.\nOn KITTI dataset, both SECOND  and MVX-Net [ref]43 are trained by 80 epochs with a batch size of 16.\nWe adopt a half-period cosine schedule 0 for learning rate decaying and use a linear warm-up strategy in the first 1K iterations.\nThe initial learning rate is 0.003 for all the 3D detectors that use ADAM  optimizer.\nWhen retaining the original optimizers (Sec. 3.3) for MVX-Net, we train the image branch using SGD optimizer with momentum and the initial learning rate is 0.05.\nThe hyperparameters for point cloud branch remain the same as those for SECOND. For nuScenes dataset [ref]1,\nboth PointPillars  and MVX-Net [ref]43 are trained by 20 epochs with batch sizes of 32 and 16, respectively.\nNotably, this is different from the official implementation [ref]1, where PointPillars  is trained by 125 epochs, which costs much time.\nWe adopt step learning rate decaying schedule following the practice in mmdetection [ref]4, i.e., the learning rate is decayed by 0.1 after the 16th and 19th epoch, respectively.\nThe initial learning rate is 0.001 for all the 3D detectors using ADAM  optimizer.\nWhen training MVX-Net, we also retains the original optimizers, where the image branch is trained by SGD optimizer with momentum and the initial learning rate is 0.0012.\nThe hyperparameters for point cloud branch remain the same as those for PointPillars. Because one training sample for MVX-Net contains six images from multiple views and one LiDAR point cloud frame, each GPU can only contain one training sample during each iteration.\nThis degrades the performance siginificantly because the batch size in one GPU is so small that the inaccurate statistics in Batch Normalization (BN)  affects the training process.\nTherefore, we use Syncronized Batch Normalization (SyncBN)  to solve this issue.\nWe report all the results of our methods using SyncBN in Table 2 and 8 on nuScenes dataset of the main paper.\nWe do not use SyncBN for models on KITTI dataset because the batch size is 2 in each GPU as there is only one image and one LiDAR point cloud frame in one training sample.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: is the rectifying rotation matrix of the left camera,\nand Pr​e​c​t0superscriptsubscript𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡0P_{rect}^{0} is the calibration matrix of the left camera.
