Research suggests that humans develop physical reasoning capabilities within just the first year of birth  [ref]3. Even though it has been challenging to develop AI systems that can do general physical reasoning as good as humans do  [ref]5, there is work that shows AI systems that could achieve human performance in some physical reasoning tasks  . But the question is: is it adequate to only have physical reasoning capabilities to successfully work in the real physical world? Encountering novel situations is an inherent characteristic of the real world (Figure 1). As humans, we are adept at working in such novel situations that we constantly face in our day-to-day life. For example, consider a person who can ride a bicycle on a normal road. On a rainy day when the roads are slick, the person can still ride the bicycle safely by adjusting the speed and applying the brakes smoothly without slipping. Even though sometimes a human may initially take a suboptimal decision when facing a novel situation, they usually quickly recover successfully after continuing to work for a short period of time under the influence of novelty.\nSimilarly, for an agent that operates in an open-world physical environment, along with physical reasoning capabilities, it is crucial to possess capabilities that are required to handle novel situations , i.e., novelty detection and adaptation capabilities. In contrast to the intelligence of humans, current AI systems tend to struggle when they are presented with situations that were not available during their training stage or if the situation was not anticipated by the developers 1. This could be due to the fact that the research field, Open World Learning (OWL), attempting to address this issue is relatively new 2 3 4.\nApart from that, not having adequate testbeds to experiment and evaluate such AI systems also hinders their advancement. There are frameworks such as Monopoly 4, Polycraft 5, Cartpole 6, etc, that treat novelties as first-class citizens and facilitate agent experimentation. Even though some of them are physics based environments 6, none of them specifically focus on introducing novelties to the physical scenarios that an agent would encounter in the real world. Also, it is out of their context to evaluate agents in real-world physical tasks in the presence of novelties. To fill the above gaps, we propose a new novelty-centric testbed, NovPhy, where agents need to perform in real-world physical scenarios in the presence of novelties. NovPhy includes a wide variety of novelties applied to different physical scenarios. We implement our testbed on the physics-based video game Angry Birds as it has realistic physics and it is a versatile domain to introduce physics-based novelties. Moreover, Angry Birds is popular in both physical reasoning research [ref]5 7 8 and OWL research 9 0 1. The main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows: NovPhy - A testbed for novelty detection and adaptation in physical environments:  We consider five commonly encountered physical scenarios in NovPhy: applying a single force and multiple forces, and rolling, falling, and sliding objects. We developed eight novelties representing a diverse novelty space. We designed task templates by applying the eight novelties to the five physical scenarios separately, resulting in 40 novel task templates. A task template is used to generate related tasks by varying task template parameters such as the locations of the objects. We also created 40 corresponding normal task templates without novelties to facilitate our evaluation protocol. Further, we developed a task variation generator that can generate an unlimited amount of tasks from these task templates. Agent evaluation setups for open-world physical environments:  We propose a comprehensive evaluation setup to evaluate the novelty detection and adaptation of AI systems in open-world physical environments. In this setup the novelties are orthogonal to the physical scenarios, hence facilitating us to evaluate agents in two settings: first, the same novelty is applied separately to the tasks of multiple physical scenarios, and second, multiple novelties are applied separately to the tasks of the same physical scenario. The former is used to evaluate how well an agent can deal with the same novelty in different physical reasoning tasks and the latter is used to evaluate how well an agent can perform the same physical reasoning task under different novel situations. Establishing results for baseline agents:  We evaluate 11 baseline agents. Three heuristic-based agents, two standard online learning agents, two standard offline agents, three adaptive learning agents, and a random agent. We report their novelty detection and novelty adaptation performance. Establishing baseline human performance:  In order to show our novelties are adaptable for humans, we conducted an experiment using human players in our testbed. These results also show that humans can detect and adapt to novelties better and faster compared to AI agents, thus acting as a milestone performance for AI to achieve.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: about the physical behaviour of objects and make decisions in the physical environment .
