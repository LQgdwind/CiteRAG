      "content": "Paper Title: GFlowCausal: Generative Flow Networks for Causal Discovery\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe introduce details about baselines in this section. The implmentation and codes are available in Appendix¬†8. NOTEARS [ref]11 firstly attempts the continuous optimization to learn the underlying causal structure from data. it proposes the smooth characterization for acyclicity constraints, and recovers the causal graph via estimating the weighted adjacency matrix with the least squares loss with a predefined threshoding. ICA-LiNGAM  assumes linear Non-Gaussian additive model for data generating procedure and applies independent component analysis to recover the weighted adjacency matrix. S  recovers the causal graph by estimating the weighted adjacency matrix with the least squares loss and the smooth characterization for acyclicity constraint, followed by thresholding on the estimated weights. DAG-GNN [ref]14 formulates causal discovery in the framework of variational autoencoder for nonlinear data. It uses a modified smooth characterization for acyclicity and optimizes a weighted adjacency matrix with the evidence lower bound as loss function. PC  is a classic causal discovery algorithm based on conditional independence tests. GraN-DAG  models the conditional distribution of each variable given its parents with feed-forward NNs. It also uses the smooth acyclicity constraint from NOTEARS. RL-BIC2 [ref]12 proposes to use reinforcement learning to search for the DAG with the best score. It considers encoder-decoder models for graph generation and incorporates both bayesian information criteira and the smooth acyclicity constraint from NOTEARS as the penalty for calculating the score of each DAG. However, the acyclicity constraint has ùí™‚Äã(d3)ùí™superscriptùëë3\\mathcal{O}(d^{3}) complexity for each graph and it could not guarantee the valid graphs. The further penalties and related parameters make RL-BIC2 need carefully fine tuning. CORL formulates the causal discovery as causal ordering search problem. It establishes a canonical correspondence between the ordering and the fully-connected DAG, and then each step the RL solver selects one variable to model the markov decision process. After finding the ordering who could achieve the best score, it conducts the variable selections with pruning based on the significance testing. DAG-GFlowNet  formulates the bayesian structure learning with GFlowNets, in which the edges are added gradually to construct direct acyclic graphs. The forward transition probability is defined as follows, in which it distinguishes the terminal state and interior state.\nThis work proposes an adjusted flow matching objective, the detailed balance condition, to fit the stopping criteria of sampling as follows, When sampling invalid actions, for example, introducing cycle among variables or take a repeated action. For DAG-GFlowNet, every DAG is potential candidate and it chooses the DAG with high scores.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: We introduce details about baselines in this section.
