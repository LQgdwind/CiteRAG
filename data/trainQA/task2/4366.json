Whilst existing works mostly focus on image recognition tasks  , how to capitalize the knowledge of such ViL models for natural video understanding tasks (e.g., temporal action detection [ref]20 7  [ref]28    6 6 7) remains unsolved largely.\nThere are several challenges to be solved.\nFirst, as those public accessible large ViL models\nare often pretrained with big image data, temporal structured information is absent which is limited for video representation.\nSecond, ViL models favor classification type of tasks\nwithout built-in detection capability in formulation.\nThat is, their optimization assumes implicitly limited background\nw.r.t the foreground content with the training data. In contrast,\nnatural videos often come with a large, variable proportion of background, and detecting the content of interest (e.g., human actions) is critical .\nIt is non-trivial to overcome these obstacles.\nOn using ViL models for temporal action detection (TAD), indeed a recent attempt 7 is made.\nSpecifically, 7 presents a two-stage video model:\ngenerating many action proposals with an off-the-shelf pre-trained proposal detector (e.g., BMN [ref]20), followed by proposal classification.\nThis method has obvious limitations:\n(1) It is unable to adapt the localization module (i.e., proposal detection) which is pretrained and frozen throughout.\n(2) As a result, the compatibility between the localization and classification is limited, further leading to a localization error propagation problem due to the sequential localization and classification pipeline. In this paper, to overcome the aforementioned limitations, we formulate a novel one-stage zero-shot temporal action localization architecture\ncharacterized with parallel classification and localization.\nThis parallel head design naturally eliminates error propagation.\nImportantly, we introduce a learnable localization module based on\na notion of representation masking – which is class-agnostic\nand hence generalizable to unseen classes.\nIt can be optimized end-to-end, together with the classification component\npowered by a ViL model for zero-shot transfer, consequently solving the component compatibility problem.\nFor improving cross-modal (from image to video) task adaptation,\nwe further design an inter-stream alignment regularization\nalong with the self-attention mechanism.\nWe term our method Zero-Shot Temporal Action Detection Model via Vision-LanguagE Prompting (STALE). Contributions.\n(1) We investigate the under-studied yet critical problem of how to capitalize large pretrained ViL models for zero-shot temporal action localization (ZS-TAD) in untrimmed videos.\n(2) We present a novel one-stage model, STALE,\nfeatured with a parallel classification and localization design\ninterleaved by a learnable class-agnostic representation masking component\nfor enabling zero-shot transfer to unseen classes.\nFor enhancing cross-modal task adaptation,\nwe introduce an inter-stream alignment regularization\nin the Transformer framework.\n(3) Extensive experiments on standard ZS-TAD video benchmarks\nshow that our STALE outperforms state-of-the-art alternative methods, often by a large margin.\nBesides, our model can be also applied to the fully supervised TAD setting and achieve superior performance in comparison to recent supervised competitors.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: space.
