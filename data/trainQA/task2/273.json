      "content": "Paper Title: High Bandwidth Memory on FPGAs: A Data Analytics Perspective Kaan Kara12, Christoph Hagleitner2, Dionysios Diamantopoulos2, Dimitris Syrivelis2, Gustavo Alonso1\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPerforming machine learning (ML) within a DBMS is becoming increasingly important, with all major vendors now offering this functionality   [ref]32.\nSince ML has different requirements than traditional analytics, recent work has focused on providing accelerators to perform in-database ML efficiently   . In this paper, we focus on training generalized linear models (e.g., linear/logistic regression) with SGD. Recent work shows the advantage of using FPGAs : The SGD accelerator can be designed as a fully pipelined dataflow architecture, saturating the memory bandwidth (6.5 GB/s) on their target platform (Xeon+FPGA ). HBM has therefore a large potential for improving SGD with a scale-out architecture on the FPGA and provide an even more pronounced advantage over general purpose processors. SGD is an optimization algorithm that minimizes problems of the following form: where (𝐚1,b1),…,(𝐚m,bm)∈([−1,1]n×ℝ)subscript𝐚1subscript𝑏1…subscript𝐚𝑚subscript𝑏𝑚superscript11𝑛ℝ(\\mathbf{a}_{1},b_{1}),...,(\\mathbf{a}_{m},b_{m})\\in([-1,1]^{n}\\times\\mathbb{R}) is a set of samples and J:ℝn×ℝ→[0,∞):𝐽→superscriptℝ𝑛ℝ0J:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\times\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow[0,\\infty) is a non-negative convex loss function.\nSGD is shown in Algorithm 3. FPGA Implementation. \nWe implement FPGA-based SGD following a similar architecture as related work , shown in Figure 9.\nThe dataset is scanned N𝑁N times (number of epochs) and forwarded to the compute modules.\nThese modules (Dot, ScalarEngine, and Update) work in a parallel dataflow fashion, as illustrated in Figure 9, ensuring full utilization. Unlike Kara et al.  we do not allow stale updates to the model that can happen due to the latency of the entire pipeline and read-after-write dependencies (between lines 4 and 7).\nWe thus ensure high quality convergence, but have to accept a lower processing rate for low-dimensional datasets and lower minibatch sizes, since the entire pipeline as shown in Figure 9 cannot be filled in those cases.\nNevertheless, considering the processing rate of only one engine, even in the worst case we match Kara et al.  (6.5 GB/s) and exceed it by 1.7x in the best case, thanks to the higher bandwidth we get from one HBM-shim port.\nWe use one bitstream with 14 SGD engines in the system architecture (Figure 3); all engines capable of performing SGD in parallel, reading data from the HBM and writing the trained model back. Evaluation. \nWe evaluate the SGD implementation using the datasets listed in Table II, considering the popular hyperparameter search use case occurring frequently in real world scenarios : Multiple models are trained on the same dataset, however with differing hyperparameters, to find the best set that achieves the highest test score.\nThis problem is trivially parallel, but requires many processors and is usually performed using entire clusters.\nOur goal is to show that 1 FPGA with an HBM can replace multiple CPUs for performing this work, in an in-database ML setting.\nSGD is an iterative algorithm: data is read multiple times; so the initial copy cost from the CPU to the FPGA is negligible (<<1% of total runtime). Evaluation: Processing rate. Figure 10(a) shows how the processing rate scales with the number of parallel jobs, for training the last layer of an InceptionV3 neural network [ref]36 for a binary classification problem, using the IM dataset. There are 28 hyperparameter configurations to search, resulting in 28 training jobs, each can be performed in parallel.\nThe plotted processing rate is calculated by dividing the total size of the consumed data (number of epochs ×\\times dataset size) by the end-to-end runtime (including copying of the trained model to CPU’s memory).\nWe observe that the FPGA scales until 14, since there are 14 engines, reaching 156 GB/s processing rate at the peak. When using 28 parallel threads, the XeonE5 can reach maximum 34 GB/s while POWER9 reaches 49 GB/s. As in the microbenchmarks (Section II), how the data is accessed is incredibly important for HBM performance: If there is only one copy of the dataset, it creates a bottleneck when accessing the HBM from 14 engines in parallel, diminishing the HBM advantage (Figure 10(a)): FPGA-nonreplicated rate stays at 12.8 GB/s and does not scale with the number of engines used.\nTo utilize the HBM, we have to replicate the dataset such that each engine can access its own physical memory channel without utilizing the crossbar.\nThe replication will not be possible if the dataset is larger than 512 MiB (the size of 2 physical memory channels on the HBM, exposed as an AXI3 port by the HBM-shim in Section III).\nHowever, in that case a blockwise scan approach can be followed :\nA block of the dataset that fits 512 MiB is read for multiple epochs and then gets exchanged for the next block, and so on. This reduces the IO complexity between the CPU and the FPGA while replication leads to high bandwidth from HBM. Evaluation: Effect of dimensionality. In Figure 10(b) we show how the processing rates across platforms and datasets differ. Lower dimensional datasets (AEA) lead to lower processing rate per engine because the SGD pipeline (Figure 9) cannot be kept at 100% utilization. The reason is that we keep the read-after-write (RAW) dependency (lines 4 and 7 in Algorithm 3) in SGD, causing bubbles during the processing if the dataset is low dimensional. In certain cases, the RAW dependency can be ignored in FPGA-based implementations , since SGD tends to be tolerant against constant stale updates.\nHowever, the tolerance is not guaranteed especially if the samples are ordered in a certain fashion, so we choose to respect the RAW dependency to get high quality convergence. Evaluation: Minibatch size. Figure 11 shows the convergence over time for minibatch sizes used during SGD on the FPGA.\nLarger minibatch sizes increase pipeline utilization, leading to higher processing rate and therefore faster convergence.\nThe goal here is to show that we can converge to the same loss, when increasing the minibatch size from 1 to 16, while achieving significant speedup.\nAccordingly, we use 16 in all SGD experiments both on the CPU and the FPGA (Figure 9).\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: Performing machine learning (ML) within a DBMS is becoming increasingly important, with all major vendors now offering this functionality   [ref]32.\nSince ML has different requirements than traditional analytics, recent work has focused on providing accelerators to perform in-database ML efficiently   .
