      "content": "Paper Title: IAdet: Simplest human-in-the-loop object detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the last ten years, deep supervised learning has revolutionized many areas of science and has found widespread applications [ref]14.\nAlthough the deep learning community has used overparameterized functions for much more than vanilla supervised learning [ref]35, supervision is still of great importance for most applications .\nTo upgrade supervised learning, the community has developed new architectures [ref]15, learning methodologies (e.g. few-shot , semi-supervised , active , self-supervised , online ), and interactive tools . Although some of these methods deal with the lack of annotated data, free tools that put the different arts together from annotation to a trained model are hard to find. Such a tool would just require an annotator and (ideally little) time to obtain a solid deep learning model. This paper presents the simplest example of such a tool for the specific application of single-class object detection. The tool is called IAdet, where IA stands for [Intelligent, Interactive, Incremental] Annotation.\nIAdet is an example of the IA framework and it is kept as simple as possible: the main goal of this work is to present the IA scheme (this Section) and an evaluation methodology (Section 4). This article also shows that the simplest implementation is already valuable for the single-class object detection problem (Section 5), and that performances could be much better (Section 6). The IA scheme comprises three components shown in Figure 1.\nThese components are not specific to object detection but are general research fields themselves. The first component is an assisted annotation tool, which allows the user to quickly make annotations. The second component is the deep learning model, which ideally achieves great performance while being very data-efficient and fast to train. The third component is an active learning method, which chooses the best next datapoint to be annotated. This loop is run until the whole dataset is annotated or the user is satisfied with the model. Even though IA is applied in spirit, formulating such annotating-while-training systems opens new research challenges. These are the same old challenges of active learning, model training, and interactive tooling, but augmented by the interactions between them and the time and data constraints involved. Evaluation criteria are mandatory, and ideally consider the potential applications of the system: (i) reducing the annotation time and (ii) fast model training by annotating. We propose an automated method to experimentally measure these two aspects. This evaluation method is based on the simulation of the annotator. In summary, our main contributions are\n(i) open-sourcing the IAdet tool, which allows for fast annotation and model training while annotating,\n(ii) conceptualizing the IA human-in-the-loop learning system and a possible evaluation methodology, and\n(iii) showing that the IAdet tool can be easily and greatly improved in multiple ways. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we describe the related work, discussing each of the many relevant research fields in the context of the related IA modules.\nIn the same section, we present the current industrial tooling.\nSection 3 presents the IAdet tool. Its software design and the challenges there involved are presented in further detail in the Supplementary Material. An evaluation method is needed to sort out the many questions about optimal implementation that arise. This method is exposed in Section 4.\nIn Section 5 we apply the evaluation method to our IAdet tool and present the results over the first 101010 classes of the PASCAL VOC dataset . Section 6 presents ablation studies that show that the IAdet tool can be easily and significantly improved.\nFinally, we conclude our work in Section 8 after a discussion of limitations and possible improvements in Section 7.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: In the last ten years, deep supervised learning has revolutionized many areas of science and has found widespread applications [ref]14.\nAlthough the deep learning community has used overparameterized functions for much more than vanilla supervised learning [ref]35, supervision is still of great importance for most\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
