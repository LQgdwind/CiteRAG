This issue is growing in significance, especially in the field of Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC), with the aim of improving performance by creating synergistic collaborations between human and robotic agents  .\nRole allocation methods have applications in different fields, such as environmental exploration and monitoring , rescue , surveillance, transportation , and robotic soccer   . Challenging role allocation problems are characterized mainly by the assortment of tasks111In this paper, the term task and role are used as synonyms, as prescribed by Gerkey and Matarić, since ”the underlying problem remains the same” . and large team sizes. MATA problems further require suitable mechanisms to capture the heterogeneity of the agents [ref]9.\nMATA problems further require suitable mechanisms to capture the heterogeneity of the agents [ref]9 and the advantages of collaborations between agents. Moreover, industrial tasks (e.g., machine tending, materials handling, assembly, etc.) are generally characterized by several schedule constraints in terms of time, space, and resources. While often task allocation and task planning are treated as separate problems, they are actually two essential aspects of the same domain.\nA suitable architecture that faces these problems should be able to model a wide variety of tasks while not requiring prior knowledge on the plan domain (task agnostic), break down a complex task into its atomic actions, and optimally assign them on the fly (dynamic allocation), to a single agent or to a group of agents (collaborative roles), according to multiple optimization criteria. This should be obtained while complying with online contingencies and plan variations caused by human presence and potential failures (variable sequence). For this reason, scalability for large tasks and teams, and re-planning capabilities are paramount. In light of this, in this work we propose a novel unified MATA architecture to execute complex tasks in a mixed human-robot team of arbitrary size. The architecture capitalizes on a centralized reactive and modular task-agnostic planning method based on Behavior Trees (BTs), in charge of scheduling the actions, and on a MILP-based role allocator that dynamically assigns individual and collaborative roles to the agents of the team.\nTo integrate human preferences into the allocation loop, a negotiation phase is introduced before action execution, in which each human worker can accept or refuse to execute the assigned task. Bilateral communication between humans and the system is achieved through an Augmented Reality (AR) custom user interface that provides intuitive functionalities to assist and coordinate workers in different action execution phases. The interface receives instructions and visual information on the assigned task and allows workers to give feedback to the system about their decisions.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: prescribed by Gerkey and Matarić, since ”the underlying problem remains the same” . and large team sizes.
