      "content": "Paper Title: Dynamic Preference Logic meets Iterated Belief Change: Representation Results and Postulates Characterization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis work has investigated representation results for well-known iterated belief change postulates using the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logics. We have provided a set of axioms that encode these postulates within DPL and shown that, as a result of the higher expressiveness of preference models in comparison to Grove’s SOS, a characterisation of these postulates in DPL cannot be obtained. Further, we have provided a generalisation of the postulates using preference models (Definitions 25, 29, 32, 35, 38, 42, 44, and 46) that coincide with the studied postulates in the class of models similar to Grove’s spheres (Facts 28, 27, 31, 34, 37, and 40), and shown that our encoding characterises these generalised postulates (Propositions 26, 30, 33, 36, 39, 43, 19, and 47). Finally, we have shown (Theorem 52) that we can obtain a sound axiomatisation for DPL interpreted over a class of dynamic models by aggregating the axioms for each postulate satisfied by all dynamic operators in that class. We use the proposed axioms to obtain an axiomatisation of Preference Logic extended with dynamic modalities for Lexicographic Revision (Corollary 53) and Lexicographic Contraction (Proposition  47). We wish to point out that, while our work is concerned with single-agent belief changes, our results can be trivially extended to private changes in the multi-agent case. Our results generalise previous semantic-based postulates by demonstrating are intrinsically linked to the structure of the model on which they are based, i.e., Grove’s system of spheres for classical propositional logic. To avoid terminological confusion, we point out that our results are concerned with belief change operations defined on well-founded preference models, which we simply call preference models in this work, and they may not be valid if one considers all preference models, since some belief change operators may not be well-defined on non-well-founded models  . A question that may arise from our work is whether the generalisation of Belief Change postulates from the semantic framework of Grove’s systems of spheres to preference models is relevant from an epistemological point of view.\nWe point out both that preference models have been extensively studied as models for non-monotonic reasoning and conditional logics    and to model different mental attitudes, such as Preferences  , Goals and Desires [ref]20, and Obligations , and different notions of Belief . It is of notice that preference models can be used to represent and reason about nested conditionals (or sets of conditionals), as those studied in conditional logics  , which can represent introspective beliefs and their dynamics. These conditionals cannot be expressed by means of Grove models, as these models are injective, in the sense used by Friedman and Halpern . The reader may also argue whether Modal Logic is an adequate framework to study belief change. We point out that, firstly, modal analysis of belief and other mental attitudes abound in the literature and have proven to be a fruitful and powerful framework to study attitudes such as beliefs   . Also, as De Rijke  points out, Dynamic Logic is a standard tool to reason about states and transitions between states, two fundamental notions for any notion of change or dynamics, and can be analysed through well-established tools from Modal Logic. As such, theories based on Dynamic Logic can be easily connected to well-established modal analysis of mental attitudes in the literature, providing a rich framework to study dynamic phenomena. While we have proved in this work that the axiomatisations provided are complete characterisations of the investigated postulates, by means of our proposed generalisations, we were not able to provide results about the completeness of the logic obtained by extending preference logic with a given dynamic operator characterised by a set of postulates. Inasmuch as the obtained axiomatisation is indeed complete for the example studied, i.e., Lexicographic Revision, it is still unclear if this will always be the case. Completeness results are not a trivial topic in Modal Logic and it is not clear that a general result guaranteeing completeness of the derived axiomatisation in regards to the extended logic can be obtained. As future work, we aim to investigate how these characterisations can be connected to syntactic representations of belief change operations. It is well known that dynamic operators can be encoded by means of transformations on priority graphs, a connection already studied by Liu , Souza et al.  and others. Souza et al. [ref]46 [ref]47 have shown that some postulates - as originally defined in Iterated Belief Change - cannot be encoded by means of transformations on priority graphs unless we restrict our semantics to only consider some specific classes of preference models. We aim to investigate if the same holds for our generalisations and, if so, for which kind of models such a syntactic characterisation of iterated belief change postulates can be achieved.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: that preference models have been extensively studied as models for non-monotonic reasoning and conditional logics    and to model different mental attitudes, such as Preferences  , Goals and Desires [ref]20, and Obligations , and different notions of Belief .
