      "content": "Paper Title: Improving DGA-Based Malicious Domain Classifiers for Malware Defense with Adversarial Machine Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDomain Generation Algorithms and detection of malicious domain names have been previously analyzed by different researchers for a number of years. Daniel et al. [ref]19 presented a taxonomy of DGA types by analyzing characteristics of 43 different DGA-based malware families and compared the properties of these families. They also implemented previous studies with 18 million DGA domain data that was created to identify malicious domains. They reported further progress in DGA detection. Detection of DGA botnets became feasible with the implementation of powerful machine learning models. Lison et al.  implemented a recurrent neural network model for the detection of DGAs. Their empirical study detected malicious domain names with high accuracy. Justin et al.  defined several models to detect malicious web sites, including a logistic regression, support vector machine, and bayesian model. They used the DMOZ dataset for benign websites while PhishTank and Spamscatter were used for malicious websites. Bin et al.  addressed the same issue using different machine learning classifiers for the detection of DGAs. They created a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN) machine learning model for the classification of malicious and benign domain names. They compared the results of both models in terms of their performance and reported that both models performed comparably. Duc et al.  dealt with the multiclass imbalance problem of LSTM algorithms for the detection of malicious domain names by generating DGAs. The authors claimed that the LSTM algorithms performed poorly with imbalanced datasets. To tackle this imbalanced dataset problem, they proposed a Long Short-Term Memory Multiclass Imbalance (LSTM.MI) algorithm and showed that their proposed algorithm provided more accurate results by implementing different case studies. In addition, Mayana et al.  introduced a WordGraph method to recognize dictionary based malicious domains. The authors asserted that more sophisticated DGAs are able to avoid detection of conventional machine learning classifiers. They carried out their experiments by extracting dictionary information without using reverse engineering. Bin et al. [ref]25 defined a deep neural network model as an inline DGA detector. They caution about most of the available datasets not being good representations for malicious domains or outdated. Hence, machine learning models’ perform poorly when trained using such datasets. Furthermore, they explained that reverse engineering was a difficult method for training models. To tackle these problems, the researchers offered a novel detector for malicious domains without the need for reverse engineering. Their proposed technique was based on real traffic and reported to detect malicious domains in real time. Woodbridge et al.  created a machine learning classifier based on the LSTM network to detect malicious domain names in real time. Their classifier detected multiclass domains by categorizing them into particular malware families. The model predicted a domain name as malicious or benign according to this domain name without any additional information. However, although these studies achieved high detection rates for particular DGA families, the performance of machine learning based detection systems are poor with new DGA variants when the models are trained with unrepresentative or imbalanced training datasets. To handle this issue, Anderson et al. [ref]15 offered a GAN algorithm to generate new domain names. In their GAN approach, they implemented two different deep neural network classifiers named discriminator and generator. According to this GAN methodology, new malicious domain names are generated by the generator, which evades the discriminator’s detection. Their case studies demonstrated that new malicious domain names also bypass a random forest classifier. Once the model was trained with adversarial samples, it hardened the model against new DGA families. However, the authors did not test it on DGA families created using a dictionary. Additionally, implementation of this approach is challenging due to the need of controlling two machine learning models, which might be unsuitable for detecting malware-related domain names. Unlike this approach, we propose to augment data by using an efficient data perturbation technique that generates hard-to-detect DGA families and identifies DGA types that are created either randomly or using a dictionary. To overcome limitations of machine learning models in aforementioned circumstances, Curtin et al.  proposed to combine a neural network model with domain registration supplementary information. This additional information, which is known as WHOIS data, helped the neural network model to efficiently identify the most difficult samples that were generated using English words. However, cybercriminals take advantage of bulk registration services by registering thousands of domain names in a short time, several months before the start of nefarious activities . In addition, unauthorized people can access this information and falsify it by impersonating as legitimate users. This makes the information questionable. Compared to this, our approach efficiently detects DGA families solely based on the domain names, without relying on any supplementary information. PROSPECD container used to store and transfer blacklisted malicious domain names, is presented in . Compared to the privacy-preserving data dissemination concept as proposed by Lilien and Bhargava , it has the following features: Detection of several types of data leakages that can be made by authorized entities to unauthorized ones; Enforcement of access control policies either on a central server or locally on a client’s side in a Microsoft Excel®111This paper is an independent publication and is neither affiliated with, nor authorized, sponsored, or approved by, Microsoft Corporation   Add-in or in a cross-platform application . Container implementation as a digitally signed watermarked Microsoft Excel®-compatible spreadsheet file with hidden and encrypted data and access control policies worksheets. On-the-fly key derivation mechanism for data worksheets.  The primary difference between PROSPECD and an Active Bundle 0, 1, 2 is that PROSPECD does not store an embedded policy enforcement engine (Virtual Machine). In contrast with a solution to encrypt the desired cells in a spreadsheet file, proposed by Tun and Mya in 3, in PROSPECD all the data worksheets are encrypted with the separate keys, generated on-the-fly. PROSPECD supports role-based and attribute-based access control. Furthermore, digital and visual watermarks are embedded in PROSPECD to enable detection of data leakages. A Secure Data Container, proposed in 4 to store device state information, only supports centralized policy enforcement. PROSPECD supports both centralized and local policy enforcement mechanisms .\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: Domain Generation Algorithms and detection of malicious domain names have been previously analyzed by different researchers for a number of years.
