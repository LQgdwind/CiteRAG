We have to be consistent throughout the whole paper!\nterminal point pairs in the plane, the task is to connect each pair by a path such that\nthe paths are pairwise noncrossing and their total length is minimized.\nOne can\nthink about this problem as an extension of our results\n\nto a large number of\ncolors. The best-known result is a randomized¬†ùí™‚Äã(n‚Äãlog‚Å°n)ùí™ùëõùëõ{\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n}\\log n)}-approximation algorithm\nby Chan et al.¬†.\nIt is based on the heuristic by Liebling et al.¬†\nto connect the terminal pairs along a single tour through all the points.\nAs a special case of the colored noncrossing Steiner forest problem,\nthe problem also admits a (deterministic)¬†(1+Œµ)‚Äãn/21ùúÄùëõ2(1+\\varepsilon)n/2-approximation scheme¬†[ref]7. The problem has been also studied in the presence of obstacle polygons whose boundaries contain all the terminal pairs.\nFor the case of a single obstacle,\nPapadopoulou¬† gave\na linear-time algorithm, whereas for the general case, Erickson and Nayyeri¬† obtained an algorithm exponential in the number of obstacles.\nA practical extension to thick paths has been considered by Polishchuk and Mitchell¬†. In this paper, we complement these algorithmic results and demonstrate that the\nproblem is NP-hard555Note that a technical report¬†[ref]6 claims\nNP-hardness, but it seems to be missing a subtle detail in\nthe analysis¬†.. Euclidean Multicolored Noncrossing Paths is NP-hard. Thus, similar as Bicolored Noncrossing Spanning Trees in plane graphs, Multicolored Noncrossing Paths is a nice example of a problem whose hardness\ncomes from the noncrossing constraint.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: tour through all the points.\nAs a special case of the colored noncrossing Steiner forest problem,\nthe problem also admits a (deterministic)¬†(1+Œµ)‚Äãn/21ùúÄùëõ2(1+\\varepsilon)n/2-approximation scheme¬†[ref]7.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
