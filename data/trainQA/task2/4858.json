      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Clustering With Consensus Representations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHardware setup: We trained all DC algorithms on a machine with a single NVIDIA RTX 2080TI GPU (11GB onboard memory), 96 GB RAM, and an Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6130 CPU. All other comparison methods were run on the same machine using only the CPU. Implementation: We implemented DECCS in PyTorch (https://pytorch.org/). Currently, the generation and approximation of base partitions is done sequentially, but could be further optimized using parallelization. One run of DECCS for MNIST took about one hour, which is in the same order of magnitude as other DC methods, e.g. DCN needed about 40 minutes. Parameters of cluster ensemble:\nFor the clustering algorithms in the ensemble ‚Ñ∞={\\mathcal{E}=\\{KM, SC, AGG, GMM}}\\}, we used the implementations of the sklearn  package. For the real-world data sets, we parameterized them using this setting: For the synthetic data sets, we set linkage=‚Äôsingle‚Äôlinkage‚Äôsingle‚Äô\\text{linkage}=\\text{'single'} for agglomerative clustering. Consensus Clustering: For the classical methods, we used the same parameterization as suggested by the authors in the original papers (, , , [ref]20). For the RP-based methods, we determined the subspace dimension with a grid search and report the value with the best average NMI over 10 runs. We evaluated the RP algorithms with an ensemble size of four (size of our ensemble) and 30 (ensemble size used in ) and again picked the run with the highest NMI. The parameters of the Expectation Maximization (EM) and FCM algorithms were set according to  and  respectively.  proposed two versions of their RP-based algorithm, we run our experiments with both versions and only report the run with the highest NMI.\nAligned with , we performed a grid search for q in  0 for both RP-based methods and picked the run with the highest NMI. For LWEA, we set the hyperparameter Œ∏ùúÉ\\theta to 0.4, as [ref]20 do for all their experiments. Except for LWEA, other classical methods are implemented using the cluster ensemble package.666https://github.com/827916600/ClusterEnsembles Deep Clustering:\nFor the UCI data sets, we determined the learning rate and other AE parameters, like dropout rate , using a grid search during the AE pretraining taking the parameters with lowest reconstruction loss. All other AE s were pretrained with a learning rate of 0.0010.0010.001. All AE s were trained using early stopping and the learning rate was reduced by 0.5 if the reconstruction loss reached a plateau. We use for DECCS, VaDE, DEC, IDEC, and DCN a batch size of |‚Ñ¨|=256‚Ñ¨256|\\mathcal{B}|=256. For VaDE, DEC, IDEC, and DCN, we use a constant learning rate of 0.00010.00010.0001 for the joint clustering. We train the DC algorithms for 100,000 mini-batch iterations for all data sets using the Adam optimizer  as was done in the original papers. For SpectralNet [ref]7, we used for the SYNTH and MICE data set the same parameters as suggested for small data sets. For the other data sets (PENDIGITS, HAR, and image data), we used the same parameters as [ref]7 used for MNIST. ConCURL [ref]13:\nFor ConCURL, we used the author‚Äôs repository. For all data sets, we performed ten runs each. In each run, we trained the algorithm for 300 epochs. To change the basic architecture as little as possible, we transformed gray images into three dimensions by copying the gray color channel. In our experiment, we used PyTorch‚Äôs resnet18 with a hidden MLP of 2048. We chose SGD as the optimizer with a learning rate of 0.015 and set the batch size to 128.\nThe alpha parameter was set to 0, and the beta and gamma parameters were set to 1. In the experiment, we set NCE-temp to 0.085 and NCE-k to 4096. For the hyperparameters, we followed the hyperparameters of CIFAR-10 available in their repository. For image augmentation, we used random rotations between -10 and 10 degrees, translations between 0 and 0.1, scaling between 0.6 and 1.2, and shearing between -10 and 10.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: for agglomerative clustering. Consensus Clustering: For the classical methods, we used the same parameterization as suggested by the authors in the original papers (, , , [ref]20).
