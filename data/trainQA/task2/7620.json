      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to Rematch Mismatched Pairs for Robust Cross-Modal Retrieval\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe pursuit of general intelligence has advanced the progress of multimodal learning, which aims to understand and integrate multiple sensory modalities like humans. Cross-modal retrieval is one of the most important techniques in multimodal learning due to its flexibility in bridging different modalities      , which has powered various real-world applications. Despite the remarkable performance of previous methods, much of their success can be attributed to the voracious appetite for well-matched cross-modal pairs. In practice, collecting such ideal data [ref]24 is notoriously labor-intensive and even impossible. Alternatively, several mainstream cross-modal datasets utilize the co-occurred information to crawl data from the Internet, especially for visual-text samples [ref]11. Although such a data collection way is free from expensive annotations, it will inevitably introduce partially mismatched pairs. For example, the standard image-caption dataset, Conceptual Captions [ref]38, is estimated to contain about 3% to 20% mismatched pairs. Such semantically irrelevant data will be wrongly treated as the matched pairs for training, which undoubtedly impairs the performance of cross-modal retrieval models. Thus, endowing cross-modal learning with robustness against PMPs is crucial to suit real-world retrieval scenarios. To alleviate the PMP problem, existing works    typically resort to recasting the estimated soft correspondence into a soft margin to adjust the distance in triplet ranking loss. However, the underuse of mismatched pairs, only limited to down-weighting their contribution, has led to sub-optimal retrieval performance. Hence, it is necessary to address the PMP issue in a data-efficient manner. A question naturally arises: Could cross-modal retrieval models even learn useful knowledge from mismatched pairs? To answer this question, this paper presents L2RM, a general framework that learns to rematch mismatched pairs for robust cross-modal retrieval. As illustrated in Fig. 1, our key idea is to excavate the potential matching relationship among mismatched cross-modal samples. Specifically, we first identify possibly mismatched pairs from training data by modeling the per-sample loss distribution. Then, we formalize the rematching idea as an OT problem to generate a new set of refined alignments for mismatched pairs in every minibatch. Notably, the cost function plays a paramount role when applying OT, which is typically designed as feature-driven distance   . However, the over-dependence on representations has led to a cycle of self-reinforcing errors—the existence of PMPs can generate corrupted representations–in turn, preventing the effective transport plan. To handle this problem, we propose a self-supervised learning solution to automatically learn the cost function from explicit similarity-cost mapping relation, which is unexplored in previous OT literature. Moreover, instead of exactly rematching all mismatched samples, we suggest modeling a partial OT problem while restricting the transport among false positives to boost the refined alignment. In practice, we show that our optimization objective could be solved by the Sinkhorn algorithm , which only incurs cheap computational overheads. Our main contributions are summarized as follows: (1) We propose a general OT-based framework to address the widely-existed PMP problem in cross-modal retrieval. The key to our method is learning to rematch mismatched pairs, which goes beyond previous efforts from the data-efficient view. (2) To address the error accumulation faced by the vanilla cost function, we propose a novel self-supervised learner that automatically learns the transport cost from explicit similarity-cost mapping relation. (3) To further boost the refined alignment, we present to\nmodel a partial OT problem and restrict the transport among false positives. (4) Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate our L2RM endows existing cross-modal retrieval methods with strong robustness against PMPs.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: Despite the remarkable performance of previous methods, much of their success can be attributed to the voracious appetite for well-matched cross-modal pairs.
