      "content": "Paper Title: White Box Methods for Explanations of Convolutional Neural Networks in Image Classification Tasks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning approaches which are a part of methods we call today Artificial Intelligence (AI), have become indispensable for a wide range of applications requiring analysis and understanding of a large amount of data. They can produce promising results that outperform human capabilities in various decision tasks relating to visual content classification and understanding such as face detection, object detection and segmentation, image denoising, video-based tasks like sports action recognition  and saliency detection[ref]5 amongst others. The success of deep learning-based systems in these tasks have also paved the way for their applications to be developed for a variety of medical diagnosis tasks like cancer detection , and Alzhiemer’s disease detection[ref]7 on different imaging modalities just to name a few. Along with the usefulness of these tools, the trustfulness and reliability of such systems is also being questioned. Though the results of deep learning models have been exemplary they are not perfect, can produce errors, are sensitive to noise in data and often lack the transparency to have verifiability of the decisions that they make. A specific example is related to the visual task of object classification from an image. The study by Ribeiro et al.[ref]8 showed that the trained network that performed supervised image classification, used the presence of snow as the distinguishing feature between the ”Wolf” and ”Husky” named classes present in the dataset. Such limitations raise ethical and reliability concerns that need to be addressed before such systems can be deployed and adopted on a wider scale. The objective of explainable AI/Deep learning is to design and develop methods that can be used to understand how these systems produce their decisions. The behaviour described in the case of the wolf/husky classification has been termed as the problem of a trained classifier behaving like a ”Clever Hans” predictor. Explanation methods aid in the unmasking of such spurious correlations and biases in the model or data and also in understanding of the failure cases of the system. If we can comprehend the reasoning behind the decision of a model, it could also help in uncovering associations that had been previously unobserved, which could aid in furthering the future research trends. It is important to mention that explainability focuses on the attribution of the output based on the input. It does not deal with answering the causality of the features or factors that have lead to a decision that has been taken. That is the explainers are only correlation-based (input-output) and do not make causal inferences. The current study focuses on the task of supervised image classification using specific deep neural network architectures ,i.e. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs have become one of the most successful architectures concerning AI tasks relating to images. Hence the methods presented in the subsequent sections are focused on finding the relation between the predicted output classes and the input features that are the pixels of the image. We specifically focus on white-box methods, which we found quite promising0. We also give our viewpoint on the topology of the different explanation methods which have been developed up to now. We present the detailed problem definition in Sec. 3. The following sections present the different explanation methods in detail. In Sec. 7 we discuss different ways of evaluation of explainers and present the comparison of several of them used for the explanation of a well-known VGG-16 CNN 1 for an image classification task.To facilitate reading of this survey we present the paper organization in Fig. 1.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: to visual content classification and understanding such as face detection, object detection and segmentation, image denoising, video-based tasks like sports action recognition  and saliency detection[ref]5 amongst others.
