      "content": "Paper Title: Open-Ended Evolution for Minecraft Building Generation This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 programme under grant agreement No 951911.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nComputational creativity refers to the study of computer systems which generate content or behave in a manner that an unbiased observer would consider creative, whilst being capable of challenging humans on both a creative and scientific level . Whilst early work in this field targeted PCG in isolated, single-faceted domains such as music  and stories , games have quickly become recognized as the cutting-edge application for the study of computational creativity . This is due to their content-intensive and multi-faceted nature which provide rich interactions with the player. Creative systems can also be used as mixed-initiative tools alongside humans  , helping them to understand and promote the creative process 9. A critical concept in computational creativity—and artificial life—is open-endedness (OE). Open-ended creativity can be informally defined as the ability of a biological or artificial system to keep producing novelty and complexity without exhaustion . This definition can be further broken down into three classes (exploratory, expansive, transformative) according to the extent to which the system must redefine its internal models, and its ability to alter the boundaries of the search space to explore new regions and/or dimensions . Modelling and evaluating OE is an active research topic in this field . Our approach to evaluating novelty in the latent space does not fit ideally with the three classes mentioned above. Whilst our generator could be said to produce expansive novelty in the latent space through transformation, the boundaries and dimensions of the search (phenotype) space remain static, meaning it can only achieve exploratory novelty in the problem space. Achieving higher forms of OE in the phenotype space could involve exploiting the phenotype resolution (expansive) and availability of materials (transformative) to open up new dimensions of the search space. Intrinsic motivation (IM) refers to an individual’s desire to explore new behaviors out of an internal curiosity in the outcome , acting freely without a separate motive or external influence . IM in artificial systems has been used in situations where the objective is difficult to define, in situations where transformative open-ended novelty is desired, and as a method for increasing creative autonomy [ref]5. These properties directly align with our goals for implementing a Minecraft building generator with open-ended complexity and creativity. Our proposed generator periodically redefines its novelty function according to interesting individuals it has generated in the past (without any external influence), satisfying the definition for IM given above. Through our evaluation we discuss the issues and benefits of largely ignoring the quality (extrinsic factors) of candidates and solely focusing on their novelty as a fitness. Within games, PCG is commonly tackled as a search-based task , treating the problem as an optimization task by evolving a population of artifacts according to a desired fitness function which could involve aspects of gameplay behavior or experience 4. PCG for quality-diversity  is a recent search-based approach which uses quality-diversity algorithms (e.g., MAP-Elites  with novelty search  or surprise search 7) to preserve diversity in the behavior space whilst improving their performance according to a desired fitness function. On the other hand PCG via Machine Learning 8 (PCGML) uses machine learned models which are trained on existing game content to generate new data, removing the need for complicated code to express the designer’s intentions for the target domain. The models created through PCGML algorithms can be used to recognize and repair infeasible components of individuals 9, predict properties of their content , and compress the content into fewer dimensions using an autoencoder . We cover uses of PCGML and other algorithms specifically for Minecraft in section II-C. Our approach combines the evolutionary principles of PCG-QD, by targeting novelty in the latent space and ensuring quality through constraints, while also leveraging learned representations not for generation directly—as in PCGML—but for the evaluation of novelty in a search-based paradigm.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: systems has been used in situations where the objective is difficult to define, in situations where transformative open-ended novelty is desired, and as a method for increasing creative autonomy [ref]5.
