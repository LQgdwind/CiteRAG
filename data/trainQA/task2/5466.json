Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

We split ‚Ñ∞‚Ñ∞\\mathcal{E} and ‚Ñã‚Ñã\\mathcal{H} into training, validation, and test sets with a ratio of 8:1:1. We use three standard evaluation metrics: the filtered MR (Mean Rank), MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank), and Hit@101010¬†. Higher MRR and Hit@101010 and a lower MR indicate better results. We repeat experiments ten times for each method and report the mean and the standard deviation. We set d=200ùëë200d=200 and d^=200^ùëë200\\hat{d}=200. We use 12 different baseline methods: ASER¬†, MINERVA¬†, Multi-Hop¬†[ref]24, Neural-LP¬†[ref]39, DRUM¬†[ref]31, AnyBURL¬†, PTransE¬†, RPJE¬†, TransD¬†, ANALOGY¬†, QuatE¬† and BiQUE¬†. For TransD and ANALOGY, we use the implementations in OpenKE¬†. More details of datasets and methods are described in Appendix.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: ten times for each method and report the mean and the standard deviation.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
