      "content": "Paper Title: Dynamic Defense Against Byzantine Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe standard machine learning approach is built upon an algorithm that learns from a centralized data source. Distributed machine learning proposes the distribution of the data and elements of a learning model among several nodes as a solution for the unceasing growing of learning model complexity and the size of training data [ref]1 [ref]2. However, the distributed machine learning solution is neither valid for the data privacy challenge, nor for an scenario with a large number of clients and a non homogeneous data distribution  . Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning approach in which the algorithms learn from sequestered data  . The FL model is mainly composed of two components: a global server that owns the global learning model and a set of clients storing the local learning models and the local training datasets. Likewise, FL consists in: \n\n(1) training the local learning models in each data source, \n(2) distilling the parameters of the local learning models into a central server, \n(3) aggregating the parameters of the local models in the global learning model and \n(4) updating the local learning models with the aggregated federated global learning model after the aggregation\n. This specific setting supports its main feature, which is the prevention of data leakage and the protection of data privacy, since the data do not abandon its local storage and they are not shared with any other client or third party. Since FL is a user privacy-preserving approach designed to decentralized scenarios, an Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) setting is a natural way to use it, for both the distributed nature and the privacy needed in IoT (Internet of Things) devices . Machine learning is vulnerable to malicious manipulations on the input data or the learning model to cause incorrect classification . This vulnerability becomes harder to address in FL due to most of the defensive approaches are based data inspection techniques. Among the different kind of adversarial attacks in the literature , in this paper we focus on byzantine poisoning attacks , which are based on the arbitrary manipulation of the training data (data poisoning attack  ) or the client model updates (model poisoning attacks ) with the aim of hindering the performance of the FL model. We argue in this paper that the FL model has to be able to dynamically avoid adversarial clients to preserve the learning model from byzantines poisoning attacks, which is usually performed on the server by the federated aggregation operator. In the literature there are a number of federated aggregation operators, but they do not prevent the federated model from this kind of attacks [ref]13  , or they do it following some assumptions about the nature of the adversarial clients  or prove to be insufficiently effective . We propose the Dynamic Defense Against Byzantine Attacks (DDaBA), which is a dynamic aggregation operator that dynamically selects the clients to be aggregated and discards those ones considered as adversarial, and it features agnostic about the number and nature of the adversarial clients. This dynamic defense is built upon an Induced Ordered Weighted Averaging (IOWA) operator , which aggregates the clients on a weighted basis according to an induced-ordered function and a linguistic quantifier. We use as induced-ordered function the performance of the local learning models on a validation set stored in the server. The linguistic quantifier addresses the weighting of the clients, which usually depends on the knowledge of the problem and predefined parameters. We design an agnostic linguistic quantifier on the nature of the problem, which is based on: \n\n(1) considering the distribution of data resulting from measuring the performance variation between local learning models on the validation set, \n(2) assuming that the resulting distribution follows an exponential distribution, and \n(3) using the properties of that distribution to set the parameters of the linguistic quantifier in order to discard the adversarial clients that correspond to outliers in the exponential distribution according to the Tukey criteria.\n We evaluate the DDaBA as a defense in a FL model for image classification. For that purpose, we leverage the benchmark image classification datasets Fed-EMNIST111https://www.nist.gov/node/1298471/emnist-dataset Digits , Fashion MNIST222https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist  and CIFAR-10,333https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html and we distribute the data over the clients following a non independent and identically distributed (non-IID) distribution. We compare the DDaBA with the classical federated aggregation operator FedAvg [ref]13 with no defense and the state-of-the-art defenses against three different byzantine attacks: label-flipping , out-of-distribution  and random weights  attacks. We show that the DDaBA is able to identify the adversarial and poor clients, filter them out and enhance the performance of the global learning model. We analyze the behavior of the DDaBA in an scenario with a extreme proportion of adversarial clients, and we see that the performance of the federated global model is hindered. Although this is a very unlikely scenario, we also introduce the static version of DDaBA, Static Defense Against Byzantine Attacks (SDaBA), which predefine the parameters of the linguistic quantifier of the IOWA operator for discarding the susceptible adversarial clients. The SDaBA, as well as the DDaBA, outperforms all the baselines in the three adversarial attacks developed for the evaluation. The rest of the work is organized as follows: the following section summarizes the background related to FL, adversarial attacks in FL and defenses against them. Section 3 is focused on the description of the dynamic FL model for identifying adversarial clients. We detail the experimental set-up in Section 4 and evaluate and analyze the results of the FL models in Section 5. Finally, conclusions are described in Section 6.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: learning proposes the distribution of the data and elements of a learning model among several nodes as a solution for the unceasing growing of learning model complexity and the size of training data [ref]1 [ref]2.
