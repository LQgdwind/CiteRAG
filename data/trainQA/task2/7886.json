      "content": "Paper Title: SplineGen: a generative model for B-spline approximation of unorganized points\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nParametrization methods. The objective here is to learn a neural network to directly map data points to their corresponding parameters. The method presented in¬† appears to be the first to do so. A standard FCNN with a fixed input size of 100 data points and three hidden layers, each with 1,000 nodes, was used to construct the mapping. Because the input size is fixed, up-sampling or down-sampling is needed to run the model if the given number of data points is not equal to 100. Moreover, the training and inference of the model are time-consuming. To overcome this limitation, Scholz and J√ºttler¬† replaced FCNN with ResNet, which has a fixed input size of 2‚Äãd+12ùëë12d+1 data points if the underlying curve is of degree dùëëd. Multiple models need to be trained, each for a degree. Each model can only parameterize 2‚Äãd+12ùëë12d+1 data points. If there are more than 2‚Äãd+12ùëë12d+1 data points, heuristical down/up-sampling is required. By contrast, the method in this paper can directly parameterize an arbitrary number of data points. Knot placement methods. In the same paper¬†, FCNN is also used to predict knot positions. The model has a fixed input size of 100 data points and three hidden layers, each with 500 nodes. It assumes that knots are a subset of parameters. Under this assumption, predicting knot positions is converted to an easier classification problem on parameters. A similar idea has also been used in¬†, where a support vector machine is used to carry out the classification instead of FCNN. It is, however, arguable to snap knots onto parameters since knots and parameters do not have a shared relationship in many cases. In addition, their method‚Äôs input size is kept fixed. 3D generative methods. The proposed method in this work makes use of generative models, so it is closely related to the emerging field of generative 3D modeling¬†[ref]50. Generative models have been successfully applied to a series of shape representations such as voxels¬†[ref]51, point clouds¬†[ref]52, neural implicit fields¬† , meshes¬†, and solids¬† . However, there has been limited use of generative models for B-spline modeling. Despite this, the way they designed the networks is very inspiring to this work. In particular, SplineGen has the same high-level network architecture (i.e., encoder-decoder) as most existing generative models, the low-level design of the encoder module and decoder module is different though. Existing learning-based parameterization and knot placement methods have proven that they can be a promising alternative to the traditional heuristic methods in B-spline approximation. And reduced approximation errors were demonstrated. Nevertheless, there is still room for improvement, especially in extending the applicability and increasing accuracy. Following what has been done in¬† , this work presents a generative parameterization and knot placement, with added features of unorganized data points, size-independent, point permutation invariant, knot-parameter alignment, and high robustness.\n\nReference markers found: [50]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]50: method‚Äôs input size is kept fixed. 3D generative methods.
