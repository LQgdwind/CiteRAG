      "content": "Paper Title: Sanity checks and improvements for patch visualisation in prototype-based image classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSuch methods are among the most commonly used building blocks for generating explanations and aim at identifying the most important (salient) features (pixels) of an image w.r.t. the output of a given neuron. Although they are usually used to explain the decision taken by the model (e.g. neurons from the last layer of a classifier), they can also be used to visualise the most salient part of the image w.r.t. any intermediate result of a DCNN. Gradient-based approaches [ref]39 compute the partial derivative δ​Sδ​xi𝛿𝑆𝛿subscript𝑥𝑖\\frac{\\delta S}{\\delta x_{i}} of the target neuron output S𝑆S w.r.t. to each input pixel xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i}, with improvements such as Integrated Gradients 3 or SmoothGrads 1 aiming at generating more stable explanations. In particular, Smoothgrads ”adds noise to remove noise” by averaging gradients over noisy copies x+ni𝑥subscript𝑛𝑖x+n_{i} (ni∼𝒩​(0,σ2)similar-tosubscript𝑛𝑖𝒩0superscript𝜎2n_{i}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^{2})) of x𝑥x. Note that in order to take into account the sign and strength of the input , it is also possible to perform an element-wise product between the gradient and the input (δ​Sδ​xi⊙xdirect-product𝛿𝑆𝛿subscript𝑥𝑖𝑥\\frac{\\delta S}{\\delta x_{i}}\\odot x). Layer-wise Relevance Propagation  (LRP) uses a set of rules in order to back-propagate the relevance of each individual neuron from the target back to the input, following a conservation property. This method has several variants depending on the applied rules . In the particular context of prototype-based models,  proposes a variant of LRP called Prototype Relevance Propagation (PRP), implementing a dedicated rule to propagate relevance across the layer in charge of computing similarity scores, followed by LRPCOMP . Interestingly,  and  have shown that, for DCNNs based on ReLU activation (as it is often the case for the networks used for feature extraction in self-explaining models), Integrated Gradients, LRP with ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-rule and Deep-LIFT  are all equivalent to δ​Sδ​xi⊙Xdirect-product𝛿𝑆𝛿subscript𝑥𝑖𝑋\\frac{\\delta S}{\\delta x_{i}}\\odot X. For these reasons, in this work, we choose to compare the original part visualisation generated by ProtoPNet and ProtoTree to visualisations generated using Smoothgrads ⊙direct-product\\odot input and PRP.\nNote that we also exclude Guided-Backpropagation 2 and its application to GRADCAM  due to the results of  which raise some concerns regarding the relevance of the explanations based on these methods. \nWe emphasize the fact that a saliency map is not an explanation by itself, but is rather used to build an explanation. In the context of self-explaining models based on prototypes, the saliency maps of both the prototype and the test image are cropped in order to retain only the most salient pixels in the corresponding images. The explanation finally consists in the parallel display of the selected regions in the two images.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: model (e.g. neurons from the last layer of a classifier), they can also be used to visualise the most salient part of the image w.r.t. any intermediate result of a DCNN.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
