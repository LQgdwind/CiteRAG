A number of graph representation learning methods have been proposed to handle the graph/node classification and node clustering tasks. For example,  proposed to learn low-dimensional mapping for nodes that maximally preserves the neighborhood information of nodes.  proposed to learn node representations for node classification via maximizing the mutual information between the patch representations and summarized graph representations. Similarly,  utilized the mutual information maximization strategy and GIN¬†[ref]19 to learn graph representations for graph-level classifications.   took inspiration from the self-supervised learning to augment the graph data to construct positive/negative pairs, thereby learn effective graph representations with contrastive learning strategy¬†. It should be pointed out that existing graph representation learning methods rarely investigate the graph-level clustering task, as it is far difficult than graph classification or node clustering. An intuitive strategy is to perform kùëòk-means¬† or spectral clustering¬† on the learned graph-level representations given by those methods. Nevertheless, the clustering performance is not desirable as can be observed in Section¬†4.4, because the representations learned by those methods are not guaranteed to be suitable or effective for graph-level clustering. Therefore, we present our DGLC method to investigate the way to learn clustering-oriented graph-level representations, of which the learning is guided by an explicit clustering objective.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: In recent years, GNN related models¬†[ref]20  have shown state-of-the-art performance in many graph-data related tasks such as nodes classification¬†[ref]18  and graph classification¬† [ref]19 .
