      "content": "Paper Title: Prompt Tuning based Adapter for Vision-Language Model Adaption\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing Vision-Language (VL) models that can perform joint reasoning over visual and textual information. Large-scale VL models, such as CLIP [ref]30 and ALIGN [ref]16, have shown impressive zero-shot transfer learning ability on downstream tasks  , including image classification   3 and open-vocabulary object detection    3. These models are pre-trained on web-scale images and text pairs [ref]30 and contain a lot of cross-domain knowledge. However, adapting these large-scale VL models to downstream tasks is still quite challenging due to the size and complexity of the models. Several methods have been proposed to adapt large pre-trained VL models. One of the most commonly used methods is fine-tuning, which involves updating the model’s parameters on the task-specific dataset. However, fine-tuning the entire network is computationally expensive and may lead to overfitting, especially when the target dataset is small. As an alternative, two methods have been proposed: prompt tuning    and parameter-efficient   tuning. Prompt tuning involves adding an extra set of words or learnable parameters that are fed into the text encoder, allowing the model to obtain task-specific outputs. In contrast, parameter-efficient tuning involves adding an extra network or parameters to learn the representation of the downstream tasks, which reduces the computational cost of model adaptation. Prompt learning is a technique used to fine-tune pre-trained language models for specific downstream tasks. It involves providing a prompt, which is a natural language statement or question that constrains the model to generate a specific output. Prompt learning has shown great promise in improving the zero-shot transfer learning ability of large-scale VL models. There are mainly three types of prompt tuning methods: text prompt tuning, visual prompt tuning, and unified prompt tuning. The representative work of text prompt tuning is CoOp . CoOp injects additional text as input into the text encoder to help guide the model toward the desired output. Visual prompt tuning works, like VPT  and visual prompting , by injecting additional parameters into multiple layers of the vision transformer to optimize the image features output. Unified prompt tuning  combines text and visual prompts for a better trade-off between the two. However, prompt-based methods are highly impacted by the dataset and need longer training time to achieve optimal results. Tip-Adapter  is a recent method proposed for adapting the CLIP model to new downstream tasks in a training-free manner. The approach appends a non-parametric cache model to the weight-frozen CLIP model, where the cache model stores few-shot visual features encoded by CLIP and their ground-truth labels under one-hot encodings. During inference, the cache model is used to retrieve the few-shot knowledge and incorporate it with CLIP’s pre-trained knowledge to achieve high performance on downstream tasks. Tip-Adapter has the advantage of not requiring fine-tuning or additional training for adapting CLIP to new tasks, which significantly reduces computational costs. However, it has the drawback of relying on manual prompts for the text encoder, which may not fully capture the knowledge of the CLIP text encoder. In this research, we present a novel approach that integrates prompt tuning and parameter-efficient networks to overcome the limitations of each individual method. Specifically, we propose to generalize the manual prompting of the Tip-Adapter with learnable prompts adapted from CoOp’s text prompt. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in few-shot image classification. Our methods have two variants called Prompt-Adapter and Prompt-Adapter-F. Prompt-Adapter is a variant that is only based on the prior knowledge of pre-trained text prompt and cache model, it does not need training and can outperform the previous. Furthermore, we extend Prompt-Adapter by utilizing a multi-task trained prompt to initialize the text prompt and achieve a further 1.55% improvement in classification accuracy. For another variant of our work Prompt-Adapter-F, we train the network with 20 epochs and obtain a 0.49% improvement in accuracy compared to previous methods, setting a new state-of-the-art on few-shot classification. Our results suggest that the integration of prompt tuning and parameter-efficient networks can enhance the efficiency and performance of VL model adaptation for image classification. In summary, we propose a novel approach that combines multi-task pre-trained prompt learning with parameter-efficient networks to achieve efficient few-shot image classification. Our contributions include 1) showing the effectiveness of the multi-task pre-trained prompt mechanism in improving single-task prompt recognition accuracy, 2) proposing a new network architecture that incorporates prompt learning and a parameter-efficient network, and 3) demonstrating the superiority of our approach through few-shot image classification experiments on 11 datasets. The results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy, especially in extreme situations where data are limited available. Our method highlights the potential of combining prompt learning and parameter-efficient networks for efficient vision-language model adaptation.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing Vision-Language (VL) models that can perform joint reasoning over visual and textual information.
