      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Playing Full MOBA Games with Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nArtificial Intelligence for games, a.k.a. Game AI, has been actively studied for decades.\nWe have witnessed the success of AI agents in many game types, including board games like Go¬†, Atari series¬†, first-person shooting (FPS) games like Capture the Flag¬†[ref]15, video games like Super Smash Bros¬†, card games like Poker¬†, etc.\nNowadays, sophisticated strategy video games attract attention as they capture the nature of the real world , e.g., in 2019, AlphaStar achieved the grandmaster level in playing the general real-time strategy (RTS) game - StarCraft 2 3. As a sub-genre of RTS games, Multi-player Online Battle Arena (MOBA) has also attracted much attention recently 8 6 .\nDue to its playing mechanics which involve multi-agent competition and cooperation, imperfect information, complex action control, and enormous state-action space, MOBA is considered as a preferable testbed for AI research 9 5.\nTypical MOBA games include Honor of Kings, Dota, and League of Legends.\nIn terms of complexity, a MOBA game, such as Honor of Kings, even with significant discretization,\ncould have a state and action space of magnitude 1020000superscript102000010^{20000}¬†6, while that of a conventional Game AI testbed, such as Go, is at most 10360superscript1036010^{360}¬†.\nMOBA games are further complicated by the real-time strategies of multiple heroes (each hero is uniquely designed to have diverse playing mechanics), particularly in the 5 versus 5 (5v5) mode where two teams (each with 5 heroes selected from the hero pool) compete against each other 111In this paper, MOBA refers to the standard MOBA 5v5 game, unless otherwise stated.. In spite of its suitability for AI research, mastering the playing of MOBA remains to be a grand challenge for current AI systems.\nState-of-the-art work for MOBA 5v5 game is OpenAI Five for playing Dota 2 .\nIt trains with self-play reinforcement learning (RL).\nHowever, OpenAI Five plays with one major limitation 222OpenAI Five has two limitations from the regular game: 1) the major one is the limit of hero pool, i.e., only a subset of 17 heroes supported; 2) some game rules were simplified, e.g., certain items were not allowed to buy.,\ni.e., only 17 heroes were supported, despite the fact that the hero-varying and team-varying playing mechanism is the soul of MOBA 8 9. As the most fundamental step towards playing full MOBA games,\nscaling up the hero pool is challenging for self-play reinforcement learning,\nbecause the number of agent combinations, i.e., lineups, grows polynomially with the hero pool size.\nThe agent combinations are 4,900,896 (C1710√óC105superscriptsubscriptùê∂1710superscriptsubscriptùê∂105C_{17}^{10}\\times C_{10}^{5}) for 17 heroes, while exploding to 213,610,453,056 (C4010√óC105superscriptsubscriptùê∂4010superscriptsubscriptùê∂105C_{40}^{10}\\times C_{10}^{5}) for 40 heroes.\nConsidering the fact that each MOBA hero is unique and has a learning curve even for experienced human players, existing methods by randomly presenting these disordered hero combinations to a learning system can lead to ‚Äúlearning collapse‚Äù [ref]1, which has been observed from both OpenAI Five  and our experiments.\nFor instance, OpenAI attempted to expand the hero pool up to 25 heroes, resulting in unacceptably slow training and degraded AI performance, even with thousands of GPUs (see Section ‚ÄúMore heroes‚Äù in 4 for more details).\nTherefore, we need MOBA AI learning methods that deal with scalability-related issues caused by expanding the hero pool. In this paper, we propose a learning paradigm for supporting full MOBA game-playing with deep reinforcement learning.\nUnder the actor-learner pattern , we first build a distributed RL infrastructure that generates training data in an off-policy manner.\nWe then develop a unified actor-critic 0 network architecture to capture the playing mechanics and actions of different heroes.\nTo deal with policy deviations caused by the diversity of game episodes, we apply off-policy adaption, following that of 8.\nTo manage the uncertain value of state-action in game, we introduce multi-head value estimation into MOBA by grouping reward items.\nInspired by the idea of curriculum learning [ref]1 for neural network,\nwe design a curriculum for the multi-agent training in MOBA, in which we ‚Äústart small‚Äù and gradually increase the difficulty of learning.\nParticularly, we start with fixed lineups to obtain teacher models, from which we distill policies 6, and finally we perform merged training.\nWe leverage student-driven policy distillation  to transfer the knowledge from easy tasks to difficult ones.\nLastly, an emerging problem with expanding the hero pool is drafting, a.k.a. hero selection, at the beginning of a MOBA game. The Minimax algorithm  for drafting used in existing work with a small-sized hero pool  is no longer computationally feasible. To handle this, we develop an efficient and effective drafting agent based on Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) . Note that there still lacks a large-scale performance test of Game AI in the literature, due to the expensive nature of evaluating AI agents in real games, particularly for sophisticated video games.\nFor example, AlphaStar Final 3 and OpenAI Five  were tested: 1) against professionals for 11 matches and 8 matches, respectively; 2) against the public for 90 matches and for 7,257 matches, respectively (all levels of players can participate without an entry condition).\nTo provide more statistically significant evaluations, we conduct a large-scale MOBA AI test.\nSpecifically, we test using Honor of Kings, a popular and typical MOBA game, which has been widely used as a testbed for recent AI advances¬†6 8 7.\nAI achieved a 95.2% win-rate over 42 matches against professionals, and a 97.7% win-rate against players of High King level 333In Honor of Kings, a player‚Äôs game level can be: No-rank, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Heavenly, King (a.k.a, Champion) and High King (the highest), in ascending order.\nover 642,047 matches. To sum up, our contributions are: We propose a novel MOBA AI learning paradigm towards playing full MOBA games with deep reinforcement learning. We conduct the first large-scale performance test of MOBA AI agents. Extensive experiments show that our AI can defeat top esports players.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: actively studied for decades.\nWe have witnessed the success of AI agents in many game types, including board games like Go¬†, Atari series¬†, first-person shooting (FPS) games like Capture the Flag¬†[ref]15, video games like Super Smash Bros¬†, card games like Poker¬†, etc.\nNowadays, sophisticated strategy video games attract attention as they capture the nature of the real world , e.g., in 2019,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
