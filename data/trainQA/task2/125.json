Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1.

IAN  represents the target and context interactively via two LSTMs and attention mechanism. TNet [ref]12 transforms BiLSTM embeddings into target-specific embeddings, and uses a CNN for encoding. MGAN [ref]56 exploits a BiLSTM to capture contextual information and a multi-grained attention mechanism to capture the relationship between aspect and context. AOA  introduces an Attention-over-Attention module to model the interaction between aspects and context sentences jointly. AEN  adopts attentional encoder network for feature representation and modeling semantic interactions between target and context. CapsNet  utilizes capsule networks  to model complicated relationships between target mentions and contexts. BERT-PT  uses a post-training approach on a pre-trained BERT model to improve the performance for review\nreading comprehension and targeted aspect sentiment classification. BERT-SPC  feeds “[CLS]” + sentence + “[SEP]” + target mention + “[SEP]” into a pre-trained BERT model, and then uses pooled embedding for classification. CapsNet-BERT  builds capsule networks on the top of BERT layers to predict sentiment polarities. The syntax-based baselines are: AdaRNN  learns the sentence representation toward target via RNN semantic composition over a dependency tree. PhraseRNN  extends AdaRNN by adding two phrase composition functions. The PhraseRNN takes a dependency tree as well as a constituent tree as input. SynAttn  incorporates syntactic distance into the attention mechanism to model the interaction between target mention and context. CDT 1 and ASGCN 3 integrate dependency trees with GCN for aspect representation learning. Compared with CDT, ASGCN additionally apply attention mechanism to obtain final representation. TD-GAT 2 and TD-GAT-BERT 2 apply GAT to capture the syntax structure and improves it with LSTM to model relation across layers. For fair comparison, we leave out baselines which rely on external resources such as auxiliary sentences  and other domain/language review corpus   .\n\nReference markers found: [54]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]54: We compare our model with the state-of-the-art systems without and with syntactic knowledge.\nThe syntax-free baselines include: SVM applys a support vector machine (SVM, [ref]54) model over extensive features for classification.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
