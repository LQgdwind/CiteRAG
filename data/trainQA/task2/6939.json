      "content": "Paper Title: Interactive Graph Convolutional Filtering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets.\nWe evaluate the proposed method on three real-world datasets, namely KuaiRec, Movielens(1M), and EachMovie. The statistical information of the datasets is summarized in Table 2.\nThese datasets have also been widely used in related studies [ref]20 [ref]1 . MovieLens and EachMovie are movie rating datasets that are widely used for performance comparison of recommendation algorithms.\nThe interaction records in these datasets consist of integer ratings ranging from 0 to 5.\nFollowing previous work [ref]20 [ref]1, we consider ratings greater than or equal to 4 as satisfied interactions.\nKuaiRec  is a short video dataset where the interaction records represent the duration of user video views.\nFollowing the suggestion of the authors , we consider video views with a duration greater than twice the length of the video as satisfied interactions. It is worth noting that KuaiRec is a fully-observed dataset, meaning that we have access to complete information about user-item interactions.\nThis allows us to address the challenge of offline evaluation effectively.\nFor any recommendations made by the model to users in this dataset, we can always query the actual feedback information.\nHowever, for the other two datasets (MovieLens and EachMovie), users are unlikely to interact with all items.\nTherefore, in offline scenarios, we cannot obtain real feedback information for the model’s recommendations if there is no corresponding interaction record in the dataset.\nTo handle this, we follow previous work [ref]20 [ref]1 and fill the missing interaction records with 0, indicating no interaction. Baselines.\nIn this part, we introduce the baseline methods for comparison. The compared methods are as follows. Random: In each interaction, randomly chooses an item from the entire item set to recommend to the target user. It is a baseline used to estimate the worst performance that should be obtained Pop: The system picks the most popular items to recommend to the target user. This is a commonly employed basic baseline. Despite lacking personalization, it performs surprisingly well in evaluations, as users tend to consume popular items. ICF[ref]1: Interactive collaborative filtering combines probabilistic matrix factorization[ref]18 with various exploration methods for recommender system, including LinUCB,\nand TS MF: We always greedy w.r.t. the estimated scores and update users’ latent factor after every interaction. It is regard as the myopic algorithm of ICF. NICF[ref]20: A deep reinforcement learning method used to address interactive collaborative filtering. We use the implementation provided by the authors111https://github.com/zoulixin93/NICF. iGCF: Our proposed method. Evaluation metrics.\nConsistent with previous work [ref]1, three evaluation metrics are used: Cumulative Precision@T. A straightforward measure is the number of positive interactions collected during the total T𝑇T interactions, For ratings datasets (MoveieLens, EachMovie), we define θt=1subscript𝜃𝑡1\\theta_{t}=1 if ru,it>=4subscript𝑟𝑢subscript𝑖𝑡4r_{u,i_{t}}>=4, and 0 otherwise.\nFor video datasets (KuaiRec), we set θt=rtsubscript𝜃𝑡subscript𝑟𝑡\\theta_{t}=r_{t}. Cumulative Recall@T. We can also check for the recall during T𝑇T timesteps of the interactions, Cumulative n​D​C​Gk𝑛𝐷𝐶subscript𝐺𝑘\\boldsymbol{nDCG_{k}}@T. For the case that multiple items are shown in one interaction, the ranking of the item listed is also important: it is more useful to have the highly relevant items appear earlier in the ranking list. We use the normalized discounted cumulative gain (n​D​C​Gk𝑛𝐷𝐶subscript𝐺𝑘nDCG_{k}) as the ranking measure where θt,jsubscript𝜃𝑡𝑗\\theta_{t,j} is the real feedback θtsubscript𝜃𝑡\\theta_{t} of the item shown at ranking position j𝑗j in round t𝑡t. 𝒵𝒵\\mathcal{Z} is the normalization factor making the score of the optimal ranking to 1 such that 0≤n​D​C​Gk≤10𝑛𝐷𝐶subscript𝐺𝑘10\\leq nDCG_{k}\\leq 1.\nSimilar to the cumulative precision and recall, here the cumulative n​D​C​Gk𝑛𝐷𝐶subscript𝐺𝑘nDCG_{k} should also take sum over T𝑇T and average on users, Parameter setting.\nFor all datasets, we use 50% of the interaction data as the training set. Test users are selected outside of the training set, according to the different goals of each experiment.\nFor all methods except Random and Pop, a grid search is used to find the optimal configurations.\nFor ICF, MF, and the proposed method, the latent dimensions d𝑑d are chosen from the set {32, 64, 128, 256}. The maximum number of alternation optimization rounds for ICF is set to 20.\nIn the proposed method, the depth K𝐾K of the graph neural network is fixed at 3, γ𝛾\\gamma is chosen from the set {0.01, 0.1, 1 }, and the learning rate is picked from the set {0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10}.\nWe consider vtsubscript𝑣𝑡v_{t} in equation (21) as a tunable hyper-parameter, selecting its value from the set {0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10}.\nAs for the NICF, we use the same configuration as described in their paper [ref]20, where the initial dimension is set to 50, two attention blocks are used, and the optimal experimental results are reported from a selection of 3000 epochs.\nWe report the result of each method with its optimal hyper-parameter settings.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: real-world datasets, namely KuaiRec, Movielens(1M), and EachMovie. The statistical information of the datasets is summarized in Table 2.\nThese datasets have also been widely used in related studies [ref]20 [ref]1 .

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
