Although the problem has received a great\ndeal of attention for decades, the best known lower bounds for\narithmetic circuits computing explicit multilinear n𝑛n-variate polynomials\nwith 00-111 coefficients remain barely super-linear bounds Ω​(n​log⁡n)Ω𝑛𝑛\\Omega(n\\log n) proved by Baur and Strassen  already in 1983. For Boolean\ncircuits, known lower bounds are even not super-linear.\nThe first lower bound 2​n2𝑛2n was proved by Schnorr 7 in 1974,\nand improved to 3​n3𝑛3n by Blum  in 1984;\nthe best known lower bound 4.5​n−o​(n)4.5𝑛𝑜𝑛4.5n-o(n) was proved by Lachish and Raz  in 2001, and improved to 5​n−o​(n)5𝑛𝑜𝑛5n-o(n) by Iwama and Morizumi .\nIn both circuit models (arithmetic and Boolean), super-polynomial lower bounds are known only for restricted circuits such as bounded-depth and monotone circuits. The books   8 and recent surveys\n 2 provide wide coverage of Boolean and arithmetic circuits. This lack of proofs of strong lower bounds for unrestricted arithmetic and\nBoolean circuits happens mainly because such circuits can use\ncancellations x−x=0𝑥𝑥0x-x=0 in the arithmetic, and can use cancellations\nx∧x¯=0𝑥¯𝑥0x\\land\\overline{x}=0 in the Boolean case. Understanding the role of\ncancellations in arithmetic and Boolean circuits remains the ultimate\ngoal of circuit complexity. Monotone arithmetic (+,×)(+,\\times) circuits cannot use cancellations x−x=0𝑥𝑥0x-x=0, while\nmonotone Boolean (∨,∧)(\\lor,\\land) circuits cannot use cancellations\nx∧x¯=0𝑥¯𝑥0x\\land\\overline{x}=0. Still, the task of proving lower bounds even for\nmonotone Boolean circuits turned out to be much more difficult\nthan that for monotone arithmetic circuits. Although super-polynomial lower bounds on the size\nof monotone arithmetic (+,×)(+,\\times) circuits\nwere known starting with the notable paper by\nSchnorr 8 of 1976, it took a decade until such lower\nbounds for monotone Boolean (∨,∧)(\\lor,\\land) circuits were proved by\nRazborov 4 5 in 1985; until\nthen, the best known lower bound on the size of monotone Boolean circuits was only\n4​n4𝑛4n proved by Tiekenheinrich 5 in 1984. This happens because Boolean circuits can use\nidempotence laws x∨x=x𝑥𝑥𝑥x\\lor x=x and x∧x=x𝑥𝑥𝑥x\\land x=x as well as the\nabsorption law x∨x​y=x𝑥𝑥𝑦𝑥x\\lor xy=x, while arithmetic circuits cannot use any\nof these laws. The current paper attempts to identify a possible\nsource for this discrepancy: the presence of multiplicative\nidempotence and absorption in Boolean circuits. It turned out that the absence of additive idempotence x∨x=x𝑥𝑥𝑥x\\lor x=x in arithmetic circuits (where x+x≠x𝑥𝑥𝑥x+x\\neq x) is not a crucial\nissue: most lower bounds (albeit not all, 9 being a nice exception) on the monotone\narithmetic (+,×)(+,\\times) circuit complexity,\nincluding    [ref]17 3 8 1 6 7\nwere proved by only using the structure of monomials and fully\nignoring actual values of their (nonzero) coefficients. But the absence of multiplicative idempotence x∧x=x𝑥𝑥𝑥x\\land x=x and\nabsorption x∨x​y=x𝑥𝑥𝑦𝑥x\\lor xy=x in the arithmetic world turned out to be\ncrucial even in the case of monotone circuits. The goal of this\narticle is to show that already a very restricted use of\nmultiplicative idempotence, in combination with\nabsorption, makes a big difference between Boolean and arithmetic\ncircuits. To fine grain the “degree” of multiplicative idempotence, and by\nanalogy with read-k𝑘k branching programs, we introduce (in\nSection 4) the so-called “read-k𝑘k” (∨,∧)(\\lor,\\land) circuits.\nOur goal is to show that already read-111 (∨,∧)(\\lor,\\land) circuits\ncapture the power of three different types of circuits: monotone\narithmetic (+,×)(+,\\times) circuits, Boolean multilinear DeMorgan\n(∨,∧,¬)(\\lor,\\land,\\neg) circuits, as well as tropical111\nThe adjective “tropical” was coined by French mathematicians in honor of Imre Simon who lived in Sao Paulo (south tropic). Tropical algebra and tropical geometry are now intensively studied topics in\nmathematics. (min,+)(\\min,+)\ncircuits. The latter model of (tropical) circuits is motivated by\ndynamic programming (DP). Namely, many classical DP algorithms for\nminimization problems are “pure” in that they only use (min,+)(\\min,+)\noperations in their recursion equations. Prominent examples of pure DP\nalgorithms are the Bellman–Ford–Moore shortest s𝑠s-t𝑡t path\nalgorithm, the Roy–Floyd–Warshall all-pairs shortest paths\nalgorithm, the Bellman–Held–Karp traveling salesman algorithm, the\nDreyfus–Levin–Wagner Steiner tree algorithm, and many others. On\nthe other hand, pure DP algorithms are just special\n(recursively constructed) tropical (min,+)(\\min,+) circuits.\nThus, any lower bound on the size of (min,+)(\\min,+) circuits is also a lower bound on the minimum number of operations that any pure DP algorithm solving a given minimization problem must perform, be the designer of an algorithm even omnipotent. First lower\nbounds on the size of tropical circuits were proved already decades\nago, including Kerr , Jerrum and Snir , as well as recently,\nincluding Grigoriev and Koshevoy , Grigoriev and Podolskii , Mahajan, Nimbhorkar\nand Tawari  ,\nJukna and Seiwert [ref]17 . In fact, as shown by Jerrum and Snir ,\nif an arithmetic polynomial P𝑃P is multilinear\nand homogeneous, then the (min,+)(\\min,+) circuit complexity of the corresponding minimization problem is at least the monotone arithmetic (+,×)(+,\\times) circuit complexity of the polynomial P𝑃P. Thus, many other lower bounds for tropical (min,+)(\\min,+) circuits follow from the aforementioned earlier lower bounds on the monotone arithmetic (+,×)(+,\\times) circuit complexity of the corresponding polynomials, including bounds shown many years ago by\nSchnorr 8, Shamir and Snir 1,\nValiant 7, Tiwari and Tompa 6 and other authors.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: circuits (where x+x≠x𝑥𝑥𝑥x+x\\neq x) is not a crucial\nissue: most lower bounds (albeit not all, 9 being a nice exception) on the monotone\narithmetic (+,×)(+,\\times) circuit complexity,\nincluding    [ref]17 3 8 1 6 7\nwere proved by only using the structure of monomials and fully\nignoring actual values of their (nonzero) coefficients.
