Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

In contrast to [ref]45, which uses a single HP configuration,\nwe run large-scale experiments with very wide HP sweeps which allows us to\nreach more robust conclusions.\nIn particular, we are able to achieve excellent sample complexity\non all the environments used in \n[ref]45 evaluated gradient penalty in the off-policy setup in the following environments:\nHalfCheetah, Hopper, Walker2d and Ant, as well as InvertedPendulum\nwhich we did not use due to its simplicity. without using any explicit\ndiscriminator regularizer (Fig. 6). Another empirical study of IL algorithms\nis , which investigates the problem of HP selection in IL\nunder the assumption that the reward function is not available for the HP selection. The methodology of our study is mostly based on [ref]43\nwhich analyzed the importance of different choices for\non-policy actor-critic methods.\nOur work is also similar to other large-scale studies\ndone in other fields of Deep Learning, e.g.\nmodel-based RL [ref]39,\nGANs , NLP , disentangled representations \nand convolution network architectures .\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: The most similar work to ours is probably [ref]45\nwhich compares the performance of different discriminator regularizers and\nconcludes that gradient penalty is necessary for achieving good performance with off-policy\nAIL algorithms.
