      "content": "Paper Title: Facial Action Units Detection Aided by Global-Local Expression Embedding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe widely used AU datasets only contain limited subjects due to the difficulty of AU annotation, which is the main cause of overfitting. To resolve it, some works recourse to the various kinds of auxiliary information to enhance the model generalization and facilitate AU detection.\nIntroducing extra information of facial landmarks is a common practice in AU detection.\nTo effectively extract the local features for AUs, JPML  utilize the landmarks to crop the facial patches instead of uniformly distributed grids. EAC-Net  also generate the spatial attention maps according to the facial landmarks and applies them to the different levels of networks.\nLP-Net  sents the detected facial landmarks into the P-Net to learn the person-specific shape information.\nJÂA-Net [ref]31 proposes a multi-task framework combining landmark detection and AU detection.\nBesides this, there exist some other kinds of auxiliary information.\nZhao et al.  utilize the unlabelled large-scale web images and propose a weakly-supervised spectral embedding for AU detection.\nCui et al.  construct an expression-AUs knowledge prior\nbased on the existing anatomic and psychological research and introduce the expression recognition model for AU detection.\nSEV-Net  introduces the pre-trained word embedding to learn spatial attention maps based on the textual descriptions of AU occurrences.\nThe aforementioned methods all directly or indirectly introduce additional data for producing extra regularization in AU detection. We propose to utilize the expression embedding as auxiliary information, which better improves the generalization capability of the AU detection.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: to the facial landmarks and applies them to the different levels of networks.\nLP-Net  sents the detected facial landmarks into the P-Net to learn the person-specific shape information.\nJÂA-Net [ref]31 proposes a multi-task framework combining landmark detection and AU detection.\nBesides this, there exist some other kinds of auxiliary information.\nZhao et al.  utilize the unlabelled\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
