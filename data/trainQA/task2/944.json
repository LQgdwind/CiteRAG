      "content": "Paper Title: TabEAno: Table to Knowledge Graph Entity Annotation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTable 3 depicts the results of entity annotation by Precision (P), Recall (R), and F1-score (F1) on the T2D, Limaye, and Wikipedia tables dataset. Results were reported by Ritze et al., these were evaluated on 50% of the T2D dataset, the remaining 50% data is the optimize set. The reported F1 of T2K on the optimized set is 0.86. Results are taken from Zhang et al.. The results were conducted on 20% of T2D and Limaye dataset, 80% of data is used as training data. Results are taken from Efthymiou et al.  on 100% T2D, Limaye, and Wikipedia tables dataset. The three first rows of the results are taken from Ritze et al. . These results were evaluated on 50% of the T2D dataset, the remaining 50% T2D data was used as an optimizing set to find the best parameters for T2K. The T2K results on 100% Limaye, and Wikipedia tables dataset were reported by Efthymiou et al.  (the 8th row). The results from the 4th row to the 7th row were reported by . These methods were tested on 20% of T2D, and Limaye dataset, while 80% of data were used as training data. Note that, besides the table as the input, Zhang et al. also assume the information about the core attribute and table header available as input data. Le&Titov  is an entity linking for documents based on deep learning. The F1-score of Wikipedia Search  achieves higher performance than FactBase Lookup, Hybrid I, and II. Despised the different environment settings, it is also verified our observation and Efthymiou et al.  that perform a lookup on the latest knowledge could get better performance than the previous one (T2D was matched to DBpedia 2014, and Limaye was matched to DBpedia 2015-10). Using Entity Disambiguation (ED) as a classifier also improves the performance of entity annotation. The result of Rerank+ED achieves the best performance as the report of Zhang et al.  also validates that performing training on annotated data might improve the performance of entity annotation. The results from the 8th row to the 16th row were reported by Efthymiou et al. . These methods were tested on 100% of T2D, Limaye, and Wikipedia tables datasets. DBpedia Refined use DBpedia lookup results, while FactBase Lookup aggregate many resources as Wikipedia, DBpedia, FreeBase, YAGO, and both methods have a re-find step to select the best entity candidates with the constraint of entity types, and entity attributes. The Embeddings approach is an global disambiguation inspired from DoSeR framework . The Blocking, LogMap , and PARIS [ref]28 are these ontology matching frameworks. The Hybrid approaches are the ensemble system that combines the annotation results of FactBase Lookup and Embeddings. Hybrid I select the result of FactBase first if there is no annotation, the system uses the results of Embeddings, while Hybrid II is reverted process as using the result from Embbedings first and then the result of FactBase after. Because of the difference in evaluation setting with Ritze et al.  (evaluated on 50% of T2D data), and Zhang et al.  (evaluated on 20% of T2D, and Limaye dataset), we only compare the results of TabEAno with the annotation results reported by Efthymious et al.  (evaluated on 100% of T2D, Limaye, and Wikipedia tables datasets) . Overall, TabEAno outperforms the-state-of-the-art (SOTA) Hybrid I and II. TabEAno results outperform Hybrid I with a difference of +0.06 F1 score in T2D, and Hybrid II with the same difference as +0.06 F1 score in Limaye dataset. In the Wikipedia tables dataset, the improvement is 0.01 in F1-score but TabEAno provides a higher number of annotations since it got +0.07 in Recall metrics. Although TabEAno does not need the training process, it can achieve the better results in T2D dataset than Rerank+ED.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: entity candidates with the constraint of entity types, and entity attributes.
