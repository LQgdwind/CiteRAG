      "content": "Paper Title: Pose Invariant Person Re-Identification using Robust Pose-transformation GAN\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExploring the human body pose to improve re-ID performance has been a recent development. Many previous works have analysed the dependence of human pose in person re-ID [ref]4 [ref]5 [ref]6  In earlier works, the Symmetry-Driven Accumulation of Local Features (SDALF) method was proposed by Farenzena et al.  where handcrafted complementary features are extracted depending on localization of perceptually relevant human parts. They achieve pose invariance by combining these features through a weighting scheme based on human body (vertical) axis of symmetry. Weinrich et al.  detect the upper body pose for tracking the human subject in egocentric image frames. The local texture features of the upper body are learned and a generative 3D shape model is used for re-identification purpose. In another direction of research, there have been attempts to apply metric learning, based on a transformation function for different camera pairs, that can be used to model the pose change of the human and then compute feature distances to boost person re-ID. Following this philosophy, Bak et al.  try to learn a metric pool, i.e. a pose change metric based on Mahalanobis distance by classifying human pose into 3 groups: front, back and side. All the aforementioned methods use typical handcrafted features to achieve pose variation. However, in recent times there have been increasing application of deep learning based feature extractors and pose detectors for re-ID. Zheng et al.  addresses the pose misalignment problem by ‘PoseBox’, a pose based body part extraction and reconstruction algorithm for the pedestrian images. The original image and the PoseBox output both are trained in a CNN to extract pose invariant features for re-ID. Cho et al.  proposes a multi-shot re-ID framework by learning the transformation matrix from one pose to another by utilizing external camera parameters to predict the next pose (target pose) of the pedestrian and then use the matching score for re-ID framework. Sarfraz et al. [ref]6 uses the detected pose keypoints with the pedestrian image as the combined input to the CNN for learning pose sensitive embedding. The authors use a view predictor, i.e. pose classification branch in conjuncture with the CNN branch for robust embedding generation. However, the improvement of the framework is largely contributed to the new re-ranking methodology. Zhao et al.  proposes the ‘SpindleNet’ architecture that uses a Region Proposal Network (RPN) utilizing the human body structure (pose), and then extract features from each body part using the ROI pooling. These part-based features are merged using a tree-like ‘competetive’ feature fusion network with the full-image feature. Following this idea, Jhonson et al. [ref]4 tackles the person detection error by a SpindleNet-like body part based deep feature learning methodology by using an ensemble of handcrafted features such as Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV), Scale Invariant Local Ternary Pattern (SILTP) with the deeply learned model to produce better results. The fusion of Deep learning based features with handcrafted features have also been observed in Lee et al.’s  work, where the authors use an ensemble of invariant features for re-ID, by combining holistic (deep) features and regional (handcrafted) features. However, the authors do not provide specific justification on how these features are pose invariant.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Exploring the human body pose to improve re-ID performance has been a recent development.
