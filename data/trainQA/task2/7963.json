      "content": "Paper Title: B’MOJO: Hybrid State Space Realizations of Foundation Models with Eidetic and Fading Memory\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe start with a general overview of models for sequence data,\nwhether of text tokens (Large Language Models), images (e.g., Vision Language Models), video, or other physical sensory data (World Models).\nAny predictive model inferred from a sequence is called a realization.444Diffusion Models, a special case, are treated as realizations during training but used as representations during inference since all but the final element of the denoised sequence are discarded. If one assumes that there exists one “true” model, coming from a known model class, then the problem of realization reduces to System Identification [ref]29, which is to estimate the true model parameters from data. If the model is linear and driven by Gaussian noise, the Cayley-Hamilton theorem  implies that the model’s “true” order can be inferred with a variety of model selection criteria, including greedy selection. Otherwise, the rank of the non-linear analog of the observability matrix, the Observability Codistribution, can grow in fits and starts, making greedy model selection undecidable . If not only the model class, but the model itself are known, then the problem further reduces to filtering or prediction, which for the linear-Gaussian case can be implemented as a closed-form iterative update [ref]23. When building a (generally non-unique) realization, all one is given is the data, which leaves complete freedom of choice of model class and order, or number of free parameters. A “sequence model” is a mathematical representation of sequential data capable of predicting the next datum in the sequence given previous ones. The Wiener Filter  was among the earliest to be deployed, superseded by the Kalman Filter [ref]23, the first State Space Model (SSM) with an explicit “state” updated recursively. The ensuing decades saw extensions to more general models leading to Stochastic Realization Theory . The general problem of stochastic realization is, given a (potentially infinite) sequence {…,ut−1,ut}≐u≤tapproaches-limit…subscript𝑢𝑡1subscript𝑢𝑡subscript𝑢absent𝑡\\{\\dots,u_{t-1},u_{t}\\}\\doteq u_{\\leq t} observed up to time t𝑡t, infer (i.e., “learn”) some parametric model, a function ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi with parameters θ𝜃\\theta, ϕθ​(u≤t)subscriptitalic-ϕ𝜃subscript𝑢absent𝑡\\phi_{\\theta}(u_{\\leq t}) such that the prediction u^t+1=ϕθ​(u≤t)subscript^𝑢𝑡1subscriptitalic-ϕ𝜃subscript𝑢absent𝑡\\hat{u}_{t+1}=\\phi_{\\theta}(u_{\\leq t}) yields a residual ϵt+1=ut+1−u^t+1subscriptitalic-ϵ𝑡1subscript𝑢𝑡1subscript^𝑢𝑡1\\epsilon_{t+1}=u_{t+1}-\\hat{u}_{t+1} (“innovation process”) that is as close as possible to independent and identically distributed samples (IID).\nIn a nutshell, an optimal predictor is one that makes the prediction error unpredictable. The state of a model is a statistic that makes the future independent of the past. In particular, such a statistic (function of past data) ξ​(u≤t)𝜉subscript𝑢absent𝑡\\xi(u_{\\leq t}) yields to the following conditional entropy equality H​(ut+1|ξ​(u≤t),u≤t)=H​(ut+1|ξ​(u≤t))𝐻conditionalsubscript𝑢𝑡1𝜉subscript𝑢absent𝑡subscript𝑢absent𝑡𝐻conditionalsubscript𝑢𝑡1𝜉subscript𝑢absent𝑡H(u_{t+1}|\\xi(u_{\\leq t}),u_{\\leq t})=H(u_{t+1}|\\xi(u_{\\leq t})) relative to the joint distribution of all past and present data [ref]29 . Trivially, the data itself fits the definition of state with ξ​(u≤t)=u≤t𝜉subscript𝑢absent𝑡subscript𝑢absent𝑡\\xi(u_{\\leq t})=u_{\\leq t}, but it grows unbounded over time.\nInstead, one seeks a bounded complexity state given which all past data can be ignored with no loss of information. To build such a state is the core goal of stochastic realization. Any finite sequence can be realized by a linear time-invariant (LTI) system driven by IID Gaussian noise . It would therefore appear that this model class is sufficient for any practical purpose, and we need models no more expressive than linear time-invariant ones driven by white zero-mean Gaussian noise:555Note that Stochastic Realization Theory does not assume that the data is Gaussian, zero-mean and white, it only requires the innovation process to be so. That is the condition that the prediction residual (innovation) be unpredictable, regardless of whatever distribution the data is drawn from. Given observations y0:tsubscript𝑦:0𝑡y_{0:t}, stochastic realization deals with the problem of inferring an equivalence class of model parameters A,B,C𝐴𝐵𝐶A,B,C  and a state xtsubscript𝑥𝑡x_{t} along with a covariance matrix Ptsubscript𝑃𝑡P_{t} of [ut,vt]subscript𝑢𝑡subscript𝑣𝑡[u_{t},v_{t}] that can be propagated deterministically to approximate trajectories produced by the underlying “exo-system” or data generation mechanism, y0:tsubscript𝑦:0𝑡y_{0:t} .\nHowever, arbitrarily long and complex time series would require a growing state and therefore making the model no longer time invariant. More expressive model classes, such as time-varying  and input-varying [ref]25 afford more efficient representation by considering At,Bt,Ctsubscript𝐴𝑡subscript𝐵𝑡subscript𝐶𝑡A_{t},B_{t},C_{t} known functions of time (Linear-Time Varying) or of their input (Linear-Input Varying, LIV). As we describe next, a special case of LIV model class where the dependency on the input is linear, resulting in a so-called bilinear realization, is gathering considerable attention lately (Mamba , Griffin  and Gated Linear Attention ). Input-dependent (bilinear) models gathered considerable attention half a century ago starting with Brockett , when [ref]25 showed that “every nonlinear system with controls entering linearly is locally almost bilinear”;  developed a complete realization theory for this class of systems including minimal realizations, and showed that they not only minimize the dimension of the state, but also minimize the number of operations necessary for the update.\nMost recently, special cases of bilinear realizations are being used as building blocks in stacked architectures like Mamba , Jamba  and Griffin ; they refer to input-dependency as “selectivity” and combine attention mechanisms and other techniques to scale up to 52B parameters. These models differ by their choices of A,B,C𝐴𝐵𝐶A,B,C, each with its own advantages and limitations which we overcome as described next.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: element of the denoised sequence are discarded. If one assumes that there exists one “true” model, coming from a known model class, then the problem of realization reduces to System Identification [ref]29, which is to estimate the true model parameters from data. If the model is linear and driven by Gaussian noise, the Cayley-Hamilton theorem  implies that the model’s “true” order can be\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
