      "content": "Paper Title: EVNet: An Explainable Deep Network for Dimension Reduction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDimension reduction (DR) techniques aim to find a low-dimensional representation of a high-dimensional dataset that retains as much as possible its original structure. When used for visualization, the output is usually set to two or three dimensions. The results are commonly visualized with scatterplots, where nearby points model similar objects and distant points model dissimilar ones. DR techniques have a wide range of applications. For example, some DR techniques are used to analyze gene expression patterns and find new cell types  as well as eye movement patterns . Some DR techniques are even used to analyze the network parameter distribution and diagnose the training state of neural networks . Explaining DR models and their output has become a critical scientific concern. Although DR techniques are excellent for studying high-dimensional data, they are like a black box, as they are challenging to diagnose and understand   their outcome. Furthermore, researchers are interested in how DR algorithms make decisions. It is because figuring out which features (features) impact the DR output is crucial to discover new scientific knowledge. For example, when biology researchers use DR to process mRNA data and find a unique cell type, they want to see which mRNAs are associated with it. As another example, medical researchers want to discover biomarkers highly correlated with disease progression in the DR of big data. The explanation of DR technology is not a new topic. Some classical linear DR methods have natural explainability, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 5. PCA measures the contribution of each feature to the DR output through eigenvalues. The users can refine the dataset or explore the role of certain features with the help of the relative importance provided by eigenvalues. However, to get good results on complex high-dimensional data, there is a tendency to use parametric-free DR methods (e.g., t-SNE (tSNE)  and UMAP ). Since those methods optimize only the output results and not the generalizable model parameters, resulting in a catastrophic decrease in explainability. We observe that the work on the explanation of DR methods is classified into two categories [ref]4 .\n(1) Color annotation.\nThese methods demonstrate the relationship between features and DR output by adding a particular background color or annotation [ref]28 .\nAlthough these methods aid in exploring the data, they cannot reveal the implicit patterns and essential features.\n(2) Proxy explanation.\nThese methods explain a DR approach by analyzing the parameters of the proxy model   .\nAlthough they are more scalable as they can work with DR, such methods are only a simple explanation of DR. Moreover, the proxy models cannot accurately fit DR output, causing the explanation results to be ambiguous. The above method can be seen as a post-hoc analysis of the DR method. With the development of neural network based explainability methods, a new scheme, named Neural network-based (NN-based) explanation, has the potential to enhance the explainability of DR methods.\nIf an NN-based neural network DR model is trained, then mining the information embedded in the model by explanation tools (e.g., saliency map  and counterfactual explanations 3) can effectively achieve the explanation of DR.\n Unfortunately, despite the potential of NN-based DR methods, few high-performance NN-based DR methods have been proposed. There are two reasons for this.\n(R1) Parametric models are challenging to train.\n Based on previous theoretical studies  and experiments comparisons in this paper, it is more difficult to fit a parametric model than a parametric-free model because the optimized objects are parameters carrying generalized knowledge. Moreover, the current methods, like PUMAP  and Ivis\n , do not design a suitable loss function and network structure for parametric models. \nAs a result, the performance of these parametric methods is lower than that of the original parameter-free methods.\n(R2) Explanation scheme is challenging to design.\nMost of the current explainable analyses rely on supervised signals to accomplish. Explainable analysis theories and schemes for DR methods have not been discovered yet. To address the issues mentioned above, we propose an Explainable Visualization Network (EVNet) for unsupervised, supervised, and semi-supervised DR tasks. Furthermore, based on EVNet, we propose an explanation scheme for explainable analysis based on the model parameter and DR output. For (R1), richer prior knowledge is introduced for training a high-performance DR model. Inspired by unsupervised contrastive learning (UCL ),\nwe design a new network architecture and a structure-preserving loss function surrounding data augmentation. The new design strengthens the assumption of local connectivity  - the localities of manifolds are semantically similar - leading to better DR performance.\nFor (R2), we polish the network structure and design three explanation schemes to provide an in-depth exploration of the parametric DR model. A gate layer is proposed to evaluate the importance of each feature and filter out unimportant features. In addition, an interaction mechanism between DR input and DR output is established to explore the critical features of the local areas of DR output.\nThe novel contributions in this paper are as follows: A novel deep-network-based model for DR embedding. The model introduces data augmentation as prior knowledge to train the parametric DR model. Explanation schemes for DR model. The explanation schemes of features are proposed based on the decoupled network parameters and the interaction mechanism between DR input and DR output. Excellent performance. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method not only has stronger explainability but also can produce better visualization results. The experiments on multiple image and biological datasets indicate that the proposed EVNet better preserves the intrinsic structure of the original manifold.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: and not the generalizable model parameters, resulting in a catastrophic decrease in explainability.
