In this section, we briefly review the mathematics of the wavelet\nand wavelet packet transform and show how they can be used to\nbuild multi-resolution locally invariant representations\nwith respect to compact Lie groups.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: convolutional layers),\na nonlinear mapping (often a rectifying function, e.g., ReLu),\nand a down-sampling step (e.g., max-pooling), which produces the\ninput for the next stage of the architecture\n [ref]24 .\nThis approach\nseems to reflect neuro-scientific findings   2,\nand is also\nreminiscent of the multi-resolution representations produced by\nthe extensively studied wavelet transform.\nThe\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
