      "content": "Paper Title: Maximally Extendable Sheaf Codes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe proposed a general framework of sheaf codes, inspired by the Dinur-Kauffman sheaf theoretic approach to property testing  and the Meshulam’s idea  to define Tanner codes on simplicial complexes as local systems of coefficients. This general framework complements the existing literature on the codes defined on various types of high-dimensional expanders [ref]1 [ref]2 [ref]5   , and provides a topological interpretation of such codes as sheaves on finite topological spaces, or more generally on Alexandrov topological spaces. Though sheaf codes can also be viewed as cellular sheaves of vector spaces    or, equivalently, local systems on posets [ref]2, considering them as sheaves on topological spaces allows us to study new properties such as maximal extendibility, which is in turn closely related with maximally recoverable codes  . Note also that the problem of extension to global sections, which we study here, also naturally appears in the context of network coding . We showed that in every class of sheaf codes defined on the same space X𝑋X and admitting a polynomial parametrization of the parity-check matrices for the local codes, there always exists a maximally extendable code over a sufficiently large finite field. In particular, this implies the existence of maximally extendable product codes with arbitrary number of component codes. This is important since such codes have good coboundary expansion properties , and, as it was suggested in [ref]5,\ntensor products of more than two codes with good coboundary expansion could potentially be used to construct multidimensional versions of the codes from [ref]2  , and thus get good qLTCs. In the recent result , it is shown that using a natural 444-dimensional generalization of the codes from [ref]1 [ref]2 one can get almost good qLTCs provided that the product of the four local codes has good two-way coboundary expansion.\nHowever, we believe that to get good qLTCs it is required to consider significantly different complexes than the ones used in [ref]1 [ref]2 .\nWe think that an interesting future research direction is to use the Ramanujan cubical complexes from 4 obtained as the quotient X=T1×⋯×TD/G𝑋subscript𝑇1⋯subscript𝑇𝐷𝐺X=T_{1}\\times\\dots\\times T_{D}/G of a product of D𝐷D infinite regular trees T1,…,TDsubscript𝑇1…subscript𝑇𝐷T_{1},\\dots,T_{D}, where G𝐺G is a group acting on this product. We conjecture that with an appropriate choice of local product codes363636Tensor product of the projective Reed-Solomon codes could be a good choice to get good LTCs using these complexes since the automorphism groups of such codes contain the local permutation groups of the complexes from 4. Unfortunately, a dual of a projective Reed-Solomon code is still a projective Reed-Solomon code, and such codes can not be used [ref]5 in the current constructions of good qLDPC codes. However, we believe that if one can find maximally expandable product codes, where component codes are also stable under such permutations than they can be used to construct good qLTCs., it is possible to define a sheaf code ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} on this complex X𝑋X and the obtained qLDPC code H2​(X;ℱ)superscript𝐻2𝑋ℱH^{2}(X;\\mathcal{F}) could potentially give a positive solution to the qLTC conjecture. In Section IV-B we consider sheaf codes defined on flag complexes.\nA potential use of such codes is a natural generalization of quantum color codes , which we call Tanner color codes, inspired by the idea of quantum Tanner codes from . If we have a Tanner sheaf code ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} on a 222-dimensional 333-partite simplicial complex X𝑋X, we can consider its dual sheaf code ℱTsuperscriptℱT\\mathcal{F}^{\\mathrm{T}} (see Section V), where ℱeT=ℱe⟂subscriptsuperscriptℱT𝑒superscriptsubscriptℱ𝑒perpendicular-to\\mathcal{F}^{\\mathrm{T}}_{e}=\\mathcal{F}_{e}^{\\perp}, for all e∈X​(1)𝑒𝑋1e\\in X(1), and define the quantum CSS code Q​(ℱ)=CX/CZ⟂𝑄ℱsubscript𝐶𝑋superscriptsubscript𝐶𝑍perpendicular-toQ(\\mathcal{F})=C_{X}/C_{Z}^{\\perp}, with the stabilizer groups CX⟂=∑v∈X​(0)ℱvsuperscriptsubscript𝐶𝑋perpendicular-tosubscript𝑣𝑋0subscriptℱ𝑣C_{X}^{\\perp}=\\sum_{v\\in X(0)}\\mathcal{F}_{v} and CZ⟂=∑v∈X​(0)ℱvTsuperscriptsubscript𝐶𝑍perpendicular-tosubscript𝑣𝑋0subscriptsuperscriptℱT𝑣C_{Z}^{\\perp}=\\sum_{v\\in X(0)}\\mathcal{F}^{\\mathrm{T}}_{v} generated respectively by the codewords from ℱvsubscriptℱ𝑣\\mathcal{F}_{v} and ℱvTsubscriptsuperscriptℱT𝑣\\mathcal{F}^{\\mathrm{T}}_{v}, v∈X​(0)𝑣𝑋0{v\\in X(0)}. Since for different vertices v,v′∈X​(0)𝑣superscript𝑣′𝑋0v,v^{\\prime}\\in X(0) we have that either Xv∩Xv′=∅subscript𝑋𝑣subscript𝑋superscript𝑣′X_{v}\\cap X_{v^{\\prime}}=\\varnothing or Xv∩Xv′=Xesubscript𝑋𝑣subscript𝑋superscript𝑣′subscript𝑋𝑒X_{v}\\cap X_{v^{\\prime}}=X_{e}, where e={v,v′}∈X​(1)𝑒𝑣superscript𝑣′𝑋1e=\\{v,v^{\\prime}\\}\\in X(1), then ⟨c,c′⟩=⟨c|Xe,c′|Xe⟩=0𝑐superscript𝑐′evaluated-at𝑐subscript𝑋𝑒evaluated-atsuperscript𝑐′subscript𝑋𝑒0{\\langle c,c^{\\prime}\\rangle}={\\langle c|_{X_{e}},c^{\\prime}|_{X_{e}}\\rangle}=0 for all c∈ℱv𝑐subscriptℱ𝑣c\\in\\mathcal{F}_{v} and c′∈ℱv′Tsuperscript𝑐′subscriptsuperscriptℱTsuperscript𝑣′c^{\\prime}\\in\\mathcal{F}^{\\mathrm{T}}_{v^{\\prime}} because ℱeT=ℱe⟂subscriptsuperscriptℱT𝑒superscriptsubscriptℱ𝑒perpendicular-to\\mathcal{F}^{\\mathrm{T}}_{e}=\\mathcal{F}_{e}^{\\perp}. Now, when v=v′𝑣superscript𝑣′v=v^{\\prime}, since X𝑋X is 333-partite, we have that the link X⩾vsubscript𝑋absent𝑣X_{\\geqslant v} is a 222-partite graph with parts E0,E1⊆X​(1)subscript𝐸0subscript𝐸1𝑋1E_{0},E_{1}\\subseteq X(1), and thus Xv=⊔e∈E0Xesubscript𝑋𝑣subscriptsquare-union𝑒subscript𝐸0subscript𝑋𝑒X_{v}=\\sqcup_{e\\in E_{0}}X_{e}. Hence, we still have ⟨c,c′⟩=∑e∈E0⟨c|Xe,c′|Xe⟩=0𝑐superscript𝑐′subscript𝑒subscript𝐸0evaluated-at𝑐subscript𝑋𝑒evaluated-atsuperscript𝑐′subscript𝑋𝑒0{\\langle c,c^{\\prime}\\rangle}=\\sum_{e\\in E_{0}}{\\langle c|_{X_{e}},c^{\\prime}|_{X_{e}}\\rangle}=0 in this case, and the definition of Q​(ℱ)𝑄ℱQ(\\mathcal{F}) is indeed correct. One can consider defining Tanner color codes Q​(ℱ)𝑄ℱQ(\\mathcal{F}) on simplicial complexes from , ,  since they have good expansion properties and their links are flag complexes. It is interesting whether we get good qLDPC codes if the local codes ℱσsubscriptℱ𝜎\\mathcal{F}_{\\sigma} are the codes discussed in Section IV-B. It is natural to expect that, as in the case of expander LP codes, we get linear distance only if the local codes ℱσsubscriptℱ𝜎\\mathcal{F}_{\\sigma}, σ∈X​(0)𝜎𝑋0\\sigma\\in X(0), are good two-way expanders. In the current paper, we focused on sheaves of classical codes. However, it is also possible to consider sheaves 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} of quantum CSS codes, where we assign to every open set U⊆X𝑈𝑋U\\subseteq X the CSS code 𝒬​(U)𝒬𝑈\\mathcal{Q}(U) instead of a classical linear code. It is interesting whether one can use this idea to analyze qLDPC codes.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Tanner codes on simplicial complexes as local systems of coefficients.
