      "content": "Paper Title: ProSecutor: Protecting Mobile AIGC Services on Two-Layer Blockchain via Reputation and Contract Theoretic Approaches\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe success of AIGC relies on large pre-trained models with billions of parameters .\nObviously, such a paradigm is unsuitable for numerous resource-constrained clients, hindering the further development of AIGC.\nTo this end, researchers have been reducing the AIGC model size and alleviating the hardware requirements.\nOn Feb. 2023, Qualcomm AI published the world’s first on-device version of Stable Diffusion, one of the most famous text-to-image AIGC models 9.\nBy quantizing the model parameters from FP32 to INT8, the shrinking model can be smoothly operated on common smartphones.\nLikewise, Chen et al. [ref]5 present a series of GPU-aware optimizations for Stable Diffusion, such as flash attention and Winograd Convolution, achieving the 12-second inference latency on Samsung S23 Ultra.\nSnapFusion  further reduces such latency to 2 seconds by step distillation.\nNowadays, various mobile AIGC applications have been launched and widely used in practice, such as dreamer111https://stablediffusionweb.com/app and Draw Things222https://drawthings.ai/.\nIn the foreseeable future, AIGC will further embrace mobile networks, enjoying the easy-accessible mobile communications, computation, caching, and personalization  . The QoE modeling of mobile AIGC is intractable due to the unique features of AIGC outputs as artworks.\nCompared with conventional scenarios like crowdsourcing and edge caching, the QoE of mobile AIGC is greatly affected by implicit subjective user preferences.\nTraditionally, such subjective QoE can be measured using under study  or analytics frameworks, e.g., absolute category rating .\nHowever, these methods are tedious and time-consuming, without the potential for real-time QoE evaluation.\nFrom another perspective, physiological methods aim at reflecting the perceived QoE of clients directly from their perceptual and cognitive processes, e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature .\nAlthough first-hand feelings can be acquired, clients should keep wearing specific monitors, which might be invasive and unsuitable for large-scale applications.\nRecently, another emerging technique called affective computing gained significant attention in this field.\nAffective computing can measure the human perceived QoE according to the affective behaviors driven by human emotions, e.g., facial expressions, speech tone, and body gestures 0 1.\nNevertheless, training the neural networks for personalized affective behavior analysis requires tremendous time and computation resources.\nFurthermore, the resulting model is modality-specific because the types of affective behaviors that clients play in different scenarios differ.\nApart from measuring implicit subjective QoE, another issue is fusing it with objective service qualities.\nDu et al.  adopt Weber–Fechner Law [ref]23, which can evaluate the change of client perceivable experience caused by changing service qualities.\nHowever, they apply the unified model for all clients while ignoring their heterogeneity in terms of personalized preference, strictness, etc. Insights: In this paper, we establish a reputation scheme to measure the subjective experience of clients.\nAs shown in TABLE 1, our approach outperforms existing works in two aspects.\nFirstly, the clients can adopt personal QoE models and express their perceivable experiences in a uniform form of opinions.\nNote that the opinions of individual clients may contain subjectivity and bias.\nHence, WSML theory is adopted to alleviate the influence of these factors and provide each MASP with a fair reputation.\nAs a result, the time-consuming user study, physical tests, and numeral network training can be circumvented.\nMoreover, the existing QoE measurements are modality-specific since the user study, tests, and training objectives vary in different modalities.\nIn contrast, the reputation approach can be applied to any modality.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: one of the most famous text-to-image AIGC models 9.\nBy quantizing the model parameters from FP32 to INT8, the shrinking model can be smoothly operated on common smartphones.\nLikewise, Chen et al.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
