      "content": "Paper Title: Reinforcement Learning Algorithms: An Overview and Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep Q-Learning, also referred to as Deep Q-Networks (DQN), is considered the main algorithm used in environments with unlimited states and discrete actions, and it inspires other algorithms used for a similar purpose. DQN usually combines convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers that produce Q-values corresponding to the number of actions. Figure 3  shows AlexNet CNN followed by two fully connected layers to produce Q-value. The current scene from the environment represents the environment’s current state; once it is passed to the network, it produces Q-value representing the best action to take. The agent acts and then captures the changes in the environment’s current state and the reward generated from the action. A significant drawback of the DQN algorithm is overestimating the action-value (Q-value), where the agent tends to choose a non-optimal action because it has the highest Q-value [ref]9. Double DQN uses two networks to solve this overestimation problem in DQN. The first network, called the Policy Network, optimizes the Q-value, and the second network, the Target Network, is a replica of the policy network, and it is used to produce the estimated Q-value [ref]10. The target network parameters are updated after a certain number of time steps by copying the policy network parameters rather than using the backpropagation. Another improvement on DQN is Dueling DQN illustrated in Figure 4 [ref]11. Dueling DQN tries to define a better way to evaluate the Q-value by explicitly decomposing the Q-value function into two functions: State-Value function 𝑽​(𝒔)𝑽𝒔\\bm{V(s)} measures how good is for the agent to be in state 𝒔𝒔\\bm{s}. Advantage-Value function 𝑨​(𝒔,𝒂)𝑨𝒔𝒂\\bm{A(s,a)} captures how good is an action compared to other actions at a given state. The two functions shown in Figure 4 [ref]11, are combined via a special aggregation layer to produce an estimate of the state-action value function [ref]11. The value of this function is equal to the summation of the two values produced by the two functions: The subtracted term 𝟏|𝓐|​∑𝒂′𝑨​(𝒔,𝒂)1𝓐subscriptsuperscript𝒂bold-′𝑨𝒔𝒂\\bm{\\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{A}|}\\sum_{a^{\\prime}}A(s,a)} represents the mean, where |𝓐|𝓐\\bm{|\\mathcal{A}|} represents the size of the vector 𝑨𝑨\\bm{A}. This term helps with identifiability, and it does not change the relative rank of the A (and hence Q) values. Additionally, it increases the stability of the optimization as the advantage function only needs to change as fast as the mean [ref]11. Double Dueling DQN (DD-DQN) is another DQN algorithm: it combines Dueling DQN with Double DQN to find the optimal Q-value as suggested originally by Wang et al. [ref]11 where the output from the Dueling DQN is passed to Double DQN. Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN)  is an extension of the DQN algorithm, replacing the first fully connected layer with a recurrent LSTM layer of the same size. Adding the LSTM layer requires changing the input size from a single state of the environment to multiple states (frames) as a single input, which helps to integrate information through time .\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: from the action.
