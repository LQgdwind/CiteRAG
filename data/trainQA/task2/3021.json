      "content": "Paper Title: Survey of Deep Learning Methods for Inverse Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLet us consider a forward model with given noise process ν¯¯𝜈\\underline{\\nu}, assumed to be white.\nThere are two fundamental classes of inverse problems to solve: Static Estimation Problems, in which the system state z¯¯𝑧\\underline{z} is static, without any evolution over time . We will consider the following static problems: Image Restoration,\npart of a class of inverse problems in which the state and measurement spaces coincide (same number of pixels). Typically the measurements are a corrupted version of the unknown state, and the problem is to recover an estimate of the true signal from its corrupted version knowing the (forward) distortion model. Robustness and outlier detection are the main requirements for this class of inverse problems. Image Reconstruction, to find a projection from some measurement space to a differently sized state, such as 3D shape reconstruction from 2D scenes. These problems need careful regularization to find feasible solutions. Dynamic Estimation Problems,\nin which z¯¯𝑧\\underline{z} is subject to dynamics and measurements over time , such as in object tracking. Our focus is on DNNs as data-driven models for solving inverse problems, so we wish to redefine inverse problems to the context of learning from examples in statistical learning theory .\nWe need two sets of variables: The relation between input and output is described by a probability distribution p​(m¯,z¯)∈M×Z𝑝¯𝑚¯𝑧𝑀𝑍p(\\underline{m},\\underline{z})\\in M\\times Z, where the distribution is known only through a finite set of samples, the training set assumed to have been drawn independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) from p𝑝p. The learning objective is to find a function G​(m¯)𝐺¯𝑚G(\\underline{m}) to be an appropriate approximation of output z¯¯𝑧\\underline{z} in the case of a given input m¯¯𝑚\\underline{m}. That is, such that G(⋅|S)G(\\cdot|S) was learned on the basis of S𝑆S. In order to measure the effectiveness of estimator function G𝐺G in inferring the desired relationship described by p𝑝p, the expected conditional error can be used: where D​(G​(m¯),z¯)𝐷𝐺¯𝑚¯𝑧D(G(\\underline{m}),\\underline{z}) is the cost or loss function, measuring the cost associated with approximating true value z¯¯𝑧\\underline{z} with an estimate G​(m¯)𝐺¯𝑚G(\\underline{m}). Choosing a squared loss (G​(m¯)−z¯)2superscript𝐺¯𝑚¯𝑧2(G(\\underline{m})-\\underline{z})^{2} and allows us to derive the classic optimal Bayesian least-squares estimator . In the case of learning from examples, (13) cannot be reconstructed exactly since only a finite set of examples S𝑆S is given; therefore a regularized least squares algorithm may be used as an alternative  , where the hypothesis space H𝐻H is fixed and the estimate GSλsuperscriptsubscript𝐺𝑆𝜆G_{S}^{\\lambda} is obtained as where R​(⋅)𝑅⋅R(\\cdot) is a penalty term and λ𝜆\\lambda a regularization parameter. We may choose λ𝜆\\lambda to minimize the discrepancy however in general it is much simpler, and sufficient, to select λ𝜆\\lambda via cross-validation. Given that H𝐻H is the hypothesis space of possible inverse functions, in this paper it is quite reasonable to understand H𝐻H to be the space of functions which can be learned by a deep neural network, on the basis of optimizing its weight matrix W𝑊W. Based on the optimization criterion (14), which is actually the variational framework in functional analytic regularization theory [ref]44, and which forms the basis for inverse-function DNN learning, we classify deep learning frameworks for solving inverse problems into three categories, based on optimization criteria and training schemes: Direct Mapping Data Consistency Optimizer Deep Regularizer Each of these is developed and defined, as follows.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: neural network, on the basis of optimizing its weight matrix W𝑊W.
