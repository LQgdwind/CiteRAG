      "content": "Paper Title: FedUV: Uniformity and Variance for Heterogeneous Federated Learning 1footnote 11footnote 1To be presented at CVPR 2024\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFederated Learning (FL) [ref]31 is a distributed learning framework that allows the training of deep neural networks with data in decentralized locations. FL is especially appealing because it achieves similar performance to centralized training in specific settings while also negating the cost of collecting data into a centralized location and allowing effective parallelization across devices . However, because devices participating in FL use locally collected data for training, it is realistic to expect that the collective data across all devices are not independent and identically distributed (non-IID). This severely degrades overall performance. Local devices optimize their copy of the model towards local optima. In non-IID settings, however, it is likely that local optima across devices are in disagreement with the true optimum of the IID setting. Thus, the direction of the gradient causes dissonance and degraded performance. This phenomena is referred to as client drift in the FL literature. To combat client drift, a number of work [ref]20  9 introduced the idea of using the global model as a basis for regularization. More recently, some work showed it may be effective to focus on certain layers which are more prone to bias. In particular,  found that the final layer, referred to as the classifier, is the most biased in non-IID settings. They introduce a method to calibrate the classifier to offset this bias. Other work  used augmentation techniques  to regularize the classifier, while another work [ref]34 randomly initialized and froze the weights of the classifier.\nSince random vectors in high dimension space are likely to be orthogonal, the output of the penultimate layer, referred to as the representations or activations of the encoder, are trained to fit these orthogonal classifiers, thus offsetting bias. However, we note previous work have approached the non-IID problem by regularizing local models to be less biased, rather than directly regularizing local models to emulate the IID setting. In addition, many work have not been tested in a feature-shift setting, often only using the Dirichlet distribution to simulate a label-shift setting.\nFurthermore, while providing important insight for FL, these work generally do not take into account efficiency and scalability. State-of-the-art methods such as FedProx [ref]20, SCAFFOLD 5, and FedDyn  require distances calculations of weights between all layers of multiple models at every batch.\nMOON 9 and FedAlign  require extra forward passes at every batch.\nComputation and memory constraints certainly become issues as the size of models and datasets grow. Motivation.\nIn most classification problems, it is standard to minimize a Cross-Entropy loss function  to fit a neural network‚Äôs probability distribution to the sampled probability distribution.\nWhen the sampled class distribution is imbalanced, such as in a non-IID environment, the classifier becomes biased towards some subspace regardless of the features extracted by the encoder.\nMotivated by the success of freezing the classifier as orthogonal vectors [ref]34, we use the singular value decomposition to gain insight into the training dynamics of the classifier.\nWe train a Resnet-18 0 on CIFAR-100 6 and take the singular value decomposition of the weight matrix (ùêñ=ùêî‚Äãùö∫‚Äãùêï‚ä§ùêñùêîùö∫superscriptùêïtop\\mathbf{W}=\\mathbf{U}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\mathbf{V^{\\top}}, ùö∫=d‚Äãi‚Äãa‚Äãg‚Äã(œÉùüè,‚Ä¶,œÉùêß)ùö∫ùëëùëñùëéùëîsubscriptùúé1‚Ä¶subscriptùúéùêß\\mathbf{\\Sigma}=diag(\\mathbf{\\sigma_{1},...,\\sigma_{n}})) as shown in Fig.¬†1.\nThe singular values of the classifier decrease in a non-IID setting, showing there is a difference in the training dynamic between IID and non-IID settings. In light of this, we propose an approach to the non-IID problem in which we directly promote the emulation of an IID setting. There is a nuanced difference from previous work which regularize to decrease bias. Previous work use the global model as a source of regularization under the intuition that the global model is less biased than any single local model. However, this may not be optimal in every setting as the aggregate of biased local model may still be biased. We instead focus on regularizing local models to emulate the IID setting without the use of the global model.\nNamely, we present FedUV, a method that promotes IID emulation by inducing representation hyperspherical Uniformity and classifier Varaiance during local training. FedUV penalizes classifier probability distributions that are biased towards a subset of classes, thus promoting probability distributions in non-IID settings to match IID settings. This promotes local classifiers to be unbiased in their predictions rather than becoming biased towards local labels. Furthermore, we penalize representations that are not thoroughly spread across the hypersphere. There are two reasons for this. First, this encourages the encoder to not become biased towards local features. Second, expanding the feature space allows the classifier to expand its variance in more directions. We show both regularizations are essential for improved performance. FedUV achieves state-of-the-art performance on various standard label-shift benchmark in addition to various feature-shift benchmarks while being extremely simple, efficient, and scalable. Our contributions are summarized as follows. First, we verify that singular values of the classifier decreases as a consequence of non-IID environments in FL (Fig.¬†1). Second, we present two regularization terms, representation hyperspherical uniformity and classifier variance, to prevent this degradation. These regularization terms are simple yet effective.\nThird, we show that FedUV achieves state-of-the-art performance not only on label shift non-IID settings but also on feature shift non-IID settings. Unlike previous work, FedUV does not use the global model as a source of regularization, which requires extra forward-pass, requires extra memory, or requires matrix comparison between weights of each layer, thus being more efficient.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: Federated Learning (FL) [ref]31 is a distributed learning framework that allows the training of deep neural networks with data in decentralized locations.
