      "content": "Paper Title: ICDAR 2021 Competition on Components Segmentation Task of Document PhotosSupported by University of Pernambuco, CAPES and CNPq.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn total there were 16 research groups from different countries that\nhave participated in the contest. The entrants submitted their\nsegmentation hypotheses computed on the corresponding test sets for\nsome or all of the three challenge tasks.\nThe main characteristics of the approaches used by each entrant in\neach challenge task are described below. 58 CV Group (58 Group, China) - Task 1:\nThe approach is based on “Efficient and Accurate Arbitrary-Shaped\nText Detection with Pixel Aggregation Network”\n(PANNet)  with improvements for edge\nsegmentation. For model training, the segmentation effect has been\nimproved by employing two different loss functions: the edge\nsegmentation loss and the focal loss . Ambilight Lab Group (NetEase Inc., China) -\nTask 1: Document boundary detection has been carried out\nby using the composed model\nHRnet+OCR+DCNv2   .\nTask 2: On the segmentation results in Task 1, a text\nangle classify model based on ResNet-50 1 and a\ntext segmentation model HRnet+OCR+DCNv2 were applied. Task\n3: On the segmentation results in Task 1, an approach based on\nYOLO-v5111https://zenodo.org/record/4679653#.YKkfQSUpBFQ for signature detection and HRnet+OCR+DCNv2 for signature\nsegmentation were applied. Arcanite Group (Arcanite Solutions LLC, Switzerland) -\nTasks 1, 2 & 3: U-Net  is employed\nas model architecture, where the encoder is based on\nResNet-18 1 and ImageNet ,\nwhile the decoder is composed basically by transpose convolutions\nfor up-sampling the\noutputs. Cross-entropy  and\nDice 9 was used as loss functions in the\ntraining process. Cinnamon AI Group (Hochiminh City Univ. of Tech.,\nVietnam) - Tasks 1, 2 & 3: Methods in these Tasks\nemploy U-Net  as model architecture with\nResnet-34 1 backbone. This model has been trained\nto resolve the assignment proposed in each Task, where corresponding\ndata augmentation has been applied for improving generalization and\nrobustness. CUDOS Group (Anonymous) - Tasks 1, 2 & 3: The\napproaches are based on encoder-decoder\nSegNet  architecture and “Feature\nPyramid Network” (FPN) 6 for object detection\nwith MobileNetV2  backbone of the\nnetwork. Data augmentation and\ncross-entropy  loss were employed in the\ntraining of the network. Dao Xianghu light of TianQuan Group (CCB Financial\nTechnology Co. Ltd, China) - The approaches performed on the\nthree tasks employ encoder-decoder model architectures. Task\n1: The approach uses two DL models (both based on ImageNet\npretrained weights): DeepLabV3  (with\nResNet-50 backbone) and Segfix  for\nrefinement. Task 2: The applied approach is based on a\nmodel named DeepLabV3+ [ref]6. Task 3: In\nthis case, the used approach is the\nUnet++ . In general, training of the models\nfor the three tasks were carried out with data augmentation, using\npretrained weights initialized on ImageNet, and SOTA (or\nFocalDice)  loss function. DeepVision Group (German Research Center for AI,\nGermany) - Tasks 1 & 2: The assignments in these Tasks\nwere formulated as an instance segmentation problem. Basically, the\napproach uses Mask R-CNN 0 for instance\nsegmentation, with backbone of Resnet-50 1\npretrained on ImageNet Dataset . dotLAB Group (Universidade Federal de Pernambuco,\nBrazil) - Tasks 1, 2 & 3: The applied approaches are\nbased on a network architecture called “Self-Calibrated U-Net”\n(SC-U-Net) 8 which uses self-calibrated\nconvolutions to learn better discriminative representations. NAVER Papago Group (NAVER Papago, South Korea) -\nTasks 1, 2 & 3: The approaches are based on\nUnet++  with encoder based on\nResNet 1. Training of models were conducted with\ndata augmentation, using cross-entropy \nand Dice 9 as loss functions. The models\nwere also finetuned using the Lovász loss\nfunction . NUCTech Robot Group (NUCTech Limited Co., China) -\nTasks 1 & 2 and 1 & 3 are resolved\nsimultaneously through two unified models named “Double\nSegmentation Network” (DSegNet). Feature extraction of DSegNet is\ncarried out by the ResNet-50 1 backbone. These\nnetworks have two output channels: one outputs the document boundary\nand text segmentation zones and the other outputs document boundary\nand signature segmentation. Data augmentation has also been used in\nthe training of the models with Dice 9 as\nloss function. Ocean Group (Lenovo Research and Xi’an Jiaotong\nUniversity, China) - Task 1: Ensemble framework\nconsisting of two segmentation models, Mask R-CNN 0\nwith PointRend module 3 and\nDeepLab  with decouple\nSegNet 4, whose outputs are merged to get the\nfinal result. The models were also trained with data\naugmentation. Task 3: A one-stage detection model is used\nto detect handwritten signature bounding box. Then a full\nconvolutional encoder-decoder segmentation network combined with a\nrefinement block was used to predict accurately the handwritten\nsignature location. PA Group (AI Research Institute, OneConnect, China) -\nTasks 1 & 3: The approaches are based on ResNet-34 followed\nby a “Global Convolution Network”\n(ResNet34+GCN) 1 0. Task 2:\nThe approach is based on ResNet-18 followed by a “Pyramid Scene\nParsing Network”\n(ResNet18+PSPNet) 1 0. Dice loss\nfunction 9 was used in the training of\nall task’s models. SPDB Lab Group (Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, China)\n- Task 1: The approach based on three deep networks to\npredict the mask and vote on the prediction results of each pixel:\n1) Mask R-CNN 0 which uses\nHRNet  as backbone, HR feature pyramid networks\n(HRFPN)  and\nPointRend 3; 2) Multi-scale\nDeepLabV3 ; and 3)\nU2Net 3. Task 2: The approach has three\ndifferent DL models participate in the final pixel-wise voting\nprediction: 1) Multi-scale\nOCRNet  ; 2)\nHRNet+OCRNet ; and 3)\nDeepLabV3+ [ref]6, which uses\nResNeSt101  as backbone. Task 3:\nThe approach employs object detector YOLO 4,\nwhose cropped image output is sent to several segmentation models to\nget the final pixel-wise voting prediction: 1)\nU2Net 3; 2) HRNet+OCRNet ; 3) ResNeSt+DeepLabV3 +[ref]6 ; and 4)\nSwin-Transformer 9. SunshineinWinter Group (Xidian University, China) -\nTasks 1 & 2: Addressed approaches use the so-called\nEfficientNet  as the backbone of the\nsegmentation method and the “Feature Pyramid Networks”\n(FPN) 6 for object detection. Balanced\ncross-entropy  was used as a loss\nfunction. Task 3: The approach is based on the classical\ntwo-stage detection model Mask R-CNN 0, while the\nsegmentation model is the same as the ones in Tasks 1 & 2. USTC-IMCCLab Group (University of Science and Technology\nof China, Hefei Zhongke Brain Intelligence Technology Co. Ltd., China)\n- Tasks 1 & 2: The approached methods are based on a\ncombination of a “Cascade R-CNN”  and\nDeepLabV3+ [ref]6 for pixel prediction of document\nboundary and text zones. Wuhan Tianyu Document Algorithm Group (Wuhan Tianyu\nInformation Industry Co. Ltd., China) - Task 1:\nDeepLabV3  model was used for document\nboundary detection. Task 2: A two-stage approach which\nuses a DeepLabV3  for roughly text field\ndetection and OCRNet 5 for locating accurately\ntext zones. Task 3: OCRNet 5 was\nemployed for handwritten signature location.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: uses two DL models (both based on ImageNet\npretrained weights): DeepLabV3  (with\nResNet-50 backbone) and Segfix  for\nrefinement. Task 2: The applied approach is based on a\nmodel named DeepLabV3+ [ref]6. Task 3: In\nthis case, the used approach is the\nUnet++ . In general, training of the models\nfor the three tasks were carried out with data augmentation, using\npretrained weights initialized on\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
