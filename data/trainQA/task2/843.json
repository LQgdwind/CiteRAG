      "content": "Paper Title: Towards the Quantification of Safety Risks in Deep Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, we witness significant progress has been made in AI, especially the deep neural networks that can achieve surprisingly high performance on various tasks, including image recognition [ref]1, natural language processing , and games . As a key component, deep neural networks have also been widely used in a range of safety-critical applications such as fully- or semi-autonomous vehicles , drug discovery  and automated medical diagnosis .\nThe applications of neural networks in safety-critical systems bring a new challenge. As recent research demonstrated [ref]7 [ref]8, despite of achieving\nhigh accuracy, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples, i.e., adding a small\nperturbation to a genuine image will result in an erroneous\noutput. Such phenomena essentially implies that, neural network’s\naccuracy and its robustness may not be positively correlated . As a result, it is extremely crucial that a neural network model can be practically evaluated on its safety and robustness   . Many research efforts have been directed towards developing approaches to evaluate neural network’s robustness by crafting adversarial examples      ,\nincluding notably FGSM [ref]7, JSMA , C&W , etc. These approaches can only falsify robustness claims, yet cannot verify,\nbecause no theoretical guarantee is provided on their results.\nOriginated from verification community recently, some research works have instead focused on robustness evaluation with rigorous\nguarantees 0 1, i.e., if no adversarial examples found, the proposed solution can guarantee that DNN’s output is invariant to adversarial perturbation.\nThese techniques rely on either a reduction to a constraint solving problem by encoding the network as a set of constraints 2,\nan exhaustive search of the neighbourhood of an image 3, or an over-approximation method 4, etc. However, these approaches can only work with small-scale neural networks in a white-box manner111Namely, the structure and the internal weights of DNNs need to be known, and have not been able to work with a practical\nstate-of-the-art neural networks such as\nvarious ImageNet models. Moreover, most of them are dedicated for a particular single safety risk such as local or point-wise robustness. Please refer to our recent survey for details 5. In this regard, this paper works towards a generic quantification framework that is able to\ni) work with different classes of safety risks; ii) provide guarantee\non its quantification results; and iii) applicable to large-scale neural networks with a broad range of layers and activation functions.\nTo achieve these goals, we introduce a generic property expression parameterised over the output of a DNN, define metrics over this expression, and\ndevelop a tool DeepQuant to evaluate the metrics on DNNs. By instantiating the property expression with various specific forms and consider different metrics, DeepQuant can evaluate different safety risks on neural networks including\nthe local and global robustness, as well as the decision uncertainty, a new type of safety risks that is firstly studied in this paper.\nSpecifically, the key technical contributions of this paper lie on the following aspects. First, we study safety risks by assuming that network’s decision needs to align with human perception. Under this assumption, we identify another class of safety risks other than the known ones – adversarial example [ref]7, reachability example 6 7, and invariant example 8 – and name it as uncertainty example.\nFig. 1 presents the intuition of these safety risks.\nDifferent from adversarial example on which the network is certain about its decision (although the decision is incorrect w.r.t. human perception), uncertainty example lies on the vicinity of the intersection point of all decision boundaries (marked by red dashed line circle in Fig. 1) and should be without any confusion with human perception. uncertainty are more difficult to evaluate than robustness because the intersection areas of all decision boundaries are very sparse in the input space.\nThe potential disastrous consequence of uncertainty example will be discussed in the paper. Second, to work with different safety risks in a\nframework, we introduce a generic safety property expression and show that it can be instantiated to express various risks.\nThe quantification of the risks is then defined as the maximum radius of safe norm balls, in which no risk is present. Then, we show that, a\nconservative estimation of the maximum radius can be done by computing a Lipschitz metric over the safety property. Third, we develop an algorithm, inspired by a derivative-free optimisation technique called Mesh Adaptive Direct Search, to compute the Lipschitz metric. The algorithm is able to work on large-scale neural networks and does not require to know the internal weights or structures of DNNs.\nMoreover, as indicated in Fig. 2, our algorithm is tensor-based, to take advantage of the significant capability of GPU parallelisation. Finally, we implement the approach into a tool DeepQuant222The software is provided via github: https://github.com/TrustAI/DeepQuant and validate it over an extensive set of networks, including large-scale ImageNet DNNs with millions of neurons and tens of layers. The experiments show competitive performance of DeepQuant in a number of benchmark networks with respect to state-of-the-art tools ReluPlex 2, SHERLOCK 6, and DeepGO 7: it is able to efficiently achieve tight bounds. Other than the performance, our method can work without restrictions on the safety properties and the structure of neural networks. This is in contrast with existing tools, for example ReluPlex and SHERLOCK can only work with small network with ReLU activation functions and DeepGO can only work with robustness and reachability.\nIn summary, the novelty of this paper lies on the following aspects: This paper introduce a generic property expression that provides a principal and unified tool to quantify various safety risks on deep neural networks. We theoretically prove that the proposed Lipschitzian robustness expression bounds the true robustness in terms of classification-invariant space. This paper, as the the first research work, identifies a new type of risk of neural networks by uncertainty examples, as well as provides an efficient method to locate such uncertainty spots. We implement the proposed solution as a software tool - DeepQuant that is applicable to large-scale deep neural networks including various ImageNet models.
