      "content": "Paper Title: X&Fuse: Fusing Visual Information in Text-to-Image Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDataset Requirements \nWe would like to create a dataset that emulates the scenario in which a user (1) has an image of a subject, (2) has an image caption that is related to the subject, and (3) expects the model to generate an image that aligns with both the subject and the caption.\nDo note that while the desired output image should contain the subject, or key-properties of the subject, it might exclude properties that are specific to the original image of the subject, such as the pose, lightning, position, etc.\nThus, when considering an example from MS-COCO, one cannot simply extract a crop of the subject from an original image and use the original caption. The SubGen Dataset \nTo create our dataset, we initially take 5​k5𝑘5k images from the MS-COCO validation set.\nFor each image, we use the segmentation model from [ref]4 to identify objects in the image.\nThen, to collect high-quality subjects, we extract the object that was identified with the highest confidence. To create captions for the collected subjects, we leverage the in-context learning  abilities of large language models  [ref]14 1.\nSpecifically, we take three random examples and create a demonstration333A demonstration is an example for the task that will be appended to the prompt used for in-context learning [ref]7. from each one with the following template:\nDetected: [Subject Type] | Caption: [Caption].\nBy concatenating those three demonstrations, and prompting the model with the relevant subject type, we derive our final prompt.\nThis allows us to create a prompt for caption generation that reveals the type of the object (e.g. dog), but conceals details that are specific to the image it was taken from (like position or pose). Then, for each label, we sample five times from the Jurassic-J1 [ref]14 language model a matching caption.\nWe then filter images with people, and subjects that are too small or too large, in order to keep subjects that can properly identified, which leaves us with about ten thousand images.\nWe call this dataset SubGen.\nDo note, that while   show results that are based on multiple images for each object, SubGen only has one image per subject, which might make it more challenging for some approaches.\nWe provide additional details and sampled examples in Figure 11. Metrics \nWe consider three automatic metrics: (1) FID between generated images and real images from MS-COCO444We use images that that were not used to collect prompts or crops to prevent copying bias., (2) CLIP-Score between the caption and generated image, and (3) CLIP-Score between the subject crop and generated image.\nAdditionally, we perform human evaluation and assess human preferences in terms of image quality, text-faithfulness, and faithfulness to the cropped subject image. Baselines \nThe baseline methods selected are the vanilla Stable Diffusion (SD) model, SD (Cont) (see Sec. 4.1), and the textual inversion method  applied with SD (TI).\nTo train TI, we use the implementation of Hugginface Diffusers repository555https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/textual_inversion and use their default hyperparameters.\nWe use the type of the subject (e.g. dog) as the initialization token, and in cases where the type spans more than one token we simply use the first one.\nHowever, because the textual inversion method is impractical to run at scale, as it requires more than fifteen minutes to learn a single subject, we only evaluate it using human evaluation on two hundred randomly sampled examples.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: image and use the original caption. The SubGen Dataset \nTo create our dataset, we initially take 5​k5𝑘5k images from the MS-COCO validation set.\nFor each image, we use the segmentation model from [ref]4 to identify objects in the image.\nThen, to collect high-quality subjects, we extract the object that was identified with the highest confidence. To create captions for the collected subjects,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
