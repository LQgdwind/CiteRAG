In particular, we introduce a method for cross-lingual sentiment analysis, which is a harder problem than the standard sentiment analysis problem since one needs to make predictions for various languages including even unseen ones. Cross-lingual sentiment analysis aims to leverage high-quality and abundant resources in English for classification to improve the classification performance of resource-scarce languages . Moreover, we employ data of three languages to obtain the best score in 7 of 9 metrics of Arabic, English and Spanish languages in the SemEval emotion classification . Plutchik [ref]5, in 1980, has created the wheel of emotions in his psychoevolutionary theory of emotion to illustrate his idea of emotion, which is shown in Fig. 1. He suggests eight bipolar primary emotions that appear on the opposite sides of the wheel: joy versus sadness, anger versus fear, disgust versus trust, surprise versus anticipation. The primary emotions are expressed at different intensities and the intermediate emotions occur as a mix of these primary emotions. Moreover, the emotions are non-exclusive in Plutchik’s model as their combinations derive other emotions, and there exist correlations between the emotions, e.g., joy and sadness are represented as the opposite emotions. Following the Plutchik’s theory [ref]5, we formulate the sentiment analysis as the multi-label classification task, in which more than one label can be assigned to a text simultaneously. Yet, the class imbalance is an inherent issue in multi-label classification . Although the class imbalance has been extensively studied for the binary classification setting, it remains a challenge in multi-label classification\n . Furthermore, the tail labels, i.e., the labels with a low number of instances, impact the performance significantly less compared to the common labels when the classes are equally weighted in the multi-label setting due to the rarity of relevant examples and result in suboptimal performance [ref]7. Thus, we introduce a dynamic weighting method to dynamically adjust the class weights during training to remedy the class imbalance. In this article, we introduce a multilingual sentiment analysis framework in multi-label setting on 100 different languages. Our method uses focal loss to enhance the importance of hard examples. We introduce a dynamic weighting method to cope with the label imbalance. We also derive a macro-f1 maximization method within linear time complexity. Our method achieves the best result for 7 out of 9 metrics for the SemEval competition for Arabic, English and Spanish languages . We also demonstrate the performance of our method on cross-lingual combinations of the datasets and assess the performance gains obtained by the components in our method.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: languages .
