      "content": "Paper Title: CLIP-S4: Language-Guided Self-Supervised Semantic Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSemantic segmentation aims to partition an input image into semantically meaningful regions and assign each region a semantic class label. Recent advances in semantic segmentation    heavily rely on pixel-wise human annotations, which have two limitations. First, acquiring pixel-wise annotations is extremely labor intensive and costly, which can take up to 1.5 hours to label one image . Second, human annotations are often limited to a set of predefined semantic classes, with which the learned models lack the ability to recognize unknown classes [ref]25. Various approaches have been proposed to tackle these limitations, among which we are inspired by two lines of recent research in particular. First, for unsupervised semantic segmentation (i.e., without human annotations), self-supervised pixel representation learning approaches   [ref]23 [ref]18  have shown promising results on popular unsupervised benchmarks. The main idea is to extend self-supervised contrastive learning   from images to pixels by attracting each pixel’s embedding to its positive pairs and repelling it from negative pairs. The prior of pairs can be contours  [ref]18, hierarchical groups [ref]23, salience maps , and pre-trained models .\nAlthough these approaches can group pixels into semantically meaningful clusters, human annotations are still needed to assign class labels to the clusters for semantic segmentation . Second, for unknown classes in semantic segmentation, large-scale vision-language models such as CLIP  have shown great potential. This line of research, called language-driven semantic segmentation, aims to segment images with arbitrary classes defined by texts during testing time [ref]25   . Among these methods, most still need training time annotations, such as pixel annotations  [ref]25 and captions . Only a few recent work, MaskCLIP & MaskCLIP+  attempts to address this without using additional supervision: MaskCLIP directly extracts pixel embeddings correlated with texts from CLIP, but these pixel embeddings are coarse and noisy (Fig. 1a). To address this issue, MaskCLIP+  trains a segmentation model on the pseudo-labels generated by MaskCLIP for a set of predefined classes. However, the pixel embeddings of MaskCLIP+ are distorted by the predefined classes (Fig. 1a), which limits its ability to recognize unknowns (Fig. 1b). Also, it needs unknown class information during training, which hinders its real-world applications. We propose a language-guided self-supervised semantic segmentation approach, CLIP-S4, which takes advantage of the strengths from both lines of research and addresses their limitations accordingly. The key idea is to learn consistent pixel embeddings with respect to visual and conceptual semantics using self-supervised learning and the guidance of a vision-language model, CLIP. Specifically, we first train pixel embeddings with pixel-segment contrastive learning from different augmented image views  [ref]23 [ref]18 such that images can be partitioned into visually meaningful regions. To further improve pixel embedding quality and enable language-driven semantic segmentation, we introduce vision-language model guided consistency to regularize our model (Fig. 1c). The consistency is enforced from two aspects: embedding consistency and semantic consistency. First, embedding consistency aims to align the pixel embeddings generated by our model with the joint feature space of texts and images of CLIP by minimizing the distance between the pixel embeddings generated by our model and CLIP. Second, semantic consistency forces our model to make the same prediction as CLIP over a set of carefully designed target\nclasses with both known and unknown prototypes. Note that unlike the previous methods [ref]25  that use a predefined set of known classes, CLIP-S4 also learns the representation of unknown classes from images during training. In the end, CLIP-S4 also enables a new task, namely class-free semantic segmentation, as shown in Tab. 1. This new task does not need any human annotations and even assumes NO class names are given during training. This is a more challenging task than the recent work  that requires class names of both known and unknown. Annot. Cls Name Annot. Cls Name Add. Info. In summary, the contributions of this paper are threefold: We propose a self-supervised semantic segmentation approach that combines pixel-segment contrastive learning with the guidance of pre-trained vision language models. Our method can generate high-quality pixel embeddings without any human annotations and be applied to a variety of semantic segmentation tasks. We open up new research potentials for language-driven semantic segmentation without any human annotations by introducing and addressing a new task of class-free semantic segmentation (Tab. 1). Unlike previous work that assumes all the class names are known during training, our method can discover unknown classes from unlabelled image data without even knowing unknown class names. Consistent and substantial gains are observed with our approach over the state-of-the-art unsupervised and language-driven semantic segmentation methods on four popular datasets. More importantly, our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on the segmentation of unknown classes.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: up to 1.5 hours to label one image .
