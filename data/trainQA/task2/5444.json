      "content": "Paper Title: Real-Time Evaluation in Online Continual Learning: A New Hope\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe briefly describe the current literature on offline and online continual learning. For a more comprehensive overview of the literature, we refer the reader to the detailed surveys by De Lange et al. and Mai et al.3. Offline Continual Learning. Traditional continual learning strategies, which aim to mitigate forgetting, can be organized into three families of methods. (i) Replay-based methods store input samples, or alternatively learn to generate representative samples, while the model learns from the data stream. Later, the method retrains the model on the replay samples while the model learns from new data 2    . (ii) Regularization methods avoid the cost of storing samples and simply modify the model loss objective to regularize the training. While some of these methods penalize changes to important model parameters   [ref]8, other methods regularize the training by distilling knowledge from a model trained on past stream samples 8  . (iii) Parameter isolation methods train specific parameters for each task while freezing the parameters that are related to other tasks   2. Despite the progress made by these methods, they assume an offline stream that allows many passes over each continual learning task. Concurrent work Prabhu et al. alleviates this problem by imposing computational budget constraints and finds that simple methods based on experience replay outperform most prior continual learning works. In contrast, we study the more pragmatic setup, where the stream reveals data in real time. Online Learning for Reduced Forgetting.\nOCL was defined with a protocol where training data is only seen once in a sequence of labeled tasks 2.\nTo reduce catastrophic forgetting, the field initially progressed towards better gradient-based constraints like GEM 2 and AGEM . RWalk[ref]8 quantified forgetting and provided a more efficient approach to limit changes in important model parameters. TinyER  rediscovered the effectiveness of experience replay, and HAL  enhanced it with learned anchors. However, this setup assumes the availability of an oracle during test time to determine which classifier head to use for inference  3. Additionally, the benchmarks in this setup often have large constraints on the replay buffer size  . Due to these limitations, the class-incremental scenario started to gain attention, which is a more realistic setting for OCL. In class-incremental online continual learning, benchmarks  7 relaxed the need for task descriptors at test time, and introduced significantly larger buffer sizes in comparison to . Multiple directions have emerged to tackle catastrophic forgetting in this setup. They can be classified into few groups. (i) Regularization-based approaches modify the classification objective to preserve previously learned representations or encourage more meaningful representations e.g. DER , ACE , and CoPE . (ii) Sampling-based techniques focus on the optimal selection and storing of the most representative replay memory during online training, e.g. GSS , OCS 2, CBRS , CLIB 6, and InfoRS 7. Alternatively, some sampling methods focus on better memory retrieval strategies that reduce forgetting, e.g. MIR , ASER 4, and GMED 4. (iii) In other approaches, GDumb 8 proposed a degenerate solution to the problem of online learning ignoring the stream data and learning only on the memory samples.\nWhile these efforts have significantly advanced the field of OCL, they are mostly evaluated on benchmarks that do not reflect real-deployment conditions. First, these benchmarks heavily rely on artificially constructed small datasets with sudden shifts in classes. Second, these benchmarks are incapable of measuring whether models can rapidly adapt to new data under a fast-changing distribution shift, which is one of the main problems in classical online learning literature 3. There have been efforts to address the second limitation by using new metrics that measure test accuracy more frequently during training  6. However, these metrics capture the adaptation to held-out test data rather than to the incoming future data. To remedy these limitations, there has been a new surge of benchmarks proposing datasets and evaluation protocols, which we discuss next. Online Learning for Rapid Adaptation.\nRecent OCL benchmarks, e.g. CLOC  and CLEAR 0, introduce data ordered by timestamps, forming a temporal stream of evolving visual concepts over a long span of time. They demonstrate that their data has a natural distribution shift over time, requiring rapid adaptation to newer data. Additionally, they mimic the traditional online learning setup by measuring the capacity for rapid adaptation with the evaluation being done on future data from the stream. Our work extends the efforts in this direction. We adopt the CLOC benchmark and propose a more realistic real-time evaluation that encourages efficient learning.\nIt is worth mentioning that  has explored certain aspects of real-time evaluation in continual learning. However, they focus on efficiency for embedded device deployment, rather than rapid adaptation. Moreover, while their work investigates the computational cost associated with each training method, they only report the cost as an evaluation metric. In contrast, we constrain the training procedure by each method’s computational cost.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: methods avoid the cost of storing samples and simply modify the model loss objective to regularize the training.
