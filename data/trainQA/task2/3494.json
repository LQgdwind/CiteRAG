      "content": "Paper Title: Combating Distribution Shift for Accurate Time Series Forecasting via Hypernetworks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTime-series forecasting is crucial for various data analytics domains, including air quality monitoring , renewable energy production , human activity recognition , electricity consumption planning , urban traffic analysis  etc. The past years have witnessed diverse time-series forecasting models ranging from the conventional statistical approaches e.g., auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)  to the more recent deep learning based models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) , transformers,  and their variants [ref]8  0 .\nAs deep learning based models make few assumptions on the temporal structures of time series, they are preferable in modeling complex, long-sequence time series. They have demonstrated a notable improvement in prediction accuracy than statistical models [ref]8. A unique challenge in time series forecasting is that they are often non-stationary, resulting in temporal shifts in their distributions.\nThis distribution shift phenomenon causes discrepancies between the distributions of the training and the testing data, which degrades the performance of forecasting models 1 2.\nSuch distribution shift also exists among the input sequences of the training data, which makes it challenging to train a model that generalizes well to unknown data 3 4.\nFigure 1 illustrates the distribution shift problem in time series forecasting.\nConsider three sliding windows 1, 2, and 3 to segment the time series for training.\nThe probability distributions of the time series p1subscript𝑝1p_{1}, p2subscript𝑝2p_{2}, p3subscript𝑝3p_{3} may vary across windows, and they are likely to differ from the distribution pfsubscript𝑝𝑓p_{f} in the unseen forecast window.\nThat is, p1≠p2≠p3≠pfsubscript𝑝1subscript𝑝2subscript𝑝3subscript𝑝𝑓p_{1}\\neq p_{2}\\neq p_{3}\\neq p_{f}, which makes accurate forecasting for window pfsubscript𝑝𝑓p_{f} challenging. Distribution shift is usually tackled by domain generalization 5 or domain adaptation 4 6.\nThe idea is to learn the common knowledge transferable between domains despite the differences in their distributions 5.\nHowever, it is non-trivial to apply these techniques to time series 7 2.\nThis is because the distributions in time series change constantly (e.g., p1subscript𝑝1p_{1}, p2subscript𝑝2p_{2}, p3subscript𝑝3p_{3} in Figure 1), and it is unknown how to best characterize the distributions upon which to learn the common knowledge 2.\nThe state-of-the-art, ADARNN 2 proposes to characterize the worst-case distribution shift in time series leveraging the principle of maximum entropy.\nNevertheless, this approach is sub-optimal because (i) the training data may not always contain the worst-case distribution shift; and (ii) it under-utilizes the diversity of the distribution shifts in the time series. In this paper, we propose a hypernetwork-based framework called Hyper Time-Series Forecasting (HTSF) to mitigate the distribution shift problem for accurate time series forecasting.\nThe idea is to jointly learn the common knowledge and the corresponding distributions with an end-to-end hypernetwork architecture.\nAs shown in Figure 1, a hypernetwork consists of hyper and main layers, where the hyper layers generate model parameters Wfsubscript𝑊𝑓W_{f} conditioned on the inputs 𝐱fsubscript𝐱𝑓\\mathbf{x}_{f} for the main layers to make predictions yfsubscript𝑦𝑓y_{f}.\nWe exploit the hyper layers to learn the best characterization of the distribution shifts and the main layers to learn the corresponding forecast model.\nOur strategy is advantageous in the following aspects.\n(i)\nThe end-to-end learning scheme eliminates the assumptions on the worst-case distribution shift in the training data and makes full use of the various distribution shifts in the training data.\n(ii)\nThe hypernetwork architecture is capable of modeling complex feature representations in both the distributions and the common transferable knowledge, and it applies to various deep learning based time series models. Our main contributions are summarized as follows: We propose HTSF, a hypernetwork-based framework for accurate time series forecasting.\nTo the best of our knowledge, it is the first study that addresses the distribution shift problem in time series via hypernetworks.\n HTSF offers a generic, extensible, and end-to-end solution to the distribution shift problem in time series that makes no assumptions on the training data and applies to diverse deep learning based time series models such as RNNs and transformers. We evaluate HTSF on 9 time series forecasting benchmarks.\nExperimental results show that HTSF achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in both short-term and long-term time series forecasting.\nIt also yields comparable performance on spatiotemporal data to the state-of-the-art graph neural network based solutions 8 9. In the rest of this paper, we review related work in Sec. II, present the problem statement in Sec. III and introduce our method in Sec. IV.\nWe report the performance in Sec. V and ablation studies in Sec. VI, and finally conclude in Sec. VII.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: approaches e.g., auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)  to the more recent deep learning based models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) , transformers,  and their variants [ref]8  0 .\nAs deep learning based models make few assumptions on the temporal structures of time series, they are preferable in modeling complex, long-sequence time series.
