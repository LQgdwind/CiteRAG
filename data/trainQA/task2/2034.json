Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

However, transferring learned skills between tasks while taking risk into account is a difficult problem. One way to implement risk-aware transfer is to learn a critic  or teacher  that can guide an agent toward safer behaviors on future tasks. The risk-aware transfer of a policy from a simulator to a real-world setting has also been studied in the area of robotics . Another approach for reusing policies is the probabilistic policy reuse of García and Fernández , but requires strong assumptions on the task space. Hierarchical RL (HRL) is another related approach that relies on hierarchical abstractions, enabling an agent to decompose tasks into a hierarchy of sub-tasks, and facilitating the transfer of temporally-extended skills from sub-tasks to the parent task. The CISR approach of Mankowitz et al.  is the first to investigate safety explicitly within HRL, followed up by work on safe options  . However, none of the existing work takes advantage of the compositional structure of task rewards to transfer skills while optimizing the variance-adjusted return, which is the problem we tackle in this paper (see Table 1).\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: The entropic and mean-variance objectives are popular ways of incorporating risk-awareness in RL [ref]7  [ref]19 [ref]26     .
