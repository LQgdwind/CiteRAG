      "content": "Paper Title: Fair Classification via Unconstrained Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs stated earlier, the objective is to produce an unbiased classifier according to either Definition 1 or 2. This encompasses many important fairness criteria in the literature, such as statistical parity and equalized odds. Before doing that, we show that the Bayes optimal decision rule that satisfies a wider setting of affine constraints, which contain both Definitions 1 or 2, is a group-wise thresholding rule with (possible) randomization at the thresholds. Let f⋆=arg⁡minf:𝒳→{0,1}⁡𝔼​[𝕀​{f​(x)≠y}]superscript𝑓⋆subscript:𝑓→𝒳01𝔼delimited-[]𝕀𝑓xyf^{\\star}=\\arg\\min_{f:\\mathcal{X}\\to\\{0,1\\}}\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{I}\\{f(\\textbf{x})\\neq\\textbf{y}\\}] be the Bayes optimal decision rule subject to group-wise affine constraints of the form 𝔼​[wk​(x)⋅f​(x)|x∈Xk]=bk𝔼delimited-[]conditional⋅subscript𝑤𝑘x𝑓xxsubscript𝑋𝑘subscript𝑏𝑘\\mathbb{E}[w_{k}(\\textbf{x})\\cdot f(\\textbf{x})\\,|\\,\\textbf{x}\\in X_{k}]=b_{k} for some fixed partition 𝒳=∪kXk𝒳subscript𝑘subscript𝑋𝑘\\mathcal{X}=\\cup_{k}X_{k}. If wk:𝒳→ℝ:subscript𝑤𝑘→𝒳ℝw_{k}:\\mathcal{X}\\to\\mathbb{R} and bk∈ℝsubscript𝑏𝑘ℝb_{k}\\in\\mathbb{R} are such that there exists a constant c∈(0,1)𝑐01c\\in(0,1) in which p​(f​(x)=1)=c𝑝𝑓𝑥1𝑐p(f(x)=1)=c will satisfy all the affine constraints, then f⋆superscript𝑓⋆f^{\\star} satisfies p​(f⋆​(x)=1)=𝕀​{η​(x)>tk}+τk​𝕀​{η​(x)=tk}𝑝superscript𝑓⋆𝑥1𝕀𝜂𝑥subscript𝑡𝑘subscript𝜏𝑘𝕀𝜂𝑥subscript𝑡𝑘p(f^{\\star}(x)=1)=\\mathbb{I}\\{\\eta(x)>t_{k}\\}+\\tau_{k}\\,\\mathbb{I}\\{\\eta(x)=t_{k}\\}, where η​(x)=p​(y=1|x=x)𝜂𝑥𝑝yconditional1x𝑥\\eta(x)=p(\\textbf{y}=1|\\textbf{x}=x) is the Bayes regressor, tk∈ subscript𝑡𝑘01t_{k}\\in  is a threshold specific to the group Xk⊆𝒳subscript𝑋𝑘𝒳X_{k}\\subseteq\\mathcal{X}, and τk∈ subscript𝜏𝑘01\\tau_{k}\\in . Theorem 1 is stronger than Theorem 3.2 in 3 because it holds for arbitrary group-wise affine constraints and does not assume that η​(x)𝜂𝑥\\eta(x) has a positive density in the unit interval. In addition, the condition on c𝑐c is satisfied for both Definitions 1 and 2. The theorem shows that randomization at the thresholds is, sometimes, necessary for achieving Bayes optimality. This is illustrated next. Suppose that 𝒳={−1,0,1}𝒳101\\mathcal{X}=\\{-1,0,1\\} where p​(x=−1)=1/2𝑝x112p(\\textbf{x}=-1)=1/2, p​(x=0)=1/3𝑝x013p(\\textbf{x}=0)=1/3 and p​(x=1)=1/6𝑝x116p(\\textbf{x}=1)=1/6. Let η​(−1)=0,η​(0)=1/2formulae-sequence𝜂10𝜂012\\eta(-1)=0,\\,\\eta(0)=1/2 and η​(1)=1𝜂11\\eta(1)=1. In addition, let s be a sensitive attribute, where p​(s=1|x=−1)=1/2𝑝sconditional1x112p(\\textbf{s}=1|\\textbf{x}=-1)=1/2, p​(s=1|x=0)=1𝑝sconditional1x01p(\\textbf{s}=1|\\textbf{x}=0)=1, and p​(s=1|x=1)=0𝑝sconditional1x10p(\\textbf{s}=1|\\textbf{x}=1)=0. Then, the Bayes optimal prediction rule f⋆superscript𝑓⋆f^{\\star} subject to statistical parity w.r.t. s satisfies: p​(f⋆=1|x=−1)=0𝑝superscript𝑓⋆conditional1x10p(f^{\\star}=1|\\textbf{x}=-1)=0, p​(f⋆=1|x=0)=1/2𝑝superscript𝑓⋆conditional1x012p(f^{\\star}=1|\\textbf{x}=0)=1/2 and p​(f⋆=1|x=1)=1𝑝superscript𝑓⋆conditional1x11p(f^{\\star}=1|\\textbf{x}=1)=1. One implication of Theorem 1 is that it suggests the following two-stage approach for learning an unbiased classifier. First, we learn a scoring function f​(x)𝑓𝑥f(x) that serves as an approximation to η​(x)𝜂𝑥\\eta(x), such as using the margin in support vector machines (e.g. Platt’s scaling [ref]39) or the softmax activation output in deep neural networks (e.g. temperature scaling ). Second, we adjust the output of f𝑓f to remove bias using a group-wise thresholding rule with randomization at the thresholds. Throughout our discussion, we have assumed that the groups Xksubscript𝑋𝑘X_{k} in either Definition 1 or 2 are fixed. Indeed, this is necessary. Our next theorem shows that no algorithm can possibly achieve fairness across all possible groups Xk∈2𝒳subscript𝑋𝑘superscript2𝒳X_{k}\\in 2^{\\mathcal{X}} except under degenerate conditions. Hence, to circumvent such an impossibility result, one has to fix the choice of the groups Xksubscript𝑋𝑘X_{k} in which bias is to be controlled. Let 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} be the instance space and 𝒴={0, 1}𝒴01\\mathcal{Y}=\\{0,\\,1\\} be a target set. Let 1S:𝒳→{0,1}:subscript1𝑆→𝒳011_{S}:\\mathcal{X}\\to\\{0,1\\} be an arbitrary (possibly randomized) binary-valued function on 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} and define γ:𝒳→ :𝛾→𝒳01\\gamma:\\mathcal{X}\\to  by γ​(x)=p​(1S​(x)=1|x=x)𝛾𝑥𝑝subscript1𝑆xconditional1x𝑥\\gamma(x)=p(1_{S}(\\textbf{x})=1\\,|\\,\\textbf{x}=x),\nwhere the probability is evaluated over the randomness of 1S:𝒳→{0,1}:subscript1𝑆→𝒳011_{S}:\\mathcal{X}\\to\\{0,1\\}. Write γ¯=𝔼x​[γ​(x)]¯𝛾subscript𝔼xdelimited-[]𝛾x\\bar{\\gamma}=\\mathbb{E}_{\\textbf{x}}[\\gamma(\\textbf{x})].\nThen, for any binary predictor f:𝒳→{0,1}:𝑓→𝒳01f:\\mathcal{X}\\to\\{0,1\\}, one has: where the supremum is over all binary partitions of the instance space and 𝒞​(f​(x),γ​(x);π​(x))𝒞𝑓x𝛾x𝜋x\\mathcal{C}\\big{(}f(\\textbf{{x}}),\\gamma(\\textbf{x});\\;\\pi(\\textbf{x})\\big{)} is given by Definition 1. A converse to Theorem 2 holds as well by the data processing inequality in information theory . As a result, a deterministic classifier f:𝒳→{0,1}:𝑓→𝒳01f:\\mathcal{X}\\to\\{0,1\\} is universally unbiased w.r.t. a sensitive class S𝑆S across all possible groups Xk∈2𝒳subscript𝑋𝑘superscript2𝒳X_{k}\\in 2^{\\mathcal{X}} if and only if the representation x carries zero mutual information with the sensitive attribute or if f𝑓f is constant almost everywhere.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: an unbiased classifier.
