      "content": "Paper Title: Designing Machine Learning Toolboxes: Concepts, Principles and Patterns\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMachine learning (ML) applications typically involve a number of steps: one first specifies, trains and selects an appropriate model and then validates and deploys it. ML practitioners write code to evaluate such workflows. Application code often incorporates classes and functions from one or more software packages called toolboxes. Toolboxes provide prefabricated pieces of code that make it faster to write software. Instead of constructing every piece of software from scratch, one can simply put together prefabricated pieces of code. Popular examples include \nscikit-learn\n in Python, \nWeka\n in Java, \nMLJ\n in Julia, and \nmlr3\n or \ncaret\n in R. Toolboxes have become the backbone of modern data science and principal tool for ML practitioners in recent years. The applicability and effectiveness of a toolbox depends crucially on its design. The design determines not only how easy it is for practitioners to understand and use toolboxes but also how easily they can be tested, maintained and extended. Despite the importance of toolboxes, the key design principles in their construction have never been fully discussed. In this paper, we try to close this gap by analyzing common designs of toolboxes and deriving reusable principles and patterns. Much of the existing software literature on ML/AI has focused on best practices, design patterns and architecture for ML systems   [ref]30, but little attention has been paid to design at the toolbox level, even though toolboxes are a central component in ML systems (i.e. kernel software) implementing core algorithmic and mathematical functionality. In fact, authors often point out that there is a lack of strong abstractions to support ML software, hindering much needed progress towards a more declarative SQL-like language for ML/AI  . Similarly, in the ML literature, while the importance of toolbox development has been widely recognized , discussions on design are still rare. For example, toolbox developers often subscribe to a set of principles when presenting their work, however these principles typically remain abstract, with literature primarily discussing features or usage, and not design (see e.g. Buitinck et al. ). While the actual software tends to contain a wealth of design ideas, we are not aware of literature references where data science specific patterns, or the process of deriving concrete implementations from design principles, are described or studied. In this paper, we make a first attempt at consolidating the science of ML toolbox design. Rather than describing a single toolbox, or analyzing ML/AI software at the system or platform level, this paper focuses specifically on generalizable design principles and patterns for ML toolboxes. We investigate ML toolbox design by developing a well-grounded conceptual model for the ML domain. At its core, we propose a simple but powerful idea called scientific types – a new type system which captures the data scientific purpose of key objects in the ML domain (e.g. data objects, probability distributions or algorithms).\nWhen applying scientific typing to common ML objects, we are able to derive clear principles and reusable patterns that can not only explain central aspects of existing toolboxes, but can also guide the development of new ones. Toolbox design – much like any software design – is hard. One has to identify the relevant objects, abstract them at the right level of granularity, define class interfaces, and specify hierarchies and relationships among them. In comparison to classical software engineering, ML/AI toolbox development raises a number of additional questions: In which respects is the ML domain different from other domains? How can we find useful abstractions in the ML domain? For example, how can we identify useful and meaningful categories for ML algorithms? How do we define interfaces for different algorithms? Our aim is to motivate and explain the principles and patterns we propose in a way that other developers, practitioners and decision makers who rely on ML toolboxes can refer to them when assessing designs. A natural source of relevant ideas, useful formalism and best practices is found in the corpus of software engineering. Our approach largely falls under domain-driven design as put forward by Evans , but also draws on ideas from “design by contract” , “responsibility-driven design”    and pattern-oriented design  [ref]14. While much is direct transfer from existing software engineering practice, there is a substantial aspect in which ML departs from other domains: algorithms, interfaces and workflows are closely intertwined with mathematical and statistical formalism – to an extent that mathematical objects are not only at the methodological core, but a key element in representation, workflow specification and user interaction. This situation poses unique challenges which we attempt to address in what follows by a combination of formal mathematical statistics, well-grounded design principles based on our new scientific type system, adapted state-of-art architectural patterns from widely used toolboxes, and our own experience of designing multiple ML toolboxes in different languages (e.g. \nsktime\n, \nMLJ\n, \nmlr3proba\n, \npysf\n, \nskpro\n, \nmlaut\n). In our analysis, we rely on object-oriented programming (OOP), the predominant paradigm for most complex ML/AI projects. While OOP is often assumed without rationale, we instead motivate specifically why OOP is especially well suited for ML toolboxes. Our analysis also extends in theory to other programming paradigms. We intend our contribution to be a state-of-art reference for future toolbox engineers, a summary of best practices, a collection of ML design patterns which may become useful for future research, and, potentially, the first steps towards higher-level declarative programming languages for constructing AI.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: designs of toolboxes and deriving reusable principles and patterns.
