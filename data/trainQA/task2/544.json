Recall from the introduction that the diagonal (or in case of the Kirchhoff index even only its sum, the trace –\nsee Appendix B.1)\nof 𝐋†superscript𝐋†\\mathbf{L}^{\\dagger} is enough to compute electrical closeness and related measures, also see Eq. (6) below.\nAlgorithms that approximate the diagonal (or the trace) of matrices\nthat are only implicitly available often use iterative methods ,\nsparse direct methods  0,\nMonte Carlo  or\ndeterministic probing techniques  [ref]9.\nA popular approach is the standard Monte-Carlo method for the trace of 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A},\ndue to Hutchinson . The idea is to estimate the trace of 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}\nby observing the action of 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} (in terms of matrix-vector products)\non a sufficiently large sample of random vectors rksubscript𝑟𝑘r_{k}. In our case, this would require\nto solve a large number of Laplacian linear systems with vectors rksubscript𝑟𝑘r_{k} as\nright-hand sides.\nAvron and Toledo  proved that the method takes\n𝒪​(log⁡n/ϵ2)𝒪𝑛superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\mathcal{O}(\\log{n}/\\epsilon^{2}) samples to achieve a maximum error ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon with probability at least 1−δ1𝛿1-\\delta.\nThe approach from Hutchinson  has been extended by Bekas\net al. [ref]9 for estimating the diagonal of 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A}.\nFinally, Barthelmé et al.  have recently proposed\na combinatorial algorithm to approximate the trace (not the diagonal) of the\ninverse of a matrix closely related to the Laplacian. Their algorithm can be\nseen as a special case of our algorithm in the situation where a universal\nvertex exists. Along with the introduction of the measure,\nRef. \nprovided numerical evaluations of Eq. (5)\non various graph models.\nHowever, no algorithm to compute the measure without (pseudo)inverting 𝐋𝐋\\mathbf{L} has been\nproposed yet.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: that approximate the diagonal (or the trace) of matrices\nthat are only implicitly available often use iterative methods ,\nsparse direct methods  0,\nMonte Carlo  or\ndeterministic probing techniques  [ref]9.\nA popular approach is the standard Monte-Carlo method for the trace of 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A},\ndue to Hutchinson .
