      "content": "Paper Title: FE^\"ANN\" – An efficient data-driven multiscale approach based on physics-constrained neural networks and automated data mining\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the context of multiscale problems, the mentioned data-based methods can be used as surrogate models which replace the computationally expensive simulation of RVEs [ref]43. The high flexibility of trained networks with simultaneously excellent prediction qualities is thereby proven in numerous works:\nIn [ref]38 ANNs are used to describe the homogenized response of cubic lattice metamaterials exhibiting large deformations and buckling phenomena. Thereby, several types of hyperelastic ML-based models which fulfill basic physical requirements are used and compared to each other. Based on this, an extension to polyconvex hyperelastic models is given in .\nIn , FFNs and RNNs (recurrent neural networks) are used to replicate the homogenization of RVEs revealing inelastic behavior of the individual components. Thereby, also unknown paths can be predicted with the trained networks. Similarly, ANNs that replace the inelastic constitutive responses of composite materials sampled by RVE simulations are shown in . Thereby, in addition, a deep reinforcement learning combinatorics game is used to automatically find an optimal set of network hyper-parameters from a decision tree.\nA data-driven multiscale framework called deep material network is shown in   . Thereby, the homogenized RVE response is reproduced by a network including a collection of connected mechanistic building blocks with analytical homogenization solutions. With that, a complex effective response could be described without the loss of essential physics. An extension of the deep material network approach to fully coupled thermo-mechanical multiscale simulations of composite materials is given in [ref]49. Furthermore, ANNs can be used to link microstructural characteristics and effective properties.\nFor example, in , an ML framework for predicting macroscopic yield as a function of crystallographic texture is described. An ML-based multiscale calibration of constitutive models representing the effective response of rate dependent composite materials is applied to brain white matter in . Based on a library of calibrated parameters corresponding to a set of microstructural characteristics, an ML model which predicts the constitutive model parameters directly from a new microstructure is trained. Similarly, an ANN is trained to predict the elastic properties of short fiber reinforced plastics in . Finally, the application of data-based techniques as surrogate models in decoupled multiscale schemes, which enable the simulation of macroscopic engineering components, is promising. In the pioneering work , a decoupled multiscale scheme using an ANN-based surrogate model has been shown for elastic composites with cubic microstructures.\nAnother multiscale methodology is presented in . Therein, a hybrid macroscopic surrogate model is used, i. e., a traditional constitutive model is combined with a data-driven correction.\nAn ML-based multiscale framework for the simulation of the elastic response of metals having a polycrystalline microstructure is presented in . Therein, the database is generated by using a 3D FFT (fast Fourier transform) solver. Based on this,   show an extension to elastoplasticity, whereby ANNs are used for the description of the yield surface and the stress within a hybrid modeling approach. Similarly, the simulation of the elastic-plastic deformation behavior of open-cell foam structures is shown in  . Thereby, a hybrid model including two ANNs is used as the macroscopic surrogate model. Therein, the first network serves for the description of the macroscale yield function and the second one for the prediction of the floating direction. In [ref]49, two scale simulations of thermo-mechanical problems are solved by using deep material networks. Applying the modeling strategy initially proposed in , a multiscale scheme for the inelastic behavior of lattice material structures is described in . An application of ANNs as surrogate models describing the anisotropic electrical response of graphene/polymer nanocomposites is shown in . Furthermore, in , the application of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as surrogate models within multiscale simulations of elastoplastic problems is shown. Furthermore, the RNN-based approach is compared to full FE2 simulations. An application of RNN surrogate models to viscoplasticity is described in . A combination of fully coupled FE2 simulations with an adaptive switching to ANN-based surrogate models for the complex simulation of RVEs is shown in . In addition, a multiscale framework based on the data-driven mechanics approach  is presented in  for the application to sand.\nThereby, the necessary data set is extracted from lower scale simulations. In , a multi-level method is used within a data-driven multiscale scheme which is applied for the simulation of solid foam materials.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: In the context of multiscale problems, the mentioned data-based methods can be used as surrogate models which replace the computationally expensive simulation of RVEs [ref]43.
