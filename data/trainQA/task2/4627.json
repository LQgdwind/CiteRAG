Unlike conventional learning problems where a deep model is presented with only a single task at once, a continual learner is exposed to a sequence of different tasks featuring varying characteristics in terms of different distributions or different target classes . Since the goal is to develop a never-ending learning algorithm which must scale well to possibly infinite numbers of tasks, it is impossible to perform retraining processes from scratch when facing new tasks. The CL problem prohibits the excessive use of old data samples and only a small quantity of old data samples can be stored in the memory. The CL problem leads to two major research questions. The first question is how to quickly transfer relevant knowledge of old tasks when embracing a new task. The second problem is how to avoid loss of generalization of old tasks when learning a new task. The loss of generalization power of old tasks when learning a new task is known as a catastrophic forgetting problem  [ref]20 where learning new tasks catastrophically overwrites important parameters of old tasks. The continual learner has to accumulate knowledge from streaming tasks and achieves improved intelligence overtime. There exists three common approaches for continual learning [ref]20: memory-based approach , structure-based approach , regularization-based approach . The regularization-based approach makes use of a regularization term penalizing important parameters of old tasks from changing when learning new tasks. Although this approach is computationally light and easy to implement, this approach does not scale well for a large-scale CL problem because an overlapping region across all tasks are difficult to obtain. The structure-based approach applies a network growing strategy to accommodate new tasks while freezing old parameters to prevent the catastrophic forgetting problem. This approach imposes expensive complexity if the network growing phase is not controlled properly or the structural learning mechanism is often done via computationally expensive architecture search approaches thus being infeasible in the online continual learning setting. The memory-based approach stores a small subset of old samples to be replayed along with new samples to handle the catastrophic forgetting problem. Compared to the former two approaches, this approach usually betters the learning performance. The underlying challenge of this approach is to keep a modest memory size. SCALE is categorized as a memory-based approach here where a tiny episodic memory storing old samples is put forward for experience replay mechanisms. The notion of adversarial continual learning (ACL) is proposed in [ref]10. The main idea is to utilize the adversarial learning strategy  [ref]12 to extract task-aligned features of all tasks deemed less prone to forgetting than task-specific features. It offers disjoint representations between common features and private features to be combined as an input of multi-head classifiers. The main bottleneck of this approach lies in expensive complexities because private features are generated by task-specific networks while common features are crafted by the adversarial game played by task-specific discriminators. In addition, ACL is based on an iterative training mechanism which does not fit for online (single-epoch) continual learning problems. This paper proposes scalable adversarial continual learning (SCALE) reducing the complexity of ACL significantly via a parameter generator network and a single discriminator. The parameter generator network produces scaling and shifting parameters converting task-invariant features produced by the adversarial learning mechanism to task-specific features  . Our approach does not need to store task-specific parameters rather the parameter generator network predicts these parameters leading to private features. Production of private features are carried out with two light-weight operations, scaling and shifting. The parameter generator is trained in the meta-learning way using the validation loss of the base network, i.e., feature extractor and classifier. The meta-learning strategy is done by two data partitions: training set and validation set portraying both new and old concepts. The training set updates the base network while the validation set trains the parameter generator. Our approach distinguishes itself from  where the adversarial training approach is adopted to produce task-invariant features and we do not need to construct two different memories as per . Unlike ACL, the adversarial game is played by a single discriminator without any catastrophic problem while still aligning the features of all tasks well. SCALE outperforms prominent baselines with over 1%percent11\\% margins in accuracy and forgetting index while exhibiting significant improvements in execution times. The ablation study, memory analysis and sensitivity analysis further substantiate the advantages of SCALE for the online (one-epoch) continual learning problems. This paper offers four major contributions: 1) a new online continual learning approach, namely SCALE, is proposed; 2) our approach provides a scalable adversarial continual learning approach relying only on a single parameter generator for feature transformations leading to task-specific features and a single discriminator to induce task-invariant features; 3) the training process is done in the meta-learning manner using a new combination of three loss functions: the cross-entropy loss function, the DER++ loss function  and the adversarial loss function [ref]10. Although the adversarial loss function already exists in [ref]10, the adversarial game is done differently here using the concept of BAGAN  rather than that the gradient reversal strategy [ref]10 [ref]12; 4) All source codes, data and raw numerical results are made available in https://github.com/TanmDL/SCALE to help further studies.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: is how to avoid loss of generalization of old tasks when learning a new task.
