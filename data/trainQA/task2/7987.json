      "content": "Paper Title: Limitations of Affine Integer Relaxations for Solving Constraint Satisfaction Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIt is known that solving the Tseitin equations over any Abelian group ΓΓ\\Gamma can be reduced to the graph isomorphism problem [ref]6. The pair of graphs that comes out of this reduction are (generalizations of) the famous Cai-Fürer-Immerman (CFI) graphs .\nThis reduction to graph isomorphism also works for the Tseitin instances with the special constraint λ​(v∗)∈{(1,0),(0,1)}𝜆superscript𝑣1001\\lambda(v^{*})\\in\\{(1,0),(0,1)\\} [ref]8. In this case, the resulting graphs consist of several copies of CFI graphs over the group ℤ2×ℤ3subscriptℤ2subscriptℤ3\\mathbb{Z}_{2}\\times\\mathbb{Z}_{3}, some of which have their “twist” in ℤ2subscriptℤ2\\mathbb{Z}_{2} and some in ℤ3subscriptℤ3\\mathbb{Z}_{3}. These are combined in a so-called “isomorphism-or-construction”. This is a standard construction which admits an isomorphism if and only if the involved ℤ2subscriptℤ2\\mathbb{Z}_{2}-CFI-graphs or the ℤ3subscriptℤ3\\mathbb{Z}_{3}-CFI-graphs are isomorphic. So our original extended Tseitin instance is unsatisfiable if and only if the two graphs given by this isomorphism-or-construction are not isomorphic to each other.\nIt is not known whether graph isomorphism in general can be formulated as a CSP-instance of a tractable template structure.\nBut in the special case that we have here,\nwe are considering vertex-colored graphs of bounded color class size,\nthat is, at most a constant number of vertices have the same color.\nFor such graphs,\ngraph isomorphism is known to be polynomial-time solvable  and\nthere is also a known CSP encoding of this isomorphism problem [ref]6: For colored graphs, the sought isomorphism must preserve colors. Thus, an isomorphism can be thought of as an assignment f𝑓f that maps each color class to a permutation in the symmetric group Sdsubscript𝑆𝑑S_{d}, where d𝑑d is the size of the color class. These permutations must satisfy the constraint that for every pair of colors c1,c2subscript𝑐1subscript𝑐2c_{1},c_{2}, the assigned permutations f​(c1)𝑓subscript𝑐1f(c_{1}) and f​(c2)𝑓subscript𝑐2f(c_{2}) correctly preserve edges and non-edges between the vertices in these color classes.\nEvery such f𝑓f satisfying this defines an isomorphism. Hence, we can in fact write the bounded color class isomorphism problem as a CSP over the non-Abelian group Sdsubscript𝑆𝑑S_{d}. Note that its constraints are not linear equations but cosets of subgroups. So this template is indeed tractable and actually even Mal’tsev. We describe all these constructions related to graph isomorphism in Section 3.\n To sum up, we start with the Tseitin instance over ℤ2×ℤ3subscriptℤ2subscriptℤ3\\mathbb{Z}_{2}\\times\\mathbb{Z}_{3} with the “disjunction constraint” λ​(v∗)∈{(1,0),(0,1)}𝜆superscript𝑣1001\\lambda(v^{*})\\in\\{(1,0),(0,1)\\}. This is transformed into an instance of bounded color class size graph isomorphism, which consists of isomorphism-or-construction applied to CFI graphs over ℤ2subscriptℤ2\\mathbb{Z}_{2} and ℤ3subscriptℤ3\\mathbb{Z}_{3}. This is then expressed as a Mal’tsev CSP over the symmetric group.\nThus, we go through various intermediate constructions from\nspecific instances of an NP-complete CSP over the Abelian group ℤ2×ℤ3subscriptℤ2subscriptℤ3\\mathbb{Z}_{2}\\times\\mathbb{Z}_{3} (including a non-affine constraint)\nto an instance of a tractable CSP over the non-Abelian group Sdsubscript𝑆𝑑S_{d}.\nNote that this is only possible because we are dealing with specific instances of the NP-complete CSP – we are not translating all instances.\nFor the original Tseitin instance, the proof from [ref]8 yields an integral solution to the width-k𝑘k system associated with the Tseitin instance.\nWe show in Sections 3 and 4 that this solution can be pulled through the constructions and also gives an integral solution for the width-k𝑘k system associated with the bounded color class size graph isomorphism CSP over Sdsubscript𝑆𝑑S_{d}.\nA particular strength of this construction is its robustness with respect to the width k𝑘k of the equation system. Because the arguments ultimately make use of the expansion properties of the underlying graphs, no constant value of k𝑘k suffices to solve our example. A weakness seems to be that setting the value of a particular partial homomorphism to 111 in the integral solution suffices to determine how the disjunction between ℤ2subscriptℤ2\\mathbb{Z}_{2} to ℤ3subscriptℤ3\\mathbb{Z}_{3} is resolved. Thus, the linear combination that we use to generate the integral solution is no longer available then. This is the reason why we believe – as already noted earlier – that C(BLP+AIP) and the cohomological k𝑘k-consistency algorithm may be able to solve our example correctly.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: It is known that solving the Tseitin equations over any Abelian group ΓΓ\\Gamma can be reduced to the graph isomorphism problem [ref]6.
