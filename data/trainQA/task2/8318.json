      "content": "Paper Title: Feasibly Constructive Proof of Schwartz-Zippel Lemma and the Complexity of Finding Hitting Sets\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile existence proofs, particularly those establishing the presence of certain combinatorial objects, are very useful‚Äîfor instance, in probabilistic\ncombinatorics, where one seeks to identify objects with certain properties that are as large or small as possible, such as expanders or combinatorial designs‚Äîit is widely acknowledged that constructive arguments, which provide explicit methods for constructing these objects, are often even more fruitful. This is especially significant in algorithmic contexts, where the utility of the objects (e.g., expanders) depends on their ‚Äúexplicitness‚Äù, meaning that they must be feasibly computable, typically in polynomial time. In computational complexity theory, the notions of constructivity and explicitness are equally critical. Fundamental questions about separating complexity classes hinge on explicit languages, such as the satisfiability problem (SAT), and whether SAT can be solved by polynomial-size circuits. For random, non-explicit languages, the analogous problems are almost trivially resolved: a simple counting argument shows that there exist non-explicit Boolean functions that cannot be computed by Boolean circuits of polynomial-size. A related but distinct approach to feasible constructivity in complexity theory is found in the framework of bounded arithmetic, which is the field that studies the computational complexity of concepts needed to prove different statements. In this setting, one aims to formalise constructivity in a more rigorous and systematic manner. Bounded arithmetic is a general name for a family of weak formal theories of\narithmetic (that is, natural numbers, and whose intended model is ‚Ñï‚Ñï\\mathbb{N}). These theories are characterized by their axioms and language (set of symbols), starting from a basic set of axioms providing the elementary properties of numbers. Each bounded\narithmetic theory possesses different additional axioms postulating the existence of different sets of numbers, or different kinds of induction principles. Based on its specific axioms, each theory\nof bounded arithmetic proves the totality of functions from different complexity classes (e.g.,\npolynomial-time functions). We can typically consider such theories as working\nover a logical language that contains the function symbols of that prescribed complexity class. In\nthis sense, proofs in the theory use concepts from a specific complexity class, and we can say that\nthe theory captures ‚Äúreasoning in this class‚Äù (e.g., ‚Äúpolynomial-time reasoning‚Äù). In the current work we shall start with a standard naturally written constructive proof (in the ‚Äúmeta-theory‚Äù) of the Schwartz-Zippel Lemma (Section¬†1.2), following the first, less formal approach, to constructivity. We then show how the new proof fits in the formal approach to feasible constructivity of bounded arithmetic. We moreover exemplify the usual benefits of such proofs by showing applications both in bounded arithmetic and computational complexity. Background on theories of bounded arithmetic, their\nutility and applications.\nWhile the first theory for polynomial-time reasoning was the equational theory ùñØùñµùñØùñµ\\mathsf{PV}¬†considered\nby Cook , bounded arithmetic goes back to the work of Parikh  and Paris-Wilkie . In a seminal work, Buss¬† introduced other theories of bounded arithmetic and laid much of the foundation for future work in the field. Using formal theories of bounded arithmetic is important for several reasons. First, it provides a rigorous framework to ask questions about provability, independence, and the limits of what can be proved by which means and arguments. The quest for ‚Äúbarriers‚Äù in computational complexity‚Äînamely, the idea that some forms of arguments are futile as a way to solve the fundamental hardness problems in complexity‚Äîsuch as Relativisation by Baker, Gill and Solovay , Natural Proofs by Razborov and Rudich¬† or Algebrisation by Aaronson and Wigderson¬†, has played an important role in complexity theory. Nevertheless, the language of formal logic provides a more systematic framework for such a project (cf.¬† 9 and the recent work 1).\nIn that sense, bounded arithmetic allows us to identify suitable logical theories capable of formalising most contemporary complexity theory, and determine whether the major fundamental open problems in the field about lower bounds are provable or unprovable\nwithin these theories. Furthermore, bounded arithmetic serves as a framework in which the bounded reverse mathematics\nprogram is developed (in an analogy to Friedman and Simpson reverse mathematics program ). In this program, one seeks to find the weakest theory capable of proving a given theorem. In other words, we seek to discover what are the axioms that are not only sufficient to prove a certain theorem, but rather are also necessary.\nSpecial theorems of interest are those of computer science and computational complexity\ntheory. The motivation is to shed light on the role of complexity classes in proofs, in the hope\nto delineate, for example, those concepts that are needed to progress on major problems in computational\ncomplexity from those that are not. For instance, it has been identified that apparently most\nresults in contemporary computational complexity can be proved using polynomial-time concepts\n(e.g., in ùñØùñµùñØùñµ\\mathsf{PV}) (cf.¬†), and it is important to understand whether stronger theories and concepts are needed to prove certain results. Accordingly, recent results in bounded arithmetic 1 seek to systematically build a bounded reverse mathematics of complexity lower bounds, in particular, as these are perhaps the most fundamental questions in complexity. This serves to establish complexity lower bounds as ‚Äúfundamental mathematical axioms‚Äù which are equivalent, over the base theory, to rudimentary combinatorial principles such as the pigeonhole principle or related principles. Indeed, we will show that the (upper bound) statement about\nthe existence of small hitting sets is equivalent to the (dual weak) pigeonhole principle. (It is interesting to note that the existence of explicit small hitting sets, which implies efficient PIT, is also a disguised lower bound statement as shown by Kabanets and Impagliazzo 3; though we do not attempt to formalise or pursue this direction in the current work.) Another advantage of bounded arithmetic comes in the form of ‚Äúwitnessing‚Äù theorems. These are results that automatically convert formal proofs (of low logical-complexity theorems, namely, few quantifier alternations) in bounded arithmetic to feasible algorithms (usually, deterministic polynomial-time ones).\nWitnessing theorems come in different flavours and strength, and recent work show the advantage of this method in both lower and upper bounds 0 8 9. Moreover, the somewhat forbidding framework of bounded arithmetic forces one to think algorithmically from the get go, optimising constructions. This resulted in new arguments to existing results, which proved very useful in complexity, beyond the scope of bounded arithmetic. A celebrated example is Razborov‚Äôs new coding argument of the H√•stad‚Äôs switching lemmas 7, which emerged as work in bounded arithmetic . (Intriguingly, our new argument for Schwartz-Zippel will also be based on a coding argument.) Randomness and feasibly constructive proofs.¬†One central part of complexity that was challenging to fit into bounded arithmetic is that of random algorithms. Randomness usually entails thinking of probability spaces of exponential size (e.g., the outcome of nùëõn coin flips), and so cannot be directly used in most bounded arithmetic theories which cannot state the existence of exponential size sets. Initial work by Wilkie (unpublished) [26, Theorem¬†7.3.7], taken as well by Thapen [ref]45, and systematically developed in a series of works of Je≈ô√°bek (cf.¬†1), concerned how to work with randomness in bounded arithmetic.\nNevertheless, one of the most well-known examples for using randomness in computing, the question of formulating Schwartz-Zippel and polynomial identity testing in particular, was left open due to the exponential nature of the standard argument (i.e., the need to treat polynomials as sums of exponential many monomials; see the first paragraph in Section¬†1.2). For example, L√™ and Cook in 8 list this as an open question (where they settled for formalising a special case of the Schwartz-Zippel¬†Lemma). The formalisation of Schwartz-Zippel¬†Lemma and PIT in bounded arithmetic and its consequences we present, hopefully exemplify\nseveral of the benefits of bounded arithmetic described above. It serves to fill in the missing link in the\nformalisation of complexity of randomness; it produces a new (coding) argument of Schwartz-Zippel lemma that may be\nof independent interest; it establishes the existence of hitting sets as equivalent to the dual weak pigeonhole\nprinciple, and thus provides further examples of the ‚Äúaxiomatic‚Äù nature of building blocks in complexity theory;\nlastly, it has consequences to computational complexity, by showing that hitting sets are complete for the class of\nrange avoidance problems.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: be directly used in most bounded arithmetic theories which cannot state the existence of exponential size sets.
