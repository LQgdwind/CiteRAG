      "content": "Paper Title: History Repeats Itself: Human Motion Prediction via Motion Attention\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHuman motion prediction consists of forecasting the future poses of a person given a history of their previous motion. Predicting human motion can be highly beneficial for tasks such as human tracking , human-robot interaction , and human motion generation for computer graphics   .\nTo tackle the problem effectively, recent approaches use deep neural networks  [ref]5  to model the temporal historical data. Traditional methods, such as hidden Markov models  and Gaussian Process Dynamical Models 2, have proven effective for simple motions, such as walking and golf swings. However, they are typically outperformed by deep learning ones on more complex motions.\nThe most common trend in modeling the sequential data that constitutes human motion consists of using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) [ref]5 . However, as discussed in 7, in the mid- to long-term horizon, RNNs tend to generate static poses because they struggle to keep track of long-term history. To tackle this problem, existing works 7  either rely on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which are notoriously hard to train , or introduce an additional long-term encoder to represent information from the further past 7. Unfortunately, such an encoder treats the entire motion history equally, thus not allowing the model to put more emphasis on some parts of the past motion that better reflect the context of the current motion. In this paper, by contrast, we introduce an attention-based motion prediction approach that effectively exploits historical information by dynamically adapting its focus on the previous motions to the current context. Our method is motivated by the observation that humans tend to repeat their motion, not only in short periodical activities, such as walking, but also in more complex actions occurring across longer time periods, such as sports and cooking activities .Therefore, we aim to find the relevant historical information to predict future motion. To the best of our knowledge, only 0 has attempted to leverage attention for motion prediction. This, however, was achieved in a frame-wise manner, by comparing the human pose from the last observable frame with each one in the historical sequence. As such, this approach fails to reflect the motion direction and is affected by the fact that similar poses may appear in completely different motions. For instance, in most Human3.6M activities, the actor will at some point be standing with their arm resting along their body. To overcome this, we therefore propose to model motion attention, and thus compare the last visible sub-sequence with a history of motion sub-sequences. To this end, inspired by [ref]20, we represent each sub-sequence in trajectory space using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). We then exploit our motion attention as weights to aggregate the entire DCT-encoded motion history into a future motion estimate. This estimate is combined with the latest observed motion, and the result acts as input to a graph convolutional network (GCN), which lets us better encode spatial dependencies between different joints.As evidenced by our experiments on Human3.6M 0, AMASS 9, and 3DPW , and illustrated in Fig. 1, our motion attention-based approach consistently outperforms the state of the art on short-term and long-term motion prediction by training a single unified model for both settings. This contrasts with the previous-best model LTD [ref]20, which requires training different models for different settings to achieve its best performance.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that it can effectively leverage the repetitiveness of motion in longer sequences. Our contributions can be summarized as follows. (i) We introduce an attention-based model that exploits motions instead of static frames to better leverage historical information for motion prediction; (ii) Our motion attention allows us to train a unified model for both short-term and long-term prediction; (iii) Our approach can effectively make use of motion repetitiveness in long-term history; (iv) It yields state-of-the-art results and generalizes better than existing methods across datasets and actions.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: for tasks such as human tracking , human-robot interaction , and human motion generation for computer graphics   .\nTo tackle the problem effectively, recent approaches use deep neural networks  [ref]5  to model the temporal historical data.
