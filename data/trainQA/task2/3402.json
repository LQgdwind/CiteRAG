      "content": "Paper Title: CoTV: Cooperative Control for Traffic Light Signals and Connected Autonomous Vehicles using Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAlgorithm 1 presents the training process of CoTV, and the outcome is the policy functions for traffic light agents M𝑀M and CAV agents N𝑁N, πT​Lsubscript𝜋𝑇𝐿\\pi_{TL} and πC​A​Vsubscript𝜋𝐶𝐴𝑉\\pi_{CAV}. The trained policy π𝜋\\pi is expected to guide agents to select one appropriate action a𝑎a from the action set in a certain state s𝑠s for maximizing the accumulated value of reward r𝑟r. We predefine the termination condition as the number of training iterations I𝐼I. In each iteration, there are E𝐸E episodes running in parallel, and each episode lasts H𝐻H timesteps. DRL trajectory data τ𝜏\\tau is collected per simulation timestep in each episode to extend the training batch B𝐵B, and then sampled K𝐾K times to update the traffic light and CAV policy parameter θT​Lsubscript𝜃𝑇𝐿\\theta_{TL} and θC​A​Vsubscript𝜃𝐶𝐴𝑉\\theta_{CAV} through gradient descent. Specifically, the traffic light controllers of CoTV select the closest CAV to the intersection on each incoming road as the CAV agent, as in Line 10 of Algorithm 1. These CAV agents have the potential to increase intersection throughput by forming a platoon with the rest vehicles on the same road . The communication exchange schemes for the cooperative control of CoTV occur in the agent receiving state, in Line 13 of Algorithm 1. Traffic light controllers and CAV exchange information with each other, involving the current signal status of traffic light and speed, acceleration, and location of CAV. We choose PPO algorithm  for the following reasons. The PPO algorithm has the advantage of being easy to implement and achieving monotonic reward improvement. DQN is the common algorithm to train traffic light controllers  , which is efficient in the discrete actions (e.g., a binary set of signal phase adjustment). Whereas DQN does not perform well on continuous actions (e.g., vehicle acceleration of any real number within a certain range) . In contrast, PPO can be applied for scenarios with discrete actions or continuous actions. On the other hand, compared with traffic light signals that have a pre-defined phase sequence, the initial driving behavior of DRL-controlled CAV has lots of unreasonable stop-and-go and standstill. The constrained policy update of PPO aims to improve reward monotonically, which is more stable to train CAV and better than Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic used in . Although TRPO can also constraint the policy update, PPO is easy to implement and simpler to sample data, which helps the cooperation of traffic light controllers and CAV. When interacting with the environment, CoTV applies parameter sharing [ref]9 to all agents of the same type in the multi-agent DRL system, which can converge the training process faster and benefit from shared experience, especially in large-scale applications .\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: update, PPO is easy to implement and simpler to sample data, which helps the cooperation of traffic light controllers and CAV.
