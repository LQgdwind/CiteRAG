Predictive performance.\nTable 2 shows the reactant top-k\naccuracies for different methods.\nThese methods include, among others, transformer-based  ,\ngraph-to-graph  or template-based ones .\nSome methods [ref]60  [ref]61      that also report results on USPTO-50k were ommitted here, either due to test set leakage or a different evaluation conditions,\nas detailed Appendix Section A3.\nWe re-implemented and improved the NeuralSym method as described in Appendix Section A3.\nand added the popularity baseline described in\nSection 4.1.\nHyperparameter selection on the validation set\nreturned an MHN model with two stacked\nHopfield layers, which we refer to as\nMHNreact (see Appendix Section A3).\nWe ranked reactant sets by the score of the template\nused to produce them. If a template execution\nyielded multiple results all were included in the\nprediction in random order.\nTable 2 shows reactant top-kk\\mathrm{k}\naccuracy for different methods.\nOur method achieved state-of-the-art performance for k≥5k5\\mathrm{k}\\geq 5 and approaches it for k=1,3k13\\mathrm{k}=1,3.\nTogether with Dual-TB  this puts\ntemplate-based methods ahead of other approaches at all considered values of k. Inference speed.\nAside from predictive performance,\ninference speed is also vital for retrosynthesis methods.\nTherefore, CASP methods are often\nevaluated by their ability to find a route\nin a given time   .\nTemplate-based methods are sometimes reported to be slow\n , however\nwe found that inference speed was not reported in mentioned studies and are seldom reported in general, despite their importance.\nAccuracy can be traded for inference speed for many models.\nFor some, this trade-off is achieved\nby varying beam size\n .\nIn template-based approaches, the number of executed templates can be varied and traded off against speed.\nWe compared inference speed of our MHN method with the following baselines. We obtained results for GLN from their paper .\nWe trained a Transformer baseline using the code of , as a representative of transformer-based methods   .\nAdditionally, we also include the NeuralSym  model we implemented in the comparison.\nThe results are displayed in Fig. 4.\nAt comparable or better performance, our method\nachieves inference speed of up to two magnitudes\nfaster compared to Transformer and GLN.\nWhile NeuralSym is faster than our model\nfor some fixed values of accuracy,\nMHN yields better maximum accuracy with comparable speed.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: Next we compare our method to\npreviously suggested ones in the\nsingle-step retrosynthesis task using the USPTO-50k data set.\nWe follow the preprocessing procedure of [ref]12\nand used rdchiral  to extract reaction templates.\nFollowing [ref]12\nwe shuffled the data and\nassign 80/10/10% of the samples in each reaction class into\ntrain/validation/test set\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
