Parameter settings.\nTable I summarizes the parameter settings of generating the watermark key samples.\nFor the LeNet-5 model [ref]13, we selected 100 samples from the MNIST dataset  (class ‚Äú0‚Äù) as the watermark key samples. For the VGG-16 model , we selected 100 samples from the CIFAR-100 dataset  (class ‚Äúapple‚Äù) as the watermark key samples. In addition, 100 user fingerprints ranging from ‚Äúuser fp0‚Äù to ‚Äúuser fp99‚Äù are embedded in the 100 watermark key samples respectively.\nIn the training phase, we train the LeNet-5 model for 50 epochs with the Adam  optimizer and train the VGG-16 model for 100 epochs with the SGD optimizer.\nThe initial learning rate and the momentum of the SGD optimizer are set to be 0.1 and 0.9, respectively.\nFor the two models, we set the batch size to be 128, and select the cross-entropy loss as the loss function. Metrics.\nTo evaluate the performance of the proposed watermarking method, we adopt the metrics as follows: Test accuracy:\naccuracy on the test set, which does not contain the watermark key samples. Watermark accuracy (WM accuracy):\nwe use the watermark accuracy  to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method on ownership verification.\nThe WM accuracy denotes DNN‚Äôs accuracy on the set of watermark key pairs Dw‚Äãmsubscriptùê∑ùë§ùëöD_{wm}.\nIn our settings, Dw‚Äãmsubscriptùê∑ùë§ùëöD_{wm} contains 100 watermark key samples. Average mean squared error:\nthe mean squared error (MSE)  is a widely used metric for evaluating the quality difference between two images.\nIt is calculated by the squared difference between pixel values of the original image and pixel values of the modified image.\nWe use the average MSE of 100 images to evaluate the impact of embedded user‚Äôs fingerprint on image quality. Fingerprint authentication success rate (FASR):\nwe define the fingerprint authentication success rate (FASR) to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method on user‚Äôs fingerprint authentication. Let NfsubscriptùëÅùëìN_{f} be the number of users‚Äô fingerprints successfully authenticated, and NùëÅN be the total number of users‚Äô fingerprints. The FASR is calculated by Nf/NsubscriptùëÅùëìùëÅN_{f}/N. In the experiment, the value of NùëÅN is 100.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: Datasets and models.\nWe evaluate the proposed watermarking method on two datasets (Fashion-MNIST  and CIFAR-10 ).\nFor the Fashion-MNIST dataset, we train the LeNet-5 [ref]13 model with 60,100 training images and 10,000 test images, where 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images are from the Fashion-MNIST dataset , and the other 100 training images are from\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
