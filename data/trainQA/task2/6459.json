      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Optimal Effective Resistance Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHere we outline our main algorithmic results pertaining to effective resistance sketching and estimation, and in Section 3 we describe some extensions of our work to broader linear algebraic problems involving SDD and PSD matrices. Our main algorithmic result is a new efficient effective resistance sketch for expanders, a term which is used to refer to graphs with Ω~​(1)~Ω1\\widetilde{\\Omega}(1)-expansion. For α>0𝛼0\\alpha>0, we say that a graph G=(V,E,w)𝐺𝑉𝐸𝑤G=(V,E,w) has α𝛼\\alpha-expansion if α≤ϕ​(G)𝛼italic-ϕ𝐺\\alpha\\leq\\phi(G), where ϕ​(G)italic-ϕ𝐺\\phi(G) denotes the conductance of G𝐺G and is defined as We say a graph is an expander if it has Ω~​(1)~Ω1\\widetilde{\\Omega}(1)-expansion. There is an (O~​(m​ϵ−1),O~​(1),O~​(n​ϵ−1))~𝑂𝑚superscriptitalic-ϵ1~𝑂1~𝑂𝑛superscriptitalic-ϵ1(\\widetilde{O}({m\\epsilon^{-1}}),\\widetilde{O}({1}),\\widetilde{O}({n\\epsilon^{-1}})) effective resistance sketch algorithm for expanders. Table 2 summarizes and compares our Theorem 1 to previous work on effective resistance sketches, including naive algorithms to explicitly compute the pseudoinverse of the Laplacian of G𝐺G, which can be computed in O​(nω)𝑂superscript𝑛𝜔O(n^{\\omega}) time using FMM or O~​(m​n)~𝑂𝑚𝑛\\widetilde{O}({mn}) time using a Laplacian system solver (labeled Solver).222ω≤n2.37188𝜔superscript𝑛2.37188\\omega\\leq n^{2.37188}  denotes the fast matrix multiplication constant.  A (𝒯s,𝒯q,s)subscript𝒯ssubscript𝒯q𝑠(\\mathcal{T}_{\\mathrm{s}},\\mathcal{T}_{\\mathrm{q}},s)\neffective-resistance sketch algorithm implies an O​(𝒯s+|S|​𝒯q)𝑂subscript𝒯s𝑆subscript𝒯qO(\\mathcal{T}_{\\mathrm{s}}+|S|\\mathcal{T}_{\\mathrm{q}}) algorithm for the effective resistance estimation problem. Hence, Theorem 1 implies the following. There is an O~​(m​ϵ−1+|S|)~𝑂𝑚superscriptitalic-ϵ1𝑆\\widetilde{O}({m\\epsilon^{-1}+|S|}) time algorithm which solves the effective resistance estimation problem for expanders whp. Effective resistance sketches are a common approach to solving the effective resistance estimation problem; but there are also approaches to the problem that do not explicitly construct effective resistance sketches. Table 2 summarizes prior work on effective resistance estimation more broadly. There has been a long line of research on the problem of computing sketches and sparsifiers of graph Laplacians  [ref]9 [ref]2  (i.e., computing a sparse graph G′superscript𝐺′G^{\\prime} such that quadratic forms in the Laplacian of G′superscript𝐺′G^{\\prime} approximate quadratic forms in the Laplacian of G𝐺G). Building on this work,  showed there is an algorithm which processes a graph G𝐺G on n𝑛n nodes and m𝑚m edges in O​(m1+o​(1))𝑂superscript𝑚1𝑜1O(m^{1+o(1)}) time and produces a sparse sketch graph H𝐻H with only O~​(n​ϵ−1)~𝑂𝑛superscriptitalic-ϵ1\\widetilde{O}({n\\epsilon^{-1}}) edges such that rG​(a,b)≈rH​(a,b)subscript𝑟𝐺𝑎𝑏subscript𝑟𝐻𝑎𝑏r_{G}(a,b)\\approx r_{H}(a,b) for all a,b∈V𝑎𝑏𝑉a,b\\in V. Consequently, any algorithm which runs in O~​(m​ϵ−c)~𝑂𝑚superscriptitalic-ϵ𝑐\\widetilde{O}({m\\epsilon^{-c}}) on expanders can be improved to run in O~​(m1+o​(1)+n​ϵ−(c+1))~𝑂superscript𝑚1𝑜1𝑛superscriptitalic-ϵ𝑐1\\widetilde{O}({m^{1+o(1)}+n\\epsilon^{-(c+1)}}) time on expanders simply by running the algorithm on H𝐻H instead of G𝐺G.  \n\nTable 1: Sketch\n\n\nMethod\n𝒯psubscript𝒯𝑝\\mathcal{T}_{p}\n𝒯qsubscript𝒯𝑞\\mathcal{T}_{q}\ns𝑠s\n\nFMM\nnωsuperscript𝑛𝜔n^{\\omega}\n111\nn2superscript𝑛2n^{2}\n\nSolver\nn​m𝑛𝑚nm\n111\nn2superscript𝑛2n^{2}\n\n[ref]9\nm​ϵ−2𝑚superscriptitalic-ϵ2m\\epsilon^{-2}\nϵ−2superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\epsilon^{-2}\nn​ϵ−2𝑛superscriptitalic-ϵ2n\\epsilon^{-2}\n\n[ref]2\nn2​ϵ−1superscript𝑛2superscriptitalic-ϵ1n^{2}\\epsilon^{-1}\n1\nn​ϵ−1𝑛superscriptitalic-ϵ1n\\epsilon^{-1}\n\n[ref]3\nm+n​ϵ−2𝑚𝑛superscriptitalic-ϵ2m+n\\epsilon^{-2}\n111\nn​ϵ−1𝑛superscriptitalic-ϵ1n\\epsilon^{-1}\n\nOurs\nm​ϵ−1𝑚superscriptitalic-ϵ1m\\epsilon^{-1}\n111\nn​ϵ−1𝑛superscriptitalic-ϵ1n\\epsilon^{-1}\n\n\n\nTable 2: Effective Resistance Estimation\n\n\nMethod\nRuntime\n \n\n\n \n\n\nRestriction\n\n\n\nFMM\nnω+|S|superscript𝑛𝜔𝑆n^{\\omega}+\\left|S\\right|\nNone\n\nSolver\nn​m+|S|𝑛𝑚𝑆nm+\\left|S\\right|\nNone\n\n[ref]9\nn2​ϵ−2superscript𝑛2superscriptitalic-ϵ2n^{2}\\epsilon^{-2}\nS=V×V𝑆𝑉𝑉S=V\\times V\n\n[ref]2\nn2​ϵ−1superscript𝑛2superscriptitalic-ϵ1n^{2}\\epsilon^{-1}\nS=V×V𝑆𝑉𝑉S=V\\times V\n\n\nm+(n+|S|)​ϵ−2𝑚𝑛𝑆superscriptitalic-ϵ2m+(n+\\left|S\\right|)\\epsilon^{-2}\nNone\n\n\nm+|S|​ϵ−2𝑚𝑆superscriptitalic-ϵ2m+\\left|S\\right|\\epsilon^{-2}\nNone\n\n\nm​ϵ−1.5𝑚superscriptitalic-ϵ1.5m\\epsilon^{-1.5}\nS=E𝑆𝐸S=E\n\n[ref]3\nm+n​ϵ−2+|S|𝑚𝑛superscriptitalic-ϵ2𝑆m+n\\epsilon^{-2}+\\left|S\\right|\nNone\n\nOurs\nm​ϵ−1+|S|𝑚superscriptitalic-ϵ1𝑆m\\epsilon^{-1}+\\left|S\\right|\nNone\n\n\n\n \n\nPrior work on Effective Resistance Sketches (Table 2) and Estimation (Table 2).
