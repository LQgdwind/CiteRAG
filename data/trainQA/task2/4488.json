      "content": "Paper Title: On Good 2-Query Locally Testable Codes from Sheaves on High Dimensional Expanders\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA locally testable code (LTC) is an error correcting code\nadmitting a randomized algorithm ‚Äî called a tester ‚Äî which, given access to a word,\ncan decide with high probability\nwhether it is close to a codeword or not\nby querying just a few\n(i.e.¬†O‚Äã(1)ùëÇ1O(1)) of its letters.\nMore formally, the tester must accept all codewords,\nand the probability of rejecting a word outside the code\nis at least proportional to its Hamming distance from the code.\nThus, upon transmitting a codeword along a noisy channel, the receiver can\nprobe just a few letters to assess whether the codeword\nwas significantly corrupted or not, and decide accordingly whether to\ndecode it, or ask for retransmission.\nThe probability of rejecting a word which is very far from the code\n(i.e.¬†of relative Hamming distance ‚â•Œ∑absentùúÇ\\geq\\eta)\nis the called (Œ∑ùúÇ\\eta-)soundness of the LTC. LTCs also play a major role in the construction of probabilistically\ncheckable proofs (PCPs), as almost all known PCPs include them as building blocks.\nThe length of such PCPs is related to various properties\nof the LTC, e.g., its distance, rate and the efficiency of the the testing;\nsee\n for a survey. A family of LTCs is called good if the codes in that family have constant rate and linear distance. A subclass of LTCs of particular importance is the 222-query LTCs,\ni.e., LTCs admitting a tester probing just two letters;\nthe alphabet size may be large.\nSuch LTCs admit an even stronger connection to PCPs, and also to the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC).\nHowever, they are also known to be\nsomewhat constrained.\nIndeed, by ,\nthere are no 222-query LTCs with linear distance\nand constant rate on a binary alphabet, and likewise\nfor linear\n222-query LTCs on any finite field alphabet.\nSee   for further restrictions. LTCs are generally difficult to construct for the reason that\nrandom low-density parity check (LDPC) codes are usually not locally\ntestable. Rather, the parity checks should be designed\nto admit redundancy. 222-query LTCs are even harder to come by. Some notable examples of LTCs include Reed‚ÄìMuller codes, which have\nlinear distance and polylogarithmic message length\n, ,\nand the LTCs of Ben-Sasson‚ÄìSudan \nand Dinur ,\nwhich have linear distance and inverse poly-logarithmic rate.\nIt was further studied how the group under which a code is invariant affects its local testability. With respect to that, it was shown that affine invariant codes with the so called ‚Äúsingle orbit‚Äù property are locally testable .\nDinur, Evra, Livne, Lubotzky and Mozes \nand Panteleev and Kalachev \nhave recently and independently of each other constructed infinite families of LTCs with\nconstant (large) query size, linear distance and constant rate.111\nAn earlier version of this paper was written and circulated independently of these works.\n\n(Panteleev and Kalachev also constructed good LDPC quantum codes in op.¬†cit.) The past decade had seen an emerging trend of using high-dimensional expanders for\nconstructing locally testable codes and other property testers,\ne.g.,\n,\n,\n,\n[ref]10,\n\nto name just a few.\nLoosely speaking, these\nworks share a common theme: one uses a 222-dimensional object, e.g., a 222-dimensional simplicial\ncomplex, or a 333-layer partially ordered set, in order\nto define a code. One then relates expansion properties of the object\nat hand to the testability of the code, making use of the 333 layers of the object\n(vertices, edges and triangles in the case of a simplicial complex).\nSee  for an aximatization\nof this approach. Despite the extensive research, so far,\nthe prototypical high dimensional expanders did\nnot give rise to LTCs with linear distance and constant rate.\nIt was particularly expected that\nthe Ramanujan complexes of Lubozky, Samuels and Vishne\n\n(see also Li [ref]36 and Sarveniazi ),\nwhich are often considered as the\nprototype of high dimensional expanders, should give rise to LTCs.\nFor comparison, the recent LTCs constructed in  and\n\nuse special square complexes, which do not seem to admit higher-dimensional\nanalogues.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: good LDPC quantum codes in op.¬†cit.)

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
