      "content": "Paper Title: Optimistic MLE—A Generic Model-based Algorithm for Partially Observable Sequential Decision Making\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWitness rank  was introduced as a structural parameter for measuring the difficulty of model-based RL.\n proved that the witness rank of a model class being small suffices to guarantee sample-efficient learning, and several RL settings of interest (e.g., factored MDPs) possess rather moderate witness rank.\nTo simplify notations, let 𝔻θ(sh,ah):=ℙθ((rh,sh+1)=⋅∣sh,ah)\\mathbb{D}_{\\theta}(s_{h},a_{h}):=\\mathbb{P}_{\\theta}((r_{h},s_{h+1})=\\cdot\\mid s_{h},a_{h}). And the witness rank is defined as following: We say model class ΘΘ\\Theta satisfies (d,κ,B)𝑑𝜅𝐵(d,\\kappa,B)-witness condition, if there exist two sets of mappings {fh}h∈[H]subscriptsubscript𝑓ℎℎdelimited-[]𝐻\\{f_{h}\\}_{h\\in[H]}, {gh}h∈[H]subscriptsubscript𝑔ℎℎdelimited-[]𝐻\\{g_{h}\\}_{h\\in[H]} from ΘΘ\\Theta to ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}, so that\nfor any θ,θ′∈Θ𝜃superscript𝜃′Θ\\theta,\\theta^{\\prime}\\in\\Theta and h∈[H]ℎdelimited-[]𝐻h\\in[H]: where ν𝜈\\nu is typically chosen as πθsubscript𝜋𝜃\\pi_{\\theta} (Q-type) or πθ′subscript𝜋superscript𝜃′\\pi_{\\theta^{\\prime}} (V-type). The Q-type witness condition requires that at each single step the expected model discrepancy between the true model θ⋆superscript𝜃⋆\\theta^{\\star} and model candidate θ′superscript𝜃′\\theta^{\\prime} under the state-action distribution induced by the optimal policy of θ𝜃\\theta is roughly proportional to the inner product of the features of θ𝜃\\theta and θ′superscript𝜃′\\theta^{\\prime}.\nAnd the V-type version is defined similarly except that the last action ahsubscript𝑎ℎa_{h} is sampled from πθ′subscript𝜋superscript𝜃′\\pi_{\\theta^{\\prime}} instead of πθsubscript𝜋𝜃\\pi_{\\theta}.\nBy basic algebra, we can easily relate the above per-step model discrepancy in witness condition to the whole-trajectory model discrepancy in SAIL condition, which leads to the following conclusion that the SAIL condition is satisfied with almost the same (d,κ,B)𝑑𝜅𝐵(d,\\kappa,B) whenever either Q-type or V-type witness condition holds. For any model class ΘΘ\\Theta, we always have Q-type (d,κ,B)𝑑𝜅𝐵(d,\\kappa,B)-witness condition implies\n(d,2​κ,B)𝑑2𝜅𝐵(d,2\\kappa,B)-SAIL condition with Πexp​(π)={π}subscriptΠexp𝜋𝜋\\Pi_{\\rm exp}(\\pi)=\\{\\pi\\}, and m=n=1𝑚𝑛1m=n=1. V-type (d,κ,B)𝑑𝜅𝐵(d,\\kappa,B)-witness condition implies\n(d,2​A​κ,B)𝑑2𝐴𝜅𝐵(d,2A\\kappa,B)-SAIL condition with Πexp​(π)={π1:h∘Uniform​(𝒜):h∈[0,H−1]}subscriptΠexp𝜋conditional-setsubscript𝜋:1ℎUniform𝒜ℎ0𝐻1\\Pi_{\\rm exp}(\\pi)=\\{\\pi_{1:h}\\circ{\\rm Uniform}(\\mathscr{A}):~{}h\\in[0,H-1]\\}, and m=n=1𝑚𝑛1m=n=1. In the case when log⁡𝒩Θsubscript𝒩Θ\\log\\mathcal{N}_{\\Theta} grows polylogarithmically with respect to the covering precision, by plugging Proposition 6.7 back into Theorem 6.4, we immediately obtain a 𝒪~​(A2​κ2​d​log⁡𝒩Θ​(ε−1)​ε−2)~𝒪superscript𝐴2superscript𝜅2𝑑subscript𝒩Θsuperscript𝜀1superscript𝜀2\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(A^{2}\\kappa^{2}d\\log\\mathcal{N}_{\\Theta}(\\varepsilon^{-1})\\varepsilon^{-2}) sample complexity upper bound for OMLE in the V-type witness rank setting, which improves over the quadratic dependence on d𝑑d in . Moreover, OMLE  further enjoys a 𝒪~​(κ​d​log⁡𝒩Θ​(K−1)​K)~𝒪𝜅𝑑subscript𝒩Θsuperscript𝐾1𝐾\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\kappa\\sqrt{d\\log\\mathcal{N}_{\\Theta}(K^{-1})K}) regret guarantee in the Q-type witness rank setting, which is new to our knowledge. In factored MDPs, the state admits a factored structure. Concretely, each state s𝑠s consists of m𝑚m factors denoted as (s​,…,s​[m])∈𝒳m𝑠delimited-[]1…𝑠delimited-[]𝑚superscript𝒳𝑚(s,\\ldots,s[m])\\in\\mathcal{X}^{m}.\nMoreover, each factor i∈[m]𝑖delimited-[]𝑚i\\in[m] has a parent set denoted by pai⊆[m]subscriptpa𝑖delimited-[]𝑚{\\rm{pa}}_{i}\\subseteq[m], with respect to which the transition admits the following factorized form: In other words, the transition of the ithsuperscript𝑖thi^{\\rm th} factor of states are only determined by a subset of all factors, that is paisubscriptpa𝑖{\\rm{pa}}_{i}, instead of the whole state.\nIn factored MDPs, it is standard to assume the factorization structure and the reward function are known [ref]31 .\nTherefore, our model class ΘΘ\\Theta only needs to parameterize the transitions under the given factorization structure. The following proposition states that when the factorization structure is known, factored MDPs admit low witness rank structure. Let ΘΘ\\Theta consist of all the factored MDPs with the same factorization structure {pai}i=1msuperscriptsubscriptsubscriptpa𝑖𝑖1𝑚\\{{\\rm{pa}}_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{m}. Then ΘΘ\\Theta satisfies Q-type witness condition with\nd=A​∑i=1m|𝒳||pai|𝑑𝐴superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑚superscript𝒳subscriptpa𝑖d=A\\sum_{i=1}^{m}|\\mathcal{X}|^{|{\\rm{pa}}_{i}|}, κ=m𝜅𝑚\\kappa=m, and B=∑i=1m|𝒳||pai|𝐵superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑚superscript𝒳subscriptpa𝑖B=\\sum_{i=1}^{m}|\\mathcal{X}|^{|{\\rm{pa}}_{i}|}. In kernel linear MDPs [ref]55, the transition functions can be represented as a linear functions of the tensor product of two known feature mappings.\nFormally, the learner is provided with features ϕ:𝒮×𝒜→ℝdlin:italic-ϕ→𝒮𝒜superscriptℝsubscript𝑑lin\\phi:\\mathscr{S}\\times\\mathscr{A}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\rm lin}} and ψ:𝒮→ℝdlin:𝜓→𝒮superscriptℝsubscript𝑑lin\\psi:\\mathscr{S}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\rm lin}} so that for any h∈[H]ℎdelimited-[]𝐻h\\in[H], there exists 𝐖h∈ℝdlin×dlinsubscript𝐖ℎsuperscriptℝsubscript𝑑linsubscript𝑑lin\\mathbf{W}_{h}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{{d_{\\rm lin}}\\times{d_{\\rm lin}}} satisfying ℙh​(sh+1∣sh,ah)=ϕ​(sh,ah)⊤​𝐖h​ψ​(sh+1)subscriptℙℎconditionalsubscript𝑠ℎ1subscript𝑠ℎsubscript𝑎ℎitalic-ϕsuperscriptsubscript𝑠ℎsubscript𝑎ℎtopsubscript𝐖ℎ𝜓subscript𝑠ℎ1\\mathbb{P}_{h}(s_{h+1}\\mid s_{h},a_{h})=\\phi(s_{h},a_{h})^{\\top}\\mathbf{W}_{h}\\psi(s_{h+1}) for all (sh,ah,sh+1)∈𝒮×𝒜×𝒮subscript𝑠ℎsubscript𝑎ℎsubscript𝑠ℎ1𝒮𝒜𝒮(s_{h},a_{h},s_{h+1})\\in\\mathscr{S}\\times\\mathscr{A}\\times\\mathscr{S}. Besides, kernel linear MDPs satisfy the normalization condition:\n(a) ‖ϕ​(sh,ah)‖2≤Cϕsubscriptnormitalic-ϕsubscript𝑠ℎsubscript𝑎ℎ2subscript𝐶italic-ϕ\\|\\phi(s_{h},a_{h})\\|_{2}\\leq C_{\\phi} for all (sh,ah)subscript𝑠ℎsubscript𝑎ℎ(s_{h},a_{h}),\n(b) ‖∑sh+1ψ​(sh+1)​f​(sh+1)‖1≤Cψsubscriptnormsubscriptsubscript𝑠ℎ1𝜓subscript𝑠ℎ1𝑓subscript𝑠ℎ11subscript𝐶𝜓\\|\\sum_{s_{h+1}}\\psi(s_{h+1})f(s_{h+1})\\|_{1}\\leq C_{\\psi} for all ‖f‖∞≤1subscriptnorm𝑓1\\|f\\|_{\\infty}\\leq 1, and (c) ‖𝐖h‖2≤CWsubscriptnormsubscript𝐖ℎ2subscript𝐶𝑊\\|\\mathbf{W}_{h}\\|_{2}\\leq C_{W}. For simplicity, we assume the reward function is known.\nPrevious works [e.g., 55] have shown that kernel linear MDPs are capable of representing various examples with moderate dimension dlinsubscript𝑑lin{d_{\\rm lin}}, e.g., tabular MDPs with dlin=S​Asubscript𝑑lin𝑆𝐴{d_{\\rm lin}}=SA. The following proposition states that kernel linear MDPs also fall into the low witness rank framework with the same ambient dimension. Let ΘΘ\\Theta be the family of dlinsubscript𝑑lin{d_{\\rm lin}}-dimensional kernel linear MDPs. Then ΘΘ\\Theta satisfies V-type witness condition with d=dlin𝑑subscript𝑑lind={d_{\\rm lin}}, κ=1𝜅1\\kappa=1, and B=2​(dlin​Cϕ​CW​Cψ+1)𝐵2subscript𝑑linsubscript𝐶italic-ϕsubscript𝐶𝑊subscript𝐶𝜓1B=2(\\sqrt{{d_{\\rm lin}}}C_{\\phi}C_{W}C_{\\psi}+1). In sparse linear bandits, the mean reward function can be represented as a sparse linear function of the arm feature. Formally, we have Rθ​(a)=⟨a,θ⟩subscript𝑅𝜃𝑎𝑎𝜃R_{\\theta}(a)=\\langle a,\\theta\\rangle where (i) a∈𝒜⊆BC𝒜dlin​(0)𝑎𝒜subscriptsuperscript𝐵subscript𝑑linsubscript𝐶𝒜0a\\in\\mathscr{A}\\subseteq B^{d_{\\rm lin}}_{C_{\\mathscr{A}}}(0), (ii) Θ:={θ∈BCΘdlin​(0):‖θ‖0≤m​ and ​⟨θ,a⟩∈[ref]0 ​ for any ​a∈𝒜}assignΘconditional-set𝜃subscriptsuperscript𝐵subscript𝑑linsubscript𝐶Θ0subscriptnorm𝜃0𝑚 and 𝜃𝑎01 for any 𝑎𝒜\\Theta:=\\{\\theta\\in B^{d_{\\rm lin}}_{C_{\\Theta}}(0):~{}\\|\\theta\\|_{0}\\leq m\\text{ and }\\langle\\theta,a\\rangle\\in[ref]0 \\text{ for any }a\\in\\mathscr{A}\\}. Without loss of generality, assume the stochastic reward feedback is binary999If the reward feedback r^^𝑟\\hat{r} is a real number in [ref]0 01[ref]0 , we can binarize it by sampling x𝑥x from Bernoulli​(r^)Bernoulli^𝑟{\\rm Bernoulli}(\\hat{r}) and then using x𝑥x as the reward feedback instead. Such modification will not change the mean reward..\nThe following proposition states that the witness rank of sparse linear bandits is no larger than the ambient dimension dlinsubscript𝑑lin{d_{\\rm lin}}. Let ΘΘ\\Theta be the family of dlinsubscript𝑑lin{d_{\\rm lin}}-dimensional m𝑚m-sparse linear bandit. Then ΘΘ\\Theta satisfies Q-type witness condition with d=dlin𝑑subscript𝑑lind={d_{\\rm lin}}, κ=1𝜅1\\kappa=1, and B=4​dlin​CΘ​C𝒜𝐵4subscript𝑑linsubscript𝐶Θsubscript𝐶𝒜B=4\\sqrt{{d_{\\rm lin}}}C_{\\Theta}C_{\\mathscr{A}}. By combining Proposition 6.10 with Proposition 6.7 and 6.4, we recover the optimal regret for sparse linear bandits 𝒪~​(m​dlin​K)~𝒪𝑚subscript𝑑lin𝐾\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{m{d_{\\rm lin}}K}) up to a polylogarithmic factor.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: by a subset of all factors, that is paisubscriptpa𝑖{\\rm{pa}}_{i}, instead of the whole state.\nIn factored MDPs, it is standard to assume the factorization structure and the reward function are known [ref]31 .\nTherefore, our model class ΘΘ\\Theta only needs to parameterize the transitions under the given factorization structure.
