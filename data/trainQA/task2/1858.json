      "content": "Paper Title: Active learning for medical code assignment\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSome approaches have been proposed to support automatically assign the ICD-9 codes using clinical notes of MIMIC-II and MIMIC-III, in which deep learning proves to be the most efficient technique    . Initially, machine learning methods were applied to tackle the assignment of ICD-9 codes, in which the use of hierarchical and flat Support Vector Machines (SVM) for MIMIC-II database was proposed by Perotte et al. , who concluded that the hierarchical nature of ICD-9 codes improves the multi-label classification. In sequence, deep recurrent networks outperform other machine learning methods applied in this context as provided by , whose results indicate that recurrent networks capture better information as vector representations. Also, the authors claimed that a better study of the medical vocabulary could improve the assignment of ICD-9 codes. Therefore, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) started to be applied in literature, improving the results in the medical domain   . In this context, the DeepLabeler, proposed by Li\net al. , is composed of a CNN with doc2vec, showing that the convolution operation was the most effective component. Therefore, researchers started to include different operations in the CNN, such as attention mechanism and dilated convolutions, in order to improve the predictions   . To provide a benchmark for the prediction of ICD-9 codes in the MIMIC-III database, deep learning, and machine learning methods were evaluated by Huang\net al. , who analyzed different combinations between two vectorization methods and six different classifiers. In summary, all these approaches require a large amount of labeled data to ensure effective learning of the machine and deep learning models [ref]39. However, code assignment of clinical notes is performed manually, which is expensive, time-consuming, and inefficient. Thus, two potential strategies for dealing with a small and/or imbalanced training set: i) semi-supervised learning, which considers the data distribution for propagating label information through neighboring samples; and ii) Active Learning (AL), which selects the most informative samples for a human agent to label next based on given criteria . In the medical domain, it is essential to include the domain expert (e.g., medical coder) in the process in order to provide a more accurate coding of the clinical notes. This approach motivates the use of Human-in-Loop strategies, which can be combined with AL methods, once the specialist can provide the labels of the most informative samples selected   [ref]18. The selection of the most informative samples can reduce the manual cost to label the samples and also provide a good representation of the data distribution, supporting the classifier model to achieve a useful generalization, leading to less complex structures  . In this context, a survey about AL for named entity recognition in clinical text was provided by Chen\net al. , in which they confirm that AL methods reduce the annotation cost for each sentence. Such reduction was also confirmed by other researchers, whose evaluated AL methods in different tasks, such as classification of clinical text, identification of possible personally identifiable or sensitive sentences, and identification of breast cancer   . In summary, the models combined with AL methods reduced around 60%percent6060\\% of labeled documents required to provide satisfactory results, and 35%percent3535\\% of annotation time performed by a specialist  . The sample selection is typically conducted based on an acquisition function that measures the uncertainty of the model when predicting unlabeled samples    . If the model produces a high uncertainty for a particular instance, it means that the model has not enough knowledge to classify that instance, concluding that such an instance is good to incorporate in the training set . Thus, the design of the acquisition function to evaluate the most informative samples to be labeled is the main challenge in the AL field. However, depending on the domain, an issue with the uncertainty metrics is that noise and outliers can be selected, jeopardizing the learning process of the model. Therefore, another strategy to select the most informative samples is to apply feature correlation derived from the semi-supervised learning algorithms. Thus, the idea is that grouping the samples based on their similarities can support the selection of a representative instance for a subset of samples, avoiding outliers instances . In the case of deep learning algorithm, some other approaches were developed. For instance, the Learning Loss AL includes a loss prediction module in the learning model to predict the loss of unlabeled samples Yoo and Kweon 3. Another DL technique is the Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD) developed by Houlsby et al. [ref]19. Some studies concluded that BALD does not perform well with an imbalanced test set and in the first few samples [ref]19 . Finally, in the medical domain, a deep learning algorithm combined with AL strategies was applied to tackle the problem of medical symptoms recognition from patient text by Mottaghi et al. , whose employed clustering methods, selecting the samples closest to the centroid. They conclude that such a strategy can balance the training set, selecting equally samples associated with different labels. In this context, to the best of our knowledge, AL strategies applied in the medical domain for coding assignment have not been deeply explored, motivating this study to evaluate the performance of common AL strategies combined with well-known classifiers applied in MIMIC-III dataset.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: two vectorization methods and six different classifiers.
