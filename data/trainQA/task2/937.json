In the original definition given by¬†, every sub-program in a strict-interval ABP PùëÉP is defined on a œÄùúã\\pi-interval of variables for some order œÄùúã\\pi, however, without loss of generality, we assume œÄùúã\\pi to be the identity permutation on nùëõn variables. Therefore, an interval of variables [i,j],i<jùëñùëóùëñùëó[i,j],\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ i<j here is the set {xi,‚Ä¶,xj}subscriptùë•ùëñ‚Ä¶subscriptùë•ùëó\\{x_{i},\\ldots,x_{j}\\}. In this section we show that strict-interval ABPs are equivalent to ROABPs upto a polynomial blow-up in size. The class of strict-interval ABPs is equivalent to the class of ROABPs. The proof of Theorem¬†5.1 involves a crucial observation that in a strict-interval ABP, variables are read in at most two orders and the nodes that correspond to paths that read in different orders can be isolated. We start with some observations on intervals in [1,n]1ùëõ[1,n] and the intervals involved in a strict interval ABP. Let PùëÉP be a strict-interval ABP over the variables X={x1,‚Ä¶,xn}ùëãsubscriptùë•1‚Ä¶subscriptùë•ùëõX=\\{x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}\\}. For any two nodes uùë¢u and vùë£v in PùëÉP, let Iu,vsubscriptùêºùë¢ùë£I_{u,v} be the interval of variables associated with the sub-program of PùëÉP with uùë¢u as the start node and vùë£v as the terminal node. For two intervals I=[a,b],J=[c,d]formulae-sequenceùêºùëéùëèùêΩùëêùëëI=[a,b],J=[c,d] in [1,n]1ùëõ[1,n], we say I‚™ØJprecedes-or-equalsùêºùêΩI\\preceq J, if b‚â§cùëèùëêb\\leq c. Note that any two intervals IùêºI and JùêΩJ in [1,n]1ùëõ[1,n] are comparable under ‚™Øprecedes-or-equals\\preceq if and only if either they are disjoint or the largest element in one of the intervals is the smallest element in the other. This defines a natural transitive relation on the set of all intervals in [1,n]1ùëõ[1,n].\nThe following is a useful property of ‚™Øprecedes-or-equals\\preceq: Let I,JùêºùêΩI,J and J‚Ä≤superscriptùêΩ‚Ä≤J^{\\prime} be intervals over [1,n]1ùëõ[1,n] such that I‚™ØJprecedes-or-equalsùêºùêΩI\\preceq J and J‚Ä≤‚äÜJsuperscriptùêΩ‚Ä≤ùêΩJ^{\\prime}\\subseteq J. Then I‚™ØJ‚Ä≤precedes-or-equalsùêºsuperscriptùêΩ‚Ä≤I\\preceq J^{\\prime}. Let I=[a,b],J=[c,d]formulae-sequenceùêºùëéùëèùêΩùëêùëëI=[a,b],J=[c,d] and J‚Ä≤=[c‚Ä≤,d‚Ä≤]superscriptùêΩ‚Ä≤superscriptùëê‚Ä≤superscriptùëë‚Ä≤J^{\\prime}=[c^{\\prime},d^{\\prime}]. As I‚™ØJprecedes-or-equalsùêºùêΩI\\preceq J, we have b‚â§cùëèùëêb\\leq c. Further, since J‚Ä≤‚äÜJsuperscriptùêΩ‚Ä≤ùêΩJ^{\\prime}\\subseteq J, we have c‚â§c‚Ä≤ùëêsuperscriptùëê‚Ä≤c\\leq c^{\\prime} and d‚Ä≤‚â§dsuperscriptùëë‚Ä≤ùëëd^{\\prime}\\leq d. Therefore, b‚â§c‚Ä≤ùëèsuperscriptùëê‚Ä≤b\\leq c^{\\prime} and hence I‚™ØJ‚Ä≤precedes-or-equalsùêºsuperscriptùêΩ‚Ä≤I\\preceq J^{\\prime}. We begin with an observation on the structure of intervals of the sub-programs of PùëÉP.\nLet vùë£v be a node in PùëÉP. We say vùë£v is an ascending node, if Is,v‚™ØIv,tprecedes-or-equalssubscriptùêºùë†ùë£subscriptùêºùë£ùë°I_{s,v}\\preceq I_{v,t} and a descending node if Iv,t‚™ØIs,vprecedes-or-equalssubscriptùêºùë£ùë°subscriptùêºùë†ùë£I_{v,t}\\preceq I_{s,v}. Let PùëÉP be a strict-interval ABP and vùë£v any node in PùëÉP. Then, vùë£v is either ascending or descending and not both. Let I=Is,vùêºsubscriptùêºùë†ùë£I=I_{s,v} and J=Iv,tùêΩsubscriptùêºùë£ùë°J=I_{v,t}. Since PùëÉP is a strict-interval ABP, the intervals IùêºI and JùêΩJ are disjoint and hence either I‚™ØJprecedes-or-equalsùêºùêΩI\\preceq J or J‚™ØIprecedes-or-equalsùêΩùêºJ\\preceq I as required. Consider any sùë†s to tùë°t path œÅùúå\\rho in PùëÉP. We say that œÅùúå\\rho is ascending if every node in œÅùúå\\rho except sùë†s and tùë°t is ascending. Similarly, œÅùúå\\rho is called descending if every node in œÅùúå\\rho except sùë†s and tùë°t is descending. Let PùëÉP be a strict interval ABP and let œÅùúå\\rho any sùë†s to tùë°t path in PùëÉP. Then either œÅùúå\\rho is ascending or descending. We prove that no sùë†s to tùë°t path in PùëÉP can have both ascending and descending nodes. For the sake of contradiction, suppose that œÅùúå\\rho has both ascending and descending nodes. There are two cases. In the first, there is an edge (u,v)ùë¢ùë£(u,v) in œÅùúå\\rho such that uùë¢u is an ascending node and vùë£v is a descending node. Let I=Is,u,J=Iu,t,I‚Ä≤=Is,vformulae-sequenceùêºsubscriptùêºùë†ùë¢formulae-sequenceùêΩsubscriptùêºùë¢ùë°superscriptùêº‚Ä≤subscriptùêºùë†ùë£I=I_{s,u},J=I_{u,t},I^{\\prime}=I_{s,v} and J‚Ä≤=Iv,tsuperscriptùêΩ‚Ä≤subscriptùêºùë£ùë°J^{\\prime}=I_{v,t}.\nSince Ps,usubscriptùëÉùë†ùë¢P_{s,u} is a sub-program of Ps,vsubscriptùëÉùë†ùë£P_{s,v}, we have I‚äÜI‚Ä≤ùêºsuperscriptùêº‚Ä≤I\\subseteq I^{\\prime}, similarly J‚Ä≤‚äÜJsuperscriptùêΩ‚Ä≤ùêΩJ^{\\prime}\\subseteq J. By the assumption, we have I‚™ØJprecedes-or-equalsùêºùêΩI\\preceq J and J‚Ä≤‚™ØI‚Ä≤precedes-or-equalssuperscriptùêΩ‚Ä≤superscriptùêº‚Ä≤J^{\\prime}\\preceq I^{\\prime}. By Observation¬†2, we have I‚™ØJ‚Ä≤precedes-or-equalsùêºsuperscriptùêΩ‚Ä≤I\\preceq J^{\\prime} and J‚Ä≤‚™ØI‚Ä≤precedes-or-equalssuperscriptùêΩ‚Ä≤superscriptùêº‚Ä≤J^{\\prime}\\preceq I^{\\prime}. By transitivity, we have I‚™ØI‚Ä≤precedes-or-equalsùêºsuperscriptùêº‚Ä≤I\\preceq I^{\\prime}. However, by the definition of ‚™Øprecedes-or-equals\\preceq, IùêºI and I‚Ä≤superscriptùêº‚Ä≤I^{\\prime} are incomparable, which is a contradiction. The second possibility is uùë¢u being a descending node and vùë£v being an ascending node. In this case, J‚™ØIprecedes-or-equalsùêΩùêºJ\\preceq I and I‚Ä≤‚™ØJ‚Ä≤precedes-or-equalssuperscriptùêº‚Ä≤superscriptùêΩ‚Ä≤I^{\\prime}\\preceq J^{\\prime}. Then, by Observation¬†2, we have J‚Ä≤‚™ØIprecedes-or-equalssuperscriptùêΩ‚Ä≤ùêºJ^{\\prime}\\preceq I as J‚Ä≤‚äÜJsuperscriptùêΩ‚Ä≤ùêΩJ^{\\prime}\\subseteq J. Therefore, J‚™ØJ‚Ä≤precedes-or-equalsùêΩsuperscriptùêΩ‚Ä≤J\\preceq J^{\\prime} by the transitivity of ‚™Øprecedes-or-equals\\preceq, a contradiction. This completes the proof. Lemma¬†5.4 implies that the set of all non-terminal nodes of PùëÉP can be partitioned into two sets such that there is no edge from one set to the other. Formally: Let PùëÉP be an interval ABP. There exist two strict-interval ABPs P1subscriptùëÉ1P_{1} and P2subscriptùëÉ2P_{2} such that All non-terminal nodes of P1subscriptùëÉ1P_{1} are ascending nodes and all non-terminal nodes of P2subscriptùëÉ2P_{2} are descending nodes; and P=P1+P2ùëÉsubscriptùëÉ1subscriptùëÉ2P=P_{1}+P_{2}. Let P1subscriptùëÉ1P_{1} be the sub-program of PùëÉP obtained by removing all descending nodes from PùëÉP and P2subscriptùëÉ2P_{2} be the sub-program of PùëÉP obtained by removing all ascending nodes in PùëÉP. By Lemma¬†5.4, the non-terminal nodes in P1subscriptùëÉ1P_{1} and P2subscriptùëÉ2P_{2} are disjoint and every sùë†s to tùë°t path œÅùúå\\rho in PùëÉP is either a sùë†s to tùë°t path in P1subscriptùëÉ1P_{1} or a sùë†s to tùë°t path in P2subscriptùëÉ2P_{2} but not both. Thus P=P1+P2ùëÉsubscriptùëÉ1subscriptùëÉ2P=P_{1}+P_{2}. Next we show that any strict-interval ABP consisting only of ascending or only of descending nodes can in fact be converted into an ROABP. Let PùëÉP be a strict-interval ABP consisting only of ascending nodes or only of descending nodes. Then the polynomial computed by PùëÉP can also be computed by a ROABP P‚Ä≤superscriptùëÉ‚Ä≤P^{\\prime} of size polynomial in ùóåùóÇùóìùñæ‚Äã(P)ùóåùóÇùóìùñæùëÉ{\\sf size}(P). The order of variables in P‚Ä≤superscriptùëÉ‚Ä≤P^{\\prime} is x1,‚Ä¶,xnsubscriptùë•1‚Ä¶subscriptùë•ùëõx_{1},\\dots,x_{n} if PùëÉP has only ascending nodes and xn,‚Ä¶,x1subscriptùë•ùëõ‚Ä¶subscriptùë•1x_{n},\\ldots,x_{1} if PùëÉP has only descending nodes. We consider the case when all non-terminal nodes of PùëÉP are ascending nodes. Let œÅùúå\\rho be any sùë†s to tùë°t path in PùëÉP. We claim that the edge labels in œÅùúå\\rho are according to the order x1,‚Ä¶,xn.subscriptùë•1‚Ä¶subscriptùë•ùëõx_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}. Suppose that there are edges (u,v)ùë¢ùë£(u,v) and (u‚Ä≤,v‚Ä≤)superscriptùë¢‚Ä≤superscriptùë£‚Ä≤(u^{\\prime},v^{\\prime}) occurring in that order in œÅùúå\\rho such that (u,v)ùë¢ùë£(u,v) is labelled by xisubscriptùë•ùëñx_{i} and (u‚Ä≤,v‚Ä≤)superscriptùë¢‚Ä≤superscriptùë£‚Ä≤(u^{\\prime},v^{\\prime}) is labelled by xjsubscriptùë•ùëóx_{j} with j<iùëóùëñj<i. Let I‚Ä≤=Is,u‚Ä≤superscriptùêº‚Ä≤subscriptùêºùë†superscriptùë¢‚Ä≤I^{\\prime}=I_{s,u^{\\prime}} and J‚Ä≤=Iu‚Ä≤,tsuperscriptùêΩ‚Ä≤subscriptùêºsuperscriptùë¢‚Ä≤ùë°J^{\\prime}=I_{u^{\\prime},t}. Since i‚ààI‚Ä≤ùëñsuperscriptùêº‚Ä≤i\\in I^{\\prime}, j‚ààJ‚Ä≤ùëósuperscriptùêΩ‚Ä≤j\\in J^{\\prime} and I‚Ä≤‚à©J‚Ä≤=‚àÖsuperscriptùêº‚Ä≤superscriptùêΩ‚Ä≤I^{\\prime}\\cap J^{\\prime}=\\emptyset, it must be the case that J‚Ä≤‚™ØI‚Ä≤precedes-or-equalssuperscriptùêΩ‚Ä≤superscriptùêº‚Ä≤J^{\\prime}\\preceq I^{\\prime} and hence u‚Ä≤superscriptùë¢‚Ä≤u^{\\prime} must be a descending node, a contradiction. This establishes that PùëÉP is an one ordered ABP. By the equivalence between one ordered ABPs and ROABPs (, ), we conclude that the polynomial computed by PùëÉP can also be computed by a ROABP of size polynomial in the size of PùëÉP. The argument is similar when all non-terminal nodes of PùëÉP are descending. In this case, we have i<jùëñùëói<j in the above argument and hence I‚Ä≤‚™ØJ‚Ä≤precedes-or-equalssuperscriptùêº‚Ä≤superscriptùêΩ‚Ä≤I^{\\prime}\\preceq J^{\\prime}, making u‚Ä≤superscriptùë¢‚Ä≤u^{\\prime} an ascending node leading to a contradiction. This concludes the proof. A permutation œÄùúã\\pi of [1,n]1ùëõ[1,n] naturally induces the order xœÄ‚Äã(1),‚Ä¶,xœÄ‚Äã(n)subscriptùë•ùúã1‚Ä¶subscriptùë•ùúãùëõx_{\\pi(1)},\\ldots,x_{\\pi(n)}. The reverse of œÄùúã\\pi is the order xœÄ‚Äã(n),xœÄ‚Äã(n‚àí1),‚Ä¶,xœÄ‚Äã(1)subscriptùë•ùúãùëõsubscriptùë•ùúãùëõ1‚Ä¶subscriptùë•ùúã1x_{\\pi(n)},x_{\\pi(n-1)},\\ldots,x_{\\pi(1)}. Since branching programs are layered, any multilinear polynomial computed by a ROABP where variables occur in the order given by œÄùúã\\pi can also be computed by a ROABP where variables occur in the reverse of œÄùúã\\pi. Let PùëÉP be a ROABP where variables occur in the order induced by a permutation œÄùúã\\pi. The polynomial computed by PùëÉP can also be computed by a ROABP of same size as PùëÉP that reads variables in the reverse order corresponding to œÄùúã\\pi. Let P‚Ä≤superscriptùëÉ‚Ä≤P^{\\prime} be the ROABP obtained by reversing the edges of PùëÉP and swapping the start and terminal nodes. Since PùëÉP is a layered DAG, there is a bijection between the set of all sùë†s to tùë°t paths in PùëÉP and the set of all sùë†s to tùë°t paths in P‚Ä≤superscriptùëÉ‚Ä≤P^{\\prime}, where the order of occurrence of nodes and hence the edge labels are reversed. This completes the proof. The above observations immediately establish Theorem¬†5.1. Let PùëÉP be a strict-interval ABP of size SùëÜS computing a multilinear polynomial fùëìf. By Lemma¬†5.6 there are strict interval ABPs P1subscriptùëÉ1P_{1} and P2subscriptùëÉ2P_{2} such that P1subscriptùëÉ1P_{1} has only ascending non-terminal nodes and P2subscriptùëÉ2P_{2} has only descending non-terminal nodes such that f=f1+f2ùëìsubscriptùëì1subscriptùëì2f=f_{1}+f_{2} where fisubscriptùëìùëñf_{i} is the polynomial computed by PisubscriptùëÉùëñP_{i}, i‚àà{1,2}ùëñ12i\\in\\{1,2\\}. By Lemma¬†5.8 and Observation¬†4, f1subscriptùëì1f_{1} and f2subscriptùëì2f_{2} can be computed by a ROABPs that read the variables in the order x1,‚Ä¶,xnsubscriptùë•1‚Ä¶subscriptùë•ùëõx_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}. Then f1+f2subscriptùëì1subscriptùëì2f_{1}+f_{2} can also be computed by an ROABP.\nIt remains to bound the size of the resulting ROABP. Note that ùóåùóÇùóìùñæ‚Äã(Pi)‚â§SùóåùóÇùóìùñæsubscriptùëÉùëñùëÜ{\\sf size}(P_{i})\\leq S. A ROABP for fisubscriptùëìùëñf_{i} can be obtained by staggering the reads of PisubscriptùëÉùëñP_{i} which blows up the size of the ABP by a factor of nùëõn (, ). Therefore size of the resulting ROABP is at most 2‚Äãn‚ÄãS‚â§O‚Äã(S2)2ùëõùëÜùëÇsuperscriptùëÜ22nS\\leq O(S^{2}). Using Theorem¬†5.1, we can design the following white-box PIT for strict-interval ABPs. Given a strict-interval ABP PùëÉP of size sùë†s, we can check whether the polynomial computed by PùëÉP is identically zero in time O‚Äã(poly‚Äã(S))ùëÇpolyùëÜO(\\text{poly}(S)). The proof follows from Theorem¬†5.1 and the polynomial time white-box PIT algorithm given by  for non-commutative ABPs, since the variables in XùëãX are read only once, in a fixed order, in a ROABP. The notion of intervals of variables corresponding to every sub-program can be applied to formulas in the form of Interval Formulas, where every sub-formula corresponds to an interval. In the following section we explore how such a model can be used to generalize the model of ROFs, and in what ways it differs from ROFs.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: A strict-interval ABP, defined in  (See Definition ¬†2.1), is a restriction of the notion of interval ABPs introduced by [ref]4.
