      "content": "Paper Title: SBERT-WK: A Sentence Embedding Method by Dissecting BERT-based Word Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTraditional word embedding methods provide a static representation for a\nword in a vocabulary set. Although the static representation is widely\nadopted in NLP, it has several limitations in modeling the context\ninformation. First, it cannot deal with polysemy. Second, it cannot\nadjust the meaning of a word based on its contexts. To address the\nshortcomings of static word embedding methods, there is a new trend to\ngo from shallow to deep contextualized representations. For example,\nELMo [ref]4, GPT  and BERT [ref]5\nare pre-trained deep neural language models, and they can be fine-tuned\non specific tasks. These new word embedding methods achieve impressive\nperformance on a wide range of NLP tasks. In particular, the BERT-based\nmodels are dominating in leaderboards of language understanding tasks\nsuch as SQuAD2.0 [ref]12 and GLUE benchmarks . ELMo is one of the earlier work in applying a pre-trained language model\nto downstream tasks [ref]4. It employs two layer bi-directional\nLSTM and fuses features from all LSTM outputs using task-specific\nweights. OpenAI GPT  incorporates a fine-tuning process when\nit is applied to downstream tasks. Task-specific parameters are\nintroduced and fine-tuned with all pre-trained parameters. BERT employs\nthe Transformer architecture , which is composed by\nmultiple multi-head attention layers. It can be trained more efficiently\nthan LSTM. It is trained on a large unlabeled corpus with several\nobjectives to learn both word- and sentence-level information, where the\nobjectives include masked language modeling as well as the next sentence\nprediction. A couple of variants have been proposed based on BERT.\nRoBERTa  attempts to improve BERT by providing a\nbetter recipe in BERT model training. ALBERT \ntargets at compressing the model size of BERT by introducing two\nparameter-reduction techniques. At the same time, it achieves better\nperformance. XLNET  adopts a generalized auto-regressive\npre-training method that has the merits of auto-regressive and\nauto-encoder language models. Because of the superior performance of BERT-based models, it is\nimportant to have a better understanding of BERT-based models and the\ntransformer architecture. Efforts have been made along this direction\nrecently as reviewed below. Liu et al. \nand Petroni et al.  used word-level\nprobing tasks to investigate the linguistic properties learned by the\ncontextualized models experimentally. Kovaleva et al.\n and Michel et al.\n attempted to understand the self-attention\nscheme in BERT-based models. Hao et al. \nprovided insights into BERT by visualizing and analyzing the loss\nlandscapes in the fine-tuning process. Ethayarajh\n explained how the deep contextualized\nmodel learns the context representation of words. Despite the\nabove-mentioned efforts, the evolving pattern of a word representation\nacross layers in BERT-based models has not been studied before. In this\nwork, we first examine the pattern evolution of a token representation\nacross layers without taking its context into account. With the\ncontext-independent analysis, we observe that the evolving patterns are\nhighly related to word properties. This observation in turn inspires the\nproposal of a new sentence embedding method â€“ SBERT-WK.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: of a word based on its contexts. To address the\nshortcomings of static word embedding methods, there is a new trend to\ngo from shallow to deep contextualized representations. For example,\nELMo [ref]4, GPT  and BERT [ref]5\nare pre-trained deep neural language models, and they can be fine-tuned\non specific tasks. These new word embedding methods achieve impressive\nperformance on a wide range\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
