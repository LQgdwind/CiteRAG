      "content": "Paper Title: Contents\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBayesian graphical modeling and inference  expanded since the 1980’s, with applications in numerous areas. Graphical models were introduced in probability and statistics to allow for a modular description of models . Graphical models divide into two subfamilies: (directed) Bayesian Networks originally proposed by Judea Pearl  and (nondirected) Factor Graphs   . Probabilistic graphical modeling gave birth to an important sub-community of probabilistic programming   . Factor Graphs allow for the modular specification of unnormalized probabilities, based on a nondirected bipartite graph (V,F,E)𝑉𝐹𝐸(V,F,E), where V∪F𝑉𝐹V{\\cup}{F} is the set of vertices and E⊆V×F𝐸𝑉𝐹E{\\subseteq}V{\\times}{F} is the set of edges; let Vfsubscript𝑉𝑓V_{f} be the subset of v∈V𝑣𝑉v{\\in}{V} such that (v,f)∈E𝑣𝑓𝐸(v,f){\\in}{E}. V𝑉V is a set of random variables, and, to each factor f∈F𝑓𝐹f{\\in}{F} is associated an unnormalized probability pf​(Vf)subscript𝑝𝑓subscript𝑉𝑓p_{f}(V_{f}) for the tuple Vfsubscript𝑉𝑓V_{f} of random variables. This model defines the unnormalized probability distribution of V𝑉V as the product P​(V)=∏f∈Fpf​(Vf)𝑃𝑉subscriptproduct𝑓𝐹subscript𝑝𝑓subscript𝑉𝑓P(V)=\\prod_{f\\in{F}}p_{f}(V_{f})—logarithms of probabilities are often considered instead and added, under the name of potential . A Bayesian Network is a tuple (V,E,p)𝑉𝐸𝑝(V,E,p), where: V𝑉V is a set of random variables; (V,E)𝑉𝐸(V,E) is an acyclic directed graph (for each v∈V𝑣𝑉v{\\in}{V}, we let pa​(v)pa𝑣\\mbox{\\sc pa}(v) denote its parents); p​(v|pa​(v))𝑝conditional𝑣pa𝑣p(v|\\mbox{\\sc pa}(v)) specifies, for each valuation of the parents pa​(v)pa𝑣\\mbox{\\sc pa}(v), a conditional distribution for the variable v𝑣v. The semantics of a Bayesian Network is that the joint distribution of V𝑉V factorizes as the product P​(V)=∏v∈Vp​(v|pa​(v))𝑃𝑉subscriptproduct𝑣𝑉𝑝conditional𝑣pa𝑣P(V)=\\prod_{v{\\in}{V}}p(v|\\mbox{\\sc pa}(v)). Bayesian Networks are thus causal graphical probabilistic models and the specification of causality comes extra to the specification of the underlying probability distribution, in the form of directed branches of the graph. As pointed out by Judea Pearl , causality is an extra information relating random variables, not inferrable from their joint probability distribution.\nMessage passing algorithms are a key tool for Factor Graphs, allowing to map a subclass of them to Bayesian networks, see  and Section 3.6 of .\nThrough the union of underlying graphs and the compositional nature of probabilities specified by graphical probabilistic models, both frameworks of Bayesian Networks and Factor Graphs are naturally equipped with some kind of parallel composition.\nAll these features explain why graphical models are considered as an intermediate format targeted by some probabilistic programming tools, see, e.g.,  , and , chapter 3. One important issue is the combination of probabilistic and nondeterministic behaviors. In statistical decision procedures, deciding whether the distribution of an observed sample belongs to subset 𝒫1subscript𝒫1{\\mathcal{P}}_{1} or 𝒫2subscript𝒫2{\\mathcal{P}}_{2} of probability distributions (where these subsets have empty intersection), exhibits nondeterminism in that the actual distribution is freely chosen within one of the two alternatives; this blending of probabilistic and nondeterministic behaviors is addressed in this case by using generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) tests . Also, the mixing of probabilistic behaviors and nondeterminism is central in probabilistic programming  [ref]21 .\nHow to blend probabilistic and nondeterministic behaviors in general is, therefore, an important issue. Probabilistic Programming        provides support for specifying statistical models with modularity and libraries for performing inference.\nSome probabilistic languages generate likelihood functions    for use by inference algorithms, whereas other generate sampling procedures  . Recently, G. Baudart et al.  proposed reactive probabilistic programming of dynamical systems as a conservative extension of synchronous languages , by enhancing the Hybrid Systems modeling language Zelus  with probabilities. Objectives of Probabilistic Programming can be categorized as follows: Modeling paradigm. Blending probability and nondeterminism, composing, comparing (equivalence), are the main issues. Model for proof systems. Calculi and their decidability and complexity are central issues in this objective. Support for statistical inference, decision, and learning. Key pillars are all limit theorems of probability and statistics (law of large numbers, central limit theorem, large deviations). These theorems rely on stationarity (or time invariance) of the underlying probabilistic model. For models with no dynamics, independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) sets of data can be sampled from the model. For models with dynamics (e.g., Markov chains), runs can be observed and used to infer model characteristics. One central difficulty in this objective is the blending of nondeterminism with probabilities, as it generally breaks the stationarity of the underlying statistical model. For example, if two different statistical models are combined with a nondeterministic choice (or an if-then-else statement with nondeterministic guard), then stationarity of the overall model no longer holds. The solution is to recover stationary models by separating the two alternatives and not mixing them. This quickly becomes cumbersome if several such constructions are used in a model. This difficult and central issue is extensively discussed in , where it is shown that some major probabilistic programming tools may not correctly implement Monte-Carlo based learning algorithms such as Metropolis-Hastings.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: behaviors is addressed in this case by using generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) tests . Also, the mixing of probabilistic behaviors and nondeterminism is central in probabilistic programming  [ref]21 .\nHow to blend probabilistic and nondeterministic behaviors in general is, therefore, an important issue. Probabilistic Programming        provides support for specifying statistical models\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
