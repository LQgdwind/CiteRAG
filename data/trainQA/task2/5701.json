      "content": "Paper Title: Twin Contrastive Learning with Noisy Labels\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAfter the label noise detection, the next important step is to estimate the true targets by correcting the wrong label to reduce its impact, called label correction.\nPrevious works usually perform label correction using the temporal ensembling [ref]25 or from the model predictions   before mixup augmentation without back-propagation. TCL leverages a similar idea to bootstrap the targets through the convex combination of its noisy labels and the predictions from the model itself: where g​(𝒙i(1))𝑔subscriptsuperscript𝒙1𝑖g(\\boldsymbol{x}^{(1)}_{i}) and g​(𝒙i(2))𝑔subscriptsuperscript𝒙2𝑖g(\\boldsymbol{x}^{(2)}_{i}) are the predictions of two augmentations, 𝒚isubscript𝒚𝑖\\boldsymbol{y}_{i} the noisy one-hot label, and wi∈[ref]0 subscript𝑤𝑖01w_{i}\\in[ref]0  represents the posterior probability as p​(c=1|γy=z|i)𝑝𝑐conditional1subscript𝛾𝑦conditional𝑧𝑖p(c=1|\\gamma_{y=z|i}) from the two-component GMM defined in Eq. (8). When computing Eq. (9), we stop the gradient from g𝑔g to avoid the model predictions collapsed into a constant, inspired by  0. Guided by the corrected labels 𝒕isubscript𝒕𝑖\\boldsymbol{t}_{i}, we swap two augmentations to compute the classification loss twice, leading to the bootstrap cross supervision, formulated as: where ℓℓ\\ell is the cross-entropy loss. This loss makes the predictions of the model from two data augmentations close to corrected labels from each other. In a sense, if wi=0subscript𝑤𝑖0w_{i}=0, the model is encouraged for consistent class predictions between different data augmentations, otherwise wi=1subscript𝑤𝑖1w_{i}=1 it is supervised by the clean labels. In addition, we leverage an additional entropy regularization loss on the predictions within a mini-batch ℬℬ\\mathcal{B}: where ℍ​(⋅)ℍ⋅\\mathbb{H}(\\cdot) is the entropy of predictions . The first term can avoid the predictions collapsing into a single class by maximizing the entropy of average predictions.\nThe second term is the minimum entropy regularization to encourage the model to have high confidence for predictions, which was previously studied in semi-supervised learning literature . Although both using the model predictions, we would emphasize that the cross-supervision in TCL is different to [ref]25   in three aspects: (i) both 𝒙i(1)subscriptsuperscript𝒙1𝑖\\boldsymbol{x}^{(1)}_{i} and 𝒙i(2)subscriptsuperscript𝒙2𝑖\\boldsymbol{x}^{(2)}_{i} are involved in back-propagation; (ii) the strong augmentation  used to estimate the true targets can prevent the overfitting of estimated targets; and (iii) TCL employs two entropy regularization terms to avoid the model collapse to one class. The final classification loss is given as follows:\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: step is to estimate the true targets by correcting the wrong label to reduce its impact, called label correction.\nPrevious works usually perform label correction using the temporal ensembling [ref]25 or from the model predictions   before mixup augmentation without back-propagation.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
