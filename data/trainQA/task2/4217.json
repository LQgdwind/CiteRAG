      "content": "Paper Title: pyKT: A Python Library to Benchmark Deep Learning based Knowledge Tracing Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile pyKT is able to standardize and accelerate research in DLKT, we are aware of some potential limitations described as follows: Binary response assumption. Most existing DLKT research relies on the binary response assumption and existing publicly available datasets only contain the binary labels, i.e., correct or incorrect. We believe this is because the binary valued data is (sort of) the most objective assessment labels that can be easily collected from either the online learning platforms or the offline classrooms in a large scale. However, we deeply believe that having more fine-grained student assessment labels beyond binary value of correct and incorrect would definitely push the boundary of this research field. Some research works such as option tracing [ref]11 aim to extend existing KT methods beyond correctness prediction to the task of predicting the exact option students select in multiple choice questions. This only works for multiple choice questions and it generalizes the traditional KT prediction from binary classification to the multi-class classification settings. The pyKT library is well modularized and different loss functions or evaluation metrics can be easily added. Hence, it is flexible to extend the existing benchmark to non-binary prediction settings such as multi-class classification or real-valued regression problems. Auxiliary side information. All existing baselines don’t utilize the rich auxiliary side information in educational contexts. Various auxiliary side information could be extracted as external knowledge and integrated with the DLKT models. Such auxiliary knowledge is expected to improve DLKT performance, which can be considered as follows: Question side info.: (1) question text content  ; (2) latent question variations with respect to each KC [ref]10; (3) question difficulty level [ref]10 [ref]18 ; and (4) relations among questions [ref]18  . Student side info.: (1) historical successful and failed attempts ; (2) recent attempts ; (3) students’ learning ability ; and (4) individualized prior knowledge of students . KC side info.: (1) latent knowledge representation [ref]10 ; and (2) relations among KCs [ref]18.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: having more fine-grained student assessment labels beyond binary value of correct and incorrect would definitely push the boundary of this research field.

This only works for multiple choice\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
