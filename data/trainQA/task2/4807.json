Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: SCAM! Transferring humans between images with Semantic Cross Attention Modulation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\niDesigner  contains images from designer fashion shows, including 50 different designers with 50k train and 10k test samples.\nWe segment human parts with [ref]24 and then merge the labels to end up with: face, body and background labels. CelebAMask-HQ [ref]21 contains celebrity faces from CelebA-HQ  [ref]18 with 28k train and 2k test images labelled with 19 semantic labels of high quality. ADE20K  contains diverse scenes images with 20k train and 2k test images. The images are labelled with 150 semantic labels of high quality. Metrics. We use PSNR, reconstruction FID (R-FID), and swap FID (S-FID). R-FID is computed as the FID between the train set and the reconstructed test set, while S-FID is between the test set and a set of subject transfer images computed on the test set. We introduce REIDAcc and REIDSim, computed in the latent space of a re-identification network . REIDSim computes the average cosine similarity between the subject image and the subject transfer image. REIDAcc accounts for the proportion of images where the cosine similarity of the transferred subject is higher with the subject than with the background.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: iDesigner  contains images from designer fashion shows, including 50 different designers with 50k train and 10k test samples.\nWe segment human parts with [ref]24 and then merge the labels to end up with: face, body and background labels.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
