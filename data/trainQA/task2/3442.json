      "content": "Paper Title: Robust Sylvester-Gallai type theorem for quadratic polynomials\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are two distinct goals to the line of work   7, including this paper. The first is obtaining higher degree geometric extensions of the Sylvester-Gallai and Edelstein-Kelley theorems. From the complexity theoretic point of view, the goal is to eventually obtain PIT algorithms for Σ[k]​Π[d]​Σ​Π[r]superscriptΣdelimited-[]𝑘superscriptΠdelimited-[]𝑑ΣsuperscriptΠdelimited-[]𝑟\\Sigma^{[k]}\\Pi^{[d]}\\Sigma\\Pi^{[r]} circuits, for any k,r=O​(1)𝑘𝑟𝑂1k,r=O(1).\nCurrently we have a polynomial time PIT algorithm only for the case k=3𝑘3k=3 and r=2𝑟2r=2 7.\nTo understand such a difficult question one has to start somewhere, and the case k=3𝑘3k=3 and r=2𝑟2r=2 was a natural starting point for the investigation (especially as no subexponential time PIT algorithm, even for Σ​Π[d]​Σ​Π[ref]2superscriptΣdelimited-[]3superscriptΠdelimited-[]𝑑ΣsuperscriptΠdelimited-[]2\\Sigma^{}\\Pi^{[d]}\\Sigma\\Pi^{[ref]2} circuits, was known prior to 7). Since so little is known, we believe that a natural approach for advancing is to first extend the results of 7 to higher degrees (i.e. higher values of r𝑟r), and then for a higher top fan-in (i.e. higher values of k𝑘k).\nBefore we explain the difficulties in going to higher degrees we recall that 7 needed the following strengthening of Theorem 1.7 for their PIT algorithm. There exists a universal constant λ𝜆\\lambda such that the following holds.\nLet 𝒯1,𝒯2,𝒯3⊂ℂ​[x1,…,xn]subscript𝒯1subscript𝒯2subscript𝒯3ℂsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛{\\mathcal{T}}_{1},{\\mathcal{T}}_{2},{\\mathcal{T}}_{3}\\subset\\mathbb{C}[x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}] be finite sets of pairwise linearly independent homogeneous polynomials satisfying the following properties: Each Q∈∪j∈𝒯j𝑄subscript𝑗delimited-[]3subscript𝒯𝑗Q\\in\\cup_{j\\in}{\\mathcal{T}}_{j} is either irreducible quadratic or a square of a linear function. Every two polynomials Q1subscript𝑄1Q_{1} and Q2subscript𝑄2Q_{2} from distinct sets satisfy that whenever they vanish then the product of all the polynomials in the third set vanishes as well. Then, dim(span⁡{∪j∈𝒯j})≤λdimensionspansubscript𝑗delimited-[]3subscript𝒯𝑗𝜆\\dim(\\operatorname{span}\\{{\\cup_{j\\in}{\\mathcal{T}}_{j}}\\})\\leq\\lambda. There are several difficult hurdles in going from r=2𝑟2r=2 to general r𝑟r, or even to r=3𝑟3r=3, if we wish to continue working in the framework of   7 (and this paper). The first is understanding what is the correct generalization of Theorem 1.13 to higher degrees, as this theorem lies at the heart of all these papers.\nA second hurdle is obtaining a robust version of Theorem 1.14. First for r=2𝑟2r=2 and then for higher degrees. For extending Theorem 1.13 to higher degrees it seems natural to find an extension to r=3𝑟3r=3. While it seems that such an approach could last forever and lead nowhere (as we will then have to prove a result for r=4𝑟4r=4 etc.), we believe that understanding the case r=3𝑟3r=3 can shed more light on the general case, as sometimes going from degree 222 to 333 is as difficult as the general case. Once we prove such a structural theorem, we will need to extend Theorem 1.14 to higher values of r𝑟r. An important tool in the proof of Theorem 1.14 was a robust version of the EK-theorem. We say that the sets 𝒯1,𝒯2,𝒯3⊂ℂnsubscript𝒯1subscript𝒯2subscript𝒯3superscriptℂ𝑛{\\mathcal{T}}_{1},{\\mathcal{T}}_{2},{\\mathcal{T}}_{3}\\subset\\mathbb{C}^{n} form a δ𝛿\\delta-EK configuration if for every i∈𝑖delimited-[]3i\\in and p∈𝒯i𝑝subscript𝒯𝑖p\\in{\\mathcal{T}}_{i} a\nδ𝛿\\delta fraction of the vectors q𝑞q in the union of the two other sets satisfy that p𝑝p and q𝑞q span some vector in the third set (the one not containing p𝑝p and q𝑞q).\nWe refer to a 111-EK configuration as simply an EK-configuration. Let 0<δ≤10𝛿10<\\delta\\leq 1 be any constant. Let 𝒯1,𝒯2,𝒯3⊂ℂnsubscript𝒯1subscript𝒯2subscript𝒯3superscriptℂ𝑛{\\mathcal{T}}_{1},{\\mathcal{T}}_{2},{\\mathcal{T}}_{3}\\subset\\mathbb{C}^{n} be disjoint finite sets that form a δ𝛿\\delta-EK configuration. Then, dim(span⁡{∪i𝒯i})=O​(1/δ3)dimensionspansubscript𝑖subscript𝒯𝑖𝑂1superscript𝛿3\\dim(\\operatorname{span}\\{{\\cup_{i}{\\mathcal{T}}_{i}}\\})=O(1/\\delta^{3}). Thus, a natural continuation would be to prove a robust version of Theorem 1.16 for quadratic polynomials (i.e. a robust version of Theorem 1.7) and then to extend it to a robust version of Theorem 1.14 and to higher degrees.\nWhile in this paper we only prove a robust version of Theorem 1.5, we believe that with some more technical work this can be extended to a robust version of Theorem 1.7 as well. Hence, the next immediate challenge would be to obtain a robust version of Theorem 1.14 (or even of the main result of ).\nIf we obtain such an extension and, in addition extend Theorem 1.13 to higher values of r𝑟r, then we expect that a PIT algorithm for the case k=3𝑘3k=3 and r=3𝑟3r=3 would follow.\nMore importantly, we believe that this will let us gain important understanding on how to generalize the results for arbitrary values of r𝑟r.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: question one has to start somewhere, and the case k=3𝑘3k=3 and r=2𝑟2r=2 was a natural starting point for the investigation (especially as no subexponential time PIT algorithm, even for Σ​Π[d]​Σ​Π[ref]2superscriptΣdelimited-[]3superscriptΠdelimited-[]𝑑ΣsuperscriptΠdelimited-[]2\\Sigma^{}\\Pi^{[d]}\\Sigma\\Pi^{[ref]2} circuits, was known prior to 7).
