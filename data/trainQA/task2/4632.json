      "content": "Paper Title: Selection of a representative sorting model in a preference disaggregation setting: a review of existing procedures, new proposals, and experimental comparison\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn multiple criteria sorting problems, alternatives need to be assigned to preference-ordered classes . Each of them is pre-defined and associated with a precise semantic, implying the same subsequent treatment of alternatives placed in a given category. The presence of multiple, potentially conflicting criteria makes such ordinal classification problems challenging. For this reason, the field of  Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA) offers a variety of methods that support the Decision Makers in carrying forward the solution process (see, e.g.,   ). They are helpful in problem structuring, preference elicitation, construction and exploitation of the preference model, and explaining the recommended assignments [ref]1. In recent years, the approaches adopting a preference disaggregation perspective have been prevailing . They construct a sorting model using a regression-like scheme based on the DM’s decision examples. Such approaches facilitate the solution process by lowering the cognitive effort on the part of DMs and not requiring a specialized knowledge required when directly specifying values of decision model parameters. The most popular preference disaggregation sorting method is UTADIS . It accepts indirect preference information in the form of assignment examples, specifying the desired classification for a subset of reference alternatives 2. Such holistic statements are translated into compatible parameters of an additive value function and thresholds separating the classes on a scale of a comprehensive value . UTADIS has been appreciated in the MCDA community for using an intuitive sorting procedure with highly interpretable alternatives’ scores and class thresholds, while at the same time being free of statistic hypotheses and restrictions  . Also, it makes use of both qualitative and quantitative criteria, differentiates between inter- and intra-criteria attractiveness, and provides means for interaction with the DMs who might review the model by changing or enriching their preferences 3. Such appealing features have motivated the practical use of UTADIS for solving real-world decision problems concerning, e.g., business failure prediction , credit risk assessment , supplier classification , sorting activities in civil construction , assessment of mutual funds , energy analysis and policy making , and adoption of green chemistry principles in nanotechnology 3. The basic variant of UTADIS has been extended in numerous ways. In particular, it was generalized to an example-based procedure where the classes are delimited implicitly by decision examples rather than class thresholds . Furthermore, a sequential classification technique, called M.H.DIS, was introduced in  to consider the assignment of not yet classified alternatives to the most preferred class in a stepwise fashion. Moreover, UTADIS was advanced to a robustness analysis framework, where a multiplicity of compatible sorting models are exploited to verify the stability of classification. In  Robust Ordinal Regression (ROR), all such models are translated into the necessary and possible results using mathematical programming  1. In turn, in  Stochastic Ordinal Regression (SOR) – the Monte Carlo simulations derive a large, representative set of such models whose results are summarized in the form of stochastic acceptabilities 9. Also, many works proposed dedicated techniques for dealing with inconsistency of assignment examples. They aim at restoring the consistency , minimize a misclassification error , use preference models compatible with different preferential reducts 3, or incorporate contingent, inter-related models that altogether reconstruct the holistic preference information 6. In the same spirit, some optimization techniques were devised for handling large sets of assignment examples  . Further methodological advancements have been devoted to supporting preference elicitation, enriching incorporated models, and addressing various structures and types of handled decision problems. In 4, one proposed active learning strategies that minimize the number of assignment examples needed for arriving at a sufficiently robust recommendation. Moreover, 5 introduced a unified framework handling preference information in the form of assignment-based pairwise comparisons and constraints on the category sizes   along with assignment examples, whereas  accounted for valued desired classifications. An additive value function used in UTADIS was extended to admit interactions between criteria 2, non-monotonicity 7 8  or polynomial character  of marginal value functions. Furthermore,  adapted the method to a hierarchical structure of criteria, whereas 8  considered a multi-decision classification problem with many interrelated decision attributes. Finally, dedicated group decision methods were devised for handling preferences of multiple DMs and either arriving at a collective recommendation  or investigating the spaces of consensus and disagreement observed in the group . A variety of real-world applications and methodological developments confirms the status of UTADIS as one of the essential methods in MCDA. This paper deals with procedures for selecting a single instance of the threshold-based value-driven sorting model. Since the polyhedron of all functions and thresholds compatible with the stated indirect preference information can be quite large  1, such a selection can be performed in different ways. Despite there exist robustness analysis methods that avoid such an arbitrary selection, the topic is worthwhile for a few reasons. The analysis of a single sorting model instance is straightforward even for non-experts in MCDA, being less abstract than that of the entire set of infinitely many such compatible instances. Moreover, such a model can be displayed to the DMs, who can analyze the curvatures of marginal value functions, importances of criteria, dispersion of class thresholds, alternatives’ comprehensive scores, and margins of safety in the recommended univocal assignments . In this way, it constitutes a synthetic and intuitive solution to the sorting problem, supporting the validity of the derived recommendation or motivating reactions from DMs. We contribute to the literature in a three-fold way. First, we review different concepts underlying the selection of a representative sorting model in the context of UTADIS. The primary idea consists of choosing the most discriminant model in terms of the differences between comprehensive values of reference alternatives assigned to different classes and/or marginal values associated with consecutive characteristic points of per-criterion functions . Furthermore, we discuss the concept of optimizing the comprehensive values attained by all alternatives or controlling the slope of marginal functions . Another methodological stream is oriented toward identifying a central model with the proviso that the concept of centrality is interpreted in various ways  . Moreover, we refer to the mean models obtained by averaging either the extreme models compatible with the DM’s preferences 1 or a large sample of uniformly distributed ones 3. The last postulate builds on the outcomes of robustness analysis by making use of necessary, possible  or stochastic results 9 to define the targets that should be emphasized in the representative case. Our second contribution consists of proposing novel procedures for selecting a single sorting model representative in the sense of robustness preoccupation. Specifically, we refer to the outcomes of Stochastic Ordinal Regression in the form of Class Acceptability Indexs and Assignment-based Pairwise Outranking Indexs 9. They quantify the shares of compatible sorting models, confirming a given alternative’s assignment to a particular class or supporting one alternative being assigned to a class at least as good as another. The representative model emphasizes the most frequent classifications of all alternatives, or the most common assignment-based preference relations for all pairs of alternatives, or both these objectives at once. Similar to , we refer to the “one for all, all for one” motto by representing all compatible sorting models, which contribute to the definition of a representative one. However, we build on more informative and detailed outcomes in the form of stochastic acceptabilities 6 rather than the possible and necessary assignments that need to be confirmed by at least one or all compatible models, respectively. We illustrate all procedures, including the existing and newly introduced ones, on a single decision problem to clarify their operational steps. The third and most crucial contribution consists of a thorough experimental evaluation of the sixteen discussed procedures. The problem of choosing the “best” sorting model in the preference disaggregation methods is ill-defined. However, one can consider some objective criteria for the meaningful comparison of various procedures. In particular, we account for five measures that make sense in the context of both using incomplete preference information concerning a subset of reference alternatives and the multiplicity of sorting models compatible with the DM’s assignments examples. They concern (i) the ability for reconstructing reference classification for all alternatives, (ii) the capability of restoring the preference model in terms of trade-off weights of criteria, alternatives’ comprehensive values, and class thresholds, and (iii) the robustness of derived assignments in terms of the support they are given by all compatible models. The experiment involves problems with different numbers of classes, criteria, characteristic points of marginal functions, and reference alternatives assigned by the DM to each class. We discuss the average results attained over all considered settings and the trends observed with increasing model’s complexity and availability of preference information. In this regard, our study can be seen as a significant extension of the experiments discussed in , where only four procedures have been compared in a similar context. The paper’s remainder is organized in the following. Section 2 reminds UTADIS and its robust counterparts. In Section 3, we discuss various procedures for selecting a representative sorting model. Section 4 illustrates their use on a didactic example. In Section 5, we present the results of an extensive experimental comparison of different approaches.
