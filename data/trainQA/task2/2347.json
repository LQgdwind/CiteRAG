      "content": "Paper Title: Machine Learning for Financial Forecasting, Planning and Analysis: Recent Developments and Pitfalls\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe conducted a search of the literature across Google, Google Scholar and finance journals on the use of machine learning in FP&A. The use of quantitative methods in the broad field of finance has been studied intensively for close to 40 years [ref]39, in part because of the general availability of data in this field, the existence of many areas of implementation and the substantial economic impact of financial decisions. Our search yielded surprisingly few recent publications on the use of machine learning explicitly in FP&A and related fields. The key thrust of machine learning in finance is directed towards various applications ultimately linked to forecasting and trading financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, currencies and derivatives. Credit scoring and fraud detection are other major areas. Examples of recent surveys include [ref]39 and .\n We see two possible reasons for the apparent scarcity of publications on machine learning in FP&A. First, time-series forecasting has been thoroughly covered and researched for many years . A large variety of tools for this purpose have been developed, both from an academic and theoretical perspective, as well as from the perspective of practitioners, including easy to use off-the-shelf software . From a practical FP&A perspective, these tools, together with the domain knowledge of the experts working in the FP&A function, allow practitioners to arrive at results that - by and large - serve sufficiently well to meet the objective of developing financial plans. Especially practitioners may therefore perceive machine learning as a “so-so” technology , which is not (yet) quite worth their (full) attention. Thus, the intrinsic urge to look for new tools, including machine learning, in FP&A is still less pronounced than it is, for instance, in stock market forecasting, where even a relatively small improvement in forecasting accuracy can yield significant economic payoff. We believe that this will change with the further deployment of digitalization and the consequent increase in data availability as described above. Besides improving the precision of financial forecasts, automated forecasts driven by machine learning can also lead to a substantial reduction in costs and to increased flexibility given that the traditional process is quite labor- and time-intensive.\n Second, we hypothesize the following reason for the limited number of publications on machine learning in FP&A. The initial development of artificial intelligence and machine learning methods was driven mostly by academia. Because these methods are highly relevant for industrial applications, companies (in particular in the tech field) have shown strong interest in applying and developing them further. Indeed, some of the large tech companies host their own dedicated research teams. However, the limited availability of skilled professionals represents a hurdle to fast diffusion in all corporate functions of a company. Therefore, the application of machine learning for FP&A is still rare in the finance function, even though a host of machine learning publications by the industry have already appeared in other functional areas.222For instance, www.bosch.com/de/forschung/know-how/publikationen (accessed Feb 23, 2021) contains a collection by Robert Bosch GmbH. Management consultancies have also discovered the benefit of machine learning for finance and FP&A. However, their publications remain general and directional in nature (see for instance , , , 7).\n One company that has made public its use of machine learning in FP&A in scientific papers is Microsoft Corporation. In the past several years, Microsoft appears to have followed an innovative approach with machine learning in FP&A as witnessed by three publications from its employees. One paper  compares the performance of random forests to that of traditional time-series methods such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), error trend and seasonality (ETS, a variant of exponential smoothing) and seasonal-trend decomposition using loess (STL, another variant of smoothing) for forecasting quarterly revenues by major geographic region and at the global level up to one year into the future. Based on their exploratory analysis, the random forest model with a restricted number of features outperformed the traditional time series methods and the forecasts generated by the domain experts in the Microsoft FP&A department.\n A second paper  describes a machine learning-based solution that forecasts revenue on a quarterly basis, including individual forecasts for 30 products in three different business segments. Specifically, the machine learning forecast used an elastic net, a random forest, a K-nearest-neighbor and a support vector machine. The winner model was then selected via back-testing. The forecasts generated in this way proved to be more accurate than the traditional forecasts generated by FP&A in approximately 70% of the cases. The paper cites the ability to incorporate external information (e.g., temperature as a driver for electricity demand) in regression frameworks as an advantage of these over pure (standard) time-series models. While classical time-series are good at capturing trends and seasonality, they often struggle to incorporate external data. In particular, they generally lack a regularization mechanism. As a result, they tend to overfit the training data in high-dimensional settings, leading to low out-of-sample accuracy for new forecasts. Many machine learning methods include by design mechanisms to avoid overfitting (e.g., regularization for ridge, lasso and elastic net).\n  also highlight some requirements that arise from the intent to use the results of machine learning forecasts in a practical manner in a corporate setting. Traditionally, FP&A works with a mid-point estimate, coupled with an estimation of the risks and opportunities around this mid-point. Risks and opportunities typically consist of a list of items or events that will materially impact the business results if they do not turn out as assumed in the mid-point forecast . Judgmental probability estimates provided by subject matter experts are often attached to these items, together with a quantification of the expected impact under the different scenarios.333Other methods with a very similar intent exist. Examples are the quantification of a best and worst case in addition to the normal or base case, or sensitivity analysis with varying degrees of sophistication. For forecasts generated by traditional statistical or machine learning models, prediction intervals are therefore an important element for FP&A practitioners in order to quantify the risk in the forecast. However, prediction intervals are not typically part of machine learning models. The solution proposed by  consists of creating intervals from out-of-sample error distributions obtained during backtesting. Other practical requirements in a corporate environment are the need for a mostly automated solution allowing for fast forecast generation as well as the need to ensure high security standards for data storage, processing and access. Financial data such as sales and profits are highly sensitive and companies are reluctant to release them into public cloud environments.  explain the details of their workflow automation and security controls, which revolve around the Microsoft Azure cloud-computing platform.\n The third publication  evaluated deep neural networks traditionally used in natural language processing (encoder-decoder LSTMs) and computer vision (dilated convolutional neural networks) in order to forecast company revenues. The approach incorporated transfer and curriculum learning. For the products and time period under study in this publication, deep neural networks improved predictive accuracy compared to the company’s internal baseline, which combined traditional statistical and machine learning methods other than deep neural networks.\n In another example of applied machine learning in the area of FP&A, Daimler Mobility used an undisclosed library of machine learning algorithms to generate a monthly forecast set, spanning the next 18 months and updated monthly . In this respect, the approach followed the concept of a rolling forecast. The forecasted set of values comprised key financial performance indicators that were representative of Daimler Mobility’s car rental, leasing, financing and fleet management business. According to , one of the key advantages of this approach compared to the traditional way of forecasting and budgeting is the speed with which updated forecasts are available, allowing faster adoption of corrective action.\n These papers all discuss modern machine learning methods for financial forecasting. In the next section, we will show that these approaches cannot be applied directly to inference problems and how the double machine learning framework overcomes this problem. A first example will illustrate the use of machine learning techniques in FP&A for forecasting. A second example will serve to illustrate the use of double machine learning for planning (inference). Finally, we will explore whether having additional data improves the results for both the forecasting and planning tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: Google, Google Scholar and finance journals on the use of machine learning in FP&A.
