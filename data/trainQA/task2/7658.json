      "content": "Paper Title: AutoDFP: Automatic Data-Free Pruning via Channel Similarity Reconstruction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSome pruning methods attempt to use less fine-tuning and less dependency on the dataset [ref]32, [ref]33, , .\nThiNet [ref]32 models channel pruning as an optimization problem to minimize layer-wise reconstruction error and proposes a solution that does not require using the entire dataset. The approach proposed by He et al. [ref]33 suggests a method for channel selection based on LASSO regression, followed by a reconstruction of output feature maps using least squares. Another method proposed by Mussay et al.  introduces a pruning criterion based on coreset to perform channel selection in order to reduce the expensive cost of fine-tuning. Moreover, some data-free approaches utilize synthetic samples to fine-tune the pruned model, such as Dream  and DFNP . Although these generative techniques tackle data security concerns, they still necessitate expensive fine-tuning, which can even be more costly. There exist only a handful of methods capable of achieving network pruning entirely without the need for data or fine-tuning , , [ref]22. The method proposed by Srinivas et al.  first introduces the data-free methods to remove the redundant neurons. Neuron Merging  aims to substitute pruned channels with similar ones. In contrast, DFPC [ref]22 primarily focuses on the exploration of coupled channel pruning in data-free scenarios.\nHowever, significant manual effort is required to adjust the pruning strategy and hyperparameters in this approach, and the resultant decrease in accuracy is substantial, making it incomparable to the accuracy achieved by the data-driven methods.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: Some pruning methods attempt to use less fine-tuning and less dependency on the dataset [ref]32, [ref]33, , .\nThiNet [ref]32 models channel pruning as an optimization problem to minimize layer-wise reconstruction error and proposes a solution that does not require using the entire\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
