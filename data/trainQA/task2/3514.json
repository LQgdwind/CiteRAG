      "content": "Paper Title: Pix2NeRF: Unsupervised Conditional ùúã-GAN for Single Image to Neural Radiance Fields Translation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFollowing the success of Neural Radiance Fields¬†(NeRF)¬†3, encoding scenes as weights of multi-layer perceptrons¬†(MLPs) has emerged as a promising research direction. Novel View Synthesis is an important application: given sparse sample views of a scene, the task is to synthesize novel views from unseen camera poses. NeRF addresses it by encoding color and volume density at each point of the 3D scene into a neural network and uses traditional volume rendering to compose 2D views. While NeRF is capable of synthesizing novel views with high fidelity, it is often impractical due to being ‚Äúoverfitted‚Äù to a given scene and requiring multiple views of the scene to train.\nSeveral follow-up works attempt to address these limitations via making NeRF generalize to new scenes. Major progress has been made in training a general NeRF capable of encoding a scene given only one or a handful of views¬†[ref]46     .\nHowever, these works are designed to work well only with multi-view images during either training or both training and inference. One reason why single-shot NeRF, or in general single-shot novel view synthesis is challenging, is the incomplete content information within a single image. For example, given a frontal image of a car, there is very little information to infer a novel view from the back directly. Bringing back the traditional inverse graphics and 3D reconstruction pipelines,  addresses this issue by making an additional assumption on the symmetry of the scene to interpolate potentially missing geometry information within a single image. However, this technique is limited to scenes where symmetry can be introduced and does not tackle the general case. Therefore, a natural follow-up question is how does a human brain address such a challenging task? One of the approaches we use unconsciously is learning a prior implicit model for object categories and mapping what we observe to the learned model. This line of thinking is already explored in prior works¬†[ref]46 . An essential part missing from these works is ensuring that novel views also meet our expectation of the object class, and due to the lack of supervision from a sole image, this is normally done via imagination. One of the closest forms of imagination developed by the machine learning community is Generative Adversarial Networks¬†. GANs have been very successful in image synthesis and transformation. Beyond 2D, studies have shown GAN‚Äôs capability of synthesizing 3D content¬† from natural images. This suggests another approach to address 3D reconstruction without multi-view images via 3D GAN inversion.\nSuch a strategy bypasses the problem of missing information within one sole image due to GAN‚Äôs adversarial training. Existing works¬†[ref]31  utilize such a method based on HoloGAN¬†, StyleGAN¬†, and others, but one of the drawbacks naturally from these 3D-aware generative models is their relatively weak 3D consistency. With the rapid increase of NeRF¬†3 popularity, corresponding generative models are also gaining attention. GRAF¬† and œÄùúã\\pi-GAN¬† follow traditional GAN settings by mapping latent codes to category-specific radiance fields. These generative models typically have high 3D consistency due to the built-in volumetric rendering design. This observation suggests the possibility of few-shot 3D reconstruction using adversarial training and radiance fields. In this paper, we formulate the task of translating an input image of a given category to NeRF as an end-to-end pipeline termed Pix2NeRF (Fig.¬†1). The method can perform novel view synthesis given a single image, without the need of pre-training, annotation, or fine-tuning. Pix2NeRF can be trained with natural images ‚Äì without explicit 3D supervision, in an end-to-end fashion. Inspired by prior works¬†[ref]46  [ref]31, we introduce an encoder mapping a given image to a latent space.\nWe jointly optimize several objectives. First, we train œÄùúã\\pi-GAN and the added encoder to map generated images back to the latent space. Second, we adapt the encoder coupled with œÄùúã\\pi-GAN‚Äôs generator to form a conditional GAN, trained with both adversarial and reconstruction loss.\nWe show that merely doing œÄùúã\\pi-GAN inversion is challenging and insufficient to complete our goal, and adaptation is important for calibrating learned representations of the encoder and generator.\nOur framework is able to instantiate NeRF in a single shot manner while naturally preserving the ability to synthesize novel views with high fidelity, comparable to state-of-the-art generative NeRF models.\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: to address these limitations via making NeRF generalize to new scenes.
