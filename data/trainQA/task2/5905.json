Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: RegionPLC: Regional Point-Language Contrastive Learning for Open-World 3D Scene Understanding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets and Validation Settings. To test the effectiveness of RegionPLC, we evaluate it on three popular datasets: ScanNet¬†, ScanNet200¬†[ref]28 and nuScenes¬†, covering indoor and outdoor scenarios.\nWe validate the open-world capability of our method with different numbers of annotated categories, including base-annotated open world (i.e. part of categories annotated) and annotation-free open world (i.e. no category annotated). We evaluate our method‚Äôs performance on both semantic segmentation and instance segmentation tasks. Category Partition.\nWe split categories into base and novel on ScanNet¬† following PLA¬†[ref]7. For nuScenes¬†, we ignore the ‚Äúotherflat‚Äù class and randomly divide the rest classes into B12/N3 (i.e. 12 base and 3 novel categories) and B10/N5. For ScanNet200¬†[ref]28, we randomly split 200 classes to B170/N30 and B150/N50. See Suppl. for details. Evaluation Metrics. For semantic segmentation, we follow 6 [ref]7 to employ mIoUB, mIoUN and harmonic mean IoU (hIoU) for evaluating base, novel categories and their harmonic mean separately. Similarly, for instance segmentation, we employ mAP‚Ñ¨50superscriptsubscriptabsent50‚Ñ¨{}_{50}^{\\mathcal{B}}, mAPùí©50superscriptsubscriptabsent50ùí©{}_{50}^{\\mathcal{N}} and hAP50.For annotation-free semantic segmentation, we use mean IoU and mean accuracy on foreground classes (i.e. mIoU‚Ä† and mAcc‚Ä†) excluding ‚Äúwall‚Äù, ‚Äúfloor‚Äù and ‚Äúceiling‚Äù for evaluation. Implementation Details. We adopt the sparse-convolution-based UNet¬† as the 3D encoder with CLIP¬† text encoder as the final classifier for 3D semantic segmentation, and SoftGroup¬†2 for instance segmentation as [ref]7. We use category prompts to replace ambiguous category names such as ‚Äúmanmade‚Äù and ‚Äúdrivable surface‚Äù with a list of concrete category names when encoding category embeddings.\nWe run all experiments with a batch size of 32 on 8 NVIDIA V100 or A100 (see Suppl. for more details).\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: Datasets and Validation Settings. To test the effectiveness of RegionPLC, we evaluate it on three popular datasets: ScanNet¬†, ScanNet200¬†[ref]28 and nuScenes¬†, covering indoor and outdoor scenarios.\nWe validate the open-world capability of our method with different numbers of annotated categories, including base-annotated open world\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
