      "content": "Paper Title: On the Complexity and Approximability of Optimal Sensor Selection and Attack for Kalman Filtering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn large-scale control system design, the number of sensors or actuators that can be installed is typically limited by a design budget constraint. Moreover, system designers often need to select among a set of possible sensors and actuators, with varying qualities and costs. Consequently, a key problem is to select an appropriate set of sensors or actuators in order to achieve certain objectives. This problem has recently received much attention from researchers (e.g.,    [ref]4 [ref]5 [ref]6   ). One specific instance of this problem arises in the context of linear Gauss-Markov systems, where the corresponding Kalman filter (with the chosen sensors) is used to estimate the states of the systems (e.g., 0, 1). The problem then becomes how to select sensors dynamically (at run-time) or statically (at design-time) to minimize certain metrics of the corresponding Kalman filter. The former scenario is known as the sensor scheduling problem, where different sets of sensors can be chosen at different time steps (e.g., 2 3 4). The latter scenario is known as the design-time sensor selection problem, where the set of sensors is chosen a priori and is not allowed to change over time (e.g., 5 6 7). Since these problems are NP-hard in general (e.g., 8), approximation algorithms that provide solutions within a certain factor of the optimal are then proposed to tackle them. Among these approximation algorithms, greedy algorithms have been widely used (e.g, 9, 0), since such algorithms have provable performance guarantees if the cost function is submodular or supermodular (e.g., 1, 2). Additionally, in many applications, the sensors that have been selected and installed on the system are susceptible to a variety of potential attacks. For instance, an adversary (attacker) can inject false data to corrupt the state estimation, which is known as the false data injection attack (e.g., 3 4 5). Another type of attack is the Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, where an attacker tries to diminish or eliminate a networkâ€™s capacity to achieve its expected objective 6, including, for example, wireless jamming (e.g., 7, 8) and memory exhaustion through flooding (e.g., 9). One class of DoS attacks corresponds to removing a set of installed sensors from the system, i.e., the measurements of the attacked sensors are not used. This was also studied in 0 and 1, and will be the type of attack we consider in this work. In this paper, we consider the sensor selection problem and the sensor attack problem for Kalman filtering of discrete-time linear dynamical systems. First, we study the problem of choosing a subset of sensors to install (under given selection budget constraints) to minimize the trace of either the steady state a priori or a posteriori error covariance of the Kalman filter. We refer to these problems as the priori and posteriori Kalman Filtering Sensor Selection (KFSS) problems, respectively. Second, we study the problem of attacking the installed sensors (by removing a subset of them, under given attack budget constraints) to maximize the trace of either the steady state a priori or a posteriori error covariance of the Kalman filter associated with the surviving sensors. These problems are denoted as the priori and posteriori Kalman Filtering Sensor Attack (KFSA) problems, respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: a key problem is to select an appropriate set of sensors or actuators in order to achieve certain objectives.
