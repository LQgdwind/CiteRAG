      "content": "Paper Title: A Sequence Repetition Node-Based Successive Cancellation List Decoder for 5G Polar Codes: Algorithm and Implementation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPolar codes, proposed in Arƒ±kan‚Äôs seminal work¬†, are the first class of error-correcting codes with an explicit construction that provably achieves channel capacity for binary-input discrete memoryless channels.\nBased on their outstanding error-correcting performance, polar codes were ratified as the standard code for the control channel of 5G enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB)¬†.\nWhile the polar code encoding schemes were released by 3GPP in 2018¬†, 3GPP did not specify a decoding scheme for polar codes.\nAlthough the original low-complexity successive cancellation (SC) decoding algorithm allows polar codes to achieve channel capacity at infinite code lengths, SC decoding has mediocre error-correcting performance for moderate code lengths and high decoding latency, which is insufficient for 5G scenarios. To improve the error-correcting performance, Tal and Vardy proposed SC-List (SCL) decoding¬†, which explores both hypotheses for each message bit and maintains a list of up to LùêøL candidate codewords in parallel during the decoding.\nThe 5G standard also includes concatenated cyclic redundancy check (CRC) codes, which allow the SCL decoder to select the most reliable candidate codeword that satisfies the CRC, which further improves the SCL decoding performance¬†.\nHowever, SCL decoding with medium to large list sizes (e.g., L=4ùêø4L=4 or L=8ùêø8L=8) suffers from high hardware complexity as an SCL decoder replicates the SC decoder structure LùêøL times.\nNonetheless, owing to the hardware-friendly log-likelihood ratio (LLR) based SCL decoding algorithm¬†, an SCL decoder with L=8ùêø8L=8 provides a good trade-off between error-correcting performance and hardware complexity.\nIt has therefore been chosen as the error-correcting performance baseline during the 5G standardization process¬†. Driven by the strict low-latency and high throughput requirements of modern communication systems, numerous SCL decoder hardware implementations have been presented in the literature¬†[ref]8 [ref]9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  8 9 0 1 2 3.\nMost of these process more than one bit at a time to accelerate the decoding, since the conventional SCL decoder¬† suffers from a long latency due to the serial decoding of each bit.\nIn¬†[ref]8 [ref]9 0 1 2, multi-bit SCL decoding is used in which a fixed number of bits are processed simultaneously, and all possible candidates for these bits are explored in parallel without exploiting a particular code structure.\nAlternatively, due to the recursive construction of polar codes, where every polar code of length NùëÅN is formed from two constituent codes of length N/2ùëÅ2N/2, there exist constituent codes which have special bit patterns that allow for a more efficient direct decoding of all their bits in parallel.\nRate-0 (R0) and Rate-1 (R1) nodes were initially proposed in¬†4 for simplified SC decoding with many other node types later identified, such as repetition (REP) and single parity-check (SPC)¬†5 nodes for Fast-SC decoding, TYPE-I to TYPE-V¬†6 nodes, and the generalized REP (G-REP) and generalized parity-check (G-PC) nodes¬†7.\nThese node-based techniques were later extended with list update techniques for node-based SCL decoding¬†8 4 9. These special nodes often represent large constituent codes, especially for high- and low-rate polar codes, allowing a node-based SCL decoder to generally achieve much lower latency than multi-bit SCL decoders at the cost of making the decoding schedule more complex due to the need for detecting these nodes in the decoding tree.\nHowever, all existing node-based SCL decoders¬†3 4 5 6 7 suffer from either only supporting a few special nodes, which impairs their decoding latency, or they instantiate separate sub-decoders for each node type when supporting several of these, which complicates their hardware implementation.\nWhat is lacking is a more general node type implementation that supports most special node patterns with maximum hardware re-use and the ability to optimize the decoder throughput and area for a specific standard. Recently, the sequence repetition (SR) node was proposed for SC decoding¬†0 1.\nThe SR node is a generalized node that includes most aforementioned nodes as special cases.\nAn SR-based decoder can thus support many node patterns in both low- and high-rate codes to reduce the decoding effort without limiting the range of supported codes.\nSR decoding can also potentially provide low-latency decoding as it is highly parallelizable, making it promising for SCL decoding in 5G.\nHowever, for SCL decoding, with a list of LùêøL paths, the strategy from¬†1 of decoding with all the SR node candidates in parallel is highly computationally complex.\nTherefore, to make SR-List decoding more feasible in hardware, it is critical to develop a general low-complexity SR-List decoding algorithm and architecture.\nThis architecture can then be customized to the specific codes employed by a standard to provide the best trade-off between area and decoding latency.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: process¬†.
