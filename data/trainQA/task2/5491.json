When the channel is found to be changed significantly from the channel for training and the measured performance is not acceptable, online training     [ref]30 is needed to fine-tune the neural network with online samples, to compensate for this degradation. However, it is a critical challenge to realize the online implementation for conventional neural networks in the real-world communication system. Realizability of online training: While online training is essential for practical implementation, the training process for many neural network solutions is not feasible in the real scenarios  because a complete, noise-free channel matrix is not available. Assuming that the input of the neural network is also LS estimate, neural network solutions achieve both the frequency interpolation and time interpolation to predict the complete channel matrix commonly which can improve the performance to MMSE level or beyond, because these neural networks have already been trained with the perfect and complete channel information. When the channel is found to be changed significantly, the corresponding online training may require the perfect channel matrix of the complete data packet for training. The critical challenge is that this channel knowledge is unavailable from the real-world noisy receiver waveform. Reliability of online training: The online training process needs to be reliable to achieve superior performance compared with conventional methods. However, the physical channel can be non-stationary when collecting the training samples, while training often needs sufficient samples to estimate the channel parameters properly. If the channel varies significantly among the collected training samples severely, especially in a single mini-batch, the online training process will randomly update the parameters. To avoid that, the online training dataset should be sampled within a controlled period to ensure the channel’s coherence. Moreover, the training process should be robust to outlier samples.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: or the 3GPP TS38.901 fast fading channel.
