      "content": "Paper Title: Behavioral Intention Prediction in Driving Scenes: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor a long time, the road map or the occupancy map is encoded with a dense rasterized processing, which has been adopted in many popular trajectory prediction methods, such as DESIRE [ref]92, IntentNet [ref]83, CoverNet [ref]93, Trajectron++ , MultiPath , Target Driven Trajectory (TNT) , and so on. These methods typically encode the road map with Convolution Neural Networks (CNN), while the structure of the road layout is not modeled well with the restricted perception field of CNN. MultiPath++  extends MultiPath with an efficient polyline encoding for agent-to-scene relations, which exploits the region-to-region relation for a better prediction ability. However, the polyline representation seems difficult requiring accurate annotation. Agent-to-scene interaction shows a promising constraint for reducing the implausible trajectories . The aforementioned agent-to-scene interactions need to pre-annotate or build the road map effectively, which limits flexibility in various situations when the road map information is not accurately obtained. Recently, for agent-to-scene interaction, the scene graph has attracted more attention  . The scene graph can reflect the common social interaction knowledge via large-scale data learning from raw video or point cloud data, and can be vectorized effectively, such as the RoadScene2Vec , as shown in Fig. 7. Under this insight, Song et al.  vectorize the traffic scene graph in each frame in pedestrian crossing prediction with improved performance.\n\nReference markers found: [92]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]92: For a long time, the road map or the occupancy map is encoded with a dense rasterized processing, which has been adopted in many popular trajectory prediction methods, such as DESIRE [ref]92, IntentNet [ref]83, CoverNet [ref]93, Trajectron++ , MultiPath , Target Driven Trajectory (TNT) , and so on.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
