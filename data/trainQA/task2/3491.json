      "content": "Paper Title: Robotic Telekinesis: Learning a Robotic Hand Imitator by Watching Humans on YouTube\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe first section reviews relevant research in 3D human pose estimation and the second section discusses related work in kinematic motion retargeting, with a particular focus on cross-embodiment retargeting and teleoperation. Understanding Human Hands and Bodies Modeling human bodies and estimating their poses are widely studied problems, with applications in graphics, virtual reality and robotics. The recent research most relevant to our work can roughly be divided into four sub-areas. (1) Hand and body modeling. MANO [ref]32 is a low-dimensional parametric model of a human hand, and SMPL 7 is an analogous model for the human body. SMPL-X 8 is a single unified model of both the body and hands. (2) Monocular human hand and body pose estimation. Recent works in human pose estimation typically estimate 2D quantities like bounding boxes  or skeletons , or perform a full 3D reconstruction   . Rong et al.  propose a method for integrated 3D reconstruction of human hands and bodies. (3) Dataset curation: The advances in human pose estimation crucially rely on large datasets of human hand and body poses. FreiHand , Human3.6M  and the CMU Mocap Database  are examples of densely-annotated datasets in clean indoor settings. On the other end of the spectrum, the 100 Days of Hands  and Epic Kitchens  datasets are massive collections of raw videos that span a rich and diverse set of hand poses and motions but don’t contain pose annotations. (4) Understanding human hand function. Brahmbhatt et al.  use thermal imaging to capture impact heatmaps that reveal patterns in the ways human hands interact with everyday objects. Taheri et al.  study the problem of how human hands and bodies behave while grasping and manipulating objects, and propose a method to generate plausible human grasps for novel objects. Hasson et al. 0 and Cao et al.  propose methods for joint hand and object reconstruction, and Hampali et al.  present a dataset of hand-object interactions with 3D annotations.\nLiu et al. 6 builds a taxonomy of human grasps to understand the cognitive patterns of human hand behavior 5. Kinematic Retargeting and Visual Teleoperation\nHuman pose estimation only solves half of the visual teleoperation problem. Mapping human poses to robot poses is itself a difficult challenge, because humans and robots have very different kinematic structures. Li et al 4 train a deep network to map human hand depth images to joint angles in the robotic Shadow Hand, and Antotsiou et al  combine inverse kinematics and Particle Swarm Optimization to retarget human hand poses to a high-dimensional robot hand model. Our system follows the method of DexPilot , which minimizes a cost function that captures the functional similarity between a human and a robot hand. The general problem of kinematically retargeting motion in one morphology into another is also studied outside of robotic manipulation. Villegas et al.  propose a cycle consistency objective to transform motion between animated humanoid characters of different body shapes. Peng et al 9 use an approach based on keypoint matching to learn robotic locomotion behaviors from demonstrations of walking dogs. Zakka et al.  learn a visual reward function that allows reinforcement learning agents to learn from demonstrators with different embodiments.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: problems, with applications in graphics, virtual reality and robotics.
