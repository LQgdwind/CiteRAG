      "content": "Paper Title: LocalDrop: A Hybrid Regularization for Deep Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNeural networks have lately shown impressive performance in sophisticated real-world situations, including image classification , object recognition  and image captioning [ref]3. Low, middle and high level features are integrated into deep neural networks, which are usually trained in an end-to-end manner. The levels of features can be enriched by stacking more layers (i.e., increasing the network depth) [ref]4 or widening the layers (i.e., including more filters) , which then leads to a large number of parameters to be optimized in fully-connected networks (FCNs) and convolutional networks (CNNs). However, given limited training data, it is difficult to figure out appropriate values for such a tremendous volume of variables without overfitting. Some methods have been developed to enable neural networks to perform well not just on training data, but also on new inputs . Among them, regularization is a major strategy for achieving this goal. The most straightforward solution is to stop the training as soon as the validation performance becomes suboptimal. This tactic is known as early stopping, which is widely used in deep learning regularization. Similarly to other machine learning models, L1 and L2 regularizations are also often adopted to penalize weights in neural networks. Since the seminal work by Hinton , dropout has become a popular technique among deep learning researchers to regularize a broad family of models. It randomly masks out part of the network and trains the ensemble consisting of all sub-networks. Extending the idea of dropout, DropConnect randomly drops weights instead of activations . Other dropout variants include adaptive dropout , variational dropout 0 and sparse variational dropout 1. In convolutional neural networks (CNNs), DropBlock 2 extends the idea of dropout to make it adaptable to the structure of CNNs. The original dropout has limit promotions in CNNs because the structure of convolutional networks obliges every unit to correlate with its adjacent units in the feature map. The adjacent units would contain information of any given dropped unit in the feature map. Batch normalization is another popular approach that can evidently improve generalization by reducing the internal covariance shift of feature representations 3. Other remarkable regularization techniques include weight decay, spatial shuffling 4, fractional max-pooling 5, and model averaging 6. These regularization approaches have been empirically proven to improve the generalization of neural networks and have achieved impressive performance in various applications. There have been several attempts at theoretically explaining the generalization of deep neural networks 7 8 9 0 but the link between theory and application is tenuous. Most of the regularization techniques were heuristically developed, only a handful of which were amended and complemented with solid analyses on generalization. For instance, dropout  was first sought after thanks to their impressive experimental performance, and later theoretical analyses were conducted in the Bayesian framework 1 and based on the Rademacher complexity 2. However, several recent dropout variants 1 3 4 have been introduced without theoretical underpinning. Instead of first heuristically designing a regularization and then seeking for feasible theoretical explanations, we advocate a reverse thinking to distill the regularization technique explicitly from the generalization analyses of neural networks. More specifically, we propose a new regularization algorithm called LocalDrop to regularize neural networks, including FCNs and CNNs, via the local Rademacher complexity of the function class 5. As the Rademacher complexity provides global estimates of the complexity of a function class, it does not indicate the fact that the algorithm would pick a function that have a small error. Since only a small subset of the function class will be used in practice, we employ the local Rademacher complexity to measure the complexity of neural networks. In FCNs, dropout with varied keep rates across different layers is included in the complexity analyses but DropBlock was replaced in CNNs. For an improved generalization error bound of neural networks, we choose to minimize the local Rademacher complexity of hypotheses, which then provides us a new complexity regularization involving dropout probabilities and weight normalization. A two-stage optimization is developed to efficiently solve neural networks with the new local Rademacher regularization. Experimental results drawn from real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of LocalDrop with rigorous theoretical foundation.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Neural networks have lately shown impressive performance in sophisticated real-world situations, including image classification , object recognition  and image captioning [ref]3.
