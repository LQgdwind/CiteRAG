      "content": "Paper Title: WEmbSim: A Simple yet Effective Metric for Image Captioning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAutomatic caption evaluation is a challenging task which seeks to score machine generated captions on their quality. Due to a surge of interest in image captioning over the past few years , the development of effective evaluation metrics has become increasingly pressing. Human assessments are considered the gold standard for the evaluation task. However, obtaining human scores for captions is time-consuming and resource intensive. Automatic evaluation metrics in contrast are more efficient and cost-effective. However, to serve as a replacement for humans, automatic measures are desired to generate human-like assessments such that their evaluation scores are consistent with human judgments. A number of sophisticated evaluation metrics have been proposed for captioning, amongst which some are borrowed from relevant domains, such as Machine Translation and others are developed specifically for captioning , . While captioning specific metrics such as SPICE 9 and CIDEr 8 have shown improved performance over the ones adopted from other domains, there is still no consensus on a single metric that gives near human performance. A general inclination of the research community towards sophisticated and intricately crafted measures tends to overlook the efficacy and usefulness of simple methods. To avoid this trap of ‘complex is better’, our research is inspired by the principle of Parsimony (Occam’s razor) [ref]4. This principle is interpreted as ‘a simple solution is better than a complex one’. Thus, if two methods give near equal performance, then one should prefer the simpler one. Our motivation in this work is to propose a simple, intuitive, yet effective metric, that can serve as a strong baseline for caption evaluation, and also be used as a good feature for supervised measures. In this paper, we present WEmbSim to evaluate machine generated captions. The key idea is to embed the captions into a semantic embedding space and then to assess the similarity between caption embeddings. There are various ways to embed sentences in a vector space. Sent2vec  is one such example, which requires a pretrained model to generate sentence embeddings. In this paper, we adopt the simplest sentence embedding model to represent captions i.e., the representation of captions is obtained through the mean of word embeddings (MOWE). By word embeddings, we mean a family of learned distributed vector representations based on sound language models, such as Word2vec [ref]6 and ELMo . The strength of Word Embeddings in terms capturing semantics has been extensively verified in literature , . Moreover, Sums of Word Embeddings (SOWE) have been successfully used as representations in a number of areas 0, 1. We show that using the cosine distance between the MOWE of the candidate and reference caption, gives a score that is correlated to human evaluations on the captions quality. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work which evaluates the performance of such metric for image captioning, using various pre-trained word embeddings across a number of benchmark datasets. For our experiments we make use of pre-trained word embeddings from Word2vec [ref]6, GloVE 2, FastText 3 and ELMo . We do not use the recently proposed language representation model BERT 4 as it is primarily a fine-tuning based model for applying pre-trained language representations to downstream tasks. Our focus is towards using feature-based strategies for language representations such as ELMo and Word2vec, to avoid the overhead of including the Transformer-based architecture in our caption evaluation task. Our contributions in this work are as follows: We propose a simple yet effective unsupervised metric WEmbSim for automatic caption evaluation. To demonstrate the strong performance of WEmbSim compared to rival methods, we evaluate its system-level correlation and accuracy in terms of matching human consensus scores for caption pairs. We analyze the robustness of our proposed metric to various sentence perturbations. We also examine its usefulness and complementarity to the existing measures.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: crafted measures tends to overlook the efficacy and usefulness of simple methods.
