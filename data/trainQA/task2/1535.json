The proposed multi-agent reinforcement learning method with individual counterfactual baseline (NAT-CMAL, Eqn. (11)) outperforms the cross-entropy loss based baseline (NAT-XE, Eqn. (5)) by a significant margin of 5.235.235.23 BLEU points.\nConsidering the influence of compositional agents (CA, Eqn. (18)) on the counterfactual baseline slightly increases the BLEU score by 0.180.180.18 points.\nNAT-CMAL-CA achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements over compared non-autoregressive models.\nSpecifically, NAT-CMAL-CA outperforms NAT with fertility by 6.186.186.18 BLEU points and\nIterative Refinement with rescoring 10 candidates by 2.262.262.26 BLEU points.\nComparing to autoregressive models, NAT-CMAL-CA is only 3.333.333.33 BLEU points behind its Transformer teacher,\nand is even comparable to the state-of-the-art LSTM-based S2S baseline.\nBy removing the consecutive identical tokens as a simple postprocessing following2 (postprocess), the BLEU score of NAT-CMAL-CA is further improved by 0.590.590.59.\nOur final model shrinks the gap between the autoregressive teacher and the NAT model from 8.748.748.74 (27.2027.2027.20 v.s. 18.4618.4618.46) to only 2.742.742.74 (27.2027.2027.20 v.s. 24.4624.4624.46) BLEU points.\nThe promising results demonstrate that the proposed\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning method can produce higher quality translations\nby enforcing sentence-level consistency and optimizing the non-differentiable test metric. Comparing speedups, our method obtains the greatest speedup of 17.46√ó17.46\\times over the\nautoregressive counterpart, with latency significantly reduced from 251.4‚Äãm‚Äãs251.4ùëöùë†251.4ms to only 14.4‚Äãm‚Äãs14.4ùëöùë†14.4ms.\nPrevious works often rely on adding extra components, e.g. iterative refinement 2, autoregressive submodule 3, or CTC decoder , on the Transformer to achieve better generation quality,\nwhich, however, inevitably sacrifice the decoding speed.\nOur method adds no extra components except the lightweight length predictor, and therefore is able to maximize the decoding speedup.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: We compare our model with the following non-autoregressive methods.\nNAT with fertility [ref]5 is the first to propose non-autoregressive neural machine translation, which predicts input token\nfertilities as a latent variable.\nLatent Transformer (LT) 3 incorporates an autoregressive\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
