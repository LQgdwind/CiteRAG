Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

For simplicity, we stick to the Nash_VI viewpoint here. Result similar to Theorem 1 also holds for Nash Q-learning ., where the numbers of states and actions are finite and small. Please see Appendix B for a detailed discussion on the connections of these algorithms. When replacing the œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon-greedy exploration with optimistic exploration (typically in the form of constructing upper confidence bounds), both Nash_VI and Nash_VI_Exploiter are guaranteed to efficiently find the Nash equilibria of MGs in the tabular settings. For tabular Markov games, the optimistic versions of both Nash_VI and Nash_VI_Exploiter can find œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon-approximate Nash equilibria in poly‚Äã(S,A,B,(1‚àíŒ≥)‚àí1,œµ‚àí1,log‚Å°(1/Œ¥))polyùëÜùê¥ùêµsuperscript1ùõæ1superscriptitalic-œµ11ùõø\\text{poly}(S,A,B,(1-\\gamma)^{-1},\\epsilon^{-1},\\log(1/\\delta)) steps with probability at least 1‚àíŒ¥1ùõø1-\\delta. Here SùëÜS is the size of states, A,Bùê¥ùêµA,B are the size of two players‚Äô actions respectively, and Œ≥ùõæ\\gamma is the discount factor. We defer the proof of Theorem 1 to Appendix B. We highlight that, in contrast, existing deep MARL algorithms such as NFSP  or PSRO  are incapable of efficient learning of Nash equilibria with a polynomial convergence rate for tabular Markov games.\nOur simulation results reveal that they are indeed highly inefficient in finding Nash equilibria.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: minibatch size |‚Ñ≥|‚Ñ≥|{\\mathcal{M}}| and number of steps for GD mùëöm, both our algorithms Nash_DQN and Nash_DQN_Exploiter reduce to the œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon-greedy version of standard algorithm Nash_VI [ref]28 and Nash_VI_Exploiter  for learning tabular Markov games222With an alternative choice of (|‚Ñ≥|,m)‚Ñ≥ùëö(|{\\mathcal{M}}|,m), we can also reduce Nash_DQN to Nash Q-learning in the tabular setting.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
