      "content": "Paper Title: Length-Controllable Image Captioning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDespite the remarkable performance achieved by current SOTA AIC models, fewer efforts have been made towards improving the diversity of image captions. In [ref]11, the authors trained a Part-of-Speech predictor and performed sampling base on its predictions to obtain diverse image captions. Chen et al.  proposed to control the image captions though the Abstract Scene Graph of the image. Cornia et al. [ref]9 used different image regions to generated region-specific image captions. However, they rely on additional tools or annotations to provide supervision. Besides, some GAN [ref]16-based methods have also appeared   , most of which improve on diversity, but suffer on accuracy and do not provide controllability over the decoding process. Some other works attempted to generate image captions with controllable styles. These methods require additional training data, such as an image caption dataset with additional style annotations   , which is scarce and expensive; or a large corpus of styled text without aligned images  , which often leads to unsatisfied caption quality. As discussed in Section 1, length is an important property for image captions. It is easy to acquire and is strongly associated with the structure of the image caption. Several approaches in the Natural Language Processing field have visited the length-controllable text generation setting. Kikuchi et al.  proposed to control the length of output in Neural Sentence Summarization task by: 1) performing beam search without [EOS] token until the desired length is reached; 2) setting a length range and manually discarding out-of-range sequences; 3) feeding an embedding into the decoder in each step to indicate the remained length; 4) incorporating the desired length information by multiplying the length with the initial hidden state. However, the first strategy may not produce completed sentences, and the results will have similar style since the model is not aware of the desired length during decoding. The second strategy may require a large beam size to obtain a valid result, and the diversity of the results is also limited. The last two strategies seeks to control the exact length of the output sentence, which is hard in practice and restricts the flexibility of the results. Moreover, the third strategy is only applicable in autoregressive text generation models. Similarly, Liu et al.  proposed to control the exact length of the output in ConvSeq2Seq models . They adopted a similar way as the last strategy of  that incorporate the desired length information when initializing the decoder state. As a result, they face the same problems as in .\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: Despite the remarkable performance achieved by current SOTA AIC models, fewer efforts have been made towards improving the diversity of image captions.
