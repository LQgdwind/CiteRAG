In the recent works [ref]7 and ,\nConlon, Fox, et al. established and explored a tight connection\nbetween set-coloring Ramsey numbers and error-correcting codes.\nTherefore, one may expect that the main results obtained in this paper\nwould be useful for deriving some nontrivial asymptotic bound for set-coloring Ramsey numbers. It is known that for all integers q≥2𝑞2q\\geq 2,\nif 1−q−1≤δ<11superscript𝑞1𝛿11-q^{-1}\\leq\\delta<1, then Rq​(δ)=0subscript𝑅𝑞𝛿0R_{q}(\\delta)=0.\nThe exact value of Rq​(δ)subscript𝑅𝑞𝛿R_{q}(\\delta), however, is not known\nfor any integer q≥2𝑞2q\\geq 2 and real number δ∈(0,1−q−1)𝛿01superscript𝑞1\\delta\\in(0,1-q^{-1}).\nA famous lower bound for Rq​(δ)subscript𝑅𝑞𝛿R_{q}(\\delta)\nis the following q𝑞q-ary asymptotic Gilbert–Varshamov bound\n3,  for all integers q≥2𝑞2q\\geq 2 and 0<δ<1−q−10𝛿1superscript𝑞10<\\delta<1-q^{-1}. Although it was obtained in the 1950s by simple combinatorial arguments in 3\nor with the probabilistic method in ,\nthe q𝑞q-ary asymptotic Gilbert–Varshamov bound RGV​(δ,q)subscript𝑅GV𝛿𝑞R_{\\mathrm{GV}}(\\delta,q) was thought for a long time\nthat it would be equal to the rate function Rq​(δ)subscript𝑅𝑞𝛿R_{q}(\\delta). Let 𝔽qsubscript𝔽𝑞\\mathbb{F}_{q} be a finite field with q𝑞q elements, where q𝑞q is a prime power.\nA q𝑞q-ary code 𝒞⊆𝔽qn𝒞superscriptsubscript𝔽𝑞𝑛{\\cal C}\\subseteq\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n} with length n𝑛n is called linear\nif it is a subspace of the vector space 𝔽qnsuperscriptsubscript𝔽𝑞𝑛\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n} over 𝔽qsubscript𝔽𝑞\\mathbb{F}_{q}.\nIn 1981, Goppa 5 found a remarkable connection\nbetween algebraic curves over 𝔽qsubscript𝔽𝑞\\mathbb{F}_{q} and q𝑞q-ary linear codes\nand showed, through the Riemann–Roch theorem, that a better code can be obtained\nfrom an algebraic curve over 𝔽qsubscript𝔽𝑞\\mathbb{F}_{q} with more rational points given its genus.\nIn 1982, by using Goppa codes 5 from algebraic curves over finite fields,\nTsfasman, Vladut, and Zink  employed the classic modular curves and the Shimura curves,\nand successfully improved the Gilbert–Varshamov bound RGV​(δ,q)subscript𝑅GV𝛿𝑞R_{\\mathrm{GV}}(\\delta,q)\nfor q𝑞q being a prime power of p2superscript𝑝2p^{2} (p≥7𝑝7p\\geq 7)\nand of p4superscript𝑝4p^{4} (p≥3𝑝3p\\geq 3)\nand δ𝛿\\delta in an open subinterval of (0,1−q−1)01superscript𝑞1(0,1-q^{-1}).\nThis discovery was the first breakthrough after over twenty years of searching for a lower bound\nto beat the Gilbert–Varshamov bound RGV​(δ,q)subscript𝑅GV𝛿𝑞R_{\\mathrm{GV}}(\\delta,q) for certain q𝑞q and δ𝛿\\delta. We are going to present briefly theory of Goppa codes from algebraic curves over finite fields.\nThe following work in this paper on lower bounds of the rate function\nwill be based on Lenstra codes from geometry of numbers, which can be viewed as\nbeing analogous to Goppa codes. In 1982, Manin  firstly described such connection for algebraic geometers with some arising unsolved problems for drawing their attention.\nIn 1982, Ihara 9 defined the following number where Nq​(g)subscript𝑁𝑞𝑔N_{q}(g) is the maximum number of rational points\nthat a non-singular absolutely irreducible algebraic curve over 𝔽qsubscript𝔽𝑞\\mathbb{F}_{q} of genus g𝑔g\ncan have.\nIhara’s number A​(q)𝐴𝑞A(q) is well-defined by the Hasse–Weil theorem,\nnamely, the Riemann hypothesis for algebraic curves over finite fields\n.\nIhara 9 obtained that\nA​(q)≥q−1𝐴𝑞𝑞1A(q)\\geq\\sqrt{q}-1 when q=p2​m𝑞superscript𝑝2𝑚q=p^{2m}, p𝑝p prime and m∈ℕ𝑚ℕm\\in\\mathbb{N},\nand provided an upper bound for A​(q)𝐴𝑞A(q) for all q𝑞q being a prime power.\nIt has been proved that Goppa codes imply (see Manin [26, p. 718]) for all q𝑞q being a prime power\nand 0<δ<10𝛿10<\\delta<1.\nAccording to Manin [26, p. 719],\nthe work in Tsfasman, Vladut, and Zink ,\nindependently of the earlier Ihara’s work 7, 8\nin the 1970s on towers of curves over 𝔽qsubscript𝔽𝑞\\mathbb{F}_{q},\nshowed that A​(q)≥q−1𝐴𝑞𝑞1A(q)\\geq\\sqrt{q}-1 when q=p2𝑞superscript𝑝2q=p^{2} or q=p4𝑞superscript𝑝4q=p^{4}, p𝑝p prime,\nand hence from (3) that the Gilbert–Varshamov bound RGV​(δ,q)subscript𝑅GV𝛿𝑞R_{\\mathrm{GV}}(\\delta,q) was improved\nfor q=p2𝑞superscript𝑝2q=p^{2} (p≥7𝑝7p\\geq 7)\nor q=p4𝑞superscript𝑝4q=p^{4} (p≥3𝑝3p\\geq 3)\nand δ𝛿\\delta in an interval of (δ1,δ2)subscript𝛿1subscript𝛿2(\\delta_{1},\\delta_{2}) including q−12​q−1𝑞12𝑞1\\frac{q-1}{2q-1}\n(see [49, p. 28]).\nIt is noted that a better upper bound of A​(q)𝐴𝑞A(q) was also obtained,\nwhich is called as the Drinfeld–Vladut bound ,\nasserting that A​(q)≤q−1𝐴𝑞𝑞1A(q)\\leq\\sqrt{q}-1 for all q𝑞q being a prime power.\nIt had improved a previous upper bound of Ihara 9.\nThe Drinfeld–Vladut bound is tight when q=p2​m𝑞superscript𝑝2𝑚q=p^{2m}, p𝑝p prime and m∈ℕ𝑚ℕm\\in\\mathbb{N},\nfrom the aforementioned lower bound of A​(q)𝐴𝑞A(q) due to Ihara 9. Goppa codes from algebraic curves over finite fields are also called as algebraic geometry codes\n(see the monographs  and ).\nIt is well-known that algebraic curves over 𝔽qsubscript𝔽𝑞\\mathbb{F}_{q} can be equivalently replaced\nin the language of algebraic function fields over 𝔽qsubscript𝔽𝑞\\mathbb{F}_{q} .\nIn the case of q𝑞q being an even power of a prime,\nGarcia and Stichtenoth 2\nfound an alternative approach with the Artin–Schreier tower of algebraic function fields over 𝔽qsubscript𝔽𝑞\\mathbb{F}_{q}\nto attain the Drinfeld–Vladut bound.\nWhen q𝑞q is an odd power of a prime but not a prime with q>125𝑞125q>125,\nBassa, Beelen, Garcia, and Stichtenoth \nshowed that the Gilbert–Varshamov bound RGV​(δ,q)subscript𝑅GV𝛿𝑞R_{\\mathrm{GV}}(\\delta,q) can also be improved\nby using appropriate infinite towers of algebraic function fields over finite fields 𝔽qsubscript𝔽𝑞\\mathbb{F}_{q}. In 1983, Serre 8, 9 demonstrated that\nthere exists a constant c>0𝑐0c>0 such that\nA​(q)≥1c​log⁡q𝐴𝑞1𝑐𝑞A(q)\\geq\\frac{1}{c}\\log q\nfor any integer q≥2𝑞2q\\geq 2 being a prime power,\nby using class field theory for algebraic function fields over 𝔽qsubscript𝔽𝑞\\mathbb{F}_{q}\n(see also the recent monograph by Serre ).\nThis bound is still the best known lower bound for A​(q)𝐴𝑞A(q) in general for q𝑞q being a prime.\nBy using (3), we have the following Serre’s lower bound for any integer q≥2𝑞2q\\geq 2 being a prime power and 0<δ<1−q−10𝛿1superscript𝑞10<\\delta<1-q^{-1}.\nIt was shown in Niederreiter and Xing 2\nthat the constant c𝑐c in (4)\ncan be chosen as 96​log⁡296296\\log 2 for q≥2𝑞2q\\geq 2 being a prime power\nor 75​log⁡275275\\log 2 for q≥224𝑞superscript224q\\geq 2^{24} being a prime power.\nWith this explicit constant c𝑐c,\nit can be checked that Serre’s lower bound (4)\nis not better than the Gilbert–Varshamov bound RGV​(δ,q)subscript𝑅GV𝛿𝑞R_{\\mathrm{GV}}(\\delta,q) for any integer q𝑞q being a prime\nand 0<δ<1−q−10𝛿1superscript𝑞10<\\delta<1-q^{-1}. In 1985, Zinoviev and Litsyn  demonstrated that\nthe algebraic geometry codes can be modified by an alphabet reduction procedure\nto improve the q𝑞q-ary Gilbert–Varshamov bound RGV​(δ,q)subscript𝑅GV𝛿𝑞R_{\\mathrm{GV}}(\\delta,q)\nat the specific tangent point\nδ=δ0=def(q−1)/(q′+q−1)∈(0,1)𝛿subscript𝛿0superscriptdef𝑞1superscript𝑞′𝑞101\\delta=\\delta_{0}\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle\\mathrm{def}}}{{=}}(q-1)/(q^{\\prime}+q-1)\\in(0,1)\nof the curve RGV​(δ,q)subscript𝑅GV𝛿𝑞R_{\\mathrm{GV}}(\\delta,q) for all q≥46𝑞46q\\geq 46,\nwhere q′superscript𝑞′q^{\\prime} is the cardinality of the alphabet for the applied algebraic geometry codes\n(see also , [47, p. 267, Theorem 4.5.36.]).\nNote that q′superscript𝑞′q^{\\prime} is a prime power but not a prime in the application .\nIt is mentioned that a relevant and more recent work is presented by Elkies in 2001 0. We note that if q=p𝑞𝑝q=p is a generic prime,\nit is not possible that\nthe tangent point δ0subscript𝛿0\\delta_{0}\ncan cover the value δ=1/2𝛿12\\delta=1/2 for almost all p𝑝p.\nIf δ0=1/2subscript𝛿012\\delta_{0}=1/2 or is very close to 1/2121/2, then the prime p=q′+1𝑝superscript𝑞′1p=q^{\\prime}+1 or is very close to q′+1superscript𝑞′1q^{\\prime}+1.\nAssume that p≤N𝑝𝑁p\\leq N, where the positive integer N𝑁N is large.\nThere are at least Ω​(N/log⁡N)Ω𝑁𝑁\\Omega(N/\\log N) primes p𝑝p between 2 and N𝑁N,\nwhile there are at most O​(N1/2/log⁡N)𝑂superscript𝑁12𝑁O(N^{1/2}/\\log N) prime powers q′superscript𝑞′q^{\\prime},\nwhich is not a prime, between 1 and 2​N2𝑁2N.\nTherefore, it cannot be true that p=q′+1𝑝superscript𝑞′1p=q^{\\prime}+1 or is very close to q′+1superscript𝑞′1q^{\\prime}+1\nfor almost all primes p𝑝p.\nHence, there are infinitely many primes p𝑝p for which\nδ0subscript𝛿0\\delta_{0} cannot cover the value δ=1/2𝛿12\\delta=1/2 for q=p𝑞𝑝q=p.\nNext, if q𝑞q is a generic non-prime-power positive integer, then the finite field 𝔽qsubscript𝔽𝑞\\mathbb{F}_{q}\nwith q𝑞q elements does not exist.\nIn the same spirit, we can see that there are infinitely many such q𝑞q for which\nthe tangent point δ0subscript𝛿0\\delta_{0} cannot cover the value δ=1/2𝛿12\\delta=1/2. Based on the above analysis of previously obtained results in the existing literature,\nit can be stated that the q𝑞q-ary Gilbert–Varshamov bound RGV​(δ,q)subscript𝑅GV𝛿𝑞R_{\\mathrm{GV}}(\\delta,q)\nat δ=1/2𝛿12\\delta=1/2, i.e., RGV​(1/2,q)subscript𝑅GV12𝑞R_{\\mathrm{GV}}(1/2,q),\nremains the currently largest known lower bound of the rate function Rq​(δ)subscript𝑅𝑞𝛿R_{q}(\\delta)\nat δ=1/2𝛿12\\delta=1/2, i.e., Rq​(1/2)subscript𝑅𝑞12R_{q}(1/2),\nfor infinitely many positive integers q𝑞q\nwhich is a generic prime and which is a generic non-prime-power integer.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: better a lower bound for the rate function Rq​(δ)subscript𝑅𝑞𝛿R_{q}(\\delta) exists,\nthe larger the error-exponent can be achieved by a sequence of error-correcting codes.
