      "content": "Paper Title: GraphFramEx: Towards Systematic Evaluation of Explainability Methods for Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe describe the setup and implementation details for the explainability procedure. See Appendix¬†B for more details on the datasets statistics, the methods and the experimental protocol. Datasets. Synthetic datasets We use type 1 synthetic datasets introduced by¬†[ref]46. We refer the reader to Appendix¬†A.6 to learn more about the 3 classes of existing synthetic datasets in explainability for GNNs. Ground truth explanations are available. Real datasets We use 10 publicly available datasets to evaluate our framework on real graphs: the citation network datasets¬†[ref]45, the Facebook Page-Page network dataset¬†[ref]29, the actor-only induced subgraph of the film-director-actor-writer network¬†, the WebKB datasets¬†, and the Wikipedia networks¬†[ref]29. We use the code accessible in Pytorch geometric. eBay We test our evaluation framework on a real-world eBay transaction graph dataset. This is a binary node classification task where transaction nodes are labeled as legit or fraudulent. The objective is to explain fraudulent nodes. The eBay graph dataset is a very large sampled real-world dataset with 289k nodes (208k transaction nodes) and 1% of all nodes (1.48% of transaction nodes) are fraudulent. This is a typical example of a rare event detection task. GNN models. By default, we use the graph convolutional networks (GCN)¬†. Besides GCN, we also evaluate explainability methods on graph attention networks (GAT)¬† and graph isomorphism networks (GIN)¬†. Results using GAT and GIN models are presented in Appendix¬†C. Explainers. To explain the decisions made by the GNNs, we adopt different classes of explainers including structure-based methods, gradient/feature-based methods and perturbation-based methods. We refer the reader to Appendix¬†A.3 for the full taxonomy and to Appendix¬†B.2 for more details on the explainability methods. In our experiments, we compare the following methods: Random gives every edge and node feature a random value between 0 and 1; Distance assigns higher importance to edges that have lower distance to the target node; PageRank measures the importance of edges following the personalized PageRank strategy with automatic restart on the target node¬† ; Saliency (SA) measures node importance as the weight on every node after computing the gradient of the output with respect to node features¬†; Integrated Gradient (IG) avoids the saturation problem of the gradient-based method Saliency by accumulating gradients over the path from a baseline input (zero-vector) and the input at hand¬†; Grad-CAM is a generalization of class activation maps (CAM)¬†; Occlusion attributes the importance of an edge as the difference of the model initial prediction prediction on the graph after removing this edge¬†; GNNExplainer computes the importance of graph entities (node/edge/node feature) using the mutual information¬†[ref]46; PGExplainer is very similar to GNNExplainer, but generates explanations only for the graph structure (nodes/edges) using the reparameterization trick to overcome computation intractability¬†; PGM-Explainer perturbs the input and uses probabilistic graphical models to find the dependencies between the nodes and the output¬†; and SubgraphX explores possible explanatory subgraphs with Monte Carlo Tree Search and assigns them a score using the Shapley value¬†. Protocol. In this work, we focus on node classification tasks and compare local, that is input-level, explainability methods. We train one of the three GNN models. Once trained, we use the GNN to do predictions on a testing set. Explanations are then eventually transformed with the topk strategy. We evaluate the methods with the fidelity measures and the characterization score with equal weights w+subscriptùë§w_{+} = w‚àísubscriptùë§w_{-} = 0.5 in four different settings defined as the combinations of the two possible focus, phenomenon and model, and mask nature, hard or soft masks.\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: procedure.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
