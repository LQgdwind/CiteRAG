      "content": "Paper Title: Elucidating Robust Learning with Uncertainty-Aware Corruption Pattern Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe then examine the ability of our method to estimate noise transition matrices per each group where we partition the training data into multiple sets using the predicted aleatoric uncertainty in Section 5.3.2.\nWe first evaluate Average total variance and Kendall-Tau distance on estimated ambiguous set comparing with Noise-Adaptation  and DivideMix [ref]24 same as Section 5.3.2. For Noise-Adaptation , we average the estimated noise transition matrix on the estimated set. For DivideMix [ref]24 we average the softmax output to obtain the estimated noise transition matrix since the softmax output can be seen as a confidence score that can be interpreted as a noise ratio. We cannot use a confusion matrix for this setting because the noise transition matrix is estimated on an unseen test set. The noise transition matrix is defined as follows: where f‚Äã(ùê±)ùëìùê±f(\\mathbf{x}) is a prediction, P^^ùëÉ\\hat{P} is a soft-max output. The experimental results shown in Table 11. Except for Symmetry-20% on the Dirty-MNIST dataset, the proposed method outperforms the compared method. The gap increases as the noise ratio increases since other methods have a tendency to have overconfident estimates even if the noise ratio is high. Furthermore, the estimated noise transition matrix is illustrated in Figure 8 and 9 on the Dirty-MNIST and Dirty-CIFAR10 datasets respectively.\nEach quarter of the figure denotes a single experiment for each corruption pattern, with the upper and lower rows showing the predicted noise transition matrix and the ground truth, respectively. Here, clean labels on the ambiguous set denote the ground-truth label of each instance after ambiguating the instances. We can see that our proposed method is able to correctly estimate the noise transition matrix for both clan and ambiguous sets in terms of a row-wise ranking manner. Furthermore, Figure 9 suggests that our proposed method can also capture the noise-induced in inputs (i.e., CutMix¬†[ref]30). In other words, the images of cats are cut-mixed with the images of dogs (and vice versa), and these corruption patterns are well captured by the noise transition matrix.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: the predicted aleatoric uncertainty in Section 5.3.2.\nWe first evaluate Average total variance and Kendall-Tau distance on estimated ambiguous set comparing with Noise-Adaptation  and DivideMix [ref]24 same as Section 5.3.2.
