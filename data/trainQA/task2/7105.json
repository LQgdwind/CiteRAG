      "content": "Paper Title: A Computing-in-Memory-based One-Class Hyperdimensional Computing Model for Outlier Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe evaluate the performance of ODHD on six datasets selected from the Outlier Detection Datasets (ODDS) Library  spanning multiple application domains such as medical diagnosis and wireless communication. These datasets are Wisconsin-Breast Cancer (Diagnostics) dataset (WBC), Mammography (MAMMO), MNIST, Cardiotocography (CARDIO), lymphography (LYMPHO), and Landsat Satellite (SATI2). These datasets are widely used as benchmarks in existing outlier detection studies  . Each dataset contains a certain number of outliers specified by the ODDS library, e.g., the WBC dataset has 21 outliers. The testing dataset is mixed inliers and outliers, e.g., 25%−75%percent25percent7525\\%-75\\% outlier - inlier mix. More details of these datasets can be found on the (ODDS) Library website . We repeat the experiments independently 10 times and report the average performance. We also present error bars as shown in Fig. 5 to illustrate the performance variations due to the randomness in different learning methods. We compare our modified ODHD implemented on IM-ODHD discussed in Sec. 4.2 with the original ODHD algorithm proposed in  and discussed in Sec. 3, as well as with the following four baseline outlier detection methods: Autoencoder: Autoencoder is an emerging unsupervised learning outlier detection approach based on a neural network. In this paper, we use the same autoencoder architecture as . Isolation Forest: Isolation Forest is an ensemble model of isolation trees, which uses the path length of each sample to detect outliers. In this paper, we establish an isolation forest model using the same configuration as . OCSVM: OCSVM attempts to separate outliers from the inliers with the maximum margin. We have a grid search for an appropriate set of hyper-parameters such as kernel functions and the value of gamma to fine-tune the OCSVM model following . HDAD: HDAD follows similar principles of autoencoder; it first “reconstruct” the input samples and then detects anomalies based on reconstruction error. We use the same architecture of  . We implement ODHD and the four baseline methods in Python and perform our experiments on a desktop with an i7-7700 CPU, 12 GB RAM, and an NVIDIA P1000 GPU with 4 GB onboard memory. We implement the GPU version ODHD based on Pytorch and use the HWiNFO tool [ref]29 to measure energy consumption. HWiNFO is a commercial tool for monitoring hardware circumstances and has been utilized in previous work   .  Unlike traditional DNN operations such as the Conv2D layer, the GPU version of ODHD does not have a specialized data flow or CUDA optimization. In the GPU implementation, the most time-consuming part is data transfer between the CPU and GPU memory. Since the HV are high-dimension vectors, the GPU acceleration can be slowed down by the data transfer. According to our experimental results, the GPU version of ODHD provides ∼similar-to\\sim2–2.5×\\times time efficiency compared with the CPU version of ODHD, which is consistent with the results presented in torchHD [ref]32. To comprehensively assess the algorithm-level performance of ODHD, we use three metrics: accuracy (ACC), F1 score (F1), and Area under ROC curve ROC-AUC (AUC). Note that while accuracy is widely used and easy to understand, an outlier detection dataset may be significantly imbalanced. Hence, accuracy may not precisely reveal the performance of outlier detectors. Therefore, we also use ROC-AUC, which is widely used for outlier detection as it can accurately represent the tradeoff between true positive and false positive . Meanwhile, the F1 score is also a widely-used metric in binary classification which can comprehensively indicate the tradeoff between precision and recall .\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: and perform our experiments on a desktop with an i7-7700 CPU, 12 GB RAM, and an NVIDIA P1000 GPU with 4 GB onboard memory.
