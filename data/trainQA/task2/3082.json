      "content": "Paper Title: NTD: Non-Transferability Enabled Backdoor Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn a backdoor attack, an attacker first inserts a backdoor into a victim model and this backdoored model is denoted as FΘb​dsuperscriptsubscript𝐹Θ𝑏𝑑F_{\\Theta}^{bd}. This model behaves normally when predicting clean inputs (samples) without any trigger, denoted as z=FΘb​d​(x)𝑧superscriptsubscript𝐹Θ𝑏𝑑𝑥z=F_{\\Theta}^{bd}(x), where x𝑥x is a clean input and z𝑧z is a correct (ground-truth) label. In this case,\nthe inference accuracy of the backdoored model is comparable to that of its clean model counterpart (FΘsubscript𝐹ΘF_{\\Theta}). Thus, it is infeasible to detect the backdoor by observing the inference accuracy for clean inputs. If an input contains a trigger (t𝑡t) that is embedded by an attacker, the backdoored model will be hijacked to classify the trigger input into an attacker-targeted label. Considering an administrator in a face recognition task, zt=FΘb​d​(x+t)subscript𝑧𝑡superscriptsubscript𝐹Θ𝑏𝑑𝑥𝑡z_{t}=F_{\\Theta}^{bd}(x+t) is the attacker-targeted label and t𝑡t stands for the trigger. This can be measured by the attack success rate that is usually high, e.g., close to 100% to ensure the attack efficacy once it is launched. Notably, the prerequisite of the backdoor attack is first to tamper the clean model FΘsubscript𝐹ΘF_{\\Theta}, inserting a backdoor into it, and this results in a backdoored model FΘb​dsuperscriptsubscript𝐹Θ𝑏𝑑F_{\\Theta}^{bd}. Thus, opposed to the adversarial example attack, the backdoor attack does not have transferability because it must firstly tamper the victim model to implant a specific backdoor. Backdoor attacks against DL were first revealed in 2017  [ref]23. Since then, it has received extreme attention from both academic and industry due to its severe consequences and realistic attack scenarios. The attack can be stealthily resulted from data collection, model training outsourcing, and collaborative learning (e.g., federated learning) .\nConsidering the severe consequences of backdoor attacks, great efforts have been made in detecting or eliminating backdoors both from either offline inspection      or online inspection  [ref]26 [ref]14. Backdoor Type. \nBackdoor attacks have different backdoor types and most existing defenses focus on defending against source-agnostic backdoor attacks. In such an attack, any input regardless of its source class containing the trigger will activate the backdoor residing in a victim model. There are other backdoor types and the representative one is source-specific backdoor attack. The backdoor is activated not only when the trigger is embedded within the input but also when input is selected from attacker-chosen source classes. If the input is from a non-source class, the backdoor does not exhibit even though the input is with the trigger. The source-specific backdoor attack is challenging  to defeat as most countermeasures including  [ref]14  are ineffective against it. Trigger Type. \nMost defenses have strong assumptions on the trigger types, such as size and pattern, which may not be held in practice. For example, the trigger size could be overlaid with the entire image input with certain transparency, which trivially makes many defenses ineffective  [ref]26. Instead of targeting a label with a single trigger, multiple triggers can be used to target the same label, which is beyond the assumption of [ref]14 that cannot be detected. In addition, Neural Cleanse is less effective when the trigger pattern becomes complicated  or belongs to the feature-space based trigger attack [ref]14.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: attack, the backdoor attack does not have transferability because it must firstly tamper the victim model to implant a specific backdoor.
