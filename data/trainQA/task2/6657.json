Based on the DeepXplore’s coverage metric, Tian et al.  propose DeepTest, which is used to generate test cases to explore DNN behaviors. Noticing DeepXplore is coarse-grained, Ma et al.  propose DeepGuage, which tests DNN by fine-grained metrics. Based on the DeepGauge , Ma et al.  propose DeepMutation  and DeepMutation++ , these techniques are used to mutate test case to explore model incorrect behaviors.  Odena et al. [ref]29 also uses metrics proposed by the above-mentioned coverage metric to generate test cases. Since the test cases generated are not always useful, and feeding all test cases into the model is time-consuming and the benign selection strategies used by coverage metrics are also time-consuming, Based on the above-mentioned testing techniques, some automated testing techniques 1 [ref]29   [ref]5   are proposed to generate test inputs towards explore DNN incorrect behaviours.\nIn addition, while the neuron coverage guided testing techniques are widely studied, the existing work  [ref]25   found that using NC-guided testing can not detect all types of faults in DNN. Such findings motivate this work that proposes a new type of test unit, i.e., feature map, to detect more types of faults that are not detected by neuron criteria testing techniques.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: fine-grained metrics.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
