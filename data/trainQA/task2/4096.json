Deep equilibrium models assume that the forward iterations in (6) are run until convergence to the fixed point ùê±‚àósuperscriptùê±\\mathbf{x}^{*} that satisfies ùê±‚àó=ùíØ‚Äã(ùê±‚àó,Œ∏)superscriptùê±ùíØsuperscriptùê±ùúÉ\\mathbf{x}^{*}=\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbf{x}^{*},\\theta).\nThis approach allows one to compute the back-propagation steps using fixed-point iterations [ref]23  with just one physical layer. Unlike unrolled methods, the convergence of the forward and backward iterations are key to maintaining the accuracy of backpropagation in DEQ methods. The convergence of such algorithms are analyzed in  [ref]10. In the general case with a full-rank ùêÄùêÄ\\mathbf{A} considered in [ref]10, convergence of the forward-backward splitting (FBS) algorithm in (6) is guaranteed when the Lipschitz constant of ‚ÑãŒ∏subscript‚ÑãùúÉ\\mathcal{H}_{\\theta} satisfies L‚Äã[‚ÑãŒ∏]‚â§2‚ÄãŒºmin/(Œºmax‚àíŒºmin)ùêødelimited-[]subscript‚ÑãùúÉ2subscriptùúáminsubscriptùúámaxsubscriptùúáminL[\\mathcal{H}_{\\theta}]\\leq 2\\mu_{\\rm min}/(\\mu_{\\rm max}-\\mu_{\\rm min}), where Œºmaxsubscriptùúámax\\mu_{\\rm max} and Œºminsubscriptùúámin\\mu_{\\rm min} are the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of ùêÄH‚ÄãùêÄsuperscriptùêÄùêªùêÄ\\mathbf{A}^{H}\\mathbf{A} [ref]10.
