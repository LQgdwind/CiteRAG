      "content": "Paper Title: Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning Models: A Comparative Study on a Decade of Sinhala Language Facebook Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMany of the currently available studies on sentiment analysis aim to understand the market for various products and services.\nThe work of Fang and Zhan  is seminal on product review analysis. It introduces a procedure for sentiment polarity categorization of product reviews, in which the sentiment analysis is carried out at a phrase-level. Phrases and words that convey a sentiment are identified as sentiment tokens, for which a sentiment score is calculated following the popular star rating model. Feature vectors developed using them are then used for predicting the sentiment polarity of previously unseen product reviews.\nThe study by De Silva et al. 0 also tackles the same problem, but at an aspect level. It calculates sentiment values separately for each aspect included in a review. An important property of this study is that it takes into account several semantic features such as negations, sentiment enhancements, sentiment shifts, and groups of words. This helps to increase the accuracy of transforming the sentiments embedded in text into mathematical values. The method proposed by De Silva et al. 0 has been tested for the corpus we derive the reaction sentiment data set from by Jayawickrama et al. [ref]5. Wang et al.  present a multitude of deep neural network architectures that combines CNNs and RNNs for sentiment analysis. These models exploit the key characteristics of both types of neural networks by using CNN layers to capture lower order features and RNN layers to capture higher order features. Though the study was originally conducted for capturing sentiments included in short text, the models included exhibit great performance in sentiment analysis even for longer text. This study was carried out using, reaction sentiment data set which is a corpus composed of Facebook posts and their metadata. Numerous researchers have taken a similar path before, including Pool and Nissim [ref]6 and Freeman et al. 1 who utilized Facebook data sets for sentiment detection. However, the work by Freeman et al. 1 is limited to a narrow scope of scholarly articles on Facebook. On the contrary, Pool and Nissim [ref]6 has used a more generalized data set consisting of a wide range of sources. The authors explain the motive behind this choice as the need to choose the optimum sources to train machine learning models for each Facebook reaction. Additionally, the authors have conducted research on models with features such as TF-IDF, n-grams, and embeddings. A detailed comparison of the models is presented by them, which provides valuable insight into their use cases. While the aforementioned studies provide useful insight into sentiment analysis, there is a major barrier that our study has to face that many of them might find unfamiliar. Most of those research work relate to the English language, which is resource-rich. In contrast, our study relates to Sinhala language, which could be considered a resource-poor language in the NLP domain . Research work related to sentiment analysis in Sinhala are highly limited, and most of the initiated research studies in this arena were abandoned or not released to the public . The Sencat sentiment analyzer by Demotte et al.  is the current state-of-the-art model for Sinhala sentiment analysis. The tool was originally trained using a data set comprising of 15,0591505915,059 purely Sinhala news comments. The sentiment classification of news comments is done at the document-level, under the assumption that the whole document represents a single emotion.\nSencat has been presented in two formats, namely:1) Binary Class Classification: Positive and Negative 2) Multi Class Classification: Positive, Negative, Neutral, and Conflict\nIn the case of multi class classification, news comments that display neither positive nor negative emotion are assigned to the Neutral class while comments that display both positive and negative emotions are classified as Conflict.\nPrior to introducing sentiment categorization, Demotte et al.  have tested the performance of several sentiment analysis tools built using deep learning techniques against a data set composed of Sinhala news comments  which they published earlier. Jayawickrama et al. [ref]5, on the other hand, have introduced a set of simple machine learning models for sentiment analysis in Sinhala.In which they have introduced three models that have been developed specifically targeting sentiment analysis with Facebook data, and has been tested with the reaction sentiment data set which we use in this study. A simple procedure of using the average of sentiment vectors of previously seen data to predict that of unseen data is utilized in these models. All Reaction Set Model and Core Reaction Set Model attempt to predict the distribution of Facebook reactions while the Star Rating Model concatenates reactions into a single value representing where it would fall in the scale between extreme positivity and extreme negativity.\nThe work of Medagoda et al. 2, although dated a few years back, provides an insightful exploration of the applicability of tools available for resource-rich languages to resource-poor languages such as Sinhala.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: sentiments embedded in text into mathematical values.
