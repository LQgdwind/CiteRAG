We only use the images from the ImageNet¬† dataset (1.3 million images) for all parts of the CutLER model and do not use any type of annotations either for training or any supervised pretrained models. MaskCut. We use MaskCut with three stages on images resized to 480√ó\\times480 pixels and compute a patch-wise affinity matrix using the ViT-B/8¬†[ref]15 DINO¬†[ref]7 model.\nWe use Conditional Random Field (CRF)¬† to post-process the masks and compute their bounding boxes. Detector. While CutLER is agnostic to the underlying detector, we use popular Mask R-CNN¬†[ref]27 and Cascade Mask R-CNN¬† for all experiments, and use Cascade Mask R-CNN by default, unless otherwise noted.\nWe train the detector on ImageNet with initial masks and bounding boxes for 160160160K iterations with a batch size of 16.\nWhen training the detectors with a ResNet-50 backbone¬†, we initialize the model with the weights of a self-supervised pretrained DINO¬†[ref]7 model.\nWe explored other pre-trained models, including MoCo-v2¬†, SwAV¬†, and CLD¬†6, and found that they gave similar detection performance.\nWe also leverage the copy-paste augmentation¬†  during the model training process. Rather than using the vanilla copy-paste augmentation, to improve the model‚Äôs ability to segment small objects, we randomly downsample the mask with a scalar uniformly sampled between 0.3 and 1.0.\nWe then optimize the detector for 160160160K iterations using SGD with a learning rate of 0.005, which is decreased by 5 after 808080K iterations, and a batch size of 16.\nWe apply a weight decay of 5√ó10‚àí55superscript1055\\!\\times\\!10^{-5} and a momentum of 0.9. Self-training.\nWe initialize the detection model in each stage using the weights from the previous stage. We optimize the detector using SGD with a learning rate of 0.01 for 80KùêæK iterations. Since the self-training stage can provide a sufficient number of pseudo-masks for model training, we don‚Äôt use the DropLoss during the self-training stages. We provide more details on model implementation and training in¬†Sec.¬†A.1.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: for training or any supervised pretrained models.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
