      "content": "Paper Title: OpenHoldem: A Benchmark for Large-Scale Imperfect-Information Game Research\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStandard benchmarks have played an indispensable role in promoting the research in many AI tasks like speech recognition, computer vision, and natural language processing.\nFor example, in the task of speech to text, the NIST Switchboard benchmark  helps reduce the word error rate from 19.3%percent19.319.3\\% in 2000 to 5.5%percent5.55.5\\% in 2017;\nIn the task of image classification, the creation of the ImageNet [ref]26 benchmark has helped in the development of highly efficient models which reduce the image classification error rate from 26.2%percent26.226.2\\% down to 1.8%percent1.81.8\\%;\nIn the task of machine translation, the WMT benchmark helps the machine translation system achieves human-level performance on the Chinese to English translation task .\nThese benchmarks that have greatly influenced the research communities have some common characteristics: clear evaluation metrics, rich baseline models, and convenient online testing platforms.\nMotivated by this, we propose the OpenHoldem benchmark that meets the above requirements to facilitate the future development of general-purpose techniques for large-scale imperfect-information games. There are already some benchmarks on game AI.\nExamples include the Atari environments in OpenAI Gym [ref]28, ViZDoom , and MineRL [ref]30, but most of these benchmarks are oriented towards the research of reinforcement learning algorithms.\nRecently, some benchmarks for game theory research have been proposed.\nFor example, Google DeepMind releases the OpenSpiel  benchmark, which contains a collection of environments and algorithms for research in n-player zero-sum and general-sum games.\nAlthough OpenSpiel implements many different kinds of games and state-of-the-art algorithms, it currently does not provide high-performance NLTH AIs.\nRLCard  developed by the Texas A&M University includes many large-scale complex card games, such as Dou dizhu, Mahjong, UNO, Sheng Ji, and NLTH.\nHowever, most of the implemented baseline AIs are relatively weak.\nIn contrast, the proposed OpenHoldem contains very strong baseline AIs, which can serve as a better starting point for future improvements. Texas Hold’em, the primary testbed for imperfect information game research, has been studied in the computer poker community for years .\nThe earliest Texas Hold’em AIs are rule-based systems that consist of a collection of if-then rules written by human experts.\nFor example, the early agents (e.g., Loki ) produced by the University of Alberta are mostly based on carefully designed rules.\nWhile the rule-based approach provides a simple framework for implementing Texas Hold’em AIs, the resulting handcrafted strategies are easily exploitable by observant opponents.\nSince 2006, the Annual Computer Poker Competition (ACPC)  has greatly facilitated poker AI development, and many game-theoretic Texas Hold’em AIs are proposed  .\nThese systems first use various abstraction strategies   to merge similar game states to reduce the game size, then exploit some equilibrium-finding algorithms (e.g., CFR  and its various variants    ) to find the approximate Nash equilibrium strategies which are robust to different opponents. Recently, the research on these game-theoretic approaches has made significant breakthroughs.\nExamples include DeepStack  proposed by the University of Alberta that defeats professional poker players by a large margin, Libratus  from the Carnegie Mellon University that decisively defeats four top HUNL-specialist professionals, and Pluribus  as a direct descendant of Libratus that defeats elite human professional players in six-player NLTH.\nNevertheless, almost all of these Texas Hold’em AIs are not publicly available, making it very challenging for new researchers to study this problem further.\nOur OpenHoldem is the first open benchmark with publicly available strong baseline AIs for large-scale imperfect-information game research.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: the NIST Switchboard benchmark  helps reduce the word error rate from 19.3%percent19.319.3\\% in 2000 to 5.5%percent5.55.5\\% in 2017;\nIn the task of image classification, the creation of the ImageNet [ref]26 benchmark has helped in the development of highly efficient models which reduce the image classification error rate from 26.2%percent26.226.2\\% down to 1.8%percent1.81.8\\%;\nIn the task of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
