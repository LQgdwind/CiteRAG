Each cell is represented by a DAG with 4 intermediate nodes. Candidate operations between each two nodes are {maxpool, avgpool, skip_connect, sep_conv 3√ó\\times3 and 5√ó\\times5, dil_conv 3√ó\\times3 and 5√ó\\times5}. We exclude {none} operation from the default DARTS search space to satisfy the topology constraint in Eq. 1.\nUnder S0 space, we search and evaluate on CIFAR-10¬† and ImageNet¬†[ref]9 respectively. We also conduct experiments on four reduced search spaces, S1-S4, introduced by R-DARTS¬† to evaluate the stability of our method.\nS1 is a pre-optimized search space, where each edge in the supernet has a predefined set of candidate operations.\nIn the other 3 search spaces, candidate operations on each edge are the same (see the details in the supplementary).\nFollowing¬†, we search and evaluate in these 4 search spaces on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100¬†, and SVHN¬†[ref]26 (12 benchmarks in total). Search settings.\nSimilar to DARTS, the supernet consists of 8 cells with 16 initial channels.\nWe search for 505050 epochs and set the sampling number K=7ùêæ7K=7. Unless explicitly written, ROME-v2 is used by default throughout the paper since it is more efficient and robust. For operation parameters, we use the SGD optimizer with a momentum of 0.9 and an initial l‚Äãrùëôùëülr of 0.050.050.05; For architectural weights, we adopt the Adam optimizer with an initial l‚Äãrùëôùëülr of 3√ó10‚àí43superscript1043\\times 10^{-4}. Evaluation settings.\nWe use standard evaluation settings as DARTS [ref]24 by training the inferred model for 600 epochs using SGD with a batch size of 96.\nFor search space S0, inferred models are constructed by stacking 20 cells with 36 initial channels, and trained under the same settings following¬† [ref]24.\nFor S1-S4, we strictly follow the settings in R-DARTS  for a fair comparison.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: and 5√ó\\times5}. We exclude {none} operation from the default DARTS search space to satisfy the topology constraint in Eq. 1.\nUnder S0 space, we search and evaluate on CIFAR-10¬† and ImageNet¬†[ref]9 respectively. We also conduct experiments on four reduced search spaces, S1-S4, introduced by R-DARTS¬† to evaluate the stability of our method.\nS1 is a pre-optimized search space, where each\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
