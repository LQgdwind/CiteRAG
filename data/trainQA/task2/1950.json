      "content": "Paper Title: Single-Source SIE for Two-Dimensional Arbitrarily Connected Penetrable and PEC Objects with Nonconformal Meshes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this paper, we consider the TM mode to demonstrate the implementations of the proposed SS-SIE formulation. However, it can also be used to solve more general vector EM problems. In the appendix, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed SS-SIE formulation to solve the vector TE electromagnetic problems.  We then present the implementations of the proposed formulation, and the readers can refer to   for more implementation details. Without loss of generality, there are no sources inside the penetrable region ΩisubscriptΩ𝑖\\Omega_{i}. The electric fields on γisubscript𝛾𝑖\\gamma_{i} can be expressed as where T=1/2𝑇12T=1/2 when the source point 𝐫′superscript𝐫′\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime} and the observation point 𝐫𝐫\\mathbf{r} are located on the same boundary, otherwise, T=1𝑇1T=1. Gi​(𝐫,𝐫′)subscript𝐺𝑖𝐫superscript𝐫′G_{i}\\left(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}\\right) is the Green’s function with Gi​(𝐫,𝐫′)=−j​H0(2)​(ki​|𝝆|)/4subscript𝐺𝑖𝐫superscript𝐫′𝑗superscriptsubscript𝐻02subscript𝑘𝑖𝝆4G_{i}\\left(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}\\right)=-jH_{0}^{(2)}\\left(k_{i}|\\bm{\\rho}|\\right)/4, j=−1𝑗1j=\\sqrt{-1}, 𝝆=𝐫−𝐫′𝝆𝐫superscript𝐫′\\bm{\\rho}=\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}, where kisubscript𝑘𝑖k_{i} is the wavenumber inside the object, H0(2)​(⋅)superscriptsubscript𝐻02⋅H_{0}^{(2)}\\left(\\cdot\\right) is the zeroth-order of Hankel function of the second kind. According to the Poincare-Steklov operator [ref]24, we have where μisubscript𝜇𝑖\\mu_{i} is the permeability of the penetrable object. By substituting (19) into (18), we have After γisubscript𝛾𝑖\\gamma_{i} is discretized into misubscript𝑚𝑖m_{i} segments, the tangential electric and magnetic fields can be expanded as where fnsubscript𝑓𝑛f_{n} is the pulse basis function, ensubscript𝑒𝑛e_{n} and hnsubscriptℎ𝑛h_{n} are the expansion coefficients, respectively. We collect all the expansion coefficients into column vectors as 𝐄isubscript𝐄𝑖\\mathbf{E}_{i} and 𝐇isubscript𝐇𝑖\\mathbf{H}_{i}, which can be expressed as By substituting (21) into (20) and using the Galerkin scheme on (20), we get the following matrix equation where 𝕃isubscript𝕃𝑖\\mathbb{L}_{i} is a diagonal matrix, in which entities are equal to the length of segments. The entities of matrix ℙisubscriptℙ𝑖\\mathbb{P}_{i} and 𝕌isubscript𝕌𝑖\\mathbb{U}_{i} are given by To handle the nearly singular and singular integrals in (27) and (28), the approach in  is used. Interested readers are referred to it for more details. Then, by moving the second terms on the right hand side (RHS) of (26) to its left hand side (LHS) and inverting the square matrix ℙisubscriptℙ𝑖\\mathbb{P}_{i}, we obtain where 𝕐isubscript𝕐𝑖\\mathbb{Y}_{i} is the surface admittance operator (SAO) [ref]24. By applying the surface equivalence theorem to the penetrable object, it is replaced by the background medium and an equivalent surface electric current density is enforced on γisubscript𝛾𝑖\\gamma_{i} with 𝐄^ti​(𝐫)=𝐄ti​(𝐫)subscript^𝐄subscript𝑡𝑖𝐫subscript𝐄subscript𝑡𝑖𝐫\\widehat{\\mathbf{E}}_{t_{i}}(\\mathbf{r})=\\mathbf{E}_{t_{i}}(\\mathbf{r}). In this configuration, the tangential magnetic fields can be expanded as We collect all the expansion coefficients into a column vector 𝐇^isubscript^𝐇𝑖\\widehat{\\mathbf{H}}_{i}, which can be expressed as With the similar procedure in the original model, we obtain The equivalent current density can be expanded by the pulse basis function, and the expansion coefficients are written into a column vector 𝐉eisubscript𝐉subscript𝑒𝑖\\mathbf{J}_{e_{i}} as By substituting (29) and (32) into (1), 𝐉eisubscript𝐉subscript𝑒𝑖\\mathbf{J}_{e_{i}} can be expressed as where 𝕐sisubscript𝕐subscript𝑠𝑖\\mathbb{Y}_{s_{i}} is the DSAO [ref]24 given by\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: the wavenumber inside the object, H0(2)​(⋅)superscriptsubscript𝐻02⋅H_{0}^{(2)}\\left(\\cdot\\right) is the zeroth-order of Hankel function of the second kind.
