      "content": "Paper Title: CPSAA: Accelerating Sparse Attention using Crossbar-based Processing-In-Memory Architecture\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCPSAA Configurations. We employ a Python cycle-accurate simulator to model the CPSAA attention accelerator. We use the 1000GB/s On-Chip Interconnect (OCI) for the on-chip transfer bandwidth . ReRAM’s energy consumption is obtained with 7pJ per bit as in [ref]35. As configured in ISAAC , the “cycle” in CPSAA means the time of ADC processing 32 column signals, i.e., 25ns. The CPSAA configurations are shown in Table II. We configure CPSAA with 64 tiles, and each tile includes one group of peripheral components, 11 ROAs, and 56 WEAs. We use two 512×\\times512 ReCAM arrays as the Scheduler to store the mask matrices, while we use 32×\\times32 crossbar as the ReRAM array to perform the VMM operation. The crossbar configurations used in CPSAA are designed under the 32nm process with 533MHz clock frequency . Based TaOx ReRAM cells from , we conduct SPICE simulation for the area and power of crossbar configuration. We use CACTI 6.5  in 32nm technology to evaluate the power and area of all registers. To obtain parameters of other peripheral components, we use Cadence-simulator  for S/H, S+A in a crossbar. The power, area, and latency of a 2-bit precision DAC and a 2.0 mW 8b 1.0 GS/s ADC in 32nm CMOS are obtained from  and , respectively. The crossbars are read and written in a row parallel manner, and the SET/RESET latency is 1.52/2.11 ns for single-level cells (SLC) . The area and energy of SU, BU, QU, DQU, and CTRLs are established by SPICE circuits, too. The write endurance of the ReRAM cell can be alleviated greatly. For instance, considering up to 1012 ReRAM write endurance , CPSAA can achieve hundreds of millions (108) of inferences when processing millions of tokens documents (104 times writing). Benchmarks. We use three typical attention-based NN models and get the weight matrices by pre-training, i.e., BERT-Base [ref]4, GPT-2 , and BART . BERT-Base (12 encoders) utilizes the encoder in Google Transformer to solve many NLP tasks. GPT-2 (12 decoders) uses the decoder of Transformer to process various NLP tasks. BART (six encoders and six decoders) is an optimized version of the Google Transformer. Our evaluation datasets include eight text classification tasks from the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark  (CoLA, SST-2, MRPC, STS-B, QQP, MNLI, WNLI, RTE) and Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) V2.0 . As configured in Transformer , BERT [ref]4, A3 [ref]7, and SANGER , we set the model dimension dmodel = 512 and dK = dQ = 64 for all workloads. In addition, model dimension (d) is not likely to vary widely since a choice of too large d can lead to a decrease in model accuracy . To fit the memory space of CPSAA, we divide all datasets into some little batches, and each batch has 320 embeddings, as set in BERT [ref]4 and A3 [ref]7. Embeddings in the same batch can be parallel processed by CPSAA without off-chip data transmission, and embeddings in different batches are processed in serial with small off-chip data transfers. We use the Giga Operations per second (GOPS) as the performance metric (throughput) and the throughput per Watt (GOPS/W) as the energy metric (energy efficiency). Data Overflow Prevention. The precision of input and weight matrices are set to 32-bit. The learning rate for GLUE and SQuAD v2.0 datasets are 2e-5 and 3e-5, and the number of fine-tuning epochs is set to 3 and 2, respectively. The attention mechanism involves lots of matrix multiplication calculations, so preventing data overflow is as important as ensuring accuracy. We extract the Exponential Bit (EB) of the whole array to make the Fraction Bit (FB) remaining 32-bit fixed-point as in . Thus, all VMM operations in CPSAA can be performed between 32-bit fixed-point numbers. After we get the results of the VMM operation between the FB, we can multiply the EB by the FB and get the final results. Comparison Platforms. CPSAA is compared with state-of-the-art platforms as follows. We choose GPU as the NVIDIA TITAN RTX GPU@1770MHz, 576 Tensor cores, 4608 CUDA cores, 24GB memory, 672GB/s memory bandwidth, and 280 Watt TDP. We choose Bigbird as the attention algorithm for the GPU . We measure power consumption via nvidia-smi and execution latency using CUDA Event. We measure the performance of GPUs using PyTorch with cuBLAS 11.2.\nWe choose the FPGA-based software-hardware co-design accelerator proposed in  as the FPGA platform for comparison. The configurations are also following .\nWe choose the configurations of SANGER as the ASIC-based attention accelerator for comparison .\nWe choose two architectures, ReBERT  and ReTransformer , as the PIM-featured attention accelerator for comparison. The configurations of crossbars used in ReBERT and ReTransformer are the same as CPSAA.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: simulator to model the CPSAA attention accelerator.
