It is important to note, however, that the definition of sheaves over cellular complexes\ndiffers somewhat from the traditional definition of sheaves over topological spaces.\nTherefore, one should be careful when drawing parallels between\nestablished results on sheaves over topological spaces and similar results for cellular complexes.\nIn fact, the definition of sheaves on cellular complex introduced in ,\nseems more similar to the traditional definition of presheaves in some respects222\nThe reason the author refers to it as a sheaf is because the definition satisfies certain categorical properties.\nAs of my current understanding, the author may have implicitly applied certain sheafification to make the object more well-behaved.\n,\nand one might wonder whether it is the right object to study in the context of error correcting codes. These concerns motivate us to introduce additional conditions on sheaves over cellular complexes.\nThe conditions we impose have certain analogs in the traditional definition of sheaves\nand could be useful for certain applications. We begin by reviewing the definition of sheaves over cellular complexes as introduced in .\nTo distinguish this from our definition of sheaves,\nwe refer to this structure as a “presheaf” with quotation marks.\nA “presheaf” ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} on a cellular complex X𝑋X is the following data. For each i𝑖i-cell σ∈X​(i)𝜎𝑋𝑖\\sigma\\in X(i),\nwe have a vector space over 𝔽qsubscript𝔽𝑞\\mathbb{F}_{q}, ℱσsubscriptℱ𝜎\\mathcal{F}_{\\sigma}.\nRecall that each cell corresponds to a set X≥σ​(t)subscript𝑋absent𝜎𝑡X_{\\geq\\sigma}(t),\nand we call the elements of ℱσsubscriptℱ𝜎\\mathcal{F}_{\\sigma} as sections of ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} over X≥σ​(t)subscript𝑋absent𝜎𝑡X_{\\geq\\sigma}(t). For each inclusion σ⪯τprecedes-or-equals𝜎𝜏\\sigma\\preceq\\tau (i.e. X≥σ​(t)⊇X≥τ​(t)subscript𝑋absent𝜏𝑡subscript𝑋absent𝜎𝑡X_{\\geq\\sigma}(t)\\supseteq X_{\\geq\\tau}(t)),\nwe have a restriction map resσ,τ:ℱσ→ℱτ:subscriptres𝜎𝜏→subscriptℱ𝜎subscriptℱ𝜏\\operatorname{res}_{\\sigma,\\tau}:\\mathcal{F}_{\\sigma}\\to\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau}. The data is required to satisfy the following two conditions. The map resσ,σsubscriptres𝜎𝜎\\operatorname{res}_{\\sigma,\\sigma} is the identity: resσ,σ=idℱσsubscriptres𝜎𝜎subscriptidsubscriptℱ𝜎\\operatorname{res}_{\\sigma,\\sigma}=\\textnormal{id}_{\\mathcal{F}_{\\sigma}}. If σ⪯π⪯τprecedes-or-equals𝜎𝜋precedes-or-equals𝜏\\sigma\\preceq\\pi\\preceq\\tau are inclusions,\nthen the restriction maps commute,\ni.e. resσ,τ=resπ,τ⁡resσ,πsubscriptres𝜎𝜏subscriptres𝜋𝜏subscriptres𝜎𝜋\\operatorname{res}_{\\sigma,\\tau}=\\operatorname{res}_{\\pi,\\tau}\\operatorname{res}_{\\sigma,\\pi}. When the context is clear,\nwe write |τ|_{\\tau} in place of resσ,τsubscriptres𝜎𝜏\\operatorname{res}_{\\sigma,\\tau}. A useful way to think about an element in ℱσsubscriptℱ𝜎\\mathcal{F}_{\\sigma}\nis to view it as a function defined on X≥σ​(t)subscript𝑋absent𝜎𝑡X_{\\geq\\sigma}(t).\nIn particular, given c∈ℱσ𝑐subscriptℱ𝜎c\\in\\mathcal{F}_{\\sigma},\nwe can define the value of c𝑐c at τ∈X≥σ​(t)𝜏subscript𝑋absent𝜎𝑡\\tau\\in X_{\\geq\\sigma}(t)\nas c​(τ)=resσ,τ⁡(c)𝑐𝜏subscriptres𝜎𝜏𝑐c(\\tau)=\\operatorname{res}_{\\sigma,\\tau}(c).\nThis explains why we call the elements of ℱσsubscriptℱ𝜎\\mathcal{F}_{\\sigma} as sections of ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} over X≥σ​(t)subscript𝑋absent𝜎𝑡X_{\\geq\\sigma}(t).\nHowever, there is a caveat to this interpretation.\nIn particular, the map from ℱσsubscriptℱ𝜎\\mathcal{F}_{\\sigma} to functions on X≥σ​(t)subscript𝑋absent𝜎𝑡X_{\\geq\\sigma}(t) is not necessarily injective for “presheaves”.\nThat means that some information in ℱσsubscriptℱ𝜎\\mathcal{F}_{\\sigma} may be lost\nwhen viewed as a function on X≥σ​(t)subscript𝑋absent𝜎𝑡X_{\\geq\\sigma}(t).\nThis is one reason why additional conditions are required\nto guarantee desireable behaviors for “presheaves”.\nAs we will see, the conditions we impose\nimply that the map is injective,\nso that the element in ℱσsubscriptℱ𝜎\\mathcal{F}_{\\sigma} one-one corresponds to a function on X≥σ​(t)subscript𝑋absent𝜎𝑡X_{\\geq\\sigma}(t). Even though we refer to the object as a “presheaf”,\nit differs from traditional presheaves over topological spaces\nin several ways.\nWhile there appears to be a dictionary between\nopen sets in topological spaces and\nthe regions X≥σ​(t)subscript𝑋absent𝜎𝑡X_{\\geq\\sigma}(t) for some cell σ𝜎\\sigma,\nthis analogy has some subtleties.\nFor example, in topology, the union of open sets is an open set,\nbut the union of regions X≥σ​(t)subscript𝑋absent𝜎𝑡X_{\\geq\\sigma}(t) is generally not of the form X≥τ​(t)subscript𝑋absent𝜏𝑡X_{\\geq\\tau}(t).\nThe presents a problem: a presheaf should assign a vector space to each open set,\nyet the current definition of a “presheaf” over a cellular complex\ndoes not assign a vector space to the union of such regions.\nThis indicates that the definition of “presheaves” over cellular complexes\nlacks some nonlocal data\ncompared to presheaves over topological spaces.\nThis is why we put the quotation marks around “presheaves”. The definition of sheaves is designed to address these two issues.\nThe first issue is resolved by the identity axiom,\nwhich ensures that sections are uniquely determined by their local values.\nThe second issue is resolved by the gluability axiom,\nwhich states that local sections can be glued together to form sections over larger sets.\nWe first review these two conditions for sheaves over topological spaces. Identity axiom: If {Ui}i∈Isubscriptsubscript𝑈𝑖𝑖𝐼\\{U_{i}\\}_{i\\in I} is an open cover of U𝑈U,\nand c1,c2∈ℱUsubscript𝑐1subscript𝑐2subscriptℱ𝑈c_{1},c_{2}\\in\\mathcal{F}_{U},\nand resU,Ui⁡c1=resU,Ui⁡c2subscriptres𝑈subscript𝑈𝑖subscript𝑐1subscriptres𝑈subscript𝑈𝑖subscript𝑐2\\operatorname{res}_{U,U_{i}}c_{1}=\\operatorname{res}_{U,U_{i}}c_{2} for all i𝑖i,\nthen c1=c2subscript𝑐1subscript𝑐2c_{1}=c_{2}. Gluability axiom: If {Ui}i∈Isubscriptsubscript𝑈𝑖𝑖𝐼\\{U_{i}\\}_{i\\in I} is an open cover of U𝑈U, then given ci∈ℱUisubscript𝑐𝑖subscriptℱsubscript𝑈𝑖c_{i}\\in\\mathcal{F}_{U_{i}} for all i𝑖i,\nsuch that resUi,Ui∩Uj⁡ci=resUj,Ui∩Uj⁡cjsubscriptressubscript𝑈𝑖subscript𝑈𝑖subscript𝑈𝑗subscript𝑐𝑖subscriptressubscript𝑈𝑗subscript𝑈𝑖subscript𝑈𝑗subscript𝑐𝑗\\operatorname{res}_{U_{i},U_{i}\\cap U_{j}}c_{i}=\\operatorname{res}_{U_{j},U_{i}\\cap U_{j}}c_{j} for all i,j𝑖𝑗i,j,\nthen there is some c∈ℱU𝑐subscriptℱ𝑈c\\in\\mathcal{F}_{U}\nsuch that resU,Ui⁡c=cisubscriptres𝑈subscript𝑈𝑖𝑐subscript𝑐𝑖\\operatorname{res}_{U,U_{i}}c=c_{i} for all i𝑖i. These two conditions can be interpreted as the exactness of the following chain complex The second map is c↦{resU,Ui⁡(c)}i∈Imaps-to𝑐subscriptsubscriptres𝑈subscript𝑈𝑖𝑐𝑖𝐼c\\mapsto\\{\\operatorname{res}_{U,U_{i}}(c)\\}_{i\\in I}\nand the last map is {ci}i∈I↦{ci−cj}i,j∈I,i≠jmaps-tosubscriptsubscript𝑐𝑖𝑖𝐼subscriptsubscript𝑐𝑖subscript𝑐𝑗formulae-sequence𝑖𝑗𝐼𝑖𝑗\\{c_{i}\\}_{i\\in I}\\mapsto\\{c_{i}-c_{j}\\}_{i,j\\in I,i\\neq j},\nwhere we impose an ordering on the elements in I𝐼I.\nIdentity is exactness at ℱUsubscriptℱ𝑈\\mathcal{F}_{U}\nand gluability is exactness at ∏iℱUisubscriptproduct𝑖subscriptℱsubscript𝑈𝑖\\prod_{i}\\mathcal{F}_{U_{i}}. In the context of topological spaces,\nthese conditions must be satisfied by all possible open sets.\nHowever, for cellular complexes,\nthe analogous notion of open sets is a bit different.\nSo instead we impose the following condition:\nfor every i𝑖i-cell σ∈X𝜎𝑋\\sigma\\in X with i≤t−2𝑖𝑡2i\\leq t-2,\nthe following chain complex is exact and for i𝑖i-cell σ∈X𝜎𝑋\\sigma\\in X with i=t−1𝑖𝑡1i=t-1,\nthe following chain complex is exact We will refer to the exactness at ℱσsubscriptℱ𝜎\\mathcal{F}_{\\sigma} as the identity axiom on σ𝜎\\sigma\nand the exactness at ∏σi+1∈X≥σ​(i+1)ℱσi+1subscriptproductsubscript𝜎𝑖1subscript𝑋absent𝜎𝑖1subscriptℱsubscript𝜎𝑖1\\prod_{\\sigma_{i+1}\\in X_{\\geq\\sigma}(i+1)}\\mathcal{F}_{\\sigma_{i+1}} as the gluability axiom on σ𝜎\\sigma. The conditions we impose follow closely with the definition of sheaves over topological spaces,\nwith the difference being that we now restrict ourselves to a specific family of “open covers”\nand a particular set of intersections between the “open sets”.\nIt is worth noting that in the traditional setting\neach intersection Ui∩Ujsubscript𝑈𝑖subscript𝑈𝑗U_{i}\\cap U_{j} corresponds to exactly two open sets Uisubscript𝑈𝑖U_{i} and Ujsubscript𝑈𝑗U_{j},\nwhich ensures that the sections on Uisubscript𝑈𝑖U_{i} and Ujsubscript𝑈𝑗U_{j} are consistent.\nSimilarly, in our context, for every (i+2)𝑖2(i+2)-cell σi+2∈X≥σ​(i+2)subscript𝜎𝑖2subscript𝑋absent𝜎𝑖2\\sigma_{i+2}\\in X_{\\geq\\sigma}(i+2),\nthere are exactly two (i+1)𝑖1(i+1)-cells σi+1subscript𝜎𝑖1\\sigma_{i+1} such that σ⋖σi+1⋖σi+2⋖𝜎subscript𝜎𝑖1⋖subscript𝜎𝑖2\\sigma\\precdot\\sigma_{i+1}\\precdot\\sigma_{i+2} (discussed near 6.1),\nwhich guarantees that the section on the two (i+1)𝑖1(i+1)-cells are consistent.\nIn fact, when X𝑋X is a simplicial complex,\nand we take {σi+1}σi+1∈X≥σ​(i+1)subscriptsubscript𝜎𝑖1subscript𝜎𝑖1subscript𝑋absent𝜎𝑖1\\{\\sigma_{i+1}\\}_{\\sigma_{i+1}\\in X_{\\geq\\sigma}(i+1)} as an open cover of σ𝜎\\sigma,\nthe two expressions in Equation 50 and Equation 49\nare exactly the same. We now describe an explicit characterization of ℱℱ\\mathcal{F},\nas a consequence of the sheaf conditions. For every cell σ∈X𝜎𝑋\\sigma\\in X,\nthe map ℱσ→ισ∏τ∈X≥σ​(t)ℱτsubscript𝜄𝜎→subscriptℱ𝜎subscriptproduct𝜏subscript𝑋absent𝜎𝑡subscriptℱ𝜏\\mathcal{F}_{\\sigma}\\xrightarrow{\\iota_{\\sigma}}\\prod_{\\tau\\in X_{\\geq\\sigma}(t)}\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau},\nwhich sends c↦∏τ∈X≥σ​(t)resσ,τ⁡(c)maps-to𝑐subscriptproduct𝜏subscript𝑋absent𝜎𝑡subscriptres𝜎𝜏𝑐c\\mapsto\\prod_{\\tau\\in X_{\\geq\\sigma}(t)}\\operatorname{res}_{\\sigma,\\tau}(c),\nis injective. Furthermore, the restriction map resσ,πsubscriptres𝜎𝜋\\operatorname{res}_{\\sigma,\\pi} corresponds to the restriction map on X​(t)𝑋𝑡X(t) where resX≥σ​(t),X≥π​(t)subscriptressubscript𝑋absent𝜎𝑡subscript𝑋absent𝜋𝑡\\operatorname{res}_{X_{\\geq\\sigma}(t),X_{\\geq\\pi}(t)} is the map that restricts the domain of the function from X≥σ​(t)subscript𝑋absent𝜎𝑡X_{\\geq\\sigma}(t) to X≥π​(t)subscript𝑋absent𝜋𝑡X_{\\geq\\pi}(t). We first show the injectivity of ισsubscript𝜄𝜎\\iota_{\\sigma} through induction.\nFor σ𝜎\\sigma with dimension i=t𝑖𝑡i=t, the result is straightforward.\nFor σ𝜎\\sigma with dimension i=t−1𝑖𝑡1i=t-1,\nthe injectivity is implied from the identity axiom on σ𝜎\\sigma. Assuming the statement holds for cells with dimension greater than i𝑖i,\nwe want to show that the statement also holds for σ𝜎\\sigma with dimension i𝑖i.\nBy the identity and gluability axioms on σ𝜎\\sigma,\nwe have where c↦{resσ,π⁡(c)}π∈X≥σ​(i+1)maps-to𝑐subscriptsubscriptres𝜎𝜋𝑐𝜋subscript𝑋absent𝜎𝑖1c\\mapsto\\{\\operatorname{res}_{\\sigma,\\pi}(c)\\}_{\\pi\\in X_{\\geq\\sigma}(i+1)}.\nThe condition resπ,ρ⁡(cπ)=resπ′,ρ⁡(cπ′)subscriptres𝜋𝜌subscript𝑐𝜋subscriptressuperscript𝜋′𝜌subscript𝑐superscript𝜋′\\operatorname{res}_{\\pi,\\rho}(c_{\\pi})=\\operatorname{res}_{\\pi^{\\prime},\\rho}(c_{\\pi^{\\prime}})\nis imposed only when π⋖ρ⋖𝜋𝜌\\pi\\precdot\\rho and π′⋖ρ⋖superscript𝜋′𝜌\\pi^{\\prime}\\precdot\\rho.\nDenote the RHS as S𝑆S. To show that ισsubscript𝜄𝜎\\iota_{\\sigma} is injective,\nwe construct the inverse map im⁡(ισ)→ℱσ→imsubscript𝜄𝜎subscriptℱ𝜎\\operatorname{im}(\\iota_{\\sigma})\\to\\mathcal{F}_{\\sigma}.\nGiven h∈im⁡(ισ)⊆∏τ∈X≥σ​(t)ℱτℎimsubscript𝜄𝜎subscriptproduct𝜏subscript𝑋absent𝜎𝑡subscriptℱ𝜏h\\in\\operatorname{im}(\\iota_{\\sigma})\\subseteq\\prod_{\\tau\\in X_{\\geq\\sigma}(t)}\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau}.\nBecause h​(τ)=resπ,τ⁡(resσ,π⁡(c))ℎ𝜏subscriptres𝜋𝜏subscriptres𝜎𝜋𝑐h(\\tau)=\\operatorname{res}_{\\pi,\\tau}(\\operatorname{res}_{\\sigma,\\pi}(c)) for all τ⪰πsucceeds-or-equals𝜏𝜋\\tau\\succeq\\pi,\nwe have ∏τ∈X≥π​(t)h​(τ)∈ιπ​(ℱπ)subscriptproduct𝜏subscript𝑋absent𝜋𝑡ℎ𝜏subscript𝜄𝜋subscriptℱ𝜋\\prod_{\\tau\\in X_{\\geq\\pi}(t)}h(\\tau)\\in\\iota_{\\pi}(\\mathcal{F}_{\\pi}).\nBy the induction hypothesis, ιπsubscript𝜄𝜋\\iota_{\\pi} is injective,\nwhich allows us to define\ncπ=ιπ−1​(∏τ∈X≥π​(t)h​(τ))∈ℱπsubscript𝑐𝜋superscriptsubscript𝜄𝜋1subscriptproduct𝜏subscript𝑋absent𝜋𝑡ℎ𝜏subscriptℱ𝜋c_{\\pi}=\\iota_{\\pi}^{-1}(\\prod_{\\tau\\in X_{\\geq\\pi}(t)}h(\\tau))\\in\\mathcal{F}_{\\pi}\nfor every π∈X≥σ​(i+1)𝜋subscript𝑋absent𝜎𝑖1\\pi\\in X_{\\geq\\sigma}(i+1).\nIt is straightforward to check that {cπ}π∈X≥σ​(i+1)∈Ssubscriptsubscript𝑐𝜋𝜋subscript𝑋absent𝜎𝑖1𝑆\\{c_{\\pi}\\}_{\\pi\\in X_{\\geq\\sigma}(i+1)}\\in S.\nTherefore, we can define the candidate inverse map ισ−1superscriptsubscript𝜄𝜎1\\iota_{\\sigma}^{-1}\nas ισ−1​(h)=gσ−1​({cπ}π∈X≥σ​(i+1))superscriptsubscript𝜄𝜎1ℎsuperscriptsubscript𝑔𝜎1subscriptsubscript𝑐𝜋𝜋subscript𝑋absent𝜎𝑖1\\iota_{\\sigma}^{-1}(h)=g_{\\sigma}^{-1}(\\{c_{\\pi}\\}_{\\pi\\in X_{\\geq\\sigma}(i+1)}).\nIt is straightforward to check that the composition ισ−1∘ισsuperscriptsubscript𝜄𝜎1subscript𝜄𝜎\\iota_{\\sigma}^{-1}\\circ\\iota_{\\sigma}\nis the identity map on ℱσsubscriptℱ𝜎\\mathcal{F}_{\\sigma}. The second statement about the restriction map\nis a direct consequence of the presheaf condition,\nresπ,τ⁡resσ,π=resσ,τsubscriptres𝜋𝜏subscriptres𝜎𝜋subscriptres𝜎𝜏\\operatorname{res}_{\\pi,\\tau}\\operatorname{res}_{\\sigma,\\pi}=\\operatorname{res}_{\\sigma,\\tau}\nfor τ∈X​(t)𝜏𝑋𝑡\\tau\\in X(t).\n∎ Therefore, from now on,\nwe will ocacasionally abuse the notation\nby viewing ℱσsubscriptℱ𝜎\\mathcal{F}_{\\sigma} as a subset of ∏τ∈X≥σ​(t)ℱτsubscriptproduct𝜏subscript𝑋absent𝜎𝑡subscriptℱ𝜏\\prod_{\\tau\\in X_{\\geq\\sigma}(t)}\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau}\nand interpreting elements of ℱσsubscriptℱ𝜎\\mathcal{F}_{\\sigma} as functions on X≥σ​(t)subscript𝑋absent𝜎𝑡X_{\\geq\\sigma}(t). For every cell σ∈X𝜎𝑋\\sigma\\in X, In particular, the sheaf ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} is completely determined by\n{ℱτ′}τ′∈X​(t−1)subscriptsubscriptℱsuperscript𝜏′superscript𝜏′𝑋𝑡1\\{\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau^{\\prime}}\\}_{\\tau^{\\prime}\\in X(t-1)}. We again proof by induction.\nFor σ𝜎\\sigma with dimension i=t−1𝑖𝑡1i=t-1 or t𝑡t the statement is clearly true. Assuming the statement holds for cells with dimension greater than i𝑖i,\nwe want to show that the statement also holds for σ𝜎\\sigma with dimension i𝑖i.\nDenote the RHS of Equation 54 as Tσsubscript𝑇𝜎T_{\\sigma}.\nBy the identity and gluability axioms on σ𝜎\\sigma Denote the RHS as S𝑆S. It is clear that ℱσ⊆Tσsubscriptℱ𝜎subscript𝑇𝜎\\mathcal{F}_{\\sigma}\\subseteq T_{\\sigma},\nwhich is a direct consequence of the presheaf condition.\nWhat remains is to show that Tσ⊆ℱσsubscript𝑇𝜎subscriptℱ𝜎T_{\\sigma}\\subseteq\\mathcal{F}_{\\sigma}.\nGiven h∈Tσℎsubscript𝑇𝜎h\\in T_{\\sigma},\nwe define cπ=∏τ∈X≥π​(t)h​(τ)subscript𝑐𝜋subscriptproduct𝜏subscript𝑋absent𝜋𝑡ℎ𝜏c_{\\pi}=\\prod_{\\tau\\in X_{\\geq\\pi}(t)}h(\\tau)\nfor every π∈X≥σ​(i+1)𝜋subscript𝑋absent𝜎𝑖1\\pi\\in X_{\\geq\\sigma}(i+1).\nIt is clear that cπ∈Tπsubscript𝑐𝜋subscript𝑇𝜋c_{\\pi}\\in T_{\\pi}.\nBy the induction hypothesis, Tπ=ℱπsubscript𝑇𝜋subscriptℱ𝜋T_{\\pi}=\\mathcal{F}_{\\pi}.\nTherefore, {cπ}π∈X≥σ​(i+1)∈Ssubscriptsubscript𝑐𝜋𝜋subscript𝑋absent𝜎𝑖1𝑆\\{c_{\\pi}\\}_{\\pi\\in X_{\\geq\\sigma}(i+1)}\\in S,\nwhich implies h∈ℱσℎsubscriptℱ𝜎h\\in\\mathcal{F}_{\\sigma},\nas desired.\n∎ In fact, the statements of Lemmas 6.2 and 6.3\ntogether is equivalent to the identity and gluability axioms.\nThe means that we could have defined sheaves over cellular complexes\nusing the statements in the lemmas.\nWe denote the unique sheaf with ισ​(ℱσ)=Cσ⊆𝔽qX≥σ​(t)subscript𝜄𝜎subscriptℱ𝜎subscript𝐶𝜎superscriptsubscript𝔽𝑞subscript𝑋absent𝜎𝑡\\iota_{\\sigma}(\\mathcal{F}_{\\sigma})=C_{\\sigma}\\subseteq\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{X_{\\geq\\sigma}(t)}\nas ℱ​(X,{Cσ}σ∈X​(t−1))ℱ𝑋subscriptsubscript𝐶𝜎𝜎𝑋𝑡1\\mathcal{F}(X,\\{C_{\\sigma}\\}_{{\\sigma}\\in X(t-1)}),\nWe refer to Cσsubscript𝐶𝜎C_{\\sigma} as the local codes,\nwhich serves a role similar to the local codes used in Tanner codes. Conceptually, these ℱτ′subscriptℱsuperscript𝜏′\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau^{\\prime}} for τ′∈X​(t−1)superscript𝜏′𝑋𝑡1\\tau^{\\prime}\\in X(t-1)\nshould be regarded as analogs of stalks.\nIn the context of sheaf over topological spaces,\nit is known that\n“many properties of the sheaf are determined by its stalks”.\nSimilarly, in our context of cellular complex,\nwe can adopt the same principle:\n“many properties of the global code are determined by its local codes”. This characterization of sheaves allows us to define the concept of a dual sheaf ℱ⟂superscriptℱperpendicular-to\\mathcal{F}^{\\perp},\nwhere ισ​((ℱ⟂)σ)=(ισ​(ℱσ))⟂subscript𝜄𝜎subscriptsuperscriptℱperpendicular-to𝜎superscriptsubscript𝜄𝜎subscriptℱ𝜎perpendicular-to\\iota_{\\sigma}((\\mathcal{F}^{\\perp})_{\\sigma})=(\\iota_{\\sigma}(\\mathcal{F}_{\\sigma}))^{\\perp}\nfor σ∈X​(t−1)𝜎𝑋𝑡1\\sigma\\in X(t-1).\n(This notion was also proposed in [ref]17 using the notation ℱTsuperscriptℱ𝑇\\mathcal{F}^{T}.)\nAs we will see,\nunder suitable conditions,\nthere exists a Poincaré duality between ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} and ℱ⟂superscriptℱperpendicular-to\\mathcal{F}^{\\perp}.\nThis will allow us to identify the X and Z logical operators with the cohomologies of ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} and ℱ⟂superscriptℱperpendicular-to\\mathcal{F}^{\\perp},\nrespectively. Interestingly, the two statements in the lemmas\nwere used in [ref]17 to define the Tanner sheaves.\nThe only technical difference\nis that we allow ℱτ≠𝔽qsubscriptℱ𝜏subscript𝔽𝑞\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau}\\neq\\mathbb{F}_{q} for τ∈X​(t)𝜏𝑋𝑡\\tau\\in X(t).\nIn [ref]17,\nthe statement of Lemma 6.2 is assumed as part of the definition of sheaves,\nand the statement of Lemma 6.3 is treated as an additional requirement specific for Tanner sheaves.\nIn contrast,\nwe argue that these two conditions probably should be included right from the beginning in the definition of sheaves over cellular complexes,\nas they are closely related to the identity and gluability axioms that are central to the definition of sheaves over topological spaces. Our definition of sheaf depends on the value of t𝑡t.\nIn particular, we apply different conditions\nfor i=t−1𝑖𝑡1i=t-1 and t≤t−2𝑡𝑡2t\\leq t-2.\nAs a result, if we take the discrete union of\na t𝑡t-dimensional cellular complex X𝑋X with sheaf ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}\nand a t′superscript𝑡′t^{\\prime}-dimensional cellular complex X′superscript𝑋′X^{\\prime} with sheaf ℱ′superscriptℱ′\\mathcal{F}^{\\prime},\nthe resulting structure is generally not a sheaf when t≠t′𝑡superscript𝑡′t\\neq t^{\\prime},\neven though the discrete union of X𝑋X and X′superscript𝑋′X^{\\prime} reamins a cellular complex.\nThis contrasts with the definition of sheaves in  We argue that this behavior is a feature, not a bug.\nIn our context,\neven though we describe the objects through t𝑡t-dimensional cellular complexes,\nthe goal is to model t𝑡t-dimensional manifolds.\nSimilarly, the discrete union\nof two manifolds of different dimensions is no longer a manifold.\nIn particular, this dependence on t𝑡t is manifest in the statement of Poincaré duality,\nwhich we will establish in Appendix B.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: Sheaf theory is a well-established topic in mathematics.\nRecently, chain complexes induced from sheaves have emerged as a natural framework for constructing codes\n[ref]16 [ref]21  [ref]17.\nFor readers unfamiliar with sheaf theory,\nit can be helpful to consult chapter 2 in \nto understand the motivation behind sheaves,\nwhich are traditionally defined over\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
