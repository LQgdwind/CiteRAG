      "content": "Paper Title: On Efficient Training of Large-Scale Deep Learning Models: A Literature Review\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTraining on a large, high-quality dataset will result in better performance than on a small, poorly organized dataset. For individual researchers, it is often impractical to collect and process large data manually, and they need to choose some open source datasets and consider combining multi-domain, multi-lingual datasets to improve data diversity and thus improve the generalization ability of the model. Therefore, corresponding pre-processing and cleaning methods such as de-duplication  (commonly with locality-sensitive hashing, LSH [ref]222), removal of documents with few tokens for denoising, etc. may need to be applied. In addition, studying efficient dataset regularization helps to improve the training performance and generality of large-scale models. The purpose of data regularization is to reduce overfitting, make the model easier to adapt, and improve model generalization without affecting the training process too much. However, it usually introduces additional computational costs and sometimes becomes a bottleneck in the training process. For efficient training, it is crucial to select and test from a range of techniques and decide which one to use.\n\nSzegedy et al. [ref]240 propose label smoothing regularization which replaces labels by interpolating between the label distribution and another fixed distribution(e.g., the uniform distribution). This approach alleviates the problem of overfitting and makes the model more adaptive. He et al. [ref]84 show that label smoothing makes the distribution centered on theoretical values and with fewer extreme values. In addition, Müller et al.  propose that label smoothing also improves the calibration of the model. They also observe that knowledge distillation into student networks is much less effective if a teacher network is trained using label smoothing. To explain these observations, they show by visualization that label smoothing encourages the representation of training instances to form tight clusters in the correct category but also leads to a loss of similarity information between samples from different categories, which negatively affects the effect of model distillation. Data augmentation (DA) is another important regularization strategy for efficient training. By making better use of the original dataset, such as transformed images, data augmentation artificially and effectively increases the training data to improve the generalization ability of the model. Even some counter-intuitive methods of data augmentation are instead effective in improving the performance of the model.\nFor computer vision, previous state-of-the-art models such as AlexNet , ResNet , and EfficientNetV2  all use image augmentation techniques in training. There are many basic data augmentation methods, most of which are relatively simple, such as rotation, translation, shearing, flipping, cropping and resizing, adjusting contrast and brightness, adding noise, Gaussian blur, color jittering,\nformat conversion (e.g. from RGB color model to HSV representation, which stands for Hue, Saturation, and Value), filtering, etc. In recent studies, basic erasing methods are proven to be effective, such as CutOut  which randomly cuts a square out of the input during training, and Random Erasing  which also erases a rectangle region of the image and fills it with random values or a mean value.\nMany data augmentation techniques are based on the idea of Mixup proposed by Zhang et al. , which mixes up the pairs of features and their corresponding labels.\nThere is a class of Mixup extensions, for example, Yun et al.  propose CutMix which cuts out a small patch of image and replaces it with another one.\nMore recent studies include SaliencyMix ,\nManifold Mixup ,\nStyleMix ,\nTokenMix ,\nCo-mixup ,\nSupermix ,\nand TransMix . More advanced work investigates the combined use of various data augmentation algorithms and enters the field of automatic data augmentation, of which AutoAugment  is an important representative, which uses a search algorithm implemented as a controller RNN in reinforcement learning to find data-driven augmentation strategies. However, it brings a heavy computational cost, so it can only be applied to small data sets.\nOther advanced algorithms such as Population Based Augmentation (PBA) , Fast AutoAugment , and Adversarial AutoAugment  further reduce the costs.\nRandom combinations can also be efficient, for example, Hendrycks et al.  propose a data augmentation technique called AugMix, which randomly selects different data augmentation methods and then mixes the augmented images.\nCubuk et al.  propose RandAugment which randomly selects a certain number of methods from several image augmentation methods, a general magnitude for transformations, and applies them sequentially for each sample. They investigate the influence of different data augmentation methods and also show that their method can scale the learned data augmentation strategies to larger datasets and models with a small cost and get better performance. In the field of NLP, data augmentation is usually done before the training process in a relatively different way than for images. According to Feng et al. , some of the data augmentation techniques are:\nRule-based techniques such as Easy Data Augmentation which is summarized by Wei and Zou , include randomly inserting, swapping, deleting, and synonym replacement. Among them, the synonym replacement methods are such as Zhang et al.  propose to randomly replace a word or a phrase with its synonyms ranked by semantic closeness, Wang and Yang  propose to create new instances by replacing a word with the results from searching for the k-nearest-neighbor (KNN) of the word in the embedding vocabulary.\nExample interpolation techniques that are pioneered by Mixup, for example, SeqMix .\nModel-based techniques such as Back translation  , which translate the text to another language and then translate it back.\nAs LLMs show great abilities in language understanding, some recent studies are using state-of-the-art models for data augmentation, for example, ChatAug  use ChatGPT as the data augmentation tool to rephrase input sentence into more additional sentences. We note that advanced data augmentation methods improve the robustness but also bring an additional load, and they are usually better suited for models with more parameters, larger sizes, and longer training time than for smaller models.\nIn particular, when bottlenecks exist in other parts of the training process and performing data augmentation computations does not affect the final time, data augmentation methods can be added to enhance the effect and improve the throughput rate.\nSteiner et al. 1 conduct an empirical study which shows that data augmentation (they used Mixup\nand RandAugment\n) and model regularization, together denoted as AugReg, is effective for relatively small amounts of data.\n\nReference markers found: [222]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]222: and thus improve the generalization ability of the model. Therefore, corresponding pre-processing and cleaning methods such as de-duplication  (commonly with locality-sensitive hashing, LSH [ref]222), removal of documents with few tokens for denoising, etc. may need to be applied. In addition, studying efficient dataset regularization helps to improve the training performance and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
