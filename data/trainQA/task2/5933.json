      "content": "Paper Title: Revisiting Test Time Adaptation under Online Evaluation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe Test Time Adaptation (TTA) setup relaxes the “i.i.d” assumption between the training and testing distributions  [ref]3.\nThis relaxation is usually attained through a lifelong learning scheme on all received unlabeled data  .\nEarlier approaches such as TTT  and TTT++ , among others  , include a self-supervised loss  during training, which can then provide an error signal during adaptation.\nDespite their effectiveness, such approaches assume having control on how the model is trained. Fully Test Time Adaptation.\nFully TTA methods are a subtype of TTA method that adapts at test time by modifying the model’s parameters      or its input [ref]8 by using the incoming unlabeled data.\nFully TTA methods are practical, as they avoid assumptions on the training phase of a given model  [ref]8 .\nThe earliest of these approaches adjusts the statistics of the Batch Normalization (BN) layers   1.\nFor example, BN-adaptation  leverages the statistics of the source data as a prior and infers the statistics for every received sample.\nOn the other hand, AdaBN 1 discards the statistics of the source domain and uses the statistics computed on the target domain.\nIn line with light TTA methods, LAME [ref]3 proposes to only adapt the model’s output by finding the latent assignments that optimize a manifold-regularized likelihood of the data.\nIn this work, we found that such efficient methods preserve their accuracy under online evaluation.\nWhile fully TTA methods have been widely studied in the context of adversarial domain shifts   , in this work we focus on the context of natural shifts such as realistic image corruptions 4 7. Another line of work aims at adapting to distribution shifts by minimizing entropy. For instance, SHOT  adapts the feature extractor to minimize the entropy of individual predictions; while maximizing the entropy of the predicted classes. TENT  updates the learnable parameters of the BN layers to minimize the entropy of predictions.\nEATA  combines TENT with an active selection of reliable and non-redundant samples from the target domain and an anti-forgetting loss 8. Further, SAR  equips TENT with an active sampling scheme that filters samples with noisy gradients. Furthermore, other works deployed data-augmentation at test time .\nFor example, MEMO  adapts model parameters to minimize the entropy over a sample and multiple augmentations of it. CoTTA  uses augmentations to generate reliable pseudo-labels and then peform distillation. Finally, DDA [ref]8 proposes to leverage a diffusion model 5 to restore corrupted inputs back to the source data distribution.\nThese methods require multiple forward passes through the network or a diffusion model, leading to slower inference speeds.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: The Test Time Adaptation (TTA) setup relaxes the “i.i.d” assumption between the training and testing distributions  [ref]3.\nThis relaxation is usually attained through a lifelong learning scheme on all received unlabeled data  .\nEarlier approaches such as TTT  and TTT++ , among others  , include a self-supervised\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
