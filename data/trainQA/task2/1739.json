      "content": "Paper Title: Algorithmic Challenges in Ensuring Fairness at the Time of Decision\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere has been a surge of interest in the academic community and among policymakers alike on the topic of algorithmic fairness. As this discourse develops, various task-specific notions of fairness have been introduced. This is natural since the social backdrop of, say, loan-granting is very different from that of job applicant screening. Hence, the notions of fairness appropriate in various decision-making settings such as pricing, applicant screening, loan-granting, etc., may be different. However, these settings commonly involve decision-making over a period of time, and thus, the aspect of avoiding temporal disparity in decisions is common to most of these tasks. In this paper, we illustrated the rich interplay between temporal fairness desiderata and online decision-making through the novel meta-objective of ensuring fairness at the time of decision. There are several possibilities for extension of our proposal and analysis as we discuss below. Envy freeness with multiplicative slacks. In many scenarios, multiplicative allowable disparities in treatment could be more appropriate than additive disparities. For example, a firm may want to price an item while ensuring that the price disparity between the youth and the general population is not more than 25%. In particular, consider slack functions s¯​(⋅,⋅):ℐ×ℐ→ℝ≥0:¯𝑠⋅⋅→ℐℐsuperscriptℝabsent0\\bar{s}(\\cdot,\\cdot):\\mathcal{I}\\times\\mathcal{I}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{\\geq 0} defined on ordered pairs of groups, and consider the following definition of envy-freeness with multiplicative slacks. We say that a decision vector 𝐱∈𝒳N𝐱superscript𝒳𝑁\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathcal{X}^{N} satisfies envy-freeness (EF) with multiplicative slacks if the following inequalities hold: It would be interesting to extend our algorithm design to satisfy the FTD extension of this kind of a relaxed envy freeness constraint. One setting where our current results extend is the case where there is a function m:ℐ→ℝ>0:𝑚→ℐsuperscriptℝabsent0m:\\mathcal{I}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{>0} such that s¯​(i,j)=m​(j)/m​(i)¯𝑠𝑖𝑗𝑚𝑗𝑚𝑖\\bar{s}(i,j)=m(j)/m(i). In this case, (10) effectively requires that xi​mi≥xj​mjsubscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑚𝑖subscript𝑥𝑗subscript𝑚𝑗x_{i}m_{i}\\geq x_{j}m_{j}. In this case, one can redefine the decision space for group i𝑖i as yi=xi​misubscript𝑦𝑖subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑚𝑖y_{i}=x_{i}m_{i}. Our algorithms then readily apply to optimizing 𝐲𝐲\\mathbf{y} in this setting. Slack-monotonicity. In our analysis of envy freeness with additive slacks, we assumed that s​(i,i)=0𝑠𝑖𝑖0s(i,i)=0. This resulted in the temporal monotonicity constraint of ensuring xi​(t)≥xi​(t′)−s​(i,i)=xi​(t′)subscript𝑥𝑖𝑡subscript𝑥𝑖superscript𝑡′𝑠𝑖𝑖subscript𝑥𝑖superscript𝑡′x_{i}(t)\\geq x_{i}(t^{\\prime})-s(i,i)=x_{i}(t^{\\prime}) for all i𝑖i and t≥t′𝑡superscript𝑡′t\\geq t^{\\prime}. However, in many scenarios, some changes to within-group decisions across time may be acceptable. In other words, we may have s​(i,i)>0𝑠𝑖𝑖0s(i,i)>0 for all i𝑖i, so that we effectively require that xi​(t)subscript𝑥𝑖𝑡x_{i}(t) is at most s​(i,i)𝑠𝑖𝑖s(i,i) lower than the highest decision seen by group i𝑖i until time t𝑡t, thus allowing for a limited amount of backtracking in decisions (similarly, with multiplicative slacks, we may have that s​(i,i)<1𝑠𝑖𝑖1s(i,i)<1). While it is interesting that this type of slack in the monotonicity constraint isn’t necessary for our setting to attain the unconstrained optimal near-regret rate of 𝒪~​(T)~𝒪𝑇\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T}), it may nevertheless simplify the algorithm design. Moreover, it may provide crucial flexibility in attaining near-optimal regret rates in harder settings, such as when the functions are only known to be unimodal. Beyond strong convexity. It would be interesting to extend our results beyond the strong convexity assumption. As discussed earlier, for the simplest case of single-dimensional optimization, [ref]36 and  have shown that a significant impact on the achievable rate of regret is inevitable under the monotonicity constraint if only unimodality and Lipschitzness of the cost function are assumed. While it seems that smoothness is necessary to obtain the near-optimal regret rate of 𝒪~​(T)~𝒪𝑇\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T}) in our setting (since smoothness is fundamental to controlling overshooting of the optimum), we are hopeful that the strong convexity assumption can be relaxed (to, e.g., just assuming convexity) without impacting the regret guarantee. Extensions to online convex optimization. It would be interesting to consider algorithm design for satisfying FTD in the general context of online convex optimization, which models scenarios where the utility function 𝒰𝒰\\mathcal{U}, though convex, changes over time [ref]45. In such scenarios, even with perfect gradient feedback (since the utility functions Utsubscript𝑈𝑡U_{t} are assumed to be known in each period) it would be interesting to characterize conditions on the arriving functions under which sublinear regret rates can be attained while satisfying FTD. Time decay. Certain fairness goals may not be subsumed by the FTD objective; as such, there is room for generalizing or adapting FTD to better fit specific objectives. For example, one may wish to incorporate a time-decay element to the envy-freeness constraint, which can be achieved by having the slack functions s𝑠s be dependent on the difference in the times at which the decisions were received by the two groups. In particular, we may have that xi​(t)≥xi​(t′)−s​(i,i,t−t′)subscript𝑥𝑖𝑡subscript𝑥𝑖superscript𝑡′𝑠𝑖𝑖𝑡superscript𝑡′x_{i}(t)\\geq x_{i}(t^{\\prime})-s(i,i,t-t^{\\prime}) for all t≥t′𝑡superscript𝑡′t\\geq t^{\\prime}, where the slack function now also takes the time difference t−t′𝑡superscript𝑡′t-t^{\\prime} as input. If s𝑠s is assumed to be increasing in the time difference, this would allow for greater changes in decisions over time. Finally, we note that temporal considerations can be required or suggested for compliance with laws or policy. For example, applicant-screeners often ensure approximate demographic parity for the purpose of avoiding disparate impact litigation , and this constraint constrains current decisions by prior decisions. So-called “mandated progress” legislation, such as affirmative action—which has been adopted and, in some cases, mandated in the U.S., Canada, and France—can similarly be thought of as a temporal constraint in which goals must be set and a current decision is thus constrained by past decisions . In terms of loan-granting, Wells Fargo was recently sued for racial dicrimination in mortgage lending, including offering different average interest rates to Black applicants than white applicants over a period of time , which again points to the potential for the use of temporal fairness constraints as a preventative measure for avoiding litigation. Some times these constraints can be enforced due to necessity of protecting consumer rights in the prevelant societal context, e.g., price gouging laws may dictate bounded increase in decisions, during the duration of the pandemic (McQueen and Ballinger v. Amazon.com). In general, the case law surrounding algorithmic approaches to ensuring fairness is not yet well-developed, thus leaving many questions open. However, we believe that it is important to get ahead of such restrictions and to understand the limitations of algorithms to provide guidance to legal scholarship on the possibilities.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: Beyond strong convexity.
