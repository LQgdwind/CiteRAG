      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Occupancy Function from Point Clouds for Surface Reconstruction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere has been a vast amount of effort devoted to the study of 3D surface reconstruction in the past several decades. These approaches work with different surface representations, reconstructing parametric surfaces  [ref]10 , polygon meshes  , or implicit functions of the surface  . The last category above is most relevant to our work. These methods produce as reconstructed shape an iso-surface or level-set of a volumetric representation of shapes, either Signed Distance Fields (SDFs), partial derivative fields, or indicator functions. Early works   fit the tangent plane locally to compute a distance field and triangulating its zero-set. Since they require a good estimation of the tangent planes, if the point cloud is sparsely or non-uniformly sampled, incomplete, noisy, or misaligned, their performance is poor. Moving Least Square (MLS) methods   approximate the shape with spatial low-degree polynomial and recover SDFs with least square optimization. Other approaches    formulate it as a volumetric shape estimation problem. In this way, volume smoothness prior (other than surface smoothness prior) is imposed and results in better robustness. Poisson surface reconstructions recover implicit function from oriented points (i.e., location and surface normal tuples). Oriented points are viewed as a discrete sampling of indicator functions’ gradient field.  solves this Poisson problem by transforming it into the Fourier domain, computing Fourier coefficients of the indicator function, and  solve it directly in a coarse-to-fine hierarchical manner. Poisson methods require a good surface normal estimation beforehand. Among the traditional methods, the RBFs based methods  could be viewed as a hand-crafted version of our method. Carr et al.  use overlapped RBFs to approximate SDFs. RBFs centers are scattered around the input points (on-surface) and along the direction of local surface normals (off-surface). Coefficients are associated with each RBF, and they are optimized to fit input points to approximate SDFs. In our occupancy function learning method, the learned feature fields are also composed of RBFs. The counterparts of the off-surface RBF centers are the elements in the RBF filter kernels. The RBFs centers are scatted in all directions and have varied scales and offsets in different PCNN layer. RBFs are weighted by the hidden nodes’ outputs, non-linearly depending on the network’s parameters (learned shape prior) and the input point cloud (one instance of observation).\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: vast amount of effort devoted to the study of 3D surface reconstruction in the past several decades.
