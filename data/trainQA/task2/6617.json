      "content": "Paper Title: Is Imitation All You Need? Generalized Decision-Making with Dual-Phase Training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTransformer-based models, combined with large-scale data, have shown success in generalizing across various tasks in both language and vision.\nNotable examples include BERT 1, GPT [ref]28, MAE 6, CLIP  and Flamingo , etc.\nRecently, there has been a significant focus on developing such general-purpose models for sequential decision-making and control tasks, such as GATO . The prominent approach is to train a decoder-only Transformer with Imitation Learning (IL) on massive datasets from all targeted tasks. By training with prompts, the model can perform zero-shot inference with just task prompts. However, such IL-based approaches to general-purpose models face limitations when it comes to sequential control tasks, as highlighted below:\n(1) Memorizing behaviors hinders generalization to diverse tasks:\nImitating expert behaviors can lead to memorization and over-fitting of specific behaviors that may not be applicable to new situations or variations of tasks, thus limiting the model’s ability to generalize. This limitation is particularly challenging when dealing with a wide range of decision-making tasks that have vastly different configurations, transition functions, and state and action spaces.\n(2) Dependence on high-quality data impedes practical application:\nIL methods rely heavily on the availability of high-quality expert demonstrations, which can be difficult and expensive to obtain. When the available data is of low quality or not representative of the target task, the performance of the model may suffer.\n In light of the aforementioned limitations, self-supervised pretraining has emerged as a viable solution. By focusing on learning common underlying information, a pretrained model can be better equipped to handle diverse tasks. Recently, a study known as SMART  has demonstrated the potential of self-supervised pretraining for multi-task decision-making. Although SMART has shown promising results in promoting generalization, it still requires additional fine-tuning to adapt to each task. Furthermore, it has only been demonstrated on a small set of tasks on Deepmind control suite (DMC) .\nFor decision-making problems that involve numerous tasks with different configurations, finetuning the model for each task can become time-consuming and resource-intensive.\n Given the limitations of both IL and self-supervised pretraining discussed earlier, a natural question arises: How can we develop a decision-making approach that achieves a high degree of generalization without requiring task-specific fine-tuning? In this paper, we propose DualMind, a generalist agent, to address this question, which stands for our proposed Dual-phase training scheme.\nThe name ‘DualMind’ is derived from our main idea of Dual-phase training for generalized decision-making.\nOur approach introduces an Encoder-Decoder Control Transformer (Enc-Dec Control Transformer) that models state-action interactions from complex high-dimensional observations.\nTo further improve computational efficiency, DualMind uses TokenLearner  as an attention-based Information Bottleneck (IB)  to compress the number of tokens so that to speed up training and inference.\nBuilding upon Enc-Dec Control Transformer, we propose a Dual-phase training scheme that initially prioritizes policy-independent transition probabilities and encourages the model to capture both short- and long-term temporal granularities. To facilitate zero-shot prompting, we train a second phase on a small fraction of model parameters to learn a generic policy by conditioning on various prompts (such as images, annotations, and language instructions) using a cross-attention mechanism (XAtten.).\nThe Dual-phase training scheme parallels how humans learn to act in the world by first learning underlying common knowledge and subsequently making decisions based on different contexts.\nOur contributions are summarized below: We propose DualMind, a solution for general-purpose decision-making that can handle various tasks using a single set of weights without task-specific fine-tuning. We introduce a Dual-phase training scheme that overcomes limitations of IL and self-supervised learning. We propose an Encoder-Decoder Transformer (Enc-Dec Control Transformer) that efficiently learns state-action transitions from high-dimensional observation spaces. We conduct extensive experiments on Metaworld  and Habitat  and show that DualMind outperforms other generalist agents by over 50%percent\\% and 70%percent\\% on Habitat and MetaWorld, respectively. We also analyze and ablate different design choices to demonstrate the superior generalizability of DualMind.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: Transformer-based models, combined with large-scale data, have shown success in generalizing across various tasks in both language and vision.\nNotable examples include BERT 1, GPT [ref]28, MAE 6, CLIP  and Flamingo , etc.\nRecently, there has been a significant focus on developing such general-purpose models for sequential decision-making and control tasks, such as GATO .
