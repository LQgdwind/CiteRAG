      "content": "Paper Title: An Energy-Efficient Edge Computing Paradigm for Convolution-based Image Upsampling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLocal edge devices are often limited by battery life and hardware area which constrains the power budget and on-chip resources available for inference¬† [ref]26.\nTo support real-time deep learning applications, low latency and high energy efficiency become critical.\nUsing the quantitative models detailed in Section¬†5, we analyze and compare the properties of convolution-based upsampling algorithms using metrics of time and energy.\nReal-time image upsampling applications, such as single-image super resolution, typically process images sequentially in batch sizes of 1.\nWhen considering such applications, we define latency as the time cost incurred by upsampling a single image.\nWe evaluate energy efficiency under two metrics.\nFirst, we use energy per pixel to evaluate the energy cost incurred by upsampling a single image¬†.\nThis is defined as the total energy cost divided by the total output pixels generated and is measured in units of Joules/pixel¬†.\nSecond, we use performance per energy to evaluate the rate of computation for every unit of energy consumed.\nThis is defined as the total useful computations divided by the total energy cost and, as the energy analog of throughput, is measured in units of MACs/Joule¬†.\nUsing these metrics, we validate the use of kernel transformations in our proposed edge computing paradigm assuming REVD2 as the low-level deconvolution algorithm. As shown in Table¬†2, the compute (Cùê∂C) and activation requirements (Aùê¥A) of the sub-pixel convolution (C-SP) and nearest neighbor resize convolution (C-NN) are equal121212For simplicity of analysis, we ignore the impact of address calculations and modulo arithmetic..\nWith activations dominating memory requirements (MùëÄM) and, therefore, data transfer penalties, the variations in weight requirements (WùëäW) have negligible impact on time and energy costs.\nBy translating their learned kernels for deconvolution inference, the kernel transformations introduced in Section¬†4 remove the reliance of C-SP and C-NN on the memory-intensive feature map transformations that increase activate requirements.\nWe highlight the following implications of this reduction in memory accesses, assuming REVD2 as the low-level deconvolution inference algorithm. \n Alleviating pressure on memory bandwidth significantly reduces system latency.\nThe detrimental impact of memory-intensive feature map transformations on C-SP and C-NN increases with upsampling factor.\nTranslating C-SP to D-SP removes its reliance on the pixel shuffle post-processing and, as discussed in Section¬†4, translating C-NN to D-NN significantly reduces the total MACs required when removing its reliance on interpolation pre-processing.\nFigure¬†11a shows that the time cost of each algorithm increases with upsampling factor rùëür using the optimistic computational model detailed in Section¬†5.1.\nIn our experiments, upsampling an image by a factor of 2 using D-SP decreases system latency by 2.2x when compared to C-SP and using D-NN decreases system latency by 2.6x when compared to C-NN. Reducing activation requirements and, therefore, data transfers significantly reduces the energy cost of upsampling an image.\nEnergy consumption is dominated by data movement¬†.\nWith activation requirements dominating memory accesses, removing the memory-intensive feature map transformations of C-SP and C-NN reduces the energy consumed when generating an output image.\nFigure¬†11b shows how the energy cost of each algorithm increases with upsampling factor rùëür using the optimistic computational model detailed in Section¬†5.1.\nAs each algorithm is generating an r‚ÄãH√ór‚ÄãH√óCùëüùêªùëüùêªùê∂rH\\times rH\\times C output image, we interpret this as the relative increase in energy per pixel.\nIn our experiments, upsampling an image by a factor of 2 using D-SP decreases the energy per pixel by 2.1x when compared to C-SP and using D-NN decreases the energy per pixel by 2.5x when compared to C-NN. Reducing data transfers significantly improves the rate of computation for every unit of energy consumed.\nAs discussed in Section¬†5.2, activation reuse is defined as the ratio of useful compute work to activation requirements.\nThe activation reuse of convolution-based upsampling algorithms is tightly correlated with performance per energy (PPE)¬†.\nFigure¬†12 shows how the activation reuse of each convolution-based upsampling algorithm increases with upsampling factor rùëür.\nWhile removing reliance on memory-intensive feature map transformations improves the PPE of D-SP, it reduces the PPE of D-NN as the reduction in MACs significantly outweighs the reduction in memory accesses.\nThis imbalanced reduction ultimately renders D-NN memory-bound as the amount of compute work grows slower than the amount of memory accessed. Reducing memory accesses improves algorithm scalability.\nThe ratio of useful computations to memory accesses, i.e. arithmetic intensity, implies the scalability of an algorithm.\nAs described in Section¬†5.3, algorithms with an arithmetic intensity lower than the machine balance point are ultimately bound by memory bandwidth¬†.\nAlgorithms with an arithmetic intensity higher than the machine balance point are ultimately bound by compute resources and are more likely to see performance gains as resources scale¬†.\nFor each convolution-based upsampling algorithm, we use the roofline models depicted in Figure¬†13 to visualize the relationships of their arithmetic intensities to the time and energy machine balance points of NVIDIA‚Äôs GeForce GTX 680.\nWe further show how these relationships change with upsampling factor in Figure¬†14.\nUnlike C-SP, C-NN, and even D-NN, D-SP remains compute-bound in both time and energy as upsampling factor increases.\nWith compute work dominating memory accesses, the increased arithmetic intensity of D-SP implies increased time and energy efficiency as compute resources scale¬†. These trends do not hold for all selections of deconvolution formulations.\nDeep learning frameworks commonly use the fractionally strided deconvolutionn (STRD) formulation to leverage unmodified convolution accelerators¬† .\nHowever, the zero-insertion requirements on the input feature maps exponentially increase the data transfer penalties.\nFigure¬†10 shows how time and energy costs increase with upsampling factor.\nWhen upsampling by a factor of 2, using REVD2 reduces latency by 1.6x and reduces energy per pixel by 1.9x in our experiments.\nAs shown in Table¬†1, the compute and activation requirements of transforming deconvolution to convolution (TDC) are the same as REVD2.\nAs such, the TDC zero-insertion requirements on the learned kernels have negligible impact on high resolution images.\nHowever, as discussed in Section¬†3, the functional correctness breaks down when attempting to tile the workloads in sizes not evenly divisible by the stride SùëÜS.\nWhile this penalty does not show in our simplified quantitative model of hardware performance, we aim to quantify this impact in future work.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: Local edge devices are often limited by battery life and hardware area which constrains the power budget and on-chip resources available for inference¬† [ref]26.\nTo support real-time deep learning applications, low latency and high energy efficiency become critical.\nUsing the quantitative models detailed in Section¬†5, we analyze and compare the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
