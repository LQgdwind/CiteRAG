      "content": "Paper Title: GraphFM: Graph Factorization Machines for Feature Interaction Modeling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPredictive analytics is a fundamental task in machine learning (ML) and data mining (DM). Given features as input, the goal is to infer a function to predict the target, such as a real value for regression, categorical labels for classification, etc.\nIt is especially critical for many web applications such as online advertising  and recommender systems  [ref]15.\nDistinct from continuous features which can be naturally found in images and audios, the features for web applications are mostly sparse and categorical.\nWhen performing predictive analytics on these features, it is important to account for the interactions between them.\nLet us consider a toy example of predicting users’s preference for movies given features with five categorical variables: (1) Language = {English, Chinese, Japanese, … }, (2) Genre = {action, fiction, … }, (3) Director = {Ang Lee, Christopher Nolan, … }, (4) Stars = {Bruce Lee, Leonardo DiCaprio, … } and (5) Release Date = {1991, 1992, … }.\nIt is important for models to capture the cross features (aka feature interactions).\nFor example, the 3-order cross feature (Genre = fiction, Director = Christopher Nolan, Starring = Leonardo DiCaprio) or (Language = Chinese, Genre = action, Starring = Bruce Lee) may infer higher user preferences. Factorization machine (FM)   is an effective and popular approach to modeling such feature interactions.\nThe key idea of FM is to learn a latent vector of each one-hot encoded feature, and then model their pairwise (second-order) interactions via inner product of the respective vectors.\nOwing to the simplicity and effectiveness, FM has been widely used in many work in recommender systems and CTR predictions   [ref]54.\nHowever, since FM considers all the feature interactions, it has two major drawbacks. First, FM is not capable of capturing higher-order feature interactions.\nIn fact, higher-order FM (HOFM) that models higher-order feature interactions has been introduced in the original work of FM  . However, in practice it suffers from the high complexity due to combinatorial expansion.\nLater numerous variants of FM that leverage Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to learn high-order feature interactions have been proposed [ref]54 [ref]15  [ref]13.\nFactorisation-machine supported Neural Networks (FNNs) [ref]54 apply DNN on top of pre-trained factorization machines to model high-order interactions.\nNeural Factorization Machines (NFM) [ref]15 design a bi-interaction layer to learn the pairwise feature interaction and apply DNN to learn the higher-order ones.\nWide&Deep  and DeepFM [ref]13 introduce hybrid architecture containing a shallow component and deep one, in order to jointly learn both the low-order and high-order feature interactions.\nHowever, these models based on DNNs learn high-order feature interactions in a bit-wise, implicit fashion.\nThey typically lack persuasive rationales to explain the outcomes of the models. Second, considering the interactions between every pair of features is suboptimal as some feature interactions may not be beneficial to the prediction.\nModeling these unhelpful feature interactions will introduce noise and cause overfitting  .\nTaking the example of a movie again, the feature interactions between Language and Release Date might not be beneficial to the prediction as their interactions fail to provide beneficial information to the prediction.\nModeling these irrelevant feature interactions will not provide helpful information, but instead makes it harder to train the model. Currently, Graph Neural Networks (GNN)    have emerged as an effective class of models in capturing high-order relations between nodes in a graph.\nIt has achieved state-of-the-art performance on various tasks such as computer vision , neural language processing   and recommender systems  .\nAs its core, GNNs learn node embeddings by iteratively aggregating features from their neighborhoods layer by layer.\nConsequently, the high-order relations between nodes can be explicitly encoded in the embeddings by stacking layers.\nGNN has shown great potential in modeling high-order feature interactions for CTR prediction.\nFi-GNN  proposes to connect each pair of features and thus the multi-field features can be viewed as a fully-connected graph.\nThen it utilizes Gated Graph Neural Network (GGNN) , a kind of GNN to model feature interactions on the feature graph.\nHowever, on the one had, not all feature interactions are beneficial, on the other hand, GNN is based on the assumption that the neighbors share similar features, which doesn’t conform to the nature of feature interaction modeling. In summary, when dealing with feature interactions, FM suffers intrinsic drawbacks. We thus propose a novel model Graph Factorization Machine (GraphFM), which takes advantage of GNN to overcome the problems of FM for feature interaction modeling.\nBy treating features as nodes and feature interactions as the edges between them, the selected beneficial feature interactions can be viewed as a graph. We thus devise a novel technique to select the beneficial feature interactions, which is also to infer the graph structure.\nThen we adopt an attentional aggregation strategy to aggregate these selected beneficial interactions together to update the feature representations.\nSpecifically, to accommodate the polysemy of feature interactions in different semantic spaces, we utilize a multi-head attention mechanism  .\nEach layer of our proposed model produces higher-order interactions based on the existing ones and thus the highest-order of interactions is determined by layer depth.\nSince our proposed approach selects the beneficial feature interactions and models them in an explicit manner, it has high efficiency in analyzing high-order feature interactions and thus provide rationales on the model outcome.\nThrough extensive experiments conducted on CTR benchmark and recommender system datasets, we verify the rationality, effectiveness, and interpretability of our proposed approach. Overall, the main contributions of this work can be summarized as: We analyze the shortcomings and strengths of FM and GNN in modeling feature interactions. To solve their problems and leverage strengths, we propose a novel model GraphFM for feature interaction modeling. By treating features as nodes and their pairwise feature interactions as edges, we bridge the gap between GNN and FM, and makes it feasible to leverage the strength of GNN to solve the problem of FM. Extensive experiments are conducted on CTR benchmark and recommender system datasets to evaluate the effectiveness and interpretability of our proposed method. We show that GraphFM can provide persuasive rationales on the feature interaction modeling and prediction making process.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: the target, such as a real value for regression, categorical labels for classification, etc.\nIt is especially critical for many web applications such as online advertising  and recommender systems  [ref]15.\nDistinct from continuous features which can be naturally found in images and audios, the features for web applications are mostly sparse and categorical.\nWhen performing predictive analytics\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
