      "content": "Paper Title: Data Streaming and Traffic Gathering in Mesh-based NoC for Deep Neural Network Acceleration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely adopted for a variety of applications, ranging from speech recognition, object detection and self-driving cars, to cancer detection, drug discovery, and genomics   [ref]3. DNNs are able to extract high-level features from input data, as in statistical learning, compared to hand-picked features from classic machine learning. This has enabled DNNs to achieve human-level accuracy, which comes at the cost of high communication and computation complexity. High complexity in DNNs is simply attributed to the huge number of parameters and multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations. Fig. 1 shows the number of weights and MAC operations used in some of the popular DNN models. AlexNet [ref]4 consists of 61M weights and 724M MACs, while VGG-16  consists of 138M weights and 15.5G MACs. DNNs include the training phase and the inference phase. In the training phase, learning is involved in determining the network weights and the biases. The inference phase is actually the process of taking the inputs from the user or sensor and make use of the weights and biases obtained during the training phase to get the estimated result. Training DNNs often requires the use of a large dataset and is more computation-intensive than inference. Training is also a time-consuming process that may take up to several weeks at a cloud/data center. On the other hand, an inference can be employed even on edge devices like mobile phones. Due to the involvement of a huge amount of parameters (weights and biases Fig. 1), it is not possible to store all of these parameters in the local memory of the processing elements (PEs). Different levels of memory, from DRAM with high access cost to register files with low access cost , are commonly used in DNN accelerators, which imposes the challenge of optimizing data movement in the memory hierarchy. In a DNN accelerator, PEs perform MAC operations, while the involved parameters are usually stored in the global memory. There is a need to transfer data from global memory to PEs, and vice versa. PEs and the memory elements are often interconnected by a Networks-on-Chip (NoC)    to realize high throughput. These PEs operate in parallel and reduce the memory access as much as possible by sharing and reusing the parameters with each other, especially in spatial architectures. As the communication backbone 0 1 2 of a DNN accelerator, NoC play an important role in supporting various traffic patterns and dataflow models, enabling processing with communication parallelism and enhancing scalability. NoC also offer a modular design property that helps in power gating. Mesh is a widely adopted NoC topology that is scalable and can support a large number of PEs. The artificial intelligence (AI) computing system from Cerebras 3 uses 2D mesh as a communication topology to connect thousands of AI cores. Groq 4 reorganizes 2D mesh into functional slices to optimize the microarchitecture. Existing mesh-based accelerator systems focus more on improving scalability and data reuse, and a little attention is given to enhancing communication support. Hence, this study is focused on efficient communication support for mesh-based DNN accelerators. Observing the nature of data traffic in DNN processing, there are many inputs/weights transferred from the global memory to PEs and results (like partial sums) collected from PEs to the global memory. This traffic can be classified as one-to-many (multicast) and many-to-one (gather) traffic, respectively. In the literature, different approaches have been proposed to support multicast traffic in NoCs 2 5. Noticeably, in a DNN workload, the multicast traffic tends to have a fixed communication pattern. Thus, existing multicast algorithms may not be suitable for DNN workloads. In addition, support of gather traffic has not been well addressed in NoCs, as many-to-one traffic rarely occurs in conventional parallel workloads. In this work, based on the observation that the multicast traffic in DNN workloads has the same source and destination set most of the time, we propose a modified mesh architecture with a one-way/two-way streaming bus to speedup the input and weight distribution in an NoC. In support of the many-to-one type of traffic on a mesh-based NoC, gather packets are used to efficiently deliver the partial sum results to the global memory. Streaming architectures and gather packets can be used on different dataflow models. To evaluate the performance of the proposed modified mesh-based architecture with gather support, analysis and simulations are conducted on the output stationary dataflow model using Alexnet [ref]4 and VGG-16  as a DNN workload, and compared with the conventional repetitive unicast method. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews dataflow models, NoC architectures, and communication support proposed for DNN accelerators. Section 3 provides the background and motivation behind this work. In Section 4, we describe the proposed methods and analyze data streaming architecture and gather support improvement. Section 5 presents the experimental results of the proposed methods. Section 6 concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely adopted for a variety of applications, ranging from speech recognition, object detection and self-driving cars, to cancer detection, drug discovery, and genomics   [ref]3.
