      "content": "Paper Title: Optimal Testing of Generalized Reed-Muller Codes in Fewer Queries\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe Reed-Muller Code is a widely used code with many applications in complexity theory, and more broadly in theoretical computer science.\nOne reason for this is that the Reed-Muller code enjoys very good local testability properties which are crucial in many applications (for example, in the construction\nof probabilistically checkable proofs). The primary goal of this paper is to present local testers for Reed-Muller codes over extension fields with improved query\ncomplexity, which additionally satisfy a stronger notion of soundness known as optimal testing. Throughout this paper, p∈ℕ𝑝ℕp\\in\\mathbb{N} is a prime and q=pk𝑞superscript𝑝𝑘q=p^{k} is a prime power, where k𝑘k should be thought of as moderately large (so that q𝑞q is significantly larger than p𝑝p). For a degree parameter d∈ℕ𝑑ℕd\\in\\mathbb{N}\nand a number of variables parameter n∈ℕ𝑛ℕn\\in\\mathbb{N}, the Reed-Muller code consists of all evaluation vectors of degree d𝑑d polynomials f:𝔽qn→𝔽q:𝑓→superscriptsubscript𝔽𝑞𝑛subscript𝔽𝑞f\\colon\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}\\to\\mathbb{F}_{q}. That\nis, When k>1𝑘1k>1, RM⁡[n,q,d]RM𝑛𝑞𝑑\\operatorname{RM}[n,q,d] is sometimes called a generalized Reed-Muller code, to distinguish from the prime field case, and as the title suggests, our results are most relevant to this case. However, henceforth, we will refer to them as Reed-Muller codes for simplicity. Abusing notation, we will not distinguish functions and their evaluations when referring to codewords. That is, for f:𝔽qn→𝔽q:𝑓absent→superscriptsubscript𝔽𝑞𝑛subscript𝔽𝑞f:\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}\\xrightarrow[]{}\\mathbb{F}_{q}, we will simply say f∈RM⁡[n,q,d]𝑓RM𝑛𝑞𝑑f\\in\\operatorname{RM}[n,q,d] if deg⁡(f)⩽ddegree𝑓𝑑\\deg(f)\\leqslant d and we will view the codewords of RM⁡[n,q,d]RM𝑛𝑞𝑑\\operatorname{RM}[n,q,d] themselves as functions. When talking about the degree of a function f𝑓f, we mean the total degree when f𝑓f is written as a polynomial. Given a proximity parameter δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0, the goal in the problem of local testing of Reed-Muller codes is to design a randomized tester 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} that makes Q𝑄Q oracle queries (for Q𝑄Q which is as small as possible)\nto a given function f:𝔽qn→𝔽q:𝑓→superscriptsubscript𝔽𝑞𝑛subscript𝔽𝑞f\\colon\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}\\to\\mathbb{F}_{q} such that: Completeness: if f𝑓f is a polynomial of degree at most d𝑑d, then 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} accepts with probability 111. Soundness: if f𝑓f is δ𝛿\\delta-far from all degree d𝑑d polynomials, then the tester 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} rejects with probability at least 2/3232/3. Reed-Muller codes have a very natural and well studied local test     called the t𝑡t-flat test.\nThis test has its origins in the study of probabilistically checkable proofs 5   4 [ref]4 2 (as it is related to the well known\nplane versus plane, plane versus line and line versus point tests), as well as in the theory of Gowers’ uniformity norms 6. To check if a given function f𝑓f is indeed low\ndegree, the tester samples a random t𝑡t-dimensional affine subspace U⊆𝔽qn𝑈superscriptsubscript𝔽𝑞𝑛U\\subseteq\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}, queries f​(x→)𝑓→𝑥f(\\vec{x}) for all x→∈U→𝑥𝑈\\vec{x}\\in U and checks whether the resulting\nt𝑡t-variate function f|Uevaluated-at𝑓𝑈f|_{U} has degree at most d𝑑d. Clearly the number of queries made is qtsuperscript𝑞𝑡q^{t}, and it is also clear that the test is complete: if f𝑓f has degree at most d𝑑d, then\nthe tester always accepts.\nAs for the soundness, it is known that one can take t=⌈d+1q−q/p⌉𝑡𝑑1𝑞𝑞𝑝t=\\lceil\\frac{d+1}{q-q/p}\\rceil and get that the tester is somewhat sound , meaning that the rejection probability is bounded\naway from 00 (as opposed to at least 2/3232/3). Indeed, a typical local-testing result shows that if a function f𝑓f is δ𝛿\\delta-far from being a degree d𝑑d function, then\nthe tester rejects it with probability at least ε=ε​(q,d,δ)>0𝜀𝜀𝑞𝑑𝛿0\\varepsilon=\\varepsilon(q,d,\\delta)>0, which is a quantity that typically vanishes with the various parameters. To amplify the soundness, one\nrepeats the tester θ​(1/ε)𝜃1𝜀\\theta(1/\\varepsilon) time sequentially to get 2/3232/3 rejection probability, thereby giving a tester whose query complexity is O​(qt/ε)𝑂superscript𝑞𝑡𝜀O(q^{t}/\\varepsilon) and whose soundness is at least 2/3232/3. Such testers for the Reed-Muller have been known for a long time. Indeed, in  the t𝑡t-flat tester is analyzed and it is shown that the rejection probability\nof the basic tester is at least ε⩾Ω​(δ/qt)𝜀Ω𝛿superscript𝑞𝑡\\varepsilon\\geqslant\\Omega(\\delta/q^{t}) leading to a tester with query complexity O​(q2​t/δ)𝑂superscript𝑞2𝑡𝛿O(q^{2t}/\\delta). This soundness analysis turns out to not\nbe optimal, and indeed, as we explain below, follow-up works have shown a better analysis of the t𝑡t-flat tester.\nIn particular, it was shown that the t𝑡t-flat tester is an optimal tester.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: at least 2/3232/3.
