      "content": "Paper Title: Photonic Reconfigurable Accelerators for Efficient Inference of CNNs with Mixed-Sized Tensors\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown record-breaking performance for implementing various real-world artificial intelligence tasks such as image recognition, language translation, and autonomous driving    [ref]4. The ever-increasing complexity of CNNs has pushed for highly customized CNN hardware accelerators . Among them, silicon-photonic CNN accelerators have shown great promise to provide unparalleled throughput, ultra-low latency, and high energy efficiency     0 1. Typically, a silicon-photonic CNN accelerator consists of multiple Tensor Product Cores (TPCs) that perform multiple tensor products in parallel. Several TPC-based photonic CNN accelerators have been proposed in prior works based on various silicon-photonic devices, such as Mach Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) (e.g., 2,3,4) and Microring Resonator (MRR) (e.g., 0 1 5,6). Among these TPC-based photonic CNN accelerators from prior work, the MRR-enabled TPC-based accelerators (e.g., 7 6 0 1 5) have shown disruptive performance and energy efficiencies for processing CNN tensor products, due to the MRRs’ compact footprint, low dynamic power consumption, and compatibility with cascaded Dense-Wavelength-Division-Multiplexing (DWDM). The MRR-enabled TPCs of these accelerators transform CNN tensor products into Vector Dot Products (VDPs) by decomposing the input tensors into vectors (1D tensors). The VDP operations are performed on the individual VDP Elements (VDPEs), which are the main MRR-enabled hardware components in a TPC. Multiple VDPEs in a TPC can perform multiple VDP operations in parallel. The results of these VDP operations can be summed together (when needed) using a partial-sum (psum) reduction network, which can be employed outside of the TPCs as part of the post-processing components of the CNN accelerator. The functioning of the TPCs and their constituent VDPEs in the ultra-high-speed photonic domain results in disruptive throughput for processing tensors. However, the existing MRR-enabled TPC-based accelerators are not efficient in processing modern CNNs with mixed-sized tensors, such as Xception 8 and MobileNetV1 9. This is because these modern CNNs utilize depthwise separable convolutions in addition to the standard convolutions. Depthwise separable convolutions in a CNN employ reduced sized tensors compared to the standard convolutions, to reduce the overall computational load of processing the CNN. For instance, MobileNetV1 shows 8-9×\\times reduction in its computational load with only 1% accuracy drop 9. But the existing MRR-enabled TPCs and their constituent VDPEs have fixed sizes. Therefore, mapping the processing of the modern CNNs with mixed-sized tensors 0 on such fixed-sized TPCs often leads to a low hardware utilization in the TPCs. This in turn diminishes the achievable performance and energy efficiency from such fixed-sized TPCs-based accelerators.\nThis is because the low hardware utilization incurs non-amortizable area and static power overheads while also idling away the opportunity for increasing the processing throughput. To address this shortcoming, in this paper, we present a novel way of introducing reconfigurability in the MRR-enabled TPCs-based CNN accelerators, to enable efficient support for both depthwise separable convolutions and standard convolutions. To enable this reconfigurability, we invent reconfigurable VDPEs that employ MRR-based comb switches to allow re-aggregation of the CNN vectors (decomposed 1D tensors) to consequently enable dynamic resizing of the produced VDP results. Our evaluations show that our invented reconfigurable VDPEs can (1) substantially improve the hardware utilization, (2) enhance the flexibility of processing CNN tensors of various sizes, (3) improve the opportunities for parallel tensor processing, and (4) significantly enhance the energy efficiency, for CNN inference acceleration. Our key contributions in this paper are summarized below: We review several state-of-the-art MRR-enabled TPC-based CNN accelerators from prior work and then classify the circuit-level TPC organizations used in these accelerators into two categories, namely AMM and MAM (Section III-A); We perform the scalability analysis of TPCs of AMM and MAM categories to capture the inter-dependence of the maximum achievable TPC size, bit precision, and operating bit rate (Section III-B); We map the processing of four state-of-the-art CNNs with mixed-sized tensors on the TPCs of AMM and MAM categories to evaluate the hardware utilization of the TPCs, to consequently establish the need for reconfigurability in the AMM and MAM-styled TPCs (Section IV); We invent a novel reconfigurable structure for VDPEs, and utilize these VDPEs to modify the AMM and MAM TPCs, to render these TPCs with the capabilities of dynamic re-aggregation of vectors for adaptive resizing of the processed VDPs (Section V); We evaluate the performance of our designed reconfigurable MAM and AMM TPC organizations for the inference of four modern CNNs in terms of Frames-Per-Second (FPS), FPS/W, and compare it with three different AMM- and MAM-styled CNN accelerators from prior work, with area proportionate outlook for which we set the area of all our evaluated accelerators to be equal (Section VI).\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Networks (CNNs) have shown record-breaking performance for implementing various real-world artificial intelligence tasks such as image recognition, language translation, and autonomous driving    [ref]4.
