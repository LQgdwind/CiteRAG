      "content": "Paper Title: Component Analysis for Visual Question Answering Architectures\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent research advances in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) introduced several tasks that are quite challenging to be solved, the so-called AI-complete problems. Most of those tasks require systems that understand information from multiple sources, i.e., semantics from visual and textual data, in order to provide some kind of reasoning. For instance, image captioning    presents itself as a hard task to solve, though it is actually challenging to quantitatively evaluate models on that task, and that recent studies [ref]4 have raised questions on its AI-completeness. The Visual Question Answering (VQA) [ref]4 task was introduced as an attempt to solve that issue: to be an actual AI-complete problem whose performance is easy to evaluate. It requires a system that receives as input an image and a free-form, open-ended, natural-language question to produce a natural-language answer as the output [ref]4. It is a multidisciplinary topic that is gaining popularity by encompassing CV and NLP into a single architecture, what is usually regarded as a multimodal model   . There are many real-world applications for models trained for Visual Question Answering, such as automatic surveillance video queries  and visually-impaired aiding  0. Models trained for VQA are required to understand the semantics from images while finding relationships with the asked question. Therefore, those models must present a deep understanding of the image to properly perform inference and produce a reasonable answer to the visual question 1. In addition, it is much easier to evaluate this task since there is a finite set of possible answers for each image-question pair. Traditionally, VQA approaches comprise three major steps: (i) representation learning of the image and the question; (ii) projection of a single multimodal representation through fusion and attention modules that are capable of leveraging both visual and textual information; and (iii) the generation of the natural language answer to the question at hand.\nThis task often requires sophisticated models that are able to understand a question expressed in text, identify relevant elements of the image, and evaluate how these two inputs correlate. Given the current interest of the scientific community in VQA, many recent advances try to improve individual components such as the image encoder, the question representation, or the fusion and attention strategies to better leverage both information sources.\nWith so many approaches currently being introduced at the same time, it becomes unclear the real contribution and importance of each component within the proposed models. Thus, the main goal of this work is to understand the impact of each component on a proposed baseline architecture, which draws inspiration from the pioneer VQA model [ref]4 (Fig. 1). Each component within that architecture is then systematically tested, allowing us to understand its impact on the system’s final performance through a thorough set of experiments and ablation analysis. More specifically, we observe the impact of: (i) pre-trained word embeddings 2 3, recurrent 4 and transformer-based sentence encoders 5 as question representation strategies; (ii) distinct convolutional neural networks used for visual feature extraction 6 7 8; and (iii) standard fusion strategies, as well as the importance of two main attention mechanisms 9 0. We notice that even using a relatively simple baseline architecture, our best models are competitive to the (maybe overly-complex) state-of-the-art models 1 2.\nGiven the experimental nature of this work, we have trained over 130 neural network models, accounting for more than 600 GPU processing hours. We expect our findings to be useful as guidelines for training novel VQA models, and that they serve as a basis for the development of future architectures that seek to maximize predictive performance.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: of reasoning.
