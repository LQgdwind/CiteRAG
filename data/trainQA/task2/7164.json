      "content": "Paper Title: On the Uniqueness of Bayesian Coarse Correlated Equilibria in Standard First-Price and All-Pay Auctions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we introduce the continuous and discrete single-item auction models we use in this paper, and discuss known results on the (C)CE of complete and incomplete auction games. We focus on the standard symmetric setting where buyers are risk-neutral and have independent private valuations drawn i.i.d. from some distribution F𝐹F and quasi-linear utilities. Our results in Section 3.3 and 4 on the set of Bayesian (C)CE of these auction games will thus provide a partial explanation why equilibria of these auctions are practically learnable. The data of a single-item auction is specified by a tuple A=(N,𝒱,FN,ℬ,u)𝐴𝑁𝒱superscript𝐹𝑁ℬ𝑢A=\\left(N,\\mathcal{V},F^{N},\\mathcal{B},u\\right), where N𝑁N is the number of buyers. The set of vectors of valuations buyers may have for the item for sale form the set of vectors of types, and equals 𝒱=×i∈[N]V\\mathcal{V}=\\times_{i\\in[N]}V for some V⊆ℝ𝑉ℝV\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}. For some distribution F∈Δ​(V)𝐹Δ𝑉F\\in\\Delta(V), the prior distribution over buyers’ valuations is the product distribution FN∈Δ​(VN)superscript𝐹𝑁Δsuperscript𝑉𝑁F^{N}\\in\\Delta(V^{N}). The set of allowed bids is B⊆ℝ𝐵ℝB\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}, and the set of vectors of actions of players are vectors of their bids ℬℬ\\mathcal{B}. Moreover, we denote the set of pure bidding profiles, Λ≡ℬ𝒱Λsuperscriptℬ𝒱\\Lambda\\equiv\\mathcal{B}^{\\mathcal{V}}. The allocation rule x:ℬ→Δ​([N]):𝑥→ℬΔdelimited-[]𝑁x:\\mathcal{B}\\rightarrow\\Delta([N]) and the payment rule p:ℬ→ℝN:𝑝→ℬsuperscriptℝ𝑁p:\\mathcal{B}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{N} specify respectively the probability a buyer wins an item and their expected payment. Then, given valuations v∈𝒱𝑣𝒱v\\in\\mathcal{V} and bids b∈ℬ𝑏ℬb\\in\\mathcal{B}, the utility of buyer i𝑖i is given\nui​(b|vi)=xi​(b)⋅vi−pi​(b).subscript𝑢𝑖conditional𝑏subscript𝑣𝑖⋅subscript𝑥𝑖𝑏subscript𝑣𝑖subscript𝑝𝑖𝑏u_{i}(b|v_{i})=x_{i}(b)\\cdot v_{i}-p_{i}(b). Thus all we need to determine for our auctions are the allocation and payment rules. We shall consider first-price and all-pay auctions. The continuous versions of the auctions we consider are extensively studied in the literature (cf. for example, ), so our exposition of their allocation and payment rules along with their canonical equilibria will be brief. These auctions award the item to the highest bidder; moreover, with continuous valuation and bid spaces, tie-breaking does not matter for the canonical equilibrium as they occur with probability zero. However, we remark that both  and  point to the importance of the choice of tie-breaking rule. In the continuous case,  show that allocation probability strictly decreasing upon a tie (“win-vs-tie-strict”) is a sufficient condition to rule out asymmetric mixed Bayes-Nash equilibria in the continuous auctions, when types are drawn from a distribution with continuous, bounded support. In turn,  illustrates that in a discretised auction setting, the choice of a tie-breaking rule has an effect on the number of equilibria and their functional form. In our setting, we shall break ties fairly for another reason: for the first-price auction, awarding an item to no player upon ties forms a symmetric equilibrium where every buyer maxb∈B⁡bsubscript𝑏𝐵𝑏\\max_{b\\in B}b, while awarding an item to all players upon a tie forms a Bayes-Nash equilibrium (and hence, a CCE) where every buyer bids 00. These equilibria can be ruled out via additional linear constraints, but we find such an approach to be unnatural. The allocation rules for the first-price and all-pay auctions are thus First-Price Auctions. In the first-price auction, the winning buyer makes a payment equal to their own bid. Thus the expected payment of a buyer, given bids b𝑏b, is pi​(b)=xi​(b)⋅bisubscript𝑝𝑖𝑏⋅subscript𝑥𝑖𝑏subscript𝑏𝑖p_{i}(b)=x_{i}(b)\\cdot b_{i}. The canonical symmetric equilibrium of the first-price auction is for a buyer with valuation visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} to bid the conditional expectation of the highest valuation v′superscript𝑣′v^{\\prime} amongst other buyers, conditional on v′≤visuperscript𝑣′subscript𝑣𝑖v^{\\prime}\\leq v_{i}, All-Pay Auctions. In an all-pay auction, every bidder makes a payment equal to their own bid, no matter whether they are allocated the item or not. Thus in this case, we have pi​(b)=bisubscript𝑝𝑖𝑏subscript𝑏𝑖p_{i}(b)=b_{i}. The canonical equilibrium of the all-pay auction scales the first-price auction bids with the cumulative distribution function of the first-order statistic of other buyers’ valuations, or We then refer to a continuous auction model as a single-item auction where V,B𝑉𝐵V,B are closed intervals in ℝ+subscriptℝ\\mathbb{R}_{+}, and F𝐹F is a distribution on V𝑉V with full support. For the purpose of facilitating discussion, we then formalise the notion of a parametrised discretisation of a continuous auction model. A family of discretisations parametrised by n∈ℕ𝑛ℕn\\in\\mathbb{N} is a sequence (Vn,Bn,Fn)n∈ℕsubscriptsubscript𝑉𝑛subscript𝐵𝑛subscript𝐹𝑛𝑛ℕ(V_{n},B_{n},F_{n})_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}} of valuation spaces Vn⊆Vsubscript𝑉𝑛𝑉V_{n}\\subseteq V, bidding spaces Bn⊆Bsubscript𝐵𝑛𝐵B_{n}\\subseteq B and prior distributions Fnsubscript𝐹𝑛F_{n} over Vnsubscript𝑉𝑛V_{n} which determine a sequence of auction games such that Fn→F→subscript𝐹𝑛𝐹F_{n}\\rightarrow F in probability, and We remark that the set of CCE of single-item auctions need not equal the set of its Nash equilibria, even in the setting with complete information. For instance, in [ref]14 it is shown that the complete information first-price auction with two buyers, when each buyer has value 111, there is a CCE where each buyer’s bidding strategy follows the distribution S𝑆S on [0,1−1/e]011𝑒[0,1-1/e] given by the c.d.f. S​(b)=e−1/(1−b)𝑆𝑏superscript𝑒11𝑏S(b)=e^{-1}/(1-b). This is a BCCE, whereas the unique Nash equilibrium of the auction has both buyers bidding 111 with a probability 111. We will see, however, that in the case of discretised auctions with a suitably concave prior F𝐹F, the BCCE tends to be close to the unique Bayes-Nash equilibrium of the auction. On the other hand, the negative result of [ref]14 will provide a counterexample that shows that some regularity assumption on the priors is necessary.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: F in probability, and We remark that the set of CCE of single-item auctions need not equal the set of its Nash equilibria, even in the setting with complete information. For instance, in [ref]14 it is shown that the complete information first-price auction with two buyers, when each buyer has value 111, there is a CCE where each buyer’s bidding strategy follows the distribution S𝑆S\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
