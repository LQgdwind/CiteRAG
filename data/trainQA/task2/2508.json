      "content": "Paper Title: MOHAQ: Multi-Objective Hardware-Aware Quantization of Recurrent Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRealizing Deep Learning (DL) models on embedded platforms has become vital to bring intelligence to edge devices found in homes, cars, and wearable devices. However, DL models’ appetite for memory and computational power is in direct conflict with the limited resources of embedded platforms. This conflict led to research that combines methods to shrink the models’ compute and memory requirements without affecting their accuracy [ref]1. Models can be compressed by pruning neural network [ref]2, quantizing the weights and activations  , and many other methods [ref]1. The effect of the model’s compression can be improved by involving the target platform hardware model guidance. Different Neural Network (NN) layers have different effects on energy savings, latency improvement, and accuracy degradation [ref]5. Selecting optimization parameters like pruning ratio or precision for different layers can maximize accuracy and hardware performance. Such methods are called hardware-aware optimizations. These optimization methods result in a specific solution that depends on a particular model, hardware platform, and accuracy constraint. Changes in the hardware platform or the application constraints would make this solution no more optimal. Thus, the automation of the NN compression is needed to adapt to changes in the platform and the constraints. The compression of the NN model to run on embedded platforms can be considered an optimization problem. Some prior work on pruning and quantization has considered optimization algorithms to select pruning/quantization parameters.\nSome researchers have tried to maximize the accuracy while considering platform-related metrics such as latency or memory-size as\nconstraints   .\nIn contrast, another group of researchers considered accuracy as the constraint and selected a platform performance metric as the main objective [ref]5. In this work, we treat the optimization problem as a Multi-Objective Optimization Problem (MOOP), where both the accuracy and hardware efficiency are considered objectives. First, it is non-trivial to decide whether accuracy or performance is the objective of the optimization. Thus, considering the problem as multi-objective is more appropriate. Also, MOOP has some advantages over single-objective optimization, such as giving a set of solutions that meet the objectives in different ways . By doing so, the embedded system designer can do the trade-off between different alternative solutions. The role of the optimization algorithm is only to generate the most efficient solutions and not to select one solution. However, applying multi-objective search to select NN models compression configurations is not straightforward. Many compression methods require retraining to compensate for accuracy loss, and that cannot be done during evaluating candidate solutions in a large search space. That is why in most of the recent work, the compression parameters have been selected during training and end with one solution. To make the multi-objective search possible, we rely on two aspects. First, we use post-training quantization as a compression method. Post-training quantization has become a more and more reliable compression method\nrecently   . Thus, the evaluation of one candidate solution would require only to run the inference of the NN model. Second, we cannot guarantee that post-training will provide high-accuracy solutions under all constraints scenarios. Thus, we propose a novel method called ”beacon-based search” to support the inference-only search with retraining. In beacon-based search, only a few solutions are selected for retraining (beacons), and they are used to guide other possible solutions without retraining all of them. This article applies the proposed Multi-Objective Hardware-Aware Quantization (MOHAQ) method to a recurrent neural network model used for speech recognition. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are NNs that are designed to deal with sequential data inputs or outputs applications  [ref]1. RNNs recognize the temporal relationship between input/output sequences by adding feedback to Feed-Forward (FF) neural networks. The model used in the experiments uses Simple Recurrent Units (SRU) instead of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) due to its ability to be parallelized over multiple time steps and being faster in training and inference . We selected speech recognition as an important RNN application and the TIMIT dataset due to its popularity in speech recognition research. Also, we find good software support for speech recognition using TIMIT dataset by the Pytorch-kaldi project . To prove the flexibility of the method to support different applications and hardware platforms, we applied our methods to two hardware architectures with varying constraints. The first is SiLago architecture , and the second is Bitfusion architecture . These two architectures are chosen as they support the varying precision required in our experiments. The contributions of this work are summarized as: We enable the fast evaluation of candidate solutions for multi-objective optimization for bit-width selection for NN layers by using post-training quantization. We show how to take account for combined objectives like the model error and hardware efficiency. We propose a method called beacon-based search to predict the retraining effect on candidate solutions without retraining all the evaluated solutions. We demonstrated the flexibility of the proposed method by applying it to two hardware architectures, SiLago and Bitfusion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work analyzing the quantization effect on SRU units. Considering SRU as an optimized version of the LSTM, it has not been investigated before if low precision quantization can be applied to SRU.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: conflict with the limited resources of embedded platforms.
