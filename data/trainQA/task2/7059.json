      "content": "Paper Title: Learning unitaries with quantum statistical queries\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA quantum Boolean function A𝐴A is defined as a Hermitian unitary operator [ref]3, i.e. an operator satisfying Notably, Pauli strings P∈𝒫n𝑃subscript𝒫𝑛P\\in\\mathcal{P}_{n} are Quantum Boolean and the unitary evolution (in the Heisenberg picture) of a Quantum Boolean function A𝐴A is also Quantum Boolean. This can be easily checked by replacing A𝐴A with U†​A​Usuperscript𝑈†𝐴𝑈U^{\\dagger}AU into the above equation.\nA key property of quantum Boolean functions is that their Fourier coefficients are all real, i.e. We will now demonstrate that the quantum Goldreich-Levin (GL) algorithm ([ref]3, Theorem 26) can be implemented via quantum statistical queries. Whereas the original algorithm requires oracles queries to the target unitary U𝑈U and its adjoint, we show that the weaker access to 𝖰𝖲𝗍𝖺𝗍Usubscript𝖰𝖲𝗍𝖺𝗍𝑈\\mathsf{QStat}_{U} suffices.\nA similar result was also established for uniform quantum examples ([ref]10, Theorem 4.4), which are quantum encodings of classical Boolean functions.\nWhile we will employ Theorem 3.4 for learning quantum Boolean functions, we remark that it does not require the target operator to be Hermitian and it could find broader applications for learning other classes of unitaries. Let A∈𝒰n𝐴subscript𝒰𝑛A\\in\\mathcal{U}_{n} be a unitary operator and 𝖰𝖲𝗍𝖺𝗍Asubscript𝖰𝖲𝗍𝖺𝗍𝐴\\mathsf{QStat}_{A} be the quantum statistical query oracle associated to the Choi state |v​(A)⟩ket𝑣𝐴\\ket{v(A)}. There is a poly​(n,1/γ)poly𝑛1𝛾\\mathrm{poly}(n,1/\\gamma)-time algorithm that accesses A𝐴A via queries to 𝖰𝖲𝗍𝖺𝗍Asubscript𝖰𝖲𝗍𝖺𝗍𝐴\\mathsf{QStat}_{A} with tolerance at least γ2/4superscript𝛾24\\gamma^{2}/4 and outputs a list L={P(1),P(2),…,P(m)}⊆𝒫n𝐿superscript𝑃1superscript𝑃2…superscript𝑃𝑚subscript𝒫𝑛L=\\{P^{(1)},P^{(2)},\\dots,P^{(m)}\\}\\subseteq\\mathcal{P}_{n} such that: if |A^P|≥γsubscript^𝐴𝑃𝛾|\\widehat{A}_{P}|\\geq\\gamma, then P∈L𝑃𝐿P\\in L; and for all P∈L𝑃𝐿P\\in L, |A^P|≥γ/2subscript^𝐴𝑃𝛾2|\\widehat{A}_{P}|\\geq\\gamma/2. Our algorithm closely follows the one proposed in [ref]3. The only difference is that, for each subset T⊆{0,1,2,3}n𝑇superscript0123𝑛T\\subseteq\\{0,1,2,3\\}^{n}, the oracle queries to A𝐴A and A†superscript𝐴†A^{\\dagger} are replaced by a 𝖰𝗌𝗍𝖺𝗍Asubscript𝖰𝗌𝗍𝖺𝗍𝐴\\mathsf{Qstat}_{A} query that outputs a (γ2/4)superscript𝛾24(\\gamma^{2}/4)-estimate of ∑P∈T|A^P|2subscript𝑃𝑇superscriptsubscript^𝐴𝑃2\\sum_{P\\in T}|\\widehat{A}_{P}|^{2}, as in Lemma 3.1.\nThe remaining part of the quantum Goldreich-Levin algorithm does not involve oracle access to A𝐴A or A†superscript𝐴†A^{\\dagger}, thus the rest of the proof coincides with the one of Theorem 26 in [ref]3.\n∎ The GL algorithm returns a list of “heavy-weight” Fourier coefficients. If A𝐴A is a quantum Boolean function, we can easily recover the values of those coefficients, up to a global sign. We prove this result in the following lemma. Let A=∑PA^P​P𝐴subscript𝑃subscript^𝐴𝑃𝑃A=\\sum_{P}\\widehat{A}_{P}P a quantum Boolean function and let L⊆𝒫n𝐿subscript𝒫𝑛L\\subseteq\\mathcal{P}_{n} a list of Pauli strings. Assume that |A^P|>τ/2subscript^𝐴𝑃𝜏2|\\widehat{A}_{P}|>\\tau/2 for all P𝑃P. There is a procedure running in time O​(|L|)𝑂𝐿O(|L|) that accesses the state |v​(A)⟩ket𝑣𝐴\\ket{v(A)} via 𝖰𝖲𝗍𝖺𝗍Asubscript𝖰𝖲𝗍𝖺𝗍𝐴\\mathsf{QStat}_{A} queries with tolerance at least τ2superscript𝜏2\\tau^{2} and outputs some estimates {B^P|P∈L}conditional-setsubscript^𝐵𝑃𝑃𝐿\\left\\{\\widehat{B}_{P}\\big{|}P\\in L\\right\\} such that for all P∈L𝑃𝐿P\\in L, B^P=±A^P±τsubscript^𝐵𝑃plus-or-minusplus-or-minussubscript^𝐴𝑃𝜏\\widehat{B}_{P}=\\pm\\widehat{A}_{P}\\pm\\tau for all P,Q∈L𝑃𝑄𝐿P,Q\\in L, 𝗌𝗀𝗇​(B^P​B^Q)=𝗌𝗀𝗇​(A^P​A^Q)𝗌𝗀𝗇subscript^𝐵𝑃subscript^𝐵𝑄𝗌𝗀𝗇subscript^𝐴𝑃subscript^𝐴𝑄\\mathsf{sgn}\\left(\\widehat{B}_{P}\\widehat{B}_{Q}\\right)=\\mathsf{sgn}\\left(\\widehat{A}_{P}\\widehat{A}_{Q}\\right), where 𝗌𝗀𝗇​(⋅)𝗌𝗀𝗇⋅\\mathsf{sgn}(\\cdot) is that function that on input x∈ℝ𝑥ℝx\\in\\mathbb{R} returns the sign of x𝑥x. By Lemma 3.1, we can estimate the values of A^P2superscriptsubscript^𝐴𝑃2\\widehat{A}_{P}^{2} up to error τ2superscript𝜏2\\tau^{2} via a 𝖰𝖲𝗍𝖺𝗍𝖰𝖲𝗍𝖺𝗍\\mathsf{QStat} query with tolerance τ2superscript𝜏2\\tau^{2}. Let B^P2superscriptsubscript^𝐵𝑃2\\widehat{B}_{P}^{2} be such estimates. Then we have that which proves the first part of the lemma. It remains to estimate the signs of the coefficients, up to a global sign. Let P∗=arg⁡max⁡B^P∗2superscript𝑃superscriptsubscript^𝐵superscript𝑃2P^{*}=\\arg\\max\\widehat{B}_{P^{*}}^{2}, that is the largest estimated squared coefficient. We arbitrarily assign the positive sign to this coefficient, i.e. we let\nB^P∗=B^P∗2subscript^𝐵superscript𝑃superscriptsubscript^𝐵superscript𝑃2\\widehat{B}_{P^{*}}=\\sqrt{\\widehat{B}_{P^{*}}^{2}}.\nFor each other coefficient P≠P∗𝑃superscript𝑃P\\neq P^{*},we assign the sign with the following procedure. We first define the following observables M+superscript𝑀M^{+} and M−superscript𝑀M^{-}, We now compute the expected values of M+superscript𝑀M^{+} with respect to |v​(A)⟩ket𝑣𝐴\\ket{v(A)}: and, similarly, for M−superscript𝑀M^{-}, So if A^P∗subscript^𝐴superscript𝑃\\widehat{A}_{P^{*}} and A^Psubscript^𝐴𝑃\\widehat{A}_{P} have the same sign, μ+>μ−superscript𝜇superscript𝜇\\mu^{+}>\\mu^{-} and vice-versa. Moreover, |μ+−μ−|=4​|A^P​A^P∗|>τ2superscript𝜇superscript𝜇4subscript^𝐴𝑃subscript^𝐴superscript𝑃superscript𝜏2|\\mu^{+}-\\mu^{-}|=4\\left|\\widehat{A}_{P}\\widehat{A}_{P^{*}}\\right|>\\tau^{2}. Then we can tell whether μ+>μ−superscript𝜇superscript𝜇\\mu^{+}>\\mu^{-} by querying the oracle 𝖰𝖲𝗍𝖺𝗍Asubscript𝖰𝖲𝗍𝖺𝗍𝐴\\mathsf{QStat}_{A} with the observable M+−M−superscript𝑀superscript𝑀M^{+}-M^{-} and tolerance τ2superscript𝜏2\\tau^{2}. If the output is positive, then we can conclude that μ+>μ−superscript𝜇superscript𝜇\\mu^{+}>\\mu^{-} and assign B^Psubscript^𝐵𝑃\\widehat{B}_{P} positive sign, and vice-versa if the output is negative.\nThis proves the second part of the theorem. ∎ We can now finally provide a QSQ algorithm for learning quantum Boolean functions. We closely follow the proof of (, Proposition 6.7), which provide an analogous learning algorithm for quantum Boolean functions under oracle query access. Let A𝐴A be a quantum Boolean function. There is a poly​(n,2k)poly𝑛superscript2𝑘\\mathrm{poly}(n,2^{k})-time algorithm that accesses the state |v​(A)⟩ket𝑣𝐴\\ket{v(A)} via 𝖰𝖲𝗍𝖺𝗍Asubscript𝖰𝖲𝗍𝖺𝗍𝐴\\mathsf{QStat}_{A} queries with tolerance at least Ω​(4−k)Ωsuperscript4𝑘\\Omega(4^{-k}) and outputs a quantum Boolean function A′superscript𝐴′A^{\\prime} such that min⁡{‖A−A′‖2,‖A+A′‖2}≤εsubscriptnorm𝐴superscript𝐴′2subscriptnorm𝐴superscript𝐴′2𝜀\\min\\{\\|A-A^{\\prime}\\|_{2},\\|A+A^{\\prime}\\|_{2}\\}\\leq\\varepsilon, where We can adapt the proof of Proposition 6.7 in  to the QSQ setting by replacing all the oracle access queries to A𝐴A with queries to QStatAsubscriptQStat𝐴\\textsf{QStat}_{A}. In particular, this involves the implementation of the GL algorithm with the parameter γ=Θ​(ε​2−k)𝛾Θ𝜀superscript2𝑘\\gamma=\\Theta(\\varepsilon 2^{-k}). This can be done in time poly​(n,2k,ε−1)poly𝑛superscript2𝑘superscript𝜀1\\mathrm{poly}(n,2^{k},\\varepsilon^{-1}) via quantum statistical queries with tolerance Θ​(ε2​4−k)Θsuperscript𝜀2superscript4𝑘\\Theta(\\varepsilon^{2}4^{-k}) by Theorem 3.4.\nMoreover, we need to evaluate O​(4k)𝑂superscript4𝑘O(4^{k}) Fourier coefficients with accuracy ε​4−k𝜀superscript4𝑘\\varepsilon 4^{-k}. By Lemma 3.3, this can be done, up to a global sign, in time O​(4k)𝑂superscript4𝑘O(4^{k}) with quantum statistical queries queries with tolerance O​(ε2​4−k)𝑂superscript𝜀2superscript4𝑘O(\\varepsilon^{2}4^{-k}).\nThe remaining part of the proof doesn’t involve oracle access queries, and then is identical to the one of (, Proposition 6.7).\n∎ Theorem 3.5 allows us to learn a quantum Boolean function in Hilbert-Schimdt distance, up to a global sign. In other terms, given a target observable A𝐴A, we can estimate B𝐵B such that either B𝐵B or −B𝐵-B is close to A in Hilbert-Schmidt distance. This enables the prediction of the norm of the expected value for an arbitrary state. This follows by an application of Holder’s inequality. If instead we are interested to the unitary evolution performed by A𝐴A on a random state, we can observe that: where the first inequality is proven in (Lemma 14, ).\nMoreover, the accuracy guarantees of Theorem 3.5 are cast in terms of Inf1⁡(A),Inf2⁡(A)superscriptInf1𝐴superscriptInf2𝐴\\operatorname{Inf}^{1}(A),\\operatorname{Inf}^{2}(A). These parameters can be bounded for an observable evolved by a shallow circuit (in the Heisenberg picture), by using a variant of the light-cone argument, as done in (, Section 6.1). We now introduce some further notation to state their claim. For any j∈[n]𝑗delimited-[]𝑛j\\in[n], let Nj⊆[m]subscript𝑁𝑗delimited-[]𝑚N_{j}\\subseteq[m] be the minimal set of qubits such that Trj2​(U​TrNj2|Nj|​(O)​U†)=(U​TrNj2|Nj|​(O)​U†)subscriptTr𝑗2𝑈subscriptTrsubscript𝑁𝑗superscript2subscript𝑁𝑗𝑂superscript𝑈†𝑈subscriptTrsubscript𝑁𝑗superscript2subscript𝑁𝑗𝑂superscript𝑈†\\frac{\\mathrm{Tr}_{j}}{2}\\left(U\\frac{\\mathrm{Tr}_{N_{j}}}{2^{|N_{j}|}}(O)U^{\\dagger}\\right)=\\left(U\\frac{\\mathrm{Tr}_{N_{j}}}{2^{|N_{j}|}}(O)U^{\\dagger}\\right) for any O∈ℒn𝑂subscriptℒ𝑛O\\in\\mathcal{L}_{n} and denote L:=maxi⁡|{j:i∈Nj}|assign𝐿subscript𝑖conditional-set𝑗𝑖subscript𝑁𝑗L:=\\max_{i}|\\{j:i\\in N_{j}\\}|. Then, if O𝑂O is a quantum Boolean function with Inf1⁡(O),Inf2⁡(O),‖O‖2=𝒪​(1)superscriptInf1𝑂superscriptInf2𝑂subscriptnorm𝑂2𝒪1\\operatorname{Inf}^{1}(O),\\operatorname{Inf}^{2}(O),\\|O\\|_{2}=\\mathcal{O}(1), and U𝑈U is a unitary with L=𝒪​(1)𝐿𝒪1L=\\mathcal{O}(1), we can learn evolution in the Heisenberg picture U†​O​Usuperscript𝑈†𝑂𝑈U^{\\dagger}OU by means of Theorem 3.5 by picking k=𝒪​(1)𝑘𝒪1k=\\mathcal{O}(1). This ensures that the algorithm runs in poly​(n)poly𝑛\\mathrm{poly}(n) time and that the statistical queries have constant tolerance.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: A quantum Boolean function A𝐴A is defined as a Hermitian unitary operator [ref]3, i.e. an operator satisfying Notably, Pauli strings P∈𝒫n𝑃subscript𝒫𝑛P\\in\\mathcal{P}_{n} are Quantum Boolean and the unitary evolution (in the Heisenberg picture) of a Quantum Boolean function\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
