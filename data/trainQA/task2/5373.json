      "content": "Paper Title: A Simple Recipe for Competitive Low-compute Self supervised Vision Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMultiple works, such as CompRess , SEED 3, BINGO , DisCo 4 or SimReg [ref]30, have noticed that joint-embedding self-supervised learning methods such as SwAV , MoCo   or DINO  suffer from a drop in performance when applied on low compute neural nets. These works have proposed to use Knowledge Distillation  to circumvent those difficulties. CompRess  and SEED 3 use a memory queue like MoCo  to distill the knowledge of the teacher by minimizing the cross-entropy between the probability distribution of the teacher and student obtained by comparing a sample to each point in the queue. DisCo 4 and BINGO  makes use of contrastive learning, with BINGO additionally grouping samples into cluster of related samples. Finally, SimReg [ref]30 proposes regression as a generic way to transfer feature representation from a teacher to a student. Another recent line of work   has started to explore the reasons behind the performance drop on low compute architectures, with the workÂ  addressing some of the gap without the recourse to knowledge distillation. In this work, we will introduce a self-supervised distillation method and show it outperforms those previous approaches for training low-compute networks. Additionally, we will demonstrate that our approach is competitive with supervised training and supervised distillation.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: Multiple works, such as CompRess , SEED 3, BINGO , DisCo 4 or SimReg [ref]30, have noticed that joint-embedding self-supervised learning methods such as SwAV , MoCo   or DINO  suffer from a drop in performance when applied on low compute neural nets.
