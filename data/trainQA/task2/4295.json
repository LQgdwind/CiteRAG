      "content": "Paper Title: Implementing Reinforcement Learning Datacenter Congestion Control in NVIDIA NICs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMachine learning (ML) has been successfully applied in numerous disciplines, from healthcare to autonomous driving. Compared with manual tuning methods, ML algorithms can extract complex patterns from vast amounts of data and learn implicit correlations that enable better generalization and performance. Previous work considered ML-based solutions for networking problems . However, these algorithms require a lot of memory and are computationally demanding. Generally, for CC algorithms to operate successfully, their decision time must be ùí™‚Å°(RTT)ùí™RTT\\operatorname{\\mathcal{O}}(\\text{RTT}). For modern datacenters that use RDMA, this is on the order of 111 to 2‚ÄãŒº‚Äãs‚Äãe‚Äãc2ùúáùë†ùëíùëê2\\mu sec. These limitations partially explain why there are currently no learning-based CC algorithms in production. Dong et¬†al. [ref]20 described PCC Vivace, an algorithm that performs online optimization over a utility function. As an online algorithm, its training and inference stages are interleaved when deployed. PCC Vivace runs gradient ascent, which is too computationally demanding for current NIC hardware. Their work was then expanded by Jay et¬†al. , which introduced Aurora, a CC framework based on deep RL. Aurora is designed for a single flow only; hence, it can only be applied to toy domains. Jin et¬†al.  proposed two RL CC algorithms, one based on Q-learning  and the other on SARSA . Unfortunately, Jin et¬†al.  assume that the agent has joint access to all flows, which is not feasible in many networks, including those we study here. Lan et¬†al.  developed an RL CC algorithm for Named Data Networking ‚Äì conceptual future networks that assume the agent has knowledge of the flow origin application. Mai et¬†al.  applied an RL algorithm called DDPG , to learn CC strategies in multipath TCP used in satellite networks. Recently, Tessler et¬†al.  introduced an RL-based RDMA CC algorithm called RL-CC. It is the first and only AI algorithm to successfully tackle multi-flow traffic scenarios relying only on RTT measurements. It thus fits most networks that exist today, and we choose to build upon it in this work. In several network simulation benchmarks, RL-CC outperformed SOTA rule-based CC algorithms: DCQCN, SWIFT, and HPCC. One key feature of RLCC is MIMD rate modulation as a function of historic observed congestion. Another reason for the success of RL-CC is its carefully designed reward function, which at its optimum embodies an optimal flow equilibrium. In line with our summary above, Tessler et¬†al.  state that they would require dedicated hardware to accommodate the computational burden of deep learning inference. In this work, we build on RL-CC. First, we analyze the parameters that affect the reward function. Then, we tackle the computational burden. Specifically, we show that due to the slow inference of NN architectures on the ConnectX-6Dx devices, RL-CC fails to operate successfully. We solve this issue with distillation techniques, mapping the learned policy to a lighter architecture of decision trees. Finally, we perform an extensive analysis of RL-CC evaluating it on large-scale tests on real hardware devices.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: that use RDMA, this is on the order of 111 to 2‚ÄãŒº‚Äãs‚Äãe‚Äãc2ùúáùë†ùëíùëê2\\mu sec.
