Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

In addition to the online DAC scheme, we compare the proposed offline DAC scheme with the three baselines as well, namely, the A2C scheme , the Random scheme and the CQL scheme .\nImplementing the Random scheme, the SN applies a uniform probability distribution over the sampling and RS selection actions across the time horizon.\nAll datasets in experiments are generated from both the A2C and the Random schemes, and are categorized into the respective Expert Data and Random Data.\nFor each dataset, we collect |ùíü|=2‚ãÖ105ùíü‚ãÖ2superscript105|\\mathcal{D}|=2\\cdot 10^{5} interaction experience tuples.\nThe size of each mini-batch is set to be O=5‚ãÖ103ùëÇ‚ãÖ5superscript103O=5\\cdot 10^{3} during the training of our proposed offline DAC scheme.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: We set up an IRS-aided cooperative relay communication system with K=5ùêæ5K=5 RSs, which is similar to the scenario in [ref]1.\nIn the system, the IRS is deployed to have line-of-sight channels to the SN/RSs/destination.\nMoreover, there are non-line-of-sight channels between the SN and the RSs as well as between the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
