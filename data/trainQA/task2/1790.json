Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

These massive digital audiences are increasingly being studied to better understand how socio-cognitive interactions create   , manipulate  [ref]5 and promote   specific perceptions about the online- and real worlds. On a more descriptive level, social media represent de-localised information systems where individual users share their own experiences and perceptions through language . In this way, identifying cognitive features  of the language used on social media provides insight into how large audiences perceived and coped with specific events 0 . The present work used quantitative analyses to examine the language used on social media, in particular its emotional spectrum 1 and semantic content 2, to reconstruct popular perceptions about one specific event: the announcement of mass production of COVID-19 vaccines at the end of 2020. Taking inspiration from other recent works using social media as data for monitoring current perceptions and emotional responses to the coronavirus pandemic 3 4 5 6, we here adopt the recent framework of cognitive network science 7 8 in order to reconstruct the conceptual and emotional associations addressing COVID-19 vaccines. We focus our attention on popular messages on Twitter, with popularity being identified by the platform itself and corresponding to relatively high statistics of content sharing and liking. Our reconstruction of the key semantic frames reported in popular social media tweets represents a way to assess the online perceptions that reach massive audiences liked by up to 495,000 users (the population of a medium-sized city in the UK). Extracting and understanding these stances towards the COVID-19 vaccine is crucial in terms of identifying potential signals of distress 9 0, e.g. social users highlighting key challenges or denouncing issues with vaccine distribution that could promptly be solved once fully identified, or negative attitudes of closure 1 2 3 0, e.g. conspiracy jargon that might hamper vaccination campaigns and have severe repercussions for pandemic containment. Building on the above necessity for quantitative investigations of socio-cognitive attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine, we provide more details about the cognitive aspects that characterise our approach and compare it against other data-driven works in the relevant literature 2 [ref]5 6 5 4.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: Social media have given voice to millions of individuals.
