We aim to improve the ROA of the initial controller, used to collect data, by replacing it with an MPC solving the following input-limited, state soft-constrained, optimal control problem: where x^​(i)^𝑥𝑖\\hat{x}(i) and u^​(i)^𝑢𝑖\\hat{u}(i) are the predicted state and the input at i𝑖i-steps in the future, s​(i)𝑠𝑖{s}(i) are slack variables, u¯={u​(i)}_​i=0N−1¯𝑢subscript𝑢𝑖_𝑖superscript0𝑁1\\underline{u}=\\{u(i)\\}_{\\_}{i=0}^{N-1}, the stage cost ℓℓ\\ell is given by (3), γ∈(0,1]𝛾01\\gamma\\in(0,1] is a discount factor,\nthe function V𝑉V is\nthe Lyapunov NN from (9), scaled by a factor α≥1𝛼1\\alpha\\geq 1 to provide stability, and x​(t)𝑥𝑡x(t) is the measured system state at the current time. The penalty ℓ_​𝕏subscriptℓ_𝕏\\ell_{\\_}\\mathbb{X} is used for state constraint violation, see . The optimal cost is denoted as J_​MPC⋆​(x​(t))subscript𝐽_superscriptMPC⋆𝑥𝑡J_{\\_}{\\text{MPC}}^{\\star}(x(t)). Problem (III-B) is solved online given the current state x​(t)𝑥𝑡x(t); then, the first element of the optimal control sequence, u⋆​(0)superscript𝑢⋆0u^{\\star}(0), provides the action for the physical system. Then, a new state is measured, and (III-B) is again solved, in a receding horizon.\nThe implementation details are given in Appendix. We extend standard results from [ref]20  to the discounted case and to the λ𝜆\\lambda-contractive V𝑉V from (5). In order to prove them, we make use of the uniform continuity of the model, the SQP solution and the terminal cost, V𝑉V, as done by .\nConsider the candidate MPC ROA: The following are obtained for system (1) in closed loop with the MPC defined by problem (III-B). Results are stated for 𝕏_​T={0}subscript𝕏_𝑇0\\mathbb{X}_{\\_}T=\\{0\\}. For 𝕏_​T≠{0}subscript𝕏_𝑇0\\mathbb{X}_{\\_}T\\not=\\{0\\}, convergence would occur to a set instead of 00. We assume V𝑉V being formally verified . Stability and robustness\nAssume that V​(x)𝑉𝑥V(x) satisfies (5), with λ∈[0,1)𝜆01\\lambda\\in[0,1), 𝕏_​T={0}subscript𝕏_𝑇0\\mathbb{X}_{\\_}T=\\{0\\}. Then, given N≥1𝑁1N\\geq 1, for the MPC (III-B) there exist a constant α¯≥0¯𝛼0\\bar{\\alpha}\\geq 0, a discount factor γ¯∈(0,1]¯𝛾01\\bar{\\gamma}\\in(0,1], and a model error bound μ¯¯𝜇\\bar{\\mu} such that, if α≥α¯𝛼¯𝛼\\alpha\\geq\\bar{\\alpha}, μ≤μ¯𝜇¯𝜇\\mu\\leq\\bar{\\mu} and γ≥γ¯𝛾¯𝛾\\gamma\\geq\\bar{\\gamma}, then, ∀x​(0)∈𝒞​(𝕏_​s)for-all𝑥0𝒞subscript𝕏_𝑠\\forall x(0)\\in\\mathcal{C}(\\mathbb{X}_{\\_}s): If N=1𝑁1N=1, μ=0𝜇0\\mu=0, then the system is asymptotically stable for any γ>0𝛾0\\gamma>0, ∀x​(0)∈Υ_​N,γ,α⊇𝕏_​sformulae-sequencefor-all𝑥0subscriptΥ_𝑁𝛾subscript𝕏_𝑠𝛼\\forall x(0)\\in\\Upsilon_{\\_}{N,\\gamma,\\alpha}\\supseteq\\mathbb{X}_{\\_}s. If N>1𝑁1N>1, μ=0𝜇0\\mu=0, then the system reaches a set 𝔹_​γsubscript𝔹_𝛾\\mathbb{B}_{\\_}{\\gamma} that is included in 𝕏_​ssubscript𝕏_𝑠\\mathbb{X}_{\\_}s. This set increases with decreasing discount, γ𝛾\\gamma, ∀x​(0)∈Υ_​N,γ,αfor-all𝑥0subscriptΥ_𝑁𝛾𝛼\\forall x(0)\\in\\Upsilon_{\\_}{N,\\gamma,\\alpha}. γ=1⇒𝔹_​γ={0}𝛾1⇒subscript𝔹_𝛾0\\gamma=1\\Rightarrow\\mathbb{B}_{\\_}{\\gamma}=\\{0\\}. If α​V​(x)𝛼𝑉𝑥\\alpha V(x) is the optimal value function in 𝕏_​ssubscript𝕏_𝑠\\mathbb{X}_{\\_}s for the problem, μ=0𝜇0\\mu=0, and if 𝒞​(𝕏_​s)≠𝕏_​s𝒞subscript𝕏_𝑠subscript𝕏_𝑠\\mathcal{C}(\\mathbb{X}_{\\_}s)\\neq\\mathbb{X}_{\\_}s, then the system is asymptotically stable, ∀x​(0)∈Υ_​N,γ,α⊃𝕏_​sformulae-sequencefor-all𝑥0subscriptΥ_𝑁𝛾subscript𝕏_𝑠𝛼\\forall x(0)\\in\\Upsilon_{\\_}{N,\\gamma,\\alpha}\\supset\\mathbb{X}_{\\_}s. If μ=0𝜇0\\mu=0, then α≥α¯𝛼¯𝛼\\alpha\\geq\\bar{\\alpha} implies that α​V​(x)≥V⋆​(x),∀x∈𝕏_​sformulae-sequence𝛼𝑉𝑥superscript𝑉⋆𝑥for-all𝑥subscript𝕏_𝑠\\alpha V(x)\\geq V^{\\star}(x),\\forall x\\in\\mathbb{X}_{\\_}s, where V⋆superscript𝑉⋆V^{\\star} is the optimal value for the infinite horizon problem with cost (3) subject to (2). The MPC has a stability margin. If the MPC uses a surrogate model satisfying (8), with one-step error bound ‖w‖_​22<μ¯2=1−λL_​V​L_​f^​x2​N​l_​ssubscriptnorm𝑤_superscript22superscript¯𝜇21𝜆subscript𝐿_𝑉subscript𝐿_^𝑓superscript𝑥2𝑁subscript𝑙_𝑠\\|w\\|_{\\_}2^{2}<\\bar{\\mu}^{2}=\\frac{1-\\lambda}{L_{\\_}VL_{\\_}{\\hat{f}x}^{2N}}l_{\\_}s, then the system is Input-to-State (practically) Stable (ISpS) and there exists a set 𝔹_​N,γ,μ:x​(t)→𝔹_​N,γ,μ:subscript𝔹_𝑁𝛾𝜇→𝑥𝑡subscript𝔹_𝑁𝛾𝜇\\mathbb{B}_{\\_}{N,{\\gamma},{\\mu}}:\\ x(t)\\rightarrow\\mathbb{B}_{\\_}{N,{\\gamma},{\\mu}}, ∀x​(0)∈β​Υ_​N,γ,αfor-all𝑥0𝛽subscriptΥ_𝑁𝛾𝛼\\forall x(0)\\in\\beta\\Upsilon_{\\_}{N,\\gamma,\\alpha}, β≤1𝛽1\\beta\\leq 1. Theorem 2 states that for a given horizon N𝑁N and contraction λ𝜆\\lambda, one can find a minimum scaling of the Lyapunov function V𝑉V and a lower bound on the discount factor γ𝛾\\gamma such that the system under the MPC has ROA Υ_​N,γ,α⊇𝕏_​ssubscript𝕏_𝑠subscriptΥ_𝑁𝛾𝛼\\Upsilon_{\\_}{N,\\gamma,\\alpha}\\supseteq\\mathbb{X}_{\\_}s. If the model is not perfect, its error being less than μ≤μ¯𝜇¯𝜇\\mu\\leq\\bar{\\mu}, then the ROA size decreases but the system is still safe. In this case, a shorter horizon can be beneficial.\nThe proof of the theorem follows standard MPC arguments and is in Appendix. In order to further motivate for the search of a V𝑉V giving the largest 𝕏_​ssubscript𝕏_𝑠\\mathbb{X}_{\\_}s, notice that a larger 𝕏_​ssubscript𝕏_𝑠\\mathbb{X}_{\\_}s can allow for shortening the MPC horizon, possibly yielding the same ROA. Contrary to , we demonstrate how model mismatch and longer horizons can decrease performance with respect to an infinite-horizon oracle with same cost and perfect model. This links RL to arguments used in nominal MPC robustness  [ref]25.

Theorem 3 is related to  for value-based RL. However, here we do not constrain the system and model to be stable, nor assume the MPC optimal cost to be Lipschitz. Theorem 3 shows that a discount γ𝛾\\gamma or a shorter horizon N𝑁N can mitigate model errors. Since γ≪1much-less-than𝛾1\\gamma\\ll 1 can limit stability (Theorem 2) we opt for the shortest horizon, hence N=1𝑁1N=1, γ=1𝛾1\\gamma=1. Proof of Theorem 3 is in Appendix. The stability bounds discussed in Theorem 2 can be conservative and their computation is non-trivial. Theoretically, the bigger the α𝛼\\alpha the larger is the ROA (the safe region) for the MPC, up to its maximum extent. Practically, for a very high α𝛼\\alpha, the MPC solver may not converge due to ill-conditioning.\nInitially, by using the tool from [ref]27 within an SQP scheme, we tried to tune the parameters through gradient-based optimization of the loss (10). These attempts were not successful, as expected from the considerations in . Therefore, for practical reasons, in this work we perform a grid search over the MPC parameter α𝛼\\alpha. Note that the discount factor γ𝛾\\gamma is mainly introduced for Theorem 3 and analysed in Theorem 2 to allow for future combination of stable MPC with value iteration.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: action for the physical system.
