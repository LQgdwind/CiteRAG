Meriçli et al.  uses genetic programming to optimize the reward function for robot soccer.\nSorg et al. [ref]29 learns a reward function for planning via gradient ascent on the expected return of a tree search planning algorithm (e.g., Monte Carlo Tree Search). Guo et al. [ref]30 extends [ref]29 using deep learning, improving tree search performance in ATARI games. The work   learns a reward function to improve the performance of model-free RL algorithms by performing policy gradient updates on the reward function. Zheng et al.  takes a meta-learning approach to learn a reward function that improves an RL algorithm’s sample efficiency in unseen environments. Hu et al.  learns a weighting function that scales the given shaping rewards  at each state and action. These lines of work are complimentary to EIPO, which is agnostic to the choice of intrinsic reward and could be used in tandem with a learned reward function. The problem of balancing intrinsic and extrinsic rewards is related to multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL)    [ref]37 since both optimize a policy with the linear combination of two or multiple rewards. Chen et al.  learns a meta-policy that jointly optimizes all the objectives and adapts to each objective by fine-tuning the meta-policy. Ultes et al.  search for the desired weighting between dialog length and success rate in conversation AI system using Bayesian optimization. Abels et al. , Yang et al. [ref]37 make the policy conditional on the preference of each reward and train the policy using the weighted rewards. However, MORL approaches could not resolve the issue of intrinsic rewards bias in our problem setting since intrinsic rewards are non-stationary and change over the training time, yet MORL approaches require the reward functions to be fixed. Also, MORL is aimed at learning a Pareto-optimal policy that satisfies all the objectives, but intrinsic rewards are just auxiliary training signals, and thus, we do not require maximizing intrinsic rewards.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: Our work is related to the paradigm of reward design.
