      "content": "Paper Title: Application-aware Congestion Mitigation for High-Performance Computing Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nApplications running in HPC systems [ref]10 have diverse communication characteristics in terms of varying message sizes, interplay between communication primitives, and application logic.\nThose applications can be broadly categorized into delay sensitive and bandwidth intensive applications.\nDelay sensitive applications rely on low link buffer occupancy to achieve minimal network latency and low application runtime (i.e. increase in network latency increases application runtime significantly).\nExamples include MILC  and Quantum Espresso  .\nWe provide a definition and quantification of delay sensitivity in section IV-A.\nBandwidth intensive applications rely on large message sizes and collective communication primitives  that exhausts available network bandwidth.\nExamples include spectral codes  that use all-to-all traffic patterns.\nGPCNeT  is a benchmark that mimics such bandwidth intensive communication patterns (i.e., all-to-all and N-to-1) found in HPC applications.\nMoreover, there exists an entire spectrum of applications that can be found at varying levels of delay sensitivity and bandwidth intensity.\nThese applications contend with each other for limited network resources, and failure to efficiently multiplex network resources leads to runtime variability and suboptimal system utility.\nTo address those problems, we leverage the following insights to design an application-aware congestion mitigation framework. Insight 1: Runtime variability can be reduced by augmenting the CC mechanism with application delay sensitivity.\nCongestion signals used in rate control mechanisms such as ECN , QCN , and network delay   do not address the source of congestion directly.\nConsequently, during the operation of the CC mechanism, the non-congestion-contributing applications are penalized along with the culprit that is responsible for the congestion.\nMoreover, if the application that was not responsible for congestion is also delay sensitive, it’s performance degradation due to congestion mitigation can be severe.\nBecause of this incorrect penalization, use of CC has been disabled on Sierra and Summit  systems (ranked second and third among the “TOP500” supercomputers ).\nTo resolve the incorrect penalization problem, we created an application-aware rate control mechanism (described in section V) that penalizes applications based on their delay-sensitivity, and tested it on a Cray Aries  HPC system (16 switches and 54 nodes) against two different algorithms (Cray static rate control  and DCQCN ).\nOur test workload consists of a delay sensitive application (MILC, isolated runtime 26 sec) and a bandwidth intensive application (GPCNeT, isolated runtime 75 sec) that execute simultaneously.\nOverall (see Table I), we find that the application-aware mechanism ensures low runtime variability for both applications.\nOur application-aware rate control throttled (i.e., penalized) MILC traffic only 20% of what it throttled GPCNeT. Insight 2: Network performance counter222Network performance counters such as link stall times and traffic can be collected at switches via vendor-provided mechanisms. telemetry can be used to estimate application delay sensitivity.\nNetwork performance counters are widely collected on production systems  and can be used to characterize network behaviour. fig. 1(a) shows the runtime for MILC and GPCNeT under low (0.25% percent time stalled333Percent Time Stalled is a proxy for measuring congestion in credit-based flow control networks that we describe in section IV-B) and high (7.5% percent time stalled) congestion, as measured from network stall counters.\nThe figure shows that response to congestion in the system (that is captured through network counters) varies.\nFor instance, MILC has a 60% increase in runtime, while GPCNeT’s runtime marginally increases by 2.6% for the same difference in measured congestion.\nWe can leverage this variability in behavior as measured from network performance counters to enable estimation of delay sensitivity. Insight 3: HPC workloads enable efficient estimation of delay sensitivity.\nThere are several challenges associated with estimating delay sensitivity such as:\n\n\n(i) estimating delay sensitivity for a large number of applications, and\n\n(ii) variability in delay sensitivity across the application lifespan.\n\n\nWe characterize HPC workloads to show that these challenges do not manifest in (or negligibly impact) production systems and workloads.\nFirst, delay sensitivity needs to be characterized for only few applications.\nfig. 1(b) shows the cumulative distribution of node hours utilized by different applications running on three generations of NERSC systems [ref]10.\nWe observe that the top 10 applications comprise nearly 50% of the workload in these systems.\nSecond, our characterization of two of these applications reveals traffic stability; thereby, indicating low variability in delay sensitivity across the application lifespan.\nfig. 1(c) shows the variation in cumulative traffic injection in two common scientific applications: MILC  and LAMMPS .\nWe observed iterative communication behavior across the run for both applications.\nMoreover, such iterative behaviour has been demonstrated for multiple commonly used HPC applications   .\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: Applications running in HPC systems [ref]10 have diverse communication characteristics in terms of varying message sizes, interplay between communication primitives, and application logic.\nThose applications can be broadly categorized\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
