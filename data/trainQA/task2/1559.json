      "content": "Paper Title: GTAE: Graph-Transformer based Auto-Encoders for Linguistic-Constrained Text Style Transfer\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStyle transfer with non-parallel text corpus has attracted increasing research interests in recent years. [ref]10 used variational autoencoder (VAE) to generate sentences with controllable attributes by disentangling latent representations. [ref]12 further introduced adversarial training to learn style-irrelevant content embeddings. To relieve the simplistic Gaussian prior of latent embeddings in VAE [ref]15,  proposed a cross-aligned strategy to direcly match transferred text distributions with two adversarial discriminators, assuming a shared latent content distribution for both styles. As a pioneer work in text style transfer,  employs a reinforced model on non-parallel text data to present style transfer.  uses pseudo-parallel data and neural machine translation to achieve language style transfer.  proposed a dual agent reinforcement algorithm for text style transfer. Similarly,  incorporates a Gaussian kernel layer to finely control the sentiment intensity to present fine-grained sentiment transfer. IMaT constructs a pseudo-parallel data by aligning semantically similar sentences from pair-wise corpora to implement text attribute transfer.  presents a Style Transformer that employs an attention mechanism in Transformer to achieve content preservation and text style transfer.\n used a generator model to learn the latent priors instead, and minimized the Wasserstain distance between the latent embedding and the learned prior with an adversarial regularization loss.  replaced binary classifier discriminators with a target domain language model to stabilize training signals from transferred sentences. Our work differs from these antecedents by explicitly imposing linguistic constraints into the latent space for better content and logic preservation. It is worth noting that our proposed GTAE is highly extendable with above modeling strategies by simply replacing their encoder-decoder with our SGT-CGT modules. Another line of work resorts to back-translation methods that removes style attributes in the representation space of another language   . However, their methods still lack effective constraints on the latent space.  argues that text styles are often embodied in certain phrases and proposes a direct delete-and-retrieve approach. Though their method strictly preserve the linguistic structure, the computation load of retrival prohibits its practical use and the hard-manipulation strategy could suffer when style information cannot be simply disentangled from certain phrases. In comparison, GTAE provides a more flexible and computationally efficient solution that allows operations in the latent space and evolve the corresponding style-related parts. Recently  also investigates the incorporation of linguistic constraints into the modeling process. Their work lies on noun consistency for content preservation while ours resorts to dependency parse trees instead, which are complementary to each other.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: Style transfer with non-parallel text corpus has attracted increasing research interests in recent years.
