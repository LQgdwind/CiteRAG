      "content": "Paper Title: Tree Independence Number IV. Even-hole-free Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe now sketch the main ideas of the proof of Theorem 13.1: that for every Ktsubscript𝐾𝑡K_{t}-free graph every pair a𝑎a and b𝑏b of vertices can be separated by a set X𝑋X of size polynomial in t𝑡t and log⁡n𝑛\\log n. We start by sketching how we would have liked the proof to work, point to where this approach breaks, and then outline how the proof actually works. We wish to separate a𝑎a from b𝑏b. We will concentrate on the neighborhood N​(a)𝑁𝑎N(a) of a𝑎a. Let D𝐷D be the component of G−N​[a]𝐺𝑁delimited-[]𝑎G-N[a] that contains b𝑏b, we can safely ignore the vertices in N​(a)∖N​(D)𝑁𝑎𝑁𝐷N(a)\\setminus N(D) and focus on the vertices in N​(D)𝑁𝐷N(D). As long as N​(D)𝑁𝐷N(D) contains a clique that covers at least 0.1%percent0.10.1\\% of N​(D)𝑁𝐷N(D) we can add this clique to X𝑋X since we only can do this step O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) many times. After this step, “many” (i.e., at least 99%percent9999\\%) of vertex triples x1subscript𝑥1x_{1}, x2subscript𝑥2x_{2}, x3subscript𝑥3x_{3} in N​(a)∩N​(D)𝑁𝑎𝑁𝐷N(a)\\cap N(D) are stable (this follows from, e.g., [ref]17). For a stable triple x1,x2,x3subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2subscript𝑥3x_{1},x_{2},x_{3} let D′superscript𝐷′D^{\\prime} be an inclusion minimal connected subset of D𝐷D that contains neighbors of x1subscript𝑥1x_{1}, x2subscript𝑥2x_{2} and x3subscript𝑥3x_{3}, and let H={a,x1,x2,x3}∪D′𝐻𝑎subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2subscript𝑥3superscript𝐷′H=\\{a,x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}\\}\\cup D^{\\prime}. A simple case analysis shows that {a,x1,x2,x3}∪D′𝑎subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2subscript𝑥3superscript𝐷′\\{a,x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}\\}\\cup D^{\\prime} is either a pyramid or a wheel.\nWe show in Section 4 that if H𝐻H is a pyramid, then either there is a clique K𝐾K in D𝐷D that separates at least two vertices of {x1,x2,x3}subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2subscript𝑥3\\{x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}\\} from b𝑏b in ({x1,x2,x3}∪D)subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2subscript𝑥3𝐷(\\{x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}\\}\\cup D), or there is a clique K𝐾K in D𝐷D that has an “almost as good” separation effect (the precise formulation of this “almost as good” effect is cumbersome, and we skip it here). Additionally there are two exceptional cases for which we are not able to obtain this outcome: H𝐻H could grow to a loaded pyramid or an extended near-prism (see Section 4 for definitions). Suppose that at least 1%percent11\\% of the stable triples x1,x2,x3subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2subscript𝑥3x_{1},x_{2},x_{3} in N​(a)∩N​(D)𝑁𝑎𝑁𝐷N(a)\\cap N(D) there is a clique Kx1,x2,x3subscript𝐾subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2subscript𝑥3K_{x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}} that separates at least two of them from b𝑏b in ({x1,x2,x3}∪D)subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2subscript𝑥3𝐷(\\{x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}\\}\\cup D) (or does the morally equivalent job).\nOne of the main structural insights in this paper is that in this case we can conclude that there is a single set K𝐾K in D𝐷D such that κ​(K)𝜅𝐾\\kappa(K) is constant and no component of D−K𝐷𝐾D-K sees more than 99%percent9999\\% of N​(D)𝑁𝐷N(D).\nThis kind of local-to-global transition is usually very hard to force when one works with families of graphs defined by forbidden induced subgraphs. Our arguments here only rely on G𝐺G being C4subscript𝐶4C_{4}-free, so we expect for this technique to be applicable in other contexts in the future. Whenever we get a K𝐾K as above we win – we can just add it to our separator X𝑋X, and again we will only do this O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) many times before |N​(D)|𝑁𝐷|N(D)| drops to 00 and a𝑎a is separated from b𝑏b.\nA similar outcome can be derived using structural arguments from [ref]17 when H𝐻H is a pyramid that grows to an extended near-prism for a sufficiently large proportion of stable triples in N​(D)𝑁𝐷N(D). The problem with this approach is that it gets stuck whenever 99%percent9999\\% of the stable triples {x1,x2,x3}subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2subscript𝑥3\\{x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}\\} satisfy that H𝐻H is a wheel or grows to a loaded pyramid.\nWhen this problem occurs a large fraction of the vertices of N​(D)𝑁𝐷N(D) are hubs. We say that a vertex v𝑣v of G𝐺G is a hub if v𝑣v is the center of a proper wheel, or the “corner” of a loaded pyramid (again, see Section 4) and we denote by Hub⁡(G)Hub𝐺\\operatorname{Hub}(G) the set of all hubs of G𝐺G. We remark that our definition of hubs is not precisely the same as the definition of hubs in , although the role hubs play in  and here are similar.\nWhen none of the vertices in N​(a)𝑁𝑎N(a) (and therefore N​(D)𝑁𝐷N(D)) are hubs an argument quite similar to the one outlined above works, and we are able to obtain an a𝑎a-b𝑏b separator X𝑋X with polylogarithmic κ𝜅\\kappa. We call this the “hub-free” case. The remainder of the proof then consists of reducing the general case to the hub-free case. The reduction is based on the “central bag” method, developed in  and  and also used in .\nSince G𝐺G is C4subscript𝐶4C_{4}-free it follows that N​(a)∩N​(b)𝑁𝑎𝑁𝑏N(a)\\cap N(b) is a clique, and we may add N​(a)∩N​(b)𝑁𝑎𝑁𝑏N(a)\\cap N(b) to X𝑋X at the cost of increasing |X|𝑋|X| by t𝑡t (recall that G𝐺G is Ktsubscript𝐾𝑡K_{t}-free). From now on we assume that N​(a)∩N​(b)𝑁𝑎𝑁𝑏N(a)\\cap N(b) is empty. Since every even-hole-free graph has a vertex whose neighborhood is the union of two cliques, it follows that every induced subgraph of G𝐺G has average degree upper bounded by O​(t)𝑂𝑡O(t).\nThus, the set Hub⁡(G)Hub𝐺\\operatorname{Hub}(G) contains a stable set S1subscript𝑆1S_{1} of size at least Ω​(|Hub⁡(G)|t)ΩHub𝐺𝑡\\Omega(\\frac{|\\operatorname{Hub}(G)|}{t}) such that the degree of each vertex in S1subscript𝑆1S_{1} in G​[Hub⁡(G)]𝐺delimited-[]Hub𝐺G[\\operatorname{Hub}(G)] is at most O​(t)𝑂𝑡O(t).\nWe show that for every hub v𝑣v in a graph in 𝒞𝒞{\\cal C}, G−N​[v]𝐺𝑁delimited-[]𝑣G-N[v] is disconnected. When v𝑣v is a wheel center this was already known, for loaded pyramid corners we prove it in Section 6 (we skip this proof in the overview). For each v∈S1𝑣subscript𝑆1v\\in S_{1}, since v∉N​(a)∩N​(b)𝑣𝑁𝑎𝑁𝑏v\\notin N(a)\\cap N(b) there is a component Dvsubscript𝐷𝑣D_{v} of G∖N​[v]𝐺𝑁delimited-[]𝑣G\\setminus N[v] that contains at least one of {a,b}𝑎𝑏\\{a,b\\}.\nWe claim that N​[Dv]𝑁delimited-[]subscript𝐷𝑣N[D_{v}] must contain both {a,b}𝑎𝑏\\{a,b\\} or we are already done! Indeed, suppose N​[Dv]𝑁delimited-[]subscript𝐷𝑣N[D_{v}] contains b𝑏b but not a𝑎a. Then a set X𝑋X that separates v𝑣v from b𝑏b also separates a𝑎a from b𝑏b, but v𝑣v only has O​(t)𝑂𝑡O(t) hubs in its neighborhood. So adding these t𝑡t hubs to X𝑋X leaves us with the task of separating v𝑣v from b𝑏b, but now v𝑣v has no hubs in its neighborhood and we are in the hub-free case (and therefore done). Thus, if we are not done yet, then for every vertex v𝑣v in S1subscript𝑆1S_{1} there is a component Dvsubscript𝐷𝑣D_{v} such that {a,b}⊆N​[Dv]𝑎𝑏𝑁delimited-[]subscript𝐷𝑣\\{a,b\\}\\subseteq N[D_{v}]. We define the central bag to be β=∩v∈S1(N​[Dv]∪{v})𝛽subscript𝑣subscript𝑆1𝑁delimited-[]subscript𝐷𝑣𝑣\\beta=\\cap_{v\\in S_{1}}(N[D_{v}]\\cup\\{v\\}) (the actual definition of the central bag is subtly different). Observe that both a𝑎a and b𝑏b are in the central bag β𝛽\\beta. There are now two key observations behind the central bag method. The first (and easy) one is that no vertex v∈S1𝑣subscript𝑆1v\\in S_{1} can be a hub in β𝛽\\beta.\nIndeed v𝑣v cannot be a hub in N​[Dv]𝑁delimited-[]subscript𝐷𝑣N[D_{v}] since N​[Dv]−N​(v)=Dv𝑁delimited-[]subscript𝐷𝑣𝑁𝑣subscript𝐷𝑣N[D_{v}]-N(v)=D_{v} is connected, contradicting that the neighborhood of every hub is a separator. Since β⊆Dv𝛽subscript𝐷𝑣\\beta\\subseteq D_{v} it follows that v𝑣v cannot be a hub in β𝛽\\beta either. When the more nuanced definition is used, the proof is slightly more involved. This observation means that the number of hubs in β𝛽\\beta is smaller by a linear fraction than the number of hubs in G𝐺G. Thus, by induction on log⁡(|Hub⁡(G)|)Hub𝐺\\log(|\\operatorname{Hub}(G)|), we can find an a𝑎a-b𝑏b separator Y𝑌Y in the central bag β𝛽\\beta of polylogarithmic size. If we can grow Y𝑌Y to an a𝑎a-b𝑏b separator X𝑋X in G𝐺G incurring an additive polylogarithmic cost, then the induction goes through and we are able to upper bound the total size of X𝑋X by (log⁡n)O​(1)superscript𝑛𝑂1(\\log n)^{O(1)}. In particular the depth of the induction is logaritmic in n𝑛n, so if |X|𝑋|X| grows by an additive term of (log⁡n)O​(1)superscript𝑛𝑂1(\\log n)^{O(1)} in each inductive step this is ok, but if X𝑋X grows by a factor 1.011.011.01 in each step then |X|𝑋|X| ends up being polynomial in n𝑛n. The second (and more involved) component of the central bag method is to show that Y𝑌Y can indeed be grown to X𝑋X as prescribed above.\nThis incurs a cost which is proportional to (essentially) |Y∩S1|𝑌subscript𝑆1|Y\\cap S_{1}|, because for each vertex s𝑠s in |Y∩S1|𝑌subscript𝑆1|Y\\cap S_{1}| we add all of its O​(t)𝑂𝑡O(t) hub neighbors to X𝑋X and then separate s𝑠s from either a𝑎a or b𝑏b using the hub-free case. Unfortunately the inductive step which gives us Y𝑌Y does not give us any guarantees on the size of |Y∩S1|𝑌subscript𝑆1|Y\\cap S_{1}|, so in the worst case Y∩S1𝑌subscript𝑆1Y\\cap S_{1} could be almost as big as Y𝑌Y itself. Then the cost of turning Y𝑌Y into a separator X𝑋X in G𝐺G would incur at least a constant multiplicative cost, which would be too expensive. We therefore apply an additional “pivot” step where Y𝑌Y is changed so that |Y∩S1|𝑌subscript𝑆1|Y\\cap S_{1}| is small. This pivot step again relies on the hub-free case as well as a second application of the local-global transition mentioned above. This concludes the proof outline. We note that most of the results are proved for the slightly more general class of graphs 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}, rather than even-hole-free graphs. However, Section 7 deals with even-hole-free graphs only. It is very likely that the proofs there do in fact work\nin the more general setting, but we did not verify the details. Theorem 13.2 is another fact we need that has only been proved for even-hole-free graphs (and not for C4subscript𝐶4C_{4}-free odd-signable graphs); once again it is likely to generalize, but we have not checked it carefully. These are the two reasons for the fact that our main theorem applies to even-hole-free graphs only.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: this step, “many” (i.e., at least 99%percent9999\\%) of vertex triples x1subscript𝑥1x_{1}, x2subscript𝑥2x_{2}, x3subscript𝑥3x_{3} in N​(a)∩N​(D)𝑁𝑎𝑁𝐷N(a)\\cap N(D) are stable (this follows from, e.g., [ref]17).
