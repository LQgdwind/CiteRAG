      "content": "Paper Title: Exploiting Global and Local Attentions for Heavy Rain Removal on Single Images\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRain is a typical weather condition that affects the quality of images and videos, potentially degrading the performance of downstream tasks such as object tracking , object detection , and autonomous driving . There are several works for rain removal on single images. However, most of them can only remove light rain efficiently and show very poor results for the heavy rain cases. Heavy rain is a much more challenging task as it entangles heavy rain streaks and haze/fog. A few works have addressed such a heavy rain removal problem, but still with lots of room for improvement. Early rain removal methods applied hand-crafted priors 5 8    such as sparse learning. Even when these methods improved the overall scene, they often resulted in artifacts in the derained images, such as blur and color distortions. Recently, with the development of the deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN), learning-based methods  4 4 9 [ref]40  have shown dramatic improvements in deraining tasks with the help of large labeled datasets. However, these methods only achieve good results in the light rain removal task. For the heavy rain removal task, most approaches fail to restore the clean background scene. Recently, Li et al. 3 proposed a heavy rain model as: where J𝐽J is the observed (heavy rain) image, I𝐼I is the clean image, S𝑆S is the rain streak layers, T𝑇T is the transmission maps, and A𝐴A is the atmospheric light of the scene. ⊙direct-product\\odot denotes the element-wise multiplication. This model considers rain streaks S𝑆S and fog (T𝑇T and A𝐴A) but predicts S𝑆S, A𝐴A, and T𝑇T separately. In heavy rain, rain streaks and fog are mutually dependent by nature, making heavy rain removal a highly ill-posed problem. To tackle this issue, Li et al. 3 applied a generative adversarial network (GAN)  to refine the background clean images. However, the brightness and color contrasts were not completely corrected. In another work, Hu et al. [ref]11 considers the heavy rain scenes as a composition of a clean image I𝐼I, a rain layer R𝑅R, and a fog layer F𝐹F by formulating the heavy rain images J𝐽J as: Also, we re-arrange (2) for the clean image I𝐼I as: where 0≤R≤10𝑅10\\leq R\\leq 1 represents the rain layer, A𝐴A denotes an atmospheric light, and 0≤F≤10𝐹10\\leq F\\leq 1 denotes the fog layer. In [ref]11, to obtain the training pairs of clean and rainy images, rain layers R𝑅R and fog layers F𝐹F are computed by taking into account the scene depths. Hu et al. [ref]11 proposed a residual network to learn a low-resolution depth map and depth-guided additive residues for rain removal. But the clean image I𝐼I in (3) also have to be reconstructed based on the multiplicative residues term with J𝐽J, the first term in (3), which could not be obtained from Hu et al.’s residual network.\nIn contrast with the previous methods 3 [ref]11, that indirectly generate the clean image by estimating the components in (1) and (2), we directly generate the clean output image in our proposed method. In this paper, we propose to model the clean image I𝐼I as the combination of a roughly derained and defogged estimate I0subscript𝐼0I_{0}, an additive residue estimate I1subscript𝐼1I_{1} (given by by (J+RA)𝐽subscript𝑅𝐴(J+R_{A}), where RAsubscript𝑅𝐴R_{A} is the output of an additive sub-net), and a multiplicative residue estimate I2subscript𝐼2I_{2} (which is provided by (J⊙RM)direct-product𝐽subscript𝑅𝑀(J\\odot R_{M}), where RMsubscript𝑅𝑀R_{M} is the output of a multiplicative sub-net), as defined by: where W0subscript𝑊0W_{0}, W1subscript𝑊1W_{1} and W2subscript𝑊2W_{2} blend pixel-wise the image components of I𝐼I. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end network architecture for heavy-rain removal. Our network, called GLA-HRRNet, is integrated by three sub-nets that can effectively remove heavy rain: (i) In the first sub-net, we obtain global features from a U-net architecture where our proposed spatial channel attention (SCA) blocks are that incorporated, called the SCA sub-net; (ii) The second sub-net analyzes a heavy rain input into a clean image and additive residues with our proposed residual inception modules (RIM); (iii) The third sub-net employs the channel-attentive inception modules (CIM) to selectively learn the informative local features by separating the heavy rain scene into a clean image and multiplicative residues. Due to heavy rains’ complex characteristics, some of the background information in the three sub-net outputs is estimated with degraded quality. To remedy this, we employed an attentive blending block to aggregate the three sub-nets’ informative features into the final clean output image. Our main contributions in this paper are the following: Firstly, we introduce an end-to-end network that simultaneously exploits global and local attentions to effectively remove heavy rain from single images, called GLA-HRRNet, which is a very challenging and ill-posed task in image restoration. Secondly, we reinterpret the heavy rain model in terms of additive and multiplicative terms in our GLA-HRRNet, which effectively solves the heavy rain removal task without directly estimating the components in heavy rain scenes such as the atmospheric light, rain streaks, and transmission map. Our approach tackles the problem that there is no compatible formula to model heavy rain due to the entanglement of rain streaks and fog in natural scenes. Thirdly, we propose a spatial channel attention block that is effectively integrated into our Spatial Channel Attention (SCA) sub-net. Finally, we compare the proposed model with state-of-the-art (SOTA) deraining methods. Our method significantly outperforms the SOTA methods in both synthetic and real image datasets by a considerable margin.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: often resulted in artifacts in the derained images, such as blur and color distortions.
