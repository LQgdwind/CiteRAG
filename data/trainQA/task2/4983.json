      "content": "Paper Title: Universal Deep Image Compression via Content-Adaptive Optimization with Adapters\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nParameter-efficient transfer learning aims to adapt a model pre-trained on a large-scale dataset per task, with reducing the number of adapting parameters.\nUnlike a general adaptation approach that fine-tunes all the parameters of a pre-trained model, most of the model parameters are fixed.\nTherefore, we can reduce the cost of transmission of parameters and preserve the knowledge in pre-training. This task was first studied for obtaining a universal representation of multiple domains in computer vision  [ref]42.\nRecently, motivated by the emergence of a big pre-trained transformer model , such as BERT  and T5 , this task has been studied primarily for training efficiently in natural image processing  . We can classify the algorithms for parameter-efficient transfer learning into the following two types.\n(1) adapting newly added parameters [ref]20  [ref]33  [ref]42 and (2) adapting part of the parameters in the model   .\nThe first approach introduces an adaptation module, such as adapters  [ref]42, compacters , and hyperformers . The second approach adapts normalization and lightweight layers , biases of layers in the model , and sparse difference in model weights . Among these approaches, adapters are widely used [ref]20  [ref]33  [ref]42 .\nAdapters are modules with a small number of parameters.\nThese are implemented as matrix multiplication [ref]42, decomposition of a matrix [ref]42, multiplication of two matrices with activation , or channel-wise scaling [ref]33.\nMotivated by the success of adapters in this task, we used adapters in our framework.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: reduce the cost of transmission of parameters and preserve the knowledge in pre-training. This task was first studied for obtaining a universal representation of multiple domains in computer vision  [ref]42.\nRecently, motivated by the emergence of a big pre-trained transformer model , such as BERT  and T5 , this task has been studied primarily for training efficiently in natural image\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
