OOD Detection.\nWith Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP)  as a baseline method, OOD detection aims to identify inputs that fall outside the scope of the training distribution.\nOutlier Exposure (OE) [ref]7 trains models to differentiate between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples.\nRecent approaches include Virtual Outlier Synthesis (VOS) [ref]8 and LogitNorm .\nVOS adaptively synthesizes virtual outliers, while LogitNorm normalizes the logit vector to reduce overconfidence, using thresholding for OOD detection. Adversarial OOD Detection.\nOther lines of research 0 1 2, focus on providing low confidence for OOD data when perturbed with adversarial noise.\nHein et al. 0 show that ReLU networks can have arbitrarily high confidence for data that is far enough from the training distribution.\nAdditionally, they propose ACET 0, an adversarial training method to enforce low confidence on OOD data, but at the cost of decreased ID accuracy.\nATOM 2 addresses this issue by using outlier mining techniques to automatically select a diverse set of OOD samples from a large pool of potential OOD samples. Guaranteed OOD Detection.\nRecent studies like Bitterwolf et al. 3, Meinke et al. 4 bring forth ℓ∞subscriptℓ\\ell_{\\infty}-norm certified robustness for OOD data with a simple but effective method: Interval Bound Propagation (IBP) 5.\nGOOD 3 proposes a training approach using IBP, but it produce loose bounds, impacting accuracy.\nWhile ProoD 4 combines a certified discriminator and OE model, achieving state-of-the-art performance but with practical limitations: low certified accuracy, reliance on external datasets, and reduced scalability due to IBP’s impact on larger models. \n\n\n\n\nMethods\nIn-Distribution (ID) Accuracy\nOut-Of-Distribution (OOD) Detection\n\nClean\nAdversarial\nCertified\nClean\nAdversarial\nCertified\nAsymptotic\n\n\nℓ∞subscriptℓ\\ell_{\\infty}\nℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}\n\nℓ∞subscriptℓ\\ell_{\\infty}\nℓ∞subscriptℓ\\ell_{\\infty}\nℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}\nunderconfidence\n\n- Standard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOE [ref]7\n✓\n\n\n✓\n\n\n\n\n\nVOS [ref]8\n✓\n\n\n✓\n\n\n\n\n\nLogitNorm \n✓\n\n\n✓\n\n\n\n\n\n- Adversarial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACET 0\n(✓)\n✓\n\n✓\n(✓)\n\n\n\n\nATOM 2\n(✓)\n\n\n✓\n(✓)\n\n\n\n\n- Guaranteed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGOOD 3\n\n\n\n\n✓\n✓\n\n✓\n\nProoD 4\n✓\n\n\n✓\n✓\n✓\n\n✓\n\nDISTRO (Our)\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\n\n In this study, we propose a novel technique for certifying OOD detection within the ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}-norm of the input sample, without requiring the use of binary discriminators or specific training.\nThis enables us to establish a guaranteed upper bound on the classifier’s confidence within a defined region surrounding the input.\nUnlike before, certified robust OOD detection can now be computed for standard OOD detection approaches.\nAdditionally, we incorporate a diffusion denoiser 6 7, which recovers the perturbed images and returns high quality denoised inputs.\nThis leads to better levels of both adversarial and certified robustness for ID and OOD data. This work and previous methods are compared in Table 1. In summary, our contributions are: A novel technique to robustly certify the confidence of any classifier within an ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}-norm on OOD data.\nThis technique can be applied to any architecture and does not require additional components, even though it has higher computational costs compared to previous approaches. A method named DISTRO: DIffusion denoised SmooThing for Robust OOD detection.\nThis method incorporates a diffusion denoiser model to improve the detection of adversarial and certified OOD samples, while providing high adversarial and certified accuracy for ID data.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: OOD Detection.\nWith Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP)  as a baseline method, OOD detection aims to identify inputs that fall outside the scope of the training distribution.\nOutlier Exposure (OE) [ref]7 trains models to differentiate between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples.\nRecent approaches include Virtual Outlier Synthesis (VOS) [ref]8 and LogitNorm .\nVOS\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
