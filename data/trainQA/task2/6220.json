      "content": "Paper Title: A Measure-Theoretic Axiomatisation of Causality\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCausal reasoning has been recognised as a hallmark of human and machine intelligence, and in the recent years, the machine learning community has taken up a rapidly growing interest in the subject   , in particular in representation learning      [ref]40 and natural language processing  .\nCausality has also been extensively studied in a wide range of other research domains, including, but not limited to, philosophy [ref]39  , psychology , statistics   including social, biological and medical sciences    [ref]26, mechanics and law . The field of causality was born from the observation that probability theory and statistics (Figure 1(a)) cannot encode the notion of causality, and so we need additional mathematical tools to support the enhanced view of the world involving causality (Figure 1(b)). Our goal in this paper is to give an axiomatic framework of the forwards direction of Figure 1(b), which currently consists of many competing models (see Related Works). As a starting point, we observe that the forwards direction of Figure 1(a), i.e. probability theory, has a set of axioms based on measure theory (Axioms 2.1) that are widely accepted and used111Kolmogorov’s axiomatisation is without doubt the standard in probability theory. However, we are aware of other, less popular frameworks, for example, one that is more amenable to Bayesian probability , one based on game theory  and imprecise probabilities 1., and hence argue that it is natural to take the primitive objects of this framework as the basic building blocks. Despite the fact that all of the existing mathematical frameworks of causality recognise the crucial role that probability plays / should play in any causal theory, it is surprising that few of them try to build directly upon the axioms of probability theory, and those that do fall short in different ways (see Related Works). On the other hand, we place manipulations at the heart of our approach to causality; in other words, we make changes to some parts of a system, and we are interested in what happens to the rest of this system. This manipulative philosophy towards causality is shared by many philosophers , and is the essence behind almost all causal frameworks proposed and adopted in the statistics/machine learning community that we are aware of. To this end, we propose the notion of causal spaces (Definition 2.2), constructed by adding causal objects, called causal kernels, directly to probability spaces. We show that causal spaces strictly generalise (the interventional aspects of) existing frameworks, i.e. given any configuration of, for example, a structural causal model or potential outcomes framework, we can construct a causal space that can carry the same (interventional) information. Further, we show that causal spaces can seamlessly support situations where existing frameworks struggle, for example those with hidden confounders, cyclic causal relationships or continuous-time stochastic processes.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: of human and machine intelligence, and in the recent years, the machine learning community has taken up a rapidly growing interest in the subject   , in particular in representation learning      [ref]40 and natural language processing  .\nCausality has also been extensively studied in a wide range of other research domains, including, but not limited to, philosophy [ref]39  , psychology ,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
