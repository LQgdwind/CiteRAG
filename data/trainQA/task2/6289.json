      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Diffusion-based Image Translation using Asymmetric Gradient Guidance\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, the combination of pre-trained GAN models and the CLIP model has been proposed for various applications\nsuch as naive generation [ref]22, style transfer with fine-tuning the models [ref]12, and text-guided editing . However, generating images through GAN has limitations such as restricted domains and poor performance.\nWith the development of diffusion-based models, recent attempts combined the CLIP and the diffusion model for various tasks such as generating text-conditioned images    or editing images using mask regions  . Some methods involve tuning the entire or part of the model to transform images  . Methods that can transform images based on text conditions without training but only through the sampling process [ref]19  have also demonstrated impressive performance. Independent from text-conditioned image manipulation, several researchs have been conducted on image manipulation with target image conditions. Initially, image style transfer models using feature tensor modulation    were developed. Subsequently methods adapting GAN models    showed good performance. Recent models can transfer the appearance of one-shot images based on ViT feature , and subsequent studies inspired by this have successfully combined diffusion models to transfer appearance [ref]19.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: Recently, the combination of pre-trained GAN models and the CLIP model has been proposed for various applications\nsuch as naive generation [ref]22, style transfer with fine-tuning the models [ref]12, and text-guided editing .
