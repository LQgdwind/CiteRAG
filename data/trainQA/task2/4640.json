Let hksubscriptℎ𝑘h_{k} be a history, of actions and observations alongside the prior belief, obtained\nby the agent up to time instance k𝑘k. The posterior belief bksubscript𝑏𝑘b_{k} is a shorthand for the probability density function of the state given all information up to current time index bk​(xk)≜p​(xk|hk)≜subscript𝑏𝑘subscript𝑥𝑘𝑝conditionalsubscript𝑥𝑘subscriptℎ𝑘b_{k}(x_{k})\\triangleq p(x_{k}|h_{k}).\nThe policy is a, indexed by the time instances, mapping from belief to action to be executed πk:ℬ↦𝒜:subscript𝜋𝑘maps-toℬ𝒜\\pi_{k}:\\mathcal{B}\\mapsto\\mathcal{A}, where ℬℬ\\mathcal{B} is the space of all the beliefs taken into account in the problem. The policy for L𝐿L consecutive steps ahead is denoted by πk:k+L−1subscript𝜋:𝑘𝑘𝐿1\\pi_{k:k+L-1}. Sometimes we will omit the time indices for clarity and write π𝜋\\pi. We hope the time indices will be evident from the context.\nWhen an information theoretic reward, for instance, information gain, is introduced to the problem, the reward can assume the following form ρ​(b,a,z′,b′)=(1−λ)​rx​(b,a)+λ​rI​(b,a,z′,b′)𝜌𝑏𝑎superscript𝑧′superscript𝑏′1𝜆superscript𝑟𝑥𝑏𝑎𝜆superscript𝑟𝐼𝑏𝑎superscript𝑧′superscript𝑏′\\rho(b,a,z^{\\prime},b^{\\prime})\\!=\\!(1\\!-\\!\\lambda)r^{x}(b,a)\\!+\\!\\lambda r^{I}(b,a,z^{\\prime},b^{\\prime}), in this case it is a function of two subsequent beliefs, an action, and an observation. Note that in the setting of nonparametric beliefs, we shall resort to sampling approximations using mxsubscript𝑚𝑥m_{x} samples of the belief. Such a reward is comprised of the expectation over the state and action dependent reward and the information-theoretic reward rI​(⋅)superscript𝑟𝐼⋅r^{I}(\\cdot) weighted by λ𝜆\\lambda, which in general can be dependent on consecutive beliefs and the elements relating them (e.g. information gain).\nThe online decision making goal is to find an action to execute, maximizing the action value function where π𝜋\\pi is the policy and the value function is expected cumulative reward under the particular policy π𝜋\\pi. When the agent performs an action and receives an observation, it shall update its belief from b𝑏b to b′superscript𝑏′b^{\\prime}. Let us denote the update operator by ψ𝜓\\psi such that b′=ψ​(b,a,z′)superscript𝑏′𝜓𝑏𝑎superscript𝑧′b^{\\prime}=\\psi(b,a,z^{\\prime}). In our context, it will be a particle filter since we focus on the setting of nonparametric beliefs. Moreover, we define a propagated belief b′⁣−superscript𝑏′b^{\\prime-} as the belief b𝑏b after the robot performed an action a𝑎a and before it received and observation. In this paper, we present a new risk-averse decision making problem. We augment the ρ𝜌\\rho-POMDP  objective with a novel, probabilistic general belief-dependent constraint. To our knowledge, all previous chance constrained formulations such as , 7 suffer from limiting assumptions. To be specific, they perform averaging over the state trajectories as we unveil in this work and therefore are not distribution-aware formulations. Moreover, a general belief-dependent constraint was not studied nor proposed. Nevertheless, such a constraint is of the highest importance. For instance, as we discuss in , such a formulation can be used to determine when to stop exploration, e.g. in an active SLAM context, which is an open problem currently , 6. Risk-averse planning has been actively investigated , [ref]24, but risk aversion was not considered for the constraint to the best of our knowledge.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: , such a formulation can be used to determine when to stop exploration, e.g. in an active SLAM context, which is an open problem currently , 6.
