Furthermore, the previous methods identify the abnormal actions for each frame   [ref]22  or each video clip  [ref]7  [ref]20.\nThey also follow supervised  [ref]7  or unsupervised   [ref]22 [ref]20  manners depending on whether annotations are given.\nBecause the annotation cost is lower, the proposed method makes use of the skeleton-based approach, which recognizes abnormal actions at the video level in an unsupervised manner. This study uses two assumptions; the users can define the categories of abnormal actions111It is obvious that the normal actions can be defined as the opposite of the abnormal actions while we focus on the definition of the abnormal actions to simplify the explanation. (e.g., violence in Fig. 1), and the observed training samples consist of normal actions.\nAdditionally, unobserved training actions are referred to as out-of-distribution (OoD) (e.g., “handshake” and “pushing” in Fig. 1).\nThe OoD actions include unobserved normal actions (e.g., only “handshake” in Fig. 1) when a sufficient variety of normal samples is not observed in the training phase. This study focuses on limitations in the previous studies [ref]20 [ref]22 to improve the scalability, such as expanding to different applications and enhancing the performance, as described below. Target domain-dependent DNN training.\nThe previous methods require time for training the DNNs with expensive computational resources for each scene when the applications are initialized, or the domain shift between the training and inference phases occurs, such as changes in distribution over time.\nAs a result, there are limitations on the applications, and use restrictions are put in place. Lack of normal samples.\nIn the real-world scenario, a variety of normal actions cannot be obtained to train the DNNs.\nIn such cases, most actions are regarded as abnormal, that is, normal but OoD actions are misidentified abnormal.\nConsequently, it is preferred that users be able to define the target abnormal and/or normal actions to be recognized, as shown in Fig. 1. Robustness against skeleton errors.\nThe majority of traditional skeleton-based methods  [ref]22 [ref]20  presuppose that DNNs, like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), propagates the features densely between joints.\nThus, the anomaly recognition accuracy degrades if joint detection errors (False Positives (FPs) and False Negatives (FNs)) occur in the pose detection or if the multi-person pose tracking fails as a result of environmental noises, such as illumination fluctuations. To simultaneously overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel, prompt-guided zero-shot222We consider that normal samples do not directly contribute to representation learning, and thus follow a definition of zero-shot learning by Xian et al. , which directly obtains representations of unknown classes. framework for recognizing abnormal actions using a pretrained deep feature extractor with human skeleton sequences input.\nThe method does not require observation of abnormal actions or their ground-truth labels to train DNNs.\nIn particular, to address the first training limitation, we model the distribution of normal samples during the training333Training refers to learning normal and/or abnormal samples and is distinguished from pre-training on a dataset for action recognition, which does not learn such samples. phase by utilizing DNNs with skeleton feature representations that have been pretrained on a sizable action recognition dataset, such as Kinetics-400 .\nThe weights of the skeleton feature extractor are frozen during the training phase, and thus their features are relatively independent to the targeted domain. To address the second normal-sample limitation, we reduce the misdetections that the normal action is identified as abnormal by utilizing the text prompts regarding the abnormal actions provided by the users to indirectly supplement the information of the normal actions.\nWe integrate a similarity score between the skeleton features and the text embeddings extracted from a text encoder into the anomaly score.\nBy implementing a contrastive learning scheme between skeleton features and text embeddings, it can be accomplished in the context of vision and language, which has been actively studied in recent years. Inspired by a point cloud deep learning paradigm, we introduce a more straightforward DNN that sparsely propagates the features between joints as such a feature extractor, improving the robustness against such skeleton errors in the third limitation mentioned above.\nThis architecture eliminates the constraints on input skeletons such as the input joint size and order, which are dependent on the dataset/domain.\nIt allows us to divert the pretrained feature extractor frozen across different domains/datasets without any fine-/hyperparameter-tuning and to simultaneously model both the distribution of normal samples and the joint-skeleton text embedding space over the domains/datasets. In summary, the main contributions of this work are listed as follows:\n(1) We demonstrate experimentally that DNN training with normal samples can be eliminated via the skeleton feature representations pretrained using a large-scale action recognition dataset.\n(2) We show that the zero-shot learning paradigm, which handles the skeleton features and text embeddings in the common space, can be efficient for modeling the distributions of the normal and abnormal actions.\nIt is supported by a brand new unified framework that incorporates user guided text embeddings into the computation of the anomaly score.\n(3) We demonstrate experimentally that the permutation-invariant architecture, which sparsely propagates the features between joints, works as the skeleton feature extractor that models the normal samples and the joint-skeleton text embedding space over domains and enhances robustness against skeleton errors.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Anomaly action recognition, the task that detects whether the person(s) in the video is/are behaving abnormally  [ref]7  [ref]20 [ref]22   , becomes an essential piece of technology for averting accidents and crimes [ref]7 .\nThe previous work can be classified into two methods that leverage appearance\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
