      "content": "Paper Title: Dichotomies for Maximum Matching Cut: 𝐻-Freeness, Bounded Diameter, Bounded Radius1footnote 11footnote 1An extended abstract of this paper appeared in the proceedings of MFCS 2023 [33].\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA matching M𝑀M (i.e., a set of pairwise disjoint edges) of a connected graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) is a matching cut if V𝑉V can be partitioned into a set of blue vertices B𝐵B and a set of red vertices R𝑅R, such that M𝑀M consists of all the edges with one end-vertex in B𝐵B and the other one in R𝑅R. Graphs with matching cuts were introduced in 1970 by Graham  (as decomposable graphs) to solve a problem on cube numbering. Other relevant applications include ILFI networks , WDM networks , graph drawing  and surjective graph homomorphisms [ref]20. The decision problem is called Matching Cut: does a given connected graph have a matching cut? In 1984, Chvátal 1 proved that it is NP-complete even for graphs of maximum degree at most 444. Afterwards, parameterized and exact algorithms were given [ref]2  9   . A variant called Disconnected Perfect Matching\n“does a connected graph have a perfect matching that contains a matching cut?” has also been studied  6  (see Section 1.2 for more on this problem). Moreover, Matching Cut was generalized, for every d≥1𝑑1d\\geq 1, to d𝑑d-Cut “does a connected graph have an edge cut where each vertex has at most d𝑑d neighbours across the cut?”  . In particular, many results have appeared where the input for Matching Cut was restricted to some special graph class, and this is what we do in our paper as well.\nWe first discuss related work, restricting ourselves mainly to those classes relevant to our paper (see, for example,  for a more comprehensive overview):\n graphs of bounded diameter; graphs of bounded radius; hereditary graph classes; in particular H𝐻H-free graphs. The distance between two vertices u𝑢u and v𝑣v in a connected graph G𝐺G is the length (number of edges) of a shortest path between u𝑢u and v𝑣v in G𝐺G. The eccentricity of a vertex u𝑢u is the maximum distance between u𝑢u and any other vertex of G𝐺G. The diameter, denoted by 𝖽𝗂𝖺𝗆𝖾𝗍𝖾𝗋​(G)𝖽𝗂𝖺𝗆𝖾𝗍𝖾𝗋𝐺{\\sf diameter}(G), and radius, denoted by 𝗋𝖺𝖽𝗂𝗎𝗌​(G)𝗋𝖺𝖽𝗂𝗎𝗌𝐺{\\sf radius}(G), are the maximum and minimum eccentricity, respectively, over all vertices of G𝐺G; note that 𝗋𝖺𝖽𝗂𝗎𝗌​(G)≤𝖽𝗂𝖺𝗆𝖾𝗍𝖾𝗋​(G)≤2⋅𝗋𝖺𝖽𝗂𝗎𝗌​(G)𝗋𝖺𝖽𝗂𝗎𝗌𝐺𝖽𝗂𝖺𝗆𝖾𝗍𝖾𝗋𝐺⋅2𝗋𝖺𝖽𝗂𝗎𝗌𝐺{\\sf radius}(G)\\leq{\\sf diameter}(G)\\leq 2\\cdot{\\sf radius}(G) for every graph G𝐺G. The Matching Cut problem is polynomial-time solvable for graphs of diameter at most 222  [ref]28. This result was extended to graphs of radius at most 222 2. In contrast, the problem is NP-complete for graphs of diameter at most 333 [ref]28, yielding two dichotomies: For an integer d≥1𝑑1d\\geq 1, Matching Cut for graphs of diameter d𝑑d and for graphs of radius d𝑑d is polynomial-time solvable if d≤2𝑑2d\\leq 2 and NP-complete if d≥3𝑑3d\\geq 3. A class of graphs is hereditary if it is closed under vertex deletion. Hereditary graph classes include many well-known classes, such as those that are H𝐻H-free for some graph H𝐻H.\nA graph G𝐺G is H𝐻H-free if G𝐺G does not contain H𝐻H as an induced subgraph, that is, G𝐺G cannot be modified into H𝐻H by a sequence of vertex deletions. For a set of graphs ℋℋ{\\cal H},\na graph G𝐺G is ℋℋ{\\cal H}-free if G𝐺G is H𝐻H-free for every H∈ℋ𝐻ℋH\\in{\\cal H}. If ℋ={H1,…,Hp}ℋsubscript𝐻1…subscript𝐻𝑝{\\cal H}=\\{H_{1},\\ldots,H_{p}\\} for some p≥1𝑝1p\\geq 1, we also say that G𝐺G is (H1,…,Hp)subscript𝐻1…subscript𝐻𝑝(H_{1},\\ldots,H_{p})-free. Note that a class of graphs 𝒢𝒢{\\cal G} is hereditary if and only if there is a set of graphs ℋℋ{\\cal H}, such that every graph in 𝒢𝒢{\\cal G} is ℋℋ{\\cal H}-free. Hence, for a systematic complexity study, it is natural to first focus on the case where ℋℋ{\\cal H} has size 111; see, e.g.,  0 2 8  8. For an integer r≥1𝑟1r\\geq 1, let Prsubscript𝑃𝑟P_{r} denote the path on r𝑟r vertices, K1,rsubscript𝐾1𝑟K_{1,r} the star on r+1𝑟1r+1 vertices, and K1,r+esubscript𝐾1𝑟𝑒K_{1,r}+e the graph obtained from K1,rsubscript𝐾1𝑟K_{1,r} by adding one edge (between two leaves). The graph K1,3subscript𝐾13K_{1,3} is also known as the claw.\nFor s≥3𝑠3s\\geq 3, let Cssubscript𝐶𝑠C_{s} denote the cycle on s𝑠s vertices. Let H1∗subscriptsuperscript𝐻1H^{*}_{1} be the graph that looks like the letter “H𝐻H”, and for i≥2𝑖2i\\geq 2, let Hi∗superscriptsubscript𝐻𝑖H_{i}^{*} be the graph obtained from H1∗superscriptsubscript𝐻1H_{1}^{*} by subdividing the middle edge of H1∗superscriptsubscript𝐻1H_{1}^{*} exactly i−1𝑖1i-1 times; see also Figure 1. We denote the disjoint union of two graphs G1subscript𝐺1G_{1} and G2subscript𝐺2G_{2} by G1+G2=(V​(G1)∪V​(G2),E​(G1)∪E​(G2))subscript𝐺1subscript𝐺2𝑉subscript𝐺1𝑉subscript𝐺2𝐸subscript𝐺1𝐸subscript𝐺2G_{1}+G_{2}=(V(G_{1})\\cup V(G_{2}),E(G_{1})\\cup E(G_{2})). We denote by s​G𝑠𝐺sG the disjoint union of s𝑠s copies of G𝐺G, for s≥1𝑠1s\\geq 1. Polynomial-time algorithms for Matching Cut exist for subcubic graphs (graphs of maximum degree at most 333) 1, K1,3subscript𝐾13K_{1,3}-free graphs , P6subscript𝑃6P_{6}-free graphs 2, (K1,4,K1,4+e)subscript𝐾14subscript𝐾14𝑒(K_{1,4},K_{1,4}+e)-free graphs  and quadrangulated graphs, i.e., (C5,C6,…)subscript𝐶5subscript𝐶6…(C_{5},C_{6},\\ldots)-free graphs 5; the latter class contains the class of chordal graphs, i.e., (C4,C5,C6,…)subscript𝐶4subscript𝐶5subscript𝐶6…(C_{4},C_{5},C_{6},\\ldots)-free graphs. Moreover, if Matching Cut is polynomial-time solvable for H𝐻H-free graphs, then it is so for (H+P3)𝐻subscript𝑃3(H+P_{3})-free graphs 2.\nThe problem is NP-complete even for\ngraphs of maximum degree at most 444 1;\nK1,4subscript𝐾14K_{1,4}-free graphs 1 (see  ); planar graphs of girth 555 ; K1,5subscript𝐾15K_{1,5}-free bipartite graphs 0; graphs of girth at least g𝑔g, for every g≥3𝑔3g\\geq 3 6;\n(3​P5,P15)3subscript𝑃5subscript𝑃15(3P_{5},P_{15})-free graphs  (improving a result of 5); bipartite graphs where the vertices in one bipartition class all have degree exactly 222 5 and thus for Hi∗superscriptsubscript𝐻𝑖H_{i}^{*}-free graphs for every odd i≥1𝑖1i\\geq 1; and for Hi∗superscriptsubscript𝐻𝑖H_{i}^{*}-free graphs for every even i≥2𝑖2i\\geq 2 6.\nRecently, Le and Le  proved that Matching Cut is NP-complete even for (3​P6,2​P7,P14)3subscript𝑃62subscript𝑃7subscript𝑃14(3P_{6},2P_{7},P_{14})-free graphs.\nIn fact, their hardness gadget also works for Perfect Matching Cut (defined below) and Disconnected Perfect Matching and can be readily checked to have diameter 444 and radius 333. The above results imply the following partial complexity classification, which leaves open only a number of cases where H𝐻H is a linear forest, that is, the disjoint union of one or more paths. For two graphs H𝐻H and H′superscript𝐻′H^{\\prime}, we write H⊆iH′subscript𝑖𝐻superscript𝐻′H\\subseteq_{i}H^{\\prime} if H𝐻H is an induced subgraph of H′superscript𝐻′H^{\\prime}. For a graph H𝐻H, Matching Cut on H𝐻H-free graphs is polynomial-time solvable if H⊆is​P3+K1,3subscript𝑖𝐻𝑠subscript𝑃3subscript𝐾13H\\subseteq_{i}sP_{3}+K_{1,3} or s​P3+P6𝑠subscript𝑃3subscript𝑃6sP_{3}+P_{6} for some s≥0𝑠0s\\geq 0, and NP-complete if H⊇iK1,4subscriptsuperset-of-or-equals𝑖𝐻subscript𝐾14H\\supseteq_{i}K_{1,4}, P14subscript𝑃14P_{14}, 2​P72subscript𝑃72P_{7}, 3​P53subscript𝑃53P_{5}, Crsubscript𝐶𝑟C_{r} for some r≥3𝑟3r\\geq 3 or Hj∗superscriptsubscript𝐻𝑗H_{j}^{*} for some j≥1𝑗1j\\geq 1.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: in 1970 by Graham  (as decomposable graphs) to solve a problem on cube numbering.
