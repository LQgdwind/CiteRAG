      "content": "Paper Title: Preserving Linear Separability in Continual Learning by Backward Feature Projection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFirst, we evaluate the performance of Joint Training (JT) and Finetuning (FT) baselines on each dataset. JT trains the network on all training data, does not have the forgetting problem, and thus indicates the upper-bound performance of CL methods. On the contrary, FT simply performs SGD using the current task data without handling forgetting at all and indicates a lower-bound performance. As a feature distillation method, our method can be combined with most continual learning methods. In our evaluation, we test our method by combing it with two popular experience replay methods, ER [ref]43 and DER++ [ref]8. ER uses a memory buffer to store the training examples from past tasks and interleaves them with the current task data for training.\nIn addition to this, DER++ records the output logits of the examples in the memory and performs logit distillation when doing experience replay. We combine the proposed BFP loss with ER and DER++ and denote them as ER w/ BFP and DER++ w/ BFP respectively. We also compare the proposed method with some other state-of-the-art CL baselines as listed in Table 1.\nIncremental Classifier and Presentation Learning (iCaRL) [ref]42 performs classification using the nearest mean-of-exemplars, where the exemplars selected by herding algorithm in the feature space.\nFunctional Distance Regularization (FDR)  regularize the output of the network to its past value. Different from DER/DER++, FDR applies the regularization on the output classification probability.\nLearning a Unified Classifier Incrementally via Rebalancing (LUCIR)  augments experience replay with multiple modifications to preserve old knowledge and enforce separation class separation in continual learning.\nBias Correction (BiC) 1 augments the experience replay by learning a separate layer to correct the bias in the output logits.\nER with Asymmetric Cross-Entropy (ER-ACE)  proposes to reduce representation drift by using separate cross-entropy loss for online and replayed training data.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: As a feature distillation method, our method can be combined with most continual learning methods. In our evaluation, we test our method by combing it with two popular experience replay methods, ER [ref]43 and DER++ [ref]8.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
