      "content": "Paper Title: Linear-time Temporal Logic with Team Semantics: Expressivity and Complexity\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn 6, Lück established that the model checking problem for TeamLTL​(∼)TeamLTLsimilar-to\\mathrm{TeamLTL}(\\sim) is highly undecidable.\nThe proof heavily utilises the interplay between Boolean negation ∼similar-to\\sim and disjunction ∨\\lor; it was left as an open problem whether some sensible restrictions on the use of the Boolean negation would lead toward discovering decidable logics.\nWe show that, on the contrary, the decidability bounds are much tighter.\nAlready TeamLTL​(⊆,∨⃝)TeamLTL∨⃝\\mathrm{TeamLTL}(\\subseteq,\\varovee) (which is subsumed by TeamLTL(∨⃝,∼⊥,𝖠1)\\mathrm{TeamLTL}(\\varovee,{\\sim\\!\\bot},\\accentset{1}{\\mathsf{A}})) is undecidable, and already very restricted access to ∼similar-to\\sim (namely, a single use of the 𝖠𝖠\\mathsf{A} quantifier) leads to high undecidability. We define the model checking problem based on Kripke structures K=(W,R,η,w0)K𝑊𝑅𝜂subscript𝑤0\\mathrm{K}=(W,R,\\eta,w_{0}), where W𝑊W is a finite set of states, R⊆W2𝑅superscript𝑊2R\\subseteq W^{2} the transition relation, η:W→2AP:𝜂→𝑊superscript2AP\\eta\\colon W\\rightarrow 2^{\\mathrm{AP}} a labelling function, and w0∈Wsubscript𝑤0𝑊w_{0}\\in W an initial state of W𝑊W.\nA path σ𝜎\\sigma through KK\\mathrm{K} is an infinite sequence σ∈Wω𝜎superscript𝑊𝜔\\sigma\\in W^{\\omega} such that σ​[ref]0=w0𝜎delimited-[]0subscript𝑤0\\sigma[ref]0=w_{0} and (σ​[i],σ​[i+1])∈R𝜎delimited-[]𝑖𝜎delimited-[]𝑖1𝑅(\\sigma[i],\\sigma[i+1])\\in R for every i≥0𝑖0i\\geq 0. The trace of σ𝜎\\sigma is defined as t(σ):=η(σ[ref]0)η(σ[ref]1)⋯∈(2AP)ωt(\\sigma)\\mathrel{\\mathop{:}}=\\eta(\\sigma[ref]0)\\eta(\\sigma[ref]1)\\dots\\in(2^{\\mathrm{AP}})^{\\omega}. A Kripke structure KK\\mathrm{K} induces a set of traces Traces​(K)={t​(σ)∣σ​ is a path through K}TracesKconditional-set𝑡𝜎𝜎 is a path through K\\mathrm{Traces}(\\mathrm{K})=\\{t(\\sigma)\\mid\\sigma\\text{ is a path through $\\mathrm{K}$}\\}. The model checking problem of a logic ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} is the following decision problem:\nGiven a formula φ∈ℒ𝜑ℒ\\varphi\\in\\mathcal{L} and a Kripke structure K𝐾K over APAP\\mathrm{AP}, determine whether (𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑠​(K),0)⊧φmodels𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑠𝐾0𝜑(\\mathit{Traces}(K),0)\\models\\varphi. Our undecidability results are obtained by reductions from non-deterministic 3-counter machines. A non-deterministic 3-counter machine M𝑀M consists of a list I𝐼I of n𝑛n instructions that manipulate three counters Clsubscript𝐶𝑙C_{l}, Cmsubscript𝐶𝑚C_{m}, and Crsubscript𝐶𝑟C_{r}. All instructions are of the following forms: Ca+​ goto ​{j1,j2}superscriptsubscript𝐶𝑎 goto subscript𝑗1subscript𝑗2C_{a}^{+}\\text{ goto }\\{j_{1},j_{2}\\},   Ca−​ goto ​{j1,j2}superscriptsubscript𝐶𝑎 goto subscript𝑗1subscript𝑗2C_{a}^{-}\\text{ goto }\\{j_{1},j_{2}\\},   if ​Ca=0​ goto ​j1​else goto ​j2if subscript𝐶𝑎0 goto subscript𝑗1else goto subscript𝑗2\\text{if }C_{a}=0\\text{ goto }j_{1}\\text{else goto }j_{2}, where a∈{l,m,r}𝑎𝑙𝑚𝑟a\\in\\{l,m,r\\}, 0≤j1,j2<nformulae-sequence0subscript𝑗1subscript𝑗2𝑛0\\leq j_{1},j_{2}<n. A configuration is a tuple (i,j,k,t)𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑡(i,j,k,t), where 0≤i<n0𝑖𝑛0\\leq i<n is the next instruction to be executed, and j,k,t∈ℕ𝑗𝑘𝑡ℕj,k,t\\in\\mathbb{N} are the current values of the counters Clsubscript𝐶𝑙C_{l}, Cmsubscript𝐶𝑚C_{m}, and Crsubscript𝐶𝑟C_{r}. The execution of the instruction i:Ca+​ goto ​{j1,j2}:𝑖superscriptsubscript𝐶𝑎 goto subscript𝑗1subscript𝑗2i\\colon C_{a}^{+}\\text{ goto }\\{j_{1},j_{2}\\} (i:Ca−​ goto ​{j1,j2}:𝑖superscriptsubscript𝐶𝑎 goto subscript𝑗1subscript𝑗2i\\colon C_{a}^{-}\\text{ goto }\\{j_{1},j_{2}\\}, resp.) increments (decrements, resp.) the value of the counter Casubscript𝐶𝑎C_{a} by 111. The next instruction is selected nondeterministically from the set {j1,j2}subscript𝑗1subscript𝑗2\\{j_{1},j_{2}\\}. The instruction i:if ​Ca=0​ goto ​j1,else goto ​j2:𝑖if subscript𝐶𝑎0 goto subscript𝑗1else goto subscript𝑗2i\\colon\\text{if }C_{a}=0\\text{ goto }j_{1},\\text{else goto }j_{2} checks whether the value of the counter Casubscript𝐶𝑎C_{a} is currently 00 and proceeds to the next instruction accordingly. The consecution relation ↝csubscriptleads-toc\\leadsto_{\\mathrm{c}} of configurations is defined as usual. The lossy consecution relation (i1,i2,i3,i4)↝lc(j1,j2,j3,j4)subscriptleads-tolcsubscript𝑖1subscript𝑖2subscript𝑖3subscript𝑖4subscript𝑗1subscript𝑗2subscript𝑗3subscript𝑗4(i_{1},i_{2},i_{3},i_{4})\\leadsto_{\\mathrm{lc}}(j_{1},j_{2},j_{3},j_{4}) of configurations holds if (i1,i2′,i3′,i4′)↝c(j1,j2′,j3′,j4′)subscriptleads-tocsubscript𝑖1subscriptsuperscript𝑖′2subscriptsuperscript𝑖′3subscriptsuperscript𝑖′4subscript𝑗1subscriptsuperscript𝑗′2subscriptsuperscript𝑗′3subscriptsuperscript𝑗′4(i_{1},i^{\\prime}_{2},i^{\\prime}_{3},i^{\\prime}_{4})\\leadsto_{\\mathrm{c}}(j_{1},j^{\\prime}_{2},j^{\\prime}_{3},j^{\\prime}_{4}) holds for some i2′,i3′,i4′,j2′,j3′,j4′subscriptsuperscript𝑖′2subscriptsuperscript𝑖′3subscriptsuperscript𝑖′4subscriptsuperscript𝑗′2subscriptsuperscript𝑗′3subscriptsuperscript𝑗′4i^{\\prime}_{2},i^{\\prime}_{3},i^{\\prime}_{4},j^{\\prime}_{2},j^{\\prime}_{3},j^{\\prime}_{4} with i2≥i2′subscript𝑖2subscriptsuperscript𝑖′2i_{2}\\geq i^{\\prime}_{2}, i3≥i3′subscript𝑖3subscriptsuperscript𝑖′3i_{3}\\geq i^{\\prime}_{3}, i4≥i4′subscript𝑖4subscriptsuperscript𝑖′4i_{4}\\geq i^{\\prime}_{4}, j2′≥j2subscriptsuperscript𝑗′2subscript𝑗2j^{\\prime}_{2}\\geq j_{2}, j3′≥j3subscriptsuperscript𝑗′3subscript𝑗3j^{\\prime}_{3}\\geq j_{3}, and j4′≥j4subscriptsuperscript𝑗′4subscript𝑗4j^{\\prime}_{4}\\geq j_{4}. A (lossy) computation is an infinite sequence of (lossy) consecutive configurations starting from the initial configuration (0,0,0,0)0000(0,0,0,0). A (lossy) computation is b𝑏b-recurring if the instruction labelled b𝑏b occurs infinitely often in it.\nDeciding whether a given non-deterministic 333-counter machine has a b𝑏b-recurring (b𝑏b-recurring lossy) computation for a given b𝑏b is Σ11superscriptsubscriptΣ11\\Sigma_{1}^{1}-complete (Σ10superscriptsubscriptΣ10\\Sigma_{1}^{0}-complete, resp.)  . We reduce the existence of a b𝑏b-recurring lossy computation of a given 333-counter machine M𝑀M and an instruction label b𝑏b to the model checking problem of TeamLTL​(⊆,∨⃝)TeamLTL∨⃝\\mathrm{TeamLTL}(\\subseteq,\\varovee).\nWe also illustrate that with a single instance of 𝖠𝖠\\mathsf{A} we can enforce non-lossy computation instead. Model checking for TeamLTL​(⊆,∨⃝)TeamLTL∨⃝\\mathrm{TeamLTL}(\\subseteq,\\varovee) is Σ10superscriptsubscriptΣ10\\Sigma_{1}^{0}-hard. Given a set I𝐼I of instructions of a 333-counter machine M𝑀M, and an instruction label b𝑏b, we construct a TeamLTL​(⊆,∨⃝)TeamLTL∨⃝\\mathrm{TeamLTL}(\\subseteq,\\varovee)-formula φI,bsubscript𝜑𝐼𝑏\\varphi_{I,b} and a Kripke structure KIsubscriptK𝐼\\mathrm{K}_{I} such that The Σ10superscriptsubscriptΣ10\\Sigma_{1}^{0}-hardness then follows since our construction is clearly computable. The idea is the following:\nPut n:=|I|n\\mathrel{\\mathop{:}}=\\lvert I\\rvert. A set T𝑇T of traces using propositions {cl,cm,cr,d,0,…,n−1}subscript𝑐𝑙subscript𝑐𝑚subscript𝑐𝑟𝑑0…𝑛1\\{c_{l},c_{m},c_{r},d,0,\\dots,n-1\\} encodes the sequence (c→j)j∈ℕsubscriptsubscript→𝑐𝑗𝑗ℕ(\\vec{c}_{j})_{j\\in\\mathbb{N}} of configurations, if for each j∈ℕ𝑗ℕj\\in\\mathbb{N} and c→j=(i,vl,vm,vr)subscript→𝑐𝑗𝑖subscript𝑣𝑙subscript𝑣𝑚subscript𝑣𝑟\\vec{c}_{j}=(i,v_{l},v_{m},v_{r}) t​[j]∩{0,…,n−1}={i}𝑡delimited-[]𝑗0…𝑛1𝑖t[j]\\cap\\{0,\\dots,n-1\\}=\\{i\\}, for all t∈T𝑡𝑇t\\in T, |{t​[j,∞]∣cs∈t​[j],t∈T}|=vsconditional-set𝑡𝑗formulae-sequencesubscript𝑐𝑠𝑡delimited-[]𝑗𝑡𝑇subscript𝑣𝑠\\lvert\\{t[j,\\infty]\\mid c_{s}\\in t[j],t\\in T\\}\\rvert=v_{s}, for each s∈{l,m,r}𝑠𝑙𝑚𝑟s\\in\\{l,m,r\\}.\n Hence, we use T​[j,∞]𝑇𝑗T[j,\\infty] to encode the configuration c→jsubscript→𝑐𝑗\\vec{c}_{j}; the propositions 0,…,n−10…𝑛10,\\dots,n-1 are used to encode the next instruction, and cl,cm,cr,dsubscript𝑐𝑙subscript𝑐𝑚subscript𝑐𝑟𝑑c_{l},c_{m},c_{r},d are used to encode the values of the counters. The proposition d𝑑d is a dummy proposition used to separate traces with identical postfixes with respect to clsubscript𝑐𝑙c_{l}, cmsubscript𝑐𝑚c_{m}, and crsubscript𝑐𝑟c_{r}.\nThe Kripke structure KI=(W,R,η,w0)subscriptK𝐼𝑊𝑅𝜂subscript𝑤0\\mathrm{K}_{I}=(W,R,\\eta,w_{0}) over the set of propositions {cl,cm,cr,d,0,…,n−1}subscript𝑐𝑙subscript𝑐𝑚subscript𝑐𝑟𝑑0…𝑛1\\{c_{l},c_{m},c_{r},d,0,\\dots,n-1\\} is defined such that every possible sequence of configurations of M𝑀M starting from (0,0,0,0)0000(0,0,0,0) can be encoded by some team (T,0)𝑇0(T,0), where T⊆Traces​(KI)𝑇TracessubscriptK𝐼T\\subseteq\\mathrm{Traces}(\\mathrm{K}_{I}).\nA detailed construction of the formula φI,bsubscript𝜑𝐼𝑏\\varphi_{I,b} and the Kripke structure KIsubscriptK𝐼\\mathrm{K}_{I} together with a detailed proof for the fact that (1) indeed holds can be found in Appendix B. The underlying reason for utilising lossy computations in the above proof is the following: In our encoding, we use the cardinality of the set |{t​[j,∞]∣cl∈t​[j],t∈T}|conditional-set𝑡𝑗formulae-sequencesubscript𝑐𝑙𝑡delimited-[]𝑗𝑡𝑇\\lvert\\{t[j,\\infty]\\mid c_{l}\\in t[j],t\\in T\\}\\rvert to encode the value of the counter Clsubscript𝐶𝑙C_{l} in the j𝑗jth configuration. It might, however, happen that two distinct traces t,t′∈T𝑡superscript𝑡′𝑇t,t^{\\prime}\\in T have the same postfix, that is, t​[j,∞]=t′​[j,∞]𝑡𝑗superscript𝑡′𝑗t[j,\\infty]=t^{\\prime}[j,\\infty], for some j∈ℕ𝑗ℕj\\in\\mathbb{N}. The collapse of two traces encoding distinct increments of the counter Clsubscript𝐶𝑙C_{l} then corresponds to the uncontrollable decrement of the counter values in lossy computations. Using the universal team quantifier 𝖠𝖠\\mathsf{A} we can forbid this effect, and encode non-lossy computations.\nThe proof of the following theorem can be found in Appendix B. Model checking for TeamLTL​(⊆,∨⃝,𝖠)TeamLTL∨⃝𝖠\\mathrm{TeamLTL}(\\subseteq,\\varovee,\\mathsf{A}) is Σ11superscriptsubscriptΣ11\\Sigma_{1}^{1}-hard. This holds already for the fragment with a single occurrence of 𝖠𝖠\\mathsf{A}. As is common in the LTLLTL\\mathrm{LTL}-setting, the model checking problem of TeamLTL​(⊆,∨⃝)TeamLTL∨⃝\\mathrm{TeamLTL}(\\subseteq,\\varovee) can be embedded in its satisfiability problem using auxiliary propositions and TeamLTL​(⊆,∨⃝)TeamLTL∨⃝\\mathrm{TeamLTL}(\\subseteq,\\varovee)-formulae.\nA formula φ𝜑\\varphi is satisfiable, if there exists a non-empty T𝑇T such that (T,0)⊧φmodels𝑇0𝜑(T,0)\\models\\varphi.\nWe thus obtain the following corollary, which is also proven in Appendix B. The satisfiability problems for TeamLTL​(⊆,∨⃝)TeamLTL∨⃝\\mathrm{TeamLTL}(\\subseteq,\\varovee) and TeamLTL​(⊆,∨⃝,𝖠)TeamLTL∨⃝𝖠\\mathrm{TeamLTL}(\\subseteq,\\varovee,\\mathsf{A}) are Σ10superscriptsubscriptΣ10\\Sigma_{1}^{0}-hard and Σ11superscriptsubscriptΣ11\\Sigma_{1}^{1}-hard, resp.\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: a labelling function, and w0∈Wsubscript𝑤0𝑊w_{0}\\in W an initial state of W𝑊W.\nA path σ𝜎\\sigma through KK\\mathrm{K} is an infinite sequence σ∈Wω𝜎superscript𝑊𝜔\\sigma\\in W^{\\omega} such that σ​[ref]0=w0𝜎delimited-[]0subscript𝑤0\\sigma[ref]0=w_{0} and (σ​[i],σ​[i+1])∈R𝜎delimited-[]𝑖𝜎delimited-[]𝑖1𝑅(\\sigma[i],\\sigma[i+1])\\in R for every i≥0𝑖0i\\geq 0.
