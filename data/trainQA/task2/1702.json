      "content": "Paper Title: Thermodynamic topology optimization including plasticity\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEngineers are always looking for structures that meet the specific requirements in an optimal way.\nOne possibility for finding these structures is provided by optimization schemes which are classified as follows: i) improving the principal idea, ii) modifying the material, iii) thickness dimensioning, iv) optimization of shape and v) optimization of topology  .\nHerein, the optimization scheme that demands the minimum amount of restrictions is given by topology optimization.\nThe consideration of the real materials properties offers additional potential for the optimal design of components.\nTherefore, it is important to account for the physical material behavior even during the process of topology optimization. There are various variants of topology optimization available as, e. g., the optimization for temperature evolution, noise reduction, dynamic response, or structural stiffness.\nAll of these approaches have in common that the related physical balance laws, in most cases the balance of linear momentum, are solved along with a mathematical optimization problem which is given in terms of an objective function.\nThe most common objective is the minimization of compliance, i. e. the maximization of stiffness according to a target structure volume .\nTherefore, topology optimization determines the position and arrangement of material within a given design space and boundary conditions such that the objective function is minimized.\nThe topology of a structure can be parameterized via different approaches during the specific numerical investigation.\nFor the numerical solution of the physical balance law, e. g., the balance of linear momentum, usually the finite element method (FEM) is employed.\nConsequently, the finite elements introduce a discretization of the design space, and it is thus most common to assign a density value for each discrete subvolume, i. e. for each finite element.\nFor this assignment, a variety of different numerical schemes has been developed among which the probably most popular is given by “Solid Material with Penalization” (SIMP) proposed by Bendsøe and Sigmund in  .\nThe fundamental idea of SIMP is the introduction of a non-linear interpolation function between void and full material such that a black and white design is aspired due to the inherent non-convex total potential.\nFurther popular developments are overviewed in  . In a series of papers, we aimed at contributing to the problem of topology optimization: by using thermodynamic extremal principles, evolutionary access to the problem of topology optimization has been presented for which we referred our method to as thermodynamic topology optimization (TTO).\nIt routes back to  while further important developments have been presented for the numerical treatment in  and for hyperelastic material in .\nThis topology optimization makes use of an extended Hamilton principle which is well-known in the context of material modeling, cf. .\nTherefore, the extended Hamilton functional is formulated and its stationarity conditions serve as update procedure for the evolution of the topology.\nIn this manner, no classical optimization problem is formulated.\nSince the free energy function is part of the extended Hamilton functional, the result is very similar to classical schemes for topology optimization .\nThe manipulation of topology is managed by the density as state variable which is defined for each discretized area.\nOne advantage of this thermodynamic topology optimization is that no further optimization algorithm is needed.\nIn contrast, the relative density is described by a transient partial differential equation (PDE) in which the local free energy density serves as source term.\nConsequently, the material optimization problem is converted to an evolutionary problem.\nThe field equation for the topology results from the stationary condition of the extended Hamilton functional.\nAdditionally, evaluation of the functional results in the field equations for displacement and internal (state) variable which accounts for the (local) microstructure of the material.\nFrom this follows that the extended Hamilton functional according to topology optimization also features to take any physically dissipative material behavior into account. In context of accounting for a real material behavior during the optimization, the plastic material behavior plays a major role which requires a thermodynamically and mathematically rigorous treatment due to its complexity.\nDirect access of plastic material behavior within topology optimization might be given by using classical plasticity models with the characteristic stress/strain diagram resulting in a hysteresis curve in cyclic loading.\nSeveral successful examples are provided in the literature: a first approach to account for a classical elasto-plastic material model within an adaptive material topology optimization was proposed by Maute et al. .\nApproaches to determine plasticity by homogenization strategies are also possible, cf. .\nThis is particularly interesting for plastic parts of composites .\nFurthermore, topology optimization based on finite strains can be considered for plasticity .\nNakshatrala and Tortorelli  optimize dynamically loaded structures while accounting for plastic material behavior.\nA different option was proposed by the consideration of damage, cf.  [ref]1.\nFor all such non-linear stress/strain relations, the optimization routine usually demands an additional algorithm for convergence.\nHere, one prominent possibility is provided by the “method of moving asymptotes” (MMA). Unfortunately, the strategy of considering physical material models usually renders such optimization rather time-consuming: due to the local path-dependence, the physical loading process needs to be discretized with several time steps each of which demands the solution of the physical finite element problem.\nThe nested finite element simulations for the physical process and the topology optimization problem demand a remarkably higher amount of computation time.\nTo compensate this drawback, several strategies can be found which aim to directly include plasticity into the optimization process: one approach is to couple an elastic model with local stress constraint as mentioned e. g. by    .\nAnother idea by Amir  is to define a single global stress constraint within the formulation of optimization problem to bypass the local calculation for each material point. Bruns et al.  propose to constrain the load-displacement by limit points in case of damage.\nAnother way is to account for the nonlinear material behavior on a second, microscopic scale by developing a new model reduction technique which is proposed by Fritzen et al.  and extended by Xia et al. .\nA special characteristic of this approach is the use of an evolutionary optimization method on the macroscopic scale.\nFurthermore, surrogate models have been developed which avoid the need of solving physical finite element problems.\nZhao et al.  , for instance, developed a surrogate model as a fictitious non-linear elastic material model which asymptotically approximates a perfect elasto-plastic behavior.\nThey accounted for the von Mises criterion in  and also developed an approach valid for the Drucker-Prager criterion in .\nDue to the absent path-dependence, the computation of the sensitivity is straight forward and only one finite element analysis needs to be computed for each iteration step.\nTherefore, this approach has a remarkable disadvantage that the resulting stress/strain curve matches the similar classical elasto-plastic curve even at a material point level only at the limit points.\nFurthermore, there is no possibility to compute the plastic strain tensor which serve as thermodynamic state variable. Hence, a topology optimization method accounting for plastic material behavior in a resource-efficient manner is missing.\nIn this contribution, we aim at expanding the thermodynamic topology optimization such that it can be applied to elasto-plastic materials with a novel 3D surrogate material model.\nTherefore, the surrogate model is based on a classical plastic material model whereby the mentioned disadvantages of non-linearity and path-dependence should be prevented by modifications resulting from the nature of optimization: we determine topology optimization results for the (maximal) external loading; unloading and cyclic load curves are not investigated here.\nDuring an evolutionary optimization process the topology and the resulting structural stiffness evolve, respectively.\nDifferently stiff structures loaded with the same external loading result in different displacement fields.\nTherefore, the displacement field also evolves during the optimization process.\nFor instance, high strains might be present in the beginning of the optimization process with associated high plastic strains.\nHowever, the evolution of local stiffness results in reduced strains and consequently reduced plastic strains.\nSince this “unloading” process does not correspond to the physical evolution of plastic strains but occurs due to the evolution of the topology optimization we denote for this as “virtual unloading”.\nFor a classical plasticity model, the virtual unloading evokes dissipation which results in the typical hysteresis curve.\nHowever, we are interested in a material model that computes the plastic strains for each displacement state as it results from physical loading.\nTherefore, the surrogate model must reflect the physically correct stress/strain curve during loading, i. e. without any effects due to virtual unloading – the unloading process must not correspond to the physical evolution of plastic strains.\nIn the case of virtual unloading the loading branch in the stress/strain curve needs to be followed backwards.\nTo this end, we propose a hysteresis-free behavior for the surrogate model by suppressing the dissipative character.\nFinally, this results in the following benefits of the surrogate model: i) the surrogate model matches the results of plastic material models at the material point level, ii) the physical state variable can be measured in terms of the plastic strain tensor and iii) the total number of finite element simulations can be reduced while the material behavior is still physically accurate.\nConsequently, our surrogate model in terms of the thermodynamic topology optimization allows finding optimal structures if plastic material behavior occurs.\n The paper is structured as follows: first, we recall the basics of the thermodynamic topology optimization by use of Hamilton’s principle and complement our previous approaches by the inclusion of plasticity.\nTo this end, we develop a surrogate material model for our topology optimization approach that accounts for plasticity without consideration of dissipation-related hysteresis effects.\nAfterwards we present a suitable strategy for numerical implementation.\nFinally, the functionality of the proposed approach is tested and analyzed by means of computing topology optimizations for several boundary value problems.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: plasticity .\nNakshatrala and Tortorelli  optimize dynamically loaded structures while accounting for plastic material behavior.\nA different option was proposed by the consideration of damage, cf.
