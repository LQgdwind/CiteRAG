      "content": "Paper Title: Regular Expressions with Backreferences on Multiple Context-Free Languages, and the Closed-Star Condition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBackreference, an extension of regular expressions, is widely spread in the practical world. Most modern regular expression engines, such as those in the standard libraries of Java, Python, JavaScript and more, support the backreference extension. A difficulty of backreference is that it substantially increases the expressive power of regular expressions. Let α𝛼\\alpha be the rewb (1(a+b)∗)1\\1(_{1}(a+b)^{\\ast})_{1}\\,\\backslash 1 over the alphabet {a,b}𝑎𝑏\\left\\{a,b\\right\\}, for instance. The language L​(α)𝐿𝛼L(\\alpha) of α𝛼\\alpha is the copy language {w​w|w∈{a,b}∗}conditional-set𝑤𝑤𝑤superscript𝑎𝑏∗\\left\\{\\left.ww\\,\\vphantom{w\\in\\left\\{a,b\\right\\}^{\\ast}}\\right|\\,w\\in\\left\\{a,b\\right\\}^{\\ast}\\right\\}, a typical example of a non-context-free language. Intuitively, the subexpression \\1\\absent1\\backslash 1 matches only the string matched by (a+b)∗superscript𝑎𝑏∗(a+b)^{\\ast}, the subexpression in the preceding 111-indexed capturing group. We rephrase this behavior as follows: \\1\\absent1\\backslash 1 backreferences the string captured in (1(a+b)∗)1(_{1}(a+b)^{\\ast})_{1}. In this manner, backreference can assert equality constraints on the substrings of a matching string.\nThus, we reach the following natural question: how powerful is backreference? In prior study, Câmpeanu et al. , and Berglund and van der Merwe  showed that the language class of rewbs is a proper subclass of context-sensitive languages (CSL), but is incomparable with the class of context-free languages (CFL). Our recent study  showed that the language class of rewbs is a proper subclass of indexed languages (IL) but not a subclass of stack languages (SL), which was proposed by Ginsburg et al.   and properly sits between the classes of CFLs and ILs  1. Note that Aho, who invented ILs, has shown that IL⊊CSLILCSL\\text{IL}\\subsetneq\\text{CSL} . We investigate the expressive power of rewbs relative to those of multiple context-free languages (MCFL) and parallel multiple context-free languages (PMCFL) proposed by Seki et al. [ref]36 as the language classes of multiple context-free grammars (MCFG) and parallel multiple context-free grammars (PMCFG), respectively.\nAs for the expressive powers of MCFG and PMCFG, Seki et al. [ref]36 showed the inclusions CFL⊊MCFL⊊PMCFL⊊CSLCFLMCFLPMCFLCSL\\text{CFL}\\subsetneq\\text{MCFL}\\subsetneq\\text{PMCFL}\\subsetneq\\text{CSL}. Moreover, Nishida and Seki 8 showed that a special subclass of PMCFLs, unary-PMCFLs, is equivalent to the language class of EDT0L systems.111See  4 for the definition of EDT0L systems. We first show that the class of unary-PMCFLs, and hence that of EDT0L languages, contains the language class of rewbs by constructing a unary-PMCFG Gαsubscript𝐺𝛼G_{\\alpha} equivalent to an arbitrary given rewb α𝛼\\alpha.\nSince Ehrenfeucht et al. 2 have shown that the class of EDT0L languages is properly contained in that of ILs, this result strictly improves the best known upper bound of rewbs.222Actually, one can show from the results of   that NL, the class of languages that are decidable by nondeterministic log-space Turing machines, also contains the language class of rewbs. As noted in , (1) NL⊈ILnot-subset-of-nor-equalsNLIL\\text{NL}\\nsubseteq\\text{IL} and (2) IL⊈NLnot-subset-of-nor-equalsILNL\\text{IL}\\nsubseteq\\text{NL} unless NL=NPNLNP\\text{NL}=\\text{NP}. Our result is strictly better than both IL and NL because of the fact (1) above and the fact that EDT0L⊆NLEDT0LNL\\text{EDT0L}\\subseteq\\text{NL} as shown by Jones and Skyum 4.\nAdditionally, as the class of EDT0L languages is incomparable with that of CFLs 1, we obtain the first upper bound of rewbs not containing CFLs. Notable in our construction is that the parallelism of PMCFG plays a vital role. In fact, we show a simple rewb with only one capturing group and no captured references333A captured reference is, as its name would suggest, a reference \\i\\absent𝑖\\backslash i inside a capturing group (j)j(_{j}\\;)_{j} . that describes a non-MCFL using a pumping lemma for MCFL. Therefore, the language class of rewbs and the class of MCFLs are incomparable.\nThe fact that this rewb has no captured reference is significant because, as shown by , the language class of rewbs without captured references is contained in that of nonerasing stack languages (NESL), also proposed in the original paper of SL  and known as a proper subclass of SLs  1.\nFurthermore, motivated by these results, we propose a novel syntactic variant of rewbs that we call closed-star rewbs. Intuitively, being closed-star means that no looping subexpression can backreference strings captured outside the loop. For example, ((1(a+b)∗)1c\\1)∗((_{1}(a+b)^{\\ast})_{1}\\,c\\,\\backslash 1)^{\\ast} is closed-star, whereas a simple example of a non-closed-star rewb is (1a∗)1(c\\1)∗(_{1}a^{\\ast})_{1}(c\\backslash 1)^{\\ast} which also happens to describe a non-MCFL (cf. Theorem 3.8). As we shall show, a closed-star rewb has the property that we can compute an upper bound on the number of times the rewb references the same captured string. We use this property of the closed-star condition to prove that every closed-star rewb describes a unary-MCFL.\nNote that Kanazawa and Salvati have shown that the language class of unary-MCFGs is equivalent to that of EDT0L systems of finite index 6.\nMoreover, we also show that every closed-star rewb describes an NESL. The two inclusions show the robustness of the closed-star condition.\nBelow, we list the main contributions of the paper:\n{alphaenumerate} Every rewb describes a unary-PMCFL (Theorem 3.1). There exists a rewb with only one capturing group and no captured references that describes a non-MCFL (Theorem 3.8). A novel syntactic variant of closed-star rewbs (Definition 4.1). Every closed-star rewb describes a unary-MCFL (Theorem 4.2). Every closed-star rewb describes an NESL (Theorem 5.1).\n\nAdditionally, it follows by (b) and (d) that the language class of closed-star rewbs is a proper subclass of rewbs (Corollary 4.4).\nAs remarked above, we have recently shown that the language class of rewbs is not contained in SL and that of rewbs with no captured references is a proper subclass of NESLs . From these results, it follows by (a) and (b) that unary-PMCFL is not contained in SL and NESL is not contained in MCFL, respectively (Corollary 3.9).\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents formal definitions of rewbs, MCFLs and PMCFLs. In Sections 3, 4 and 5, we prove the main contributions listed above. Section 6 discusses related work. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper.\nOmitted proofs are in the appendix.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: We investigate the expressive power of rewbs relative to those of multiple context-free languages (MCFL) and parallel multiple context-free languages (PMCFL) proposed by Seki et al. [ref]36 as the language classes of multiple context-free grammars (MCFG) and parallel multiple context-free grammars (PMCFG), respectively.\nAs for the expressive powers of MCFG and PMCFG, Seki et\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
