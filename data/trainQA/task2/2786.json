      "content": "Paper Title: Collective eXplainable AI: Explaining Cooperative Strategies and Agent Contribution in Multiagent Reinforcement Learning with Shapley Values\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOver the last few years, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been a very active research field. Many RL-related works focused on improving performance and scaling capabilities by introducing new algorithms and optimizers [ref]1 [ref]2\nwhereas very few tackled the issue of explainability in RL. However, explainability in Machine Learning (ML) and deep learning is increasingly becoming a pressing issue, as it concerns general public trust, and the transparency of algorithms now conditions the deployment of and ML and RL, in industry and daily life. As a consequence, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) arises as a new field that strives to bring explainability to every ML aspect, from linear classifiers  and time series predictors  [ref]5 to RL  . Even though some works provide explanations for specific situations  , RL models still lack a general explainability framework similar to SHAP  or LIME . These methods, although designed in XAI towards generic ML predictive models, can bring a broader form of explainability to RL. In this work, inspired by SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) , the possibilities offered by the mathematical framework of Shapley values  to explain RL models were explored, with a focus on multi-agent cooperative environments, often called Common Games. As a kind of collaborative RL, the improvement of the learning process when agents interact with each other, usually yields better results than training each agent in isolation . These are challenging scenarios where all participants must cooperate in order to achieve a common goal. In the particular case where agents must gather resources from a common pool without being greedy, Garrett Hardin  defined The Tragedy of the Commons: if an agent uses slightly more resources than it should, this might be inconsequential. However, if every agent starts following this logic then the consequences can become dire, with the common pool being exhausted and no one being able to gather resources anymore. This is why the Common Games are of special interest to study in this context. The objective is finding ways to evaluate and understand how agents cooperate and share resources in multiagent RL, through explainability methods such as SHAP. As a matter of fact, this work could have implications that go beyond games, since RL-based systems are increasingly used to solve critical problems. In particular, studying social dilemmas and explaining the contribution of each policy , agent, or model feature becomes relevant in many societal problems. For instance, it could provide useful insights in economics (of social structures), allocating resources or designing resilience programs (e.g., for climate change, non-discriminatory decision making, ethical and fair policy design, or to achieve the sustainable development goals). Our main hypothesis is that Shapley values can be a pertinent way to explain the contribution of an agent in multi-agent RL cooperative settings, and that valuable insights, especially for the RL developer audience, can be derived from this analysis.\nThis article features experiments (see Section V) conducted on Multiagent Particle  and Sequential Social Dilemma  environments, and shows that Shapley values can accurately answer the following research questions: Can Shapley values be used to determine how much each agent contributes to the global reward? (RQ1). If the answer to RQ1 is yes:\n Does the proposed Monte Carlo based algorithm empirically offer a good approximation of Shapley values? (RQ2) What is the best method to replace an agent missing from the coalition (e.g., a random action, am action chosen randomly from another player or the “no operation” action)? (RQ3) Our experimental setup is brought forward as well in order to show the limitations of the Shapley framework in order to make deep RL more explainable. In fact, this approach cannot explain particular notions of a multi-agent learning model, such as the contribution of a specific episode or a specific action taken by an agent at a given point in time of its training. This is due to the\nrequirements inherent to training multi-agent RL, and the practical design limitations of the Shapley framework, which are brought upfront. In particular, as discussed in Section IV, Shapley values only yield an average metric of each player’s contribution to the overall reward and thus, to obtain this average contribution metric, one must compare the cooperation of players during several games (or episodes in RL). However, due to the frequently stochastic nature of (simulation and real RL) environments, the non-deterministic behaviour of different agents or non-identical conditions –non inherent to the agent’s policy at consideration–, it makes concrete episodes, or concrete actions within an episode, not comparable. This article presents the following contributions: A study of the mathematical notion of Shapley values and how it is able to provide quantitative explanations about the individual contribution of agents in a cooperative multi-agent RL environment. The application of an XAI global model-agnostic method to explain multi-agent cooperative RL models using Monte Carlo (MC) approximated Shapley values. A set of experiments that demonstrates the applicability and usefulness of Shapley values and how they can provide insights that can enable a better comprehension of emergent behaviours  in cooperative settings. The rest of this article is structured as follows: Section II presents a short survey on cooperative multi-agent RL and explainable RL, Section III presents some preliminaries about RL and Shapley values, Section VI discusses the experimental study setup and the general usage of Shapley values in a multi-agent RL setting and, finally, Section VII presents conclusions on our carried out experiments and gives some insights on promising lines of future work.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: years, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been a very active research field.
