      "content": "Paper Title: Scalable Teacher Forcing Network for Semi-Supervised Large Scale Data Streams\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe concept of evolving fuzzy system (EFS) is developed as a way to cope with the data stream problem where the key idea lies in the combination of parameter learning and structural learning under a single training phase. It enables fuzzy rules to be automatically constructed on the fly while performing a single-pass model update. It makes use of the local property of fuzzy rule where an online clustering technique can be benefited for automatic fuzzy rule generation while the rule consequent is updated using a local learning technique via the fuzzily weighted recursive least square (FWRLS) method. EFS does not utilize the evolutionary computing techniques for fuzzy rule construction   . This research area has started in the early 2000 where a pioneering work is proposed in  introducing the concept of incremental unsupervised learning. Another early work is proposed in  using the evolving clustering method (ECM) for online identification of fuzzy rules. evolving takagi sugeno (eTS) is proposed in  with the concept of rule potential being an evolving version of mountain clustering method.  is extended for classification problem in  and termed evolving classifier (eClass). EFS has grown rapidly where a high number of works have been proposed in the literature. Recent survey of this area can be found in . The area of EFS has been extended from a single model to an ensemble model in  using eTS as a base classifier. Nevertheless, this work is designed under a static ensemble structure which does not adapt to concept drifts of data streams. Parsimonious Ensemble (pENsemble) is proposed in  to address data stream classification problems. pENsemble features a fully flexible structure where the ensemble structure generation is automated using the drift detection method and the ensemble pruning mechanism while a base learner makes use of parsimonious classifier (pClass) having a self-evolving network structure . pENsemble+ is proposed in  where it extends pENsemble with an online active learning method and an ensemble merging mechanism for online tool condition monitoring problem. Recently, another variant of evolving ensemble fuzzy neural network is proposed in  putting forward the idea of online bagging for ensemble construction. The concept of ensemble classifier can be implemented using the stacked generalization principle making possible to configure an ensemble classifier in a deep structure. Such EFS work is realized in  where it utilizes evolving stochastic configuration network (eSCN) as a base learner while the network depth is adjustable using a drift detection technique. This work is generalized in  using the feature augmentation technique for construction of deep neuro fuzzy structure. The data stream problem has also attracted research attention from the deep learning community. In , the idea of autonomous deep learning (ADL) is proposed where it offers a self-evolving deep neural network under a different-depth network structure. In , similar concept is proposed but it is developed from the framework of multi-layer perceptron network rather than the different-depth network structure. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is put forward in  to cope with the problem of data streams. The self-evolving concept is introduced in a single-layer denoising autoencoder (DAE)  extending the incremental feature learning concept in [ref]44. The concept of hedge back-propagation is proposed in  to address the data stream problem using the different-depth network structure. In , the internet traffic classification problem is solved using the multi-layer perceptron network. Although various solutions have been proposed to tackle the data stream problem, the vast majority of these works are not designed to cope with the large-scale data stream problem calling for distributed computing strategy to expedite the execution time. Note that the large-scale data stream problem differs from the conventional big data problem because it involves continuous information flow. A scalable PANFIS algorithm is proposed in  in which it implements PANFIS in  under the distributed computing of Apache Spark and develops a model fusion technique. Nevertheless, Scalable PANFIS has not addressed the problem of continual data streams where data batches stream continuously. It is also not yet evaluated in the prequential test-then-train protocol as a standard evaluation procedure of data stream algorithms . In , a scalable teacher forcing network (ScatterNet) is proposed to overcome the bottlenecks of scalable PANFIS. It proposes a flexible ensemble classifier built upon a teacher-forcing fuzzy classifier and implemented under the distributed computing platform of Apache spark. Nevertheless, ScatterNet is a fully supervised algorithm imposing expensive labelling cost in the large-scale data stream environments. This issue requires an innovative algorithm handling the large-scale data stream problem under semi-supervised setting.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: put forward in  to cope with the problem of data streams.
