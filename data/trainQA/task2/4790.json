To overcome the limit of 1–WL, a new GNN model is introduced in , where node identities are directly injected into the Weisfeiler-Lehman aggregate functions.\nIn , the k-WL test has been taken into account to develop a more powerful GNN model, given its greater capability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs.\nIn [ref]28, a simplicial-wise Weisfeiler-Lehman test is introduced, and it is proven to be strictly more powerful than the 1-WL test and not less powerful than the 3-WL test; a similar test (called cellular WL test) proposed by [ref]29 is proven to be actually more powerful than the simplicial version.\nNevertheless, all this proposed tests do not deal with edge-attributed graphs, certainly not with dynamic graphs. Moreover, the WL test mechanism applied to GNNs has been also studied within the paradigm of unfolding trees (,  ). However, only recently it has been established an equivalence between the two concepts by [ref]23, and still, it is limited to static graphs without edge attributes. By a theoretical point of view, several approaches have been carried out to study the approximation and generalization properties of graph neural networks. In , the authors proved the universal approximation properties of the original graph neural network model, modulo the unfolding equivalence. Universal approximation is shown for GNNs with random node initialization in  while, in , GNNs are shown to be able to encode any graph with countable input features. Moreover, the authors of  proved that GNNs, provided with a colored local iterative procedure (CLIP), can be universal approximators for functions on graphs with node attributes.\nThe approximation property has been extended also to Folklore Graph Neural Networks in  and to Linear Graph Neural Networks and general GNNs in  , both in the invariant and equivariant case. Recently, the universal approximation theorem has been proved for modern message passing graph neural networks by [ref]23.\nDespite the availability of universal approximation theorems for static graphs with node attributes, the theory lacks results about approximation capability of other types of graphs such as dynamic graphs and graphs with attributes on both nodes and edges. \nThe aim of this paper, is that of extending the results on the expressive power\nof GNNs for dynamic graphs\nand SAUHGs with node and edge attributes.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: the Weisfeiler-Lehman aggregate functions.\nIn , the k-WL test has been taken into account to develop a more powerful GNN model, given its greater capability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs.\nIn [ref]28, a simplicial-wise Weisfeiler-Lehman test is introduced, and it is proven to be strictly more powerful than the 1-WL test and not less powerful than the 3-WL test; a similar test (called\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
