      "content": "Paper Title: An Overview of Privacy in Machine Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe state-of-the-art method for providing access to information free from inferences is to satisfy differential privacy (DP)¬†.\nThis applies to ML as well, and more precisely to providing access to models that have been trained on (sensitive) datasets¬†  [ref]50 [ref]43 [ref]46.\nMore precisely, there are two main privacy-preserving model-training approaches in literature: 1) using noisy stochastic gradient descent (noisy SGD)¬†, and 2) Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE)¬†[ref]43 [ref]46. Noisy SGD. As mentioned in Section¬†2.1, ML models are often used trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The intuition is to add noise to the SGD process; however, the main challenge is to do so while ensuring that the noise is carefully calibrated.\nThe sensitivity of the final value of Œ∏ùúÉ\\theta (the parameter vector) to the elements of the training data is generally hard to analyze.\nOn the other hand, since the training data affects Œ∏ùúÉ\\theta only via the gradient computations, one may achieve privacy by bounding gradients (by clipping) and by adding noise to those computations.\nIn a nutshell, this is the idea behind the seminal work by Abadi et al.¬†, in particular in the accounting of the privacy loss, and hence it is general referred to as the Moments Accountant algorithm. PATE. To protect the privacy of training data during learning, PATE transfers knowledge from an ensemble of ‚Äúteacher‚Äù models trained on partitions of the data to a ‚Äústudent‚Äù model; see Figure¬†7.\nIntuitively, privacy is provided by training teachers on disjoint data, and strong guarantees stem from noisy aggregation of teachers‚Äô answers. Collaborative Learning.\nIn the collaborative learning setting, Shokri and Shmatikov¬†[ref]50 support distributed training of deep learning networks in a privacy-preserving way.\nSpecifically, their system relies on the input of independent entities which aim to collaboratively build a machine learning model without sharing their training data.\nTo this end, they selectively share subsets of noisy model parameters during training.\nMoreover, federated learning proposals, which have already mentioned, tackle the problem of training deep learning models with differential privacy guarantees for the tasks of training language models¬† and digits classification¬†0.\n\nReference markers found: [50]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]50: free from inferences is to satisfy differential privacy (DP)¬†.\nThis applies to ML as well, and more precisely to providing access to models that have been trained on (sensitive) datasets¬†  [ref]50 [ref]43 [ref]46.\nMore precisely, there are two main privacy-preserving model-training approaches in literature: 1) using noisy stochastic gradient descent (noisy SGD)¬†, and 2) Private\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
