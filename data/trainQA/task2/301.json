      "content": "Paper Title: Oscar: Object-Semantics Aligned Pre-training for Vision-Language Tasks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAnderson et al.   introduce the bottom-up mechanism to represent an image as a set of visual regions via Faster R-CNN 8, each with an associated feature vector. It enables attention to be computed at the object level, and has quickly become the de facto standard for fine-grained image understanding tasks. In this paper, we propose to use object tags to align the object-region features in  in the pre-trained linguistic semantic space. The idea of utilizing object tags has been explored for image understanding [ref]42  . Based on grid-wise region features of CNNs, Wu et al.  [ref]42 employ the predicted object tags only as the input to LSTM for image captioning, while You et al.   consider both tags and region features. Based on salient regions proposed by object detectors, Zhou et al.   concatenate the object prediction probability vector with region features as the visual input for VLP. Unfortunately, the tags in these works are not simultaneously associated with both object regions and word embeddings of text, resulting in a lack of grounding. Our construction of object tags with their corresponding region features & word embeddings yields more complete and informative representations for objects, particularly when the linguistic entity embeddings are pre-trained, as described next.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: paper, we propose to use object tags to align the object-region features in  in the pre-trained linguistic semantic space.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
