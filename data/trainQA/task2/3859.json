      "content": "Paper Title: Domain Adaptation meets Individual Fairness. And they get along.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the transductive setting, we are only concerned with the accuracy of the predictions on the unlabeled samples from the target domain in the training data. The distribution of unlabeled samples is different from the (marginal) distribution of features in the source domain due to covariate shift.\nThus, the problem is similar to that of extrapolation/label propagation in which we wish to propagate the labels/signal from the labeled samples in the source domain to the unlabeled samples in the target domain.\nTowards this goal, we leverage the (labeled) source and (unlabeled) target samples and the inductive bias on the smoothness of the regression function.\nWe encode this inductive bias in a regularizer ℛℛ\\mathcal{R} and solve the following regularized risk minimization problem where ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} is the model class, ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} is a loss function, and λ>0𝜆0\\lambda>0 is a regularization parameter.\nIn the transductive setting, the regularizer ℛnsubscriptℛ𝑛\\mathcal{R}_{n} is a function of the vector of model outputs on the source and target inputs:\nf​(X)≜[f​(Xs)⊤,f​(Xt)⊤]⊤≜𝑓𝑋superscriptmatrix𝑓superscriptsubscript𝑋𝑠top𝑓superscriptsubscript𝑋𝑡toptopf(X)\\triangleq\\begin{bmatrix}f(X_{s})^{\\top},f(X_{t})^{\\top}\\end{bmatrix}^{\\top}, where f​(Xs)∈𝐑ns𝑓subscript𝑋𝑠superscript𝐑subscript𝑛𝑠f(X_{s})\\in{\\mathbf{R}}^{n_{s}} (resp. f​(Xt)∈𝐑nt𝑓subscript𝑋𝑡superscript𝐑subscript𝑛𝑡f(X_{t})\\in{\\mathbf{R}}^{n_{t}}) is the vector of outputs on the source (resp. target) inputs.\nIntuitively, the regularizer enforces invariance/smoothness of the model outputs on the source and target inputs. A concrete example of a such a regularizer is the graph Laplacian regularizer.\nA graph Laplacian regularizer is based on a similarity symmetric kernel K𝐾K on the input space 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}.\nFor example, Petersen et al. [ref]9 take kernel K𝐾K to be a decreasing function of a fair metric that is learned from data , e.g., a metric in which the distance between male and female biographies with similar relevant content is small.\nIn domain adaptation, a similar intuition can be applied.\nFor example, suppose the source train data consists of Poodle dogs and Persian cats (the task is to distinguish cats and dogs), and the target data consists of Dalmatians and Siamese cats [ref]19.\nThen, a meaningful metric for constructing kernel K𝐾K assigns small distances to different breeds of the same species. Given the kernel, we construct the similarity matrix 𝐊=[K​(Xi,Xj)]i,j=1n𝐊superscriptsubscriptmatrix𝐾subscript𝑋𝑖subscript𝑋𝑗𝑖𝑗1𝑛\\mathbf{K}=\\begin{bmatrix}K\\left(X_{i},X_{j}\\right)\\end{bmatrix}_{i,j=1}^{n}. Note that, here, we are considering all the source and target covariates together. Based on the similarity matrix, the (unnormalized) Laplacian matrix is defined as 𝐋=𝐃−𝐊𝐋𝐃𝐊\\mathbf{L}=\\mathbf{D}-\\mathbf{K}\nwhere 𝐃𝐃\\mathbf{D} is a diagonal matrix with 𝐃i,i=∑jK​(Xi,Xj)subscript𝐃𝑖𝑖subscript𝑗𝐾subscript𝑋𝑖subscript𝑋𝑗\\mathbf{D}_{i,i}=\\sum_{j}K(X_{i},X_{j}), which is often denoted as the degree of the it​hsuperscript𝑖𝑡ℎi^{th} observation. There are also other ways of defining 𝐋𝐋\\mathbf{L} (e.g., 𝐋=𝐃−1/2​𝐊𝐃−1/2𝐋superscript𝐃12superscript𝐊𝐃12\\mathbf{L}=\\mathbf{D}^{-1/2}\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{D}^{-1/2} or 𝐋=𝐈−𝐃−1​𝐊𝐋𝐈superscript𝐃1𝐊\\mathbf{L}=\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{D}^{-1}\\mathbf{K}) which would also lead to the similar conclusion, but we stick to unnormalized Laplacian for the ease of exposition.\nBased on the Laplacian matrix 𝐋𝐋\\mathbf{L}, we define the graph Laplacian regularizer ℛℛ\\mathcal{R} as: The above regularizer enforces that if K​(Xi,Xj)𝐾subscript𝑋𝑖subscript𝑋𝑗K(X_{i},X_{j}) is large for a pair (Xi,Xj)subscript𝑋𝑖subscript𝑋𝑗(X_{i},X_{j}) (i.e., they are similar), f​(Xi)𝑓subscript𝑋𝑖f(X_{i}) must be close to f​(Xj)𝑓subscript𝑋𝑗f(X_{j}).\nAs mentioned earlier, for individual fairness, K​(Xi,Xj)𝐾subscript𝑋𝑖subscript𝑋𝑗K(X_{i},X_{j}) is chosen to be a monotonically decreasing function of dfair​(Xi,Xj)subscript𝑑fairsubscript𝑋𝑖subscript𝑋𝑗d_{\\text{fair}}(X_{i},X_{j}), which ensures that f​(Xi)𝑓subscript𝑋𝑖f(X_{i}) and f​(Xj)𝑓subscript𝑋𝑗f(X_{j}) are close to each other when Xisubscript𝑋𝑖X_{i} is close to Xjsubscript𝑋𝑗X_{j} with respect to the fair metric (for more details, see Petersen et al. [ref]9).\nRecently, Lahoti et al. , Kang et al. , and Petersen et al. [ref]9 used the graph Laplacian regularizer to post-process ML models so that they are individually fair.\nThis is also widely used in semi-supervised learning to leverage unlabeled samples . We focus on problems in which the model class ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} is mis-specified, i.e., f0∉ℱsubscript𝑓0ℱf_{0}\\notin\\mathcal{F}.\nIf the model is well-specified (i.e., f0∈ℱsubscript𝑓0ℱf_{0}\\in\\mathcal{F}), the optimal prediction rule in the training and target domains are identical (both are f0subscript𝑓0f_{0}).\nIt is possible to learn the optimal prediction rule for the target domain from the training domain (e.g., by empirical risk minimization (ERM)), and there is no need to adapt models trained in the source domain to the target.\nOn the other hand, if the model is mis-specified, the transfer learning task is non-trivial because the optimal prediction rule model depends on the distribution of the inputs (which differ in training and target domains).\nHere, we focus on the non-trivial case. We show that, as long as f0subscript𝑓0f_{0} satisfies the smoothness structure enforced by the regularizer, f^^𝑓\\widehat{f} from (2.3) remains accurate at the target inputs {xt,i}i=1ntsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑥𝑡𝑖𝑖1subscript𝑛𝑡\\{x_{t,i}\\}_{i=1}^{n_{t}}.\nFirst, we state our assumptions on the loss function ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} and the regularizer ℛnsubscriptℛ𝑛\\mathcal{R}_{n}. We assume that the regression function is smooth with respect to the penalty ℛnsubscriptℛ𝑛\\mathcal{R}_{n}, i.e., ℛn​(f0​(X))≤δsubscriptℛ𝑛subscript𝑓0𝑋𝛿\\mathcal{R}_{n}(f_{0}(X))\\leq\\delta for some small δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0. This is an assumption on the effect of the smoothness structure enforced by the regularizer being in agreement with the regression function f0subscript𝑓0f_{0}. We assume that ℛℛ\\mathcal{R} is μℛnntsubscript𝜇subscriptℛ𝑛subscript𝑛𝑡\\frac{\\mu_{\\mathcal{R}_{n}}}{n_{t}}-strongly convex with respect to the model outputs on the target inputs and Lℛnnsubscript𝐿subscriptℛ𝑛𝑛\\frac{L_{\\mathcal{R}_{n}}}{n}-strongly smooth.\nMore specifically, for v1∈𝐑ns,v2,v∈𝐑nt,v~,v0∈𝐑nformulae-sequencesubscript𝑣1superscript𝐑subscript𝑛𝑠subscript𝑣2formulae-sequence𝑣superscript𝐑subscript𝑛𝑡~𝑣subscript𝑣0superscript𝐑𝑛v_{1}\\in{\\mathbf{R}}^{n_{s}},v_{2},v\\in{\\mathbf{R}}^{n_{t}},\\tilde{v},v_{0}\\in{\\mathbf{R}}^{n} This is a regularity assumption on the regularizer to ensure the extrapolation map yt:𝐑ns→𝐑nt:subscript𝑦𝑡→superscript𝐑subscript𝑛𝑠superscript𝐑subscript𝑛𝑡y_{t}:{\\mathbf{R}}^{n_{s}}\\to{\\mathbf{R}}^{n_{t}} is well-behaved.\nIntuitively, the extrapolation map extrapolates (hence its name) model outputs on the source domain to the target domain in the smoothest possible way.\nNext, we state our assumptions on the loss function: The loss function ℒ:𝐑×𝐑→𝐑+:ℒ→𝐑𝐑subscript𝐑\\mathcal{L}:{\\mathbf{R}}\\times{\\mathbf{R}}\\to{\\mathbf{R}}_{+} satisfies ℒ​(a,b)≥0ℒ𝑎𝑏0\\mathcal{L}(a,b)\\geq 0 and =0absent0=0 if and only if a=b𝑎𝑏a=b.\nFurthermore, it is μℒsubscript𝜇ℒ\\mu_{\\mathcal{L}} - strongly convex and Lℒsubscript𝐿ℒL_{\\mathcal{L}} - strongly smooth, i.e., Assumption 2.3 is standard in learning theory, which provides us control over the curvature of the loss function. Suppose f^^𝑓\\hat{f} is the estimated function obtained from (2.3).\nUnder Assumption 2.3 on the loss function and Assumptions 2.1 and 2.2 on the regularizer, we have the following bound on the risk in the target domain: where with ρn=ns/ntsubscript𝜌𝑛subscript𝑛𝑠subscript𝑛𝑡\\rho_{n}=n_{s}/n_{t}. We note that the right side of (2.5) does not depend on the yi,ssubscript𝑦𝑖𝑠y_{i,s}’s in the target domain.\nIntuitively, Theorem 2.4 guarantees the accuracy of f^^𝑓\\widehat{f} on the inputs from the target domain as long as the following conditions hold. The model class ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} is rich enough to include an f𝑓f that is not only accurate on the training domain, but also satisfies the smoothness/invariance conditions enforced by the regularizer.\nThis implies the first term on the right side of (2.5) is small. The exact relation between inputs and outputs encoded in f0subscript𝑓0f_{0} satisfies the smoothness structure enforced by the regularizer.\nThis implies the second term on the right side of (2.5) is small. If the model is correctly specified (f0∈ℱsubscript𝑓0ℱf_{0}\\in\\mathcal{F}) and the regression function perfectly satisfies the smoothness conditions enforced by the regularizer (ℛn​(f0)=0subscriptℛ𝑛subscript𝑓00\\mathcal{R}_{n}(f_{0})=0), then the bias term vanishes.\nIn other words, Theorem 2.4 is adaptive to correctly specified model classes. Example: Laplacian regularizer We now show that the graph Laplacian regularizer satisfies Assumption 2.2.\nAs ℛn​(f​(X))subscriptℛ𝑛𝑓𝑋\\mathcal{R}_{n}(f(X)) is a quadratic function of 𝐋𝐋\\mathbf{L}, it is immediate that n​∇2ℛn​(f​(X))=𝐋𝑛superscript∇2subscriptℛ𝑛𝑓𝑋𝐋n\\nabla^{2}\\mathcal{R}_{n}(f(X))=\\mathbf{L}.\nTherefore, the strong convexity and smoothness of ℛℛ\\mathcal{R} depend on the behavior of the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of 𝐋𝐋\\mathbf{L}.\nThe maximum eigenvalue of 𝐋𝐋\\mathbf{L} is bounded above for the fixed design, which plays the role of Lℒ/2subscript𝐿ℒ2L_{\\mathcal{L}}/2 in Assumption 2.2.\nFor the lower bound, we note that we only assume strong convexity with respect to the target samples fixing the source samples.\nIf we divide the whole Laplacian matrix into four blocks, then the value of the regularizer in terms of these blocks will be: Therefore, the Hessian of ℛnsubscriptℛ𝑛\\mathcal{R}_{n} with respect to the model outputs in the target domain is 𝐋T​Tsubscript𝐋𝑇𝑇\\mathbf{L}_{TT} whose minimum eigenvalue is bounded away from 0 as long as the graph is connected, i.e., source inputs have a degree of similarity with target inputs.\nThus, ℛnsubscriptℛ𝑛\\mathcal{R}_{n} satisfies Assumption 2.2. Graph Laplacian regularizer is often used to achieve individual fairness   [ref]9 and our Theorem 2.4 shows that it can also be used for domain adaptation. We further verify this empirically in Section 2.4. To keep things simple, we focus on the case in which the loss function is quadratic (ℒ​(x,y)=12​(x−y)2ℒ𝑥𝑦12superscript𝑥𝑦2\\mathcal{L}(x,y)=\\frac{1}{2}(x-y)^{2}). We have The first term depends on the smoothness of the model outputs across the source and target domain f^​(X)^𝑓𝑋\\widehat{f}(X):\nit measures the discrepancy between the model outputs in the target domain f​(Xt)𝑓subscript𝑋𝑡f(X_{t}) and the smoothest extrapolation of the model outputs in the source domain to the target domain yt∗​(f​(Xs))superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑡𝑓subscript𝑋𝑠y_{t}^{*}(f(X_{s})).\nSimilarly, the third term depends on the smoothness of the regression function (across the source and target domains).\nIn Appendix B.1, we bound the two terms with ℛ​(f^​(X))ℛ^𝑓𝑋\\mathcal{R}(\\widehat{f}(X)) and ℛ​(f0​(X))ℛsubscript𝑓0𝑋\\mathcal{R}(f_{0}(X)). It remains to bound the second term in (2.7).\nIntuitively, stability of the extrapolation map (2.4) implies the extrapolation operation is similar to a projection onto smooth functions, so the second term satisfies\n  12​nt​‖yt∗​(f^​(Xs))−yt∗​(f0​(Xs))‖22≲12​ns​‖f^​(Xs)−f0​(Xs)‖22.less-than-or-similar-to12subscript𝑛𝑡superscriptsubscriptnormsuperscriptsubscript𝑦𝑡^𝑓subscript𝑋𝑠superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑡subscript𝑓0subscript𝑋𝑠2212subscript𝑛𝑠superscriptsubscriptnorm^𝑓subscript𝑋𝑠subscript𝑓0subscript𝑋𝑠22\\frac{1}{2n_{t}}\\|y_{t}^{*}(\\widehat{f}(X_{s}))-y_{t}^{*}(f_{0}(X_{s}))\\|_{2}^{2}\\lesssim\\frac{1}{2n_{s}}\\|\\widehat{f}(X_{s})-f_{0}(X_{s})\\|_{2}^{2}.  \nSee Appendix B.1.\n∎\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: of a such a regularizer is the graph Laplacian regularizer.\nA graph Laplacian regularizer is based on a similarity symmetric kernel K𝐾K on the input space 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}.\nFor example, Petersen et al. [ref]9 take kernel K𝐾K to be a decreasing function of a fair metric that is learned from data , e.g., a metric in which the distance between male and female biographies with similar relevant content\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
