      "content": "Paper Title: Abstract\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhen a machine learning system is used in high-risk environments, such as medicine and autonomous driving, a well-calibrated estimate of the uncertainty is necessary.\nA model is said to be calibrated [ref]1 if the confidence of its predictions reflects its true probability of being correct.\nHowever, deep neural networks tend to be overconfident in their predictions [ref]1 leading to multiple recent approaches attempting to improve their calibration  [ref]3. Furthermore, models need to be robust to shifts in the data domain, which can for example arise in the data shift between the training and deployment domains. To this day, Deep Ensembles  outperform most other approaches. A common explanation for the improved performance is the high diversity of solutions in the ensemble   , which is mostly generated by training from different parameter initializations. While this approach works well empirically, distance in parameter space generated through training from different starting positions does not guarantee diversity in the solution space, which we refer to as functional diversity [ref]8. However, ensuring a diverse set of solutions in an ensemble is critical to itâ€™s performance  [ref]8. Following recent interest in the topic of diversity in neural network ensembles , many publications try to implicitly generate diversity by training with different architectures  , different data augmentations  and different hyperparameters . However, this approach to generate diversity is sub-optimal, as it does not guarantee diversity. Additionally, choosing the right architectures and hyperparameters requires a lot of design decisions and is thereby time-consuming. On the other side, functional diversity can be regularized explicitly , an idea recently used to improve adversarial robustness in ensembles  . Although these explicit approaches guarantee diversity of predictions, they rely on diversity measures on the original training data, which can lead to a degradation in accuracy. Additionally, these approaches do not perform well in tasks of out-of-distribution detection and the naive implementation requires the simultaneous training of multiple ensemble members, which is expensive and can be prohibitive in some tasks. In our experiments, we put a special focus on ensembles that share parameters between the members. While these architectures require much less computational time, the lower ratio of independent parameters per member leads to a reduction of diverse predictions , which naturally lends itself to using explicit diversity maximization. For this, we use ensemble architectures with an increasing ratio of shared parameters between members and show that the effect of diversity regularization on robustness and calibration increases with a higher ratio of shared parameters. We introduce the Sample Diversity regularizer (SD) that instead of using in-distribution images to diversify the predictions, uses out-of-distribution images and  increases accuracy and calibration under dataset shift, while also increasing the out-of-distribution detection capabilities of the model, contrary to our other baseline regularizers. The proposed regularizer can also be combined for greater effect with the other explicit diversity regularizers. Taking inspiration from the methods of Shui et al. , we systematically evaluate the effectiveness of explicit diversity regularization, coming to the conclusion that diversity regularization is especially useful when encountering dataset shift [ref]3, even reducing the number of ensemble members needed for the same performance and allowing for the training of light-weight approximate ensemble architectures instead of full ensembles. To summarize, our contributions are as follows: We introduce the Sample Diversity regularizer, which increases the accuracy and calibration under dataset shift, as well as the out-of-distribution detection capabilities and can be combined with existing diversity regularizers for greater effect. We demonstrate that diversity regularization is highly effective for architectures with a high ratio of shared parameters, reducing the number of needed ensemble members under dataset shift and allowing for smaller architectures.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: When a machine learning system is used in high-risk environments, such as medicine and autonomous driving, a well-calibrated estimate of the uncertainty is necessary.\nA model is said to be calibrated [ref]1 if the confidence of its predictions reflects its true probability of being correct.\nHowever, deep neural networks tend to be overconfident in their predictions [ref]1 leading to multiple\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
