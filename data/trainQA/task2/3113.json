      "content": "Paper Title: Anomaly Rule Detection in Sequence Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith a wide range of emerging real-world applications, large amounts of data have been generated. How to effectively perform data analytic in emerging data-driven applications is interesting and challenging. Among this scenario, it has led to a renewed attention in anomaly detection   and security issues [ref]3 by leveraging the power of machine learning and data analysis. For example, risk modeling, utility mining [ref]4 , intrusion/malware detection [ref]3, and usage behavior anomaly detection  are indispensable in many fields like cyber-security, market basket analysis, fintech, healthcare, public security and AI safety. In theory and foundation of anomaly detection, the explaining of anomalies/outliers is a fundamental issue . And outlier pattern detection takes an important role in this research field, such as . To further motivate outlier pattern detection, in this section, we describe two real-world applications: 1) Network intrusion detection. It has become increasingly important to find the intrusion from a wide variety of cyber threats. However, the standard frequent pattern mining techniques are not helpful to detect emerging cyber threats since most of the cyber threats are unusual. On the network, the number of intrusions is usually a very small fraction of the total network traffic . Based on the KDD Cup’99 dataset , it has demonstrated that the rare class (aka outlier) prediction techniques are much more efficient for detecting intrusive behavior than traditional classification methods. 2) Targeted marketing . Despite the enormous amount of data, particular interesting goods/events are still quite rare. The so-called rare events are events that occur very infrequently. In targeted marketing, response is typically rare but can be profitable (w.r.t. high-utility) . Moreover, a targeted-marketing approach usually lies in the fact the events are sequential in nature. In general, sequence data is commonly seen in targeted marketing application. These rare profitable events can be said as profitable outliers in sequence data. Therefore, utility but not frequency is more appropriate than other factors for evaluating methods for rare event detection in decision making. Many techniques have been developed for outlier detection (or called anomaly detection) . These studies can be broadly classified into two categories: (i) rule-based techniques, and (ii) various data-driven approaches. Note that standard approaches, e.g., frequent pattern mining 0, do not work well for rare pattern (outlier) analysis. To effectively identify the domain expert’s interests, several measures are commonly used in anomaly detection models, such as frequency (statistically rare point), utility (high-utility value), and risk. There exists a considerable number algorithms of pattern mining for anomaly detection (or in short, PM4AD) 1 2. Up until now, there are many pattern-based anomaly detection algorithms, and most of them studied the issues of pattern representation, evaluation metrics of normal pattern, pattern mining, and computation of the statistical anomaly score. Sequential data has additional temporal information compared to transactional data. In most of application scenarios, the sequential relations among objects usually have been hidden but more significant information can reveal personalized behaviors . For example, Zhu et al. 3 introduced rare sequential topic patterns and then extracted topics in document stream. Identification of hot regions in protein-protein interactions 4 is also related to sequential pattern mining. Therefore, it is critical to capture the underlying information in sequence data. In this paper, we will concentrate on the basic problem of PM4AD in sequence data. Moreover, the discovered rare (infrequent) patterns may have rich underlying information (e.g., sequential information) in many application scenarios, such as economic case investigation, financial internal audit 3, credit risk assessment 3, and sequence outlier pattern detection in Internet of Things (IoT) 5. State-of-the-art and challenges. In these pattern-based anomaly detection techniques, their computational complexity in detecting rare occurrences of events is one of the key challenges. For example, the rare graph mining technique may easily suffer from costly sub-graph isomorphism 6 7. Another challenge comes to that PM4AD in sequence data could generate an enormous number of candidates during the mining and test processes . This problem is exacerbated when the processed data is large scale or the minimum thresholds are set low. In summarize, they may suffer from two intrinsic problems: (i) a high time-complexity for computing rarity and anomaly score, i.e., this PM4AD problem is NP-hard; and (ii) the difficulty in identification of normal pattern, i.e., it is difficult to select suitable metrics to well evaluate normal patterns. In order to incorporate utility into data mining, there are many utility-driven data mining algorithms have been studied [ref]4 8. The total utility of a pattern (e.g., itemset, rule, sequence) is an estimator of the true value which has more useful information than that of the frequency value. Therefore, it is critical for us to capture the outlier patterns that are high-utility anomalies. As a result, how to distinguish the high-utility anomalies instead of those low-utility statistical outliers by incorporating utility is studied in this paper. Major contributions. Our current work is motivated by the need to detect unusual high-utility sequential rules from a set of sequence data. Designing an effective and efficient outlier pattern detection approach is challenging in nature, for several reasons. First, we need to detect the rare utility-driven patterns. Thus, there is an urgent requirement for PM4AD algorithms that can process massive sequence data efficiently and provide acceptable mining performance. We take into account the fact that anomalous behavior relies on sequence data and it may have a high-utility value. To the best of our knowledge, until now there has been no work in utility-driven rare sequential rule mining for anomaly detection. The primary contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: We incorporate utility into outlier detection in sequence data. This work first introduces the concept of utility-aware outlier sequential rule (UOSR), and then formulates the problem of UOSR detection that is more practical for the task of anomaly pattern detection in sequence data. We solve this problem using a novel algorithm named Discovery of Utility-aware Outlier Sequential rules (DUOS) with both frequency and utility measures, as well as sequence weighting factor. A new data structure, Rule Count Matrix, is designed to maintain rich information. And the designed utility table can avoid repeatedly scanning the database and then reduce the execution time. For efficiency improvement, we developed several optimization techniques that utilize upper bounds on utility and rare rule. Based on the anti-monotonous properties of upper bounds, several pruning strategies were designed to accelerate the mining process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DUOS algorithm is capable for effectively detecting rare high-utility anomalies in real sequence datasets. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, related works are briefly reviewed. Section 3 introduces essential definitions and formulates the problem of UOSR detection. The details of proposed DUOS method with several upper bounds and compact data structures, are described in Section 4. Extensive experiments are conducted and the results are presented in detail in Section 5. Finally, the conclusion and future work are drawn in Section 6.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: perform data analytic in emerging data-driven applications is interesting and challenging.
