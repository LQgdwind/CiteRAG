      "content": "Paper Title: Contrastive Reasoning in Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSupervised learning entails learning by association. In the field of psychology, associative learning involves the formation of previously unknown associations between stimuli and responses . In supervised machine learning, stimuli refers to the data provided to the algorithm and response is the label required of the algorithm. During training, the algorithm is conditioned to associate between the data and its label. Hence, the goal of training an algorithm is to learn the patterns in data that either cause or correlate to the given label. During testing, the algorithm searches for the learned pattern to predict the label. This act of predicting the label is termed as inference. The means of arriving at the inference is reasoning. An example of supervised machine learning is object recognition where a label is inferred based on the learned patterns in a given image. Recent advances in machine learning has allowed state-of-the-art performances in recognition tasks [ref]17. Specifically, recognition algorithms surpassed top-5 human error rate of 5.1%percent5.15.1\\% on ImageNet . Error rate measures the inaccurate predictions made by humans or the network. The reduction in error rate can be traced to advancements in the learning process , regularization [ref]54, and hardware utilization 3 among others. However, all these advancements rely on the traditional feed-forward-based associative reasoning and inference scheme. The author in 9 examines the conventional feed-forward model of inference in both human vision and machine vision, where a set of neurons extract object selective features in a hierarchical fashion. Such a feed-forward representation leads to a task-specific, trained-data specific inference mechanism. For instance, a change in data domain during testing requires retraining to obtain a new representation conducive to test domain. This is because the feed-forward model follows an inductive reasoning approach to inference. Inductive reasoning is a branch of causal inference in perception . Inference based on induction provides a conclusion with uncertainty which allows for speculation regarding cause. Contrary to an inductive framework, an abductive framework creates a hypothesis and tests its validity without considering the cause. Abductive reasoning allows humans to better generalize to new situations. Extensive work has been conducted to understand the development of human brain and visual perception based on abductive reasoning 8. This form of reasoning was introduced by the philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce [ref]42, who saw abduction as a reasoning process from effect to cause . In contrast, induction conjectures general laws from particular instances. Peirce further connected induction and abduction by stating that Induction is an argument which sets out from a hypothesis, resulting from previous Abduction. In this paper, we follow this principle to modify inductively trained feed-forward neural networks to reason and infer abductively for the task of object recognition. In other words, we use an inductively trained neural network to extract multiple hypotheses regarding the input’s class and use them as features for inference. Specifically, we extract hypotheses based on the network’s assertion of contrast between classes. We call this inference mechanism as contrastive inference and its corresponding reasoning as contrastive reasoning. To explain this concept of contrast, let us take the toy example of two subjects distinguishing between three classes of birds - spoonbill, flamingo and crane. This is illustrated in Fig. 1. All three are shallow-water birds with fine-grained physical differences. Spoonbills and flamingos have round and pink bodies. However, they differ primarily in the shape of their necks. A flamingo has an S-shaped neck while a spoonbill does not. Spoonbills and Cranes have long necks but have different colored bodies. Consider that images of all three birds have been shown to two subjects beforehand, thereby training them to distinguish between the three birds. Given a new test image of a spoonbill, subject A correctly recognizes the image as a spoonbill based on the shape and color of the bird’s body and its beak. Subject B also recognizes the image as a spoonbill but does so by noticing that the neck is not S-shaped and the body is not white. While both the subjects infer correctly, the reasoning mechanism is complementary. Subject B infers the contrast between a known fact - the S-shape of the neck, white body- and its lack thereof in the test image to make the right classification. Hence subject B constructed multiple hypotheses and contrastively reasoned why it cannot be either a flamingo or a crane. Inference that is built on these contrastive reasons or features is termed as contrastive inference. On the contrary, subject A reasons inductively to infer the correct class based on identifying the patterns in the image corresponding to spoonbill. This is feed-forward inference that is currently being used by neural networks. Paper structure and novelty: In this paper, we rethink existing inductive reasoning based feed-forward networks and provide an alternative reasoning and inference scheme based on abduction. We first describe abductive reasoning and its usage in artificial intelligence and machine learning in Section 2. We provide a structure to the possible abductive reasons and introduce contrastive reasons as a subset of abductive reasons. We further show that current formulations of abductive reasoning does not allow for large scale learning based solutions. The novelty of our work is in formulating abductive reasons as contrasts that can be extracted from trained deep networks. This is motivated and described in Section 3. We extract and visualize these contrastive reasons in Section 4 as contrastive visual explanations. We then qualitatively examine the results and gain insights provided by such contrastive explanations. In Section 5, we describe the inference mechanism that uses the contrastive reasons to make decisions. We finally enhance the robustness of existing models to noise in Section 6 and conclude in Section 7.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: is object recognition where a label is inferred based on the learned patterns in a given image.
