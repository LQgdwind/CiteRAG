However, the multiway structure information of high-dimensional data such as RGB images or videos cannot be represented by NMF. Vectorization of the high-dimensional data may lead to excess numbers of parameters and structure interruptions. Nonnegative tensor decomposition based methods have been proposed for the high-dimensional data. Nonnegative CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (NCP) methods:\nThe CP-based tensor model (Fig. 1)  decomposes 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} into a linear combination of R𝑅R rank-one tensors as follows: where DiagN​(𝝀)superscriptDiag𝑁𝝀\\mathrm{Diag}^{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}) is the N𝑁Nth-order diagonal tensor.\nThe CP rank of 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} is given by Rankc​p​(𝒳)=RsubscriptRank𝑐𝑝𝒳𝑅\\mathrm{Rank}_{cp}(\\mathcal{X})=R denotes the smallest number of the rank-one tensor decomposition .\nThe CP-based tensor model assumes each tensor element can be calculated by a summation of R𝑅R products and it is restrictive since it only considers R𝑅R possible interactions between latent factors. Existing CP-based tensor models have a flexible subspace representation which may not consider the intrinsic manifold information of high-dimensional data and the performance of downstream tasks will be limited.\nA few regularization and prior knowledge strategies have been studied in these models .\nFor example, Zhao et al.  formulated CP factorization using a hierarchical probabilistic model and employed a fully Bayesian treatment by incorporating a sparsity-inducing prior over multiple latent factors and the appropriate hyperpriors over all hyperparameters to determine the rank of models. Zhao et al.  proposed a probabilistic model to recover the underlying low-rank tensor which modeled by multiplicative interactions among multiple groups of latent factors, and the additive sparse tensor modeling outliers. Zhou et al.  introduced concurrent regularizations which regularized the entire subspace in a concurrent and coherent way to avoid the strong scale restrictions of L2subscript𝐿2L_{2} regularization. Chen et al.  proposed a generalized weighted low rank tensor factorization which represented the sparse component as a mixture of Gaussian, and unified the Tucker and CP factorization in a joint framework to handle complex noise and outliers.\nHowever, these methods neglect nonnegative constrains and may not learn the part-based and physical meaning representations. NTF methods:\nThe Tucker model (Fig. 2) assumes that an original tensor 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} can be well approximated as where the tucker rank of 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} is denoted as Ranktc​(𝒳)=(R1,…,Rn,…,RN)subscriptRanktc𝒳subscript𝑅1…subscript𝑅𝑛…subscript𝑅𝑁\\mathrm{Rank}_{\\mbox{tc}}(\\mathcal{X})=(R_{1},\\dots,R_{n},\\dots,R_{N}) with Rn=Rank​(𝐗(n))subscript𝑅𝑛Ranksubscript𝐗𝑛R_{n}=\\mathrm{Rank}(\\mathbf{X}_{(n)}). We note that the CP decomposition is a special case of the Tucker decomposition.\nAlthough the tucker decomposition is invariant to rotations in the factor matrices, it shares parameters across latent factor matrices by a core tensor.\nIn contrast, CP decomposition methods force each factor vector to capture potentially redundant information .\nCP decomposition methods are more prone to overfitting than Tucker decompositions.\nThe main interest in Tucker model is to find subspaces for tensor approximation. Li et al.  introduced a manifold regularization into the core tensors of NTF which preserved the tensor geometry information. But the representation space of the core tensor will increase exponentially as tensor order increases, which results in high computational complexity. Jiang et al.  added a graph Laplacian regularization on a low-dimensional factor matrix to improve the robustness of tensor decomposition. Sun et al.  proposed a heterogeneous tensor decomposition for clustering by performing dimensionality reduction on the first N−1𝑁1N-1 order of the tensor, and incorporating some useful constraints on the last-mode factor matrix for clustering.\nHowever, these methods neglect nonnegative constraints and may loss physical meaning of low-rank representations. Yin et al.  incorporated Laplacian Eigenmaps and Locally Linear Embedding as the manifold regularization terms into the least square form of NTF model. Pan et al.  introduced the orthogonal constraint into the group of factor matrices of NTF, which not only helps to keep the inherent tensor structure but also well performs in data compression. Yin et al.  proposed Hypergraph Regularized NTF which preserved nonnegativity in tensor factorization and uncover the higher-order relationship among the nearest neighborhoods.\nHowever, these methods decompose tensor data by minimizing the Euclidean distance which fails on the not cleaned data. Manifold learning:\nManifold learning is a problem which encodes the geometric information of the data space.\nIts goal is to find a representation in which two objects are close to each other after dimension reduction if they are close in the intrinsic geometry of data manifold.\nBased on this idea, many types of manifold learning algorithms have been proposed, such as ISOMAP , LLE , Laplacian eigenmaps  and locality preserving projections .\nThe advantage of introducing manifold structures is that it can preserve the intrinsic geometric information of data points, and it has been shown to be useful in a wide-range of applications, such as face recognition , text mining , and multimedia interaction . Recently, the idea of manifold learning has been employed to matrix and tensor analysis.\nFor instance, Cai et al.  proposed graph regularized nonnegative matrix factorization (GNMF) which utilized the intrinsic geometric information.\nHowever, GNMF may not have optimal solutions due to the noises or outliers of data, consequently other extension methods based on the GNMF have been proposed.\nMoreover, NMF based on manifold learning methods may break the structure of mutliway data points.\nHence, tensor based manifold learning methods have been proposed such as Graph regularized Nonnegative Tucker Decomposition , LLE based nonnegative tensor decomposition .\nThese manifold nonnegative tensor decomposition methods assume that the distribution of noise is Gaussian and may fail on grossly corrupted datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: generally r≪min⁡{M,N}much-less-than𝑟𝑀𝑁r\\ll\\min\\{M,N\\}.\nNMF incorporates the nonnegativity constraint and obtains the part-based representation as well as enhancing the interpretability [ref]8 and these methods have a close relation with K-means .\nHowever, the factorization of matrices is generally nonunique and many regularizors  or constraints [ref]20 have been developed to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
