      "content": "Paper Title: Proof-theoretic Semantics for First-order Logic\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe have shown that first-order classical logic is sound and complete for the proof-theoretic semantics given by Sandqvist  . Simultaneously, we have extended the result to first-order intuitionistic result. The proofs of soundness and completeness are native to proof-theoretic semantics and do not rely on the extant model-theoretic readings of these logics. Curiously, the semantics for first-order classical and intuitionistic logic differ only in the notion of a ‘base’. It is remarkable that a seemingly small change can have such precise and large consequences for what logic is expressed by the support relation. There are various notion of atomic systems in the literature that make a suitable notion of base according to various philosophical positions — see, for example, Piecha and Schroeder-Heister   and Sandqvist . The proofs in this paper is sensitive to the notion of base in the proof soundness. Specifically, it comes up in showing that DNE holds — that is, that ⊩¬¬ϕ→ϕforcesabsentitalic-ϕ→italic-ϕ\\Vdash\\neg\\neg\\phi\\to\\phi obtains. Of course, DNE may be replaced by some other laws such as Pierce’s Law, Thus, classical logic remains sound (and complete) for the B-eS in this paper for any notion of base extending the one given herein and for which DNE, 𝗉𝗅𝗉𝗅\\mathsf{pl}, and so on still hold. We may then ask, ‘What is it about various notions of base that makes them intuitively classical?’ Having answered that, we may substitute ‘classical’ for other logics of interest — intuitionistic, modal, relevant, linear, and so on. For example, following Sandqvist , an alternate candidate for a ’classical’ notion of base would be one containing rules of the form where C,P1,…,Pm,Q1,…,Qn∈cl​(𝒜)𝐶subscript𝑃1…subscript𝑃𝑚subscript𝑄1…subscript𝑄𝑛cl𝒜C,P_{1},\\ldots,P_{m},Q_{1},\\ldots,Q_{n}\\in\\textsc{cl}(\\mathcal{A}) and ℚ1,…,ℚn⊆cl​(𝒜)subscriptℚ1…subscriptℚ𝑛cl𝒜\\mathbb{Q}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbb{Q}_{n}\\subseteq\\textsc{cl}(\\mathcal{A}) (finite and possibly empty). The observation suggests that the semantic content of the logical signs is not entirely encapsulated by their clauses in the semantics, but also depends on the notion of consequence at the pre-logical level (i.e., derivability in a base). This is also witnessed in work by Gheorghiu et al. [ref]10  for substructural logics in which the notion of base was itself made substructural. Finally, we would draw attention to the fact that in the proof of completeness, certain signs — namely, ⊥bottom\\bot, ∨\\lor, ∃\\exists — required distinctive treatment. While all the other logical connectives were handled essential as in the definition of classical consequences via a Frege-Hilbert axiomatization, these signs seemingly demanded to be given a proper rule in the simulation base (rather than an ‘axiom’). On the one hand, this is, perhaps, an accident of the setup and has no real significance. On the other hand, it may say something fundamental about the logical treatment of ‘choice’ and ‘uncertainty’. Indeed, negation/absurdity is already well-known to be subtle in proof-theoretic semantics — see, for example Kürbis  and Gheorghiu and Pym  [ref]12.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: by their clauses in the semantics, but also depends on the notion of consequence at the pre-logical level (i.e., derivability in a base).
