      "content": "Paper Title: Explainable Artificial Intelligence Approaches: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nResearch interests in XAI are re-emerging. The earlier works such as , , and  focused primarily on explaining the decision process of knowledge-based systems and expert systems. The primary reason behind the renewed interest in XAI research has stemmed from the recent advancements in AI, its application to a wide range of areas, the concerns over unethical use, lack of transparency, and undesired biases in the models. In addition, recent laws by different governments are necessitating more research in XAI. According to  and , XAI encompasses Machine Learning (ML) or AI systems for demystifying black models internals (e.g., what the models have learned) and/or for explaining individual predictions. In 2019, Mueller et al. presents a comprehensive review of the approaches taken by a number of types of “explanation systems” and characterizes those into three generations: (1) first-generation systems—for instance, expert systems from the early 70’s, (2) second generation systems—for instance, intelligent tutoring systems, and (3) third generation systems—tools and techniques from the recent renaissance starting from 2015. The first generation systems attempt to clearly express the internal working process of the system by embedding expert knowledge in rules often elicited directly from experts (e.g., via transforming rules into natural language expressions). The second generations systems can be regarded as the human-computer system designed around human knowledge and reasoning capacities to provide cognitive support. For instance, arranging the interface in such a way that complements the knowledge that the user is lacking. Similar to the first generation systems, the third generation systems also attempt to clarify the inner workings of the systems. But this time, these systems are mostly “black box” (e.g., deep nets, ensemble approaches). In addition, nowadays, researchers are using advanced computer technologies in data visualizations, animation, and video, that have a strong potential to drive the XAI research further. Many new ideas have been proposed for generating explainable decisions from the need of primarily accountable, fair, and trust-able systems and decisions. There has been some previous work [ref]10 that mentions three notions for quantification of explainability. Two out of three notions involve experimental studies with humans (e.g., domain expert or a layperson, that mainly investigate whether a human can predict the outcome of the model) [ref]24, , [ref]26, , . The third notion (proxy tasks) does not involve a human, and instead uses known truths as a metric (e.g., the less the depth of the decision tree, the more explainable the model). Some mentionable reviews on XAI are listed in Table I. However, while these works provide analysis from one or more of the mentioned perspectives, a comprehensive review considering all of the mentioned important perspectives, using a mutual test case, is still missing. Therefore, we attempt to provide an overview using a demonstration of a mutual test case or task, and then analyze the various approaches from multiple perspectives, with some future directions of research towards responsible or human-centered AI.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: further.
