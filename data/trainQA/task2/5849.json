      "content": "Paper Title: Diffusion Denoised Smoothing for Certified and Adversarial Robust Out-Of-Distribution Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we present our method.\nEssentially, it combines three techniques: (i) a diffusion denoiser, (ii) a standard OOD detector, and (iii) a certified binary discriminator.\nEach component of this method is designed to overcome a specific problem of ordinary classifiers, as they are not robust to adversarial attacks, either ID or OOD, and do not detect OOD inputs well. \n\n\n\n\nDenoiser\ndenoiseonce​(x+δ;t)subscriptdenoiseonce𝑥𝛿𝑡\\texttt{denoise}_{\\text{once}}(x+\\delta;t)\nℙ(y|x)\\mathbb{P}(y\\lvert x)\n\n\nClassifier\nh​(x~)ℎ~𝑥h(\\tilde{x})\n\n\n\nDiscriminator\ng​(x)𝑔𝑥g(x)\nx𝑥xx~~𝑥\\tilde{x}ℙ(y|x,i)\\mathbb{P}(y\\lvert x,i)ℙ(i|x)\\mathbb{P}(i\\lvert x)\n In Figure 1, we show an overview of DISTRO.\nFirst, a diffusion denoiser is employed before the classifier itself to provide robustness against ID attacks.\nAs a result, adversarial noise introduced by the attack is mitigated by the denoiser.\nThis technique has already been proven to be very efficient and does not affect clean accuracy 7. Secondly, numerous post-hoc OOD detection methods exist.\nThe most straightforward being MSP [ref]6, which can be added to the image classifier without retraining or fine-tuning.\nAlternatively, standard OOD detection methods, such as OE , VOS  or LogitNorm , could also replace the classifier.\nThirdly, to make the model more robust to OOD adversarial attacks, we add a binary discriminator to the model that is trained to be certifiably robust against OOD attacks.\nAdditionally, this discriminator is combined with the OOD detection method from (ii) which is necessary to have the property of asymptotic underconfidence for far-OOD inputs. Configuration.\nThis method does not require any new technical knowledge.\nWe begin by making the assumption that OOD samples are unrelated and thus maximally un-informative to the ID data.\nThus, for every class y∈𝒴𝑦𝒴y\\in\\mathcal{Y}, the conditional distribution on the input x𝑥x is given as: where ℙ​(i|x)ℙconditional𝑖𝑥\\mathbb{P}(i|x) is the conditional distribution representing the probability that x𝑥x is part of the ID, while ℙ​(y|x,i)ℙconditional𝑦𝑥𝑖\\mathbb{P}(y|x,i) is the conditional distribution representing the ID.\nSimilarly to Meinke et al. , we assign independent models to each distribution: ℙ​(y|x,i)=h​(𝚍𝚎𝚗𝚘𝚒𝚜𝚎once​(x+δ;t))ℙconditional𝑦𝑥𝑖ℎsubscript𝚍𝚎𝚗𝚘𝚒𝚜𝚎once𝑥𝛿𝑡\\mathbb{P}(y|x,i)=h(\\mathtt{denoise}_{\\text{once}}(x+\\delta;t)), where h:ℝd→[ref]0 :ℎ→superscriptℝ𝑑01h:\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\to[ref]0  is the confidence of the main classifier F​(x)𝐹𝑥F(x), and x~=𝚍𝚎𝚗𝚘𝚒𝚜𝚎once​(x+δ;t)~𝑥subscript𝚍𝚎𝚗𝚘𝚒𝚜𝚎once𝑥𝛿𝑡\\tilde{x}=\\mathtt{denoise}_{\\text{once}}(x+\\delta;t) represents one single step of denoising operation with δ∼𝒩​(0,σ2​I)similar-to𝛿𝒩0superscript𝜎2𝐼\\delta\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^{2}I). ℙ​(i|x)=11+e−g​(x)ℙconditional𝑖𝑥11superscript𝑒𝑔𝑥\\mathbb{P}(i|x)=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-g(x)}}, where g:ℝd→ℝ:𝑔→superscriptℝ𝑑ℝg:\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\to\\mathbb{R} refers to a binary discriminator trained in a certified robust manner based on an ℓ∞subscriptℓ\\ell_{\\infty}-threat model as in Bitterwolf et al. 3, Meinke et al. . As can be seen, the denoiser is the main addition.\nThe one-step denoiser 𝚍𝚎𝚗𝚘𝚒𝚜𝚎oncesubscript𝚍𝚎𝚗𝚘𝚒𝚜𝚎once\\mathtt{denoise}_{\\text{once}} estimates the fully denoised image x𝑥x from the current timestep t𝑡t.\nThen it computes the average between the denoised image and the noisy image from the previous timestep.\nAs discussed in  Carlini et al. 7, multiple applications of the denoiser will only destroy information about x𝑥x.\nDenoising with iterative steps essentially transfers the classification task to the denoiser, which can determine how the image should be filled.\nFor these reason, we apply only a single step of denoising. Asymptotic Underconfidence.\nHere, we show that by coupling a classifier trained to be OOD aware with a diffusion denoiser and running a certified discriminator in parallel, we can guarantee asymptotic underconfidence for data far enough from the training distribution. To obtain asymptotic underconfidence of the joint classifier, we consider ℙ​(y|x,i)≤1ℙconditional𝑦𝑥𝑖1\\mathbb{P}(y|x,i)\\leq 1 and rewrite  Equation 4 as follows: Since the right term only depends on ℙ​(i|x)ℙconditional𝑖𝑥\\mathbb{P}(i|x), we just need to assure that limβ→∞ℙ​(i|β​x)→0→subscript→𝛽ℙconditional𝑖𝛽𝑥0\\lim_{\\beta\\to\\infty}\\mathbb{P}(i|\\beta x)\\to 0.\nIf we employ a certified binary discriminator, trained with IBP on OOD data, as descibed in Meinke et al. , to compute ℙ​(i|x)ℙconditional𝑖𝑥\\mathbb{P}(i|x), we achieve asymptotic underconfidence independently of the main classifier.\nReaders are referred to Meinke et al.  for a more detailed explanation. Empirical Evaluation.\nIn Figure 2, we show an empirical evaluation of the asymptotic confidence for standard and robust OOD detection methods222the models are described in section 5..\nIn this test, we consider a single ID sample x𝑥x and multiply by a scalar β𝛽\\beta.\nIn 2(a) we plot the MSP [ref]6 as confidence, while in 2(b) we plot the Energy  for increasing values of β>0𝛽0\\beta>0.\nIn the context of MSP, we observe that standard OOD detection methods are asymptotically overconfident, after a small drop, whereas certified methods such as GOOD 3, ProoD  and DISTRO converge to 1/K1𝐾1/K.\nOn the other hand, for Energy as β𝛽\\beta increases, VOS , LogitNorm , and Plain models asymptotically decrease, whereas GOOD 3, ProoD (Meinke at al., 2022), and DISTRO remain stable. As a result, underconfidence can be easily obtained when using an energy score instead of MSP, regardless of whether it is on a plain or OOD aware model.\nHowever, asymptotic underconfidence does not necessarily imply that the model will perform better in detecting OOD samples since all inputs are usually normalized to some range (e.g. [ref]0  or [-1, 1]).\nThus the choice of MSP over the energy function is directly related to the possibility of certified robustness for OOD samples.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: technique has already been proven to be very efficient and does not affect clean accuracy 7. Secondly, numerous post-hoc OOD detection methods exist.\nThe most straightforward being MSP [ref]6, which can be added to the image classifier without retraining or fine-tuning.\nAlternatively, standard OOD detection methods, such as OE , VOS  or LogitNorm , could also replace the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
