      "content": "Paper Title: On the Generalizability of Motion Models for Road Users in Heterogeneous Shared Traffic Spaces\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExisting mixed-traffic motion models are mostly built based on rule-based models (e.g. Cellular Automata (CA) ), or physics-based models, most preeminently the Social Force Model (SFM) . CA models describe road users motion behavior by a set of state transforming rules in a discrete environment. They have been used to model motion behaviors of a set of homogeneous road users, e.g., pedestrians  , cars   and there are also few works describing mixed-traffic motion, e.g.,  who study interactions among pedestrians and cars at crosswalks,  who model car-following and lane-changing actions of cars and motorcycles, or  who study bicycle-to-vehicle interactions and its impact on traffic delay. In the classical SFM, introduced in , the movement of a pedestrian is represented by differential equations comprising a set of simple attractive, and repulsive forces from other pedestrians and static obstacles that he/she experiences at a specific place and time. Even though SFM was initially modeled for pedestrian dynamics  [ref]25 , many studies extended it for modeling other types of road users. For example,   who include vehicles, considering their impact on pedestrians as separate forces; in , Anvari et al. add new forces and rule-based constraints to handle short-range and long-range conflicts among pedestrians and cars. In , SFM is combined with long-range collision avoidance mechanisms to model motion behaviors of pedestrians, vehicles and bicycles. Both CA-based and SFM-based models can represent simple situations well. However, game-theoretic or probabilistic models are more suitable for complex scenarios where road users must choose an action among many alternatives to handle a given situation . In , in case of complex interactions, road users’ choice of action is modeled by a logit model, based on available data but without considering what other users might do. In , Fujii et al. used a discrete choice model to illustrate decision making while in pedestrian interactions.\nGame-theoretic models have often been applied to interpret human decision-making processes, also in traffic situations. Some examples are the application of non-cooperative games to illustrate merging-give way interaction among vehicles (), pedestrian-to-car interaction in shared spaces (), bicyclist-to-car interaction at zebra crossings ([ref]32), or analyze the difference of cyclist/pedestrian interaction with human-driven or autonomous vehicles in . In , lane-changing behaviors of cars are modeled using a cooperative game where cars cooperate with each other for collective reward. Whereas, in a non-cooperative game, each player makes decisions by predicting others’ decisions, which is very similar to what real-world road users often do [ref]32. Although there are several works on modeling motion behavior of road users, only a very few studies consider different motion patterns for individual road user types   . Kabtoul et al.  manually annotates several predefined pedestrian types based on willingness to give way to a car. Alahi et al.  obtain different movement styles for pedestrians by learning collision avoidance parameters of individual pedestrians and clustering them into groups using the k-means clustering. Their model is restricted to pedestrian-only scenarios. In , the authors classified pedestrians into groups based on their age range and gender and assigned individual speed profiles to each group. These speed profiles are collected from the literature instead of real-world data sets. Existing closed-source commercial (e.g., AIMSUN  or VISSIM ) and open-source (SUMO ) simulators are somewhat capable of modeling and simulating mixed-traffic at a microscopic level. However, open-source simulators like SUMO have limited means for modeling interaction between heterogeneous road users. To address this issue, some studies combined SUMO with agent frameworks such as JADE () or JASON (); however, adding new environmental features or define new modalities in such models is difficult. Also, SUMO lacks flexibility regarding lane and vehicle geometries, which is restrictive for shared spaces.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: attractive, and repulsive forces from other pedestrians and static obstacles that he/she experiences at a specific place and time.
