      "content": "Paper Title: Selectivity Estimation with Attribute Value Dependencies using Linked Bayesian Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEver since the seminal work of Selinger et al. , query optimisation has largely relied on the use of cost models. Because the most important part of the cost model is the selectivity estimation module , a lot of good efforts have been made across the decades.  first proposed the use of histograms to approximate the distribution P‚Äã(x)ùëÉùë•P(x) of a single attribute xùë•x. Since then, a lot of work has gone into developing optimal histograms  that have been used ubiquitously in cutting edge cost models. Smooth versions of histograms, e.g., kernel density estimators (KDEs)  and wavelets , have also been proposed. However, these methods are based on single attributes, and as such lose in accuracy what they gain in computational efficiency. Indeed, there is no way to capture a dependency between two attributes xùë•x and yùë¶y if one only has unidimensional distributions P‚Äã(x)ùëÉùë•P(x) and P‚Äã(y)ùëÉùë¶P(y) available, regardless of their accuracy. Multidimensional distributions, i.e., P‚Äã(X1,‚Ä¶,Xn)ùëÉsubscriptùëã1‚Ä¶subscriptùëãùëõP(X_{1},\\dots,X_{n}), are a way to catch dependencies between attributes. Methods based on such distributions are naturally more accurate because they soften the AVI assumption. However, they require a large amount of computational resources which hinders their use in high-throughput settings.  first formalised the use of equi-depth multidimensional histograms and introduced an efficient construction algorithm.  proposed another construction algorithm based on Hilbert curves. Multidimensional KDEs have also been proposed , with somewhat the same complexity guarantees. In search for efficiency,  offered a workload-aware method where the idea is to only build histograms for attributes that are often queried together. Even though methods based on multidimensional distributions are costly, they are implemented in some database systems and are used when specified by a database administrator. However, these methods do not help whatsoever in capturing dependencies across relations, which is probably the biggest issue cost models have to deal with. Sampling methods have also been proposed to perform selectivity estimation. The idea is to run a query on a sample of the database and extrapolate the selectivity . Sampling works very well for single relations and has been adopted by some commercial database systems. However, off the shelf sampling procedures suffer from the fact that the join of sampled relations has a high probability of being empty ; in other words a join has to be materialised before sampling can be done. This issue can be alleviated by the use of correlated sampling , where a deterministic hash function is used to ensure that samples from different relations will match with each other. Another technique is to use indexes when available , but this is only realistic for in-memory databases.  also proposed heuristics for maintaining statistics of join synopses. Overall, sampling is an elegant selectivity estimation method, not least because it can handle complex predicates which statistical summaries cannot (e.g., regex queries). However, sampling necessarily incurs a high computational cost. Indeed even if the samples are obtained at downtime, they still have to be loaded in memory during the query optimisation phase. Throughout the years, a lot of proposals have been made to relax the simplifying assumptions from . All of these require compromises in terms of accuracy, speed, and memory usage. The general consensus is that each method shines in a particular use case, and thus combining different methods might be a good approach.  formalised this idea by using a maximum entropy approach. Recently,  proposed combining sampling and synopses. Another approach altogether is to ‚Äúgive up‚Äù on the cost model and instead memorise the worst mistakes it makes so as not to reproduce them in the future [ref]11. There have also been proposals that make use of machine learning  [ref]31 [ref]32 , where a supervised learning algorithm is taught to predict selectivities based on features derived from a given query and the database‚Äôs metadata. Recently, deep learning methods have been proposed to extract features that don‚Äôt require rules written by humans. One of the most prominent papers that advocates the use of deep learning for selectivity estimation can be found in . They proposed a neural network architecture, which they dubbed MSCN for multi-set convolutional network. Although approaches based on supervised machine learning have had great success in other domains, their performance for query selectivity estimation isn‚Äôt competitive enough, yet. Approaches that exploit attribute correlations in order to avoid storing redundant information have also been proposed. For example,  proposes to build a statistical interaction model that allows to determine a relevant subset of multidimensional histograms to build. In other words, they propose to build histograms when attributes are correlated, and to make the AVI assumption if not. Bayesian networks can be seen through the same lens of exploiting redundant information. Essentially, they factorise the full probability distribution into a set of conditional distributions. A conditional distribution between two attributes implies a hierarchy whereby one of the attributes determines to some extent the other. Formally, a Bayesian network is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where each node is an attribute and each arrow implies a conditional dependency. They can be used to summarise a probability distribution by breaking it up into smaller pieces. In comparison with the supervised learning based methods mentioned in the previous paragraph, Bayesian networks are an unsupervised learning method. What this means is that they directly learn by looking at the data, whereas supervised methods require a workload of queries and outputs in order to learn. In , we proposed to use Bayesian networks for capturing attribute value dependencies inside individual relations.  and  both proposed methods for using Bayesian networks to capture attribute value dependencies between different relations. Although this leads to more accurate selectivity estimates, it requires much more computation time and is infeasible in practice. This is due to the fact that they require the use of expensive belief propagation algorithms for performing inference. Meanwhile, our method is much faster because it restricts each Bayesian network to a tree topology, which allows the use of the variable elimination algorithm. However, our method completely ignores dependencies between attributes of different relations. Our goal in this paper is to reconcile both approaches. Effectively, we want to keep the computational benefits of building and using individual Bayesian networks, but at the same time we want our method to capture some dependencies across relations.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: proposed combining sampling and synopses.
