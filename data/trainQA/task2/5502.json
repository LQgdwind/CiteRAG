Compared to the conventional cell-free systems where all access points (APs) serve every user equipment (UE) within their coverage, a more practical architecture is a user-centric cell-free (UCCF) system with each UE served only by its associated APs (as opposed to all APs).\nProvided effective AP-UE association (AUA), a UCCF system would reduce the hardware and software complexity of the APs and the backhaul overhead of the APs [ref]5 . Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is an increasingly popular technique considered for the cost-effective deployment of next-generation wireless networks .\nComprising a large number of passive reflective elements, an RIS can have the reflection coefficients of its elements individually adjusted to ameliorate wireless propagation environments and improve system capacity , achievable rate , or energy efficiency (EE) . The consideration of an RIS is imperative for a future-proof design of wireless communication systems. A new RIS-assisted UCCF system is promising, joining the benefits of both UCCF and RIS for future wireless networks.\nThe optimization of the system necessitates a holistic joint design of AUA, power control, and RIS passive beamforming, and is nontrivial due to a prohibitively large and complex solution space.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the RIS-assisted UCCF system has never been studied in the literature.\nConventional approaches relying generally on prior information lack flexibility  and can hardly ensure effectiveness and reliability.\nLearning-based methods can make decisions adaptively by fitting learning policies between the input and output to a nonlinear model , offering the potential to effectively optimize the AUA, power control, and RIS beamforming of the RIS-assisted UCCF system. Digital twin (DT) provides a new paradigm for effective management of complex systems, e.g., the next-generation wireless networks, by creating a real-time digital simulation model of the systems .\nIt can monitor the operating state of the systems in real-time, record and replay the past experience of the systems, and predict future states or operations based the experience replay  .\nA DT-based virtual environment can be particularly useful when direct interactions with the actual physical environment are practically unaffordable, e.g., for real-time resource allocation of RIS-assisted UCCF systems.\n This paper presents a new learning-based framework that maximizes the sum-rate of the new RIS-assisted, uplink, UCCF system with the assistance of a DT. The AUA, power control, and RIS beamforming are jointly optimized by training the learning model with the DT that replays the channel estimates stored to emulate the rewards to drive the learning. The key contributions of the paper are summarized as follows. A new problem is formulated to maximize the sum-rate of the new RIS-assisted, uplink, UCCF system with only the imperfect channel state information (CSI) of the end-to-end channels between the UEs and APs (including those via the RISs). A new learning framework is proposed to solve the new problem by decoupling the AUA, power control, and RIS beamforming based on the different natures of their variables, while capturing their interplay through the design of interactive rewards. This considerably reduces the action space of the learning framework. A new position-adaptive binary particle swarm optimization (PABPSO) method is designed for the AUA to eliminate infeasible particles that would be otherwise generated by the conventional BPSO.\nTwo twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) models are paralleled for the PCRB (i.e., power control and RIS beamforming) with refined state pre-processing, thereby improving training convergence and reducing complexity. A DT is adopted to train the proposed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model based its stored channel estimates and emulated rewards for learning in the virtual environment. Interactions with the physical environment may only take place once at the end of selected epochs to refine the DT-based training process. Extensive simulations show that the proposed framework is superior to its possible alternatives in terms of achievable rate and robustness.\nThe use of the DT can dramatically cut off the overhead arising from actual transmissions in the physical environment and substantially reduce the overhead and delay.\nThe significant gain of the RIS is also demonstrated. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the related works are discussed. In Section III, the RIS-assisted, uplink, UCCF system model is presented, and the problem is formulated. In Section IV, we transform the problem into two subtasks. In Section V, a new learning-based semi-parallel framework is proposed. Simulation results are presented in Section VI, followed by conclusions in Section VII.
