      "content": "Paper Title: Graph Attention Layer Evolves Semantic Segmentation for Road Pothole Detection: A Benchmark and Algorithms\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nApothole is a large structural road failure [ref]1. Its formation is due to the combined presence of water and traffic [ref]2. Water permeates the ground and weakens the soil under the road surface while traffic subsequently breaks the affected road surface, resulting in the removal of road surface chunks [ref]3. Road potholes, besides being an inconvenience, are also a safety hazard because they can severely affect driving comfort, vehicle condition, and traffic safety [ref]3. Therefore, frequently inspecting and repairing road potholes is a crucial road maintenance task [ref]1. Currently, road potholes are regularly detected and reported by certified inspectors . This manual visual inspection process is tedious, dangerous, costly, and time-consuming [ref]3. Moreover, manual road pothole detection results are qualitative and subjective as they depend entirely on individual inspectors’ experience . Consequently, there is an ever-increasing need for automated road pothole detection systems, especially ones developed based on state-of-the-art (SoTA) computer vision and machine learning techniques. In [ref]3, we published the world’s first multi-modal road pothole detection dataset, containing RGB images, subpixel disparity images, and transformed disparity images. An example of these three modalities of road vision data is shown in Fig. 1. It can be observed that the damaged road areas are highly distinguishable after disparity transformation, making road pothole detection much easier. However, there lacks a benchmark for road pothole detection based on SoTA semantic segmentation convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained on spatial vision data, e.g., disparity/depth images, other than road RGB images. Therefore, there is a strong motivation to provide a comprehensive comparison for SoTA CNNs w.r.t. different modalities of road vision data. Additionally, some semantic segmentation approaches   combine CNNs with graph models, such as conditional random fields (CRFs), to improve the image segmentation performance. Such CRF-based approaches are nevertheless very computationally intensive, and thus they can only be deployed on the final semantic probability map. Therefore, a graph attention layer that can produce additional weights based on the relational inductive bias to refine image feature representations is also a research topic that requires more attention. We introduce a novel graph model-based semantic segmentation CNN for road pothole detection, of which the effectiveness is demonstrated with extensive experiments. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: A benchmark of all SoTA semantic segmentation CNNs trained on the three aforementioned modalities of vision data for road pothole detection; Graph attention layer (GAL), a novel graph layer inspired by graph neural network (GNN) , which can be easily deployed in any CNN to optimize image feature representations for semantic image segmentation; A novel CNN, referred to as GAL-DeepLabv3+, incorporating the proposed GAL in DeepLabv3+ . It outperforms SoTA CNNs for road pothole detection. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section II reviews the SoTA road pothole detection approaches and semantic segmentation CNNs. Section III introduces our proposed methodology. In Section IV, we compare the performance of our proposed method with the SoTA CNNs reviewed in Section II. Section V discusses the implications and practical application of this work. Finally, Section VI summarizes the paper and provides recommendations for future work.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Apothole is a large structural road failure [ref]1.
