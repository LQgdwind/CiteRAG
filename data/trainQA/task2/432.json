      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient and Effective ER with Progressive Blocking\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBlocking has been used to scale Entity Resolution (ER) for a very long time. However, all the techniques in the literature have considered blocking as a preprocessing step and suffered from the trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency/scalability.\nWe divide the related work into two parts: advanced blocking methods which we improve upon, and progressive ER methods which can be used to generate a limited amount of matching/non-matching pairs to send as a feedback to our blocking computation. Advanced blocking methods.  There are many blocking methods in the literature with different internal functionalities and solving different blocking sub-tasks. In this paper, we considered four representative block building strategies, namely standard blocking¬†, canopy clustering¬†, sorted neighborhood¬† and q-grams blocking¬†. It is well-known that such techniques can yield a fairly dense blocking graph when used alone. We refer the reader to¬† for an extensive survey of various blocking techniques and their shortcomings. Such block building strategies can be used as the method XùëãX in our Algorithm¬†1. Recent works have proposed advanced methods that can be used in combination with the mentioned block building techniques by focusing on the comparison cleaning sub-task (thus improving on efficiency). The first technique in this space is meta-blocking¬†. Meta-blocking aims to extract the most similar pairs of records by leveraging block-to-record relationships and can be very efficient in reducing the number of unnecessary pairs produced by traditional blocking techniques, but it is not always easy to configure. To this end, follow-up works such Blast¬†[ref]29 use ‚Äúloose‚Äù schema information to distinguish promising pairs, while¬† and SNB¬† rely on a sample of labeled pairs for learning accurate blocking functions and classification models respectively. Finally, the most recent strategy BLOSS¬† uses active learning to select such a sample and configure the meta-blocking. The goal of traditional meta-blocking¬† and its follow-up techniques like BLOSS¬† prune out low similarity candidates from the blocking graph generated using various block building strategies discussed above. Their performance is highly dependent on the effectiveness of block building techniques and the quality of blocking graph. On the other hand, pBlocking constructs meaningful blocks that effectively capture majority of the matching pairs and scores each block based on their quality to generate fewer non-matching pairs in the blocking graph. Meta-blocking techniques compute the blocking graph statically, prior to ER, and thus can be used as the ZùëçZ method in our Algorithm¬†1. In Figure¬†2 we compare with classic meta-blocking and BLOSS, as the latter shows its superiority over Blast and SNB. Progressive ER.  Many applications need to resolve data sets efficiently but do not require the ER result to be complete. Recent literature described methods to compute the best possible partial solution. Such techniques include pay-as-you-go ER¬† that use ‚Äúhints‚Äù on records that are likely to refer to the same entity and more generally progressive ER such as the schema-agnostic method in¬† and the strategies in¬† that consider a limit on the execution time. In our discussion, we considered oracle-based techniques, namely Node¬†3, Edge¬†4, and Eager¬†. Differently from other progressive techniques, oracle-based methods consider a limit on the number of pairs that are examined by the oracle for matching/non-matching response. Such techniques were originally designed for dealing with the crowd but they can also be used with a variety of classifiers due to their flexibility. All these techniques naturally work in combination with pBlocking by sending as feedback their partial results. Other ER methods.  In addition to the above methods, we mention works on ER architectures that can help users to debug and tune parameters for the different components of ER¬†   . Specifically, the approaches in¬†  show how to leverage the crowd in this setting. All of these techniques are orthogonal to the scope of our work and we do not consider them in our analysis. The previous work in¬†7 proposes to greedily merge records as they are matched by ER, while processing the blocks one at a time. Each merged record (containing tokens from the component records) is added to the unprocessed blocks, permitting its participation in the subsequent matching and merging by their iterative algorithm. Limitations of processing blocks one at a time has been shown in more recent blocking works¬†.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: and can be very efficient in reducing the number of unnecessary pairs produced by traditional blocking techniques, but it is not always easy to configure.
