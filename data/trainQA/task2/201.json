      "content": "Paper Title: Counterfactual Samples Synthesizing for Robust Visual Question Answering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLanguage Biases in VQA.\nDespite VQA is a multimodal task, a large body of research   [ref]42 7 has shown the existence of language biases in VQA. There are two main solutions to reduce the language biases: 1. Balancing Datasets to Reduce Biases. The most straightforward solution is to create more balanced datasets. For example, Zhang et al. [ref]42 collected complementary abstract scenes with opposite answers for all binary questions. And Goyal et al. 7 extended this idea into real images and all types of questions. Although these “balanced” datasets have reduced biases to some extent, the statistical biases from questions still can be leveraged . As shown in the benchmark VQA-CP, the performance of numerous models drop significantly compared to these “balanced” datasets. In this paper, we follow the same spirit of dataset balancing and train VQA models with more complementary samples. Especially, CSS doesn’t need any extra manual annotations. 2. Designing Models to Reduce Biases. Another solution is to design specific debiasing models. So far, the most effective debiasing models for VQA are ensemble-based methods 3     7. In this paper, we propose a novel CSS training scheme, which can be seamlessly incorporated into the ensemble-based models to further reduce the biases. Visual-Explainable Ability in VQA Models.\nTo improve visual-explainable ability, early works 2 6  directly apply human attention as supervision to guide the models’ attention maps. However, since the existence of strong biases, even with appropriate attention maps, the remaining layers of network may still disregard the visual signal 6. Thus, some recent works 6 9 utilize Grad-CAM 5 to obtain private contribution of each object to correct answers, and encourage the rank of all object contributions to be consistent with human annotations. Unfortunately, these models have two drawbacks: 1) They need extra human annotations. 2) The training is not end-to-end. Question-Sensitive Ability in VQA Models.\nIf VQA systems really “understand” the question, they should be sensitive to the linguistic variations in question. Surprisingly, to the best of our knowledge, there is only one work 7 has studied the influence of linguistic variations in VQA. Specifically, it designs a cycle-consistent loss between two dual tasks, and utilizes sampled noises to generate diverse questions. However, Shah et al. 7 only considers the robustness to different rephrasings of questions. In contrast, we also encourage the model to perceive the difference of questions when changing some critical words. Counterfactual Training Samples for VQA.\nSome concurrent works  0 also try to synthesize counterfactual samples for VQA. Different from these works that all resort to GAN 6 to generate images, CSS only mask critical objects or words, which is easier and more adoptable.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: Language Biases in VQA.\nDespite VQA is a multimodal task, a large body of research   [ref]42 7 has shown the existence of language biases in VQA.
