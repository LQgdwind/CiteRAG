      "content": "Paper Title: Enhancing Fine-Tuning Based Backdoor Defense with Sharpness-Aware Minimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn general, backdoor defense methods can be categorized into two types: training-stage defenses and post-training defenses. Training-stage defenses   consider that a defender is given a backdoored dataset to train the model. The defender can leverage the different behaviors between benign and poisoned images in the training process to escape attacks, such as the loss dropping speed  and clustering phenomenon in the feature space . Most defense methods belong to post-training defenses [ref]39 [ref]25 4 1 6 7, where the defender is given a suspicious model and has no access to the full training dataset. They need to remove backdoor threat by using a small set of benign samples. Post-training defenses can be roughly divided into fine-tuning based defenses (NC [ref]39, NAD , and i-BAU 4 ) and pruning-based defenses ( FP [ref]25 and ANP 1 ). FP [ref]25 assume that poisoned and benign samples have different activation path. They remove backdoors by pruning the inactivated neurons of benign data and then fine-tuning the pruned model. ANP 1 assumes that backdoor-related neurons are more sensitive to adversarial neuron perturbations. They search for and mask these suspicious neurons by a minimax optimization on benign samples. NC [ref]39 searches for a possible trigger by optimization and retrains the model by regularizing it to predict correctly on the images with the recovered trigger. NAD  first fine-tunes a teacher model on a small subset of benign data and then fine-tunes a student model under the guidance of the teacher model. I-BAU 4 borrows ideas from universal adversarial perturbations and proposes the implicit backdoor adversarial unlearning algorithm to solve the minimax problem.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: and poisoned images in the training process to escape attacks, such as the loss dropping speed  and clustering phenomenon in the feature space . Most defense methods belong to post-training defenses [ref]39 [ref]25 4 1 6 7, where the defender is given a suspicious model and has no access to the full training dataset. They need to remove backdoor threat by using a small set of benign samples.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
