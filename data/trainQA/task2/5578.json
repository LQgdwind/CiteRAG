      "content": "Paper Title: DeepSeq: Deep Sequential Circuit Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe select a non-simulative power estimation method  and a learning based netlist-level power estimation method, i.e., Grannite [ref]18 as the baselines for comparison. Nevertheless, there are more learning based power estimations methods [ref]5 . But they either estimate power at RTL level [ref]5 or for FPGA HLS . On the contrary, DeepSeq targets netlist-level power estimation. Therefore, we omit the comparison with these methods. We implement Grannite in a unified framework with DeepSeq using PyTorch Geometric (PyG)  package. To enable a fair comparison, we keep the same training data for Grannite that we use for Deeseq training, (see Table I and Section IV-A1 for more details). However, we generate new node and edge features of training circuits, according to the settings proposed in Grannite. After that, similar to DeepSeq, we train Grannite for 50 epochs using L1 loss. To be noted, Grannite predicts the transition probabilities only for combinational logic in sequential netlist, whereas DeepSeq predicts the transition probabilities for all components in sequential netlists, i.e., PIs, logic gates, FF. As describe in Section V-A1, the distribution of transition probabilites on large circuit designs are quite different than the distribution of transition probabilities on training dataset that consists of small circuits. Therefore, similar to DeepSeq, we fine-tune Grannite on these large practical circuit designs. On the one-hand, it ensures a fair comparison with DeepSeq. On the other-hand, it is consistent with training strategy proposed in Grannite, i.e., they train and infer results on real large circuits. In practice, power estimation is performed on circuits with multiple gate types. Therefore, we use test circuits containing different gate types during inference. (see Table IV\nHowever, our model supports input circuits in AIG format. Therefore during inference, to accurately estimate the power, we decompose each gate in test circuit into a combination of AND gates and NOT gates without any optimization. The fanout gate in the resulting combination has the same switching activity as the original gate. Note that, we only record probabilities of the fanout gates in all converted combinations. To generate the workload of our test circuits, we parse their corresponding testbench files and collect the transition probability and logic probability of each PI. The collected information defines the workloads of underlying circuits. The power estimation pipeline is illustrated in Fig. 3. We set the transition probability achieved by the logic simulation as the ground truth (GT). The probablistic baseline method  provides the approximated transition probability based on a non-simulative method. In comparison, learning based baseline method, i.e., fine-tuned Grannite and DeepSeq predicts the gate-level transition probabilities. As mentioned before, Grannite only predicts the transition probabilities for combinational logic whereas DeepSeq predicts the transition probabilities for all components in sequential netlists, i.e., PIs, logic gates, FF. Therefore, for Grannite based power estimation, we follow their settings and use RTL level simulation results to obtain transition probabilities for PIs and FFs. This helps us to infer the complete sequential netlist-level power and enables comparison with DeepSeq.\nThe resulting transition probabilities from all these four methods are translated into four Switching Activity Interchange Format (SAIF) files. After that, we input these files into a commercial power analysis tool that computes the average power with a TSMC 90nm standard cell library. Finally, we get the ground-truth power consumption (GT Power), non-simulated baseline power (Probablistic Power), learning based baseline power (Grannite Power) and DeepSeq estimated power (DeepSeq Power).\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: We select a non-simulative power estimation method  and a learning based netlist-level power estimation method, i.e., Grannite [ref]18 as the baselines for comparison.
