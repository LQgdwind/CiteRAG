      "content": "Paper Title: Cascade-DETR: Delving into High-Quality Universal Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDETR-based Object Detection \nModern object detectors can be mainly divided into the classical CNN-based and more recent DETR-based models     2. The convolutional detectors includes one-stage detectors  1 and two/multi-stage models    [ref]6.\nFor DETR-based models [ref]5    , recent works such as 9 4  outperform CNN-based detectors by a significant margin on COCO. For improving the transformer decoder, Dynamic DETR  designs dynamic encoder for focusing on more important features on multi-scale feature maps while  even replaces the decoder with FCOS/RCNN networks.\nTo enhance decoder queries, Efficient DETR 7 adopts the top-K locations from encoder’s dense prediction prior.\nAnchor DETR 6 represents object queries based on anchor points, while DAB-DETR 9 adopts 4D anchor box coordinates.\nDN-DETR 4 further speeds up the DETR converge by an additional denoising branch.\nBased on DN-DETR and DAB-DETR, DINO  includes contrastive denoising training and mixed query selection for anchor initialization. In contrast to existing DETR-based methods   8, Cascade-DETR is targeted for high-quality object detection.\nThe proposed cascade attention and IoU-aware query recalibration significantly improves AP performance under strict IoU thresholds.\nBesides only experimenting on COCO, we show the effectiveness of our approach on the constructed UDB10 benchmark, which contains a wide range of task-specific applications. Cross-attention in DETR-based Decoder \nIn addition to standard cross-attention [ref]5 applied on global image features, Deformable DETR  proposes deformable attention. A set of 2D image locations are predicted, which are then used for attention.\nMask2Former  proposes mask attention, only indented for segmentation.\nDifferent from these methods, our cascade attention utilizes the iteratively updated boxes to constrain the cross-attention on the image, and does not introduce any extra model parameters. We reveal our advantages to deformable attention and mask attention in the experiment section. High-quality Object Detection \nDifferent from high-quality segmentation networks 3  1 2 based on transformers, existing works 0   [ref]6 on high-quality object detection are mainly R-CNN based. Sepcially, Cascade R-CNN  introduces multi-stage detectors trained with increasing IoU thresholds, while Dynamic R-CNN  designs dynamic labels and a regression loss. Wang et al.  improves R-CNN based segmentation via mask scoring. For localization quality estimation (LQE), previous works 1 0   5 mainly study it in FCOS or R-CNN based detectors.\nTo our knowledge, we are the first DETR-based method tackling the problem of predicting highly accurate boxes. DETR-based Universal Object Detection  Existing DETR-based methods 4  mostly train and evaluate their performance on COCO. However, detectors should generalize well to wide and practical scenarios, such as medical imaging and document analysis.\nTypically these datasets contain around 1K to 20K images, where some contain images with very different styles than COCO/ImageNet.\nDifferent from previous detection works on adaptation learning 5 , few-shot setting 9 or mixed training , we focus on the fully supervised training setting per dataset to evaluate the detector performance in various application scenarios. To facilitate the research on universal object detection using DETR-based detectors, we construct a large-scale UDB10 benchmark containing 228k images, which is doubles the size of UODB 5 for domain adaptation and has significantly more images per dataset component than .\nWe show that Cascade-DETR with injected local object-centric prior brings large performance gains to existing DETR-based models across wide and challenging domains, making DETR-based models more universally applicable.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: object detectors can be mainly divided into the classical CNN-based and more recent DETR-based models     2.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
