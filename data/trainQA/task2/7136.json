      "content": "Paper Title: Saliency-Aware Regularized Graph Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSuccessful graph classification requires effective representation learning not only for each node but also for the entire graph. Existing methods based on graph neural networks  [ref]2 have achieved significant progress in node representation learning, benefiting from the excellent feature refinement through neighborhood aggregation for each node. Most of these methods focus on modeling the local dependencies between neighboring nodes when performing neighborhood aggregation. Prominent examples include GCN [ref]3 which aggregates neighborhood features by considering the node degree distribution, GraphSAGE [ref]4 as well as GIN  which seek to learn effective aggregating functions, and GAT  which employs an attention mechanism to learn aggregating weights. While these methods are able to learn effective node representations in a graph, they ignore the global saliency of each node, formulated as the semantic similarities between features of each node and the graph representation in a latent space. Nevertheless, it is crucial to perceive global node saliency for graph classification since different nodes potentially have different relevance. Noisy or irrelevant nodes may have adverse effects on graph classification. A straightforward way of modeling such global saliency is to employ attention mechanism to calculate the attention distribution, as SAGPool  and ChebyGIN  behave. However, such implicit modeling way has limited effectiveness since it estimates the attention scores solely based on local node features and lacks the explicit modeling of semantic similarities between each node and the global graph representation. Other typical methods of modeling global node saliency include Graphormer  interpreting node degrees as centrality, DGM 0 utilizing node connectivities to compute a lens function, and DGCNN 1 equating the graph convolution output with continuous Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) 2 for sorting nodes (termed ‘SortPooling’). Nevertheless, all these methods still suffer from the limitation that they do not explicitly measure the semantic similarities between each node and the global graph representation, which essentially characterizes the saliency. Another essential concern of graph classification is how to learn the effective representation for the entire graph. A commonly adopted approach by most existing methods based on graph neural networks 3 4 1 5 6, is to first learn node features and then aggregate all node features to produce the graph representation via a readout function, which is typically implemented by various pooling operations. Despite the simplicity of such approach, the obtained graph representation may have limited effectiveness. This is because most model capacity is allocated for learning node features rather than the graph representation, and the quality of obtained graph representation depends heavily on that of the node features. To address the above two potential limitations, in this work we propose the Saliency-Aware Regularized Graph Neural Network (SAR-GNN) for graph classification which is built upon traditional graph neural networks. It first measures the saliency of each node in a global view, namely the semantic similarities between each node and the graph representation, and then leverages the learned saliency distribution to regularize the graph neural network. Specifically, the SAR-GNN consists of two core modules: 1) a traditional graph neural network serving as the backbone for learning node features and 2) Graph Neural Memory which is designed to distill a compact graph representation for the entire graph from node features of the backbone. Both the backbone network and the Graph Neural Memory are iteratively stacked to refine node features and the graph representation progressively. The learned compact graph representation is used to estimate the global saliency of each node by measuring the semantic similarities between the graph representation and node features. Then the obtained saliency distribution is used to regularize the aggregating weights of the backbone network when performing neighborhood aggregation for each node, which facilitates the message passing of features for the salient nodes while suppressing the feature propagation for the less relevant nodes to graph classification. As a result, the Graph Neural Memory can distill more relevant features to graph classification from the salient nodes when learning the compact graph representation. Two modules work interdependently with interactions between each other in each stacked layer. The obtained compact graph representation is finally utilized for graph classification. To conclude, we highlight following contributions. We propose the Saliency-Aware Regularized Graph Neural Network (SAR-GNN), a novel framework for graph classification, which consists of two core modules: a backbone network for learning node features and the Graph Neural Memory for distilling the compact graph representation. Two modules are optimized interdependently with interactions between each other in each stacked layer and thus both the node features and the graph representation can be refined iteratively. Such framework enables the proposed SAR-GNN to model the global node saliencies in an explicit manner by measuring the semantic similarities between each node and the graph representation. We design an effective saliency-aware regularization mechanism, which utilizes the learned global node saliencies to regularize the feature aggregation for each node in such a way that it facilitates the message passing of features for the salient nodes while suppressing the feature propagation for the less relevant nodes to graph classification. As a result, the Graph Neural Memory can distill more relevant features to graph classification from the salient nodes and thereby produce more effective graph representation for graph classification. The proposed SAR-GNN can be readily applied to most of the existing graph neural networks which perform neighborhood aggregation for refining node features. In particular, we instantiate the backbone of our model with four classical types of graph neural networks, namely GCN, GraphSAGE, GIN and GAT respectively. Then we conduct extensive experiments both quantitatively and qualitatively on seven challenging datasets across various types of graph data, which demonstrate 1) the effectiveness of our method via thorough ablation studies and complexity analysis, and 2) the favorable performance of our model compared to the state-of-the-art methods for graph classification.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Successful graph classification requires effective representation learning not only for each node but also for the entire graph.
