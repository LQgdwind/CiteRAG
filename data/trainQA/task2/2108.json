      "content": "Paper Title: Upward planar drawings with two slopes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhen we visualize directed graphs (digraphs for short) that model hierarchical relations\nwith node-link diagrams,\nwe traditionally turn edge directions into geometric directions by letting each edge point upward.\nAiming for visual clarity, we would like such an upward drawing to be planar,\nthat is, no two edges should cross .\nIf this is possible, the resulting drawing is called upward planar drawing; see Figure 1 (a).\nInterestingly, as Di Battista and Tamassia  have shown,\nevery upward planar drawing can be turned into one where each edge is drawn with a single line segment;\nsuch a straight-line drawing may however require an exponentially large drawing area . Another important class of drawings are (planar) orthogonal drawings,\nwhere edges are drawn as sequences of horizontal and vertical line segments ; see Figure 1 (b).\nThis drawing style is commonly used for schematic drawings such as VLSI circuit design and UML diagrams.\nSchematic drawings that allow more than two slopes for edge segments include hexalinear and octilinear drawings,\nwhich find application in metro maps .\nIn general, the use of only few geometric primitives (such as different slopes)\nin a graph drawing facilitates a low visual complexity; a common quality measure for drawings . In recent years, the interest in upward planar drawings that use only few different slopes has grown.\nFor example, among other results, Bekos et al. [ref]4 showed\nthat every so-called bitonic s​t𝑠𝑡st-graph with maximum degree ΔΔ\\Delta\nadmits an upward planar drawing where every edge has at most one bend\nand the edges segments use only ΔΔ\\Delta distinct slopes.\nDi Giacomo et al.  provided complementary results\nby proving that also every series-parallel digraph admits a 1-bend upward planar drawing\non ΔΔ\\Delta distinct slopes; their drawings also have optimal angular resolution.\nBrückner et al. [ref]8 considered level-planar drawings,\nthat is, upward planar drawings\nwhere each vertex is drawn on a predefined integer y-coordinate (its level),\nwith a fixed slope set.\nIn this paper, we continue this recent trend.\nIn particular, we study bendless upward planar drawings that use only two different slopes.\nAn example of such a drawing is shown in Figure 1 (c).\nSome of our results can be extended to 1-bend upward planar drawings.\nWe now define these drawing concepts more precisely and list related work.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: a common quality measure for drawings . In recent years, the interest in upward planar drawings that use only few different slopes has grown.\nFor example, among other results, Bekos et al. [ref]4 showed\nthat every so-called bitonic s​t𝑠𝑡st-graph with maximum degree ΔΔ\\Delta\nadmits an upward planar drawing where every edge has at most one bend\nand the edges segments use only ΔΔ\\Delta\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
