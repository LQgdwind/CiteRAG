      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Playing Full MOBA Games with Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAn emerging problem brought by expanding the hero pool is drafting, a.k.a. hero pick or hero selection.\nBefore a MOBA match starts, two teams go through the process of picking heroes, which directly affects future strategies and match result.\nGiven a large hero pool, e.g., 40 heroes (more than 1011superscript101110^{11} combinations), a complete tree search method like the Minimax algorithm used in OpenAI Five  will be computationally intractable . To manage this, we develop a drafting agent leveraging Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS)  and neural networks.\nMCTS estimates the long-term value of each pick, and the hero with the maximum value will be picked.\nThe particular MCTS version we use is Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees (UCT) .\nWhen drafting, a search tree is built iteratively, with each node representing the state (which heroes have been picked by both teams) and each edge representing the action (pick a hero that has not been picked) resulting to a next state. The search tree is updated based on the four steps of MCTS for each iteration, i.e., selection, expansion, simulation, and backpropagation, during which the simulation step is the most time-consuming.\nTo speed up simulation, different from , we build a value network to predict the value of the current state directly instead of the inefficient random roll-out to get the reward for backpropagation, which is similar to AlphaGo Zero [ref]31.\nThe training data of the value network is collected via a simulated drafting process played by two drafting strategies based on MCTS.\nWhen training the value network, Monte-Carlo roll-out is still performed until reaching the terminal state, i.e., the end of the simulated drafting process.\nNote that, for board games like Chess and Go, the terminal state determines the winner of the match.\nHowever, the end of the drafting process is not the end of a MOBA match, so we cannot get match results directly.\nTo deal with this, we first build a match dataset via self-play using the RL model trained in Section 3.3, and then we train a neural predictor for predicting the win-rate of a particular lineup.\nThe predicted win-rate of the terminal state is used as the supervision signal for training the value network.\nThe architectures of the value network and the win-rate predictor are two separate 3-layer MLPs.\nFor the win-rate predictor, the input feature is the one-hot representation of the 10 heroes in a lineup, and the output is the win-rate ranged from 0 to 1.\nFor the value network, the input representation is the game state of the current lineup, containing one-hot indexes of picked heroes in the two teams, default indexes of unpicked heroes, and the index of the team which is currently picking, while the output is the value of the state.\nOn the other hand, the selection, expansion and backpropagation steps in our implementation are the same as the normal MCTS  .\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: from , we build a value network to predict the value of the current state directly instead of the inefficient random roll-out to get the reward for backpropagation, which is similar to AlphaGo Zero [ref]31.\nThe training data of the value network is collected via a simulated drafting process played by two drafting strategies based on MCTS.\nWhen training the value network, Monte-Carlo roll-out is\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
