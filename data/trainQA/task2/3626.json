      "content": "Paper Title: ScalableViT: Rethinking the Context-oriented Generalization of Vision Transformer\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) dominated the computer vision field last few years, which attributes to their capacity in modeling realistic images from a local to global perception.\nAlthough they have been widely applied in various vision tasks, there are still deficiencies in global visual perception.\nThis global view is essential for downstream tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation.\nRecently, ViT  and its follow-ups [ref]35 [ref]26 [ref]5  employed transformer encoders to address the image task and achieved comparable performance against their CNN counterparts because of the global receptive field.\nHowever, the global perception of the Transformer entails an unaffordable computation since self-attention (the primary operation of the Transformer) is quadratically computed on the whole sequence.\nTo alleviate this overhead, typical Swin transformer [ref]26 employed Window-based Self-Attention (WSA), which partitioned a feature map into many non-overlapped sub-regions and enabled it to process large-scale images with linear complexity. They also proposed a novel Shifted Window-based Self-Attention (SWSA) to compensate for losses of potential long-range dependency.\nTwins [ref]5 combined the WSA with Global Sub-sampled Attention (GSA) for better performance. To gain an insight into the WSA [ref]5 [ref]26, we visualize feature maps after the second block. As shown in Fig. 1, features captured by the WSA are dispersed, and their responses incline to partial rather than object-oriented.\nIt may attribute to an invariably fixed dimension that results in limited learning ability, thereby the final performance of the model being highly determined by the difficulty of input data.\nTo alleviate this problem, we develop a novel self-attention mechanism, termed Scalable Self-Attention (SSA), which simultaneously introduces two scaling factors (rnsubscript𝑟𝑛r_{n} and rcsubscript𝑟𝑐r_{c}) to spatial and channel dimensions. Namely, SSA selectively applies these factors to q​u​e​r​y𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑟𝑦query, k​e​y𝑘𝑒𝑦key, and v​a​l​u​e𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒value matrices (Q𝑄Q, K𝐾K, and V𝑉V), ensuring the dimension is more elastic and no longer deeply bound by the input.\nOn the one hand, SSA aggregates redundant tokens with similar semantic information to a more compact one via spatial scalability. Consequently, unnecessary intermediate multiplication operations are eliminated, and the computational complexity is reduced significantly.\nIn the third row of Fig. 1, we can easily observe that spatial scalability can bring nearly contiguous visual modeling for objects, but some contextual cues are still lost.\nHence, on the other hand, we expand the channel dimension to learn a more graphic representation.\nAs depicted in the last row of Fig. 1, SSA successfully obtains complete object activation while maintaining context-oriented generalization via channel scalability. For instance, the contextual cues of the cat in the last column are represented in detail.\nSuch scaling factors also restore the output dimension to align with the input, which makes the residual connection feasible. Moreover, we propose an Interactive Window-based Self-Attention (IWSA) that consists of a regular WSA and a local interactive module (LIM).\nThe IWSA establishes information connections by re-merging independent v​a​l​u​e𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒value tokens and aggregating spatial information from adjacent windows. Therefore, it no longer limits the self-attention to local windows, particularly non-overlapping windows.\nSuch characteristic enhances the desired global receptive field and takes good advantage of the most significant superiority of the Transformer in a single layer.\nThe effectiveness of LIM for WSA is validated in Tab. 5(b).\nTo achieve a more efficient backbone for general vision tasks, we adopt a hierarchical design   and propose a new Vision Transformer architecture, termed ScalableViT, which alternately arranges IWSA and SSA blocks in each stage. Main contributions of our ScalableViT lie in two aspects: For the global self-attention, we propose SSA to supply context-oriented generalization in the vanilla self-attention block, which significantly reduces computational overhead without sacrificing contextual expressiveness. For the local self-attention, we design LIM to enhance the global perception ability of WSA. Both SSA and IWSA can model long-range dependency in a single layer instead of stacking more self-attention layers; hence, the ScalableViT is more suitable for visual tasks.\nWe employ ScalableViT on several vision tasks, including image-level classification on ImageNet , pixel-level object detection and instance segmentation on COCO , and semantic segmentation on ADE20K . Extensive experiments demonstrate that the ScalableViT outperforms other state-of-the-art Vision Transformers with similar or less computational cost.\nFor example, ScalableViT-S achieves +1.4% gains against Twins-SVT-S and +1.8% gains against Swin-T on ImageNet-1K classification.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: there are still deficiencies in global visual perception.\nThis global view is essential for downstream tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation.\nRecently, ViT  and its follow-ups [ref]35 [ref]26 [ref]5  employed transformer encoders to address the image task and achieved comparable performance against their CNN counterparts because of the global receptive field.\nHowever, the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
