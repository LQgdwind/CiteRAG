The ACDC dataset includes 200 cardiac cine MRI scans from 100 patients with annotations including three segmentation classes (i.e., left ventricle (LV), myocardium (Myo), and right ventricle (RV)). Following 6 7, we use 140, 20, and 60 scans for training, validation, and testing, respectively. The LiTS dataset includes 131 contrast-enhanced 3D abdominal CT volumes with annotations of two segmentation classes (i.e., liver and tumor). Following 3, we use the first 100 volumes for training, and the rest 31 for testing. For pre-processing, we follow the setting in  to normalize the intensity of each 3D scans, resample all 2D slices and the corresponding segmentation maps to a fixed spatial resolution (i.e., 256√ó256 pixels). To quantitatively assess the performance of our proposed method, we report two popular metrics: Dice coefficient (DSC) and Average Surface Distance (ASD) for 3D segmentation results. \n\n\n\n\n\n3 Labeled\n\n7 Labeled\n\nMethod\nAverage\nRV\nMyo\nLV\nAverage\nRV\nMyo\nLV\n\nUNet-F 2\n91.5/0.996\n90.5/0.606\n88.8/0.941\n94.4/1.44\n91.5/0.996\n90.5/0.606\n88.8/0.941\n94.4/1.44\n\nUNet-L\n51.7/13.1\n36.9/30.1\n54.9/4.27\n63.4/5.11\n79.5/2.73\n65.9/0.892\n82.9/2.70\n89.6/4.60\n\nEM 6\n59.8/5.64\n44.2/11.1\n63.2/3.23\n71.9/2.57\n75.7/2.73\n68.0/0.892\n76.5/2.70\n82.7/4.60\n\nCCT 8\n59.1/10.1\n44.6/19.8\n63.2/6.04\n69.4/4.32\n75.9/3.60\n67.2/2.90\n77.5/3.32\n82.9/0.734\n\nDAN 7\n56.4/15.1\n47.1/21.7\n58.1/11.6\n63.9/11.9\n76.5/3.01\n75.7/2.61\n73.3/3.11\n80.5/3.31\n\nURPC 7\n58.9/8.14\n50.1/12.6\n60.8/4.10\n65.8/7.71\n73.2/2.68\n67.0/0.742\n72.2/0.505\n80.4/6.79\n\nDCT 1\n58.5/10.8\n41.2/21.4\n63.9/5.01\n70.5/6.05\n78.1/2.64\n70.7/1.75\n77.7/2.90\n85.8/3.26\n\nICT 5\n59.0/6.59\n48.8/11.4\n61.4/4.59\n66.6/3.82\n80.6/1.64\n75.1/0.898\n80.2/1.53\n86.6/2.48\n\nMT 3\n58.3/11.2\n39.0/21.5\n58.7/7.47\n77.3/4.72\n80.1/2.33\n75.2/1.22\n79.2/2.32\n86.0/3.45\n\nUAMT 6\n61.0/7.03\n47.8/15.9\n65.0/2.38\n70.1/2.83\n77.6/3.15\n70.5/0.81\n78.4/4.36\n83.9/4.29\n\nCPS \n61.0/2.92\n43.8/2.95\n64.5/2.84\n74.8/2.95\n78.8/3.41\n74.0/1.95\n78.1/3.11\n84.5/5.18\n\nGCL \n70.6/2.24\n56.5/1.99\n70.7/1.67\n84.8/3.05\n87.0/0.751\n86.9/0.584\n81.8/0.821\n92.5/0.849\n\nSCS [ref]9\n73.6/5.37\n63.5/6.23\n76.6/2.42\n80.7/7.45\n84.2/2.01\n81.4/0.850\n83.0/2.03\n88.2/3.12\n\n‚àô‚àô\\bullet‚ÄâACTION (ours)\n87.5/1.12\n85.4/0.915\n85.8/0.784\n91.2/1.66\n89.7/0.736\n89.8/0.589\n86.7/0.813\n92.7/0.804\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n5% Labeled\n\n10% Labeled\n\nMethod\nAverage\nLiver\nTumor\nAverage\nLiver\nTumor\n\nUNet-F 2\n68.2/16.9\n90.6/8.14\n45.8/25.6\n68.2/16.9\n90.6/8.14\n45.8/25.6\n\nUNet-L\n60.4/30.4\n87.5/9.84\n33.3/50.9\n61.6/28.3\n85.4/18.6\n37.9/37.9\n\nEM 6\n61.2/33.3\n87.7/9.47\n34.7/57.1\n62.9/38.5\n87.4/21.3\n38.3/55.7\n\nCCT 8\n60.6/48.7\n85.5/27.9\n35.6/69.4\n63.8/31.2\n90.3/7.25\n37.2/55.1\n\nDAN 7\n62.3/25.8\n88.6/9.64\n36.1/42.1\n63.2/30.7\n87.3/15.4\n39.1/46.1\n\nURPC 7\n62.4/37.8\n86.7/21.6\n38.0/54.0\n63.0/43.1\n88.1/24.3\n38.9/61.9\n\nDCT 1\n60.8/34.4\n89.2/12.6\n32.5/56.2\n61.9/31.7\n86.2/19.3\n37.5/44.1\n\nICT 5\n60.1/39.1\n86.8/12.6\n33.3/65.6\n62.5/32.4\n88.1/16.7\n36.9/48.2\n\nMT 3\n61.9/40.0\n86.7/21.6\n37.2/58.4\n63.3/26.2\n89.7/11.6\n36.9/40.8\n\nUAMT 6\n61.0/47.0\n86.9/22.1\n35.2/71.8\n62.3/26.0\n87.4/7.55\n37.3/44.4\n\nCPS \n62.1/36.0\n87.3/17.9\n36.8/54.0\n64.0/23.6\n90.2/10.6\n37.8/36.7\n\nGCL \n63.3/20.1\n90.7/9.46\n35.9/30.8\n65.0/37.2\n91.3/10.0\n38.7/64.3\n\nSCS [ref]9\n61.5/28.8\n92.6/7.21\n30.4/50.3\n64.6/33.9\n91.6/5.72\n37.6/62.0\n\n‚àô‚àô\\bullet‚ÄâACTION (ours)\n66.8/17.7\n93.0/6.04\n40.5/29.4\n67.7/20.4\n92.8/5.08\n42.6/35.8\n\n Implementation Details¬†¬†\nAll our models are implemented in PyTorch 9. We train all methods with SGD optimizer (learning rate=0.010.010.01, momentum=0.90.90.9, weight decay=0.00010.00010.0001, batch size=666). All models are trained with two NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPUs. Stage-iùëñi and i‚Äãiùëñùëñii are trained with 100 epochs, and Stage-i‚Äãi‚Äãiùëñùëñùëñiii is with 200 epochs. We use the temperature of teacher and student as œÑt=0.01subscriptùúèùë°0.01\\tau_{t}\\!=\\!0.01 and œÑs=0.1subscriptùúèùë†0.1\\tau_{s}\\!=\\!0.1.

The memory bank size is 36. We follow the standard augmentation strategies in . In Stage-iùëñi, we train Essubscriptùê∏ùë†E_{s}, Etsubscriptùê∏ùë°E_{t}, Htgsuperscriptsubscriptùêªùë°ùëîH_{t}^{g}, Hsgsuperscriptsubscriptùêªùë†ùëîH_{s}^{g}, and HpgsuperscriptsubscriptùêªùëùùëîH_{p}^{g} on the unlabeled data with global-level ‚Ñícontrastsubscript‚Ñícontrast\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{contrast}} in Equation 3. We follow [ref]9 to use a MLP as heads, and the setting of the predictors is similar to , which has a feature dimension of 512512512. In Stage-i‚Äãiùëñùëñii, we train Fssubscriptùêπùë†F_{s}, Ftsubscriptùêπùë°F_{t}, Htlsuperscriptsubscriptùêªùë°ùëôH_{t}^{l}, Hslsuperscriptsubscriptùêªùë†ùëôH_{s}^{l}, and HplsuperscriptsubscriptùêªùëùùëôH_{p}^{l} on the labeled and unlabeled data. We train with the supervised loss 6 on labeled data, and local-level ‚Ñícontrastsubscript‚Ñícontrast\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{contrast}} in Equation 3 on unlabeled data. Given the logits output y^‚àà‚ÑùC√óh√ów^ùë¶superscript‚Ñùùê∂‚Ñéùë§\\hat{y}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{C\\times h\\times w}, we use the 1√ó1111\\times 1 convolutional layer to project all pixels into the latent space with the feature dimension of 512512512, and the output feature dimension of Gùê∫G is also 512512512. As for Stage-i‚Äãi‚Äãiùëñùëñùëñiii, we train Fssubscriptùêπùë†F_{s}, Ftsubscriptùêπùë°F_{t}, Htsubscriptùêªùë°H_{t}, Hssubscriptùêªùë†H_{s}, and HrsubscriptùêªùëüH_{r} on the labeled and unlabeled data. We use the supervised segmentation loss on labeled data, unsupervised cross-entropy loss (on pseudo-labels generated by a confidence threshold Œ∏ssubscriptùúÉùë†\\theta_{s}), and ‚Ñíancosubscript‚Ñíanco\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{anco}} in Equation 4 on unlabeled data. We then adaptively sample 256 query samples and 512 key samples for each mini-batch, and temperature for the student and confidence thresholds are set to œÑs=0.5subscriptùúèùë†0.5\\tau_{s}=0.5 and Œ∏s=0.97subscriptùúÉùë†0.97\\theta_{s}=0.97, respectively. Of note, the projection heads, the predictor, and the representation decoder head are only utilized during the training, and will be removed during the inference. Main Results¬†¬†\nWe compare our proposed method to previous state-of-the-art SSL methods using 2D Unet 2 as backbone, including UNet trained with full/limited supervisions (UNet-F/UNet-L), EM 6, CCT 8, DAN 7, URPC 7, DCT 1, ICT 5, MT 3, UAMT 6, CPS , SCS [ref]9, and GCL .\nTable 1 shows the evaluation results on ACDC dataset under two unlabeled settings (3 or 7 labeled cases). ACTION can substantially improve results on two unlabeled settings, greatly outperforming the previous state-of-the-art SSL methods. Specifically, our ACTION, trained on 3 labeled cases, dramatically improves the previous best averaged Dice score from 73.6% to 87.5% by a large margin, and even matches previous SSL methods using 7 labeled cases. When using 7 labeled cases, ACTION further pushes the state-of-the-art results to 89.7% in Dice. We observe that the gains are more pronounced on the two categories(i.e., RV and Myo), and our ACTION achieves 89.8% and 86.7% in terms of Dice, performing competitive or even better than the supervised baseline (89.2% and 86.7%). As shown in Figure 3, we can see the clear advantage of ACTION, where the boundaries of different regions are clearly sharper and more accurate such as RV and Myo regions. Table 2 also shows the evaluation results on LiTS dataset under two unlabeled settings (5% or 10% labeled cases). On both two labeled settings, ACTION significantly outperforms all the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin. As shown in Figure 4, ACTION achieves consistently sharp and accurate object boundaries compared to other SSL methods. Ablation on Different Components¬†¬†\nWe investigate the impact of different components in ACTION. All reported results in this section are based on the ACDC dataset under the 3 labeled setting.\nTable 3 shows the ablation result of our model. Upon our choice of architecture, we first consider a na√Øve baseline (BYOL) without any random sampled images (RSI), stage-i‚Äãiùëñùëñii, and stage-i‚Äãi‚Äãiùëñùëñùëñiii, denoted by (1) Vanilla. Then, we consider a wide range of different settings for improved representation learning: (2) incorporating other random sampled images; (3) no stage-i‚Äãiùëñùëñii; (4) no other random sampled images and stage-i‚Äãiùëñùëñii; (5) no stage-i‚Äãi‚Äãiùëñùëñùëñiii; since stage-i‚Äãi‚Äãiùëñùëñùëñiii includes two losses, (6) no ‚Ñíancosubscript‚Ñíanco\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{anco}}, (7) no ‚Ñíunsupsubscript‚Ñíunsup\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{unsup}}, and (8) our proposed ACTION. As shown in Table 3, it is notable that ACTION performs generally better than other evaluated baselines. We find that only applying any single component of ACTION often comes at the cost of performance degradation. The intuitions behind are as follows: (1) incorporating other random sampled images will enforce the diversity of the sampled data, preventing redundant anatomically and semantically similar samples; (2) using stage-i‚Äãiùëñùëñii leads to worse performance without considering local context; (3) using stage-i‚Äãi‚Äãiùëñùëñùëñiii enables a robust segmentation model to learn better representations with few human annotations. Using the above components confers a significant advantage at representation learning, and further illustrates the benefit of each component. Ablation on Different Augmentations¬†¬†\nWe investigate the impact of using weak or strong augmentations for ACTION on the ACDC dataset under 3 labeled setting. We summarize the effects of different data augmentation strategies in Table 4. We apply weak augmentation to the teacher‚Äôs input, including rotation, cropping, flipping, and strong augmentation to the student‚Äôs input, including rotation, cropping, flipping, random contrast, and brightness changes 0. Empirically, we find that when using weak and strong augmentation strategies on the teacher and student network, the network performance is optimal.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: 61.0/2.92\n43.8/2.95\n64.5/2.84\n74.8/2.95\n78.8/3.41\n74.0/1.95\n78.1/3.11\n84.5/5.18\n\nGCL \n70.6/2.24\n56.5/1.99\n70.7/1.67\n84.8/3.05\n87.0/0.751\n86.9/0.584\n81.8/0.821\n92.5/0.849\n\nSCS [ref]9\n73.6/5.37\n63.5/6.23\n76.6/2.42\n80.7/7.45\n84.2/2.01\n81.4/0.850\n83.0/2.03\n88.2/3.12\n\n‚àô‚àô\\bullet‚ÄâACTION\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
