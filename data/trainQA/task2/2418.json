      "content": "Paper Title: Untangling Dense Non-Planar Knots by Learning Manipulation Features and Recovery Policies\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo the best of our knowledge, Lui and Saxena [ref]19 is the first published study of robot cable untying. The authors use RGB-D sensing and classical feature extraction to approximate a tangled cable as a graph consisting of cable crossings and endpoints. We primarily build upon the work of Grannen et al. [ref]7, which (1) presents a geometric algorithm for cable untangling based on the graphical abstraction from Lui and Saxena [ref]19 and (2) uses deep learning to detect cable crossings with keypoint inference. These keypoints serve as input to a greedy action planner that iteratively reduces the number of crossings. Lui and Saxena [ref]19 and Grannen et al. [ref]7 present algorithms for generating untangling manipulation plans for cables with semiplanar knots. However, their executed controllers are based on a set of analytical motion primitives, which make simplified assumptions about cable geometry that do not hold in highly deformed or occluded states. In this work, we focus on the problem of learning a controller to robustly execute the manipulation plans generated by Grannen et al. [ref]7. First, in adapting the method to a more challenging class of knots, we employ coarse-to-fine refinement strategies to perform robust cable grasping. Several recent works have also studied coarse-to-fine controllers for manipulation tasks requiring precision, including surgical peg transfer [ref]22 and peg insertion  . Secondly, we explore recovery from manipulation-induced errors in the context of closed-loop untangling. Recent work has also considered recovery from manipulation errors in contact-based robotics tasks   . However, these works do not exploit task geometry, which is particularly relevant to cable untangling.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: To the best of our knowledge, Lui and Saxena [ref]19 is the first published study of robot cable untying.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
