      "content": "Paper Title: Adversarial Robustness Assessment of NeuroEvolution Approaches\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAdversarial examples are maliciously crafted so as to make an attacked model produce incorrect outputs  [ref]22. Throughout the years, several methods have been proposed in the literature to craft such attacks, under different threat models. These threat models can be defined based on the goals, knowledge, and capabilities of the adversary [ref]10. A distinction can be made based on the adversary’s knowledge about the model: architecture and parameters, training algorithm and training data, randomness at test-time, and allowed level of query access [ref]23. In this work, we focus on white-box attacks, where the adversary has full access to the model. A further distinction can be made between untargeted and targeted attacks. In the particular case of image classification tasks, the goal of untargeted attacks is simply to make the model predict a class different from the true label of a given instance, while the goal of targeted attacks is to make the model produce a misclassification into some desired class .\nFormally, x𝑥x is an input with correct label y𝑦y and C𝐶C is the classifier under attack. In the untargeted setting, an adversarial example xa​d​vsuperscript𝑥𝑎𝑑𝑣x^{adv} is such that C​(xa​d​v)≠y𝐶superscript𝑥𝑎𝑑𝑣𝑦C(x^{adv})\\neq y. On the other hand, a targeted attack would aim at crafting xa​d​vsuperscript𝑥𝑎𝑑𝑣x^{adv} given a target t≠y𝑡𝑦t\\neq y such that C​(xa​d​v)=t𝐶superscript𝑥𝑎𝑑𝑣𝑡C(x^{adv})=t. An adversarial example is usually obtained by adding some perturbation δ𝛿\\delta to a benign image [ref]22. Constraints are usually imposed on the capabilities of the adversary in terms of the maximum perturbation that can be added, so that xa​d​vsuperscript𝑥𝑎𝑑𝑣x^{adv} remains close to the original input and its true label remains unchanged [ref]10.\nIn the image domain, a common approach is to use Lpsubscript𝐿𝑝L_{p}-norms for those bounds such that ‖x−xa​d​v‖p≤ϵsubscriptnorm𝑥superscript𝑥𝑎𝑑𝑣𝑝italic-ϵ\\left\\|x-x^{adv}\\right\\|_{p}\\leq\\epsilon, where ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon is the perturbation budget and usually p∈{0,1,2,∞}𝑝012p\\in\\left\\{0,1,2,\\infty\\right\\} [ref]10 . Optimization-based methods are an important category of white-box attacks. Some of such methods try to minimize the perturbation, while others try to maximize some loss function (typically the cross-entropy loss) [ref]23 .\nWe present some of the latter methods assuming an untargeted setting. The fast gradient sign method (FGSM)  is a one-step gradient-based attack optimized for the L∞subscript𝐿L_{\\infty}-norm which generates an adversarial example as: where ∇xL​(x,y)subscript∇𝑥𝐿𝑥𝑦\\nabla_{x}L(x,y) is the gradient of the cross-entropy loss with respect to the input image. When this method is optimized for the L2subscript𝐿2L_{2}-norm, we obtain the fast gradient method (FGM) which generates an adversarial example as: In both cases, the perturbed image should be clipped in order to maintain a valid data range. We present the methods that follow for L∞subscript𝐿L_{\\infty} adversaries, but these definitions can be easily adapted to the case where L2subscript𝐿2L_{2} bounds are imposed, similar to what is done with FGM. A straightforward extension of the FGSM attack is to take multiple small steps (with step size α𝛼\\alpha) and clip the result by ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon at each iteration. The clipping operation also takes into account the valid range of data values. This results in the basic iterative method (BIM)  which can be defined as: The projected gradient descent (PGD) method  is another iterative attack which only differs from BIM on how x0a​d​vsubscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑎𝑑𝑣0x^{adv}_{0} is set. In the case of PGD, instead of starting from the original input, a random perturbation bounded by ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon is generated and added to x𝑥x. In an attempt to stabilize the update directions and escape from local optima, the momentum iterative fast gradient sign method (MI-FGSM)  incorporates momentum  into the BIM method.\nThe Auto-PGD (APGD) method  is a variation of the PGD attack which adjusts the step size in an automated way. The authors of APGD also proposed an alternative to the cross-entropy loss called difference of logits ratio (DLR) loss. In addition to being invariant to shifts of the logits, the DLR loss is rescaling invariant . Adversarial robustness evaluations typically consist of performing adversarial attacks to obtain an upper bound of the robustness of a model . One resorts to this approximation since computing it exactly is usually intractable [ref]10 . Several defenses against adversarial examples have been proposed in the literature. Such defenses tend to be designed to be robust to one specific threat model [ref]10. Adversarial training , and variants like ensemble adversarial training , have shown the most promising results when it comes to increasing the robustness of models. The main idea behind these methods is to incorporate adversarial examples in the training procedure of a model. Many of the other methods were circumvented shortly after their proposal [ref]23 .\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: Adversarial examples are maliciously crafted so as to make an attacked model produce incorrect outputs  [ref]22.
