      "content": "Paper Title: A Survey on Graph Neural Networks and Graph Transformers in Computer Vision: A Task-Oriented Perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPointNet [ref]213 is a pioneering work for point cloud representation learning. It is a point-based method that takes the input point cloud as an unordered point set and conducts feature aggregation in a local query ball with a pre-defined radius via a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Graph-based approaches characterize the input point cloud as a graph and apply a GNN or graph transformer to encourage local or global interaction among points. A basic solution to graph construction on a point cloud is to represent every point as a vertex, and connect every vertex to its nearest neighbors in the Euclidean space, e.g. a K-nearest neighbor (KNN) graph   [ref]124 .\nA pioneering graph-based approach, ECC , generalizes convolutions on regular grids to point cloud based graphs. ECC computes adaptive convolution kernel weights using specific edge labels in the neighborhood of a vertex so that edge information can be better utilized than in point-based convolutions. A recent work, AdaptConv , also focuses on generating adaptive kernels but according to learned features.\nIn the above methods, the graph structure is determined by the input point cloud, more specifically, local point neighborhoods, which limits flexibility and non-local relation modeling. To address these issues, DGCNN [ref]124 designs an EdgeConv operator and proposes to construct graphs in the feature space and dynamically update graphs in each layer so that both global and local interactions can be flexibly captured. In addition, region-level semantic affinity can be attended implicitly to benefit point cloud representation learning. The network structure of DGCNN is shown in Fig. 10. In subsequent work following ECC and DGCNN, graph convolutions in the spatial domain have been explored further. LDGCNN  improves DGCNN via linking hierarchical features from different dynamic graphs to calculate informative edge vectors. KCNet  learns local geometric structures on the basis of kernel correlation and graph pooling. Hassani et al.  propose a multi-scale graph-based encoder together with an unsupervised multi-task learning framework. ClusterNet  alleviates the problem of rotation vulnerability in point cloud representation learning. 3D-GCN  develops deformable kernels to learn shift and scale-invariant point features.\nSPH3D-GCN [ref]223 proposes a spherical convolution kernel that partitions each neighborhood into bins around a center point to support efficient discrete graph convolution.\nDifferent from the mainstream approach, a random walk based method is proposed in  to generate sequences of point segments as non-local descriptors to better depict point cloud geometry. In contrast to the aforementioned works performing graph processing operations in the spatial domain, spectral methods build on a mathematically elegant approach that defines graph convolutions as spectral filtering, that relies on the eigen-decomposition of the graph Laplacian         . LocalSpecGCN  performs spectral filtering on dynamically built local graphs while recursively clustering spectral coordinates to support graph pooling, which improves PointNet++  via alleviating point isolation during learning, and also addresses the limitation of traditional spectral GCNs that the graph Laplacian and pooling hierarchy need to be pre-computed for the full graph.\nAGCN  improves the generalization ability and flexibility of GCNs by adaptively constructing graphs with task-driven structures.\nIn HGNN , a hyperedge convolution operation is designed to learn high-order data correlation for representing the complex structure in a point cloud. Instead of using a fixed view for each point cloud, DiffConv  is operated under adaptive views to match local point cloud density.\nWiersma et al.  designed a graph-based anistropic convolutional operator by combining a set of gemetric operators defined on scalar and vector fields to encode the directional information of each surface point. In addition to graph convolution based methods, another line of work aims to improve graph attention neural networks for point cloud analysis    . In such work, during graph feature aggregation, attention weights are computed from both neighbors’ positions and learnable features to adaptively attend important graph nodes or regions. In addition, graph-RNN is explored in  to consider relations between both spatially and temporally neighboring points for point cloud sequence analysis. As transformers have been extensively explored in computer vision, graph-based transformers designed for 3D point cloud representation learning have also been proposed  . The core mechanism of transformers, self-attention, naturally enables the network to build and represent global relations. PT  computes self-attention on local K-nearest-neighbor graphs, which leads to high-quality local representations while global relations are captured in deep layers. In comparison, PCT  adapts global self-attention to learn both local and non-local interactions, which sacrifices computational efficiency for representation capability.\nRecently, Lu et al.  further proposed 3DCTN to combine a transformer and graph convolutions to achieve both efficient and powerful 3D point representations. As the agglomeration process of point clouds (including point sampling, grouping, and pooling) is complex, some methods   [ref]223   have been proposed for simplifying the procedure or promoting the efficiency. The performance of some GNN-based algorithms on the point cloud classification task is given in Tab. V for a comparison with non-GNN-based ones [ref]213  .\n\nReference markers found: [213]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]213: PointNet [ref]213 is a pioneering work for point cloud representation learning.
