      "content": "Paper Title: Morpho-evolution with learning using a controller archive as an inheritance mechanism\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAmong the numerous studies in the field of evolutionary robotics, the majority address either the evolution of the body-plan alone or the evolution of the controller alone. This section focuses on literature which describes methods for the joint optimisation of body-plans and controllers. We focus attention on approaches that permit the evolution of offspring that require a controller topology that is different to either parent. That is, methods which evolve changes to morphology that do not impact the topology of controller (i.e. the number of inputs and outputs of a neural controller) are out of scope. For example, this excludes work in which morphological change is restricted to repositioning sensors  or altering the length, weight and size of leg-joints, e.g. [ref]12 [ref]13  [ref]15.\nWe first discuss methods that create controllers that are directly correlated to a specific type of body-plan, followed by morphology-independent methods, i.e. those that are capable of generating a controller for any given body-plan. A na√Øve approach to avoiding a potential mismatch between a controller and body-plan is to evolve only the body-plan and then learn a new controller with the correct topology from scratch for each child body-plan. The work of Gupta et al  follows this approach by using evolution for the body-plans and reinforcement learning to optimize the controllers for simulated robots composed from articulated 3D rigid parts connected via motor actuated hinge joints. Learning starts from a randomly initialised controller for each body-plan, and uses a distributed implementation across multiple CPU to minimise computational cost.\nLia et al.  also proposed a similar nested optimisation process, with the aim of finding the best morphology for a walker micro-robot. Here, Bayesian optimisation is used to learn the controller. However, despite Bayesian optimisation being known to be sample efficient, it only works well for small parameter spaces . Instead of learning from scratch, an alternative approach is to use a morphology-independent control generation mechanism that can generate control parameters for any given body-plan.\nFor example, Cheney et al   evolved soft-robots built from voxels, in which each voxel has a parameterised local controller. Both body-plans and controller parameters are outputs of two separate compositional pattern producing networks (CPPN) , both of which was evolved via the well known neuro-evolution with augmenting topology (NEAT) algorithm. However, due the distributed nature of the controller, the variety of possible behaviours for the same body-plan is limited.\nSims  also used a decentralised form of control. They proposed a genotype that contains a nested graph: the graph specifies morphological nodes describing the robot shape, each of which contains another graph specifying the neural circuitry for that node. More recent work has achieved a similar effect with the use of Lindenmayer-Systems (L-systems) decoding instead of a graph-representation, e.g.   . In the latter work , an additional learning mechanism was applied to improve the inherited brains of newborn robots: the authors showed that learning not only influences the morphology of the resulting robots, but that also, the capacity to learn increases over generations. Jelisavcic et al.  also employed a learning mechanism. Their genome carried a pool of CPPNs which can be used to specify the weights of a controller generated to match the child body-plan. Differently to the work of Cheney et al which encoded a single CPPN that undergoes evolution, here a child inherited a subset of CPPNs from each parent, then a learning algorithm (HyperNEAT) was applied to the inherited pool to evolve a new pool. The process was thus Lamarckian. To summarise, in the context of combined optimisation of body and control, on the one hand the literature has shown that using generative encodings (with and without additional learning) can mitigate the issues arising regarding inheritance of controllers that might not be applicable to a new child body-plan. However, these methods often require many evaluations to converge  and add additional hyper-parameters which may be difficult to optimise. On the other hand, neural controller encodings which are explicitly tied to a body-plan can be rapidly optimised as they only require weight optimisation rather than topology. Although they often cannot be inherited, this can be addressed by learning a controller from scratch, e.g. as in , although at the expense of ignoring any previously learned knowledge. In this paper, we choose to use a fixed structure neural network for reasons of efficiency, motivated by the goal of eventually evolving directly in hardware. As in previous works, we use a learning algorithm to optimise a controller that has a fixed structure that matches the new body-plan . However, in order to avoid starting from scratch for each body-plan as in previous work, we introduce a novel method for storing past solutions that can be accessed by the learning algorithm to bootstrap learning. This takes the form of an archive that stores the weights of a controller for each ‚Äòtype‚Äô of robot that has previously been encountered as described in the previous section. This archive or ‚Äòbrain pool‚Äô is dynamically composed and adapted during the evolutionary process. Note that the term archive should not be confused with other uses of the word in the wider evolutionary literature. For example, archives are commonly used in multi-objective optimisation to either drive the population toward the Pareto front or to maintain the population diversity, that is, they directly interact with an evolving population. Our approach has more in common with methods which try and enhance a search process by re-using past experience gained when solving related problems. For example, Louis and McDonnell  maintained a store of past solutions from similar instances which are periodically injected into an evolving population. However their approach is only applicable if instances share structural properties, hence cannot be applied to controllers with different topologies. Feng et al  attempted to reuse structured common knowledge captured in the optimized solutions of past search experiences in a form independent of solution representation, however their specific implementation was tailored to combinatorial optimisation. Here, we draw inspiration from  in maintaining an archive of past solutions. Extending this concept, we store solutions with different types, corresponding to different controller topologies, organised in the form of a grid. While our use of a grid-based container to organise solutions according to set of features resembles the quality-diversity algorithm MAP-Elites , the role of the archive in our work is different: (1) in MAP-Elites, the grid is first filled using a randomly generated solutions, which form a population; (2) the population is acted on by an evolutionary process that performs mutation and/or crossover to generate new solutions which are projected back to the grid. In our work, the archive does not act as a population but as a library. Cells are only filled with a controller if and when a particular ‚Äòtype‚Äô is generated by the MEA. A single controller from the library is selected to initialise a separate learning algorithm. In summary, the processing of filling cells is governed by the MEA, while the stored controllers are used to inform the learning algorithm.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: neural controller) are out of scope.
