      "content": "Paper Title: Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction via Recursive Hierarchy-Interactive Attention and Entity-Order Perception\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVarious large-scale knowledge bases (KBs), including YAGO , Freebase  and DBpedia , are extremely supportive of many sub-tasks in the field of natural language processing (NLP). However, although existing KBs contain a large number of facts, they are still far from complete compared to the real-world facts, which is infinite. To enrich KBs, many methods have been proposed to automatically extract fact triples from unstructured texts, i.e., relation extraction (RE).\nAmong these, supervised approaches are the most commonly used methods and yield relatively high performance. But existing supervised RE systems require massive training data, especially when using neural networks. Furthermore, obtaining high-quality and large-scale training data is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this case, distant supervision (DS) is proposed to automatically label training instances by matching KBs to the corpus . It assumes that given a pair of entities, all sentences contain these two entities will express the relation between them in KBs. The assumption is too strong and results in some problems. First, wrong labeling problem is inevitable and has become a bottleneck limiting models’ performance by introducing noisy supervision signals. For instance, <Phil Amicone, Yonkers>expresses the /people/person/place_of_birth relation in Freebase. So, the sentence “Mayor Phil Amicone of Yonkers and the board of Education have supported Mr. Petrone during the controversy.” will be automatically labeled as a training sentence, even though it does not express this type of relation. To mitigate the impact of noise labels, multi-instance learning (MIL)   is proposed to identify a relation label for a sentence-bag containing two common entities. Then, many techniques have been introduced into distantly supervised relation extraction (DSRE) task, such as multiple perspectives’ attention  [ref]8 , soft-labeling 0, reinforcement learning 1 2, etc. Among these, the attention mechanism is the most common and successful, so we also extend this technique. Second, although DS method can generate large-scale training data, it can only cover a limited part of real-world relations and causes long-tail problem. For example, in NYT dataset, nearly 77% of the relations are long-tail. Here a relation is long-tail if the number of corresponding training instances is less 1000. In this case, data imbalance severely limits the performance of RE systems.\nRecently, some approaches naturally share the knowledge from data-rich relations to long-tail ones by leveraging relation hierarchies 3 4 5 6. It is based on the observation that although some relations are long-tailed, their ancestor or sibling relations are not. Therefore long-tail relations can benefit from their ancestors or siblings. For example, we select some relations from Freebase and illustrate them in Figure 1. Note that we add a root node to facilitate the narrative.\nIt can be seen that the relation /business/company/founders has two ancestor relations (i.e., /business and /business/company) and several siblings (i.e., /business/company/advisors, /business/company/locations, etc.). And all relations form a taxonomic structure. With it,\nHan et al. 3 propose a hierarchical attention scheme to generate extra bag-level features for each relation level of relation hierarchies separately. Then Zhang et al. 4 enrich the relation embeddings with TransE 7 and graph convolutional networks 8. After that, Li et al. 5 propose an attention-based method to enhance sentence representations for each relation level independently, while Yu et al. 6 design a Top-Down classification strategy along the relation hierarchies. However, the above methods all use each relation level of relation hierarchies independently, i.e., although they use multi-grained relation levels to generate extra features or enrich sentence representations, these levels are discrete, independent and do not affect each other in the calculation. In fact, along the hierarchical relation chains, higher-level relations must be instructive to the lower ones. For example, the sentence “Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin on September 4, 1998.” expresses the relation /business/company/founders. When classifying along the hierarchical relation chains, if it is identified as /business at the first level, then at the second level, we can select labels only from the child relations of /business. Keep going down until the end of chains, the final label is obtained. During this process, the heuristic effect between relation levels is reflected in layer-by-layer narrowing the scope of the current level’s labels based on the classification probability of previous level. It can also be seen as a continuous refinement from coarse to fine granularity.\nDistinguishing from existing studies, we aim to implicitly model the heuristic effect through interactions between relation levels, which is one of the most prominent contributions of this paper.\nConsidering further, modeling these interactions is somewhat equivalent to exploiting the taxonomic structure of relations to uncover the correlation of relations, which can improve inter-relational discrimination from the side. Besides, as we all know, the fact triple <e1,r,e2><e_{1},r,e_{2}> is not equal with <e2,r,e1><e_{2},r,e_{1}>, therefore the appearance order of two entities is extremely crucial. But during sentence encoding, each feature map generated by CNN/PCNN only retain 1 or 3 maximums along the word sequence through pooling operation. This process ignores the importance of entity order and causes the loss of entity order information, i.e., entity order features are underutilized in the deep learning paradigm. In this paper, we firstly propose a novel network, named as Recursive Hierarchy-Interactive Attention (RHIA), to fully exploit the relation hierarchies. It assumes that along the hierarchical relation chains, lower-level relations are influenced by the higher-level ones and current known information. Based on this, we leverage a recursive structure along the chains to deliver heuristic information about higher-level relations, and obtain the relation-augmented sentence representations.\nThen we design a new attention pooling module by using the final hidden state to generate bag-level representations. Besides, to retain more entity-order information in sentence representations, an effective training objective, called Entity-Order Perception (EOP), is introduced.\nOur key contributions are summarized as follows: We take the heuristic effect between relation hierarchies into account, then a novel network, called RHIA, is proposed to model this heuristics. It is the first approach in DSRE to uncover the heuristic effect between relation levels in relation hierarchies. A newfangled training objective, called EOP, is introduced to improve the expressive ability of sentence encoder. It enables the sentence representations to retain more entity-order information. We conduct substantial evaluation on the widely-used benchmark NYT, and receive state-of-the-art performance in multiple metrics. Insightful analysis also verifies the capability and effectiveness of our RHIA-EOP. The code is released at https://github.com/RidongHan/RHIA-EOP.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: for a sentence-bag containing two common entities.
