      "content": "Paper Title: Sampling from Arbitrary Functions via PSD Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn many fields such as biochemistry, statistical mechanics and machine learning, effectively sampling arbitrary numbers of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples from probability distributions is a key task   . Basic sampling methods include rejection sampling and gridding, and rely on simple properties of the density. However, they are suitable only in small dimensions, except for very structured cases. Moreover, they are hard to adapt to probabilities which are known up to their renormalization constant, which is often the case when dealing with exponential models that are common in applications [ref]13. More involved methods have been developed to address these dimensionality and renormalization issues, in the class of so-called Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. However, they are complex to set up: in particular, independence between samples is not directly guaranteed, convergence can be slow and hard to measure non-asymptotically  [ref]13. In this work, we address the problem in a different way, by incorporating a modeling step. Instead of sampling directly from the target density, we first model this density using a positive semi-definite (PSD) model [ref]10 [ref]16, and then sample from this PSD model. PSD models have been introduced by Marteau-Ferey et al., [ref]10 and their relevance for modeling probability distributions has been further established by Rudi and Ciliberto, [ref]16, showing that i) they are stable under key operations for probabilistic inference, such as marginalization, integration (also called “sum-rule”), and product, which can be done efficiently in practice, and ii) they concisely approximate a large class of probability distributions. We present these models in Sec. 2. Building on this work, we show that these models are also relevant in the context of sampling, making the following main contributions. In Sec. 3, we derive an algorithm that is easy to implement and which can generate an arbitrary number of i.i.d. samples from a given PSD model, with any given precision. This answers one of the open questions outlined by Rudi and Ciliberto, [ref]16 and shows that one can indeed efficiently sample from a PSD model. In Sec. 4 we show that we can sample an arbitrary number of i.i.d. samples from a target probability distribution that is regular enough, with any given precision. The algorithm consists in (a) approximating the un-normalized density p𝑝p via a PSD model, using evaluations of p𝑝p, and (b) extracting i.i.d. samples from the PSD model. We show that for sufficiently regular densities the resulting PSD model is concise and avoids the curse of dimensionality: to achieve error ε𝜀\\varepsilon, the PSD model requires a number of parameters and a number of evaluations of p𝑝p that are in the order ε−2−d/βsuperscript𝜀2𝑑𝛽\\varepsilon^{-2-d/\\beta}, where d𝑑d is the dimension of the space and β𝛽\\beta is the order of differentiability of the density. For regular probabilities, i.e., when β⩾d𝛽𝑑\\beta\\geqslant d, the rate does not depend exponentially on d𝑑d and is bounded by O​(ε−3)𝑂superscript𝜀3O(\\varepsilon^{-3}) (the constant term instead may depend exponentially on d𝑑d). In Sec. 5, we also present numerical simulations which demonstrate the quality of both our sampling technique and approximation results.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: Moreover, they are hard to adapt to probabilities which are known up to their renormalization constant, which is often the case when dealing with exponential models that are common in applications [ref]13.
