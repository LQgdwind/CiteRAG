Fifteen papers have already been published in this direction. This system focuses on addressing the following problems in explainable AI: (1) explicitly defining, extracting, and counting concepts encoded by a DNN, (2) explaining the representation capacity (e.g., generalization ability and adversarial robustness) of DNNs at the concept level, and (3) summarizing/explaining the common mechanisms shared by different empirical deep learning methods. ∙∙\\bullet Explicitly defining and extracting concepts encoded by a DNN. A representative direction in the field of explainable AI is to explain the interactions between different input variables  [ref]29 1.\nBased on game theory,    5 defined the multi-variate interaction and multi-order interaction, from different aspects.\n found that a DNN usually just encoded very few salient interactions between input variables in experiments, i.e., discovering the sparsity of interactive concepts.\n further discovered that salient interactions were usually transferable across different input samples and DNNs, and exhibited certain discrimination power.\nThese studies indicated that salient interactions could be considered as concepts encoded by a DNN.\nFurthermore,  used the sparsity of interactions to define the optimal baseline value for the Shapley value.\n used interactive concepts of different complexities to explain the encoding of specific types of shapes and textures in DNNs for image classification.\nGiven a DNN for image classification,  discovered that salient interactions usually represented prototypical visual patterns in images. ∙∙\\bullet Explaining the representation capacity of DNNs using game-theoretic interactions.\nGame-theoretic interactions have been used to explain the representation capacity of a DNN, although the following studies used the multi-order interaction 5, rather than the Harsanyi interaction. Nevertheless, the Harsanyi interaction is proved to be compositional interaction elements in the multi-order interaction.\nThe multi-order interaction has been used to explain the adversarial robustness 9, adversarial transferability 2, and generalization ability 5 9 of a DNN.\nBesides,  proved the difficulty of a DNN in encoding middle-complexity interactions.\n proved that compared to a standard DNN, a Bayesian neural network (BNN) tends to avoid encoding complex Harsanyi interactions, which may explain the good adversarial robustness of BNNs. ∙∙\\bullet Summarizing common mechanisms for the success of various empirical deep learning methods.\n found that the computation of attribution values for fourteen attribution methods could all be explained as a re-allocation of interaction effects.\n7 proved that twelve methods to improve the adversarial transferability in previous studies essentially shared the common utility of reducing the interactions between adversarial perturbation units.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: ∙∙\\bullet Explicitly defining and extracting concepts encoded by a DNN. A representative direction in the field of explainable AI is to explain the interactions between different input variables  [ref]29 1.\nBased on game theory,    5 defined the multi-variate interaction and multi-order interaction, from different aspects.\n found that a DNN usually just encoded very few salient interactions\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
