      "content": "Paper Title: DeepSeq: Deep Sequential Circuit Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe now elaborate the GNN design of DeepSeq. Due to the presence of Flip-Flops (FFs), the behavior of sequential circuits depends upon the current input pattern and current state (previous output) of the circuit. In other words, it depends upon the sequence of input patterns applied at circuit inputs over a period of time under a specific workload. The directed logic propagation in netlists makes DAG-GNN models the suitable candidates for learning circuit representation. However,\nthe existence of FFs can cause cycles in the circuit as shown in Fig. 2. So, it is not straightforward to apply a DAG-GNN model to a directed cyclic graph. Besides, the existing DAG-GNN models such as DAG-ConvGNNs  [ref]15 and DAG-RecGNNs  are infeasible for learning periodic information updates in circuit graphs. Since, DeepGate  and FGNN [ref]9 are designed for representation learning of combinational circuits only, they also cannot deal with temporal correlation in sequential circuits. To address the above concerns, we propose a novel DAG-GNN architecture that can deal with directed cyclic graphs efficiently, for sequential circuit learning. Given an input circuit in AIG format, we first map it into a directed cyclic graph 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G}. We use the one-hot encoding of gate type as the node features xvsubscript𝑥𝑣{x_{v}} for each node v𝑣{v}. To be specific, the sequential AIG circuit contains only AND gate, NOT gate, Primary Inputs (PIs), and Flip-Flops (FFs). Hence, a 4-d vector is used as a node feature on each node according to its node type. We also assign an embedding vector hvsubscriptℎ𝑣{h_{v}} to every node v𝑣{v} that is updated during training to encode the representation of the sequential circuit. To generate the required supervision, we simulate every circuit with a random workload. The workload for a sequential netlist is defined in terms of PIs’ behavior of the circuit. Therefore, for every circuit, first we randomly generate logic-1 probabilities for all PIs. Then based on these probabilities, we generate a sequential pattern with 10,000 cycles. In this way, the generated sequential pattern represent random workloads for the corresponding circuit. We include the workload information in each circuit during the learning process by initializing the hvsubscriptℎ𝑣{h_{v}} of its PIs with the logic-1 probability of the sequential pattern applied on them. For example, if the logic-1 probability of a particular PI in a circuit is 0.10.10.1 according to the applied sequential pattern and hvsubscriptℎ𝑣{h_{v}} has 646464 dimension, then all dimensions of hvsubscriptℎ𝑣{h_{v}} contain the value 0.10.10.1. The hvsubscriptℎ𝑣{h_{v}} of the remaining nodes are initialized randomly. To be noted, we keep the hvsubscriptℎ𝑣{h_{v}} of primary inputs (PIs) fixed and update the hvsubscriptℎ𝑣{h_{v}} of remaining nodes during the GNN propagation. In this way, DeepSeq learns to infer both tasks, i.e., 𝒯T​Rsuperscript𝒯𝑇𝑅\\mathcal{T}^{TR} and 𝒯L​Gsuperscript𝒯𝐿𝐺\\mathcal{T}^{LG} based on the given workload information and embeds the true computational information of the circuit in hvsubscriptℎ𝑣{h_{v}} vector on each node v𝑣{v}.\nNext, considering the presence of cycles and the periodic information processing in sequential circuits, we design a customized sequential propagation scheme as shown in Fig. 2. It consists of the following steps: Move FFs to logic level 1 (LL-1) by removing their incoming edges. This removes the cycles and makes the FFs pseudo primary inputs (PPIs) (step 1 in Fig. 2). Propagate the information using the forward layer from PIs to POs in a levelized and sequential manner through the combinational part of the circuit only. Note that the current states of FFs are not updated but used as predecessors’ information for their corresponding successor nodes during this propagation. This aligns with the sequential circuit behaviour where the present states of FFs are used as pseudo inputs at each clock cycle (step 2 in Fig. 2). In this step, we propagate information using the reverse layer. The reverse layer is similar to the forward layer except that it processes the graph in reverse topological order. The reason for including the reverse layer is that the information from the successor nodes is useful to learn the implications implicitly in the circuit graphs  (step 3 in Fig. 2). Since, the circuits in our dataset contains D-FFs only, in which the output follows the state of the input, in the last step, we copy the updated representations of FFs’ predecessors to FFs. This step mimics the behavior that the FFs are only updated at each clock cycle (step 4 in Fig. 2). During foward and reverse propagation, similar to standard GNNs, we use A​g​g​r​e​g​a​t​e𝐴𝑔𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑒Aggregate and C​o​m​b​i​n​e𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑒Combine functions to compute the hidden states of each node except PIs. Hidden state hvsubscriptℎ𝑣h_{v} of a node v𝑣v is computed as: where P​(v)𝑃𝑣{P}(v) is the set of predecessors of node v𝑣v. The above four propagation steps are conducted iteratively for T𝑇T times to generate the final hidden state for each node. The reason for using the recurrent architecture is that it is impractical for GNNs to capture the circuit’s computational and structural information with a single propagation, as proved in . A​g​g​r​e​g​a​t​e−D​u​a​l​A​t​t​e​n​t​i​o​n::𝐴𝑔𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑒𝐷𝑢𝑎𝑙𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛absentAggregate-DualAttention:\nThe training objective defined in Section III-A requires the model to differentiate and learn logic and transition probabilities simultaneously. Both probabilities differ in their computational behavior, which makes the use of existing aggregation infeasible as they target to capture a single behavior at a time [ref]12 . To solve this problem, we define Dual Attention aggregation function in the additive form  to instantiate the A​g​g​r​e​g​a​t​e𝐴𝑔𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑒Aggregate function in Eq. (4). It mimics and learns the computational behavior of logic and transition probabilities at the same time. Specifically, for 𝒯L​Gsuperscript𝒯𝐿𝐺\\mathcal{T}^{LG} we calculate the aggregated message similar to , i.e., for a node v𝑣v at an iteration t𝑡t, we first compute the aggregated message 𝐦vL​Gtsuperscriptsubscript𝐦𝑣𝐿superscript𝐺𝑡\\mathbf{m}_{v}^{LG^{t}} from v𝑣v’s predecessors as follows: αu​vtsuperscriptsubscript𝛼𝑢𝑣𝑡\\alpha_{uv}^{t} is a weighting coefficient that learns the impact predecessors’ information on node v𝑣v, since the different inputs have different impact on determining the output of a logic gate. In this manner, Eq. 5 mimics the logic computation, and we learn the information required for 𝒯L​Gsuperscript𝒯𝐿𝐺\\mathcal{T}^{LG}. After that, we perform another attention between 𝐦vL​Gtsuperscriptsubscript𝐦𝑣𝐿superscript𝐺𝑡\\mathbf{m}_{v}^{LG^{t}} and 𝐡vt−1superscriptsubscript𝐡𝑣𝑡1\\mathbf{h}_{v}^{t-1} as shown in Eq. (6). 𝐦vL​Gtsuperscriptsubscript𝐦𝑣𝐿superscript𝐺𝑡\\mathbf{m}_{v}^{LG^{t}} represents the logic computation result of node v𝑣v at tt​hsuperscript𝑡𝑡ℎt^{th} iteration and 𝐡vt−1superscriptsubscript𝐡𝑣𝑡1\\mathbf{h}_{v}^{t-1} represents the computational state of node v𝑣v at tt​h−1superscript𝑡𝑡ℎ1t^{th}-1 iteration.\nThe intuition is that transition probabilities depend upon the current state and previous state of the node. Correspondingly, the Eq. (6) mimics the transition probability computation for 𝒯T​Rsuperscript𝒯𝑇𝑅\\mathcal{T}^{TR}. Finally, we concatenate the results from Eq. (5) and Eq. (6) as our final aggregated message as shown in Eq. (7). U​p​d​a​t​e−G​R​U::𝑈𝑝𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑒𝐺𝑅𝑈absentUpdate-GRU: We use gated recurrent unit (GRU) to instantiate the C​o​m​b​i​n​e𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑒Combine function in Eq. 4 as follows: where 𝐦vtsuperscriptsubscript𝐦𝑣𝑡\\mathbf{m}_{v}^{t}, 𝐱vsubscript𝐱𝑣\\mathbf{x}_{v} are concatenated together and treated as input, and 𝐡vt−1superscriptsubscript𝐡𝑣𝑡1\\mathbf{h}_{v}^{t-1} is considered as the past state of GRU. R​e​g​r​e​s​s​o​r::𝑅𝑒𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑜𝑟absentRegressor: After processing the input circuit graph through forward and reverse layers recursively for T𝑇T times, we pass the final hidden states of nodes 𝐡vTsuperscriptsubscript𝐡𝑣𝑇\\mathbf{h}_{v}^{T} into two independent set of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), for prediction of y^T​Rsuperscript^𝑦𝑇𝑅\\hat{{y}}^{TR} and y^L​Gsuperscript^𝑦𝐿𝐺\\hat{y}^{LG} as shown in Fig. 1. These MLPs do not share the weights and regress every node to predict their task-specific probabilities.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: FFs can cause cycles in the circuit as shown in Fig. 2.
