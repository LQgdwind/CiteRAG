      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring Uncertainty in Deep Learning for Construction of Prediction Intervals\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAlthough it is impossible to eliminate the uncertainty completely, it is worthwhile to reasonably estimate and deal with the uncertainty to avoid the cost caused by the error of high-risk prediction. In this section, current research in this field will be presented. Gaussian processes (GPs).\nGPs has a simple structure, and the algorithm model is determined by the mean function and the covariance function . And GPs is a good method of function approximation because of its flexibility, robustness to overfitting and provide well-calibrated aleatory uncertainty  . However, the gaussian process also has obvious disadvantages. It is not sparse, which makes it difficult to process high-dimensional data or massive data. And its prediction accuracy is not as good as that of deep neural networks. Recent research on GPs, such as sparse GPs  and deep GPs , is addressing these problems. Bayesian neural networks (BNN) .\nIn bayesian estimation, the prior distribution hypothesis of network parameters is introduced, and the posterior distribution is calculated by using bayesian formula, so as to introduce the uncertainty into the prediction of neural network. In practice, in order to introduce bayesian estimation into neural network, the method of variational inference  is often used to approximate the posterior distribution. The latest literature on BNN is available [ref]34    . BNN can be simply understood as introducing uncertainty into the weight of neural network, which is equivalent to integrating infinite neural networks on a certain weight distribution for prediction. However, this kind of method has obvious disadvantages, such as high computational complexity and the need for distribution hypothesis. Ensemble methods.\nEstimating epistemic uncertainty is learning which areas of the feature space are unexplored by the training samples. Most estimation of epistemic uncertainty are based on measuring variance between multiple models. The prediction results of multiple models trained on the training set are integrated into the final prediction value of the model and the estimate of epistemic uncertainty. Most recent approaches to estimating epistemic uncertainty follow this principle. Lakshminarayanan et al. [ref]12 proposed a simple and scalable non-bayesian solution that provides a very good baseline for evaluating the uncertainty. The authors train a probabilistic neural network to estimate the aleatory uncertainty using the appropriate loss function. In addition, the author also used the idea of ensemble learning  to boost predictive performance, which is an important work of non-bayesian method in predicting uncertainty. In recent years, a lot of work has been done on the development of approximate bayesian inference methods. Some works [ref]11  place an independent gaussian priori on each weight in the neural network, and then use back propagation to learn the mean and variance of these gaussian. After training, the weight distribution can be used to sample different networks to obtain different predictions. Gal et al.  proposed a new theoretical framework, which uses the dropout strategy  in deep neural networks as approximate bayesian inference. Bayesian probability theory provides us with a math-based method to infer the uncertainty of models, but it usually comes with a high computational cost. In this paper, the authors demonstrate that it is possible to convert recent deep learning tools to a bayesian model without changing the model. The trained neural network model is tested for many times, and Monte Carlo dropout is carried out every time. The model uncertainty can be quantified by calculating the entropy or variance of the predictions of the model. However, this approach has obvious limitation on the network model structure, which must include the dropout layer. Since dropout has been largely replaced by batch normalization  , Teye et al.  demonstrate how to use the Monte Carlo batch normalization (MCBN) to make meaningful estimation of model uncertainty. Further, this discovery enables us to make appropriate estimation of model uncertainty for traditional network architectures without modifying the network or training process. Although these methods avoid the disadvantages of bayesian methods, they can only measure one uncertainty, which is not complete. Prediction Intervals.\nPrediction intervals is a widely used tool to quantify the uncertainty of predictions. PIs directly conveys uncertainty. A representative work is proposed by Pearce et al. , which is based on the improvement of khosravi et al. . The author thinks that high quality PIs should be as narrow as possible and cover the data points of specified proportion. The author calls it the high quality criterion. According to this criterion, the author deduces a loss function, which is used to predict PIs without distribution assumption. In addition, a common method for prediction of interval range is quantile regression . It was first proposed by Koenker et al. . On the other hand, Rosenfeld et al. put forward the method of building PIs in the setting of batch learning, which is called I​n​t​P​r​e​d𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑑IntPred , that is, building PIs of a group of test points at the same time. An obvious disadvantage of these methods is that the PIs they constructed have nothing to do with uncertainty or have little relevance. Applications of uncertainty.\nFirstly, uncertainty plays an important role in deciding when to abandon the prediction of the model and let humans make decisions to avoid the loss caused by mistakes . Secondly, the study of uncertainty can promote the development of active learning , that is, deciding which data people should label to maximize the performance of the model . Thirdly, uncertainty estimation is very important when constructing the prediction intervals .\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: in order to introduce bayesian estimation into neural network, the method of variational inference  is often used to approximate the posterior distribution.
