      "content": "Paper Title: Combining Vision and Tactile Sensation for Video Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe objective of this work is to provide an improved video prediction by a model that simultaneously predicts tactile and video frames during physical robot interactions. This improved video prediction through integrated tactile sensation can be used for effective control of highly non-linear PRI tasks where the existing methods fail . We build our models based on our previous work of tactile prediction models [ref]20. Given (i) a set of context frames x0:c−1={x0,…,xc−1}subscriptx:0𝑐1subscript𝑥0…subscript𝑥𝑐1\\textbf{x}_{0:c-1}=\\{x_{0},\\dots,x_{c-1}\\}, which are the previously seen images during the trial, with a context sequence length of c𝑐c and (ii) a prediction horizon with a length of T−c𝑇𝑐T-c (which is how many frames into the future a model will predict for), a video prediction model can be defined as ℱ​(x0:c−1)=x^c:Tℱsubscriptx:0𝑐1subscript^x:𝑐𝑇\\mathcal{F}(\\textbf{x}_{0:c-1})=\\hat{\\textbf{x}}_{c:T}444We use x𝑥x, x and x^^x\\hat{\\textbf{x}} to denote variables either vector or matrix, a set of those variables and the corresponding predicted values., where x^c:T={xc,…,xT}subscript^x:𝑐𝑇subscript𝑥𝑐…subscript𝑥𝑇\\hat{\\textbf{x}}_{c:T}=\\{x_{c},\\dots,x_{T}\\} is the predicted video frames. The aim is to optimise the following objective function: for each prediction horizon T−c𝑇𝑐T-c, where 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} is the pixel space loss function, for example ℒ1subscriptℒ1\\mathcal{L}_{1} or ℒ2subscriptℒ2\\mathcal{L}_{2}, defining the difference between predicted and observed video frames. As we are predicting within the physical robot interaction space, we are focused on the model developing a cause-effect understanding of the robot. To do so, we action-condition the prediction model with past actions {a0,…,ac−1}subscript𝑎0…subscript𝑎𝑐1\\{a_{0},\\dots,a_{c-1}\\} and known future robot actions {ac,…,aT}subscript𝑎𝑐…subscript𝑎𝑇\\{a_{c},\\dots,a_{T}\\}. Within the context of visual model predictive control, the future robot actions will be a batch of candidate actions, allowing a discriminator to decide on the best action based on the most desirable predicted scene. The prediction model is therefore: We chose the stochastic video prediction model SVG (presented in [ref]7) as the baseline architecture to build our multi-modal system from. SVG does not make the assumptions about the input data that other video prediction models like SAVP and SV2P do, making the system more generalisable [ref]35 and hence more suitable to a multi-modal approach. It’s simple architecture also allows us to change the models structure more without a negative or destructive impact. SVG applies a stochastic assumption to the prediction model, where the objective is to sample from p​(x^c:T|x0:c−1,a0:T)𝑝conditionalsubscript^x:𝑐𝑇subscriptx:0𝑐1subscripta:0𝑇p(\\hat{\\textbf{x}}_{c:T}|\\textbf{x}_{0:c-1},\\textbf{a}_{0:T}). Within the base video prediction architecture, we build our models from, video prediction is split into sub-modules: (i) a frame prediction network, (ii) a prior network, and (iii) a posterior network, which is used to train the prior network only [ref]7. Within video prediction for PRI, latent variables are used to estimate unknown physical properties: ‘when a robot’s arm pushes a toy on a table, the unknown weight of that toy affects how it moves ’. Intuitively, we believe that tactile sensation should provide the model with more accurate representations of the object’s physical values. However, we still use the stochastic assumption and include the use of latent variable estimation as other features in the environment are still difficult to estimate even with tactile sensation. SVG conditions the frame prediction network on the estimated latent variables z, p​(x^c:T|x0:c−1,a0:T,z0:c−1)𝑝conditionalsubscript^x:𝑐𝑇subscriptx:0𝑐1subscripta:0𝑇subscriptz:0𝑐1p(\\hat{\\textbf{x}}_{c:T}|\\textbf{x}_{0:c-1},\\textbf{a}_{0:T},\\textbf{z}_{0:c-1}). The latent variables are distributed according to the prior network pψ​(zt|x0:t−1)subscript𝑝𝜓conditionalsubscriptz𝑡subscriptx:0𝑡1p_{\\psi}(\\textbf{z}_{t}|\\textbf{x}_{0:t-1}), where t𝑡t is the current time-step in the prediction sequence. Learning then involves training the parameters of factors θ𝜃\\theta of the factorised model: The learned prior network pψ​(zt|x0:t−1)subscript𝑝𝜓conditionalsubscriptz𝑡subscriptx:0𝑡1p_{\\psi}(\\textbf{z}_{t}|\\textbf{x}_{0:t-1}) is trained using Kullback-Leibler divergence 5 on the output of the posterior network qϕ​(zt|x0:t)subscript𝑞italic-ϕconditionalsubscriptz𝑡subscriptx:0𝑡q_{\\phi}(\\textbf{z}_{t}|\\textbf{x}_{0:t}). Both networks output the parameters of a conditional Gaussian distribution 𝒩​(μψ​(x0:t−1),σψ​(x0:t−1))𝒩subscript𝜇𝜓subscriptx:0𝑡1subscript𝜎𝜓subscriptx:0𝑡1\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{\\psi}(\\textbf{x}_{0:t-1}),\\>\\sigma_{\\psi}(\\textbf{x}_{0:t-1})) The prior network can then be trained jointly with the frame prediction model by maximising Eq. 4. For further information on stochastic video prediction look to  and [ref]7. To integrate tactile sensation, d0:c−1={d0,…,dc−1}subscriptd:0𝑐1subscript𝑑0…subscript𝑑𝑐1\\textbf{d}_{0:c-1}=\\{{d}_{0},\\dots,{d}_{c-1}\\}, into video prediction models there are a variety of potential methods. In the following sections, we discuss the different methods we used to apply tactile integration into the above video prediction architecture (Fig. 3).\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: tactile sensation can be used for effective control of highly non-linear PRI tasks where the existing methods fail .
