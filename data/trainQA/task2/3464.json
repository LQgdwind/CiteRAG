      "content": "Paper Title: View Composition Algebra for Ad Hoc Comparison\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nComparison is ubiquitous in visual data analysis, as a low-level perceptual task    as well as a high-level analysis task  . When the comparsion targets and tasks are known apriori, there are numerous design guidelines   to help designers choose effective visual encodings and visualization designs. But what if a visualization end-user wants to perform ad hoc comparisons during visual analysis? Figure 1 is Tableau’s example ServiceNow executive dashboard and shows the number of incidents, problems, and requests per year (top) and their breakdowns (bottom). But the user may be interested in comparisons the dashboard was not design for—what if the user wants to know the difference between the 2017 and 2016 incident trends, or compare them with the year-to-date hardware incidents, or compare any other combination of values, marks, trends, or charts? Although the user can see and point to the comparison targets, existing visualizations do not perform and visualize the comparison. In practice, users visually estimate comparisons (across encodings or even charts), and risk making biased or inaccurate estimates   [ref]65. It would be useful to develop a set of comparison-specific interaction techniques that visualization developers and visual analysis systems can readily incorporate. When designing a new class of interactions, it is helpful to build the interaction techniques on top of a formal language. This decouples the interaction design from the formal semantics, so that a single language implementation can support a multitude of interaction designs. Examples of such languages include table algebras   for facetted layouts, graphical grammars   for statistical charts; and interaction grammars  for manipulation and coordination interactions. Although no formalism has been developed for comparison, it is sensible that any formalism should let users interactively compare any visual representation of data (e.g., charts, marks) as targets, as long as they are comparable. This naturally leads to five desirable criteria regarding the nature of the input targets (C1,2), the output comparison results (C3), and what comparable means (C4,5). (C1) Flexible Targets: comparison targets should be any visualization component derived from data, such as constant values, marks, legend elements, and charts. (C2) Design Independence: whether targets are comparable should be independent of their visual encoding, design, and spatial placement. For instance, the per-category incidents in the bar chart should be comparable with the monthly incidents line chart despite their visual differences. (C3) Design Diversity the comparison result should support common visual design strategies for comparison , namely superposition, juxtaposition, and explicit encoding of the differences. (C4) Safety: of the possible combinations of targets, only a subset are unambiguous and semantically meaningful to compose. For instance, profits and height are quantitative attributes but should not be composed. The formalism should identify comparisons between targets that are potentially unsafe, and either prevent it or warn the user. (C5) Expressiveness: targets that are semantically compatible should be allowed. C4 and C5 they pose an interesting question: When are visualization data comparable? Traditionally, the visualization designer manually determines that data is safe to compare, and then chooses the appropriate data transformation and design strategies. However, ad hoc comparisons require that we formalize safety to check it automatically. The challenge is that safety is trivial to satisfy by rejecting all comparisons. However, widening expressiveness is nontrivial because safety depends on the view definition, dataset’s semantics, and user’s domain knowledge. Thus, a comparison language must strive to maximize expressiveness while ensuring safety. Contributions:  This paper makes three core contributions: a conceptual model for comparison operations, a concrete algebra called View Composition Algebra (VCA 111VCA is also short for Visual Comparison Algebra.) that satisfies C1-5 and is designed for multi-dimensional cube-based analytics , and an interaction design based on the algebra. The conceptual model shows that comparison differs from typical interaction techniques in that it must understand the semantics of the view’s entire data processing pipeline. The model also introduces the notions of safety and expressiveness for comparison interactions. VCA introduces a closed set of composition operators over any visual representation of data, which we call Views222View in data management refers to a query result; here it refers to the visual representation of a query result., including labels, marks, and charts. The algebra defines three types of view composition operators that computes statistics, merges marks, or fits statistical models to the data from the input views. We describe how to compile statements into SQL, and show that VCA is compatible with visualization formalisms such as VizQL . We further highlight subtle challenges that arise when comparing views that are compatible but “mis-aligned” (e.g., comparing prices on even vs odd days) and introduce a novel lift operator to facilitate such comparisons. The interaction design lets users select values, marks, legend elements, or charts as comparison targets, and choose composition operators to apply to the targets. We illustrate how comparison interactions can express computations otherwise not possible in existing visualization systems, enable comparisons across visual encodings, can be composed to perform multi-step comparisons, and are compatible with existing visualization interactions such as dynamic filtering. The next section characterizes comparison interactions within the context of existing interaction taxonomies, and provides background on comparison and language designs. The subsequent sections introduce the conceptual model, algebra, interaction design, and case study. We end by discussing the limitations and potential research directions to expand on the ideas in this paper. If there is one takeaway message, it is that ad hoc visual comparison depends on analyzing data-level transformations and analyses as well as visual design principles. VCA is a starting point in the interaction design space for view composition and comparison. The text uses screenshots when possible to describe the interaction design, and simplified diagrams when they are more legible.
