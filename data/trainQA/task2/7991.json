      "content": "Paper Title: Structure and Independence in Hyperbolic Uniform Disk Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGiven a set of disks in the plane, one can assign to them a geometric intersection graph whose vertices are the disks, and edges are added between pairs of intersecting disks. The study of intersection graphs is usually motivated by physically realized networks: such networks require spatial proximity between nodes for successful connections, and the simplest model allows for connections within a distance 222, which is equivalent to the intersection graph induced by disks of radius 111 centered at the nodes. Such graphs are usually called unit disk graphs. Unit disk graphs have received a lot of attention in the theoretical computer science literature. Their intriguing structural properties yield profound mathematical insights and facilitate the development of efficient algorithms. Historically, unit disk graphs have been studied in the Euclidean plane, where they are well motivated due to their relevance for, e.g., sensor networks. The relevance of unit disk graphs in the hyperbolic plane is less obvious. However, originating in the network science community, it has been observed  that the intersection graph of randomly sampled disks of equal radius r𝑟r yields graphs that resemble complex real-world networks in regards to important properties111For this to work, the choice of the radius r𝑟r is crucial. It is chosen as r=log⁡n+c𝑟𝑛𝑐r=\\log n+c for a constant c𝑐c that controls the average degree, and the disk centers are all sampled within a disk of radius 2​r2𝑟2r.. They are, e.g., heterogeneous with a degree distribution following a power law 1, have high clustering coefficient 1, and exhibit the small-world property  . Besides numerous structural results, these hyperbolic random graphs also allow for the design of more efficient algorithms    . However, all these results rely on the\nfact that the disks are chosen randomly. So far, there is only little\nresearch on hyperbolic uniform disk graphs from a deterministic, more\ngraph-theoretic perspective. It is important to note that for the intersection graphs of radius-r𝑟r disks the resulting graph classes are different for different values of r𝑟r. Moreover, it is natural to allow for the radius r𝑟r to be a (monotone) function of the number of vertices. Unlike the Euclidean setting where a simple scaling shows that the choice of “unit” does not matter, it is a very important parameter in the hyperbolic setting. For those unfamiliar with hyperbolic geometry there is a way to conceptually understand these graphs in a Euclidean setting as follows. One can think of a hyperbolic disk graph of radius r𝑟r disks as a Euclidean disk graph where the radius of a disk of center p𝑝p is set to fr​(dist⁡(o,p))subscript𝑓𝑟dist𝑜𝑝f_{r}(\\operatorname{\\mathrm{dist}}(o,p)), where frsubscript𝑓𝑟f_{r} is decreasing very quickly at a rate set by r𝑟r, and dist⁡(o,p)dist𝑜𝑝\\operatorname{\\mathrm{dist}}(o,p) is the distance of the origin and the disk center p𝑝p. In particular, as r𝑟r goes to 00, the rate of decrease is negligible, and we get almost Euclidean unit disk graphs, while large r𝑟r corresponds to a very different graph class. See Figure 1 for an illustration. Now hyperbolic disk graphs of uniform (that is, equal) radius 1/n31superscript𝑛31/n^{3} and uniform radius 100​log⁡n100𝑛100\\log n are incomparable: the former class contains all k×k𝑘𝑘k\\times k grid graphs, but does not contain stars of size s≥8𝑠8s\\geq 8, while the latter contains all star graphs but does not contain any k×k𝑘𝑘k\\times k grid of size k≥3𝑘3k\\geq 3, see Figure 1. We call the regime r≤1/n𝑟1𝑛r\\leq 1/\\sqrt{n} almost Euclidean, while r∈Ω​(log⁡n)𝑟Ω𝑛r\\in\\Omega(\\log n) is called firmly hyperbolic. The primary goal of our paper is to explore the following: The case of constant radius has been studied by Kisfaludi-Bak 8, and a case of radius roughly log⁡n𝑛\\log n (with some other constraints) has been studied by Bläsius et al.  in the context of strongly hyperbolic uniform disk graphs. The above mentioned hyperbolic random graphs are randomly sampled strongly hyperbolic uniform disk graphs. Apart from these particular choices of the radius we have very limited understanding about the structure of hyperbolic uniform disk graphs of other radii. The radius’ impact on problem complexity was studied in the context of the traveling salesman problem in the hyperbolic plane , where the problem’s complexity decreases as one increases the minimum pairwise distance r𝑟r among input points. In this paper, we show that the structure of hyperbolic uniform disk graphs behaves similarly: their structure becomes easier for larger values of r𝑟r, and Independent Set can be solved faster for larger r𝑟r. Let HUDG​(r​(n))HUDG𝑟𝑛\\mathrm{HUDG}(r(n)) denote the set of intersection graphs where each n𝑛n-vertex graph can be realized as the intersection graph of disks of uniform (equal) radius r​(n)𝑟𝑛r(n) in the hyperbolic plane of Gaussian curvature −11-1222Equivalently, one can fix the radius to be 111 and set the Gaussian curvature to be −r2superscript𝑟2-r^{2}.. We denote by HUDGHUDG\\mathrm{HUDG} the union of these classes for all r𝑟r, that is, HUDG=⋃r>0HUDG​(r)HUDGsubscript𝑟0HUDG𝑟\\mathrm{HUDG}=\\bigcup_{r>0}\\mathrm{HUDG}(r). Let UDGUDG\\mathrm{UDG} denote the class of unit disk graphs in the Euclidean plane. Bläsius et al. have shown that UDG⊂HUDGUDGHUDG\\mathrm{UDG}\\subset\\mathrm{HUDG} . When a graph is given without the geometric realization, it is NP-hard (even ∃ℝℝ\\exists\\mathbb{R}-complete) to decide if the graph is a UDGUDG\\mathrm{UDG}  or HUDGHUDG\\mathrm{HUDG} ; for this reason, we will assume throughout this article that the input intersection graphs of our algorithms are given by specifying their geometric realization. In the hyperbolic setting, one can specify the disk centers using a so-called model of the hyperbolic plane, which is simply an embedding of the hyperbolic plane into some specific part of the Euclidean plane, e.g., inside the Euclidean unit disk. See our preliminaries for brief introduction to Euclidean models of the hyperbolic plane. From the perspective of graph algorithms, unit disk graphs in the Euclidean plane have been serving an important role as a graph class that is not comparable but similar to planar graphs. The circle packing theorem  states that every planar graph can be realized as an intersection graph of disks (of arbitrary radii), thus disk graphs serve as a common generalization of planar and unit disk graphs. Using conformal hyperbolic models, one can observe that hyperbolic disks appear as Euclidean disks333In the Poincaré disk and half-plane models, all hyperbolic disks are Euclidean disks, but the Euclidean and hyperbolic radii of these disks are different. in the model, which means that all HUDGHUDG\\mathrm{HUDG}s are realized as Euclidean disk graphs. Denoting Euclidean disk graphs with DGDG\\mathrm{DG}, we thus have UDG⊆HUDG⊆DGUDGHUDGDG\\mathrm{UDG}\\subseteq\\mathrm{HUDG}\\subseteq\\mathrm{DG}444With a little effort, one can show that both containments are strict: UDG⊊HUDG⊊DGUDGHUDGDG\\mathrm{UDG}\\subsetneq\\mathrm{HUDG}\\subsetneq\\mathrm{DG}.. A key structural tool in the study of both planar and (unit) disk graphs has been separator theorems. By a result of Lipton and Tarjan, any n𝑛n-vertex planar graph can be partitioned into three vertex sets, A,B𝐴𝐵A,B and the separator S𝑆S, such that no edges go between A𝐴A and B𝐵B, the separator set S𝑆S has size 𝒪​(n)𝒪𝑛\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n}), and max⁡{|A|,|B|}≤23​n𝐴𝐵23𝑛\\max\\{|A|,|B|\\}\\leq\\frac{2}{3}n.\nSeparator theorems are closely related to the treewidth555See our preliminaries for the definitions of treewidth and 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P}-flattened treewidth. of graphs , for example, the above separator implies a treewidth bound of O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(\\sqrt{n}) on planar graphs. For (unit) disk graphs, similar separators and treewidth bounds are not possible because one can represent cliques of arbitrary size.\nThere have been at least three different approaches to deal with large cliques.\nThe first option is to bound the cliques in some way. One can for example obtain separators for a set of disks of bounded ply, i.e., assuming that each point of the ambient space is included in at most ℓℓ\\ell disks. There are several separators for disks (and even balls in higher dimensions) that involve ply. The strongest and most general among these is by Miller et al. . The second way to deal with large cliques is to use so-called clique-based separators [ref]3 , where the separator is decomposed into cliques, and the cliques are sometimes assigned some small weight depending on their size. In the hyperbolic setting, Kisfaludi-Bak 8 showed that for any constant c𝑐c, the graph class HUDG​(c)HUDG𝑐\\mathrm{HUDG}(c) admits a balanced separator consisting of 𝒪​(log⁡n)𝒪𝑛\\mathcal{O}(\\log n) cliques. The same paper shows that HUDG​(c)HUDG𝑐\\mathrm{HUDG}(c) also has clique-based separators of weight 𝒪​(log2⁡n)𝒪superscript2𝑛\\mathcal{O}(\\log^{2}n), and extends these techniques to balls of constant radius in higher-dimensional hyperbolic spaces, along with much of the machinery of [ref]3. The third option is to use random disk positions to disperse large cliques with high probability. Bläsius, Friedrich and Krohmer  gave high-probability bounds on separators and treewidth for certain radius regimes in hyperbolic random graphs. The above separators and treewidth can be used to obtain fast divide-and-conquer or dynamic programming algorithms  [ref]3. In the Independent Set problem, the goal is to decide if there are k𝑘k pairwise non-adjacent vertices in the graph. In general graphs the best known algorithms run in 2𝒪​(n)superscript2𝒪𝑛2^{\\mathcal{O}(n)} or n𝒪​(k)superscript𝑛𝒪𝑘n^{\\mathcal{O}(k)} time, and these running times are optimal under the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH)  (see  for the definition of ETH). In planar and disk graphs however the separators allow algorithms with running time 2𝒪​(n)superscript2𝒪𝑛2^{\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n})} or n𝒪​(k)superscript𝑛𝒪𝑘n^{\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{k})}  .\nMoreover, the separator implies that planar graphs have treewidth5 𝒪​(n)𝒪𝑛\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n}) and unit disk graphs have so-called 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P}-flattened treewidth 𝒪​(n)𝒪𝑛\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n}) for some clique-partition 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P}. As a consequence, one can adapt treewidth-based algorithms  to these graph classes. In the hyperbolic setting, the (𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P}-flattened) treewidth bounds yield an n𝒪​(log⁡n)superscript𝑛𝒪𝑛n^{\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)} quasi-polynomial algorithm for Independent Set and many other problems on graphs in HUDG​(c)HUDG𝑐\\mathrm{HUDG}(c) for any constant c𝑐c which is matched by a lower bound under ETH 8 in case of Independent Set. When approximating Independent Set, the main algorithmic tool in planar graphs is Baker’s shifting technique  which gives a (1−ε)1𝜀(1-\\varepsilon)-approximate independent set in 2𝒪​(1/ε)​nsuperscript2𝒪1𝜀𝑛2^{\\mathcal{O}(1/\\varepsilon)}n time. A conceptually easier grid shifting was discovered for unit disks by Hochbaum and Maas 4, which was later (implicitly) improved by Agarwal, van Kreveld, and Suri . This line of research culminated in the algorithm of Chan 4 with a running time of n𝒪​(1/ε)superscript𝑛𝒪1𝜀n^{\\mathcal{O}(1/\\varepsilon)} for disks, which also can be generalized for balls in higher dimensions. Baker’s algorithm and Chan’s algorithm (even for unit disks) are optimal under standard complexity assumptions . To the best of our knowledge, there are no published approximation algorithms for HUDG​(r​(n))HUDG𝑟𝑛\\mathrm{HUDG}(r(n)) or HUDGHUDG\\mathrm{HUDG} other than what is already implied from the algorithms on disk graphs. However, for hyperbolic random graphs,\nthere is an 𝒪​(m​log⁡n)𝒪𝑚𝑛\\mathcal{O}(m\\log n) algorithm that yields a 1−o​(1)1𝑜11-o(1)-approximation for Independent Set asymptotically almost surely . An interesting setting where the treewidth of planar graphs has been used for intersection graphs is that of covering and packing problems in the work of Har-Peled and later Marx and Pilipczuk 3 . For the Independent Set problem on unit disk graphs, they consider the Voronoi diagram of the disk centers of a maximum independent set of size k𝑘k. For a set of points (often called sites) S𝑆S the Voronoi diagram is a planar subdivision (a planar graph) that partitions the plane according to the closest site of S𝑆S, that is, the cell of a site s∈S𝑠𝑆s\\in S consists of those points whose nearest neighbor from S𝑆S is s𝑠s. As the Voronoi diagram is a planar graph on 𝒪​(k)𝒪𝑘\\mathcal{O}(k) vertices, it has a balanced separator of size 𝒪​(k)𝒪𝑘\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{k}). Although this Voronoi diagram is based on the solution, and thus unknown from the algorithmic perspective, the idea of Marx and Pilipczuk is that one can enumerate all possible separators of the Voronoi diagram in n𝒪​(k)superscript𝑛𝒪𝑘n^{\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{k})} time, and one of these separators can then be used to separate the (still unknown) solution in a balanced manner. A similar “separator guessing” technique has been used elsewhere in approximation and parameterized algorithms  3.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: balls in higher dimensions) that involve ply.
