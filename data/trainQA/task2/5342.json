Eickhoff, D. Duncan, “Unsupervised Multivariate Time-Series Transformers for Seizure Identification on EEG”, IEEE Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA) 2022, DOI 10.1109/ICMLA55696.2022.00208. Work was performed at University of Southern California and supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) grant R01NS111744. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/ilkyyldz95/EEG_MVTS.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEpilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, affecting over 70 million people worldwide . Epilepsy patients typically suffer from seizures, involving uncontrolled jerking movements or momentary losses of awareness due to abnormal excessive or synchronous activities in the brain . The degraded quality of life for patients strongly motivates early seizure identification, as early seizures have been shown to be prognostic markers for later epileptogenic development. Successful identification of early seizures can initiate antiepileptogenic intervention and therapies that can remarkably improve the quality of life for patients and their caregivers. To this end, electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings received particular attention for seizure identification , due to their routine and low expense collection compared to, e.g., neuroimaging. Seizures on EEG are defined as generalized spike-wave discharges at three per second or faster, and clearly evolving discharges of any type that reach a frequency of four per second or faster. Despite their volume and rich information content, EEG recordings are known to contain many artifacts due to movement, physiological activity such as perspiration, and measurement hardware 3 . The stochastic nature of clinically-acquired EEG makes seizure identification via manual inspection laborious and difficult, leading to significant variability across clinical labels of different experts [ref]43.\nThis challenge motivated the recent literature to focus on automated identification of epileptic seizures on EEG as a promising complement to manual inspection.\nThe literature on automated EEG seizure identification is extensive (c.f. Section II), focusing mostly on supervised machine learning methods using both manual feature extraction    , as well as deep neural networks (DNNs) without manual feature extraction   6. Despite their success, supervised methods require expert labels indicating EEG segments that contain seizures, while obtaining large and consistently-labeled EEG datasets is unfavourable due to the stochastic nature of EEG [ref]43. Difficulty of label collection also leads to severely imbalanced EEG datasets, in which the number of non-seizure recordings significantly exceeds the number of seizure recordings; this poses a further challenge for supervised learning that is prone to overfitting towards dominant class predictions . Unsupervised machine learning methods, which do not rely on labeled data have not yet been widely explored. A few methods employed traditional shallow models for unsupervised seizure identification on both raw EEG , as well as spatio-temporal features extracted from EEG   0.\nTo the best of our knowledge, unsupervised DNN methods for EEG seizure identification have been limited to a couple of recent works, requiring feature extraction prior to training  or employing convolutional DNN architectures that are not tailored for multivariate time-series data such as EEG . We propose a fully-unsupervised deep learning approach that can identify seizures on raw EEG recordings. To this end, we make the following contributions: We employ the first unsupervised transformer-based model for seizure identification on raw EEG, inspired by recent advances in multivariate time-series analysis . We pose seizure identification as an anomaly detection problem. To this end, we train an autoencoder involving a transformer encoder via an unsupervised loss function, incorporating a novel masking strategy uniquely designed for modeling multivariate time-series data such as EEG. As training employs EEG recordings that do not contain seizures, seizures are identified via mean reconstruction errors at inference time. We extensively validate the seizure identification performance of our method on three publicly available benchmark EEG datasets. Our method can successfully distinguish between non-seizure vs. seizure windows, with up to 0.94 Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC). Moreover, our unsupervised anomaly detection approach leads to significantly better seizure identification performance than the supervised learning counterparts, by up to 16%percent1616\\% recall, 9%percent99\\% accuracy, and 9%percent99\\% AUC, establishing a particular benefit for learning from highly imbalanced data.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: nature of clinically-acquired EEG makes seizure identification via manual inspection laborious and difficult, leading to significant variability across clinical labels of different experts [ref]43.\nThis challenge motivated the recent literature to focus on automated identification of epileptic seizures on EEG as a promising complement to manual inspection.\nThe literature on automated\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
