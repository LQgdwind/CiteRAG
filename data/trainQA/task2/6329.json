      "content": "Paper Title: Fast Diffusion Model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDiffusion-based generative models (DMs)      are powerful tools for complex data modeling and generation.\nTheir robust and stable capabilities for complex data modeling have also led to their successful application in various domains, such as text-to-video generation 0 1 2, image synthesis   [ref]27, manipulation   7, and audio generation   , etc.\nHowever, their slow and costly training and sampling limit broader applications. To address these efficiency issues, two family of methods have been proposed. One is known as sampling-efficient DMs, including learning-free sampling and learning-based sampling. Learning-free sampling relies on discretizing the reverse-time SDE  0 or ODE 9 1 8 [ref]2, while learning-based sampling mainly depends on knowledge distillation 2 6 7. The other family comprises training-efficient DMs. These methods involve optimization to the loss function [ref]27 [ref]2 3 4 3, latent space training 4 5, neural network refinement  5, and diffusion process improvement 0 6 7. Contrasted with our FDM, other momentum-based approaches in diffusion process improvement necessitate an augmented momentum space 0 8, and thus double the memory consumption compared to conventional DMs (Section 5.3). Moreover, these prior works are known to suffer from numerical instability due to the complex formulation of the perturbation kernel. In contrast, like most DMs, our FDM solely possesses the sample space and has a streamlined perturbation kernel, and our FDM enjoys better performance as shown in Section 5.3.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: generation.\nTheir robust and stable capabilities for complex data modeling have also led to their successful application in various domains, such as text-to-video generation 0 1 2, image synthesis   [ref]27, manipulation   7, and audio generation   , etc.\nHowever, their slow and costly training and sampling limit broader applications.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
