      "content": "Paper Title: Many-to-One Knowledge Distillation of Real-Time Epileptic Seizure Detection for Low-Power Wearable Internet of Things Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe gold standard for non-invasive seizure detection is EEG monitoring , which has been used for decades in highly specialized and costly hospital environments. EEG-based seizure detection has received noticeable attention in the literature as brain activity is significantly affected during seizure attacks. In , the authors proposed the use of spectral graphs to extract spatial-temporal patterns for seizure detection. In , they used the wavelet transform, which has been applied to the time-frequency domain for the detection of epileptic activity. In , the authors proposed an effective feature extraction algorithm named discrete short-time Fourier transform (DSTFT), which is an adaptive generalization of the classical short-time Fourier transform (STFT). In , the authors apply the Kriging methods on EEG signals in a wearable system configuration to reduce the latency in real-time epileptic seizure detection. In , the same Kriging methods have been used for the application of early seizure detection. The authors in  use discrete wavelet transform and statistical features to apply preprocessed EEG signals to a neural network classifier to detect epileptic seizures.\nAll the works mentioned above propose power-hungry algorithms that use a complete set of EEG channels. Therefore, if these methods are applied to real-life IoT wearable systems, patients would suffer from the social stigma of wearing a cap with electrodes on the head. Yet, our work presents a knowledge distillation to remove the most invasive signals used in continuous monitoring, leading to a more straightforward, more energy-efficient, and less stigmatizing setup applicable to IoT wearable systems. To optimize energy consumption, in  a hierarchical architecture with a wide set of near-sensor processing kernels is presented. They have shown that, due to their power management techniques, their architecture is suitable for IoT wearable systems.\nIn , the authors have used optimization and parallelization techniques besides integration of domain-specific accelerators with the goal of improving the mapping and reducing the energy consumption of biomedical applications. The technique that we are targeting here is knowledge distillation, which is originally a model compression technique. This enables us to train smaller and less complex DNNs with comparable performance. To interpret DNNs for epileptic seizure detection on EEG signals, in , they associate certain properties of the model behavior with the expert medical knowledge. They have come up with online seizure event characterization able to handle inter-patient variability. To overcome the social stigma problem in IoT wearable systems using EEG caps, in , a wearable system based on the temporal EEG electrodes for the detection of epileptic seizures is presented. By reducing the acquired signals to four, the system could be implemented on glasses, which can be easily worn by patients.\nAlthough these glasses solve the social stigma issue, they use only EEG signals for the seizure detection task, which are hard to obtain compared to other biomedical signals. In contrast, our work uses the knowledge of EEG and ECG signals, while the final model uses only the ECG signal to detect seizures more effortlessly than with EEG signals. Besides EEG, other biosignals can also get affected by epileptic seizures and provide additional information about the occurrence of such attacks. For example, seizures are often associated with cardiovascular alterations, and measures related to the heart rate are known to be useful clinical signs of an epileptic discharge     . Thus, combining other biosignals with EEG can result in better detection of different types of seizures, especially those that are not easily detected with just the EEG. Multi-modal seizure detection has been done previously in several works.\nIn , a combination of electrodermal activity and accelerometer signals is used.\nIn , the authors have used EEG, Electromyography (EMG) and ECG signals and have shown that the average sensitivity is improved in comparison with using each individual sensor separately.\nIn , a combination of linear discriminant models extracted from EEG and ECG features is used to detect seizures in newborn infants.\nIn , an SVM model is used with both EEG and ECG signals and could achieve high accuracy being tested on three patients.\nIn , seizure detection is done using an SVM model on multi-channel EEG and single-channel ECG separately and then fusing them into one final decision. The effect of using this multi-modal method is then shown on the number of false alarms and detection delay.\nRecently, in , convolutional neural networks (CNN) are used in combination of EEG, ECG and respiration. They have observed that\nthe multi-modal system outperforms systems with individual signals. The reduced deep convolutional stack autoencoder is used in another work using 18 channels of EEG signal, which has resulted in very high performance; but yet, the system cannot be implemented on IoT wearable devices and is intrusive . Knowledge distillation in neural networks was first introduced in 2015 , where a single model is trained from an ensemble of models (known as specialists or experts). The key aspect of knowledge distillation is learning not from the discrete labels of the dataset, but from the continuous output of the \"expert\" models. This concept has been tested on speech and images primarily but then also showed satisfying results in certain healthcare applications. In that work, it is demonstrated that we can benefit from the knowledge distillation method to efficiently regularize the smaller network and achieve better generalization than directly training the network using the labels of the training set  [ref]39. In [ref]40, authors have used gradient boosting trees as the experts to train their deep learning model on a real-world clinical time-series dataset, showing an improvement in the performance with respect to their initial deep learning model. In [ref]41, multi-modal segmentation of computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is compacted by distilling knowledge from cross-modal information of these images. Similarly, in , the student model learns from both labeled target data (e.g., CT), and unlabeled target data and labeled source data (e.g., MR) by two teacher models. They have shown that their approach can utilize unlabeled data and cross-modality data with superior performance, outperforming semi-supervised learning and domain adaptation methods with a large margin.\nBased on the reviewed state-of-the-art works, we hypothesise that distilling the knowledge from a multi-modal epileptic seizure detection system to a single-input system, can improve the performance of the single-input network. Thus, in the following section, we will leverage this concept and introduce first our multi-modal system and, after that, our distilled single-input system.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: from the knowledge distillation method to efficiently regularize the smaller network and achieve better generalization than directly training the network using the labels of the training set  [ref]39.
