      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Deep Multi-Shape Matching\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe functional map framework  enables to formulate the correspondence problem in the functional domain by computing functional maps instead of point-wise maps. The key advantage of functional maps is that they allow for a low-dimensional representation of shape correspondences, i.e. small matrices that encode how functions can be transferred between two domains (3D shapes).\nUnlike finding point-to-point correspondences, which can for example be phrased as the NP-hard quadratic assignment problem , functional maps can efficiently be obtained by solving a linear least-squares problem. The functional map framework has been extensively studied and was extended in numerous works, e.g. in terms of improving the accuracy or robustness , as well as extending its application to partial shape matching 8, non-isometric shape matching   and multi-shape matching  . Nevertheless, in these approaches functional maps are typically utilised in an axiomatic manner, meaning that they heavily rely on handcrafted feature descriptors, such as HKS , WKS  or SHOT [ref]40, which potentially limits their performance.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: . Nevertheless, in these approaches functional maps are typically utilised in an axiomatic manner, meaning that they heavily rely on handcrafted feature descriptors, such as HKS , WKS  or SHOT [ref]40, which potentially limits their performance.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
