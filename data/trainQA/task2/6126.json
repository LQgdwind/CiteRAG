      "content": "Paper Title: Visual Tuning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPre-trained foundation models for vision have been surveyed in , which develops from CNN- and GAN-based models to recent Transformer-based models. We recommend readers refer to  for the detailed pre-training strategies. This section briefly introduces these representative models‚Äô basic structures: CNN-based, Transformer-based, and CNN+Transformer. CNN is one of the most popular deep learning models such as AlexNet , VGGNet 8, Inception 9, ResNet 4, EfficientNet [ref]50, etc., which has been surveyed time to time  . EfficientNet is lightweight yet can achieve comparable performance to Transformer-based models via pre-trained initialization on various visual tasks such as image classification  and video understanding . Except for 2D CNN, a couple of 3D CNN models such as C3D , I3D , S3D , and X3D  have been introduced for video understanding tasks. In addition, temporal convolutional network  has also been proposed for tasks such as segmentation  and pose estimation  . Notably, the basic layer of the temporal convolutional network is implemented with 2D convolution while Transformer is implemented via 1D convolution in addition to the attention mechanism. The typical architecture of a Transformer model is structured with several basic Transformer layers. Each layer can be made of a varied number of Transformer blocks composed of a multi-head self-attention (Attention) module and a fully connected feed-forward network (FFN) implemented with a 2-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP). Layer normalization (LN) and residual connection are respectively performed before and after both FFN and Attention modules. One such Transformer block can be represented as: where Z^lsuperscript^ùëçùëô\\hat{Z}^{l} and ZlsuperscriptùëçùëôZ^{l} respectively indicate the output of Attention and FNN modules, and Zl‚àí1superscriptùëçùëô1Z^{l-1} denotes the output of a previous FNN module.\nBuilding upon the basic Transformer model, Transformer has been dominating increasing tasks  . Early Transformer models for vision are Vision Transformer (ViT) , Data-efficient image transformer\n(DeiT) , while their representative variations are TNT , T2T , PVT , Swin-Vit , Video Swin Transformer , CPVT . Transformer models are well known for their ability to capture long-range dependencies of input data. Whereas CNNs might be better at representing local features. Models combining Transformer and CNN can achieve better performance.\nTwins-SVT  used 2D convolutional to calculate the attention module, leading to improved performance on image-based tasks with considerably more model parameters. Representative methods combining CNN and Transformer are Shuffle ,\nCMT ,\nVOLO , etc. Although they can achieve superior performance, how they can be used for visual tuning seems under-explored.\n\nReference markers found: [50]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]50: models‚Äô basic structures: CNN-based, Transformer-based, and CNN+Transformer.
