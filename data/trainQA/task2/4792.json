      "content": "Paper Title: Safety Verification for Neural Networks Based on Set-boundary Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere has been a dozen of works on safety verification of NNs. The first work on DNN verification was published in , which focuses on DNNs with Sigmoid activation functions via a partition-refinement approach. Later, Katz\net al.  and  independently implemented Reluplex and Planet, two SMT solvers to verify DNNs with ReLU activation function on properties expressible with SMT constraints. Recently, methods based on abstract interpretation attracts more attention, which is to propagate sets in a sound (i.e., over-approximate) way [ref]6 and is more efficient. There are many widely used abstract domains, such as intervals 1, and star-sets . A method based on zonotope abstract domains is proposed in [ref]11, which works for any piece linear activation function with great scalability. Then, it is further improved  for obtaining tighter results via imposing abstract transformation on ReLU, Tanh and Sigmoid.  proposed specialized abstract zonotope transformers for handling NNs with ReLU, Sigmoid and Tanh activation functions.  proposes an abstract domain that combines floating point polyhedra with intervals to over-approximate output reachable sets. Subsequently, a spurious region guided approach is proposed to infer tighter output reachable sets  based on the method in .  abstracts an NN by a polynomial, which has the advantage that dependencies can in principle be preserved. This approach can be precise in practice for small input sets. Afterwards,  approximates Lipschitz-continuous NNs with Bernstein polynomials.  transforms a neural network with Sigmoid activation functions into a hybrid automaton and then uses existing reachability analysis methods for the hybrid automaton to perform reachability computations.  proposed a maximum sensitivity based approach for solving safety verification problems for multi-layer perceptrons with monotonic activation functions. In this approach, an exhaustive search of the input set is enabled by discretizing input space to compute output reachable set which consists of a union of reachtubes. Neural ODEs were first introduced in 2018, which exhibit considerable computational efficiency on time-series modeling tasks . Recent years have witnessed an increase use of them on real-world applications  . However, the verification techniques for Neural ODEs are rare and still in fancy. The first reachability technique for Neural ODEs\nappeared in , which proposed Stochastic Lagrangian reachability, an abstraction-based technique for constructing an over-approximation of the output reachable set with probabilistic guarantees. Later, this method was improved and implemented in a tool GoTube , which is able to perform reachability analysis for long time horizons. Since these methods only provide stochastic bounds on the computed over-approximation and thus cannot provide formal guarantees on the satisfaction of safety properties,  presented a deterministic verification framework for a general class of Neural ODEs with multiple continuous- and discrete-time layers. Based on entire input sets, all the aforementioned works focus on developing computational techniques for reachability analysis and safety verification of appropriate NNs. In contrast, the present work shifts this focus to topological analysis of NNs and guides reachability computations on subsets of the input set rather than the entire input set, reducing computation burdens and thus increasing the power of existing safety verification methods for NNs. Although there are studies on topological properties of NNs   , there is no work on the utilization of homeomorphism property to analyze their reachability and safety verification problems, to the best of our knowledge.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: on properties expressible with SMT constraints.
