Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Scalable Consensus Protocols for PoW based Blockchain and blockDAG\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe parameters used in our frameworks are listed in TABLE I. In this work, we stick to Bitcoin’s model [ref]1 in every aspect – transactions, blocks, PoW, information propagation in the P2P network [ref]4. The only difference between the optimal longest chain rule and unsupervised learning based consensus protocol is the ledger structure. The first one is similar to the bitcoin\nprotocol. In the second framework, instead of a reference\nto a single block, the newly created block references more than one block in its header and generates the ledger’s DAG structure. We refer to the models in , for delay diameter D𝐷D, where the bitcoin P2P network is considered as an Erdo¨¨𝑜\\ddot{o}s - Re´´𝑒\\acute{e}nyi random network topology. The model specified in  and  is used for blockDAG structure of the ledger, where the miners and other nodes follow the mining protocol - When a miner/node creates/receives a block, broadcast it to all neighboring peers in V𝑉V. More formally, if c1,c2∈Vsubscript𝑐1subscript𝑐2𝑉c_{1},c_{2}\\in V, then Gtc1⊆Gt+Dc2superscriptsubscript𝐺𝑡subscript𝑐1superscriptsubscript𝐺𝑡𝐷subscript𝑐2G_{t}^{c_{1}}\\subseteq G_{t+D}^{c_{2}}. while creating a new block, the miner includes references to all the leaf-blocks/tips (observed in its local copy of the DAG (Gtcsuperscriptsubscript𝐺𝑡𝑐G_{t}^{c})) in its block header. As per the mining protocol, every new block 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B} reaches the entire network in time D𝐷D. While creating a new block at time t𝑡t, the honest miner refers to all the published blocks before time t−D𝑡𝐷t-D, i.e., t​i​p​s∈Gt−Dc𝑡𝑖𝑝𝑠superscriptsubscript𝐺𝑡𝐷𝑐tips\\in G_{t-D}^{c}. If 𝐁′superscript𝐁′\\mathbf{B^{\\prime}}s miner is honest, then it broadcast 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B} to all its neighboring peers. So, any block 𝐂𝐂\\mathbf{C} created after time t+D𝑡𝐷t+D refer 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B} directly or indirectly.\nEven though the blocks created between [t−D,t+D]𝑡𝐷𝑡𝐷[t-D,t+D] are neither referred by 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B} nor referred 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B}, the 𝐁′superscript𝐁′\\mathbf{B^{\\prime}}s miner receives all those blocks by the time t+2​D𝑡2𝐷t+2D.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: The parameters used in our frameworks are listed in TABLE I.
