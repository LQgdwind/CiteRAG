      "content": "Paper Title: Is Imitation All You Need? Generalized Decision-Making with Dual-Phase Training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe propose an Encoder-Decoder Control Transformer to process state-action interaction sequences, as illustrated in Figure 2.\nThe implementation details of each component in the Enc-Dec Control Transformer are outlined below. State tokenizer. We utilize a ViT model¬†[ref]12 to tokenize raw pixel states. To reduce the computational burden of dealing with sequential decision-making tasks, we leverage an attention-based Information Bottleneck (IB) to further compress the number of tokens so as to speed up training and inference (Fig.¬†2-left). Specifically, we use TokenLearner¬† which is an element-wise attention module that learns to soft-select image tokens, passing only the important ones to subsequent layers. The inclusion of TokenLearner sub-samples the 196 state tokens that come out of ViT to just 8 tokens that are then passed to the Transformer decoder layers. Action tokenizer. To handle both continuous and discrete action spaces in our two domains, we adapt a strategy similar to GATO¬†[ref]32 by discretizing continuous actions into bins. We first flatten the actions into sequences of floating point values in row-major order, and then\ndiscretizing them into 256 uniform bins. Discrete actions are tokenized into 256 bins in the same way. Transformer decoder. Our transformer decoder architecture is similar to Control Transformer¬†[ref]36, but with a modification. In our approach, we encode each state into 8 tokens, which is different from SMART‚Äôs single token representation. This modification enables richer representation learning, making it suitable for more complex visual control environments. Prompt tokenizer. We tokenize prompts using a pretrained CLIP encoder¬†. For ‚Äúimage goal‚Äù prompts in Habitat, we use the CLIP image encoder, while for ‚Äúobject goal‚Äù prompts in Habitat and ‚Äúlanguage instruction‚Äù prompts in MetaWorld, we use the CLIP text encoder. A learnable linear layer is added on top of the CLIP encoders to map all prompts to prompt tokens with the same dimensions. During training in both phases, we freeze the CLIP encoders. XAtten. layer. We condition the Transformer decoder by training it to learn from the prompt sequence through a series of cross-attention layers. The output sequence from each cross-attention layer is computed by softmax(qH‚ÄãkpTd)‚ÄãvPsubscriptùëûùêªsuperscriptsubscriptùëòùëùùëáùëësubscriptùë£ùëÉ(\\frac{q_{H}k_{p}^{T}}{\\sqrt{d}})v_{P}, where HùêªH is the sequence of episodes, PùëÉP is prompt, and dùëëd is the embedding dimension. This design builds a stronger connection between the prompts and the demonstrations, which is an improvement over prefix-style prompting approaches¬†[ref]32. We will show the benefits of this design in Sec.¬†5.4.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: interaction sequences, as illustrated in Figure 2.\nThe implementation details of each component in the Enc-Dec Control Transformer are outlined below.
