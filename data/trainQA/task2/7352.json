      "content": "Paper Title: Distance and Collision Probability Estimation from Gaussian Surface Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEuclidean distance fields and their gradients (often computed\nusing finite differencing) are used for collision\navoidance  and optimization-based\nmotion planning , respectively.\nThese values are calculated by fusing point clouds\nacquired by range sensors (e.g., LiDARs and depth cameras) and\nprocessed on-board the robot.\nTo enable safe navigation outside the sensor field-of-view (FoV), the robot\nmust maintain a map comprised of past fused\nobservations.\nThis is especially important when limited FoV sensors,\nlike depth cameras, are used onboard the\nrobot . Existing Euclidean distance and\ngradient estimation methods create a spatially discretized map and compute distance\nand gradient values in each\ncell via a Breadth-First Search , which is computationally\nexpensive in large workspaces or when small grid cells are employed .\nTo overcome the limitations of cell based methods, Gaussian\nProcess (GP) based methods were developed, which implicitly represent the\nsurface and enable continuous-space Euclidean distance and gradient\ncalculation   .\nA GP is regressed from raw point cloud data and used to infer\nthe Euclidean distance and gradient at\nany test point in the workspace.\nA challenge with these methods is that the training time scales\nas the size of the input data increases, so optimization-based\nsubsampling must be introduced to enable spatial\nscalability [ref]53.\nIn contrast, Gaussian surface models (GSMs) (e.g.,\nmixture models  6 9 [ref]29\nand 3D splatting works   )\nprovide relatively compressed and high-fidelity point cloud models.\nThis work leverages the geometric interpretation of\nGSMs to calculate continuous-space Euclidean distance and gradients. Collision probabilities are used for motion planning under robot\nposition\nuncertainty  .\nLike Euclidean distance and gradient field methods, existing\nmethods that estimate collision probability from a surface\npoint cloud utilize probabilistic occupancy queries from a\ndiscrete   or\ncontinuous surface representation .\nThese maps require storing free space\ncells   \nor raw point clouds 1, leading to high\nmemory usage. GSMs can alleviate these challenges by effectively compressing point clouds into\na finite set of ellipsoids. However,\nexisting occupancy estimation frameworks leveraging GSMs either fit\nGaussian components in free\nspace 6 0 or Monte\nCarlo ray trace through a local discrete\ngrid 9 7. Robot\npose uncertainty is not considered. This\npaper bridges these gaps by proposing a collision probability\nestimation method, which uses only the surface Gaussians and\naccounts for Gaussian uncertainty in the robot position. All the aforementioned techniques require approximating the shape of the robot.\nSpherical approximations are widely used because inflating the obstacles\nwith the robot size for the purposes of collision avoidance results in\na simple configuration space (C-space) . However,\nrecent results in ellipsoidal approximations demonstrate superior planning\nperformance, especially in cluttered and narrow\nenvironments 5 for both\nrigid 2 and articulated robots .\nThese approximations are also used for human bodies in a\ndynamic environment  3.\nConsequently, in this work the proposed methods use an ellipsoidal robot body approximation. To summarize, given an ellipsoidal robot body model and a set of Gaussians representing\nthe surface point cloud, this paper contributes (Fig. 1) methods to compute the continuous-space Euclidean distance between the robot body and surface, the gradient of this distance, and the collision probability when the robot position is a Gaussian random variable. These methods are evaluated using 2D and 3D surface point clouds from simulation\nand real-world environments.

Section II lists prior work related to the contributions. Section III\ndetails the proposed methods. The evaluation is presented in Section IV. Concluding\nremarks and directions for future work are in Section V.\n\nReference markers found: [53]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]53: workspace.\nA challenge with these methods is that the training time scales\nas the size of the input data increases, so optimization-based\nsubsampling must be introduced to enable spatial\nscalability [ref]53.\nIn contrast, Gaussian surface models (GSMs) (e.g.,\nmixture models  6 9 [ref]29\nand 3D splatting works   )\nprovide relatively compressed and high-fidelity point cloud models.\nThis work\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
