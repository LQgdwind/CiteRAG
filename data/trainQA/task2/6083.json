      "content": "Paper Title: Questions and Concerns About Google’s Quantum Supremacy Claim\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe will now give a brief summary of the Google experiment,\nGoogle’s noise model,\nGoogle’s ℱX​E​Bsubscriptℱ𝑋𝐸𝐵{\\mathcal{F}}_{XEB} linear cross-entropy fidelity estimator,\nand Google’s Formula (77) in  for predicting the fidelity\nof a circuit from the fidelity\nof its components. For more details the reader is referred to   . The Google experiment is based on the building of a quantum computer (circuit),\nwith n𝑛n superconducting qubits,\nthat performs m𝑚m rounds of computation.\nThe computation is carried out by 1-qubit and 2-qubit gates.\nAt the end of the computation the qubits are measured, leading\nto a string of zeroes and ones of length n𝑛n.\nThe ultimate experiment was for n=53𝑛53n=53 and m=20𝑚20m=20. It involved\n1113 1-qubit gates and 430 2-qubit gates. For that experiment\nthe Google team produced a sample of three million 0-1 vectors of length 53. The circuits used in the Google experiment had the following structure.\nThe qubits were arranged on a planar grid, and so a single qubit was identified via two\ncoordinates, like qubit (3,3)33(3,3). The circuits had two types of layers:\none type of layer consists of 2-gates acting on pairs of (neighboring) qubits. After each such layer of 2-gates there was another layer of randomly chosen 1-gates acting on every qubit. (The number m𝑚m of layers of 2-gates is referred to as the depth of the circuit.) The layers of 1-gates consist of the “programmable” ingredient in the experiment.222\nThe entire randomness in the Google experiment for more than 900 circuits is determined by the choice of random 1-gates for ten large random circuits. The same random 1-gates used for the k𝑘kth experiment (k=0,1,…,9𝑘01…9k=0,1,\\dots,9) of the largest full circuits\nwith n=53𝑛53n=53 qubits, and depth m=20𝑚20m=20, were also used for all types of circuits (i.e., full, elided, and patch circuits), patterns, number of qubits n𝑛n, and depth m𝑚m. The layers of 2-gates are fixed throughout the experiment according to a certain pattern. The pattern EFGH was used for circuits with numbers of qubits between 12 and 53 and of depth m=14𝑚14m=14, and a new pattern ABCDCDAB was later used for n=53𝑛53n=53 qubits and depths m=12,14,16,18,𝑚12141618m=12,14,16,18, and 202020.\nEach letter (like E) corresponds to a fixed set of 2-gates acting in parallel on the qubits; see Figure\n1. (For more details, see .) As part of their experiment the Google team also studied two simplified versions of their circuits, “elided circuits” and “patch circuits” that were based on removing some of the 2-gates of the “full” circuits. In particular, for patch circuits the qubits were divided into two separate non-interacting patches. Every circuit C𝐶C with n𝑛n qubits\ndescribes a probability distribution 𝐏C​(x)subscript𝐏𝐶𝑥{\\bf P}_{C}(x) for 0-1 vectors of length n𝑛n.\n(In fact, it describes a 2nsuperscript2𝑛2^{n}-dimensional vector of complex amplitudes; for every 0-1 vector\nx𝑥x, there is an associated amplitude z​(x)𝑧𝑥z(x) and 𝐏C​(x)=|z​(x)|2.subscript𝐏𝐶𝑥superscript𝑧𝑥2{\\bf P}_{C}(x)=|z(x)|^{2}.)\nThe quantum computer enables one to sample according to the probability distribution 𝐏C​(x)subscript𝐏𝐶𝑥{\\bf P}_{C}(x),\nwith a considerable amount of noise. When n𝑛n and m𝑚m are not too large, classical simulations enable one to compute the amplitudes themselves (and hence the probabilities 𝐏C​(x)subscript𝐏𝐶𝑥{\\bf P}_{C}(x)). Google’s quantum supremacy claim is based on the fact that these classical simulations quickly become infeasible as n𝑛n and m𝑚m grow. When C𝐶C is a random circuit, the probability distribution 𝐏C​(x)subscript𝐏𝐶𝑥{\\bf P}_{C}(x) behaves like a Porter–Thomas distribution; namely, the individual probabilities behave as if they have random statistically independent values drawn from the exponential distribution (that are then normalized).\nOf course, an instance of a Porter–Thomas distribution depends on 2nsuperscript2𝑛2^{n} random variables,\nwhile the 2nsuperscript2𝑛2^{n} values of 𝐏C​(x)subscript𝐏𝐶𝑥{\\bf P}_{C}(x) depend on the circuit C𝐶C whose description requires a polynomial number of parameters in n𝑛n. The Google basic noise model is where ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi is the fidelity, a parameter that roughly describes the quality of the sample. Roughly speaking, Google’s noise model assumes that if all components of the quantum computer operate without errors then a bitstring will be drawn according to 𝐏C​(x)subscript𝐏𝐶𝑥{\\bf P}_{C}(x), and if an error occurs then the quantum computer will produce a random uniformly distributed bitstring. Remark: For a noisy quantum circuit, if\nρ𝜌\\rho is the density matrix of the ideal state (the state of a noiseless quantum computer running the circuit C𝐶C) and ψ𝜓\\psi is the density matrix for the noisy state,\nthen the fidelity ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi is defined by We note that the fidelity ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi itself cannot be read from the distribution of the samples produced by the quantum computer. Given an unlimited sample size (or samples large enough such that the empirical distribution is a good approximation to the noisy distribution) and unlimited computational power,\nit is an interesting question to find the best way to estimate the fidelity.\nAnother important question that is very relevant to NISQ experiments is to find the best ways to estimate the fidelity given sample sizes that are only polynomial (in (1/ϕ1italic-ϕ1/\\phi)). Based on their noise model (and the fact that the distribution 𝐏Csubscript𝐏𝐶{\\bf P}_{C} is an instance of a Porter–Thomas distribution), the Google paper describes a statistic called the linear cross-entropy estimator,\ndenoted by ℱX​E​Bsubscriptℱ𝑋𝐸𝐵{\\cal F}_{XEB} (and sometimes simply by X​E​B𝑋𝐸𝐵XEB).\nOnce the quantum computer produces a sequence 𝐱~~𝐱{\\bf\\tilde{x}} of N𝑁N\nbitstrings 𝐱~=(𝐱~(1),𝐱~(2),…,𝐱~(N))~𝐱superscript~𝐱1superscript~𝐱2…superscript~𝐱𝑁{\\bf\\tilde{x}}=({\\bf\\tilde{x}}^{(1)},{\\bf\\tilde{x}}^{(2)},\\dots,{\\bf\\tilde{x}}^{(N)}), the estimator ℱX​E​Bsubscriptℱ𝑋𝐸𝐵{\\cal F}_{XEB} of the fidelity is computed as follows: Computing ℱX​E​Bsubscriptℱ𝑋𝐸𝐵{\\cal F}_{XEB} requires knowledge of 𝐏C​(x)subscript𝐏𝐶𝑥{\\bf P}_{C}(x) for sampled bitstrings. The Google supremacy claim is also based on the following a priori prediction of the fidelity of a circuit based on the probabilities of error for the individual components (Formula (77) in\n): Here 𝒢1subscript𝒢1{\\cal G}_{1} is the set of 1-gates, 𝒢2subscript𝒢2{\\cal G}_{2} is\nthe set of 2-gates, and\n𝒬𝒬{\\cal Q} is the set of qubits. For a gate g𝑔g, the term egsubscript𝑒𝑔e_{g} in the\nformula refers to the probability of an error of the individual gate g𝑔g.\nFor a qubit q𝑞q, eqsubscript𝑒𝑞e_{q} is the probability of a readout error when we measure the qubit q𝑞q. The Google supremacy paper  made two crucial claims regarding the ultimate 53-qubit samples. The fidelity ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi of their sample is above 1/1000110001/1000. Producing a sample of similar fidelity\nwould take 10,000 years on a classical supercomputer. For claim (A) regarding the value of ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi,\nthe argument relies on an extrapolation argument that has two ingredients.\nOne ingredient is a few hundred experiments in the classically tractable regime, namely, the\nregime where the probability distribution 𝐏Csubscript𝐏𝐶{\\bf P}_{C} can be\ncomputed by a classical computer and the performance of the\nquantum computer can be tested directly. The other\ningredient is the theoretical formula (4) for predicting the fidelity.\nAccording to the paper, the fidelity of\nentire circuits closely agrees with the prediction of Formula (4)\n(Formula (77) in ) with a deviation below 10–20 percent.\nThere are more than 700 reported experiments in the\nclassically tractable regime, including ones carried out on simplified\ncircuits (which are easier to simulate on classical computers). These experiments\nsupport the claim that the\nprediction given by Formula (77) for the fidelity is indeed very robust and applies\nto the 53-qubit circuit in the supremacy regime. For claim (B) regarding the classical difficulty, the Google team\nmainly relies on extrapolation from the running time of a\nspecific algorithm they used. They also rely on the computational complexity\nsupport for the assertion\nthat the task at hand is asymptotically difficult. Remarks: 1. Claim (B) and with it the entire quantum supremacy claim, have largely been refuted by the research of several groups     [ref]14 [ref]29  (among others)\nthat exhibited classical algorithms that are ten\norders of magnitude faster than those used in the Google paper.\nThis was achieved, for example, by Pan, Chen, and Zhang  in 2021.\nSee also Section 2.3. 2. Google’s ℱX​E​Bsubscriptℱ𝑋𝐸𝐵{\\cal F}_{XEB} fidelity estimator given by (3) which is used for the full and elided circuits does not apply for the patch circuits. For patch circuits the ℱX​E​Bsubscriptℱ𝑋𝐸𝐵{\\cal F}_{XEB} fidelity estimator is used separately for each patch and the two estimates are multiplied.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: the assertion\nthat the task at hand is asymptotically difficult.
