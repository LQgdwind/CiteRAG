Fix d∈ℕ≥1𝑑subscriptℕabsent1d\\in\\mathbb{N}_{\\geq 1}.\nThe Clifford algebra corresponding to the inner product space (ℝd,⟨−,−⟩)superscriptℝ𝑑\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d},\\langle-,-\\rangle\\right), which we denote by 𝖢𝗅​(d)𝖢𝗅𝑑\\mathsf{Cl}(d), is the quotient of the tensor algebra 𝖳​(ℝd)𝖳superscriptℝ𝑑\\mathsf{T}(\\mathbb{R}^{d}) by the two-sided ideal generated by elements of the form v⊗w+w⊗v−2​⟨v,w⟩​ 1tensor-product𝑣𝑤tensor-product𝑤𝑣2𝑣𝑤1v\\otimes w+w\\otimes v-2\\langle v,w\\rangle\\,\\mathbf{1}, for v,w∈ℝd𝑣𝑤superscriptℝ𝑑v,w\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d}, where 𝟏1\\mathbf{1} is the unit of 𝖳​(ℝd)𝖳superscriptℝ𝑑\\mathsf{T}(\\mathbb{R}^{d}).\nWe denote the product of two elements x,y∈𝖢𝗅​(d)𝑥𝑦𝖢𝗅𝑑x,y\\in\\mathsf{Cl}(d) by x⋅y∈𝖢𝗅​(d)⋅𝑥𝑦𝖢𝗅𝑑x\\cdot y\\in\\mathsf{Cl}(d). Here we are using the “positive convention” for Clifford algebras, as we want the 𝖯𝗂𝗇𝖯𝗂𝗇\\mathsf{Pin} group to be the group 𝖯𝗂𝗇+superscript𝖯𝗂𝗇\\mathsf{Pin}^{+} discussed in, e.g., [ref]36.\nWe refer the interested reader to [36, Section 1] for further details about this choice. A more concrete description of 𝖢𝗅​(d)𝖢𝗅𝑑\\mathsf{Cl}(d) is given by the free non-commutative ℝℝ\\mathbb{R}-algebra generated by elements {e1,…,ed}subscript𝑒1…subscript𝑒𝑑\\{e_{1},\\dots,e_{d}\\} subject to the relations ei⋅ej=−ej⋅ei⋅subscript𝑒𝑖subscript𝑒𝑗⋅subscript𝑒𝑗subscript𝑒𝑖e_{i}\\cdot e_{j}=-e_{j}\\cdot e_{i} if i>j𝑖𝑗i>j, and ei2=𝟏superscriptsubscript𝑒𝑖21e_{i}^{2}=\\mathbf{1}.\nThis description makes it evident that dim(𝖢𝗅​(d))=2ddimension𝖢𝗅𝑑superscript2𝑑\\dim(\\mathsf{Cl}(d))=2^{d}, since the elements of the form ei1​⋯​eiksubscript𝑒subscript𝑖1⋯subscript𝑒subscript𝑖𝑘e_{i_{1}}\\cdots e_{i_{k}} for i1<⋯<iksubscript𝑖1⋯subscript𝑖𝑘i_{1}<\\dots<i_{k} form a basis of 𝖢𝗅​(d)𝖢𝗅𝑑\\mathsf{Cl}(d) ([8, Chapter 1, Corollary 6.7]). If v∈ℝd𝑣superscriptℝ𝑑v\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d} is of unit length, then it is invertible when seen as an element of 𝖢𝗅​(d)𝖢𝗅𝑑\\mathsf{Cl}(d), since v⋅v=𝟏⋅𝑣𝑣1v\\cdot v=\\mathbf{1}.\nLet 𝖯𝗂𝗇​(d)⊆𝖢𝗅​(d)×𝖯𝗂𝗇𝑑𝖢𝗅superscript𝑑\\mathsf{Pin}(d)\\subseteq\\mathsf{Cl}(d)^{\\times} be the subgroup of the group of units of 𝖢𝗅​(d)𝖢𝗅𝑑\\mathsf{Cl}(d) generated by elements v∈ℝd𝑣superscriptℝ𝑑v\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d} of unit length.\nThere is a group morphism ρ:𝖯𝗂𝗇​(d)→O​(d):𝜌→𝖯𝗂𝗇𝑑𝑂𝑑\\rho:\\mathsf{Pin}(d)\\to O(d) that is defined on generators by mapping v∈ℝd𝑣superscriptℝ𝑑v\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d} with ‖v‖=1norm𝑣1\\|v\\|=1 to the orthogonal transformation given by reflection about the hyperplane orthogonal to v𝑣v.\nThis morphism is surjective, and its kernel consists of {±𝟏}plus-or-minus1\\{\\pm\\mathbf{1}\\} ([36, Section 1]).\nThis gives a central sequence of Lie groups ℤ/2≅{±𝟏}→𝖯𝗂𝗇​(d)→O​(d)ℤ2plus-or-minus1→𝖯𝗂𝗇𝑑→𝑂𝑑\\mathbb{Z}/2\\cong\\{\\pm\\mathbf{1}\\}\\to\\mathsf{Pin}(d)\\to O(d). Let 𝒰𝒰\\mathcal{U} be a cover of a topological space, with the property that non-empty binary intersections are locally path connected and simply connected.\nLet ε≤1𝜀1\\varepsilon\\leq 1.\nAn analogous analysis to the one made for the Euler class shows that, applying 6.6 to the extension 1→ℤ/2→𝖯𝗂𝗇​(d)→O​(d)→1→1ℤ2→𝖯𝗂𝗇𝑑→𝑂𝑑→11\\to\\mathbb{Z}/2\\to\\mathsf{Pin}(d)\\to O(d)\\to 1, we get a map 𝗌𝗐2:𝖧ˇε1​(𝒰;O​(d))→𝖧ˇ2​(𝒰;ℤ/2):subscript𝗌𝗐2→subscriptsuperscriptˇ𝖧1𝜀𝒰𝑂𝑑superscriptˇ𝖧2𝒰ℤ2\\mathsf{sw}_{2}:\\check{\\mathsf{H}}^{1}_{\\varepsilon}\\left(\\mathcal{U};O(d)\\right)\\to\\check{\\mathsf{H}}^{2}\\left(\\mathcal{U};\\mathbb{Z}/2\\right).\nAnd that 𝗌𝗐2subscript𝗌𝗐2\\mathsf{sw}_{2} is such that, if Ω,Ω′∈𝖧ˇε1​(𝒰;O​(d))ΩsuperscriptΩ′subscriptsuperscriptˇ𝖧1𝜀𝒰𝑂𝑑\\Omega,\\Omega^{\\prime}\\in\\check{\\mathsf{H}}^{1}_{\\varepsilon}\\left(\\mathcal{U};O(d)\\right) satisfy 𝖽𝖹​(Ω,Ω′)<1subscript𝖽𝖹ΩsuperscriptΩ′1\\mathsf{d}_{\\mathsf{Z}}\\left(\\Omega,\\Omega^{\\prime}\\right)<1, then 𝗌𝗐2​(Ω)=𝗌𝗐2​(Ω′)∈𝖧ˇ2​(𝒰;ℤ/2)subscript𝗌𝗐2Ωsubscript𝗌𝗐2superscriptΩ′superscriptˇ𝖧2𝒰ℤ2\\mathsf{sw}_{2}(\\Omega)=\\mathsf{sw}_{2}(\\Omega^{\\prime})\\in\\check{\\mathsf{H}}^{2}\\left(\\mathcal{U};\\mathbb{Z}/2\\right). In particular, if K𝐾K is a simplicial complex, we get a 111-stable algorithm 𝗌𝗐2:𝖣𝖧ε1​(K;O​(d))→H2​(K;ℤ/2):subscript𝗌𝗐2→subscriptsuperscript𝖣𝖧1𝜀𝐾𝑂𝑑superscript𝐻2𝐾ℤ2\\mathsf{sw}_{2}:\\mathsf{DH}^{1}_{\\varepsilon}\\left(K;O(d)\\right)\\to H^{2}(K;\\mathbb{Z}/2). \n\n\n\n\nInput: A simplicial complex K𝐾K with vertices {1,…,k}1…𝑘\\{1,\\dots,k\\} and a discrete approximate cocycle Ω∈𝖣𝖹ε1​(K;O​(d))Ωsubscriptsuperscript𝖣𝖹1𝜀𝐾𝑂𝑑\\Omega\\in\\mathsf{DZ}^{1}_{\\varepsilon}\\left(K;O(d)\\right) with ε≤1𝜀1\\varepsilon\\leq 1.\n\n\n\nOutput: A simplicial cocycle 𝗌𝗐2​(Ω)∈Z2​(K;ℤ/2)subscript𝗌𝗐2Ωsuperscript𝑍2𝐾ℤ2\\mathsf{sw}_{2}(\\Omega)\\in Z^{2}(K;\\mathbb{Z}/2).\n\n1.\n\nFor each (i​j)𝑖𝑗(ij) 111-simplex of K𝐾K with i<j𝑖𝑗i<j let Λi​j∈𝖯𝗂𝗇​(d)subscriptΛ𝑖𝑗𝖯𝗂𝗇𝑑\\Lambda_{ij}\\in\\mathsf{Pin}(d) be a lift of Ωi​j∈O​(d)subscriptΩ𝑖𝑗𝑂𝑑\\Omega_{ij}\\in O(d).\n\n2.\n\nFor each (i​j​k)𝑖𝑗𝑘(ijk) 222-simplex of K𝐾K with i<j<k𝑖𝑗𝑘i<j<k let 𝗌𝗐2​(Ω)i​j​k∈{±𝟏}⊆𝖯𝗂𝗇​(d)subscript𝗌𝗐2subscriptΩ𝑖𝑗𝑘plus-or-minus1𝖯𝗂𝗇𝑑\\mathsf{sw}_{2}(\\Omega)_{ijk}\\in\\{\\pm\\mathbf{1}\\}\\subseteq\\mathsf{Pin}(d) the closest element to Λi​j​Λj​k​Λi​k−1∈𝖯𝗂𝗇​(d)subscriptΛ𝑖𝑗subscriptΛ𝑗𝑘superscriptsubscriptΛ𝑖𝑘1𝖯𝗂𝗇𝑑\\Lambda_{ij}\\Lambda_{jk}\\Lambda_{ik}^{-1}\\in\\mathsf{Pin}(d), using the geodesic distance of 𝖯𝗂𝗇​(d)𝖯𝗂𝗇𝑑\\mathsf{Pin}(d).\n\n\n algorithm]pseudocode-sw2 In order to see that 𝗌𝗐2subscript𝗌𝗐2\\mathsf{sw}_{2} is really an algorithm, we must explain how to lift elements from O​(d)𝑂𝑑O(d) to 𝖯𝗂𝗇​(d)𝖯𝗂𝗇𝑑\\mathsf{Pin}(d), how to multiply elements in 𝖯𝗂𝗇​(d)𝖯𝗂𝗇𝑑\\mathsf{Pin}(d), and how to decide, given an element x∈𝖯𝗂𝗇​(d)𝑥𝖯𝗂𝗇𝑑x\\in\\mathsf{Pin}(d), which one of 𝟏1\\mathbf{1} or −𝟏1-\\mathbf{1} is closest to it in the geodesic distance. We see 𝖯𝗂𝗇​(d)𝖯𝗂𝗇𝑑\\mathsf{Pin}(d) as a subset of the Clifford algebra, which we represent as in 6.11.\nBy definition of the map ρ:𝖯𝗂𝗇​(d)→O​(d):𝜌→𝖯𝗂𝗇𝑑𝑂𝑑\\rho:\\mathsf{Pin}(d)\\to O(d), to lift a matrix M∈O​(d)𝑀𝑂𝑑M\\in O(d) to an element of 𝖯𝗂𝗇​(d)𝖯𝗂𝗇𝑑\\mathsf{Pin}(d), we must write M𝑀M as a product of reflection matrices, which is exactly what the QR factorization of an orthogonal matrix by means of Householder reflections does ([31, Theorem 2.1.14]). In order to multiply elements of 𝖯𝗂𝗇​(d)𝖯𝗂𝗇𝑑\\mathsf{Pin}(d), we again use the representation of 6.11.\nWe can thus multiply elements of 𝖯𝗂𝗇​(d)𝖯𝗂𝗇𝑑\\mathsf{Pin}(d) in 𝒪​(4d)𝒪superscript4𝑑\\mathcal{O}(4^{d}) time. The problem of deciding which of 𝟏1\\mathbf{1} or −𝟏1-\\mathbf{1} is closest to an arbitrary element of 𝖯𝗂𝗇​(d)𝖯𝗂𝗇𝑑\\mathsf{Pin}(d) in the geodesic distance is more involved, as it depends on the geometry of 𝖯𝗂𝗇​(d)𝖯𝗂𝗇𝑑\\mathsf{Pin}(d).\nWe explain how this can be done explicitly for the cases d=2,3,4𝑑234d=2,3,4, using extraordinary isomorphisms.\nThe same idea works for d=5,6𝑑56d=5,6, but one must be able to compute geodesic distances in S​p​(4)𝑆𝑝4Sp(4) and S​U​(4)𝑆𝑈4SU(4). We first remark that, since O​(d)𝑂𝑑O(d) has two connected components, so must 𝖯𝗂𝗇​(d)𝖯𝗂𝗇𝑑\\mathsf{Pin}(d), and that +𝟏1+\\mathbf{1} and −𝟏1-\\mathbf{1} belong to the same connected component of 𝖯𝗂𝗇​(d)𝖯𝗂𝗇𝑑\\mathsf{Pin}(d), as they are both preimages of the identity matrix under the covering map 𝖯𝗂𝗇​(d)→O​(d)→𝖯𝗂𝗇𝑑𝑂𝑑\\mathsf{Pin}(d)\\to O(d).\nLet the spin group 𝖲𝗉𝗂𝗇​(d)⊆𝖯𝗂𝗇​(d)𝖲𝗉𝗂𝗇𝑑𝖯𝗂𝗇𝑑\\mathsf{Spin}(d)\\subseteq\\mathsf{Pin}(d) be the connected component of +𝟏1+\\mathbf{1}.\nChecking if x∈𝖯𝗂𝗇​(d)𝑥𝖯𝗂𝗇𝑑x\\in\\mathsf{Pin}(d) belongs to 𝖲𝗉𝗂𝗇​(d)𝖲𝗉𝗂𝗇𝑑\\mathsf{Spin}(d) is easy, since it amounts to checking if its image in O​(d)𝑂𝑑O(d) has positive determinant. If x∈𝖯𝗂𝗇​(d)𝑥𝖯𝗂𝗇𝑑x\\in\\mathsf{Pin}(d) does not belong to 𝖲𝗉𝗂𝗇​(d)𝖲𝗉𝗂𝗇𝑑\\mathsf{Spin}(d), then its distance to +𝟏1+\\mathbf{1} is the same as the distance to −𝟏1-\\mathbf{1}, namely infinity.\nWith this in mind, we may assume that x∈𝖲𝗉𝗂𝗇​(d)𝑥𝖲𝗉𝗂𝗇𝑑x\\in\\mathsf{Spin}(d) and that we want to know if x𝑥x is closest to +𝟏1+\\mathbf{1} or to −𝟏1-\\mathbf{1} in the geodesic distance of 𝖲𝗉𝗂𝗇​(d)𝖲𝗉𝗂𝗇𝑑\\mathsf{Spin}(d). For explicit formulas for the extraordinary isomorphisms mentioned below, see the example after Lemma 1.8.3 in  or .\nOne should keep in mind that  is working with the “negative convention” for the Clifford algebra, and thus the isomorphisms are given for 𝖲𝗉𝗂𝗇​(d)⊆𝖢𝗅−​(d)𝖲𝗉𝗂𝗇𝑑superscript𝖢𝗅𝑑\\mathsf{Spin}(d)\\subseteq\\mathsf{Cl}^{-}(d); but it is not hard to modify their formulas to get the isomorphisms when 𝖲𝗉𝗂𝗇​(d)⊆𝖢𝗅​(d)𝖲𝗉𝗂𝗇𝑑𝖢𝗅𝑑\\mathsf{Spin}(d)\\subseteq\\mathsf{Cl}(d). In this case, 𝖲𝗉𝗂𝗇​(d)𝖲𝗉𝗂𝗇𝑑\\mathsf{Spin}(d) is isomorphic to the circle as Lie groups,\nso the geodesic distance on 𝖲𝗉𝗂𝗇​(2)𝖲𝗉𝗂𝗇2\\mathsf{Spin}(2) can be computed, up to a multiplicative constant, using arclengths on the circle.\nNote that the multiplicative constant is inconsequential for the purposes of determining if an element is closer to +𝟏1+\\mathbf{1} or to −𝟏1-\\mathbf{1}. In this case, 𝖲𝗉𝗂𝗇​(d)𝖲𝗉𝗂𝗇𝑑\\mathsf{Spin}(d) is isomorphic to S​U​(2)𝑆𝑈2SU(2), which in turn is diffeomorphic to the 333-sphere S3superscript𝑆3S^{3}.\nThe geodesic distance is again computed, up to a multiplicative constant, using arcs.\n In this case, 𝖲𝗉𝗂𝗇​(d)𝖲𝗉𝗂𝗇𝑑\\mathsf{Spin}(d) is isomorphic to S​U​(2)×S​U​(2)𝑆𝑈2𝑆𝑈2SU(2)\\times SU(2), which in turn is diffeomorphic to S3×S3superscript𝑆3superscript𝑆3S^{3}\\times S^{3}.\nMoreover, the Riemannian metric on 𝖲𝗉𝗂𝗇​(4)𝖲𝗉𝗂𝗇4\\mathsf{Spin}(4) induced by the double cover 𝖲𝗉𝗂𝗇​(4)→S​O​(4)→𝖲𝗉𝗂𝗇4𝑆𝑂4\\mathsf{Spin}(4)\\to SO(4) coincides, up to a multiplicative constant, with the product metric on S3×S3superscript𝑆3superscript𝑆3S^{3}\\times S^{3}, where the two copies of S3superscript𝑆3S^{3} are endowed with the Riemannian metric inherited from the inclusion S3⊆ℝ4superscript𝑆3superscriptℝ4S^{3}\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^{4}.\nTo compute the geodesic distance on S3×S3superscript𝑆3superscript𝑆3S^{3}\\times S^{3}, recall that a geodesic in a product Riemannian manifold corresponds to a pair of geodesics, one on each factor ([39, Problem 5-7]).\nThis implies that, in a product of complete Riemannian manifolds X×Y𝑋𝑌X\\times Y, the geodesic distance satisfies the Pythagorean theorem, meaning that the geodesic distance from (x,y)𝑥𝑦(x,y) to (x′,y′)superscript𝑥′superscript𝑦′(x^{\\prime},y^{\\prime}) is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the geodesic distances from x𝑥x to x′superscript𝑥′x^{\\prime} and from y𝑦y to y′superscript𝑦′y^{\\prime}.\n So, when d=2,3,4𝑑234d=2,3,4, this results in a numerical algorithm 𝗌𝗐2subscript𝗌𝗐2\\mathsf{sw}_{2} that is polynomial in the number of vertices of K𝐾K. We need a well known result; see, e.g., [36, Lemma 1.3]. Let 𝒰𝒰\\mathcal{U} be a cover of a locally contractible space, with the property that non-empty binary intersections are locally path connected and simply connected.\nIf ε=0𝜀0\\varepsilon=0, the construction 𝗌𝗐2:𝖧ˇε1​(𝒰;O​(d))→𝖧ˇ2​(𝒰;ℤ/2):subscript𝗌𝗐2→subscriptsuperscriptˇ𝖧1𝜀𝒰𝑂𝑑superscriptˇ𝖧2𝒰ℤ2\\mathsf{sw}_{2}:\\check{\\mathsf{H}}^{1}_{\\varepsilon}\\left(\\mathcal{U};O(d)\\right)\\to\\check{\\mathsf{H}}^{2}\\left(\\mathcal{U};\\mathbb{Z}/2\\right) computes the second Stiefel–Whitney class of the vector bundle represented by the cocycle.∎ Note that, also by [36, Lemma 1.3], if we would have used the negative convention for the Clifford algebra, the algorithm would be computing 𝗌𝗐12+𝗌𝗐2superscriptsubscript𝗌𝗐12subscript𝗌𝗐2\\mathsf{sw}_{1}^{2}+\\mathsf{sw}_{2} instead of 𝗌𝗐2subscript𝗌𝗐2\\mathsf{sw}_{2}. The proof of the following proposition is analogous to the proof of 6.10, but uses 6.12 instead of 6.9. Let 𝒰𝒰\\mathcal{U} be a countable cover of a locally contractible, paracompact space B𝐵B, with the property that non-empty binary intersections are locally path connected and simply connected.\nLet ε<1/9𝜀19\\varepsilon<1/9 and let Ω∈𝖧ˇε1​(𝒰;O​(d))Ωsubscriptsuperscriptˇ𝖧1𝜀𝒰𝑂𝑑\\Omega\\in\\check{\\mathsf{H}}^{1}_{\\varepsilon}\\left(\\mathcal{U};O(d)\\right).\nThen 𝗌𝗐2​(Ω)∈𝖧ˇ2​(𝒰;ℤ/2)subscript𝗌𝗐2Ωsuperscriptˇ𝖧2𝒰ℤ2\\mathsf{sw}_{2}(\\Omega)\\in\\check{\\mathsf{H}}^{2}\\left(\\mathcal{U};\\mathbb{Z}/2\\right) is the second Stiefel–Whitney class of π∗​(𝖼𝗅​(Ω))subscript𝜋𝖼𝗅Ω\\pi_{*}(\\mathsf{cl}(\\Omega)).∎\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: describe this sequence, we introduce the Clifford algebra associated to the standard inner product of ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}.\nWe state some well known results whose proofs can be found in [ref]36, [38, Chapter 1], and [8, Chapter 1, Section 6].
