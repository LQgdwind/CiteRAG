      "content": "Paper Title: Style Transformer for Image Inversion and Editing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGenerative Adversarial Network (GAN)    has been significantly improved during recent years. Particularly, with the help of AdaIN  or it variation ModulatedConv, StyleGAN   is able to synthesize high resolution images with moderate quality. Therefore, utilizing the pretrained and fixed StyleGAN for downstream tasks becomes a hot research topic, especially in the editing task of image-to-image (I2I) translation 1     [ref]3. To edit a given real-world image, we first need to find out its input noise vector zùëßz or intermediate latent code wùë§w, which can faithfully reconstruct the specified real image using the pretrained generator. Then, the code is modified by an offset corresponding to the target attribute, so that it can be mapped into an edited image, while preserving the original details. Despite of the great efforts, inverting     [ref]33 or editing 1    [ref]3 images for StyleGAN is still challenging due to following reasons.\nFirst, there are several candidate latent embeddings. Existing methods [ref]33   reveal that different choices on them are critical. Compared to ZùëçZ or WùëäW space with a single 512-d vector, W+superscriptùëäW^{+} has the enough ability to describe image details, therefore it is suitable for inversion. In W+superscriptùëäW^{+}, each image is represented by 18 different codes, and each of them is 512-d. They are given to the generator to formulate features and final synthesis from low to high resolutions in sequence. However, the code in W+superscriptùëäW^{+} can not be well edited unless imposing enough regularization.\nSecond, the distribution in WùëäW or W+superscriptùëäW^{+} are highly complex. Real images only lie on the manifold in the space [ref]33. Moreover, different dimensions are often entangled for a single attribute, making independent editing difficult. This paper aims to improve the encoder-based image inversion and editing for StyleGAN at the same time. Inspired by the great success of transformer in image classification 0 3 and object detection  , we utilize it to find the appropriate latent code in W+superscriptùëäW^{+} space for image inversion and editing tasks. The basic idea is to regard latent codes in different generation stages as query tokens, and image features at different spatial positions as keys and values, then perform the multi-head cross-attention to update the queries in an iterative way. Meanwhile, before the cross-attention, the queries are also allowed to access others through the self-attention, to enhance the regularization on them, so the final codes given to the generator become tightly linked. Particularly, queries first interact with image features (keys) by comparing similarities between each query-key pair. Then they are organized into the attention matrix to dynamically weight the features (values) and update queries for the transformer block in next stage. The image features, used as keys and values, are obtained by a CNN encoder. To capture the image details at different resolutions, we employ a two-pyramid encoder proposed in  to provide multi-scale features as keys and values. Note that our model has the multiple cross-attentions from low to high resolutions, and the style queries are gradually updated by features at different scales. Therefore, general contents in queries are first formulated, and then refined by details in the higher resolution. After several times self- and cross-attentions, queries absorb enough details from the input image, so they can be utilized to invert it by the pretrained generator. We are further interested in the way to edit the codes for translating a specified attribute. Traditional approaches 1   assume the linear separations in the latent space for a binary attribute, so inverted code from different images are edited by the same direction. We argue that the identical direction is not optimal for the editing quality, and may reduce the result diversity. Inspired by  4, we divide the image editing in StyleGAN into two different types. One is label-based editing, in which only target label is specified. The other is reference-based editing, which requires another image to supply the desired style. For the former, a pretrained non-linear latent classifier is used to determine the direction. it computes a loss for the inverted code according to the target label, and its gradient is back-propagated to the code, giving the editing direction. In the latter case, we want to determine the exact editing vector from the reference. Therefore, the inverted code from the source is used as query, and from the reference as key and value. The cross-attention is performed between them. The parameters in the attention module is trained under the supervision from the latent classifier, encouraging the edited attribute to be similar with the reference and other attributes without any changes. The proposed editing method is able to give the diverse results while maintaining the quality of image. The contribution of the paper is summarized into following aspects. First, we propose novel multi-stage style transformer in W+superscriptùëäW^{+} space to invert image accurately. The transformer includes the self- and cross-attention modules, in which the style queries gradually get updated from the multi-scale image features. Second, we characterize the image editing in StyleGAN into label-based and reference-based, and use a non-linear classifier to generate the editing vector. Diverse and fidelity editing results are obtained.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: moderate quality.
