Early models for temporal graph learning focus on DTDGs  , which aggregate\ngraph snapshots and then apply static methods   ,\nor encode each snapshot to produce a series of embeddings 5 .\nMore recently, some work consider the CTDGs 1 9.\n   aggregates the messages from neighbors\nthrough a temporal aggregation module, which present superior performance.\nTo prevent the number of neighbors from growing without limitation as time flows,  uniformly samples the neighbors to improve the efficiency and stabilization.\n improves the neighbor sampling further by incorporating the temporal information, which samples the most recent neighbors.\nOur work proposes new approaches for utilizing temporal information for neighbor sampling.\nFirst, our expanded neighbor sampling approach\nreduces information redundancy\nand extends\nthe temporal scale of\nreceptive neighborhoods by inserting space\nbetween the sampled neighbors along\nthe time axis.\nSecond, beyond the unified sampling strategy,\nour TNS method provides the adaptive receptive neighborhood for every node at any time in a learnable way.\nOur methods improves the effectiveness of popular TGNs without increasing their time complexity.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: There has been a burst of remarkable work for representation learning on static graphs 6 [ref]5  [ref]9  ,\nbut the work on temporal graphs is much sparser.\nThere exist two main classes of temporal graphs: discrete-time dynamic graphs (DTDG)  and continuous-time dynamic graphs (CTDG)\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
