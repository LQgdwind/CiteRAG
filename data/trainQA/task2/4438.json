      "content": "Paper Title: Seeking Subjectivity in Visual Emotion Distribution Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUnlike any other creature on this planet, human beings are gifted with the power to express and understand emotions.\nEmotion is everywhere in our daily lives, which not only decides our joy and sorrow, but also affects our behaviors and decisions.\nTherefore, aiming at finding out people’s emotional reactions towards different visual stimuli, Visual Emotion Analysis (VEA) has recently become an emerging and attractive research topic in the computer vision community.\nVEA may bring potential value to related tasks (e.g., memorability prediction [ref]1 , image aesthetic assessment  , and social relation inference [ref]5 ), and will have great influence on wide applications (e.g., opinion mining  , smart advertising  , and mental disease treatment  ). There are a thousand Hamlets in a thousand people’s eyes.\nSimilarly, there are a thousand emotions in a thousand people’s eyes.\nEmotions are subjective, which may vary from one individual to another.\nIn Fig. 1(a), VEA has often been discussed as a single label classification problem, assigning a dominant emotion label to each affective image  [ref]14 .\nHowever, people’s emotional experiences towards one image may be different.\nThus, it is more rational to treat VEA in a Label Distribution Learning (LDL) paradigm, as in Fig. 1(b).\nResearchers have proposed several methods to address visual emotion distribution learning, which varied from the early traditional ones    to the recent deep learning ones  0 1 2  3.\nMost of the existing methods predicted the visual emotion distribution with a unified network, neglecting the subjectivity in its crowd voting process.\nIn reality, given an affective image, each individual is asked to vote for one emotion independently, where these votes are further summed up to form the distribution.\nTherefore, as shown in Fig. 1(c), we argue that it is more reasonable to take subjectivity into account, by simulating the crowd voting process in visual emotion distribution. In addition to computer vision, researchers in psychology 4 5 have also devoted themselves to exploring the unknown mystery in human emotions.\nAs shown in Fig. 2, psychologist Arnold proposed the Object-Appraisal-Emotion model to depict the emotion evocation process, where emotions are determined by both objects and appraisals 6.\nDifferent individuals may evoke distinct emotions towards the same object due to their subjective appraisals.\nFor each individual, past objects and their corresponding emotions are recorded in the affective memory, which further impacts the present emotional experience.\nWith more and more affective memories being stored and organized, an individual’s subjective appraisal gradually formed.\nBased on the above model, we believe that the diversity in visual emotion distribution is caused by subjective appraisals, which are formed by distinct affective memories of different individuals. Therefore, we propose a novel Subjectivity Appraise-and-Match Network (SAMNet), aiming at learning visual emotion distribution in a subjective manner.\nConsidering the diversity in crowd emotions, we first propose the Subjectivity Appraising with multiple branches, where each represents an individual in the voting process.\nSpecifically, we construct an affective memory with an attention-based memory mechanism for each individual, to build connections between his/her past emotional experience and the present one.\nBesides, by posing dissimilarity constraints on affective memories, we propose a subjectivity loss to guarantee the diversity between different individuals, which further preserves the subjectivity in visual emotion distribution.\nSince the involved affective datasets lack individual-level annotations, there exist mismatches between individual predictions (i.e., ordered) and emotion labels (i.e., unordered).\nIn other words, given an affective image, each prediction is generated by a specific individual, while emotion labels lack individual-level annotations.\nTherefore, we further propose the Subjectivity Matching with a matching loss, aiming at assigning unordered labels to ordered predictions in a one-to-one correspondence.\nSpecifically, we regard the problem as a bipartite matching paradigm and implement the Hungarian algorithm to find the optimal solution. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We propose a novel framework, namely Subjectivity Appraise-and-Match Network (SAMNet), to seek subjectivity in visual emotion distribution learning, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on public visual emotion distribution datasets.\nTo the best of our knowledge, it is the initial step that predicts crowd emotions in an individual level. We construct the Subjectivity Appraising to simulate the w, where we propose affective memories to preserve individual emotional experiences and design a subjectivity loss to ensure the diversity between them. We propose the Subjectivity Matching with a matching loss, aiming for the optimal assignment between the ordered individual predictions and the unordered emotion labels by implementing the Hungarian algorithm. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II overviews the existing methods on visual emotion analysis, label distribution learning, and memory networks. In Section III, we introduce the proposed SAMNet by constructing Subjectivity Appraising and Subjectivity Matching. Extensive experiments, including comparisons, ablation study and visualization, are conducted on visual emotion distribution datasets given in Section IV. Finally, we conclude our work in Section V.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Emotion Analysis (VEA) has recently become an emerging and attractive research topic in the computer vision community.\nVEA may bring potential value to related tasks (e.g., memorability prediction [ref]1 , image aesthetic assessment  , and social relation inference [ref]5 ), and will have great influence on wide applications (e.g., opinion mining  , smart advertising  , and mental disease\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
