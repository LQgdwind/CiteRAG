      "content": "Paper Title: SHAQ: Incorporating Shapley Value Theory into Multi-Agent Q-Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCooperative games are a critical research area in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Many real-life tasks can be modeled as cooperative games, e.g. the coordination of autonomous vehicles , autonomous distributed logistics [ref]2 and distributed voltage control in power networks . In this paper, we consider global reward game (a.k.a. team reward game), an important subclass of cooperative games, wherein agents aim to jointly maximize cumulative global rewards over time. There are two categories of methods to solve this problem: (i) each agent identically maximizes cumulative global rewards, i.e. learning with a shared value function [ref]4 [ref]5 ; and (ii) each agent individually maximizes distributed values, i.e. learning with (implicit) credit assignments (e.g. marginal contribution and value factorisation)    0 1. By the view of non-cooperative game theory, global reward game are equivalent to Markov game 2 with global reward (a.k.a. team reward). Its aim is to learn a stationary joint policy to reach a Markov equilibrium so that no agent tends to unilaterally change its policy to maximize cumulative global rewards. Standing by this view, learning with value factorisation cannot be directly explained 3. In this paper, to clearly interpret the value factorisation, we take the perspective of cooperative game theory 4, wherein agents are partitioned into coalitions and a payoff distribution scheme is found to distribute optimal values to coalitions. The corresponding solution is called Markov core, whereby no agent has an incentive to deviate. When all agents are partitioned into one coalition (called grand coalition), the payoff distribution scheme naturally plays the role of value factorisation. Wang etÂ al. 3 extended convex game (i.e. a game model in cooperative game theory) 4 to dynamic scenarios, which we name as Markov convex game in this paper. We construct the analytic form of Shapley value for Markov convex game, and prove that it reaches the Markov core under the grand coalition, named as Markov Shapley value. The optimal Markov Shapley value implies not only the optimal global value but also that no agent has incentives to deviate from the grand coalition. Additionally, Markov Shapley value enjoys the following properties: (i) identifiability of dummy agents; (ii) efficiency; (iii) reflecting the contribution; and (iv) symmetry. These properties aid the interpretation and validity of value factorisation in the global reward game, and such transparency and reliability are critical to industrial applications . Based on the efficiency property, we derive Shapley-Bellman optimality equation that is an extension of Bellman optimality equation 5 6. Moreover, we propose Shapley-Bellman operator and prove its convergence to the Shapley-Bellman optimality equation and its optimal joint deterministic policy. With a stochastic approximation of Shapley-Bellman operator and some transformations, we derive an algorithm called Shapley Q-learning (SHAQ). SHAQ learns to approximate the optimal Markov Shapley Q-value (an equivalent form of the optimal Markov Shapley value). Moreover, we enable SHAQ decentralised in order to fit the decentralised execution framework and this decentralisation still remains the convergence condition of Shapley-Bellman operator. The proposed method, SHAQ, is evaluated on two global reward games such as Predator-Prey 7 and multi-agent StarCraft benchmark tasks 8. In the experiments, SHAQ shows not only generally good performances on solving all tasks but also the interpretability that is deficient in the state-of-the-art baselines.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: research area in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).
