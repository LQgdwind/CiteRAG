As FL is more likely to be deployed in mobile wireless networks which are usually heterogeneous environment in the future, some researches on designing the asynchronous FL systems have been investigated  [ref]31. In asynchronous FL, a node can download a global model from a central server and train a local model to upload in idle state at any time. In [ref]8, the authors propose an asynchronous decentralized algorithm based on stochastic gradient decent. In a heterogeneous environment, the proposed algorithm is robust to build deep learning model like VGG [ref]32 and ResNet-20 , and can achieve efficient communications with the best-possible convergence rate. Based on the work of [ref]8, the authors in  propose an asynchronous FL algorithm with an aim of weighting different local models of staleness to update global model. Meanwhile, considering both strongly and non-strongly convex problems, this work also proves that the asynchronous updating method can reach near-linear convergence.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: is more likely to be deployed in mobile wireless networks which are usually heterogeneous environment in the future, some researches on designing the asynchronous FL systems have been investigated  [ref]31.
