      "content": "Paper Title: Accelerating Sparse Tensor Decomposition Using Adaptive Linearized Representation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur mode-agnostic ALTO format was motivated by the linearized coordinate (LCO) format , which also flattens sparse tensors but in a mode-specific way, i.e., along a given mode orientation.\nHence, LCO requires either multiple tensor copies or permuting tensors for efficient computation.\nAdditionally, the authors limit their focus to sequential algorithms, and it is not clear how LCO can be used to efficiently parallelize sparse tensor computations. Researchers proposed variants   of the COO format to reduce the synchronization overhead across threads using mode-specific scheduling/permutation arrays. The state-of-the-art SparTen library  employs a COO variant  to accelerate the decomposition of non-negative count tensors across different hardware architectures. However, these COO variants adversely affect the input data locality and lead to random access of the nonzero elements , especially for sparse tensors with high fiber reuse.\nMoreover, keeping fine-grained scheduling information for all tensor modes can more than double the memory consumption, compared to the COO format . The popular SPLATT library [ref]20 leverages the CSF format [ref]20 [ref]25 to decompose sparse tensors on multi-core CPUs. However, this mode-specific compressed format requires multiple tensor copies for best performance. In addition, CSF packs the nonzero elements into coarse-grained tensor slices and fibers, which limits its scalability on massively parallel architectures.\nTo improve the performance on GPUs, recent CSF-based formats  [ref]30 expose more balanced and fine-grained parallelism but at the expense of substantial synchronization overheads and expensive preprocessing and format generation costs. Alternatively, the ParTI library uses the mode-agnostic, block-based HiCOO format  to decompose sparse tensors using only one tensor copy. However, HiCOO is highly sensitive to the characteristics of sparse tensors as well as the block size. Due to the irregular (skewed) data distributions in sparse tensors, the number of nonzero elements per block varies widely across HiCOO blocks, even after expensive mode-specific tensor permutations which in practice further increase workload imbalance .\nAs a result, when tensors are highly sparse, HiCOO can consume more storage than the COO format .\nMoreover, using small data types for indexing nonzero elements within a block can end up under-utilizing the compute units and memory bandwidth in modern parallel architectures  , which are optimized for wide memory transactions . SpTFS  utilizes machine learning   to predict the best of COO, HiCOO, and CSF formats to compute MTTKRP for a given sparse tensor. STeF  leverages the mode-specific CSF format to accelerate all-modes MTTKRP by memoization of partial MTTKRP results. Nevertheless, the additional space required for memoization can be more than double the memory storage of the sparse tensor and factor matrices, which limits STeF applicability to small- and medium-scale tensors . FLYCOO   extends the COO format to memory-constrained platforms (such as FPGAs) by processing a tensor into small equal-sized shards. However, FLYCOO requires dynamic mode-specific tensor remapping/reordering and it needs more storage than COO to keep sharding information for every mode.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: with high fiber reuse.\nMoreover, keeping fine-grained scheduling information for all tensor modes can more than double the memory consumption, compared to the COO format . The popular SPLATT library [ref]20 leverages the CSF format [ref]20 [ref]25 to decompose sparse tensors on multi-core CPUs. However, this mode-specific compressed format requires multiple tensor copies for best performance. In\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
