Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: An Improved Transfer Model: Randomized Transferable Machine\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we compare ‚Ñ≥~zsubscript~‚Ñ≥ùëß\\widetilde{\\mathcal{M}}_{z} with ‚Ñ≥zsubscript‚Ñ≥ùëß\\mathcal{M}_{z} using the new data learned by various state-of-the-art feature-based transfer methods.\nThe evaluation is done on 4 real-world datasets, namely Office-Caltech10 , COIL1-COIL2 [ref]21, 20-Newsgroups [ref]5 and Amazon product review dataset . Office-Caltech10 dataset  is a popular image classification benchmark dataset for transfer learning.\nIt consists of 4 domains: C (Caltech-256), A (Amazon), W (Webcam), and D (DSLR), where each domain contains images from a specific source.\nThese 4 domains share the same 10 objects, but have different data distributions.\nIn our experiment, we construct 12 transfer tasks, denoted as ‚Äòsource-target‚Äô.\nFor instance, C-A means that C is the source domain\nand A is the target domain.\nFollowing , We use SURF features. COIL1-COIL2 dataset [ref]21 is another image dataset for object recognition.\nTwo domains, COIL1 and COIL2, share 20 objects.\nEach of them has 720 images, and each image is 32√ó32323232\\times 32 pixels with 256 gray levels per pixel.\nThe images in two domains are taken in different directions, and thus are drawn from different distributions.\nCOIL1 contains images taken in the directions of [0‚àò,85‚àò]‚à™[180‚àò,265‚àò]superscript0superscript85superscript180superscript265[0^{\\circ},85^{\\circ}]\\cup[180^{\\circ},265^{\\circ}].\nCOIL2 contains images taken in the directions of [90‚àò,175‚àò]‚à™[270‚àò,355‚àò]superscript90superscript175superscript270superscript355[90^{\\circ},175^{\\circ}]\\cup[270^{\\circ},355^{\\circ}].\nWe construct two tasks: CL12 and CL21. 20-Newsgroups Dataset [ref]5 consists of about 20,000 documents from 4 top categories: computer (C), recording (R), science (S), and talk (T). Each top category has 4 subcategories.\nTop categories are treated as labels, while subcategories are treated as related domains.\nSix binary prediction tasks are formed: C-R, C-S, C-T, R-S, R-T, and S-T. We take the task C-R for instance.\nTop category C is the positive class and R is the negative class.\nTwo subcategories under each class are selected to constitute the source domain, while another two subcategories are selected to form the target domain.\nBy exchanging the roles of the two domains, we have two domain pairs for the prediction task C-R, denoted as CR-1 and CR-2. Amazon product review dataset  contains sentiment reviews from 4 product categories: books (B), DVD (D), electronics (E) and kitchen appliance (K). Each review is characterized by unigram and bigram tf-idf features and labeled as positive or negative. Each domain has about 2,000 samples. When a domain is selected as source/target, all the samples in this domain are used as training/test data. By pairing up the domains for adaptation task, we have 12 domain pairs, denoted as ‚Äòsource-target‚Äô.\nFor example, B-D means that category B is the source domain and D is the target domain.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: using the new data learned by various state-of-the-art feature-based transfer methods.\nThe evaluation is done on 4 real-world datasets, namely Office-Caltech10 , COIL1-COIL2 [ref]21, 20-Newsgroups [ref]5 and Amazon product review dataset .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
