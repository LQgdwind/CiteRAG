      "content": "Paper Title: An Optimizing Framework on MLIR for Efficient FPGA-based Accelerator Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare representative and latest frameworks to illustrate existing issues in Table I.\nExisting automatic tools like Pluto  have shown the power of polyhedral techniques    [ref]9 .\nHowever, none of them target FPGAs and deliver low performance if their schedule strategies are directly reused for FPGA accelerators.\nFPGA-related studies using polyhedral techniques     have limitations in either performance or generality. PolySA  and AutoSA  generate systolic arrays for dense matrices. However, the performance degrades on workloads of which the dependence distance is larger than one, such as the stencil computation Seidel [ref]27.\nZuo et al. use the polyhedral model to handle data-dependent modules with stencils in a small design space, limiting its upper bound of optimization .\nPOLSCA  introduces Pluto into MLIR and directs Pluto to generate codes that can be consumed by HLS tools. However, it demonstrates limited performance by adopting the Pluto schedule which is better suited for multi-core CPUs. Recent advances in scheduling languages for FPGA frameworks also demonstrate the potential to improve productivity. HeteroCL  and HeteroFlow [ref]34 extend TVM DSL and optimize code using Halide IR. Halide-HLS  and HeteroHalide  work as FPGA back-ends of Halide for efficient image processing.\nWe compare HeteroCL and HeteroHalide in Table I. They perform several hardware optimizations on a loop-level IR extended from Halide IR. However, they have limited capabilities of dependence analysis and loop transformations based on a single IR.\nAs discussed before, different schedule methods correspond to different optimization granularity and should be applied at appropriate abstraction levels. Adopting multi-level IRs provides a flexible and systemic way to simplify this implementation process and makes it easier to achieve better performance.\n ScaleHLS  proposes the first HLS framework for FPGAs on MLIR to optimize the input HLS C code. However, all the loop-level transformations are performed at MLIR dialects, and it is not convenient to add a new schedule method since the implementation requires modifying IR operations and passes. Therefore, some critical FPGA-oriented schedule strategies are not considered, leading to non-optimal performance. Also, designers cannot freely determine user-specified schedules, limiting the flexibility.\nIn contrast, POM introduces a new polyhedral IR into MLIR and hence enables advanced dependence analysis and a wide range of FPGA-oriented loop transformations. By representing nested loops as integer sets and maps at our polyhedral IR, loop transformations can be conducted conveniently through a series of manipulations on polyhedral semantics. Moreover, POM lowers IRs progressively by performing proper operations at suitable IR levels, provides a DSL for users to specify a customized schedule, and is applicable to multiple domains, such as image processing, linear algebra, stencils, and deep learning. A DSE engine is also provided to search for a proper schedule automatically.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: We compare representative and latest frameworks to illustrate existing issues in Table I.\nExisting automatic tools like Pluto  have shown the power of polyhedral techniques    [ref]9 .\nHowever, none of them target FPGAs and deliver low performance if their schedule strategies are directly reused for FPGA accelerators.\nFPGA-related studies using polyhedral techniques\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
