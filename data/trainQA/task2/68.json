      "content": "Paper Title: Diffusion bridges for stochastic Hamiltonian systems and shape evolutionsSubmitted to the editors DATE.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe have extended the framework of   for sampling diffusion bridges to nonlinear high dimensional stochastic Hamiltonian systems. For this work, problems in computational anatomy  revolving around systems of particles to describe images have been our main motivation. We used these models throughout to illustrate the application of diffusion bridges specifically in stochastic landmark dynamics.\nWe left open many possible improvements of this method such as allowing for multiple observations over time, resolving unknown landmark correspondence, a step towards infinite dimensional shape matching and the problem of the parametrisation of these shapes . This work opens the door to not not only a wider use in statistical inference in computational anatomy, but other related fields, where high dimensional stochastic Hamiltonian systems are involved in the modelling, such as in biology, data assimilation, swarming, etc.\nFrom a more theoretical point of view, various extensions of this work could be considered. The driving Brownian motion in the SDE could for example be generalised to a Lévy process or even rough paths. From a numerical perspective, we used classical methods for simplicity, but the presented algorithms could be extended to include more modern numerical integration schemes or MCMC methods, such as geometric integrators     , to preserves the geometrical structure of the problem, or some more advanced geometrical Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo methods  .\nIn addition, the use of automatic differentiation, similar as in [ref]25 , has turned out to be beneficial for the implementation of efficient methods, and surely deserves to be more exploited for future works.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: , to preserves the geometrical structure of the problem, or some more advanced geometrical Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo methods  .\nIn addition, the use of automatic differentiation, similar as in [ref]25 , has turned out to be beneficial for the implementation of efficient methods, and surely deserves to be more exploited for future works.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
