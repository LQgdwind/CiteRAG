      "content": "Paper Title: Depth Map Denoising Network and Lightweight Fusion Network for Enhanced 3D Face Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOwing to technological breakthroughs in deep learning\n[ref]1 \nand the significant advancement in 2D face recognition (FR) [ref]3  ,\n3D FR has drawn increasing attention in the computer vision community.\nEspecially in 2017, the release of iPhoneX marked the first year of the application of 3D FR\nin smartphone scenarios, which showcased the enormous potential among academic and industry communities. Unlike 2D face images, 3D face data provides additional information\nsuch as the geometric structure of the face, including depth, shape, and curvature.\nThis extra information not only allows for more accurate face recognition\nbut also facilitates reliable and robust face anti-spoofing by detecting impersonation attacks.\nMoreover, 3D faces have a certain degree of privacy preservation,\nwhich can effectively prevent biological information leakage from being used for the black industry chain.\nIn the last two decades, some 3D face databases have been proposed for academic research,\nsuch as FRGC v2 ,\nBosphorus , and BU3DFE [ref]8.\nHowever, most of them are collected by expensive and sophisticated 3D scanners,\nmaking them unaffordable for practical applications.\nRecently, consumer depth cameras such as Kinect and RealSense have become increasingly\npopular, allowing users to acquire 3D data at an affordable price.\nThis has significantly propelled the development of the 3D vision field   .\nNevertheless, depth images or point clouds collected by these devices are relatively rough and noisy,\npresenting a huge challenge for downstream tasks.\nAs a result, developing ways to obtain clean and smooth faces using low-quality depth face\ndata is crucial for 3D FR.\n In this paper, we view face denoising from the perspective of\nimplicit neural representation and propose a novel\nDepth Map Denoising Network (DMDNet) based on the Denoising Implicit Image Function (DIIF) to remove noises and improve the quality of facial depth images for low-quality 3D face recognition.\nOur DMDNet comprises an encoder and a decoding function, as illustrated in Figure 1.\nThe encoder represents noisy depth images as a set of latent codes\ndistributed in spatial dimensions, while the decoding function takes\nthe coordinate information and the latent code queried by the coordinate\nas input and predicts the denoised depth value at the given coordinate.\nSince face images are highly structured, our DMDNet utilizes the spatial and\nsemantic information implicit in the coordinate to provide a strong prior for denoising.\nCompared to traditional denoising networks based on an encoder-decoder approach,\nour DMDNet achieves better results.\nMoreover, we also leverage positional encoding to encode the coordinate information\nsuch that the denoising performance in high-frequency details can be improved,\nand simultaneously, we propose a Multi-Scale Decoding Fusion strategy\nwhich jointly utilize latent codes from different levels for decoding,\nachieving robustness to the change of spatial structure and improving the representation ability. To achieve better 3D FR performance using these denoised images,\nwe further design a novel and efficient recognition network,\ncalled Lightweight Depth and Normal Fusion network (LDNFNet),\nwhich takes advantage of multiple modalities (i.e. depth and normal images) for recognition.\nIn addition to learning specific features from every single modality,\nwe design a multi-branch fusion block to learn common features between\ndifferent modalities, in which the features from different modalities are fused\nin an efficient way. To summarize, the contributions of this paper are as follows: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that\nimplicit neural representation is introduced into 3D face denoising.\nThe utilization of coordinate information provides a strong prior for denoising.\nAdditionally, positional encoding and multi-scale decoding fusion strategies\nhelp to obtain better denoising performance. We propose a novel LDNFNet for 3D face recognition,\nin which the multi-branch fusion block achieves the modal fusion\nbetween depth and normal images.\nIt simultaneously learns specific and common features while reducing the extra computational overhead. Our proposed DMDNet outperforms existing methods on 3D face denoising tasks.\nWhen combining DMDNet and LDNFNet, we achieve state-of-the-art results\non Lock3DFace datasbase.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Owing to technological breakthroughs in deep learning\n[ref]1 \nand the significant advancement in 2D face recognition (FR) [ref]3  ,\n3D FR has drawn increasing attention in the computer vision community.\nEspecially in 2017, the release of iPhoneX marked\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
