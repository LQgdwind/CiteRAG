      "content": "Paper Title: Limited Associativity Makes Concurrent Software Caches a Breeze\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA cache management scheme‚Äôs design often involves certain (possibly implicit) assumptions on the characteristics of the ‚Äútypical‚Äù workload.\nFor example, the Least Recently Used (LRU) policy always admits new items to the cache and evicts the least recently used items¬†.\nLRU works well for recency biased workloads, where recently accessed items are most likely to be accessed again. Alternatively, the Least Frequently Used (LFU) policy, also called Perfect LFU, assumes that the access distribution is fixed over time, meaning that frequently accessed data items are more likely to be reaccessed.\nHence, Perfect LFU evicts the least frequently used item from the cache and admits a new one if it is more frequent than the cache victim.\nFor synthetic workloads with static access distributions, Perfect LFU is the optimal cache management policy¬†.\nReal workloads are dynamic, so practical LFU policies often apply aging mechanisms to the items‚Äô frequency.\nSuch mechanisms can be calculating frequency on sliding windows¬†, using exponential decay¬† , or periodic aging¬†. Operation complexity is another essential factor in cache design.\nBoth LRU and LFU need to maintain a priority queue or a heap, and can be implemented in constant time¬†[ref]29  . LRU and variants of LFU also maintain a hash table for fast access to items and their metadata.\nAnother limitation of priority queue based LRU implementations is the high contention on the head of queue due to the need to update it on each cache access (both hits and misses). The realization that a good cache management mechanism needs to combine recency and frequency led to the development of more sophisticated approaches¬†.\nLRU-K¬† maintains the last KùêæK occurrences of each item and orders all items based on the recency of their last KthsuperscriptùêæthK^{\\mathrm{th}} access.\nThe drawbacks are significant memory and computational overheads.\nAlso, most benefit comes when K=2ùêæ2K=2, with quickly diminishing returns for larger values of KùêæK. Low Inter-reference Recency Set (LIRS)¬† is a page replacement algorithm that attempts to directly predict the next occurrence of an item using a metric named reuse distance.\nTo realize this, LIRS maintains two cache regions and a large number of ghost entries.\nFRD¬† can be viewed as a practical variant of LIRS, which overcomes many of the implementation related limitations of¬†LIRS. Window-TinyLFU (W-TinyLFU)¬† also balances between recency and frequnecy using two cache regions, a window cache and the main cache.\nYet, it controls which items are admitted to the main cache using an optimized counting Bloom filter¬† based admission filter and thereby avoids the need to maintain ghost entries.\nThe relative size of the two caches is dynamically adjusted at runtime¬†[ref]16. As we mentioned before, what is common to ARC, CAR, LIRS, SLRU, 2Q, FRD and W-TinyLFU is that they all maintain two or more caches regions, each of which is maintained as a fully associative cache.\nWe promote implementing each such cache region as a limited associativity cache. Hyperbolic caching¬† logically maintains a dynamically evolving priority for each cached item, which is the number of times that item has been accessed divided by the duration of time since the item was inserted into the cache.\nTo make this practical and efficient, priorities are only computed during the eviction and only for a small sample of items.\nAmong the sampled items, the one whose priority is smallest becomes the victim.\nAs we discuss later, this policy can be trivially implemented using an associative design.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: decay¬† , or periodic aging¬†. Operation complexity is another essential factor in cache design.\nBoth LRU and LFU need to maintain a priority queue or a heap, and can be implemented in constant time¬†[ref]29  . LRU and variants of LFU also maintain a hash table for fast access to items and their metadata.\nAnother limitation of priority queue based LRU implementations is the high contention on the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
