      "content": "Paper Title: Hyperparameter Sensitivity in Deep Outlier Detection Analysis and a Scalable Hyper-Ensemble Solution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nClean versus Polluted Testbed Setup. \nFor sensitivity analysis, we construct our testbed on several datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR10, Thyroid and Cardio. For MNIST, we choose Digit ‘4’ and ‘5’ as the inlier-class, individually. For CIFAR10, we choose class ‘automobile’ as the inlier-class. The inlier-class is assigned the label 0, while we regard all classes other than the inlier-class as outliers and mark them with label 1 instead. Since MNIST and CIFAR10 are image data, we first apply the global contrast normalization to each individual image. We utilize the default train/test data-split (supported with Pytorch vision package). In the Clean setting, we select only the inlier-class data from train data-split as the training data. We measure and report the AUROC of the compared methods on the test data-split, with label 0 being the inlier-class and 1 being rest of the classes. In the Polluted setting, we utilize all the inlier-class data from the train data-split as the label 0, and we mix the data with 10%percent1010\\% outlier-classes’ data within the train data-split. The tabular data, Thyroid and Cardio, are downloaded from the ODDS repository (available at http://odds.cs.stonybrook.edu/. The data come in Polluted setting, with 2.5%percent2.52.5\\% and 9.6%percent9.69.6\\% outliers, respectively. The inliers are labeled 0 and outliers are denoted as label 1. For tabular data, we transform and scale each feature between zero and one. We also conduct experiment using GANomaly ’s data (MNIST digit ‘4’ as the outlier class, rest as inliers). The data split and configuration are the same as described in the authors’ provided code.
