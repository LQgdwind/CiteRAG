      "content": "Paper Title: Problems hard for treewidth but easy for stable gonality\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMinimum Maximum Outdegree, Undirected Flow with Lower Bounds and Capacitated Dominating Set are\nXNLP-complete for pathwidth, and XNLP-hard for treewidth (given a path or tree decomposition realising the path- or treewidth), but are FPT¬†for stable gonality (given a refinement and graph morphism from the associated multigraph to a tree realising the stable gonality). Unparameterized Undirected Flow with Lower Bounds has been known since 1977 to be NP-complete in the strong sense, cf.¬†Itai [26, Theorem 4.1], [22, p.¬†216]). Uncapacitated Dominating set is W‚Äãùëädelimited-[]2W-complete for the size of the dominating set [15, Theorem 13.28], and FPT¬†for treewidth [15, Theorem 7.7].\nThe W[ref]1delimited-[]1[ref]1-hardness of Minimum Maximum Outdegree for treewidth was proven by Szeider 9 and of Capacitated Dominating Set by Dom, Lokshtanov, Saurabh and Villanger . XNLP-completeness of Capacitated Dominating Set for pathwidth in the main theorem is not due to us, but was proven very recently by Bodlaender, Groenland and Jacob building upon our results, see [8, Theorem 8]. As far as we know, our proof is the first parameterized-hardness result for Undirected Flow with Lower Bounds.\nWe prove the XNLP-hardness for pathwidth (and hence, for treewidth) by reduction from Accepting Non-deterministic Checking Counter Machine from . see Section 6. For proving FPT¬†under stable gonality, we revive an older idea of Seese on tree-partite graphs and their widths 8; in contrast to the tree decompositions used in defining treewidth, we partition the original graph vertices into disjoint sets (‚Äòbags‚Äô) labelled by vertices of a tree, such that adjacent vertices are in the same bag or in bags labelled by adjacent vertices in the tree. Seese introduced tree partition width to be the maximal size of a bag in such any partition. We consider weighted graphs and define a new parameter, breadth, given as the maximum of the bag size and the sum of the weights of edges between adjacent bags; cf.¬†Subsection 2.2 below, in particular, Figure 2 for a schematic illustration. Taking the minimal breadth over all tree partitions gives a new graph parameter, that we call treebreadth. This allows us to divide the proof in two parts: (a) show that, given a graph morphism from the associated multigraph to a tree, one can compute in polynomial time a tree partition of the weighted graph of breadth upper bounded by the stable gonality of the associated multigraph ‚Äî see Theorem 2.9; (b) provide an FPT-algorithm, given a tree partition of bounded breadth. The very general intuition, to be made precise in the detailed proofs, is that the tree that we map the graph to (or that labels the bags in the tree partition) ‚Äústructures‚Äù the algorithm by consecutively running bounded algorithms over the pre-images of individual vertices and edges in the tree, using dynamical programming and integer linear programming to control extension of partial solutions to the entire graph. We mix this with classical tools for equivalence of various flow problems, and Edmonds‚Äô\nalgorithm for matching. By reductions, the two algorithms we specify are described in the following theorem for the indicated parameters. Minimum Maximum Outdegree is FPT¬†for treebreadth (given a partition tree realising the treebreadth), and Capacitated Dominating Set is FPT¬†for tree partition width (given a tree partition with bounded width). We underline that Seese‚Äôs original tree partition width suffices for the capacitated problem, by an argument described at the start of Subsection 5.2. The algorithm for Minimum Maximum Outdegree is given in Section 4 (in fact, for the closely related problem Outdegree Restricted Orientation, in which outdegree is required to belong to a given interval instead of not exceeding a given value), and the algorithm for Capacitated Dominating Set is given in Section 5. In a related direction, we may weaken the complexity class but increase the strength of the parameter. Here, we prove the following, by reduction from Bin Packing 7. Minimum Maximum Outdegree and Undirected Flow with Lower Bounds are W[ref]1delimited-[]1[ref]1-hard for vertex cover number.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: [26, Theorem 4.1], [22, p.¬†216]).
