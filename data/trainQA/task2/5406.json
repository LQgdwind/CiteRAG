To achieve such a promise, the smart grid must enable and support multiple innovative technologies, including a growing fleet of electric vehicles, a vast number of distributed renewable energy resources, and an increasing number of responsive loads. To support these innovative technologies, the power systems community must design and develop new state-of-the-art methods for operating, predicting, and controlling the smart grid . Over many decades, the power systems community has developed sophisticated numerical time-domain simulation schemes [ref]28 1 for predicting the power grid’s transient dynamic response. In particular, these schemes solve, with high-computational cost, the differential and algebraic equations (DAEs) describing the power grid after a disturbance event [ref]28. However, as the power grid becomes more innovative, power utilities have recognized the more significant need  to develop faster simulation tools to better understand and control the dynamics of the smart grid. For such tasks, which often require many complex forward simulations, the current state-of-the-art numerical time-domain simulation schemes may be prohibitively expensive.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: methods for operating, predicting, and controlling the smart grid .
