      "content": "Paper Title: MagicBrush : A Manually Annotated Dataset for Instruction-Guided Image Editing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEditing real images has long been an essential task in the field of image processing  and recent text-guided image editing has drawn considerable attention.\nSpecifically, it can be categorized into three types in terms of different forms of text. Global Description-guided Editing.\nPrevious methods build fine-grained word and image region alignment for image editing [ref]9  8.\nRecently, Prompt2Prompt 4 modifies words in the original prompts to perform both local editing and global editing by cross-attention control.\nWith the re-weighting technique, follow-up work Null Text Inversion  further removes the need of original caption for editing by optimizing the inverted diffusion trajectory of the input image.\nImagic  optimizes a text embedding that aligns with the input image, then interpolates it with the target description, thus generating correspondingly different images for editing.\nIn addition, Text2LIVE  trains a model to add an edit layer and combines the edit layer and input image to enable local editing.\nFor global description-guided editing, generally CLIP  can be applied to rank generated images w.r.t the alignment, thereby delivering higher-ranked results.\nHowever, the requirement for detailed descriptions of the target image poses an inconvenience for users. Local Description-guided Editing.\nAnother line of work utilizes masked regions and corresponding regional descriptions for local editing.\nBlended Diffusion  blends edited areas with the other parts of the image at different noise levels along the diffusion process.\nImagen Editor  trains diffusion editing models by inpainting the masked objects.\nLocal description-guided editing enables fine-grained control by using masks and preserves the other areas intact.\nHowever, this method places a greater burden on users, as they must provide additional masks.\nAlso, this approach may be complicated for certain editing types, such as object removal due to the difficulty of describing missing elements. Instruction-guided Editing.\nAnother form of text is instruction, which describes which aspect and how an image should be edited, such as “change the season to spring”.\nInstruction-guided editing, as initially proposed in various studies 1 3 , enables users to edit images without requiring elaborate descriptions or region masking.\nWith advancements in instruction following 9 and image synthesis 5, InstructPix2Pix  and SuTI  learn to edit images using instructions.\nTrained with synthetic texts by fine-tuned GPT-3 and images by Prompt2Prompt 4, InstructPix2Pix enables image editing by following instructions.\nLater work HIVE 1 introduces more training triplets and human ranking results to provide stronger supervision signals for better model training.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: it can be categorized into three types in terms of different forms of text. Global Description-guided Editing.\nPrevious methods build fine-grained word and image region alignment for image editing [ref]9  8.\nRecently, Prompt2Prompt 4 modifies words in the original prompts to perform both local editing and global editing by cross-attention control.\nWith the re-weighting technique, follow-up\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
