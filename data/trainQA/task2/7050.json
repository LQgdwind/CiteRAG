      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Pauli channel estimation with logarithmic quantum memory\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOne of the key challenges in demonstrating quantum advantage on near-term devices is that these devices are inherently noisy, from state preparation to gate application to measurement. To mitigate the effects of noise, it is essential to characterize it. In this paper, we study this question in the context of Pauli channels , which constitute a widely studied family of noise models and encompass a range of natural channels like dephasing, depolarizing, and bit flips. Importantly, essentially any physically relevant noise model can be reduced to Pauli noise via twirling, making Pauli channel estimation a crucial sub-routine in numerous protocols for quantum benchmarking      . The central role it plays in both theory and practice has led to a long line of work on the complexity of this task           . Recently, there has been a surge of interest in understanding this and related quantum learning problems in settings where the quantum algorithms one is allowed to run are limited by the constraints faced by contemporary quantum devices       [ref]15 [ref]6     . In such settings, a number of works have shown nontrivial separations between the statistical rates one can achieve with and without such constraints. For instance, a series of works    [ref]15 showed that for certain natural state learning tasks, n𝑛n qubits of quantum memory are sufficient to achieve exponential speedups in the amount of quantum data needed for these tasks. Interestingly, it was also shown in  that n𝑛n qubits of quantum memory are necessary for such speedups, in the sense that even with 0.99​n0.99𝑛0.99n qubits, the sample complexity for these tasks is exponential. Following in the wake of these results, we study Pauli channel estimation in the same setting where one has bounded quantum memory [ref]14   . As we will see, while prior work has established a qualitatively similar picture to what is known in the state learning setting, the results in the present work will demonstrate a crucial difference between the two settings. The starting point for our results is a recent paper by Chen et al. [ref]14 that proved a number of upper and lower bounds in this regime. They showed that any protocol for estimating the eigenvalues of a Pauli channel using only k𝑘k ancillary qubits of quantum memory must make at least Ω​(2(n−k)/3)Ωsuperscript2𝑛𝑘3\\Omega(2^{(n-k)/3}) measurements, provided the protocol is “non-concatenating.” Roughly speaking, this means that the algorithm is forced to perform a measurement immediately after every channel query (see Figure 3). They also proved a qualitatively matching upper bound by giving a simple non-concatenating protocol that only makes O​(2n−k)𝑂superscript2𝑛𝑘O(2^{n-k}) measurements, suggesting that with a moderate amount of quantum memory, i.e. (1−o​(1))​n1𝑜1𝑛(1-o(1))n qubits, significant speedups are possible. Conversely, with a limited amount of quantum memory, e.g. 0.990.990.99 qubits, it seems that exponentially many measurements are necessary, in close analogy to the aforementioned no-go results for state learning. Intuitively however, the non-concatenating setting seems unnecessarily restrictive. One might wonder whether more general “concatenating” protocols could perform much better by querying the channel multiple times, with quantum post-processing between each query, before making a measurement (see Section 3.1 for formal definitions for this model). When k=0𝑘0k=0, under this more general setting, Chen et al. [ref]14 showed that 2n/3superscript2𝑛32^{n/3} measurements are still necessary. Taken together, these two impossibility results imply that neither the ability to concatenate, nor the presence of a limited but nonzero amount of quantum memory (e.g. k≤0.99​n𝑘0.99𝑛k\\leq 0.99n qubits), is sufficient on its own to achieve sample-efficient Pauli channel estimation. Indeed, there are various reasons to suspect that even protocols with both features suffer from exponential scaling: Existing separations for learning with quantum memory. The only known separations (to our knowledge) between protocols with a small amount of quantum memory and protocols with zero quantum memory for any natural quantum learning task require enough qubits of memory to perform a Bell measurement or a swap test that is entangled with essentially all of the n𝑛n system qubits. Indeed, the upper bound in [ref]14 falls under this umbrella, as do the aforementioned recent works on state learning  , as well as results on quantum process learning  and purity testing  [ref]6. Unfortunately, separations of this flavor are necessarily bottlenecked at requiring k≥(1−o​(1))​n𝑘1𝑜1𝑛k\\geq(1-o(1))n qubits of quantum memory. Concatenation and noise accumulation. It is unclear whether being able to repeatedly query a Pauli channel before measurement buys us much. For example, if the channel has a spectral gap, then after a small number of repeated queries, the overall noise that the system experiences in the n𝑛n qubits on which the channel acts is close to completely depolarizing. This suggests that any efficient protocol for Pauli channel estimation should restrict to strategies that use limited or no concatenation. We therefore ask: Are exponentially many measurements necessary to estimate Pauli channels even using protocols that are concatenating and use at most k=0.99​n𝑘0.99𝑛k=0.99n qubits of quantum memory? The main result in our work is, surprisingly, an answer in the negative! In fact, we show that not only do concatenation and k=0.99​n𝑘0.99𝑛k=0.99n qubits of memory afford an exponential speedup, but there is even a concatenating protocol that achieves poly⁡(n)poly𝑛\\operatorname{poly}(n) measurement complexity with just logarithmically many qubits of memory: Given an arbitrary Pauli channel and error parameter ε𝜀\\varepsilon, there exists a k=O​(log⁡n/ε2)𝑘𝑂𝑛superscript𝜀2k=O(\\log n/\\varepsilon^{2})-ancilla, non-adaptive, concatenating protocol that makes O~​(n2/ε2)~𝑂superscript𝑛2superscript𝜀2\\tilde{O}(n^{2}/\\varepsilon^{2}) measurements111Here, O~~𝑂\\tilde{O} hides extra terms depending polylogarithmically on n𝑛n and learns all the eigenvalues of a given Pauli channel to within error ε𝜀\\varepsilon with high probability. Our protocol provides intuitive counterpoints to (A) and (B) above. As we explain in Section 2, the algorithm circumvents (A) by utilizing the O​(log⁡n/ε2)𝑂𝑛superscript𝜀2O(\\log n/\\varepsilon^{2}) qubits of quantum memory not to perform any kind of swap or Bell measurement on a subsystem, but instead to perform a certain purification procedure that amplifies the difference between how the system behaves under the unknown noise channel versus under a fixed hypothesis channel. As for (B), the algorithm crucially exploits the small but nonzero amount of quantum memory in order to “pump out entropy.” The point is that while noise might accumulate in the n𝑛n system qubits from consecutive queries to the channel, the ancillary qubits do not experience noise and can thus be used to safely record information that is learned over the course of the protocol. An important caveat of our result is that although the protocol makes poly⁡(n)poly𝑛\\operatorname{poly}(n) measurements, each measurement is performed after a sequence of exponentially many queries to the unknown channel. Naturally, one might wonder whether there exist better protocols which are efficient not just in terms of measurement complexity, but also in terms of query complexity. Unfortunately, we prove that for Pauli channel estimation, this is not possible: Any (possibly adaptive and possibly concatenating) protocol for estimating the eigenvalues of an unknown Pauli channel to within constant error requires Ω​(2(n−k)/3)Ωsuperscript2𝑛𝑘3\\Omega(2^{(n-k)/3}) queries. We remark that this is a strict improvement upon the aforementioned Ω​(2(n−k)/3)Ωsuperscript2𝑛𝑘3\\Omega(2^{(n-k)/3}) lower bound from [ref]14, as their lower bound applied only to non-concatenating protocols, for which there is no distinction between query complexity and measurement complexity. As a bonus, we also tighten the 2n/3superscript2𝑛32^{n/3} lower bound of [ref]14 for concatenating protocols with k=0𝑘0k=0 ancillas to get an optimal lower bound that works for any ε𝜀\\varepsilon: For any 0≤ε<10𝜀10\\leq\\varepsilon<1, any (possibly adaptive and possibly concatenating) protocol for estimating the eigenvalues of an unknown Pauli channel to within error ε𝜀\\varepsilon using k=0𝑘0k=0 ancillas requires Ω​(2n/ε2)Ωsuperscript2𝑛superscript𝜀2\\Omega(2^{n}/\\varepsilon^{2}) queries.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: in understanding this and related quantum learning problems in settings where the quantum algorithms one is allowed to run are limited by the constraints faced by contemporary quantum devices       [ref]15 [ref]6     .
