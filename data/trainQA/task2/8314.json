      "content": "Paper Title: The Equivalence Problem of E-Pattern Languages with Length Constraints is Undecidable\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA pattern is a finite word consisting only of symbols from a finite set of letters Σ={𝚊1,…,𝚊σ}Σsubscript𝚊1…subscript𝚊𝜎\\Sigma=\\{\\mathtt{a}_{1},...,\\mathtt{a}_{\\sigma}\\}, also called terminals, and from an infinite set of variables X={x1,x2,…}𝑋subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2…X=\\{x_{1},x_{2},...\\} such that we have Σ∩X=∅Σ𝑋\\Sigma\\cap X=\\emptyset. It is a natural and compact device to define formal languages. From patterns, we obtain words consisting only of terminals using a substitution hℎh, a terminal preserving morphism that maps all variables in a pattern to words over the terminal alphabet. The language of a pattern is the set of all words obtainable from that pattern using arbitrary substitutions. We differentiate between two kinds of substitutions. In the original definition of patterns and pattern languages introduced by Angluin , only words obtained by non-erasing substitutions are considered. Here, all variables are required to be mapped to non-empty words. The resulting languages are called non-erasing (NE) pattern languages. Later, so called erasing-/extended- or just E-pattern languages have been introduced by Shinohara . Here, variables may also be substituted by the empty word ε𝜀\\varepsilon. Consider, for example, the pattern α:=x1​𝚊​x2​𝚋​x1assign𝛼subscript𝑥1𝚊subscript𝑥2𝚋subscript𝑥1\\alpha:=x_{1}\\mathtt{a}x_{2}\\mathtt{b}x_{1}. Then, if we map x1subscript𝑥1x_{1} to 𝚊𝚋𝚊𝚋\\mathtt{a}\\mathtt{b} and x2subscript𝑥2x_{2} to 𝚋𝚋𝚊𝚊𝚋𝚋𝚊𝚊\\mathtt{b}\\mathtt{b}\\mathtt{a}\\mathtt{a} using a substitution hℎh, we obtain the word h​(α)=𝚊𝚋𝚊𝚋𝚋𝚊𝚊𝚋𝚊𝚋ℎ𝛼𝚊𝚋𝚊𝚋𝚋𝚊𝚊𝚋𝚊𝚋h(\\alpha)=\\mathtt{a}\\mathtt{b}\\mathtt{a}\\mathtt{b}\\mathtt{b}\\mathtt{a}\\mathtt{a}\\mathtt{b}\\mathtt{a}\\mathtt{b}. Considering the E-pattern language of α𝛼\\alpha, we could also map x1subscript𝑥1x_{1} to the empty word and obtain any word in the language {𝚊}⋅Σ∗⋅{𝚋}⋅𝚊superscriptΣ𝚋\\{\\mathtt{a}\\}\\cdot\\Sigma^{*}\\cdot\\{\\mathtt{b}\\}. Due to its practical and simple definition, patterns and their corresponding languages occur in numerous areas in computer science and discrete mathematics. These include, for example, unavoidable patterns 4 8, algorithmic learning theory   , word equations 8, theory of extended regular expressions with back references [ref]9, or database theory  . There are three main decision problems regarding patterns and pattern languages. Those are the membership problem (and its variations 0 1 [ref]6), the inclusion problem, and the equivalence problem. All are considered in the erasing (E) and non-erasing (NE). The membership problem determines if a word belongs to the language of a pattern. This problem has been shown to be NP-complete for both, erasing- and non-erasing, pattern languages  4. The inclusion problem determines whether the language of one pattern is a subset of the language of another pattern. It has been shown to be generally undecidable by Jiang et al. in 5. Freydenberger and Reidenbach  as well as Bremer and Freydenberger  improved that result and showed that it is undecidable for all bounded alphabets of size |Σ|≥2Σ2|\\Sigma|\\geq 2 for both erasing and non-erasing pattern languages. The equivalence problem asks whether the languages of two patterns are equal. For NE-pattern languages, this problem is trivially decidable and characterized by the equality of patterns up to a renaming of their variables . The decidability of the erasing case is one of the major open problems in the field 5 3 2 1 4. For terminal-free patterns, however, i.e., patterns without any terminal letters, the inclusion problem as well as the equivalence problem for E-pattern languages have been characterized and shown to be NP-complete 5 . What remains unresolved, though, is the decidability of the inclusion problem of terminal-free NE-pattern languages. Over time, various extensions to patterns and pattern languages have been introduced, either, to obtain additional expressibility due to some practical context or to get closer to an answer for the remaining open problems. Some examples are the bounded scope coincidence degree, patterns with bounded treewidth, k𝑘k-local patterns, or strongly-nested patterns (see  and references therein). Koshiba 6 introduced so called typed patterns that restrict substitutions of variables to types, i.e., arbitrary recursive languages. Geilke and Zilles 2 extended this recently to the notion of relational patterns and relational pattern languages. In 0, a special form of typed patterns has been considered, i.e., patterns with regular constraints. Here, variables may be restricted by arbitrary regular languages and the same variable may occur more than once. It has been shown that this notion suffices to obtain undecidability for both main open problems regarding pattern languages, i.e., the equivalence of E-pattern languages and the inclusion of terminal-free NE-pattern languages. Another natural extension other than regular constraints is the notion of length constraints. Here, instead of restricting the choice of words for the substitution of variables, length constraints just restrict the lengths of substitution of variables in relation to each other. In the field of word equations, length constraints have been considered as a natural extension for a long time and, e.g., answering the decidability of the question whether word equations with length constraints have a solution, is a long outstanding problem (see, e.g., 7 and the references therein). In this paper, we consider that natural extension on patterns, resulting in the class of patterns called patterns with length constraints. In general, we say that a length constraint ℓℓ\\ell is a disjunction of systems of linear (diophantine) inequalities over the variables of X𝑋X. We denote the set of all length constraints by 𝒞L​e​nsubscript𝒞𝐿𝑒𝑛\\mathcal{C}_{Len}. A pattern with length constraints (α,ℓα)∈(Σ∪X)∗×𝒞L​e​n𝛼subscriptℓ𝛼superscriptΣ𝑋subscript𝒞𝐿𝑒𝑛(\\alpha,\\ell_{\\alpha})\\in(\\Sigma\\cup X)^{*}\\times\\mathcal{C}_{Len} is a pattern associated with a length constraint. We say that a substitution hℎh is ℓαsubscriptℓ𝛼\\ell_{\\alpha}-valid if all variables are substituted according to ℓαsubscriptℓ𝛼\\ell_{\\alpha}. Now, the language of (α,ℓα)𝛼subscriptℓ𝛼(\\alpha,\\ell_{\\alpha}) is defined analogously to pattern languages but restricted to ℓαsubscriptℓ𝛼\\ell_{\\alpha}-valid substitutions in the erasing- and non-erasing cases. We examine erasing (E) and non-erasing (NE) pattern languages with length constraints. It can be shown that the membership problem for both cases in NP-complete. The inclusion problem is shown to be undecidable in both cases, too, notably even for terminal-free patterns, which is a difference to the decidability of the inclusion problem in the erasing case for patterns without any constraints, and which is an answer to a problem which is still open for non-erasing patterns without constraints. The main result of this paper is the undecidability of the equivalence problem for erasing pattern languages with length constraints in both cases, terminal-free and general, giving an answer to a problem of which the decidability has been an open problem for a long time in the case of no constraints. The final result shows that regular constraints and length constraints combined suffice to show undecidability of the equivalence problem for non-erasing pattern languages, a problem that is trivially decidable in case of no constraints and still open in the cases of just regular- or just length-constraints.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: science and discrete mathematics.
