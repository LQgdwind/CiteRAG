      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Multi-agent Epistemic Planning: Teaching Planners About Nested Belief\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAI applications increasingly involve the interaction of multiple agents – be they intelligent user interfaces that interact with human users, gaming systems, or multiple autonomous robots interacting together in a factory setting. In the absence of prescribed coordination, it is often necessary for individual agents to synthesize their own plans, taking into account not only their own capabilities and beliefs about the world but also their beliefs about other agents, including what each of the agents will come to believe as the consequence of the actions of others.\nTo illustrate, consider the scenario where Larry and Moe meet on a regular basis at the local diner to swap the latest gossip. Larry has come to know that Nancy (Larry’s daughter) has just received a major promotion in her job, but unbeknownst to him, Moe has already learned this bit of information through the grapevine. Before they speak, both believe Nancy is getting a promotion, Larry believes Moe is unaware of this (and consequently wishes to share the news), and Moe assumes Larry must already be aware of the promotion but is unaware of Moe’s own knowledge of the situation. Very quickly we can see how the nesting of (potentially incorrect) belief can be a complicated and interesting setting to model. In this paper, we examine the problem of synthesizing plans in such settings. In particular, given a finite set of agents, each with: (1) (possibly incomplete and incorrect) beliefs about the world and about the beliefs of other agents; and (2) differing capabilities including the ability to perform actions whose outcomes are unknown to other agents; we are interested in synthesizing a plan to achieve a goal condition. Planning is at the belief level and as such, while we consider the execution of actions that can change the state of the world (ontic actions) as well as an agent’s state of knowledge or belief (epistemic or more accurately doxastic actions, including communication actions), all outcomes are with respect to belief. Further, those beliefs respect the KDn and KD45n axioms of epistemic logic . Finally, we take a perspectival view, planning from the viewpoint of a single agent. While the planning agent presumes control of all the other agents actions (i.e., we do not model the possibility of other agents acting in an uncertain and unobserved manner), there is not presumption of complete knowledge over the nested belief of other agents. We contrast this with traditional multi-agent planning which generates a coordinated plan to be executed by multiple agents under an assumption of complete knowledge of the reasoner (e.g., ). Solutions to the epistemic planning problem can be roughly divided into two classes: (1) the approach taken in Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL) of using Kripke structures to maintain knowledge and then using models, such as event models, to update Kripke structures as events occur, for example, ; or (2) to maintain a set of formulae in a database and using belief update and revision to progress the database, for example, . In this paper, we adopt the latter approach. We define epistemic planning for a particular class of problems in which the knowledge base is a proper epistemic knowledge base (PEKB) . A PEKB is defined as finite set of epistemic literals, meaning that: (1) they do not allow for disjunctive belief; and (2) the depth of nested belief is bounded. We show that this provides certain theoretical guarantees on the computational complexity of progression of actions that have PEKBs as preconditions and effects, and directly offers an efficient means of planning using known methodologies. We propose a means of encoding our definition of epistemic planning as a classical planning problem, enabling us to exploit state-of-the-art classical planning techniques to synthesize plans for these challenging planning problems. A key aspect of our encoding is the use of ancillary conditional effects – additional conditional effects of actions which enforce desirable properties such as epistemic modal logic axioms (cf. Section 4), and allow domain modellers to encode conditions under which agents are mutually aware of actions (cf. Section 5.1). By encoding modal logic axioms as effects of actions, we are using the planner to perform epistemic reasoning in addition to the standard reasoning about action and change. We implement this encoding as a compilation from epistemic planning problems to classical planning problems, and show that it handles a rich variety of problems. Computational machinery for epistemic reasoning has historically appealed to theorem proving or model checking (e.g., [ref]21), while epistemic planning, originally popularized within the DEL community, has shifted from a sole focus on theoretical concerns (e.g., ) to a growing array of practical approaches and implementations. Previously, the problem of planning with epistemic goals has received limited attention in the automated planning community (e.g.,   and most recently with multi-agent beliefs  ). The work presented here is an important step towards leveraging state-of-the-art planning technology as a black-box sub-procedure to address rich epistemic planning problems of the sort examined by the DEL community. Indeed, we can readily solve existing examples in the DEL literature (cf. Section 7). We further discuss the relationship of our work to other modern epistemic planning work in Section 8. Parts of this paper have been published in earlier work, notably the theory of proper epistemic knowledge bases   2 and parts of the encoding to classical planning 3. However, the work in this paper extends that body of work in three key areas: (1) we provide a formal definition of epistemic planning over PEKBs, with earlier work 3 informally defining the problem; (2) we extend the encoding to deal with a restricted class of common knowledge, called always known, which are propositions for which every agent will always know the value, such as static knowledge; and (3) we significantly expand the evaluation, defining new benchmark problems and presenting applications on which we have used our planner. After presenting the background notation required in Section 2, we detail the syntax and semantics of the Restricted Perspectival Multi-agent Epistemic Planning model in Section 3. We follow with the detailed encoding to classical planning in Section 4. Extensions to greatly reduce the burden of modelling and improve planner efficiency are presented in Section 5 with grounded examples in Section 6. We investigate the empirical nature of our approach in Section 7 and provide a discussion of related work and concluding remarks in Sections 8-9. For reader convenience, A provides a list of the common acronyms used throughout the paper. To illustrate the PDKB Description Language, a variant of PDDL , B details the Grapevine and Envelope domains. In C we demonstrate the encoding of ancillary conditional effects. Finally, for completeness, D outlines the theory of PEKBs in the context of related work, emphasising the nice logical and computational properties that make them a suitable representation for extending classical planning over belief bases, in a KDn/KD45n context. We will use a common example to explain the concepts introduced throughout the paper. Consider a scenario where a group of agents each have their own secret to (possibly) share with one another. Each agent can move freely between a pair of rooms, and broadcast any secret they currently believe to everyone in the room. Initially they only believe their own unique secret. Goals we might pose include the universal spread of information (everyone believes every secret), misconception (an agent holds a false belief about someone else’s belief), etc. We will use 1,2,⋯12⋯1,2,\\cdots to represent the agents, and s1,s2,⋯subscript𝑠1subscript𝑠2⋯s_{1},s_{2},\\cdots to represent their secrets, respectively. Given our perspectival view of the setting, these may be cast either in terms of one of the acting agents in the environment, or as a third-party observer that has partial information about the world.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: planning problems, and show that it handles a rich variety of problems.
