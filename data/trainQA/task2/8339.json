      "content": "Paper Title: NeuroNURBS: Learning Efficient Surface Representations for 3D Solids\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBoundary Representation (B-Rep)   is commonly used to represent shapes and solids in computer-aided design (CAD) - widely applied in industrial design, simulation, and manufacturing. In a B-Rep, the solid boundaries are defined using a set of surfaces  , which are, by default, parameterized by Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) 6. Deep learning could offer solutions to several computational tasks important to the industry, e.g., B-Rep generation and solid segmentation. Aiming to solve these tasks, various works have been devoted to learning the geometry and topology of B-Rep data [ref]21   3 7. A major work, BrepGen 7, decomposes the B-Rep entities (faces, edges, vertices) into a tree data structure that encodes the topological information. Despite the success of learning the topology of B-Rep, we find that these works 7 [ref]21  utilize a parametric approximation to surfaces, that is representing the surface with a certain number of 3D points uniformly distributed in the UV-domain, i.e., a UV-grid [ref]21. More details about UV-grids are introduced in Sec. 3.1. However, this approach has several drawbacks: (1) the approximation to the target surface is often imprecise unless a dense UV-grid is used to achieve an acceptable error range [ref]21  . (2) The demand for high accuracy often incurs large data sizes, model sizes, and computational costs, which is sometimes unnecessary. For example, planar surfaces are represented by 32×\\times32 3D points in 7. (3) Generative models that use UV-grid-based surface approximation, e.g., BrepGen, can produce artificial undulating patterns on the surface. For instance, we showcase several solids generated by BrepGen in Fig. 1 (a), where some sections of the curvy surface are not perfectly smooth. Alternatively, it is more natural and advantageous to use the NURBS parametrization in the solids learning task: NURBS are more accurate 6  , easier to manipulate  , and have less parameters 6  compared to UV-grids. However, incorporating the parameters of a NURBS surface in deep neural networks is not trivial: (1) The parameters — control points, knot vectors, and weight matrix (see explanation in Sec. 3.1) — have varying sizes across surfaces in a B-Rep data set. It is challenging to unify them into a fixed-size input to a deep neural network. (2) These parameters are related (e.g., control points are only meaningful together with knot vectors and and the dimension of the weight matrix depends on the number of control points), and hence, they should be encoded and decoded jointly if we wish to learn a shared latent representation thereof. We target learning an effective representation of NURBS parameters, for which we propose the NeuroNURBS pipeline111Code can be found under: https://github.com/jiajie96/NeuroNURBS-python.git consisting of preprocessing and autoencoding. We utilize the transformer architecture   for the autoencoder to handle the heterogeneous sizes of NURBS parameters. We refer to the resulting latent representation as NURBS features. More precisely, NeuroNURBS is our proposed pipeline to convert NURBS parameters into NURBS features that can be used in downstream tasks, e.g., solid segmentation and generation. In Fig. 1 (b), we illustrate some examples of surfaces generated with NURBS-Gen, which is obtained by replacing the preprocessing and autoencoder of surface entities with NeuroNURBS in the BrepGen 7 framework. As seen from the figure, the surfaces generated with NeuroNURBS and NURBS features are very smooth and regular. To evaluate NeuroNURBS, we conduct the following experiments: We compare its performance with the UV-grid method for reconstructing surfaces on DeepCAD data 4 in terms of accuracy, memory efficiency, and computation cost (Sec. 4.2). We see the memory required to store features of solids is reduced by 79.9%, the surface autoencoder’s size is reduced by 92.9%, the GPU consumption for training the surface autoencoder is reduced by 86.7%. We test the NeuroNURBS on two downstream tasks: B-Rep generation on DeepCAD 4 (Sec. 4.3) and solid segmentation on MFCAD  (Sec. 4.4). For the former, our NURBS-Gen improves the FID (Fréchet Inception Distance ) from 30.04 (achieved by BrepGen) to 27.24. For the latter, we utilize a Graph Attention Network (GAT) 0, resulting in a new model called NURBS-GAT. It achieves an accuracy of 99.65%.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: tasks important to the industry, e.g., B-Rep generation and solid segmentation.
