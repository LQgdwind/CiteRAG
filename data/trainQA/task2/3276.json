      "content": "Paper Title: Modeling Human Driver Interactions Using an Infinite Policy Space Through Gaussian Processes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOne of the promises of the autonomous vehicle (AV) technology is to decrease the crash rates related to human faults, which will lead to a safer transportation. It is argued that AVs will help not only in preventing accidents but also in solving traffic congestions and in reducing emissions . Despite these promises, however, the emergence of AVs in regular commercial use is still pending mainly because of safety issues. Indeed, safety is the very first challenge for robotic systems where humans are in the loop . Therefore, their safety must be validated before AVs become a usual sight at everyday traffic. There is a high probability that AVs will have their own roads/lanes that are dedicated to their use only . However, in a scenario where human drivers and AVs coexist in the same environment, the safety problem becomes a tough challenge due to the very nature of hard-to-predict human behavior. In , it is stated that to prove AVs‚Äô safety, hundreds of millions of miles are needed to be driven without fatality, which correspond to years of observation. This particular result makes it difficult to validate AV technology in real roads. Also, observing AVs in different test cases that can occur in real life is non-trivial. On the other hand, using computer simulations for testing both decreases the required time and effort significantly and help create complex environments for observing AVs‚Äô reactions. Therefore, creating reliable simulation environments that can mimic the real world has utmost importance for the validation of AV control algorithms. To achieve this, modeling human driver interactions as accurate as possible is necessary. Joint employment of reinforcement learning and game theory is demonstrated to be an effective tool for modeling human interactions. Examples for the utilization of this method to predict human-human and human-automation interactions can be found in , [ref]6, [ref]7 and [ref]8 for aviation, and in , 0, 1, 2 and 3 for automotive applications. The main game theoretical approach used in these studies are called the \"level-kùëòk reasoning\" 4, 5, 6, 7. This method is based on the idea that humans have different levels of decision making algorithms, where level-kùëòk is a best response to level-(kùëòk-1). Although level-kùëòk reasoning is shown to have a reasonable match with real human driving behavior 8, it suffers from the limited number of driver policies. In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem by introducing an infinite policy space for human interactions. Our solution uses the limited policies suggested by the conventional level-kùëòk approach as inputs to a multi-output Gaussian Process (GP) to obtain real-valued driver levels. Furthermore, we introduce and prove a \"best response\" theorem which precisely defines the hierarchy between real-valued reasoning levels. Therefore, the proposed solution can be considered as a level-kùëòk refinement. We also validate our results using a real traffic dataset. A preliminary version of this work is submitted to 2022 American Control Conference. This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, related studies in the literature on human driver modeling through different approaches and on level-kùëòk game theoretical reasoning concept are given. In Section 3, we briefly summarize the minimum background knowledge about single-output and multi-output GPs along with the fundamental premises of level-kùëòk framework. The method developed in this paper to transfer the problem from integer-valued levels to real-valued levels is described in Section 4. Furthermore, a best response theorem for the interaction of agents with real-valued levels is introduced in Section 4. In Section 5, we present the construction of gaussian processes for the task and how we validate our approach on real traffic data. The results that demonstrate contributions of the presented approach are shared in Section 6 along with a discussion. Finally, an overall summary is provided in Section 7.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: theory is demonstrated to be an effective tool for modeling human interactions.
