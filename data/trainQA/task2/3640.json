      "content": "Paper Title: Fine-Grained Scene Graph Generation with Data Transfer\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nScene graph generation (SGG) aims to detect relational triplets (e.g., (man, riding, bike)) in images.\nAs an essential task for connecting vision and language, it can serve as a fundamental tool for high-level vision and language tasks, such as visual question answering [ref]2 [ref]25 [ref]29 , image captioning  , and image retrieval   . However, existing SGG methods can only make correct predictions on a limited number of predicate classes (e.g., 29 out of 50 pre-defined classes ), among which a majority of predicates are trivial and uninformative (e.g., on, and, near).\nThis undermines the application of SGG for downstream tasks.\nTo address the limitation, we first identify two main problems that need to deal with: Long-tail problem: the problem refers to the phenomenon that annotations mainly concentrate on a few head predicate classes, and are much sparse in most tail predicate classes. For example, in Visual Genome, there are over 100K samples for the top 5 predicate classes, while over 90% of predicate classes have less than 10 samples. As a result, the performance of tail predicate classes is poor due to the lack of effective supervision. Semantic ambiguity: many samples can be described as either general predicate class (e.g., on) or an informative one (e.g., riding). However, data annotators prefer some general (and thus uninformative) predicate classes to informative ones for simplicity. This causes conflicts in the widely adopted single-label optimization since different labels are annotated for the same type of instances. Thus, even when the informative predicates have enough training samples, the prediction will easily collapse to the general ones. To address the problems mentioned above, recent works propose to use resampling  , reweighting , and post-processing methods  . However, we argue that these problems can be better alleviated by enhancing the existing dataset into a reasonable dataset, that contains more abundant training samples for tail classes and also provides coherent annotations for different classes. To this end, we propose a novel framework named Internal and External data Transfer (IETrans), which can be equipped to different baseline models in a plug-and-play applied in a fashion.\nAs shown in Figure 1, we automatically transfer data from general predicates to informative ones (Internal Transfer) and relabel relational triplets missed by annotators (External Transfer).\n(1) For internal transfer, we first identify the general-informative relational pairs based on the confusion matrix, and then conduct a triplet-level data transfer from general ones to informative ones.\nThe internal transfer will not only alleviate the optimization conflict caused by semantic ambiguity but also provide more data for tail classes;\n(2) For external transfer, there exist many positive samples missed by annotators  , which are usually treated as negative samples by current methods.\nHowever, this kind of data can be considered as a potential data source, covering a wide range of predicate categories.\nInspired by Visual Distant Supervision  which employs NA samples for pre-training, we also consider the NA samples, which are the union of negative and missed annotated samples.\nThe missed annotated samples can be relabeled to provide more training samples. It is worth noting that both internal transfer and external transfer are indispensable for improving SGG performance.\nWithout the internal transfer, the external transfer will suffer from the semantic ambiguity problem.\nMeanwhile, the external transfer can further provide training samples for tail classes, especially for those that have weak semantic connection with head classes. Exhaustive experiments show that our method is both adaptive to different baseline models and expansible to large-scale SGG.\nWe equip our data augmentation method with 4 different baseline models and find that it can significantly boost all models’ macro performance and achieve SOTA performance for F@K metric, a metric for overall evaluation.\nFor example, a Neural Motif Model with our proposed method can double the mR@100 performance and achieve the highest F@100 among all model-agnostic methods on predicate classification task of the widely adopted VG-50  benchmark. To validate the scalability of our proposed method, we additionally propose a new benchmark with 1,807 predicate classes (VG-1800), which is more practical and challenging.\nTo provide a reliable and stable evaluation, we manually remove unreasonable predicate classes and make sure there are over 5 samples for each predicate class on the test set.\nOn VG-1800, our method achieves SOTA performance with significant superiority compared with all baselines.\nThe proposed IETrans can make correct predictions on 467 categories, compared with all other baselines that can only correctly predict less than 70 categories.\nWhile the baseline model can only predict relations like (cloud, in, sky) and (window, on, building), our method enables to generate informative ones like (cloud, floating through, sky) and (window, on exterior of, building). Our main contributions are summarized as follows: (1) To cope with the long-tail problem and semantic ambiguity in SGG, we propose a novel IETrans framework to generate an enhanced training set, which can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion.\n(2) We propose a new VG-1800 benchmark, which can provide reliable and stable evaluation for large-scale SGG.\n(3) Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our IETrans in training SGG models.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: riding, bike)) in images.\nAs an essential task for connecting vision and language, it can serve as a fundamental tool for high-level vision and language tasks, such as visual question answering [ref]2 [ref]25 [ref]29 , image captioning  , and image retrieval   .
