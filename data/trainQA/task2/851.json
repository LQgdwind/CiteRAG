The main idea behind this assumption is that an infinite memory machine, RNNs falling in this case, trained to recognize a regular language tends to cluster the hidden state space into well-formed partitions that map to the canonical minimal DFA of the target regular language. Backed by this assumption, many algorithms aiming at extracting finite state machines from Recurrent Neural Networks were based on the use of some clustering/quantization technique of the RNN hidden state space to recover a finite structure. From a conceptual viewpoint, these algorithms can be seen as a special instanciation of the following meta-algorithmic pattern: The clustering phase: In this phase, hidden vectors of strings generated according to a chosen sampling strategy (Breadth-first search/Random sampling) are collected. Then, a clustering/partionning technique is employed to obtain the states of the extracted DFA, The transition construction phase: During this step, transition tables of each symbol in the alphabet are constructed to form transitions and corresponding labels of the DFA. To perform this task, the algorithm needs to traverse the RNN up to a given depth to fill in transition tables. Uusually, a non-determinism conflict occurs during this phase, where a symbol leads to two different states when starting from the same state. A common way to resolve this conflict consists at choosing the most frequent transition to form arcs between states. Automaton minimization: The resulting automaton of the previous step might be non-minimal, i.e. contains indistinguishable states. This step compresses this latter into its minimal equivalent version. This task is known to be performed in polynomial time. Algorithms following this meta-algorithmic pattern differ mainly on the instanciation of two hyperparameters : The clustering/quantization technique used to form the states of the extracted DFA. This is fundamentally the most distinguishing feature of algorithms following this pattern. The rest of this section will be dedicated to discuss in depth different strategies explored in the literature, The traversal strategy used to construct transition tables: two different traversal strategies are used to construct transition arcs of the DFA, Breadth-first search or random sampling. The choice of either strategy depends on the trade-off to be made between the computational cost and the risk of non-determinism conflicts. A non-determinism conflict arises where two hidden vectors corresponding to two prefixes that belong to the same cluster will lead to two different clusters when the same symbol of the alphabet is applied, in which case the resulting automaton becomes non-deterministic. It’s worth noting that only the random sampling strategy is concerned by this issue since in the case of breadth-first search strategy, the search is immediately pruned as we reach an already visited state. When the random sampling strategy is used, this conflict is resolved statistically by counting for each cluster-symbol pair the number of transitions that lead to different clusters, and select the one with the maximum number. Our main focus in the rest of this section will be on the first aforementioned point, that is clustering/quantization based strategies used in the literature to convert the RNN hidden state space into a finite one. \n ∙∙\\bullet Quantization-based approaches\nDiscretizing the RNN hidden state space by quantization constitutes the oldest approach for recovering a finite structure from the infinite RNN memory . It consists simply on partitioning the state space into equal partitions with a given resolution, where each partition represents a candidate state of the final DFA. Then, a breadth-first traversal strategy is performed to promote reachable candidate states into validated ones, and build transition arcs of the final automaton. The setting of the resolution parameter is crucial for the success of such strategy. In fact, this latter will determine the trade-off between the size of the resulting automaton -the size of the final automaton could scale exponentially with the dimension of the hidden state space of the RNN, a problem known as a state explosion phenomenon- and the accuracy of the resulting automaton. Intuitively, an excessively coarse partitioning will tend to cluster non-equivalent prefixes(in the sense of Myhill-Neyrode) into one single state. In practice, there is no known method to specify the resolution parameter, and It is done empirically by running the algorithm on different value parameters. Despite its simplicity, this algorithm succeeded to achieve good performance on vanilla RNNs with small-sized automata , . However, recent studies showed that the state explosion phenomenon is unavoidable when this algorithm is used in the context of modern RNN architectures, such as LSTMs/GRUs . \n ∙∙\\bullet Clustering-based approaches.\nA major drawback of the previous method is the high sensitivity of the quality of extracted automata to the resolution parameter that needs to be selected a priori before the run of the algorithm. To resolve this issue, a better alternative will be to give the extraction algorithm the capacity to adapt the coarseness of the state space after obtaining enough information on the arrangement of hidden state vectors in the state space. So, a better strategy will consist in clustering when enough states are visited through a BFS strategy. Then, a classical clustering algorithm is run to identify groups of close prefixes representing a candidate to be a Nerode equivalence class. Many clustering algorithms were proposed in the litterature, including K-means , Hierarchical Clustering , SOM [ref]31 etc. Although K-means requires setting the number of clusters before the run of the algorithm, It’s still the most popular one due to its simplicity. A general rule of using K-means for this task consists at giving a quite great number of clusters to the algorithm as a parameter, then use an automaton minimization procedure a posteriori after obtaining the resulting automaton from the hidden vector space.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: groups of close prefixes representing a candidate to be a Nerode equivalence class.
