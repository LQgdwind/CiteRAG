      "content": "Paper Title: Boosting ship detection in SAR images with complementary pretraining techniques\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe split CNN-based SAR ship detectors into two categories: one-stage ship detector and two-stage ship detector for a fair comparison. The overall detection results of different detectors on the SSDD dataset  are listed in Table VIII. For one-stage detector, we compare the proposed WBF-DM method based on the YOLOv3 [ref]36 benchmark with four CNN-based methods including RetinaNet [ref]11, RFA-Det , DRBox-v2  and FBR-Net . Specifically, our method achieves 1.34% and 2.32% higher precision rate and recall rate compared to the FBR-Net method, respectively. In terms of F1 score and AP0.5subscriptAP0.5\\rm AP_{0.5}, our method obtains 1.83% and 1.67% higher improvements. Furthermore, our method considerably improves AP0.75subscriptAP0.75\\rm AP_{0.75} by a large margin of 11.11%, indicting that the predicted boxes with a higher localization accuracy can be obtained. Compared to other methods, similar enhancements can be also achieved. As for two-stage detector, we also compare our WBF-DM based on the Faster R-CNN [ref]7 benchmark with four CNN-based methods including DCMSNN , R-DFPN , DAPN  and HR-SDNet . It is observed that our WBF-DM method can achieve considerably improvements in all degrees compared to other state-of-the-art ship detectors. More importantly, our methods can be easily combined with other detectors to further boost SAR ship detection. All of these improvements verify the effectiveness and complementarity of OSD-SSD and OSM-SSD, and the superiority of the combination of the two detectors.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: fair comparison.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
