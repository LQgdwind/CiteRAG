      "content": "Paper Title: Auto-Encoding Knowledge Graph for Unsupervised Medical Report Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets   \nIn this paper, we adopt the test sets of IU X-ray  and MIMIC-CXR  for evaluation.\nAll protected health information (e.g., patient name and date of birth) was de-identified.\nIn particular, the IU X-ray  is a widely-used public benchmark dataset for medical report generation and contains 7,470 chest X-ray images associated with 3,955 fully de-identified medical reports.\nEach report is composed of impression, findings and indication sections, etc. [ref]22.\nFollowing , our method also focuses on the findings section as it is the most important component of reports.\nThen, following  [ref]22  [ref]6, we randomly select 70%-10%-20% image-report pairs of dataset to form the training-validation-testing sets.\nThe MIMIC-CXR  includes 377,110 chest x-ray images associated with 227,835 reports.\nThe dataset is officially split into 368,960 images (222,758 reports) for training, 2,991 images (1,808 reports) for validation and 5,159 images (3,269 reports) for testing.\nIt is worth noting that we focus on the unsupervised medical report generation, where the image-report pairs are not available, thus the image-report training pairs of both the IU X-ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets are discarded and are not used in our unsupervised training stage.\nOnly the training reports of MIMIC-CXR and IU X-ray, i.e., 222,758 + 2,770 = 225,528 reports, are used as the independent report corpus to train our unsupervised model.\nOnly under the (semi-)supervised training setting, we will adopt the image-report training pairs to train our approach. Metrics   \nTo fairly compare with existing models  [ref]6, we adopt the evaluation toolkit  to calculate the widely-used natural language generation metrics, i.e., BLEU , METEOR  and ROUGE-L ,\nwhich measure the match between the generated reports and ground truth reports, but are not specialized for the abnormalities in the reports.\nTherefore, to measure the accuracy of descriptions for clinical abnormalities,\nwe further report clinical efficacy metrics following the work of Chen et al. [ref]6. The clinical efficacy metrics are calculated by comparing the generated reports with ground truth reports in 14 different categories related to thoracic diseases and support devices, producing the Precision, Recall and F1 scores. Settings   \nThe size d𝑑d is set to 256.\nFor the attention mechanism in Eq. (4) and Eq. (5), we adopt the multi-head attention 7, the number of heads n𝑛n in multi-head attention is set to 8. The intermediate dimension in ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}, i.e., Eq. (4), is set to 1024.\nBased on the average performance on the validation set, the NBsubscript𝑁BN_{\\text{B}} in knowledge bank, i.e., Eq. (6), is set to 10,000. The NKGsubscript𝑁KGN_{\\text{KG}} in the knowledge graph is set to 200.\nIn our knowledge-driven encoder, the image embedding module adopts the ResNet-50  pre-trained on ImageNet  and fine-tuned on CheXpert dataset  to extract the image embeddings in the shape of 7 ×\\times 7 ×\\times 2048, which will be projected to d=256𝑑256d=256, acquiring I′∈ℝ49×256superscript𝐼′superscriptℝ49256I^{\\prime}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{49\\times 256}, i.e., NI=49subscript𝑁𝐼49N_{I}=49; The report embedding module is implemented by the Transformer 7 equipping with the self-attention mechanism provided in Lin et al. ; NR=NI=49subscript𝑁𝑅subscript𝑁𝐼49N_{R}=N_{I}=49.\nIn both unsupervised and (semi-)supervised settings (see Section 3.3), the batch size is set to 16 and Adam optimizer  with a learning rate of 1e-4 is used for parameter optimization.\nWe also use momentum of 0.8 and weight decay of 0.999.\nAll re-implementations and our experiments were run on 8 V100 GPUs.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: report generation and contains 7,470 chest X-ray images associated with 3,955 fully de-identified medical reports.\nEach report is composed of impression, findings and indication sections, etc. [ref]22.\nFollowing , our method also focuses on the findings section as it is the most important component of reports.\nThen, following  [ref]22  [ref]6, we randomly select 70%-10%-20% image-report\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object. Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. Generate exactly 40 titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning."
