      "content": "Paper Title: Cascaded Local Implicit Transformer for Arbitrary-Scale Super-Resolution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs discussed in Section 1, most of the contemporary SISR works limit their upsampling scales to specific integer values, and are required to train a distinct model for each upsampling scale. To overcome such a limitation, several approaches [ref]16 [ref]17 [ref]18    were proposed to train a unified model for arbitrary upsampling scales. Meta-SR [ref]16 proposed a meta-upscale module for predicting the weights of their convolutional filters from coordinates and scales. The predicted weights are then utilized to perform convolutions to generate HR images. In contrast to Meta-SR, LIIF [ref]17 employs an MLP as a local implicit function, which takes a queried coordinate in an HR image, its nearby feature representations extracted from the corresponding LR image, as well as a cell size to predict an RGB value for that coordinate. UltraSR [ref]18 and IPE  extended LIIF by replacing coordinates with the embedded ones to deal with the spectral bias issue      inherent in MLPs. LTE  further introduced a local texture estimator that transforms coordinates into Fourier domain information to enrich the representational capability of its local implicit function. Different from the above approaches, our proposed methodology exploits a novel local attention mechanism and a cascaded framework to deal with the arbitrary-scale SR. In order to fairly compare with the above approaches, we similarly adopt EDSR , RDN  and SwinIR  as the encoders for our LIT and CLIT.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: SISR works limit their upsampling scales to specific integer values, and are required to train a distinct model for each upsampling scale.
