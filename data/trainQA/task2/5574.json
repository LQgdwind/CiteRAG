Some of these models even totally neglect the local computation, assuming any local computation can be done in a single unit of time. There indeed exist many important contents that is worth considering for communication, such as network topology, synchronization, latency, link capacity, routing, and so on. A lot of early models are dedicated to model the network topology, such as hypercube network  and switch network . See [ref]22 for a survey. PRAM  uses a shared memory to exchange message between processors, and the strategy of exclusive/non-exclusive read/write leads to different variants of PRAM, such CREW (concurrent read, exclusive write), EREW, CRCW and so on. The processors are assumed to have arbitrarily strong computational power. PRAM is the most acknowledged model for theoretical researches in parallel computation. See  for a survey on PRAM simulation methods. BSP  model emphasizes synchronization, where the computation is divided into synchronized supersteps. LogP  emphasizes the cost of message exchanging, where LùêøL stands for latency, oùëúo stands for overhead, and gùëîg stands for gap. CONGEST  emphasizes the network topology and link capacity, which is mostly used to study graph problems   . The communication network in CONGEST has the same topology with the graph problem which it considers, and the length of the messages between any two processors in any round is restricted to O‚Äã(log‚Å°n)ùëÇùëõO(\\log{n}) where nùëõn is the number of processors. The Congested Clique model is an variant of CONGEST, where the communication network is a complete graph. Many graph problems were studied on Congested Clique model such as MST , maximum matching , shortest path [ref]31, etc. There are many theoretical research works on CONGEST and Congested Clique model, and please refer to the references in the papers cited here for more related works. The MPC model  is abstracted from MapReduce , which can also be regarded as a simplified version of BSP. Finally, the topology aware MPC model   is based on the MPC model and involves the consideration for network topology, which directly inspires this work.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: network topology, synchronization, latency, link capacity, routing, and so on.
