      "content": "Paper Title: High-Order Pooling for Graph Neural Networks with Tensor Decomposition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe now discuss relevant work on the parameterization of tensors on graph neural networks.\nIn general, our work relates to three areas of deep learning: (1) aggregation functions, (2) universal approximator for set aggregation, (3) high-order pooling, and (4) tensor methods for deep learning. GNN & Aggregation Scheme  successfully define convolutions on graph-structured data by averaging node information in a neighborhood. [ref]48 prove the incomplete expressivity of mean aggregation to distinguish nodes, and further propose to use sum aggregation to differentiate nodes with similar properties. [ref]13 further generalize this idea and show that mean aggregation can be a particular case of sum aggregation with a linear multiplier, and further propose an architecture with multiple aggregation channels to adaptively learn low-order information. Most GNNs use low-order aggregation schemes for learning node representations. To the best of our knowledge, tGNN is the first GNN architecture that adopts high-order multiplicative interactions in aggregation.\n Universal Approximator & Permutation-invariant NN Universal approximators for set aggregation functions have been previously proposed and studied.  show that sum pooling is enough provided that it is combined with two universal approximators. [ref]48 further discuss the limitations of non-injective set function. 5 propose a generalization of transformers to permutation-invariant sets.\nMost universal approximation results for GNN relies on combining simple aggregation functions (e.g. sum, mean) with universal approximators for the feature and output maps.\nIn contrast, the CP layer achieves the same goal of being an universal approximator but using a different mean: explicit computation of multilinear polynomials (in an effective manner using the CP parameterization). While the approaches might be expressively similar, they may differ from a learning aspect, i.e., how easy it is for these models to learn a function from data. High-order Pooling  formulate the pooling problem as a multiset encoding problem with auxiliary information about the graph structure, and propose an attention-based pooling layer that captures the interaction between nodes according to their structural dependencies.  apply second-order statistic methods because the use of second-order statistics takes advantage of the Riemannian geometry of the space of symmetric positive definite matrices. However, high-order in CP pooling refers to high-dimensional multiplicative feature products, which is different than previous literature. Tensor Methods Tensor methods allow one to define meaningful geometries to build more expressive models.\nAuthors in   define geometries of tensor networks on complex or hypercomplex manifolds, their models encompass greater freedom in the choice of the product between the algebra elements.  develop a general framework for both probabilistic and neural models for tree-structured data with a tensor-based aggregation function.  leverages permutation-invariant CP-based aggregation function to capture high-order interactions in NLP tasks.\nUsing multiplicative interactions as a powerful source of non-linearities in neural network models have been studied previously for convolutional    and recurrent networks   . The connection between such multiplicative interactions with tensor networks have been leveraged both from theoretical and practical perspectives. The CP layer can be seen as a graph generalization of the convolutional and recurrent arithmetic circuits considered in  and , respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: (3) high-order pooling, and (4) tensor methods for deep learning.
