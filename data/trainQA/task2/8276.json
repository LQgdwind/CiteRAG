      "content": "Paper Title: Unifying Sequent Systems for Gödel-Löb Provability Logic via Syntactic Transformations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we review the labeled calculus 𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{G3GL} by Negri  and its correspondence (proven by Goré and Ramanayake ) with a notational variant of Poggiolesi’s tree-hypersequent system for 𝖦𝖫𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{GL} . Labeled sequents are binary graphs of traditional Gentzen sequents, which encode the relational semantics of a logic directly in the syntax of sequents. The formalism of labeled sequents has been extensively studied with the inception of the formalism dating back to the work of Kanger  and achieving its modern form in the work of Simpson . It has been shown that labeled sequent systems can capture sizable and diverse classes of logics in a cut-free manner while exhibiting fundamental properties such as the admissibility of various structural rules and the invertibility of rules   . By contrast, tree-hypersequents, which are more traditionally known as nested sequents, are trees of Gentzen sequents. The formalism was introduced independently by Kashima  and Bull  with further influential works provided by Brünnler  and Poggiolesi  . Such systems arose out of a call for cut-free sequent-style systems for logics not known to possess a cut-free Gentzen system, such as the tense logic 𝖪𝗍subscript𝖪𝗍\\mathsf{K_{t}} and the modal logic 𝖲𝟧𝖲𝟧\\mathsf{S5}. Like labeled sequents, tree-hypersequent systems exhibit fundamental admissibility and invertibility properties, having been defined for large classes of various logics such as tense logics , intuitionistic modal logics  [ref]24, and first-order non-classical logics  [ref]26. As observed by Goré and Ramanayake , restricting labeled sequents to be trees, rather than more general, binary graphs (which may by disconnected or include cycles), yields labeled tree sequents (cf. ), which are a notational variant of tree-hypersequents/nested sequents. Via this observation, the authors established bi-directional proof transformations between Negri’s labeled sequent calculus and Poggiolesi’s tree-hypersequent calculus for 𝖦𝖫𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{GL}. Proof theoretic correspondences between labeled and nested systems for various other logics have been established in recent years as well; e.g., for tense logics , first-order intuitionistic logics [ref]22 , and intuitionistic modal logics [ref]24. Recently, it was proven in a general setting that correspondences between labeled and nested systems are a product of two underlying proof transformation techniques, structural rule elimination and introduction, and that (Horn) labeled and nested systems tend to come in pairs, being dual to one another . Reducing Negri’s labeled sequent system to one that uses trees, as opposed to binary graphs, is the first step in establishing syntactic correspondences between the various sequent systems for 𝖦𝖫𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{GL}. As shown in the sequel, we will systematically reduce the structure of sequents in proofs: first, going from binary graphs of Gentzen sequents to trees of Gentzen sequents (this section), then from trees of Gentzen sequents to lines of Gentzen sequents (Section 4), and last from lines of Gentzen sequents to Gentzen sequents themselves, which are easily embedded in labeled sequent proofs, completing the circuit of correspondences (Section 5). This yields correspondences between the most widely regarded sequent systems for 𝖦𝖫𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{GL}, as depicted in Figure 1.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: tree-hypersequent systems exhibit fundamental admissibility and invertibility properties, having been defined for large classes of various logics such as tense logics , intuitionistic modal logics  [ref]24, and first-order non-classical logics  [ref]26.
