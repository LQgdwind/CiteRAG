      "content": "Paper Title: QMagFace: Simple and Accurate Quality-Aware Face Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDriven by the international standards, such as ISO/IEC 19794-5  and ICAO 9303 , the first generation of face image quality assessment (FIQA) approaches are built on human perceptive image quality factors 4 1.\nThe second generation of FIQA approaches 363 consists of supervised learning algorithms based on human or artificially constructed quality labels.\nHowever, humans may not know the best characteristics for face recognition systems and artificially labelled quality values, derived from comparison scores, rely on error-prone labelling mechanisms. The third generation of FIQA approaches [ref]42 completely avoids the use of quality labels by utilizing the face recognition networks themselves.\nIn 2020, Terhörst et al. [ref]42 proposed stochastic embedding robustness for FIQA (SER-FIQ).\nThis concept measures the robustness of a face representation against dropout variations and uses this measure to determine the quality of a face.\nIt avoids the need for training and takes into account the decision patterns of the deployed face recognition model.\nIn 2021, Meng et al. 1 proposed a class of loss functions that include magnitude-aware angular margins encoding the quality into the face representation.\nTraining with this loss results in a face recognition model that produces embeddings whose magnitudes can measure the FIQ of their faces. While the first two generations of FIQA methods aim to assess the utility of an image for face recognition in general, the third generation aims at determining model-specific quality values.\nTherefore, we assert that these methods, SER-FIQ [ref]42 and MagFace 1, have the highest potential for improving the recognition performance.\nSER-FIQ can be applied to arbitrary face recognition networks but produce a complex relation between FIQ and comparison scores.\nOn the other hand, MagFace produces a linear relationship between the qualities and the comparison scores, as we will show in Section 5.4, and thus, it is more suitable for a generalisable enhancement of the recognition performance.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: for face recognition systems and artificially labelled quality values, derived from comparison scores, rely on error-prone labelling mechanisms. The third generation of FIQA approaches [ref]42 completely avoids the use of quality labels by utilizing the face recognition networks themselves.\nIn 2020, Terhörst et al. [ref]42 proposed stochastic embedding robustness for FIQA\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
