Take two positive integer numbers g𝑔g and hℎh and a real number β>1𝛽1\\beta>1. There exists a positive real number δ=δ​(g,h,β)𝛿𝛿𝑔ℎ𝛽\\delta=\\delta(g,h,\\beta) and a positive integer number n0=n0​(g,h,β)subscript𝑛0subscript𝑛0𝑔ℎ𝛽n_{0}=n_{0}(g,h,\\beta) such that, for each n≥n0𝑛subscript𝑛0n\\geq n_{0}, there exists a hypergraph ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} with the following properties: ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} has n𝑛n vertices; gir⁡(ℋ)≥ggirℋ𝑔\\operatorname{gir}(\\mathcal{H})\\geq g; chr⁡(ℋ)≥hchrℋℎ\\operatorname{chr}(\\mathcal{H})\\geq h; ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} is (δ​n,β)𝛿𝑛𝛽(\\delta n,\\beta)-threshold-sparse. As discussed in the Overview, our proof of Theorem 10 is probabilistic, and it combines Erdős–Hajnal’s proof of the existence of hypergraphs with arbitrarily large girth and chromatic number  with Atserias–Dalmau’s result on the sparsity of random Erdős-Rényi hypergraphs [ref]1. The latter result is stated in terms of a different version of threshold-sparsity, which we now define.252525We remark that the notion of threshold-sparsity given in Subsection 2.3 is also implicit in [ref]1. For μ𝜇\\mu and ν𝜈\\nu positive real numbers, we say that a hypergraph ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} is (μ,ν)𝜇𝜈(\\mu,\\nu)-vertex-threshold-sparse if any subhypergraph ℋ′superscriptℋ′\\mathcal{H}^{\\prime} of ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} such that nℋ′≤μ⋅nℋsubscript𝑛superscriptℋ′⋅𝜇subscript𝑛ℋn_{\\mathcal{H}^{\\prime}}\\leq\\mu\\cdot n_{\\mathcal{H}} satisfies mℋ′<ν⋅nℋ′subscript𝑚superscriptℋ′⋅𝜈subscript𝑛superscriptℋ′m_{\\mathcal{H}^{\\prime}}<\\nu\\cdot n_{\\mathcal{H}^{\\prime}}.\nThe following simple result connects the two notions of threshold-sparsity. Let β>1,γ,μ,ν𝛽1𝛾𝜇𝜈\\beta>1,\\gamma,\\mu,\\nu be positive real numbers, let ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} be a (μ,ν)𝜇𝜈(\\mu,\\nu)-vertex-threshold-sparse hypergraph, and suppose that βν≥r−1𝛽𝜈𝑟1\\frac{\\beta}{\\nu}\\geq r-1 and nℋ≥(r−1)​γβ​μsubscript𝑛ℋ𝑟1𝛾𝛽𝜇n_{\\mathcal{H}}\\geq(r-1)\\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta\\mu}. Then, ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} is (γ,β)𝛾𝛽(\\gamma,\\beta)-threshold-sparse. Let ℋ′superscriptℋ′\\mathcal{H}^{\\prime} be a subhypergraph of ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} satisfying mℋ′≤γsubscript𝑚superscriptℋ′𝛾m_{\\mathcal{H}^{\\prime}}\\leq\\gamma, and suppose that ℋ′superscriptℋ′\\mathcal{H}^{\\prime} is not β𝛽\\beta-sparse. We obtain Since ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} is (μ,ν)𝜇𝜈(\\mu,\\nu)-vertex-threshold-sparse, we deduce that which contradicts the fact that\nℋ′superscriptℋ′\\mathcal{H}^{\\prime} is not β𝛽\\beta-sparse.\n∎ For n∈ℕ𝑛ℕn\\in\\mathbb{N} and p∈ℝ𝑝ℝp\\in\\mathbb{R}, 0≤p≤10𝑝10\\leq p\\leq 1, the expression ℋ∼ℋ​(n,p)similar-toℋℋ𝑛𝑝\\mathcal{H}\\sim\\mathscr{H}(n,p) shall denote that ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} is a random (r𝑟r-uniform) Erdős-Rényi hypergraph with n𝑛n vertices, where each r𝑟r-element set of vertices forms a hyperedge with probability p𝑝p, independently.\nThe next result gives an upper bound on the probability that a random Erdős-Rényi hypergraph is not vertex-threshold-sparse. Let μ,ν,ℓ𝜇𝜈ℓ\\mu,\\nu,\\ell be positive real numbers and let n𝑛n be a positive integer number. If 1≤ℓ≤nr−11ℓsuperscript𝑛𝑟11\\leq\\ell\\leq n^{r-1} and μ≤(νℓ)1r−1​(re)rr−1𝜇superscript𝜈ℓ1𝑟1superscript𝑟𝑒𝑟𝑟1\\mu\\leq(\\frac{\\nu}{\\ell})^{\\frac{1}{r-1}}(\\frac{r}{e})^{\\frac{r}{r-1}}, the probability that a random hypergraph ℋ∼ℋ​(n,ℓ​n1−r)similar-toℋℋ𝑛ℓsuperscript𝑛1𝑟\\mathcal{H}\\sim\\mathscr{H}(n,\\ell n^{1-r}) is not (μ,ν)𝜇𝜈(\\mu,\\nu)-vertex-threshold-sparse is at most Consider the following parameters: Notice that all of them are positive real numbers. Let n𝑛n be an even positive integer number to be determined later, and suppose that n≥ℓ1r−1𝑛superscriptℓ1𝑟1n\\geq\\ell^{\\frac{1}{r-1}}. Let p=ℓ​n1−r𝑝ℓsuperscript𝑛1𝑟p=\\ell n^{1-r}, and sample a hypergraph ℋ∼ℋ​(n,p)similar-toℋℋ𝑛𝑝\\mathcal{H}\\sim\\mathscr{H}(n,p). Fix w=⌊n2​h⌋𝑤𝑛2ℎw=\\lfloor\\frac{n}{2h}\\rfloor, and let W𝑊W be the random variable counting the number of independent sets in ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} of size w𝑤w (where an independent set is a set S𝑆S of vertices such that e⊈Snot-subset-of-or-equals𝑒𝑆e\\not\\subseteq S for any e∈E​(ℋ)𝑒𝐸ℋe\\in E(\\mathcal{H})).\nSuppose that n≥2​h​r𝑛2ℎ𝑟n\\geq 2hr (which implies that w≥r𝑤𝑟w\\geq r) and that n≥6​h𝑛6ℎn\\geq 6h (which implies that w≥n2​h−1≥n3​h𝑤𝑛2ℎ1𝑛3ℎw\\geq\\frac{n}{2h}-1\\geq\\frac{n}{3h}).\nIt is well known that, for 1≤x≤y1𝑥𝑦1\\leq x\\leq y, the inequalities hold (for example, see [ref]26).\nAs a consequence, using the linearity of expectation, we obtain the following upper bound for the expected value of W𝑊W: The choice of ℓℓ\\ell guarantees that\n(3​e​h)12​h<eℓ(3​h​r)rsuperscript3𝑒ℎ12ℎsuperscript𝑒ℓsuperscript3ℎ𝑟𝑟(3eh)^{\\frac{1}{2h}}<e^{\\frac{\\ell}{(3hr)^{r}}}, whence it follows that\n𝔼​[W]𝔼delimited-[]𝑊\\mathbb{E}[W] approaches 00 as n𝑛n tends to infinity. Recall that the independence number of ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} (in symbols, ind⁡(ℋ)indℋ\\operatorname{ind}(\\mathcal{H})) is the maximum cardinality of an independent set in ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}.\nBy Markov’s inequality, the probability that W𝑊W is at least 111\n— i.e., that ind⁡(ℋ)≥windℋ𝑤\\operatorname{ind}(\\mathcal{H})\\geq w — is at most 𝔼​[W]𝔼delimited-[]𝑊\\mathbb{E}[W] and, thus, it tends to 00 as n𝑛n tends to infinity.\nIn particular, for n𝑛n large enough, It is well known  that a cycle of length j≥2𝑗2j\\geq 2 in a hypergraph yields a collection of distinct hyperedges e1,…,ejsubscript𝑒1…subscript𝑒𝑗e_{1},\\dots,e_{j} such that |∪i∈[j]ei|≤j​(r−1)subscript𝑖delimited-[]𝑗subscript𝑒𝑖𝑗𝑟1|\\cup_{i\\in[j]}e_{i}|\\leq j(r-1) and, vice versa, a collection of j𝑗j distinct hyperedges satisfying this condition contains a cycle of length at most j𝑗j. The number of such collections is at most which is upper-bounded by xj​nj​(r−1)subscript𝑥𝑗superscript𝑛𝑗𝑟1x_{j}n^{j(r-1)} for some constant xjsubscript𝑥𝑗x_{j} independent of n𝑛n.\nLet a short cycle indicate a cycle of length at most g−1𝑔1g-1, and let V𝑉V be the random variable counting the number of short cycles in ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}.\nBy linearity of expectation, we find Hence, using Markov’s inequality, we deduce that the probability that V𝑉V is at least n2𝑛2\\frac{n}{2} is at most Since the numerator in the expression above is independent of n𝑛n, the fraction approaches 00 as n𝑛n tends to infinity. In particular, for n𝑛n large enough. Let A𝐴A be the event that ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} is not (μ,ν)𝜇𝜈(\\mu,\\nu)-vertex-threshold-sparse.\nThe choice of μ𝜇\\mu guarantees that\nProposition 27 applies. Hence,\nthe probability of A𝐴A is upper bounded by the quantity π=π​(r,ℓ,n,μ,ν)𝜋𝜋𝑟ℓ𝑛𝜇𝜈\\pi=\\pi(r,\\ell,n,\\mu,\\nu) in (3). From the fact that μ≤(3​ϑ)−1β−1𝜇superscript3italic-ϑ1𝛽1\\mu\\leq(3\\vartheta)^{-\\frac{1}{\\beta-1}}, we deduce that μβ−1​ϑ≤13superscript𝜇𝛽1italic-ϑ13\\mu^{\\beta-1}\\vartheta\\leq\\frac{1}{3}. Therefore, By the union bound, we deduce from (10), (11), and (12) that, if n𝑛n is large enough, there exists a hypergraph ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} having n𝑛n vertices such that W=0𝑊0W=0, V<n2𝑉𝑛2V<\\frac{n}{2}, and A𝐴A does not hold. In other words, ind⁡(ℋ)<windℋ𝑤\\operatorname{ind}(\\mathcal{H})<w, ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} has fewer than n2𝑛2\\frac{n}{2} short cycles, and ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} is (μ,ν)𝜇𝜈(\\mu,\\nu)-vertex-threshold-sparse. Select a set S𝑆S of vertices of ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} of cardinality n2𝑛2\\frac{n}{2} in a way that each short cycle of ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} contains a vertex of S𝑆S, and let ℋ~~ℋ\\tilde{\\mathcal{H}} be the subhypergraph of ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} induced by V​(ℋ)∖S𝑉ℋ𝑆V(\\mathcal{H})\\setminus S. Note that nℋ~=n2subscript𝑛~ℋ𝑛2n_{\\tilde{\\mathcal{H}}}=\\frac{n}{2}. Furthermore, ind⁡(ℋ~)≤ind⁡(ℋ)<wind~ℋindℋ𝑤\\operatorname{ind}(\\tilde{\\mathcal{H}})\\leq\\operatorname{ind}(\\mathcal{H})<w, while gir⁡(ℋ~)≥ggir~ℋ𝑔\\operatorname{gir}(\\tilde{\\mathcal{H}})\\geq g since all short cycles have been broken. Since the product of the chromatic and the independence numbers of a hypergraph is at least the number of its vertices (see ), we find Finally, observe that ℋ~~ℋ\\tilde{\\mathcal{H}} is (μ,ν)𝜇𝜈(\\mu,\\nu)-vertex-threshold-sparse by monotonicity of vertex-threshold-sparsity. The choice of δ𝛿\\delta guarantees that Therefore, Lemma 26 implies that ℋ~~ℋ\\tilde{\\mathcal{H}} is (δ​nℋ~,β)𝛿subscript𝑛~ℋ𝛽(\\delta n_{\\tilde{\\mathcal{H}}},\\beta)-threshold-sparse, thus concluding the proof of Theorem 10.\n∎\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: it combines Erdős–Hajnal’s proof of the existence of hypergraphs with arbitrarily large girth and chromatic number  with Atserias–Dalmau’s result on the sparsity of random Erdős-Rényi hypergraphs [ref]1.
