      "content": "Paper Title: Speedup deep learning models on GPU by taking advantage of efficient unstructured pruning and bit-width reduction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, the results of the pruning and quantisation of the Resnet50, VGG16, FasterRCNN [ref]42 and 1D CNN autoencoders [ref]43 are shown. The models were run on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet (for classfication tasks), VOC Pascal (for object detection) and MSL (for anomaly detection).\nIn Tables 1 and 2, the achieved level of sparsity by the pruning algorithm is described for VGG16 and Resnet50 on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. The accuracy metric is top1. It measures the proportion of examples for which the predicted label matches the target label. The dense models are the baseline models (left side of ‚Üí‚Üí\\rightarrow in Tables 1, 2 and 4, the right side\nof ‚Üí‚Üí\\rightarrow is accuracy of pruned model). In the results, values for weighted sparsity are given. We can see that aside from high sparsity and huge memory reduction, the top1 accuracy is increased (error is reduced). In the case of Resnet50, it is noteworthy that the achieved pruned version is one of the smallest (memory footprint) of the TOP40 models run on the CIFAR100 (see ranking [ref]44). Additionally, a comparison of the results between the described pruning algorithm and others in the literature is presented. In the case of VGG16 run on CIFAR10 (Table 1) the sparsity achieved by the algorithm is the second result after SparseVD , but has a slightly better final accuracy (+0.05%). Most of the methods in Table 1 are structural pruning-based algorithms. In the case of Resnet50 run on CIFAR100, our method outperforms other methods with regard to the level of sparsity (more than 90%, Table 2) and top1 accuracy. It is worth noting that accuracy after pruning of Resnet50 on CIFAR100 is one of the best achieved with this model without dataset augmentation (78.23%). The VGG16 model run on CIFAR100 was pruned with 90% sparsity level in all layers with very small drop in top1 (65.8% (baseline) ‚Üí‚Üí\\rightarrow 65.4% (pruned)). Our results were achieved by running 200 epochs of the training process with a ranked list length equal to 16. The batch size was set to 100 for CIFAR10 and to 128 for CIFAR100. The learning rate was 0.01. The VGG16 backbone in the FasterRCNN object-detection network was the next model compressed by UnSparse-Opt. The FasterRCNN feature extractor consists of thirteen VGG16 convolutional layers. The results are shown in Table 2. The metric is mAP (mean average precision). Average precision computes the average precision value for recall value over 0 to 1 [ref]42. The mAP is the average of AP. The weighted sparsity is 85% with a negligible drop in mAP (71.5% (baseline) ‚Üí‚Üí\\rightarrow 71.1% (pruned)). In the third layer (of size 64x128), the eighth layer (of size 256x512) and all layers of size 512x512, it was possible to achieve a level of sparsity greater than or equal to 92% without any significant drop in accuracy. This sparsity level guarantees direct sparse acceleration (see subsection 4.2). The next models taken in the experiments were CNN autoencoders. The CNN autoencoders are one of the most efficient models used in anomaly detection tasks [ref]43. The simulations were performed on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) dataset .\nThe dataset is separated into twenty-seven independent entities. In the presented experiments, one autoencoder architecture was trained and pruned separately on five chosen entities from the MSL dataset (M-2, M-6, F-7, D-16 and T-9). The model consists of twelve 1D convolutional layers (with 3x3 and 1x1 filters). Six of them are in the encoder and the next six are in the decoder module. The results of the pruned CNN autoencoders are shown in Table 3. In all cases, layers have been pruned to a sparsity level of 77%.\nThe accuracy metric is F‚Äã1ùêπ1F1. It is well-suited for anomaly detection tasks, as it is more resistant to class imbalance than other metrics such as top1 accuracy (which are susceptible to yield high values when the normal class in testing data is large and the anomaly class is underrepresented).\nAs it is shown in Table 3 the F‚Äã1ùêπ1F1 score is still above or at the same level as it is in a dense baseline models. The results on ImageNet are described in Table 4. The results show that it is not possible to achieve levels of sparsities for Resnet50 and VGG16 which can give acceleration using a direct sparse approach (see subsection 4.2). The presented pruning algorithm and other well-known methods achieve weighted sparsities between 70%-80% (Table 4). In the case of sparsity levels which guarantee speedup in direct sparse (92% in 3x3 filters and 90% in 1x1 filters, see subsection 4.2), the drop of accuracy in Resnet50 is around 8-9% (Table 4). In the case of VGG16, the weighted sparsity is quite high in all presented algorithms (92.5%-95.2%, Table 4). In VGG16, the largest layers are three fully-connected and they have the highest pruning scores. Some convolutional layers have sparsities slightly lower than 90%, which makes them more time efficient in cuDnn than in the direct sparse method. The batch size used in experiments for ImageNet was 256. The learning rate was set to 0.01. In Table 5 the results of quantisation approaches are presented. The linear sixteen-bit (half precision both for weights and activations - 16b/16b) quantisation and nonlinear cluster based four-bit quantisation were performed: weights are mapped to 16 centroids and each centroid represented in sixteen-bit format). The sixteen-bit quantisation called half precision can be directly used in cuDnn as an option. In the case of four bit quantisation, it can be used in future hardware optimisations. The quantisation was run on pruned models. It is worth noting that in the case of the 16b/16b configuration, all models have no drop in accuracy (in many cases with an improvement above a 0.1%, Table 5). In the case of 4b/16b, the 5.5% average drop was observed on five tested 1D CNN auto-encoders. The 4b/16b does not heavily affect accuracy of CNN models on smaller datasets (VOC Pascal and CIFAR100), but it is more sensitive in the case of huge datasets like ImageNet (drop in accuracy about 6-7%).\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: In this section, the results of the pruning and quantisation of the Resnet50, VGG16, FasterRCNN [ref]42 and 1D CNN autoencoders [ref]43 are shown.
