      "content": "Paper Title: Non-conflicting no-where zero 𝑍₂×𝑍₂ flows in cubic graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this paper, we considered the problem of existence of a perfect matching F𝐹F in a bridgeless cubic graph G𝐺G with respect to which G/F¯𝐺¯𝐹G/\\overline{F} admits a non-conflicting no-where zero Z2×Z2subscript𝑍2subscript𝑍2Z_{2}\\times Z_{2} flow. We demonstrated the usefulness of this concept by showing that if a bridgeless cubic graph G𝐺G has such a perfect matching, then it admits a normal 6-edge-coloring. Moreover, we have related non-conflicting no-where zero Z2×Z2subscript𝑍2subscript𝑍2Z_{2}\\times Z_{2} flows in cubic graphs to a recent conjecture of Thomassen about the existence of a pair of edge-disjoint perfect matchings in highly edge-connected regular graphs. Our main results state that claw-free bridgeless cubic graphs G𝐺G have a perfect matching F𝐹F with respect to which G/F¯𝐺¯𝐹G/\\overline{F} admits a non-conflicting no-where zero Z2×Z2subscript𝑍2subscript𝑍2Z_{2}\\times Z_{2} flow. Moreover, one can find such a perfect matching in bridgeless cubic graphs which have a 2-factor that contains at most two cycles if G𝐺G is not the Petersen graph. In the second half of the paper, we constructed infinitely many 2-edge-connected cubic graphs G𝐺G that do not admit a non-conflicting no-where zero Z2×Z2subscript𝑍2subscript𝑍2Z_{2}\\times Z_{2} flow with respect to F¯¯𝐹\\overline{F} for any perfect matching F𝐹F of G𝐺G. From our perspective there are some questions that deserve further consideration. In Proposition 2, we showed that the smallest counter-example to Conjecture 5 is 3-edge-connected. Hence they do not contain 2-edge-cuts. This prompted Mazzuoccolo to ask whether P10subscript𝑃10P_{10} is the only 3-edge-connected cubic graph which does not admit a non-conflicting no-where zero Z2×Z2subscript𝑍2subscript𝑍2Z_{2}\\times Z_{2} flow with respect to F¯¯𝐹\\overline{F} for any perfect matching F𝐹F of G𝐺G? Note that since P10subscript𝑃10P_{10} admits a normal 5-edge-coloring, it is not a counter-example to Conjecture 5. Thus, Mazzuoccolo’s statement combined with Proposition 2 and Lemma 1 implies Conjecture 5. The author suspects that this statement is not true. Thus, Mazzuoccolo asked whether P10subscript𝑃10P_{10} is the only cyclically 4-edge-connected cubic graph G𝐺G which does not have a non-conflicting no-where zero Z2×Z2subscript𝑍2subscript𝑍2Z_{2}\\times Z_{2} flow with respect to F¯¯𝐹\\overline{F} for any perfect matching F𝐹F of G𝐺G. Note that if this statement is true, then cyclically 4-edge-connected cubic graphs will admit a normal 6-edge-coloring. Unfortunately, as we stated in Remark 2, this does not directly imply Conjecture 5. Nevertheless, the author thinks that this is a question deserving further consideration. The author suspects that the answer to this question should be negative, too. As a result, he would like to offer: There exists infinitely many cyclically 6-edge-connected cubic graphs G𝐺G which do not have a non-conflicting no-where zero Z2×Z2subscript𝑍2subscript𝑍2Z_{2}\\times Z_{2} flow with respect to F¯¯𝐹\\overline{F} for any perfect matching F𝐹F of G𝐺G. Note that in Conjecture 7 for cyclic edge-connectivity we write six and not a larger number, because of the standard Jaeger-Swart conjecture  in the area which predicts that all cyclically 7-edge-connected cubic graphs are 3-edge-colorable. Note that Thomassen conjectures even more that all cyclically 8-edge-connected cubic graphs are Hamiltonian. Another interesting problem by Mazzuoccolo is the following one: For every g≥3𝑔3g\\geq 3 construct infinitely many 3-edge-connected cubic graphs G𝐺G of girth at least g𝑔g that do not admit a non-conflicting no-where zero Z2×Z2subscript𝑍2subscript𝑍2Z_{2}\\times Z_{2} flow with respect to F¯¯𝐹\\overline{F} for any perfect matching F𝐹F of G𝐺G. This problem is the reminiscent of the girth conjecture in the area that was predicting that all snarks should have bounded girth. Recall that girth conjecture has been refuted by Kochol in  where he constructed snarks of arbitrary large girth. Kochol’s approach has been simplified in papers  and . As we mentioned in Observation 2, every bipartite cubic graph admits a non-conflicting flow with respect to every 2-factor F¯¯𝐹\\overline{F}. One can state a conjecture that predicts the converse: if a cubic graph G𝐺G admits a non-conflicting flow with respect to every 2-factor F¯¯𝐹\\overline{F}, then G𝐺G is bipartite. Unfortunately, this statement is not true. Consider a cubic graph such that its every 2-factor is a Hamiltonian cycle (such as K4subscript𝐾4K_{4}, Figure 6). Then it is an obvious counter-example to our conjecture by Observation 1. One can construct more connected examples as follows: consider a graph G𝐺G which is a ring of diamonds or 2-cycles (see Theorem 4). Note that the components of every 2-factor F¯¯𝐹\\overline{F} of such a graph are even cycles. Hence, they admit a non-conflicting no-where zero Z2×Z2subscript𝑍2subscript𝑍2Z_{2}\\times Z_{2} flow with respect to F¯¯𝐹\\overline{F} for any perfect matching F𝐹F of G𝐺G by Observation 1. Note that these graphs are not bipartite as diamonds contain triangles. The examples described above are 3-edge-colorable. If one takes the graph K23superscriptsubscript𝐾23K_{2}^{3} (Figure 6) and replaces both of its vertices with a P10−vsubscript𝑃10𝑣P_{10}-v, then the resulting graph is not 3-edge-colorable, however G/F¯𝐺¯𝐹G/\\overline{F} admits a non-conflicting no-where zero Z2×Z2subscript𝑍2subscript𝑍2Z_{2}\\times Z_{2}-flow with respect to every 2-factor F¯¯𝐹\\overline{F}. Thus, as an interesting problem we would like to offer: Characterize 2-edge-connected cubic graphs in which G/F¯𝐺¯𝐹G/\\overline{F} admits a non-conflicting no-where zero Z2×Z2subscript𝑍2subscript𝑍2Z_{2}\\times Z_{2}-flow with respect to every 2-factor F¯¯𝐹\\overline{F}. Note that as we mentioned in Remark 3, if F¯¯𝐹\\overline{F} contains a triangle, then G/F¯𝐺¯𝐹G/\\overline{F} does not admit a non-conflicting no-where zero Z2×Z2subscript𝑍2subscript𝑍2Z_{2}\\times Z_{2}-flow with respect to F¯¯𝐹\\overline{F}. Thus, graphs satisfying the conditions of Problem 2 should not contain a triangle in any of its 2-factor. As rings of diamonds demonstrate, this does not necessarily mean that G𝐺G should not contain a triangle. Our last conjecture states: Let G𝐺G be a bridgeless cubic graph containing a Hamiltonian path. Then G/F¯𝐺¯𝐹G/\\overline{F} admits a non-conflicting no-where zero Z2×Z2subscript𝑍2subscript𝑍2Z_{2}\\times Z_{2} flow with respect to some 2-factor F¯¯𝐹\\overline{F} unless G𝐺G is the Petersen graph. Note that Conjecture 8 implies that if a bridgeless cubic graph G𝐺G has a vertex z𝑧z such that G−z𝐺𝑧G-z has a Hamiltonian cycle, then G/F¯𝐺¯𝐹G/\\overline{F} admits a non-conflicting no-where zero Z2×Z2subscript𝑍2subscript𝑍2Z_{2}\\times Z_{2} flow with respect to some 2-factor F¯¯𝐹\\overline{F} unless G𝐺G is the Petersen graph. The latter implies that if G𝐺G is a cubic graph such that for every vertex z𝑧z G−z𝐺𝑧G-z contains a Hamiltonian cycle, then G/F¯𝐺¯𝐹G/\\overline{F} admits a non-conflicting no-where zero Z2×Z2subscript𝑍2subscript𝑍2Z_{2}\\times Z_{2} flow with respect to some 2-factor F¯¯𝐹\\overline{F} unless G𝐺G is the Petersen graph. Non-3-edge-colorable bridgeless cubic graphs in which for every vertex z𝑧z G−z𝐺𝑧G-z contains a Hamiltonian cycle are called Hypo-Hamiltonian snarks and examples of such graphs can be found in [ref]28 and Theorem 2.5 from .\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: graph.
