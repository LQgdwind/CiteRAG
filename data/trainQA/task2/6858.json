      "content": "Paper Title: InstructionGPT-4: A 200-Instruction Paradigm for Fine-Tuning MiniGPT-4\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGPT-4  has showcased its powerful prowess in generating highly detailed and precise descriptions of images, signaling a new era of language and visual processing. Thus, GPT-4 like Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently emerged as a prominent research area, harnessing powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) as a cognitive framework for conducting multimodal tasks.\nThe remarkable and unexpected capabilities exhibited by MLLMs surpass those of traditional methods, indicating a potential pathway towards artificial general intelligence.\nTo achieve this, massive image-text pairs and vision-language instruction tuning data have been employed to train simple connectors (e.g., MiniGPT-4 [ref]1 and LLaVA ) between frozen LLMs (e.g., LLaMA  and Vicuna ) and visual representations (e.g., CLIP [ref]6 and BLIP-2 ). MLLMs are usually trained in two stages: pre-training and fine-tuning [ref]1   .\nPre-training on image-text pairs helps MLLMs gain a large amount of knowledge while fine-tuning teaches models to better understand human intentions and generate accurate responses.\nRecently, instruction tuning on large-scale datasets has served as a powerful fine-tuning technique to empower MLLMs with enhanced vision-language understanding and instruction-following abilities   .\nIt facilitates the alignment of models with human preferences, enabling the generation of desired outputs in response to various instructions.\nRecent state-of-the-arts, including InstructBLIP  and Otter , have shown promising results by leveraging a collection of vision-language datasets for visual instruction tuning. However, it has been observed that commonly used instruction-tuning datasets surprisingly contain numerous low-quality instances with incorrect or irrelevant responses [ref]14  .\nSuch data can mislead and negatively impact the performance of the model.\nThis issue has prompted researchers to delve into the possibility of achieving robust performance using a small quantity of high-quality instruction-following data.\nEncouragingly, recent studies have substantiated the promising potential of this approach.\nZhou et al. [ref]14 introduce LIMA, a language model fine-tuned with carefully curated high-quality data, selected by human experts.\nThis study has shown that LLMs can achieve satisfactory results even with a limited amount of high-quality instruction-following data.\nThe proposed idea “Less is More” tells that data quality is more important than data quantity to improve model performance, which does not conflict with the Scaling Law .\nBuilding upon these foundations, our objective is to determine if using less instruction data can yield better alignment results in multimodal large language models.\nNevertheless, there is a challenge that the process of collecting appropriate high-quality vision-language datasets for fine-tuning multimodal language models lacks clear guidelines. Different from LIMA [ref]14 that requires manually constructed dataset, we aim to propose a robust and effective data selector that automatically identifies and filters low-quality vision-language data from existing datasets, ensuring that our model is trained on the most relevant and informative samples.\nThe key focus of our study lies in exploring the efficacy of reduced but high-quality instruction-tuning data in fine-tuning MLLMs.\nAnother challenge is the current lack of comprehensive methods for evaluating the quality of vision-language data.\nTherefore, we introduce several novel metrics tailored for assessing the quality of multimodal instruction data, including CLIP Score [ref]6, GPT Score , Reward Score , Length Score and Multimodal Features of each vision-language data. To investigate the metrics’ relationship with the real instruction data quality, we first split a range of distinct subsets from the original fine-tuning data. Subsequently, we record each fine-tuned model’s performance on the validation set as the labels of data quality.\nWe then compute the metrics and multimodal data features and combine them as an embedding across each subset.\nAfter that, we apply a self-attention network as the data selector to determine the relationship between the genuine quality labels and embeddings.\nWe perform spectral clustering , which aims to ensure the diversity of data distribution, on the original 3.4K data used to fine-tune MiniGPT-4.\nFinally, we apply the data selector on each cluster to predict its quality label and sort.\nThrough this series of procedures, InstructionGPT-4 is fine-tuned on a much smaller but carefully selected subset following the same training configuration of MiniGPT-4. Our evaluations focus on a wide range of complex open-domain multimodal large language model benchmarks, including MME 0, MMBench 1, VQA datasets from LVLM-eHub 2, etc.\nThrough rigorous experimentation, we demonstrate that 200 pieces of data used for fine-tuning, which is 6% of the original scale, are enough to help InstructionGPT-4 achieve comprehensive superiority over MiniGPT-4 across these diverse multimodal tasks, with a +23 score enhancement on MME, a +1.55 score improvement on MMBench, and a +1.76% increase in performance on VQA datasets compared to MiniGPT-4.\nSpecifically, InstructionGPT-4 outperforms MiniGPT-4 in 8 out of 14 tasks within MME, 13 out of 20 abilities in MMBench, and excels in all four VQA datasets included in LVLM-eHub.\nThis discovery is inspiring, as it demonstrates that the data quality in vision-language instruction tuning can outweigh the quantity.\nIn addition, this shift towards prioritizing data quality presents a new and more efficient paradigm that can generally improve the fine-tuning stage of MLLMs. Our contributions are summarized as follows: We are the first to demonstrate that less instruction data for better alignment is also suitable for multimodal large language model, by showing that fine-tuning MiniGPT-4 with only 6% instruction-following data can achieve better performance. We introduce the concept of genuine quality labels along with a set of indicators for evaluating the quality of multimodal instruction-following data, and propose a learnable data selector to obtain high-quality vision-language data for fine-tuning. Our InstructionGPT-4 fine-tuned with 200 instructions consistently outperforms the original MiniGPT-4 in various popular benchmarks such as MME, MMBench and VQA datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: pathway towards artificial general intelligence.\nTo achieve this, massive image-text pairs and vision-language instruction tuning data have been employed to train simple connectors (e.g., MiniGPT-4 [ref]1 and LLaVA ) between frozen LLMs (e.g., LLaMA  and Vicuna ) and visual representations (e.g., CLIP [ref]6 and BLIP-2 ).
