      "content": "Paper Title: Lower Bounds on the Running Time of Two-Way Quantum Finite Automata and Sublogarithmic-Space Quantum Turing Machines\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBy making use of two very powerful results in group theory, the Tits’ Alternative  and Gromov’s theorem on groups of polynomial growth , we exhibit useful lower bounds on DWGsubscript𝐷subscript𝑊𝐺D_{W_{G}}, which in turn allows us to show a strong lower bound on the expected running time of a 2QCFA that recognizes WGsubscript𝑊𝐺W_{G}. For any finitely generated group G𝐺G, the following statements hold.

If G𝐺G is a linear group over a field of characteristic 00, and G𝐺G is not virtually nilpotent, then WG∉𝖡𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠​(2o​(n))subscript𝑊𝐺𝖡𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠superscript2𝑜𝑛W_{G}\\not\\in\\mathsf{B2QCFA}(2^{o(n)}).

Follows immediately from Definition 27 and part (i) of this theorem. As a consequence of the famous Tits’ Alternative , every finitely generated linear group over a field of characteristic 00 either has polynomial growth or exponential growth, and has polynomial growth precisely when it is virtually nilpotent ([40, Corollary 1],). The claim then follows by part (ii) of this theorem. If WG∈𝖡𝖰𝖯𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠subscript𝑊𝐺𝖡𝖰𝖯𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠W_{G}\\in\\mathsf{BQP2QCFA}, then WG∈𝖡𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠​(k,d,nc,ϵ)subscript𝑊𝐺𝖡𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠𝑘𝑑superscript𝑛𝑐italic-ϵW_{G}\\in\\mathsf{B2QCFA}(k,d,n^{c},\\epsilon) for some k,d,c∈ℕ≥1,ϵ∈[0,12)formulae-sequence𝑘𝑑𝑐subscriptℕabsent1italic-ϵ012k,d,c\\in\\mathbb{N}_{\\geq 1},\\epsilon\\in[0,\\frac{1}{2}). By part (i) of this theorem, βG≺(n↦nc​k4​d2)precedessubscript𝛽𝐺maps-to𝑛superscript𝑛𝑐superscript𝑘4superscript𝑑2\\beta_{G}\\prec(n\\mapsto n^{ck^{4}d^{2}}), which implies G𝐺G has polynomial growth. By Gromov’s theorem on groups of polynomial growth , a finitely generated group has polynomial growth precisely when it is virtually nilpotent. ∎ All known G𝐺G of intermediate growth have βG∼(n↦enc)similar-tosubscript𝛽𝐺maps-to𝑛superscript𝑒superscript𝑛𝑐\\beta_{G}\\sim(n\\mapsto e^{n^{c}}), for some c∈(1/2,1)𝑐121c\\in(1/2,1). Therefore, a strong lower bound may be established on the running time of any 2QCFA that recognizes WGsubscript𝑊𝐺W_{G}, for any known group of intermediate growth. We also note that one may show that the conclusion of Theorem 28(iv) still holds even if WGsubscript𝑊𝐺W_{G} is only assumed to be recognized in slightly super-polynomial time. In particular, by a quantitative version of Gromov’s theorem due to Shalom and Tal [35, Corollary 1.10], ∃c∈ℝ>0𝑐subscriptℝabsent0\\exists c\\in\\mathbb{R}_{>0} such that if βG,S​(n)≤nc​(log⁡log⁡n)csubscript𝛽𝐺𝑆𝑛superscript𝑛𝑐superscript𝑛𝑐\\beta_{G,S}(n)\\leq n^{c(\\log\\log n)^{c}}, for some n>1/c𝑛1𝑐n>1/c, then G𝐺G is virtually nilpotent. Let 𝒢vAbsubscript𝒢vAb\\mathcal{G}_{\\textbf{vAb}} (resp. 𝒢vNilpsubscript𝒢vNilp\\mathcal{G}_{\\textbf{vNilp}}) denote the collection of all finitely generated virtually abelian (resp. nilpotent) groups. Let U⁡(k,ℚ¯)U𝑘¯ℚ\\operatorname{U}(k,\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}) denote the group of k×k𝑘𝑘k\\times k unitary matrices with algebraic number entries, and let 𝒰𝒰\\mathcal{U} consist of all finitely generated subgroups of any U⁡(k,ℚ¯)U𝑘¯ℚ\\operatorname{U}(k,\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}). We have recently shown that if G∈𝒰𝐺𝒰G\\in\\mathcal{U}, then WG∈𝖼𝗈𝖱𝖰𝖤𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠ℚ¯subscript𝑊𝐺subscript𝖼𝗈𝖱𝖰𝖤𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠¯ℚW_{G}\\in\\mathsf{coRQE2QCFA}_{\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}} [31, Corollary 1.4.1]. Observe that 𝒢vAb⊆𝒰subscript𝒢vAb𝒰\\mathcal{G}_{\\textbf{vAb}}\\subseteq\\mathcal{U} and that all groups in 𝒰𝒰\\mathcal{U} are finitely generated linear groups over a field of characteristic zero. Moreover, 𝒰∩𝒢vNilp=𝒢vAb𝒰subscript𝒢vNilpsubscript𝒢vAb\\mathcal{U}\\cap\\mathcal{G}_{\\textbf{vNilp}}=\\mathcal{G}_{\\textbf{vAb}} [39, Proposition 2.2]. We, therefore, obtain the following corollary of Theorem 28, which exhibits a broad and natural class of languages that a 2QCFA can recognize in exponential time, but not in subexponential time. ∀G∈𝒰∖𝒢vAbfor-all𝐺𝒰subscript𝒢vAb\\forall G\\in\\mathcal{U}\\setminus\\mathcal{G}_{\\textbf{vAb}}, we have WG∈𝖼𝗈𝖱𝖰𝖤𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠ℚ¯subscript𝑊𝐺subscript𝖼𝗈𝖱𝖰𝖤𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠¯ℚW_{G}\\in\\mathsf{coRQE2QCFA}_{\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}} but WG∉𝖡𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠​(2o​(n))subscript𝑊𝐺𝖡𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠superscript2𝑜𝑛W_{G}\\not\\in\\mathsf{B2QCFA}(2^{o(n)}).

By Theorem 28, if WG∈𝖡𝖰𝖯𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠subscript𝑊𝐺𝖡𝖰𝖯𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠W_{G}\\in\\mathsf{BQP2QCFA}, then G∈𝒢vNilp𝐺subscript𝒢vNilpG\\in\\mathcal{G}_{\\textbf{vNilp}}. This naturally raises the question of whether or not there is some G∈𝒢vNilp∖𝒢vAb𝐺subscript𝒢vNilpsubscript𝒢vAbG\\in\\mathcal{G}_{\\textbf{vNilp}}\\setminus\\mathcal{G}_{\\textbf{vAb}} such that WG∈𝖡𝖰𝖯𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠subscript𝑊𝐺𝖡𝖰𝖯𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠W_{G}\\in\\mathsf{BQP2QCFA}.

WHsubscript𝑊𝐻W_{H} is a natural choice for a potential “hard” word problem for 2QCFA, due to the lack of faithful finite-dimensional unitary representations of H𝐻H (see [ref]31 for further discussion). We next show that if WH∉𝖡𝖰𝖯𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠subscript𝑊𝐻𝖡𝖰𝖯𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠W_{H}\\not\\in\\mathsf{BQP2QCFA}, then we have a complete classification of those word problems recognizable by 2QCFA in polynomial time.

By the above discussion, it suffices to show the following claim: if WG∈𝖡𝖰𝖯𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠subscript𝑊𝐺𝖡𝖰𝖯𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠W_{G}\\in\\mathsf{BQP2QCFA}, for some G∈𝒢vNilp∖𝒢vAb𝐺subscript𝒢vNilpsubscript𝒢vAbG\\in\\mathcal{G}_{\\textbf{vNilp}}\\setminus\\mathcal{G}_{\\textbf{vAb}}, then WH∈𝖡𝖰𝖯𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠subscript𝑊𝐻𝖡𝖰𝖯𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠W_{H}\\in\\mathsf{BQP2QCFA}. Begin by noting that ∀G∈𝒢vNilp∖𝒢vAbfor-all𝐺subscript𝒢vNilpsubscript𝒢vAb\\forall G\\in\\mathcal{G}_{\\textbf{vNilp}}\\setminus\\mathcal{G}_{\\textbf{vAb}}, G𝐺G has a subgroup isomorphic to H𝐻H [20, Theorem 12].

Therefore, if WG∈𝖡𝖰𝖯𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠subscript𝑊𝐺𝖡𝖰𝖯𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠W_{G}\\in\\mathsf{BQP2QCFA}, then WH∈𝖡𝖰𝖯𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠subscript𝑊𝐻𝖡𝖰𝖯𝟤𝖰𝖢𝖥𝖠W_{H}\\in\\mathsf{BQP2QCFA} [20, Lemma 2].\n∎ We next obtain the following analogue of Theorem 28 for small-space QTMs. For any finitely generated group G𝐺G, the following statements hold. If G𝐺G has exponential growth, then WG∉𝖡𝖰𝖳𝖨𝖲𝖯​(2n1−Ω​(1),o​(log⁡n))subscript𝑊𝐺𝖡𝖰𝖳𝖨𝖲𝖯superscript2superscript𝑛1Ω1𝑜𝑛W_{G}\\not\\in\\mathsf{BQTISP}(2^{n^{1-\\Omega(1)}},o(\\log n)).

Follows immediately from Corollary 25 and Lemma 26. The claim follows from the Tits’ Alternative  and the first part of this theorem.
