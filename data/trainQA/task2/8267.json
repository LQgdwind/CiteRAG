      "content": "Paper Title: FairStream: Fair Multimedia Streaming Benchmark for Reinforcement Learning Agents\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMulti-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has been widely applied in the field of communication systems, as many control problems from this field can be framed as finding an optimal policy in a multi-agent system [ref]17.\nThese problems cover a variety of challenges from basic RL research.\nWe will briefly describe selected challenges in the following. Partial observability and multiple objectives are very common in communication systems and frequently considered by related works in that area.\nPartial observability is given when agents do not observe the full system state  and can be caused by a high overhead of network monitoring, the consideration of privacy, or a lack of trust between systems.\nAn agent has multiple objectives  if its overall goal consists of multiple, potentially conflicting, subgoals.\nAn example would be maximizing throughput while minimizing energy consumption. Related works in the area of communication networks  often combine multiple subgoals into a single reward function,\nbut seldom explore the solution space with respect to the individual objectives. Although related works consider increasingly complex and realistic system models, some fundamental challenges of real communication systems are still largely unexplored.\nIn particular, there is little related work that considers agent heterogeneity and asynchronicity.\nAgents are heterogeneous when they have different observation spaces, action spaces, reward functions, or roles .\nThis is the case whenever individual systems have different resource requirements, functionality, or goals  [ref]7.\nAsynchronicity is also very common in communication systems.\nDecisions are usually made asynchronously in an event-based manner, e.g., when a system receives a packet and has to make a routing decision.\nIn contrast, existing MARL environments and algorithms usually assume synchronous agents [ref]38.\nConsequently, approaches for communication systems often leverage single-agent RL methods which do not capture potential interactions between agents. Existing MARL environments for communication systems usually address a subset of these challenges.\nWhile the resulting assumptions allow to develop proficient solutions, they can hinder the transfer of the learned behavior to real communication systems. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap in the context of multimedia streaming and\npropose a cooperative multi-agent environment that comprises all of the aforementioned challenges.\nEach agent represents a streaming client that aims to maximize its own quality while considering fairness between all clients.\nBased on the well-established  Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) model , clients download multimedia content that is split into segments of short duration, store them in a buffer and then continuously play back the stored segments.\nAt each step, agents receive a partial observation that represents the network’s state and asynchronously select the quality level of the following segment.\nAgents have multiple objectives, as the perceived streaming quality and the fairness in terms of quality differences between individual devices are jointly optimized.\nIn our experiments, we consider four heterogeneous client types with different resource demands. Our contributions are as follows: Design of an environment for fair multimedia streaming, capturing the challenges associated with partial observability, agent asynchronicity, heterogeniety, and multiple objectives. Provisioning of a diverse benchmark suite to test single- and multi-agent RL algorithms under various network conditions. Evaluation of single-agent baseline approaches as a foundation for future research. Our implementation is available at \\hrefhttps://github.com/jw3il/fairstreamhttps://github.com/jw3il/fairstream.\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows.\nSec. 2 presents the scenario of heterogeneous multimedia streaming and outlines associated challenges.\nThe following Sec. 3 provides a formalization of the problem.\nSec. 4 introduces the streaming environment, including its configuration.\nThe experiments in Sec. 5 show how the environment allows to analyze the behavior of agents.\nWe discuss the results in Sec. 6.\nSec. 7 summarizes the related work and Sec. 8 concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: Learning (MARL) has been widely applied in the field of communication systems, as many control problems from this field can be framed as finding an optimal policy in a multi-agent system [ref]17.\nThese problems cover a variety of challenges from basic RL research.\nWe will briefly describe selected challenges in the following.
