      "content": "Paper Title: Structure learning in polynomial time: Greedy algorithms, Bregman information, and exponential families\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLearning the structure of a graphical model from data is a notoriously difficult combinatorial problem with numerous applications in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and causal inference as well as scientific disciplines such as genetics, medicine, and physics.\nOwing to its combinatorial structure, greedy algorithms have proved popular and efficient in practice. For undirected graphical models (e.g. Ising, Gaussian) in particular, strong statistical and computational guarantees exist for a variety of greedy algorithms  . These algorithms are based on the now well-known forward-backward greedy algorithm  , which has been applied to a range of problems beyond graphical models including regression , multi-task learning , and atomic norm regularization . Historically, the use of the basic forward-backward greedy scheme for learning directed acyclic graphical (DAG) models predates some of this work, dating back to the classical greedy equivalence search [GES, 13] algorithm. Since its introduction, GES has become a gold-standard for learning DAGs, and is known to be asymptotically consistent under certain assumptions such as faithfulness and score consistency  . Both of these assumptions are known to hold for certain parametric families [ref]21, however, extending GES to distribution-free settings has proven difficult. Furthermore, although GES is in practice extremely efficient and has been scaled up to large problem sizes 3, it lacks polynomial-time guarantees.\nAn important problem in this direction is the development of provably polynomial-time, consistent algorithms for DAG learning in general settings. In this paper, we revisit greedy algorithms for learning DAGs with an eye towards these issues. We propose a greedy algorithm for this problem—distinct from GES—and study its computational and statistical properties. In particular, it requires at most a polynomial number of score evaluations and provably recovers the correct DAG for properly chosen score functions. Furthermore, we illustrate its intimate relationship with existing order-based algorithms, providing a link between these existing approaches and classical score-based approaches. Along the way, we will see how the analysis itself suggests a family of score functions based on the Bregman information , which are well-defined without specific distributional assumptions. At a high-level, our goal is to understand what kind of finite-sample and complexity guarantees can be provided for greedy score-based algorithms in general settings. In doing so, we aim to provide deeper insight into the relationships between existing algorithms. Our main contributions can thus be outlined as follows: A generic greedy forward-backward scheme for optimizing score functions defined over DAGs. Unlike existing edge-greedy algorithms that greedily add or remove edges, our algorithm is vertex-greedy, i.e. it greedily adds vertices in a topological sort. We show how several existing order-based algorithms from the literature are special cases of this algorithm, for properly defined score functions. Thus, we bring these approaches back under the umbrella of score-based algorithms. We introduce a new family of score functions derived from the Bregman information, and analyze the sample and computational complexity of our greedy algorithm for this family of scores. We explore the optimization landscape of the resulting score functions, and provide evidence that not only does our algorithm provably recover the true DAG, it does so by globally optimizing a score function. The last claim is intriguing: It suggests that it is possible to globally optimize certain Bayesian network scores in polynomial-time. In other words, despite the well-known fact that global optimization of Bayesian networks scoring functions is NP-hard  , there may be natural assumptions under which these hardness results can be circumvented. This is precisely the case, for example, for undirected graphs: In general, learning Markov random fields is NP-hard 0, but special cases such as Gaussian graphical models   and Ising models 5   can be learned efficiently. Nonetheless, we emphasize that these results on global optimization of the score are merely empirical, and a proof of this fact beyond the linear case remains out of reach. The literature on BNSL is vast, so we focus this review on related work involving score-based and greedy algorithms. For a broad overview of BNSL algorithms, see the recent survey  or the textbooks  .\nThe current work is closely related to and inspired by generic greedy algorithms such as      .\nExisting greedy algorithms for score-based learning include\nGES ,\nhill climbing  1, and\nA* search 6.\nIn contrast to these greedy algorithms are global algorithms that are guaranteed to find a global optimum such as integer programming   and dynamic programming   .\nAnother family of order-based algorithms dating back to 1 centers around the idea of order search—i.e. first searching for a topological sort—from which the DAG structure is easily deduced; see also 4   5 .\nRecently, a series of order-based algorithms have led to significant breakthroughs, most notable of which are finite-sample and strong polynomial-time guarantees    8 . It will turn out that many of these algorithms are special cases of the greedy algorithm we propose; we revisit this interesting topic in Section 3.1.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: DAGs, and is known to be asymptotically consistent under certain assumptions such as faithfulness and score consistency  .
