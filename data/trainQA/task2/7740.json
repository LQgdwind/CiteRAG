      "content": "Paper Title: Context-Free Languages of String Diagrams\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBefore introducing context-free monoidal languages, we introduce the regular case, which shall play an important role in Section 6. Regular monoidal languages were introduced by Sobociński and the first author [ref]14 , following earlier work of Bossut and Heindel  . They are defined by a simple automaton model, reminiscent of tree automata. In a regular monoidal language, the alphabet is given by a finite polygraph. A non-deterministic monoidal automaton comprises:\na finite polygraph ΓΓ\\Gamma (the alphabet);\na finite set of states Q𝑄Q;\nfor each generator γ:n→m:𝛾→𝑛𝑚\\gamma:n\\to m in ΓΓ\\Gamma, a transition function Δγ:Qn→𝒫​(Qm):subscriptΔ𝛾→superscript𝑄𝑛𝒫superscript𝑄𝑚\\Delta_{\\gamma}:Q^{n}\\to\\mathscr{P}(Q^{m});\nand initial and final state vectors i,f∈Q∗𝑖𝑓superscript𝑄i,f\\in Q^{*}. Classical non-deterministic finite state automata arise as monoidal automata over single-sorted polygraphs in which every generator has arity and coarity 1.\nBottom-up regular tree automata  arise precisely from monoidal automata over single-sorted polygraphs in which every generator has coarity 111 and arbitrary arity, with initial state the empty word and final state a singleton. A finite state automaton over an alphabet ΣΣ\\Sigma accepts elements of the free monoid Σ∗superscriptΣ\\Sigma^{*}. A monoidal automaton over a polygraph ΓΓ\\Gamma accepts morphisms in the free monoidal category ℱ⊗​Γsubscriptℱtensor-productΓ\\mathcal{F}_{\\mathbin{\\mathchoice{\\vbox{\\hbox{$\\scriptstyle\\otimes$}}}{\\vbox{\\hbox{$\\scriptstyle\\otimes$}}}{\\vbox{\\hbox{$\\scriptscriptstyle\\otimes$}}}{\\vbox{\\hbox{$\\scriptscriptstyle\\otimes$}}}}}{\\Gamma} over ΓΓ\\Gamma. Let us see some examples before giving the formal definition of the accepted language. We depict the transitions of a monoidal automaton as elements of a polygraph with strings labelled by states, and generators labelled by the corresponding element of ΓΓ\\Gamma. Consider the following polygraph containing generators (left, below) for an opening and closing parenthesis, and the monoidal automaton over this polygraph with Q={S,M}𝑄𝑆𝑀Q=\\{S,M\\}, i=f=S𝑖𝑓𝑆i=f=S, and transitions shown below, centre. An accepting run over this automaton is shown below, right. The string diagram accepted by this run is what we obtain by erasing the states from this picture. It is clear that the language accepted by this automaton is exactly the “balanced parentheses”, but note that this is not a language of words, since we use an extra string to keep track of opening and closing parentheses. This principle will play an important role in our representation theorem in Section 6. Roughly speaking, this extra wire arises from the optical contour of a string language of balanced parentheses. In the field of DNA computing, Rothemund, Papadakis and Winfree demonstrated self-assembly of Sierpiński triangles from DNA tiles . Sobociński and the first author [ref]14 showed how to recast the tile model as a regular monoidal language over a polygraph containing two tile generators (white and grey), along with start and end generators, as in Figure 3. Note that the start (end) generators have arity (coarity) 0, and hence effect a transition from (to) the empty word of states. Transitions of a non-deterministic monoidal automaton over ΓΓ\\Gamma extend inductively to string diagrams in ℱ⊗​Γsubscriptℱtensor-productΓ\\mathcal{F}_{\\mathbin{\\mathchoice{\\vbox{\\hbox{$\\scriptstyle\\otimes$}}}{\\vbox{\\hbox{$\\scriptstyle\\otimes$}}}{\\vbox{\\hbox{$\\scriptscriptstyle\\otimes$}}}{\\vbox{\\hbox{$\\scriptscriptstyle\\otimes$}}}}}{\\Gamma}, giving functions δ^n,m:Qn×ℱ⊗​Γ​(n,m)→𝒫​(Qm):subscript^𝛿𝑛𝑚→superscript𝑄𝑛subscriptℱtensor-productΓ𝑛𝑚𝒫superscript𝑄𝑚\\hat{\\delta}_{n,m}:Q^{n}\\times\\mathcal{F}_{\\mathbin{\\mathchoice{\\vbox{\\hbox{$\\scriptstyle\\otimes$}}}{\\vbox{\\hbox{$\\scriptstyle\\otimes$}}}{\\vbox{\\hbox{$\\scriptscriptstyle\\otimes$}}}{\\vbox{\\hbox{$\\scriptscriptstyle\\otimes$}}}}}{\\Gamma}(n,m)\\to\\mathscr{P}(Q^{m}) (Definition F.2). A string diagram s:n→m:𝑠→𝑛𝑚s:n\\to m in the free monoidal category ℱ⊗​Γsubscriptℱtensor-productΓ\\mathcal{F}_{\\mathbin{\\mathchoice{\\vbox{\\hbox{$\\scriptstyle\\otimes$}}}{\\vbox{\\hbox{$\\scriptstyle\\otimes$}}}{\\vbox{\\hbox{$\\scriptscriptstyle\\otimes$}}}{\\vbox{\\hbox{$\\scriptscriptstyle\\otimes$}}}}}{\\Gamma} over ΓΓ\\Gamma is in the language of a non-deterministic monoidal automaton ({Δγ}γ∈Γ,i,f)subscriptsubscriptΔ𝛾𝛾Γ𝑖𝑓(\\{\\Delta_{\\gamma}\\}_{\\gamma\\in\\Gamma},i,f) if and only if f∈δ^n,m​(i,s)𝑓subscript^𝛿𝑛𝑚𝑖𝑠f\\in\\hat{\\delta}_{n,m}(i,s). A monoidal language L𝐿L is a regular monoidal language if and only if there exists a non-deterministic monoidal automaton accepting L𝐿L. The data of a monoidal automaton is a equivalent to a morphism of finite polygraphs, which we call a regular monoidal grammar, following Walters’  use of the term grammar when data is presented as fibered over an alphabet, and automata when the alphabet indexes transitions as in Definition 3.1. We shall use this convenient presentation in the following. A regular monoidal grammar is a morphism of finite polygraphs ψ:ℚ→Γ:𝜓→ℚΓ\\psi:\\mathbb{Q}\\to\\Gamma, equipped with finite initial and final sorts i,f∈Sℚ∗𝑖𝑓superscriptsubscript𝑆ℚi,f\\in S_{\\mathbb{Q}}^{*}. The morphisms in ℱ⊗​ℚ​(i,f)subscriptℱtensor-productℚ𝑖𝑓\\mathcal{F}_{\\mathbin{\\mathchoice{\\vbox{\\hbox{$\\scriptstyle\\otimes$}}}{\\vbox{\\hbox{$\\scriptstyle\\otimes$}}}{\\vbox{\\hbox{$\\scriptscriptstyle\\otimes$}}}{\\vbox{\\hbox{$\\scriptscriptstyle\\otimes$}}}}}{\\mathbb{Q}}(i,f) are derivations in the grammar, and their image under the free monoidal functor ℱ⊗​ψsubscriptℱtensor-product𝜓\\mathcal{F}_{\\mathbin{\\mathchoice{\\vbox{\\hbox{$\\scriptstyle\\otimes$}}}{\\vbox{\\hbox{$\\scriptstyle\\otimes$}}}{\\vbox{\\hbox{$\\scriptscriptstyle\\otimes$}}}{\\vbox{\\hbox{$\\scriptscriptstyle\\otimes$}}}}}{\\psi} gives the language of the grammar; a subset of morphisms in ℱ⊗​Γsubscriptℱtensor-productΓ\\mathcal{F}_{\\mathbin{\\mathchoice{\\vbox{\\hbox{$\\scriptstyle\\otimes$}}}{\\vbox{\\hbox{$\\scriptstyle\\otimes$}}}{\\vbox{\\hbox{$\\scriptscriptstyle\\otimes$}}}{\\vbox{\\hbox{$\\scriptscriptstyle\\otimes$}}}}}{\\Gamma}. For every non-deterministic monoidal automaton there is a regular monoidal grammar with the same language, and vice-versa. Not every monoidal language is a regular monoidal language. The following is an example. Let ΓΓ\\Gamma be the polygraph containing two generators: one for “over-braiding”  and one for “under-braiding” . The language of unbraids on two strings over ΓΓ\\Gamma, i.e. diagrams equivalent under planar isotopy to untangled strings, is not a regular monoidal language. We can use the pumping lemma for regular monoidal languages (Lemma B.1), with k=2𝑘2k=2. The argument is analogous to that for classical languages of balanced parentheses: every over-braiding or under-braiding must be eventually balanced with its opposite. In the next section, we introduce context-free monoidal languages and we shall see that unbraids fall in this class. In Section 6 we prove a surprising representation theorem: every context-free monoidal language is the image under a monoidal functor of a regular monoidal language. There is a minor difference between the definition of regular monoidal languages above, and those originally defined by Sobociński and the first author [ref]14, which were restricted to languages of scalar morphisms. In later work , initial and final state finite languages were introduced. Bossut, Dauchet and Warin  allow these to be regular languages; however, our applications require no more than a single initial and final word. As defined, regular monoidal languages are subsets of free strict monoidal categories: we shall need only this case in order to prove our main theorem. Context-free monoidal languages will be defined over arbitrary strict monoidal categories, so this raises the question of extending the regular case to monoidal categories that are not free. We suggest this can be done by a generalization of Melliès and Zeilberger’s definition of finite-state automata over a category as finitary unique lifting of factorizations functors [34, Section 2].\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: context-free monoidal languages, we introduce the regular case, which shall play an important role in Section 6.
