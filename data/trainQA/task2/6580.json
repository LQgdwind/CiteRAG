      "content": "Paper Title: Feature Activation Map: Visual Explanation of Deep Learning Models for Image Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\na) Models and Implementation Details:¬†Five most widely used deep learning backbone models in few-shot image classification, Conv4Net 2, Conv64F , ResNet12 , ResNet18 , and WideResNet28  are selected as CNN models for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed FAM algorithm. Global Average Pooling (GAP) is used to embed the feature maps into feature vectors. All models for few-shot image classification use LeakyReLU (slope=0.1)  as the activation function. We train the five CNN models using the same episodic training strategy as 6, including data pre-processing strategy, learning rate adjustment rule and optimizer choice. It is worth noting that we use a multi-task learning scheme  to make models focus on the target objects. For validation and testing sets, all images are resized into 84√ó84 pixels and all pixels are scaled into the range  , and then they are normalized by using mean [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and standard deviation [0.229, 0.224, 0225]. No further data augmentation technique is applied. Following 5-way K-shot setting, the episode is formed with 5 classes and each class includes K support samples, and 6 and 15 query images are randomly selected for training and inference respectively. During inference, 2,000 episodes are randomly sampled, we apply the proposed FAM algorithm to the five trained CNN models that perform few-shot image classification on the testing set, K is set to 1. The quantitative analyses and qualitative visualizations are performed on the correct predictions. We report the average values of classification accuracy and 95%percent\\% confidence interval over the 2000 episodes. b) Quantitative and Qualitative Evaluations:¬†\nQuantitative analysis includes localization capacity evaluation and faithfulness evaluation. The localization capacity shows how precisely the explanation map can find the discriminative regions on input images. The metrics to measure localization capacity include energy-based point game proportion 2 5 and intersection over union (IoU) [ref]6  . Energy-based point game proportion shows how much energy of the explanation map falls into the bounding box of the target object. It can be formulated as follow, where ‚àß\\land denotes the size of the original image XùëãX, bbox represents the ground truth bounding box, and (i,j)ùëñùëó(i,j) denotes the location of a pixel. Intersection over union (IoU) involves the estimated bounding box. To generate an estimated bounding box from the proposed FAM algorithm, following [ref]6  , a simple threshold technique is used to segment the saliency map. We first binarize the saliency map with the threshold of the max value of saliency map. Second a bounding box is drawn, which covers the largest connected segments of pixels. IoU is calculated by the following, where bboxesubscriptbboxùëí\\text{bbox}_{e} denotes the estimated bounding box while bboxgsubscriptbboxùëî\\text{bbox}_{g} denotes the ground truth bounding box. Following [ref]6, the threshold is set to 0.2 in our experiments. Both metrics are adopted to assess the localization capacity of the proposed FAM algorithm. The annotated bounding boxes provided by CUB-200-2011 dataset are used as ground-truth labels. During inference, we compute IoU and proportion for a query image that is correctly classified. For every episode, we calculate the average IoU and proportion of all correct classifications as well as accuracy per episode. The means of 2,000 episodes of average IoU and proportion are listed in Table¬†I. The results in Table¬†I show that ResNet-based models have better localization capacity than Conv64F or Conv4Net. The faithfulness measures how important the regions that the explanation map highlights will be. Therefore, the faithfulness evaluation has been widely performed for interpretable visualization methods   2 3 5. Following  2 3 5, average drop (AD) and increase in confidence (IC) are chosen as the faithfulness metrics to evaluate the faithfulness of the proposed FAM method. Both metrics are defined as the following, and where sisubscriptùë†ùëñs_{i} denotes the similarity score between the iùëñi-th query image and the corresponding support image and si‚Ä≤subscriptsuperscriptùë†‚Ä≤ùëñs^{\\prime}_{i} denote the similarity score between the iùëñi-the query image masked by the saliency map and the same support image. NùëÅN indicates the number of query images per episode. We calculate the means of AD and IC for 2,000 episodes, which are listed in Table¬†II. Table¬†II shows that ResNet-based models have a better performance in most cases except the IC on Conv4Net, where Conv4Net outperforms ResNet12 and WideResNet28. For qualitative visualization, we randomly select four episodes from the testing set by using the python function ‚Äùenumerate (dataloader)‚Äù. The proposed FAM algorithm is used to generate the explanation maps on the images, for which the five few-shot models consistently make the correct classification. Fig.¬†2 shows examples of FAM visualization (more samples are shown in the appendix). The head of Fig.¬†2 also displays the classification accuracies. It can be observed that with the improvement of the classification accuracy column by column from left to right, the regions highlighted by FAM look more focused on targeted objects in accordance with human observation.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: the explanation map can find the discriminative regions on input images.
