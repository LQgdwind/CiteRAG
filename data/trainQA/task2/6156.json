      "content": "Paper Title: SuSana Distancia is all you need: Enforcing class separability in metric learning via two novel distance-based loss functions for few-shot image classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe goal of metric learning is to learn a similarity function from the data. More specifically, it aims to learn feature embeddings in a way that reduces the distance between embeddings corresponding to instances of the same class (intra-class distance) and increases the distance between embeddings corresponding to instances of different classes (inter-class distance). The vast majority of deep metric learning (DML) approaches make use of an embedding network to learn the discriminating features that will be exploited for computing the similarity metric. Below, we review some of the more relevant deep metric learning methods in the recent literature. One of the fundamental methods in DML is the Siamese Networks (), which is a symmetric neural network architecture that consists of two sub-networks, both sharing the same parameters. These networks learn their parameters by calculating a distance metric between the feature embeddings of each sub-network, which are fed a different input. The loss function used in Siamese Networks is the contrastive loss or pairwise ranking loss, which seeks for the distance of samples from the same class to be small and from different classes to be large. The second important metric learning method is the Triplet Network (5), whose underlying architecture can also be described by a symmetric neural network. However, this method makes use of three identical sub-networks sharing the same parameters. The input of the three sub-networks is encompassed by three different images: The first one is the anchor (the baseline image), the second is the positive sample (an instance that belongs to the same class as the anchor), and the third is the negative sample (an instance that belongs to a different class than the anchor). This network uses the triplet loss to learn discriminative feature embeddings, and it works by ensuring that the anchor image is close to the positive images and far away from the negative images. These metric learning methods have been widely used for different purposes, such as image retrieval (), face recognition (5 9 ), person re-identification (), video surveillance (), three-dimensional modelling ([ref]10), signature verification (), medical image analysis (), text understanding (8 ), among other problems.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: learning methods have been widely used for different purposes, such as image retrieval (), face recognition (5 9 ), person re-identification (), video surveillance (), three-dimensional modelling ([ref]10), signature verification (), medical image analysis (), text understanding (8 ), among other problems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
