      "content": "Paper Title: Ternary Compression for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo evaluate the performance of the proposed network quantization and ternary protocol in federated learning systems, we first conduct experiments with five independent physical clients connected by a Local Area Network (LAN). The physical system consists of one CPU laptop and five GPU workstations that are connected wirelessly through LAN, the CPU laptop acts as the server to aggregate local models and the remaining GPU workstations act as clients participating in the federated training. Each client only communicates with the server and there is no information exchange between the clients. For simulations, we typically use 100 clients for experiments. A detailed description of the configuration is given below. 1) Compared algorithms. In this work, we compare the following algorithms: Baseline: the centralized learning algorithm, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method, which means that all data is stored in a single computing center and the model is trained directly using the entire data. FedAvg: the canonical federated learning approach presented in . CMFL: a communication-mitigated federated learning algorithm proposed in . T-FedAvg: our proposed quantized federated learning approach. Note that the first and last feature layers of the global and local models are full-precision. 2) Datasets. We select two representative benchmark datasets that are widely used for classification. MNIST : it contains 60,000 training and 10,000 testing gray-scale handwritten image samples with 10 classes, where the dimension of each image is 28√ó\\times28. Since the features of MNIST are easily extracted, this data set is mainly used to train small networks. Since it is relatively simple to extract features from MNIST, no data augmentation method is used in this set of experiments. CIFAR10 [ref]45: it contains 60,000 colored images of 10 types of objects from frogs to planes, 50,000 for training and 10,000 for testing. It is a widely used benchmark data set that is difficult to extract features. Random cropping and horizontal random flipping are chosen for data augmentation. Three color channels are normalized with the mean and standard deviation of Œºrsubscriptùúáùëü\\mu_{r} = 0.4914, Œ¥rsubscriptùõøùëü\\delta_{r} = 0.247, Œºgsubscriptùúáùëî\\mu_{g} = 0.4824, Œ¥gsubscriptùõøùëî\\delta_{g} = 0.244, and Œºbsubscriptùúáùëè\\mu_{b} = 0.4467, Œ¥bsubscriptùõøùëè\\delta_{b} = 0.262, respectively, as recommended in [ref]53. 2) Models. To evaluate the performance of above algorithms, three deep learning models are selected: MLP, CNN and ResNet‚àó, which represent three popular neural network models. The detailed setting are as follows: MLP is meant for training small data sets, e.g., MNIST. The model contains two hidden layers with the number of neurons of 30 and 20 without bias, ReLU is selected as the activation function. The size of the first and last layer is 784 and 10. Note that the pre-trained weights of the first layer do not need to transmitted to the server, which can reduce the order of magnitude of the communication volume, since the number of neurons in this layer is much more than other layers. CNN is a shallow convolutional neural network, which consists of five convolutional layers and three fully connected layers. The first convolutional layer uses the ReLU function, while the remaining ones are followed by a batch normalization layer, a ReLU function, and a max pooling layer. ResNet18‚àó is a simplified version of the widely used ResNet , where the number of input and output channels for all convolutional layers is reduced to 64. It is a typical benchmark model for evaluating the performance of algorithms on large data sets. 3) Data distribution. The performance of federated learning is affected by the features of training data stored on the separated clients. To investigate the impact of different data distributions, several types of data are generated: IID data: each client holds an IID subset of data containing 10 classes, thus having an IID-subset of the data. Non-IID data: the union of the samples in all clients is the entire dataset, but the number of classes contained in each client is not equal to the total number of categories in the entire dataset (10 for MNIST and CIFAR10). We can use the label to assign samples of NcsubscriptùëÅùëêN_{c} classes to each client, where NcsubscriptùëÅùëêN_{c} is the number of classes per client. In case of extremely non-IID data, NcsubscriptùëÅùëêN_{c} is equal to 1 for each client, but this case is generally not considered since there is no need to train (e.g., classification) if only one class is stored on each client. Unbalancedness in data size: typically, the size of the datasets on different clients varies a lot. To investigate the influence of the unbalancedness in data size in the federated learning environment, we split the entire dataset into several distinct parts. 3) Basic configuration. The basic configuration of the federated learning system in our experiments is set as follows: Total number of clients: NùëÅN = 100 for MNIST with simulation, and NùëÅN = 5 for CIFAR10 (as suggested in [ref]53) using the physical system. The participation ratio per round: ŒªùúÜ\\lambda = 0.1 for MNIST and ŒªùúÜ\\lambda = 1 for CIFAR10. Classes per client: NcsubscriptùëÅùëêN_{c} = 10. Local epochs: Eùê∏E = 5 for MNIST, and Eùê∏E = 10 for CIFAR10. The batch size is fixed to 64 and the same learning rate is used for both the centralized and federated algorithms with an exponential decay (with a rate is 0.95) for every five communication rounds in all CIFAR-10 experiments, as suggested in [ref]50. The number of samples per client is equal to the size of the dataset divided by NùëÅN. For a fair comparison, we assess the performance of each compared algorithm after 100 iterations of training with the same amount of training samples, which is averaged over five independent runs. Take MNIST as an example, there are 100 clients, each client has 600 samples, and 100 rounds are run for federated learning. Correspondingly, 60,000 samples are used to train the centralized methods for 100 epochs. It should be pointed out that since the participating ratio ŒªùúÜ\\lambda is less than or equal to 1, the number of used training samples in federated learning is always smaller than that used in centralized learning. The hyperparameters and test results obtained by the baseline models are summarized in Table I.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: extracted, this data set is mainly used to train small networks.
