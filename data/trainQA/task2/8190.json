      "content": "Paper Title: Biases in gendered citation practices: an exploratory study and some reflections on the Matthew and Matilda effects\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe scope of studies on citation biases ranges from focusing on top journals within specific fields to broader, global analyses. The citation biases identified in these studies focus on gender, race, geographic origin, and positive results across disciplines such as neuroscience, physics, economics, and cardiology. In this section, we classify these studies based on the attributes they target.\n\nGender: Wu  surveyed research focusing on the links between\ngender and citations. Several studies (e.g., [ref]1           [ref]47) highlighted persistent gender citation biases. These studies usually concluded that, despite an increase in women authorship, women-authored papers continue to receive fewer citations than men-authored papers. For instance, in economics, Ferber and Brun  found that male-only papers receive more citations than female-only or mixed-gender authored papers. Teich et al.  reported similar trends in physics, with male-authored papers being over-cited and women-authored papers under-cited, varying by sub field and proximity. Larivière et al. [ref]1 found that women in prominent author positions (sole, first and last) attracted fewer citations and consistently had more domestic portfolios with fewer international collaborations than men. Dworkin et al.  showed that although women’s representation increased in neuroscience, citation disparities persisted. Fulvio et al.  found that male-authored papers were still over-cited in cognitive neuroscience despite an increase in women-authored papers.\n\nRace: The citation analysis Liu et al.  performed allowed them to conclude that papers authored by Black and Hispanic scientists are signiﬁcantly less cited compared to the ones authored by White and API (Asian and Paciﬁc Islander) scientists on similar topics. They observed that citational distortion accross several disciplines (e.g., engineering and computer science, physics and mathematics).\n\nIntersection of Race and Gender: Bertolero et al.  extended the work of Dworkin et al.  to identify racial biases in neuroscience and explore the impact the intersection of gender and race has on citation practices. They found that authors of colour are increasingly under-cited, primarily by white authors, black women being the most affected. They concluded citation bias is most pronounced within racially segregated co-authorship networks, with white men receiving the most citations.\n\nGeographic Origin: Pasterkamp et al.  and Gomez et al.  identified biases favouring well-resourced countries. Pasterkamp et al.  found that in cardiology, citations primarily came from the USA and the recipient’s own country, with a significant portion originating from the same institution. Gomez et al.  found that across 150 fields, research from highly active countries (e.g., USA, Western Europe, East Asia) is prioritized, while work from peripheral countries is overlooked. They concluded that the gap between core and peripheral countries is widening, especially in fields like physical sciences and engineering.\n\nPositive Results: Duyx et al.  determined that citation patterns favour positive results, particularly in biomedical sciences. They found that articles with significant results were cited 1.6 times more often, and articles which supported a researcher’s hypothesis were cited 2.7 times more frequently. Positive articles receive about twice the citations of negative ones, influenced more by conclusions than data. Journal impact factor also affects citation rates as high-impact journals usually publish positive results and, thus, receive more citations .\n\nThese studies underscore the systemic biases in citation practices, impacting the recognition and dissemination of scientific contributions across various demographics and regions. However, Ray et al.  found no peer-reviewed studies documenting racial or ethnic biases in citation practices within biology, medicine, chemistry, physics, or other natural sciences. Still, Liu et al. ’s recent study helps fill that gap.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: cardiology. In this section, we classify these studies based on the attributes they target.\n\nGender: Wu  surveyed research focusing on the links between\ngender and citations. Several studies (e.g., [ref]1           [ref]47) highlighted persistent gender citation biases. These studies usually concluded that, despite an increase in women authorship, women-authored papers continue to receive fewer\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
