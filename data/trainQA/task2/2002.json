      "content": "Paper Title: Classifying concepts via visual properties\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConcepts are a foundational notion for any theory of mind, no matter whether these theories are more theoretically oriented (as in, e.g., the Philosophy of Mind, Lexical Semantics), or more application oriented, (as in, e.g., Information Systems, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Computational Linguistics). As of to day, it is somehow universally accepted that concepts are mental representations of substances, as they occur in the world, but what these representations are, what they are for, and how many of them exist, these are all questions for which there is no uniform view.\nSo far, the mainstream approach, mainly but not only, in the application oriented work, has been to model concepts as classes, which in turn are populated by instances. This approach was termed Descriptionism in  to emphasize the fact that, in this work, the main goal is to describe what is the case in the world, this description being instrumental to the intended (specific) use of concepts, i.e., that of providing an account of and also implementing phenomena such as knowledge acquisition and representation, reasoning, natural language processing and classification. In earlier work , the authors propose a complementary view, building upon some recent results in the field of Teleosemantics , previously called Biosemantics , and in particular of the work of Ruth Millikan   . In this work, concepts are seen as (etiological) functions. Here, the notion of etiological function must be read as meaning ‘intended for’ or ‘devised for’ with respect to a referent device , this notion being adapted from the notion of biological causation. To exemplify, the occipital lobe of our brain is devised for visual perception, where the occipital lobe is the referent device ‘intended to’ perform the function of vision.\nAs from , this view allows us to distinguish between two types of concepts, as follows: substance concepts, namely mental representations which support the recognition of what is the case in the world,111We restrict therefore ourselves to substances which can be perceived, e.g., objects. and classification concepts, namely mental representations which support the classification of what has been recognized as substance concepts, classification being the key activity which allows to talk and reason about substance concepts. Classification concepts capture the Descriptionistic view of concepts as classes. The more novel notion of substance concepts has been successfully tested in the development of a system capable of performing human-like object recognition 0 1. Notice that we assume the existence of two types of concepts, where substance concepts and classification concepts perform different functions and are built following independent processes.222It is worth noticing how, according to the work in Neuroscience, the brain actually holds multiple representations of the world (at least one per sense)  [ref]9. The problem which arises is how to make sure that, given a certain substance in the real world, its substance concept and classification concept mental representations both encode the substance itself. The work in 0 1 provides a general solution to this problem by ensuring that: (i) there is one-to-one correspondence between the two types of concepts; (ii) substance concepts are organized into hierarchy based on Genus-Differentia intensional definitions, as it is usually the case in Lexical Semantics 2 3, and (iii) the one-to-one mapping is actually correct in the sense that the selected classification concept properly names and describes the substance been perceived. The goal in this paper is to provide a general methodology for building such an integrated hierarchy of classification and substance concepts. The ultimate goal is to use the proposed methodology to develop a lexico-semantic hierarchy where classification concepts are annotated with media, e.g., photos or videos, representing the corresponding substance concepts. The approach we propose is based on Ranganathan’s faceted methodology for building conceptual hierarchies 4.\nThe main novelty is that, contrarily to what has been the case so far, see, e.g., all the work in the construction of lexico-semantic hierarchies 3 5, the hierarchies are built based on the visual properties of substance concepts, rather than by exploiting the linguistically defined properties of classification concepts. The properties of classification concepts are only used to describe substances, as perceptually represented by substance concepts and, accordingly, organized in hierarchies. This fact, in turn enables the definition of a very compelling set of rules which allow for the construction of high quality classification hierarchies which at the same time encode the visual properties of substances, as well as their linguistically defined properties, thus being amenable for multi-media classification. The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we provide a short synthesis of the teleological view of substance and classification concepts. In Section 3 we introduce Ranganathan’s faceted view of concepts. Here we also show how Ranganathan’s approach naturally maps to the proposed etiological view of concepts. In Section 4 we introduce a set of canons, adapted from Ranganathan’s faceted approach, which prescribe how to build high quality hierarchies. In Section 5 we provide some insights about how the ideas presented in this paper can be exploited in the construction of a multi-media lexico-semantic hierarchy. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: are built following independent processes.222It is worth noticing how, according to the work in Neuroscience, the brain actually holds multiple representations of the world (at least one per sense)  [ref]9.
