      "content": "Paper Title: A deep inverse reinforcement learning approach to route choice modeling with context-dependent rewards\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nParallel to the development of recursive logit models, IRL has emerged as a general yet powerful framework to model sequential decision processes (e.g. routing) over the past two decades. While the goal of reinforcement learning (RL) is to learn a decision process to produce behavior that maximizes some predefined reward function, IRL inverts the problem and aims to extract a reward function from demonstration data that explains observed human behavior  . The reward function is usually specified by a number of features, and the learnt parameters describe human preferences, which is similar to the utility function in DCMs. IRL is closely connected to imitation learning (IL), only with different learning objectives. While IRL aims to recover the reward function, IL focuses on directly learning the optimal policy from the data. As the original IRL is prone to noise and often ambiguous, [ref]43 proposed the maximum entropy IRL (MaxEntIRL), which employs the principle of maximum entropy to resolve the ambiguity in choosing a distribution over decisions. In fact, it has been shown to share many similarities with the recursive logit, as both can model route choices as a sequence of link choices, assume linear reward/utility functions and can estimate a probability distribution over all feasible paths  7. One key difference is that MaxEntIRL computes all path probabilities through value iteration, while the recursive logit estimates the value functions by solving a system of linear equations 0 . The former is less efficient in larger and more complex networks, and the latter is generally incompatible with nonlinear model structures. Recent years have seen growing interest in the use of deep architectures for reward function approximation in RL/IRL .  extended the MaxEntIRL approach with DNNs, and it has been adapted for delivery route planning  or recommendation , though value iteration is still required. An alternative approach, Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL), was proposed to combine the core idea of IRL with the generative adversarial framework 5. Although it has been applied to taxi driver strategy learning  and synthetic trajectory generation , GAIL is still an IL approach, and cannot estimate specific reward functions or reveal routing preferences. More recently, a similar adversarial architecture was adopted in Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (AIRL), which is able to recover reward functions in large, high-dimensional problems 2. Specifically for route choice analysis, such DNN-based IRL/IL methods have yet to be explored.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: learning objectives.
