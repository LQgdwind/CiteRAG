      "content": "Paper Title: FP6-LLM: Efficiently Serving Large Language Models Through FP6-Centric Algorithm-System Co-Design\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n8-bit  [ref]38 and 4-bit quantization   2 are the most widely applied schemes for the current post-training LLMs.\nHowever, recent algorithmic research [ref]35  has demonstrated that superior trade-offs between inference cost and model quality can be achieved with FP6 quantization, compared to 8-bit and 4-bit quantization. (I) Lower inference cost than 8-bit quantization.\nCompared to the 8-bit quantization, the cost of deploying LLMs can be further reduced through more aggressive 6-bit quantization without a visible accuracy drop.\nOn one hand, the size of LLM weights can be significantly reduced, nearly 2.7×2.7\\times smaller than the FP16 baseline.\nLess GPU memory is required to store model weights, thereby requiring fewer GPUs and reducing the serving cost of deploying LLMs.\nOn the other hand, 6-bit quantization can also more effectively accelerate the inference of LLMs.\nGiven that the LLM inference is usually memory-bounded222When the execution is memory-bounded, it means that the rate at which data is transferred to or from the GPU’s memory is the bottleneck, rather than the computational capabilities of the GPU cores. during token generation, faster LLM inference can be achieved through reducing GPU DRAM access of the model weights.\nAs shown in Figure 1, the execution of the linear layer within llama-65b model [ref]32 is consistently faster (up to 1.42×1.42\\times faster) with our newly proposed 6-bit quantization system design (TC-FPx_W6A16) compared to the state-of-the-art 8-bit quantization support (TensorRT-LLM_W8A16 ).\nGiven that linear layers are the most time-consuming part of the large language models, this speedup will directly translate to performance improvements for end-to-end inference scenarios (See Section 7.3). (II) Better model quality than 4-bit quantization.\nAlthough 4-bit quantization more aggressively reduces memory footprint and DRAM access, it unavoidably causes degradation in model quality.\nIn contrast, near-lossless model compression can be achieved with 6-bit quantization.\nAs shown in Table 1 and Table 2, FP6 displays strong and consistent performance across various tasks including code generation and zero-shot perplexity performance. It also shows high robustness across various model sizes, e.g., 1B, 13B, and 65B LLaMA [ref]32 models.\nWe also find that INT4 quantization heavily relies on Fine-Grained Quantization (FGQ) methods to maintain high model quality, whereas our FP6 quantization already works well on coarse-grained quantization.\nNote that the data points in Table 1 and Table 2 are picked from [ref]35. For more details, please refer to this paper.\nIn conclusion, at algorithmic level, FP6 quantization is a practical alternative to further democratize the deployment of LLMs without significantly sacrificing model quality on complex tasks and various model sizes.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: 8-bit  [ref]38 and 4-bit quantization   2 are the most widely applied schemes for the current post-training LLMs.\nHowever, recent algorithmic research [ref]35  has demonstrated that superior trade-offs\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
