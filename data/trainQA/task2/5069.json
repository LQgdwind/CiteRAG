      "content": "Paper Title: Interacting Hand-Object Pose Estimation via Dense Mutual Attention\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets. We evaluate our methods on two large-scale hand-object benchmarks: HO3D v2  and DexYCB , each containing 66K and 589K images of human interacting YCB [ref]2 objects. We train the model separately on each dataset based on the official train-test split, in particular, we use the default S0 split for the DexYCB testing set. For a fair comparison in the DexYCB dataset, we follow  to select input frames where the hand and object are both visible with an in-between distance less than 1‚Äãc‚Äãm1ùëêùëö1cm to ensure a physical contact can be established. We crop the input images in both datasets using the provided hand-object bounding box following [ref]26 and resize all images into 256√ó256256256256\\times 256 pixels.\n Data Augmentation. Considering that the HO3D dataset is relatively small-scale, to facilitate the training we perform two types of augmentation, i.e. view synthesis to resolve occlusion ambiguity and grasp synthesis to increase the diversity of hand-object interaction. For view synthesis, we randomly rotate the camera relative to the object center. We additionally generate 5K distinct hand manipulating YCB objects scenes using the GrabNet 9 to perform grasp synthesis. We manually verify that the synthesized poses are not seen in the testing set and are physically plausible by empirically filtering out samples with the contact loss and penetration loss  greater than the threshold Œªc=0.012subscriptùúÜùëê0.012\\lambda_{c}=0.012 and Œªp=0.1subscriptùúÜùëù0.1\\lambda_{p}=0.1 respectively. We use Pytorch3D 4 to render the synthetic image counterparts from the augmented poses. We adopt the HTML 2 model for realistic hand skin colors and textures, and superimpose the rendered hand-object images on top of randomly sampled backgrounds from the indoor-scene dataset 3.\nTo reduce the domain gap, we further perform photometric augmentation on rendered images, including random contrast and brightness transforms uniformly sampled from [0.5, 1.5]. In addition, we add random Gaussian blurs on synthetic images with œÉùúé\\sigma uniformly sampled from [0.1, 1].\nThe three types of inputs, i.e. real, view-synthetic, and grasp-synthetic images are distributed in 0.45: 0.45: 0.1 in a training batch for the HO3D training set. Compared with [ref]26, we introduce the data augmentation mostly with a simple view transformation, however, our model achieves better performance with less augmented grasping data as shown in Section 4.4.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Datasets.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
