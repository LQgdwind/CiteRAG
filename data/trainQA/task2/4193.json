      "content": "Paper Title: DNA: Proximal Policy Optimization with a Dual Network Architecture\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo evaluate our algorithm’s performance, we used the Atari-5 benchmark . Scores in Atari-5 are generated using a weighted geometric average over five specific games and produce results that correlate well with the median score if all 57-games had been evaluated. This allowed us to perform multiple seeded runs and defined a clear training and test split between the games. In all cases, we fit hyperparameters to the 3-game validation set and only used the 5-game test set for final evaluations. We opted for the more difficult stochastic ALE settings recommended as best practice by 2. However, to better understand our results in the context of prior work, we also provide results under the simpler deterministic settings in Appendix F, and additionally provide for reference a single evaluation on the full 57-game set in Appendix M. Unless otherwise specified, agents were scored according to their average performance over the previously completed 100-episodes at the end of training. A coarse hyperparameter sweep found initial hyperparameters for our model on the Atari-3 validation set. Notably, we found the optimal mini-batch size for value and distillation to be the minimum tested (256), while the optimal mini-batch size for policy was the largest tested (2048). For optimization, we used Adam 1, over the standard 200 million frames.131313That is 50 million environment interactions. Full hyperparameter details for our experiments are given in Appendix B. In order to understand the impact of the hyperparameters introduced by our algorithm, namely Eπ,EV,EDsubscript𝐸𝜋subscript𝐸𝑉subscript𝐸𝐷E_{\\pi},E_{V},E_{D} and λπ,λVsubscript𝜆𝜋subscript𝜆𝑉\\lambda_{\\pi},\\lambda_{V}, we performed the following experiments on the Atari-3 validation set. We started by setting Eπ=EV=ED=2subscript𝐸𝜋subscript𝐸𝑉subscript𝐸𝐷2E_{\\pi}=E_{V}=E_{D}=2, then searched over EV∈[ref]1  [ref]3 subscript𝐸𝑉1234E_{V}\\in[ref]1  [ref]3 , and selected the best EVsubscript𝐸𝑉E_{V}. We then searched over Eπsubscript𝐸𝜋E_{\\pi} and EDsubscript𝐸𝐷E_{D} while keeping the other two parameters constant. We also performed a similar experiment on the impact of λVsubscript𝜆𝑉\\lambda_{V} and λπsubscript𝜆𝜋\\lambda_{\\pi} by setting λVsubscript𝜆𝑉\\lambda_{V} to 0.95 then sweeping across λπ∈[0.6,0.8,0.9,0.95,0.975]subscript𝜆𝜋0.60.80.90.950.975\\lambda_{\\pi}\\in[0.6,0.8,0.9,0.95,0.975], then setting λVsubscript𝜆𝑉\\lambda_{V} to the best λπsubscript𝜆𝜋\\lambda_{\\pi} and repeating. This process allowed us to verify if the best settings occur at λV=λπsubscript𝜆𝑉subscript𝜆𝜋\\lambda_{V}=\\lambda_{\\pi} or at λV≠λπsubscript𝜆𝑉subscript𝜆𝜋\\lambda_{V}\\neq\\lambda_{\\pi}. During our λ𝜆\\lambda tuning, we also recorded noise levels for one of the seeds, the results of which we discuss in Section 6.2. We evaluated our algorithm DNA, against PPO, and PPG. All models used the ‘NatureCNN’ encoder from 5. However, because DNA and PPG use two networks and thus twice the parameters, we doubled the number of channels of the PPO encoder which we refer to as PPO (2x) and which is very similar to the encoder used by . All models have have approximately 3.5 million parameters in total. For fairness we repeated the same sweep on PPO for the number of training epochs (EPPOsubscript𝐸PPOE_{\\text{PPO}}) and λ𝜆\\lambda used for GAE (λPPOsubscript𝜆PPO\\lambda_{\\text{PPO}}). To verify that our settings did not inadvertently degrade the performance of PPO we also tested against the settings used by  and refer to this as PPO (original). These results are included in the ablation study in Appendix C.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: we performed the following experiments on the Atari-3 validation set.
