      "content": "Paper Title: Few-shot Link Prediction on N-ary Facts\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe few-shot link prediction on binary facts methods can be divided into two categories: metric learning based models and meta learner based models. Metric learning based models: These models learn a function that matches a query to support instances from a set of support tasks and make predictions. The first study focusing on few-shot link prediction is GMatching [ref]29. It utilizes a neighbor encoder to learn entity embeddings and a matching processor to determine the similarity between support instances and queries. FSRL [ref]30 extends GMatching by integrating information from multiple instances, rather than relying on just one. However, both GMatching and FSRL overlook the dynamic nature of entities. FAAN [ref]31 addresses this issue by introducing an adaptive attention mechanism that selectively focuses on the effective properties during exploiting instances. The above methods rely on training on a large number of training tasks to obtain well entity embeddings. But in practical applications, it is a challenging ad hoc process to define training tasks. To solve this problem, CSR  calculates the truth values of queries by checking evidence of the connection subgraph of entities in the queries without the need for pre-training on training tasks. Meta learner based models: These models calculate the gradient of limited support instances and quickly optimize model parameters. MetaR  is a novel meta relation learning framework that transfers relation information from support instances to query instances. MetaP  and Meta-KGR  extend MetaR by incorporating more efficient convolutional filters and a validity balance mechanism for negative sample utilization, and by incorporating reinforcement learning to search target entities and reasoning paths for enhanced interpretability, respectively. GANA  better predicts complex 1-N, N-1, N-N relations by combining MAML  and TransH  and includes a gate mechanism to filter out noise during relation representations encoding. Some recent works explore few-shot link prediction in special scenarios. REFORM , GMUC , and MetaDyGNN  tackle few-shot link prediction in special scenarios such as in the presence of errors, uncertain knowledge, and dynamic knowledge, respectively. NP-FKGC  is the first work that applies neural process-based method  for few-shot link prediction. It can simultaneously estimate uncertainties and handle complex relations, especially in the out-of-distribution scenario. CogKR  is based on the dual-process theory and includes a summary module for instance relation summarization and an inference module for answer inference. However, all the above methods are designed for binary facts. Generally, the existing models for link prediction on n-ary facts overlook few-shot relations. Meanwhile, the existing models for few-shot link prediction on binary facts cannot handle n-ary facts yet many real-world scenarios contain a large number of few-shot relations. To address this problem, we present an approach for few-shot link prediction on n-ary facts.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: models: These models learn a function that matches a query to support instances from a set of support tasks and make predictions.
