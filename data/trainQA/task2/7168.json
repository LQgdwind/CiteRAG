      "content": "Paper Title: Towards a Simultaneous and Granular Identity-Expression Control in Personalized Face Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nComparison with Text-to-Image Method. We compare our method with the SOTA open-source text-to-image model Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) . As shown in Fig. 6, the two methods take as input the same prompt and the same fine-grained expression labels. The additional input to our framework is a portrait of ‚ÄúMelinda May‚Äù. Compared with our results, SDXL can‚Äôt synthesize the accurate expressions corresponding to ‚Äúenjoyment‚Äù, ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù or ‚Äúgrief‚Äù. The dilemma faced by most text-to-image methods is that they can only recognize a few limited expression labels. Models like ControlNet  need a large amount of training data and couple the background to the face attributes. Our framework also supports expression travel by interpolating between embeddings to further explore fine-grained expression. Comparison with Hybrid Methods. As there is currently no method that can perform SFSR, we construct a hybrid method as a potential competitor by directly combining the best face-swapping method in terms of ID. score, SimSwap[ref]5, and the best face reenactment method in terms of Exp. score, StyleHEAT, based on the quantitative comparisons reported in the part of Swap ID and Swap EXP in Tab. 1. As shown in the part of Swap All in Tab. 1, our method outperforms the hybrid method with a significant margin in all metrics. From the qualitative results shown in Fig. 7, our method can produce more accurate expressions and poses than the hybrid method, due to the powerful ability of expression embedding  and latent diffusion model [ref]35. Comparison with Face Reenactment Methods.\nOur DiffSFSR can also conduct the face reenactment task by setting the inputs Ib‚Äãk‚ÄãgsubscriptùêºùëèùëòùëîI_{bkg} and Ii‚ÄãdsubscriptùêºùëñùëëI_{id} as the same image.\nWe make a comparison with two SOTA face reenactment methods including Face2Face and StyleHEAT, and use their pre-trained networks. From the statistics in the part of Swap EXP in Tab. 1, our method outperforms the two competitors in all metrics. The advantage is more obvious in the qualitative comparison shown in Fig. 8, where the expression in our results is more similar to the source, and the identity and pose are more similar to the target. Comparison with Face Swapping Methods.\nSimilar to face reenactment, our DiffSFSR can also conduct the face swapping task by setting the inputs Ib‚Äãk‚ÄãgsubscriptùêºùëèùëòùëîI_{bkg} and Ie‚Äãx‚Äãpsubscriptùêºùëíùë•ùëùI_{exp} as the same. We make comparisons with five SOTA face swapping methods including FaceShifter, SimSwap[ref]5, HifiFace, E4S and DiffSwap[ref]54. For SimSwap, E4S and DiffSwap, we directly use their public pre-trained networks.\nAs FaceShifter and HifiFace do not make their codes publicly available, we use the implementations from the open-source community111https://github.com/richarduuz/Research_Project222https://github.com/xuehy/HiFiFace-pytorch. From the statistics in the part of Swap ID in Tab. 1, since we focus on both ID and expression, our method outperforms all the competitors in Exp. and achieves promising performance in ID. and Pose. As observed in Fig. 9, except for SimSwap, our results are more similar to the source faces in terms of inner facial features, e.g., beard.\nThere are obvious artifacts in the results of HifiFace. And the faces generated by E4S do not blend well into the background, leading to less natural results. In addition to expression preserving, our advantage over SimSwap is that our method can generate faces with better image quality, with less blur and artifacts, due to the powerful image generation capability of the latent diffusion model [ref]35. User Study with Face Swapping Methods.\nTo comprehensively compare our method with other face-swapping methods, we implemented another human evaluation experiment. For simplicity, we compare our DiffSFSR with the most recent methods of DiffSwap[ref]54 and E4S, as well as SimSwap[ref]5 due to its superior performance in terms of ID consistency (see Tab. 1). 50 participants were recruited to score the results of all methods in terms of ID consistency, expression consistency, realism, and image quality (with a minimum score of 1 and a maximum score of 5; 1 refers to the worst and 5 refers to the best). As shown in Tab. 2, our method registers the topmost scores across all measured metrics. Moreover, in terms of statistical significance, our approach is competitive with other methods in ID consistency while considerably surpassing its competitors on expression consistency, realism, and image quality under a p-value of 0.05. In summary, our method is comparable to other methods in terms of ID consistency but can produce more accurate expressions and more realistic, high-quality images. Study on Improved Midpoint Sampling.\nAs introduced in Sect. 3.3, we need ùê±0‚àósuperscriptsubscriptùê±0\\mathbf{x}_{0}^{*} during training to impose the identity and expression constraints. The more accurate estimation of ùê±0‚àósuperscriptsubscriptùê±0\\mathbf{x}_{0}^{*} is, the more accurate identity and expression losses are.\nWe conduct an experiment on the dataset constructed by randomly selecting 500 image pairs from FFHQ, to evaluate three sampling methods: 1) one-step sampling using Eq. 1, 2) midpoint sampling used in [ref]54, 3) our proposed improved midpoint sampling. MSE is used to measure the error between sampling results and ground truth, thus showing the image reconstruction performance. As shown in Fig. 10, all sampling methods can decrease the reconstruction errors along with the training steps increasing. Our sampling method can achieve lower MSE than others in all periods. Fig. 11 shows the reconstruction results by denoising ùê±tsubscriptùê±ùë°\\mathbf{x}_{t} using different sampling methods. Our results are not only more faithful to ground truth ùê±0subscriptùê±0\\mathbf{x}_{0}, but also more realistic and clear in the regions of eyes, mouths and even the reflection of sunglasses. Fig. 12 shows the comparison in terms of generating final faces. In terms of identity preserving, our sampling methods can produce more facial details, e.g. wrinkles and whiskers, thus more similar to source B. In terms of expression preservation, our result in the 3rd row exhibits less angry expression, thus being more consistent with the expression in source A. In the 4th row, our result displays the expression of slightly opening mouth better than others. Tab. 3 shows the quantitative comparison. When comparing ours to w./o. ID&\\&Exp Losses, the effectiveness of identity and expression losses has been validated by removing them. The improved midpoint sampling gets the best score in ID. and the second best score in Exp., which indicates it can impose more effective constraints on the training of diffusion model.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: As there is currently no method that can perform SFSR, we construct a hybrid method as a potential competitor by directly combining the best face-swapping method in terms of ID. score, SimSwap[ref]5, and the best face reenactment method in terms of Exp. score, StyleHEAT, based on the quantitative comparisons reported in the part of Swap ID and Swap EXP in Tab. 1.
