Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

We follow [ref]19 [ref]21  to adopt the most widely-used dataset split which consists of 108K images and includes the most frequent 150 object classes and 50 predicates.\nWhen evaluating visual relationship detection/scene graph generation on VG, there are three common evaluation modes including (1) Predicate Classification (PredCls): ground truth bounding boxes and object labels are given, (2) Scene Graph Classification (SGCls): only ground truth boxes given, and (3) Scene Graph Detection (SGDet): nothing other than input images is given. We experiment with PredCls, which is a similar setting to what we perform on VRD dataset  and SpatialSense  dataset. \n\n\n\nModel\nRecall@50\nRecall@100\n\n\n\nJoint CNN \n27.9\n35.0\n\nGraph R-CNN \n54.2\n59.1\n\nMessage Passing [ref]19\n59.3\n61.3\n\nFreq [ref]21\n59.9\n64.1\n\nFreq+Overlap [ref]21\n60.6\n62.2\n\nSMN [ref]21\n65.2\n67.1\n\nKERN [ref]25\n65.8\n67.7\n\nVCTree \n66.4\n68.1\n\nRVL-BERT\n62.9\n66.6\n\n Comparison results on VG are presented in Table V, where our proposed RVL-BERT achieves competitive results.\nNote that as mentioned in section IV-A, visual relationship detection can be biased as predicates could be ”guessed” accurately given explicit correlations between object labels and predicates.\nBoth SMN [ref]21 and KERN [ref]25 exploit this property and use the frequency bias and object co-occurrence, respectively.\nHowever, the usage of bias could reversely undermine the capability of generalization which has been demonstrated by comparing mean recall in recent works (e.g., ).\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: We provide additional experimental results on Visual Genome (VG) dataset .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
