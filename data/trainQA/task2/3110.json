      "content": "Paper Title: Deformable ProtoPNet: An Interpretable Image Classifier Using Deformable Prototypes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are two general approaches to interpreting deep neural networks: (1) explaining trained neural networks posthoc; and (2) building inherently interpretable neural networks that can explain themselves. Posthoc explanation techniques (e.g., model approximations using interpretable surrogates  [ref]26, activation maximizations   , saliency visualizations [ref]36      ) do not make a neural network inherently interpretable, as posthoc explanations are not used by the original network during prediction, and may not be faithful to what the original network computes . A Deformable ProtoPNet uses case-based reasoning with prototypes to build an inherently interpretable network.\nThis idea was explored in  and carried further in , where a prototypical part network (ProtoPNet) was introduced.\nProtoPNet uses the similarity scores between an input image and the learned prototypes to generate explanations for its predictions in the form of “this looks like that,” as in Figure 1(a). The ProtoPNet model has been extended multiple times   5. We build our Deformable ProtoPNet upon the ProtoPNet and TesNet models 5. TesNet uses a cosine similarity metric to compute similarities between image patches and prototypes in a latent space, and introduces loss terms to encourage the prototype vectors within a class to be orthogonal to each other and to separate the latent spaces of different classes. All previous prototype-based image classifiers use spatially rigid prototypes. In contrast, Deformable ProtoPNet is the first network to use spatially flexible deformable prototypes, where each prototype consists of several prototypical parts that adaptively change their relative spatial positions depending on the input image (Figure 1(b)). In this way, our Deformable ProtoPNet can capture pose variations and offer a richer explanation for its predictions than previous image classifiers that use case-based reasoning. Deformations and Geometric Transformations.\nOur work relates closely to previous work modeling object deformations and geometric transformations. One of the early attempts at modeling deformations in computer vision models was provided by Deformable Part Models (DPMs) 0, which model deformations as deviations of object parts from their (heuristically chosen) “anchor” positions. The original DPMs use histogram-of-oriented-gradients (HOG) features  to represent objects and their parts, and are trained using latent support vector machines (SVMs). The idea of modeling spatial deformations, encapsulated in DPMs, has been extended into convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The inference algorithm of a DPM was shown to be equivalent to a CNN with distance transform pooling 2, and distance transform pooling was extended into a deformation layer in  for pedestrian detection and deformation pooling (def-pooling) layers in a DeepID-Net  for generic object detection. More recent developments include spatial transformer networks 6, and networks with active convolutions 7 and deformable convolutions  3. Spatial transformer networks 6 predict global parametric transformations (e.g., affine transformations) to be applied to an input image or a convolutional feature map, with the goal of normalizing the “pose” of the target object in the image. Active convolutions 7 learn and apply the same deformation to a convolutional filter, when scanning the filter across all spatial locations of the input feature map. Deformable convolutions  3, on the other hand, learn to predict deformations that will be applied to convolutional filters at each spatial location of the input feature map. This means that the deformations are different across spatial locations and input images. Our Deformable ProtoPNet builds upon the Deformable Convolutional Network  3, by using a similar mechanism to generate offsets for deforming prototypes. However, our Deformable ProtoPNet is different from the Deformable Convolutional Network (and the previous work) in two major ways: (1) our Deformable ProtoPNet offers deformable prototypes whose individual parts can be visualized and understood by human beings; (2) by constraining the image features and the representations of prototypes and prototypical parts to be fixed-length vectors, our Deformable ProtoPNet learns an embedding space that has a geometric interpretation, where image features are clustered around similar prototypes on a hypersphere. Deep Metric Learning Using Margins.\nOur work also relates to previous work that performs deep metric learning using cosine 4 or angular margins   3 . These techniques use unit vectors to represent classes in the fully-connected last layer of a neural network, allowing us to re-interpret the logit of a class for a given input as the cosine of the angle between the class vector and the latent representation of the input. A margin can then be introduced to increase the angle between the latent representation of a training example and the vector of its target class during training, decreasing the target class logit during training, forcing the network to “try harder” to further reduce the angle in order to lower the cross entropy loss. At the end of training with margins, the latent representations of the training examples from the same class will be clustered in angular space around the vector of that class, and they will be separated by some angular margin from the latent representations of the training examples from a different class. In training our Deformable ProtoPNet, we apply angular margins to inflate the prototype activations of the incorrect-class prototypes for each training example during training.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: networks posthoc; and (2) building inherently interpretable neural networks that can explain themselves.
