      "content": "Paper Title: Optimal Automated Market Makers: Differentiable Economics and Strong Duality\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMarket participants like to buy low and sell high, and avoid doing the opposite, at least in expectation.\nBy doing this, a market participant can make a profit.\nA typical market maker, which is an entity that plays a role in facilitating trades by other market participants, achieves profits by charging a spread: they are willing to buy some quantity of a good at a fixed price, and sell the same quantity at a higher fixed price.\nThe goal of a market maker is to profit even in the face of potential adverse selection, which\ncan arise when better informed traders can selectively accept offers that are profitable to them (and therefore unprofitable to the market maker).\nRoughly speaking, the spread should be wider when there is greater\nadverse selection. At the same time, there is a much richer space of possibilities for market makers than simply adjusting\nthe spread.\nAutomated market makers (AMMs), as\nused in prediction markets and decentralized finance (DeFi),\nfrequently make use of these richer possibilities.\nFor example, the logarithmic-market scoring rule (LMSR)¬† and constant-product market makers¬† have the effect of offering a trader a\ncontinuum of trades at a continuum of prices.\nFrom the perspective of mechanism design,\nthe use of spread by a market maker is\nsimilar to a posted-price mechanism,\nand posted-price mechanisms are well known to be\noptimal for selling a single good to a single buyer.\nUnder reasonable models of adverse selection, the same is true for market making: optimal mechanisms consist of a bid-ask spread, where the nature and extent of adverse selection determines the width of the spread¬†. From the full space of mechanisms, the optimal mechanism\nin this single good case\nis therefore surprisingly simple. But what if a market maker wants to make markets in multiple goods at once?\nIn this case, the full space of mechanisms might be extremely rich: in addition to offering a continuum of trades (as with the aforementioned, single-good AMMs), there could be bundling among goods and the potential to accept goods ‚Äúin kind‚Äù in exchange for a lower payment. For example, a market maker might offer to buy good 1 for price xùë•x, or sell good 2 for price yùë¶y, but simultaneously buy good 1 and sell good 2 charging z<y‚àíxùëßùë¶ùë•z<y-x.\nTo our knowledge, it is atypical for current market makers to bundle goods,\nand they instead simply adjust a separate spread per good (analogous to item-wise, posted prices).\nThere are a few exceptions, though; e.g., in the case of certain order types on the OneChronos combinatorial stock exchange¬†,\nsome experiments in combinatorial prediction markets¬† , and the portfolio trading of bonds. Many of these aforementioned cases of bundling\nare motivated by outside business constraints; e.g.,\nthere may be complements or substitutes between goods, or there may be practical reasons why a customer is forced to trade bundles.\nBut what if all these outside concerns are removed?\nWe want to understand whether\na profit-maximizing market maker\nin the multiple-good case will want\nto take advantage of the full richness of the space of mechanisms.\n(Indeed,\nin classic auction design when selling multiple goods to a single buyer, optimal mechanisms may show this kind of complexity¬†[ref]14  .)\nThis question motivates our work.\nUnder a deliberately simple model of additive and quasilinear traders, and considering an objective for the market maker that can take into account the possibility of adverse selection (following that of Milionis et¬†al. [ref]32), we ask\nhow much of the full space of possible mechanisms will a market maker want to use?\nWe give answers to this question,\nand further believe that the computational and theoretical tools that we develop\nhave broader interest. The space of possible market making strategies is quite complex in the multiple good case,\nand conjecturing the form of an optimal solution is not trivial.\nTo search through the space of mechanisms and develop our theoretical results and additional conjectures on optimal designs, we make use of\ndifferentiable economics¬†, which employs the tools of\nmodern machine learning to search through the space of all mechanisms to optimize performance.\nThrough differentiable economics, we find conjectured optimal mechanisms that make use of the full richness of the space of possible mechanisms: displaying bundling behavior across both buying and selling, and potentially offering a continuum of possible trades.\nDifferentiable economics has previously been used to find a optimal auctions in a few, stylized auction settings¬† .\nHere, we utilize differentiable economics, in particular RochetNet¬†, in studying and developing the theory for a new\nkind of problem (optimal market making with multiple goods and adverse selection),\napplying it from the start to guide our understanding and theoretical development.\nIn doing so, we have found the methods of differentiable economics to be\ninvaluable in guiding our exploration.\nThe techniques we use appear to work quite well, and require only access to samples from the market maker‚Äôs distribution of beliefs about traders. For this reason, we belief that future work can\nalso pursue their use as a tool for data-driven design of market makers\nthat can inform deployment. We provide a framework for formally proving the optimality of conjectured mechanisms that are generated through the differential economics pipeline. To do this, we treat market makers as strategyproof mechanisms, and show that the market maker design problem is dual to an optimal transport problem, extending the theory of optimal transport duality from¬†[ref]14  to allow for different constraints on the primal and dual, and giving a geometric interpretation of these constraints that allows solving the dual problem. In particular, we use differentiable economics to search for profitable mechanisms across multiple valuation distributions.\nWe find that some of the learned mechanisms make use of mixed bundling; i.e., trading in goods separately at one price, but also offering bundle discounts or taking payments in kind (accepting a sale of one good to discount the purchase of another). Other mechanisms offer a continuum of allocations in certain regions.\nBased on this,\nwe conjecture that the full space of mechanisms is in fact potentially useful to the market maker. For one of these cases, we apply the duality framework, constructing explicit dual certificates for a particular choice of distribution under a linear model of adverse selection, showing optimality for a family of mechanisms parameterized by the strength of adverse selection.\nAs conjectured, the optimal mechanisms offer a bid-ask spread for each good. However, they also offer bundled trades at better prices than the separate bids and asks. For a specific example in one case, the trader can buy one good for 5656\\frac{5}{6}, or sell another for 1616\\frac{1}{6}, but simultaneous buying and selling costs only 4‚àí26426\\frac{4-\\sqrt{2}}{6}. As the strength of adverse selection decreases, the prices for all goods and bundles improve nonlinearly. We thus answer our main question about the optimal design of market makers in this multiple good setting in the affirmative: under a reasonable model of adverse selection, it may be optimal for a profit-maximizing market maker to engage in mixed bundling, with profits up to 11.4% greater than separately making a market for\neach good.\nBeyond being of theoretical interest, we believe that this positive answer to the question\nabout the richness of market making possibilities in this setting\ncan motivate the use of multiple-good CFMMs in DeFi and perhaps also in prediction markets, as well as providing a motivation for the increased use of combinatorial bundle order types in securities markets.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: take advantage of the full richness of the space of mechanisms.\n(Indeed,\nin classic auction design when selling multiple goods to a single buyer, optimal mechanisms may show this kind of complexity¬†[ref]14  .)\nThis question motivates our work.\nUnder a deliberately simple model of additive and quasilinear traders, and considering an objective for the market maker that can take into account the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
