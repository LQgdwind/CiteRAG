In the recent work of Linial and Shraibman  a construction of large corner-free sets in [N]×[N]delimited-[]𝑁delimited-[]𝑁[N]\\times[N] was obtained in an elegant manner by designing efficient NOF communication protocols for a specific communication problem (much like the upcoming Eval problem). We take a different, algebraic approach to the corner problem, and make progress on the corner problem over 𝔽pn×𝔽pnsuperscriptsubscript𝔽𝑝𝑛superscriptsubscript𝔽𝑝𝑛\\mathbb{F}_{p}^{n}\\times\\mathbb{F}_{p}^{n} by introducing in this area a new algebraic method via combinatorial degeneration.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: and Lipton .\nThere has been much interest in (and progress on) the corner problem, variations of the problem, and connections to NOF communication, in particular in the recent works of\nShraibman [ref]45,\nLinial, Pitassi and Shraibman [ref]34, Viola , Alon and Shraibman [ref]5, and\nLinial and Shraibman  .

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
