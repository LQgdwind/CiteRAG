      "content": "Paper Title: Pseudodeterministic Algorithms and the Structure of Probabilistic Time\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA pseudodeterministic algorithm for a search problem 𝒮𝒮\\cal S is a probabilistic algorithm that with high probability outputs a fixed solution to 𝒮𝒮\\cal S on any given input. The notion of pseudodeterminism was pioneered by Gat and Goldwasser , motivated by applications in cryptography and distributed computing. Pseudodeterminism has been the topic of much recent work and has been studied in a variety of settings, including query complexity, property testing, parallel computation, learning algorithms, space-bounded computation, streaming algorithms and interactive proof systems  [ref]18 [ref]14        [ref]16    . A fundamental question about pseudodeterministic algorithms posed in  is whether there is a polynomial-time pseudodeterministic algorithm for generating prime numbers of a given length. Note that there is a trivial probabilistic algorithm that generates a random number with n𝑛n bits and checks it for primality; however, this algorithm is far from being pseudodeterministic. The question of efficient generation of primes has attracted broad interest, including the Polymath 4 project  devoted to this topic. Despite this, known unconditional results are still fairly weak: the most efficient deterministic algorithm  to generate n𝑛n-bit primes runs in time Ω​(2n/2)Ωsuperscript2𝑛2\\Omega(2^{n/2}).\nIn , some progress was made on the question of  about generating primes. They give a pseudodeterministic algorithm running in time 2no​(1)superscript2superscript𝑛𝑜12^{n^{o(1)}} on input of length 1nsuperscript1𝑛1^{n} that generates a fixed prime pnsubscript𝑝𝑛p_{n} with high probability for infinitely many n𝑛n. While this algorithm is a significant improvement on brute force search, it is unsatisfactory in a couple of different respects: it runs in sub-exponential time rather than polynomial time, and it is only guaranteed to be correct for infinitely many n𝑛n. Somewhat surprisingly, the algorithm of  uses very little information about primes – just that they are plentiful (by the Prime Number Theorem), and that there is a polynomial-time algorithm for Primality . Indeed,  show a far more general result giving a pseudodeterministic algorithm solving the search version of the Circuit Acceptance Probability Problem (𝖢𝖠𝖯𝖯𝖢𝖠𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{CAPP}), from which the prime generation result follows easily. This more general result has, of course, the same caveats as in the result for primes: the running time is sub-exponential, and the success of the pseudodeterministic algorithm is only guaranteed for infinitely many input lengths. Strengthening this general result to algorithms that run in polynomial time and work for almost all input lengths would solve the main open question of , hence it is natural to wonder if this is possible. In this paper, we show that progress on this question is tightly connected to longstanding open problems about the structure of probabilistic time, namely the question of whether 𝖡𝖯𝖯𝖡𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{BPP} has complete problems and the question of whether there is a hierarchy theorem for 𝖡𝖯𝖯𝖡𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{BPP}. We show that these connections go in both directions: we exploit previous work on hierarchies for probabilistic time to show new results on pseudodeterministic generation of primes, and we show that any improvements in the general result of  would yield progress on hierarchies and complete problems for 𝖡𝖯𝖳𝖨𝖬𝖤𝖡𝖯𝖳𝖨𝖬𝖤\\mathsf{BPTIME}. We briefly review what is known about the structure of probabilistic time. Recall that 𝖡𝖯𝖯𝖡𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{BPP} is the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time by a probabilistic machine that has bounded error on every input. 𝖡𝖯𝖯𝖡𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{BPP} is a semantic class rather than a syntactic one, meaning that there is no canonical enumeration of machines defining those and only those languages in the class. The reason is that the acceptance and rejection criteria for a probabilistic machine M𝑀M on an input are not exhaustive – it could be that a machine M𝑀M satisfies its bounded-error promise on some inputs but not others, in which case it does not define a language in 𝖡𝖯𝖯𝖡𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{BPP}. Indeed, it is not hard to show that it is undecidable whether a given probabilistic machine M𝑀M satisfies its bounded-error promise on every input. In contrast, for syntactic classes such as 𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{P}, 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP} and 𝖯𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤𝖯𝖲𝖯𝖠𝖢𝖤\\mathsf{PSPACE}, the acceptance and rejection criteria are indeed exhaustive – a given deterministic or non-deterministic machine accepts or rejects on any given input. Syntactic classes have canonical complete problems which are based on canonical enumerations of machines defining the class, but semantic ones do not. Under strong derandomization assumptions, 𝖡𝖯𝖯=𝖯𝖡𝖯𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{BPP}=\\mathsf{P} 5, and hence 𝖡𝖯𝖯𝖡𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{BPP} has complete problems because 𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{P} does, but we know nothing at all about the existence of complete problems unconditionally. In fact, we do not even know if complete problems exist for the class of problems solvable on average in probabilistic polynomial time, or the class of problems solvable in probabilistic polynomial time with small advice. The semantic nature of the class 𝖡𝖯𝖯𝖡𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{BPP} is also relevant to the existence of hierarchy theorems for the class. A hierarchy theorem is a result showing unconditionally that more resources allow us to solve more problems. Some of the earliest results in complexity theory 4 \nwere hierarchy theorems for deterministic time and space. Almost optimal hierarchy theorems are known for every syntactic class    with resource bounds up to exponential, using diagonalization arguments. However, these diagonalization arguments presuppose that there is an efficient canonical enumeration of machines in the class, and hence do not work for semantic classes. By using padding arguments and exploiting hierarchies for deterministic time, it is known that 𝖡𝖯𝖯𝖡𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{BPP} is strictly contained in 𝖡𝖯𝖲𝖴𝖡𝖤𝖷𝖯𝖡𝖯𝖲𝖴𝖡𝖤𝖷𝖯\\mathsf{BPSUBEXP} 7, but it is still open even whether 𝖡𝖯𝖳𝖨𝖬𝖤​(n)𝖡𝖯𝖳𝖨𝖬𝖤𝑛\\mathsf{BPTIME}(n) is strictly contained in 𝖡𝖯𝖳𝖨𝖬𝖤​(T​(n))𝖡𝖯𝖳𝖨𝖬𝖤𝑇𝑛\\mathsf{BPTIME}(T(n)), for any function T𝑇T that remains sub-exponential even when composed with itself a constant number of times. The situation is slightly better when it comes to hierarchies for variants of 𝖡𝖯𝖯𝖡𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{BPP}: in a line of works  , hierarchies were shown for 𝖡𝖯𝖯/1𝖡𝖯𝖯1\\mathsf{BPP}/1 (the class of problems solvable in probabilistic polynomial time with 1 bit of advice) and for 𝖧𝖾𝗎𝗋𝖧𝖾𝗎𝗋\\mathsf{Heur}-𝖡𝖯𝖯𝖡𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{BPP} (the class of problems solvable on average in probabilistic polynomial time). Despite much effort, it remains wide open to show a hierarchy for 𝖡𝖯𝖯𝖡𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{BPP}. Note that these questions about the structure of probabilistic time are about separations (in the case of hierarchies) and about hardness (in the case of complete problems), while the question of pseudodeterministic constructions is an algorithmic question. Connections between algorithms and lower bounds have already been very fruitful in complexity theory, e.g., in the theory of pseudorandomness or in Williams’ algorithmic method for complexity lower bounds .
