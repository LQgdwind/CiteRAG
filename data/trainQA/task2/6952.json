      "content": "Paper Title: Generalized Simplicial Attention Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of GSAN on four challenging tasks: 1) trajectory prediction (inductive learning) as described in [ref]31; 2) missing data imputation (MDI) in citation complexes (transductive learning) as explored in  and [ref]37; 3) graph classification on TUDataset [ref]31, and 4) simplex prediction in citation complexes . The first two tasks, trajectory prediction and MDI are natively designed with single-order signals (from edge signals going up); for this reason, and also to have a fair comparison with other single-order SoA architectures, we employ GSAN with just one module operating on the required signal order (thus reducing it to the SAN architecture [ref]1). The graph classification task is originally designed for graph data (node signals) but, following the consideration of [ref]31, it is possible to tackle it by learning higher-order signals and leveraging the potential of simplicial complexes. Finally, the simplex prediction task is natively designed with signals of different orders. Moreover, for the last two tasks we present also the results obtained with a lower-complexity version of GSAN (dubbed GSAN-joint), which we derived starting from simplicial complex filters that do not leverage the Dirac decomposition as in (15) but are just polynomials of the Dirac operator 𝐃𝒳subscript𝐃𝒳\\mathbf{D}_{\\mathcal{X}}; GSAN-joint has half of the parameters and its derivation can be found in Appendix B. Per each task, the results are collected in tables, where we highlight in bold the model reaching the top accuracy. As we will illustrate in the sequel, the results show how the proposed architecture outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches.
