      "content": "Paper Title: NovPhy: A Testbed for Physical Reasoning in Open-world Environments\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPhysical reasoning has become an important aspect of AI research due to the increased reliance on autonomous AI systems in day-to-day operations. There are multiple physical reasoning benchmarks and testbeds available to assist AI systems enhance physical reasoning capabilities in order to perform securely in the real world. The physical reasoning benchmarks such as Physion [ref]7, IntPhys [ref]22, CLEVERER [ref]23 are based on videos while COPHY  is an image-based physical reasoning benchmark. Physion comprises eight physical reasoning scenarios, including rolling, sliding, and projectile motion, which are important capabilities to work in the physical world [ref]7. IntPhys, on the other hand, is concerned with physical reasoning abilities acquired during infancy, such as object permanence, spatio-temporal continuity, and shape consistency [ref]22. The CLEVERER benchmark presents videos and asks questions inspired by the theory of human causal judgement [ref]23. COPHY benchmark presents a sequence of images based on physical scenarios and asks to predict the outcome if you make a modification to the initial image. COPHY is developed to test counterfactual reasoning applied to the physical world . To bring physical reasoning abilities of AI systems closer to reality, researchers have created action based benchmarks that require agents to take an action in order to accomplish the goal. Examples of such benchmarks include PHYRE  and Virtual Tools . PHYRE is a benchmark consisting of simple 2D physics based tasks, aimed to foster the development of efficient models capable of generalisation across tasks . The Virtual Tools game, focuses on evaluating agents on selecting appropriate tools and taking the correct action using the tool to solve the tasks . Phy-Q  is also an action based physical reasoning testbed that consists of a broad variety of 15 physical reasoning scenarios. Some physical scenarios in Phy-Q (applying single or multiple forces, rolling, falling, sliding) are inspired by physical reasoning abilities developed during childhood, whereas some scenarios (adequate timing, clearing paths, and manoeuvring) are required to overcome challenges for robots to work safely in physical environments. As an improvement to the previously mentioned benchmarks, Phy-Q testbed supports different evaluation settings based on different generalization levels (local generalization and broad generalization) and also they have established human performance on the scenarios in the testbed. Furthermore, this testbed allows us to compute the physical reasoning quotient, which reflects an agent’s physical reasoning aptitude. Even though all the preceding benchmarks support the development of AI systems with advanced physical reasoning capabilities, none of them focuses on physical reasoning under novel circumstances, which is the setting an agent in the real world would frequently encounter. In our testbed NovPhy, we combine physical reasoning scenarios with novel situations, to create a real-world like setting to evaluate the agent’s performance. To introduce novel situations, we consider the first five physical reasoning scenarios from the Phy-Q tesbed: single force, multiple forces, rolling, falling, and sliding.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: benchmarks and testbeds available to assist AI systems enhance physical reasoning capabilities in order to perform securely in the real world.
