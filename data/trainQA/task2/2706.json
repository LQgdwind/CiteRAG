      "content": "Paper Title: Allocating Indivisible Goods to Strategic Agents: Pure Nash Equilibria and FairnessAn extended abstract version of this work appeared in the Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Web and Internet Economics (WINE 2021) [8].\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFair division refers to the problem of distributing a set of resources among a set of agents in such a way that everyone is ‚Äúhappy‚Äù with the overall allocation. Capturing this ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù can be elusive,\nas it may be determined by complicated underlying social dynamics; however, two well-motivated (and mathematically conducive) interpretations are those of envy-freeness    and proportionality . When an allocation is envy-free, each agent values the set of resources that she receives at least as much as the set of any other agent, while when an allocation is proportional, each agent receives at least 1/n1ùëõ1/n of her total value for all the goods, assuming there are nùëõn agents.\nSince the first mathematically formal treatment of fair division by Banach, Knaster, and Steinhaus , the multifaceted questions that arise for the different variants of the problem have been studied in a diverse group of fields, including mathematics, economics, and political science. As many of these questions are inherently algorithmic, fair division questions, especially the ones related to the existence, computation, and approximation of different fairness notions, have been very actively studied by computer scientists during the last two decades (see, e.g.,     for surveys of recent results). In the standard discrete fair division setting that we study here, the resources are indivisible goods and the agents have additive valuation functions over them. Typically, there is also the additional assumption that all the goods need to be allocated. This discrete setting poses a significant conceptual challenge, as the classic notions of fairness originally introduced for divisible goods, such as envy-freeness and proportionality, are impossible to satisfy. The example that illustrates this situation needs only two agents and just one positively valued good. Whoever does not receive the good will not consider the result to be either envy-free or proportional. However, this should not necessarily be considered an unfair outcome, as it is done out of necessity, not malice: the only other (deterministic) option would be to deprive both agents of the good, which seems wasteful. To define what is fair in this context, a number of weaker fairness notions have been proposed. Among the most prevalent of those are envy-freeness up to one good (EF1), envy-freeness up to any good (EFX), and maximin share fairness (MMS).\nThe notions of EF1 and EFX were introduced by Lipton et al.¬†[ref]44, Budish , and Gourv√®s et al.¬†9, Caragiannis et al.¬†6 respectively, and they can be seen as additive relaxations of envy-freeness. Both of them are based on the following rationale: an agent may envy another agent but only by the value of the most (for EF1) or the least (for EFX) desirable good in the other agent‚Äôs bundle. It is straightforward that EF1 is weaker than EFX, and indeed this is reflected to the known results for the two notions.\nThe concept of the maximin share of an agent was introduced by Budish \nas a relaxation to the proportionality benchmark. The corresponding fairness notion, maximin share fairness (MMS), requires that each agent receives the maximum value that this agent would obtain if she was allowed to partition the goods into nùëõn bundles and then keep the worst of these (see Section 2 for a more detailed description and a formal definition). From an algorithmic point of view,\nthere are many results regarding the existence and computation of these notions (see our Related Work).\nHere, however, we are interested in exploring the problem from a game theoretic perspective. In particular, we assume that the agents are strategic, which means that it is possible for an agent to intentionally misreport her values for (some of) the goods to end up with a bundle of higher total value.\nWe see this as a very natural direction, as it captures what may happen in practice in many real-life scenarios where fair division solutions can be applied, for instance, in a divorce settlement.\nIt should be noted here that, in accordance to the existing literature on truthful allocation mechanisms       4,\nwe assume there are no monetary transfers. Therefore, a mechanism in our setting is just an algorithm that takes as input the, possibly misreported, values that the agents declare. The existence of truthful mechanisms, i.e., mechanisms where no agent ever has an incentive to lie, was studied in the same setting by Amanatidis et al.¬† who showed that, even for two agents, truthfulness and fairness are incompatible by providing impossibility results for every non-trivial fairness notion.\nAs a consequence, the next natural question to ask is: Is it possible to have non-truthful mechanisms that are guaranteed to have equilibria, with these equilibria always inducing fair allocations? Thus, our main quest is to investigate whether there exist mechanisms that have pure Nash equilibria for every instance and each allocation corresponding to an equilibrium provides fairness guarantees with respect to the true valuation functions of the agents.\nThe stability notion of a pure Nash equilibrium, on which we focus here, describes a state where each agent plays a deterministic strategy (namely, reports her value for each good) and no agent can attain higher value by deviating to a different strategy.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: the most prevalent of those are envy-freeness up to one good (EF1), envy-freeness up to any good (EFX), and maximin share fairness (MMS).\nThe notions of EF1 and EFX were introduced by Lipton et al.¬†[ref]44, Budish , and Gourv√®s et al.¬†9, Caragiannis et al.¬†6 respectively, and they can be seen as additive relaxations of envy-freeness.
