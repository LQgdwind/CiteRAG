      "content": "Paper Title: Sampling for Deep Learning Model Diagnosis TECHNICAL REPORT\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n(5 [ref]34   [ref]24)\nModel tracker is one of the earliest systems for model diagnosis. It diagnoses models\nby tracking its performance using statistical measures, such as accuracy, AUC, etc. and does\nnot support model diagnosis for DL models. MLCube [ref]24, one of the earlier visualization\ntool for model diagnosis visualizes data from pre-computed data cubes based on features from data and model results. The data-cubes utilized\nby this tool are based on less than 100100100 features and like Model tracker, it pre-dates the large scale of data that must\nbe supported for DL model diagnosis. MISTIQUE 5 supports DL model diagnosis via examination\nof model activations, their primary approach is to reduce the storage footprint required by activations. MISTIQUE shares our goals\nof reducing query runtime for model diagnosis, but it uses a different approach,\nquantization and de-duplication to reduce the storage. Modelhub [ref]34 supports model diagnosis by storing learned models and training logs with an approach that reduces\nstorage footprint. Modelhub focuses on different artifacts, learned models and training logs, which\nthey store and retrieve efficiently by introducing a model versioning system and a domain-specific language for searching\nthrough model space, solving a very different problem. DeepBase  supports model interpretabiltiy and diagnosis by providing a declarative abstraction to express\nand execute the generation and comparision of these artifacts. DeepBase relies on the ability to encapsulate model interpretbility\nquestions as hypothesis functions (e.g., parts of speech tags and image captions).\nDeepBase, ModelHub and MISTIQUE could benefit by leveraging our sampling techniques for their systems.\nFinally, a variety of visualization tools    1  utilize activations and\ngradients to interpret and diagnose DL models. All of these tools would benefit from our sampling techniques, as sampling\nwould help reduce the scale of data required to support model diagnosis. Activis , for instance\nselectively pre-computes values for nodes of interest to save computation and storage. Sampling techniques such as ours will\nenable ML practitioners using tools such as Activis to avoid making such compromises.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: (5 [ref]34   [ref]24)\nModel tracker is one of the earliest systems for model diagnosis. It diagnoses models\nby tracking its performance using statistical measures, such as accuracy, AUC, etc. and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
