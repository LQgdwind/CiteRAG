      "content": "Paper Title: Audio-Visual Glance Network for Efficient Video Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTemporal redundancy due to some frames being visually similar or containing irrelevant backgrounds leads to inefficient video recognition. To address this issue, various methods have been proposed  [ref]25  [ref]10  [ref]46   . For example, temporal shift module  shifts feature maps along the temporal dimension to enable computationally-free temporal connections on top of 2D convolutions. AR-Net [ref]25 consists of a policy network that decides which resolution to process a frame with, and multiple backbones with various resolutions. VideoIQ  contains lightweight policy network that can adjust the quantization precision of frames so that simpler frames are processed with lower precision, while FrameExit [ref]10 uses an effective deterministic policy network and gating module to find the earliest exiting temporal point in a video sequence. MGSampler  and AdaFrame [ref]46 use LSTMs to adaptively decide which frame to process next, while AdaFuse  dynamically chooses whether to reuse extracted features or fuse current and past features. The DSN  framework contains a sampling module and a policy maker to perform clip selection, forwarding only important frames to the classification module. In parallel directions, there are models that focus on reducing spatial redundancy. For example, AdaFocus   uses a lightweight feature extractor and policy network to extract only the most important area or patch from an image, which is then fed into a heavier visual network with lower image resolution. AdaFocusV1  uses reinforcement learning to train the policy network, while AdaFocusV2  improves on this by utilizing a bilinear interpolation method to enable backpropagation along with their own training procedure. Our proposed network aims to reduce both temporal and spatial redundancy. For temporal redundancy reduction, we employ a multimodal transformer to assess and select only the most salient frames. Meanwhile, to address spatial redundancy we crop spatially only the most important areas for processing.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: Temporal redundancy due to some frames being visually similar or containing irrelevant backgrounds leads to inefficient video recognition.
