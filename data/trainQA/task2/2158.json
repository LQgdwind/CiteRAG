      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Intrusion Prevention Policies through Optimal Stopping\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAn organization’s security strategy has traditionally been defined, implemented, and updated by domain experts . Although this approach can provide basic security for an organization’s communication and computing infrastructure, a growing concern is that infrastructure update cycles become shorter and attacks increase in sophistication. Consequently, the security requirements become increasingly difficult to meet. As a response, significant efforts are made to automate security processes and functions.\nOver the last years, research directions emerged to automatically find and update security policies. One such direction aims at automating the creation of threat models for a given infrastructure . A second direction focuses on evolutionary processes that produce novel exploits and corresponding defenses . In a third direction, the interaction between an attacker and a defender is modeled as a game, which allows attack and defense policies to be analyzed and sometimes constructed using game theory  . In a fourth direction, statistical tests are used to detect attacks . Further, the evolution of an infrastructure and the actions of a defender is studied using the framework of dynamical systems. This framework allows optimal policies to be obtained using methods from control theory  or dynamic programming  [ref]9. In all of the above directions, machine learning techniques are often applied to estimate model parameters and policies 0 1. Many activities center around modeling the infrastructure as a discrete-time dynamical system in the form of a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Here, the possible actions of the defender are defined by the action space of the MDP, the defender policy is determined by the actions that the defender takes in different states, and the security objective is encoded in the reward function, which the defender tries to optimize. To find the optimal policy in an MDP, two main methods are used: dynamic programming and reinforcement learning. The advantage of dynamic programming is that it has a strong theoretical grounding and oftentimes allows to derive properties of the optimal policy 2 3. The disadvantage is that it requires complete knowledge of the MDP, including the transition probabilities. In addition, the computational overhead is high, which makes it infeasible to compute the optimal policy for all but simple configurations 4 3 . Alternatively, reinforcement learning enables learning the dynamics of the model through exploration. With the reinforcement learning approach, it is often possible to compute close approximations of the optimal policy for non-trivial configurations 0 5 4 6. As a drawback, however, theoretical insights into the structure of the optimal policy generally remain elusive. In this paper, we study an intrusion prevention use case that involves the IT infrastructure of an organization. The operator of this infrastructure, which we call the defender, takes measures to protect it against a possible attacker while, at the same time, providing a service to a client population. The infrastructure includes a public gateway through which the clients access the service and which also is open to a plausible attacker. The attacker decides when to start an intrusion and then executes a sequence of actions that includes reconnaissance and exploits. Conversely, the defender aims at preventing intrusions and maintaining the service to its clients. It monitors the infrastructure and can block outside access to the gateway, an action that disrupts the service but stops any ongoing intrusion. What makes the task of the defender difficult is the fact that it lacks direct knowledge of the attacker’s actions and must infer that an intrusion occurs from monitoring data. We study the use case within the framework of discrete-time dynamical systems. Specifically, we formulate the problem of finding an optimal defender policy as an optimal stopping problem, where stopping refers to blocking access to the gateway. Optimal stopping is frequently used to model problems in the fields of finance and communication systems 7 8  9. To the best of our knowledge, finding an intrusion prevention policy through solving an optimal stopping problem is a novel approach. By formulating intrusion prevention as an optimal stopping problem, we know from the theory of dynamic programming that the optimal policy can be expressed through a threshold that is obtained from observations, i.e. from infrastructure measurements 3 2. This contrasts with prior works that formulate the problem using a general MDP, which does not allow insight into the structure of optimal policies 0 1 0 1. To account for the fact that the defender only has access to a limited number of measurements and cannot directly observe the attacker, we model the optimal stopping problem with a Partially Observed Markov Decision Process (POMDP). We obtain the defender policies by simulating a series of POMDP episodes in which an intrusion takes place and where the defender continuously updates its policy based on outcomes of previous episodes. To update the policy, we use a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm. This approach enables us to find effective defender policies despite the uncertainty about the attacker’s behavior and despite the large state space of the model. We validate our approach to intrusion prevention for a non-trivial infrastructure configuration and two attacker profiles. Through extensive simulation, we demonstrate that the learned defender policies indeed are threshold based, that they converge quickly, and that they are close to optimal. We make two contributions with this paper. First, we formulate the problem of intrusion prevention as a problem of optimal stopping. This novel approach allows us a) to derive properties of the optimal defender policy using results from dynamic programming and b) to use reinforcement learning techniques to approximate the optimal policy for a non-trivial configuration. Second, we instantiate the simulation model with measurements collected from an emulation of the target infrastructure, which reduces the assumptions needed to construct the simulation model and narrows the gap between a simulation episode and a scenario playing out in a real system. This addresses a limitation of related work that rely on abstract assumptions to construct the simulation model 0 1 0 1.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: and the actions of a defender is studied using the framework of dynamical systems.
