      "content": "Paper Title: Making deep neural networks right for the right scientific reasons by interacting with their explanations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep neural networks have shown excellent performances in many real-world applications. Unfortunately, they may show “Clever Hans”-like behavior—making use of confounding factors within datasets—to achieve high performance. In this work, we introduce the novel learning setting of “explanatory interactive learning” (XIL) and illustrate its benefits on a plant phenotyping research task. XIL adds the scientist into the training loop such that she interactively revises the original model via providing feedback on its explanations. Our experimental results demonstrate that XIL can help avoiding Clever Hans moments in machine learning and encourages (or discourages, if appropriate) trust into the underlying model. Imagine a plant phenotyping team attempting to characterize crop resistance to plant pathogens. The plant physiologist records a large amount of hyperspectral imaging data. Impressed by the results of deep learning in other scientific areas, she wants to establish similar results for phenotyping. Consequently, she asks a machine learning expert to apply deep learning to analyze the data. Luckily, the resulting predictive accuracy is very high. The plant physiologist, however, remains skeptical. The results are “too good, to be true”. Checking the decision process of the deep model using explainable artificial intelligence (AI), the machine learning expert is flabbergasted to find that the learned deep model uses clues within the data that do not relate to the biological problem at hand, so-called confounding factors. The physiologist loses trust in AI and turns away from it, proclaiming it to be useless.††Preprint. Work in progress. This example encapsulates an important issue of current explainable AI [ref]1 [ref]2. Indeed, the seminal paper of Lapuschkin et al. [ref]3 helps in “unmasking Clever Hans predictors and assessing what machines really learn”.\nHowever, rather than proclaiming, as the plant physiologist might, that the machines have learned the right predictions for the wrong reasons and can therefore not be trusted, we here showcase that interactions between the learning system and the human user can correct the model, towards making the right predictions for the right reasons . This may also increase the trust in machine learning models.\nActually, trust lies at the foundation of major theories of interpersonal relationships in psychology   and we argue that interaction and understandability are central to trust in learning machines.\nSurprisingly, the link between interacting, explaining and building trust has been largely ignored by the machine learning literature. Existing approaches focus on passive learning only and do not consider the interaction between the user and the learner   , whereas, interactive learning frameworks such as active  and coactive learning \ndo not consider the issue of trust. In active learning, for instance, the model presents unlabeled instances to a user, and in exchange obtains their label. This is completely opaque—the user is oblivious to the model’s beliefs and reasons for predictions and to how they change in time, and cannot see the consequences of her instructions. In coactive learning, the user sees and corrects the system’s prediction, if necessary, but the predictions are not explained to her. So, why should users trust models learned interactively? Furthermore, although an increasing amount of research investigates methods for explaining machine learning models, even here the notion of interaction has been largely ignored. Reconsider the study by Lapuschkin et al. [ref]3. They showed that one can find “Clever Hans”-like behavior in popular computer vision models basing their decisions on confounding factors. Based on these findings, the authors recommended a word of caution towards the interest in such models, but they did not offer a solution for correcting their behavior. Particularly in real-world applications, where monitoring for every possible confounding factor or acquiring a new dataset due to existing confounders is time and resource consuming, it is inevitable to move beyond revealing the (wrong) reasons by making a step towards correcting the reasons underlying a models decisions. Doing so is exactly the main technical contribution of the present study. We introduce the novel learning setting of “explanatory interactive learning” (XIL) and illustrate its benefits in an important scientific endeavor, namely, plant phenotyping. Starting from a learning system that does not deliver biologically plausible explanations for a relevant, real-world task in plant phenotyping, we add the scientist into the training loop, who interactively revises the original model by interacting via it’s explanations so that it produces trustworthy decisions without a major drop in performance.\nSpecifically, XIL takes the form illustrated in Fig. 1. In each step, the learner explains its interactive query to the domain expert, and she responds by correcting the explanations, if necessary, to provide feedback. This allows the user not only to check whether the model is right or wrong on the chosen instance but also if the answer is right (or wrong) for the wrong reasons, e.g., when there are ambiguities in the data such as confounders  . By witnessing the evolution of the explanations, similar to a teacher supervising the progress of a student, the human user can see whether the model eventually “gets it”. The user may even correct the explanation presented to guide the learner. This correction step is crucial for more directly affecting the learner’s beliefs and is integral to modulating trust  . Specifically, we make the following contributions:\n(i) Introduction of XIL with counterexamples (CE) to revise “Clever Hans” behavior in a model-agnostic fashion.\n(ii) Adaption of the “right for the right reasons” (RRR) loss to latent layers of deep neural networks.\n(iii) Showcasing XIL on the computer vision benchmark datasets PASCAL VOC 2007  and MSCOCO 2014 .\n(iv) Evaluation of XIL on a highly relevant dataset for plant phenotyping, demonstrating its potential as an enabler of scientific discovery.\n(v) Gathering of the plant phenotyping dataset and the creation of a version with confounders.\n(vi) A user study on trust development within XIL .\n\n A preliminary version of this manuscript has been published as a conference paper\n. The present paper significantly extends the conference version by (ii-v)\nMoreover, the ad-hoc XIL user study presented in  was completely re-designed, newly conducted, and now includes a thorough statistical analysis (vi). To encourage further research, we provide the created plant phenotyping dataset. We proceed as follows. We start by formally introducing Explanatory Interactive Machine Learning (XIL) and instantiate it in the caipi method \nas well as the rrr method .\nAfter introducing XIL, we discuss quantitative results on test datasets, before providing details on how domain experts can revise learning machines and in turn enable the machines to correct their abilities to solve the scientific real-world task of plant disease prediction. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of explaining decisions for building trustful machines via a user study.\nOur contributions thus address a main part of building trustworthy AI methods by providing an end-to-end, interactive method to evaluate and revise machine learning models.\nThis provides an important add-on to Rudin’s  message “Stop explaining black-box machine learning models for high stakes decisions and use interpretable models instead”, namely\n“Start interacting with explanations of machine learning models to avoid ‘Clever Hans’-like behavior.”\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: factors.
