      "content": "Paper Title: EI-MTD: Moving Target Defense for Edge Intelligence against Adversarial Attacks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nArtificial intelligence (AI) based on deep learning has been successfully applied in various fields, ranging from facial recognition , natural language processing [ref]2, to computer vision . With the vigorous development of AI, people are increasingly relying on the convenient services provided by intelligent life, hoping to enjoy intelligent services anytime and anywhere. In the past few years, the advancement of edge computing has moved from theory to application and various applications have been developed to improve our daily lives. The maturity of deep learning techniques and edge computing systems , , and the increasing demand for intelligent life ,  promote the development and realization of edge intelligence (EI). The current EI is based on deep learning models, i.e., deep neural networks (DNNs) that are deployed to devices on edge of networks (such as an intelligent camera of monitoring systems) to realize real-time applications such as target recognition and anomaly detection. At present, the security of EI becomes a wide concerned problem. Most previous work focuses on data privacy of EI, however, it does not pay enough attention to adversarial attacks. The previous work shows that DNNs are extremely vulnerable to adversarial examples . In image classification scenarios, an adversarial example is an input image added by some well-designed tiny perturbations to fool a DNN that is referenced as a target model. A special property of adversarial examples is transferability, implying that adversarial examples that successfully fool one model can also be misclassified by other models with a high probability . Theoretically, with this transferability property, the adversary crafts adversarial examples on a local substitute model without knowing any information about the target model 0, which is one kind of black-box attacks. Practically, the adversary attempts to find a proper substitute model close to the target model by repeated queries 1, 2, which can finally obtain a higher attack success rate approximate to white-box attacks that the adversary fully knew the information on the target model 3. Due to the limited resources on edge nodes including edge devices and edge servers, model compression is considered as an effective way to reduce the model size for EI 4, 5. However, adversarial attacks make the situation more challenging since Madry et. al 6 observed that the robustness of DNNs is positively correlated to the model size. L. Wu et. al 3 revealed that if the target model has a smaller model size, an adversarial example is easier to achieve a higher transfer rate. Thus, compressed models on edge nodes become more vulnerable to adversarial examples. Besides, although many methods are proposed to defend against adversarial attacks 6, 7, 8, 9, they merely work well on a cloud data center with abundant GPUs, which is not applicable to edge nodes. Therefore, the limitation of resources aggravates the vulnerability of EI in the face of adversarial attacks. Based on the above statement, we summarized the challenges for EI to address in adversarial settings as follows: (1) how to prevent the adversary from finding a proper substitute model, (2) how to reduce the transferability of adversarial attacks without compromising accuracy, and (3) how to defend against adversarial examples for edge nodes with limited resources. For the first challenge, we change the setting from a static target model to a dynamic setting that randomly schedules a model for classification services. Since the adversary does not know the true model served for them, they cannot estimate which candidate substitute model approximates the target model. For the second challenge, we attempt to increase the diversity of different models deployed on edge nodes. We use the gradient of a loss function as a basis of the difference measure since the current attacks mainly use gradients to craft adversarial examples. For the third challenge, we utilize transfer learning to distill the knowledge from a robust teacher model with a large size on the cloud data center to student models with small size. The benefit of this approach is that the classification knowledge and robustness are transferred as well as the size of models is compressed.These aforementioned techniques are not independent but supplement each other. They are integrated into our proposed defense framework represented as EI-MTD (Edge Intelligence with Moving Target Defense). Although there are several MTDs proposed for adversarial attacks, they are not aimed at the defense of EI. Sailik et. al in  proposed an MTDeep to defend DNN models, while our approach is different from them in two aspects. First, MTDeep merely focuses on cloud data centers, which does not suitable for EI with limited resources. Second, for obtaining differential configurations, their member models include CNNs, MLPs, and HRNNs, while we use the same type of DNNs. The benefit of our method is that all member models can perfectly serve some specific tasks such as facial recognition. Furthermore, we use differential knowledge distillation to realize the diversity of member models is more efficient than MTDeep. Similar to Sailik, Roy et. al in  proposed MTD against adversarial attacks in a cloud computing scenario which is also not suitable for EI. In addition, their member models are heterogeneous, including SVMs, logistic regression and CNNs which cannot fully utilize the advanced deep learning techniques. Song et. al in  designed an fMTD for embedded deep visual sensing systems against adversarial examples. Since their fMTD is only limited to a single device, it cannot be well extended to EI with many nodes. Moreover, they “fork” member models by retraining the perturbed base model, which cannot effectively guarantee the diversity of member models to overcome transferability. The main innovations and contributions of our work can be summarized as follows: To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a defense mechanism, namely EI-MTD for EI against adversarial attacks. We propose a dynamic scheduling policy by means of the Bayesian Stackelberg game to defend against black-box adversarial attacks. This method perfectly combines the inference architecture of EI, i.e., a deep learning model independently performs inference on an edge node, to dynamic execution. This dynamic scheduling mechanism is completely transparent to users and easy to be implemented without damaging accuracy. To prevent transferability, we propose differential knowledge distillation to increase the diversity of member models on edge nodes. Different from the Hinton’s knowledge distillation for a single model, we distillate K𝐾K student models simultaneously with a common loss function combined with a differential regularization term. In addition, this method overcomes the limitation of resources due to its effect on transferring robust knowledge and compressing models. We built an EI simulation platform with several GPU servers, PC, and Raspberry pi to evaluate our EI-MTD. A real image dataset ILSVRC2012  is used for our experiments. All the adversarial examples are generated with typical attack methods: FGSM , PGD 6,I-FGSM , and M-DI2-FGSM . Extensive experimental results show that EI-MTD can increase ∼∼\\thicksim43% accuracy against black-box adversarial attacks generated with the state-of-the-art M-DI2-FGSM. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the preliminary of DNNs, adversarial examples, knowledge distillation, and the Bayesian Stackelberg game, etc. In Section 3, the assumptions are presented and the problems we need to address are defined. In Section 4, the key techniques including differential knowledge distillation and scheduling policy in EI-MTD are described in detail. In Section 5, extensive experimental results are discussed and some interesting conclusions are obtained. In Section 6, related work about adversarial attacks and countermeasures is presented. In Section 7, we make a conclusion and discuss some future work.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Artificial intelligence (AI) based on deep learning has been successfully applied in various fields, ranging from facial recognition , natural language processing [ref]2, to computer vision .
