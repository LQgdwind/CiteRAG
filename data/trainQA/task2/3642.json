      "content": "Paper Title: Meta-attention for ViT-backed Continual Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBeing capable of tackling everchanging tasks is a favorable merit in open-world scenarios. Humans excel at solving constantly emerging tasks by associating them with previously learned knowledge. Deep neural networks (DNNs), however, usually suffer from catastrophic forgetting  if simply adapted to new tasks due to the differences between tasks in data biases. Over the past years, large pieces of literature have been devoted to addressing the catastrophic forgetting problem to enable DNNs to master new-arrived tasks in a sequence     0  [ref]41. Existing continual learning methods can be broadly categorized into three schools: replay methods   7  , regularization methods       4 and mask methods 1 0 2 [ref]41 . Replay methods replay previous task samples, which are stored in raw format or generated with a generative model, to alleviate forgetting while learning a new task. To avoid storing raw inputs, prioritize privacy and alleviate memory requirements, regularization methods introduce a regularization term to consolidate previous knowledge\nwhile learning the new task. Mask methods learn a mask per task to adapt the pre-trained model to the new task for preventing any possible forgetting. Albeit remarkable progress made in computer vision, most of the aforementioned methods are tailored for CNNs for their dominant performance in the field over the past decade. However, the primacy of CNNs in computer vision is recently challenged by vision transformers (ViTs)   [ref]45, due to the more general-purpose architecture (i.e., bridging the architecture gap between natural language processing and computer vision) and superior performance of ViTs. In contrast to the rapid development of ViTs, prior CNN-based continual learning methods appear a bit outdated as straightforwardly applying them to ViTs does not take full advantage of the characteristics of transformers. In this work, we devote ourselves to ViT-backed continual learning to keep pace with the advancement of ViTs. Specifically, we ground our proposed method on mask method 1 0 [ref]41 2 for the following three main reasons: (1) mask methods in fact dedicate different parameters to each task, thus perfectly bypassing the catastrophic forgetting problem; (2) mask methods are not sensitive to task order, which is a very favorable merit in continual learning; (3) mask methods avoid expensive data storage and exhibit a larger capacity to handle more tasks, which gives them a prominent edge over replay and regularization methods. Motivated by these attractive advantages, we propose our ViT-backed mask-based continual learning method, dubbed as MEta-ATtention (MEAT), to further boost the continual learning performance, as illustrated in Figure 1. MEAT inherits all the aforementioned merits, and meanwhile introduces the following innovations that distinguish it from prior mask methods: (1) MEAT fully leverages the architectural characteristics of ViTs and introduces the attention to self-attention (where the meta-attention comes) mechanism, which is tailored for transformer-based architectures and makes MEAT furthermore effective.\n(2) Prior methods, like Piggyback 0, require manually setting the threshold hyper-parameter for binarizing the mask. MEAT adopts Gumbel-softmax trick  to resolve the optimization difficulty of discrete mask values, which relaxes the burden of the hyper-parameter\nsearch.\n(3) Unlike prior mask-based methods where all parameters are assigned to masks, MEAT introduces masks to only a portion of its parameters, which renders it more efficient than prior methods. To validate the superiority of the proposed method, extensive experiments, including benchmark comparison and ablation study, are conducted on a diverse set of image classification benchmarks (including ImageNet , CUB , Stanford Cars , FGVC-Aircraft , CIFAR-100 , Sketches , WikiArt  and Places365 ) with various ViT variants (including DeiT-Ti [ref]45, DeiT-S [ref]45 and T2T-ViT-12  ). Experimental results demonstrate that MEAT exhibits significant superiority to its state-of-the-art CNN counterparts with 4.0∼6.0%similar-to4.0percent6.04.0\\sim 6.0\\% absolute boosts in accuracy, meanwhile consuming much lower storage cost for saving task-specific masks. In conclusion, the main contributions of our work are summarized as follows: We propose MEAT, the first ViT-backed continual learning method to the best of our knowledge, to advance the development of continual learning with ViTs. We introduce three innovations into MEAT, including masking partial parameters, avoiding manual hyperparameter setting, and meta-attention mechanism to boost the performance of MEAT. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MEAT exhibits significant superiority over its state-of-the-art CNN counterparts, meanwhile consuming much lower storage costs for saving task masks.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: in data biases.
