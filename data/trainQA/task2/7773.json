      "content": "Paper Title: Parameterized Dynamic Logic — Towards A Cyclic Logical Framework for Program Verification via Operational Semantics\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDynamic logic is an extension of modal logic by enriching modal formulas with explicit program models.\nIt is one of popular formal languages for specifying and reasoning about different types of programs or systems, such as process algebras , programming languages , synchronous systems  , hybrid systems   and probabilistic systems    .\nLike a Hoare-style logic,\ndynamic logic consists of two parts: program models and formulas.\nA dynamic formula is of the form: [α]​ψdelimited-[]𝛼𝜓[\\alpha]\\psi, expressing that after all executions of program α𝛼\\alpha, formula ψ𝜓\\psi holds. Formula ϕ→[α]​ψ→italic-ϕdelimited-[]𝛼𝜓\\phi\\to[\\alpha]\\psi exactly captures partial correctness of programs expressed by triple {ϕ}​α​{ψ}italic-ϕ𝛼𝜓\\{\\phi\\}\\alpha\\{\\psi\\} in Hoare logic .\nThis separation of program structures (α𝛼\\alpha) and logical formulas (ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi) by the modal operator [⋅]delimited-[]⋅[\\cdot]\nallows a clear observation of program behaviours throughout the whole deduction processes.\nCompared to Hoare-style logics, one advantage of dynamic logics is that with [α]​ϕdelimited-[]𝛼italic-ϕ[\\alpha]\\phi itself a logical formula, it is able to also express\nthe negation ¬[α]​ϕdelimited-[]𝛼italic-ϕ\\neg[\\alpha]\\phi of [α]​ϕdelimited-[]𝛼italic-ϕ[\\alpha]\\phi, or in its dual form: ⟨α⟩​¬ϕdelimited-⟨⟩𝛼italic-ϕ\\langle\\alpha\\rangle\\neg\\phi, meaning that there exists an execution of α𝛼\\alpha after which ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi is not satisfied.\nOperator ⟨⋅⟩delimited-⟨⟩⋅\\langle\\cdot\\rangle is helpful to express “incorrectness properties”, which\nare crucial for nowadays program analysis and verification, and which has been addressed\nrecently with the new development of incorrectness Hoare logic  . In dynamic logics, program models α𝛼\\alpha are usually regular programs with tests (e.g. in propositional dynamic logic ), programs tailored from regular programs with tests (e.g. in differential dynamic logic ), or actual computer programs from reality (e.g. in Java dynamic logic ).\nDeductions of dynamic logics are based on the syntactic structure of a program.\nThis makes compositional verification possible,\nin which a deduction step transfers proving a property of a program into proving a property of its sub-programs.\nFor example, in propositional dynamic logic , proving [α∪β]​ϕdelimited-[]𝛼𝛽italic-ϕ[\\alpha\\cup\\beta]\\phi relies on proving both [α]​ϕdelimited-[]𝛼italic-ϕ[\\alpha]\\phi and [β]​ϕdelimited-[]𝛽italic-ϕ[\\beta]\\phi, where α𝛼\\alpha and β𝛽\\beta are sub-programs of program α∪β𝛼𝛽\\alpha\\cup\\beta.\nThis also-called ‘divide-and-conquer’ way of verifying have brought many benefits,\namong which the most is avoiding state-explosion problem, as opposed to other verification technologies such as traditional model checking . However, as the development of programs and computer systems nowadays, especially as the emergence of\nreal-time systems and AI systems [ref]38,\nthis traditional structure-based reasoning supported by dynamic logics and many Hoare-style logics is challenged, because of the two main drawbacks: Firstly, structure-based reasoning requires explicit program syntactic structures.\nSo, for a new type of programs, one needs to define a new program model (α𝛼\\alpha) and carefully design a set of particular structural rules to adapt their semantics.\nThis often demands a large amount of work.\nFor example, Verifiable C , a famous program verifier for C programming language based on Hoare logic, used nearly 40,000 lines of Coq code to define the logic theory.\nSecondly, and importantly as well, some (parts of) programs or system models do not directly support structural rules.\nThese programs either do not have a syntactic structure, like neural networks 8 for example, or have semantics that do not support independent executions based on their syntax.\nIn the latter case, usually, additional processes are required to re-formalize their program structures so that structure-based reasoning is possible.\nA typical example is the synchronous programming language Esterel ,\nwhere in a sequential program α;β𝛼𝛽\\alpha;\\beta, as fully illustrated in 7, the executions in α𝛼\\alpha cannot be analyzed independently from β𝛽\\beta unless α𝛼\\alpha and β𝛽\\beta are executed at different instances. In this paper, we present an abstract dynamic-logic-like formalism, which aims at compensating for the above two shortcomings in traditional dynamic logics.\nWe call this proposed formalism parameterized dynamic logic, denoted by 𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p}.\nStrictly speaking, 𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p} is not a dynamic logic in traditional sense, but of a more general formalism, in which we assume programs and formulas are in general forms as ‘parameters’, and only keep the modal operator [⋅]delimited-[]⋅[\\cdot] in traditional dynamic logics to express program properties.\nIn order to capture the executions of general programs, we also introduce program configurations in general forms as the labels of 𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p} formulas.\nSo, a 𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p} dynamic formula is of the form: σ:[α]​ϕ:𝜎delimited-[]𝛼italic-ϕ\\sigma:[\\alpha]\\phi, where program α𝛼\\alpha, formula ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi\nand configuration σ𝜎\\sigma come from interested domains.\n(α,σ)𝛼𝜎(\\alpha,\\sigma) is thus a structure containing all information about an execution state of a program.\nFormula σ:[α]​ϕ:𝜎delimited-[]𝛼italic-ϕ\\sigma:[\\alpha]\\phi has the meaning that from (α,σ)𝛼𝜎(\\alpha,\\sigma), all terminal execution paths end by satisfying formula ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi. To see how this labelled form of a 𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p} formula actually works, let us see a simple example.\nWe prove a formula ϕ=d​f(x≥0⇒[x:=x+1]​x>0)subscript𝑑𝑓italic-ϕ𝑥0⇒delimited-[]assign𝑥𝑥1𝑥0\\phi=_{df}(x\\geq 0\\Rightarrow{}[x:=x+1]x>0) in first-order dynamic logic 9 expressed as a sequent (see Section 3), where x𝑥x is a variable ranging over the set of natural numbers.\nϕitalic-ϕ\\phi intuitively means that if x≥0𝑥0x\\geq 0 holds, then x>0𝑥0x>0 holds after the execution of x:=x+1assign𝑥𝑥1x:=x+1.\nBy applying the structural rule (x:=e)assign𝑥𝑒(x:=e) for assignment:\nψ​[x/e](x:=e)[x:=e]​ψ‾inferdelimited-[]assign𝑥𝑒𝜓𝜓delimited-[]𝑥𝑒\\begin{aligned} [x:=e]\\psi\\psi[x/e]\\end{aligned}\non formula [x:=x+1]​x>0delimited-[]assign𝑥𝑥1𝑥0[x:=x+1]x>0,\nwe substitute x𝑥x of x>0𝑥0x>0 by x+1𝑥1x+1, and obtain x+1>0𝑥10x+1>0.\nSo formula ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi becomes ϕ′=d​fx≥0⇒x+1>0subscript𝑑𝑓superscriptitalic-ϕ′𝑥0⇒𝑥10\\phi^{\\prime}=_{df}x\\geq 0\\Rightarrow{}x+1>0, which is always true for any natural number x∈ℕ𝑥ℕx\\in\\mathbb{N}. In 𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p}, on the other hand, formula ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi can be expressed as a labelled form: ψ=d​f({x↦t}:x≥0⇒{x↦t}:[x:=x+1]x>0)\\psi=_{df}(\\{x\\mapsto t\\}:x\\geq 0\\Rightarrow{}\\{x\\mapsto t\\}:[x:=x+1]x>0), where\n{x↦t}maps-to𝑥𝑡\\{x\\mapsto t\\} is a program configuration with t𝑡t a free variable, meaning\n“mapping x𝑥x to an arbitrary value t𝑡t”.\nThis form may seem tedious at first sight.\nBut one soon can find out that with a configuration explicitly showing up, we can skip the assignment rule (x:=e)assign𝑥𝑒(x:=e) and directly base on the symbolic execution of program x:=x+1assign𝑥𝑥1x:=x+1 as: (x:=x+1,{x↦t})⟶(↓,{x↦t+1})⟶assign𝑥𝑥1maps-to𝑥𝑡↓maps-to𝑥𝑡1(x:=x+1,\\{x\\mapsto t\\})\\longrightarrow(\\downarrow,\\{x\\mapsto t+1\\}) to derive formula ψ𝜓\\psi.\nHere ↓↓\\downarrow indicates a program termination.\nThen formula ψ𝜓\\psi becomes ψ′=d​f({x↦t}:x≥0⇒{x↦t+1}[↓]:x>0)\\psi^{\\prime}=_{df}(\\{x\\mapsto t\\}:x\\geq 0\\Rightarrow{}\\{x\\mapsto t+1\\}[\\downarrow]:x>0) after the execution of x:=x+1assign𝑥𝑥1x:=x+1, which is\nactually ψ′′=d​f({x↦t}:x≥0⇒{x↦t+1}:x>0)\\psi^{\\prime\\prime}=_{df}(\\{x\\mapsto t\\}:x\\geq 0\\Rightarrow{}\\{x\\mapsto t+1\\}:x>0) since ↓↓\\downarrow contributes nothing.\nBy defining the applications of {x↦t}maps-to𝑥𝑡\\{x\\mapsto t\\} and {x↦t+1}maps-to𝑥𝑡1\\{x\\mapsto t+1\\} on formulas x≥0𝑥0x\\geq 0 and x>0𝑥0x>0 respectively in a usual way: i.e. replacing every free occurrence of x𝑥x by t𝑡t (or t+1𝑡1t+1),\nwe obtain the same valid formula ϕ′superscriptitalic-ϕ′\\phi^{\\prime}: t≥0⇒t+1>0𝑡0⇒𝑡10t\\geq 0\\Rightarrow{}t+1>0. 𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p} formulas benefit from that no structural rules special for a target program are needed, but only a program operational semantics and a definition of how a configuration applies to a non-dynamical formula.\nNormally, for existing programs and system models, formalizing a program’s operational semantics (like (x:=x+1,{x↦t})⟶(↓,{x↦t+1})⟶assign𝑥𝑥1maps-to𝑥𝑡↓maps-to𝑥𝑡1(x:=x+1,\\{x\\mapsto t\\})\\longrightarrow(\\downarrow,\\{x\\mapsto t+1\\})) is easier and more direct than designing an inference rule (like rule (x:=e)assign𝑥𝑒(x:=e)).\nAs will be illustrated in Section 4.2, in some case, for a target program with a certain structure, there might exist no structural rules, or, designing such a rule can be complex. To give the semantics of 𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p}, we follow the way of traditional dynamic logics by defining a special Kripke structure based on the target programs’ operational semantics.\nAfter linking evaluations and configurations through the Kripke structures (Definition 6), we manage to define the validity of a 𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p} formula in normal sense based on evaluations (Definition 8). After building the theory of 𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p}, in this paper, we propose a proof system for 𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p}, which provides a set of rules to support reasoning via programs’ operational semantics.\nUnlike traditional dynamic logics which base on structural rules to dissolve program structures, the derivations of a 𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p} formula may result in an infinite proof structure.\nTo solve this problem,\nwe adopt the cyclic proof approach (cf. 0), a technique to ensure that a certain proof structure, called preproof, is a correct proof if it satisfies some soundness condition.\nWe propose a cyclic preproof structure for 𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p} (Definitions 11 and 12)\nand prove that the proof system of 𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p} is sound. To summarize, our contributions are mainly three folds: We give the syntax and semantics of 𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p} formulas. We build a cyclic proof system for 𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p}. We prove the soundness of the proof system of 𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p}. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.\nSection 2 defines the syntax and semantics of 𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p} formulas.\nIn Section 3 we propose a cyclic proof system for 𝐷𝐿psubscript𝐷𝐿𝑝\\mathit{DL}_{p},\nwhose soundness is analyzed and proved in Section 3.4.\nWe show two case studies in Section 4.\nSection 5 introduces some previous work that is closely related to ours, while Section 6\nmakes some discussions and talks about future work.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: verification technologies such as traditional model checking .
