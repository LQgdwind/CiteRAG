      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Better Plasticity-Stability Trade-off in Incremental Learning: A Simple Linear Connector\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, deep neural networks have been reported promising performance on various tasks. In the dynamic world, the deep model also needs to be updated as new data becomes available. Hence, Incremental Learning (IL) [ref]7  has received much attention, which studies the problem of continually learning from sequential tasks. In this paper, we consider the data-free incremental learning , where the training samples from previous tasks do not exist. Hence, the main criterion of data-free IL   is that no data from the previous tasks is stored when continually refining the model as new data becomes available. It is a direct cause of catastrophic forgetting problem [ref]24, and the plasticity-stability dilemma   is a more general problem: (1) plasticity: the deep model should learn the new knowledge of the current task, and (2) stability: it should also preserve the knowledge of previous tasks. Many algorithms have been proposed to strike a balance between plasticity and stability. An intuitive solution is to generate samples from previous tasks, e.g., ILCAN  generates samples to preserve the old knowledge. The regularization-based methods use the extra regularization term in the loss function to consolidate previous knowledge, such as EWC  using the Fisher information to calculate each parameter’s importance. The architectural methods [ref]24 learn the dynamic architecture of the deep network, e.g., DER  freezes the previously learned representation and dynamically expands the network for new task. The algorithm-based methods learn parameter updating rules to preserve the performance of previous tasks. For example, GEM  constrains new task updates which do not interfere with the previous knowledge. Adam-NSCL 7 updates network parameters in the null space of all previous tasks and achieves a promising performance on remembering previous knowledge. Although Adam-NSCL can preserve previous knowledge very well, the strong null-space projection also hurts the performance of the current task. On the other side, many researches have focused on the connectivity in neural network loss landscapes [ref]13 . The previous works  found that two minima of independently trained deep networks can be connected in weight space, where the loss along the path remains low. Further, the recent works [ref]13 and 8 showed that there exists a linear path of high accuracy to connect two minima when the networks share only a few epochs of the initialized SGD trajectory. Mode Connectivity SGD (MC-SGD)  is designed for incremental learning, which enforces the final weight linearly connected to all tasks’ minima. Although MC-SGD achieves excellent performance, it needs to store previous samples, which contradicts with our problem setting. Hence, an interesting yet challenging question arises: how to build a high-accuracy pathway between previous and current models without previous samples? In this paper, we provide a new insight to understand, analyze and build a high-accuracy connector without any previous training samples. To understand why we can linearly connect two minima of previous and current tasks, we first give a simple analysis that provides an upper bound of empirical loss for all tasks. Then, according to the upper bound, we view plasticity and stability as two independent optimization problems of deep neural networks. The two networks are trained to minimize the empirical loss and move towards each other. Finally, we propose a simple linear connector to attain a better balance between these two networks in the light of linear connectivity [ref]13. Central to our method is that we uncover a simple way to achieve a better plasticity-stability trade-off, i.e., a simple averaging of two carefully designed networks, which leads to higher accuracy neural network.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: networks have been reported promising performance on various tasks.
