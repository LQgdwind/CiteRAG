      "content": "Paper Title: DOMINO: Visual Causal Reasoning with Time-Dependent Phenomena\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs stated by Chen et al. , the goal of a visual analytics solution for causality is to support decision making in business settings, scientific investigations, etc. The authors further state that these systems should provide the ability to both formulate and evaluate hypotheses and so stimulate creative thinking. An earlier attempt along these lines is the Growing-polygons system [ref]10 which captures causality as a sequence of causal events (a.k.a., process), and uses animated polygon sizes and colors to signify causal semantics. Adopting the idea of causal graphs, Vigueras and Botia  consider ordered events in a distributed system as causally dependent and visualize their relations in colored 2D graphs. ReactionFlow  arranges duplicate variables in two columns and visualizes causal relations between them as pairwise pathways, assisting user queries along the causal chains. There are several methods that use causal models to enable what-if analyses in algorithmic decision making. Yan et al.  propose a method by which analysts can edit a post-hoc causal model in order to reveal issues with algorithmic fairness. Hoque and Mueller  allow users to interactively vary the values of a modelâ€™s exogenous and endogenous variables and observe the outcome. Xie et al.  work in a similar direction but focus on probability distributions. None of these methods consider temporal relations. Taking time delay into consideration, Li et al.  used Granger causality to measure the activity of brain neurons and built a 3D visual analytics system for this task. More recently, DIN-Viz  was devised as a visual system for analyzing causal interactions between nodes in influence graphs simulated over time. Bae et al.  evaluated representations of causal graphs and claim that arrows or tapered edges can result in better recognizability. Although effective in causality visualization, none of the aforementioned works offers an automated inference function, and so all must rely solely on user input for the initial causal relations. The first visual system with automated causal reasoning was proposed recently by Wang and Mueller 9. It utilizes constraint based algorithms and provides a set of interactive tools that allow the user to examine the derived relations. A further development of this work offers the capability of analyzing different models that may inhabit separate data subdivisions. It also improves the causal graph visualizations by expressing them as color-coded flow diagrams . As the underlying methods do not consider time, the system cannot be used for analyzing temporal dependencies.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: state that these systems should provide the ability to both formulate and evaluate hypotheses and so stimulate creative thinking.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
