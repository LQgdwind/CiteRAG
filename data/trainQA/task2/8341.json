      "content": "Paper Title: NeuroNURBS: Learning Efficient Surface Representations for 3D Solids\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBrepGen¬†[ref]47 generates B-Rep solids by progressively creating the B-Rep entities (i.e., faces, edges, and vertices) following a hierarchical tree structure from top to bottom with four diffusion models, which are Transformer-based DDPM¬†. For generating faces and edges, each node in the tree structure contains a node feature representing the global bounding box of each face/edge and a latent code for local geometry, e.g., the shape of the surface. BrepGen represents all B-Rep surfaces as UV-grids, and fits UV-grids to NURBS surfaces after generation. Here, we substitute the surface VAE model, implemented by BrepGen for autoencoding UV-grids, with our NeuroNURBS¬†(Sec.¬†3.2.3). Technically, we set the latent dimension of our NURBS VAE to dz=48subscriptùëëùëß48d_{z}=48, which is exactly the same as the latent dimension of surface VAE in BrepGen. Then, we fine-tune the four pre-trained diffusion models in BrepGen (i.e., diffusion models for face bounding box, face geometry, edge bounding box, edge geometry, and vertex coordinates) on the DeepCAD data set. We call the resulting model NURBS-Gen. As for the details, face denoisers are fine-tuned with a batch size of 256 for 1‚Äâ000 epochs, the edge denoisers with a batch size of 64 for 500 epochs, and the training is conducted using one NVIDIA A10G GPU. As for the inference, the sampling process of NURBS-Gen follows the pipeline of BrepGen and the surface decoding is replaced by the decoder in NeuroNURBS. We generate 3‚Äâ000 B-Rep solids with DeepCAD model¬†[ref]44, BrepGen¬†[ref]47, and our NURBS-Gen and compare them to 1‚Äâ000 test solids of the DeepCAD Dataset. For the DeepCAD model and BrepGen, we utilize their model checkpoint that is pre-trained on the DeepCAD dataset. Between the generated and test solids, we compute Minimum Matching Distance (MMD), Coverage (COV), and Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) metrics. To calculate these metrics, we convert each solid into a point cloud with 2‚Äâ000 points, following the evaluation method in¬†[ref]44 [ref]47. We show the results in¬†Tab.¬†3: NURBS-Gen is quite comparable with BrepGen w.r.t. MMD and COV, and slightly better in JSD values. We argue that the above evaluation method, which takes as input point clouds, might be biased toward methods like BrepGen, which utilizes UV grids. Hence, we additionally measure the Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID)¬†[ref]16 between the 3D solids rendered in 2D with a certain viewpoint. We repeat the FID calculation for 20 different viewpoints and report an average FID value, as proposed in¬† . From¬†Tab.¬†3, our NURBS-Gen has a better FID value compared to BrepGen. To check the validity of the generated solids, we first convert each generated B-Rep solid to a STEP file until 3‚Äâ000 STEP files are obtained. Then, we use the BRepCheck_Analyzer() and IsValid() functions from pythonOCC to test the watertightness of each solid. From this process, we calculate a valid ratio among all generated solids (including the ones not saved as STEP files) for each method. Again, in¬†Tab.¬†3, our method shows a higher valid ratio. Also, we visualize some generated solids from DeepCAD, BrepGen, and NURBS-Gen in¬†Fig.¬†1 and¬†Fig.¬†3(a). In¬†Fig.¬†1, we observe that BrepGen solids are undulating, i.e., they exhibit the wobbly geometry described in¬†[ref]47. In contrast, our NURBS-Gen can generate smooth and regular surfaces and accurately join the surfaces.\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: BrepGen¬†[ref]47 generates B-Rep solids by progressively creating the B-Rep entities (i.e., faces, edges, and vertices) following a hierarchical tree structure from top to bottom with four diffusion models,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
