      "content": "Paper Title: RobustEdge: Low Power Adversarial Detection for Cloud-Edge Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPrior detection works such as Xu et al [ref]12 use the outputs of multiple trained classifier DNNs to perform adversarial detection. Recently, works by Metzen et al. [ref]10 and Sterneck et al.  propose to train binary detector networks on intermediate layer activations of the DNN classifier for adversarial detection. Another work, DetectX [ref]13 proposes to train the first convolution layer of a classifier for adversarial detection using current signatures in analog crossbar arrays. All prior detection works have the following characteristics: 1) The detector models are attached to the classifier model and hence detection always occurs at the classifier (high ET,Asubscript𝐸𝑇𝐴E_{T,A}). 2) Both the classifier model and detector execute simultaneously to perform adversarial detection (high EDsubscript𝐸𝐷E_{D}). This makes them unsuitable for low power edge implementations. In RobustEdge, the detector is significantly small and is detached from the classifier model. Under white-box attack scenarios, as seen in Table IV, RobustEdge achieves similar or higher detection performance at extremely low parameter and operation footprint (100×100\\times and 10×10\\times lesser parameters and operations, respectively compared to [ref]12, [ref]10 and ) compared to prior detection works. Note, although RobustEdge’s parameter and operation footprint is slightly higher compared to Moitra et al. [ref]13, we achieve significantly higher detection performance (Table IV). Fig. 6a compares the ET,Asubscript𝐸𝑇𝐴E_{T,A}, ET,Nsubscript𝐸𝑇𝑁E_{T,N} and EDsubscript𝐸𝐷E_{D} of a RobustEdge-based classifier-edge system having a 16b edge detector with prior works- Sterneck et al  and Metzen et al. [ref]10. The detector appended classifier models of Sterneck et al.  and Metzen et al. [ref]10 are implemented on the cloud as shown in Fig. 1b. The cloud implementation is performed on a 45nm CMOS Eyeriss DNN accelerator proposed in  for a fair energy evaluation. As both prior works  [ref]10 perform adversarial detection at the classifier, natural and adversarial data are transmitted from edge to the classifier (p𝑝p= 1 q𝑞q= 1) leading to high ET,Asubscript𝐸𝑇𝐴E_{T,A}. Further, EDsubscript𝐸𝐷E_{D} in Sterneck et al.  and Metzen et al. [ref]10, are 25×25\\times and 64×64\\times greater than RobustEdge. This is because Sterneck et al  and Metzen et al [ref]10 append detector networks at the end of 5th and 11th convolution layers, respectively. Thus, they entail huge computation overhead for detection (4/7 convolution layers and the detector networks). Comparison under Black-box Attacks As seen in Fig. 6b, a 16b QES-trained detector shows high performance against black-box PGD8 attacks compared to Sterneck et al.  and Moitra et al on the CIFAR100 dataset. [ref]13. For both prior works, the detector appended to a VGG19 model was trained on natural and adversarial data xa​d​vsubscript𝑥𝑎𝑑𝑣x_{adv} using the VGG19 model. For RobustEdge, the detector was trained on natural and adversarial data generated using VGG19 model. Additionally, the black-box attacks are generated using a ResNet18 model trained on natural data using SGD.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: Prior detection works such as Xu et al [ref]12 use the outputs of multiple trained classifier DNNs to perform adversarial detection.
