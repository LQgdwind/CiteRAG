Local root\nisolation is useful in applications where\nthe roots of interest lie in a known locality,\nand this local complexity can be much\nsmaller than that of finding all roots.\n\nFrom this perspective, focusing on\nthe benchmark problem is misleading for such applications. We believe our algorithm is practical, and plan to implement it.\nMany recent subdivision algorithms were implemented, with\npromising results:\n\nengineered a very efficient\nDescartes method algorithm which is widely used in the\nComputer Algebra community, through Maple. The CEVAL\nalgorithm in  was implemented in\n .\n gave a Maple implementation of the\nREVAL algorithm\nfor isolating real roots of a square-free real polynomial.\nMost recently,\n\nimplemented the ANewDsc algorithm\nfrom 9, showing\nits all round superiority; it especially shines against\nknown algorithms when roots are clustered. Although there are several fast divide-and-conquer algorithms\n6 2 [ref]16,\nthere are no implementations of these methods.\n5 notes in p. 703:\n“Our algorithms are quite involved, and their implementation\nwould require a non-trivial work, incorporating numerous known\nimplementation techniques and tricks.”\nFurther in p. 705:\n“since Schönhage (1982b) already has 72 pages\nand Kirrinnis (1998) has 67 pages,\nthis ruled out a self-contained presentation of our root-finding\nalgorithm”.\nOur paper\n is self-contained with over\n50 pages, and explicit precision bounds for all\nnumerical primitives: we use asymptotic bounds\nonly in complexity analysis (since it has no consequence for\nimplementations) but not in computational primitives.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: ANewDsc algorithm\nfrom 9, showing\nits all round superiority; it especially shines against\nknown algorithms when roots are clustered.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
