      "content": "Paper Title: RC-RNN: Reconfigurable Cache Architecture for Storage Systems Using Recurrent Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStorage subsystems have significant impact on the overall performance of enterprise Input/Output (I/O) intensive applications. The major performance bottleneck of storage subsystem is mechanical storage devices such as Hard Disk Drives (HDDs), which suffer from limited response time. With emergence of Flash-based Solid-State Drives (SSDs) that have no mechanical components, the performance of storage subsystem can be significantly improved. SSDs, however, have several drawbacks such as reliability concerns [ref]1 [ref]2 and one order of magnitude higher price per capacity compared to HDDs . To alleviate the shortcomings of SSDs while exploiting their benefits, employing SSD as an I/O cache for HDD-based storage subsystems has been studied in the previous studies       [ref]10 . In SSD-based I/O caching architectures, frequently accessed requests are buffered in the SSD to provide fast response time while other requests are supplied by HDDs.\nSeveral application domains such as Database Management Systems (DBMS), mail servers, OnLine Transaction Processing (OLTP), and High Performance Computing (HPC) can benefit from SSD-based I/O caching   . Each aforementioned domain, however, has a distinct workload characteristic and therefore, requires a specific caching policy to fully exploit the benefits of SSD. Flash cells in SSDs need to be erased before writing.\nSuch cells can only endure a limited number of erases and hence, have a limited lifetime.\nEach cache replacement requires writing a new data page to the SSD and therefore, the number of cache replacements directly affects the SSD lifetime.\nMoreover, Due to the limited and expensive capacity of SSDs compared to HDDs, the cost of buffering I/O requests is very high. Therefore, accurately identifying the performance-critical data pages is crucial for a cost-efficient SSD-based caching architecture. Hence, for efficiently managing the\nI/O cache to improve performance while extending SSD lifetime, caching architectures should: (1) have accurate knowledge about the behavior of the current workload, and (2) be able to reconfigure themselves in case of workload changes. Such reconfiguration can be conducted by providing feedback, based on changes in hit the ratio   . Employing static flags for requests to distinguish metadata from data requests has also been suggested in the previous studies  . Moreover, in architectures such as  , cache priorities are updated periodically based on the workload type.\nIn addition, several previous studies aim to reduce the number of writes in SSD to increase SSD lifetime even at the cost of performance degradation [ref]10 . A major limitation of existing SSD-based caching architectures such as     is that they are adapted from conventional caching algorithms employed in either main memory or processors cache levels. Such algorithms depend on high temporal and spatial locality while I/O workloads mostly exhibit unpredictable behavior with no linear locality , which degrades cache performance and SSD lifetime by issuing inefficient cache replacements. To show the inefficiency of previous studies in I/O workloads, we run experiments to compare hit ratio of Least Recently Used (LRU), Access Frequency , and LARC  with the Optimal Cache replacement policy  (Oracle/Belady) under four different I/O traces from Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) . Figure 1(a) and Figure 1(b) show the hit ratio and the number of cache replacements conducted for conventional algorithms as opposed to the Oracle (i.e., optimal) algorithm, respectively. Although conventional algorithms have high hit ratio in workloads with high locality such as mail_index, they still impose significant number of unnecessary cache replacements, which decreases SSD lifetime. Moreover, under workloads such as Radius_Backed_SQL, conventional algorithms fail to provide high hit ratio due to the low linear locality in I/O requests.  \nThese experiments reveal that conventional algorithms are not efficient for SSD-based I/O caching and impose high number of unnecessary cache replacements in many scenarios. In addition, several existing architectures: a) are optimized towards a selection of workloads     or b) modify standard filesystems to provide information about request types  , which makes them heavily dependent on a particular filesystem. Unlike CPU level caches, the average response time of I/O requests is several milliseconds, which provides sufficient thinking time to execute complex computations to efficiently identify and predict workload behavior. Such predictions can help caching architectures to reduce the performance and endurance gap between optimal and conventional algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, none of the previous studies have utilized machine learning methods to achieve higher cache performance in storage systems\nwhile preserving the cache lifetime intact. In this paper, we propose the first reconfigurable SSD-based cache architecture, called RC-RNN, which tries to improve both performance and endurance of SSD-based caches by employing Machine Learning to: a) identify workload type, b) decide which data pages should be buffered, and c) decide which data pages are no longer beneficial to be buffered.\nRC-RNN proposes several request characteristics, which are used by the Machine Learning method to accurately identify the running workload.\nFor each workload type, a Machine Learning model is constructed, which performs very similar to the Optimal cache policy by deciding to ignore or buffer miss accesses and evicting the cold data pages from the cache.\nThe proposed cost function employed to construct the Machine Learning model considers several workload and storage device characteristics in order to accurately estimate the cost and benefit of buffering data pages. We utilize Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in the proposed architecture as one of the most powerful machine learning methods, which is proven to be accurate in several application domains such as text analysis  and speech recognition .\nFinding patterns in a trace of the I/O requests has similarities to both of the mentioned application domains, which encouraged us to select RNN as the machine learning method.\nRC-RNN consists of offline and online phases.\nAny time-, CPU-, and memory-consuming operations are placed in the offline phase and are done only once.\nIn the online phase, RC-RNN monitors the running workload and decides which data pages should be buffered\nor evicted based on the constructed models. To improve SSD lifetime, RC-RNN does not copy all\nmissed data pages to the cache. The data pages with low probability of access in the future are\nignored and responded directly by HDD to reduce the number of writes in SSDs. RC-RNN is designed to be reconfigurable with negligible reconfiguration cost.\n\nTo this end, it monitors I/O requests online and evaluates the workload time periodically offline. Upon detection of any change in the workload type, RC-RNN switches the loaded RNN model to match the new workload type. Note that the reconfiguration process is accomplished only by a swap of small RNN models (around 40 MB) in memory, which also can be loaded simultaneously due to low memory consumption.\n\nThe internal state of cache is also updated to reflect the workload change. The reconfiguration process enables RC-RNN to have high accuracy in various workload types unlike previous studies which are optimized toward a few workloads   . We evaluate RC-RNN by using real SSDs and HDDs\nin a server equipped with Core-i7 CPU running Linux 4.4.0 on Ubuntu 16.04 operating system.\nRNN models are implemented by using the Keras  library and the online phase experiments are evaluated only by CPU. We show that the proposed characterization method has up to 94.5% accuracy in detecting workloads from SNIA I/O traces .\nExperimental results show that RC-RNN can perform similarly to Oracle algorithm with less than 5% error in both preventing seldom accessed data pages from entering the cache and timely deciding the data pages to evict.\nRC-RNN improves hit ratio by up to 7x (2x on average) compared to state-of-the-art caching architectures. By filtering seldom accessed data pages, RC-RNN reduces the number of writes in SSD by up to 22%\n(1.7% on average)\ncompared to previous studies. In summary, the main contributions of this work are as follows: We propose the first comprehensive I/O workload characterization method, which considers long dependencies between requests. Unlike previous workload characterization methods, which only consider a limited number of past requests, the proposed method can identify several streams of requests originating from a single or multiple applications. We introduce RC-RNN, the first I/O caching architecture capable of employing machine learning methods to decide which data pages should be placed in or evicted from the cache  in a dynamic priority-based caching policy. RC-RNN constructs a model from an optimal cache policy and employs it in the runtime to decide suitable cache operations for the running workload. To improve the accuracy of the machine learning model employed in RC-RNN, we propose a cost function that considers the characteristics of SSDs as compared to HDDs to estimate the actual cost of caching, by-passing, or evicting a data page. RC-RNN monitors the running workload using the constructed RNN model for workload characterization, where once a change in the workload is detected, the employed RNN model for cache policy is dynamically changed. The performance impact of the reconfiguration process is kept as minimum as possible. We implement RC-RNN in a real system and show that the proposed architecture improves cache hit ratio up to 7x (2x on average) with negligable overhead during online phase compared to previous work. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the background and previous studies are presented. Section 3 discusses motivations of this paper.
