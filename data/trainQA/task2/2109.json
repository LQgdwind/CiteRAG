      "content": "Paper Title: Upward planar drawings with two slopes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn an ℓℓ\\ell-bend drawing of a graph G𝐺G each edge is drawn with at most ℓ+1ℓ1\\ell+1 line segments;\nequivalently, each edge has at most ℓℓ\\ell bends.\nAn ℓℓ\\ell-bend k𝑘k-slope drawing of G𝐺G is an ℓℓ\\ell-bend drawing of G𝐺G\nwhere every edge segment has one of at most k𝑘k distinct slopes.\nFrom now on and if not further specified,\nwe refer to bendless (or 0-bend) k𝑘k-slope drawings simply as k𝑘k-slope drawings. Note that orthogonal drawings are 222-slope drawings without a bound on the number of bends.\nTamassia  showed that a planar orthogonal drawing with minimum total number of bends\nof a plane graph on n𝑛n vertices can be computed in 𝒪​(n2​log⁡n)𝒪superscript𝑛2𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n^{2}\\log n) time.\nRhaman et al.  gave necessary and sufficient conditions for a subcubic plane graph\nto admit a bendless orthogonal drawing.\nFor drawings of cubic graphs in 3D,\nEppstein  considered bendless orthogonal graph drawings where\ntwo vertices are adjacent if and only if two of their coordinates are equal. Given a graph G𝐺G, the minimum number k𝑘k of slopes needed for G𝐺G\nto admit a k𝑘k-slope drawing is called the slope number of G𝐺G .\nIn the planar setting, this is the planar slope number of G𝐺G.\nBoth these numbers have been studied extensively.\nFor example, Pach and Pálvölgyi  showed that the slope number of graphs with maximum degree 5\ncan be arbitrarily large. Further results, include bounds on slope numbers of graph classes\nsuch as trees, 2-trees, planar 3-trees, outerplanar graphs    ,\ncubic graphs , and subcubic graphs  [ref]34.\nDetermining the planar slope number is hard in the existential theory of the reals .\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: be arbitrarily large. Further results, include bounds on slope numbers of graph classes\nsuch as trees, 2-trees, planar 3-trees, outerplanar graphs    ,\ncubic graphs , and subcubic graphs  [ref]34.\nDetermining the planar slope number is hard in the existential theory of the reals .\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
