      "content": "Paper Title: Patch-level Representation Learning for Self-supervised Vision Transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed self-supervised learning scheme, SelfPatch,\nthrough extensive large-scale experiments. Specifically, we compare SelfPatch with existing self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches in various\ndense prediction tasks:444Although our major focus is on dense prediction tasks,\nwe also evaluate transferring performance to ImageNet linear classification task¬†, and observe that our method achieves competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods as presented in the supplementary material.\n(a) COCO object detection and segmentation  (Sec.¬†4.1), (b) ADE20K segmentation  (Sec.¬†4.2), and (c) DAVIS video object segmentation  (Sec.¬†4.3).\nMore details of experimental setups are described in each section and the supplementary material. Baselines.\nWe consider a variety of existing SSL methods developed for ResNet¬†[ref]20 and ViT¬† architectures:\n(a) self-supervised ResNets: MoCo-v2¬†[ref]7, SwAV¬†, DenseCL 9, ReSim¬†, and DetCo¬†;\nand\n(b) self-supervised ViTs: DINO¬†, MoCo-v3¬†, and MoBY¬†6.\nWe use ViT-S/16¬† (22M parameters) and ResNet50¬†[ref]20 (26M parameters) since they are conventional choices and have the similar number of parameters.\nWe denote our method built upon an existing method by ‚Äú+ SelfPatch‚Äù, e.g., DINO + SelfPatch.\nWe use publicly available ImageNet pre-trained models for the baselines; the public ResNet models [ref]7  9   and ViT models   6 are pre-trained for 200 and 300 epochs, respectively. Implementation details.\nWe incorporate the SelfPatch objective with the state-of-the-art SSL scheme, DINO¬†, as described in Eq.¬†8, where we pre-train ViT-S/16 on ImageNet for 200 epochs with a batch size of 1024.\nWe follow DINO‚Äôs training details (e.g., optimizer, learning rate schedule).\nFor the distance function Dùê∑D in Eq.¬†7, we use the KL divergence in ‚ÑíSelfPatchsuperscript‚ÑíSelfPatch\\mathcal{L}^{\\text{SelfPatch}} following DINO.\nWe use Œª=0.1ùúÜ0.1\\lambda=0.1 unless stated otherwise (see Sec.¬†5.3 and Tab.¬†6 for hyperparameter analysis).\nThe other training details are provided in the supplementary material. It is worth noting that our choice of epoch\nis due to fair comparisons with ResNet and ViT baselines;\nwhen pre-training ViT-S/16,\nour additional self-supervision increases (around 21%) training time per epoch\nand we consider a smaller number of epoch for DINO + SelfPatch, compared to that of DINO\nfor a fair comparison.\nNevertheless, we expect that our method can be improved further if trained by 300 epochs as like other public ViT baselines¬† 6 .\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: (Sec.¬†4.3).\nMore details of experimental setups are described in each section and the supplementary material.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
