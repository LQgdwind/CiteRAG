      "content": "Paper Title: Could AI Democratise Education? Socio-Technical Imaginaries of an EdTech Revolution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe must keep in mind\nthat increasing access to education remains predominantly\na political and social issue  and that disconnection between a technology and the surroundings where it operates leads to consistent failures . AI technologies could help education in different ways, but\nthey are unlikely to offer a solution on their own.\nEven more, if AIEd technologies are not designed appropriately and collaboratively and deployed with the right infrastructure and across nations, we believe that one of the greatest perils we could face is for these to exacerbate educational inequality in the world (which could itself have many other consequences on a global scale), as well as divert educational resources that could be put to more effective uses and propagate dangerous biases of different nature at scale .\nAccess to these technologies is also about power. After all, in a society that is thoroughly permeated by technology, those who possess access to it, can influence processes and will have greater opportunities.\nVarious recent works have highlighted other challenges to circumvent before benefiting from the opportunities of AIEd. For example, IDIA222https://www.idiainnovation.org  identifies several technical challenges general to AI: availability of quality data, accountability, transparency and addressing biases. The recent UNESCO333https://en.unesco.org  and IRCAI444https://ircai.org  reports narrow down the challenges in AIEd to scalable content understanding and fact checking, learner modelling, personalised learning, transparency and scrutiny. These reports also expand on scalable evaluation, which is an essential part of verifying learning , and the need for addressing lifelong learning [ref]8. Amid the promises of technology-enhanced education, the success stories seldom benefit developing nations. To start with, there is a geographical, cultural and language imbalance in terms of open education repositories around the world . Even more, the majority of educational materials that have been accumulated via AI\nare in popular European languages, due to the narrow selection of translation models that are of current focus in the research community .\nEven among available translation models, the performance only marginally surpass \"humanly-acceptable\" level . This is far from the needed quality for learning purposes, where translation and transcription errors can easily impair the learning experience. The scientific community is also focused on introducing learner models, ITS solutions and knowledge taxonomies that are very specific to narrowly scoped datasets and technologies, giving much less emphasis to low-resource settings   .\nApart from all these shortcomings of existing research, there is a whole realm of considerations such as Internet connectivity, unequal access to digital devices\nas well as accessibility needs that need to be accommodated when innovating responsibly in this space. For example, 80% of the worldâ€™s population of people with disability\nlive in developing countries. With lack of educational resources, these communities struggle to gain the skills necessary to create a livelihood, contributing to the known link between poverty and disability 2. Assistive technology, with the help of domain clinicians can help this community and AI can expedite this process 5 (e.g. Google Euphonia).\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: personalised learning, transparency and scrutiny. These reports also expand on scalable evaluation, which is an essential part of verifying learning , and the need for addressing lifelong learning [ref]8.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
