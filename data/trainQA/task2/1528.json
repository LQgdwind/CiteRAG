      "content": "Paper Title: Explainable Artificial Intelligence Approaches: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the literature, model complexity and (lack of) model interpretability are often treated as the same [ref]10. For instance, in [ref]55, , model size is often used as a measure of interpretability (e.g., number of decision rules, depth of the tree, number of non-zero coefficients).  propose a scalable Bayesian Rule List (i.e., probabilistic rule list) consisting of a sequence of IF-THEN rules, identical to a decision list or one-sided decision tree. Unlike the decision tree that uses greedy splitting and pruning, their approach produces a highly sparse and accurate rule list with a balance between interpretability, accuracy, and computation speed. Similarly, the work of [ref]55 is also rule-based. They attempt to evaluate the quality of the rules using a rule learning algorithm by: the observed coverage, which is the number of positive examples covered by the rule, which should be maximized to explain the training data well; and consistency, which is the number of negative examples covered by the rule, which should be minimized to generalize well to unseen data. According to [ref]57, while the number of features and the size of the decision tree are directly related to interpretability, the optimization of the tree size or features (i.e., feature selection) is costly as it requires the generation of a large set of models and their elimination in subsequent steps. However, reducing the tree size (i.e., reducing complexity) increases error, as they could not find a way to formulate the relation in a simple functional form.\nMore recently, [ref]10 attempts to quantify the complexity of the arbitrary machine learning model with a model agnostic measure. In that work, the author demonstrates that when the feature interaction (i.e., the correlation among features) increases, the quality of representations of explainability tools degrades. For instance, the explainability tool ALE Plot (see Figure 5 starts to show harsh lines (i.e., zigzag lines) as feature interaction increases. In other words, with more interaction comes a more combined influence in the prediction, induced from different correlated subsets of features (at least two), which ultimately makes it hard to understand the causal relationship between input and output, compared to an individual feature influence in the prediction. In fact, from our study of different explainability tools (e.g., LIME, SHAP, PDP), we have found that the correlation among features is a key stumbling block to represent feature contribution in a model agnostic way. Keeping the issue of feature interactions in mind, [ref]10 propose a technique that uses three measures: number of features, interaction strength among features, and the main effect (excluding the interaction part) of features, to measure the complexity of a post-hoc model for explanation. Although,[ref]10 mainly focuses on model complexity for post-hoc models, their work was a foundation for the approach by  for the quantification of explainability. Their approach to quantify explainability is model agnostic and is for a model of any notion (e.g., pre-modeling, post-hoc) using proxy tasks that do not involve a human. Instead, they use known truth as a metric (e.g., the less number of features, the more explainable the model). Their proposed formula for explainability gives a score in between 0 and 1 for explainability based on the number of cognitive chunks (i.e., individual pieces of information) used on the input side and output side, and the extent of interaction among those cognitive chunks.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: In the literature, model complexity and (lack of) model interpretability are often treated as the same [ref]10.
