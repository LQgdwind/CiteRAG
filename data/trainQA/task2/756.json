      "content": "Paper Title: Sequence-to-Sequence Predictive Model: From Prosody To Communicative Gestures\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGestures and speech are related. In most cases, communicative gestures only occur during speech . They are also co-expressive, which means that gestures and speech express the same or related meanings . They are also temporally aligned, that is gesture strokes happen at almost the same time as the equivalent speech segment . Gesture strokes themselves are known to occur slightly before or at the same time as the pitch accent . McNeill  splits gestures into four classes, namely metaphorical, deictic, iconic, and beat. This classification is based on the information conveyed by the gesture. Metaphorical gestures are used to convey an abstract concept. Deictic gestures are used to point at an object or a location. Iconic gestures are used to describe a concrete object by its physical properties. Lastly, beat gesture does not convey any specific meaning, but it marks the speech rhythm. The semantic gestures (communicative gestures other than beat, also called “ideational gesture” ) are characterized by temporal phases, namely preparation, pre-stroke-hold, stroke, post-stroke-hold, hold and retraction . The stroke phase carries the meaningful segment of a gesture; it is obligatory while the other phases are optional. Successive gestures may co-articulate one from the others. That is, when multiple gestures are performed consecutively, the gesture phases can be chained together. On the other hand, beat gestures do not have a phase . They are often produced with a soft open hand gestures and mark the speech rhythm. Beat gestures can also be performed by facial and head movements [ref]29. Specifically, it is noted that eyebrow movements can be related to beat gestures [ref]29. It was observed that eyebrow movements tend to accompany prosodically prominent words . It was also observed that pitch accents are accompanied by eyebrow movements   .\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: other hand, beat gestures do not have a phase .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
