      "content": "Paper Title: SuSketch: Surrogate Models of Gameplay as a Design Assistant\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe interface design of SuSketch is aimed towards facilitating game and level design through visualizations of necessary properties (e.g. powerup counts, paths) and predicted gameplay outcomes. The responses of the user study show that designers found the more traditional aspects of the interface (canvas, pathfinding) easy to use. However, the more AI-assisted innovations (predicted metrics, suggestions) were found less easy to use and were less often used. Overall, participants in the user study possessed a high level of education and game design fluency, so it can be presumed that novices (e.g. young game designers or modders) would find some facets of SuSketch even more difficult to use. A number of extensions are envisioned for future iterations of the tool in order to address these concerns. The current metrics displayed in the first tab of SuSketch provide the basic information which is vital for level design. Due to the interplay of first-floor tiles which can only be accessed via stairs, the paths that a player has to follow to reach points of interest are not straightforward; the shortest path visualizations allow for better feedback. However, tools such as Sentient Sketchbook [ref]4 compute and visualize sophisticated path-based metrics such as resource safety and exploration which provide more informative quantitative measures and more granular visualizations. Calculating and visualizing such metrics would be a straightforward way to improve the feedback to the designer. Moreover, experiments in using visualizations of e.g. powerup safety for these FPS level layouts showed that more accurate predictions for gameplay metrics could be achieved . Including this input to the deep learning models of temporal or spatial qualities could also lead to higher accuracy in these harder prediction tasks. Currently, designers have no way of testing the game themselves, unlike Morai Maker  where the designer can at any point play the work-in-progress platformer level by pressing a button. Future work should allow a similar way for users to load the 3D shooter level and play against an AI agent acting as an opponent in order to get a better feel for the matchup. However, such an implementation is more complicated and would be slower due to the need to load 3D models, the need for an AI opponent, etc. Based on participants’ feedback, moreover, it is important to more clearly explain (either in text or via some visualization) the different roles and parameters that character classes have. Several extensions are planned to enhance the suggestions generated by SuSketch. Currently level suggestions are limited to the placement of powerups, since these powerups can severely impact the balance of the game. Moreover, by respecting the human user’s architectural choices, the designer is more likely to accept the proposed changes than if the tool changes in a seemingly random way the architecture that the human painstakingly defined . However, a different set of suggestions which apply minor mutations to the architecture, as in , could also provide some inspiration. To better ensure that the general architectural patterns are retained, the current level symmetry could be retained with a custom embryogeny  or by including it in the fitness calculation . Regarding the suggested class pairings, the process is very simple since the possible combinations are limited. Currently SuSketch focuses on the level design task, and the five pre-authored classes makes handling classes more manageable for the user. Future iterations could allow the generator to slightly adjust the parameters of a class to customize it for a specific level. However, participants’ feedback regarding class suggestions, coupled with the difficulties they had understanding the differences between classes, raises concerns whether further customizing the classes would lead to more confusion. As a final point, the current tool provides extensive feedback to the designer in many different ways (simple path operations, predictions on gameplay, suggestions for improvement). However, better explaining the AI’s decisions would help make SuSketch easier to use. Responding to a general need for explainable AI in design tools [ref]46, both the predictive models and the generated suggestions could enhance their explainability. Predictions could be explainable if e.g. an activation map  for the current prediction is overlayed on the work-in-progress level to show the areas that need to be edited the most, similar to . The suggestions could explain in natural language which of the powerups were changed, how (e.g. whether it was moved towards the center), and why (e.g. how much balance improves from this specific tile’s change).\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: the paths that a player has to follow to reach points of interest are not straightforward; the shortest path visualizations allow for better feedback.
