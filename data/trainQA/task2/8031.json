      "content": "Paper Title: Combining Neural Architecture Search and Automatic Code Optimization: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGiven the large size of search spaces in NACOS, in terms of NN architectures and compiler schedules, it is important to use well-tailored exploration algorithms. Depending on the method, we can opt for a unified exploration algorithm to search for both NN design units (operators, blocks or architectures) and compiler schedules simultaneously, or use distinct algorithms for each. The most used strategy in this context is the Evolutionary Algorithm¬†[ref]44. It can be used for both One-stage and Two-Stage search techniques. In NAAS¬†, it is used to sample (architecture, schedule) tuples for each explored hardware configuration. It can also be used for independently performing HW-NAS like in MCUNet¬†, or for applying ACO like in CHaNAS¬†[ref]32. Continuous optimization through gradient descent has also been used in¬† by making the searched NN hyper-parameters, such as the depth of the network and the per-layer width, differentiable. A notable observation in two-stage search methods is that, it is common for the search strategy in the ACO stage to be rule-based. For example, in¬†, rules have been developed to perform different compiler optimizations, like fusing convolution operations with depth-to-space operations. It is worth mentioning that some methods do not prioritize working on the search algorithm, but rather focus on designing and pruning the search space. That‚Äôs the case for¬†, where the search strategy is just enumerating random sequences of candidates from the search space and evaluating them. Even with a well-crafted search space and an efficient exploration algorithm, it is unrealistic to measure the actual accuracy and hardware efficiency metrics during the search. Therefore, using performance and efficiency estimators becomes necessary to avoid training NN candidates and executing them with sampled schedules at each search iteration. For accuracy, the dominating estimation strategy in NACOS methods¬† [ref]32  is One-shot evaluation, also referred to as weight sharing. It is often used when the architecture space Aùê¥A is a super-network, and all possible candidate architectures are sub-networks of that super-network. In this method, the super-network is trained, then the sampled architectures, i.e sub-networks, are evaluated by inheriting the trained super-network weights, without having to train them separately. It is not the only one, though. In CHaNAS ¬†[ref]32, a lookup table is used in the HW-NAS stage and a Gaussian process-based cost model is used in the ACO stage. In¬†, a NN speed model is used. Meanwhile, latency is measured through execution in¬† and¬†. Memory footprint in MCUNet¬† is also measured through execution.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: NN design units (operators, blocks or architectures) and compiler schedules simultaneously, or use distinct algorithms for each.
