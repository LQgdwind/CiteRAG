      "content": "Paper Title: X&Fuse: Fusing Visual Information in Text-to-Image Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCurrent state-of-the-art text-to-image generation diffusion models are restricted to textual inputs 9  [ref]30. Approaches that do use visual inputs   (1) do not attempt to challenge their text-based counterparts as they are usually focused on textless training, and (2) limit themselves to a CLIP 8 embedding to represent the image. Therefore, they risk information loss and are unable to process the conditioned image, in a manner that is unique to the example at hand. In this paper, we present a new general approach, X&Fuse, to utilize visual information on top of the textual information. X&Fuse (1) can fit various scenarios, (2) is able to process all of the visual information rather than just a small bottleneck representation, (3) enables full attention between different elements of the conditioned image, generated image, and text embeddings, and (4) can be easily applied to pretrained text-to-image models.\nTo demonstrate the potential of our approach, we explore three different text-to-image scenarios (Fig. 1). First, we examine our ability to augment a text-to-image model with a retrieval component (Retrieve&Fuse).\nBy finetuning the recently released Stable Diffusion model 1 with our approach, we gain state-of-the-art zero-shot FID 0 results on the MS-COCO benchmark 5 of 6.656.656.65, surpassing larger and more compute demanding models such as Imagen  (7.277.277.27), DALL⋅⋅\\cdotE-2 9 (10.3910.3910.39), and Parti [ref]30 (7.237.237.23).\nAdditionally, we show that alternative methods for fusing visual information into the generation process (e.g. using CLIP 8 image embeddings) do not yield meaningful improvements (Sec. 4). Second, we experiment with the recently proposed scenario of subject-driven generation  4, that requires the model to generate an image that is faithful to both visual properties of a subject, and a caption.\nAs there is no benchmark for properly evaluating subject-driven generation models, we create the first dataset for this task, SubGen (see Secs. 5.1 and 8).\nWe then utilize cropped images to train our model on subject-driven generation in a self-supervised fashion.\nThis yields a model that is preferred by human raters when compared with the textual inversion method  (Tab. 5), while being more than ×100absent100\\times 100 faster, as it alleviates the textual inversion requirement of learning the new subject at inference time (Sec. 5). Third, is the scenario where the user can supply an image scene .\nWe show that even though one may not expect for X&Fuse to be relevant for scene-based generation, by creating a plain RGB image from the scene information, and using it as the conditioned image (Scene&Fuse), our model achieves an impressive FID score of 5.03 on MS-COCO+Scene 5  (Sec. 6). To conclude, X&Fuse is a general approach for conditioning on visual information, that is both effective in various scenarios, and can easily be applied to pretrained models.\nAs a result, X&Fuse creates new opportunities for injecting visual cues, when generating images from captions, with both immediate performance gains and potential applications for controlled image generation.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: Current state-of-the-art text-to-image generation diffusion models are restricted to textual inputs 9  [ref]30.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
