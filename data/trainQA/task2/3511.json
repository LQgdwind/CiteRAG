      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Effective and Robust Neural Trojan Defenses via Input Filtering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved superhuman performance in\nrecent years and have been increasingly employed to make decisions\non our behalf in various critical applications in computer vision\nincluding object detection , face recognition\n , medical imaging  ,\nsurveillance  and so on. However, many recent\nworks have shown that besides the powerful modeling capability, DNNs\nare highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks   [ref]11  .\nCurrently, there are two major types of attacks on DNNs. The first\nis evasion/adversarial attacks which cause a successfully\ntrained model to misclassify by perturbing the model‚Äôs input with\nimperceptible adversarial noise  .\nThe second is Trojan/backdoor attacks in which attackers interfere\nwith the training process of a model in order to insert hidden malicious\nfeatures (referred to as Trojans/backdoors) into the model\n[ref]4 [ref]11  .\nThese Trojans do not cause any harm to the model under normal conditions.\nHowever, once they are triggered, they will force the model to output\nthe target classes specified by the attackers. Unfortunately, only\nthe attackers know exactly the Trojan triggers and the target classes.\nSuch stealthiness makes Trojan attacks difficult to defend against. In this work, we focus on defending against Trojan attacks. Most existing\nTrojan defenses assume that attacks use only one input-agnostic\nTrojan trigger and/or target only one class  [ref]5    .\nBy constraining the space of possible triggers, these defenses are\nable to find the true trigger of some simple Trojan attacks satisfying\ntheir assumptions and mitigate the attacks [ref]4 [ref]11.\nHowever, these defenses often do not perform well against other advanced\nattacks that use multiple input-specific Trojan triggers\nand/or target multiple classes  2 3.\nTo address this problem, we propose two novel filtering‚Äù\ndefenses named Variational Input Filtering (VIF) and Adversarial\nInput Filtering (AIF). Both defenses aim at learning a filter network\nùôµùôµ\\mathtt{F} that can purify potential Trojan triggers in the model‚Äôs\ninput at run time without making any of the above assumptions about\nattacks. VIF treats ùôµùôµ\\mathtt{F} as a variational autoencoder (VAE)\n and utilizes the lossy data compression property\nof VAE to discard noisy information in the input including triggers.\nAIF, on the other hand, uses an auxiliary generator ùô∂ùô∂\\mathtt{G}\nto reveal hidden triggers in the input and leverages adversarial learning\n between ùô∂ùô∂\\mathtt{G} and ùôµùôµ\\mathtt{F}\nto encourage ùôµùôµ\\mathtt{F} to remove potential triggers found by ùô∂ùô∂\\mathtt{G}.\nIn addition, to overcome the issue that input filtering may hurt the\nmodel‚Äôs prediction on clean data, we introduce a new defense mechanism\ncalled ‚ÄúFiltering-then-Contrasting‚Äù (FtC). The key idea\nbehind FtC is comparing the two outputs of the model with and without\ninput filtering to determine whether the input is clean or not. If\nthe two outputs are different, the input will be marked as containing\ntriggers, otherwise clean. We equip VIF and AIF with FtC to arrive\nat the two defenses dubbed VIFtC and AIFtC respectively. Through extensive\nexperiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that our proposed\ndefenses are more effective than many well-known defenses [ref]5   \nin mitigating various advanced Trojan attacks including two recent\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) 2 3 while\nbeing quite robust to small amounts of training data and large trigger‚Äôs\nnorms.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: recognition\n , medical imaging  ,\nsurveillance  and so on.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
