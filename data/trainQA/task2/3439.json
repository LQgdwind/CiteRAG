      "content": "Paper Title: Constant Approximating Parameterized 𝑘-SetCover is W[2]-hard\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur main technique is the threshold graph composition, which was first used in [Lin18], and has been applied to create gaps for many parameterized problems [CL19, Lin19, BBE+21, KN21]. At a very high level, this method first constructs a graph with some threshold properties and then combines this graph with the input instance to produce a gap instance of the desired problem. In this paper, we introduce a strong variant of the threshold graph and propose a new way to compose this threshold graph with the original k𝑘k-SetCover instance.\nBelow we firstly overview the proof in the work[Lin19], and then illustrate our proof for Theorem 1\nbriefly. Theorem 2 could be analogously proved by simply choosing another combination of parameters. The Original Proof in [Lin19]. The threshold graph appeared in [Lin19] are\nbipartite graphs T=(A​∪˙​B,ET)𝑇𝐴˙𝐵subscript𝐸𝑇T=(A\\dot{\\cup}B,E_{T}) with the following properties: A=A1​∪˙​A2​∪˙​⋯​∪˙​Ak𝐴subscript𝐴1˙subscript𝐴2˙⋯˙subscript𝐴𝑘A=A_{1}\\dot{\\cup}A_{2}\\dot{\\cup}\\cdots\\dot{\\cup}A_{k}. B=B1​∪˙​B2​∪˙​⋯​∪˙​Bm𝐵subscript𝐵1˙subscript𝐵2˙⋯˙subscript𝐵𝑚B=B_{1}\\dot{\\cup}B_{2}\\dot{\\cup}\\cdots\\dot{\\cup}B_{m}. For any a1∈A1,…,ak∈Akformulae-sequencesubscript𝑎1subscript𝐴1…subscript𝑎𝑘subscript𝐴𝑘a_{1}\\in A_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}\\in A_{k} and i∈[m]𝑖delimited-[]𝑚i\\in[m], a1,…,aksubscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑘a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k} have a common neighbor in Bisubscript𝐵𝑖B_{i}. For any X⊆A𝑋𝐴X\\subseteq A and b1∈B1,…,bm∈Bmformulae-sequencesubscript𝑏1subscript𝐵1…subscript𝑏𝑚subscript𝐵𝑚b_{1}\\in B_{1},\\ldots,b_{m}\\in B_{m}, if every bisubscript𝑏𝑖b_{i} has k+1𝑘1k+1 neighbors in X𝑋X, then |X|>h𝑋ℎ|X|>h. Given a set cover instance Γ=(S​∪˙​U,E)Γ𝑆˙𝑈𝐸\\Gamma=(S\\dot{\\cup}U,E) and a threshold graph T=(A​∪˙​B,ET)𝑇𝐴˙𝐵subscript𝐸𝑇T=(A\\dot{\\cup}B,E_{T}) with A=A1​∪˙​A2,…,Ak𝐴subscript𝐴1˙subscript𝐴2…subscript𝐴𝑘A=A_{1}\\dot{\\cup}A_{2},\\ldots,A_{k}, B=B1​∪˙,⋯,∪˙​Bm𝐵subscript𝐵1˙⋯˙subscript𝐵𝑚B=B_{1}\\dot{\\cup},\\cdots,\\dot{\\cup}B_{m} and |Ai|=|S|subscript𝐴𝑖𝑆|A_{i}|=|S|, the reduction in [Lin19] treats each Aisubscript𝐴𝑖A_{i} as a copy of S𝑆S and creates a set cover instance Γi=(A,UBi,Ei)subscriptΓ𝑖𝐴superscript𝑈subscript𝐵𝑖subscript𝐸𝑖\\Gamma_{i}=(A,U^{B_{i}},E_{i}) for every i∈[m]𝑖delimited-[]𝑚i\\in[m] so that in order to cover UBisuperscript𝑈subscript𝐵𝑖U^{B_{i}}, one has to pick ℓℓ\\ell notes {a1,…,aℓ}subscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎ℓ\\{a_{1},\\ldots,a_{\\ell}\\} from A𝐴A satisfying the following two conditions: a1,…,aℓsubscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎ℓa_{1},\\ldots,a_{\\ell} cover U𝑈U in the instance ΓΓ\\Gamma, a1,…,aℓsubscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎ℓa_{1},\\ldots,a_{\\ell} have a common neighbor in Bisubscript𝐵𝑖B_{i} in the threshold graph T𝑇T. After that, it takes the union of all Γi=(A,UBi,Ei)subscriptΓ𝑖𝐴superscript𝑈subscript𝐵𝑖subscript𝐸𝑖\\Gamma_{i}=(A,U^{B_{i}},E_{i}) for i∈[m]𝑖delimited-[]𝑚i\\in[m]. It is not hard to see that if the input instance ΓΓ\\Gamma has a solution of size k𝑘k, then there exist a1∈A1,…,ak∈Akformulae-sequencesubscript𝑎1subscript𝐴1…subscript𝑎𝑘subscript𝐴𝑘a_{1}\\in A_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}\\in A_{k} which cover all vertex in U𝑈U. By (a), (b) and the property (iii), these vertices a1,…,aksubscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑘a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k} also cover UBisuperscript𝑈subscript𝐵𝑖U^{B_{i}} for all i∈[m]𝑖delimited-[]𝑚i\\in[m]. On the other hand, if the input instance ΓΓ\\Gamma has no solution of size k𝑘k,\nbelow we show that every solution X𝑋X of the output instance must have a size larger than hℎh.\nTo cover the part ΓisubscriptΓ𝑖\\Gamma_{i} in the output instance, any solution X𝑋X has to incorporate k+1𝑘1k+1 vertices in to cover U𝑈U to satisfy condition (a). Furthermore, these vertices share a common neighbor bi∈Bisubscript𝑏𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖b_{i}\\in B_{i} to satisfy condition (b). This means that we could find a vertex bi∈Bisubscript𝑏𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖b_{i}\\in B_{i} with k+1𝑘1k+1 neighbors in our solution X𝑋X. Since this works for every i∈[m]𝑖delimited-[]𝑚i\\in[m], we conclude by the threshold property (iv) that |X|>h𝑋ℎ|X|>h. The reduction above fails to prove constant inapproximability of k𝑘k-SetCover under 𝖶​[ref]𝟤≠𝖥𝖯𝖳𝖶delimited-[]2𝖥𝖯𝖳\\mathsf{W[ref]2}\\neq\\mathsf{FPT} because to get a constant hardness factor, one needs to set h=c⋅kℎ⋅𝑐𝑘h=c\\cdot k for some constant c𝑐c. Unfortunately, the current construction of threshold graph has |Bi|=hksubscript𝐵𝑖superscriptℎ𝑘|B_{i}|=h^{k}. Thus the reduction has running time at least |U|hksuperscript𝑈superscriptℎ𝑘|U|^{{h}^{k}}, which is not FPT when |U|=Ω​(n)𝑈Ω𝑛|U|=\\Omega(n). Previous reductions [Lin19, KLM19] use the fact that under stronger hypotheses, k𝑘k-SetCover remains 𝖶​[ref]𝟣𝖶delimited-[]1\\mathsf{W[ref]1}-hard even when |U|=kO​(1)​log⁡n𝑈superscript𝑘𝑂1𝑛|U|=k^{O(1)}\\log n. However, unless 𝖶​[ref]𝟤=𝖶​[ref]𝟣𝖶delimited-[]2𝖶delimited-[]1\\mathsf{W[ref]2}=\\mathsf{W[ref]1}, one cannot prove k𝑘k-SetCover remains 𝖶​[ref]𝟤𝖶delimited-[]2\\mathsf{W[ref]2}-hard when |U|=kO​(1)​log⁡n𝑈superscript𝑘𝑂1𝑛|U|=k^{O(1)}\\log n (See Lemma 14 in the Appendix). Jansen and Pieterse [JP17] proved that unless 𝖭𝖯⊆𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯/𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝖭𝖯𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒\\mathsf{NP}\\subseteq\\mathsf{coNP/poly}, there is no O​(n2−ϵ)𝑂superscript𝑛2italic-ϵO(n^{2-\\epsilon})-size compression for general non-parameterized k𝑘k-SetCover, which suggests it might not be possible to prove k𝑘k-SetCover with small |U|𝑈|U| is 𝖶​[ref]𝟤𝖶delimited-[]2\\mathsf{W[ref]2}-hard. Our Reduction. Below we illustrate our reduction at a high level. We firstly define a stronger version of the threshold graph by\nreplacing (iv) with a property reminiscent of the soundness condition of multi-assignment PCP [AMS06]. For any X⊆A𝑋𝐴X\\subseteq A and I⊆[m]𝐼delimited-[]𝑚I\\subseteq[m] with |I|≥ε​m𝐼𝜀𝑚|I|\\geq\\varepsilon m, if for every i∈I𝑖𝐼i\\in I, bisubscript𝑏𝑖b_{i} has k+1𝑘1k+1 neighbors in X𝑋X, then |X|>h𝑋ℎ|X|>h. It turns out that such strong threshold graphs can be constructed using Error Correcting Codes, which was proposed by Karthik and Navon [KN21]. Then we define a new threshold graph composition which replaces ΓisubscriptΓ𝑖\\Gamma_{i} by Γi′=(A∪Bi,Uc×Bic,Ei′)superscriptsubscriptΓ𝑖′𝐴subscript𝐵𝑖superscript𝑈𝑐superscriptsubscript𝐵𝑖𝑐superscriptsubscript𝐸𝑖′\\Gamma_{i}^{\\prime}=(A\\cup B_{i},U^{c}\\times B_{i}^{c},E_{i}^{\\prime}). By choosing the edge set Ei′superscriptsubscript𝐸𝑖′E_{i}^{\\prime} carefully, we can guarantee that in order to cover Uc×Bicsuperscript𝑈𝑐superscriptsubscript𝐵𝑖𝑐U^{c}\\times B_{i}^{c}, one has to either pick c+1𝑐1c+1 vertices from Bisubscript𝐵𝑖B_{i}, or pick a1,…,aℓsubscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎ℓa_{1},\\ldots,a_{\\ell} from A𝐴A and bi∈Bisubscript𝑏𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖b_{i}\\in B_{i} such that a1,…,aℓsubscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎ℓa_{1},\\ldots,a_{\\ell} cover U𝑈U in the instance ΓΓ\\Gamma, bisubscript𝑏𝑖b_{i} is a common neighbor of a1,…,aℓsubscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎ℓa_{1},\\ldots,a_{\\ell} in the threshold graph. Suppose the input instance ΓΓ\\Gamma has a solution of size k𝑘k. Since each Aisubscript𝐴𝑖A_{i} is a copy of the set S𝑆S in ΓΓ\\Gamma, let a1∈A1,…,ak∈Akformulae-sequencesubscript𝑎1subscript𝐴1…subscript𝑎𝑘subscript𝐴𝑘a_{1}\\in A_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}\\in A_{k} be the vertices that can cover U𝑈U. By the property of threshold graph, a1,…,aksubscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑘a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k} have a common neighbor bi∈Bisubscript𝑏𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖b_{i}\\in B_{i} for every i∈[m]𝑖delimited-[]𝑚i\\in[m]. The vertices a1,…,aksubscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑘a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k} and b1,…,bmsubscript𝑏1…subscript𝑏𝑚b_{1},\\ldots,b_{m} together can cover Uc×Bicsuperscript𝑈𝑐superscriptsubscript𝐵𝑖𝑐U^{c}\\times B_{i}^{c} for all i∈[m]𝑖delimited-[]𝑚i\\in[m]. On the other hand, if ΓΓ\\Gamma has no k𝑘k-size solution, then in order to cover every Uc×Bicsuperscript𝑈𝑐superscriptsubscript𝐵𝑖𝑐U^{c}\\times B_{i}^{c}, one should pick either (1−ε)​(c+1)​m1𝜀𝑐1𝑚(1-\\varepsilon)(c+1)m vertices in B𝐵B or pick X⊆A𝑋𝐴X\\subseteq A and ϵ​mitalic-ϵ𝑚\\epsilon m vertices from B𝐵B such that each vertex has k+1𝑘1k+1 neighbors in X𝑋X. By the property (iv’), the later implies that |X|>h𝑋ℎ|X|>h. Thus, either (1−ε)​(c+1)​m1𝜀𝑐1𝑚(1-\\varepsilon)(c+1)m vertices in B𝐵B or hℎh vertices in A𝐴A must be picked in this case. To obtain a constant gap, we assign m/k𝑚𝑘m/k weight to every vertex in A𝐴A and let h=k2ℎsuperscript𝑘2h=k^{2}, m=k5𝑚superscript𝑘5m=k^{5}. It is routine to check that the reduction is FPT. We remark that |Bi|subscript𝐵𝑖|B_{i}| can be sufficiently small in the threshold graph construction. Assuming 𝖶​[ref]𝟣≠𝖥𝖯𝖳𝖶delimited-[]1𝖥𝖯𝖳\\mathsf{W[ref]1}\\neq\\mathsf{FPT}, |U|𝑈|U| is kO​(1)​log⁡nsuperscript𝑘𝑂1𝑛k^{O(1)}\\log n and thus we can set c=log⁡nk​log⁡log⁡n𝑐𝑛𝑘𝑛c=\\frac{\\log n}{k\\log\\log n}. Since k𝑘k is arbitrarily small with respect to n𝑛n, by choosing appropriate parameters, we can rule out o​(log⁡nlog⁡log⁡n)𝑜𝑛𝑛o\\left(\\frac{\\log n}{\\log\\log n}\\right) factor polynomial time algorithms for the non-parameterized k𝑘k-SetCover problem.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: this works for every i∈[m]𝑖delimited-[]𝑚i\\in[m], we conclude by the threshold property (iv) that |X|>h𝑋ℎ|X|>h.
