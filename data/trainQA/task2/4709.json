      "content": "Paper Title: High-order Multi-view Clustering for Generic Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs one fundamental task in machine learning, clustering aims to divide a collection of unlabeled objects into multiple categories. The classical clustering methods, like k‚àílimit-fromùëòk-means and DBSCN, are heavily dependent on the first-order relationships between samples. Specifically, they employ the pre-defined distances that measure the similarity between data points to perform the clustering. However, samples are not only similar to their neighbors but also tend to be similar to the neighbors‚Äô neighbors. Therefore, the first-order relationships are incomplete  and the valuable information hidden in high-order proximity should be explored.\nWe take two moons data as an example and show its KNN graphs (K=5ùêæ5K=5) in different orders nùëõn in Fig. 1. The bold red edge connects two neighbor nodes that belong to different classes. The number of wrong connections (red edges) and the ratio of accurate edges over whole ones are denoted by NwE and AccE, respectively. It‚Äôs obvious that high-order graph decreases wrong relations.\nTo incorporate high-order interactions, numerous methods have been proposed in the past decades. They can be categorized into two classes based on the used information: topological structure-based methods\nand attribute-based methods\n. The topological structure-based methods focus on graph data and obtain high-order proximity by processing the adjacency matrix.\n is a spectral clustering method for directed graph, demonstrating that high-order structure in the adjacency relationship is an important factor for clusters.  proposes a graph clustering framework that can preserve high-order structures with the help of a novel diffusion core.  regards high-order proximity as a random walk from one node to the other with different steps. A polynomial of adjacency matrices is applied to capture neighborhood relationships of various orders. However, the raw graph is often sparse and noisy, high-order information directly derived from the product of raw adjacency matrix accumulates errors, which could lead to inferior performance. Additionally, topological structure-based methods are not applicable to non-graph data.\nDifferent from topological structure-based methods, which largely neglect the high-order interactions derived from the attributes of data, the attribute-based methods can handle both graph and non-graph data. One straightforward approach to obtain the high-order similarity is constructing hypergraph.  captures the high-order correlations among samples as well as various views via a hypergraph-induced hyper-Laplacian regularization term and a tensor factorization term. [ref]6 obtains the second-order or high-order affinity by a score approximated by the Taylor expansion of solution at each iteration. [ref]7 explores the high-order relationships from local and global perspectives.  is a robust spectral clustering method through a context-aware hypergraph similarity measure, in which the affinity information from three types of hypergraphs is combined together to explore the intrinsic interactions. Although  0 show that larger hyperedges are better for hypergraph clustering, hypergraph-based methods suffer from large storage and complicated computation in the construction stage. Recently, many practical applications involve multi-view data, which provide complementary information to help improve the task performance. Different from aforementioned methods, 1 conducts multi-view clustering through self-weighted high-order similarity fusion and utilizes a cross-view strategy to get adaptive high-order similarity. Nevertheless, the obtained similarity is not the intrinsic high-order information from data‚Äôs attributes. \nTo tackle above problems, we propose High-order Multi-view Clustering (HMvC), which utilizes the powers of similarity graph to capture high-order interactions among samples. The similarity graph reflects the neighbor interactions and is derived from the attribute of data. HMvC smooths attribute through graph filtering technique and learns a consensus graph from multiple views via an adaptive graph fusion mechanism. More importantly, HMvC is directly applicable to generic data with attributed features regardless of whether they contain graph or not. We summarize our contributions as follows:\n We propose a generic multi-view clustering method HMvC, which is suitable for both attributed graph data and non-graph data. Particularly, HMvC learns clustering-favorable representations through graph filtering and handles multi-view data through its adaptive graph fusion strategy. To capture high-order information, we use the powers of similarity matrices to characterize high-order interactions. Theoretically, HMvC can obtain arbitrary-order similarity, even the infinity-order that explores all propagation paths passing similarity between samples. The proposed method achieves promising performance on both multi-view non-graph and attributed graph datasets. Our simple method even outperforms many deep learning approaches.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: is constructing hypergraph.  captures the high-order correlations among samples as well as various views via a hypergraph-induced hyper-Laplacian regularization term and a tensor factorization term.
