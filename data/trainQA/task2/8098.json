      "content": "Paper Title: Optimal Trace Distance and Fidelity Estimations for Pure Quantum States\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe investigation in estimating and testing the closeness of quantum states reveals better understanding of the power and limitations of quantum computing, and they have been shown useful both in theory and in practice.\nThere are two types of quantum input models that are commonly employed: Quantum query access model. In this model, quantum query access to quantum unitary oracles that prepare the quantum states to be tested is given.222When given quantum query access to a quantum unitary oracle U𝑈U, we also assume (by default) that quantum query access to U†superscript𝑈†U^{\\dagger}, controlled-U𝑈U, and controlled-U†superscript𝑈†U^{\\dagger} is available. For the formal definition, please refer to Section 2.1.\nIn addition to the access to U𝑈U, it is necessary to also assume access to the controlled version and the inverse of U𝑈U.\nThis is because, when only provided with access to an unknown unitary oracle U𝑈U, implementing controlled-U𝑈U is impossible , and implementing U†superscript𝑈†U^{\\dagger} is challenging [ref]7.\nAlgorithms in the quantum query access model are particularly useful in the case when the circuit implementation of U𝑈U is known.\nIn such cases, the circuit implementations of U†superscript𝑈†U^{\\dagger}, controlled-U𝑈U, and controlled-U†superscript𝑈†U^{\\dagger} can be straightforwardly derived from that of U𝑈U. This scenario is common, as most quantum algorithms are described by their circuit implementations.\nSuch quantum unitary oracles are also known as the state-preparation circuits.\nThe complexity in this model is measured by the number of queries to the oracles (including their inverses and controlled versions), called quantum query complexity.\nResearch in this model includes quantum algorithms (e.g.,  ) and quantum computational complexity (e.g., [ref]10). Quantum sample access model. In this model, quantum sample access to independent and identical copies of the quantum states to be tested is given.\nThe complexity in this model is measured by the number of samples of the quantum states, called quantum sample complexity.\nQuantum algorithms in this model include, e.g., [ref]11  . There are a few approaches for pure quantum states in the literature.\nOne of the earliest approaches is the SWAP test , which can be used to estimate the squared fidelity between pure quantum states to within additive error ε𝜀\\varepsilon with sample complexity O​(1/ε2)𝑂1superscript𝜀2O\\lparen 1/\\varepsilon^{2}\\rparen or with query complexity O​(1/ε)𝑂1𝜀O\\lparen 1/\\varepsilon\\rparen.\nThe SWAP test also implies folklore methods for estimating the trace distance and the square root fidelity between pure quantum states (see Appendix A for further explanations).\nIn , the direct squared fidelity estimation for pure states was proposed under the restriction that only Pauli measurements are allowed.\nAnother method called entanglement witness (cf. [16, Section 6]) can be used for squared fidelity estimation for some specific pure states with few measurements.\nRecently, a distributed quantum algorithm for pure-state squared fidelity estimation with independent and identical samples of quantum states as input was proposed in . There are a number of approaches for mixed quantum states.\nIn , the sample complexity of the closeness testing between mixed quantum states of rank r𝑟r was shown to be Θ​(r/ε2)Θ𝑟superscript𝜀2\\Theta\\lparen r/\\varepsilon^{2}\\rparen with respect to trace distance and Θ​(r/ε)Θ𝑟𝜀\\Theta\\lparen r/\\varepsilon\\rparen with respect to square root fidelity.\nWhen an n𝑛n-dimensional mixed quantum state is not low-rank, we can just replace r𝑟r with n𝑛n in the complexity.\nIn , they showed that given the quantum query oracles that prepare the purifications of n𝑛n-dimensional mixed quantum states, the query complexity for the closeness testing between them with respect to trace distance is O​(n/ε)𝑂𝑛𝜀O\\lparen n/\\varepsilon\\rparen.\nFor square root fidelity estimation, the query complexity was shown to be O~​(r12.5/ε13.5)~𝑂superscript𝑟12.5superscript𝜀13.5\\widetilde{O}\\lparen r^{12.5}/\\varepsilon^{13.5}\\rparen in ,333O~​(⋅)~𝑂⋅\\widetilde{O}\\lparen\\cdot\\rparen suppresses polylogarithmic factors. and was later improved to O~​(r6.5/ε7.5)~𝑂superscript𝑟6.5superscript𝜀7.5\\widetilde{O}\\lparen r^{6.5}/\\varepsilon^{7.5}\\rparen in  and O~​(r2.5/ε5)~𝑂superscript𝑟2.5superscript𝜀5\\widetilde{O}\\lparen r^{2.5}/\\varepsilon^{5}\\rparen in ; moreover, in , they showed that the sample complexity is O~​(r5.5/ε12)~𝑂superscript𝑟5.5superscript𝜀12\\widetilde{O}\\lparen r^{5.5}/\\varepsilon^{12}\\rparen.\nIn addition, if two quantum states ρ𝜌\\rho and σ𝜎\\sigma are well-conditioned, i.e., ρ,σ≥I/κ𝜌𝜎𝐼𝜅\\rho,\\sigma\\geq I/\\kappa for some known κ>1𝜅1\\kappa>1, then the query complexity for estimating their fidelity was shown to be O~​(κ4/ε)~𝑂superscript𝜅4𝜀\\widetilde{O}\\lparen\\kappa^{4}/\\varepsilon\\rparen in .\nFor trace distance estimation, the query complexity was shown to be O~​(r5/ε6)~𝑂superscript𝑟5superscript𝜀6\\widetilde{O}\\lparen r^{5}/\\varepsilon^{6}\\rparen in , and was later improved to O~​(r/ε2)~𝑂𝑟superscript𝜀2\\widetilde{O}\\lparen r/\\varepsilon^{2}\\rparen ; moreover, in , they showed that the sample complexity is O~​(r2/ε5)~𝑂superscript𝑟2superscript𝜀5\\widetilde{O}\\lparen r^{2}/\\varepsilon^{5}\\rparen.\nIn addition to the general approaches, there are also approaches for trace distance estimation in some practical scenarios proposed in  .\nSeveral variational quantum algorithms for trace distance and fidelity estimations were proposed in   . In computational complexity theory, quantum state discrimination with respect to trace distance (resp. fidelity), namely, the decision version of its estimation for mixed quantum states, is known to be 𝖰𝖲𝖹𝖪𝖰𝖲𝖹𝖪\\mathsf{QSZK}-complete in certain parameter regime [ref]10 .\nIf the quantum states are guaranteed to be pure, then the quantum state discrimination is 𝖡𝖰𝖯𝖡𝖰𝖯\\mathsf{BQP}-complete  .\nMoreover, if the quantum states are prepared by polynomial-size quantum circuits acting on logarithmically many qubits, then the quantum state discrimination is 𝖡𝖰𝖫𝖡𝖰𝖫\\mathsf{BQL}-complete .\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: of U𝑈U.\nThis is because, when only provided with access to an unknown unitary oracle U𝑈U, implementing controlled-U𝑈U is impossible , and implementing U†superscript𝑈†U^{\\dagger} is challenging [ref]7.\nAlgorithms in the quantum query access model are particularly useful in the case when the circuit implementation of U𝑈U is known.\nIn such cases, the circuit implementations of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
