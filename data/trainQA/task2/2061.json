      "content": "Paper Title: Effect of Pre-Training Scale on Intra- and Inter-Domain Full and Few-Shot Transfer Learning for Natural and Medical X-Ray Chest Images\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nScaling laws for generalization and transfer. Strong evidence that increasing model and data size for the training may result in steady improvement of generalization comes from language modeling studies systematically looking on the dependency of test error on model, data size, and compute budget used for training [ref]13  [ref]23. The experiments conducted there set up scaling laws with a power law shape and show consistent further decrease of test error when further increasing model, data size, and compute budget over many orders in magnitude hand in hand. For images, a similar line of work by Henighan et al. shows a decrease of test classification top-1 error when fine-tuning on ImageNet pre-trained generative image models of increasing size . Those works use self-supervised training of autoregressive models, in language modeling performed on text and in image domain on image patches, employing transformer networks as a backbone. Additional backup for this line of work comes from studies that revise the dependency of generalization performance on model, data size, and epoch number during training and report double or multi descent curves for the test error   . There, keeping on increasing model, data size or training time substantially also shows continuous drop in the test error pointing to generalization improvement, for instance when crossing the interpolation threshold and transiting into the over-parameterized regime by scaling up the model size. Improving transfer by scaling up pre-training. Also improvement in transfer on downstream datasets and tasks is strongly evident from large-scale language modeling experiments. In the study by Brown et al.  [ref]13, large transformer networks in the order of hundred billions of parameters (GPT-3) pre-trained on large text datasets in the order of billions of sentences were shown to have much stronger transfer performance than smaller GPT network models, measured by the test error on different downstream tasks. The difference in transfer performance between different sized models was especially pronounced in the very low data regime when doing zero-shot or few-shot transfer with only few examples available during fine-tuning. Further systematic study on transfer improvements induced by increasing scale was done by Hernandez et al. [ref]23, who examined scaling laws for transfer on language modeling tasks in the low-data regime, being defined as transfer using less than 10%percent1010\\% of the available target data. The authors have shown that increasing model size in the pre-training decreases test error on the target data, emphasizing that test error improvement cannot be observed when increasing model size and training directly from scratch on the target without pre-training. It was also pointed out that the degree of proximity between the source and the target dataset plays a role when predicting effect of the scale on the transfer performance, leading to a revised version of the scaling law that took this additional dependency into account. In the image domain, the performed studies on transfer improvement due to scale have still far less systematic character. Models and datasets used for training on images are 3-4 orders of magnitude behind those studied in language modeling [ref]13. Recently, number of works were starting to employ datasets like ImageNet-21k , YFCC-100M , JFT-300M  or JFT-3B [ref]30 that are much larger than standard ImageNet-1k to pre-train large network models on large data and observe the effect of scaling up on transfer. The work on Big Transfer by Kolesnikov et al.  performed supervised classification based pre-training on ImageNet-1k, ImageNet-21k, and JFT-300M using different sized deep residual networks (ResNets ) to study the performance of pre-trained models on transfer across different target datasets. They found consistent improvement in transfer performance when using larger models and larger data during pre-training. In the same direction, works by  [ref]30 pre-trained different sized network models on ImageNet-1k, ImageNet-21k or JFT-3B [ref]30 also observing consistent transfer improvement when scaling-up model and data size during pre-training. Studies mentioned above deal with closely related source and target datasets containing mostly natural images data. In general, various works related to testing transfer performance across different target datasets often employ targets that are rather close to pre-training source data, like studies introducing transfer benchmarking datasets that use targets resembling mostly natural image domain    or domain specific transfer studies that stay within their given domain, for instance in medical imaging . Only few studies so far attempt to measure transfer performance between datasets that are further apart, for instance natural and medical images, while systematically varying model and data size during pre-training. Work done by Raghu et al.   has found no significant difference between models pre-trained on ImageNet-1k and models trained from scratch on target datasets containing medical images. However, it was not using datasets larger than standard ImageNet-1k or networks larger than standard ResNet-50 for pre-training. Another work examines transfer on CheXpert while varying network model size during pre-training . It does find slight benefit for transfer when pre-training with larger models, however it does not vary source data size in the pre-training, using only standard ImageNet-1k as a source. A recent study by Mustafa et al. builds up on Big Transfer work  and compares transfer performance of different sized ResNet network models pre-trained on ImageNet-1k, ImageNet-21k, and JFT-300M on different medical imaging target datasets . Slight evidence for transfer improvement was observed when using larger model and larger dataset sizes during pre-training, with inconsistencies across conditions and datasets, where in some cases no significant benefit from larger pre-training scale was seen. These works all lack comparisons between models pre-trained on natural images data and models pre-trained on medical imaging data of different scale when measuring transfer performance on medical imaging targets.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: result in steady improvement of generalization comes from language modeling studies systematically looking on the dependency of test error on model, data size, and compute budget used for training [ref]13  [ref]23.
