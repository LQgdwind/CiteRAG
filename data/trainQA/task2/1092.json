      "content": "Paper Title: XLVIN: eXecuted Latent Value Iteration Nets\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPlanning is an important aspect of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, and planning algorithms are usually characterised by explicit modelling of the environment.\nRecently, several approaches explore implicit planning (also called model-free planning) [ref]41 [ref]33   [ref]32  . Instead of training explicit environment models and leveraging planning algorithms, such approaches propose inductive biases in the policy function to enable planning to emerge, while training the policy in a model-free manner. A notable example of this line of research are value iteration networks (VINs), which observe that the value iteration (VI) algorithm on a grid-world can be understood as a convolution of state values and transition probabilities followed by max-pooling, which inspired the use of a CNN-based VI module [ref]41. Generalized value iteration networks (GVINs), based on graph kernels , lift the assumption that the environment is a grid-world and allow planning on irregular discrete state spaces [ref]32, such as graphs. While such models can learn to perform VI, they are in no way constrained or explicitly incentivised to do so. Policies including such planning modules might exploit their capacity for different purposes, potentially finding ways to overfit the training data instead of learning how to perform planning. Further, both VINs and GVINs assume discrete state spaces, incurring loss of information for problems with naturally continuous state spaces. Finally, and most importantly, both approaches require the graph specifying the underlying Markov decision process (MDP) to be known in advance and are inapplicable if it is too large to be stored in memory, or in other ways inaccessible. In this paper, we propose the eXecuted Latent Value Iteration Network (XLVIN), an implicit planning policy network which embodies the computation of VIN-like models while addressing all of the above issues. As a result, we are able to seamlessly run XLVINs with minimal configuration changes on discrete-action environments from MDPs with known structure (such as grid-worlds), through pixel-based ones (such as Atari), all the way towards fully continuous-state environments, consistently outperforming or matching baseline models which lack XLVINâ€™s inductive biases. To achieve this, we have unified recent concepts from several areas of representation learning: Using contrastive self-supervised representation learning, we are able to meaningfully infer dynamics of the MDP, even when it is not provided. In particular, we leverage the work of  , which uses the TransE model  to embed states and actions into vector spaces, in such a way that the effect of action embeddings onto the state embeddings are consistent with the true environment dynamics. By applying recent advances in graph representation learning   , we designed a message passing architecture  which can traverse our partially-inferred MDP, without imposing strong structural constraints (i.e., our model is not restricted to grid-worlds). We better align our planning module with VI by leveraging recent advances from neural algorithm execution, which has shown that GNNs can learn polynomial-time graph algorithms     , by supervising them to structure their problem solving process according to a target algorithm. Relevantly, it was shown that GNNs are capable of executing value iteration in supervised learning settings . To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first implicit planning architecture powered by concepts from neural algorithmic reasoning, expanding the application space of VIN-like models. While we focus our discussion on VINs and GVINs, which we directly generalise and with which we share key design concepts (like the VI-based differentiable planning module), there are other lines of research that our approach could be linked to. Significant work has been done on representation learning in RL      , often exploiting observed state similarities. Regarding work in planning in latent spaces [ref]33   , Value Prediction Networks [ref]33 and TreeQN  explore some ideas similar to our work, with important differences; they use explicit planning algorithms, while XLVINs do fully implicit planning in the latent space. However, due to the way in which value estimates are represented, the policy network is capable of melding both model-free and model-based cues robustly.\nFurthermore, while our VI executor provides a representation that aligns with the predictive needs of value iteration, it can also incorporate additional information if it benefits the performance of the model.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: (RL) algorithms, and planning algorithms are usually characterised by explicit modelling of the environment.\nRecently, several approaches explore implicit planning (also called model-free planning) [ref]41 [ref]33   [ref]32  .
