      "content": "Paper Title: Inertial Sensing Meets Artificial Intelligence: Opportunity or Challenge?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBecause inertial motion-tracking solutions drift over time, external constraints are needed to correct the results. The commonly-used constraints are from hardware sensors and algorithm constraints [ref]24. The traditional approaches to determine whether a constraint is needed include field testing and theoretical-analysis methods such as observability analysis. In recent years, AI technology has been used to detect and use motion constraints, such as zero-velocity updates  and non-holonomic constraints , and environmental constraints, such as the interference of magnetic fields . In the paper , ANN is applied to replace the traditional zero-velocity detection method, which is based on analysis of data features (e.g., peaks and zero points), and improve the navigation accuracy in the test scenario by 34 %. When using for motion detection, one main benefit of the AI method is that it can eliminate the threshold setting for various conditions, such as different devices and different user motion types. This study claims that AI can provide better zero-velocity detection under challenging motions such as crawling and ladder climbing; however, it does not have a detailed discussion on this point. Also, the test conditions in this study are too limited to reflect the algorithm performances in various scenarios. This limitation is common for many studies that use AI to enhance inertial sensing. The research work  uses the Gaussian process (GP), support vector machine (SVM), and nuclear ridge regression to detect robot sideslip. Different from many similar works, this research conducts detection based on a regression model, instead of a classification model. The classification model only outputs one of the limited numbers of modes, while the regression model has continuous output variables. In the results, the accuracies of all three regression models for sideslip detection were over 80 %, which were close to the accuracy of the SVM classification. However, the computational load when using the regression model was over an order of magnitude higher than that of the classification model. Also, the computational load of the regression model based on GP, SVM, and nuclear ridge regression increased sequentially. The computational load is an important factor when using the AI method. For the use of environmental constraints, the research in  applies the hidden Markov process (HMM) to predict the magnetic-field interference, thereby automatically adjusting the weight of the magnetic update in the attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) algorithm, so as to obtain a more accurate heading estimate. However, this research only compares the performance of the AHRS with and without the HMM module, instead of comparing the contribution of HMM and other magnetic-interference prediction methods. Thus, it lacks a comprehensive evaluation of the HMM method compared to the traditional approaches. When using a constraint, its uncertainty for different scenarios and various sensors is commonly adjusted through manual methods in practice [ref]28. If this is the case, a priori information for the motion models and measurements are required in advance, as illustrated in Figure 6 (a). Such a requirement limits the scalability of the system. Therefore, researchers introduce ANN, adaptive filtering, and other methods to automatically perform adaptive multi-sensor data fusion  and motion-constraint uncertainty estimation . As shown in Figure 6 (b), the introduction of AI can mitigate or eliminate the requirement for a priori information on motion models and measurements. The paper  uses an adaptive Kalman filter to determine the relative weight of multi-sensor information. Also, it designs a stepped adaptive Kalman filtering to control the effect of external measurement outliers. Meanwhile, the research in  uses ANN to adjust navigation filter parameters. It used gyros with bias stability of 36 deg/h to achieve the navigation accuracy similar to a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) odometry. The position error was 1.48 % of the moving distance after 3.2 kilometers of driving. However, this paper has not theoretically explained why this performance can be achieved; thus, its performance in more scenarios needs further investigation. Also, the results can only show that ANN tuning led to more accurate navigation compared to the strategy without parameter tuning; however, they have not covered the comparison of ANN tuning and other parameter-tuning approaches. Meanwhile, the influence of the ANN algorithm structure and parameters on navigation results needs further study. In general, compared to manual operation and adaptive Kalman filtering, ANN has fewer assumptions and is theoretically more suitable for large-scale applications; however, it also puts forward higher requirements for the robustness of training data and algorithm. To integrate with inertial sensors, a variety of sensors, such as GNSS , camera , odometer , and magnetometer , have been involved. The paper  uses brain-inspired algorithms to process image data, which can provide position and attitude corrections for inertial motion tracking. Although brain-inspired algorithms are mostly used for visual navigation and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), it may be directly used to process inertial data because it contains speed and orientation modules, which are consistent with the output of inertial systems. The research in  uses long short-term memory (LSTM) ANN enhanced INS to aid the visual odometry and reduce its mismatch rate from 7 - 15 % to 0 %. However, this study did not compare the impact of ANN- and geometric-based inertial solutions on visual odometry. In contrast, the paper  uses the ANFIS to predict inertial navigation errors based on the odometer and inertial navigation states. Its principle is similar to that in . The use of fuzzy inference reduced navigation errors by 60 %. Similar to many research works, the study did not further discuss the relationship between ANN structure and navigation performance. Thus, it is difficult to predict the system performance when the training and test data are collected in various scenarios. Most related works use AI to enhance data fusion in a loosely-coupled way, such as the fusion of GNSS and inertial-based position solutions. Meanwhile, there is a small amount of research using AI in tightly-coupled and ultra-tightly-coupled multi-sensor integration. Examples of tightly-coupling are the integration of inertial sensor and GNSS  and visual sensors , while an example of ultra-tightly-coupling is that uses inertial sensors to aid GNSS receiver design . Different from , the paper  applies AI to predict the corrections of the raw measurements (e.g., Doppler observations) instead of the corrections of the navigation states. Regardless of the integration modes, most research ideas are to use AI to maintain system performance when the external measurement is not available. In general, the use of AI in sensor fusion is flexible. It can enhance not only a single sensor but also the overall multi-sensor system. Therefore, it is expected that future research will not be limited to the above aspects. There will be new AI-based approaches to enhance the performance and intelligence of navigation and motion-sensing from different aspects.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: Because inertial motion-tracking solutions drift over time, external constraints are needed to correct the results.
