      "content": "Paper Title: Inner-approximate Reachability Computation via Zonotopic Boundary Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe methods for inner-approximation computation are generally categorized into two main groups: constraint solving methods and set-propagation methods. Constraint solving methods avoid the explicit computation of reachable sets, but have to address a set of quantified constraints, which are generally constructed via Lyapunov functions , occupation measures  and equations relaxation  . However, solving these quantified constraints is usually computationally intensive (except the case of polynomial constraints for which there exists advanced tools such as semi-definite programming). The set propagation method is an extension of traditional numerical methods for solving ODEs using set arithmetic rather than point arithmetic.\nWhile this method is simple and interesting, a major challenge is the propagation and accumulation of approximation errors over time.\nTo ease this issue efficiently, various methods employing different representations have been developed. [ref]29 presented a Taylor model backward flowpipe method that computes inner-approximations by representing them as the intersection of polynomial inequalities. However, this approach relied on a computationally expensive interval constraint propagation technique to ensure the validity of the representation. In , an approach is proposed to compute interval inner-approximations of the projection of the reachable set onto the coordinate axes for autonomous nonlinear systems. This method is later extended to systems with uncertain inputs in . However, they cannot compute an inner-approximation of the entire reachable set, as studied in the present work. [ref]35 proposed a set-boundary reachability method which propagates the initial set’s boundary to compute an polytopic inner-approximation of the reachable set. However, it used computationally expensive interval constraint satisfaction techniques to compute a set of intervals which outer-approximates the initial set’s boundary. Recently, inspired by the computational procedure in [ref]35,  introduced a promising method based on polynomial zonotopes to compute inner-approximations of reachable sets for systems with an initial set in interval form. The method presented in this work is also inspired by the in [ref]35.\nHowever, we propose efficient and accurate algorithms for extracting and refining the boundary of the initial set represented by zonotopes\nand an adaptive strategy for contracting outer-approximations, facilitating the computation of non-conservative inner-approximations.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: a major challenge is the propagation and accumulation of approximation errors over time.\nTo ease this issue efficiently, various methods employing different representations have been developed.
