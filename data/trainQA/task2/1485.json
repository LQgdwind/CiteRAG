      "content": "Paper Title: Effective Low-Cost Time-Domain Audio Separation Using Globally Attentive Locally Recurrent Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAll the models were trained on 8 NVIDIA Tesla M40 GPU devices using PyTorch [ref]37 for fair comparisons. We found that the performances of all separation models deteriorated as we used 8 GPUs in place of 1 GPU. A similar observation has been obtained in  , where this multi-GPU training approach is termed model averaging. Note that it is impractical to use a single GPU for model training with its unacceptably long training time. For a fair part-to-part comparison, we report the performances of GALR under the same 8-GPU training condition, though the SI-SNRi can be further improved in the case of using fewer GPUs. For the benchmark WSJ0-2mix separation task, we referred to the training protocol in [ref]2, where clipped 4-second waveforms were used for permutation invariant training  to minimize pairwise SI-SNR loss [ref]6. Concerning optimization, we used Adam  optimizer with an initial learning rate of 1‚Äãe‚àí31superscriptùëí31e^{-3} and a weight decaying rate of 1‚Äãe‚àí61superscriptùëí61e^{-6}. The learning rate was exponentially decayed at a rate of 0.96 for every two epochs. The training was considered converged when no lower validation loss can be observed in 10 consecutive epochs. A gradient clipping method was used to ensure the maximum l2-norm of each gradient is less than 5. All models were assessed in terms of SI-SNRi and SDRi .\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: All the models were trained on 8 NVIDIA Tesla M40 GPU devices using PyTorch [ref]37 for fair comparisons.
