      "content": "Paper Title: Undecidability and incompleteness in quantum information theory and operator algebras\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGiven Theorem 4.1, in order to refute CEP, it suffices to show that Th∀⁡(ℛ)subscriptThfor-allℛ\\operatorname{Th}_{\\forall}(\\mathcal{R}) is not computable. Of course, we will use Theorme 2.1; but how? We somehow need a way to view the quantum value of a nonlocal game as the interpretation of a universal sentence in ℛℛ\\mathcal{R}. It turns out that this is indeed possible once we make a slight change of setting to that of synchronous quantum strategies. Given a correlation p∈ k2​n2𝑝superscript01superscript𝑘2superscript𝑛2p\\in ^{k^{2}n^{2}}, we say that p𝑝p is synchronous if, for all x∈[k]𝑥delimited-[]𝑘x\\in[k] and distinct a,b∈[n]𝑎𝑏delimited-[]𝑛a,b\\in[n], we have p​(a,b|x,x)=0𝑝𝑎conditional𝑏𝑥𝑥0p(a,b|x,x)=0. In the language of nonlocal games, a correlation is synchronous if the probability that Alice and Bob answer the same question with different answers is 00. Given t∈{q,q​a,q​c}𝑡𝑞𝑞𝑎𝑞𝑐t\\in\\{q,qa,qc\\}, we let Cts​(k,n)superscriptsubscript𝐶𝑡𝑠𝑘𝑛C_{t}^{s}(k,n) denote the elements of Ct​(k,n)subscript𝐶𝑡𝑘𝑛C_{t}(k,n) that are synchronous. The following result of Paulsen et. al. [43, Corollary 5.6] shows that one can capture synchronous strategies using operator algebraic notions. First, given a C∗superscriptC\\mathrm{C}^{*}-algebra A𝐴A, a projection valued measure (PVM) of length n𝑛n in A𝐴A is a tuple (e1,…,en)subscript𝑒1…subscript𝑒𝑛(e_{1},\\ldots,e_{n}) of projections131313A projection in a C∗superscriptC\\mathrm{C}^{*}-algebra is an element e𝑒e for which e∗=e2=esuperscript𝑒superscript𝑒2𝑒e^{*}=e^{2}=e. In the concrete picture, they correspond to orthogonal projection operators onto closed subspaces of the ambient Hilbert space. from A𝐴A such that ∑a=1nea=1superscriptsubscript𝑎1𝑛subscript𝑒𝑎1\\sum_{a=1}^{n}e_{a}=1.141414Note that projections are positive elements, whence any PVM is a POVM once the algebra has been concretely represented. We let X​(n,A)𝑋𝑛𝐴X(n,A) denote the set of tuples (e1,…,en)∈Ansubscript𝑒1…subscript𝑒𝑛superscript𝐴𝑛(e_{1},\\ldots,e_{n})\\in A^{n} that are PVMs in A𝐴A. Let p∈ k2​n2𝑝superscript01superscript𝑘2superscript𝑛2p\\in ^{k^{2}n^{2}}. Then p∈Cq​cs​(k,n)𝑝superscriptsubscript𝐶𝑞𝑐𝑠𝑘𝑛p\\in C_{qc}^{s}(k,n) if and only if there is a C∗superscriptC\\mathrm{C}^{*}-algebra A𝐴A equipped with a tracial state τ𝜏\\tau and (e1,…,ek)∈X​(n,A)ksuperscript𝑒1…superscript𝑒𝑘𝑋superscript𝑛𝐴𝑘(e^{1},\\ldots,e^{k})\\in X(n,A)^{k} such that, writing ex=(e1x,…,enx)superscript𝑒𝑥subscriptsuperscript𝑒𝑥1…subscriptsuperscript𝑒𝑥𝑛e^{x}=(e^{x}_{1},\\ldots,e^{x}_{n}), we have p​(a,b|x,y)=τ​(eax​eby)𝑝𝑎conditional𝑏𝑥𝑦𝜏subscriptsuperscript𝑒𝑥𝑎subscriptsuperscript𝑒𝑦𝑏p(a,b|x,y)=\\tau(e^{x}_{a}e^{y}_{b}) for all x,y∈[k]𝑥𝑦delimited-[]𝑘x,y\\in[k] and a,b∈[n]𝑎𝑏delimited-[]𝑛a,b\\in[n]. Moreover, p∈Cq​(k,n)𝑝subscript𝐶𝑞𝑘𝑛p\\in C_{q}(k,n) if and only if, in the previous sentence, A𝐴A can be taken to be finite-dimensional. Let φn​(x1,…,xn)subscript𝜑𝑛subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛\\varphi_{n}(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}) be the following formula in the language of tracial von Neumann algebras: Note that the zeroset of φnsubscript𝜑𝑛\\varphi_{n} in any tracial von Neumann algebra M𝑀M is the set X​(n,M)𝑋𝑛𝑀X(n,M). The following lemma of Kim, Paulsen, and Schafhauser [35, Lemma 3.5] is crucial to what follows: For each n≥1𝑛1n\\geq 1 and ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon>0, there is δ=δ​(n,ϵ)>0𝛿𝛿𝑛italic-ϵ0\\delta=\\delta(n,\\epsilon)>0 such that, for all d≥2𝑑2d\\geq 2 and all tuples a→=(a1,…,an)∈Md​(ℂ)n→𝑎subscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑛subscript𝑀𝑑superscriptℂ𝑛\\vec{a}=(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n})\\in M_{d}(\\mathbb{C})^{n} whose entries are positive contractions151515A contraction is simply an element of operator norm at most 111. and for which φMd​(ℂ)​(a→)<δsuperscript𝜑subscript𝑀𝑑ℂ→𝑎𝛿\\varphi^{M_{d}(\\mathbb{C})}(\\vec{a})<\\delta, there is (b1,…,bn)∈X​(n,Md​(ℂ))subscript𝑏1…subscript𝑏𝑛𝑋𝑛subscript𝑀𝑑ℂ(b_{1},\\ldots,b_{n})\\in X(n,M_{d}(\\mathbb{C})) such that d​(ai,bi)<ϵ𝑑subscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑏𝑖italic-ϵd(a_{i},b_{i})<\\epsilon for all i=1,…,n𝑖1…𝑛i=1,\\ldots,n. Note that it follows immediately that the conclusion of the previous lemma also holds with Mk​(ℂ)subscript𝑀𝑘ℂM_{k}(\\mathbb{C}) replaced by ℛℛ\\mathcal{R}. In model-theoretic terminology, this says that each X​(n,ℛ)𝑋𝑛ℛX(n,\\mathcal{R}) is a definable subset of ℛnsuperscriptℛ𝑛\\mathcal{R}^{n}. (For more on definability in continuous logic, which is a more subtle notion than its classical counterpart, we refer the reader to .) Another expression of the definability of X​(n,ℛ)𝑋𝑛ℛX(n,\\mathcal{R}) is that X​(n,ℛ𝒰)=X​(n,ℛ)𝒰𝑋𝑛superscriptℛ𝒰𝑋superscript𝑛ℛ𝒰X(n,\\mathcal{R}^{\\mathcal{U}})=X(n,\\mathcal{R})^{\\mathcal{U}} for all n≥2𝑛2n\\geq 2 and all ultrafilters 𝒰𝒰\\mathcal{U}. We now consider the set of “ℛℛ\\mathcal{R}-correlations” defined by and define Cℛ𝒰​(k,n)subscript𝐶superscriptℛ𝒰𝑘𝑛C_{\\mathcal{R}^{\\mathcal{U}}}(k,n) in the analogous manner. An immediate consequence of the above discussion is that Cℛ𝒰​(k,n)=Cℛ​(k,n)¯subscript𝐶superscriptℛ𝒰𝑘𝑛¯subscript𝐶ℛ𝑘𝑛C_{\\mathcal{R}^{\\mathcal{U}}}(k,n)=\\overline{C_{\\mathcal{R}}(k,n)}. This common set of correlations also coincides with the closure of the set of synchronous quantum correlations: For all k,n≥2𝑘𝑛2k,n\\geq 2, we have Cqs​(k,n)¯=Cℛ​(k,n)¯¯superscriptsubscript𝐶𝑞𝑠𝑘𝑛¯subscript𝐶ℛ𝑘𝑛\\overline{C_{q}^{s}(k,n)}=\\overline{C_{\\mathcal{R}}(k,n)}. If p∈Cqs​(k,n)𝑝superscriptsubscript𝐶𝑞𝑠𝑘𝑛p\\in C_{q}^{s}(k,n), then there is a finite-dimensional C∗superscriptC\\mathrm{C}^{*}-algebra A𝐴A equipped with a tracial state τAsubscript𝜏𝐴\\tau_{A} and (e1,…,ek)∈X​(n,A)ksuperscript𝑒1…superscript𝑒𝑘𝑋superscript𝑛𝐴𝑘(e^{1},\\ldots,e^{k})\\in X(n,A)^{k} such that p​(a,b|x,y)=τA​(eax​eby)𝑝𝑎conditional𝑏𝑥𝑦subscript𝜏𝐴subscriptsuperscript𝑒𝑥𝑎subscriptsuperscript𝑒𝑦𝑏p(a,b|x,y)=\\tau_{A}(e^{x}_{a}e^{y}_{b}). By passing to the GNS closure of A𝐴A, we may assume that A𝐴A is actually a von Neumann algebra. However, any finite-dimensional tracial von Neumann algebra tracially embeds in ℛℛ\\mathcal{R}, whence p∈Cℛ​(k,n)𝑝subscript𝐶ℛ𝑘𝑛p\\in C_{\\mathcal{R}}(k,n). The other inclusion follows immediately from Lemma 4.5. To see this, take p∈Cℛ​(k,n)𝑝subscript𝐶ℛ𝑘𝑛p\\in C_{\\mathcal{R}}(k,n); we seek p′∈Cqs​(k,n)superscript𝑝′superscriptsubscript𝐶𝑞𝑠𝑘𝑛p^{\\prime}\\in C_{q}^{s}(k,n) such that ‖p−p′‖∞<ϵsubscriptnorm𝑝superscript𝑝′italic-ϵ\\|p-p^{\\prime}\\|_{\\infty}<\\epsilon. Take (e1,…,ek)∈X​(n,ℛ)ksuperscript𝑒1…superscript𝑒𝑘𝑋superscript𝑛ℛ𝑘(e^{1},\\ldots,e^{k})\\in X(n,\\mathcal{R})^{k} witnessing that p∈Cℛ​(k,n)𝑝subscript𝐶ℛ𝑘𝑛p\\in C_{\\mathcal{R}}(k,n). Fix η>0𝜂0\\eta>0 sufficiently small. Take d≥2𝑑2d\\geq 2 sufficiently large so that there are positive contractions fax∈Md​(ℂ)subscriptsuperscript𝑓𝑥𝑎subscript𝑀𝑑ℂf^{x}_{a}\\in M_{d}(\\mathbb{C}) satisfying ‖eax−fax‖2<ηsubscriptnormsubscriptsuperscript𝑒𝑥𝑎subscriptsuperscript𝑓𝑥𝑎2𝜂\\|e^{x}_{a}-f^{x}_{a}\\|_{2}<\\eta for all x∈[k]𝑥delimited-[]𝑘x\\in[k] and a∈[n]𝑎delimited-[]𝑛a\\in[n]. If η𝜂\\eta is sufficiently small so that φn​(f1x,…,fnx)<δ​(ϵ4)subscript𝜑𝑛subscriptsuperscript𝑓𝑥1…subscriptsuperscript𝑓𝑥𝑛𝛿italic-ϵ4\\varphi_{n}(f^{x}_{1},\\ldots,f^{x}_{n})<\\delta(\\frac{\\epsilon}{4}) for all x∈[k]𝑥delimited-[]𝑘x\\in[k], it follows that there is (g1,…,gk)∈X​(n,Md​(ℂ))ksuperscript𝑔1…superscript𝑔𝑘𝑋superscript𝑛subscript𝑀𝑑ℂ𝑘(g^{1},\\ldots,g^{k})\\in X(n,M_{d}(\\mathbb{C}))^{k} such that ‖fax−gax‖2<ϵ4subscriptnormsubscriptsuperscript𝑓𝑥𝑎subscriptsuperscript𝑔𝑥𝑎2italic-ϵ4\\|f^{x}_{a}-g^{x}_{a}\\|_{2}<\\frac{\\epsilon}{4} for all x∈[k]𝑥delimited-[]𝑘x\\in[k] and a∈[n]𝑎delimited-[]𝑛a\\in[n]. Setting p′​(a,b|x,y):=τ​(gax​gby)assignsuperscript𝑝′𝑎conditional𝑏𝑥𝑦𝜏subscriptsuperscript𝑔𝑥𝑎subscriptsuperscript𝑔𝑦𝑏p^{\\prime}(a,b|x,y):=\\tau(g^{x}_{a}g^{y}_{b}), we have that p′∈Cqs​(k,n)superscript𝑝′superscriptsubscript𝐶𝑞𝑠𝑘𝑛p^{\\prime}\\in C_{q}^{s}(k,n) and ‖p−p′‖∞<2​η+ϵ2<ϵsubscriptnorm𝑝superscript𝑝′2𝜂italic-ϵ2italic-ϵ\\|p-p^{\\prime}\\|_{\\infty}<2\\eta+\\frac{\\epsilon}{2}<\\epsilon if η𝜂\\eta is also chosen to satisfy η<ϵ4𝜂italic-ϵ4\\eta<\\frac{\\epsilon}{4}.\n∎ Given an element p∈Cq​as​(k,n)𝑝superscriptsubscript𝐶𝑞𝑎𝑠𝑘𝑛p\\in C_{qa}^{s}(k,n), one can approximate p𝑝p by elements of Cq​(k,n)subscript𝐶𝑞𝑘𝑛C_{q}(k,n); it is not a priori clear that these approximating quantum correlations can themselves be taken to be synchronous. Thankfully, this is the case: For each k,n≥2𝑘𝑛2k,n\\geq 2, we have Cq​as​(k,n)=Cqs​(k,n)¯subscriptsuperscript𝐶𝑠𝑞𝑎𝑘𝑛¯subscriptsuperscript𝐶𝑠𝑞𝑘𝑛C^{s}_{qa}(k,n)=\\overline{C^{s}_{q}(k,n)}. The previous theorem was originally proven by Kim, Paulsen, and Schafhauser [35, Theorem 3.6] using Kirchberg’s theory of amenable traces, which was an integral part of his work connecting the CEP and the QWEP for C∗superscriptC\\mathrm{C}^{*}-algebras  (see Subection 5.3 below). A more elementary proof of the previous theorem was given independently by Paddock  and Vidick . At this point, we have that the following correlation sets all coincide: Given a nonlocal game 𝔊𝔊\\mathfrak{G} with k𝑘k questions and n𝑛n answers, we let the synchronous quantum value of 𝔊𝔊\\mathfrak{G} be given by where in the above definition we could have taken the supremum instead over Cqs​(k,n)superscriptsubscript𝐶𝑞𝑠𝑘𝑛C_{q}^{s}(k,n) or Cℛ​(k,n)subscript𝐶ℛ𝑘𝑛C_{\\mathcal{R}}(k,n) without changing the definition. By definition, we have val∗,s⁡(𝔊)≤val∗⁡(𝔊)superscriptval𝑠𝔊superscriptval𝔊\\operatorname{val}^{*,s}(\\mathfrak{G})\\leq\\operatorname{val}^{*}(\\mathfrak{G}) for all nonlocal games 𝔊𝔊\\mathfrak{G}. A crucial fact, a byproduct of the proof of Theorem 2.1, is the following: Theorem 2.1 remains true with val∗superscriptval\\operatorname{val}^{*} replaced by val∗,ssuperscriptval𝑠\\operatorname{val}^{*,s}. Given a nonlocal game 𝔊=(π𝔊,D𝔊)𝔊subscript𝜋𝔊subscript𝐷𝔊\\mathfrak{G}=(\\pi_{\\mathfrak{G}},D_{\\mathfrak{G}}) with k𝑘k questions and n𝑛n answers, we let z→→𝑧\\vec{z} denote the tuple of variables labeled by zaxsubscriptsuperscript𝑧𝑥𝑎z^{x}_{a} for x∈[k]𝑥delimited-[]𝑘x\\in[k] and a∈[n]𝑎delimited-[]𝑛a\\in[n] and let Θ𝔊​(z→)subscriptΘ𝔊→𝑧\\Theta_{\\mathfrak{G}}(\\vec{z}) denote the quantifier-free formula By the above discussion, we have that val∗,s⁡(𝔊)=supe→∈X​(n,ℛ)kΘ𝔊ℛ​(e→)superscriptval𝑠𝔊subscriptsupremum→𝑒𝑋superscript𝑛ℛ𝑘superscriptsubscriptΘ𝔊ℛ→𝑒\\operatorname{val}^{*,s}(\\mathfrak{G})=\\sup_{\\vec{e}\\in X(n,\\mathcal{R})^{k}}\\Theta_{\\mathfrak{G}}^{\\mathcal{R}}(\\vec{e}). An important fact about definable sets in continuous logic is that they are the sets that one can “quantify over.” More precisely (and specializing to our context), since X​(n,ℛ)k𝑋superscript𝑛ℛ𝑘X(n,\\mathcal{R})^{k} is a definable subset of ℛn​ksuperscriptℛ𝑛𝑘\\mathcal{R}^{nk}, given any η>0𝜂0\\eta>0, there is a sentence Ψ𝔊,ηsubscriptΨ𝔊𝜂\\Psi_{\\mathfrak{G},\\eta} such that |val∗,s⁡(𝔊)−Ψ𝔊,ηℛ|<ηsuperscriptval𝑠𝔊superscriptsubscriptΨ𝔊𝜂ℛ𝜂|\\operatorname{val}^{*,s}(\\mathfrak{G})-\\Psi_{\\mathfrak{G},\\eta}^{\\mathcal{R}}|<\\eta. Moreover, a careful analysis of the proof of the existence of the sentences Ψ𝔊,ηsubscriptΨ𝔊𝜂\\Psi_{\\mathfrak{G},\\eta}, together with the fact that the function δ​(n,ϵ)𝛿𝑛italic-ϵ\\delta(n,\\epsilon) appearing in Lemma 4.5 is computable (as can be easily verified from the proof given in ), yields that the assignment (𝔊,η)↦Ψ𝔊,ηmaps-to𝔊𝜂subscriptΨ𝔊𝜂(\\mathfrak{G},\\eta)\\mapsto\\Psi_{\\mathfrak{G},\\eta} is computable. Moreover, it can also be verified that the sentences Ψ𝔊,ηsubscriptΨ𝔊𝜂\\Psi_{\\mathfrak{G},\\eta} are universal! Consequently, if Th∀⁡(ℛ)subscriptThfor-allℛ\\operatorname{Th}_{\\forall}(\\mathcal{R}) were computable, one could effectively approximate, say, Ψ𝔊,14subscriptΨ𝔊14\\Psi_{\\mathfrak{G},\\frac{1}{4}}, to within 1414\\frac{1}{4}, and could thus decide whether or not val∗,s⁡(𝔊)superscriptval𝑠𝔊\\operatorname{val}^{*,s}(\\mathfrak{G}) is bounded by 1212\\frac{1}{2} or equal to 111, contradicting Theorem 4.8. We have just established: Th∀⁡(ℛ)subscriptThfor-allℛ\\operatorname{Th}_{\\forall}(\\mathcal{R}) is not computable, whence the CEP has a negative solution. In fact, keeping in mind Corollary 4.3, we have the following “Gödelian refutation” of the CEP: There does not exist a c.e. set T𝑇T of sentences in the language of tracial von Neumann algebras such that ℛ⊧Tmodelsℛ𝑇\\mathcal{R}\\models T and such that all models of T𝑇T embed in an ultrapower of ℛℛ\\mathcal{R}. In [ref]27, for a structure A𝐴A in some language, we defined the A𝐴AEP to be the statement that there is a c.e.set T𝑇T of sentences such that A⊧Tmodels𝐴𝑇A\\models T and such that all models of T𝑇T embed in an ultrapower of A𝐴A. Thus, we have just established that the ℛℛ\\mathcal{R}EP has a negative solution. We will show that the A𝐴AEP has a negative solution for a handful of other important operator algebras below. Note that if the A𝐴AEP has a negative solution then, in particular, the universal theory of A𝐴A is not right c.e. We remark in the special case of ℛℛ\\mathcal{R} that one does not need ℛ⊧Tmodelsℛ𝑇\\mathcal{R}\\models T but rather only that T𝑇T extends the theory of II1 factors, whence we obtain: There does not exist a c.e. set T𝑇T of sentences extending the theory of II1 factors all of whose models embed in an ultrapower of ℛℛ\\mathcal{R}.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: a c.e. set T𝑇T of sentences in the language of tracial von Neumann algebras such that ℛ⊧Tmodelsℛ𝑇\\mathcal{R}\\models T and such that all models of T𝑇T embed in an ultrapower of ℛℛ\\mathcal{R}.
