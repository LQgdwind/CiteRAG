      "content": "Paper Title: Improved Adversarial Training Through Adaptive Instance-wise Loss Smoothing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAdversarial training is usually categorized as single-step and mutli-step AT according to the number of iterations used for crafting training adversarial examples. The common single-step and multi-step adversaries are Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) [ref]1 and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) . FGSM uses the sign of the loss gradients w.r.t. the input as the adversarial direction. PGD can be considered as an iterative version of FGSM where the perturbation is projected back onto the ℓ∞subscriptℓ\\ell_{\\infty}-norm ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-ball at the end of each iteration. For brevity a number is appended to the abbreviation PGD to indicate the number of steps performed when searching for an adversarial image. Hence, for example, PGD50 is used to denote a PGD attack with 50 steps throughout the text. AT is prone to overfitting, which is known as robust overfitting . Specifically, test adversarial robustness degenerates while training adversarial loss declines during the later stage of training. Robust overfitting significantly impairs the performance of AT. It has been shown previously that adversarial robustness is related to the smoothness of the model’s loss landscape w.r.t. the input   and the model weights [ref]9. Therefore, we summarize existing methods for adversarial robustness in two categories: input loss smoothing and weight loss smoothing. For input loss smoothing, one approach is explicitly regularizing the logits [ref]14 or the gradients  of each training sample to be the same as any of their neighbor samples within a certain distance. Besides, AT can be concerned as an implicit input loss smoothness regularizer and the strength of regularization is controlled by the direction and the size of perturbation [ref]14.\nRegarding weight loss smoothing, Adversarial Weight Perturbation (AWP) [ref]9 injects adversarial perturbation into model weights to implicitly smooth weight loss. RWP  found that applying adversarial weight perturbation to only small-loss samples leads to an improved robustness compared to AWP.\nAlternatively, Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA)  smooths weight by exponentially averaging checkpoints along the training trajectory. Our regularizer combines logit regularization and AWP together to jointly smooth both input and weight loss in a more effective way. Many strategies have been proposed to improve AT by regularizing instances unequally. One popular strategy is to adapt the size of the adversarial input perturbation, and so the strength of regularization, to the difficulty of crafting successful adversarial examples. Typically, large perturbations are assigned to hard-to-attack samples in order to produce successful adversarial examples for more effective AT. In tandem, small perturbations are assigned to easy-to-attack samples in order to alleviate over-regularization for a better trade-off between accuracy and robustness. The size of perturbation can be controlled by the number of steps , the perturbation budget    or an extra scaling factor .\nFurthermore, this strategy has been also applied to weight loss smoothing in RWP .\nWe argue that this strategy contradicts our finding that hard-to-attack (low-vulnerability in our terms) samples have already been over-regularized so their regularization strength should not be further enlarged. The most similar methods to ours are MART  and GAIRAT . MART regularizes KL-divergence between the logit of clean and corresponding adversarial examples, weighted by one minus the prediction confidence on clean examples. Hence, instances with lower clean prediction confidence receive stronger regularization. GAIRAT directly weights the adversarial loss of instances based on their geometric distance to the decision bound, which is measured by the number of iterations required for a successful attack. Instances closer to decision bound (less iterations) are weighted more.\nAlthough there is a connection among prediction confidence, geometric distance and adversarial vulnerability (ours), they are essentially different metrics and the weight schemes based on them thus perform differently.\nRegarding GAIRAT, the computation of geometric distance deeply depends on the training adversary, and hence, severely limits its application, e.g., it can not be applied to single-step AT without using an extra multi-step adversary.\nAnother similar work is InfoAT  which like the proposed method uses logit stability regularization, but weights regularization according to the mutual information of clean examples. In contrast to the manually crafted strategies described above, LAS-AT  customizes adversarial attack automatically for each instance in a generative adversarial style. The parameters of the attacker, such as the perturbation budget for each instance, are generated on-the-fly by a separate strategy network, which is jointly trained alongside the classification network to maximize adversarial loss, i.e., produce stronger adversarial examples. This approach is more complicated than the alternatives, including ours, and potentially suffers from similar instability issues to GANs . AT can benefit from using more training data to enhance robust generalization. This was theoretically proved for simplified settings like Gaussian models . For complicated but realistic settings, training with extra data from either real , or synthetic , sources dramatically boosts the robust performance of AT and thus becomes a necessary ingredient for achieving state-of-the-art results. However, extra data is usually very expensive or even infeasible to acquire in many tasks, so  proposes a new data augmentation method, IDBH, specifically designed for AT. Our method is complementary to using extra data and data augmentation and a further boost in robustness is observed when they are combined together (see Section 5.1).\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: and mutli-step AT according to the number of iterations used for crafting training adversarial examples.
