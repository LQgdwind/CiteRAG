      "content": "Paper Title: Public Transit Arrival Prediction: a Seq2Seq RNN Approach†\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConstantly increasing traffic congestion levels is a perennial problem across geographies on account of steadily increasing urban population and\nassociated traffic volumes. Enhancing the public transit standard is one promising approach to mitigate this ubiquitous problem.\nThis not only reduces traffic volumes and\ncongestion in turn, but would also curtail pollution.\nPublic transit needs to be reliable to remain attractive among commuters. This would mean maintaining schedules to the extent feasible\nand providing accurate arrival time predictions in real-time. Such accurate estimates can aid commuters plan their arrival to bus-stops and minimize waiting times. Bus travel\ntime predictions can also aid passengers who plan/decide to board a bus based on predictions to reach a desired destination bus-stop. The bus arrival time prediction (BATP) can potentially\nalso aid transport administrators take real-time corrective measures when the bus is off schedule. Hence providing quality BATPs is crucial for reliable mass\ntransit. Literature around BATP research is about two decades old. In developed countries, it is arguably a well solved problem. However, it continues to be a challenging\nresearch problem in the context of\ndeveloping economies.\nThe main factors contributing to this include (1)lack of lane discipline (2) in-homogeneity of\ntraffic (i.e. transport modes can range from bicycles, two wheelers to heavy vehicles like trucks and buses) with dedicated lanes absent for specific modes\nof transport.\nWe refer to this as\nmixed traffic conditions.\nThe real data we consider in this paper is from a bus route in Delhi, the capital of India which routinely experiences such conditions.\nAny google-map based bus travel time query (in most cities in India including Delhi) has till recently mostly returned a constant prediction irrespective of the\ndate or time of\nquery. These returned (fixed) travel times seem to be based on some pre-fixed schedules which are almost unimplementable given the chaotic nature of traffic here.\nFurther, ETA (Expected time of arrival) solutions are still being continuosly improved upon by Google at a network level across the world for different modes of urban transport[ref]1 .\nOwing to these aforementioned factors,\nBATP is still a challenging research problem  especially under mixed traffic conditions  . The BATP literature has seen a wide range of methods over the years. A broad predominant line of attack comes from the class of data-driven methods.\nMost of these segment an entire route into smaller segments (or sections) either uniformly  OR based on non-uniform segments connecting\nsuccessive bus-stops.\nThe data input in such methods can range over entities like flow, density, speed, travel time etc. depending on the sensing infrastructure\nin place and the algorithm. In this work, we consider\nscenarios where input data comes only from travel times experienced at each of these sections/segments.\nSuch travel times can be easily obtained from AVL (automatic vehicle location) data gathered via GPS sensing. Gaps and Contributions: Existing\ndata-driven methods for BATP have adopted a diverse range of techniques which include ARIMA models , linear statistical models like Kalman filters\n , support vector machines   , feed-forward ANNs [ref]12 ,\nrecurrent neural networks  , CNNs , temporal difference learning and so on. Most of the existing approaches suffer from a variety of issues\nlike (i)not exploiting the historical\ndata sufficiently for model calibration    OR (ii)do not exploit spatial correlations   \n(iii) fail to capture temporal correlations([ref]12 ) (iv)do\nnot exploit the current real-time information sufficiently(0). (v)segment the time-axis into uniform bins, which can lead to inaccurate\npredictions . There has been some recent work on exploiting\nspatio-temporal correlations      as well in this direction. From an RNN literature perspective, there’s been recent work where people have explored ED (also known as Seq2Seq) architectures for real-valued data\n1 2 (time-series (TS) in particular).\nHowever, employing a Seq2Seq (ED) architecture for BATP as prescribed in these time-series approaches is not immediately evident due to\ndifference in\nstructure of\navailable data between BATP and traditional time-series. In particular, GPS based data has a unique spatio-temporal aspect with information scattered\nacross trips throughout the day. The current work proposes a novel ED architecture (different from classical machine translation architecture OR existing\nED approaches for time-series)\nwhich is also distinct from all existing BATP approaches (in particular from ED based BATP approaches also  ). It exploits current real-time\nspatio-temporal correlations and historical seasonal correlations for nonlinear modelling and prediction. Specifically We recast the real-time BATP problem to a novel and unique Encoder-Decoder framework with real-time spatio-temporal inputs and historical seasonal inputs carefully placed in the architecture. The proposed ED model’s sequential aspect is mapped to the spatial dimension of BATP, while the temporal aspects of BATP are captured by feeding the associated inputs as decoder inputs in a space synchronized fashion. The (multiple) targets of the real-time BATP prediction task are intelligently mapped to the outputs of the decoder sequentially. Travel times from the just traversed sections of current bus (constitute the spatial correlations) are fed as inputs to the\nencoder. While real-time information coming from previous bus’s travel times across subsequent sections (constituting\ntemporal correlations) are fed in a synchronized sequential fashion into the decoder as additional inputs. Note that these synchronised inputs at the decoder are absent in the classic ED application for machine translation 3 4. The section travel times (of current bus) across subsequent sections are the prediction targets which are neatly mapped to the decoder outputs sequentially. Weekly seasonal correlations are also incorporated via additional inputs from the closest trip of the previous week.\n We propose a bidirectional layer at the decoder as this can now capture (for a given section) the possible upstream influence of past\ncongestions (in time) across the subsequent sections propagating backward in space (along the bus route). This feature of our ED architecture is unexplored\nin other time-series based applications of ED to the best of our knowledge. We demonstrate the proposed approach’s effectiveness on real field data gathered from a route in a mixed traffic condition\nfrom Delhi. Our\nexperiments clearly illustrate superior performance of the proposed method\ncompared to state-of-art baselines.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: of traffic here.\nFurther, ETA (Expected time of arrival) solutions are still being continuosly improved upon by Google at a network level across the world for different modes of urban transport[ref]1 .\nOwing to these aforementioned factors,\nBATP is still a challenging research problem  especially under mixed traffic conditions  .
