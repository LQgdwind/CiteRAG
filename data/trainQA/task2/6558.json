Set-level of MMFS, sub-set-level (Temporal Label 22 (TL22) and Spatial Label 24 (SL24)). And fine-grained elements-level (MMFS-63) are annotated by the different semantic labels. We use 30 fps of RGB videos and extract skeleton features with 17 joints for each frame by leveraging HRNet in MMFS-63. To better understand the performance of prominent action recognition models on this proposed dataset, we benchmark a variety of models on MMFS and group the models into two categories: RGB-based models and skeleton-based models. RGB-based Models. For RGB-based action recognition, models process very high dimensional input and are more sensitive to the size of training data. Several prominent action recognition models are selected as test methods. Specifically, the RGB-based experiments are conducted utilizing I3D [ref]4, TSN , TSM [ref]19, and PAN methods. As for action quality assessment, C3D-LSTM [ref]27, C3D-AVG-MTL , CoRe , and DAE-MLP  are utilized for the baseline methods. Skeleton-based Models. We adopt the skeleton-based models on this dataset, including ST-GCN , 2S-AGCN , CTRGCN , efficientGCN B4 , and PoseC3D. For the skeleton-based methods, the large duration variance of clips (the length range of clips is between 25 and 2536 frames) motivates us to use the average frame number of all clips (320 frames) to construct the input111The 320 frames are extracted from equal divisions of each clip. The clip with insufficient frames (less than 320 frames) should be padded by zeros instead of skeleton features. In the benchmark, we focus on fine-grained action recognition with multi-modality, spatial and temporal semantics comparison, and the performance of mainstream methods in action quality assessment. The parameterization of all models can be found in the supplemental material.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: and are more sensitive to the size of training data.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
