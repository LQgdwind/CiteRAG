      "content": "Paper Title: SHAP zero Explains All-order Feature Interactions in Black-box Genomic Models with Near-zero Query Cost\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nShapley values have emerged as a theoretically robust method for explaining the local additive features of an input query to black-box models [ref]1  . However, extracting biological knowledge from the emerging models in genomics demands a more global understanding, which requires explaining the nonlinear interactions among features and doing so for hundreds to thousands of input query sequences. Shapley value explanations have a high computational cost, with an exact calculation requiring an exponential number of model evaluations in the input dimension . The cost is higher for nonlinear feature interactions and grows exponentially with a polynomial function of the input dimension. With the increasing growth of complex and large-scale models in genomics , often with only proprietary access, there is an urgent need for algorithms that can explain the nonlinear high-order interactions in these black-box models at scale–not just in a handful of sequences but among a host of query sequences. Consider the problem of explaining a black-box model f​(𝐱)𝑓𝐱f(\\mathbf{x}) that takes in a length-n𝑛n DNA sequence 𝐱∈ℤ4n={A,T,C,G}n𝐱superscriptsubscriptℤ4𝑛superscript𝐴𝑇𝐶𝐺𝑛\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{4}^{n}=\\{A,T,C,G\\}^{n} and outputs a real number. One popular method of explaining the prediction of f​(𝐱)𝑓𝐱f(\\mathbf{x}) to the input query sequence 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} is using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) [ref]6. SHAP explains the output of f​(𝐱)𝑓𝐱f(\\mathbf{x}) by assigning a so-called SHAP value IS​V​(i)superscript𝐼𝑆𝑉𝑖I^{SV}(i) to the ithsuperscript𝑖thi^{\\text{th}} nucleotide in 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x}, where i𝑖i belongs to the feature set D={1,2,…,n}𝐷12…𝑛D=\\{1,2,\\dots,n\\} (Fig. 1a): IS​V​(i)superscript𝐼𝑆𝑉𝑖I^{SV}(i) computes the marginal contribution of the ithsuperscript𝑖thi^{\\text{th}} nucleotide to the value function vT​(𝐱T)subscript𝑣𝑇subscript𝐱𝑇v_{T}(\\mathbf{x}_{T}) for all the subsets T𝑇T of features in D\\{i}\\𝐷𝑖D\\backslash\\{i\\}, where the value function is the output of f​(𝐱)𝑓𝐱f(\\mathbf{x}) to 𝐱Tsubscript𝐱𝑇\\mathbf{x}_{T} computed by marginalizing the absent nucleotides in D\\T\\𝐷𝑇D\\backslash T (Fig. 1a).\nSHAP requires computing vT​(𝐱T)subscript𝑣𝑇subscript𝐱𝑇v_{T}(\\mathbf{x}_{T}) for every subset of features in T⊆D𝑇𝐷T\\subseteq D, which means evaluating f​(𝐱)𝑓𝐱f(\\mathbf{x}) using a number of samples that grows exponentially with n𝑛n (hereafter called sample complexity) and paying a computational cost that also grows exponentially with n𝑛n (hereafter called computational complexity). Faithful\nShapley Interaction index IF​S​I​(T)superscript𝐼𝐹𝑆𝐼𝑇I^{FSI}(T) (Faith-Shap) generalizes SHAP values defined for a single nucleotide i𝑖i to an interaction defined over a set T⊆D𝑇𝐷T\\subseteq D (Equation (34)) . Computing Faith-Shap requires evaluating the model for all possible subsets of features in D𝐷D, and then marginalizing over their power set with an exact computational cost that grows exponentially with a polynomial function of sequence length p​o​l​y​(n)𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑦𝑛poly(n). The algorithms to approximately compute SHAP values are either stochastic estimators [ref]6      or model-based approximators [ref]6      . Stochastic estimators, such as KernelSHAP [ref]6, randomly subsample the feature subsets (T𝑇T,vT​(𝐱T)subscript𝑣𝑇subscript𝐱𝑇v_{T}(\\mathbf{x}_{T})) and approximately solve a weighted-least squares problem to estimate IS​V​(i)superscript𝐼𝑆𝑉𝑖I^{SV}(i). These algorithms require many model evaluations in practice and impose an undesirable trade-off between sample complexity and accuracy . Model-based approximators, such as DeepSHAP [ref]6, take advantage of the model architecture (e.g., neural networks) to estimate Shapley values. These methods are often faster but still require many model evaluations and only work for white-box models. Algorithms to compute Shapley interactions in black-box models 0  1 2, such as SHAP-IQ 0, subsample high-order interactions for efficiency but similar to stochastic estimators they need many model evaluations. To empirically demonstrate how current SHAP algorithms scale, let us consider TIGER 3, a recent model that predicts the efficiency of CRISPR-Cas13d guide RNA from their sequence and context. To explain which region in the guide RNA is the most determinant of efficiency, we estimated SHAP values of 103810381038 input query sequences. Finding the KernelSHAP [ref]6 values of all the nucleotides in these sequences took about one day on our single NVIDIA RTX A6000 machine. Worse yet, finding only up to 3rdsuperscript3rd3^{\\text{rd}} order feature interactions using SHAP-IQ took more than 81 days—revealing a severe scalability issue in current explainability algorithms. We posit that the model evaluations needed to estimate the SHAP values of an input query sequence have information that can be used to estimate the SHAP values for a new query sequence. Therefore, instead of independently evaluating the model for each query sequence, one can “recycle” the model evaluations to slash the sample and computational cost of explaining the model. Taking this idea to the extreme, we propose to do initial query-agnostic model evaluations to sketch the model and then use the sketch for model explanation. How can a model be sketched to be efficiently mapped to SHAP values and Shapley interactions? We discover a surprisingly underexplored connection between SHAP values and interactions and the model’s Fourier transform, enabling us to sketch the model and use the sketch for fast Shapley explanations. The Fourier transform provides a global sketching of the model f​(𝐱)𝑓𝐱f(\\mathbf{x}) irrespective of the query sequence or even the training distribution. Moreover, since Fourier is an orthonormal basis, it enables fast and sample-efficient algorithms for sketching black-box models in genomics that are compressible or near-sparse in the Fourier domain 4 5 6 7. Herein, we develop SHAP zero, an algorithm that estimates SHAP values and Shapley interactions with a near-zero additional cost per new query sequence after paying an initial up-front cost for model sketching (Fig. 1b). In developing SHAP zero, we make three distinct and interconnected contributions: First, we build on the existing algorithms in sparse Fourier transforms 7 8 and develop a method to sketch a black-box model f​(𝐱)𝑓𝐱f({\\bf x}) with sequence input (defined over q𝑞q alphabets) and real-valued output, in terms of its top-s𝑠s Fourier coefficients with a sample complexity of 𝒪​(s​n2)𝒪𝑠superscript𝑛2\\mathcal{O}(sn^{2}) and a computational complexity of 𝒪​(s​n3)𝒪𝑠superscript𝑛3\\mathcal{O}(sn^{3}). Second, we establish a mathematical formalism to map from (i) the Fourier transform to a transform from algebraic geometry called the Möbius transform and (ii) from the Möbius transform to Shapley-based explanations. The Möbius transform 9 0 enables us to map the top-s𝑠s Fourier coefficients of the model f​(𝐱)𝑓𝐱f(\\mathbf{x}) to Shapley-based explanations in 𝒪​(s2​(2​q)ℓ)𝒪superscript𝑠2superscript2𝑞ℓ\\mathcal{O}(s^{2}(2q)^{\\ell}) time per query sequence, where ℓ≤5ℓ5\\ell\\leq 5 caps the maximum order of model interactions in practice 1. Third, we conduct large-scale experiments to explain two genomic models, TIGER 3 and inDelphi 2, with SHAP zero. We demonstrate that SHAP zero estimates all-order feature interactions with an amortized computational cost up to 1000-fold faster than current algorithms. SHAP zero reveals the GC content of the seed region in TIGER and microhomologous motifs in inDelphi as predictive high-order features, a task previously inaccessible due to the combinatorial space of possible feature interactions.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Shapley values have emerged as a theoretically robust method for explaining the local additive features of an input query to black-box models [ref]1  .
