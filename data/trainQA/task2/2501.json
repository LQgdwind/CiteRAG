      "content": "Paper Title: Accelerating Markov Random Field Inference with Uncertainty Quantification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMethods for parallelizing Gibbs sampling based on the\nconditional independence of RVs\nhave been proposed   . Our work takes advantage\nof similar principles to create a schedule to\nupdate conditionally independent RVs in parallel. So et al.  present a custom data layout approach in multiple\nmemory banks for array-based computations.\nWang et al.  propose a polyhedral model that attempts to\ndetect memory bank conflicts for generalized memory\npartitioning in HLS. Cilardo and Gallo  present a lattice-based method\nthat takes advantage of the Z-polyhedral model  for\nprogram analysis and adopt a partitioning scheme\nbased on integer lattices. Escobedo and Lin \nuse memory space tessellation to find patterns in data\naccesses and cover the\nmemory access space with the found pattern.\nIn other works, Escobedo and Lin  \npresent approaches that create the data dependence graph of memory\naccesses in the iteration domain, and use graph coloring to assign\ndata elements to memory banks.\nThese works address the problem of determining the proper memory structure for\na specific problem that uses HLS, whereas our goal in this\npaper, while being an instance of this problem, is to design\na fixed memory structure that can support a wide range of\napplications. Moreover, in these works, the communication\namong different compute units is not accounted for, which\ncould further constrain the data placement solution. Table IV presents a summary of\nthe differences between our accelerator and some of the related work.\n333Application and Input Flexibility in the table refer to the diversity\nof applications and input sizes supported.\nTo the best of our knowledge, other MCMC and inference accelerators\nin the literature do not address the memory subsystem\nchallenges and uncertainty quantification as\ncomprehensively and effectively as this work.\nJonas  presents a tiled Gibbs sampling architecture,\nbut does not include an efficient memory system\ndesign and support for uncertainty quantification. Zhang et al. [ref]50 propose\nand analyze a microarchitecture for a Gibbs sampling\nfunction unit, but does not propose an actual accelerator design.\nand only includes back of the envelope calculations\nfor performance.\nKo et al.   design\nan FPGA-based parallel Gibbs sampling accelerator for\nMRF, which does not provide\nthe level of flexibility supported in this work. Ko et al.  propose\na similar architecture for a 2-core ASIC accelerator, with\nthe addition of asynchronous Gibbs sampling (AGS). This change\nreduces the accuracy of the algorithm, which requires more\niterations to achieve similar result quality, but also results\nin lower memory capacity requirement on the chip.\nHurkat and Mart√≠nez  propose a vector\nprocessor for deterministic inference algorithms\nwhich utilizes 3-D stacking to address\nhigh memory bandwidth requirements. Banerjee et al.  design a\ncompiler that transforms probabilistic models into hardware\naccelerators. Although their\nwork supports more general models, it produces a new\naccelerator per model and is different\nfrom our work, in that our goal is to design\nan accelerator that supports a reasonable range of problems.\nAdditionally, support for uncertainty quantification\nin their work is limited due to the use of on-chip counters, which can\nimpose significant overheads when the problem size grows,\nand the adoption of binning and Bloom filters  to approximate\nthe histogram when the number of entries is high. Mingas and Bouganis present a\nstreaming FPGA architecture to accelerate Parallel Tempering MCMC, an MCMC\nmethod to sample from multi-modal distributions, that uses custom precision\nwithout introducing sampling errors 4. Their work, however,\nis not a parallel architecture and is more suitable for addressing multi-modality.\nRouhani et al.  present an FPGA accelerator for Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo\nwhich relies on initial profiling to customize hardware resource allocation and scheduling\nfor complex streaming scenarios. Their work solves problems with continous RV spaces,\nbut it lacks uncertainty quantification.\n\nReference markers found: [50]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]50: and effectively as this work.\nJonas  presents a tiled Gibbs sampling architecture,\nbut does not include an efficient memory system\ndesign and support for uncertainty quantification. Zhang et al. [ref]50 propose\nand analyze a microarchitecture for a Gibbs sampling\nfunction unit, but does not propose an actual accelerator design.\nand only includes back of the envelope calculations\nfor\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
