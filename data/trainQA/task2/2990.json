      "content": "Paper Title: Meta-Forecasting by combining Global Deep Representations with Local Adaptation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTime series (TS) forecasting is of fundamental importance for various applications like marketing, customer/inventory management, and finance [ref]32. Classical examples are forecasting the number of daily sales of a product over the next few weeks or the energy production needs in the next few hours. Accurate TS forecasting results in better down-stream decision making with potentially large monetary implications (e.g., Seeger et al. [ref]37, Faloutsos et al. ). Conventional approaches for TS forecasting have typically been local, i.e. each TS is modeled independently by a forecasting model with relatively few parameters (see Hyndman and Athanasopoulos  for an introductory overview). Despite the modest amount of data used to train local TS forecasting models, they\nare effective\nin practice.\nThey have only recently been outperformed by global deep learning strategies, which adopt a multi-task learning approach by jointly training a deep neural network on a large set of related TS (or tasks).\nGlobal models are designed to work well on the set of TS they are trained on, but they perform poorly on out-of-sample TS.\nFor example, Oreshkin et al.  show that DeepAR  trained on the M4 dataset  performs poorly on the M3 dataset.\nGlobal-local approaches  [ref]39 , such as the M4 competition winner [ref]39, exhibit a greater level of specialization as they\nlearn parameters that are shared by all TS in the training set, as well as parameters specific to each TS. However, global-local models are still not able to handle out-of-sample TS as both types of parameters are learned jointly on a large training set of related TS in a multi-task fashion. In this work, we tackle the problem of out-of-sample TS forecasting by transferring knowledge from a set of TS, called the source dataset, to another set of TS, called the target dataset.\nWe assume that source and target datasets share some underlying structure which makes transfer learning possible, although they may contain TS from different domains.\nOur work can be seen as an instance of\nmeta-learning   , whose goal is to leverage a pool of related tasks to learn how to adapt to a new one with little data. We will refer to a forecasting method performing well in this scenario as a meta-forecasting method.111This was called zero-shot transfer learning by Oreshkin et al. . Such models could in principle be trained on a large set of TS and still produce accurate and fast predictions when applied to out-of-sample TS, potentially combining the inference speed and accuracy of deep learning models with the ease-of-use of classical local models. Our meta-forecasting method produces one-step ahead forecasts by combining learned representations with a differentiable closed-form adaptation mechanism inspired by the few-shot image classification method proposed by Bertinetto et al. .\nSpecifically, we propose a class of models which we call Meta Global-Local Auto-Regressive models (Meta-GLAR). Meta-GLAR models compute point forecasts for a single TS in three steps. First, the TS is passed through a representation model to obtain a representation for each time step. Second, a local (i.e. TS-specific) linear model is learned in closed-form by solving a ridge regression problem mapping the representations to the observed fraction of the TS. Lastly, the local linear model is applied to the global representation to compute the final predictions.\nCrucially, forecasts are computed in the same way also during training, where we backpropagate through the closed-form adaptation step to learn the representation parameters globally, i.e. across multiple TS.\nHence, we can\nlearn a representation which works well in combination with an efficient closed-form local adaptation. We use the RNN backbone in DeepAR  for the representation. However, one can transform any neural forecasting method in a meta-GLAR one by substituting the last global linear layer with the closed-form adaptation during both training and prediction. We also stress that, since our method adapts locally also during training, it is fundamentally different\nfrom fine-tuning the last layer on each TS, which we show to perform significantly worse. This is in contrast to recent results for few-shot image classification where fine-tuning the last layer is demonstrated to outperform many modern meta-learning methods . Our main\ncontributions can be summarized as follows. We propose a novel meta-learning method for TS forecasting that is suitable for\nout-of-sample TS forecasting. Meta-GLAR significantly improves the accuracy on out-of-sample TS forecasting (i.e., transfer setting) over a global neural forecasting models such as DeepAR, which employs the same RNN backbone. Our meta-forecasting method is competitive with classical local methods, for example beating the winner of the M3 competition, as well as NBEATS , the state-of-the-art method for out-of-sample TS forecasting, while having substantially fewer parameters than the latter method. We perform an extensive ablation study, showing that Meta-GLAR enjoys similar time and memory costs compared to a global one-step ahead RNN with the same backbone architecture, while converging faster and achieving better accuracy.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: Time series (TS) forecasting is of fundamental importance for various applications like marketing, customer/inventory management, and finance [ref]32.
