We evaluate our various models using four widely used datasets:\nMNIST [ref]31, CIFAR10 , CIFAR100 , and ImageNet(ILSVRC2012) [ref]41. In our experiments, the structure of the classical ResNet and pre-act ResNet models is implemented with\nthe same structure as in the sample codes in PyTorch [ref]39.\nWe also implement our modified models and MgNet***Codes are available at https://github.com/XuTeam/MgNet_Code. with PyTorch. Following the strategy in  , we adopt Batch Normalization \nbut not Dropout . We adopt the SGD training algorithm with momentum 0.9.\nWe also adopt a weight decay value of 0.0005 on MNIST and CIFAR, whereas the value for ImageNet is 0.0001.\nWe take the minibatch sizes to be 128, 128, 256 for MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet, respectively. We use the Kaiming’s weight-initialization strategy as in .\nWe always start training with a learning rate of 0.1.\nFor MNIST, we terminate training at 60 epochs and divide the learning rate by 10 at the 50-th epoch.\nFor both CIFAR and ImageNet, we terminate training at 150 epochs and divide the learning rate by 10 at every 30 epochs.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: those of established CNN models, and design a set of numerical experiments to explore the properties of MgNet and its variants.
