Instead of investigating data imbalance and non-IIDness together, we investigate how non-IID data alone is enough to impact accuracy and convergence. We seek answers to the fundamental question: How can we identify and deal with the users having non-IID distributions? Weight divergence, ‚Äñùíòi‚àí‚àëi=1Nùíòi/N‚Äñ22superscriptsubscriptnormsubscriptùíòùëñsuperscriptsubscriptùëñ1ùëÅsubscriptùíòùëñùëÅ22\\|\\bm{w}_{i}-\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\bm{w}_{i}/N\\|_{2}^{2} is used in¬†[ref]4 to compare the norm difference between the local weights wisubscriptùë§ùëñw_{i} and the global average. Local loss is an equivalent indicator with less complexity, since it does not require pairwise weight computations. Fig. 5(a) compares the local loss of the non-IID outlier with the average loss from the rest users and the ideal case when the data is IID. The outlier user with only one class can be easily identified from the rest IID ones, which has over an order of magnitude loss value and is unable to converge compared to the rest. While identifying outliers is simple, the existing studies¬† [ref]4  have yet to reach a consensus on how to deal with them. With the outlier user only having a subset of classes, our intuition is that accuracy is directly associated with the distribution of classes among the users¬†. To see how the number of classes impacts accuracy, we conduct the second experiment by iterating the number of classes per user from 222-888 (out of 101010 classes) plus a standard deviation of samples among the existing classes as the xùë•x-axis. It is observed in Fig. 5(b) that higher disparity of class distributions among the users indeed leads to more accuracy degradation with a substantial loss of 10-15% on CIFAR10. Since the presence of non-IID outliers is inevitable in practices, we are facing two options: 1) simply exclude them from the population based on loss divergence¬†; 2) keep them in training. We take a closer look of these options and argue that the decision should be actually conditioning on the class distributions, rather than only based on the local loss or weight divergence. We demonstrate through a simple case to distribute CIFAR10 dataset among 4 users in different ways, and introduce a fifth user to act as the non-IID outlier. Ideal IID(10): the ideal baseline when all 444 users have identical distribution and all 10 classes are evenly distributed among them. Include Non-IID(10): the population has 10 classes. A fifth user with only one class is included, but her class has already presented in the population. The population becomes non-IID because of the fifth user. Include Non-IID(9): the population has 9 classes. A fifth user with that missing class (one-class outlier) is included. The population is also non-IID. Exclude IID(9): the population has 9 classes. Exclude the fifth user despite she possesses class samples from the missing class so the population remains IID¬†. From the results in Fig. 6(a), we have two key observations: 1) if the class of the outlier user is also found in the population, inclusion of the outlier has minor influence on accuracy (but slows down convergence); 2) if such class is missing from the population, including the outlier user results 1-2% accuracy loss compared to the ideal IID case, but achieving a significant improvement of 5% accuracy compared to when the outlier user is completely removed from training. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that the selection of participants should not only rely on the local losses, but also whether they contain classes that are not yet included in the training set. Summary. The findings are inline with two fundamental principles of machine learning and the generality is effective for other experimental setup and datasets as well. FL adopts the principles of data parallelism¬†. As long as the training data is partitioned in an IID fashion, it does not negatively impact the test accuracy. In fact, data parallelism will improve the accuracy during a fixed training time because of fast convergence. It is applicable to any neural network architecture and is model-agnostic. For non-IID data, our findings are based on: 1) class imbalance/non-IID data has negative impact on accuracy as validated in¬†[ref]2 [ref]4; 2) models generalize poorly on unseen data samples, since machine learning is good at interpolation on the data it has been trained on, but bad at extrapolation to the out-of-distribution data. We discover more subtleties that simple exclusion of the ‚Äúoutliers‚Äù depending on the degree of class imbalance may undermine model generalization. We need to look into whether the users possess unseen samples that can help generalize the model.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Non-IIDness is shown to have negative impact on collaborative convergence¬†[ref]2 [ref]4 and data imbalance could exacerbate this issue.
