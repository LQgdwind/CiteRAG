      "content": "Paper Title: Transferable Interactiveness Knowledge for Human-Object Interaction Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVisual Relationship Detection. Visual relationship detection  [ref]2 [ref]1 [ref]17 aims to detect the objects and classify their relationships simultaneously. In  [ref]2, Lu et al. proposed a relationship dataset VRD and an approach combined with language priors. Predicates within relationship triplet ⟨s​u​b​j​e​c​t,p​r​e​d​i​c​a​t​e,o​b​j​e​c​t⟩𝑠𝑢𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑜𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡\\langle subject,predicate,object\\rangle include actions, verbs, spatial and preposition vocabularies. Such vocabulary setting and severe long-tail issue within the dataset make this task quite difficult. Large-scale dataset Visual Genome [ref]1 is then proposed to promote the studies in this direction. Recent works      put attention on more effective and efficient visual feature extraction and try to exploit semantic information to refine the relationship detection. Human-Object Interaction Detection. Human-Object Interaction    is essential to understand human-centric interaction with objects. Several large-scale datasets, such as V-COCO , HICO-DET , HCVRD , HAKE  were proposed for the exploration of HOI detection.\nDifferent from HOI recognition      which is an image-level problem, HOI detection needs to detect interactive human-object pairs and classify their interactions at the instance-level.\nWith the assistance of DNNs and large datasets, recent methods have made significant progress         . Chao et al.  proposed a multi-stream model combining visual features, spatial locations to help tackle this problem.\nTo address the long-tail issue, Shen et al.  studied zero-shot learning and predicted the verb and object separately.\nIn InteractNet , an action-specific density map estimation method is introduced to locate interacted objects.\nIn , Qi et al. proposed GPNN incorporating DNN and graph model, which uses message parsing to iteratively update states and classifies all possible pairs/edges.\nGao et al.  exploited an instance-centric attention module to enhance the information from interest regions and facilitate HOI classification.\nPeyre et al.   learned a unified space combining visual and semantic language features and detected unseen interactions through entity analogy. Generally, these methods infer HOI in one-stage and may suffer from severe non-interactive pair domination problems. To address this issue, we utilize interactiveness to explicitly discriminate non-interactive pairs and suppress them before HOI classification. Part-based Action Recognition. Part-level human feature takes further insight into human-object interaction.\nBased on the whole person and part bounding boxes, Gkioxari et al.  developed a part-based model to make fine-grained action recognition.\nIn , Fang et al. proposed a pairwise body part attention model that can learn to focus on crucial parts and their correlations. An attention-based feature selection method and a pairwise parts representation learning scheme are introduced.\nIn our work, we utilize the body part features and whole body feature to learn hierarchical interactivenesses. And the unique consistency between the two levels is fully explored to guide the learning.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Visual Relationship Detection.
