      "content": "Paper Title: A Framework for Consistency Algorithms\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe basis of our framework is a universal consistency problem which can be instantiated to simulate a particular memory model.\nFor its formulation, we make use of a consistency notion that allows for the construction of a fast algorithm but deviates from the literature    at first sight.\nTherefore, it is proven in Section 4 that instantiating the problem with a particular memory model yields the correct notion of consistency. We clarify our notion of consistency.\nIntuitively, a history is consistent under a memory model if it can be scheduled such that certain axioms defined by the model are satisfied.\nFollowing the formal framework of  , finding such a schedule amounts to finding a particular order of the write events that satisfies acyclicity requirements imposed by the axioms.\nFormally, let h=⟨O,𝑝𝑜,𝑟𝑓⟩ℎ𝑂𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑓h=\\langle O,\\mathit{po},\\mathit{rf}\\rangle be a history and let \\ComplexityFont​M​M\\ComplexityFont𝑀𝑀\\ComplexityFont{MM} be a memory model described by the tuple (𝑝𝑜​-​𝑚𝑚,𝑟𝑓​-​𝑚𝑚)𝑝𝑜-𝑚𝑚𝑟𝑓-𝑚𝑚(\\mathit{po}\\,\\text{-}\\mathit{mm},\\mathit{rf}\\text{-}\\mathit{mm}).\nThen hℎh is called \\ComplexityFont​M​M\\ComplexityFont𝑀𝑀\\ComplexityFont{MM}-consistent if there exists a strict total order 𝑡𝑤𝑡𝑤\\mathit{tw} on the write events 𝑊𝑅𝑊𝑅\\!\\mathit{WR} of hℎh such that the graphs are both acyclic.\nHere, the conflict relation 𝑐𝑓𝑐𝑓\\mathit{cf} is defined by 𝑐𝑓=𝑟𝑓−1∘⋃x∈𝑉𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑤x𝑐𝑓superscript𝑟𝑓1subscript𝑥𝑉𝑎𝑟subscript𝑡𝑤𝑥\\mathit{cf}=\\mathit{rf}^{-1}\\circ\\bigcup_{x\\in\\!\\mathit{Var}}\\mathit{tw}_{x}.\nPhrased differently, (r,w)∈𝑐𝑓𝑟𝑤𝑐𝑓(r,w)\\in\\mathit{cf} if r𝑟r is a read event on a variable x𝑥x, w𝑤w is a write event on x𝑥x, and there is a write event w′superscript𝑤′w^{\\prime} on x𝑥x such that (w′,r)∈𝑟𝑓superscript𝑤′𝑟𝑟𝑓(w^{\\prime},r)\\in\\mathit{rf} and (w′,w)∈𝑡𝑤superscript𝑤′𝑤𝑡𝑤(w^{\\prime},w)\\in\\mathit{tw}. The acyclicity of G𝑙𝑜𝑐subscript𝐺𝑙𝑜𝑐G_{\\mathit{loc}} is called uniprocessor requirement  or memory coherence for each location .\nRoughly, it demands that an order among writes to the same location that can be extracted from the history, is kept in 𝑡𝑤𝑡𝑤\\mathit{tw}.\nThe second acyclicity requirement in the definition resembles the underlying memory model \\ComplexityFont​M​M\\ComplexityFont𝑀𝑀\\ComplexityFont{MM}.\nIf G𝑚𝑚subscript𝐺𝑚𝑚G_{\\mathit{mm}} is acyclic, the history can be scheduled adhering to the axioms defined by \\ComplexityFont​M​M\\ComplexityFont𝑀𝑀\\ComplexityFont{MM}. Our definition of consistency deviates from the literature in two aspects.\nFirst, we demand a total order 𝑡𝑤𝑡𝑤\\mathit{tw} instead of a store order, a partial order that is total on writes to the same location   .\nIn Section 4 we will show that the resulting notions of consistency are equivalent.\nA further difference is that we do not explicitly test for out of thin air values [ref]41.\nFor the majority of memory models considered in this work, the test is not necessary as it is implied by the acyclicity of G𝑙𝑜𝑐subscript𝐺𝑙𝑜𝑐G_{\\mathit{loc}} and G𝑚𝑚subscript𝐺𝑚𝑚G_{\\mathit{mm}}.\nBut it can easily be added when needed. We are ready to state the universal consistency problem.\nTo this end, let \\ComplexityFont​M​M\\ComplexityFont𝑀𝑀\\ComplexityFont{MM} be a fixed memory model.\nGiven a history hℎh, the problem asks whether hℎh is \\ComplexityFont​M​M\\ComplexityFont𝑀𝑀\\ComplexityFont{MM}-consistent.\n{myproblem}\n\n\n\n\nInstantiations of the problem by well-known memory models like \\SC\\SC\\SC or \\ComplexityFont​T​S​O\\ComplexityFont𝑇𝑆𝑂\\ComplexityFont{TSO} are typically \\NP\\NP\\NP-hard  .\nHowever, we are interested in a deterministic algorithm for \\ComplexityFontMM-Consistency.\nWhile we cannot avoid an exponential running time for such an algorithm, a fine-grained complexity analysis can determine the optimal exponential dependence.\nMany parameters of \\ComplexityFontMM-Consistency like the number of threads, the maximum size per thread, or the size of the data domain yield parameterizations that are \\W​\\Wdelimited-[]1\\W-hard  .\nTherefore, we conduct a fine-grained analysis for the parameter k=|𝑊𝑅|𝑘𝑊𝑅k=|\\!\\mathit{WR}|, the number of writes in hℎh.\nThe main finding is an algorithm for \\ComplexityFontMM-Consistency running in time 𝒪∗​(2k)superscript𝒪superscript2𝑘\\mathcal{O}^{*}(2^{k}).\nThe optimality of this approach is shown in Section 5 by a complementing lower bound.\nWe formally state the upper bound in the following theorem.\nThere, n=|O|𝑛𝑂n=|O| denotes the number of events in hℎh. The problem \\ComplexityFont​M​M\\ComplexityFont𝑀𝑀\\ComplexityFont{MM}-Consistency can be solved in time 𝒪​(2k⋅k2⋅n2)𝒪⋅superscript2𝑘superscript𝑘2superscript𝑛2\\mathcal{O}(2^{k}\\cdot k^{2}\\cdot n^{2}). Note that an algorithm for \\ComplexityFontMM-Consistency running in time 𝒪∗​(kk)superscript𝒪superscript𝑘𝑘\\mathcal{O}^{*}(k^{k}) is immediate.\nOne can iterate over all total orders of 𝑊𝑅𝑊𝑅\\!\\mathit{WR} and check the acyclicity of G𝑙𝑜𝑐subscript𝐺𝑙𝑜𝑐G_{\\mathit{loc}} and G𝑚𝑚subscript𝐺𝑚𝑚G_{\\mathit{mm}} in polynomial time.\nSince we cannot afford this iteration in 𝒪∗​(2k)superscript𝒪superscript2𝑘\\mathcal{O}^{*}(2^{k}), improving the running time needs an alternative approach and further technical development that we summarize in Section 3.2.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: writes to the same location   .\nIn Section 4 we will show that the resulting notions of consistency are equivalent.\nA further difference is that we do not explicitly test for out of thin air values [ref]41.\nFor the majority of memory models considered in this work, the test is not necessary as it is implied by the acyclicity of G𝑙𝑜𝑐subscript𝐺𝑙𝑜𝑐G_{\\mathit{loc}} and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
