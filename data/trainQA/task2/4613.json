      "content": "Paper Title: Truncated Matrix Power Iteration for Differentiable DAG Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur algorithm is closely related to the following DAG constraint considered by Zheng et al. [ref]50. Let 𝐁~∈ℝ⩾0d×d~𝐁superscriptsubscriptℝabsent0𝑑𝑑\\tilde{\\operatorname{\\mathbf{B}}}\\in\\mathbb{R}_{\\geqslant 0}^{d\\times d}\nwith spectral radius smaller than one\nbe the weighted adjacency matrix of a graph 𝒢𝒢\\operatorname{\\mathcal{G}} with d𝑑d vertices. 𝒢𝒢\\operatorname{\\mathcal{G}} is a DAG if and only if When the spectral radius is smaller than one, the inverse of 𝕀−𝐁~𝕀~𝐁\\mathbb{I}-\\tilde{\\operatorname{\\mathbf{B}}} is simply the following infinite geometric series: Zheng et al. [ref]50 argued that (12) is not well\ndefined for 𝐁~~𝐁\\tilde{\\operatorname{\\mathbf{B}}} with spectral radius larger than 1, and in practice the series (12) may\nexplode very quickly. Based on this\nargument, they adopted the matrix exponential for\nconstructing the DAG constraint. For the same reason, Yu et al. [ref]45\nalso used very small coefficients for higher-order terms in polynomial based\nDAG constraints. However, as we illustrate in Section\n3, the DAG constraints proposed by Zheng et al. [ref]50, Yu et al. [ref]45 may\nsuffer from gradient vanishing owing to the small coefficients for\nhigher-order terms. In fact, our constraint\n(7) serves a good approximation for\n(11) since we are actually looking for an approximate inverse of 𝕀−𝐁~𝕀~𝐁\\mathbb{I}-\\tilde{\\operatorname{\\mathbf{B}}} with a bounded error. Given 𝐁~∈ℝ⩾0d×d~𝐁superscriptsubscriptℝabsent0𝑑𝑑\\tilde{\\operatorname{\\mathbf{B}}}\\in\\mathbb{R}_{\\geqslant 0}^{d\\times d}, if there exists k𝑘k such that ‖𝐁~k‖∞⩽ϵ<1/dsubscriptnormsuperscript~𝐁𝑘italic-ϵ1𝑑\\|\\tilde{\\operatorname{\\mathbf{B}}}^{k}\\|_{\\infty}\\leqslant\\epsilon<1/d, then we have Previous works  [ref]24 pointed out that for DAG constraints with form h​(𝐁⊙𝐁)ℎdirect-product𝐁𝐁h(\\operatorname{\\mathbf{B}}\\odot\\operatorname{\\mathbf{B}}), the Hadamard product would lead to vanishing gradients in the sense that the gradient ∇𝐁h​(𝐁⊙𝐁)=0subscript∇𝐁ℎdirect-product𝐁𝐁0\\nabla_{\\operatorname{\\mathbf{B}}}h(\\operatorname{\\mathbf{B}}\\odot\\operatorname{\\mathbf{B}})=0 if and only if h​(𝐁⊙𝐁)=0ℎdirect-product𝐁𝐁0h(\\operatorname{\\mathbf{B}}\\odot\\operatorname{\\mathbf{B}})=0. Ng et al. [ref]24 further showed that this may lead to ill-conditioning issue when solving the constrained optimization problem.\nOne may replace the Hadamard product with absolute value, as in Wei et al. , but the non-smoothness of absolute value may make the optimization problem difficult to solve and lead to poorer performance [ref]24. As pointed out by Ng et al. [ref]24, Quasi-Newtown methods, e.g., L-BFGS , still perform well even when faced with the ill-conditioning issue caused by vanishing gradients of constraints with form h​(𝐁⊙𝐁)ℎdirect-product𝐁𝐁h(\\operatorname{\\mathbf{B}}\\odot\\operatorname{\\mathbf{B}}). In this work, we identify another type of gradient vanishing issue caused by (1) the higher-order terms and small coefficients in function hℎh itself and (2) the small spectral radius of candidate matrix 𝐁𝐁\\operatorname{\\mathbf{B}}, and further provide an effective solution by constructing a Truncated Matrix Power Iteration based DAG constraint.\n\nReference markers found: [50]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]50: Our algorithm is closely related to the following DAG constraint considered by Zheng et al.
