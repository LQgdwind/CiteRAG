Since graphs form a natural abstraction for processes in many domains, our generalization into the domain of graphs allows us to seek for potential applications of our algorithms and related problems for example in the domain of large networks analysis . Compared to unordered data structures, it is known that maintaining at least a partial order over the elements improves the performance of fundamental operations like search, update or insert, in terms of the number of comparisons needed . In the context of data management systems, it is known that efficient indexing is crucial to obtain good performance. Some of the indexing schemes have the form of a tree, for example the GIndex. At the same time, calculating optimal search strategies for structures with a partial order is hard in general 8. Practical approximation algorithms for searching in large graphs are important for the advancement of systems focused on large graph analysis. Binary search on trees seen as a graph ranking problem (cf. 3) can be used to model parallel Cholesky factorization of matrices , scheduling of parallel database queries , and VLSI layouts . A more general search model, i.e., binary search on graphs has been used as a framework for interactive learning of classifiers, clusterings or rankings  .\nMore applications can be found in software testing [ref]3 or mobile agent computing . There are several practical applications of searching where the cost of a query is naturally higher in some central vertex and decreases while moving towards the leaf nodes of the tree.\nThis occurs naturally when considering data access times in computer systems, e.g., due to memory hierarchies of modern processors, characteristics of the storage devices, or distributed nature of data management systems. In the literature on the binary search problem, a Hierarchical Memory Model of computation has been studied , in which the memory access time is monotonic with respect to the location of a data element in the array. Another work was devoted to modeling the problem of text retrieval from magnetic or optical disks, where a cost model was such that the cost of a query was monotonic from the location of the previous query performed in the search process .\nWe also mention an application of tree domains in automated bug search in computer code [ref]3.\nIn such case naturally occurs a possibility that the tree to be searched has the monotonicity property.\nIn particular, each query represents performing an automatic test that determines whether the part of the code that corresponds to the subtree under the tested vertex has an error.\nThus, the vertices that are closer to the root represent larger parts of the code and thus may require more or longer lasting tests. The scale of exa-scale software applications that may consist of several tens of separate software packages motivates the use of advanced software validation strategies, in order to quickly identify software regressions, e.g., when updating versions of several different packages. An open question has been posed several times about whether a constant-factor approximation algorithm exists for arbitrary weight functions, see e.g.   .\nThe main motivation of this work is to address this question by finding natural input instances for which a constant-factor approximation is achievable.\nIn particular, we give an algorithm for down-monotonic cost functions and motivated by the theory of parameterized complexity, study a parameter kùëòk of the input instance: the maximum number of monotonic segments on any path from a central node to any leaf. The case of kùëòk equal to the tree height captures the class of general cost functions.\nWe see this as a step towards solving the general problem. Our techniques lead to a constant approximation for any fixed kùëòk. We believe that this method can be improved to allow combining segments of different monotonicity, while preserving the constant factor approximation.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: search model, i.e., binary search on graphs has been used as a framework for interactive learning of classifiers, clusterings or rankings  .\nMore applications can be found in software testing [ref]3 or mobile agent computing .
