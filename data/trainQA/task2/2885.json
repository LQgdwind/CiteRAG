      "content": "Paper Title: Latent reweighting, an almost free improvement for GANs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAnother line of research consists in improving the sampling quality of pre-trained GANs. 3 proposed a heuristic to insert disconnectedness and remove the samples mapped out of the true manifold. 2 designed Discriminator Optimal Transport (DOT), a gradient ascent driven by a Wasserstein discriminator to improve every single sample. Similarly,  follow a discriminator-driven Langevin dynamic. Another well-studied possibility would be to use Monte-Carlo (MC) methods . Following this path,  were the first to use a rejection sampling method to improve the quality of the proposal distribution μθsubscript𝜇𝜃\\mu_{\\theta}. The authors use the fact that the optimal vanilla discriminator trained with binary cross-entropy is equal to μ⋆/(μ⋆+μθ)subscript𝜇⋆subscript𝜇⋆subscript𝜇𝜃\\mu_{\\star}/(\\mu_{\\star}+\\mu_{\\theta}). Thus, a parametric discriminator Dα:ℝD→[ref]0 :subscript𝐷𝛼→superscriptℝ𝐷01D_{\\alpha}:\\mathbb{R}^{D}\\to[ref]0  can be used to approximate the density ratios rαsubscript𝑟𝛼r_{\\alpha} as follows: This density ratio can then be plugged in the Rejection Sampling (RS) algorithm. Doing so, it can be shown that sampling from μθsubscript𝜇𝜃\\mu_{\\theta} and accepting samples probabilistically is equivalent to sample from the target distribution μ⋆subscript𝜇⋆\\mu_{\\star}. The acceptance probability of a given sample x𝑥x is ℙa​(x)=rα​(x)ksubscriptℙ𝑎𝑥subscript𝑟𝛼𝑥𝑘\\mathds{P}_{a}(x)=\\frac{r_{\\alpha}(x)}{k}. This is valid as long as there is a constant k∈ℝ+𝑘superscriptℝ+k\\in\\mathds{R}^{\\texttt{+}} such that μ⋆​(x)≤k​μθ​(x)subscript𝜇⋆𝑥𝑘subscript𝜇𝜃𝑥\\mu_{\\star}(x)\\leq k\\mu_{\\theta}(x) for all x. 4 use similar density ratios and derive MH-GAN, by using the independent Metropolis-Hasting algorithm 5. Finally, 1 use these density ratios rαsubscript𝑟𝛼r_{\\alpha} as importance weights and perform discrete sampling relying on the Sampling-Importance-Resampling (SIR) algorithm . Given X1,…,Xn∼μθnsimilar-tosubscript𝑋1…subscript𝑋𝑛superscriptsubscript𝜇𝜃𝑛X_{1},\\ldots,X_{n}\\sim\\mu_{\\theta}^{n}, we have: Note that these algorithms all rely on similar density ratios and differ by the acceptance-rejection scheme chosen. Interestingly, in RS, the acceptance rate is not controlled, but we are guaranteed to sample from μ⋆subscript𝜇⋆\\mu_{\\star}. Conversely, with SIR and MH, the acceptance rate is a chosen parameter, but we are sampling from an approximation of the target distribution.\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: optimal vanilla discriminator trained with binary cross-entropy is equal to μ⋆/(μ⋆+μθ)subscript𝜇⋆subscript𝜇⋆subscript𝜇𝜃\\mu_{\\star}/(\\mu_{\\star}+\\mu_{\\theta}).
