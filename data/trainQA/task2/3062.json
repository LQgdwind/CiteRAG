Synthetic Datasets: Our basic idea is to generate random graphs with a various number of nodes. Then based on two topological properties, we give tag and feature interval to the nodes and classify every graph in the datasets. The summary statistics of these synthetic datasets are provided in Table-2. The topological properties are listed below, Density  The density of a graph is defined as the ratio of the number of edges and the number of nodes , i.e., where G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) denotes a graph, V𝑉V is the set of nodes and E𝐸E is the edge set of the graph G𝐺G.\nAverage density of the dataset D={Gi,i=1,…,n}D=\\{G_{i},i=1,...,n\\} can be calculated as, a​v​g​_​d​e​n​s​i​t​y=∑i=1nd​e​n​s​i​t​y​(Gi)n𝑎𝑣𝑔_𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦subscript𝐺𝑖𝑛avg\\_density=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{density(G_{i})}}{n} We assign, We assign, where average degree is calculated over all nodes in the dataset.\n\nTo assign the interval valued feature to a node v𝑣v, we follow the following rule, where dm​i​nsubscript𝑑𝑚𝑖𝑛d_{min}=minu∈N​(v)⁡d​e​g​r​e​e​(u)subscript𝑢𝑁𝑣𝑑𝑒𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑢\\displaystyle\\min_{u\\in N(v)}degree(u), dm​a​xsubscript𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥d_{max}=maxu∈N​(v)⁡d​e​g​r​e​e​(u)subscript𝑢𝑁𝑣𝑑𝑒𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑢\\displaystyle\\max_{u\\in N(v)}degree(u) We have created three datasets, SYNTHETIC_1_200, SYNTHETIC_1_1000, SYNTHETIC_1_2000, with 200, 1000, 2000 graphs, respectively, according to this construction. Average clustering coefficient The clustering coefficient c​(u)𝑐𝑢c(u) of a node u𝑢u,is a measure of the likelihood that any two neighbors of u𝑢u are connected . Mathematically, the clustering coefficient of a node u𝑢u can be formulated as: where λ​(u)𝜆𝑢\\lambda(u) is the number of triangles engaging the node u𝑢u. By triangle, we mean complete graph with three nodes and i.e., the number of triples a node u𝑢u has.\n\nIn other words, the clustering coefficient for node u𝑢u is the ratio of the actual number of edges between two nodes from the neighbours of u𝑢u and the maximally possible numbers of edges between them. The clustering coefficient C​(G)𝐶𝐺C(G) of a graph G𝐺G is the average of c​(u)𝑐𝑢c(u) taken over all the nodes in the graph, i.e., Average clustering coefficient of the dataset D={Gi,i=1,…,n}D=\\{G_{i},i=1,...,n\\} can be calculated as, a​v​g​_​c​l​u​s​t​e​r=∑i=1nC​(Gi)n𝑎𝑣𝑔_𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛𝐶subscript𝐺𝑖𝑛avg\\_cluster=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{C(G_{i})}}{n} We assign, We use node’s degree as its tag.

Bio-informatics datasets: 4 datasets MUTAG, PROTEINS, PTC and NCI1  have been used for our experiment. The summary statistics of these bioinformatic datasets are provided in Table-3. MUTAG consists of 188 graphs which have 7 discrete node labels. Each graph in the dataset represents a chemical compound . In the dataset PROTEINS, nodes represent secondary structure elements (SSEs) and two nodes share an edge if they appear as adjacent in the amino-acid sequence. Graph nodes have 3 different labels such as helix, sheet or turn . PTC includes 344 chemical compounds that describes the carciogenicity for male and female rats having 19 discrete node labels . NCI1 is a balanced dataset with 4100 nodes with 37 discrete labels, published by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). It contains chemical compounds, that are found to have the ability to suppress or inhibit the growth of a panel of human tumor cell lines . Social network datasets: 2 datasets, IMDB-BINARY and COLLAB  have been used for our experiment.\nThe summary statistics of these datasets are provided in Table-4. Movie Collaboration Dataset: IMDB-BINARY is a dataset of movie collaboration, wherein in each graph, nodes represent actors/actresses and two nodes share an edge if two actors/actresses act in the same movie. There are two graph classes Action and Romance genres. Scientific collaboration dataset: COLLAB is a dataset of scientific collaboration, acquired from 3 public collaboration datasets, namely High Energy Physics, Condensed Matter Physics and Astro physics [ref]36. In , ego-networks of various researchers from each field has been generated, and each graph has a label according to the field of the researcher. Now the task will be to determine an ego-collaboration graph’s label of a researcher.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: collaboration dataset: COLLAB is a dataset of scientific collaboration, acquired from 3 public collaboration datasets, namely High Energy Physics, Condensed Matter Physics and Astro physics [ref]36.
