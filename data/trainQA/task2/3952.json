For example, definition 3 briefly describes how supervised learning, planning and constraint satisfaction may all be described as a tasks151515A detailed example of a simple regression problem represented as a task is given in the appendix.. As such, these results can and should be applied in the context of existing tools and formulations. According to Sutton, two general purpose methods that seem to scale arbitrarily are search and learning (namely function approximation) . We have described intelligence in terms of search and declarative programs, but the concepts are as applicable to curve fitting, and to connectionist as to symbolic interpretations. The formalism may be described with category theory  [ref]52, and with imperative programs (recall that there exists an isomorphism between imperative and declarative programs [ref]21). In practical terms, the rules determining correctness can be modelled with neural networks by training a classifier o:ZS‚Üí :ùëú‚ÜísubscriptùëçùëÜ01o:Z_{S}\\rightarrow  such that o‚Äã(l)‚âà1ùëúùëô1o(l)\\approx 1 if l‚ààDùëôùê∑l\\in{D}, and o‚Äã(l)‚âà0ùëúùëô0o(l)\\approx 0 otherwise. oùëúo behaves as a task model, the weakness of which can then be maximised. oùëúo can be used to train another network n:S‚ÜíD:ùëõ‚ÜíùëÜùê∑n:{S}\\rightarrow{D} which outputs correct decisions. oùëúo learns the desired end of the task, while nùëõn learns means by which it can be completed. What an architecture is suitable to describe varies according to the Chomsky hierarchy [ref]53. Using one architecture as opposed to another is equivalent to including different sorts of declarative programs in Vùëâ{V}. An upcoming paper includes an implementation of this, along with results for declarative task models constructed from positive and negative examples (see appendix).\n\nReference markers found: [52]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]52: of search and declarative programs, but the concepts are as applicable to curve fitting, and to connectionist as to symbolic interpretations.
