      "content": "Paper Title: When to Update Your Model: Constrained Model-based Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nModel-based reinforcement learning methods have shown great potential for sequential decision-making both in simulation and in the real world due to their sample efficiency  . Generally, these MBRL algorithms can be grouped into several categories to highlight the range of uses of predictive models . And our work falls into the Dyna-style category. In Dyna-style algorithms, training alternates between model learning under policy iterations with the real environments, and policy optimization using the model rollouts    3.\nMany attempts have been devoted to improving these two stages. For model learning stage, previous main concerns are function approximators and training objectives.\nThe dynamics approximator has advanced from Gaussian processes  , time-varying linear dynamics   to neural network predictive models  [ref]38.\nAnd training objectives vary from Mean Square Error (MSE) [ref]38 , Negative Log Likelihood (NLL)  , etc.\nMoreover, the deep ensemble technique is appealing for improving the robustness to model error. Our method adopts an ensemble of probabilistic networks similarly as in   . The policy optimization stage allows Dyna-style algorithms to leverage various off-the-shelf model-free methods, such as SAC , TRPO [ref]44, and TD3 .\nMuch owing to the progress of model-free methods,\nour method is to invoke any reasonable optimization oracle for the empirical models,\nrather than entangle a particular policy optimization algorithm. A consensus of MBRL is that a smart policy requires an accurate model.\nHowever, model bias cannot be eliminated because the state-action distribution of the samples in the model learning stage and policy optimization stage is quite different.\nMany prior works attend to this distribution mismatch issue and then tailor the data used for policy optimization according to the model bias.\n Janner et al. , Buckman et al.  encourage truncated rollout lengths.\nBesides, the ratio of real to model-generated data can be dynamically tuned according to the model uncertainty   .  Yu et al.  penalizes rewards by the model uncertainty.\nOur method incorporates the truncated model rollouts mechanism. Moreover, we further explore how real interactions affect overall performance which is rarely studied before. We construct an event-triggered mechanism to cope with overfitting in a small-data regime and suffering generalization error when facing a drastic distribution shift. Monotonic improvement guarantee has been a fundamental concern in both model-free and model-based avenues.\nIn MFRL methods, both CPI  and TRPO [ref]44 can be understood as approximating and optimizing the performance gap by forcing the new policy to be not too far away from the current policy. However, in Model-based settings, their trust-region constraints cannot directly be satisfied because the policies highly depend on the randomness of the models. While constructing such a bound for performance gap is straightforward, it has not been explored in previous MBRL theorectical analyses, instead they      turn to bound the discrepancy between returns under a model and those in the real environment. Although they could guarantee that the lower bound of policy performance improves under a certain model, this guarantee may face several issues regarding model updating.\nIn contrast, we construct the performance difference scheme for MBRL algorithms and perform monotonicity analysis under this scheme. Another line of theoretical works focus on regret bounds   or sample complexity properties   , focusing on the convergence performance and sample complexity for model-based approaches.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: concerns are function approximators and training objectives.\nThe dynamics approximator has advanced from Gaussian processes  , time-varying linear dynamics   to neural network predictive models  [ref]38.\nAnd training objectives vary from Mean Square Error (MSE) [ref]38 , Negative Log Likelihood (NLL)  , etc.\nMoreover, the deep ensemble technique is appealing for improving the robustness to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
