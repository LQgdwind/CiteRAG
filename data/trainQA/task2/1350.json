      "content": "Paper Title: Learning-Based Quality Assessment for Image Super-Resolution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImage SR has been an active research topic in recent years. Existing single image SR algorithms may be divided into three categories: interpolation-based   , reconstruction-based   [ref]24 and learning-based [ref]5  [ref]25   . Interpolation-based methods are simple, efficient and of low computational cost but has limited restoration performance, because such methods often introduce severe artifacts. Built upon models of prior domain knowledge, reconstruction-based methods suppress artifacts better, but often have much higher computational complexity. Learning-based methods learn LR-to-HR image mapping from training data. During the past decades, numerous perceptual IQA metrics have been proposed to predict the visual quality of images with full-reference, reduced-reference and no-reference. Among them, the scope of application of full-reference metric is limited due to its requirement of unimpaired source. Recently, researchers have paid more attention to no-reference IQA. Early no-reference methods were based on Natural Scene Statistic (NSS) . Common NSS features include wavelet coefficients 0, locally normalized illumination coefficients 1. Learning-based methods have been growing steadily 2 3 4, which automatically learn the mapping between image features and the perceptual quality. Meanwhile, Image Sharpness Assessment (ISA) technique has emerged as an effective method for IQA 5. Hassen et al. identified the Local Phase Coherence (LPC) of images computed in wavelet transform domain to assess image quality 6. Bahrami et al. proposed a fast no-reference ISA method based on the standard deviation of weighted Maximum Local Variation (MLV) distribution of images 7. Blanchet et al. introduced an indicator of Global Phase Coherence (GPC), which decreases with blur, noise, and ringing 8. Li et al. proposed a no-reference SPArse Representation-based Image SHarpness index (SPARISH), which used an overcomplete dictionary learned from natural images to measure the extent of blur 9. Hosseini et al. designed two no-reference ISA metrics, called Synthetic-MaxPol 0 and HVS-MaxPol 5, which were based on MaxPol convolution kernals and MaxPol filter library, respectively. The use of deep learning has been a strong trend in recent IQA algorithms. Kang et al. designed a shallow CNN to learn features from contrast normalized image patches . Ma et al. proposed a multi-task end-to-end learning framework for no-reference IQA 1. Yang et al. proposed an end-to-end SGDNet for no-reference IQA, which introduced saliency information to facilitate quality prediction . Yan et al. integrated the NSS features prediction to the deep learning-based no-reference IQA to improve the representation and generalization ability . However, most existing IQA methods are not suitable for SR images, since they are designed for images degraded by common distortions such as compression, white noise and blur. The distortions produced by SR are often mixed and more sophisticated. The study  has shown that the popular no-reference IQA metrics are difficult to predict the perceptual quality of SR image based on an SR Image Database (SRID). In a lab testing environment, the pristine reference HR image may be available when evaluating SR algorithms, for which objective full-reference metrics are directly applicable. It was shown that the Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a poor criterion in many cases 2. In 3, Thapa et al. adopted PSNR and SSIM to compare the performance of several SR algorithms. In SR benchmark study , Yang et al. analyzed the effectiveness of six common full-reference IQA indicators, and also demonstrated that existing full-reference metrics fail to match the perceptual qualities of HR images well. Small-scale subjective tests have also been carried out. Reibman et al. evaluated SR enhanced image quality through subjective tests, and pointed out that the full-reference IQA metrics cannot always capture visual quality of HR image 4. In most practical scenarios, the reference HR images are not available, thus reduced-reference and no-reference IQA algorithms are preferred. Yeganeh et al. extracted three sets of NSS to assess the image SR performance with the available LR image as a reference, but the interpolation factors were strictly limited to integers . Zhou et al. proposed a Quality Assessment Database for Super-resolved images (QADS) and an IQA method considering the structural and textural components of images . Chen et al. presented a hybrid quality metric for non-integer image interpolation that combined both reduced-reference and no-reference philosophies . Fang et al. introduced a reduced-reference quality assessment method for image SR by predicting the energy and texture similarity between LR and HR images . In , Tang et al. proposed another reduced-reference IQA algorithm for SR reconstructed images with information gain and texture similarity combining saliency detection. Ma et al. proposed a no-reference metric by supervised learning on a large set of reference-free HR images . In addtion, Fang et al. designed a Blind model based on CNN for SR-IQA (BSRIQA) 5. Despite the significant effort, existing SR-IQA methods are limited in three aspects. First, most of them are constrained to integer scaling factors. Second, the public image SR databases are limited in size, making it difficult to train SR-IQA models without encountering serious overfitting problems. Third, there is no deep learning based model for reduced-reference SR-IQA. Focusing on the issues above, we firstly establish a large-scale image SR database, in which the scaling factor of HR images can be arbitrary. A reduced-reference CNN-based SR-IQA method is then proposed, which combines with LR images as references and is trained on the constructed large-scale database.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: Image SR has been an active research topic in recent years.
