      "content": "Paper Title: AR-TTA: A Simple Method for Real-World Continual Test-Time Adaptation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep neural networks have been shown to achieve remarkable performance in various tasks. However, current machine learning models perform very well only when the test-time distribution is close to the training-time distribution. This poses a significant challenge since in a real-world application a domain shift can occur in many circumstances, e.g., weather change, time of day shift, or sensor degradation. For this reason, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have been widely developed in recent years [ref]37 . Their aim is to adapt the source data pre-trained model to the current data distribution on-the-fly during test-time, using an unlabeled stream of test data.\nInitial test-time adaptation methods considered a single domain shift at a time. To better simulate real-world challenges, a continual test-time adaptation [ref]39 was recently proposed which involves constantly adapting the model to new domains, which is even more demanding. An efficient TTA method needs to work well in a wide range of settings. While some domain shifts occur abruptly, there are also several shifts that evolve gradually over time . Additionally, the temporal correlation between consecutive frames violates the i.i.d. assumption. The model should be able to achieve stable performance when handling lengthy sequences, potentially extending indefinitely.\nExisting approaches are based on updating model parameters using calculated pseudo-labels or entropy regularization [ref]39 [ref]37. Further, filtering of less reliable samples is often employed to reduce error accumulation and improve the computational efficiency  [ref]30 . However, all of the methods can become unstable due to the aforementioned factors, and as a result, the pseudo-labels become noisier and result in performance degradation . Without using any source data the model is prone to catastrophic forgetting  of previously acquired knowledge. Existing methods are mostly evaluated on synthetic datasets or on relatively short-length sequences [ref]37 [ref]39  and as such it is not known how those methods will work in real-life scenarios. Therefore, we adapt the autonomous driving benchmark CLAD , to the continual adaptation setting. Moreover, we use a SHIFT dataset , which is synthetically generated but is very realistic, provides very long sequences, and allows us to specifically control for different factors (time of day, weather conditions). In the proposed evaluation setup, we find out that current approaches lack the required stability, as their performance significantly deteriorates compared to the source model, see Figure 1.\nAdditionally, we notice that they struggle to correctly estimate batch norm statistics with temporally correlated data streams and low batch sizes.\nIn our method, we extend popular self-training framework [ref]39 [ref]37 with a small memory buffer, which is used during adaptation to prevent knowledge forgetting, without relying on heuristic-based strategies or resetting model weights that are often used [ref]39 [ref]30. Thanks to using mixup data augmentation  relatively small number of samples are required. Furthermore, we develop a module for dynamic batch norm statistics adaptation, which interpolates the calculated statistics between those of pretrained model and those obtained during deployment, based on the intensity of domain shift.\nWe call our method AR-TTA, as we improve Adaptation by using dynamic batch norm statistics and maintain knowledge by Repeating samples from the memory buffer combined with mixup data augmentation. As a result, our proposed method AR-TTA is simple, stable, and works well across a range of datasets with different shift intensities, when using small batches of data and over very long sequences.\nOur main contributions can be summarized as follows: We evaluate and analyze current test-time adaptation methods on realistic, continual domain shift image classification data. We propose a simple continual TTA method based on dynamic batch normalization statistics update and a small memory buffer combined with mixup data augmentation. Extensive evaluation shows that the proposed method obtains state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks with both artificial distortions and real-life ones from autonomous driving.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: shift can occur in many circumstances, e.g., weather change, time of day shift, or sensor degradation.
