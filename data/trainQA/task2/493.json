      "content": "Paper Title: Sparse and Continuous Attention Mechanisms\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe discuss here the relation between the (2−α)2𝛼(2-\\alpha)-exponential family of distributions as presented in Prop. 2.3 and the distributions arising from the Tsallis maxent principle [ref]13. We put in perspective the related work in statistical physics  , information geometry  , and the discrete case presented in the machine learning literature [ref]7 [ref]8. We start by noting that our α𝛼\\alpha parameter matches the α𝛼\\alpha used in prior machine learning literature related to the “α𝛼\\alpha-entmax transformation” [ref]7 [ref]8. In the definition of Tsallis entropies (6), our α𝛼\\alpha corresponds to the entropic index q𝑞q defined by Tsallis [ref]13.\nHowever, our (2−α)2𝛼(2-\\alpha)-exponential families correspond to the q𝑞q-exponential families as defined by Naudts , and to the t𝑡t-exponential families described by Ding and Vishwanathan  (which include the t𝑡t-Student distribution). The family of Amari’s α𝛼\\alpha-divergences relates to this q𝑞q as α=2​q−1𝛼2𝑞1\\alpha=2q-1 [18, §4.3]. These differences in notation have historical reasons, and they are explained by the different ways in which Tsallis entropies relate to q𝑞q-exponential families.\nIn fact, the physics literature has defined q𝑞q-exponential distributions in two distinct ways, as we next describe. Note first that the ΩΩ\\Omega-RPM in our Def. 2.1 is a generalization of the free energy variational principle, if we see −fθ​(t)=−θ⊤​ϕ​(t)subscript𝑓𝜃𝑡superscript𝜃topitalic-ϕ𝑡-f_{\\theta}(t)=-\\theta^{\\top}\\phi(t) as an energy function and ΩΩ\\Omega the entropy scaled by a temperature.\nLet Ω=ΩαΩsubscriptΩ𝛼\\Omega=\\Omega_{\\alpha} be the Tsallis α𝛼\\alpha-entropy.\nAn equivalent constrained version of this problem is the maximum entropy (maxent) principle : The solution of this problem corresponds to a distribution in the (2−α)2𝛼(2-\\alpha)-exponential family (7): for some Lagrange multiplier θ𝜃\\theta. However, this construction differs from the one by Tsallis [ref]13 and others, who use escort distributions (Eq. 5) in the expectation constraints. Namely, instead of (27), they consider the problem: The solution of (29) is of the form where θ𝜃\\theta is again a Lagrange multiplier. This is derived, for example, in [50, Eq. 15].\nThere are two main differences between (28) and (30): While (28) involves the (2−α)2𝛼(2-\\alpha)-exponential, (30) involves the α𝛼\\alpha-exponential. In (28), the normalizing term Aα​(θ)subscript𝐴𝛼𝜃A_{\\alpha}(\\theta) is inside the (2−α)2𝛼(2-\\alpha)-exponential. In (30), there is an normalizing factor Bα​(θ)subscript𝐵𝛼𝜃B_{\\alpha}(\\theta) outside the α𝛼\\alpha-exponential. Naturally, when α=1𝛼1\\alpha=1, these two problems become equivalent, since an additive term inside the exponential is equivalent to a multiplicative term outside. However, this does not happen with β𝛽\\beta-exponentials (expβ⁡(u+v)≠expβ⁡(u)​expβ⁡(v)subscript𝛽𝑢𝑣subscript𝛽𝑢subscript𝛽𝑣\\exp_{\\beta}(u+v)\\neq\\exp_{\\beta}(u)\\exp_{\\beta}(v) in general, for β≠1𝛽1\\beta\\neq 1), and therefore these two alternative paths lead to two different definitions of q𝑞q-exponential families. Unfortunately, both have been considered in the physics literature, under the same name, and\nthis has been subject of debate. Quoting Naudts [10, §1]: “An important question is then whether in the modification the normalization should stand in front of the deformed exponential function, or whether it should be included as ln⁡Z​(β)𝑍𝛽\\ln Z(\\beta) inside. From the general formalism mentioned above it follows\nthat the latter is the right way to go.” Throughout our paper, we use the definition of  , equivalent to the maxent problem (27).\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: We discuss here the relation between the (2−α)2𝛼(2-\\alpha)-exponential family of distributions as presented in Prop. 2.3 and the distributions arising from the Tsallis maxent principle [ref]13.
