      "content": "Paper Title: Maximizing Latent Capacity of Spatial Transcriptomics Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe observe that ST data suffer from the modality bias phenomenon. As shown in Fig. 1A-C, there is a significant inconsistent contribution to the data label among the morphology (Mor.) modality, transcriptomics (Tra.) modality and spatial (Spa.) modality. We use the interpretable method (Shapley Value  ) to show the differences in the contribution of data from different modalities to the ground truth (Sec. 4.2). As shown in Fig. 1B, in the coronal mouse brain dataset (Coronal), the contribution of the Mor. modality is not consistent, and in most regions the contribution of Mor. modality is negligible. However, in some specific tissue structures (e.g., hippocampus), the Mor. modality provides a stronger contribution. Furthermore, the violin plots in Fig. 1C show the statistical evidence of the modality bias phenomenon and it’s mitigation by MuST. The modality bias phenomenon causes some methods to ignore weaker modalities such as Mor. and Spa., resulting in a loss of information. Further evidence on Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 shows that modality bias phenomenon in contributions is common in ST data (Fig. 1C). We propose MuST, a robust augmentation-based manifold learning ST method for several downstream tasks by fusing multiple modalities. MuST mitigates the modality bias phenomenon by introducing topology knowledge and a topology fusion loss function (evidence in Fig. 1B). MuST plays a crucial role in balancing the contributions of different modalities, thereby reducing information loss. The framework of MuST is shown in Fig. 1D. Specifically, MuST first fuses the Spa. information into the Mor./Tra. spot embedding space by the Mor./Tra. encoder. Then we fuse both Mor./Tra. spot embedding spaces into the universal latent space (fused spot embedding space) with the fusion encoder. We use a topology discovery strategy to accurately estimate global and local information for different modalities to discover the local connection in Mor./Tra. embedding spaces based on k𝑘k-nearest neighbour (k𝑘kNN). The superposition of local connections is then used to describe the global relationships of the data, i.e. a non-neighbouring point can be described by passing through several levels of neighbourhood relationships. To make the data distribution in the representation space more realistic, we dynamically generate new samples using neighbourhood-based interpolation and use the generated spots in the training process. Finally, we design topology fusion loss functions to fuse local and global information from different modalities using augmented data. (Fig. 4.3). The universal latent space learned by MuST combines local and global information from different modalities to perform downstream tasks (Fig. 1E). Specifically, a spatial clustering task using clustering methods (e.g., mclust ), a spot visualisation task using visualisation methods (e.g., an MLP network based on topology loss [ref]45 and UMAP ), marker gene analysis task using sensitivity analysis , spatial trajectory inference task using PAGA  method, and spatial deconvolution task using Lasso  method on the clustering results. The downstream tasks corroborate each other and provide a better understanding of the ST data. A comparison is made with several methods, including GraphST , STAGATE , DeepST , SpaGCN , MUSE , and stSME  based on mean relative rank error (MRRE) score, adjusted rand index (ARI) score, and biological significance analysis.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: tasks (Fig. 1E).
