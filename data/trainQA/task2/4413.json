      "content": "Paper Title: PhishSim: Aiding Phishing Website Detection with a Feature-Free Tool\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere is significant research focusing on phishing detection. Some studies focus on the use of blacklists and whitelists in anti-phishing systems. Blacklist-based methods keep a list of domain names or links to known phishing websites and alert users if they try to visit those sites. However, phishing websites are highly dynamic, and the average lifetime of a phishing webpage is only a few hours . In many cases, zero-hour phishing attacks easily bypass blacklist-based methods. Meanwhile, whitelist-based approaches allow users to browse only those webpages that are deemed safe, which is often impractical. Other studies in phishing detection use similarity-based methods to measure similarities between websites by analyzing a website’s textual content or screenshot. Text similarity-based methods analyze the semantics of the textual content of emails and webpages to decide whether they classify as a phishing attempt. This method is likely to fail in the future with the increased use of code obfuscation techniques [ref]25. A past study by Chen et al.  introduced the use of the normalized compression distance (NCD) to measure visual similarities between webpages using the website screenshots. Their work is based on the assumption that phishing websites usually look almost identical to the legitimate website they are targeting. However, this method might not perform well when detecting phishing websites which have a distinct appearance to the target website (Figure 6 and Figure 7). Cui et al.  proposed the proportional distance metric, which computes similarities between websites based on the number of occurrences of a predefined set of HTML tags. A more recent work by Feng et al.  studied the use of Doc2Vec, which is a deep learning based method to create a numerical representation of phishing websites, and performed phishing website detection based on the similarity of the website’s numerical representation. Several other studies have attempted to find intrinsic characteristics of phishing websites and use machine learning algorithms to perform classification based on these features. Whittaker et al.  introduced a classification system to maintain Google’s phishing blacklist automatically based on features extracted from the website’s URL, page hosting information, and page content. Furthermore, Zhang et al.  developed a framework, called CANTINA, to identify phishing targets using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) analysis and seven other content-based heuristics, including domain age, logo image and domain name inconsistency, as well as suspicious links in the HTML. Purwanto et al.  designed a new compression-based algorithm PhishZip to detect phishing websites. Xiang et al.  improved CANTINA by proposing a more comprehensive framework to detect phishing websites named CANTINA+, which makes use of URL-based, HTML-based, and web-based features. Xiang and Hong  also proposed a hybrid phishing detection approach by extracting keywords and performing identity discovery with named entity recognition. Araujo and Martinez-Rico proposed a phishing detection system which combines the use of website link and language-model (LM)-based features . Meanwhile, Zhang et al.  introduced a phishing website detection system that analyses the website’s textual and visual content, and assesses the similarities. In a recent study, Quinkert et al.  attempted to identify scams and phishing by looking for homograph domains that use visually similar Unicode characters to create URLs that look identical. Several past studies focused on using natural language processing (NLP) based techniques to perform phishing website classification. Zhang et al.  proposed the use of text semantic features together with statistical features from the website to improve Chinese phishing website detection. Meanwhile, Opara et al. [ref]30 proposed HTMLPhish which uses convolutional neural networks to learn the feature representation of websites based on the semantic dependencies of the website’s textual content. The use of semantic analysis has shown to perform well in identifying phishing and legitimate websites, since specific words has shown to occur more frequently in phishing websites , e.g. email, sign, account, password. However, the use of NLP based techniques limits the phishing detection to a specific language.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: of the textual content of emails and webpages to decide whether they classify as a phishing attempt.
