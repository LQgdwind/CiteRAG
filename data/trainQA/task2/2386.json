      "content": "Paper Title: GGT: Graph-Guided Testing for Adversarial Sample Detection of Deep Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep Neural Networks (DNN) have been widely used in many applications, e.g., autopilot [ref]1, speech recognition [ref]2, and face recognition . For certain tasks, its capability is even better than humans, making it an indispensable part of some critical systems, such as self-driving cars [ref]1, access control systems , and radio systems . However, the safety of DNN has been widely concerned, i.e., it is vulnerable to adversarial samples, which were first discovered by Szegedy et al.  and means a kind of samples formed by adding a small perturbation to natural samples. The tiny changes of samples usually do not affect human judgment, but it can indeed make the trained model return a different output from the original sample with high confidence. The researchers of the Machine Learning (ML) community have been studying the relationship between adversarial samples and DNN trustworthiness . From the perspective of algorithm, it is widely considered that the existence of adversarial samples is caused by the extremely high dimension of input feature space and the linear nature of the DNN model ; while other researchers may also argue that adversarial samples are not the problem of model structure, but rather the features of datasets . The Software Engineering (SE) community, on the other hand, considers the DNN model as a kind of software and adversarial samples as the bugs hidden inside the program. To detect potential defects of a DNN model, various testing methods were proposed to perform quantitative analysis on the quality of DNN models. Neural coverage  is the most used and the first criteria for testing. After that, more and more testing methods are emerging, e.g., surprise adequacy , mutation testing , neuron boundary coverage , DeepXplore , DeepInspect , fuzzing testing , and the integrated testing framework . Several DNN testing methods were validated to be effective in detecting adversarial samples as a kind of bug in DNN systems. For instance, Wang et al.  used Model Mutation Testing (MMT) to detect adversarial samples; Kim et al.  showed that adversarial samples and normal samples have different surprise adequacy; Wang et al. [ref]19 found that adversarial samples can be distinguished with the model hidden layer output. However, adversarial sample detection mechanisms may be still vulnerable to adaptive attacks, i.e., the attacker grabs the model information and defense strategy. Tramer et al. evaluated  the most recent works on adversarial defense and detection proposed by the ML community. They found that almost all of these methods can be circumvented with their accuracy substantially reduced from what was originally claimed. One possible reason is that most of the evaluated methods are based on a single model, and thus are very easy to be targeted. MMT is one of the state-of-the-art multiple-model method on detecting adversarial samples . The idea is that adversarial samples are more sensitive to the slight change of the decision boundary. It first creates a group of mutated models and then detects adversarial samples based on the consistency of the outputs generated by the mutated models and the original model. Though MMT achieved great success in adversarial sample detection, there are two main disadvantages that may hinder its wide application in reality. First, it may need over 100 mutated DNN models (with a similar computational cost to the original model) to detect adversarial samples, leading to an unacceptable cost in practical use [ref]19, especially on the embedded systems with limited computational and storage resources. Second, since the mutated models have very similar decision boundaries to the original model, such lack of diversity could make MMT fail to detect high-confidence adversarial samples relatively far from the decision boundary. To overcome the above shortcomings, in this paper, we propose Graph-Guided Testing (GGT) for adversarial detection, which is also a multiple-model method. We argue that DNN of a certain structure can be beneficial to image classification, as well as adversarial detection, while the structure of DNN can be designed or optimized by the theory in network science. The relational graph is the most recently proposed technology to facilitate the design of DNN structure. According to the characteristics of the relational graph, we selectively remove some of the edges in the graph to achieve the pruning of DNN and obtain diverse decision boundaries. We also exploit the average number of edges connected to a node, i.e., Average Degree (AD), and the average distance between any two nodes in the network, i.e., Average Shortest Path Length (ASPL), to obtain more competitive detection results. By comparing with MMT, the generated DNN models in our GGT have much less floating point operations (FLOPs), about only 5% of the original model, and meanwhile, the high diversity of DNN structure leads to significantly better performance on detecting adversarial samples with an even smaller number of models required. In particular, we make the following contributions. We propose a graph-guided pruning method for DNN models to significantly reduce the model computational cost with low accuracy loss, where the Average Degree (AD) of the graph is used to control the number of FLOPs in the generated DNN model. We propose Graph-Guided Testing (GGT) for adversarial detection, which can detect adversarial samples more efficiently, i.e., using significantly fewer additional models with much less computational cost, by comparing with MMT. We find that the Average Shortest Path Length (ASPL) is correlated with both the accuracy of individual models and the adversarial detection performance of GGT. The graph with shorter ASPL can naturally generate a DNN model with a higher accuracy, which can be further used to better distinguish adversarial samples and normal samples, and thus is more suitable to establish our GGT. We compare our GGT with MMT on CIFAR10 and SVHN, and find that GGT indeed outperforms MMT both on accuracy and efficiency. MMT achieves the average accuracy of 74.74% and 44.79% on CIFAR10 and SVHN by using 51.12 and 77.16 models on average, respectively; while GGT detects 93.61% of adversarial samples on CIFAR10 and 94.46% on SVHN with only 30.04 and 28.50 pruned models on average, respectively. Moreover, the FLOPs of a single model adopted in GGT is only 5.22% of the model adopted in MMT. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Next, we summarize the related works. In Section III, we discuss our research questions. In Section IV, we introduce our method, followed by the results in Section V. Finally, we give the threats to validation in Section VI and the paper is concluded in Section VII.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have been widely used in many applications, e.g., autopilot [ref]1, speech recognition [ref]2, and face recognition .
