      "content": "Paper Title: Prescriptive Process Monitoring: Quo Vadis?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe presented framework provides an overview of existing prescriptive process monitoring methods by categorizing them according to their objectives and targets. The framework also presents different methods available and different ways these methods enable reaching particular objectives. The overview unveils several gaps and associated implications for future research. First, we observe that in the vast majority of previous studies, the proposed prescriptive process monitoring methods have been tested using synthetic and/or real-life event logs. However, the validation of the method is done using a real-world or synthetic observational event log, but not in real-life settings. An attempt to test the effectiveness of interventions in real-life settings was made by Dees et al. . Their study showed that the predictions were rather accurate, but the interventions did not lead to the desired outcomes. Thus, validations of methods should be done in real-life settings to ensure their usefulness in practice, as also previously highlighted by . Second, the current state-of-the-art in the field is focused on identifying cases in which interventions should be applied and finding the point in time an intervention should be triggered during the execution of a case. In contrast, little attention has been given to the problem of discovering which interventions could be applied to optimize a process with respect to a performance objective. Discrete methods leave it up to the users (stakeholders) to define the possible intervention(s) a priori (e.g.,  ). Those methods that use observational event logs from BPI challenges444https://www.tf-pm.org/competitions-awards/bpi-challenge, rely on winner reports to identify the possible interventions (e.g.,  ). Continuous methods, on the other hand, focus on recommending the next task(s) (e.g.,  [ref]6 ) or resource allocation (e.g.,   ). Thus, one direction for further research is designing methods to support the discovery of interventions from business process event logs, or from textual documentation, or other unstructured or structured metadata about the process. Related to the above problem of discovering interventions, another gap in existing research relates to the problem of designing and tuning policies for prescriptive process monitoring. Existing prediction-based methods (e.g., 6 6) prescribe an intervention when the probability of a negative outcome exceeds a defined threshold. However, because the predictive models upon which methods rely are based on correlation (as opposed to causal relations), the prescriptions produced by this method might not address the cause of the negative outcome or poor performance (e.g. the cause of delay). In this respect, we note that only a few existing methods take into account causality in policy design (e.g.,  ). Thus, developing policy design techniques that take into account causality is another direction for further research. As discussed in  , the choice of whether or not to apply an intervention or which intervention to apply often depends on contextual factors. Some interventions may lead to prove ineffective or counter-productive, for example, due to second-order effects. For example, an intervention wherein a customer is contacted pro-actively in order to prevent a customer complaint may actually heighten the probability of a complaint . Similarly, assigning a resource to a case that is running late might lead to other cases being neglected, thus creating delays elsewhere and thus leading to a higher ratio of delayed cases. Detecting such second-order effects requires human judgment and iterative policy validation (e.g. via AB testing). In this respect, it is striking that existing prescriptive process monitoring methods do not take into account the need to interact with human decision-makers. A crucial step in this direction is the ability to explain why the prescriptive monitoring system recommends a given intervention. There are two aspects to this question. First, explaining the prediction that underpins a given prescription (prediction explanation), and second, explaining the policy that is used to trigger the prescription (policy explanation). A possible direction to enhance the applicability of prescriptive monitoring methods in practice is to integrate explainability mechanisms into them. While several proposals have been made to enhancement the explainability of predictive process monitoring methods 9, the question of policy explanation in the area of prescriptive process monitoring is unexplored. In other words, current methods do not incorporate a mechanism to explain why an intervention is recommended by the method for a given case and in a given state. Besides the above gaps, the SLR highlights that the majority of methods in the field aim to improve processes along the temporal perspective (e.g. cycle time, processing time, deadline violations). In comparison, other performance dimensions are represented in only a few examples (quality in 0  , revenue in  8). Thus, another research direction is to investigate other performance objectives that could be enhanced via prescriptive process monitoring. Finally, our review also highlights a lack of common terminology in the field. This might be due to the novelty of the research field of prescriptive process monitoring. The literature refers to methods with a wide range of names. As such, the terms ”proactive process adaptation”, ”on-the-fly resource allocation”, ”next-step recommendation” are all used to describe the development and application of prescriptive process monitoring methods. This highlights the need for common terminology.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: rely on winner reports to identify the possible interventions (e.g.,  ).
