We compare state-of-the-art methods in the settings of unsupervised graph classification tasks and further extend to node classification, where we can only access the adjacency matrix and node features of graphs without label information. We conduct experiments on nine benchmark datasets 5, including four bioinformatics datasets (PTC-MR, PROTEINS, NCI1, DD) and five social network datasets (COLLAB, IMDB-BINARY, IMDB-MULTI, REDDIT-BINARY, and REDDIT-M5K) for graph classification tasks and four datasets (Pubmed, Coauthor-CS, Amazon-Photo, Amazon-Computer) for node classification tasks. Datasets details are in Appendix¬†E.2. Baselines. We compare with three groups of baselines for graph classification. The first group is supervised GNNs including GCN  and GIN . The second group includes the graph kernel methods: Weisfeiler-Lehman Sub-tree kernel (WL)  and Deep Grph Kernels (DGK) . The last group includes unsupervised graph representation learning methods: Sub2Vec , Graph2Vec 6, InfoGraph , GraphCL [ref]44, CuCo , AD-GCL , where the last four methods are state-of-the-art contrast-based graph representation learning methods. For node classification, we compare nmrGCL with supervised methods including GCN  and GIN  and contrast-based self-supervised methods: DGI [ref]38, MVGRL , GCA  and CCA-SSG . Implementation Details.\nFor graph classification, we use the graph isomorphism network (GIN)  as the encoder for its expressiveness in distinguishing the structure to obtain the graph-level representation.\nSpecifically, we adopt a three-layer GIN with 32 hidden units in each layer and a sum pooling readout function.\nThen the embeddings generated by the encoder are fed into the downstream SVM classifier.\nThe threshold Œ¥ùõø\\delta in the removal operation is set to 0.70.70.7.\nWe utilize the 10-fold CV to train the SVM and record mean accuracy with standard variation of five-time trials.\nOther hyper-parameters remain consistency with the GraphCL [ref]44.\nFor node classification tasks, we follow settings of DGI [ref]38 which uses the GCN as the encoder and logistic regression downstream classifier.\nMore details of the experimental setup can be found in Appendix¬†E.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: methods: Weisfeiler-Lehman Sub-tree kernel (WL)  and Deep Grph Kernels (DGK) . The last group includes unsupervised graph representation learning methods: Sub2Vec , Graph2Vec 6, InfoGraph , GraphCL [ref]44, CuCo , AD-GCL , where the last four methods are state-of-the-art contrast-based graph representation learning methods. For node classification, we compare nmrGCL with supervised methods\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
