      "content": "Paper Title: XNLP-completeness for Parameterized Problems on Graphs with a Linear Structure\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSince the inception of parameterized complexity in the late 1980s and early 1990s, much research has\nbeen done on establishing the complexity of parameterized problems.\nTypically one is particularly interested in either designing FPT-algorithms for these problems, or to prove them W​[t]𝑊delimited-[]𝑡W[t]-hard, for some t𝑡t, which provides evidence that such a problem is not likely to be fixed-parameter tractable.\nAs opposed to the classical P versus NP-complete setting, the question of membership in some class of the W𝑊W-hierarchy is often much less clear.\nWhile some natural problems such as Independent Set and Dominating Set are known to be W​𝑊delimited-[]1W-complete and W​[ref]2𝑊delimited-[]2W[ref]2-complete, respectively, many other problems are unknown to be complete\nfor a class of parameterized problems, and even conjectured not to be in the W𝑊W-hierarchy.\nRecently, building upon work by Elberfeld et al. 3, Bodlaender et al. \nintroduced a complexity class called XNLP, which gives a way of addressing this question. The class XNLP consists of the parameterized problems that can be solved with a non-deterministic algorithm that uses f​(k)​log⁡n𝑓𝑘𝑛f(k)\\log n space and f​(k)​nc𝑓𝑘superscript𝑛𝑐f(k)n^{c} time, where f𝑓f is a computable function, n𝑛n is the input size, k𝑘k is the parameter and c𝑐c is a constant. In particular, XNLP-hardness implies W​[t]𝑊delimited-[]𝑡W[t]-hardness for all t𝑡t. Therefore it is unlikely that any XNLP-hard problem is complete for some W​[t]𝑊delimited-[]𝑡W[t]. One success story within parameterized algorithms and complexity is the use of width measures of graphs as parameters (see, e.g., 0).\nTypically, such width measures are defined in terms of a tree-like decomposition of a graph,\nand the width describes the complexity of the decomposition, and therefore, in turn, of the graph.\nSuch width measures also have linear variants, where the decomposition resembles a path instead of a tree.\nIn this work, we provide evidence that the class\nXNLP is the ‘natural home’ for hard\nproblems parameterized by linear width measures. Let us give some intuitive explanation why this is the case.\nA typical dynamic programming algorithm that uses such a linear decomposition\nstores, at each node of the path, some partial solutions associated with it.\nThe table entries associated with the nodes are then filled in the order in which they appear on the path.\nIf one turns such an algorithm into a nondeterministic algorithm,\nit often suffices at the i𝑖i-th node to nondeterministically determine the\ntable index corresponding to the correct partial solution (if it exists) from the table entry that was\npreviously determined for the (i−1)𝑖1(i-1)-th node.\nIn such a case, membership in XNLP follows if\neach single table entry of such a DP algorithm can be represented by f​(k)​log⁡n𝑓𝑘𝑛f(k)\\log n bits\n(where k𝑘k is the width)\nand if the nondeterministic step does not require a computation that uses significantly more space.\nThis is often the case.\nNow, such an approach fails for tree-like decompositions,\nsince even a nondeterministic algorithm might have to keep\ntoo many table entries at some point during the computation.\nOne common situation in which this occurs is when the algorithm needs to store one table entry\nfor each level of the decomposition.\nThis incurs a multiplicative factor in the memory usage that depends on the height of the tree,\nwhich can be prohibitively large. In this direction, Bodlaender et al.  showed that List Colouring parameterized by the pathwidth of the input graph, and Bandwidth are XNLP-complete.\nIn this paper,\nwe show XNLP-completeness of fundamental graph problems parameterized by linear variants of well-established width measures, such as pathwidth, linear clique-width and linear mim-width, as well as some of their logarithmic analogues. Besides showing W​[t]𝑊delimited-[]𝑡W[t]-hardness for all t𝑡t, XNLP-hardness also provides insight into the space complexity of parameterized problems. Pilipczuk and Wrochna  proposed the following\nconjecture.111The statement of the conjecture here is\nequivalent to the conjecture on time and memory use for the Longest Common Subsequence problem\nfrom ; the name of the conjecture is taken as analogue to\nthe naming of XP as problems that use slice-wise polynomial time (see [10, Section 1.1]). XNLP-hard problems do not have an algorithm, that runs in nf​(k)superscript𝑛𝑓𝑘n^{f(k)} time and f​(k)​nc𝑓𝑘superscript𝑛𝑐f(k)n^{c} space, with f𝑓f a computable function, k𝑘k the parameter, n𝑛n the input size, and c𝑐c a constant. Typically, membership in XP for the problems studied in our paper follows from a dynamic programming approach that uses a significant amount of memory. XNLP-hardness indicates (via Conjecture 1.1) that dynamic programming is in some sense ‘optimal’ (no XP algorithm can use ‘significantly less’ memory).\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: of membership in some class of the W𝑊W-hierarchy is often much less clear.\nWhile some natural problems such as Independent Set and Dominating Set are known to be W​𝑊delimited-[]1W-complete and W​[ref]2𝑊delimited-[]2W[ref]2-complete, respectively, many other problems are unknown to be complete\nfor a class of parameterized problems, and even conjectured not to be in the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
