      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring the Reasoning Abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): A Comprehensive Survey on Emerging Trends in Multimodal Reasoning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMLLMs can function as tools to empower language models in handling various modalities and addressing challenging visual reasoning tasks. We briefly review these works from different application perspectives, as illustrated in Table 3. While current MLLM models demonstrate proficiency in visual tasks such as image classification and captioning, they encounter difficulties with more complex visual operations, like visual editing, due to inherent requirements for reasoning and planning.\nFor instance, replacing a person’s face with a cat’s face in an image involves face detection, person recognition, cat face generation, and merging the new face into the original image.\nCritical reasoning is required to break down the tasks and develop a detailed execution plan.\nMLLMs can play a pivotal role in carrying out these decomposed steps. To solve compositional visual reasoning tasks, VISPROG [ref]195 utilizes MLLMs as a toolset within a modular and interpretable neuro-symbolic system.\nThis system, designed for comprehensive visual understanding and manipulation, leverages GPT-3 to generate programs through in-context learning.\nThese programs coordinate different modules, such as OWL-ViT  for open vocabulary localization, DSFD  for face detection, MaskFormer  for segmentation, CLIP  for image selection and classification, ViLT  for visual question answering, and Stable Diffusion 2 for object replacement.\nAdditional tools such as Python Imaging Library111https://pypi.org/project/pillow/ (Pillow) and OpenCV222https://opencv.org/ are also used for image manipulation.\nVISPROG can handle various complex visual reasoning tasks, including compositional VQA, zero-shot reasoning on image pairs, factual knowledge object tagging, and image editing using natural language. Following dialog instructions can become more complex than single-step instructions due to their context-dependent nature.\nMulti-turn dialogue understanding requires reasoning based on dialog history.\nMLLMs can serve as tools for LLMs to facilitate dialogs that incorporate visual inputs and outputs, drawing on the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to interpret dialog instructions. Visual ChatGPT , incorporating various MLLM, enables users to interact with ChatGPT using both text and images.\nThis system harnesses MLLMs such as BLIP , Stable Diffusion 2, and other visual foundation models like Pix2Pix 2, ControlNet 3.\nIt is capable of performing tasks like image captioning, image question answering, and image editing during conversations.\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) [ref]104 reasoning method is used for case that requires collaboration between multiple visual models. Additionally, MM-ReAct  utilizes the ReAct  planning method alongside a suite of image and video tools for a stronger capacity of visual tasks.\nThese tools cover a wide range of functions, including image captioning, image tagging, dense captioning, celebrity recognition, receipt scanning, OCR, and Bing search.\nThis enables MM-ReAct to handle difficult tasks such as Visual Math and Text Reasoning, Visual-Conditioned Jokes/Memes, and Visual Planning. MLLMs are usually customized for specific modalities, such as images, which poses a challenge when trying to integrate their usage across varied domains like mathematics, the web, tables, and more.\nFor instance, solving a math problem depicted in an image requires the visual model to first interpret the image and then invoke the math model for a solution.\nAddressing this challenge entails fostering reasoning and planning among various modality models.\nBy conceptualizing all the modality models as tools and leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLM, recent efforts aim to integrate additional modalities beyond the visual domain, such as web content, tables, office documents, and robotic data.\nThis approach contributes to the development of a more powerful multimodal model. Chameleon  exemplifies this approach.\nIt can utilize a variety of tools, such as existing vision models, web search engines, Python functions, and heuristic-based modules.\nCapable of handling tasks across image, web, knowledge, math, and table domains, Chameleon synthesizes programs by combining these tools to coordinate their sequence through an LLM-driven planner for multistep tasks. TaskMatrix.AI  provides a comprehensive set of APIs catering to a wide range of tasks.\nThese include image editing, image-based question answering, image captioning, text-to-image conversion, and transformations like image-to-sketch/depth/hed/line.\nFurthermore, TaskMatrix.AI extends its utility to conversational robotics and IoT device control, offering APIs for tasks like robotics pick, move, and put, car air conditioner control, TV operation, and music playback. TaskMatrix.AI utilizes the CoT [ref]104 reasoning method to device tool usage plans.\n\nReference markers found: [195]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]195: required to break down the tasks and develop a detailed execution plan.\nMLLMs can play a pivotal role in carrying out these decomposed steps.
