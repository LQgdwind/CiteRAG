      "content": "Paper Title: Boundary-aware Supervoxel-level Iteratively Refined Interactive 3D Image Segmentation with Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMedical image segmentation is fundamental and critically important for a broad spectrum of medical imaging tasks such as measurement of organs and lesions, diagnosis and treatment planning. A variety of deep learning methods have been proposed for automatic medical image segmentation and shown great promise [ref]1  .\nHowever, a bottleneck for their wide application lies in requiring a large volume of manually labeled data for training which is labor-intensive and hard to meet for many application scenarios.\nAs a result, the accuracy and robustness of the current automatic methods often fail to meet the standard for clinical use.\nInteractive segmentation is introduced to leverage user interactions, mostly in the form of clicks, scribbles, or bounding boxes, to obtain accurate segmentation through iteratively refinement [ref]4  [ref]6.\nWhile typically iterative in nature, the current interactive segmentation methods usually treat each refinement process independently and fail to capture the dynamics of successive interactions.\nAs a result, they are unable to ensure that the corrected segmentation always stays. In other words, one error prediction can be corrected with user interactions and mispredicted again in a later iteration, which may result in stagnation or even degradation in performance. In this paper, as an extension of our previous work , we model iteratively refined interactive image segmentation problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and use reinforcement learning to learn a policy that maps states to probabilities of taking each available primitive action to update the segmentation results. In this way, at each refinement iteration, the model updates the labels of all voxels by taking consideration of not only the current state but also the previous state and its actions.\nTo reduce the exploration space to a tractable size and at the same time explicitly model the dependencies among voxels, the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is employed, where all agents are required to share the same policy and thus collaborate and communicate with each other through convolutional layers. The design of reward is critical for the success of reinforcement learning. Considering that boundary voxels are more important for segmentation, we here propose a boundary-aware reward, consisting of the global reward and the boundary reward. The global reward measures the relative cross-entropy gain between two consecutive iterations, with a positive reward for improved segmentation so that the new prediction is forced to outperform the previous one. The boundary reward emphasizes the correctness of the segmentation boundary by measuring the distance between each voxel and the ground truth boundary voxels. While the global reward ensures refinement convergence, the boundary reward is expected to further improve the accuracy of segmentation. Another important factor for interactive segmentation is the form of user interactions. Point-clicking is fast and easy, but is susceptible and less accurate. Scribbles and bounding boxes are more stable and robust, but demand more efforts of users. To combine the advantage of the above two types of interactions, we propose a supervoxel-clicking based interaction design, i.e., clicking on a point suggests that the corresponding supervoxel is error prone. The supervoxel-clicking based interaction is expected to be more robust to random variations in clicking positions. Integrating the above design of reward and interaction to the MARL-based framework, we here propose a novel Boundary-aware Supervoxel-level Iteratively Refined Interactive Segmentation (BS-IRIS) for 3D medical images.\nWhile most interactive segmentation methods require an initial segmentation mask (e.g. obtained with a certain automatic CNN)  [ref]6 [ref]4, BS-IRIS deals with the setting where users label from scratch.\nWe evaluate BS-IRIS with four publicly available challenge datasets, BraTS2015 , BraTS2019 , MM-WHS , and NCI-ISBI2013 , which covers medical images of brain tumor, heart, and prostate.\nThe experimental results have demonstrated that BS-IRIS outperforms not only the state-of-the-art automatic CNNs in each corresponding challenges, but also several state-of-the-art interactive medical image segmentation methods.\nFurthermore, BS-IRIS is shown to be robust to different interaction quality, faster to converge, and requires less human interactions. This paper is an extension of our preliminary work .\nModeling the interactive segmentation task with an MDP, both methods adopt a MARL-based framework for interactive segmentation of 3D medical images.\nThe contributions of this paper on top of  are summarized as follows. A novel boundary-aware reward function that dynamically incorporates the boundary information and encourages agents to explore more efficiently. A new form of supervoxel-clicking based interaction with the combined advantage of point clicking and scribbles.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: such as measurement of organs and lesions, diagnosis and treatment planning.
