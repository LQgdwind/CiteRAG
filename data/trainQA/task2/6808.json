      "content": "Paper Title: Masked Spatio-Temporal Structure Prediction for Self-supervised Learning on Point Cloud Videos\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSupervised learning dominates point cloud video research.  [ref]12 and   [ref]42  use convolution-based methods and attention-based methods to implicitly learn the long-term features of point cloud videos, respectively. In addition,    apply empirical-based dynamics methods modeling point cloud videos. Wang et al.  introduced temporal rank pooling  to capture the frame-level dynamics. Zhong et al.  proposed a two-stream framework and used feature-level ST-surfaces [ref]30 in the dynamics learning branch. Liu et al.  used a scene flow estimator  or an alternative grouping method to do point tracking for dynamics modeling. Although these methods are effective, they require complex calculations or additional modules. Self-supervised learning on point cloud videos is understudied  . Wang et al.  pre-trained the encoder by predicting the temporal order of shuffled segments to learn the dynamics of point cloud videos. Zhang et al.  developed complete-to-partial 4D distillation to predict the representations of point cloud frames within a short time window. However, these methods learn motion information using clip-level or frame-level pretext tasks. In this paper, we propose the temporal cardinality difference prediction for fine-grained dynamics learning on point cloud videos.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: Supervised learning dominates point cloud video research.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
