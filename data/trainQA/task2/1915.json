      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-task Learning with Attention for End-to-end Autonomous Driving\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the field of autonomous driving, end-to-end behavioral\ncloning has emerged recently, and many deep networks trained\nto mimic expert demonstrations have shown reasonable\nperformances from lane-keeping  0 to point-to-point navigation\n [ref]7.\nTypically, those deep networks are trained by using an offline\ndataset generated by an expert-driver (off-policy), or they\nlean a control policy by rolling out the environment itself\nto find good rewards using reinforcement learning (on-policy). However, previous studies have revealed several critical limitations.\nFirstly, an agent that learned a control policy from\nan offline dataset may not be able to make accurate decisions\nin previously unobserved environments.\nIn a study [ref]7 conducted by using an\nopen-source driving simulator CARLA [ref]10,\nit was reported that the driving performance of the imitation\nlearning agent considerably drops under those\nconditions such as untrained urban area, weather conditions,\nand traffic congestion. Secondly, it is important to know\nhow well a network perceives visual inputs for such a\nsafety-critical application of autonomous driving,\nbut only a few studies\naddressed this issue  [ref]21 . Therefore, in this work, we tackle the aforementioned problems\nbased on the following ideas:\n(1) Learning visual recognition sub-tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation)\nalongside can encourage the network to learn generalizable\nscene representations that are effective for decision-making.\nSimilarly to [ref]21, we also introduce\nmulti-tasking to decode scene representations as sub-tasks.\nAlthough, in the previous study, the learning process was divided\ninto perception and control, we train all tasks at the same time.\nAdditionally, we adopt traffic light classification as one of the sub-tasks.\nIn this way, an operator can easily debug the model performance\nby looking at its predictions. (2) Also, an attention mechanism\nis introduced to further improve control performance by focusing\non salient regions among the extracted features like humans do when driving.\nOur main contributions can be summarized as follows: We propose a novel multi-task attention-aware network\nfor vision-based end-to-end autonomous driving. We show that our approach achieves better or comparable\nresults with the current state-of-the-art models on the CARLA\nbenchmarks [ref]7 [ref]10. We further perform the traffic light infraction\nanalysis to quantitatively show the effectiveness of\nour approach in handling traffic lights. We study how attention layers change what network\nfocuses on by visualizing saliency maps.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: behavioral\ncloning has emerged recently, and many deep networks trained\nto mimic expert demonstrations have shown reasonable\nperformances from lane-keeping  0 to point-to-point navigation\n [ref]7.\nTypically, those deep networks are trained by using an offline\ndataset generated by an expert-driver (off-policy), or they\nlean a control policy by rolling out the environment itself\nto find\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
