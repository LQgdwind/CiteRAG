Exponential decay is first exploited in the vanilla LIF model , and it brings neuronal dynamics with stable convergence, shrinking the potential to the resting potential steadily. But, exponential decay is not efficient enough in massive neural simulations due to its multiplication operation. Therefore, linear decay replaces exponential decay in     [ref]27, and brings neuronal dynamics with the flexibility, making it possible for configurable spiking rates [ref]15. Although the two types of decay behave differently in neuronal dynamics, both of them are proven effective in SNNs  .\nSecondly, integration accumulation represents the potential accumulation induced by presynaptic spikes. Commonly, spike intensities of different time steps are considered equally high. Consequently, the discrepancies among the spikes at different time steps are ignored. To address this issue, many prior works propose to assign different weights to the input spikes at different time steps. These methods are implemented by manual settings   [ref]31 or adaptive settings    to improve biological plausibility, SNN performance, or inference efficiency.\nLastly, spike initiation functions as the resetting mechanism triggered by spike firing. There are two common resetting strategies: hard reset  and soft reset [ref]15 . When a spike is triggered, the hard reset directly sets the potential to the resting potential, while the soft reset subtracts the potential by a configurable value. Therefore, hard reset is more stable as a strict reset mechanism, while soft reset is more flexible, making configurable spiking rates feasible [ref]15. Compared with the LIF models above, our GLIF incorporates different neuronal behavioral mechanisms to increase the representation space of LIF models and improve the performance of SNNs.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: potential steadily.
