      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Sustainable Deep Learning for Multi-Label Classification on NILM\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this paper we are concerned with energy efficient ON/OFF classification of NILM data aimed at decreasing the overall energy consumption, which includes the investigation whether more complex and accurate DL approaches outweigh simpler and less consuming classical ML approaches.\nWe propose a new DL architecture that is inspired by the VGG family of architectures and RNNs for the multi-label device activity classification on NILM data. We prove that its performance is better than state of the art CNNs and CRNNs and state of the art classical ML algorithms (RF), while being much more energy efficient compared to the state of the art DL models.  Based on the presented related work it can be seen that classical ML and DL models such as used in    [ref]33   [ref]36 and  are mostly tested in a way that is better suited for the comparison with other models and not in a way that would give realistic results of performance in real-world conditions. To this end, this work examines a novel methodology that more accurately represents the performance of models in practical use cases. We approached the problem by first analysing the dataset to identify the number of active devices NùëÅN in the time window that the model is trained on. We then generated two distinct groups of mixed datasets, each comprising different sets of active and inactive devices. The first group contained mixed datasets with a fixed number of NùëÅN active devices, whereas the second group included mixed datasets with varying number of active devices between 1 and NùëÅN. To generate the groups of mixed datasets we used REFIT¬† and UK-DALE¬† low-frequency datasets, also present in Tanoni¬†et al.¬† and Langevin¬†et al.¬†. Our main contributions are as follows: We propose a novel DL CtRNN architecture focusing on reduced computational complexity which offers superior performance compared to the existing state of the art architectures with an average improvement of approximately 8 percentage points on mixed datasets derived from REFIT and UK-DALE and more than 23‚Äâ% lesser carbon footprint, making it a more sustainable solution. We propose a novel testing methodology that begins with a dataset analysis and involves generating two groups of mixed datasets that are utilized for both training and testing. By taking into account the unique properties of the original dataset when generating mixed datasets, our approach results in a more realistic evaluation of model performance, more closely reflecting real-world scenarios. We perform a comprehensive analysis taking into account performance and energy efficiency of compared approaches for NILM ON/OFF classification. This paper is organized as follows. Sections¬†I-A and ¬†I-B describe related work and contributions, respectively. Section¬†II provides the problem statement, Section¬†III elaborates on methodological aspects, Section¬†IV presents the proposed model and Section¬†V provides a comprehensive evaluation. Finally, Section¬†VI concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: (RF), while being much more energy efficient compared to the state of the art DL models.
