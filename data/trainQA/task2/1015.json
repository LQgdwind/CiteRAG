      "content": "Paper Title: Transfer Learning and SpecAugment applied to SSVEP Based BCI Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this study, we propose the use of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) as classifiers in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP). Deep neural networks (DNNs) perform very well when trained on a large amount of data , but large SSVEP datasets are not commonly available for open use. Our way to overcome this problem was to employ data augmentation and transfer learning techniques to train the DNNs, as both are known to improve the performances of DNNs on smaller datasets . We started with an open SSVEP dataset , which we consider to be large in comparison with other open databases. The electroencephalography (EEG) signals where transformed into images, specifically spectrograms, using the short-time Fourier transform (STFT). By doing so, we take advantage of the ability of convolutional DNN in classifying images, which is well documented . The neural network used in this study [ref]4 is a DCNN based on the original VGG . While the original VGG was trained on the ImageNet dataset , the VGGish DCCN we used was trained for classifying spectrograms from AudioSet [ref]6, a very large dataset composed of natural and artificial sounds. We decided to investigate this DCNN as our pretrained network for transfer learning, due to the potential task similarity between classifying spectrograms from sounds and classifying spectrograms from SSVEP signals. The structure of this network is found in Table 1. The modified version, fine-tuned for SSVEP classification, is available in Table 2. We trained the network to classify EEG signals from subjects focusing on a 12 Hz or a 15 Hz flickering visual stimulus, using only information from the Oz electrode, thus, simulating a single-channel BCI. We did not include the data from the test subject in the training or validation datasets in order to establish a scenario in which the BCI final user does not influence the classifier adjust. During the training period, to avoid overfitting the DNN, we used data augmentation, consisting of window slicing [ref]7 and the technique called SpecAugment . SpecAugment\nvery good results in improving the performances of DNNs in the task of speech recognition using spectrograms. Using it, the authors of  were able to achieve state-of-the art results on the datasets LibriSpeech 960h and Switchboard 300h. Using a LAS network and without the use of a LM, the Switchboard word error rate was reduced by 4% with the augmentation technique . Furthermore, the current (January 2021) LibriSpeech test-other best performing model uses, among other techniques, SpecAugment . We compared our results to those of classification using Filter Bank canonical correlation analysis (FBCCA) (the classification technique used by the authors of the dataset that we are using, which outperformed standard CCA in a similar dataset 0), DCNN without transfer learning and support vector machines (SVM, a common SSVEP classification method 1, 2). This paper is divided according to the following way: in section 2, we discuss related studies; in section 3 we present the SSVEP paradigm and the dataset; in section 4, we discuss data augmentation and the techniques we applied (SpecAugment  and window slicing [ref]7); in section 5, we introduce the transfer learning and the VGG network [ref]4; in section 6 we describe how we processed the dataset, created our network and trained it; in section 7, we present the results, analyzing the use of different augmentation techniques and comparing the DNN performance to alternative classification methods. Finally, in section 8, we present our conclusions.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: the short-time Fourier transform (STFT).
