      "content": "Paper Title: Sufficient Invariant Learning for Distribution Shift\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe standard approach to modern deep learning is Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) [ref]35, which minimizes the average training loss. However, ERM may not guarantee robustness in distribution shifts. To improve the generalization performance in distribution shift, Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (GDRO) minimizes worst-group loss for each step to alleviate learning spurious correlation [ref]30. Meanwhile, some studies utilize loss gradient for invariant learning. For example, Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) minimizes the gradient norm of the fixed classifier across domains [ref]2 . Some research matches the loss gradient for each domain in order to find common invariant features  . On the other hand, it is also possible to learn invariant features by conducting additional learning using re-weighting  7, performing data augmentation through domain-specific mix-up . However, such invariant learning algorithms may not guarantee sufficient invariant learning, and it is difficult to improve generalization performance. 2 shows that ERM achieves comparable domain generalization performance with other invariant learning algorithms under fair experimental conditions. In this paper, we demonstrate the necessity of learning invariant features sufficiently by showing the effective generalization performance of ASGDRO.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: The standard approach to modern deep learning is Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) [ref]35, which minimizes the average training loss.
