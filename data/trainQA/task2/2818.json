Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: Discover, Hallucinate, and Adapt: Open Compound Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur model is implemented using Pytorch v0.4.1, CUDNN v7.6.5, CUDA v9.0. Discover step\nWe use ImageNet [ref]8 pretrained Vgg-16 [ref]38 to encode style of target images. Specificallly, we use relu1_2 features. All target images are resized to have width of 512 pixels while keeping the aspect ratio (i.e., 512×\\times288). Hallucination step\nWe detail the two objective functions, LG​A​Nsubscript𝐿𝐺𝐴𝑁L_{GAN} and Ls​e​msubscript𝐿𝑠𝑒𝑚L_{sem}, which are omitted in the main paper. First, the LG​A​Nsubscript𝐿𝐺𝐴𝑁L_{GAN}  is defined as follows: Image discriminator DIsubscript𝐷𝐼D_{I} learns to classify translated source and target images while the generator G tries to produce translated images that are visually similar to target images. Second, to enforce strong semantic constraint, the Ls​e​msubscript𝐿𝑠𝑒𝑚L_{sem}  is adopted in TGCF-DA  framework. It is defined as follows: where fs​e​gsubscript𝑓𝑠𝑒𝑔f_{seg} indicates the semantic segmentation model, which is pretrained on the labeled source domain. Weights of fs​e​gsubscript𝑓𝑠𝑒𝑔f_{seg} are fixed during training. The loss function strongly encourages the model to preserve the semantics between the source image and the translated image. In the hallucination step, the source and the target images are resized to 1280×\\times720. For the memory-efficient training, we randomly crop the patches with a resolution of 1024×\\times512. For the testing, we use the original size of 1280×\\times720. Adapt step\nWe use segmentation model DeepLab V2  (for the GTA5/Synscapes experiments) and FCN-8s 5 (for SYNTHIA experiments). As noted in the main paper, we use the VGG-16 backbone network.\nFor the training, we resize the images of GTA5, Synscapes, and SYNTHIA to 1280×\\times720, 1280×\\times640, 1280×\\times760, respectively   4. We resize the target images in BDD100K to 960×\\times540, following 4.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: Our model is implemented using Pytorch v0.4.1, CUDNN v7.6.5, CUDA v9.0.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
