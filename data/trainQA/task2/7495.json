      "content": "Paper Title: Spot Check Equivalence: an Interpretable Metric for Information Elicitation Mechanisms\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn our Section¬†2, we assume that the agents will truthfully report their signal. This assumption is reasonable when applying a linear payment scheme given the performance measurement is truthful under certain settings.\nIn particular, Dasgupta and Ghosh  propose the first multi-task peer prediction mechanism. Later on, the CA mechanism  and fùëìf-MI mechanism  are proposed to generalize Dasgupta and Ghosh ‚Äôs mechanism from binary signal space to finite signal space, the MA mechanism  generalizes CA to address task-dependent strategies, the DMI mechanism [ref]14 aims to reduce the required number of tasks, Schoenebeck and Yu  handle continuous signals with a learning-based mechanism, Agarwal et¬†al.  deal with the heterogeneous agents, and Schoenebeck et¬†al. 6 address adversarial attacks in peer prediction. Furthermore, Burrell and Schoenebeck  examine the robustness of the truth-telling equilibrium with agent-based model experiments. However, when applying a non-linear payment scheme, e.g. winner-take-all, the agents may have the incentive to strategically report their signal, e.g. increasing the variance of their score to get a higher probability of being the winner. Zhang and Schoenebeck  propose a truthful winner-take-all payment scheme by adding noise to the agents‚Äô score which may hurt the incentive for effort. However, further study needs to be conducted to study the robustness of different performance measurements against strategic reports with other non-linear payment schemes. This gap indicates another potential future direction of our research.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: are proposed to generalize Dasgupta and Ghosh ‚Äôs mechanism from binary signal space to finite signal space, the MA mechanism  generalizes CA to address task-dependent strategies, the DMI mechanism [ref]14 aims to reduce the required number of tasks, Schoenebeck and Yu  handle continuous signals with a learning-based mechanism, Agarwal et¬†al.  deal with the heterogeneous agents, and Schoenebeck\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
