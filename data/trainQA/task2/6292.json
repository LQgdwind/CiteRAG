      "content": "Paper Title: Sample-Level Weighting for Multi-Task Learning with Auxiliary Tasks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn single-task learning, it has been well-established that some samples matter more than others for learning well-generalizable solutions . Some samples can be removed from the dataset at the beginning or during training without any loss of generalization performance . Others, through data set biases such as noisy or class-imbalanced data, can explicitly harm performance [ref]12. Introducing sample-level weighting in the loss function is a common strategy to mitigate these biases. Sample-level weighting for deep learning is used across many domains such as causal inference and off-policy reinforcement learning. In causal inference, inverse propensity weighting  balances the distributions of the control and treatment groups in observational data. Similarly, sample weighting can reduce training set bias caused by class imbalance [ref]28  or label noise   . Finally, sample weights can take into account prioritization based on domain knowledge e.g., in cost-sensitive learning  . In effect, across these domains, weighting samples of the original source distribution leads an algorithm to learn from a semi-synthetic target distribution favourable to the task of interest. This mechanic is explicitly exploited in the importance weighting literature [ref]4.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: dataset at the beginning or during training without any loss of generalization performance .

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
