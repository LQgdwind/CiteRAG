      "content": "Paper Title: Abstract\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile modern reinforcement learning algorithms reach super-human performance on tasks such as gameplaying, they remain woefully sample inefficient compared to humans. An algorithm that is data 0 or sample-efficient 9 requires only few samples for good performance and the study of sample-efficient control is currently an active research area    1. A powerful tool for increasing the sample-efficiency of machine learning methods is dimensionality reduction. There has been much recent work on methods that take advantage of compact, low-dimensional representations of states for search and exploration   . One of the advantages of this approach is that a good representation aids in faster and more accurate planning.\nThis holds in particular when the latent space is of much lower dimensionality than the state space[ref]61. For high-dimensional inputs, such as image data, a representation function is frequently learned to reduce the complexity for a controller. In deep reinforcement learning, the representation and the controller are learned simultaneously. Similarly, a representation can in principle be learned along with a forward model for classical planning in high-dimensional space. This paper introduces Latent Representation Prediction (LARP) networks, a novel neural network-based method for learning a domain representation and a transition function for planning within the learned latent space (Fig. 1). During training, the representation and the predictor are learned simultaneously from transitions in a self-supervised manner. We train the predictor to predict the most likely future representation, given a current representation and an action. The predictor is then used for planning by navigating the latent space defined by the representation to reach a goal state. Optimizing control in this manner after learning an environment model has the advantage of allowing for learning new reward functions in a fast and sample-efficient manner.\nAfter the representation is learned, we find said goal state by conventional path planning. Disentangling the reward from the transition function in such a way is helpful when learning for multiple or changing reward functions and aids with learning when there is no reward available at all. Thus, it is also good for a sparse or a delayed-reward setting. A problem that can arise in representation learning is the one of trivial features. This can happen when the method is optimizing an objective function that has a straightforward, but useless, solution. For example, Slow Feature Analysis (SFA)  has the objective of extracting the features of time series data that vary the least with time. This is easily fulfilled by constant functions, so SFA includes an optimization constraint to avoid constant solutions. Constant features would in a similar manner be maximally predictable representations for our system. Therefore, we study three different approaches to prevent this trivial representation from being learned, we either: (i) design the architecture such that the output is sphered, (ii) regularize it with a contrastive loss term, or (iii) include a reconstruction loss term along with an additional decoder module. We compare these approaches and validate our method experimentally on a visual environment: a viewpoint-matching task using the NORB data set , where the agent is presented with a starting viewpoint of an object and the task is to produce a sequence of actions such that the agent ends up with the goal viewpoint. As the NORB data set is embeddable on a cylinder   or a sphere , we can visualize the actions as traversing the embedded manifold.  Our approach compares favorably to state-of-the-art methods on our testbed with respect to sample efficiency, but our asymptotic performance is still outclassed by other approaches.\n\nReference markers found: [61]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]61: of this approach is that a good representation aids in faster and more accurate planning.\nThis holds in particular when the latent space is of much lower dimensionality than the state space[ref]61.
