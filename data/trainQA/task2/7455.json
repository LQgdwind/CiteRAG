      "content": "Paper Title: A Survey of Generative AI for de novo Drug Design: New Frontiers in Molecule and Protein Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCDR generation involves the generation of the variable regions of the antibody, directly determining binding affinity and making it the core of antibody generation. As mentioned above, the CDR-H3 region is the most variable, making it the most difficult region for models to generate and thus the primary region of focus. The primary datasets used in recent models are listed below. Note that SAbDab is the main dataset typically used for training, whereas RAbD and SKEMPI are specialized datasets used for testing specific downstream tasks. SAbDab  - The Structural Antibody Database, an annotated dataset of all antibody structures contained in PDB , used in structure prediction (see page 8.1.3) RAB  - Rosetta Antibody Benchmark, a hand-selected group of 60 diverse antibody-antigen complexes, also used in antibody structure prediction (see page 8.1.3). SKEMPI  - Structural Database of Kinetics and Energetics of Mutant Protein Interactions, a dataset of energy changes for mutations of protein-protein interactions. Three general tasks are used to benchmark models in this field: Sequence and Structure Modeling - Given an antibody structure, predict its corresponding sequence (or vice-versa). AAR is used to evaluate generated sequences, while RMSD is used to evaluate generated structures. Testing for this task is done on the SAbDab dataset. CDR-H3 Generation - Given a target antigen, generate the binding antibody CDR-H3 region. AAR is used to evaluate sequences, while RMSD and TM-Score are used to evaluate structures. Testing is done on the RAbD dataset. Affinity Optimization - Given an antibody-antigen pair, make changes to the CDR region to optimize its binding affinity with the target antigen. Performance is measured by Œî‚ÄãŒî‚ÄãGŒîŒîùê∫\\Delta\\Delta G, and testing is done on SKEMPI v2.0. The following metrics are used to evaluate CDR generation models: AAR - Amino acid recovery, a comparison between ground truth and generated amino acid sequences, also measured in antibody representation learning (see 8.1.2). RMSD - Root-mean-square deviation, measures distances between ground truth and generated residue coordinates. Also used in protein structure prediction (see page 4.2.3) TM-score  - Template Modeling Score, a distance measurement capturing both local and global similarities, also used in protein structure prediction (see page 4.2.3). ùö´‚Äãùö´‚ÄãùêÜùö´ùö´ùêÜ\\mathbf{\\Delta\\Delta G} - Change in binding energy after affinity optimization. Binding energy is predicted by the geometric network proposed by Shan et al. . While some approaches to the CDR generation problem have been sequence-based, such as the LSTM used by Akbar et al. [ref]157, the field has seen movement towards structure-based design and even more recently, sequence-structure co-design, as this allows models to incorporate both 1D amino acid sequence information and 3D structure information in the generation process. RefineGNN [ref]158 was the first to introduce structure/sequence co-design, representing both structural and sequential information in a graph and performing iterative refinement. A Multi-channel Equivariant Attention Network (MEAN) [ref]172 improves efficiency by predicting all amino acids within a CDR region at once, allowing for fewer iterations than RefineGNN‚Äôs prediction for each amino acid residue. AntiDesigner  implements a Protein Complex Invariant Embedding (PCIE) and dual Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) to design structures and sequences in a one-shot manner, removing the need for iterative refinement entirely. DiffAb  defines diffusion processes for both amino acid sequences and 3D backbone coordinates, serving as one of the first DDPMs in the field of antibody generation. While the above models all show significant progress in the specific CDR generation task, these models still require the input of fully docked antibody-antigen structures; thus, in real-world applications where only sequence and/or structure data is available, these models must be paired with structure prediction and docking methods to operate. As a result, some methods simultaneously implement other parts of the antibody generation process in their model. The deep learning method DockGPT  includes an adaptation of their protein-protein docking method for antibody CDR-H3 docking and design. By adding an encoding feature to distinguish CDR residues during training and providing structures with missing CDR regions as input, DockGPT simultaneously docks and designs all CDR regions. HERN  uses hierarchical equivariant refinement to both generate and dock paratopes for target antigens. However, HERN requires a defined epitope region as input and needs to be combined with epitope prediction models to dock with antigens whose epitopes are not identified. Dynamic Multichannel Equivariant Graph Network (dyMEAN)  extends these ideas even further by creating the first end-to-end method, incorporating structure prediction, docking, and CDR generation in a singular model. To demonstrate its improved performance, dyMEAN benchmarks against pipelines combining models for each subtask (Igfold ‚áí‚áí\\Rightarrow HDock ‚áí‚áí\\Rightarrow MEAN to perform structure prediction, docking, and CDR generation, for example).\n\nReference markers found: [157]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]157: Binding energy is predicted by the geometric network proposed by Shan et al. .
