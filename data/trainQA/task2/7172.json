      "content": "Paper Title: Integrating Edges into U-Net Models with Explainable Activation Maps for Brain Tumor Segmentation using MR Images\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe brain tumor segmentation challenge  (BraTS) from 2012 sparked waves of interest in segmenting tumors from brain MRI. The yearly challenge helped gather multi-institutional data, data standardization, and bench-marking . The early approaches focused on\nimage processing techniques like thresholding, probabilistic methods, and clustering. In , Njeh et al. proposed a graph cut distribution matching method to automatically segment edema regions. Abdel et al.  proposed a hybrid clustering method using k-means integrated with fuzzy c-means to find the initial brain tumor area. They followed it up with thresholding and level-set segmentation stages to obtain the segmented brain tumors. Both authors validated their methodology on the BraTS2012 dataset. Dvorak et al.  utilized multi-resolution symmetric analysis and Otsuâ€™s thresholding on axial and coronal planes. The left symmetry information in both planes has been used as prior knowledge to detect tumors from T2-weighted images and the threshold has been used to segment the same. These methods generally tend to be computationally fast but they cannot generalize to a large variety of MR images for brain tumor segmentation. In recent years, machine learning and deep learning techniques have performed well and given state-of-the-art results. Pinto et al.  have proposed a hierarchical brain tumor segmentation workflow that utilizes extremely randomized trees for segmentation. These trees are provided with appearance and context-based features for accurate segmentation. The features are obtained through several non-linear transformations. Havaei et al.  proposed several cascade-style deep convolutional neural networks for the segmentation of brain tumors. The authors claim that their methodology learns both local as well as global contextual features. The authors showed their results on the BraTS2013 dataset. The author [ref]23 proposes an enhanced version of dense convolutional neural networks for the task of brain tumor segmentation. Additionally, they have utilized the super-resolution concept for image reconstruction to obtain quality segmentation results. Kamnitsas et al.  proposed a 3D convolutional neural network for brain tumor segmentation. They also obtain both local and global contextual information, they proposed a dual pathway architecture with multi-scale filters. They removed false positives by applying a conditional random field over the obtained results. Their methodology obtained top performance on the BraTS2015 and ISLES2015 datasets. The drastic improvements in semantic segmentation started with the introduction of the U-Net model [ref]10. Feng et al. [ref]25 proposed an ensemble of 3D U-Nets with various hyperparameter settings. They build an ensemble model with different hyperparameters to reduce random errors at different hyperparameter settings. Kamnitsas et al  proposed an ensemble model named Ensembles of Multiple Models and Architectures (EMMA) for brain tumor segmentation. The model used other top-performing segmentation models like DeepMedic , FCN  and U-Net [ref]10 to produce a target segmented image. Myroenko  proposed a U-Net with an additional variational autoencoder branch. The variational autoencoder part aims at the reconstruction of the input image from the bottleneck region of the U-Net thereby building robust features useful for obtaining proper segmentation at the U-Net segmentation layer. Isensee et al.  demonstrated that a U-Net is difficult to beat with proper hyperparameter tuning, additional input data, dice loss, and other minor changes. Most works in the literature so far have focused on changes to the model architecture or hyperparameter tuning. Also, when it comes to brain tumors, the edge prediction of the tumor is as important as the tumor regions themselves. Edges of the tumor regions are difficult to delineate as the transition from healthy tissue to brain tissue regions is usually smooth in nature . In recent years, there have been efforts to bridge the gap by designing models that are aware of the edges , and models in which the edge information is infused during the learning process  . The proposed models however are not applicable to other models without major changes to the base model. The simplest way to learn edges would be to directly learn the edges along with the tumor segments as targets when training a model. The approach can be applied to any deep learning model with minimal change to the architecture. To the authorsâ€™ knowledge, such an endeavor has not been carried out in the literature and the authors feel that such an exercise is worth exploring.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: segmentation of brain tumors.
