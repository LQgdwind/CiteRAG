      "content": "Paper Title: Toward Multiple Specialty Learners for Explaining GNNs via Online Knowledge Distillation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compared SCALE with five baseline methods on quantitative and qualitative results to prove the explanation correctness and execution performance. Specifically, baselines are categorized into intrinsically interpretable models and perturbation methods. Intrinsically Interpretable Models use internal model weights to explain predictions directly. We selected four models to compare with SCALE as follows: GCN-MLP: GCN [ref]25 is not an intrinsically interpretable model. Therefore, we replaced the normalized adjacency matrix with a trainable matrix similar to Equations 5 and 8 for graph and node classification, respectively. Learnable adjacency matrices were then used to provide structural explanations. GAT  can be considered a self-explainable GNN since attention heads capture interactions between nodes. We used three attention heads for each layer and averaged out all heads across layers to provide explanations. SEGNN  is a self-explainable GNN based on a similarity module that computes structure distances between an unlabelled node and K-nearest labeled neighbors. We set K such that the out-of-memory problems do not occur and the recall scores are maximized. EGNN  is a self-explainable model based on an offline KD paradigm [ref]26, which filters out unimportant messages from 2-hop neighbors via two separate masking layers. To construct explanations, we aggregated neighbor scores and selected top K nodes that maximize recall scores. Perturbation Methods integrate additional post-hoc training processes specialized for explanation purposes, which follow model-agnostic approaches. We selected two state-of-the-art methods similar to SCALE in problem formulation and explanation model initialization. GNNExplainer [ref]7 was the first work that trained edge masks to determine crucial subgraphs based on an information theory approach. However, it has to retrain a mask for each target instance, thus making it less effective for inductive settings and large-scale graphs. PGExplainer  shared the same approach with GNNExplainer [ref]7 but initialized masks using embedding vectors from the pre-trained model. Moreover, target instances share trainable weights. Executing Algorithm 2 on GCN-MLP and GAT: The explanation querying algorithm can operate on various types of pre-trained GNNs as long as these models include normalized adjacency matrices representing interactions between nodes. We named the results of these integration processes SCALE-GCN-MLP and SCALE-GAT, respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: models and perturbation methods.
