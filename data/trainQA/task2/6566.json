      "content": "Paper Title: DyEdgeGAT: Dynamic Edge via Graph Attention for Early Fault Detection in IIoT Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGiven the rarity of faults, this section focuses on reviewing unsupervised Fault Detection (FD) techniques. Additionally, Anomaly Detection (AD) methods are also reviewed, due to their methodological similarity to unsupervised FD. Unsupervised fault detection. Traditional unsupervised FD has focused on identifying patterns in data that deviate from its normal condition and shifts in data interdependencies. Classical machine learning methods, such as one-class Support Vector Machines (SVMs), have been commonly applied in FD, effectively identifying outliers by enclosing all positive instances within a hyper-sphere . Autoencoders (AEs) are popular in unsupervised FD, facilitating fault detection through monitoring the deviation in the reconstruction errors [ref]18. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have also been utilized for FD, with the generator creating positive samples and the discriminator differentiating between normal and abnormal instances [ref]20. Anomaly detection. In the IIoT context, AD methods focus on modeling system dynamics and identifying deviations from these as anomalies. Approaches such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) , Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) [ref]11 are commonly employed, using prediction or reconstruction errors as anomaly indicators. These anomalies typically manifest as point anomalies, often due to sensor faults, or context anomalies, which often arise from operational misconfigurations or changes in environmental conditions . Additionally, self-supervised methods like Masked Anomaly Detection (MAD) have been developed, enabled by input sequence masking and estimation . Novel operating conditions. A common challenge in FD and AD is their inability to distinguish between novel operating conditions and faults, which arises from a limited representation of all normal operating conditions in the training data. To address this, Guo et al. proposed to combine clustering with expert input to better account for unknown operating modes. Differently, Michau et al.  proposed to utilize unsupervised feature alignment to extract features under varying conditions and integrate them for fault detection. Expanding upon this approach, Rombach et al.  enhanced the feature representation learning with contrastive learning using triplet loss to achieve invariance to novel operating conditions. Although state-of-the-art FD and AD methods have demonstrated a good performance in modeling interdependencies and dynamics within the data, they fall short in modeling the evolution of relationships in the system. This deficiency affects their ability to detect faults characterized by relationship shifts, especially incipient faults.\nIn addition, to account for novel conditions, current approaches either require labeled operating conditions in the training phase or require explicit modeling to extract operating condition invariant features. Addressing dynamic modeling that can implicitly model operating conditions remains a challenge.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: enclosing all positive instances within a hyper-sphere .
