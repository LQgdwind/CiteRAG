      "content": "Paper Title: Reachability-Aware Laplacian Representation in Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this subsection, we provide theoretical groundings for RA-LapRep from two aspects, which explains why it better captures the inter-state reachability than LapRep. First, we find that the Euclidean distance under RA-LapRep is related to a quantity that measures the expected random walk steps between states.\nSpecifically, let distϕ​(s,s′)≔∥ϕd​(s)−ϕd​(s′)∥≔subscriptdistbold-italic-ϕ𝑠superscript𝑠′delimited-∥∥subscriptbold-italic-ϕ𝑑𝑠subscriptbold-italic-ϕ𝑑superscript𝑠′\\mathrm{dist}_{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}(s,s^{\\prime})\\coloneqq\\lVert\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{d}(s)-\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{d}(s^{\\prime})\\rVert denote the Euclidean distance between states s𝑠s and s′superscript𝑠′s^{\\prime} under RA-LapRep.\nWhen d=|𝒮|𝑑𝒮d=\\lvert\\mathcal{S}\\rvert, distϕ​(s,s′)subscriptdistbold-italic-ϕ𝑠superscript𝑠′\\mathrm{dist}_{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}(s,s^{\\prime}) has a nice interpretation : it is proportional to the square root of the average commute time between states s𝑠s and s′superscript𝑠′s^{\\prime}, i.e., Here the average commute time n​(s,s′)𝑛𝑠superscript𝑠′n(s,s^{\\prime}) measures the expected number of steps required in a random walk to navigate from s𝑠s to s′superscript𝑠′s^{\\prime} and back (see Appendix for the formal definition).\nThus, distϕ​(s,s′)subscriptdistbold-italic-ϕ𝑠superscript𝑠′\\mathrm{dist}_{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}(s,s^{\\prime}) provides a good quantification of the concept of reachability.\nAdditionally, with the proportionality in Eqn. (4), RA-LapRep can be used to discover bottleneck states (see Section 4.3 for a detailed discussion and experiments).\nIn contrast, to the best of our knowledge, the Euclidean distance under LapRep (i.e.,dist𝝆​(s,s′)subscriptdist𝝆𝑠superscript𝑠′\\mathrm{dist}_{\\boldsymbol{\\rho}}(s,s^{\\prime})) does not have a similar interpretation that matches the concept of reachability. Second, we show that RA-LapRep preserves global information while LapRep only focuses on preserving local information.\nSpecifically, we note that RA-LapRep is equivalent (up to a constant factor) to the embedding obtained by classic Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS)  with the squared distance matrix in MDS being Di​j(2)=n​(i,j)subscriptsuperscript𝐷2𝑖𝑗𝑛𝑖𝑗D^{(2)}_{ij}=n(i,j)  (see Appendix for a detailed derivation).\nSince classic MDS is known to preserve pairwise distances globally [ref]29, the Euclidean distance under RA-LapRep is then a good fit for measuring the inter-state reachability.\nIn comparison, the LapRep is only able to preserve local information.\nThis is because, when viewing the MDP transition dynamic as a graph, the LapRep is essentially the Laplacian eigenmap .\nAs discussed in , Laplacian eigenmap only aims to preserve local graph structure for each single neighborhood in the graph (i.e., mapping neighboring states close), while making no attempt in preserving global information about the whole graph (e.g., pairwise geodesic distances between nodes [ref]29).\nTherefore, the Euclidean distance under LapRep is inherently not intended for measuring the reachability between states, particularly for distant states.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: matrix in MDS being Di​j(2)=n​(i,j)subscriptsuperscript𝐷2𝑖𝑗𝑛𝑖𝑗D^{(2)}_{ij}=n(i,j)  (see Appendix for a detailed derivation).\nSince classic MDS is known to preserve pairwise distances globally [ref]29, the Euclidean distance under RA-LapRep is then a good fit for measuring the inter-state reachability.\nIn comparison, the LapRep is only able to preserve local information.\nThis is because,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
