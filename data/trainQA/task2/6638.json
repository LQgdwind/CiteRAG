      "content": "Paper Title: Anticipating Technical Expertise and Capability Evolution in Research Communities using Dynamic Graph Transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMost of existing dynamic graph models use graph neural networks (GNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) to predict links in dynamic graphs [ref]5  .\nRNNs and GNNs are used jointly to learn the temporal graph sequence and graph structural information, respectively.\nFor example, GCRN  and EvolveGCN [ref]5 use RNN and graph convolution neural network (GCN)  to learn from discrete-time graph snapshots.\nJODIE  extended the RNN models to learn dynamic embeddings from a sequence of temporal interactions.\nHowever, most of these methods are limited to homogeneous (single-relational) dynamic graphs and do not handle multiple types of nodes and edges or other node features prevalent in the dynamic heterogeneous graphs.\nMore recently, some studies focused on predicting the future links in dynamic heterogeneous graphs [ref]10 .\nJin et al. proposed the Recurrent Event Network (RE-Net) to predict future links in a discrete-time dynamic graphs  [ref]10.\nRossi et al. proposed the Temporal Graph Network (TGN) to predict future edges in a continuous-time dynamic graph  .\nIn contrast to RE-Net, TGN accepts a sequence of timed edges as input to learn time-aware node embeddings.\nBoth RE-Net and TGN models use RNN to handle node and edge updates.\nHowever, RNNs does not perform well when the number of timesteps increases in the temporal link prediction tasks .\nWe benchmark novel DGT models against the RE-Net and TGN approaches. Transformers achieved a great success in a broad class of machine-learning (ML) problems across multiple data modalities such as language  and vision , and recently on graphs .\nFor example, Graphormer [ref]16 and GraphTransformer  use Transformer architecture  to implement message aggregation and positional encoding in graphs.\nHowever, Graphormer is evaluated on small molecule graphs and GraphTransformer only extracts features from one-hop neighborbood.\nGraphBERT  and TokenGT  transform a graph into the node and edge sequences and feed into Transformers.\nTokenGT has shown to be more expressive than all message-passing GNNs and outperforms GraphTransformer in a standard large-scale graph regression benchmark.\nHowever, when graph topology is important to the downtream prediction task, both GraphBERT and TokenGT can perform poorly since they do not take advantage of it.\nWhile Transformer-based methods applied on graphs show clear performance advantage over other GNN methods, most of these methods are limited to static graphs [ref]16  Several works combined a self-attention mechanism of the Transformer architecture with GNN and demonstrated performance advantage over message passing GNNs .\nFor instance, DYSAT  suggests using the self-attention mechanism for the aggregation of temporal and structural information.\nTGAT  first applies self-attention to the temporal augmented node features after encoding the temporal information into the node feature.\nHowever, most of these methods make graph-specific architectural assumptions .\nCong et al.  used a Transformer-based method in their approach to learn from temporal-union graphs extracted from dynamic graph snapshots.\nHowever, this method has not been evaluated on dynamic heterogeneous graphs.\nIn this work, we advance GNN and Transformer architectures to operate on both discrete- and continuous-time dynamic heterogeneous graphs.\nSpecifically, we use a self-attention mechanism to learn dynamic graph- and node-level changes and GNN to learn structural information in both global and local neighborhoods.\nWe do not make any domain specific architectural assumptions.\nDGT models jointly learn from both temporal edge features and heterogeneous graph neighborhoods.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: Most of existing dynamic graph models use graph neural networks (GNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) to predict links in dynamic graphs [ref]5  .\nRNNs and GNNs are used jointly to learn the temporal graph sequence and graph structural information, respectively.\nFor example, GCRN  and EvolveGCN [ref]5 use RNN and graph convolution\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
