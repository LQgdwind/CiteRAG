However, surprisingly, we find that, some relations are so ubiquitous that, it can map to all percepts (often even from an infinite set) with just the encoding of the relation and that of a starting percept.\nFor example, the successor function (i.e. add 1) is represented by 111 and the number 0 is represented by 00.\nWith this, any natural number can be represented by nesting the successor function, e.g., 111011101110 is 3.\nWhile the successor function is universal over the set of natural numbers given 0, the multiplication operation with the set of all prime numbers can also span the natural numbers.\nSuch set of inputs and transformations are called universal for the target output set.\nSome of these symbols (of states and relations) are so powerful that they can potentially represent an infinite set of states with a finite set of symbols and some compositional rules, e.g. any d-base numeral system with d-symbols and a positional notation can represent any integer. From an engineering point of view, having such universal set of states and transformations helps in taming an infinitude of possibility with a finite number of these building blocks, e.g., a keyboard is made of alphabets instead of a key for every word in the dictionary.\nThere are two subtleties to this enhancement.\n(i) Firstly, since we now have a finite number of block types to construct an infinite number of states, the length of the description using these blocks can potentially be infinite.\nIf we put a bound on the number of blocks we can use, by combinatorial arguments, it bounds the number of states we can describe.\nStates that require longer descriptions are not expressible.\n(ii) Secondly, while the original states represented an observable behavior, these new pseudo-states and transformations that we introduced to reduce our symbol set need not necessarily have intuitive standalone meaning.\nFor some, it may, for example, the bit-flip operator can correspond to the action of toggling a switch, however, for others, it may not, for example, the alphabets do not have semantic meaning by themselves. We are now equipped with a symbol set consisting of (i) some set of observed states and pseudo-states and (ii) a rich (universal) set of transforms to describe other observed percepts.\nAs a digress, it is crucial to note that transformations can be represented as states in a higher dimension via channel-state duality , representing dynamics as statics.\nNow, can we choose an optimal encoding scheme subjective to the probabilities of the various symbols being used to describe the physical phenomena (from the set of all macroscopic percepts)?\nThe problem is that we do not know beforehand the ways in which the blocks will be used, i.e. the distribution of the ensemble.\nImagine operating a Lego factory and deciding how many of each block to manufacture for customers’ needs.\nMost often, due to lack of any other information, encoding of the base set is chosen as the standard binary encoding, (i.e., with the assumption that all blocks and initial percepts will be required with uniform probability), e.g. the ASCII code.\nThis is called the opcode encoding of the instruction set architecture in computers.\nIn this scenario (of universal computation), it can be useful to study things from the other end, i.e., what will be the resources required to represent a specific percept.\nResources are typically of two flavors: (i) the computational cost in terms of cycles (time) and memory (space), and (ii) the length of the description of the percept using the language. The computational cost is studied in the field of computational complexity.\nProblems (and thereby, their solutions as a sequence of instructions based on symbols), are classified into different classes  based on the scaling behavior of time and space with the size of the problem.\nSome common ones are polynomial time (P), non-deterministic polynomial time (NP) and bounded-error quantum polynomial time (BQP). The length of description quantifies the Kolmogorov complexity  or algorithmic entropy of the percept.\nIt is defined as KU​(X)=minp⁡{ℓ​(p):U​(p)=x}subscript𝐾𝑈𝑋subscript𝑝:ℓ𝑝𝑈𝑝𝑥K_{U}(X)=\\min_{p}\\{\\ell(p):U(p)=x\\}, where ℓℓ\\ell denotes the length of the (prefix-free) program p𝑝p on the encoding used by the universal Turing machine U𝑈U that outputs x𝑥x.\nThough it depends on the choice of the building blocks and their encodings, the dependence is only of an additive constant term (called the invariance theorem) which is the length of a cross-compiler to another language/automata.\nThus, it is useful to use Kolmogorov complexity to quantify the individual complexity of a string, irrespective of an ensemble.\nHowever, finding the exact value is uncomputable.\nThere are many ways to approach it from the upper side (lower semi-computable), for example, via compression algorithms, minimum description length and the block decomposition method. So far we reviewed three different notions of complexity of states: Statistical complexity: Shannon entropy on an ensemble of states (given its probability distribution) Computational complexity: Space-time scaling behavior of a program to generate the state (given a language) Algorithmic complexity: Length of the program to generate the state (given a language) In this research, we are instead interested in the circuit complexity of a state.\nCircuit complexity is related to algorithmic complexity , which in turn is related to statistical  and computational complexities .\nComputational complexities typically deal with asymptotic scaling behavior and provides lower bounds.\nThough families of circuits have specific complexity class hierarchy (e.g., A​Ci𝐴superscript𝐶𝑖AC^{i}, T​Ci𝑇superscript𝐶𝑖TC^{i}, N​Ci𝑁superscript𝐶𝑖NC^{i}) it is not of much interest for this research.\nWe will focus on circuits with bounded size (in both space and time).\nSimilarly, the expected Kolmogorov complexity has been shown to correspond to the Shannon entropy , though this relation is not of immediate importance to this work.\n\nKolmogorov complexity can be shown being very similar to circuit complexity under certain considerations .\nAnother similar relation is that truth tables of functions with small circuit complexity has small Kolmogorov complexity.\nCounting arguments relating circuit, algorithmic and statistical complexities has been suggested in   in terms of Lagrangian action.\nOur research in another step in this rather niche field of understanding observed states via different perspectives. It is important to note that most research on algorithmic information theory has been in the context of universal automata, e.g. Turing machines, lambda calculus, cellular automata, etc.\nThe size of the description depends on how expressive the symbols are for the transformations.\nWhat we described so far, i.e., transformations as a relation between two states, is typically the case in the language of circuits.\nProgram written in more abstract logical framework allow more powerful primitives, like universal and existential quantifiers in first-order or higher-order logic.\nTypically, an universal computation model demands a recursively enumerable language.\nIn the Chomsky hierarchy, Turing machines are more powerful than linear-bounded automata, which are inturn more powerful than push-down automata and in turn, finite-state machines (FSM).\nSee [ref]32 for a comparison of these for both classical and quantum computing models.\nHowever, for less powerful automata and language models, it is possible to derive corresponding notions  of algorithmic complexity.\nThis is important as programs written in Turing-complete languages eventually gets translated via the layers of the computing stack and gets executed by logic circuits.\nThese logic circuits are however a combination of sequential (allowing memory cells) and combinatorial logic, and can be used to simulate an FSM.\nPurely combinatorial logic (not to be confused with combinatory logic, which is universal) is of even lower power than FSM.\nThe former is loopless and stateless, and thereby is a direct representation of the output state based on the input.\nIt is important to note that, program execution is typically clocked in both classical and quantum processors to prevent race-conditions, even if the circuits are purely composed of combinatorial logic elements.\nThus, resources of time and space can be defined in this setting even without tracking and accessing intermediate states.\nBy borrowing notions from algorithmic information theory (as defined on functional programs), in this work, we study the effect of circuit complexity of Boolean/quantum combinatorial logic on state complexity.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: the Chomsky hierarchy, Turing machines are more powerful than linear-bounded automata, which are inturn more powerful than push-down automata and in turn, finite-state machines (FSM).\nSee [ref]32 for a comparison of these for both classical and quantum computing models.\nHowever, for less powerful automata and language models, it is possible to derive corresponding notions  of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
