      "content": "Paper Title: On visual self-supervision and its effect on model robustness\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConvolutional Neural Networks are notoriously data \\sayhungry and require a large amount of labeled data to achieve adequate performance; though much work has been devoted to exploring and devising methods that do not require labeled data, or require a much smaller number of labels to learn powerful representations - e.g. unsupervised learning [ref]8 [ref]16 and self-supervised learning [ref]9  . Self-supervised learning (SSL) has gained popularity as it proposes techniques to leverage a particular structure of the data to learn very good representations through optimizing the network weight via auxiliary tasks: e.g. in-painting , rotation prediction [ref]9 and image colorization 4. Though neural networks achieve state of the art results in many tasks and domains, much recent work has focused on defending against and understanding adversarial examples, one of the main weaknesses of deep models   1. Adversarial examples are inputs which have been imperceptibly changed and cause a model to provide erroneous output. However, recent work   suggests that leveraging self-supervised learning can lead to improvements in robustness of models. The goal of this paper is to understand how does incorporating self-supervision into model training affect model robustness to adversarial perturbations  and common image corruptions , as there is more to using self-supervision to improve robustness than meets the eye. Figure 1 shows a plot of the performance of an adversarially trained ResNet-18  model on the CIFAR-10 dataset ( with l2subscript𝑙2l_{2} constraint and ϵ=0.1italic-ϵ0.1\\epsilon=0.1) when a self-supervision (SS) loss is also used in network parameter optimization. We can see from this figure, that as we increase the maximum allowable perturbation ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon of the adversarial examples, the model robustness worsens as the importance of SS loss, λ1subscript𝜆1\\lambda_{1}, increases. Training a model that optimizes both SS loss and supervised loss with larger ϵt​r​a​i​nsubscriptitalic-ϵ𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛\\epsilon_{train} further reveals that for several value of ϵt​e​s​t≤ϵt​r​a​i​nsubscriptitalic-ϵ𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡subscriptitalic-ϵ𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛\\epsilon_{test}\\leq\\epsilon_{train}, the accuracy of a model trained with SS loss in tandem with supervision is higher, and thus one can say the model is more robust at that ϵt​e​s​tsubscriptitalic-ϵ𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡\\epsilon_{test}; and, if ϵt​e​s​t≥ϵt​r​a​i​nsubscriptitalic-ϵ𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡subscriptitalic-ϵ𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛\\epsilon_{test}\\geq\\epsilon_{train}, the performance of the model trained with self-supervision drops, and the effect is larger with stronger weight λ1subscript𝜆1\\lambda_{1} of the self-supervised loss. This represents only one of the cases in which self-supervision can be added to adversarial training. Refer to Figure 2 for a diagram that shows ways that self-supervised learning can be incorporated into adversarial training and the choices to consider: (a) self-supervision task, (b) generation of adversarial examples, and (c) network parameter optimization. We find that leveraging the self-supervised task loss in generating adversarial examples (loss ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} at the bottom of Figure 2) is crucial to boosting model robustness, however it penalizes its non-robust accuracy111This is expected, as there is much work exploring the trade-off between robustness and accuracy .. Contributions In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study to understand various ways one can combine self-supervision with adversarial training and observe the effects on l2subscript𝑙2l_{2} and l∞subscript𝑙l_{\\infty} adversarial robustness. Our study is motivated by the following three questions: Is there a best way to combine self-supervised learning with adversarial training? Is there anything special about predicting image rotations? Or would other SS tasks work as well. Does adversarial self-supervised pre-training further boost model robustness if one incorporates self-supervision into adversarial training? Our contributions are the answers to the above questions: Depends on the meaning of best. If one is interested in model accuracy, incorporating self-supervision loss into optimizing network parameters improves the non-robust model accuracy and robustness for small values ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon, however it can hurt model robustness for larger perturbations. Optimizing the model with self-supervision and adversarial examples generated with both supervised and self-supervised losses is optimal for boosting model robustness, is this can be viewed as a form ensemble adversarial training. Our results indicate that there is nothing special about predicting image rotations and its ability to boost model robustness. We see a similar boost in adversarial robustness when swapping image rotations with the task of solving a jigsaw puzzle . Our results indicate the answer is no. Self-supervised adversarial pre-training does boost accuracy if starting adversarial training  from pre-trained weights. However we see no further benefit from SS adversarial pre-training if we incorporate SS into adversarial training.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: work has been devoted to exploring and devising methods that do not require labeled data, or require a much smaller number of labels to learn powerful representations - e.g. unsupervised learning [ref]8 [ref]16 and self-supervised learning [ref]9  .
