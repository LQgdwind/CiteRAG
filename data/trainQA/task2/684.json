      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Forward Reuse Distance\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecurrent neural networks have achieved great success on solving sequential prediction problems, such as speech recognition¬† [ref]10, visual object recognition¬† , and natural language processing¬†[ref]3 . Both Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)¬† and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)¬† are popular models of recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we employ the LSTM model to predict reuse distance as it is good at dealing with long sequences by propagating the internal hidden state additively instead of multiplicatively. An LSTM unit is composed of a hidden state h‚Ñéh, a cell state cùëêc, an input gate iùëñi, a forget gate fùëìf, and an output gate oùëúo, which enable it to obtain and store the information from the input, and propagate it to the next time point. At time tùë°t, the LSTM is input with xtsubscriptùë•ùë°x_{t}, and the LSTM states are computed using the following formula: Compute the input, forget, and output gates Update the cell state Compute the LSTM hidden (output) state Where [xt, ht-1] denotes the concatenation of the current input and previous hidden state, ‚äôdirect-product\\odot denotes element-wise multiplication, and œÉ‚Äã(u)=11+exp‚àíuùúéùë¢11ùë¢\\sigma(u)=\\frac{1}{1+\\exp{-u}} is the sigmoid method. The above process depicts the working mechanisms of a single LSTM cell. A complete LSTM model can be comprised of tens of the cells by cascading them together. The cell numbers are called LSTM width. LSTM is good at memorizing long-term sequences, and with the deployment of multiple layers it can also be used to map from sequence to sequence¬†. Caching problems are much like sequence problems that have been solved.\nTherefore, we employed a LSTM-based RNN that has multiple layers to learn forward reuse distance in this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: Recurrent neural networks have achieved great success on solving sequential prediction problems, such as speech recognition¬† [ref]10, visual object recognition¬† , and natural language processing¬†[ref]3 .

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
