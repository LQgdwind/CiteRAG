      "content": "Paper Title: Diagnostic Benchmark and Iterative Inpainting for Layout-Guided Image Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the advance of image generation systems that can synthesize diverse and realistic images,\nthere is an increasing demand for controllable image generation systems that can precisely follow arbitrary spatial configurations defined by users.\nFor this reason, recent work has focused on the task of layout-to-image generation       [ref]36 , which aims to generate images conditioned on multiple object bounding boxes and their paired object labels.\nRecent region-controlled text-to-image generation models [ref]46 [ref]1  extend predefined object labels with open-ended regional captions, facilitating the models to generate open-set entities with the queried spatial configurations.\nWith the recent advances in large-scale image generation models   [ref]36  ,\nnewer region-controlled models [ref]46 [ref]1  have shown promise\nin generating high-fidelity images following the user-queried spatial configurations. However, most experiments in these previous works are conducted in the in-distribution (ID) setting, where the queried spatial configuration shares a similar layout as the ones in the training samples.\nHence, a natural question arises: how well do these image generation methods perform in real-world scenarios with arbitrary, unseen out-of-distribution (OOD) layouts (e.g., many more or larger/smaller or unusually positioned/shaped regions as compared to the training samples)?\nRecent studies [ref]46 \nuse qualitative and human evaluations to interpret the model’s generation capabilities on arbitrary spatial configurations.\nHowever, those studies focus on the method development and do not provide systematic benchmarks for spatial control in image generation.\nIn this study, we aim to develop a benchmark to understand the status quo of image generation with arbitrary spatial configurations and further develop an iterative inpainting-based model to improve the OOD layout generalization. To this end, we first propose LayoutBench (Sec. 3), a diagnostic benchmark featuring three properties as follows.\n(1) We define four categories for spatial control: number, position, size, and shape.\nLayoutBench systematically designs the out-of-distribution (OOD) testing queries for each skill, allowing easy comparison between different spatial configurations.\n(2) We evaluate images by layout accuracy in average precision (AP) to reflect the controllable generation quality.\nWith the release of a well-performing category-balanced object detector that localizes generated objects, LayoutBench allows fair and easy comparison with prior works.\n(3) We choose to develop the benchmark based on the CLEVR simulator  to disentangle the factor of image generation quality from the interested spatial controllability.\nBy simplifying the benchmark with simulated objects, LayoutBench can better reflect the true spatial control capabilities and avoid blindly favoring large-scale generation models that generate images with better visual qualities but do not understand spatial configurations. Based on LayoutBench, we systematically evaluate two recent representative layout-guided image generation methods:\nLDM [ref]36\nand\nReCo [ref]46, where both models are initialized by the Stable Diffusion checkpoint.\nWe perform quantitative and qualitative analyses and fine-grained split analyses on the four LayoutBench skills to pinpoint the weaknesses of different models.\nAs depicted in Fig. 1,\nwe find that both models fail on OOD layouts of LayoutBench, while they perform reasonably well on\nID layouts. Inspired by the OOD failures of existing models revealed by our LayoutBench benchmark,\nwe next propose IterInpaint, a new baseline for layout-guided image generation (Sec. 4).\nUnlike existing methods that condition all the region configurations at a single generation step,\nIterInpaint decomposes image generation into multiple inpainting steps and iteratively updates each region at a time.\nBy focusing on updating a single region at each time, the model can tackle unseen, complex layouts more robustly than existing methods.\nIn experiments (Sec. 5), IterInpaint shows significantly better layout accuracy on OOD layouts\nand similar or better layout accuracy on ID layouts than prior works.\nWe also provide comprehensive ablation studies on IterInpaint, including training task ratio, crop&paste vs. repaint-based update, and generation order. Our contributions are summarized as follows:\n(1) LayoutBench, a diagnostic benchmark for arbitrary spatial control capabilities of layout-guided image generation models in four criteria: number, position, size, and shape, where existing models often struggle (Sec. 3);\n(2) IterInpaint, a new baseline for layout-guided image generation that generates foreground and background in a step-by-step manner, which shows better generalization on OOD layout than prior works (Sec. 4);\nand\n(3) detailed qualitative/quantitative/sub-split evaluation of spatial control skills of different layout-guided image generation models, and comprehensive ablation studies of IterInpaint design choices (Sec. 5).\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: image generation systems that can precisely follow arbitrary spatial configurations defined by users.\nFor this reason, recent work has focused on the task of layout-to-image generation       [ref]36 , which aims to generate images conditioned on multiple object bounding boxes and their paired object labels.\nRecent region-controlled text-to-image generation models [ref]46 [ref]1  extend\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
