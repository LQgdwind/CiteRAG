Different from conventional remote sensing images, HSI is composed of diverse contiguous spectral bands, providing detailed spectral information in addition to spatial relations. This property is beneficial to attribute each pixel of HSI into a certain category. In the past few decades, various methods have been proposed for HSI classification. The early-staged methods are mainly based on conventional pattern recognition methods. In spite of the achievements obtained by these methods, they suffer from hand-crafted configurations. To avoid intricate feature engineering, deep learning-based methods can obtain high-level representations via gradually aggregating the low-level features, and have attracted increasing attention in recent years. As one of the most representative methods, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have achieved state-of-the-art performance due to their powerful generalization ability. However, the receptive field of CNN is restricted by a regular square area, and thus CNN fail to adaptively capture the geometric variations of different land cover categories in HSI. To deal with this deficiency, recently, a number of Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based HSI classification methods [ref]1     have been proposed and achieved promising performance. For example, in [ref]1, a multiscale dynamic GCN (MDGCN) was presented to obtain the dynamic graph and explore spectral-spatial correlations at multiple scales. Based on MDGCN, to tap into the advantage of contextual information, context-aware dynamic GCN  was proposed to further mine node features for HSI classification. To overcome the drawback of the manually constructed graph, Wan et al. develop a new dual interactive GCN to adaptively learn a discriminative region-induced graph . In , a semi-supervised nonlocal graph convolutional network was developed to exploit labeled and unlabeled data, simultaneously. Moreover, Bai et al.  developed a deep attention GCN to mine HSI features via focusing on the spectral information which has a large impact on classification. However, the representation ability of most existing GCN-based methods is still limited due to insufficient labeled pixels [ref]6. To accommodate this issue, we aim to sufficiently extract the supervision signals carried by hyperspectral data themselves for network training. Specifically, we propose to use contrastive learningÂ [ref]7  to encode the similarities among the spectral signatures of image regions. Contrastive learning is one of the representative self-supervised learning approaches and it has emerged as a powerful technique for graph representation learning recently  . Most graph contrastive learning methods first perform stochastic augmentation on the input graph to obtain two graph views and then maximize the agreement of representations in the two views . Different from traditional contrastive methods that only utilize unlabeled data for model training, our proposed method additionally incorporates class information to improve the discriminative power of the generated representations. To be specific, we devise a semi-supervised contrastive loss to make full use of the pairwise similarities among examples based on their spectral features. In addition to the supervision signals contained in spectral information, we develop a graph generative loss to explore supplementary supervision signals from the spatial relations among image regions. As a consequence, the originally scarce supervision information can be further enriched by exploring the knowledge from both spectral information and spatial relations of HSI, and thereby leading to enhanced data representations. Last but not least, we devise an adaptive graph augmentation technique at both graph topology and node attribute levels, which is able to incorporate spectral-spatial priors to boost the performance of contrastive learning. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed method is the first work combining GCN with contrastive learning for HSI classification, so we term our method as âContrastive Graph Convolutional Networkâ (ConGCN). To our best knowledge, there have been two works   employing contrastive learning for HSI classification. However, they simply use the traditional paradigm of contrastive learning by utilizing unlabeled examples for pre-training and fine-tuning the model with few labeled examples. In order to improve the discriminative power of the generated representations, our proposed method additionally incorporates the available class information by using a semi-supervised contrastive loss function. Furthermore, our proposed method incorporates spatial relations to the contrastive objective. As a result, the proposed ConGCN can produce more effective feature representations than ResNet-50 in  and the transformer model in . The advantage of our ConGCN has also been empirically demonstrated in SectionÂ VII. To summary, the contributions of our work are as follows: To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to adopt a contrastive GCN model for HSI classification, which helps to extract rich supervision information for enhancing representation ability and classification performance of network. We devise an adaptive graph augmentation technique via incorporating spectral-spatial priors, which helps to boost the performance of contrastive learning. By performing localized and hierarchical graph convolution simultaneously, both local and global contextual information of HSI can be leveraged for expressive representation learning. A semi-supervised contrastive loss and a graph generative loss are designed to exploit the supervision signals contained in spectral domain and spatial relations,\nrespectively.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: capture the geometric variations of different land cover categories in HSI.
