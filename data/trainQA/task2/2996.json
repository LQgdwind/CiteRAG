      "content": "Paper Title: Regular Decision Processes for Grid Worlds\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTemporal logic to express non-Markovian aspects has a history   containing, e.g., Linear Temporal Logic  (LTL). It uses the standard Boolean connectives of propositional logic, i.e. ∧\\land, ∨\\lor and ¬\\lnot, with the addition of temporal connectives G𝐺G (always), F𝐹F (eventually), X𝑋X (next) and U𝑈U (until). More recent variations restrict to finite traces: Linear Temporal Logic over Finite Traces, denoted LTLf, and Linear Dynamic Logic over Finite Traces which allows for regular expressivity . Using LDLf, goals can be as expressive as regular expressions while at the same time providing a more attractive specification syntax. Formally, LDLf formulae ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi can be built using an atomic property 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡\\mathit{tt} for the logical 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒\\mathit{true}, a propositional formula φ𝜑\\varphi and a path expression ρ𝜌\\rho, which is a regular expression over propositional formulae ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi. In addition to regular expression constructs, ρ𝜌\\rho uses a test construct φ​?𝜑?\\varphi?, indicating to only continue evaluation when φ𝜑\\varphi evaluates to 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒\\mathit{true}. The LDLf formalism, as presented by , is expressed in Equations 2 and 3. Intuitively, one may interpret LDLf formula ⟨ϱ⟩​φdelimited-⟨⟩italic-ϱ𝜑\\langle\\varrho\\rangle\\varphi as stating that, from the current step in the trace, there exists at least one (cf. ∃\\exists) execution path that satisfies regular expression ϱitalic-ϱ\\varrho such that the last step in the trace satisfies φ𝜑\\varphi. Conversely, [ϱ]​φdelimited-[]italic-ϱ𝜑[\\varrho]\\varphi states that, from the current step in the trace, all (cf. ∀for-all\\forall) execution paths satisfying regular expression ϱitalic-ϱ\\varrho are such that the last step in that execution path satisfies φ𝜑\\varphi. For example, to formalize the property of a robotic waiter to always serve guests after they have placed an order, the formula [𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒∗](𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟→⟨𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒∗;𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑⟩)𝑒𝑛𝑑[\\mathit{true}*](\\mathit{order}\\rightarrow\\langle\\mathit{true}^{*};\\mathit{served}\\rangle)\\mathit{end} can be used. Temporal formulae specified using LDLf can be compiled into Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) . Formally, a DFA for formula φ𝜑\\varphi is denoted Aφ=⟨2P,Q,δ,F,q0⟩subscript𝐴𝜑superscript2𝑃𝑄𝛿𝐹subscript𝑞0A_{\\varphi}=\\langle 2^{P},Q,\\delta,F,q_{0}\\rangle, where 2Psuperscript2𝑃2^{P} is the input alphabet containing all truth assignments to propositions in P𝑃P, Q𝑄Q is the state space, δ𝛿\\delta the transition function, F𝐹F the set of accepting states and q0subscript𝑞0q_{0} the initial state. Core properties that can be expressed in LDLf are safety and liveness . A safety property is used to indicate that something bad should never happen, or something good always holds, and can be expressed as [𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒∗]​⟨c∗⟩​𝑒𝑛𝑑delimited-[]superscript𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒delimited-⟨⟩superscript𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑑[\\mathit{true}^{*}]\\langle c^{*}\\rangle\\mathit{end}, where c𝑐c indicates the good condition and the asterisk (*) indicates c𝑐c holds at every step up until and including the last step of the trace. That is, until the end of the trace, c𝑐c holds. Conversely, a liveness property indicates that some condition should be met before the end of the trace and can be expressed as ⟨𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒∗;c;𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒∗⟩​𝑒𝑛𝑑superscript𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝑐superscript𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝑒𝑛𝑑\\langle\\mathit{true}^{*};c;\\mathit{true}^{*}\\rangle\\mathit{end}, where c𝑐c is the condition to be met. In words, eventually before the end of the trace, c𝑐c holds.

Each formula φisubscript𝜑𝑖\\varphi_{i} is compiled into an equivalent automaton, as in Figures 1a and 1b, and the cross-product between the original NMRDP M𝑀M and these automata is computed, resulting in the extended MDP M′superscript𝑀′M^{\\prime}. Some straightforward choices should still be made about discounting to prevent infinite reward exploitation and whether rewards belonging to a formula φ𝜑\\varphi can be obtained only once or multiple times. We omit formal details of this standard construction (but cf.  [ref]21) and refer here to an example later in this paper: Figure 5 shows a grid world MDP where a red square needs to be avoided, something which is specified using the LDLf formula φ≡[𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒∗]​⟨(¬xi​s​1∧¬yi​s​2)∗⟩​𝑒𝑛𝑑𝜑delimited-[]superscript𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒delimited-⟨⟩superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖𝑠1subscript𝑦𝑖𝑠2𝑒𝑛𝑑\\varphi\\equiv[\\mathit{true}^{*}]\\langle(\\lnot x_{is1}\\land\\lnot y_{is2})^{*}\\rangle\\mathit{end}, and where the extended MDP depicted in Figure 9 is the result of the cross product between the automaton representing φ𝜑\\varphi, the grid world MDP, and the automaton representing an additional formula expressing a reward of +5050+50 when reaching the top right corner. Note that the extended model is again an MDP where typical RL and DP algorithms can be employed.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: prevent infinite reward exploitation and whether rewards belonging to a formula φ𝜑\\varphi can be obtained only once or multiple times.
