      "content": "Paper Title: AGI for Agriculture\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRepresented as labeled directed multigraphs, knowledge graphs (KGs) are a novel paradigm for the representation, retrieval, and integration of data from various data sources across domains [ref]22 . KGs have emerged as a promising solution for various academic and industry challenges . In the following, we discuss several potential aspects where knowledge graphs technologies and AGI can work together and achieve a more intelligent agriculture system. Accurate and Interpretable AGI for Agriculture Tasks. \nAlthough the recent foundation models show promising performances on various language, vision, and robotic tasks , they are also criticized for generating inaccurate and misleading results  . Knowledge graphs have been shown to be particularly useful to guide the predictions of language models  on different tasks and help ground the generated answers on a particular subgraph 9 to ensure the accuracy of generated answers and improve the model interpretations. This capability is particularly useful for\nmany real-world tasks in which accurate and interpretable predictions are critical such as tasks in medical and agriculture domains. With the contextual information provided by knowledge graphs, AGI can be better used for agriculture tasks such as crop monitoring, crop yield forecasting, fertilizing, and so on. Text-Knowledge Fusion for Agriculture Tasks. \nWith the recent development of large language models (LLMs) which are generally treated as the major driving force behind AGI, knowledge graphs are commonly treated as an additional data source that can complement text data\nfor language model pretraining or finetuning to significantly boost their performance on various downstream tasks, especially difficult question answering tasks that require complex reasoning 9    0  . In the agriculture domain, AgriBERT  has shown that augmenting text data (i.e., question answering pairs) with additional knowledge from an agriculture knowledge graph (i.e., FoodOn knowledge graph) can significantly boost model performance on various NLP tasks in the food and agriculture domain. AGI for Agriculture Knowledge Graph Construction. \nThe recent developments of foundation models foster the usage of AGI on knowledge graph construction. Instead of performing knowledge triplet extraction in a supervised manner 8 or by using seed samples 7, Mai et al.  demonstrate that by using simple prompts, GPT-3 can accurately recognize place names from unstructured text and outperforms various state-of-the-art fully supervised toponym recognition models. This shows the potentials of AGI for entity recognition and entity linking which are two critical tasks related to knowledge graphs. Recently, GraphGPT222https://github.com/varunshenoy/GraphGPT has been developed as a GPT-3 based knowledge graph generation tool that can update a given knowledge graph or create a new knowledge graph given natural language inputs. Most widly used knowledge graphs, either general-purposed KGs such as DBpedia , and Wikidata , or domain-specific KGs such as FoodOn , GeoNames333https://www.geonames.org/  LinkedGeoData ,\nGNIS-LD ,\nand KnowWhereGraph444https://knowwheregraph.org/  , are constructed manually, or semi-automatically. AGI-based automatic knowledge graph construction is a promising research direction, especially for domains where there are fewer knowledge engineers available such as the agriculture domain. The automatically constructed agriculture knowledge graph can provide additional contextual information and facilitate various agriculture decision-making processes. Complex Knowledge Reasoning for Agriculture Tasks. \nMany agriculture tasks require complex reasoning . For example, given a UAV image of a cropland of soybean, an agricultural scientist or a farmer expect an AGI can 1) first detect whether there are some abnormal symptoms given the appearance of soybean leaves (e.g., water-soaked spots on leaves); then 2) determine the name of this problem (e.g., bacterial blight); next, 3) determine the causes of this disease (e.g., pseudomonas syringae); and finally, 4) determine how to treat this disease (e.g., spray bactericides). Currently, one popular way to enable a large language model (LLM) to do complex reasoning is the usage of chain-of-thought prompting  where a few chains of thought demonstrations are provided as exemplars in prompting to explicitly force the LLM to conduct complex reasoning.\nThe idea is to allow LLM to decompose a multi-step reasoning problem into intermediate steps that are solved individually, instead of solving an entire multi-hop reasoning problem in a single forward pass. However, such an idea is to reason in an implicit manner which is prone to errors and hard to debug. By explicitly encoding the relationships among crop symptoms, diseases, bacteria, and treatments into an agriculture knowledge graph, we can ask the LLM to follow the path in this graph and conduct explicit multi-hop reasoning just as the way Neural Symbolic Machine adopts . Applications of Knowledge Graphs to Agricultural AGI. Knowledge graphs describe the properties and relationships of real-world entities, providing benefits to a variety of agricultural applications 6, such as enhancing search engines, Q&A systems, recommendation systems and content generation with greater intelligence. Search Engines.\nAgriculture search engines could better connect farmers and professionals to the information they need . Traditional search engines work by crawling and indexing web content, accepting queries, and ranking results according to relevance . Due to the emerging general intelligence, the recent large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4  could be used to generate results for searches, potentially disrupting the search engine industry. The concept of knowledge graphs gained great popularity since its launch by Google’s search engine, associated with the Knowledge Vault framework 4 to build large-scale knowledge graphs. Knowledge graphs can complement LLMs by providing them with structured and reliable information. Q&A Systems. Question Answering (Q&A) aims to provide accurate and concise natural language answers in response to questions posed by users 2  0. The recent chatbot-style language models, if trained with large amounts of agricultural data from various sources (e.g., weather patterns, and pest control), have the potential to answer questions related to various agricultural domains. Nevertheless, LLMs may generate content that lacks factual accuracy or omits important knowledge, where KGs could be applied to mitigate the problem. One strategy is to enhance language representation learning with knowledge entities  . Another way is to directly learn knowledge graph embeddings and then integrate the learned entity and relation embeddings into the QA pipeline  9 . Recommender Systems. Agricultural recommender systems can facilitate the dissemination of authentic information and help farmers make more informed decisions on how to optimize their production, e.g., suggesting which agricultural products to use, such as seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides . The recent conversational AI  could even interact with users to better help them find products/services. By utilizing the side information in KGs, it is possible to capture user preferences more accurately . Typical strategies of combining KGs include learning informative knowledge graph embeddings   and conducting path-based reasoning over KGs  6. Content Generation. The advanced language processing capabilities of LLMs can simplify and speed up repetitive mental tasks of agricultural professionals, such as recording, report generation, and training materials generation555https://agtecher.com/how-openai-and-chatgpt-can-be-used-in-agriculture/#help-agri. The incorporation of KGs could make the content generation process more controllable . Besides knowledge graph embedding  0 and path-based reasoning , it is also possible to apply graph neural networks to encode high-order information towards text generation .\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: Represented as labeled directed multigraphs, knowledge graphs (KGs) are a novel paradigm for the representation, retrieval, and integration of data from various data sources across domains [ref]22 .
