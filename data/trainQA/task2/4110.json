      "content": "Paper Title: Semi-Supervised Hierarchical Graph Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph has been widely used to model real-world entities and the relationship among them. Two graph learning problems have received a lot of attention recently, i.e., node classification and graph classification. Node classification is to predict the class label of nodes in a graph, for which many studies [ref]1 [ref]2  in the literature make use of the connections between nodes to boost the classification performance. For example,  enhances the recommendation precision in LinkedIn by taking advantage of the interaction network, and  improves the performance of document classification by exploiting the citation network. Graph classification, on the other hand, is to predict the class label of graphs, for which various graph kernels     and deep learning approaches    have been designed. In this work, we consider a more challenging but practically useful setting, in which a node itself is a graph instance. This leads to a hierarchical graph in which a set of graph instances are interconnected via edges. This is a very expressive data representation, as it considers the relationship between graph instances, rather than treating them independently. The hierarchical graph model applies to many real-world data, for example, a social network can be modeled as a hierarchical graph, in which a user group is represented by a graph instance and treated as a node in the hierarchical graph, and then a number of user groups are interconnected via interactions or common members. As another example, a document collection can be modeled as a hierarchical graph, in which a document is regarded as a graph-of-words , and then a set of documents are interconnected via the citation relationship. In this paper, we study hierarchical graph classification, which predicts the class label of graph instances in a hierarchical graph. To represent a hierarchical graph, there is a natural and important question:“given multiple levels of inputs and representations of a hierarchical graph, how can we enforce a consistency among different levels of the graph?” In this work, we propose to use mutual information (MI) to enforce this consistency. We are motivated by recent developments of graph MI maximization methods [ref]15, and generalize the MI computation to hierarchical graphs, which is named Hierarchical Graph Mutual Information (HGMI). Our theoretical derivations show that HGMI can be decomposed into a linear combination of node-level MI  and graph-level MI [ref]15. In this regard, we can use non-hierarchical graph MI computational methods to compute HGMI. More specifically, for graph instances, we compute MI between nodes and instance representations via graph-level MI computational methods (e.g., INFOGRAPH [ref]15); for connections between graph instances, we compute MI between instances and hierarchical graph representations via node-level MI computational methods (e.g., GMI ). Another challenge is that the amount of available class labels is usually very small in real-world data, which limits the classification performance. To address this challenge, we take a semi-supervised learning approach to solving the graph classification problem. We design an iterative algorithm framework which takes turns to update two modules: Instance Classifier (IC) and Hierarchical Classifier (HC). We start with the limited labeled training set and build IC, which produces the embedding vectors of graph instances. HC takes the embedding vectors as input and produces predictions. We cautiously select a subset of predicted labels with high confidence to enlarge the training set. The enlarged training set is then fed into IC in the next iteration to update its parameters in the hope of generating more accurate embedding vectors. HC further takes the new embedding vectors for model update and class prediction. This is our proposed solution, called SEmi-supervised grAph cLassification via Cautious Iteration (SEAL-CI), to the graph classification problem. Our contributions are summarized as follows. We study semi-supervised hierarchical graph classification, which is scarcely studied in the literature. Our proposed solution SEAL-CI achieves superior classification performance to the state-of-the-other graph kernel and deep learning methods, even when given very few labeled training instances. We generalize the MI estimation to the hierarchical graph domain and propose a new concept named Hierarchical Graph Mutual Information (HGMI). We show HGMI can be decomposed by a sum of mutual information in non-hierarchical graph domain. Upon this, HGMI maximization can be achieved with the help of node/graph-level MI maximization. We present the HIERARCHICAL GRAPH BENCHMARK 111data and code are available at https://hiergraph.github.io/ with both text data and social network data, with the goal\nof facilitating reproducible hierarchical graph research. From the social networking platform Tencent QQ, we collect 37,836 QQ groups with 18,422,331 unique anonymized users, in which the hierarchical graph is constructed with common memberships (hierarchy-level) and friendships (instance-level). From the arXiv papers, we collect 4,666 papers, in which the hierarchical graph is constructed with citations (hierarchy-level) and semantics (instance-level) The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the related works and Section 3 gives the problem definition. Section 4 describes the design of SEAL-CI. We report the experimental results in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: problems have received a lot of attention recently, i.e., node classification and graph classification.
