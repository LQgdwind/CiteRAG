      "content": "Paper Title: The Road to Know-Where: An Object-and-Room Informed Sequential BERT for Indoor Vision-Language Navigation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) offers the appealing prospect of more flexible interactions with robotic applications including domestic robots and personal assistants.\nOne of the first VLN tasks to appear was Room-to-Room navigation (R2R) . This task saw an agent initialised at a random location within a simulated environment rendered from real images, and required it to navigate to a remote goal location according to natural-language instructions, such as “Leave the bedroom, and enter the kitchen. Walk forward, and take a left at the couch. Stop in front of the window.”\nThe actions available to the agent at each step are to investigate the current panorama, to move to a neighbouring navigable location/viewpoint, or to stop.\nAn interactive version of the problem is introduced in  [ref]33, while REVERIE  extends it to identifying remote objects, and TOUCHDOWN [ref]8 introduces outdoor environments. Numerous methods have been proposed to address indoor VLN tasks.\nMa et al.  propose to learn textual-visual co-grounding to enhance the understanding of instructions completed in the past and the instruction to be executed next.\nHeuristic search algorithms for exploration and back-tracking are introduced in  [ref]23.\nQi et al.  propose to disentangle object- and action-related instruction chunks for more accurate visual-textual matching.\nAnother line of work exploits data augmentation to improve the generalisation ability in unseen environments.\nIn , a speaker model is proposed to generate instructions for newly sampled trajectories, and in  visual information of seen scenarios is randomly dropped to mimic unseen scenarios.\nMost recently, it has been empirically demonstrated that hard example sampling and auxiliary losses  1 are helpful for navigating unseen environments. Although significant advances have been made, these methods take words in instructions and each discrete view of a panorama as the minimal unit for encoding, which limits the ability to learn the relationships between language elements and fine-grained visual entities.\nThis is because the view feature, generally obtained by ResNet  which is trained for whole-image classification, mainly represents one salient object but it needs to be matched to many different natural-language landmarks mentioned in crowd-sourced navigation instructions.\nFigure 1 shows an example where the coffee table, couch, and fireplace are used as navigation landmarks in different instructions, but they need to match to the same input view feature in most existing VLN methods. Motivated by the success of BERT-like models (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)    in joint textual and visual understanding,\nwe propose an object-and-room informed sequential BERT to encode instructions and visual perceptions at the same fine-grained level, namely words and object regions.\nThis enables the model to better “know where” the objects referred to lie.\nWe also introduce temporal context into our BERT-based model, which allows the model to be aware of completed parts of instructions and seen environments, resulting in more accurate next action prediction. Relative directions (i.e., left, right, front, and back) and room types (e.g., living room, bedroom) are important clues for VLN tasks as they provide strong directional guidance and semantic-visual information for action selection.\nTo take advantage of such information we incorporate a direction loss and two room-type losses into the proposed model. These predict the relative direction of navigable viewpoints, the type of room that need to be reached next, as well as the type of room at the final goal location.\nThe relative direction is predictable from each viewpoint’s orientation description (i.e., heading and elevation angles),\nand the room types are identifiable through the presence of specific objects, such as a couch indicating living room or a microwave indicating kitchen.\nThis provides the model with opportunity to “know where” it is, and where it is going. To demonstrate the generalisation ability of our model, we evaluate on three different indoor VLN tasks: remote object grounding (REVERIE) , visual dialog navigation (NDH) [ref]33 and room-to-room navigation (R2R) .\nOur method achieves state-of-the-art results on all of the listed tasks: 18.97 SPL (9.28 RGSPL) on the REVERIE task, 3.17 GP on the NDH task, and 52%percent\\% SPL on the R2R task.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: to the agent at each step are to investigate the current panorama, to move to a neighbouring navigable location/viewpoint, or to stop.\nAn interactive version of the problem is introduced in  [ref]33, while REVERIE  extends it to identifying remote objects, and TOUCHDOWN [ref]8 introduces outdoor environments. Numerous methods have been proposed to address indoor VLN tasks.\nMa et al.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
