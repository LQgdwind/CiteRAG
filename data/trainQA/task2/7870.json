      "content": "Paper Title: Space-Time Continuous PDE Forecasting using Equivariant Neural Fields\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGeometric Deep Learning aims to improve model generalization and performance by constraining/designing a model’s space of learnable functions based on geometric principles. Prominent examples include Group Equivariant Convolutional Networks and Steerable CNNs  [ref]4, generalizations of CNNs that respect symmetries of the data - such as dilations and continuous rotations   [ref]25. Analogously, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) [ref]24 or Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNS)  are a variant of neural network that respects set-permutations naturally found in graph data. They are typically formulated for graphs 𝒢=(𝒱,ℰ)𝒢𝒱ℰ\\mathcal{G}=(\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{E}), with nodes i∈𝒱𝑖𝒱i\\in\\mathcal{V} and edges ℰℰ\\mathcal{E}. Typically nodes are embedded into a node vector fi0superscriptsubscript𝑓𝑖0f_{i}^{0}, which is subsequently updated over multiple layers of message passing. Message passing consists of (1) computing messages mi,jsubscript𝑚𝑖𝑗m_{i,j} over edges i,j𝑖𝑗i,j from node j𝑗j to i𝑖i with the message function (taking into account edge attributes ai,jsubscript𝑎𝑖𝑗a_{i,j}: mi,j=ϕm​(fil,fjl,ai,j)subscript𝑚𝑖𝑗subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑚superscriptsubscript𝑓𝑖𝑙superscriptsubscript𝑓𝑗𝑙subscript𝑎𝑖𝑗m_{i,j}=\\phi_{m}(f_{i}^{l},f_{j}^{l},a_{i,j}) (2) aggegating incoming messages: mi=∑j∈𝒩​(i)mi,jsubscript𝑚𝑖subscript𝑗𝒩𝑖subscript𝑚𝑖𝑗m_{i}=\\sum_{j\\in\\mathcal{N}(i)}m_{i,j}, (3) computing updated node features fil+1=ϕu​(fil,mi)superscriptsubscript𝑓𝑖𝑙1subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑢superscriptsubscript𝑓𝑖𝑙subscript𝑚𝑖f_{i}^{l+1}=\\phi_{u}(f_{i}^{l},m_{i}). Recently, such methods have also been adapted for sparse physical data, e.g. for molecular property prediction   - where the GNN is additionally required to respect transformation symmetries.  unifies these approaches to equivariance under the guise of weight sharing over equivalence classes defined by bi-invariant attributes of pairs of nodes i,j𝑖𝑗i,j, a viewpoint we leverage in constructing the equivariant conditioning latent ztνsuperscriptsubscript𝑧𝑡𝜈z_{t}^{\\nu} corresponding to a PDE state νtsubscript𝜈𝑡\\nu_{t}. In the context of dynamics modelling, equivariant architectures have been employed to incorporate various properties of physical systems in the modelling process, examples of such properties are the symplectic structure , discrete symmetries such as reversing symmetries  and energy conservation  .\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: performance by constraining/designing a model’s space of learnable functions based on geometric principles.
