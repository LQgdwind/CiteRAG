      "content": "Paper Title: SCENES: Subpixel Correspondence Estimation With Epipolar Supervision\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe problem of creating correspondences between points in image pairs has been a longstanding challenge in computer vision. Early efforts involved hand-crafted criteria for keypoint detection, description, and matching in well-established methods such as the Harris corner detector , SIFT [ref]26, SURF [ref]3, and ORB .\nMore recently, deep neural network methods have outperformed classical techniques for both keypoint detection and matching. Approaches like SuperPoint [ref]11, D2Net , R2D2 , and DISK  excel at keypoint detection, while works such as SuperGlue , SeededGNN , ClusterGNN , and the very recent LightGlue achieve impressive feature matching results.\nAn alternative class of approaches eschew the detection step entirely. These detector-free methods, including LoFTR , MatchFormer  and ASpanFormer , have demonstrated remarkable performance by creating matches on a dense grid, eliminating the need for separately selected keypoints, and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy.\nDue to their success, we focus on this detector-free paradigm as well, although our approach is not limited to these models.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: challenge in computer vision.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
