Despite the fact that,\nin general, these relaxations are seemingly more\npowerful, in the realm of fixed-template CSPs they\nturn out to be not more powerful than local consistency. However, it\nwill follow from our results that for fixed-template\nPCSPs they are, indeed, strictly more powerful. Fix a signature σ𝜎\\sigma. Let 𝐈𝐈\\operatorname{{\\bf I}} be an instance with\ndomain I=[n]𝐼delimited-[]𝑛I=[n], and let 𝐒𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf S}} be a constraint language with\ndomain S=[p]𝑆delimited-[]𝑝S=[p], where n𝑛n and p𝑝p are positive integers. For\neach R∈σ𝑅𝜎R\\in\\sigma of arity r𝑟r,\nlet ZR⊆{0,1}r​psubscript𝑍𝑅superscript01𝑟𝑝Z_{R}\\subseteq\\{0,1\\}^{rp} denote the set of characteristic\nvectors v𝐭subscript𝑣𝐭v_{\\operatorname{{\\bf t}}} as 𝐭𝐭\\operatorname{{\\bf t}} ranges over the set of r𝑟r-tuples\nin R𝐒superscript𝑅𝐒R^{\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}}, seen as maps from [r]delimited-[]𝑟[r] to [p]delimited-[]𝑝[p]; formally, where v𝐭,i,j=1subscript𝑣𝐭𝑖𝑗1v_{\\operatorname{{\\bf t}},i,j}=1 if 𝐭⁡(i)=j𝐭𝑖𝑗\\operatorname{{\\bf t}}(i)=j and v𝐭,i,j=0subscript𝑣𝐭𝑖𝑗0v_{\\operatorname{{\\bf t}},i,j}=0\nif 𝐭⁡(i)≠j𝐭𝑖𝑗\\operatorname{{\\bf t}}(i)\\not=j, for all i∈[r]𝑖delimited-[]𝑟i\\in[r] and j∈[p]𝑗delimited-[]𝑝j\\in[p].\nLet PR⊆ℝr​psubscript𝑃𝑅superscriptℝ𝑟𝑝P_{R}\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^{rp} denote the convex hull\nof ZR⊆{0,1}r​psubscript𝑍𝑅superscript01𝑟𝑝Z_{R}\\subseteq\\{0,1\\}^{rp}. The polytope PRsubscript𝑃𝑅P_{R} can be described\nby a linear program of the form AR​x≤bRsubscript𝐴𝑅𝑥subscript𝑏𝑅A_{R}x\\leq b_{R}, where x𝑥x is a\nvector of r​p𝑟𝑝rp many variables, ARsubscript𝐴𝑅A_{R} is an integer matrix with at\nmost 2r​psuperscript2𝑟𝑝2^{rp} many rows, and bRsubscript𝑏𝑅b_{R} is an integer vector of dimension\nat most 2r​psuperscript2𝑟𝑝2^{rp}. Let IP​(𝐈,𝐒)IP𝐈𝐒\\mathrm{IP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf I}},\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}) denote the 0-1 linear\nprogram that has one variable xu↦asubscript𝑥maps-to𝑢𝑎x_{u\\mapsto a} for each u∈I𝑢𝐼u\\in I\nand a∈S𝑎𝑆a\\in S and the following defining equalities and inequalities: where, for 𝐮=(u1,…,ur)𝐮subscript𝑢1…subscript𝑢𝑟\\operatorname{{\\bf u}}=(u_{1},\\ldots,u_{r}), we define The direct LP relaxation of IP​(𝐈,𝐒)IP𝐈𝐒\\mathrm{IP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf I}},\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}), denoted\nby LP​(𝐈,𝐒)LP𝐈𝐒\\mathrm{LP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf I}},\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}), is the linear program that is obtained by\nreplacing the 0-1 constraints (I3) by their\nrelaxation 0≤xu↦a≤10subscript𝑥maps-to𝑢𝑎10\\leq x_{u\\mapsto a}\\leq 1. We note\nthat LP​(𝐈,𝐒)LP𝐈𝐒\\mathrm{LP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf I}},\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}) is equivalent to the LP obtained by taking\nthe so-called basic linear programming relaxation introduced in\nthe optimization variants MAX-CSP of CSP (see,\ne.g.,       ), and turning the\nobjective function into a family of inequalities. This is a weak\nrelaxation. In order to obtain stronger LP relaxations we apply the\nmethod of Sherali and Adams \nto IP​(𝐈,𝐒)IP𝐈𝐒\\mathrm{IP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf I}},\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}). Fix an integer k≥1𝑘1k\\geq 1. Recall that Mk​(I,S)subscript𝑀𝑘𝐼𝑆M_{k}(I,S) is used to denote\nthe set of maps from a subset of I𝐼I of cardinality at most k𝑘k\ninto S𝑆S. Let SAk⁡(𝐈,𝐒)superscriptSA𝑘𝐈𝐒\\operatorname{SA}^{k}(\\operatorname{{\\bf I}},\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}) denote the linear program that has one\nvariable xfsubscript𝑥𝑓x_{f} for each f∈Mk​(I,S)𝑓subscript𝑀𝑘𝐼𝑆f\\in M_{k}(I,S) and the following defining\nequalities and inequalities: where, for f∈Mk−1​(I,S)𝑓subscript𝑀𝑘1𝐼𝑆f\\in M_{k-1}(I,S) and 𝐮=(u1,…,ur)𝐮subscript𝑢1…subscript𝑢𝑟\\operatorname{{\\bf u}}=(u_{1},\\ldots,u_{r}), we define It is obvious that SA1⁡(𝐈,𝐒)superscriptSA1𝐈𝐒\\operatorname{SA}^{1}(\\operatorname{{\\bf I}},\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}) is basically the same linear\nprogram as LP​(𝐈,𝐒)LP𝐈𝐒\\mathrm{LP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf I}},\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}): in case k=1𝑘1k=1, the\nset Mk−1​(I,S)subscript𝑀𝑘1𝐼𝑆M_{k-1}(I,S) contains only the empty map f=∅𝑓f=\\emptyset,\nand x∅=1subscript𝑥1x_{\\emptyset}=1 by (T1) in SA1superscriptSA1\\operatorname{SA}^{1}. Furthermore,\nsince Mk​(I,S)⊆Mk+1​(I,S)subscript𝑀𝑘𝐼𝑆subscript𝑀𝑘1𝐼𝑆M_{k}(I,S)\\subseteq M_{k+1}(I,S), it is clear that\neach SAk+1⁡(𝐈,𝐒)superscriptSA𝑘1𝐈𝐒\\operatorname{SA}^{k+1}(\\operatorname{{\\bf I}},\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}) is at least as strong\nas SAk⁡(𝐈,𝐒)superscriptSA𝑘𝐈𝐒\\operatorname{SA}^{k}(\\operatorname{{\\bf I}},\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}). To understand the relaxation, think of each new\ninequality of SAk+1⁡(𝐈,𝐒)superscriptSA𝑘1𝐈𝐒\\operatorname{SA}^{k+1}(\\operatorname{{\\bf I}},\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}) as obtained from multiplying an\ninequality in SAk⁡(𝐈,𝐒)superscriptSA𝑘𝐈𝐒\\operatorname{SA}^{k}(\\operatorname{{\\bf I}},\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}) by a variable xu↦asubscript𝑥maps-to𝑢𝑎x_{u\\mapsto a},\nsimplifying the results by the\nrules xu↦a2=xu↦asuperscriptsubscript𝑥maps-to𝑢𝑎2subscript𝑥maps-to𝑢𝑎x_{u\\mapsto a}^{2}=x_{u\\mapsto a}\nand xu↦a​xu↦b=0subscript𝑥maps-to𝑢𝑎subscript𝑥maps-to𝑢𝑏0x_{u\\mapsto a}x_{u\\mapsto b}=0 whenever a≠b𝑎𝑏a\\not=b (these\nrelations are true in all solutions of IP​(𝐈,𝐒)IP𝐈𝐒\\mathrm{IP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf I}},\\operatorname{{\\bf S}})), and\nfinally linearizing all the quadratic terms by introducing new\nvariables for the products. It is worth noting that, according to the Sherali-Adams method as\ndefined in , it would seem that our definition\nof SAk+1⁡(𝐈,𝐒)superscriptSA𝑘1𝐈𝐒\\operatorname{SA}^{k+1}(\\operatorname{{\\bf I}},\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}) is missing the inequalities that can be\nobtained from those in SAk⁡(𝐈,𝐒)superscriptSA𝑘𝐈𝐒\\operatorname{SA}^{k}(\\operatorname{{\\bf I}},\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}) from multiplication\nby 1−xu↦a1subscript𝑥maps-to𝑢𝑎1-x_{u\\mapsto a}. However, we note that these multiplications\nare redundant: the equalities of type (T1) and (T2) imply\nthat 1−xu↦a=∑b∈[p]∖{a}xu↦b1subscript𝑥maps-to𝑢𝑎subscript𝑏delimited-[]𝑝𝑎subscript𝑥maps-to𝑢𝑏1-x_{u\\mapsto a}=\\sum_{b\\in[p]\\setminus\\{a\\}}x_{u\\mapsto b}, which means that a multiplication\nby 1−xu↦a1subscript𝑥maps-to𝑢𝑎1-x_{u\\mapsto a} can be obtained as a positive linear\ncombination of multiplications by xu↦bsubscript𝑥maps-to𝑢𝑏x_{u\\mapsto b} for b≠a𝑏𝑎b\\not=a. We write 𝐈≤SAk𝐒subscriptsuperscriptSA𝑘𝐈𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf I}}\\leq_{\\operatorname{SA}^{k}}\\operatorname{{\\bf S}} if the linear program SAk⁡(𝐈,𝐒)superscriptSA𝑘𝐈𝐒\\operatorname{SA}^{k}(\\operatorname{{\\bf I}},\\operatorname{{\\bf S}})\nis feasible. It follows directly from the definitions that\nif 𝐈→𝐒→𝐈𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf I}}\\to\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}, then 𝐈≤SAk𝐒subscriptsuperscriptSA𝑘𝐈𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf I}}\\leq_{\\operatorname{SA}^{k}}\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}. Indeed, if hℎh is a\nhomomorphism from 𝐈𝐈\\operatorname{{\\bf I}} to 𝐒𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}, then the assignment that\nsets xf=1subscript𝑥𝑓1x_{f}=1 if f⊆h𝑓ℎf\\subseteq h, and xf=0subscript𝑥𝑓0x_{f}=0\nif f⊈hnot-subset-of-or-equals𝑓ℎf\\not\\subseteq h, is a feasible solution to the linear\nprogram. Furthermore, it also follows directly from the definitions\nthat if 𝐈≤SAk𝐒subscriptsuperscriptSA𝑘𝐈𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf I}}\\leq_{\\operatorname{SA}^{k}}\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}, then 𝐈≤k𝐒subscript𝑘𝐈𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf I}}\\leq_{k}\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}; indeed,\nif (xf∣f∈Mk​(I,S))conditionalsubscript𝑥𝑓𝑓subscript𝑀𝑘𝐼𝑆(x_{f}\\mid f\\in M_{k}(I,S)) is a feasible solution\nfor SAk⁡(𝐈,𝐒)superscriptSA𝑘𝐈𝐒\\operatorname{SA}^{k}(\\operatorname{{\\bf I}},\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}), then the\ncollection ℋ={f∈Mk​(I,S)∣xf≠0}ℋconditional-set𝑓subscript𝑀𝑘𝐼𝑆subscript𝑥𝑓0\\mathscr{H}=\\{f\\in M_{k}(I,S)\\mid x_{f}\\not=0\\} is\na k𝑘k-strategy for 𝐈𝐈\\operatorname{{\\bf I}} and 𝐒𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}; the non-emptiness condition\nfollows from (T1), the closure under restrictions and the extension\nproperty up to k𝑘k follow from (T2), and the condition that every map\nin ℋℋ\\mathscr{H} is a partial homomorphism follows from (T3) and the\nchoice of the polytope PRsubscript𝑃𝑅P_{R}. Since the feasibility problem for linear programs is solvable in\npolynomial time, there is an algorithm that, given (𝐈,𝐒,k)𝐈𝐒𝑘(\\operatorname{{\\bf I}},\\operatorname{{\\bf S}},k) as\ninput, decides whether 𝐈≤SAk𝐒subscriptsuperscriptSA𝑘𝐈𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf I}}\\leq_{\\operatorname{SA}^{k}}\\operatorname{{\\bf S}} and does so in time\npolynomial in (|I|+|S|)ksuperscript𝐼𝑆𝑘(|I|+|S|)^{k}. This algorithm is the width-k𝑘k\nSherali-Adams heuristic for CSPs which, as was the case for the\nwidth-k𝑘k consistency algorithm, can also be used as a heuristic for\nPCSPs. If (𝐒,𝐓)𝐒𝐓(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}) is a PCSP template and k​(n)𝑘𝑛k(n) is an integer\nfunction, then we say that PCSP⁡(𝐒,𝐓)PCSP𝐒𝐓\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}) is solvable in\nSA-width k​(n)𝑘𝑛k(n), or that the template (𝐒,𝐓)𝐒𝐓(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}) has\nSA-width k​(n)𝑘𝑛k(n), if for every σ𝜎\\sigma-structure instance 𝐈𝐈\\operatorname{{\\bf I}}\nwith n𝑛n elements it holds that 𝐈≤SAk​(n)𝐒subscriptsuperscriptSA𝑘𝑛𝐈𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf I}}\\leq_{\\operatorname{SA}^{k(n)}}\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}\nimplies 𝐈→𝐓→𝐈𝐓\\operatorname{{\\bf I}}\\to\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}. It follows from the fact that it is always the\ncase that 𝐈≤n𝐒subscript𝑛𝐈𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf I}}\\leq_{n}\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}, where n𝑛n is the number of elements\nof 𝐈𝐈\\operatorname{{\\bf I}}, that every PCSP⁡(𝐒,𝐓)PCSP𝐒𝐓\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}) is solvable in SA-width at\nmost k​(n)𝑘𝑛k(n) for k​(n)=n𝑘𝑛𝑛k(n)=n. Whenever it is solvable in\nSA-width k​(n)𝑘𝑛k(n) for some k​(n)=O​(1)𝑘𝑛𝑂1k(n)=O(1), we say that PCSP⁡(𝐒,𝐓)PCSP𝐒𝐓\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}})\nis solvable in bounded SA-width, or that (𝐒,𝐓)𝐒𝐓(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}) has\nbounded SA-width. The SA relaxations have been intensively used in optimization versions\nof CSP    0. Our setup\nis, again, slightly different because the constraints of the instance\nmust be encoded in the polytope-defining inequalities, rather than in\nthe objective function, as is done in the\noptimization variants. Still, the family of SA relaxations commonly\nused for optimization can be readily adapted to our setting by turning\nthe objective function into a set of inequalities (see\n[ref]20). The LP family obtained in this way, although not\nequivalent to ours, has the same power up to constants. Indeed, the\nnotion of bounded SA-width remains unaltered. The strength of SA-width k𝑘k for k=1𝑘1k=1 is well understood. Indeed, it\nis shown in  (Theorem 7.9) that (𝐒,𝐓)𝐒𝐓(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}) has\nSA-width 111 if and only if Pol⁡(𝐒,𝐓)Pol𝐒𝐓\\operatorname{Pol}(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}) has symmetric functions of\nall arities, where an operation is symmetric if its output is\nindependent of the order of its input elements. The picture is also\nclear if 𝐒=𝐓𝐒𝐓\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}=\\operatorname{{\\bf T}} (i.e., in the case of CSPs). In particular, it\nfollows from combining the results in \nand [ref]2 with those in  that\nif CSP⁡(𝐓)CSP𝐓\\operatorname{CSP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}) is solvable in bounded SA-width, then it is solvable in\nbounded width as well. Furthermore, combining the results\nin  and  it can be concluded\nthat, additionally, CSP⁡(𝐓)CSP𝐓\\operatorname{CSP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}) is solvable in relational\nwidth 2, which, in turn, can be shown to imply that it is solvable\nin SA-width 222.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: the\noptimization variants.
