      "content": "Paper Title: STITCH: Surface reconstrucTion using Implicit neural representations with Topology Constraints and persistent Homology\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSurface Reconstruction: The problem of reconstructing surfaces from point clouds has been investigated for many years. Please see the Supplement for a more thorough description of surface reconstruction methods. The main advantage of implicit methods is that they handle noise in the data much better than pure geometric approaches. Leveraging the generalized function approximation nature of neural networks has recently allowed the replacement of the implicit function with a neural network under the class of Implicit Neural Representations [ref]3 [ref]4  . Specifically, if the implicit function is the distance field, it allows for the use of physics-informed methods that solve the Eikonal equation using a boundary value problem for surface reconstruction  . This approach guides the distance function to have a value of zero on the underlying surface represented by the point cloud. Table 1 provides a concise comparison of some of the current state-of-the-art surface reconstruction approaches. In this paper, we propose a neural implicit surface reconstruction approach that incorporates topological constraints during the training process. Topological Surface Reconstruction: Topological machine learning [ref]27  has recently emerged as a powerful fusion of two fields—topological data analysis and machine learning. Topological data analysis (TDA) provides insights relating to algebraic topology—invariant properties of spaces under continuous transformations. We refer the reader to Hensel et al. [ref]27 for a more in-depth survey of TDA. Persistent Homology (PH) is the primary tool used in TDA for generating multi-scale insights about topological criteria such as connected components, loops, or voids. These features are often referred to as 0-dimensional, 1-dimensional, or 2-dimensional features, respectively. Controlling topology during the surface reconstruction process has gained attention in recent years. Approaches leveraging PH have been used for shape description and classification , mesh segmentation , and more related to our work, surface reconstruction  . Brüel-Gabrielsson et al.  incorporated topological priors to obtain a likelihood function over the reconstruction domain. PH has also been leveraged for 3D reconstruction from 2D images by introducing a loss term that penalizes the topological features of a predicted 3D shape using 3D ground truth-based topological features. Mezghanni et al.  also propose a similar approach in using generative networks for shape generation. Dong et al.  proposed a target function using persistent pairs in the persistent diagram to control the coefficients of a B-spline function. Conventional neural implicit surface reconstruction approaches often suffer from the well-known problem of generating ghost geometries away from the underlying surface. This is primarily due to off-surface points being close enough to each other, causing the neural network to generate a signed distance field value of zero for such points. As a result, this generates more than one single connected component. Although loss terms penalizing such a scenario have been proposed in other works  , they do not explicitly enforce a penalty on multiple components. In this work, we propose leveraging persistent homology for gathering and utilizing topological information relating to the number of connected components. We build our approach on a neural implicit representation framework similar to Neural-Pull , with added topological losses that enforce a single connected component  in the reconstructed mesh. We start with a relatively sparse point cloud and predict a signed distance function without requiring ground truth normal information. Topological information for surface reconstruction from a point cloud can be incorporated by three different approaches. (i) Given a point cloud, compute the alpha complex or rips complex and use the resultant birth and death times to filter out unwanted features. This is followed by a conventional reconstruction approach such as Poisson surface reconstruction. (ii) Given a point cloud, reconstruct a mesh using a conventional method. Compute the topological features by sampling points on the mesh and use the alpha/rips complex to refine the point set and reconstruct a final mesh. (iii) Operate in the implicit space and compute a distance function for a point cloud. Often, this distance function is computed over a grid of points, making it suitable for a cubical complex-based topological feature computation as opposed to alpha/rips complex computed from point clouds. Use the computed features to penalize the SDF and reconstruct a mesh using marching cubes. We build upon the last approach in this work for the following reasons: (i) SDF provides a continuous and smooth approximation of the underlying shape, capturing fine geometric details that discrete point samples might miss; (ii) the use of topological constraints in the implicit space has been under-explored, and (iii) this approach allows us to build an end-to-end differentiable neural implicit surface reconstruction pipeline that incorporates topological features.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: generalized function approximation nature of neural networks has recently allowed the replacement of the implicit function with a neural network under the class of Implicit Neural Representations [ref]3 [ref]4  .
