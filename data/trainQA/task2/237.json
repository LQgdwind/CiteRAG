      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Inverse Rendering of Faces from Real-world Videos\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInverse rendering aims at estimating the components of an image in its formation process.\nAn image is often decomposed to three components, namely, albedo (reflectance properties), normal (shape attributes), and illumination , , , 4.\nInverse rendering has important applications in image analysis (e.g., scene segmentation and material recognition) and editing (e.g., photo relighting).\n In this paper, we consider inverse rendering of human face images because they belong to the most important class of images in vision and recognition tasks. Promising results have been achieved under constrained scenarios (e.g., on the well designed lighting stages[ref]11[ref]13). However, inverse rendering of in-the-wild face images remains an open problem due to complex variations in human face appearances, illumination conditions, and shadows. Moreover,\nthe lack of ground-truth decomposition components makes this task highly ill-posed.\nTo tackle this problem,\nsome hand-crafted priors (e.g., , ) have been introduced for each component to guide the decomposition. Unfortunately, these priors make strong assumptions on face attributes (e.g., strong shape and reflectance priors for Caucasians) that are tailored for specific tasks. Thus they do not generalize well to in-the-wild face images . Owing to the success of deep learning in many tasks, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently been employed to address the problem of inverse rendering. For example,   employed CNNs to deal with this problem by training on synthetic data.\nAfter training on synthetic face image datasets, the network is applied on real face images to obtain different image modeling components.\nHowever, training only on synthetic data does not generalize well to real data since real face images contain much richer facial variations that cannot be captured by synthetic data (e.g., faces wearing glasses and/or makeup, faces with beard, etc).\nIt is thus very desirable to make use of real data for training.\nTo this end,  proposed to train on real face images with pseudo labels.\nHowever, results reported in  are far from satisfactory because the pseudo labels obtained from a network pre-trained on synthetic data cannot model complex variations in real face images. Instead of using static independent real images, images from different viewpoints or video sequences of the same scene have been used to reduce the gap between real and synthetic data for intrinsic decomposition of indoor and/or outdoor scenes (e.g., , 4, 5). Inspired by the above approach, in this work we consider the use of images from real face videos111We do not employ multi-view images because they do not provide additional lighting constraints. to bridge the domain gap because consistency constraints can be derived from different frames of the same person and they provide a stronger error measure in learning than the simple image reconstruction loss.\nOur approach is motivated by the key observation that the albedo and normal maps of two face frames in a same-person video only differ in pose and expression and that consistency of these maps can be derived. Specifically, we transform the components between frames to algin albedo and normal: the transformation of albedo is the displacement of corresponding pixels, while for normal it consists of displacement and change of directions.\nNote that such transformations cannot be achieved by traditional (e.g. optical flow) algorithm due to the texture-less nature of albedo and directional shifts in normal.\nAfter aligning one frame with another, we leverage the consistency constraint between their albedo and normal maps to regularize the decomposition procedure, leading to weakly supervised learning on real face images.\nThis way, the domain gap between real and synthetic face images is drastically reduced. Our experiments corroborates that the alignment (though not perfect) obtained by AlignNeta and AlignNetn can effectively improve the inverse rendering performance on real data. We also note that existing methods do not take into account high frequency details such as shadow and highlights, making the inverse rendering results less realistic.\nInstead of considering the inverse rendering problem as decomposing an image into three components, we treat it as decomposing an image into four components (albedo, normal, illumination, and residual).\nThe advantage of the additional residual map component in our new approach is that it leads to more realistic face images that maintain high frequency details induced by global illumination effects such as shadow and highlights.\nWe propose a learning framework called IlluRes-SfSNet to perform face image decomposition (into albedo, normal, illumination, and residual).\nWe train IlluRes-SfSNet on both real and synthetic data222We create two synthetic datasets (in addition to an existing one) to train our model., benefiting from both, and compute the albedo, normal, illumination components in a similar way to existing works (e.g., the SfSNet ). The residual map is obtained by subtracting the image with global illumination and the one that only contains local illumination.\nWe run extensive experiments to evaluate IlluRes-SfSNet on various benchmarks, obtaining much better results than the state-of-the-art. To summarize, our main contributions are threefold: The conceptual significance of introducing a consistency assumption of albedo and normal of the same person in a video. This consistency assumption led to the idea of weakly supervised training of our neural network model, hence bridging the domain gap between synthetic and real images. Our proposed dual CNN models AlignNeta and AlignNetn as workhorses for learning the alignment between albedo and normal maps of different frames in a same-person face video. After pretraining on synthetic data, they are applied to real data to align the predicted albedo and normal maps, enabling weakly supervised learning on real data. An IlluRes-SfSnet learning framework that seamlessly integrates SfSnet\n and Illumination Residual Net to predict a residual map, in addition to albedo, normal, and illumination, for better inverse rendering results than the state-of-the-art. Our current work opens doors to development of exciting applications such as relighting and albedo editing, for which we show some results in the end of the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: because they belong to the most important class of images in vision and recognition tasks.
