      "content": "Paper Title: Benchmarking a wide range of optimisers for solving the Fermi-Hubbard model using the variational quantum eigensolver\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere exist several review articles on VQE and variational methods [ref]1  0 1 2. [ref]1 and  contain discussions on several optimisation strategies, including gradient calculation, L-BFGS, quantum natural gradient, imaginary time evolution, Hessian based methods, quantum analytic descent, stochastic gradient descent, evolutionary algorithms, reinforcement learning, sequential minimisation, surrogate model based, BOBYQA, Rosalin, Adam and SPSA. We also particularly highlight 0 as it contains detailed discussion and pseudocode, and their Table 11 is a helpful summary of hyperparameters and complexity for several optimisers. Here we provide a non-exhaustive list of references that compared optimisers in the context of VQE. We point the reader to references contained within these works for additional studies in this direction. ‚Äú\\citefieldlavrijsen2020classicaltitle, (\\citefieldlavrijsen2020classicalyear)‚Äù 3\nintroduce a python software suite, Scikit-Quant 4, containing four optimisers: NOMAD, ImFil, Bobyqa and SNOBfit. They also take BFGS and COBYLA from scipy for baseline comparisons. As problem instances, they used axis rotation and bond stretching and breaking of the ethylene molecule, and the Fermi-Hubbard model on 4 sites. They found that BFGS and COBYLA were best for noise-free cost functions, but the other 4 optimisers generally outperform them, with a ranking depending on factors such as if parameter bounds are available and the quality of initial parameters. ‚Äú\\citefieldsung2020usingtitle, (\\citefieldsung2020usingyear)‚Äù  contains a helpful introduction section with extra references. They compare Nelder-Mead, BOBYQA, SPSA, SGD using parameter shifts, model gradient descent (MGD) and model policy gradient (MPG), and they introduced the last two as novel optimisers. They use MaxCut, the Sherrington-Kirpatrick model, and the Fermi-Hubbard model as benchmarks, and found the MGD and MPG were the best performers. In ‚Äú\\citefieldbonet2023performancetitle, (\\citefieldbonet2023performanceyear)‚Äù 5, they study SLSQP, COBYLA, CMA-ES, and SPSA, and have an interesting section on hyperparameter tuning. They focus on the H4subscriptùêª4H_{4} chain and square and the Hubbard model, and find that SPSA generally performs the best, but CMAES becomes competitive after hyperparameter tuning. In ‚Äú\\citefieldwilson2021optimizingtitle, (\\citefieldwilson2021optimizingyear)‚Äù 6, the authors compare L-BFGS-B, Nelder-Mead, Bayesian optimisation, evolutionary strategies, and a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network model (which they introduce as a meta-learner). In ‚Äú\\citefieldleng2019robusttitle, (\\citefieldleng2019robustyear)‚Äù 7, they benchmark 6 algorithms: SPSA, RSGF, finite difference stochastic approximation (FDSA), AdamSPSA, AdamRSGF and the Adam variant of FDSA (AdamFDSA). ‚Äú\\citefieldnannicini2019performancetitle, (\\citefieldnannicini2019performanceyear)‚Äù 8 compared LBFGS, COBYLA, RBFOpt, Powell, and SPSA on several combinatorial optimisation problems, finding that COBYLA, RBFOpt, LBFGS performed best, although the cost-functions considered were exact. ‚Äú\\citefieldguerreschi2017practicaltitle, (\\citefieldguerreschi2017practicalyear)‚Äù 9 looked at Nelder-Mead and BFGS (with both finite differences and analytic gradient). ‚Äú\\citefieldromero2018strategiestitle, (\\citefieldromero2018strategiesyear)‚Äù  compares Nelder-Mead, Powell, COBYLA, L-BFGS-B. ‚Äú\\citefieldwierichs2020avoidingtitle, (\\citefieldwierichs2020avoidingyear)‚Äù  compares BFGS, ADAM and natural gradient. ‚Äú\\citefieldverdon2019learningtitle, (\\citefieldverdon2019learningyear)‚Äù  does not directly focus on optimiser choice, yet uses neural networks to suggest good starting parameters, through training on the optimal parameters found in VQE runs.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: There exist several review articles on VQE and variational methods [ref]1  0 1 2.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
