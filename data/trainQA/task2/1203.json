We achieve this with the phase 2 training process in Figure 2.\nThe key idea is to transplant the learned compositional reasoning module from manipulating the visual features to manipulating Kusuperscript𝐾𝑢K^{u} and Kbsuperscript𝐾𝑏K^{b}, for attaining the answer to a question.

Then, we use two separate fully connected networks to project Kusuperscript𝐾𝑢K^{u} and K^bsuperscript^𝐾𝑏\\hat{K}^{b} respectively, concatenate and use a sequence of 1D convolution layers to project the results to the same dimension of v​s𝑣𝑠vs’s. Second, to minimize the discrepancy between the distribution of our projected vectors and that of the original visual vectors v​s𝑣𝑠vs, we fix the weights of other modules in the framework and only train the concept project module by optimizing the target function Eqn. (1). Then, we train the concept projection module and the compositional reasoning module with other modules’ weights fixed to better optimize Eqn. (1). The result is a compositional reasoning model that works on the induced concepts only.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: 98.9\n\n\n98.2\n\n\n\n99.0\n\n\n\n98.8\n\n\n\n99.3\n\n\n\n99.1\n\n\nOCCAM (ours)\n99.4\n\n\n98.1\n\n\n\n99.8\n\n\n\n99.0\n\n\n\n99.9\n\n\n\n99.9\n\n\nNS-VQA† \n99.8\n\n\n99.7\n\n\n\n99.9\n\n\n\n99.9\n\n\n\n99.8\n\n\n\n99.8\n\n\nHuman [ref]24\n92.6\n\n\n86.7\n\n\n\n96.6\n\n\n\n86.5\n\n\n\n95.0\n\n\n\n96.0\n\n\n\n (b) GQA\n\n\n\n\nmethod\nval\ntest-dev\ntest\n\nMAC \n57.5\n-\n54.1\n\nLXMERT \n-\n50.0\n-\n\nLCGN \n63.9\n55.8\n56.1\n\nOCCAM (ours)\n64.5\n56.2\n56.2\n\nMMN\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
