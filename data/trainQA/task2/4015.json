      "content": "Paper Title: ADAPT: Vision-Language Navigation with Modality-Aligned Action Prompts\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) task  , an embodied agent is required to navigate through complex scenes following a given language instruction. To accomplish successful navigation, the agent needs to implement both object-level and action-level modality alignment accurately given the instruction and visual observations. For example, given an instruction of “exit the bedroom”, the agent should not only locate the “bedroom” in its observation but also find the door of the bedroom to make the action of “exit”. With great potential in the applications such as in-home robots and personal assistants, VLN has received wide spread attention in the robotic visual applications. Early VLN approaches explore diverse data augmentation strategies    , efficient learning paradigms 1 7 5  8 and useful model architecture 1   3 to improve the agent performance. Motivated by the significant progress made by large-scale cross-modal pre-trained models in vision-language tasks     , more and more works attempt to introduce the pretraining paradigms and models into the VLN task. PREVALENT 1 pretrains the model on a large amount of image-text-action triplets in a self-supervised learning manner. VLN↻↻\\circlearrowrightBERT 4 introduces a recurrent function into the pretrained models to make the VLN agent time-aware.\nAlthough the object-level alignment ability may be significantly enhanced through the pretraining process, these VLN agents still learn the action-level modality alignment in an implicit way, which largely limits the robust action decision under different scenes. Recently, the prompt engineering paradigm has shown great potential in endowing pretrained models with diverse capabilities through simply providing prompts designed by experts or optimized with task-specific objectives [ref]28  4 6 0.\nInspired by this, we propose to introduce the prompt into the VLN task to improve the action-level modality alignment ability of the pretrained VLN agents.\nTo this end, we propose modAlity-aligneD Action PrompTs (ADAPT), where the agent is provided with explicit action prompts to make action decision.\nAn action prompt contains a pair of multi-modal sub-prompts, where the image sub-prompt is a single-view observation indicating a salient visual object or location, and the paired text sub-prompt is an object-related action phrase like “go to the staircase”. Before navigating, the instruction-related action prompts are retrieved from a pre-constructed action prompt base.\nThen the action prompts are passed through a prompt encoder and the output feature is concatenated with the original instruction feature.\nThe prompt-based instruction feature, together with the visual feature are fed to a multi-layer transformer for making action decision.\nNote that different from the common prompt engineering methods which change the output prediction form of a downstream task by introducing the prompt [ref]28, in this work, we keep the same form of the action prediction as the baseline model and focus on the design of the prompts.\nThrough these provided action prompts, the agent can learn the action-level modality alignment explicitly and make robust actions in different scenes. To enhance the discriminative power of the action prompts and enforce the agent to attend to related action prompts at each timestep, a modality alignment loss and a sequential consistency loss are further introduced into the training. Fig. 1 presents an action decision comparison between the baseline agent 4 and our ADAPT.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, with the help of the action prompts related to “walk to the staircase”, our ADAPT can choose the correct action in the given observations to navigate successfully. To collect high-quality action prompts into the action prompt base, we resort to the recently developed Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)  model which has powerful cross-modal object/location-level alignment ability. Concretely, the image sub-prompt is obtained by retrieving object/location-related images using CLIP from the action image sequence where each image contains the action information itself.\nThe text sub-prompt is derived through a simple nearest-verb-search scheme. Experimental results on both Room-to-Room (R2R)  and Room-across-Room (RxR) 9 benchmarks show the superiority of our proposed ADAPT over the state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating that introducing explicit action prompts is promising for improving the agent navigation performance. Our ablation study indicates the effectiveness of each method component and the good generalization ability of ADAPT.\nThe visualization analysis also shows its good interpretability. To summarize, the main contributions of this paper are: 1) We propose modality-aligned action prompts (ADAPT) to enforce the VLN agent to learn cross-modal action knowledge explicitly for improving action decision during navigation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop prompt-based agents in the VLN task. 2) We develop a modality alignment loss and a sequential consistency loss for enabling efficient learning of action prompts. The Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model is employed to ensure the quality of the action prompts. 3) ADAPT establishes new state-of-the-art results on both R2R and RxR. It also shows good interpretability and generalization ability.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: engineering paradigm has shown great potential in endowing pretrained models with diverse capabilities through simply providing prompts designed by experts or optimized with task-specific objectives [ref]28  4 6 0.\nInspired by this, we propose to introduce the prompt into the VLN task to improve the action-level modality alignment ability of the pretrained VLN agents.\nTo this end, we propose\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
