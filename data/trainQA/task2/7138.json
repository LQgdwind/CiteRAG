      "content": "Paper Title: Recent Advances in Text Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe deep neural network approaches to natural language processing\n(DNN-NLP)\nhave become very popular recently, with successes observed\nin a variety of NLP tasks such as text classification, question answering, machine translation, among others . In statistics, a “model” is a generative model with\nsome unknown parameters we need to estimate. In DNN-NLP,\nresearchers use the term “model” slightly differently:\na neural language model usually refers to a pre-trained neural network equipped with estimated parameters.\nA neural language model usually consists of three components as follows. A neural network architecture. This is the core of a neural language model. It specifies how an input text is processed to generate the desirable output. The encoder-decoder structure is commonly used: the encoder is a neural network that maps the input text into a numeric vector (a.k.a., the encoder state), and the decoder converts the encoder state to the targeted output (e.g., a variable-length sequence of tokens).\nMany neural network models were inspired by new architectures proposed in the literature. The NLP tasks used to train the neural networks. A neural language model\nusually targets on one specific task (e.g., machine translation) or several specific NLP tasks (e.g., the BERT model  outputs document embeddings, which can be used in various downstream tasks).\nIn either case, pre-training the neural networks (i.e., estimating the parameters) must use specific NLP tasks to define the objective function. Hence, the same architecture may lead to different neural language models if they are pre-trained using different NLP tasks. The text corpora and domain knowledge used in training.\nEven with the same architecture and the same NLP tasks in training, the resulting neural language model still varies with the training corpora. One strategy is selecting training corpora to obtain a domain-specific language model. For example, BERT has variants such as BioBERT  trained using publications in biomedicine. Besides domain-specific corpora, other knowledge such as a domain-specific vocabulary can also be employed. The research on DNN-NLP has multiple goals, including but not limited to (a) Prediction of the next word given the previous words in a sentence (e.g., GPT family ), (b) Extraction of numeric features from text (e.g., BERT family ), and (c) modeling the (synatic and semantic) relationships of words (e.g., word2vec [ref]35).\nDNN-NLP is a fast-developing area, which is hard to review comprehensively (especially as our focus is on the topic modeling approaches and the\nMADStat data). For these reasons, we select a few interesting topics in DNN-NLP to review, focusing on\n(a) popular DNN architectures for NLP, (b) BERT, a powerful feature extraction tool developed by Google Inc. We also discuss word embedding and how to apply a neural language model (e.g., BERT) to a text corpus in our own research (see Remarks 1-2).\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: words in a sentence (e.g., GPT family ), (b) Extraction of numeric features from text (e.g., BERT family ), and (c) modeling the (synatic and semantic) relationships of words (e.g., word2vec [ref]35).\nDNN-NLP is a fast-developing area, which is hard to review comprehensively (especially as our focus is on the topic modeling approaches and the\nMADStat data). For these reasons, we select a\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
