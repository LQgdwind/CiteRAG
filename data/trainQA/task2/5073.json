      "content": "Paper Title: Fast Graph Generation via Spectral Diffusion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets We test our model on three generic datasets with different scales, and we use NùëÅN to denote the number of nodes: (1) Community-small (12‚â§N‚â§20)12ùëÅ20(12\\leq N\\leq 20): contains 100 small community graphs. (2) Enzymes (10‚â§N‚â§125)10ùëÅ125(10\\leq N\\leq 125): contains 578 protein graphs which represent the protein tertiary structures of the enzymes from the BRENDA database. (3) Grid (100‚â§N‚â§400)100ùëÅ400(100\\leq N\\leq 400): contains 100 standard 2D grid graphs. To fairly compare our model with baselines, we adopt the experimental and evaluation setting from [ref]9 with the same train/test split. Baselines We compare our model with well-known or state-of-the-art graph generation methods, which can be categorized into auto-regressive models and one-shot models. The auto-regressive model refers to sequential generation, which constructs a graph via a set of consecutive steps, usually done nodes by nodes and edges by edges [ref]14. Under this category, we include DeepGMG , GraphRNN [ref]9, GraphAF , and GraphDF . The one-shot model refers to building a probabilistic graph model that can generate all nodes and edges in one shot [ref]14. Under this category, we include GraphVAE , Graph Normalizing Flow(GNF) , EDP-GNN , and GDSS [ref]10. Metrics We adopt the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to compare the distributions of graph statistics, such as the degree, the clustering coefficient, and the number of occurrences of orbits with 4 nodes¬†[ref]9 [ref]10 between the same number of generated and test graphs. Results We show the results in Table I. The results show that our proposed GSDM significantly outperforms both the auto-regressive baselines and one-shot baseline methods. Specifically, GDSS is the SOTA graph diffusion model which performs the diffusion in the whole space of the graph data. Our method substantially outperforms GDSS in terms of both average performance and convergence rate (Figure 3), which demonstrates the advantages of performing SDEs in the spectrum of the graph compared to the whole space.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: database.
