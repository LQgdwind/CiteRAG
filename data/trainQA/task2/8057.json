Compared to the non-probabilistic DP framework for termination of TRSs   3 4,\nanalyzing 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} automatically is significantly more difficult due tothe lack of a “minimality property” in the probabilistic setting,\nwhich would allowseveral further processors.\nMoreover, the ADP framework for PTRSs is\nrestricted to multilinear reduction pairs.\nThe following table compares the ADP frameworks for 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST}, 𝚋𝙰𝚂𝚃𝚋𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{bAST}, and 𝚒𝙰𝚂𝚃𝚒𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{iAST}.\nThe parts in italics show the differences to the non-probabilistic\nDP framework.\nHere,\n“S” and “C” stand for “sound” and “complete”. For our experimental evaluation, we compared all existing approaches\nto prove (𝚋)​𝙰𝚂𝚃𝚋𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{(b)AST} of PTRSs.\nMore precisely, we compared our implementation of the novel ADP framework for\n(𝚋)​𝙰𝚂𝚃𝚋𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{(b)AST} in\na new version of AProVE \nwith the old version of AProVE that only implements the techniques from [ref]30 8 [ref]31,\nand with the direct application of polynomial interpretations from\n8.888In addition, an alternative technique to analyze\nPTRSs via a direct application of\ninterpretations\nwas presented in .\nHowever,  analyzes 𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{PAST}\n(or rather strong 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST}), and a\ncomparison with their technique can be found in 8. To this end, we extended the existing benchmark set of 118 PTRSs from\n[ref]30 by\n12 new examples including all PTRSs\npresented in this paper and PTRSs for typical\nprobabilistic algorithms on lists and trees.\nOf these 130 examples, the direct application of polynomials can find 37 (1) 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} proofs,\nold AProVE shows 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} for\n50 (1) PTRSs,\nand our new AProVE version proves 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} for\n58 (6) examples.\nIn brackets we indicate the number of 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} proofs when only regarding the\n12 new examples.\nThe 118 benchmarks from [ref]30 lack non-determinism by overlapping rules and\nthus,\nhere we are only able to prove 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} for three more examples\nthan oldAProVE.\nIn contrast, our new 12 examples contain non-determinism and create random\ndata objects, which are accessed or modified afterwards (see App. 0.A).Our experiments show that our novel ADP framework can for the first time\nprove 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} of such PTRSs.\nIf we consider basic start terms, the numbers rise to 62 (1) for old AProVE and\n74 (8) for new AProVE.\nFor details on our experiments and for instructions on how to run our implementation in\nAProVE via its web\ninterface or locally, see https://aprove-developers.github.io/ADPFrameworkFullAST. Reduction pairs were also adapted to disprove reachability ,\nand thus,\nin thefuture\nwe will also\nintegrate\nreachability analysis into the ADP framework for 𝚋𝙰𝚂𝚃𝚋𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{bAST}.Moreover, we aim to\nanalyze stronger properties like 𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{PAST}\nvia DPs.\nHere, we will again start with innermost evaluation,\nwhich is easier to analyze.\nFurthermore, we want to develop methods to automatically\ndisprove (𝙿)​𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{(P)AST} of PTRSs.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: In this paper, we introduced the first DP framework for\n𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} and 𝚋𝙰𝚂𝚃𝚋𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{bAST} of PTRSs, which is based on the\nexisting ADP framework from [ref]31 for 𝚒𝙰𝚂𝚃𝚒𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{iAST}.\nIt is particularly useful when analyzing (𝚋)​𝙰𝚂𝚃𝚋𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{(b)AST}\nof overlapping PTRSs,\nas for such PTRSs we cannot use the criteria of [ref]30\nfor classes of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
