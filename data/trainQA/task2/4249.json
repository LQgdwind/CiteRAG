      "content": "Paper Title: Spherical Channels for Modeling Atomic Interactions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nModeling the properties of atomic systems is a foundational challenge in computational chemistry and critical to advancing technologies across numerous application domains. Notable applications include drug discovery¬†  and the design of new catalysts for renewable energy storage to help in addressing climate change¬† . For catalyst discovery, new materials are currently evaluated using Density Functional Theory (DFT) that can estimate atomic energies and forces but is computationally very expensive; taking hours or days to evaluate a single material. Machine Learning (ML) has the potential to approximate DFT and dramatically speed up these calculations, allowing for high throughput screening of new materials to help address some of the world‚Äôs most pressing challenges. Our goal is to approximate DFT calculations using ML. An ML model takes as input a set of atom positions and their atomic numbers. As outputs, a model calculates the structure‚Äôs energy (or other properties) and the per-atom forces, i.e., the forces exerted on each atom by the other atoms. A common approach to this problem is to use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)  [ref]47 where each node represents an atom and the set of nearby atoms as edges¬†   5    . A key challenge in network design is balancing the use of model constraints. When modeling atomic systems, a common constraint is SO(3) rotation equivariance    [ref]42 4 6, i.e., if the atomic system is rotated, the energies should remain constant and the atomic forces should similarly rotate. While this provides strong priors on the model to help in generalization, especially for smaller datasets , it can result in limiting the expressiveness of the network due to restrictions on non-linear transformations for equivariant models  [ref]42 4 6, or limiting interactions to pairs 5  , triplets  or quadruplets of atoms  4 5 for invariant models. Alternatively, a non-equivariant model  can provide more freedom to the model, but lead to the model needing to learn approximate equivariance through methods such as data augmentation . To draw an analogy with image detection, the use of a CNN  provides translation equivariance and removes the need for the network to learn how to detect the same object at different locations. However, most CNNs are not equivariant to scale or rotation  , but are still effective in learning approximate equivariance through rotation and scale diversity in the training data. What is the analogous balance of constraints for modeling atomic systems? In this paper, we propose a GNN  [ref]47 that balances the use of model constraints to aid in generalization while providing the network with the flexibility to learn accurate representations. We introduce the Spherical Channel Network (SCN) that explicitly models relative orientations of all neighboring atoms; information that is critical to accurately predicting atomic properties. Each node‚Äôs embedding is a set of functions defined on the surface of a sphere (S2‚Üí‚Ñù)‚ÜísuperscriptùëÜ2‚Ñù(S^{2}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}). The functions are represented using spherical harmonics, similar to approaches that build strictly equivariant models¬†[ref]42   0. During message passing, angular information between atoms is conveyed by rotating or steering  the embeddings based on each edge‚Äôs orientation¬† . We identify an expanded set of spherical harmonic coefficients that are invariant to rotation, which can provide rich information while maintaining a message‚Äôs rotation equivariance. In addition, we demonstrate that if the equivariance constraint is relaxed, improved performance can be achieved by using additional coefficients. We further improve the expressivity of the network by performing a pointwise non-linear function, which is only approximately equivariant, on the embeddings during message aggregation. We demonstrate our Spherical Channel Network on the large-scale Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) dataset , which contains atomic structures useful for numerous applications important to addressing climate change. State-of-the-art results are achieved for atomic force and initial structure to relaxed energy prediction with improvements of 8%‚àí11%percent8percent118\\%-11\\%. In addition, we demonstrate our model is more sample efficient as compared to other state-of-the-art models.\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: structure‚Äôs energy (or other properties) and the per-atom forces, i.e., the forces exerted on each atom by the other atoms.
