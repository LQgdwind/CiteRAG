      "content": "Paper Title: Adversarial Illusions in Multi-Modal Embeddings\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nModels. \nWe use four encoder families. For our white-box attacks, we use ImageBind 0 and AudioCLIP , popular open-source text, image, and audio encoders.\nFor our transfer attacks, we use the OpenCLIP family (ViT and ResNet50)    as surrogate models. For our query-based attack, we Amazon’s proprietary, black-box Titan encoder. Datasets. \nWe evaluate our (image, text) and (audio, text) adversarial alignment on random, 100100100-datapoint subsets of ImageNet , AudioSet , and AudioCaps  datasets. Before subsetting, we permute the datasets by randomly matching source inputs in one modality to target inputs in another modality. The adversary is thus asked to produce a perturbation for each source that aligns its embedding with a random target, which is strictly harder than an untargeted attack. Following is a brief summary of each dataset: ImageNet is an image-classification dataset that naturally aligns images and WordNet text labels. Before evaluating on the downstream tasks, each label y𝑦y is injected into the templates introduced in [ref]32 (i.e., y←“A photo of a {y}.”←𝑦“A photo of a {y}.”y\\leftarrow\\text{``A photo of a \\{$y$\\}.''}). AudioSet is an audio-classification dataset that associates audio samples and WordNet text labels. Labels are embedded as-is. AudioCLIP is the only encoder trained on (audio, text) data, thus audio-text alignment is “emergent” for the other encoders. AudioCaps is an audio-retrieval dataset based on AudioSet that associates audio samples with text captions. Downstream tasks.  \nWe evaluate our attack on the following downstream tasks: Image and Audio Zero-shot Classification. Given a set of labels 𝒴𝒴\\mathcal{Y}, input x𝑥x is assigned the label y∈𝒴𝑦𝒴y\\in\\mathcal{Y} whose embedding is closest to the embedding of x𝑥x. Audio Retrieval. Similarly to classification, audio input x𝑥x “retrieves” the closest caption y𝑦y in embedding space. Image Generation. Images are generated from embeddings using BindDiffusion [ref]25 and evaluated using an image classifier. Because available generative models sometimes fail to produce correct outputs even on the embeddings of clean images (the generated image does not match the semantics of the input image), we only evaluate our attack on sources for which generation produces correctly classified images. We further explain this limitation below. Text Generation. For Figures 2, 4, 4, 8 and 8, texts are generated from embeddings using PandaGPT . Since there are many possible classifications of a given text, we omit quantitative evaluation of generated texts and only provide examples to illustrate that the attack influences downstream text generation. Evaluation metrics. \nTo evaluate the effect of our attacks, we measure raw adversarial alignment and, for each downstream task, the attack success rate with Top-1 (T-1) and Top-5 (T-5) accuracies. For most of our experiments, the error bars are standard deviations computed over a 100-sample subset, while for Amazon’s Titan, we measure over 50 samples. As explained in Section 5.1, image classification, audio classification, and audio retrieval accuracies are measured in a zero-shot fashion, while generated images are classified using a pre-trained vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) . Limitations of downstream tasks. \nGenerative models based on multi-modal embeddings are a new, rapidly evolving field, and publicly available implementations are limited. We only consider BindDiffusion [ref]25 and PandaGPT . BindDiffusion uses the unCLIP model  trained on CLIP embeddings [ref]32. Even in the absence of adversarial perturbations, BindDiffusion appears to generate poor-quality images from the embeddings of many images, sounds, and texts.\nPandaGPT, although trained on ImageBind embeddings, was fine-tuned only on image-text pairs. Therefore, in some cases, it interprets embeddings of sounds as if they were images (see Figure 4). Our attack is agnostic with respect to downstream models, and we expect that improvements in the quality of the latter will make the attack more effective. Hyperparameters. \nFor the white-box experiments, we present our results at various maximum perturbations: ϵ=ϵV255italic-ϵsubscriptitalic-ϵ𝑉255\\epsilon=\\frac{\\epsilon_{V}}{255} where ϵV∈{1,4,8,16,32}subscriptitalic-ϵ𝑉1481632\\epsilon_{V}\\in\\{1,4,8,16,32\\} for images, ϵ=ϵA∈{0.005,0.01,0.05,0.1,0.5}italic-ϵsubscriptitalic-ϵ𝐴0.0050.010.050.10.5\\epsilon=\\epsilon_{A}\\in\\{0.005,0.01,0.05,0.1,0.5\\} for audio. Illusions are trained for T=7,500𝑇7500T=7,500 iterations in both cases. For the transfer experiments, we set the standard ϵ=16255italic-ϵ16255\\epsilon=\\frac{16}{255} and evaluate for T=300𝑇300T=300 iterations. For the query-based experiments (including the hybrid attack), we use the same hyperparameters as the Square attack  with the maximum perturbation ϵ=16255italic-ϵ16255\\epsilon=\\frac{16}{255}, query limit N=100,000𝑁100000N=100,000, and other hyperparameters unchanged.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: is an image-classification dataset that naturally aligns images and WordNet text labels.
