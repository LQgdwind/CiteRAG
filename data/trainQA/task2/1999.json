      "content": "Paper Title: Zorro: Valid, Sparse, and Stable Explanations in Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph neural networks (GNNs) are a flexible and powerful family of models that build representations of nodes or edges on irregular graph-structured data and have experienced significant attention in recent years.\nGNNs are based on the “neighborhood aggregation” scheme, where a node representation is learned by aggregating features from their neighbors.\nLearning complex neighborhood aggregations and latent feature extraction has enabled GNNs to achieve state-of-the-art performance on node and graph classification tasks.\nThis complexity, on the other hand, leads to a more opaque and non-interpretable model.\nTo alleviate the problem of interpretability, we focus on explaining the rationale underlying a given prediction of already trained GNNs. There are diverse notions and regimes of explainability and interpretability for machine learning models – (a) interpretable models vs. post-hoc explanations, (b) model-introspective vs. model-agnostic explanations, (c) outputs in terms of feature vs. data attributions  [ref]21. In this work, we aim to explain the decision of an already trained GNN model, i.e., compute post-hoc explanations for a trained GNN.\nAdditionally, we do not assume any access to the trained model parameters, i.e., we are model-agnostic or black-box regime.\nFinally, our explanation attributes the reason for an underlying GNN prediction to either a subset of features or neighboring nodes or both. There has been recent interest in designing explainers for GNNs that produce feature attributions in a post-hoc manner  [ref]38  where a combination of nodes, edges, or features is retrieved as an explanation.\nWe introduce some essential notions of validity, sparsity, and stability for explaining GNNs and argue that many of the existing works on explainable GNNs do not satisfy these principles.\nTo systematically fill in the above gaps, we commence by formulating three desired properties of a GNN explanation: validity, sparsity, and stability. Figure 1 provides an illustration of these three properties. Validity. Existing explanations approaches used for explaining GNNs like gradient-based feature attribution techniques select nodes or features  are not optimized to be valid as well as being explanatory.\nAn explanation is valid if just the explanation (a subset of features and nodes) as input would be sufficient to arrive at the same prediction. Sparsity. It is easy to see that validity alone is not sufficient for an explanation as the entire input is a valid explanation . Ideally, the explanation should only highlight those parts of the input with the highest discriminative information.\nExisting explanation approaches accomplish this by outputting distributions or soft-masks over input features or nodes .\nHowever, humans find it hard to make sense of soft masks and instead prefer sparse binary masks or hard masks   7 .\nWe define sparsity as the size of the explanation in terms of number of non-zero elements in the explanation.\nA sparse explanation in the form of a hard mask is, therefore, more desirable and reduces ambiguities due to soft masks 3. Stability. Validity and sparsity, though necessary, are not sufficient to define an explanation.\nIn Section 3.2, we show that the trivial empty explanation (all features are replaced by 00s) could be a valid explanation for many cases.\nThe high validity observed in such cases is an artifact of a particular configuration of trained model parameters.\nWe would rather expect that the model retains its predicted class with only the knowledge of the explanation while the rest of the information in the input is filled randomly. In other words, an explanation should be valid independent of the rest of the input.\nWe say that an explanation is stable if the behavior of the GNN is unaffected by the features outside of the explanation.\nMost of the existing works do not consider stability in their modeling of explanation approaches. In this paper, we introduce a new metric called RDT-Fidelity which is grounded in the principles of rate-distortion theory and reflects these three desiderata into a single measure.\nEssentially, we cast the problem of finding explanations given a trained model as a signal/message reconstruction task involving a sender, a receiver, and a noisy channel.\nThe message sent by the sender is the actual feature vector, with the explanation being a subset of immutable feature values.\nThe noisy channel can obfuscate only the features that do not belong to the explanation. The explanation’s RDT-Fidelity lies in the degree to which the decoder can faithfully reconstruct from the noisy feature vector.\nOptimizing RDT-Fidelity is NP-hard, and we consequently propose a greedy combinatorial procedure Zorro that generates sparse, valid, and stable explanations. Accurately measuring the actual effectiveness of post-hoc explanations has been acknowledged to be a challenging problem due to the lack of explanation ground truth.\nWe carry out an extensive and comprehensive experimental study on several experimental regimes 0  , three real-world datasets  and four different GNN architectures 8  9  to evaluate the effectiveness of our explanations. In addition to measuring validity, sparsity, and RDT-Fidelity, we also compare our approach with respect to the evaluation regime proposed in GNNExplainer, the faithfulness measure proposed in  and the ROAR methodology from 0. Firstly, we establish that Zorro outperforms all other baselines over different evaluation regimes on both real-world and synthetic datasets.\nBased on Zorro’s explanation, we retrieve valuable insights into the GNN’s behavior: different GNN’s derive their decisions from different large portions of the input, and more available features do not mean more relevant features; the GNN’s base their classification on different scales on the local homophily; multiple disjoint explanations are possible, i.e., GNN’s classification is derived from disjoint parts of the network (duplicated information flow). To sum up, our main contributions are: We theoretically investigate the key properties of validity, sparsity, and stability that a GNN explanation should follow. We introduce a novel evaluation metric, RDT-Fidelity derived from principles of rate-distortion theory that reflects these desiderata into a single measure. We propose a simple combinatorial called Zorro to find high RDT-Fidelity explanations with theoretically bounded stability. We release our code at https://github.com/funket/zorro. We perform extensive scale experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.\nWe show that Zorro not only outperforms baselines for RDT-Fidelity but also for several evaluation regimes so far proposed in the literature.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: for machine learning models – (a) interpretable models vs. post-hoc explanations, (b) model-introspective vs. model-agnostic explanations, (c) outputs in terms of feature vs. data attributions  [ref]21.
