      "content": "Paper Title: CryptoSPN: Privacy-preserving Sum-Product Network Inference\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe shortly recapitulate the most influential works for preserving privacy when performing machine learning tasks using SC techniques. Privacy-preserving neural network inference was first proposed in   .\nSecure classification via hyper-plane decision, naive Bayes, and decision trees was presented in .\nSecureML 1 provides SMPC-friendly linear regression, logistic regression, and neural network training using SGD as well as secure inference.\nWith CryptoNets , the race for the fastest NN-based privacy-preserving image classification began:\nMiniONN , Chameleon , Gazelle , XONN 9, and DELPHI 0 are only some of the proposed frameworks. These frameworks mostly offer privacy-preserving deep/convolutional neural network inference based on HE or SMPC protocols, or even combinations of both techniques in different computational and security models.\nHowever, they are not readily accessible to ML experts, as prototype implementations are not well-integrated into ML frameworks and require extensive cryptographic knowledge to secure applications.\nMoreover, these frameworks are often engineered towards delivering outstanding performance for benchmarks with certain standard data sets (e.g., MNIST ), but fail to generalize in terms of accuracy and performance.\nThere are some but very few attempts to directly integrate privacy technology into ML frameworks: for TensorFlow there exists rudimentary support for differential privacy , HE , and SMPC 0, and for Intel’s nGraph compiler there exists an HE backend .\nVery recenty, Facebook’s AI researchers released CrypTen 8, which provides an SMPC integration with PyTorch.\nHowever, currently not much is known about the underlying cryptographic techniques and, therefore, its security guarantees. Trusted execution environments (TEEs) are an intriguing alternative to cryptographic protocols.\nThey use hardware features to shield sensitive data processing tasks.\nTEEs are widely available, e.g., via Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), and therefore are explored for efficiently performing ML tasks .\nUnfortunately, Intel SGX provides no provable security guarantees and requires software developers to manually incorporate defenses against software side-channel attacks, which is extremely difficult.\nMoreover, severe attacks on Intel SGX allowed to extract private data from the TEE, making SGX less secure than cryptographic protocols [ref]8.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: software side-channel attacks, which is extremely difficult.\nMoreover, severe attacks on Intel SGX allowed to extract private data from the TEE, making SGX less secure than cryptographic protocols [ref]8.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object. Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.
