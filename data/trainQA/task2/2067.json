      "content": "Paper Title: On the KLM properties of a fuzzy DL with Typicality\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPreferential approaches have been used to provide axiomatic foundations of non-monoto- nic and\ncommon sense reasoning        .\nThey have been extended to description logics (DLs), as well as to the first order case , to deal with inheritance with exceptions in ontologies,\nby allowing for non-strict forms of inclusions,\ncalled typicality or defeasible inclusions, with different preferential semantics 0  1\nand closure constructions   2  5  [ref]28. In previous work [ref]24, a concept-wise multipreference semantics\nfor weighted knowledge bases has been proposed to account for preferences with respect to different concepts,\nby allowing, for a concept C𝐶C, a set of typicality inclusions of the form 𝐓​(C)⊑Dsquare-image-of-or-equals𝐓𝐶𝐷{\\bf T}(C)\\sqsubseteq D (meaning “the typical C𝐶C’s are D𝐷D’s” or “normally C𝐶C’s are D𝐷D’s”) with positive or negative weights.\nThe concept-wise multipreference semantics\nhas been first introduced as a semantics for ranked DL knowledge bases [ref]25 and extended in [ref]24 to weighted knowledge bases in the two-valued and fuzzy case, based on a different semantic closure construction,\nstill in the spirit of Lehmann’s lexicographic closure  and Kern-Isberner’s c-representations  6, but exploiting multiple preferences associated to concepts.\nA related semantics with multiple preferences has been proposed in the first-order logic setting by Delgrande and Rantsaudis , and an extension of DLs with defeasible role quantifiers and defeasible role inclusions has been developed by Britz and Varzinczak  , by associating multiple preferences to roles. The concept-wise multipreference semantics\nhas been proved to have some desired properties from the knowledge representation point of view in the two-valued case [ref]25. In particular, it satisfies the KLM postulates of a preferential consequence relation.\nThe properties\nof entailment in a fuzzy DL with typicality have not been studied so far. In this paper,\na monotonic extension of a fuzzy 𝒜​ℒ​𝒞𝒜ℒ𝒞\\mathcal{ALC} with typicality is considered (called 𝒜​ℒ​𝒞𝐅​𝐓𝒜ℒsuperscript𝒞𝐅𝐓\\mathcal{ALC}^{{\\bf F}}{\\bf T}) and the KLM properties of a preferential consequence relation are reformulated for this logic. Most of the postulates are satisfied, depending on the reformulation and on the chosen fuzzy combination functions. The closure construction developed in [ref]24 to define the models of a weighted defeasible knowledge base in the fuzzy case is reconsidered,\nby introducing a notion of faithful model of a weighted (fuzzy) knowledge base which is weaker than the notion of coherent fuzzy multipreference model in [ref]24. This allows us to capture the larger class of monotone non-decreasing activation functions in Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) 3,\nbased on the idea that, in a deep neural network, synaptic connections can be regarded as weighted conditionals.\nThe paper discusses the properties of faithful multipreference entailment for weighted conditionals in a fuzzy DL.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: exceptions in ontologies,\nby allowing for non-strict forms of inclusions,\ncalled typicality or defeasible inclusions, with different preferential semantics 0  1\nand closure constructions   2  5  [ref]28.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
