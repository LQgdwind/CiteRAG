WPedRVFL‚Ä† PedRVFL‚Ä† WedRVFL‚Ä† edRVFL_N‚Ä† edRVFL_O SNN MS H-ELM HW[ref]43 Resnet[ref]44 SCN BLS The empty cell in the table means the corresponding method in the row and column have no significant statistical difference. The symbol ‚Äô+‚Äô indicates that the method in the row is statistically better than the method in the column. On the other hand, the symbol ‚Äô-‚Äô means the method in the row is statistically worse than that in the column. Methods with ‚Ä† are proposed in this paper. We take the results of SNN, MS, HW, and Resnet directly from . The rankings of each classifier are used to compare their performance on all the datasets. For the ranking method, the best classifier based on the classification accuracy of one dataset is ranked 1, the second is ranked 2, and so on. Then we use the average rank of all 24 datasets to show the performance of the classifiers. The best results for each dataset, as well as the best global rank and accuracy, are given in bold. Wilcoxon signed-rank test is a non-parametric statistical hypothesis test used to compare the performance of two related measurements on multiple tasks . In this paper, we employ it to do the pairwise comparison on the selected two methods to investigate the statistical difference between them. We first compare all the other 11 methods‚Äô performance with WPedRVFL. And the results are shown in Table 4. From the table, we can see that all leading positions are occupied by edRVFL based methods. The top-ranked method is WPedRVFL and followed by WedRVFL. PedRVFL takes the third place, and edRVFL_N, edRVFL_O are following behind. By performing the statistical comparison, we know that except for PedRVFL network, WPedRVFL significantly outperforms all the other competitors. We also use the Wilcoxon test to do the pairwise comparison between all the 12 classifiers in this paper. The results are shown in Table 5. If there is no statistically significant difference between the methods in the corresponding row and column, the cells where they intersect will be empty. If the symbol in the cell is ‚Äò+‚Äô, that means the method in the corresponding row is statistically better than that in the column. On the contrary, the symbol ‚Äò-‚Äô indicates that the method in the corresponding row is statistically worse.

We summarize their performance in Table 6. From it, we can learn that our new methods WedRVFL, PedRVFL, and WPedRVFL are more robust than the basic edRVFL_O and edRVFL_N. Among them, PedRVFL has the smallest std value. Since WPedRVFL is the combination of WedRVFL and PedRVFL, so we believe this is the reason why its std value is between WedRVFL and PedRVFL. From all the Tables above, we know that our new proposed methods, edRVFL_N, WedRVFL, PedRVFL, and WPedRVFL, show great performance on 24 UCI classification tasks. Among them, WPedRVFL takes great advantage both in the average rank and mean accuracy compared to all other methods. It significantly outperforms other FNNs like Resnet, HW, MS, and SNN. And it also has a significant statistical difference from other randomized neural networks. Moreover, the standard deviation of our new methods are smaller than the original edRVFL networks. Therefore, WPedRVFL can be considered as a highly competitive classifier on tabular classification tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: Rank\npùëùp-value\n\n\n\nWPedRVFL\n1.42\n\n\nPedRVFL\n3.02\n1.7e-1\n\nWedRVFL‚àó\n3.04\n6.7e-4\n\nedRVFL_N‚àó\n4.85\n2.5e-3\n\nedRVFL_O‚àó \n7.00\n1.7e-3\n\nSNN‚àó \n7.29\n6.7e-4\n\nMS‚àó \n7.42\n1.1e-4\n\nH-ELM‚àó \n7.77\n5.6e-5\n\nHW‚àó [ref]43\n7.83\n2.4e-5\n\nResnet‚àó [ref]44\n7.85\n1.8e-5\n\nSCN‚àó \n10.08\n1.8e-5\n\nBLS‚àó \n10.42\n1.8e-5\n\n Lower rank reÔ¨Çects better performance.
