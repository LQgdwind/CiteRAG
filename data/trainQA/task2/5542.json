      "content": "Paper Title: Sanity checks and improvements for patch visualisation in prototype-based image classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDue to the difficulty of quantifying similarity between images in the visual space (i.e. the space of RGB images), self-explaining image classification models based on prototypes first encode images into a high dimensional feature space (also called latent space) - usually using a pre-trained DCNN (e.g. Resnet50 , VGG ) called a backbone, assuming that such encoding preserves visual cues (e.g. colour, shape) while being insensitive to minor deformations such as rotations, shifts, changes in scale. This latent representation can be composed of a single vector summarizing the information of the entire image, or composed of an array of vectors - corresponding to the output of a convolution layer - and retaining a form of spatial relationship between each vector and a region of the input image (see Fig. 3). Since this spatial relationship is at the heart of this contribution, we purposefully exclude self-explaining image classification models that uses full images as prototypes    from our study. Indeed, such architectures use a single latent vector representation, resulting in a trivial relationship between the full image and its latent representation. In this contribution, we rather focus on models where each vector in the latent space corresponds to a part of an image. During training, such models extract a set of reference vectors and their visual counterparts from the training set, called part prototypes (for simplicity, we simply use the term prototypes). Prototypes are either discriminative of a particular class [ref]12 [ref]16  (given by the label of the corresponding training image) or shared among multiple classes [ref]30  .\nDuring inference, the similarity between a given prototype and the test image is computed using the L2-distance (or cosine distance ) between their respective latent representations, under the assumption that proximity between vectors in the latent space should entail similarity in the visual space. In the case of ProtoPNet [ref]12, ProtoPShare , ProtoPool , Deformable ProtoPNet [ref]16 and TesNet ,\nall similarity scores are then processed through a fully connected layer to produce the final classification. In the case of ProtoTree [ref]30, these similarity scores are used to compute a path across a soft decision tree where each leaf corresponds to one particular class. \nIt is important to indicate that although our study focuses on ProtoPNet and ProtoTree, all the aforementioned methods (ProtoPShare, ProtoPool, Deformable ProtoPNet, TesNet) share a common code base inherited from ProtoPNet and therefore are theoretically susceptible to the issue raised in this contribution.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: vectors and their visual counterparts from the training set, called part prototypes (for simplicity, we simply use the term prototypes). Prototypes are either discriminative of a particular class [ref]12 [ref]16  (given by the label of the corresponding training image) or shared among multiple classes [ref]30  .\nDuring inference, the similarity between a given prototype and the test image is\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
