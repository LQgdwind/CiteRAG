      "content": "Paper Title: Adversarial Robustness with Non-uniform Perturbations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep neural networks (DNNs) are commonly used in a wide-variety of security-critical applications such as self-driving cars, spam detection, malware detection and medical diagnosis [ref]1.\nHowever, DNNs have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs), which are perturbed inputs designed to fool the machine learning systems   . To mitigate this problem, a line of research has focused on adversarial robustness of DNNs as well as the certification of these methods [ref]1    [ref]8 [ref]9 . Adversarial training (AT) is one of the most effective empirical defenses against adversarial attacks [ref]1 . The goal during training is to minimize the loss of the DNN when perturbed samples are used. This way, the model becomes robust to real-world adversarial attacks. Though these empirical defenses do not provide theoretically provable guarantees, they have been shown to be robust against the strongest known attacks . Some of the most common state-of-the-art adversarial attacks, such as projected gradient descent (PGD) [ref]1 and fast gradient sign method (FGSM) , perturb training samples under a norm-ball constraint to maximize the loss of the network. The goal of certification, on the other hand, is to report whether an AE exists within an ‚Ñìpsubscript‚Ñìùëù\\ell_{p} norm centered at a given sample with a fixed radius. Certified defense approaches introduce theoretical robustness guarantees against norm-bounded perturbations [ref]8 [ref]9  . In the computer vision domain, the adversary‚Äôs goal is to generate perturbed images that cause misclassifications in a DNN. It is often assumed that limiting a uniform norm-ball constraint results in perturbations that are imperceptible to the human eye. However in other applications such as fraud detection , spam detection , credit card default prediction   and malware detection  0 1, norm-bounded uniform perturbations may result in unrealistic transformations. Perturbed samples must comply with certain constraints related to the domain, hence preventing us from borrowing these assumptions from computer vision. These constraints can be on semantically meaningful feature dependencies, expert knowledge of possible attacks, and immutable features 0 2. This paper proposes a methodology to generate non-uniform perturbations that takes into account the characteristics of the empirical data distribution. Our results demonstrate that these non-uniform perturbations outperform uniform norm-ball constraints in these types of applications.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are commonly used in a wide-variety of security-critical applications such as self-driving cars, spam detection, malware detection and medical diagnosis [ref]1.\nHowever, DNNs have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs), which are perturbed inputs designed to fool the machine learning systems   .
