      "content": "Paper Title: Recent Developments in Deep Learning-based Author Name Disambiguation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning supervised techniques make use of labelled training data manually created or collected from annotated databases, usually inputted into a classifier. In this setting, the inputs may for example include a set of publication features like co-authors, title words, year of publications and venue information, and the output is usually an author identifier/class. Capsule Neural Networks (CapsNets): Firdaus et al. (2021) [ref]16 proposed a CapsNet model for author classification using bibliographic data from DBLP. CapsNets encode author attributes, including name, co-authors, venue, title, and year, into activation vectors that capture entities’ properties and spatial relationships. This enriched representation outperformed traditional neural networks, achieving an impressive 99.83% accuracy on test data, highlighting the efficacy of CapsNets for AND. WhoIs Model: Boukhers et al. (2022) [ref]17 introduced the WhoIs model, a deep neural network designed for author disambiguation. The model uses Char2Vec embeddings to capture orthographic similarities between author names and BERT to generate contextualized embeddings for publication titles and sources. By training separate networks for each atomic name variant (e.g., initials and surname) and integrating co-author and research field information, WhoIs improves disambiguation accuracy. Bib2Auth Model: Boukhers et al. (2021)  also proposed Bib2Auth, a neural network model with two input layers. The first encodes the concatenation of co-author and content embeddings, where the content embedding is the average of title and source embeddings. The second input layer encodes the target author embedding. Author and co-author embeddings are generated using Char2Vec, which positions similar words closely in the representation space. Title and source embeddings are generated using BERT, providing contextualized word representations. Separating the inputs addresses content sparsity and enhances feature focus. Hybrid Deep Pairwise Classification: Kim et al. (2019) [ref]19 developed a hybrid approach combining structural and global features. Structural features, such as cosine similarities of attributes, are combined with global semantic features extracted via a DNN. Using Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT) for pairwise classification, the model determines whether two mentions belong to the same author, demonstrating the strength of hybrid frameworks in balancing feature complexity and classification efficiency. CONNA: Zhao et al. (2022)  introduced CONNA, a framework designed for real-time AND as new articles are added to a system. It combines embedding techniques with pairwise classification to either assign publications to existing author profiles or create new ones. Notably, CONNA incorporates a \"NIL\" candidate for cases where an author is absent from the system and uses a multi-field profile (MFP) to capture attributes such as affiliations and publication venues. Co-Attention-Based Pairwise Learning: Wang et al. (2023)  proposed a novel approach focusing on pairwise comparisons between author names using co-attention mechanisms. Their model integrates textual, categorical, and co-authorship attributes to capture the relationships between bibliographic features effectively. Self-attention and co-attention mechanisms ensure the model prioritizes the most relevant input features, enhancing disambiguation performance. Toward a New Paradigm for AND: (Manzoor et al. 2022)  leveraged Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for semantic name disambiguation using the PubMed dataset. The model processes sequences of words from attributes such as co-authors, affiliations, and publication titles, extracting meaningful semantic relationships. While the CNN architecture is not detailed, the study emphasizes the network’s ability to capture patterns within bibliographic metadata. Deep Neural Network Structure to Improve Individual Performance based Author Classification:\nFirdaus et al. (2019)  apply a DNN to a dataset of 125 Scopus publications from nine Indonesian authors, addressing both homonymy and synonymy. Data pairs were labeled (1 for the same author, 0 otherwise) and processed using Levenshtein distance with Z-score normalization. The best results (99.6% accuracy) were achieved with 2–5 hidden layers using ReLU and Sigmoid activation functions. Identification of Indonesian Authors Using Deep Neural Networks: (Firdaus et al., 2022)  developed a custom dataset consisting of 125 publications from 9 Indonesian authors with the following attributes; author name, title, year, source, author affiliation, co-authors name instances extracted from Scopus to address AND for Indonesian authors. Preprocessing steps included normalization, label encoding, and PCA for dimensionality reduction. The DNN classifier incorporated ReLU activation functions in hidden layers and a softmax output layer. The result shows that the level of accuracy is 99.6%on average. Strong Baselines for Author Name Disambiguation with and Without Neural Networks: Zhang, Yu, Liu, & Wang, 2020  This study introduces a robust pipeline combining pre-merging strategies (PMS) based on co-authorship, simple neural networks (SNN) for title-based semantic similarity, and post-blocking strategies (PBS) for cluster refinement. By integrating these techniques, the model efficiently clusters publications and improves disambiguation accuracy. Multiple Features Driven Author Name Disambiguation:\nZhou, Chen, Wang, Xu, Zhao, 2021  construct six similarity graphs (using the raw document and fusion feature) for each ambiguous author name. The structural information (global and local) extracted from these graphs is inputted into a novel encoder called R3JG, which integrates and reconstructs the information for an author. An author is therefore associated with four types of information: the raw document feature, the publication embedding based on the raw feature, the local structural information from the neighborhood, and the global structural information of the graph. Each node is embedded by using the random walk. The goal of the framework is to learn the latent information to enhance the generalization ability of the MFAND. Then, the integrated and reconstructed information is fed into a binary classification model for disambiguation. Towards Effective Author Name Disambiguation by Hybrid Attention:\nIn Zhou et al., 2024  the Feature Extraction Model (EX) is composed of three hybrid attention mechanism layers, and each layer contains three key modules, i.e., a local structural perception, a global structural perception, and a feature extractor. Local structural perception consists of five hybrid GAT layers, whereas global structural perception consists of GCN and a single layer feedforward neural network. In the Decision Model (DI) generated triplets are fed into an MLP classifier for disambiguation between each publication pair. Pairwise Learning for Name Disambiguation in Large-Scale Heterogeneous Academic Networks\nSun et al., 2020  introduce Multi-view Attention-based Pairwise Recurrent Neural Network (MA-PairRNN) to solve the name disambiguation problem combining heterogeneous graph embedding learning and pairwise similarity learning into a framework. In addition to attribute and structure information, MA-PairRNN also exploits semantic information by meta-path and generates node representation in an inductive way. Furthermore, a semantic-level attention mechanism is adopted to fuse multiple meta-path based representations. A Pseudo-Siamese network consisting of two RNNs takes two paper sequences in publication time order as input and outputs their similarity. Name Disambiguation Scheme Based on Heterogeneous Academic Sites:\nChoi et al., 2023  propose a name disambiguation framework combining rule-based methods with deep learning. The rule-based component evaluates key attributes such as affiliation, publication year, and co-authors, assigning weights to attribute matches (e.g., exact title matches receive the highest weight). The deep learning component leverages a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to analyze vector representations of titles, keywords, and abstracts, effectively handling incomplete or inconsistent metadata.The GCN was performed using the created adjacency and feature matrices. Ultimately, based on the learned feature vectors, HAC was carried out for name disambiguation. A multi-classifier selects the most suitable approach based on available metadata, trained on labeled data and adaptable to future disambiguation schemes. Author Name Disambiguation Using Multiple Graph Attention Networks\nZhang et al. (2021)  explore the use of multiple Graph Attention Networks (GATs) for author name disambiguation. The academic network is represented as a heterogeneous graph, which is transformed into multiple homogeneous graphs based on meta-paths such as co-authorship and shared venues. Node features, including textual data from titles and abstracts, are processed with Word2Vec embeddings. GAT layers apply a multi-head attention mechanism to model the importance of neighboring nodes, and the resulting embeddings are fused using a fully connected layer. Clustering is performed using spectral clustering. Semantic Author Name Disambiguation with Word Embeddings:\nMüller, MC. (2017)  presents a supervised AND system that combines three models: co-author similarity, content similarity (using word embeddings for title matching), and metadata similarity. Each model is supervised, relying on labeled data for training. These models are integrated into a multi-layer neural network for final classification. For the clustering task, the system uses binary classifiers, adjusting the minimum positive confidence (mpc) threshold to control the precision and recall trade-off.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: features like co-authors, title words, year of publications and venue information, and the output is usually an author identifier/class.
