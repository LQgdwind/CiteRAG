Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

In contrast, the goal of grassroots cryptoeconomy  is to bootstrap a thriving trust-based and community-based cryptoeconomy without external capital or credit and without reliance on third-party computing services.\nThe proposed grassroots cryptoeconomic components include: Self-sovereign personal cryptocurrencies  can form the basis of grassroots economies, with community cryptocurrencies  as an emergent phenomena. A personal coin is best thought of as a transferable unit of credit issued by one person to another, and two people can establish a mutual line of credit between them  simply by exchanging their personal coins.\nLiquidity in a grassroots economy can be achieved via such mutual credit lines, forsaking initial capital or external credit. Fault-resilience and transaction-finality are provided by each agent regarding its own personal currency.\nSelf-sovereignty means that the responsibility for the economic and computational integrity of a personal currency resides with the person; as the value of a personal currency depends on such integrity, every person is incentivized to maintain them. Community banks/credit unions  may be realized as democratic DAOs, owned, operated and democratically-governed by their members. Such a bank may streamline liquidity and simplify payments within a grassroots cryptoeconomic community that employs personal cryptocurrencies. The bank issues its own currency and provides credit to its members at its discretion. It allows each member to deposit their personal coins and draw bank coins, up to the person’s credit limit, in return for the members accepting its coins, which becomes a community currency   .\nThe deposited personal coins are the bank’s collateral, and any agent may redeem bank coins, first to its own personal coins held by the bank and any remaining balance to other personal coins held by the bank.\nA community currency can achieve sybil-proofness via a stake-based web of trust [ref]45 , being an essential ingredient of the community formation process discussed in Section 3. The process relies on trust among agents, and requires an incentive mechanisms that backs up trust edges by mutual sureties , denominated in the community currency redeemed by the community if the trusted personal identifier is determined to be a sybil (via a due process specified by the community’s social contract). This may require community members who wish to invite others to the community to lend them coins or provide them credit in this currency, to finance the mutual surety. Universal Basic Income (UBI). External support to a community bank—governmental or philanthropic—can boost the liquidity of the community and allow the bank to provide community members with a growing credit line in community currency, akin to UBI    [ref]29  . Democratic social networks. Commercial social networks follow the Feudal model of governance, where the corporate chief executive embodies all three branches of government – legislative, executive, and judicial. Members have no civil rights and are meagerly-remunerated, if at all, for the exploitation of their digital capital (personal information) or labor (consuming ads and commercial content, creating engaging content). A democratic social network, realized as a democratic DAO,\ncan be members-owned and operated, have proper democratic governance, and share revenues among members based on their contribution. Sharing-economy digital cooperatives. The ethos of earthly cooperatives includes autonomy and democratic conduct. As such, democratic DAOs offer a natural embodiment for their digital counterparts: members’ owned, operated and governed digital cooperatives. In addition to digital cooperatives for social networks that offer a democratic and income-sharing alternative to Facebook, we envision a true sharing-economy drivers-and-passengers-owned cooperative that may offer a beneficial alternative to Uber, and a true sharing-economy owners-and-renters-owned cooperative that would be preferable to Airbnb. Research challenges: Developing the concept of a network of community-issued currencies, concentrating on issues of liquidity and interoperability, both theoretically and practically, using multiagent simulations. Validating the notion of personal currencies and its viability as an infrastructure for sureties, theoretically and practically.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: Mainstream cryptocurrencies—based on proof of work [ref]36  or stake —grant participants power and wealth in accordance with their capital investment, thus benefiting the few and exacerbating economic inequality.
