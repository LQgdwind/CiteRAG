      "content": "Paper Title: Spatiotemporal Self-attention Modeling with Temporal Patch Shift for Action Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSignificant progresses have been achieved for video based action recognition in recent years [ref]4 [ref]31   , largely driven by the development of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D-CNN) and their factorized versions, including I3D [ref]4, Slowfast , P3D [ref]31, TSM . With the recent success of transformer-based methods on image based tasks such as image classification, segmentation and detection      , researchers have been trying to duplicate the success of transformers on image based tasks to video based tasks  [ref]1 4. Specifically, videos are tokenized as 3D patches, then multi-head Self-Attention (SA) and Feed-Forward Networks (FFN) are utilized for spatiotemporal feature learning. However, the extra temporal dimension of video data largely increases the number of patches, which leads to an exponential explosion in computation and memory cost as the calculation of multi-head SA has a quadratic complexity. Previous efforts to reduce the computational burden of spatiotemporal multi-head SA are mainly focused on how to factorize it into spatial and temporal domains and compute them separately  [ref]1. For example, Timesformer  first applies spatial-only SA and then temporal-only SA in a transformer encoder. ViViT [ref]1 adds a few temporal-only transformer encoders after spatial-only encoders. However, these factorization methods will introduce additional parameters and computation for temporal SA calculation comparing to a spatial-only transformer network. With the above discussions, one interesting question is: Can we endow 2D transformers the capability of temporal SA modeling without additional parameters and computational cost? To answer this question, we propose a Temporal Patch Shift (TPS) method for efficient spatiotemporal SA feature learning. In TPS, specific mosaic patterns are designed for patch shifting along the temporal dimension. The TPS operation is placed before the SA layer. For each frame, part of its patches are replaced by patches from neighboring frames. Therefore, the current frame could contain information from patches in temporal domain, and the vanilla spatial SA module can be extended to a spatiotemporal one. It is worth noting that, although the spatiotemporal self-attention computed by TPS is sparse, the spatiotemporal receptive field can be naturally expanded as the TPS layers are stacked. A special case of TPS, where the patches from neighboring frames are shifted using a “Bayer filter”, is shown in the first row of Fig. 1. We highlight the patches that are being shifted. It can be seen that, by replacing half of the patches in the current frame with patches from previous and next frames, the vanilla spatial SA is upgraded to spatiotemporal SA with a temporal receptive filed of 3. In the second row of Fig. 1, we show two examples of visualization for consecutive frames after patch shift, which indicate the motion of actions can be well presented within a single frame. The contributions of this work are summarized as follows: We propose a Temporal Patch Shift (TPS) operator for efficient spatiotemporal SA modeling. TPS is a plug-and-play module and can be easily embedded into many existing 2D transformers without additional parameters and computation costs. We present a Patch Shift Transformer (PST) for action recognition by placing TPS before the multi-head SA layer of transformers. The resulted PST is highly cost-effective in both computation and memory. Extensive experiments on action recognition datasets show that TPS achieves 58.3%percent58.358.3\\%, 69.8%percent69.869.8\\%, 82.5%percent82.582.5\\% and 86.0%percent86.086.0\\% top-1 accuracy on Something-something V1 &\\& V2, Kinetics400 and Diving48, which are comparable to or better than the best Transformer models but with less computation and memory cost.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Significant progresses have been achieved for video based action recognition in recent years [ref]4 [ref]31   , largely driven by the development of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D-CNN) and their factorized versions, including I3D [ref]4, Slowfast , P3D [ref]31, TSM .
