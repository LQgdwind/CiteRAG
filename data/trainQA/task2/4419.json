      "content": "Paper Title: SSBNet: Improving Visual Recognition Efficiency by Adaptive Sampling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs)[ref]13 6  [ref]7 and Transformers have made unprecedented successes in computer vision. However, achieving efficient inference with stringent latency constraints in real-world applications is very challenging. To obtain a good trade-off between accuracy and latency, downsampling is normally used to reduce the number of operations. Most existing CNNs[ref]13 6  [ref]7 perform downsampling between stages, coupled with the increase in channel dimension to balance the representation power and computational cost. Typical downsampling operations include strided average/max pooling and convolutions [ref]13 6  [ref]7  , which are uniformly applied in the spatial dimension. Besides uniform sampling, there are also non-uniform or adaptive approaches      , with which different transformations including zooming, shifting, and deforming can be utilized to selectively focus on the important regions during downsampling. However, the use of adaptive sampling has been limited to certain layers and its application in backbone networks has not been well investigated. Backbone networks are usually pre-trained in some large scale datasets, which are agnostic to the end task like object detection . The challenge for applying adaptive sampling in backbone networks lies in the possible information loss. In particular, later layers cannot access pixels that were skipped by earlier layers, which is quite possible due to the stacking of sampling layers. Another approach to improve efficiency is to reduce the number of channels. In ResNet[ref]7, the bottleneck layers reduce the channel dimension by using a 1×1111\\times 1 convolution and then perform a costly 3×3333\\times 3 convolution on the low dimensional features to reduce computational complexity. After that, another 1×1111\\times 1 convolution is utilized to restore the dimension and match the shortcut connection. It is noteworthy that residual networks can preserve informative features after the bottleneck operations because the shortcut connection allows signal to bypass the bottleneck. The bottleneck structure with shortcut connection can be utilized to enable adaptive sampling on backbone networks. In this paper, we propose Saliency Sampling Bottleneck Network (SSBNet), which applies saliency sampler   in a bottleneck structure to reduce the spatial dimension before costly operations. An inverse operation is then used to restore the feature maps to match the spatial structure of the input that passes through the shortcut connection. Like other bottleneck structures, computationally expensive operations like convolution are applied in a very compact space to save computations. There are two major advantages for applying adaptive sampling over the bottleneck structure. First, by zooming into important regions, SSBNet can better extract features than uniform downsampling. More importantly, with the shortcut connection, each intermediate layer with adaptive sampling can focus on different regions of the feature maps in a very deep network, without loss of information. In the experiments, we built SSBNets by inserting lightweight convolutional layers and samplers into existing networks to estimate the saliency map and perform down/upsampling. The results in Figure 1 show that SSBNet can achieve better accuracy/FLOPS ratio than ResNet-RS and BoTNet-S15. For example,\nwith only 4.4% more FLOPS, the SSB-ResNet-RS-200 with input size of 256×256256256256\\times 256 achieved 82.6% accuracy on ImageNet dataset3, which is 0.6% higher than the baseline ResNet-RS-152 with input size of 192×192192192192\\times 192. The SSB-BoTNet-S1-77 with input size of 320×320320320320\\times 320 obtained 82.5% accuracy, which is 0.4% higher than BoTNet-S1-110 with input size of 224×224224224224\\times 224, and required 6% less computation.\nThe contributions of this paper include: We investigate the use of adaptive sampling in the building blocks of a deep neural network. By applying adaptive sampling in the bottleneck structure, we propose SSBNet which can be utilized as a backbone network and trained in an end-to-end manner. Note that existing networks only utilized adaptive sampling in specific tasks, where a pre-trained backbone is required for feature extraction. We show that the proposed SSBNet can achieve better image classification and object detection performance than the baseline models, and visualize its capability in adaptively sampling different locations at different layers. Experiment results and ablation studies validate the advantage of adaptive sampling over uniform sampling. The result in this paper may lead to a new direction of research on network architecture.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: Deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs)[ref]13 6  [ref]7 and Transformers have made unprecedented successes in computer vision.
