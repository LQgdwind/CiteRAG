      "content": "Paper Title: Emerging Threats in Deep Learning-Based Autonomous Driving: A Comprehensive Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe perception layer perceives and identifies things like object perceiving and identification, segmentation, depth estimation and localization, which are based on the vehicle’s state and road information collected by the sensors in the sensor layer. The commonly used techniques are given as follows, which include 2D object recognition, 3D object recognition, multi-modal fusion, trajectory prediction, and so on. 2D Objection Recognition is based on a flat image to identify the presence or absence of a specific target in the image and locate it. technologically, 2D object recognition can be divided into two classifications: two-stage objection recognition algorithms and one-stage objection recognition algorithms. The two-stage algorithms first find a series of region proposals, and then classify the objects in the proposals by Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN). Commonly used two-stage algorithms include FasterRCNN[ref]18 and MaskRCNN[ref]19 characterized by relatively high accuracy and high consumption. One-stage algorithms do not generate a separate region proposal but return to the predicted class and location of the target directly. Commonly used one-stage algorithms include: SSDand Yolo v3[ref]21. In 2017, Lin et al. proposed a new loss function - \"Focal Loss\", which can significantly improve the accuracy of dense target recognition, and this technique was first applied to the field of face recognition. It is now applied to many target recognition fields, among which, in 2021, Yosuke Shinya et al. proposed UniverseNet, a target detection algorithm that applies Focal Loss, which can achieve better results in dense target and small target scenarios. A detailed comparison of current mainstream 2D target recognition techniques can be found in references   Multi-Modal Fusion. A single type of sensor cannot capture all of the environmental information needed to support autonomous driving, while autonomous driving systems require information from several types and a large number of sensors to make integrated decisions, which leads us to make multi-modal fusion. Depending on occurred times, the fusion can be divided into three modes: pre-fusion, post-fusion, and deep fusion. Pre-fusion combines the data collected by all types of sensors and then makes a comprehensive decision. Post-fusion to make decisions on the data collected by different sensors and then aggregate the sub-decisions. Deep fusion constitute by the fusion of data, features and decision integration, and can be subdivided into five types: data in data out, data in feature out, feature in feature out, feature in decision out, and decision in decision out . An in-depth analysis and comparison of the various integration methods can be found in the literature.    3D Objection Detection and Segmentation. Because 2D images have no depth information that is needed in autonomous driving, such as path planning and collision avoidance in autonomous driving, therefore 3D objection detection plays a key role. Classified by the detected information, 3D target detection has 3 bases: 2D image, 3D point cloud map and multi-modal fusion image. Among them, 3D target detection based on 2D images often uses 3D target matching and depth estimation to estimate the 3D target bounding box for targets in 2D images using algorithms like Mono3D, 3DVP, Deepmanta, and SVGA-Net. 3D target recognition based on 3D point cloud maps is the recognition of targets in the images with 3D information and marks the target outline. Commonly used algorithms include: VeloFCN , BirdNet, 3DFCN , PointNet++ and VoxelNet. 3D target detection based on multi-modal integration images is to use different integration modes to identify 3D targets. Commonly used algorithms include: MV3D, AVOD, and F-PointNet. A comparison and in-depth study of various 3D target detection algorithms can be found in the literature . Other deep learning research directions in the perception layer include Pedestrian Detection, Lane Detection, Traffic Sign Recognition, Pedestrian Attribute Recognition, Fast Vehicle Detection, Pedestrian Density Estimation, Plate Recognition, etc. There is detail on the leaderboard.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: algorithms first find a series of region proposals, and then classify the objects in the proposals by Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN).

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
