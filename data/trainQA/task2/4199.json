      "content": "Paper Title: Rethinking Symbolic Regression Datasets and Benchmarks for Scientific Discovery\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent advances in machine learning (ML), especially deep learning, have led to the proposal of many methods that can reproduce the given data and make appropriate inferences on new inputs.\nSuch methods are, however, often black-box, which makes it difficult for humans to understand how they made predictions for given inputs.\nThis property will be more critical especially when non-ML experts apply ML to problems in their research domains such as physics and chemistry.\nSymbolic regression (SR) is the task of producing a mathematical expression (symbolic expression) that fits a given dataset.\nSR has been studied in the genetic programming (GP) community     [ref]5 , and deep learning-based SR methods have been attracting more attention from the machine learning community    0 1 2.\nBecause of its interpretability, various scientific communities apply SR to advance research in their scientific fields e.g., Physics 3 4 5 6 7 8 9, Applied Mechanics 0, Climatology 1, Materials 2 3 4 5, and Chemistry 6.\nGiven that SR has been studied in various communities, La Cava et al. 1 propose a benchmark framework for symbolic regression methods.\nIn the benchmark study, they combine the Feynman Symbolic Regression Database (FSRD) 4 and the ODE-Strogatz repository 7 and compare a number of SR methods, using a large-scale heterogeneous computing cluster.111Hosts with 24-28 core Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2690 v4 2.60GHz processors and 250GB RAM. To discuss the potential of symbolic regression for scientific discovery (SRSD), there still remain some issues to be addressed: oversimplified datasets and lack of evaluation metric towards SRSD.\nFor symbolic regression tasks, existing datasets consist of minimum necessary variables and values sampled from limited domains e.g., in range of 1 to 5, and there are no large-scale datasets with reasonably realistic values that capture the properties of the formula and its variables.\nThus, it is difficult to discuss the potential of symbolic regression for scientific discovery using such existing datasets.\nFor instance, the FSRD consists of 120 formulas selected mostly from Feynman Lectures Series222Udrescu and Tegmark 4 extract 20 of the 120 equations as “bonus” from other seminal books 8 9 0 1. 2 3 4 and are core benchmark datasets used in SRBench 1.\nWhile the formulas indicate physical laws, variables and constants in each dataset have no physical meanings since the datasets are not designed to discover the physical laws from the observed data in the real world.\n(See Section 3.1.) Moreover, there is a lack of appropriate metrics to evaluate these methods for SRSD.\nAn intuitive approach would be to measure the prediction error or correlation between the predicted values and the target values in the test data, as in standard regression problems.\nHowever, low prediction errors could be achieved even by complex models that differ from the original law.\nIn addition, SRBench 1 presents the percentage of agreement between the target and the estimated equations as solution rate.\nBut in such cases, both 1) equations that do not match at all and 2) that differ by only one term333If those differ by a constant or scalar, SRBench treats the estimated equation as correct for solution rate. are equally treated as incorrect.\nAs a result, it is considered as a coarse-resolution evaluation method for accuracy in SRSD, which still needs more discussion towards real-world applications.\nA key feature of SR is its interpretability, and some studies 5 1 use complexity of the predicted expression as an evaluation metric (the simpler the better).\nHowever, it is based on a big assumption that a simpler expression may be more likely to be a hidden law in the data (e.g., physical law), which may not be true for SRSD.\nTherefore, there are no single evaluation metrics proposed to take into account both the interpretability and how close to the true expression the estimated expression is. To address these issues, we propose new SRSD datasets, introduce a new evaluation method, and conduct benchmark experiments using various representative SR baseline methods.\nWe carefully review and design annotation policies for the new datasets, considering the properties of the physics formulas.\nBesides, given that a formula can be represented as a tree structure, we introduce a normalized edit distance on the tree structure to allow quantitative evaluation of predicted formulas that do not perfectly match the true formulas.\nUsing the proposed SRSD datasets and evaluation metric, we perform benchmark experiments with a set of SR baselines and find that there is still significant room for improvements in SRSD.\nBesides the datasets (Appendix A), we publish our code repository for reproducibility.444https://github.com/omron-sinicx/srsd-benchmark\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: regression (SR) is the task of producing a mathematical expression (symbolic expression) that fits a given dataset.\nSR has been studied in the genetic programming (GP) community     [ref]5 , and deep learning-based SR methods have been attracting more attention from the machine learning community    0 1 2.\nBecause of its interpretability, various scientific communities apply SR\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
