      "content": "Paper Title: Exploiting Global and Local Attentions for Heavy Rain Removal on Single Images\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEarly rain removal methods for single images utilized hand-crafted priors such as Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) , learning dictionaries and sparse architectures   . Moreover, Zhu et al.  proposed to compute the gradients in a local window to extract rainy regions, as rain streaks typically span in a narrow range of directions. The authors in  remove rain with the assumption that rain streaks have a similar direction for time interval. Although improving the overall scene, hand-crafted priors tended to generate artifacts such as blurring or distortion. In the deep learning era, learning-based methods [ref]4,5 , 4,5, 7,,  have shown dramatic improvements from labeled datasets. Fu et al. [ref]4 applied a low pass filter to decompose the rain image into two components, the base, and the detail parts, then utilized a ResNet for training their network to predict the detail component. Yang et al. 7 employed multiple dilated convolutions to remove rain. Moreover, Zang et al.  exploited a conditional GAN architecture, and perceptual loss 7 to train their model. Other authors have proposed using recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures to remove rain in multiple stages  4. These methods only achieve good results for light rain scenarios but fail to recover the background scene in heavy rain. Relatively, less effort has been made on heavy rain removal. Li et al. [ref]23 proposed a model to predict rain streaks, atmospheric light, and transmission maps, which are used to compute the initial clean image estimate. Additionally, Li et al. refined the initial clean image estimate using a generative adversarial network (GAN). Wang et al. 6 applied a model considering a transmission map of rain streaks and fog. These methods do not efficiently remove heavy rain as their models struggle to represent the complex relations between heavy rain and fog in the single images. Different from the existing methods [ref]23 1 6, we propose an end-to-end network to solve this problem. In this work, we do not aim to model relative streaks, atmospheric lights, and transmission maps independently. Instead, we separate the heavy rain scene into a clean component, additive, and multiplicative residue components, which can better model the heavy rain imagery. More details are described in the next section.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: direction for time interval.
