      "content": "Paper Title: Communication-Efficient Federated Learning for LEO Constellations Integrated with HAPs Using Hybrid NOMA-OFDM\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSatellite communication (SatCom) technology is considered a major player of the Internet of Remote Things (IoRT) . Recent advancements in SatCom have stimulated giant companies such as SpaceX, Amazon, and OneWeb, as well as government agencies such as ESA and NASA, to launch a large number of small satellites into space on low Earth orbits (LEOs) . These satellites are equipped with high-resolution cameras and collect massive satellite imagery . Meanwhile, the booming developments of AI have motivated the leverage of machine learning (ML) to perform satellite data analytics. However, traditional ML approaches which require downloading the massive imagery from satellites to a ground station (GS) are not practical due to the limited SatCom bandwidth. In this regard, federated Learning (FL) [ref]4  offers a potential solution as it replaces data transmission with model transmission, where each satellite trains an ML model onboard using its own data and then only sends the trained model to the GS. This substantially reduces the demand for bandwidth and gains the additional benefit of preserving data privacy. However, integrating FL with SatCom is non-trivial and involves significant challenges. This is because FL entails an iterative training process that typically involves hundreds of communication rounds between clients and the parameter server (𝒫​𝒮𝒫𝒮\\mathcal{PS}). While this is not a big issue in usual networks, it is a critical bottleneck in SatCom/LEO, where clients are LEO satellites and the 𝒫​𝒮𝒫𝒮\\mathcal{PS} is the GS, due to four factors. First, the highly sporadic, intermittent, and irregular connectivity pattern between LEO satellites and the GS. This is caused by the distinction of travel trajectories and speeds between LEO satellites and the 𝒫​𝒮𝒫𝒮\\mathcal{PS}, where satellites orbit the earth with an inclination angle between 0–90o while 𝒫​𝒮𝒫𝒮\\mathcal{PS} travels along the Earth rotation direction. Second, the long propagation and transmission delays in SatCom, due to the long distance and low data rate. Third, FL models are often large (e.g., 528/549MB for VGG16/19, 232MB for ResNet152, 479MB for EfficientNetV2L) because of the high image resolution and accuracy dictated by satellite applications such as national and homeland security, disaster and weather monitoring. Lastly, the wireless channels between LEO satellites and GS are unreliable due to adverse weather conditions like rain, fog, wind turbulence, and interference from other radio signals especially near the Earth’s surface. As a result, the short visible time window between a satellite and the 𝒫​𝒮𝒫𝒮\\mathcal{PS} is often insufficient to allow the complete transmission of a model, especially when multiple satellites’ transmissions are involved. Ultimately, the above challenges significantly impede the FL training process and result in slow convergence that takes days or even weeks  [ref]7. In this paper, we propose a novel FL-SatCom framework called NomaFedHAP that is tailored to LEO satellites to address the above challenges. First, it introduces non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) as a spectrum-efficient communication scheme into FL-SatCom to enable satellites at different orbit shells (hence different altitudes) to transmit models concurrently from/to the 𝒫​𝒮𝒫𝒮\\mathcal{PS}. Second, following our previous work , NomaFedHAP utilizes multiple high-altitude platforms (HAPs) in lieu of GSs to act as distributed 𝒫​𝒮𝒫𝒮\\mathcal{PS}s to improve satellite visibility. But unlike , NomaFedHAP introduces a new satellite-HAP communication topology in which each HAP also serves as a relay to forward models among HAPs. This has the benefit of handling multiple orbits of satellites without inter-orbit communication, thus avoiding significant Doppler shifts. Third, NomaFedHAP proposes an FL model aggregation scheme that optimally balances the number of models between different orbits and shells prior to model aggregation, thereby avoiding a biased global model. In summary, this paper makes the following contributions: To the best of our knowledge, NomaFedHAP is the first work that introduces NOMA to FL-SatCom, addressing the link budget limit and enabling concurrent transmissions of large FL models within short and sporadic visible windows. It also uses HAPs instead of GS as 𝒫​𝒮𝒫𝒮\\mathcal{PS} to achieve faster convergence. We propose to use orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for communication among satellites in the same orbit. This results in a hybrid NOMA-OFDM communication scheme. Furthermore, we derive a closed-form expression of the outage probability for satellites located in near and far orbit shells, as well as for the entire system. We also propose (i) a new satellite-HAP communication topology in substitution of the traditional star topology of FL, where we let HAPs act as inter-orbit relays to mitigate the Doppler shift, (ii) a new intra-orbit model propagation algorithm that utilizes inter-satellite links (ISL) and sub-orbital model aggregation to enable “straggler” satellites to participate in FL without waiting for their visible windows, and (iii) a new FL model aggregation scheme that optimally balances the number of models between different orbits to avoid a biased global model. We extensively evaluate NomaFedHAP using 3 common datasets and a real satellite dataset, and demonstrate its efficient bandwidth utilization and high data rate when transmitting FL models between satellites and HAPs. We also show that NomaFedHAP accelerates FL convergence by an order of magnitude as compared to state-of-the-art FL-SatCom algorithms (4 vs. 72 hours), while achieving the highest model accuracy.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: ML approaches which require downloading the massive imagery from satellites to a ground station (GS) are not practical due to the limited SatCom bandwidth.
