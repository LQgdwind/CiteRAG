Handling discrete words within textual content directly can pose a challenging task.\nTherefore, textual content information is commonly embedded into a low-dimensional space .\nThe goal is to learn a mapping function\nT:D‚ÜíX:ùëá‚Üíùê∑ùëãT:D\\to X,\nwhich generates a text embedding vector for each news item according to its corresponding textual content.\nA prevalent approach involves the utilization of the Word2Vec algorithm .\nIn this approach, individual words are represented as vectors and subsequently, the mean vector of all these words is adopted as the representation of the whole news article [ref]42.\nOur emphasis lies in detecting fake news disseminated through social networks, where there often exists a constraint on the word count within a single post.\nAs a result, the majority of news texts found on social networks are short texts.\nThe Word2Vec algorithm typically exhibits suboptimal performance within such scenarios .\nHence, we opt to utilize the Doc2Vec  approach,\nan improved version of Word2Vec, to generate initial news embedding vectors: where di‚ààDsubscriptùëëùëñùê∑d_{i}\\in D denotes textual content for news item iùëñi,\nxi‚ààRltsubscriptùë•ùëñsuperscriptùëÖsubscriptùëôùë°x_{i}\\in R^{l_{t}} denotes the text embedding vector for disubscriptùëëùëñd_{i}, and\nltsubscriptùëôùë°l_{t} denotes the length of text‚Äôs embedding vectors.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: the Word2Vec algorithm .\nIn this approach, individual words are represented as vectors and subsequently, the mean vector of all these words is adopted as the representation of the whole news article [ref]42.\nOur emphasis lies in detecting fake news disseminated through social networks, where there often exists a constraint on the word count within a single post.\nAs a result, the majority of news\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
