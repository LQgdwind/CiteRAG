      "content": "Paper Title: Faked Speech Detection with Zero Knowledge\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIt is important to know the difference between audio and speech.\nWhile an audio is a waveform data in which the amplitude changes with respect to time, speech is the oral communication [ref]3 and pertains to the act of speaking and expressing thoughts and emotions by sounds and gestures.\nThe human brain processes and analyses everything around to help the body with the right response or reaction and it does the same for the voices .\nTo be able to hear and process a voice, the inside of a human ear is equipped with small hair of various sizes; some are short and respond to resonate with low frequency voices while others are long that resonate with the high frequency voices.\nEach of these hair is connected to a nerve that carries a signal to the brain for processing . An audio signal is a representation of sound in function to the vibration of sound that is audible to human ear .\nAudio frequency  is the periodic variation of sound, with the human audible frequency being 20 Hz to 20 kHz .\nFor a machine, the processing of an audio is different from humans.\nIn order for the machine to get a sound it should have the needed devices that are able to record and save the audio in machine processable formats like the well-known mp3, WMA, WAV, or others. Features from speech signals can be broadly classified as temporal and spectral features. The temporal features are time domain features having simple physical interpretation and easy to compute. Examples are signal’s energy, maximum amplitude, zero crossing rate, minimum energy etc .\nThe spectral features, on the other hand, are frequency-based features that are extracted after passing the time domain signal to the frequency domain using Fourier or other similar transforms.\nExamples are frequency components, fundamental frequency, centroid, spectral flux, spectral density, roll-off etc .\nIn the context of audio signals such features may be helpful in the identification of pitch, notes, rhythm and melody etc. Spectrum and cepstrum are two important frequency-based concepts in audio processing. A spectrum is mathematically a Fourier transform of a signal which converts a time-domain signal into frequency domain , i.e. spectrum is the audio signal in frequency domain. A cepstrum is the log of the magnitude of the spectrum followed by an inverse Fourier transform. That’s why its domain is neither frequency nor the time; its domain is called quefrency . Cepstrum can be said of as a sequence of numbers that characterize a frame of speech . Since the Fourier transform is a linear operation, so is consequently the cepstrum; the spectrums of the wavelet and reflectivity series are additively combined in the cepstrum .\nFollowing are some important features  exploited in speech processing: Zero crossing rate: It indicates the number of times the value of the signal changes between positive and negative and vise versa.\nIt is also used to measure the noise in a signal, and it usually gives high value in case of a noisy signal . Spectral centroid: It is a feature based on frequency which indicates the location of the center of mass of the spectrum.\nIn audios it is known as a good predictor of “ brightness” of a sound . Spectral roll off: This feature is used to differentiate between the harmonic sound (below roll off) and the noise sound (above roll off).\nIt is known as the energy spectrum under a specific percentage that is defined by the used (85% by default) . Spectral bandwidth: The difference between the higher and lower frequencies in a group of continuous frequencies. Chroma: This representation for audio where the spectrum is divided onto 12 bins representing the 12 distinct semitones (or chroma) of the musical octave. Root Mean Square Energy (RMSE):  RMSE represents the energy of the signal, and shows how loud the signal is . Spectral flux: It measures how quick the power spectrum of a signal is changing, and it is calculated by comparing the changes of the power spectrum between one frame and the frame before it. Spectral density: It is the measure of signal’s power content against frequency . Cepstral Features:\nThese are, as stated above, quefrency domain features with the following being considered important: Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs  ): MFCCs are widely used features for speech recognition.\nThe Mel-frequency scale represents subjective or perceived pitch as its construction is based on pairwise comparisons of sinusoidal tones. The conversion between Hertz (f𝑓f) and Mel (m𝑚m) frequencies can be generalized as: MFCCs are obtained by applying a short time Fourier transform to window-based slices from the audio signal, followed by calculating the power spectrum and consequently filter banks (triangular in shape).\nThe filter bank coefficients are highly correlated and one way to de-correlate them is by applying a Discrete Cosine Transform DCT to get a compressed representation in the form of MFCC.\nTypically, MFCC 2-13 (i.e. 12 coefficients) are kept and the rest are discarded . Gammatone Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (GFCCs) [ref]23: used in a number of speech processing applications, such as speaker identification.\nA Gammatone filter bank approximates the impulse response of the auditory nerve fiber thus emulating human hearing and its shape can be likened to a Gamma function (e−2​π​(fc)​b​tsuperscript𝑒2𝜋subscript𝑓𝑐𝑏𝑡e^{-2\\pi(f_{c})bt}) modulating the tone (cos⁡(2​π​fc​t+ϕ)2𝜋subscript𝑓𝑐𝑡italic-ϕ\\cos(2\\pi f_{c}t+\\phi)) : Where a𝑎a is peak value, n𝑛n the order of the filter, b𝑏b the bandwidth, fcsubscript𝑓𝑐f_{c} the characteristic frequency and ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi is initial phase. fcsubscript𝑓𝑐f_{c} and b𝑏b can be derived from Equivalent Rectangular Bandwidth (ERB) scale, using the following equation [ref]25: For GFCC, FFT treated speech signal is multiplied by the Gammatone filter bank, reverted back by IFFT, noise is suppressed by decimating it to 100​H​z100𝐻𝑧100\\ Hz and rectified using a non-linear process. The rectification is carried out by applying a cubic root operation to the absolute valued input [ref]25. Approximately, first 22 features are called GFCC and these may be very useful in speaker identification. For a concise comparison on MFCC and GFCC, the reader can further consult [ref]23. Linear Prediction Cepstral Coefficients (LPCCs) and Linear Prediction Coefficients (LPCs) were the main features used in automatic speech recognition before MFCC specially with HMM classifiers . Some other important Cepstral features are Bark Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (BFCCs) and\nPower-Normalized Cepstral Coefficients (PNCCs).\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: It is important to know the difference between audio and speech.\nWhile an audio is a waveform data in which the amplitude changes with respect to time, speech is the oral communication [ref]3 and pertains to the act of speaking and expressing thoughts and emotions by sounds and gestures.\nThe human brain processes and analyses everything around to help the body with the right\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
