A common approach is comparing the performance of agents’ policies in the given task  or by studying how policy behaves . In addition to these explicit comparisons, RL and ES algorithms include implicit comparisons to encourage finding novel solutions [ref]29  [ref]12 , to match the behaviour of an expert policy   or to limit changes on policy’s behaviour to avoid catastrophic failure  . To facilitate such comparisons, behavioural characterizations (BCs) [ref]29 aim to capture policy’s behaviour in a fixed representation accompanied by a distance metric. A general BC could be used to generalize previously proposed methods  . However, BCs in the previous work are often domain-specific or depend on policy’s actions which are not descriptive of behaviour in general, as we will discuss in Section 3. Recent work attempted to generalize the notion of a behavioural embedding , considering policies as distributions over trajectories, and providing a principled mechanism to compare policies in the behavioural space. However, this approach relies on \\saybehavioural embedding mappings, which map trajectories to structures that are believed to describe the trajectory (e.g., reward-to-go, terminal state). It remains unclear how the choice of this mapping affects the results. In this work, we propose and evaluate a more general BC that can be applied to different domains. Our work provides the following contributions: (1) We summarize and compare BCs used in the previous work. (2) We discuss and demonstrate the shortcomings of action-based BCs which have been actively used in the previous work. (3) Propose a novel BC method based on which states the agent visits, borrowing techniques from the field of speaker recognition . (4) We use the proposed BC to study and visualize different training algorithms and also explore their use in novelty search [ref]29 and trust-region policy optimization .\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: While creating or training autonomous agents, whether it is via manual coding, reinforcement learning (RL)  or evolution strategy (ES) [ref]18 algorithms, one wishes to compare the solutions to find out which work and which do not.
