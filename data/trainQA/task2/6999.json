To enhance the scalability of score-based generative models, [ref]35 introduces a sliced score-matching objective that projects the scores onto random vectors before comparing them.\nSong et al. also introduce annealed training for denoising score matching , along with corresponding improved training techniques [ref]37. They also extend the discrete levels of annealed score matching to a continuous diffusion process and demonstrate promising results in image generation [ref]19.\nRecent works further explore the design choices of the diffusion process , maximum likelihood training , and deployment on the Riemann manifold . These recent advances show promising results when applying score-based generative models in high-dimensional domains and promote wide applications in various fields, such as object rearrangement , medical imaging , point cloud generation , scene graph generation , point cloud denoising , depth completion , and human pose estimation .\nThese works formulate perception problems into conditional generative modelling or inpainting, allowing the utilisation of score-based generative models to address these tasks. In contrast, our focus lies in the application of score-based generative models for training low-level control policies. In this domain,  and  have proposed learning diffusion models from offline trajectories and leveraging these models for model predictive control. However, these approaches suffer from the drawback of requiring a substantial amount of offline data and inefficiency during test-time sampling. To the best of our knowledge, our method represents the first exploration of score-based generative models for learning closed-loop dexterous grasping policies.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: gradient of the log-likelihood associated with given data distribution, the score-based generative model, originally introduced by , has garnered substantial attention in the research community   [ref]35  [ref]37 [ref]19 .\nThe denoising score-matching (DSM), as proposed by , further introduces a tractable surrogate objective for score-matching.
