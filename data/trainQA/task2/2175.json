      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Algorithms for Markovian Bandits: Is Posterior Sampling more Scalable than Optimism?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAfter obtaining upper bounds on the regret, a natural question is: can we do better? Or in other terms, does there exist a learning algorithm with a smaller regret? To answer this question, the metric used in the literature is the notion of minimax lower bound: for a given set of parameters (S,n,K,β)𝑆𝑛𝐾𝛽(S,n,K,\\beta), a minimax lower bound is a lower bound on the quantity\ninfℒsupMReg​(K,ℒ,M)subscriptinfimumℒsubscriptsupremum𝑀Reg𝐾ℒ𝑀\\inf_{\\mathcal{L}}\\sup_{M}\\mathrm{Reg}(K,\\mathcal{L},M), where the supremum is taken among all possible models that have parameters (S,n,K,β)𝑆𝑛𝐾𝛽(S,n,K,\\beta) and the infimum is taken over all possible learning algorithms. The next theorem provides a lower bound on the Bayesian regret. It is therefore stronger than a minimax bound for two reasons: First, the Bayesian regret is an average over models, which means that there exists at least one model that has a larger regret than the Bayesian lower bound; And second, in Theorem 5.2, we allow the algorithm to depend on the prior distribution ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi and to use this information. For any state size S𝑆S, number of arms n𝑛n, discount factor β𝛽\\beta and number of episodes K≥16​S𝐾16𝑆K\\geq 16S, there exists a prior distribution ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi on Markovian bandit problems with parameters (S,n,K,β)𝑆𝑛𝐾𝛽(S,n,K,\\beta) such that, for any learning algorithm ℒℒ\\mathcal{L}: The proof is given in Appendix 0.B and uses a counterexample inspired by the one of . Note that for general MDPs, the minimax lower bound obtained in   says that a learning algorithm cannot have a regret smaller than Ω​(S~​A~​T~)Ω~𝑆~𝐴~𝑇\\Omega\\big{(}\\sqrt{\\tilde{S}\\tilde{A}\\tilde{T}}\\big{)}, where S~~𝑆\\tilde{S} is the number of states of the MDP, A~~𝐴\\tilde{A} is the number of actions and T~~𝑇\\tilde{T} is the number of time steps.\nYet, the lower bound of   is not directly applicable to our case with S~=Sn~𝑆superscript𝑆𝑛\\tilde{S}=S^{n} because Markovian bandit problems are very specific instances of MDPs and this can be exploited by the learning algorithm.\nAlso note that this lower bound on the Bayesian regret is also a lower bound on the expected regret of any non-Bayesian algorithm for any MDP model M𝑀M. Apart from the logarithmic terms, the lower bound provided by Theorem 5.2 differs from the bound of Theorem 5.1 by a factor S/(1−β)𝑆1𝛽\\sqrt{S}/(1-\\beta). This factor is similar to the one observed for PSRL and UCRL2 [ref]28 . There are various factors that could explain this. We believe that the extra factor 1/(1−β)11𝛽1/(1-\\beta) might be half due to the episodic nature of MB-PSRL and MB-UCRL2 (when 1/(1−β)11𝛽1/(1-\\beta) is large, algorithms with internal episodic updates might have smaller regret) and half due to the fact that the lower bound of Theorem 5.2 is not optimal and could include a term 1/1−β11𝛽1/\\sqrt{1-\\beta} (similar to the term O​(D)𝑂𝐷O(\\sqrt{D}) of the lower bound of  ). The factor S𝑆\\sqrt{S} between our two bounds comes from our use of Weissman’s inequality. It might be possible that our regret bounds are not optimal with respect to this term although such an improvement cannot be obtained using the same approach as in .\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: terms, the lower bound provided by Theorem 5.2 differs from the bound of Theorem 5.1 by a factor S/(1−β)𝑆1𝛽\\sqrt{S}/(1-\\beta).
