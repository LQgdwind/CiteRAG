      "content": "Paper Title: gTLO: A Generalized and Non-linear Multi-Objective Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn many decision optimization problems, instead of a single objective, multiple objectives have to be optimized simultaneously. These problems can be formalized as multi-objective Markov decision processes  (MOMDPs) (S,A,P,ℛ,γ𝑆𝐴𝑃ℛ𝛾S,A,P,\\mathcal{R},\\gamma). Instead of scalar rewards, ℛ​(s,a,s′)ℛ𝑠𝑎superscript𝑠′\\mathcal{R}(s,a,s^{\\prime}) emits a reward vector 𝐫∈ℝI𝐫superscriptℝ𝐼\\mathbf{r}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{I}, where each component reflects one of the I𝐼I objectives. The system dynamics are described by Markov states s∈S𝑠𝑆s\\in S, actions a∈A𝑎𝐴a\\in A, and the transition probability function P𝑃P as in the standard MDP. In typical MOMDPs, the objectives are not in alignment, and instead of a single policy that solves the process, the optimal policy depends on the importance of each objective, according to the users, or the application-dependent preference. Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) methods differ in how these preferences are expressed. One can quantify the expected multi-objective return of each policy when starting in state s𝑠s on time step t𝑡t by defining a vector-valued multi-objective state-value function where for the considered case of finite-horizon MDPs all rewards are zero (𝐫=𝟎𝐫0\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{0}) after the end of the episode. When considering a finite-horizon MOMDP with a fixed starting-state s0subscript𝑠0s_{0}, the expected multi-objective return per episode is given by 𝐕π​(s0)subscript𝐕𝜋subscript𝑠0\\mathbf{V}_{\\pi}(s_{0}), which we denote by 𝐕πsubscript𝐕𝜋\\mathbf{V}_{\\pi}. Policies π𝜋\\pi that are optimal for any trade-off between the objectives are part of the so-called Pareto front. A policy π∈Π𝜋Π\\pi\\in\\Pi is part of the Pareto front if it is not dominated by any other policy π′∈Π∖πsuperscript𝜋′Π𝜋\\pi^{\\prime}\\in\\Pi\\setminus\\pi through the Pareto dominance relation (∀i:𝐕π′,i≥𝐕π,i)∧(∃i:𝐕π′,i>𝐕π,i)(\\forall i:\\mathbf{V}_{\\pi^{\\prime},i}\\geq\\mathbf{V}_{\\pi,i})\\land(\\exists i:\\mathbf{V}_{\\pi^{\\prime},i}>\\mathbf{V}_{\\pi,i}) for 1≤i≤I1𝑖𝐼1\\leq i\\leq I, where ΠΠ\\Pi is the set of executable policies. While various policies π𝜋\\pi on the Pareto front may have the same expected return value 𝐕πsubscript𝐕𝜋\\mathbf{V}_{\\pi}, one is typically only interested in a single policy per value. A so-called Pareto coverage set (PCS) as desired solution set, therefore, is a subset of the Pareto front and consists of one policy per undominated value . In MORL, preferences for I𝐼I objectives are often expressed by parameters 𝐰∈ℝI𝐰superscriptℝ𝐼\\mathbf{w}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{I} of a scalarization function f​(𝐫,𝐰)𝑓𝐫𝐰f(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{w}) and the goal is to maximize the scalarized expected return f​(𝐕π​(s),𝐰)𝑓subscript𝐕𝜋𝑠𝐰f\\big{(}\\mathbf{V}_{\\pi}(s),\\mathbf{w}\\big{)}. Due to its simplicity, usual choice for scalarization is the weighted sum which is additive\n(fs​(𝐫,𝐰)+fs​(𝐫′,𝐰)=fs​(𝐫+𝐫′,𝐰)subscript𝑓s𝐫𝐰subscript𝑓ssuperscript𝐫′𝐰subscript𝑓s𝐫superscript𝐫′𝐰f_{\\text{s}}(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{w})+f_{\\text{s}}(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime},\\mathbf{w})=f_{\\text{s}}(\\mathbf{r}+\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime},\\mathbf{w}))\nand the scalarized expected return (SER) equals the expected scalarized return (ESR) According to this property, linear scalarization is easily combine-able with conventional value-based reinforcement learning methods. In the most basic case, Q-learning can be used to learn the action-dependent ESR . Also, existing generalized MORL methods are based on linear scalarization. Generalization across preference-vectors 𝐰𝐰\\mathbf{w} is realized\neither by learning a generalized function of the expected scalarized return (ESR) 𝒬​(𝐬,a,𝐰,θ)≈Q𝐰​(s,ai)𝒬𝐬𝑎𝐰𝜃subscript𝑄𝐰𝑠subscript𝑎𝑖\\mathcal{Q}(\\mathbf{s},a,\\mathbf{w},\\theta)\\approx Q_{\\mathbf{w}}(s,a_{i}) [ref]9 , where Q𝐰subscript𝑄𝐰Q_{\\mathbf{w}} is the Q function for fs​(∙,𝐰)subscript𝑓s∙𝐰f_{\\text{s}}(\\bullet,\\mathbf{w}), or by learning a vector-valued Q-function 𝒬​⇐​∫​⇔​⊣​⇔​⊒​⇔​θ​⇒≈𝒬​⇐​∫​⇔​⊣​⇔​⊒​⇒𝒬⇐∫⇔⊣⇔⊒⇔𝜃⇒𝒬⇐∫⇔⊣⇔⊒⇒\\mathbfcal{Q}(\\mathbf{s},a,\\mathbf{w},\\theta)\\approx\\mathbf{Q}(s,a,\\mathbf{w}), where 𝐐​(s,a,𝐰)i𝐐subscript𝑠𝑎𝐰𝑖\\mathbf{Q}(s,a,\\mathbf{w})_{i} is the expected future reward for objective i𝑖i and preference 𝐰𝐰\\mathbf{w}, and scalarizing it (SER) for policy-extraction [ref]12 [ref]10. Policies that are optimal w.r.t. fssubscript𝑓sf_{\\text{s}} for any preference-vector 𝐰𝐰\\mathbf{w} form the convex coverage set (CCS), which is a subset of the Pareto coverage set  . The CCS includes only policies π𝜋\\pi, where the expected return 𝐕πsubscript𝐕𝜋\\mathbf{V}_{\\pi} is located in a convex region of the Pareto front. Consequently, linear MORL is limited to identifying PCS policies with expected returns in non-convex regions, and thereby incomplete 0 . This motivates the research of non-linear approaches. Unlike linear scalarization, non-linear scalarization functions are not additive and the scalarized expected return (SER) in general, differs from the expected scalarized return (ESR) 0 . The additivity of reward sequences is a basic assumption of the Bellman update. As this is not the case for sequences of non-linearly scalarized rewards, policies that are optimal under ESR learning, (i.e. following maxa⁡𝒬​(𝐬,a,𝐰,θ)subscript𝑎𝒬𝐬𝑎𝐰𝜃\\max_{a}\\mathcal{Q}(\\mathbf{s},a,\\mathbf{w},\\theta)), in general, differ from policies that are optimal under the SER criterion (i.e. following maxa⁡f​(𝒬​(𝐬,a,𝐰,θ))subscript𝑎𝑓𝒬𝐬𝑎𝐰𝜃\\max_{a}f\\big{(}\\mathbf{\\mathbfcal{Q}}(\\mathbf{s},a,\\mathbf{w},\\theta)\\big{)}). The objective in multi-objective optimization is typically to maximize the scalarized expected return (SER) f​(E​(s0))𝑓𝐸subscript𝑠0f(E(s_{0})) and to find the Pareto coverage set222There are cases in which the maximization of expected scalarized returns is more suitable . This case is covered in recent work 3..\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: by learning a generalized function of the expected scalarized return (ESR) 𝒬​(𝐬,a,𝐰,θ)≈Q𝐰​(s,ai)𝒬𝐬𝑎𝐰𝜃subscript𝑄𝐰𝑠subscript𝑎𝑖\\mathcal{Q}(\\mathbf{s},a,\\mathbf{w},\\theta)\\approx Q_{\\mathbf{w}}(s,a_{i}) [ref]9 , where Q𝐰subscript𝑄𝐰Q_{\\mathbf{w}} is the Q function for fs​(∙,𝐰)subscript𝑓s∙𝐰f_{\\text{s}}(\\bullet,\\mathbf{w}), or by learning a vector-valued Q-function\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
