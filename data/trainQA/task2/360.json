      "content": "Paper Title: Scalable Mining of Maximal Quasi-Cliques: An Algorithm-System Codesign Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGiven a degree threshold γ𝛾\\gamma and an undirected graph G𝐺G, a γ𝛾\\gamma-quasi-clique is a subgraph of G𝐺G, denoted by g=(Vg,Eg)𝑔subscript𝑉𝑔subscript𝐸𝑔g=(V_{g},E_{g}), where each vertex connects to at least ⌈γ⋅(|Vg|−1)⌉⋅𝛾subscript𝑉𝑔1\\lceil\\gamma\\cdot(|V_{g}|-1)\\rceil other vertices in g𝑔g. Quasi-clique is a natural generalization of clique that is useful in mining various networks, such as finding protein complexes or biologically relevant functional groups      , and social communities   that can correspond to cybercriminals , botnets   and spam/phishing email sources  . Mining maximal quasi-cliques is notoriously expensive  and the state-of-the-art algorithms  [ref]30  were only tested on small graphs. For example, Quick , the best among existing algorithms, was only tested on graphs with thousands of vertices . This has hampered its use in real applications involving big graphs. In this paper, we design parallel algorithms for mining maximal quasi-cliques that scale to big graphs. Our algorithms follow the idea of divide and conquer which partitions the problem of mining a big graph into tasks that mine smaller subgraphs for concurrent execution, which has been made possible recently by the G-thinker  framework for distributed graph mining that avoids the IO bottleneck for data movement that exists in other existing data-intensive systems. In fact, it is found that using conventional IO-bound data-intensive systems could result in a throughput comparable or even less than a single-threaded program  , making it a must to use a compute-intensive framework like G-thinker. However, we found that porting such a divide-and-conquer algorithm (hereafter called divisible algorithm for simplicity) directly to the current G-thinker implementation still leads to the straggler problem. This is because the state-of-the-art divisible algorithms for mining dense subgraphs such as quasi-cliques and k𝑘k-plexes  are much more difficult than the applications that G-thinker already implemented, such as maximum clique finding and triangle counting . Specifically,  showed that even the problem of detecting whether a given quasi-clique in a graph is maximal is NP-hard, while  showed that “(i) maximal k𝑘k-plexes are even more numerous than maximal cliques”, and that “(ii) the most efficient algorithms in the literature for computing maximal k𝑘k-plexes can only be used on small-size graphs”. Unlike those simpler problems considered in  where the runtimes of individual tasks are relatively short compared with the entire mining workloads, quasi-clique mining generates tasks of drastically different running time which was not sufficiently handled by the G-thinker engine. We remark that while the existing execution engine of G-thinker is insufficient, its graph-divisible computing paradigm is a perfect fit for dense subgraph mining problems, and all we need to do is to redesign G-thinker’s engine to address the straggler problem. After all, before G-thinker, such parallelization was not easy:  makes it a future work “Can the algorithms for quasi-cliques be parallelized effectively?”, while  indicated that “We are not aware of parallel techniques for implementing the all_plexes() sub-routine, and we leave this for future work”. Addressing the load balancing issue of G-thinker would not only benefit parallel quasi-clique mining, but also the parallelization of many other graph-divisible algorithms for mining dense subgraphs    7  6 . We adopt an algorithm-system codesign approach to parallelize quasi-clique mining, and the main contributions are as follows: We redesigned G-thinker’s execution engine to prioritize the execution of big tasks that tend to be stragglers. Specifically, we add a global task queue to keep big tasks which is shared by all mining threads in a machine for prioritized fetching; task stealing is used to balance big tasks among machines. We improved Quick by integrating new pruning rules that are highly effective, and fixing some missed boundary cases in Quick that could lead to missed results. The new algorithm, called Quick+, is then parallelized using G-thinker API. We achieve effective and early decomposition of big tasks by a novel timeout\nstrategy, without the need to predict task running time which is very difficult. The efficiency of our parallel solution has been extensively verified over various real graph datasets. For example, in our 16-node cluster, we are able to obtain 201×\\times speedup when mining 0.89-quasi-cliques on the Patent graph with 3.77M vertices and 16.5M edges in a 16-node cluster: the total serial mining time of 25,369 seconds are computed by our parallel solution in 126 seconds. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews those related work closely related to quasi-clique mining and graph computing time prediction. Section 3 formally defines our notations, the general divisible algorithmic framework for dense subgraph mining which is also adopted by Quick and our Quick+, and which is amenable to parallelization in G-thinker. Section 4 then demonstrates that the tasks of Quick+ can have drastically different running time, and describes the straggler problem that we faced.\nSection 5 then reviews the original execution engine of G-thinker and describes our redesign to prioritize big tasks for execution. Section 6 then outlines our Quick+ algorithm and Section 7 presents its adaptation on G-thinker as well as another version of it using\ntimeout-based task decomposition.\nFinally, Section 8 reports our experiments and Section 9 concludes this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: social communities   that can correspond to cybercriminals , botnets   and spam/phishing email sources  .
