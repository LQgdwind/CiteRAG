      "content": "Paper Title: BLIP-Diffusion: Pre-trained Subject Representation for Controllable Text-to-Image Generation and Editing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nText-to-image generation models have developed significantly and enabled creation of high-quality images based on textual prompts    [ref]6 .\nOne of their applications is subject-driven generation, which aims to render novel renditions of an input subject while preserving its appearance.\nThe common approach to subject-driven generation [ref]8 [ref]9   is through inverting subject visuals into text embedding space.\nSpecifically, with a pretrained text-to-image generation model, a placeholder text embedding is optimized to reconstruct a set of subject images.\nThe embedding is then composed into natural language prompts to create different subject renditions.\nOne known inefficiency of this approach is that it requires reiterating hundreds [ref]9  or thousands [ref]8 tedious fine-tuning steps for each new subject, which hinders it from efficiently scaling to a wide range of subjects. We attribute such inefficiency to the fact that most pre-trained text-to-image models do not natively support multimodal control - using both images and texts as control input.\nAs a result, it becomes challenging to learn subject representation that aligns with the text space while capturing the subject visuals with high fidelity.\nTo overcome these limitations, we introduce BLIP-Diffusion, the first subject-driven text-to-image generation model with pre-trained generic subject representation, which enables subject-driven generation in zero-shot or with few-step fine-tuning.\nOur model builds upon a vision-language encoder (i.e. BLIP-2 ) and a latent diffusion model [ref]6 (i.e. Stable Diffusion).\nThe BLIP-2 encoder takes as input the subject image and its category text; it produces text-aligned subject representation as output. We then infix the subject representation in the prompt embedding to guide the latent diffusion model for subject-driven image generation and editing. To enable controllable and high-fidelity generation,\nwe propose a new two-stage pre-training strategy to learn generic subject representation.\nIn the first pre-training stage, we perform multimodal representation learning, which enforces BLIP-2 to produce text-aligned visual features based on the input image.\nIn the second pre-training stage, we design a subject representation learning task where the diffusion model learns to generate novel subject renditions based on the input visual features.\nTo achieve this, we curate pairs of input-target images with the same subject appearing in different contexts.\nSpecifically, we synthesize input images by composing the subject with a random background.\nDuring pre-training, we feed the synthetic input image and the subject class label through BLIP-2 to obtain the multimodal embeddings as subject representation.\nThe subject representation is then combined with a text prompt to guide the generation of the target image.\n Benefiting from the pre-trained subject representation, BLIP-Diffusion achieves promising zero-shot subject-driven generation results and superior fine-tuning efficiency.\nFor example, BLIP-Diffusion takes 40-120 fine-tuning steps to specialize for a given subject, achieving up to 20x speedup compared to DreamBooth [ref]9.\nFurthermore, BLIP-Diffusion inherits behaviours of the constituent latent diffusion model and can be flexibly extended to support various subject-driven generative applications without further training.\nFollowing the prompt-to-prompt  approach, BLIP-Diffusion enables editing images with subject-specific visuals.\nWhen combined with ControlNet , it enables subject-driven generation with various additional structure control.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: Text-to-image generation models have developed significantly and enabled creation of high-quality images based on textual prompts    [ref]6 .\nOne of their applications is subject-driven generation, which aims to render novel renditions of an input subject while preserving its appearance.\nThe common approach to subject-driven\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
