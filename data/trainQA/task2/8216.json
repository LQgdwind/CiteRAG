      "content": "Paper Title: Parameterized Spanning Tree Congestion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur aim in this paper is to present a\nclarified and much more detailed picture of how the complexity of Spanning Tree Congestion depends\non treewidth and other notions of graph structure (see Figure 1\nfor a synopsis of our results). We begin our work by considering the natural open problem we mentioned above,\nnamely whether Spanning Tree Congestion is FPT parameterized by treewidth. We answer this\nquestion in the negative and indeed prove something much stronger: Let\n𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} be any class of graphs that satisfies the (very mild) requirement\nthat for each integer i𝑖i there exists a connected graph in 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} that\nhas i𝑖i vertices. Then, for any such class 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}, Spanning Tree Congestion is W-hard\nparameterized by the vertex deletion distance to a disjoint union of graphs\nbelonging to 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}. As a corollary, if we set 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} to be the\nclass of all stars, Spanning Tree Congestion is shown to be W-hard for parameter\nvertex-deletion distance to star-forest, hence also for parameter tree-depth\nplus feedback vertex set (and consequently also for treewidth). Alternatively,\nby setting 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} to be the class of all cliques, our proof establishes\nW-hardness parameterized by the cluster vertex deletion number, and more\nstrongly by the twin-cover of the input graph . With a\ncouple of modifications, we then show in LABEL:thm:hardness:modularwidth that\nSpanning Tree Congestion remains NP-complete even on graphs of modular-width at most 444 and\nlinear clique-width 333, improving over the previously mentioned hardness\nresult of Okamoto, Otachi, Uehara, and Uno for clique-width\n333 . Moving on, we consider the tractability of the problem in graphs of constant\ndegree. All previous NP-hardness\nresults   require at least one\nvertex of unbounded degree. However, assuming that the graph has bounded degree\nseems potentially algorithmically useful, as recent work by\nKolman [ref]42 shows that instances of polylogarithmic maximum\ndegree are amenable to a polynomial approximation algorithm of ratio o​(n)𝑜𝑛o(n)\n(this is non-trivial, as the best known ratio on general graphs is n/2𝑛2n/2,\ntrivially achieved by any spanning tree ).222A very recent work by Kolman  improves over this\nand presents a polynomial-time approximation algorithm of ratio 𝒪​(Δ⋅log3/2⁡n)𝒪⋅Δsuperscript32𝑛{\\cal O}(\\Delta\\cdot\\log^{3/2}n),\nwhere ΔΔ\\Delta denotes the maximum degree of the graph.\nOur next result is to answer an open question posed by Kolman [ref]42 and\nshow that the problem in fact remains NP-hard even on graphs of degree at most\n888 (Theorem 3.18). To this end, we make use of a novel gadget based on\ngrids, simulating the double-weighted edges introduced by Luu and\nChrobak . Coming back to treewidth, we recall that Bodlaender, Fomin, Golovach, Otachi,\nand van Leeuwen  showed that, when k𝑘k is\npart of the parameter, Spanning Tree Congestion is expressible in MSO2 logic, thus due to\nCourcelle’s theorem 7 fixed-parameter tractable by\ntw+ktw𝑘\\mathrm{tw}+k. We improve upon this by providing an explicit FPT algorithm of running\ntime (tw+k)𝒪​(tw)​n𝒪​(1)superscripttw𝑘𝒪twsuperscript𝑛𝒪1{(\\mathrm{tw}+k)}^{{\\cal O}(\\mathrm{tw})}n^{{\\cal O}(1)}. In addition to providing a concrete\nreasonable upper-bound on the running time (which cannot be done with\nCourcelle’s theorem), this explicit algorithm allows us to obtain two further\ninteresting extensions. First, using a technique introduced by\nLampis [ref]48, we develop an efficient FPT approximation scheme\n(FPT-AS) when parameterized solely by twtw\\mathrm{tw}, that is, a (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-approximate algorithm running in time\n(tw/ε)𝒪​(tw)​n𝒪​(1)superscripttw𝜀𝒪twsuperscript𝑛𝒪1{(\\mathrm{tw}/\\varepsilon)}^{{\\cal O}(\\mathrm{tw})}n^{{\\cal O}(1)}; notice that this is the best we can\nhope for in this setting, given the W-hardness following\nfrom Theorem 1. Second, using a win/win argument based on a\nresult of Gurski and Wanke , we lift our algorithm to also\nshow an explicit FPT algorithm for the more general parameter cw+kcw𝑘\\mathrm{cw}+k, where\ncwcw\\mathrm{cw} denotes the clique-width of the input graph. Finally, given all the previously mentioned hardness results, we next aim to\ndetermine which structural parameters do render the problem\nfixed-parameter tractable. As a consequence of Theorem 1, the\nproblem remains intractable even on very restricted (dense and sparse)\ngraph classes, we must therefore focus on parameters that evade this hardness\nresult. We consider three cases: First, the parameter “distance to clique” is\nnot covered by Theorem 1 because the graph obtained after\nremoving the deletion set has one component; we show in\nTheorem 5.38 that Spanning Tree Congestion is FPT in this case. Second, the\nparameter vertex integrity is not covered by Theorem 1, as all\ncomponents of the graph obtained after removing the deletion set have bounded\nsize; we show in LABEL:thm:vi that Spanning Tree Congestion is FPT in this case as well, via a\nreduction to an ILP with an FPT number of variables. Third, we consider the\nparameter feedback edge set, which also falls outside the scope of\nTheorem 1, and obtain an FPT algorithm with single-exponential\nparameter dependence for this case.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: previous NP-hardness\nresults   require at least one\nvertex of unbounded degree. However, assuming that the graph has bounded degree\nseems potentially algorithmically useful, as recent work by\nKolman [ref]42 shows that instances of polylogarithmic maximum\ndegree are amenable to a polynomial approximation algorithm of ratio o​(n)𝑜𝑛o(n)\n(this is non-trivial, as the best known ratio on general\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
