      "content": "Paper Title: NASiam: Efficient Representation Learning using Neural Architecture Search for Siamese Networks This work was performed using HPC resources from GENCI-IDRIS (Grant 20XX-AD011012644).\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep Learning (DL) has experienced rapid growth in the past few years. Two DL subfields have received much attention: Unsupervised Representation Learning and Automated Deep Learning (AutoDL). Unsupervised representation learning aims to make DL models learn strong representations from unlabeled data. This is especially useful when considering that data labeling is often a costly and laborious human-made process. One of the most common approaches to unsupervised visual representation learning is siamese networks [ref]1. Siamese networks consist of two weight-sharing branches (i.e., ”twins”) applied to two or more inputs. The output feature vectors of the two branches are compared to compute a loss (e.g., a \\saycontrastive loss). In the case of representation learning, the inputs are usually data augmentations of the same image, and the siamese networks seek to maximize the similarity between the output feature vectors of the two branches   [ref]4. On the other hand, AutoDL tries to remove the human factor from the DL pipeline. Architecture design is one part of this pipeline that has proven particularly relevant to automate. Most DL architectures are handcrafted and lack the certainty of an optimal solution   . Neural Architecture Search (NAS) aims to solve this issue by using a meta-learner to search for neural network architectures relevant to a given task (e.g., image classification, semantic segmentation, or object detection). NAS algorithms efficiently browse large search spaces that would prove challenging to navigate manually. The first NAS works used reinforcement learning [ref]8  or evolutionary methods   but proved particularly inefficient, with thousands of GPU days needed to obtain a competitive architecture (e.g., 2000 GPU days for NASNet [ref]8). Nowadays, most approaches use differentiable NAS    (i.e., gradient-based search process) as it requires far less computational resources and often yields better results. This article leverages differentiable NAS to discover encoder (projector) and predictor architectures (i.e., Multilayer Perceptrons) that enable backbone Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to efficiently learn strong representations from unlabeled data. To the extent of our knowledge, this is the first time that NAS has been applied to enhance the architecture of Siamese networks. Thus, we improved the performance of several siamese network frameworks such as SimSiam , SimCLR , or MoCo [ref]4, with an encoder-predictor pair discovered by a meta-learner inspired by DARTS , a popular differentiable NAS method. We dubbed our approach NASiam (\\sayNeural Architecture Search for Siamese Networks). We show that NASiam reaches competitive results on small-scale (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 ) and large-scale (ImageNet ) datasets.\nThus, Section III highlights our main following contributions: A novel way to design encoder/predictor pairs for siamese networks using differentiable neural architecture search. A novel search space specifically designed for the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) heads of encoder/predictor pairs. The rest of the article is structured as follows: Section II features a short survey on related differentiable NAS and siamese networks works. In Section III, the proposed method is presented. Section IV presents the results of different image classification experiments and showcases a discussion on the composition of the discovered encoder/predictor pair architectures, and Section V brings a conclusion to our work while giving some insights about future work.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: useful when considering that data labeling is often a costly and laborious human-made process.
