      "content": "Paper Title: PAC-Based Formal Verification for Out-of-Distribution Data Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDevelopments in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have led to their implementations in safety-critical fields like transport, healthcare and security. Autonomous vehicles, amongst other cyber physical systems (CPS), use ML within their detection and decision-making subsystems. A reason for this is that ML models like deep neural networks (DNN) can create lower dimensional representations of abstract data that can be utilized for various tasks . However, obstacles to widespread use are the lack of explainability regarding inner workings and the lack of guarantees on performance. The primary reason for this is the black-boxed nature of DNNs, which, due to the number of training parametres, make it difficult to provide safety assurances within the CPS context . The necessity of these are highlighted by the fact that the performance estimation formed during the training/testing phase of development may be different from the true performance of the system during deployment, oftentimes because of the existence of out-of-distribution (OOD) data that is unlikely to be present in the training phase . OOD data refers to data that exist outside of the scope of data the model is familiar with. That is, instances that are out of the distribution defined by the dataset used during the training phase . As it is impossible to account for all possible instances and states a system may encounter during the training phase, the system’s behaviour toward OOD instances cannot be anticipated accurately and can be especially undesirable in safety-critical tasks . For this reason, CPSs within safety-critical domains often contain subsystems dedicated to the detection and handling of OOD data 0. There have been a number of studies that present implementations and frameworks for solutions to this problem, such as novelty or outlier detection and various OOD classifiers that have been developed using in-distribution benchmark datasets . However, regardless of the algorithm used, an error-free OOD detection system is infeasible. Therefore, it is necessary to be able to guarantee the probability with which detection is conducted, especially in safety-critical tasks; i.e. to evaluate and bound the rate with which the subsystem fails to detect OOD instances. An obstacle toward deriving general error bounds for OOD detection is the difficulty in characterizing the OOD aspect of high-dimensional data instances with respect to in-distribution properties [ref]3. That is, it is difficult to check if any properties of an instance are outside ‘normal’ parameters for high-dimensional data as the properties over which data is distributed, especially in image-based CPS, can be abstract [ref]3. As a result, creating definite, explainable constraints using in-distribution properties to evaluate whether instances are OOD, and thereby, bound the system’s performance, is difficult. A solution to this, utilized in systems described by , 0 and , is to use variational autoencoders (VAE) to parametrize the training data distribution with a fixed number of variables. VAEs are a class of DNNs that map high-dimension input data to lower-dimensional distributions that comprise latent spaces within the model. This results in the encoding of the distribution of training data to lower-dimension multivariate distributions. Studies have made use of this property in designing OOD detection systems by attempting to equate OOD instances with outliers in the latent space 0 and constructing classifiers to define in-distribution safety constraints within this space . As such, the objective of this study is to create a framework for guaranteeing and bounding OOD detection failure. The approach described in this study relies on the construction of constraints within the latent space that are used to define an in-distribution criteria for high-dimension data using the spatial coordinates of the encoding. Similar to 0, the constraints within this study are constructed using conformity-based classification based on a subset of known in-distribution data. Sampling the VAE latent distribution to find violations of these constraints allows for the construction of bounds on the error with which the system conducts OOD detection. The guarantees on error provided in this study are through probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds. Two probabilistic measures are used to characterize the guarantee: the error level, ϵ∈(0,1)italic-ϵ01\\epsilon\\in(0,1) and the confidence level, δ∈(0,1)𝛿01\\delta\\in(0,1). Through the sufficient sampling of the multivariate latent distribution, the approach provided in this study establishes that with a 1−δ1𝛿1-\\delta confidence, the probability of OOD detection failure is less than ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon. The correlation between sampling, constraint violation and confidence is used to bound the error probabilistically and provide an estimate of the performance of the system. The structure of the remaining report will consist of a clarification of the assumptions made as well as the limitations of this study, the relevant works upon which this study is based, the theoretical approach taken and the results acquired from applying the theory.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: An obstacle toward deriving general error bounds for OOD detection is the difficulty in characterizing the OOD aspect of high-dimensional data instances with respect to in-distribution properties [ref]3.
