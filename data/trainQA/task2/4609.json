      "content": "Paper Title: Prerequisite-driven Q-matrix Refinement for Learner Knowledge Assessment: A Case Study in Online Learning Context\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLKA is to obtain learner knowledge states based on the learners’ explicit learning feedback on various types of learning materials, such as the exercises and video lectures [ref]32  . In this paper, we focus on the learner knowledge assessment by utilizing their performance on exercises, which can be interpreted as an explicit indication of their implicit knowledge. Based on the application context, existing work can be divided into two categories: static LKA for testing and dynamic LKA for learning. Static LKA, also termed as Cognitive Diagnostic Assessment (CDA), is usually conducted after a summative test through some diagnostic models. This topic has been widely explored by researchers in the fields of psychometrics and data mining. IRT  and DINA 0 are two of the most renowned models in this category. IRT diagnoses a learner’s knowledge proficiency using a unidimensional variable (i.e., latent trait). The DINA model 0 describes each learner’s proficiency level using a binary vector. Unlike IRT, the DINA model must infer this multidimensional vector using the Q-matrix.\nMeanwhile, data mining researchers mainly conduct this task using Matrix factorization (MF) 3 .\nAs these methods do not consider the temporal factor of learning, it is difficult to be directly applied to the online learning context. Dynamic LKA, also known as Knowledge Tracing (KT), models the learner performance from a long period and traces the learners’ knowledge over time utilizing the temporal factor of learning in ITSs     .\nThe existing KT methods can be generally divided into three main categories: probabilistic models, factor analysis models and the deep learning models [ref]32 .\nBayesian knowledge tracing (BKT) , a typical probabilistic model, used the hidden Markov model to separately track the learner proficiency on each skill. Factor-analysis models, such as the additive factor model (AFM)  and performance factor analysis (PFA) , pre-define a delicate model framework and assign the considered factors as model parameters, which are learned from the data to generalize the observations. A famous study employed a knowledge tracing machine (KTM) based on the factorization machine, providing a generic framework for incorporating learning-related side information into a student model . Further researches was conducted recently based on the KTM, for example the DAS3H (item Difficulty, student Ability, Skill, and Student Skill practice History) [ref]6 and RKTM (recurrent KTM)  by enriching the KTM with additional information.\nDeep learning based models are now popularly used for the KT task and show significant improvements in model performance over traditional models. Typical researches in this direction are DKT , DKVMN  and AKT 5.\nHowever, in most of these models, the KT is based on the skills in a specific domain. Such skill-level KT models do not distinguish questions containing the same skills. The loss of distinctive information related to the questions may lead to imprecise inferences of the learners’ knowledge states. Moreover, almost all of these models simply assume that all questions and skills are independent, which is unrealistic in the actual learning process. The relations between questions and skills have been considered in various graph-based KT models   9 . Liu et al.  built a question–skill bipartite graph based on the Q-matrix in the domain and pre-trained the question and skill embedding in the graph using three constraints of explicit question–skill relations and implicit relations of skill similarity and question similarity. As the dense embeddings of questions and skills contain the relations in the graph, the pre-trained embedding-fed KT model outperforms the baseline models. Yang et al.  proposed the GIKT model and incorporated the question–skill correlations via embedding propagation on the question–skill relation graph using a graph convolutional network (GCN).\nTong et al. 9 introduced problem schema with a hierarchical exercise graph to KT. The problem schema clustered similar exercises into the same group to incorporate the question–question relations. Pandey et al.  calculated the exercise–exercise relations based on the performance data and the exercise text, and incorporated it into a transformer model for relation-aware KT.\nAll of these methods exploit the relation information in various graphs and introduce the distinctive information of questions into the KT task. However, they ignore the prerequisite information of the skills in the domain. Similarly to our work, Nakagawa et al.  and Chen et al.  incorporated the KG information into the KT procedure. Chen et al.’s work assumes that the KG is already given by experts, and models the prerequisite as an ordering pair. In this way, the mastery of related skills is constrained by referring to the KG. Nakagawa et al. used the KG\ninformation and a graph neural network (GNN) to update the learners’ hidden knowledge states. Unlike these earlier works, our method learns the prerequisites from learner response data to build the KG automatically, and integrates it to refine the Q-matrix to build a KG-enhanced relation graph. Leveraging the Metapath2Vec method, we learn the dense embeddings of all nodes, which incorporate the multi-hop question–question, question-skill, and skill–skill relations in the domain.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: LKA is to obtain learner knowledge states based on the learners’ explicit learning feedback on various types of learning materials, such as the exercises and video lectures [ref]32  .
