      "content": "Paper Title: Hybrid Search for Efficient Planning with Completeness Guarantees\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe main objective of our experiments is to evaluate whether the proposed complete search algorithm HIPS-ε𝜀\\varepsilon can be combined with an existing subgoal search algorithm, HIPS [ref]18, to improve its performance in environments that require long-term planning and complex, object-based relational reasoning. We also analyze the sensitivity of HIPS-ε𝜀\\varepsilon to the hyperparameter ε𝜀\\varepsilon and the impact of the novel heuristic factor and the corresponding PHS* evaluation function (4). The OOD-generalization abilities of HIPS-ε𝜀\\varepsilon are also discussed. We use the four environments considered in [ref]18: Box-World 4, Sliding Tile Puzzle , Gym-Sokoban  and Travelling Salesman (see Fig. 2). We implement HIPS-ε𝜀\\varepsilon\nas proposed in (2) and the policy πBC​(a|s)subscript𝜋BCconditional𝑎𝑠\\pi_{\\text{BC}}(a|s) as a ResNet-based network  and train it using Adam .\nWe use the implementation of HIPS from the original paper and use PHS* (or our complete variant thereof) as the search algorithm for HIPS and HIPS-ε𝜀\\varepsilon. In [ref]18, HIPS was evaluated with GBFS and A* on some environments. HIPS-ε𝜀\\varepsilon experiments with these search algorithms can be found in Appendix F. We use the versions of HIPS-ε𝜀\\varepsilon and HIPS that have access to the environment dynamics (named HIPS-env in [ref]18) unless stated otherwise. In Table 1, we report the proportion of solved puzzles as a function of the number of expanded nodes for the low-level search PHS*, high-level search algorithms HIPS [ref]18, kSubS , and AdaSubS 5, and our HIPS-ε𝜀\\varepsilon, which is HIPS enhanced with the proposed complete subgoal search. We used the kSubS and AdaSubS results from [ref]18 where they were not evaluated on Box-World. The results show that high-level search alone does not guarantee completeness, which means that for some puzzles the solution is not found even without a limit on the number of expanded nodes (N=∞𝑁N=\\infty) due to the generator failing to propose subgoals that lead to a valid terminal state, a phenomenon observed in prior work  [ref]18 5. As expected, HIPS-ε𝜀\\varepsilon achieves a 100% success rate in all environments thanks to augmenting the subgoals with low-level actions. In addition to the number of search node expansions, we analyzed the search cost in terms of wall-clock time and environment steps. HIPS-ε𝜀\\varepsilon generally outperforms the baselines also using these metrics. The results of these experiments can be found in Appendices J and K. We also evaluated HIPS-ε𝜀\\varepsilon on Sokoban, STP, and TSP with learned transition models and compared it to HIPS with learned models, behavioral cloning (BC), Conservative Q-learning [CQL, 19], and Decision Transformer [DT, 3]. We omitted Box-World due to HIPS struggling with the learned dynamics [ref]18. The results are shown in Table 2. HIPS-ε𝜀\\varepsilon outperforms the baselines but can fail to find a solution to a solvable problem instance due to the learned dynamics model sometimes outputting incorrect transitions. Completeness can be attained by using the true dynamics for validating solutions and simulating low-level actions, while still minimizing the number of environment steps (see Appendix E). For complete results with confidence intervals, please see Appendix G. Interestingly, the results in Table 1 show that augmenting the high-level search with low-level actions may have a positive impact on the performance for the same budget of node expansions N𝑁N: we observe statistically significantly increased success rates for the same N𝑁N in all environments except in the Travelling Salesman, where the results are approximately equal.\nNext, we analyze whether the increased number of solved puzzles is only because of the high-level search failing to find a solution to some puzzles.\nIn Table 3, we consider the Sliding Tile Puzzle problem and report the same results as in Table 1 considering only the puzzles solvable by HIPS. The results suggest that the complete search can speed up finding a correct solution. In Fig. 3, we analyze the effect of the hyperparameter ε𝜀\\varepsilon on the number of solved puzzles. We report the ratio of the number of unsolved puzzles by HIPS-ε𝜀\\varepsilon to the number of unsolved puzzles by HIPS as a function of N𝑁N, the number of node expansions. We observe that\nHIPS-ε𝜀\\varepsilon outperforms HIPS in all environments except TSP, and extensive hyperparameter tuning to select a good value of ε𝜀\\varepsilon is rarely necessary. The plots also support our hypothesis about a small value of ε𝜀\\varepsilon being often better despite the worse worst-case performance, as ε=10−3𝜀superscript103\\varepsilon=10^{-3} is often superior to ε=0.1𝜀0.1\\varepsilon=0.1. The augmented search strategy suggested by Zawalski et al. 5 (which we denote as ε→0→𝜀0\\varepsilon\\to 0) is sometimes but not always the best strategy. We analyze the impact of the value of ε𝜀\\varepsilon in Appendix I.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: The main objective of our experiments is to evaluate whether the proposed complete search algorithm HIPS-ε𝜀\\varepsilon can be combined with an existing subgoal search algorithm, HIPS [ref]18, to improve its performance in environments that require long-term planning and complex, object-based relational reasoning.
