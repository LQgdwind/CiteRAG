      "content": "Paper Title: The Complexity of the Hausdorff Distance\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis section is devoted to show the following Theorem. Hausdorff and Directed Hausdorff are contained in ∀∃<ℝfor-allsubscriptℝ\\forall\\exists_{<}\\mathbb{R}. Note that ∀∃ℝfor-allℝ\\forall\\exists\\mathbb{R}-membership is already shown by Dobbins et al. .\nThe remainder of this section deals with reformulating a given Hausdorff instance into a Strict-UETR instance, thereby proving ∀∃<ℝfor-allsubscriptℝ\\forall\\exists_{<}\\mathbb{R}-membership. Let (A,B,t)𝐴𝐵𝑡(A,B,t) be a Hausdorff instance, where A={x∈ℝn∣φA​(x)}𝐴conditional-set𝑥superscriptℝ𝑛subscript𝜑𝐴𝑥A=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\mid\\varphi_{A}(x)\\} and B={x∈ℝn∣φB​(x)}𝐵conditional-set𝑥superscriptℝ𝑛subscript𝜑𝐵𝑥B=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\mid\\varphi_{B}(x)\\} are described by quantifier-free formulas φAsubscript𝜑𝐴\\varphi_{A} and φBsubscript𝜑𝐵\\varphi_{B} with n𝑛n free variables each.\nFor simplicity, we only consider the directed Hausdorff distance here, namely the question whether It is obvious, that dH​(A,B)≤tsubscript𝑑H𝐴𝐵𝑡d_{\\mathrm{H}}(A,B)\\leq t if and only if d→H​(A,B)≤tsubscript→𝑑H𝐴𝐵𝑡\\vec{d}_{\\mathrm{H}}(A,B)\\leq t and d→H​(B,A)≤tsubscript→𝑑H𝐵𝐴𝑡\\vec{d}_{\\mathrm{H}}(B,A)\\leq t.\nSo if we can formulate the decision problem for the directed Hausdorff distance as a Strict-UETR instance, their conjunction is a formula for the general Hausdorff problem.\nAssuming that no variable name appears in both operands of this conjunction, this formula can be converted into prenex normal form by just moving the quantifiers to the front. From the definition we get that d→H​(A,B)≤tsubscript→𝑑H𝐴𝐵𝑡\\vec{d}_{\\mathrm{H}}(A,B)\\leq t is equivalent to Let us remark that introducing the real variable ε𝜀\\varepsilon is necessary to also consider the points in the closure of B𝐵B.\nMoreover, we work with the squared distance between a𝑎a and b𝑏b, because ∥a−b∥delimited-∥∥𝑎𝑏\\lVert a-b\\rVert is the square root of a polynomial. Below we transform formula (10) in multiple technical steps into a form that allows us to apply a recent theorem by D’Costa et al. [ref]26 such that ∀∃<ℝfor-allsubscriptℝ\\forall\\exists_{<}\\mathbb{R}-membership follows.\nBefore we do so, we state a few helpful lemmas.\nThese allow us to consider some of the intermediate steps in isolation, thereby simplifying the needed notation.\nAlso, Lemma 6.6 below is used again in Section 7. The first Lemma allows us to transform a UETR instance of special structure into an equivalent Strict-UETR instance: Given a UETR instance where φ<​(X,Y)∈QFF<subscript𝜑𝑋𝑌subscriptQFF\\varphi_{<}(X,Y)\\in{\\mathrm{QFF_{<}}} and H:[−1,1]n+m→ℝ:𝐻→superscript11𝑛𝑚ℝH:[-1,1]^{n+m}\\to\\mathbb{R} is a polynomial.\nThen we can compute in polynomial time an equivalent Strict-UETR instance. We first prove that there exists an integer N≤\\poly​(|Φ|)𝑁\\polyΦN\\leq\\poly(\\lvert\\Phi\\rvert), such that the Strict-UETR instance is equivalent to ΦΦ\\Phi.\nIn a second step, we construct 2−2Nsuperscript2superscript2𝑁\\cramped{2^{-2^{N}}} inside the formula. The direction Φ⟹ΨΦΨ\\Phi\\implies\\Psi is trivially true for any N∈ℕ𝑁ℕN\\in\\mathbb{N}.\nTo prove the other direction, we show its contraposition ¬Φ⟹¬ΨΦΨ\\neg\\Phi\\implies\\neg\\Psi.\nAssume that is true.\nHence for at least one fixed x∈[−1,1]n𝑥superscript11𝑛x\\in[-1,1]^{n} we obtain a polynomial H​(x,Y)2𝐻superscript𝑥𝑌2H(x,Y)^{2} that is positive everywhere on [−1,1]msuperscript11𝑚[-1,1]^{m} (the fixed x𝑥x values are real coefficients for the variables Y𝑌Y).\nBecause [−1,1]msuperscript11𝑚[-1,1]^{m} is compact and because polynomials are continuous, H​(x,Y)2𝐻superscript𝑥𝑌2H(x,Y)^{2} attains its minimum over [−1,1]msuperscript11𝑚[-1,1]^{m} and it follows that is true.\nLet L𝐿L be the length of the quantifier-free part in (11).\nBy Lemma 3.5 there is a constant β∈ℝ𝛽ℝ\\beta\\in\\mathbb{R} such that ∃ε>0𝜀0\\exists\\varepsilon>0 in (11) can be strengthened to ∃ε≥2−Lβ4​n​m𝜀superscript2superscript𝐿superscript𝛽4𝑛𝑚\\exists\\varepsilon\\geq\\cramped{2^{-L^{\\beta^{4}nm}}}.\nNow choose N=⌈β4​n​m⌉𝑁superscript𝛽4𝑛𝑚N=\\bigl{\\lceil}\\beta^{4}nm\\bigr{\\rceil} to be the smallest integer satisfying 2−2N<2−Lβ4​n​msuperscript2superscript2𝑁superscript2superscript𝐿superscript𝛽4𝑛𝑚\\cramped{2^{-2^{N}}}<\\cramped{2^{-L^{\\beta^{4}nm}}}.\nNote that N≤\\poly​(n,m,log⁡L)𝑁\\poly𝑛𝑚𝐿N\\leq\\poly(n,m,\\log L), so it is polynomial in the input size.\nPlugging in the lower bound on ε𝜀\\varepsilon, we get that ¬ΦΦ\\neg\\Phi is equivalent to which is exactly ¬ΨΨ\\neg\\Psi.\nWe conclude that Φ≡ΨΦΨ\\Phi\\equiv\\Psi as claimed. To construct a Strict-UETR instance from ΨΨ\\Psi, we need to express 2−2Nsuperscript2superscript2𝑁\\cramped{2^{-2^{N}}} inside the formula.\nTo this end, introduce N+1𝑁1N+1 new variables U=(U0,…,UN)∈[−1,1]N+1𝑈subscript𝑈0…subscript𝑈𝑁superscript11𝑁1U=(U_{0},\\ldots,U_{N})\\in[-1,1]^{N+1} and let χ​(U)𝜒𝑈\\chi(U) be formula (2).\nRecall that by Lemma 3.7, χ​(u)𝜒𝑢\\chi(u) is true if and only if ui=2−2isubscript𝑢𝑖superscript2superscript2𝑖u_{i}=\\cramped{2^{-2^{i}}}.\nIncluding χ​(U)𝜒𝑈\\chi(U) into our formula, we conclude that is equivalent to ΦΦ\\Phi. We arrived at a sentence where all variables are restricted to [−1,1]11[-1,1] and in which all atoms are strict.\nAt this point we use a recent result by D’Costa et al. [ref]26.\nThey show that it is ∃∀≤ℝsubscriptfor-allℝ\\exists\\forall_{\\leq}\\mathbb{R}-complete to decide a sentence of the form with φ≤∈QFF≤subscript𝜑subscriptQFF\\varphi_{\\leq}\\in{\\mathrm{QFF_{\\leq}}}.\nBecause ∃∀≤ℝ=\\co​∀∃<ℝsubscriptfor-allℝ\\cofor-allsubscriptℝ{\\exists\\forall_{\\leq}\\mathbb{R}}=\\co{\\forall\\exists_{<}\\mathbb{R}}, deciding the complements of these sentences, i.e., sentences of the form with φ<∈QFF<subscript𝜑subscriptQFF\\varphi_{<}\\in{\\mathrm{QFF_{<}}} is ∀∃<ℝfor-allsubscriptℝ\\forall\\exists_{<}\\mathbb{R}-complete.\nSentence (12) is of this form.\nThus there is a polynomial-time reduction to an equivalent Strict-UETR instance. The next lemma establishes an upper bound on the value of a polynomial over a compact domain. Let P:ℝn→ℝ:𝑃→superscriptℝ𝑛ℝP:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\to\\mathbb{R} be a polynomial, N𝑁N be an integer and C:=22Nassign𝐶superscript2superscript2𝑁C:=\\cramped{2^{2^{N}}}.\nThen we can compute in polynomial time an integer K≤\\poly​(|P|,N,n)𝐾\\poly𝑃𝑁𝑛K\\leq\\poly(\\lvert P\\rvert,N,n) such that for E:=22Kassign𝐸superscript2superscript2𝐾E:=\\cramped{2^{2^{K}}} and all x∈[−C,C]n𝑥superscript𝐶𝐶𝑛x\\in[-C,C]^{n} it holds that |P​(x)|≤E𝑃𝑥𝐸\\lvert P(x)\\rvert\\leq E. Because P𝑃P is a polynomial, |P|𝑃\\lvert P\\rvert is continuous and therefore |P|𝑃\\lvert P\\rvert attains its maximum over any compact domain.\nWe conclude that is true.\nNote that, strictly speaking, we may not use |⋅|⋅\\lvert\\cdot\\rvert inside the formula.\nHowever, |P​(X)|≤E𝑃𝑋𝐸\\lvert P(X)\\rvert\\leq E is equivalent to P(X)≤E∧−P(X)≤EP(X)\\leq E\\land-P(X)\\leq E. To obtain an upper bound on E𝐸E, we first need to encode C𝐶C inside the formula.\nWe introduce N+1𝑁1N+1 new variables U={U0,…,UN}𝑈subscript𝑈0…subscript𝑈𝑁U=\\{U_{0},\\ldots,U_{N}\\} and let χ​(U)𝜒𝑈\\chi(U) be formula (2).\nRecall that by Lemma 3.7, χ​(u)𝜒𝑢\\chi(u) is true if and only if ui=2−2isubscript𝑢𝑖superscript2superscript2𝑖u_{i}=\\cramped{2^{-2^{i}}}.\nNow we can rewrite the above formula equivalently as Let φ​(E)𝜑𝐸\\varphi(E) be the subformula following the quantification of E𝐸E (starting from ∀for-all\\forall) and L:=|φ​(E)|assign𝐿𝜑𝐸L:=\\lvert\\varphi(E)\\rvert.\nApplying quantifier elimination (Corollary 3.2) to φ​(E)𝜑𝐸\\varphi(E), we obtain a constant α∈ℝ𝛼ℝ\\alpha\\in\\mathbb{R} and an equivalent, quantifier-free formula ψ​(E)𝜓𝐸\\psi(E) of length The ball theorem (Theorem 3.4) applied to ∃E∈ℝ:ψ​(E):𝐸ℝ𝜓𝐸\\exists E\\in\\mathbb{R}:\\psi(E) now yields an upper bound for E𝐸E: Choose K=⌈8​log⁡(|ψ|)​α3​n​(N+1)⌉𝐾8𝜓superscript𝛼3𝑛𝑁1K=\\bigl{\\lceil}8\\log(\\lvert\\psi\\rvert)\\alpha^{3}n(N+1)\\bigr{\\rceil}.\nObviously, K≤\\poly​(log⁡|ψ|,N,n)𝐾\\poly𝜓𝑁𝑛K\\leq\\poly(\\log\\lvert\\psi\\rvert,N,n).\nSince |ψ|≤\\poly​(|P|,n,N)𝜓\\poly𝑃𝑛𝑁\\lvert\\psi\\rvert\\leq\\poly(\\lvert P\\rvert,n,N), the claim follows. Above Lemma is used to prove the following Lemma that allows us to transform some more general UETR instances into equivalent Strict-UETR instances. Given a UETR instance where F:ℝn→ℝ:𝐹→superscriptℝ𝑛ℝF:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\to\\mathbb{R}, G:ℝm→ℝ:𝐺→superscriptℝ𝑚ℝG:\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\to\\mathbb{R} and P:ℝn+m→ℝ:𝑃→superscriptℝ𝑛𝑚ℝP:\\mathbb{R}^{n+m}\\to\\mathbb{R} are polynomials.\nThen we can compute in polynomial time an equivalent Strict-UETR instance. Via a series of manipulations, we transform the given sentence into an equivalent UETR instance that has the form required by Lemma 6.2.\nThe first step is to move the condition that ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0 into the formula.\nWe obtain an equivalent sentence Now we observe that ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0 is equivalent to ∃δ∈ℝ:δ2​ε−1=0:𝛿ℝsuperscript𝛿2𝜀10\\exists\\delta\\in\\mathbb{R}:\\delta^{2}\\varepsilon-1=0.\nIncorporating this yields an equivalent sentence Rewriting the implication A⟹B𝐴𝐵A\\implies B as ¬A∨B𝐴𝐵\\neg A\\lor B turns the existential quantifier in front of δ𝛿\\delta into a universal quantifier.\nFurthermore, we replace ¬(δ2​ε−1=0)superscript𝛿2𝜀10\\neg(\\delta^{2}\\varepsilon-1=0) by the equivalent (δ2​ε−1)2>0superscriptsuperscript𝛿2𝜀120(\\delta^{2}\\varepsilon-1)^{2}>0.\nWe get an equivalent sentence Moving all quantifiers to the front, turns this into an equivalent prenex normal form This sentence is ∀for-all\\forall-strict, so Lemmas 3.9 and 3.11 are applicable.\nThus, there are two integers N,M𝑁𝑀N,M bounded by a polynomial in the length of the sentence, such that for C:=22Nassign𝐶superscript2superscript2𝑁C:=\\cramped{2^{2^{N}}} and D:=22Massign𝐷superscript2superscript2𝑀D:=\\cramped{2^{2^{M}}} all universally quantified variables can be restricted to [−C,C]𝐶𝐶[-C,C] and all existentially quantified variables can be restricted to [−D,D]𝐷𝐷[-D,D].\nWe obtain another equivalent sentence In the next step, we replace the strict inequality P​(X,Y)<ε𝑃𝑋𝑌𝜀P(X,Y)<\\varepsilon by the non-strict inequality P​(X,Y)≤ε𝑃𝑋𝑌𝜀P(X,Y)\\leq\\varepsilon.\nFor this step, we exploit the fact that a continuous function over a compact domain attains its minimum and maximum.\nConsequently, ∀ε>0,X∈[−C,C].∃Y∈[−D,D]:P(X,Y)<ε\\forall\\varepsilon>0,X\\in[-C,C]\\,.\\,\\exists Y\\in[-D,D]:P(X,Y)<\\varepsilon is (true if and only if\nmaxX∈[−C,C]⁡minY∈[−D,D]⁡P​(X,Y)≤0subscript𝑋𝐶𝐶subscript𝑌𝐷𝐷𝑃𝑋𝑌0\\max_{X\\in[-C,C]}\\min_{Y\\in[-D,D]}P(X,Y)\\leq 0 and thus)\nequivalent to ∀ε>0,X∈[−C,C].Y∈[−D,D]:P(X,Y)≤ε\\forall\\varepsilon>0,X\\in[-C,C]\\,.\\,Y\\in[-D,D]:P(X,Y)\\leq\\varepsilon.\nWe obtain the equivalent sentence Going one step further, we now want to express P​(X,Y)≤ε𝑃𝑋𝑌𝜀P(X,Y)\\leq\\varepsilon as a polynomial equation.\nTo this end, we replace it by the equivalent formula ∃B∈ℝ:P​(X,Y)−ε+B2=0:𝐵ℝ𝑃𝑋𝑌𝜀superscript𝐵20\\exists B\\in\\mathbb{R}:P(X,Y)-\\varepsilon+B^{2}=0.\nBy Lemma 6.4, we can also bound the range over which B𝐵B is quantified:\nWe can compute in polynomial time an integer K≤\\poly​(|P|,max⁡{N,M},n+m+1)𝐾\\poly𝑃𝑁𝑀𝑛𝑚1K\\leq\\poly(\\lvert P\\rvert,\\max\\{N,M\\},n+m+1) such that |B|≤E:=22K𝐵𝐸assignsuperscript2superscript2𝐾\\lvert B\\rvert\\leq E:=\\cramped{2^{2^{K}}}.\nWe get another equivalent sentence At this point we define Note that φ<∈QFF<subscript𝜑subscriptQFF\\varphi_{<}\\in{\\mathrm{QFF_{<}}}.\nWe use these to get the equivalent sentence The last step is to scale all variables to be in the interval [−1,1]11[-1,1].\nFor this, let S:=max⁡{N,M,K}assign𝑆𝑁𝑀𝐾S:=\\max\\{N,M,K\\} and introduce S+1𝑆1S+1 new variables U={U0,…,US}𝑈subscript𝑈0…subscript𝑈𝑆U=\\{U_{0},\\ldots,U_{S}\\}.\nFurthermore, let χ​(U)𝜒𝑈\\chi(U) be formula (2).\nRecall that by Lemma 3.7, χ​(u)𝜒𝑢\\chi(u) is true if and only if ui=2−2isubscript𝑢𝑖superscript2superscript2𝑖u_{i}=\\cramped{2^{-2^{i}}}.\nWe can rewrite our sentence to the equivalent sentence Here d𝑑d is the maximum degree of any polynomial in φ<subscript𝜑\\varphi_{<} and H𝐻H.\nBy X/US𝑋subscript𝑈𝑆X/U_{S} we denote that every variable Xisubscript𝑋𝑖X_{i} is replaced by Xi/USsubscript𝑋𝑖subscript𝑈𝑆X_{i}/U_{S}.\nMultiplying by USdsuperscriptsubscript𝑈𝑆𝑑U_{S}^{d} makes sure that each atom remains a polynomial.\nWhat we obtained is a UETR instance that has the form required by Lemma 6.2 (note that ¬χ​(U)𝜒𝑈\\neg\\chi(U) is strict).\nTherefore, we can transform this into an equivalent Strict-UETR instance in polynomial time. Now we finally have all the needed tools to prove Theorem 6.1 which states that the Hausdorff problem is contained in ∀∃<ℝfor-allsubscriptℝ\\forall\\exists_{<}\\mathbb{R}.\nWe do this by transforming formula (10) into the form required by Lemma 6.6.\nThis then yields an equivalent Strict-UETR instance, thus proving ∀∃<ℝfor-allsubscriptℝ\\forall\\exists_{<}\\mathbb{R}-membership. Recall that d→H​(A,B)≤tsubscript→𝑑H𝐴𝐵𝑡\\vec{d}_{\\mathrm{H}}(A,B)\\leq t is equivalent to (10), which is In a first step, we resolve the shorthand notations a∈A𝑎𝐴a\\in A and b∈B𝑏𝐵b\\in B and we obtain Next, we consider the (quantifier-free) formulas φA​(a)subscript𝜑𝐴𝑎\\varphi_{A}(a) and φB​(b)subscript𝜑𝐵𝑏\\varphi_{B}(b).\nUsing Lemma 2.1, we obtain in polynomial time two integers k,ℓ𝑘ℓk,\\ell and two polynomials FA:ℝn+k→ℝ:subscript𝐹𝐴→superscriptℝ𝑛𝑘ℝF_{A}:\\mathbb{R}^{n+k}\\to\\mathbb{R} and FB:ℝn+ℓ→ℝ:subscript𝐹𝐵→superscriptℝ𝑛ℓℝF_{B}:\\mathbb{R}^{n+\\ell}\\to\\mathbb{R}, such that φA​(a)subscript𝜑𝐴𝑎\\varphi_{A}(a) is equivalent to ∃Ua∈ℝk:FA​(a,Ua)=0:subscript𝑈𝑎superscriptℝ𝑘subscript𝐹𝐴𝑎subscript𝑈𝑎0\\exists U_{a}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{k}:F_{A}(a,U_{a})=0 and similarly φB​(b)subscript𝜑𝐵𝑏\\varphi_{B}(b) is equivalent to ∃Ub∈ℝℓ:FB​(b,Ub)=0:subscript𝑈𝑏superscriptℝℓsubscript𝐹𝐵𝑏subscript𝑈𝑏0\\exists U_{b}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{\\ell}:F_{B}(b,U_{b})=0.\nThis yields the equivalent sentence Rewriting the implication X⟹Y𝑋𝑌X\\implies Y as ¬X∨Y𝑋𝑌\\neg X\\lor Y changes the existential quantifier in front of Uasubscript𝑈𝑎U_{a} into a universal quantifier, which we can move to the front.\nAlso, the equation gets negated.\nSubstituting ¬(F​(a,Ua)=0)𝐹𝑎subscript𝑈𝑎0\\neg(F(a,U_{a})=0) by F​(a,Ua)2>0𝐹superscript𝑎subscript𝑈𝑎20F(a,U_{a})^{2}>0, we get the equivalent sentence Lastly, we move the existential quantifier after the universal one and get an equivalent sentence in prenex normal form.\nThis sentence has the form required by Lemma 6.2, concluding the proof.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: a-b\\rVert is the square root of a polynomial. Below we transform formula (10) in multiple technical steps into a form that allows us to apply a recent theorem by D’Costa et al. [ref]26 such that ∀∃<ℝfor-allsubscriptℝ\\forall\\exists_{<}\\mathbb{R}-membership follows.\nBefore we do so, we state a few helpful lemmas.\nThese allow us to consider some of the intermediate steps in\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
