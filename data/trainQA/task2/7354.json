      "content": "Paper Title: Distance and Collision Probability Estimation from Gaussian Surface Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA robot 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} is equipped with a range sensor (e.g. depth camera, LiDAR, etc.)\nand it can be moved in a workspace 𝒲⊆ℝqsubscript𝒲absentsuperscriptℝ𝑞\\mathcal{W}_{\\mathrm{}}\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^{q}. In\nthis work q𝑞q is either 222 or 333. The region inside the workspace occupied\nby the robot is modeled using the solid ellipsoid ℰ𝒫​(𝐩,𝐏)subscriptℰ𝒫𝐩𝐏\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathcal{P}}(\\mathbf{p},\\mathbf{P}).\nThe parameters 𝐩𝐩\\mathbf{p} and 𝐏𝐏\\mathbf{P} are determined using the Lowner-John ellipsoid\nfit [ref]44. The center 𝐩𝐩\\mathbf{p} can be uncertain. This\nuncertainty is modeled using a continuous multivariate Gaussian variable P𝑃P\nwith the probability density function 𝒩​(𝐩;𝝁P,𝚺P)𝒩𝐩subscript𝝁𝑃subscript𝚺𝑃\\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{p};\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{P},\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{P}). In practice, these uncertainty estimates may be provided by an\nexternal state estimation system [ref]36. The onboard range sensor provides a stream of point cloud measurements 𝒵𝒵\\mathcal{Z} of the\nsurfaces 𝒲ssubscript𝒲s\\mathcal{W}_{\\mathrm{s}} in the workspace. The elements of the point cloud 𝒵𝒵\\mathcal{Z} are assumed\nto be independent and identically distributed samples of a random variable Z𝑍Z\nwith the probability density function given by the GMM where πmsubscript𝜋𝑚\\pi_{m}, 𝝁Zmsubscriptsuperscript𝝁𝑚𝑍\\boldsymbol{\\mu}^{m}_{Z}, and 𝚺Zmsubscriptsuperscript𝚺𝑚𝑍\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{m}_{Z} are the weight, mean, and covariance\nof the m𝑚m-th Gaussian component in an M𝑀M-component GMM. This GMM can be\nobtained from many recent point cloud modeling methods. The weights may be\nuniform, such as the GSMs obtained via stochastic\ngradient-descent [ref]24  or geometric\nregion growing . Alternatively, GMMs with\nnon-uniform weights obtained from Expectation\nMaximization   or scan\nline segmentation  may also be used.\nThe proposed methods in this work only depend on the geometric interpretation\nof the GMMs and thus do not require the GMMs to be created using a specific method. Given this information, the following problems are addressed in this work: Estimate the closest distance between\nℰ𝒫​(𝐩,𝐏)subscriptℰ𝒫𝐩𝐏\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathcal{P}}(\\mathbf{p},\\mathbf{P}) and fZsubscript𝑓𝑍f_{Z}. Estimate\nthe gradient of this distance at any location. The solution must not\ndepend on a discretization of the space (Section III-C). Estimate the collision probability between\nℰ𝒫​(𝐩,𝐏)subscriptℰ𝒫𝐩𝐏\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathcal{P}}(\\mathbf{p},\\mathbf{P}) and fZsubscript𝑓𝑍f_{Z} when the ellipsoid\ncenter position is uncertain\n(Section III-D).\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: using the solid ellipsoid ℰ𝒫​(𝐩,𝐏)subscriptℰ𝒫𝐩𝐏\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathcal{P}}(\\mathbf{p},\\mathbf{P}).\nThe parameters 𝐩𝐩\\mathbf{p} and 𝐏𝐏\\mathbf{P} are determined using the Lowner-John ellipsoid\nfit [ref]44. The center 𝐩𝐩\\mathbf{p} can be uncertain. This\nuncertainty is modeled using a continuous multivariate Gaussian variable P𝑃P\nwith the probability density function\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
