Apart from designing new architectures, another branch of methods focus on decomposing a large problem into smaller local problems that could be quickly learned by smaller models    . Then a unified policy is learned from the smaller models using knowledge distillation . MTL Optimization   In this work, we focus on the optimization challenge of MTL 8. Gradient manipulation methods are designed specifically to balance the learning of each task. The simplest form of gradient manipulation is to re-weight the task losses based on specific criteria, e.g., uncertainty , gradient norm , or difficulty .\nThese methods are mostly heuristics and their performance can be unstable. Recently, two methods 0  that manipulate the gradients to find a better local update vector have become popular. Sener et al 0 view MTL as a multi-objective optimization problem, and use multiple gradient descent algorithm for optimization. PCGrad  identifies a major optimization challenge for MTL, the conflicting gradients, and proposes to project each task gradient to the normal plane of other task gradients before combining them together to form the final update vector. Though yielding good empirical performance, both methods can only guarantee convergence to a Pareto-stationary point, but not knowing where it exactly converges to. More recently, GradDrop  randomly drops out task gradients based on how much they conflict. IMTL-G  seeks an update vector that has equal projections on each task gradient. RotoGrad  separately scales and rotates task gradients to mitigate optimization conflict. Our method, CAGrad, also manipulates the gradient to find a better optimization trajectory.\nLike other MTL optimization techniques, CAGrad is model-agnostic. However, unlike prior methods, CAGrad converges to the optimal point in theory and achieves better empirical performance on both toy multi-objective optimization tasks and real-world applications.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: Multi-task Learning\n  Due to its benefit with regards to data and computational efficiency, multi-task learning (MTL) has broad applications in vision, language, and robotics [ref]11    8.\nA number of MTL-friendly architectures have been proposed using task-specific modules  [ref]11, attention-based mechanisms  or activating different paths along the deep networks to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
