      "content": "Paper Title: FedTracker: Furnishing Ownership Verification and Traceability for Federated Learning Model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets and Models. In our experiments, we use four different Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) to learn three different datasets including MNIST , CIFAR10 and CIFAR100  . To keep consistency, we resize the images in all the datasets to 32×32323232\\times 32 in our implementation. For MNIST, we utilize a four-layer CNN (denoted as CNN-4) which is of the LeNet [ref]50 style. It is also used in  [ref]1. For CIFAR10, two popular models, AlexNet [ref]44 and VGG-16 , are chosen. ResNet-18  is trained on CIFAR100, a dataset with 100 classes. The first three models are slightly modified by adding a BN layer after each convolution layer, since it is proven that adding BN layers can achieve better performance. FL Settings. To simulate the FL scenario, we set the default number of clients to 505050. In each iteration, we choose 40%percent4040\\% clients to train their local models for 222 local epochs. The learning rate of clients is set to 0.010.010.01. As the default setting, we assume that the distribution of the clients’ data follows independent identical distribution (i.i.d), which means the training dataset is uniformly allocated to each client. We also evaluate FedTracker in the non-i.i.d settings in Section 6.6. Watermark and Fingerprint. For the global watermark, we implement WafflePattern  to generate the trigger set. We first choose a pattern for each class and add Gaussian noise to the patterns to generate the trigger set samples. Each class has 101010 samples in the trigger set. The learning rate is set to 0.0050.0050.005 while embedding global watermarks. For local fingerprints, we set the default length of fingerprints to be 128128128, which is sufficient for tracing 505050 clients. The learning rate is 0.050.050.05 when inserting the client’s fingerprint. Metrics. For ownership verification, we use the accuracy of the trigger set, named watermark accuracy (WM acc for short), as the metric. For traceability, we define another metric named Traceability Rate. Traceability Rate (TR) is defined as the rate of that the client with the largest FSS happens to be the holder of the model. In all our experiments, FedTracker achieves 100%percent100100\\% traceability rate, which indicates that FedTracker can always find out the actual owner of the suspicious model. Traceability Rate (TR) is defined as the rate of that the clients with the largest FSS is actually the original owner of the model. TR can be computed using Equation (17).\n\nReference markers found: [50]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]50: .
