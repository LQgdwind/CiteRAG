      "content": "Paper Title: 1 Introduction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSeveral lower bounds on subsystems of 𝖲𝖯𝖲𝖯{\\mathsf{SP}} and 𝖳𝗋𝖾𝖾𝖱​(𝖢𝖯)𝖳𝗋𝖾𝖾𝖱𝖢𝖯\\mathsf{TreeR(CP)} have already been established.\nKrajíček  proved exponential lower bounds on the size of 𝖱​(𝖢𝖯)𝖱𝖢𝖯\\mathsf{R(CP)} proofs in which both the width of the clauses and the magnitude of the coefficients of each line in the proof are bounded. Concretely, let these bounds be w𝑤w and c𝑐c respectively. The lower bound that he obtains is 2nΩ​(1)/cw​log2⁡nsuperscript2superscript𝑛Ω1superscript𝑐𝑤superscript2𝑛2^{n^{\\Omega(1)}}/c^{w\\log^{2}n}. Kojevnikov  removed the dependence on the coefficient size for 𝖳𝗋𝖾𝖾𝖱​(𝖢𝖯)𝖳𝗋𝖾𝖾𝖱𝖢𝖯\\mathsf{TreeR(CP)} proofs, obtaining a bound of exp⁡(Ω​(n/w​log⁡n))Ω𝑛𝑤𝑛\\exp(\\Omega(\\sqrt{n/w\\log n})). Beame et al.  provide a size-preserving simulation of Stabbing Planes by 𝖳𝗋𝖾𝖾𝖱​(𝖢𝖯)𝖳𝗋𝖾𝖾𝖱𝖢𝖯\\mathsf{TreeR(CP)} which translates a depth d𝑑d Stabbing Planes proof into a width d𝑑d 𝖳𝗋𝖾𝖾𝖱​(𝖢𝖯)𝖳𝗋𝖾𝖾𝖱𝖢𝖯\\mathsf{TreeR(CP)} proof, and therefore this implies lower bounds on the size of 𝖲𝖯𝖲𝖯{\\mathsf{SP}} proofs of depth o​(n/log⁡n)𝑜𝑛𝑛o(n/\\log n). Beame et al.  exhibit a function for which there are no 𝖲𝖯𝖲𝖯{\\mathsf{SP}} refutations of depth o​(n/log2⁡n)𝑜𝑛superscript2𝑛o(n/\\log^{2}n) via a reduction to the communication complexity of the CNF search problem. Besides the work of Razborov , a number of supercritical tradeoffs have been observed in proof complexity.\nPerhaps most relevant for our work, Razborov  proved a supercritical tradeoff for Cutting Planes proofs under the assumption that each inequality has a bounded number of distinct variables (mimicking the bound on the width of each clause in the supercritical tradeoff of ). A number of supercritical tradeoffs are also known between proof width and proof space. Beame et al.  and Beck et al.  exhibited formulas which admit polynomial size refutations in Resolution and the Polynomial Calculus respectively, and such that any refutation of sub-linear space necessitates a superpolynomial blow-up in size. Recently, Berkholz and Nordström  gave a supercritical trade-off between width and space for Resolution. It is widely known (and easy to prove) that any unsatisfiable family of CNF formulas can be refuted by exponential size and linear depth Cutting Planes.\nIt is also known that neither Cutting Planes nor Stabbing Planes can be balanced, in the sense that a depth-d𝑑d proof can always be transformed into a size 2O​(d)superscript2𝑂𝑑2^{O(d)} proof  .\nThis differentiates both of these proof systems from more powerful proof systems like Frege, for which it is well-known how to balance arbitrary proofs .\nFurthermore, even though both the Tseitin principles and systems of linear equations in finite fields can be proved in both quasipolynomial-size and O​(log2⁡n)𝑂superscript2𝑛O(\\log^{2}n) depth in Facelike 𝖲𝖯𝖲𝖯{\\mathsf{SP}}, the simulation of Facelike 𝖲𝖯𝖲𝖯{\\mathsf{SP}} by 𝖢𝖯𝖢𝖯{\\mathsf{CP}} cannot preserve both size and depth, as the Tseitin principles are known to require depth Θ​(n)Θ𝑛\\Theta(n) to refute in 𝖢𝖯𝖢𝖯{\\mathsf{CP}} . We first recall the known depth lower bound techniques for Cutting Planes, semantic Cutting Planes, and Stabbing Planes proofs.\nIn all of these proof systems, arguably the primary method for proving depth lower bounds is by reducing to real communication complexity  ; however, communication complexity is always trivially upper bounded by n𝑛n, and it is far from clear how to use the assumption on the size of the proof to boost this to superlinear. A second class of methods have been developed for syntactic Cutting Planes, which lower bound rank measures of a polytope, such as the Chvátal rank. In this setting, lower bounds are typically proven using so-called protection lemmas , which seems much more amenable to applying a small-size assumption on the proof. We also remark that for many formulas (such as the Tseitin formulas!) it is known how to achieve Ω​(n)Ω𝑛\\Omega(n)-depth lower bounds in Cutting Planes via protection lemmas, while proving even ω​(log⁡n)𝜔𝑛\\omega(\\log n) lower bounds via communication complexity is impossible, due to a known folklore upper bound. The first lower bound on the Chvátal rank was established by Chvátal et al. , who proved a linear bound for a number of polytopes in  nsuperscript01𝑛 ^{n}. Much later, Pokutta and Schulz  characterized the polytopes P⊆ 𝑃01P\\subseteq  with P∩ℤn=∅𝑃superscriptℤ𝑛P\\cap\\mathbb{Z}^{n}=\\emptyset which have Chvátal rank exactly n𝑛n. However, unlike most other cutting planes procedures, the Chvátal rank is not of polytopes P∩ n𝑃superscript01𝑛P\\cap ^{n} with P∩ℤn=∅𝑃superscriptℤ𝑛P\\cap\\mathbb{Z}^{n}=\\emptyset is not upper bounded by n𝑛n. Eisenbrand and Schulz  showed that the Chvátal rank of any polytope P⊆ n𝑃superscript01𝑛P\\subseteq ^{n} is at most O​(n2​log⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑛2𝑛O(n^{2}\\log n) and gave examples where it is Ω​(n)Ω𝑛\\Omega(n); a nearly-matching quadratic lower bound was later established by Rothvoß and Sanita .\nFor CNF formulas, the Chvátal rank is (trivially) at most n𝑛n. Buresh-Oppenheim et al.  gave the first lower bounds on the Chvátal rank a number of CNF formulas, including an Ω​(n)Ω𝑛\\Omega(n) lower bound for the Tseitin formulas. The rank of a number of generalizations of Cutting Planes has been studied as well. However, none of these appear to capture the strength of semantic Cutting Planes. Indeed, semantic Cutting Planes is able to refute Knapsack in a single cut, and therefore is known not to be polynomially verifiable unless 𝖯=𝖭𝖯𝖯𝖭𝖯{\\mathsf{P}}={\\mathsf{NP}} . Lower bounds on the rank when using split cuts and mixed integer cuts, instead of CG cuts, was established in [ref]25.\nPokutta and Schulz  obtained Ω​(n/log⁡n)Ω𝑛𝑛\\Omega(n/\\log n) rank lower bounds on the complete tautology (which includes every clause of width n𝑛n) for the broad class of admissible cutting planes, which includes syntactic Cutting Planes, split cuts, and many of the lift-and-project operators. Bodur et al. 4 studied the relationship between rank and integrality gaps for another broad generalization of Cutting Planes known as aggregate cuts.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: is known not to be polynomially verifiable unless 𝖯=𝖭𝖯𝖯𝖭𝖯{\\mathsf{P}}={\\mathsf{NP}} .
