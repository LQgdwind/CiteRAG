      "content": "Paper Title: Stopping Criteria for Value Iteration on Stochastic Games with Quantitative Objectives This research was funded in part by DFG projects 383882557 ‚ÄúSUV‚Äù and 427755713 ‚ÄúGOPro‚Äù.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMarkov decision processes (MDP) and stochastic games (SG) are the standard basic models for sequential decision making in the presence of uncertainty.\nWhile MDP can model either controllable behaviour or adversarial behaviour (such as schedulers or unknown environment), SG generalize MDP to encompass both at once.\nA quantitative objective for such a system is a random variable, assigning a real number to each run.\nA classic task is to find the optimal value v‚àósuperscriptùë£v^{*} of its expectation, maximized (or minimized) over all strategies (a.k.a.¬†policies, schedulers, or controllers) resolving the choices.\nFor decades, this problem has been thoroughly investigated for both formalisms with respect to various quantitative objectives, such as discounted reward , total reward , long-run average reward (a.k.a. mean payoff)  , or reachability/safety  as an important special case of the latter two. Value iteration (VI)  is a classic solution technique applicable to these settings , yielding a sequence of approximants converging in the limit to the actual optimal value v‚àósuperscriptùë£v^{*}.\nIt often is preferred over other solution methods due to its good practical performance, see  for a comparison on MDP.\nFor the use in applications such as verification of safety-critical systems, guarantees on the precision of the approximants play a paramount role since the exact optimal value v‚àósuperscriptùë£v^{*} may not be attained by any of the approximants within the given computation-time budget or in any finite time.\nBesides, it is typically sufficient to determine v‚àósuperscriptùë£v^{*} with a specified precision.\nIn this case an earlier termination of the algorithm is desirable, while still guaranteeing at least the required precision. However, until recently, VI algorithms for non-discounted rewards provided no precision of the produced approximants and implementations in model checkers could yield arbitrarily wrong results [ref]9!\nFortunately, recent works have equipped VI in several settings with stopping criteria, i.e.¬†the algorithms produce not only approximants of v‚àósuperscriptùë£v^{*} but also a bound on their imprecision, allowing VI to stop when the desired precision is reached.\nIn other words, the algorithms produce guaranteed lower and upper bounds on v‚àósuperscriptùë£v^{*}.\nSince these under- and over-approximations of v‚àósuperscriptùë£v^{*} are steadily improving and accessible at any point of time during the (possibly infinite) run of the VI algorithm, VI becomes a so-called anytime algorithm, i.e.¬†at every step in the algorithm, it can return the current estimate with its imprecision/error bound, and this bound converges to 0 in the limit.\nThis has been achieved for MDP with various objectives such as reachability 0 [ref]9, total reward until reaching the target 1 2 3, long-run average reward 4, but for SG due to their more complex structure only for reachability 5 6 and multi-dimensional reachability 7.\nAs emphasized in the conclusion of 8, these shortcomings are still to be studied for SG. Our contribution in this paper are the first stopping criteria for total reward and long-run average reward in SG.\nThis enables a reliable use of VI, as required e.g.¬†in model checkers.\nMoreover, our approach is a unified solution for the various objectives and systems. To better identify the commonalities of the various objectives and achieve deeper understanding, we provide the solution in two flavours.\n The first algorithm reduces the problem on SG to a sequence of problems on MDP.\nThese can be solved by any algorithm for MDP. Consequently, this approach directly profits from any improvements on solving MDP.\nMoreover, our algorithm generalizes to a stopping criterion for strategy iteration (SI)¬†9 in SG:\nWhile SI classically is required to be executed until the optimum is obtained in order to yield guarantees, we obtain converging bounds and thus an anytime algorithm, too. The second algorithm extends the guaranteed-precision VI from MDP to SG.\nIt uses the bounded variant of VI 0, where VI iterates both from below and separately from above, thus providing its own error bounds.\nSince this algorithm operates directly on SG, it can localize the convergence difficulties (we even give a characterization of when this happens) and overcome them by local and thus possibly cheaper computation. On the conceptual level, our work can be seen as an extension of previous work from two perspectives: Firstly, more visibly in the first algorithm, we extend the traditional VI algorithms for the various objectives in SG to VI with a stopping criterion.\nInstead of computing one sequence converging to v‚àósuperscriptùë£v^{*}, we compute two sequences monotonically converging from below and from above, forming the under- and over-approximations, respectively.\nInterestingly, depending on the objective, traditional VI algorithms may be reused to different extents.\nFor instance, the traditional VI for reachability already yields a valid under-approximation and we only have to complement it with a valid over-approximation.\nDually, for safety, the traditional VI provides an over-approximation to be complemented by an under-approximation.\nIn contrast, for long-run average reward ‚Äì a generalization of both reachability of safety ‚Äì new approximations are needed on both sides since the original VI sequence is oscillating around the value v‚àósuperscriptùë£v^{*}. Secondly, more visibly in the second algorithm, we extend the VI stopping criteria for MDP and for reachability in SG to SG with more complex objectives.\nVI essentially computes a fixpoint of an update rule for the value in each states.\nThe issue in getting both converging under- and over-approximation is that there may be more fixpoints because of cyclic dependencies of the values.\nIn MDP, this takes the form of all states in a so-called maximal end component (MEC) having the same value; the solution is thus simply grouping all these states into a single one (often called MEC-quotient or collapsing MECs 0 [ref]9).\nWhile these MECs can be identified on the graph-theoretical level, in SG the solution requires a finer concept of so-called simple end components (SEC) 5, which depend on the values that we are in turn trying to compute (as explained in Example¬†2).\nThis vicious cycle is broken by considering varying sets of states to be grouped only temporarily during the run of the algorithm, depending on the current approximations.\nFinally, in contrast to reachability, where remaining in such sets of states yields only values 0 or 1, yet another level of difficulty in grouping arises for total and average reward, where non-trivial values can be attained. Our contribution can be thus summarized as follows: We give the first stopping criteria for VI on SG with total reward (in its three common variants 1) and with long-run average reward, hence the first reliable VI algorithms.\nMoreover, they are in the form of anytime algorithms. Our approach provides a uniform framework for the new as well as previously studied cases with the standard quantitative objectives.\nIn the course of this, we identify fundamental objective-independent concepts, such as ‚Äústaying‚Äù and ‚Äúexiting‚Äù values, together with the\nobjective-specific ways to compute them, or a new definition of SEC.\nThe new concepts apply uniformly to all considered objectives.\nConsequently, our solution is also more transparent.\nFinally, due to its generality, it yields a stopping criterion for strategy iteration, too.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: However, until recently, VI algorithms for non-discounted rewards provided no precision of the produced approximants and implementations in model checkers could yield arbitrarily wrong results [ref]9!\nFortunately, recent works have equipped VI in several settings with stopping criteria, i.e.¬†the algorithms produce not only approximants of v‚àósuperscriptùë£v^{*} but also a bound on their\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
