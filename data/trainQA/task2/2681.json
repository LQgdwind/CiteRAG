      "content": "Paper Title: CDS directions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSystemic risk and contagion in financial networks have been studied extensively in the literature       . Previous work models a financial network as a setup of interconnected nodes, representing economic firms, in an arc-weighted graph where arcs represent debt obligations from one firm toward another. Among the first papers on systemic risk in financial networks, Eisenberg and Noe , study the problem of finding a clearing payment vector for a financial system that admits only direct liabilities. They prove, applying Tarski’s fixed point theorem, that such payment vectors always exist and provide a polynomial time algorithm for computing one. A variation of the original model by Eisenberg and Noe is presented by Rogers and Veraart in . Financial systems admitting both direct liabilities and CDS contracts are introduced by Schuldenzucker et al. in . In this paper, the authors are interested in computing the clearing recovery rate vector of the system. They establish that such a vector always exists when studying models in  whereas that’s not he case for models in  and deciding whether one does is NP-hard . Subsequently, Schuldenzucker et al. in  study the problem of computing a clearing recovery rate vector in models where existence is guaranteed. Early in their paper, they construct a simple instance of a financial network whose solution is proved to be irrational, thus making the problem of computing a clearing recovery rate vector an approximation problem. Their main result is that almost-approximating the clearing recovery rate vector is PPAD-complete, meaning that no PTAS exists unless P=PPADPPPAD\\textsf{P}=\\textsf{PPAD}. In absence of approximation algorithms for computing an exact solution, much work has been done on the computational complexity of deciding the proper clearing recovery rate that satisfies specific objectives for the system. Papp and Wattenhofer in , establish that if a regulator can characterize some solution, it is still NP-hard to decide the clearing recovery rate that minimizes the number of defaulting banks and the unpaid debt in the system. Moreover they prove that choosing the solution that is most preferable by the largest set of banks, the solution that is preferred by a specific bank as well as the solution with the best equity distribution is also NP-hard to approximate within some constant factor. Despite the existence of a clearing recovery rate vector being guaranteed, irrationality ensures the lack of efficient algorithms for computing one. Our present paper originates from this absence, leading us to consider approximation versions of the problem. It is known from , that the problem of computing a clearing recovery rate vector can be cast as a fixed point total search problem. A complexity class regarding fixed point computations of total search problems, is the FIXP class defined by Etessami and Yannakakis in , where the authors define and introduce the FIXP complexity class and prove that the problem of computing a 3-player (or more) Nash equilibrium is complete for this class. Not many FIXP-complete problems are known in the literature, but some example we are aware of can be found in  [ref]10  . Work has also been done on the incentives of banks in financial networks. The authors of  study price of anarchy and stability in games where banks can strategically decide how to repay debts when insolvent. The strategic aspects of modifying the structure of the network (by, e.g., writing off a debt) to a bank’s advantage are considered in .\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: problem of computing a 3-player (or more) Nash equilibrium is complete for this class.
