      "content": "Paper Title: DiTCtrl: Exploring Attention Control in Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer for Tuning-Free Multi-Prompt Longer Video Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nText-to-video (T2V) generation has made remarkable progress in the AIGC era   [ref]41, and breakthroughs such as Sora  have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating longer videos through DiT  architecture and large-scale per-taining.\nHowever, feeding sequential prompts into current state-of-the-art video generation models (e.g., Kling , Gen3 , CogVideoX [ref]45) fails to produce coherent video sequences that exhibit natural transitions with precise prompt-following. This limitation stems from their fundamental design and single-prompt training paradigm, making them inadequate for depicting real-world scenarios’ dynamic, multi-action nature. Although pioneering works  7 9 have begun exploring multi-prompt video generation, they face significant challenges. e.g., training such extended video generation models 9 7 from scratch would require unprecedented computational resources and datasets that are practically unfeasible when the model size increases. Current zero-shot longer video generation methods 3  1 still mainly focus on the single prompt situation with longer length.\nMoreover, all previous works  3 9 7 1 are specifically designed under UNet architecture which restricts the abilities of more complex motions and increase the difficulties in multi-prompt generation.\nHowever, since Sora ’s  groundbreaking demonstration of two-minute video generation, highlighting the scalability potential of DiT architectures . Subsequent explorations have led to influential developments, notably in image generation models (Stable Diffusion 3 , FLUX.1 ) and video generations (CogVideoX [ref]45, Mochi1 ). They   [ref]45  all adopt a specific kind of DiT architecture, i.e., Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT ) as the basic unit. This architecture effectively maps text and images (or video) into a unified sequence for attention computation, enabling deeper model scale abilities and achieving superior performances. Thus, to keep the abilities of the pre-trained single prompt T2V model and take advantage of the performance of the diffusion transformer, we propose DiTCtrl, a training-free multi-prompt video generation method under the pre-trained MM-DiT video generation model.\nOur key observation is that the multi-prompt video generation can be considered a two-step problem:\n1) Video editing over time: The new video is generated through the previous video with a new prompt. \n2) Video transition over time: Two generated videos need to keep a smooth transition between clips.\nThus, to perform consistent video editing, inspired by the UNet-based image editing techniques  ,\nwe explore the characteristic of the attention modules in the MM-DiT block for the first time, finding that the 3D full attention has similar behaviors to that of the cross-/self-attention blocks in the UNet-like diffusion models  [ref]41. We thus apply a KV-sharing method between the video clips of different prompts to maintain the semantic consistency of the key objects  with the 3D attention control.\nBesides, we utilize a latent blending strategy for transitions between clips to connect the video clip seamlessly. Finally, to systematically evaluate our method and facilitate future research in multi-prompt video generation, we also introduce MPVBench, a new benchmark with diverse transition types and specialized metrics for assessing multi-prompt transitions. Extensive experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining computational efficiency. The contributions of this paper can be summarized as: We propose DiTCtrl, the first tuning-free approach based on MM-DiT architecture for coherent multi-prompt video generation. Our method incorporates a novel KV-sharing mechanism and latent blending strategy, enabling seamless transitions between different prompts without additional training. We pioneers the analysis of MM-DiT’s attention mechanism, finding that 3D full atteniton has similar behaviors to that of the cross/self-attention blocks in the UNet-like diffusion models, enabling mask-guided precise semantic control across different prompts for enhanced generation consistency. We introduce MPVBench, a new benchmark specially designed for multi-prompt video generation, featuring diverse transition types and specialized metrics for multi-prompt video evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-prompt video generation while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has made remarkable progress in the AIGC era   [ref]41, and breakthroughs such as Sora  have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating longer videos through DiT  architecture and large-scale per-taining.\nHowever, feeding sequential\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
