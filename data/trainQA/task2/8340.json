Huge progress has been made in using modern neural networks to tackle 3D learning tasks: representing them in point cloud  or mesh  enables the learning on 3D solids and achieves first success in solid learning; further researches leverage the generative power of Diffusion Models   to enable the generation of point clouds  , meshes  , and voxels . However, learning directly on B-Rep shapes is still challenging, and some works, e.g., DeepCAD for B-Rep generation 7, get around this by representing the CAD shape as a sequence of modeling operations (e.g., sketching and extruding) stored in parametric CAD files     , where modeling operations are limited to the sketching and extruding and are difficult to scale . To directly consume the geometric and topological information from B-Rep data, recent attempts convert the B-Rep into a graph, then pass through a graph neural network (GNN), hereby performing learning tasks such as face segmentation or solid classification  [ref]21 . Prediction accuracy has been significantly improved by increasing the information added to the graph, i.e., from using face normal and distance to origin as node feature in CADNet  to additionally introducing UV-grids, trimming mask and curve geometries into the graph in UV-Net [ref]21. While converting B-Rep to graphs performs well in shape classification and segmentation tasks, in the field of solid generation, B-Rep is often represented as a predefined hierarchical structure and generated by autoregressive prediction of B-Rep entities. This approach has given rise to some convincing methods, such as SolidGen  and BrepGen 7. It is worth noting that current research has hardly attempted geometric learning using Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) , but the machine learning community has already developed a keen interest in learning from NURBS. For example, fitting NURBS surfaces from point clouds with gradient-based learning   has been well studied, where the challenge of reversing point clouds to NURBS surfaces have been pointed out and more work has been done to solve this problem  . But using point cloud (UV-grid) as surface representation is still suboptimal.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: Learning from 2D geometric designs  [ref]26   is not sufficient for the rapidly evolving industry, where designs are mainly represented in 3D Boundary Representation (B-Rep)  in computer-aided design (CAD).
