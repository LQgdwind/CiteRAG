Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Momentum Adversarial Distillation: Handling Large Distribution Shifts in Data-Free Knowledge Distillation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe consider the image classification task and evaluate our proposed\nmethod on 3 small image datasets (CIFAR10 ,\nCIFAR100 , TinyImageNet [ref]25),\nand 3 large image datasets (ImageNet [ref]9, Places365\n, Food101 ). Details are provided\nin Appdx.¬†A.1. For the small datasets, we follow  [ref]14\nand consider ResNet34/ResNet18  and WRN40-2/WRN16-2\n8 for the teacher/student. We observed that\nknowledge distillation with the WRN architectures is more challenging\nthan with the ResNet architectures, possibly because WRN40-2/WRN16-2\nhave much fewer parameters than ResNet34/ResNet18. For the large datasets,\nwe use the AlexNet architecture for both the teacher and student for\nfast training. Since AlexNet does not have any BatchNorm layer, we\nexclude the BNmm loss (Eq.¬†9) from the total loss\nof the generator in our experiments on the large datasets. Architectures\nof the generator w.r.t. different datasets are given in Appdx.¬†A.4. For ImageNet, we make use of pretrained networks provided by PyTorch.\nFor other datasets, we train the teacher from scratch. Detailed training\nsettings of the teacher are given in Appdx.¬†A.2. If not otherwise specified, we set the momentum Œ±ùõº\\alpha in Eq.¬†5\nto 0.950.950.95 and the length of the noise vector to 256. We train the\nstudent ùöÇùöÇ\\mathtt{S} using SGD and Adam for the small and large datasets,\nrespectively. We train the generator ùô∂ùô∂\\mathtt{G} using Adam for both the\nsmall and large datasets. To reduce the difficulty of training ùô∂ùô∂\\mathtt{G}\nfor the large datasets, we pretrain ùô∂ùô∂\\mathtt{G} for some steps before\nthe main KD training by setting the coefficient of ‚ÑíKDsubscript‚ÑíKD\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{KD}}\nto 0 and only optimizing the remaining losses in Eq.¬†6.\nThe generator ùô∂ùô∂\\mathtt{G} is class-conditional (as described in Section¬†3.2)\nfor the large datasets, and unconditional for the small datasets.\nWe empirically found that this leads to better results. For further\ndetails about the training settings of MAD, please refer to\nAppdx.¬†A.3.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: We consider the image classification task and evaluate our proposed\nmethod on 3 small image datasets (CIFAR10 ,\nCIFAR100 , TinyImageNet [ref]25),\nand 3 large image datasets (ImageNet [ref]9, Places365\n, Food101 ).

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
