      "content": "Paper Title: Adversarial Robustness Assessment of NeuroEvolution Approaches\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe evaluate models designed by two NE approaches: DENSER [ref]1 and NSGA-Net [ref]3. This choice was mainly based on two criteria: firstly, models had to be directly trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, and secondly, pre-trained models (i.e., network weights) had to be publicly available, so as to introduce as little bias as possible from our end. In fact, all the attacked models are pre-trained and publicly available. We use these models directly, without re-training them, but describe some relevant differences in the training procedures. The WRN-28-10 architecture , a manually-designed wide residual network, is used as the baseline model in our experiments for a variety of reasons: its performance on CIFAR-10 is similar to that of the models from the two NE approaches, the work which proposes NSGA-Net [ref]3 also uses it as a baseline, and some of the defenses from the RobustBench leaderboard  are based on this architecture.\nIn particular, we use the pre-trained model from the Model Zoo of RobustBench 111https://github.com/RobustBench/robustbench, which was trained with the 50000 training images of CIFAR-10, without any data augmentation.\nBesides converting the pixel values to  \\left[0,1\\right] as previously described, no further pre-processing is applied to the data. In what concerns DENSER [ref]1, we select the network that achieved the best accuracy on the CIFAR-10 test set over 10 evolutionary runs. The models resulting from 5 independent training runs of this network are publicly available 222https://github.com/fillassuncao/denser-models, but, again, we solely attack the one with the highest test accuracy.\nIn these training runs, the original work used the complete training set of CIFAR-10 and applied a data augmentation method which includes padding, horizontal flipping, and random crops (similar to what is done in ).\nIn addition to converting the pixel values to real numbers, the data is expected to be centered around zero before being fed to the first layer of the network. Following [ref]1, this is accomplished through the removal of the mean pixel value per location and color channel (calculated on the entire training set). As far as the NSGA-Net approach [ref]3 is concerned, we conduct experiments with a pre-trained model from the macro search space described in Section II-A (NSGA-M), as well as three variants of the architecture obtained by using the cells found by NSGA-Net on the NASNet micro search space [ref]38 (NSGA-mA, NSGA-mB, and NSGA-mC with an increasingly higher number of model parameters, as shown in Table I).\nIn the original work, cutout  was used to train these models, together with a data augmentation strategy similar to the one adopted by DENSER, which includes padding, random crops, and horizontal flipping.\nFor the three models from the micro search space, the scheduled path dropout technique [ref]38 was also adopted, together with an auxiliary head classifier, whose loss is aggregated with the loss from the main network [ref]3.\nAfter converting the pixel values to real numbers, the data is expected to be normalized using pre-calculated means and standard deviations for each color channel.\nFurther details about these architectures and training procedure can be found in the original paper [ref]3 and the source code repository 333https://github.com/ianwhale/nsga-net. An overview of the size of the models used in our experiments, as given by the number of trainable parameters, is presented in Table I.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: We evaluate models designed by two NE approaches: DENSER [ref]1 and NSGA-Net [ref]3.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
