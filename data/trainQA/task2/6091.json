      "content": "Paper Title: Approximate Evaluation of Quantitative Second Order Queries\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExtensions to Monadic Second Order logic towards counting and evaluation in standard arithmetic have been investigated by a number of authors. Szeider investigated an enrichment via the addition of so-called local cardinality constraints, which restrict the size of the intersection between the neighborhood of each vertex and the instantiated free set variables , and established XP-tractability for the fragment when parameterized by treewidth and query size. The addition of weight comparisons to MSO exclusively over free set variables was investigated by Ganian and Obdržálek [ref]27, who show that the resulting logic admits fixed-parameter model checking when parameterized by the vertex cover number, i.e., the size of the minimum vertex cover in the input graph. Knop, Koutecký, Masařík and Toufar  studied various means of combining local cardinality constraints with weight comparisons and established their complexity with respect to the vertex cover number and a generalization of it to dense graphs called neighborhood diversity. Crucially, none of the frameworks for resolving queries in these extensions of Monadic Second Order logic are fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the query size and treewidth (or cliquewidth). The approximate evaluation of logical queries was pioneered by Dreier and Rossmanith in the context of counting extensions to first order queries . Before that, Lampis  developed algorithms providing approximate solutions to several problems parameterized by treewidth and cliquewidth that are captured by our framework, including Equitable Coloring  , Bounded Degree Deletion [ref]22 , Graph Balancing , Capacitated Vertex Cover  and Capacitated Dominating Set .\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: for the fragment when parameterized by treewidth and query size. The addition of weight comparisons to MSO exclusively over free set variables was investigated by Ganian and Obdržálek [ref]27, who show that the resulting logic admits fixed-parameter model checking when parameterized by the vertex cover number, i.e., the size of the minimum vertex cover in the input graph.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
