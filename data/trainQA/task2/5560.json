      "content": "Paper Title: Self-supervised network distillation: an effective approach to exploration in sparse reward environments\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe development of reinforcement learning (RL) methods has achieved much success over the last decade, since together with advances in computer vision  , it became possible to teach agents to solve various tasks, play computer games  (see overview in ) even surpassing human players .\nNevertheless, these single tasks require very long training times and a lot of computational resources.\nCoping with complex environments such as the real world is still a challenge. There are several research opportunities, one of them being the search for more efficient learning methods. The complex environments with sparse rewards pose a special challenge for RL approaches.\nThe most popular computational approach to make RL more efficient is based on a concept of intrinsic motivation (IM) [ref]8.\nIM has a strong biological basis  [ref]35, since it is observed among higher animals, especially in humans, engaging them in various activities.\nIntrinsic motivations appear early after birth and guide the biological agents during their entire lives. IM is considered one of the prerequisites for open-ended (or, life-long) learning.\nIf we want to achieve this capacity with artificial agents [ref]38, we have to master this first step and equip them with an ability to generate their own goals and acquire new skills .\nTherefore, computational approaches concerned with IMs and open-ended development provide the potential in this direction leading to more intelligent systems, in particular those capable of improving their own skills and knowledge autonomously and indefinitely [ref]8 . The concept of intrinsic (and extrinsic) motivation was first studied in psychology  and later it entered the RL literature   . The first taxonomy of computational models appeared in  where the concept of motivation is divided into external and internal, depending on a mechanism that generates motivation for the agent. External motivation assumes the source of motivation coming from outside the agent, and it is always associated with a particular goal in the environment. If the motivation is generated within the structures that make up the agent, this implies an internal motivation. Another dimension for the differentiation, extrinsic or intrinsic, is less obvious (see also [ref]35).\nExtrinsic motivations pertain to behaviors whenever an activity is performed in order to attain some separable outcome.222For instance, a child studies diligently at school not just enjoying the activities as such, but for a certain reason, e.g. expecting a better job in the future.\nSome variability exists in this context since these behaviors can vary in the extent to which they represent self-determination (see the details in ).\nOn the other hand, intrinsic motivation is defined as doing an activity for its inherent satisfaction. IM has been operationally defined in various ways, backed up by different psychological theories which point to some uncertainty in what it exactly means. Nevertheless,\na solution of an operational definition of IMs has been proposed  in terms of processes that can drive the acquisition of knowledge and skills in the absence of extrinsic motivations. Furthermore, the author proposes (and explains why) a new term of epistemic motivations as a suitable substitution for intrinsic motivations.\nDespite some uncertainty, intrinsic motivation has remained a well-coined term in the literature. Intrinsic motivation is a crucial factor that helps the agent not only to remain in open-ended learning, hence solving a variety of tasks [ref]38, but it also helps to solve a single task with extremely sparse rewards. In this paper, we focus on this case. There exists a variety of approaches aiming to use IM-based signal for agent learning. Information-theoretic view on IM is well represented in the literature, involving the concepts of novelty, surprise, and skill learning. The recent review  suggests that novelty and surprise can assist the building of a hierarchy of transferable skills that abstracts dynamics and makes the exploration process more robust. In this context, abstraction is a key feature of the agent architecture where it makes sense to introduce learning mechanisms to enforce the formation of proper internal representations that lead to improved agent performance. Learning appropriate internal representations from unlabelled input data (e.g. images) for the purpose of solving various problems is in general a useful task in machine learning. This can be achieved in various ways (related methods are mentioned in Sec. 2), including supervised end-to-end (deep) learning, self-supervised autoencoders, unsupervised feature extractors (such as contrastive divergence learning) and RL-based approaches where a certain loss function is optimized. As our main contribution, we identified shortcomings of the Random Network Distillation model (RND)  that served as a starting point for our work. RND is a novelty detection method that uses two models, the target model and the predictor model, both being fed by the current state as their input. The predictor model attempts to imitate the target model, and their difference (in terms of generated features) is used for intrinsic motivation.\nHowever, the RND method requires good initialization of the target model, has a low variance of intrinsic rewards, and loses the motivational signal, which is caused by the adaptation of the predictor model. To address these shortcomings, in this contribution, we introduce a class of motivational methods based on the exploitation of the distillation error as novelty detection.\nTo provide features with higher variance and better sensitivity for novelty detection, we use self-organized regularization of the target model. Our methods were able to use more feature space dimensions compared to RND (which has an impact on the size of the distillation error) and more importantly, the distances between representations of very similar states increased, which achieved a better ability to distinguish them from each other and thus the task for the predictor model became more complex. This led to an increase in the variance of the intrinsic reward and a slowdown in the adaptation of the predictor model.\nIn particular, we adapted three existing self-supervised methods.\nThe developed methodologies were tested on a set of environments that are considered difficult to explore.\nThe overall concept is shown in Figure 1. Using these methods, we were able to solve hard exploration seeds for ProcGen and the complete first level of the infamous Atari game – Montezuma’s Revenge, which, as far as we know, has never been finished using internal motivation methods. Overall, our models achieved excellent performance in most environments, and we provide insights based on our analyses, why this could be the case. Our research goal was not to solve a general problem of RL, but as in many similar papers (see the related work) we focused on a set of challenging environments of a certain type (complex Atari games) with naturally sparse rewards. We also add challenging ProcGen games, since their authors provided hard exploration seeds, making the PPO algorithm unable to solve the tasks, even with a larger IMPALA model . The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 relates our work in a wider and narrower context. Section 3 describes the methods that we introduced and tested in this work. Section 4 explains in detail all experiments performed. Section 5 provides the discussion about the achieved results, the limitations of our models and hints for further extensions.\nSection 6 concludes the paper by summarizing the main take-home messages.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: environments with sparse rewards pose a special challenge for RL approaches.\nThe most popular computational approach to make RL more efficient is based on a concept of intrinsic motivation (IM) [ref]8.\nIM has a strong biological basis  [ref]35, since it is observed among higher animals, especially in humans, engaging them in various activities.\nIntrinsic motivations appear early after birth\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
