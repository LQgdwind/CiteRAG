      "content": "Paper Title: MSGNN: A Spectral Graph Neural Network Based on a Novel Magnetic Signed Laplacian\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we review related work constructing neural networks for directed graphs and signed graphs. We refer the reader to  for more background information. Several works have aimed to define neural networks on directed graphs by constructing various directed graph Laplacians and defining convolution as multiplication in the associated eigenbasis. 9 defines a directed graph Laplacian by generalizing identities involving the undirected graph Laplacian and the stationary distribution of a random walk. [ref]20 uses a similar idea, but with PageRank in place of a random walk.  constructs three different first- and second-order symmetric adjacency matrices and uses these adjacency matrices to define associated Laplacians. Similarly,  uses several different graph Laplacians based on various graph motifs. Quite closely related to our work, 4 constructs a graph neural network using the magnetic Laplacian. Indeed, in the case where all edge weights are positive, our GNN exactly reduces to the one proposed in 4. Importantly, unlike the other directed graph Laplacians mentioned above, the magnetic Laplacian is a complex, Hermitian matrix rather than a real, symmetric matrix. We also note\n[ref]5, which constructs a GNN for node clustering on directed graphs based on flow imbalance. All of the above works are restricted to unsigned graphs, i.e., graphs with positive edge weights. However, there are also a number of neural networks introduced for signed (and possibly also directed) graphs, mostly focusing on the task of link sign prediction, i.e., predicting whether a link between two nodes will be positive or negative.\nSGCN by  is one of the first graph neural network methods to be applicable to signed networks, using an approach based on balance theory¬†[ref]24. However, its design is mainly aimed at undirected graphs. SiGAT\n0 utilizes a graph attention mechanism based on  to learn node embeddings for signed, directed graphs, using a novel motif-based GNN architecture based on balance theory and status theory¬†. Subsequently, SDGNN by  builds upon this work by increasing its efficiency and proposing a new objective function. In a similar vein, SNEA¬†1 proposes a signed graph neural network for link sign prediction based on a novel objective function. In a different line of work, 2 proposes SSSNET, a GNN not based on balance theory designed for semi-supervised node clustering in signed (and possibly directed) graphs. A concurrent preprint, SigMaNet¬†3, proposes a signed magnetic Laplacian to construct a spectral GNN.222After the initial submission of this work we became aware of a concurrent work¬† by another research group which developed a network similar to ours independently at the same time.\nAdditionally, several GNNs¬†  0\nhave been introduced for multi-relational graphs, i.e., graphs with different types of edges. In such networks, the number of learnable parameters typically increases linearly with the number of edge types. Signed graphs, at least if the graph is unweighted or the weighting function wùë§w only takes finitely many values, can be thought of as special cases of multi-relational graphs. However, in the context of (possibly weighted) signed graphs, there is an implicit relationship between the different edge types, namely that a negative edge is interpreted as the opposite of a positive edge and that edges with large weights are deemed more important than edges with small weights. These relationships will allow us to construct a network with significantly fewer trainable parameters than if we were considering an arbitrary multi-relational graph.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: in the associated eigenbasis. 9 defines a directed graph Laplacian by generalizing identities involving the undirected graph Laplacian and the stationary distribution of a random walk.
