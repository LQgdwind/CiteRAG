      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Graphs via Hierarchical Semantic Environments\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the Euclidean domain, such as computer vision, OOD generalization has been studied extensively using a variety of strategies, such as Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) [ref]2, data augmentation , and domain adaptation methods .\nUnlike deep neural networks with ERM, which suffer performance degradation under data distributional shifts, IRM-based studies   have shown powerful and robust performance when providing environmental information.\nRecently, a two-step optimization framework EIIL  has been proposed to train the invariant learning model without explicit environment labels. EIIL trains the environment inference model to learn and infer the environment labels in the first step, and in the second step, EIIL uses inferred environments to conduct invariant learning. Other recent approaches, such as ZIN [ref]29, HRM [ref]31, KerHRM, and EDNIL 7 improve the OOD generalization by augmenting the environment to address its high heterogeneity. These augmentation strategies, such as the assistant model, clustering-based model, or effective diversification objective function all enhance the learning stage to infer diverse environments for effective invariant learning. While general invariant learning methods are effective for the Euclidean domain, challenges arise when applying them to non-Euclidean domains like graph structures. In the realm of graph invariant learning, since graph data have an inherent nature of complex distribution shifts, often lacks explicit environment labels. To address this issue, methodologies have been widely developed and implemented. Approaches such as EERM , LiSA , and GREA  proposed to generate new environments, offering effective strategies to discover invariant patterns without environment label knowledge. While methods like MoleOOD  and GIL focus on the inference of environments, providing solutions to deal with challenging or unexplored environments. Another dimension of exploration involves learning with auxiliary assistance to ensure sufficient variation, with typical techniques found in CIGA , GALA. Collectively, these innovative methods offer detailed strategies to navigate the challenges inherent in graph invariant learning.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: In the Euclidean domain, such as computer vision, OOD generalization has been studied extensively using a variety of strategies, such as Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) [ref]2, data augmentation , and domain adaptation methods .\nUnlike deep neural networks with ERM, which suffer performance degradation under data distributional shifts, IRM-based studies   have shown\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
