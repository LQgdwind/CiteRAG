      "content": "Paper Title: Parametric PGD model used with orthogonal polynomials to assess efficiently the building’s envelope thermal performance\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the literature, several parameterizations have been studied. Chinesta et al. (2013 ) and Gonzalez et al. (2012 ) proposed to use the nodal values corresponding to the piece-wise linear finite element approximation of the problem. However, according to Gonzalez et al. (2014 ), this method leads to a large number of degrees of freedom: their model is made of one parameter per nodal values. That is why they proposed to use the POD to provide a suitable parameterization of the initial condition with the lowest number of degrees of freedom . More information can be found on this method applied to convective heat transfer in  and solid dynamics in  . One of the main drawbacks of this method is that a learning process is needed. It has an impact on the accuracy of the reduced-order basis. For this reason, the data-set used must be representative of the problem (boundary values, initial conditions, materials used). According to Gonzalez et al. (2014 ) the initial condition could be interpolated by piece-wise polynomials. However, for the specific field of solid dynamics, this approach is not the best choice, considering the behavior of the system. Another solution proposed by Poulhaon et al. (2012, ) is to use an auxiliary mesh much coarser than the one used for the solution of the problem. A projection is made from the fine to the coarse mesh using the least square method. This method is purely mathematical and does not take into account physical considerations such as energy conservation or heat flux conservation. According to Poulhaon et al. (2012, ) it should be completed by a mathematical tool to take into account the physics of the studied phenomenon. Conforming to , one important feature for the choice of an approximation basis is the sparsity. It ensures that the chosen basis has the required regularity to represent the solution. Spectral basis, such as polynomial or trigonometric functions, guarantee sparsity. For such functions, the values of the coefficients decrease exponentially with the order of approximation . However, the basis is full (because a spectral basis is not interpolative ). It implies that the computational cost needed to determine the coefficients becomes impractical for large systems. Based on the literature review, two methods are here compared: the use of a polynomials basis and the use of a POD basis to approximate the temperature profile. Details on how to build each approximation basis used are given in the appendix B. As stated by the Weierstrass approximation theorem, every continuous function on a bounded interval can be approximated by a polynomial to a certain accuracy [ref]5. Several functions with polynomial basis can then be used according to the studied problem. The most simple polynomial basis is the monomial one. As described by Peyret (2013 9), if a periodic problem is studied, the Fourier method should be used. Yet, this method is not suitable for non-periodic problems, because of the Gibbs phenomenon. In this case, orthogonal polynomials such as Chebyshev or Legendre polynomials should be used. Considering the numerous polynomial basis, the first difficulty is to select the right basis for the considered problem. As the field of interest is a non-periodic, smooth function, Fourier or Laurent polynomials shall not be studied here. According to Trefethen (2013, [ref]5), the monomial basis is comfortable but should never be used to approximate a function. If we compare the condition number for inversion of the three basis, the Chebyshev and Legendre polynomials basis have a smaller condition number than the monomial one. If the condition number of a matrix is large, the matrix is close to being singular. The condition number reveals that the projection of the field of interest on the monomial basis will be sensitive to numerical round-off errors and perturbations in the input data. Moreover, monomial basis do not meet sparsity condition as its coefficients increase with the order. Therefore, this basis should not be used here to parameterize the initial condition. According to Trefethen (2013, [ref]5), Legendre points and polynomials are neither better than Chebyshev ones for approximating functions, nor worse. The main advantage to use Chebyshev over Legendre points center around the use of FFT (Fast Fourier Transform). This function can be used to get the coefficients from the point values or the reverse. But this property is not used here. Both polynomials basis will be compared. The Chebyshev and Legendre polynomials are part of the family of orthogonal polynomials. They are calculated respectively at the Chebyshev and Legendre points. Special attention must be given to the spatial domain of the problem. The points define a non-uniform mesh for a space interval [−1,1]11[-1,1]. Thus, a change of variable must be performed to transform the dimensionless spatial domain    to x∈[−1,1]𝑥11x\\in[-1,1].\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: basis used are given in the appendix B.
