      "content": "Paper Title: A Biomedical Knowledge Graph for Biomarker Discovery in Cancer\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nResearch initiatives are gradually adopting SW technologies [ref]18 such as knowledge bases (KBs) and domain-specific ontologies as the means of building structured networks of interconnected knowledge . Hogan et al.  have provided a comprehensive review of articles on KGs, covering knowledge graph creation, enrichment, quality assessment, and refinement. Apart from these literature that focuses on the theoretical concepts, several large-scale KGs have been constructed either by manual annotation, crowd-sourcing (e.g., DBpedia) or by automatic extraction from unstructured data (e.g., YAGO)  targeting KG analytics for specific use cases.\nLife sciences is an early adaptor of SW technologies. Numerous research efforts from the scientific communities have focused on constructing large-scale KGs for life science research. For example, Bio2RDF and PubMed KG [ref]8 are developed to accelerate bioinformatics research. The former integrates 35 life sciences datasets such as dbSNP, GenAge, GenDR, LSR, OrphaNet, PubMed, SIDER, WormBase, contributing 11 billion RDF triples. Alshahrani et al. , built a biological KG based on the gene ontology (GO), human phenotype ontology (HPO), and disease ontology. Then they performed feature learning over the KG. Their method combines knowledge representation using symbolic logic and automated reasoning, with neural networks to generate embeddings of nodes. Then the learned embeddings are used in downstream application development such as link prediction, finding candidate genes of diseases, protein-protein interactions, and drug target relation prediction. Hasan et al.  developed a prototype KG based on the Louisiana Tumor Registry dataset333https://sph.lsuhsc.edu/louisiana-tumor-registry/. Their approach provides scenario-specific querying, schema evolution for iterative analysis, and data visualization. Although the KG found to be effective at population-level treatment sequences, it is built on a limited data setting, does not provide comprehensive knowledge about cancer genomics for the majority of the cancer types. Hu et al.  developed a breast cancer KG by integrating: i) Dutch medical guidelines444A semantic representation of Dutch medical guidelines. that contain conclusions and their evidences with UMLS and SNOMED CT medical terminologies, ii) genomic data of female patients, iii) clinical trials from official NCT website, iv) semantic annotations w.r.t eligibility criteria generated with XMedLan555A Xerox NLP tool for medical text., iv) selected medical publications from PubMed released by the Linked Life Data666A semantic data integration platform for biomedical domain..\nAlthough these KGs can be used to explore the relationship among knowledge and data sources of breast cancer and support for clinical DSS, no comprehensive KBs or KGs have been developed targeting a wide variety of cancer types to date. In biomedical treatment protocols, structured data is first extracted from various unstructured sources such as pathology reports, radiology reports, and medical records, before storing them in a database for reporting and diagnosis purposes. In hospital information systems or electronic health records, the cancer registry data is typically categorized for each reported cancer case or tumor at the time of diagnosis . Besides, it may contain demographic information about the patient such as age, gender, location at time of diagnosis, planned and completed primary treatment information, and survival outcomes . Cancer-related scientific articles that report unstructured data also provide facts and knowledge about cancer characteristics, treatments, and outcomes. Extracting information from structured data is straightforward, extracting the same from unstructured data maybe highly domain specific. A concrete example is cancer-specific biomarker. Shen et al.  have reported that some genes have both oncogenic and tumor-suppressor functionality called proto-oncogenes with tumor-suppressor function (POTSF). The majority of POTSF genes act as transcription factors or kinases and exhibit dual biological functions, e.g., they both positively and negatively regulate transcription in cancer cells . Besides, specific cancer types like leukemia are over-represented by POTSF genes, whereas some common cancer types like lung cancer are under-represented by them . Apart from the oncogenes and protein-coding genes, proto-oncogenes are a group of genes that cause normal cells to become cancerous when they are mutated . Oncogenes result from the activation of proto-oncogenes, whereas a POSTF itself cause cancer when they are inactivated. For example, TP53 is a POTSF and abnormalities of TP53 have been found in more than half of human cancers777www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/genetics/genes-and-cancer/oncogenes-tumor-suppressor-genes.html. Mutations in proto-oncogenes are typically dominant and the mutated version of a proto-oncogene is called an oncogene . Since structured and unstructured data about cancer is constantly expanding and evolving, linking large-scale heterogeneous data sources is challenging, as heterogeneous data sources often do not follow any common data-storing standard . Feature- or kernel-based methods such as the conditional random field (CRF) are earlier approaches used for the NER and RE in a pipeline setting . However, performance of traditional approaches heavily depends on manual feature engineering, domain-specific knowledge, and a deep understanding of linguistics . Therefore, approaches based on DNNs have emerged that are not only capable of automatic extraction of structured knowledge, but also leverage end-to-end learning capability . Lately, several deep architectures based on recurrent types of neural networks have been proposed for entity recognition and RE. Approaches based on Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Unit cells are more widely used . For example, Geng et al.  used a Bi-LSTM network with a subsequent CRF, where inputs to the Bi-LSTM are concatenated word representations that combine pre-trained contextual word embeddings using embeddings from language models (ELMo) , character-level word representations, and positional features of the word in the document. Joint entity and REn approaches are also proposed. Zhang et al.  used joint-BiLSTM -a joint tagging method that can transform both tasks into sequence tagging through parameter sharing in an end-to-end learning setting. Although Bi-LSTM approaches outperform CRF-based approaches, their shortcoming lies in the incapability of semantic annotation and validation of the extracted entities and relations, i.e., not all relations can be represented by triggered words [ref]29. Recently, transformer language models have become the de-facto standard for representation learning in NLP, as it is feasible to perform domain-specific fine-tuning in a transfer learning setting. Compared to transformer models that benefit from abundant knowledge from pre-training and strong feature extraction capability, approaches based on Bi-LSTM have a lower generalization performance . Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)  is a language model that utilizes the bidirectional attention mechanism and large-scale unsupervised corpora to obtain effective context-sensitive representations of words in a sentence . Several variants of BERT are proposed and widely used as transformer language models for a variety of downstream NLP tasks like NER. Sun et al. [ref]29 employed a transformer for predicting entity labels, where word representations are obtained from a pre-trained BERT model. BERT-based approaches have also been applied to scientific texts (e.g, SciBERT ) and adapted in other domains such as ChemBERTa  in chemical engineering for molecular property prediction.\nXu et al. [ref]8 have shown that bio-entity extraction based on BioBERT  can significantly outperform DNN-based methods. This makes transformer-based language models of a great potential for tasks involving information extraction, information retrieval. Subsequently, SW technologies can be more effective for extracting knowledge from unstructured texts with high accuracy . In other words, an ontology-guided information extraction method needs to be combined with state-of-the-art transformer language models.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: Research initiatives are gradually adopting SW technologies [ref]18 such as knowledge bases (KBs) and domain-specific ontologies as the means of building structured networks of interconnected knowledge .
