      "content": "Paper Title: Meta-learning for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation with closed-form solvers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTreatment effects are often heterogeneous across individuals.\nFor instance, the effects of medical treatment (e.g., drug administration) on health status differ across patients,\nand those of online advertisement on purchase decision\nvary depending on consumers.\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest\nin the estimation of such heterogeneous treatment effects\nas it allows us to make data-driven decision making in various fields,\nsuch as precision medicine [ref]6  ,\npersonalized advertisement    ,\nand educational program design . To measure the heterogeneity in treatment effects,\nexisting methods use a conditional average treatment effect (CATE),\nwhich is defined as an average treatment effect across individuals\nwith identical feature attributes.\nTo accurately estimate the CATE, many of these methods fit complex machine learning models to large-scale observational data    [ref]22 [ref]10.\nHowever, preparing such large-scale observational data can be difficult.\nIn the case of medical treatment, for example,\nthere are many small hospitals (with fewer than 100 beds ),\nand each hospital has a different patient population\nin feature attributes, outcome, and treatment preference.\nTo widen the scope of applications,\nit is crucial to develop a strategy for estimating a CATE from\na small observational dataset by effectively leveraging the information from other datasets\nwhile taking into account the population difference. This article proposes such a CATE estimation strategy based on meta-learning,\nwhich has been successfully used in classification and regression tasks .\nThe goal of meta-learning is to improve the test performance\nwhen there are only a few data in a test task.\nThe key idea is to use the data from various tasks to extract\nthe task-shared knowledge,\nwhich serves as the prior knowledge that is helpful for unseen tasks.\nThis idea is also practical for the CATE estimation tasks.\nTo see this, revisit the aforementioned medical treatment example\nand consider the tasks of estimating the CATE from patient records for each hospital.\nTo build a CATE estimation model for unseen small hospitals with only a few patient records,\nwe need to effectively extract prior knowledge from the records from many other hospitals,\nwhich is exactly the above idea of meta-learning. Following this idea, as illustrated in Figure 1,\nwe consider the following meta-learning problem setup.\nSuppose that we are given multiple meta-training tasks,\neach of which contains a large number of observational data on\nthe features, outcomes, and treatments of individuals.\nHere a task refers to a CATE estimation task on a treatment.\nOur goal is to improve the CATE estimation performance on unseen tasks with only a few data,\nwhere\nthe population in the unseen tasks is different from the meta-training tasks,\nbut related to some of the meta-training tasks. Developing a meta-learning approach for CATE estimation faces\ntwo main challenges.\nThe first challenge is computational complexity for solving the bi-level optimization problem for meta-learning .\nThis bi-level problem consists of the inner and outer optimization problems:\nthe former adapts task-specific parameters to each task,\nand the latter finds task-shared parameters\nthat maximize the expected test performance when adapted to each task.\nThe computational difficulty arises\nbecause we need to repeatedly solve the inner optimization problem\nfor each iteration of the outer optimization.\nA standard approach for solving this inner problem is to perform iterative optimization\nwith a gradient descent method .\nHowever, since this approach requires a large number of iterations whenever adapting to each task,\nit is computationally expensive to solve the overall bi-level optimization problem.\nTo overcome this computational challenge,\nwe formulate a CATE estimation model so that we can analytically solve the inner optimization problem\nin a closed form that is differentiable with respect to task-shared parameters.\nIn particular, our model is based on the CATE estimation framework\ncalled a meta-learner [ref]22,\nwhich decomposes the CATE estimation problem into sub-problems\nand solves each sub-problem using machine learning models called base learners.\nAs base learners, we use neural networks with task-shared and task-specific parameters\nin which the optimal task-specific parameters are obtained in a differentiable closed form for each sub-problem.\nThen, we can backpropagate the loss through the sub-problems to update the task-shared parameters for all sub-problems.\nIn Sections 3.2 and 3.3,\nwe present a formulation example with a doubly-robust learner (DR-Learner) ,\nwhich is a successfully used meta-learner that solves a two-stage regression problem [ref]10. The second challenge is that naively applying the existing meta-learning methods\nfor classification and regression\ndoes not necessarily lead to good CATE estimation performance.\nAchieving good estimation performance with such naive methods requires\nto measure the loss using the true CATE values.\nUnfortunately, however, we have no access to such true CATE values.\nThis is because a treatment effect is defined as a difference between two potential outcomes\n(i.e., the outcomes when an individual is treated and when not treated),\nwhich can never be jointly observed for each individual.\nTo resolve this issue,\nas alternatives to the true CATE values,\nin the meta-training phase,\nwe construct the pseudo CATEs by employing the estimation model fitted\nto large data in each meta-training task.\nBy minimizing the difference between these pseudo CATEs\nand the one estimated from small data in meta-training tasks,\nwe perform meta-learning such that the expected CATE estimation performance is directly improved. Our contributions are summarized as follows: We propose a meta-learning method that improves the\ntest performance of estimating CATE given a limited amount of observational data\nby minimizing the difference between a CATE estimated with large data and\none estimated with small data in various tasks. We develop a differentiable closed-form solver to adapt the CATE model to each task for effective meta-learning, where we decompose the CATE estimation problem into sub-problems that can be solved analytically. We empirically demonstrate that our proposed method achieves good CATE estimation performance in few-shot settings, where we have access to only a few instances of observational data, compared with the existing meta-learning methods.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: years, there has been a growing interest\nin the estimation of such heterogeneous treatment effects\nas it allows us to make data-driven decision making in various fields,\nsuch as precision medicine [ref]6  ,\npersonalized advertisement    ,\nand educational program design .
