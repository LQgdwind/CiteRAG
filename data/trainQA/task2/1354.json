      "content": "Paper Title: Distilling Optimal Neural Networks: Rapid Search in Diverse Spaces\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOver time, methods in the NAS literature have evolved from prohibitively expensive but holistic and diverse search methods   2 to lower cost approaches that search in more restrictive non-diverse search spaces  1. This work, DONNA, aims at benefiting from the best of both worlds: rapid search in diverse spaces. We refer the interested reader to the existing dedicated survey of Elsken et al.  for a broader discussion of the NAS literature. Early approaches to NAS rely on reinforcement learning   2 or evolutionary optimization . These methods allow for diverse search spaces, but at infeasibly high costs due to the requirement to train thousands of models for a number of epochs throughout the search. MNasNet 2 for example uses up to 40,000 epochs in a single search. This process can be sped up by using weight sharing among different models, as in ENAS . However, this comes at the cost of a less diverse search space, as the subsampled models have to be similar for the weights to be shareable. In another line of work, differentiable architecture search methods such as DARTS , FBNet 8, FBNetV2 5, ProxylessNAS , AtomNAS  and Single-Path NAS 1 simultaneously optimize the weights of a large supernet and its architectural parameters.\nThis poses several impediments to scalable and scenario-aware NAS in diverse search spaces. First, in most of these works, different cell choices have to be available to the algorithm, ultimately limiting the space’s size and diversity. While several works address this problem either by trading off the number of architecture parameters against the number of weights that are in GPU memory at a given time , by updating only a subset of the weights during the search 0, or by exploiting more granular forms of weight-sharing 1, the fundamental problem remains when new operations are introduced. Second, although differentiable search methods speed up a single search iteration, the search must be repeated for every scenario due to their coupling of accuracy and complexity. Differentiable methods also require differentiable cost models.\nTypically these models use the sum of layer latencies as a proxy for the network latency, which can be inaccurate. This is especially the case in emerging depth-first processors , where intermediate results are stored in the local memory, making full-graph latency depend on layer sequences rather than on individual layers. To improve the scaling performance of NAS across different scenarios, it is critical to decouple the accuracy prediction of a model from the complexity objective. In Once-for-All (OFA)  and , a large weight-sharing supernet is trained using progressive shrinking. This process allows the sampling of smaller subnets from the trained supernet that perform comparably with models that have been trained from scratch. A large number of networks can then be sampled to build an accuracy predictor for this search space, which in turn can be used in a scenario-aware evolutionary search, as in Figure 1(c).\nAlthough similar to DONNA in this approach, OFA  has several disadvantages. First, its search space’s diversity is limited due to its reliance on progressive shrinking and weight sharing, which requires a fixed macro-architecture in terms of layer types, attention, activations, and channel widths.\nFurthermore, progressive shrinking can only be parallelized in the batch dimension, limiting the maximum number of GPUs that can process in parallel. DONNA does not suffer from these constraints. Similarly, Blockwisely-Supervised NAS (DNA) [ref]18, splits NAS into two phases: the creation of a ranking model for a search space and a targeted search to find the highest-ranked models at a given constraint. To build this ranking model, DNA uses blockwise knowledge distillation (BKD) to build a relative ranking of all possible networks in a given search space. The best networks are then trained and verified. It is crucial to note that it is BKD that\nenables the diverse search for optimal attention mechanisms, activation functions, and channel scaling. However, DNA has three disadvantages: (1) the ranking model fails when ranking large and diverse search spaces (Section 3.2), (2) the ranking only holds within a search space and does not allow the comparison of different spaces, and (3) because of the reliance on training subsampled architectures from scratch, the method is not competitive in terms of search time. This work, DONNA, addresses all these issues. In summary, DONNA differs from prior work on these key aspects: Unlike OFA , DONNA enables hardware-aware search in diverse search spaces; differentiable and RL-/evolutionary-based methods can do this too, but using much more memory or training time, respectively. DONNA scales to multiple accuracy/latency targets, requiring only marginal cost for every new target. This is in contrast with differentiable or RL-/evolutionary-based methods, where the search has to be repeated for every new target. DONNA uses a novel accuracy predictor which correlates better with training-from-scratch accuracy than prior work like DNA [ref]18 (See Figure 4). Furthermore, the DONNA accuracy predictor generalizes to unseen search spaces due to its reliance on block quality metrics, not on the network configuration (See Figure 7). DONNA relies on a fast finetuning method that achieves the same accuracy as training-from-scratch while being 9×9\\times faster, reducing the training time for found architectures compared to DNA [ref]18.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: be parallelized in the batch dimension, limiting the maximum number of GPUs that can process in parallel.
