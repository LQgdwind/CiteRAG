      "content": "Paper Title: Explain and Conquer: Personalised Text-based Reviews to Achieve Transparency\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe most widespread methods to suggest new dyads in general networks are recommender systems. Learning to explain these recommendations is a hard task to do. The difficulty to generate and assess the explanations from the human perspective as well as the definition of standard evaluation frameworks has led to a myriad of approaches regarding explanation in this context. However, existing explainable recommender systems usually consider explanation as a side output of the recommendation model. Such models do not address explainability as the main task [ref]10. In these works, some approaches leverage deep neural networks and propose both feature extraction and explanation as a text retrieval task, using the available reviews written by the users. The DeepCoNN (Deep Cooperative Neural Network) [ref]11 consists of two parallel CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) coupled in the last layers. One of the networks focuses on learning user behaviours exploiting reviews written by them, whereas the other one learns item properties from the reviews written for the item. Although this model represents both users and items in a joint manner using reviews, the text retrieval task is centred only on the feature extraction rather than on the explanation. TransNets  is an extension of the previous DeepCoNN model, which introduces an extra latent layer representing the user-target item pair. This model introduces the situation where the item is presented to the user before he/she have experienced it (i.e., no real review is available for that pair). Thus, it predicts an approximate and personalised representation of the target review, but only for feature extraction in rating prediction tasks. NARRE (Neural Attentional Regression model with Review-level Explanations)  is another two parallel neural networks model based on attention mechanisms which describes both users and items in latent representations. It predicts precise ratings, learning the usefulness of each review. The highly-useful reviews obtained from the attention scores are presented as the review-level explanations. However, these partial explanations are side outputs of NARRE. Moreover, it is based on CNN transformations to extract the semantic features, rather than using state-of-the-art transformers. DER (Dynamic Explainable Recommender)  is a similar sentence-level CNN approach with attention mechanisms that takes into account the dynamic behaviour of user preferences over time, accounting for a time-aware GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit). It predicts ratings, providing adaptive recommendation explanations according to the user dynamic preference. Again, it has the same problems as NARRE. NERAR (Neural Explainable Recommender model based on Attributes and Reviews)  combines the processing of item and user attributes (using a tree-based model) with the semantic features of reviews. This model uses a time-aware GRU to handle user preferences over time and CNN transformations to extract the semantic features of text. Again, it relies on a side output depending on the attention scores to provide partial explanations and it does not leverage state-of-the-art transformers to handle reviews. Interestingly, there are attempts [ref]10 to achieve standard evaluation of explainability for recommendations, following a ranking-oriented task. A more different set of approaches focus on the text generation task to explain  [ref]17  or use pre-built templates   . Other methods use visual data proposing image segmentation as part of the explanation to the recommendation   . Finally, textual counterfactual explanations for neural-based recommender systems are also explored in this field . To the best of our knowledge, most approaches in the hospitality sector only focus on rating prediction tasks, sometimes considering side outputs which partially attain explainability. However, the idea of review-level explanation in a text retrieval task has not been widely explored in social networks yet. We propose a LTR task to explain dyadic data considering, but not limited to, the hospitality context of TripAdvisor.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: this context. However, existing explainable recommender systems usually consider explanation as a side output of the recommendation model. Such models do not address explainability as the main task [ref]10. In these works, some approaches leverage deep neural networks and propose both feature extraction and explanation as a text retrieval task, using the available reviews written by the users.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
