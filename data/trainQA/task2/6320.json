RNN-based methods  [ref]24  have been shown more accurate than program analysis tools such as Checkmarx  and RATS  to predict function-level vulnerabilities.\nHowever, RNNs face difficulty in capturing long-term dependencies in long sequences as the model’s sequential nature may result in the loss of earlier sequence information.\nFurthermore, function-level predictions lack the required granularity to accurately identify the root causes of vulnerabilities.\nThus, researchers have proposed transformer-based methods that predict statement-level vulnerabilities and capture long-term dependencies  7 while ICVH  leverages bidirectional RNNs with information theory to detect statement-level vulnerabilities.\nOn the other hand, Zhou et al.  embed the abstract syntax tree (AST), control flow graph (CFG), and data flow graph (DFG) for a code function and learn the graph representations for function-level predictions. Nguyen et al.  proposed constructing a code graph as a flat sequence for function-level predictions. Hin et al.  constructed program dependency graphs (PDGs) for functions and predicted statement-level vulnerabilities. In contrast to the above methods, we propose a deep learning-based vulnerability matching method inspired by the principles of program analysis security tools. Specifically, we gather a group of vulnerability patterns from the training set and develop a vulnerability codebook using optimal transport 6 and vector quantization . Our goal is to detect statements caused the vulnerabilities by matching functions with the representative patterns we have learned in our codebook.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: Researchers have proposed various deep learning-based vulnerability detections (VDs) such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) , recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [ref]24  , graph neural networks (GNNs)   [ref]22   , and pre-trained transformers   7 .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
