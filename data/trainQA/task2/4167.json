All environments have 25% label noise, as in [ref]7. For all experiments on MNIST, we use a two-layer perceptron consistent with previous works  [ref]7 [ref]9. Moving beyond simple binary classification, we use small NORB , an object recognition dataset, to create a challenging setup with multi-valued classes and attributes over realistic 3D objects. It consists of images of toys of five categories\nwith varying lighting, elevation, and azimuths. The objective is to classify unseen samples of the five categories.  introduced single-attribute shifts for this dataset. We combine the Causal shift, 𝑨c​a​u​s​e=l​i​g​h​t​i​n​gsubscript𝑨𝑐𝑎𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔\\bm{A}_{cause}\\>=lighting wherein there is a correlation between lighting condition l​i​g​h​t​i​n​gi𝑙𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖𝑛subscript𝑔𝑖lighting_{i} and toy category yisubscript𝑦𝑖y_{i}; and Independent shift, 𝑨i​n​d=a​z​i​m​u​t​hsubscript𝑨𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑧𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑡ℎ\\bm{A}_{ind}\\>=azimuth that varies independently across domains, to generate our multi-attribute dataset l​i​g​h​t+a​z​i𝑙𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑎𝑧𝑖light+azi. Training domains have 0.9 and 0.95 spurious correlation with l​i​g​h​t​i​n​g𝑙𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔lighting whereas there is no correlation in test domain. We add 5% label noise in all environments. We use ResNet-18 (pre-trained on ImageNet) for all settings and fine tune for our task. We use the Waterbirds dataset from . This dataset classifies birds as “waterbird\" or “landbird\", where bird type (Y𝑌Y) is spuriously correlated with background (b​g​d𝑏𝑔𝑑bgd) – “waterbird\" images are spuriously correlated with “water\" backgrounds (ocean, natural\nlake) and “landbird\" images with “land\" backgrounds (bamboo forest, broadleaf forest). Since background is selected based on Y𝑌Y, 𝑨c​a​u​s​e=b​a​c​k​g​r​o​u​n​dsubscript𝑨𝑐𝑎𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑏𝑎𝑐𝑘𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑\\bm{A}_{cause}\\>=background. The dataset is created by pasting bird images from CUB dataset  onto backgrounds from the Places dataset . There is 0.95 correlation between the bird type and background during training i.e., 95% of all waterbirds are placed against a water background, while 95% of all landbirds are placed against a land background. We create training domains based on background (|ℰt​r|=|𝑨c​a​u​s​e|=2)|\\mathcal{E}_{tr}|=|\\bm{A}_{cause}\\>|=2) as in 5. We evaluate using worst-group error consistent with past work, where a group is defined as (b​a​c​k​g​r​o​u​n​d,y𝑏𝑎𝑐𝑘𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑𝑦background,y). We generate the dataset using the official code from  and use the same train-validation-test splits. To create the multi-attribute shift variant of Waterbirds, we add weather effects (𝑨i​n​dsubscript𝑨𝑖𝑛𝑑\\bm{A}_{ind}\\>) using the Automold library444https://github.com/UjjwalSaxena/Automold--Road-Augmentation-Library. We add darkness effect (darkness coefficient = 0.7) during training with 0.5 probability and rain effect (rain type = ‘drizzle’, slant = 20) with 1.0 probability during test. Hence, |𝑨i​n​d|subscript𝑨𝑖𝑛𝑑|\\bm{A}_{ind}\\>|=3 ({no effect, darkness, rain}). Weather effect is applied independent of class label Y𝑌Y. Our training domains are based on background and we perform worst-group evaluation, same as the setup described above. Examples from train and test domains for multi-attribute shift dataset are provided in Figure 6. We use ResNet-50 (pre-trained on ImageNet) for all settings consistent with past work  5. All models were evaluated at the best early stopping epoch (as measured by the validation set), again consistent with .\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: Rotated [ref]5 and Colored MNIST [ref]7 present distinct distribution shifts.
