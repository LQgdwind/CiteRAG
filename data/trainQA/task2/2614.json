      "content": "Paper Title: InSeGAN: A Generative Approach to Segmenting Identical Instances in Depth Images\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we present experiments demonstrating the empirical benefits of InSeGAN on the task of instance segmentation. We will first introduce our new synthetic dataset, Insta-10, on which most of our experiments are based. We then introduce a real-world dataset that we collected to evaluate the application of our method on (naturally noisy) depth images of real objects. Insta-10 Dataset:\nWhile there are several real-world datasets used for instance segmentation, such as MSCOCO [ref]27, and CityScapes , they typically involve background objects, and other stuff that are unrelated to the objects to be segmented. In addition, datasets such as CLEVR  are proposed for visual reasoning tasks, and thus may not fully analyze the segmentation quality.\nTo fill this gap, we introduce Insta-10, a large-scale dataset consisting of depth images of multiple instances of a CAD object model. We remove color and texture from the instances, to analyze the segmentation performance under the difficult condition in which there are minimal attributes other than shape. This is inspired by the observation that most industrial objects do not usually have textures [ref]15, in addition to the intuition that sometimes RGB could distract a shape-based segmenter. To create the dataset, we used 10 CAD object models (3 from the T-less dataset [ref]15 and 7 from our own library). We use the PhysX physics simulator333https://developer.nvidia.com/physx-sdk to simulate sequentially dropping objects into a bin, producing synthetic multiple-instance depth images. We used 5 instances of the same object in each depth image, yielding substantial inter-instance occlusion, and we selected the bin width so that instance segmentation was challenging but not too hard (even for humans). In addition to the depth images, we provide the point clouds associated with each image and ground truth instance segmentation masks; these masks are used for only evaluation, not training. We collected 10K images per object, for a total of 100K depth images in the entire dataset, each with dimension 224×224224224224\\times 224. Sample images are in Figs. 21 and 20. Real-World Depth Images Using a Robot:\nApart from the synthetic Insta-10 dataset, we also analyze the adaptability of our scheme to practical settings. For this experiment, we used a box containing 4 identical wooden blocks (see Fig. 6), of which depth images were captured using an Intel RealSense Depth Camera (D435). To produce multiple diverse images consisting of varied configurations of the blocks, we programmed a Fetch robot  to shake the box between images. We collected 3,000 depth images using this setup, of which we hand-annotated 62 images that we reserved for evaluation. The depth images from this setting are very noisy, and as a result, often the shapes of the objects do not appear to be identical. Evaluation Metric and Experimental Setting:\nTo evaluate our scheme, we use mean intersection-over-union (mIoU), a standard metric for semantic segmentation. For training and evaluation, we split the data subsets associated with each class into a training, validation, and test set. In the Insta-10 dataset, we use 100 randomly selected images for validation in each class. For the test set,\nwe selected 100 images on which KMeans fails, thereby avoiding segmentations that are trivial for standard methods. Performance Analysis: On the Insta-10 dataset, we compare our method on both non-deep and deep learning methods. The non-deep methods include classic segmentation algorithms 2  9. The deep learning comparisons include: (i) Wu et al. , which is most similar to ours; (ii) IODINE , which was proposed for scene decomposition rather than instance segmentation; and (iii) Slot Attention . We use the public code for (ii) and (iii), using their default hyper-parameters. In Table 1, we show these results. We find that for most object classes (6/10), InSeGAN outperforms all other methods. On the Stopper class, which is the most difficult, InSeGAN outperforms all other methods except for spectral clustering. Overall, InSeGAN demonstrates a relative improvement of 9.3% over the best-performing previous method (averaged across all 10 classes). We found that the recent method of IODINE  fails on our images, perhaps because it is designed for scene decomposition tasks. From Table 3, we see that our method generalizes to real data as well. In Fig. 21, we show several qualitative results produced by InSeGAN. More results are provided in the Supplementary Material.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: evaluate the application of our method on (naturally noisy) depth images of real objects.
