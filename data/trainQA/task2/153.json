      "content": "Paper Title: Distributed Training of Deep Neural Network Acoustic Models for Automatic Speech Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhen designing a distributed training strategy based on SGD, batch size and communication bandwidth are two critical factors to consider in practice for training efficiency. For data parallel SGD, the speedup is roughly proportional to the batch size under the constraints of GPU memory and model size. The more data we can parallelize in each batch the faster the training is. It is difficult to increase the number of learners while maintaining a high percentage GPU usage if the batch size is not sufficiently large. However, it is often observed that too large a batch size may hurt the convergence of SGD and eventually the performance of the model . Therefore, effectively increasing the batch size without compromising performance has been actively investigated over the years in the distributed training community [ref]9. To deal with the batch size issue, learning rate warm-up is often used. A common practice is that a large batch is learned with a large learning rate, which are roughly in proportion, but the large learning rate is achieved by gradually scaling up from a small learning rate. This strategy usually gives good performance in practice. It is also observed that larger batch sizes are possible in decentralized asynchronous SGD with partial model averaging . Bandwidth indicates how much data can be communicated per second. In parallel SGD, we always hope for a perfect overlap between communication and computation to minimize the training time. The communication takes place when data is copied from storage to memory, models/gradients are transferred between CPU and GPU and models/gradients are averaged among learners. The computation mainly involves gradient evaluation. We want to push computation-heavy operations to GPUs while reducing the communication cost. DNN models with large number of parameters require high communication bandwidth and may become the eventual bottleneck of the whole distributed training. Specialized to distributed acoustic modeling, the issue may become even more severe due to its high communication/computation ratio. First of all, loading features and labels from storage to memory may affect the training efficiency given the low bandwidth between the two. A typical way to deal with it is to run data loaders in multiple processes in parallel to pipeline data loading and perform online feature expansion if necessary. In terms of model/graident transfer, a broad variety of communication-reduction techniques have been proposed. Gradient compression approaches such as gradient quantization [ref]28[ref]29 and gradient sparsification  are used to reduce the required communication bandwidth. Partial model averaging instead of global model averaging is another way to reduce the communication cost [ref]9. When training acoustic models under discriminative sequence criteria, additional care needs to be taken with issues on storage, communication and computation in terms of training efficiency. The hypothesis space in the discriminative objective function is represented by lattices  which take significant amount of storage space. As a result, the data loading is more time-consuming compared to the CE training. On the computation side, the gradient evaluation involves the forward and backward algorithm running on lattices, which typically takes place on CPUs as it is nontrivial to express it in an efficient form of matrix multiplication suitable for GPUs. For large-scale distributed training, shallow lattices of low density are usually used to reduce the required storage space and speed up the communication and computation .\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: the performance of the model .
