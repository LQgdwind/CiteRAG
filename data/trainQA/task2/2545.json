      "content": "Paper Title: PRECODE - A Generic Model Extension to Prevent Deep Gradient Leakage\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGradient inversion attacks as studied in [ref]8 [ref]31 [ref]32  aim to reconstruct input training data x𝑥x from their corresponding gradients ∇ℒθ​(y^,y)∇subscriptℒ𝜃^𝑦𝑦\\nabla\\mathcal{L}_{\\theta}(\\hat{y},y), where θ𝜃\\theta are the parameters of the attacked model F𝐹F, y^=F​(x)^𝑦𝐹𝑥\\hat{y}=F(x) is the models prediction given the input x𝑥x, y𝑦y the expected output for x𝑥x and ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} the loss function used to optimize θ𝜃\\theta. We follow the threat model described by [ref]8, i.e., an honest-but-curious server.\nIn detail, an attacker has insight into the training process, i.e., knowledge of ℒℒ\\mathcal{L}, F𝐹F, θ𝜃\\theta and ∇ℒθ​(y^,y)∇subscriptℒ𝜃^𝑦𝑦\\nabla\\mathcal{L}_{\\theta}(\\hat{y},y), but does not actively interfere with it (honesty).\nInstead, the attacker aims to reconstruct training data (x,y)𝑥𝑦(x,y) of another client participating in the training process (curiosity).\nThis scenario is particularly relevant for collaborative training processes such as federated learning   , where a shared model is collaboratively trained by participating clients.\nData is deliberately not shared, but remains with each respective client.\nA central aggregator distributes a global model to clients, which in turn respond with model updates, i.e., gradients, after local training.\nThe clients’ gradients are then aggregated in order to update the global model.\nThis process is iteratively repeated until convergence or another termination criterion is reached.\nApart from star-based connectivity pattern with a central aggregator, other connectivity and aggregation patterns such as peer-to-peer or cluster-based collaborative training have been proposed within the federated learning paradigm   \nSince gradient information must also be exchanged in these approaches, they suffer from similar vulnerabilities. Using knowledge about ℒℒ\\mathcal{L}, F𝐹F, θ𝜃\\theta and ∇ℒθ​(y^,y)∇subscriptℒ𝜃^𝑦𝑦\\nabla\\mathcal{L}_{\\theta}(\\hat{y},y), gradient inversion attacks can generally be formulated as an optimization problem.\nAs described for Deep Leakage from Gradients (DLG) , the basic idea is to feed a random dummy image x′superscript𝑥′x^{\\prime} into a model F𝐹F to obtain a dummy gradient ∇ℒθ​(F​(x′),y′)∇subscriptℒ𝜃𝐹superscript𝑥′superscript𝑦′\\nabla\\mathcal{L}_{\\theta}(F(x^{\\prime}),y^{\\prime}) by comparison to a randomly initialized dummy label y′superscript𝑦′y^{\\prime}.\nTo reconstruct both the original input data x𝑥x and the associated output y𝑦y, the Euclidean distance between the attacked gradient and the dummy gradient is iteratively minimized using a L-BFGS optimizer .\nIn improved DLG (iDLG) [ref]32, Zhao et al. found that ground-truth labels y𝑦y can be analytically reconstructed from gradient information. Without the need to optimize for y′superscript𝑦′y^{\\prime} in Eq. 1, optimization becomes faster and more stable.\nWei et al. propose the Client Privacy Leakage (CPL) attack by extending the optimization objective of iDLG by an additive label-matching regularization term and found it to further stabilize the optimization [ref]31. Using inverting gradient attacks (IGA), Geiping et al. [ref]8 further improve the reconstruction process by disentangling gradient magnitude and direction.\nThey propose to minimize cosine distance instead of Euclidean distance between attacked and dummy gradients in Eq. 1 while using the total variation  of the dummy image x′superscript𝑥′x^{\\prime} as regularization to constrain the reconstruction to relevant image parts.\nIn addition, they found the Adam optimizer  to generally yield more sophisticated reconstruction results compared to the L-BFGS optimizer, especially for deeper models and trained models with overall smaller gradient magnitude.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: Gradient inversion attacks as studied in [ref]8 [ref]31 [ref]32  aim to reconstruct input training data x𝑥x from their corresponding gradients ∇ℒθ​(y^,y)∇subscriptℒ𝜃^𝑦𝑦\\nabla\\mathcal{L}_{\\theta}(\\hat{y},y), where θ𝜃\\theta are the parameters\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
