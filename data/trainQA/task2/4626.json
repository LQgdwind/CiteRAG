      "content": "Paper Title: Scalable Adversarial Online Continual Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRegularization-based Approach relies on a penalty term in the loss function preventing important parameters of old tasks from significant deviations. The L2-regularization strategy is combined with the parameter importance matrix indicating the significance of network parameters. Different strategies are proposed to construct the parameter importance matrix: Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) makes use of the Fisher Importance Matrix (FIM) , Synaptic Intelligence (SI) utilizes accumulated gradients , Memory Aware Synapses (MAS) adopts unsupervised and online criteria . online EWC (oEWC) puts forward an online version of EWC using Laplace approximation . Learning without Forgetting (LWF) utilizes the knowledge distillation (KD) approach to match between current and previous outputs. The regularization strategy is better performed in the neuron level rather than in the synaptic level 9 because of the hierarchical nature of the deep neural network. 7 follows the same principle as 9 and goes one step further using the concept of inter-task similarity. Such approach allows a node to be shared across related tasks. Another attempt to improve scalability of regularization-based approaches also exists in  where the projection concept is put forward to induce wide local optimum regions. The regularization-based approach heavily depends on the task-IDs and the task-boundaries. Structure-based Approach offers different philosophies where new tasks are handled by adding new network components while isolating old components to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem. The pioneering approach is the progressive neural network (PNN)  where a new network column is integrated when handling a new task. PNN incurs expensive structural complexities when dealing with a long sequence of tasks.  puts forward a network growing condition based on a loss criterion with the selective retraining strategy. The concept of neural architecture search (NAS) is proposed in 5 to select the best action when observing new tasks. Similar approach is designed in  but with the use of Bayesian optimization approach rather than the NAS concept. These approaches are computationally prohibitive and call for the presence of task IDs and boundaries. [ref]23 [ref]3 put forward a data-driven structural learning for unsupervised continual learning problems where hidden clusters, nodes and layers dynamically grow and shrink. The key difference between the two approaches lies in the use of regularization-based approach in [ref]3 via the Knowledge Distillation (KD) strategy and the use of centroid-based experience replay in [ref]23. The data-driven structural learning strategy does not guarantee optimal actions when dealing with new tasks. Memory-based Approach utilizes a tiny memory storing a subset of old data samples. Old samples of the memory are interleaved with current samples for experience replay purposes to cope with the catastrophic forgetting problem. iCaRL exemplifies such approach  where the KD approach is performed with the nearest exemplar classification strategy. GEM 6 and AGEM  make use of the memory to identify the forgetting cases. HAL  proposes the idea of anchor samples maximizing the forgetting metric and constructed in the meta-learning manner. DER  devises the dark knowledge distillation and successfully achieves improved performances with or without the task IDs. CTN is proposed in  using the feature transformation concept of  and integrates the controller network trained in the meta-learning fashion. ACL 0 is categorized as the memory-based approach where a memory is used to develop the adversarial game. However, ACL imposes considerable complexities because of the use of task-specific feature extractors and discriminators. We offer an alternative approach here where private features are induced by the feature transformation strategy of  and the adversarial game is played by one and only one discriminator. Compared to , SCALE integrates the adversarial learning strategy to train the shared feature extractor generating common features being robust to the catastrophic forgetting problem and puts forward a new combination of three loss functions.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: is designed in  but with the use of Bayesian optimization approach rather than the NAS concept.
