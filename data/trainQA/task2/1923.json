Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: RelTransformer: A Transformer-Based Long-Tail Visual Relationship Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGQA-LT & VG8K-LT Baselines. We compare RelTransformer with several state-of-the-art models. The most popular models in this benchmark are implemented based on LSVRU [ref]51 framework. To improve over the long-tail performance, baseline models usually are combined with the following strategies: 1) class-imbalance loss functions such as weighted cross entropy (WCE), equalization loss (EQL) [ref]37, focal loss , and ViLHub loss . 2) relation augmentation strategies such as RelMix  to augment more examples in long-tail relations. 3) Decoupling 7 which decouples the learning procedure into representation learning and classification. 4) Counterfactual , which alleviates the biased scene graph generation via the counterfactual learning. 5) OLTR , which has memory module with augmented attention. VG200 Baselines. We compare with several strong baselines including Visual Relationship Detection , Message Passing , Associative Embedding , MotifNet , Permutation Invariant Predication 4, LSVRU [ref]51, relationship detection with graph contrastive loss (RelDN) , GPS-Net , Visual Relationship Detection with Visual-Linguistic Knowledge (RVL-BERT)  and Relational Transformer Network (RTN) 9. Evaluation Metrics. For the GQA-LT and VG8K-LT datasets, we report the average per-class accuracy, which is commonly used for long-tail evaluation [ref]37 7 . Following the same evaluation setting as , we split the relationship classes into the many, medium, and few based on the relation frequency in the training dataset as shown in Table 1. For the VG200 dataset, following the previous evaluation setting in [ref]51 , we measure the Recall@k and mean Recall@K for predicate classification (PRDCLS), which is to predict the relation labels given the ground truth boxes and labels of the subject and object.\n\nReference markers found: [51]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]51: GQA-LT & VG8K-LT Baselines.
