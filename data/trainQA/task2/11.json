      "content": "Paper Title: MHSAN: Multi-Head Self-Attention Network for Visual Semantic Embedding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVarious computer vision applications such as image captioning, visual question answering (VQA), and image-text retrieval rely on multi-modal information from images and natural languages. Visual-semantic embedding is to map high-dimensionally represented visual and textual features in the common space where their complex relationship is captured, and it is generally assessed by image-text retrieval. The key to visual-semantic embedding is how accurately input data from each modality are expressed. One popular approach for learning the visual-semantic embedding is to employ a two-path network, which represents visual and textual data separately, using the mono-modal encoders [ref]12 [ref]4 . Recent works on two-path networks collapse the visual features into a single vector by fully connected layer [ref]12 [ref]4 or selective spatial pooling  and the textual features using the last hidden state of the recurrent neural network. However, since an image or a sentence consists of a set of sub-components, there can be various descriptions for a single image depending on where the focus is placed within the image, and it is important to propagate information about each component separately when embedding the respective semantics. Previous methods can easily identify the decisive features, but rarely consider the relative importance of each feature and complex semantics. Motivated by this observation, we propose a multi-head self-attention network for visual-semantic embedding that captures various aspects and components in images and texts. Departing from previous methods, our proposed model generates multiple attention weights focusing on different visuospatial features of the image and semantic features of the sentence in each encoder. Features with a stronger focus are considered more important and have more influence toward the final representation. By explicitly learning ‘on what point in the image’ and ‘on which word in the sentence’ to focus from various perspectives, our model provides more abundant information about visual and textual data for joint embedding. In other words, our model encodes important regions and words separately and weighs the relative importance between them, which is simply collapsed by selective spatial pooling or even single attention. We evaluate visual-semantic embedding generated by our proposed model on image-text retrieval tasks using the benchmark MS-COCO [ref]16 and Flickr30K 1 datasets. The results show that our multi-head attention network establishes the new state-of-the-art record on the two benchmark datasets. Most notably, on Flickr30K 1, our embedding network achieves the relative improvement compared to the current state-of-the-art method  by 25.4% in sentence retrieval, and 27.5% in image retrieval. On MS-COCO [ref]16, our model also outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. In addition, we perform ablation studies and visualization of the resulting attention maps to demonstrate that the proposed methods of self-attention, multi-head, and diversity regularization each meaningfully contribute to the improved performance. Contribution. Overall, our main contributions are as follows: We propose a new visual-semantic embedding network based on the multi-head self-attention module that extracts multiple aspects of semantics in visual and textual data. We demonstrate that our model successfully learns semantically meaningful joint embedding by setting new state-of-the-art records in the image-text retrieval on standard benchmark datasets: MS-COCO and Flickr30K. From the advantage of the interpretability of our model, we validate the effectiveness of multi-head self-attention and diversity regularization. While the method of generating multiple attention is used in the natural language process   , to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that generates multiple self-attention maps for image encoding as well as visual-semantic embedding.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: are expressed.
