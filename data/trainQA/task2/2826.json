      "content": "Paper Title: Structure learning in polynomial time: Greedy algorithms, Bregman information, and exponential families\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLet X=(X1,…,Xd)𝑋subscript𝑋1…subscript𝑋𝑑X=(X_{1},\\ldots,X_{d}) be a random vector with distribution 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}. The goal of structure learning is to find a DAG W=(V,E)𝑊𝑉𝐸W=(V,E), also called a Bayesian network (BN), for the joint distribution 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}.\nTraditionally, there have been two dominant approaches to Bayesian network structure learning (BNSL): Constraint-based and score-based. In constraint-based algorithms such as the PC  and MMPC  algorithms, tests of conditional independence are used to identify the structure of a DAG via exploitation of d𝑑d-separation in DAG models. Score-based algorithms such as GES  define an objective function over DAGs such as the likelihood or a Bayesian posterior, and seek to optimize this score. To formalize this, denote the space of DAGs on d𝑑d nodes by 𝖣𝖠𝖦𝖣𝖠𝖦\\mathsf{DAG} and let S:𝖣𝖠𝖦→ℝ:𝑆→𝖣𝖠𝖦ℝS:\\mathsf{DAG}\\to\\mathbb{R} be a score function. Intuitively, S𝑆S assigns to each DAG W𝑊W a “score” S​(W)𝑆𝑊S(W) that evaluates the fit between W𝑊W and 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}. In the sequel, we assume without loss of generality that the goal is to minimize the score: Although this is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, we can ask whether or not it is possible to design score functions S𝑆S which can be optimized efficiently, and whose minimizers are close to W𝑊W. In order for this problem to be well-posed, there must be a unique W𝑊W that we seek; namely, W𝑊W must be identifiable from 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}. The problem of identifiability will be taken up further in Section 4, where it will be connected to the choice of score function. For now, our primary interest is solving the problem (1). Regarding score-based learning, we highlight a subtle point: Recovering the true DAG is not necessarily the same as minimizing the score function, for instance, see Example 111 in . Score-based algorithms in general attempt to learn the true model by way of minimizing the score but it’s possible that the graph which minimizes the score could be different from the true model. In other words, the score may not always be properly calibrated to the model. This is a well-studied problem, see e.g. [ref]21  , and it is a fascinating and important open problem to better understand under what assumptions a score minimizer is also the true DAG in nonparametric settings. Solving problem (1) exactly (“exact” meaning a genuine global minimizer of (1) is returned) is known to be NP-hard  .\nSome of the earliest exact methods for score-based learning relied on the following basic idea    : Use dynamic programming to search for optimal sinks in W𝑊W, remove these sinks, and recursively find optimal sinks in the resulting subgraph. In doing so, a topological sort of W𝑊W can be learned, and from this sort, the optimal DAG can be easily learned. In other words, once the topological sort is known, finding the corresponding DAG is relatively easy. In the sequel, we refer to the problem of finding the topological sort of W𝑊W as order search. Unfortunately, searching for optimal sinks involves computing d​2d−1𝑑superscript2𝑑1d2^{d-1} local scores, which is both time and memory intensive. Recently, a new family of algorithms based on applying the idea of order search has led to significant breakthroughs in our understanding of this problem     [ref]19. Most notably, unlike the exact algorithms described above, these algorithms run in polynomial-time. The key distinction between these algorithms and exact algorithms is the clever exploitation of specific distributional (e.g. moments) or structural properties (e.g. linearity) of 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}, and as a result do not optimize a specific score function. In contrast, exact algorithms apply to any score S𝑆S, and do not require any distributional assumptions. It is tempting to want to draw connections between exact algorithms and poly-time algorithms: After all, they both rely on the same fundamental principle of order search. In this paper, we explore this connection from the perspective of greedy optimization. In particular, we will show how existing polynomial-time algorithms are special cases of a generic greedy forward-backward search algorithm for solving (1) under specific choices of S𝑆S, and show how this leads to new insights for this problem. We do not prove that this algorithm exactly solves (1) (save for the exceptional case of linear models; see Corollary 3.2), however, we provide empirical evidence to support this idea on a variety of linear and nonlinear models in Section 6. Since the score-based learning problem is NP-hard, this is of course not possible without additional assumptions. Let n𝑛n be the number of samples we observe. Each sample is a vector of the form X=(X1,…,Xd)𝑋subscript𝑋1…subscript𝑋𝑑X=(X_{1},\\ldots,X_{d}) on d𝑑d variables. In this paper, W𝑊W is used for DAGs and the vertex set is [d]={1,2,…,d}delimited-[]𝑑12…𝑑[d]=\\{1,2,\\ldots,d\\}. Naturally, we match vertex i𝑖i to the variable Xisubscript𝑋𝑖X_{i}. We denote the set of parents of a vertex i𝑖i with paW⁡(i)subscriptpa𝑊𝑖\\operatorname{pa}_{W}(i), dropping the subscript when it’s clear from context. We will also abuse notation and use W𝑊W for the adjacency matrix of the graph W𝑊W as well. Let W(i)superscript𝑊𝑖W^{(i)} denote the i𝑖ith column of W𝑊W, whose nonzero entries are precisely at the set of parents of vertex i𝑖i. Let W​[j,k]𝑊𝑗𝑘W[j,k] denote the (j,k)𝑗𝑘(j,k)th entry of the matrix.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: the graph which minimizes the score could be different from the true model.
