      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Learning Meets Mechanism Design: Key Results and Some Novel Applications\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIt signifies that all the buyers optimize their expected utility by bidding their true valuations. The main motivation behind Incentive Compatibility is to extract truthful information (i.e., truthful bidding) from buyers. The type of incentive compatibility depends on the type of equilibrium achieved with truthful bidding by buyers. If the computation of equilibrium for each buyer depends only on their local information, the auction is said to be Dominant Strategy Incentive Compatible (DSIC), whereas if the equilibrium computation depends on information about the other buyers, the auction is qualified as Bayesian Incentive Compatible (BIC). Another IC equilibrium is Ex-post IC which is stronger than BIC and weaker than DSIC. We can consider an auction as a mechanism that takes bids as inputs and computes the allocation of items and the price to be paid for the allocation of items. Then according to the Revelation Principle, For any mechanism that implements a Social Choice Function, there is a direct, incentive-compatible mechanism with the same outcome . An auction that is IC and satisfies IR is called an Optimal Auction. An auction is DSIC if for an it​hsuperscript𝑖𝑡ℎi^{th} buyer with true valuation visubscriptv𝑖\\textbf{v}_{i} (from Eq. 3) if and an auction is BIC if IC depends on the allocation rule from the proposition given below . An auction mechanism (P,t) is IC if for every i∈N𝑖𝑁i\\in N and for every v−i∈V−isubscriptv𝑖subscriptV𝑖\\textbf{v}_{-i}\\in\\textbf{V}_{-i}, The payment tisubscriptt𝑖\\textbf{t}_{i} does not depends on visubscriptv𝑖\\textbf{v}_{i} but only on P​(vi,v−i)Psubscriptv𝑖subscriptv𝑖\\textbf{P}(\\textbf{v}_{i},\\textbf{v}_{-i}) The mechanism is optimum for each player. That is for every vi∈Visubscriptv𝑖subscriptV𝑖\\textbf{v}_{i}\\in\\textbf{V}_{i}, we have Pi​(vi,v−i)∈arg⁡maxPi⁡Ui​(P​(v),t​(v);vi)subscriptP𝑖subscriptv𝑖subscriptv𝑖subscriptsubscriptP𝑖subscript𝑈𝑖Pvtvsubscriptv𝑖\\textbf{P}_{i}(\\textbf{v}_{i},\\textbf{v}_{-i})\\in\\operatorname*{\\arg\\max}_{\\textbf{P}_{i}}U_{i}(\\textbf{P}(\\textbf{v}),\\textbf{t}(\\textbf{v});\\textbf{v}_{i}) Also, an auction is IC if it satisfies the following theorem. An auction mechanism (P,t)Pt(\\textbf{P},\\textbf{t}) is IC if the Social Choice Function is weakly monotone. Further, if VisubscriptV𝑖\\textbf{V}_{i} is a convex set for all i∈N𝑖𝑁i\\in N, then for every Social Choice Function that is weakly monotone, there exist payment functions ti,∀i∈Nsubscriptt𝑖for-all𝑖𝑁\\textbf{t}_{i},\\forall i\\in N such that (P,t)Pt(\\textbf{P},\\textbf{t}) is IC. The utility function of the buyer plays an important role in the IC of an auction mechanism. If the property of a utility function satisfies the below theorem, the auction induced by these utility functions are DSIC.  \nA utility function u:R≥0m→R:𝑢→subscriptsuperscript𝑅𝑚absent0𝑅u:R^{m}_{\\geq 0}\\rightarrow R induces a DSIC auction iff u𝑢u is 1−L​i​p​s​c​h​i​t​z1𝐿𝑖𝑝𝑠𝑐ℎ𝑖𝑡𝑧1-Lipschitz w.r.t the l1subscript𝑙1l_{1} norm, non-decreasing and convex. Moreover, for such a utility function u𝑢u, Δ​uΔ𝑢\\Delta u exists almost everywhere in R≥0msubscriptsuperscript𝑅𝑚absent0R^{m}_{\\geq 0}, and wherever exists, Δ​uΔ𝑢\\Delta u gives the allocation probabilities for valuation v𝑣v and Δ​uT​v−u​(v)Δsuperscript𝑢𝑇𝑣𝑢𝑣\\Delta u^{T}v-u(v) is the corresponding payment. An optimal BIC auction mechanism becomes DSIC if the bids are mapped using monotone non-decreasing functions (known as virtual functions) and then obtain the second price auction outcome with zero reserve according to below theorems. ,[ref]11 \nThere exists a collection of monotonically non-decreasing functions ϕ¯:R≥0→R:¯italic-ϕ→subscript𝑅absent0𝑅\\bar{\\phi}:R_{\\geq 0}\\rightarrow R called virtual valuation functions such that the optimal BIC auction for selling a single item is the DSIC auction that assigns the item to the buyer with the highest virtual value ϕ¯i​(vi)subscript¯italic-ϕ𝑖subscript𝑣𝑖\\bar{\\phi}_{i}(v_{i}) provided that this value is non-negative, with ties broken in an arbitrary value-independent manner, and charges the bidders according to vi​pi​(vi)−∫0vipi​(x)​𝑑xsubscript𝑣𝑖subscript𝑝𝑖subscript𝑣𝑖superscriptsubscript0subscript𝑣𝑖subscript𝑝𝑖𝑥differential-d𝑥v_{i}p_{i}(v_{i})-\\int_{0}^{v_{i}}p_{i}(x)dx.

Let us consider a Naive mechanism,  one that consists of a set of actions and a mapping of these set of actions to a set of outcomes, defined below. A Naive Mechanism is defined as a mapping from action set A𝐴A to the possible outcomes (P,t)Pt(\\textbf{P},\\textbf{t}), i.e., <P,t>:A→𝒫×R+<\\textbf{P},\\textbf{t}>:\\textbf{A}\\rightarrow\\mathscr{P}\\times R_{+}, where P is allocation probability with P∈𝒫P𝒫\\textbf{P}\\in\\mathscr{P} and t is the payment vector. In particular for a given special action δ𝛿\\delta meaning “exiting the mechanism”,\nP​(δ)=0,t​(δ)=0formulae-sequenceP𝛿0t𝛿0\\textbf{P}(\\delta)=0,\\textbf{t}(\\delta)=0. In the case of a Naive Mechanism, the strategy s of a buyer is a mapping from the set of valuations to the actions. i.e., s:V→A:s→VA\\textbf{s}:\\textbf{V}\\rightarrow\\textbf{A}. Then, a rational buyer chooses a strategy that maximizes his utility. i.e., s(v)∈arg⁡maxs′∈SU(P(s′(v),t(s′(v));v)\\textbf{s}(v)\\in\\operatorname*{\\arg\\max}_{s^{\\prime}\\in\\textbf{S}}U(\\textbf{P}(s^{\\prime}(v),\\textbf{t}(s^{\\prime}(v));v). Whereas the direct mechanism considers strategies as valuations which is defined as below. A Direct mechanism is one that maps a set of valuations to possible outcomes. Here, action set A=VAV\\textbf{A}=\\textbf{V}. In the case of direct mechanisms, for the buyer to achieve IC and IR, v∈arg⁡maxv′∈V⁡U​(P​(v′),t​(v′);v)vsubscriptsuperscript𝑣′V𝑈Psuperscript𝑣′tsuperscript𝑣′𝑣\\textbf{v}\\in\\operatorname*{\\arg\\max}_{v^{\\prime}\\in\\textbf{V}}U(\\textbf{P}(v^{\\prime}),\\textbf{t}(v^{\\prime});v) and U​(P​(v′),t​(v′);v)≥0𝑈Psuperscript𝑣′tsuperscript𝑣′𝑣0U(\\textbf{P}(v^{\\prime}),\\textbf{t}(v^{\\prime});v)\\geq 0.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: DSIC if the bids are mapped using monotone non-decreasing functions (known as virtual functions) and then obtain the second price auction outcome with zero reserve according to below theorems. ,[ref]11 \nThere exists a collection of monotonically non-decreasing functions ϕ¯:R≥0→R:¯italic-ϕ→subscript𝑅absent0𝑅\\bar{\\phi}:R_{\\geq 0}\\rightarrow R called virtual valuation functions such that the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
