      "content": "Paper Title: Computation Rate Maximum for Mobile Terminals in UAV-assisted Wireless Powered MEC Networks with Fairness Constraint\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-assisted wireless powered mobile-edge computing (MEC) network has attracted more and more attention [ref]1    [ref]5. Due to technological advances, todayâ€™s UAVs can equip MEC servers with strong computing capabilities and energy transmitters. It can perform not only computation offloading via MEC technology [ref]6 but also wireless charging via wireless power transfer (WPT)  for mobile terminals, which need to operate computation-intensive applications but have limited computing capacity and battery lifetime. The UAV is thus suitable for building temporary MEC systems for mobile terminals in some special situations. For example, the UAV can provide service for the mobile terminals in the scenarios where base station (BS) is damaged, in the public meeting places where there is a traffic hotspot, or in the remote fields where there is a coverage hole of wireless networks. The UAV-assisted wireless powered MEC networks were previously investigated for ground terminals with fixed locations [ref]1    [ref]5. To maximize the network utility in terms of computation rate [ref]1 [ref]5 or minimize the energy consumption   , previous works optimized UAV trajectory, offloading decision, and resource allocation. Sometimes, the UAV is required to arrive at specified locations automatically, so that it can be utilized in the places that are difficult for people to reach, thereby reducing labor costs [ref]1 . The previous works solved the optimization problems by offline algorithms such as successive convex approximation [ref]1   and block coordinate descending [ref]5. The numerical results in [ref]1    [ref]5 show that these algorithms work well in the scenarios where the locations of terminals are fixed. However, terminals in practice such as smartphones, tablets, wearable devices, and tracking collars carried by wildlife  are typically in motion, and their trajectories are likely to be stochastic. To serve mobile terminals, online algorithms are needed to make decisions based on real-time information. Unfortunately, the existing algorithms designed for the terminals with fixed locations [ref]1    [ref]5 are offline algorithms, and may not work well in these scenarios since all of them need environment information a priori . In this paper, we study a UAV-assisted wireless powered MEC network where a flying UAV serves multiple mobile terminals. We aim to maximize the computation rate of all terminals while ensuring the fairness among them. Herein, considering fairness is to balance the computation performance of different terminals. We demonstrate that this problem is a joint optimization and continuous control problem of the UAV trajectory and the resource allocation of terminals, under the condition that the trajectories of terminals are stochastic. Therefore, we propose a soft actor-critic (SAC) based deep-reinforcement-learning (DRL) algorithm for trajectory planning and resource allocation (SAC-TR). Since this problem is a complex high-dimensional DRL task, SAC-TR combines off-policy and maximum entropy reinforcement learning to ensure sampling efficiency and stabilize convergence at the same time. Taking the computation rate, fairness, and reaching destination into consideration, we design the reward in SAC-TR as a heterogeneous function to satisfy multiple objectives simultaneously. The simulation results show that SAC-TR outperforms representative benchmarks in most cases. The main contributions of this paper are highlighted as follows. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide an online algorithm for trajectory planning and resource allocation for mobile terminals in the UAV-assisted wireless powered MEC network. By integrating a fairness index into the reward of SAC-TR, we guarantee the fairness among different terminals according to the needs of scenarios. By using the progress estimate in the reward of SAC-TR, the UAV can reach the specified destination automatically and the convergence of SAC-TR is accelerated. SAC-TR can converge steadily and fast adapt to unexpected changes of the environment. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we review the related works. We model the UAV-assisted wireless powered MEC network in Section III and formulate the trajectory planning and resource allocation problem in Section IV. In Section V, the detailed design of SAC-TR is given. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm by simulations in Section VI. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section VII.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-assisted wireless powered mobile-edge computing (MEC) network has attracted more and more attention [ref]1    [ref]5.
