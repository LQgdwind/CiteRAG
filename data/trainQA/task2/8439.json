Jiang et al.  propose an ‘add-then-remove’ scheme, named Dordis, which enforces a required noise level precisely and ensures the privacy budget prudently utilization considering unpredictable sampled clients drop out. Chen et al.  propose an adaptive client sampling strategy to accelerate the model convergence rate and improve model performance with privacy guarantees and data heterogeneity trade-offs. Zhang et al. [ref]22 design a heterogeneity-aware client sampling mechanism, named Fed-CBS, that effectively reduces the class-imbalance problem of the grouped datasets. Wu et al.  propose FedAMD which separates clients as anchor and miner groups to conduct gradient calculation, thus accelerating the training process and improving model performance. He et al.  propose GlueFL that alleviates the effect of staleness in client sampling and minimizes downstream bandwidth in cross-device FL via sticky sampling and mask shifting techniques. Our research differs from these earlier works   [ref]22   in two aspects. First, to precisely assess the model performance, we rigorously analyze the convergence properties of model accuracy rather than commonly utilized empirical metrics in  [ref]19. Moreover, we construct the interaction between the central server and clients as a more realistic model considering both the profit conflicts among participants and dynamic constraints in FL systems, which makes it more challenging to tackle the trade-off between the profit and training costs during the distributed on-device model training process.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: et al.  propose an adaptive client sampling strategy to accelerate the model convergence rate and improve model performance with privacy guarantees and data heterogeneity trade-offs.
