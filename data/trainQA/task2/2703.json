      "content": "Paper Title: Focus on Impact: Indoor Exploration with Intrinsic Motivation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRobotic exploration is the task of autonomously navigating an unknown environment with the goal of gathering sufficient information to represent it, often via a spatial map . This ability is key to enable many downstream tasks such as planning  and goal-driven navigation [ref]3  .\nAlthough a vast portion of existing literature tackles this problem  [ref]7 [ref]8 , it is not yet completely solved, especially in complex indoor environments.\nThe recent introduction of large datasets of photorealistic indoor environments 0 1 has eased the development of robust exploration strategies, which can be validated safely and quickly thanks to powerful simulating platforms 2 [ref]3. Moreover, exploration algorithms developed on simulated environments can be deployed in the real world with little hyperparameter tuning 3 4 5, if the simulation is sufficiently realistic. Most of the recently devised exploration algorithms exploit deep reinforcement learning (DRL) 6, as learning-based exploration and navigation algorithms are more flexible and robust to noise than geometric methods [ref]8 7 8.\nDespite these advantages, one of the main challenges in training DRL-based exploration algorithms is designing appropriate rewards. In this work, we propose a new reward function that employs the impact of the agent actions on the environment, measured as the difference between two consecutive observations 9, discounted with a pseudo-count 0 for previously-visited states (see Fig 1).\nSo far, impact-based rewards 9 have been used only as an additional intrinsic reward in procedurally-generated (e.g. grid-like mazes) or singleton (i.e. the test environment is the same employed for training) synthetic environments.\nInstead, our reward can deal with photorealistic non-singleton environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply impact-based rewards to this setting. Recent research on robot exploration proposes the use of an extrinsic reward based on occupancy anticipation .\nThis reward encourages the agent to navigate towards areas that can be easily mapped without errors. Unfortunately, this approach presents a major drawback, as this reward heavily depends on the mapping phase, rather than focusing on what has been already seen. In fact, moving towards new places that are difficult to map would produce a very low occupancy-based reward. Moreover, the precise layout of the training environments is not always available, especially in real-world applications.\nTo overcome these issues, a different line of work focuses on the design of intrinsic reward functions, that can be computed by the agent by means of their current and past observations. Some examples of recently proposed intrinsic rewards for robot exploration are based on curiosity 1, novelty 8, and coverage [ref]7. All these rewards, however, tend to vanish with the length of the episode because the agent quickly learns to model the environment dynamics and appearance (for curiosity and novelty-based rewards) or tends to stay in previously-explored areas (for the coverage reward). Impact, instead, provides a stable reward signal throughout all the episode 9. Since robot exploration takes place in complex and realistic environments that can present an infinite number of states, it is impossible to store a visitation count for every state. Furthermore, the vector of visitation counts would consist of a very sparse vector, and that would cause the agent to give the same impact score to nearly identical states. To overcome this issue, we introduce an additional module in our design to keep track of a pseudo-count for visited states. The pseudo-count is estimated by a density model trained end-to-end and together with the policy.\nWe integrate our newly-proposed reward in a modular embodied exploration and navigation system inspired by that proposed by Chaplot et al. [ref]7 and consider two commonly adopted collections of photorealistic simulated indoor environments, namely Gibson 1 and Matterport 3D (MP3D) 0. Furthermore, we also deploy the devised algorithm in the real world. The results in both simulated and real environments are promising: we outperform state-of-the-art baselines in simulated experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in real-world experiments. We make the source code of our approach and pre-trained models publicly available111https://github.com/aimagelab/focus-on-impact.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: with the goal of gathering sufficient information to represent it, often via a spatial map .
