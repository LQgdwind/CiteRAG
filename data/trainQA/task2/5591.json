In all of our experiments, we use a pre-trained CLIP encoder We use the HuggingFace implementation of CLIP with the publicly available checkpoint based on a ViT-L/14 vision transformer. See https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-large-patch14. Unless stated otherwise, we compute decomposable approximations of embeddings using Proposition¬†4 with Œ±zi=1nisubscriptùõºsubscriptùëßùëñ1subscriptùëõùëñ\\alpha_{z_{i}}=\\frac{1}{n_{i}} and Œ≤z=‚àè1nisubscriptùõΩùëßproduct1subscriptùëõùëñ\\beta_{z}=\\prod\\frac{1}{n_{i}}. We use different datasets that have a compositional nature: MIT-states¬† and UTZappos¬†, that are image classification datasets where labels are pairs attribute‚Äìobject; CelebA¬†[ref]33 and Waterbirds¬† in which images have a label and a spurious attribute; and DeepFashion2¬† with PerVL annotations from¬†[ref]14, where the goal is to retrieve object instances from different contexts. We also include a visualization of ideal words using a CLIP-guided diffusion model (Stable Diffusion 2.1222https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1)¬†[ref]43. We emphasize that our goal is not to achieve state-of-the-art results, although we will see that linear manipulations can be surprisingly effective and sometimes outperform significantly more complex methods. Rather, we aim to show that linear decomposable structures in embedding spaces provide a useful conceptual and practical framework for understanding and controlling the behavior of pre-trained VLMs.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: We use different datasets that have a compositional nature: MIT-states¬† and UTZappos¬†, that are image classification datasets where labels are pairs attribute‚Äìobject; CelebA¬†[ref]33 and Waterbirds¬† in which images have a label and a spurious attribute; and DeepFashion2¬† with PerVL annotations from¬†[ref]14, where the goal is to retrieve object instances from different\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
