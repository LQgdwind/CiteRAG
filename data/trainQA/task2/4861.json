      "content": "Paper Title: Hypergraphs for multiscale cycles in structured data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIntricate spatial structures are a hallmark of many complex and natural systems. The movement of individuals through space is one example of a natural system where understanding the spatial (or spatio-temporal) structures is key for distilling mechanistic insights from complex data [ref]37.\nSince complex systems tend to produce complicated and highly correlated data, a purely descriptive exploratory analysis offers only limited insights. Model-based analysis, by contrast, suffers from (i) a lack of reliably useful mathematical or computer models; and (ii) the statistical challenges in fitting such models against data and in choosing the most appropriate model¬†. The analysis of models and data with topological data analysis (TDA) is gaining increasing traction. Persistent homology (PH), a prominent tool in TDA, computes a geometric summary of the structure and shape of complex systems, including spatio-temporal mathematical models   . Persistent homology builds a collection of discrete approximations on the data called simplicial complexes, computes topological invariants, such as homology, which provides a summary of topological features (e.g.¬†connected components, loops, and voids).\nCrucially, the PH algorithm involves the construction of a so-called filtration of simplicial complexes from the data, which quantifies the persistence of topological features in the data across changes in scale and resolution   . In this way, a threshold parameter value often required in data analysis is sidestepped. Persistent homology provides a multiscale analysis of connectivity inherent in data. The powerful algebraic representation that encodes the topological features in persistent homology can be visualised by a persistence diagram (see Figure¬†1(A)).\nA persistence diagram is a multiset (a generalisation of the conventional set where elements can appear more than once). Each (x,y)ùë•ùë¶(x,y) point in the persistence diagram corresponds to a topological feature in the dataset; the importance of a topological feature is measured by its persistence, i.e.¬†the norm |y‚àíx|ùë¶ùë•|y-x| of the corresponding point in the multiset. Much statistical machinery has been developed to vectorise persistence diagrams for statistical or machine learning  9. Recent work has studied persistence diagrams with simplicial complexes . PH analysis has led to parameter inference, pattern detection and non-trivial associations in highly structured and complex data     9 . Since its inception some 20 years ago, topological data analysis and persistent homology have proven to be (often vastly) more informative than conventional summary statistics of complex data. However, it is often more important to identify the likely cause of certain topological features than to merely characterise the full topology. Recent progress in extracting generators of persistence diagrams, i.e.¬†vertices in the dataset that form a cycle corresponding to a specific (x,y)ùë•ùë¶(x,y) point in the persistence diagram, has inspired new research that utilises generators as geometric and spatial features of data     . For example, generators can localise the specific subchain responsible for the entanglement that distinguishes knotted and unknotted homologous proteins . But different choice of vertices for the same topological feature can lead to different descriptions and interpretations of data. Here, we extend topological data analysis from one generator to all generators. To overcome the potential complications arising from the non-uniqueness of generators we develop two complementary approaches: matroid generators, which are efficiently computed using matroid theory , and minimal generators  , which we tailor to sequential datasets. We encode each generator as a hyperedge which forms the PH-hypergraph. The PH-hypergraph encodes both local (geodesic) and global (Euclidean) geometric information of the data  . The PH-hypergraph can be analysed using the armoury of modern graph theory and network science. Rather than applying PH to study network data  5, we use network theory to analyse persistent homology. We show that hypergraph centrality measures and community detection distil information and insights from persistent homology generators. We refer to the full pipeline as hyperTDA, as it combines hypergraph theory and topological data analysis (TDA). We show that hyperTDA can detect higher-order topological structures that are not captured by conventional TDA; moreover, it is robust to noisy data and to different choices of generators. We showcase hyperTDA on a wide range of datasets and highlight its ability to detect and quantify aspects of complex spatio-temporal data.\nMotivated by protein carbon backbone  and animal movement trajectories [ref]37, here we analyse curves in three-dimensional space. Each curve can be translated into data as a collection of ordered vertices in 3-space and the number of vertices is the length of the curve.\nWe first consider two synthetic datasets: (i) two ‚Äúhand-drawn‚Äù curves to illustrate the concepts presented\nand then 800 random curves of four different lengths.\nOur next dataset, called the AnDi trajectories, consists of curves generated by five anomalous diffusion models  . Lastly, we examine movement tracks, which is a collection of experimental movement trajectories from nematodes moving in an agar plate and from zebrafish embryos migrating towards a wound 7 . Tracks of nematodes consist of vertices in two dimensions; therefore, we convert the data into vertices in three dimensions by encoding the time variable in the zùëßz-coordinate.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: movement of individuals through space is one example of a natural system where understanding the spatial (or spatio-temporal) structures is key for distilling mechanistic insights from complex data [ref]37.\nSince complex systems tend to produce complicated and highly correlated data, a purely descriptive exploratory analysis offers only limited insights.
