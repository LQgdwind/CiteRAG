      "content": "Paper Title: Taming the Tail in Class-Conditional GANs: Knowledge Sharing via Unconditional Training at Lower Resolutions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the past few years, research on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)  has led to remarkable advances in generating realistic images [ref]2 [ref]16 [ref]40. Conditional GANs  (cGANs) have garnered particular attention due to their ability to accept user inputs which can additionally guide the generation process. They enable a wide range of applications such as class-conditional image generation , image manipulation¬†, image-to-image translation , super-resolution  and text-to-image synthesis . Despite the advances, past research on cGANs has primarily focused on learning from balanced data. In real-world scenarios, however, data often follows a power-law distribution, with a few classes dominating most of the training data. This is referred to as the ‚Äúlong-tail (LT) problem‚Äù , where most of the training data come from a few classes (referred to as the ‚Äúhead‚Äù of the distribution). In contrast, data from a large number of classes rarely occur (referred to as the ‚Äútail‚Äù of the distribution). This imbalance in data poses a challenge to the effective learning of tail classes, as standard machine learning algorithms tend to favor densely sampled regions of the input distribution. Although there has been a surge of interest in the long-tail problem in recent years, the focus has been primarily on recognition tasks . Generative learning on the long-tail data, particularly cGANs which is the focus of this work, remains underexplored. Recently, ¬†  identified mode collapse on tail classes as a result of the spectral norm explosion in class-conditional BatchNorms and the collapse of the latents in the StyleGANs ùí≤ùí≤\\mathcal{W} space. While techniques such as regularization, normalization, and/or class-balancing techniques  might improve the performance of long-tail generative models to some extent, their effectiveness is limited. The primary challenge in the long-tail problem is the under-representation of tail classes in the training data, e.g., in Fig.¬†1 each tail class contains merely 2 training images, resulting in insufficient observation of the tail classes by the learning algorithm. To address this challenge, we propose leveraging the abundant information inherent in the head classes, with the aim to learn and infuse knowledge from the head classes into the tail ones, thereby enriching the training distribution for the latter.\nNevertheless, explicitly disentangling the class-specific information pertaining to head classes from class-independent information, shared between head and tail classes, poses a significant challenge.\nWe make a key observation that the similarity between head and tail instances is often higher at lower resolutions: discriminative features such as shape or specific texture are usually unveiled at higher resolutions. Conversely, information from the lower resolutions tends to be more class-independent such as background, configuration, or direction of objects (Fig.¬†6), thus can be shared between the head and tail classes. Building upon this observation, we propose Unconditional Training at LOwer resolution (UTLO), a novel approach for training cGANs in the long-tail setup. In addition to the standard conditional GAN objective, UTLO trains the intermediate low-resolution output of the generator with an unconditional GAN objective. The unconditional GAN objective encourages the learning of low-resolution features common to both the head and tail classes, which are infused into the subsequent layers of the generator, particularly benefiting the under-represented tail classes. Through extensive experiments and analysis on several long-tailed datasets, we demonstrate that using UTLO to combine high-resolution conditional and low-resolution unconditional training effectively facilitates knowledge sharing between head and tail classes, thereby improving the overall generative modeling of cGANs in the long-tail setup. Due to the strong class imbalance in the long-tailed data, naive usage of existing GAN metrics can be misleading. To mitigate this issue, we propose a few practices to adapt commonly-used GAN metrics to the long-tail setup. Below, we highlight our main contributions: We propose UTLO, a novel knowledge-sharing framework tailored for training cGANs in the long-tailed setup. UTLO allows infusing information from the head classes to the tail classes via an additional unconditional objective applied to the low-resolution part of the cGAN generator.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to demonstrate that not all the layers in a cGAN need to receive class-conditional information, i.e., a cGAN featuring a partially unconditional generator. We present a set of practices and metrics designed to adapt the commonly-used GAN evaluation metrics for long-tail setups, enabling a more precise evaluation of the image generation quality. Through extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and architectures, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed method in improving the training of cGANs in the long-tail setup, achieving state-of-the-art results across several long-tail datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: In the past few years, research on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)  has led to remarkable advances in generating realistic images [ref]2 [ref]16 [ref]40.
