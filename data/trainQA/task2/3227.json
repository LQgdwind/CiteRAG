      "content": "Paper Title: GCoD: Graph Convolutional Network Acceleration via Dedicated Algorithm and Accelerator Co-Design\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph Convolutional Networks (GCNs).\nGCNs have amazed us for processing non-Euclidean and irregular data structures 9. Recently developed GCNs can be categorized into two groups: spectral and spatial methods. Specifically, spectral methods   model the representation in the graph Fourier transform domain based on eigen-decomposition, which are time-consuming and usually handle the whole graph simultaneously, making it difficult to parallel or scale to large graphs  . On the other hand, spatial approaches 4 , which directly perform the convolution in the graph domain by aggregating the neighbor nodes’ information, have rapidly developed recently. To further improve the performance of spatial GCNs, Veličković et al. [ref]36 introduces the attention mechanism to select information which is relatively critical from all inputs;\nZeng et al.  proposes mini-batch training to improve GCNs’ scalability of handling large graphs; and Xu et al.  theoretically formalizes an upper bound for the expressiveness of GCNs.\nGCoD’s innovation is general and thus can be applied on top of different GCN algorithms to boost their hardware acceleration efficiency. GCN Compression. The prohibitive complexity and powerful performance of GCNs have motivated growing interest in GCN compression.\nFor instance, Tailor et al.  for the first time shows the feasibility of adopting 8-bit integer arithmetic representation for GCN inference without sacrificing the classification accuracy; Two concurrent pruning works   aim to sparsify the graph adjacency matrices; and Ying et al.  proposes a DiffPool layer to reduce the size of GCN graphs by clustering similar nodes during training and inference.\nOur GCoD’s split and conquer training algorithm explores from a new perspective by enforcing GCNs to naturally present the desired patterns that are potentially hardware friendly and efficient. Graph Reordering. Graph processing applications are notorious for exhibiting extreme irregularity. Prior techniques on graph reordering    exploit structural properties of real-world graphs to enhance locality, after training the graph.\nDifferent from existing reordering works, our GCoD algorithm is dedicated for hardware-friendly GCN inference and integrates both pruning and reordering during GCN training to enforce polarization and hardware-aware sparsification. As such, the resulting GCNs enjoy a higher degree of data locality while maintaining or even improving the accuracy. Specifically, our GCoD algorithm leads to a SOTA graph pruning ratio (10% edge removal ) without accuracy degradation and two distinct workloads that are explicitly leveraged by our GCoD accelerator. GCN Inference Acceleration.\nThe ultra-sparsity in graph adjacency matrices (e.g., Pubmed dataset has 99.989% sparsity vs. sparse DNNs have 88.9 ∼similar-to\\sim 92.3% sparsity 5) requires dynamic and irregular data accesses for GCNs’ feature aggregation, which has a different execution pattern from DNN accelerators and thus motivates dedicated GCNs accelerators  5.\nHyGCN 2 characterizes the hybrid execution patterns for exploring both the intra/inter-vertex parallelisms to handle the irregularity in the aggregation phase and reusability in the combination phase, respectively.\nLater, AWB-GCN 3 identifies the workload imbalance problem in the aggregation phase, the non-zero values (i.e., connected neighbors) in adjacency matrices are regionally clustered, and proposes autotuning workload balancing techniques to alleviate the runtime imbalance.\nAnother trend is to summarize the design space of the dataflow and micro-architecture optimization in GCN accelerators 2, and provide automated framework to generate suitable hardware for the given GCN applications 4 . For example, G-CoS  develops the first co-search framework that can automatically search for the matched GNN structures and accelerators to maximize both task accuracy and acceleration efficiency.\nIn contrast,\nOur GCoD explores dedicated algorithm-accelerator co-design for GCN inference in order to further boost the overall utilization and acceleration efficiency thanks to the enforced regularity.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: perform the convolution in the graph domain by aggregating the neighbor nodes’ information, have rapidly developed recently.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
