We can seamlessly extend our framework to single-source DG, as our proposed framework does not explicitly require domain labels, unlike some of the other DG methods. To demonstrate the capability of single-source DG, we train our proposed framework on only the CheXpert or MIMIC-CXR dataset, evaluate its performance on the unseen domain test datasets, and compare it with the latest DG methods. The results are reported in Table IV. From Table IV, we can observe that our proposed method achieves superior results compared to existing state-of-the-art methods with statistically significant results.
