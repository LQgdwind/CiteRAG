      "content": "Paper Title: Evolving Neural Networks through a Reverse Encoding Tree\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNeuroEvolution (NE) is a class of methods for evolving artificial neural networks through evolutionary strategies  .\nThe main advantage of NE is that it allows learning under conditions of sparse feedback.\nIn addition, the population-based process makes for good parallelism , without the computational requirement of back-propagation.\nThe evolutionary process of NE is modifying connection weights in the fixed network topology (individuals)  by calculating their fitnesses and evaluating the relationship between individuals. Recent studies  [ref]5  show that the trade-off between protecting topological innovations and promoting evolutionary speed is also a challenge. The evolutionary process from the initial to the final individual is difficult to control accurately.\nGenetic Algorithm (GA) using Speciation Strategies  allow a meaningful application of the crossover operation and protect topological innovations, avoiding premature disappearance.\nThe distribution estimation algorithms, such as Population-Based Incremental Learning  (PBIL), represents a different way of describing the distribution information of candidate topologies of neural networks in the search space, i.e. by establishing a probability model.\nThe Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy  (CMA-ES) further explains the correlations between the parameters of a targeted fitness function, correlations which significantly influence the time taken to find a suitable control strategy 0.\nSafe Mutation  can scale the degree of mutation of each weight, and thereby expand the scope of domains amenable to NE.\nIn this study, a mapping relationship, based on constraining the topological scale, is set up between its features and fitness, in order to explore how the evolutionary strategy influences the population in a restricted search space.\nThe limitation of this scale serves to prevent unrestricted expansion of structures of neural network during evolutionary process.\nOn the restricted topological scale, all neural networks that can be generated by their features have achieved fitness through specific tasks.\nThe location of the specific neural network is the location of its features on the constrained topological scale.\nIn this situation, the location of the nearest two neural networks can be regarded as infinitesimal, and the function made up of all locations is continuous.\nWe define the location of an individual, which created by its feature matrix, as the input of the function, and its fitness as the output.\nTogether, all locations form a complex and smooth fitness landscape 1. In this fitness landscape, all evolutionary processes of the topology of the neural network can be regarded as processes of tree-based searching, like random forest 2.\nThe initial population can be regarded as the root nodes, and the population of each generation can be regarded as the branch nodes of each layer.\nBased on the current population or other population information (such as the probability matrix), more representative or better nodes will be identified in the next layer and used as individuals in the next generation.\nInterestingly, certain classical search methods have attracted our attention.\nSome global search methods, like Binary Search 3 and Golden-Section Search 4, are not merely of use in finding extreme values in uni-modal functions, but have also shown promise when used in other fields 5 6.\nThe search processes of the above global search method are similar to the reverse process of tree-based searching 7.\nThe final (root) node is dependent on the elite leaf or branch nodes in each layer, as the topology of the final neural network is influenced by the features of the elite topology of each generation. Based on the reverse process of tree-based searching (as the evolutionary strategy), we design two specific strategies in the fitness landscape, named NEAT with a reverse binary encoding tree (Bi-NEAT) and NEAT with a reverse golden-section 8 encoding tree (GS-NEAT).\nIn addition, the correlation coefficient 9 is used to analyze the degree of exploration of multiple sub-clusters 0 in the fitness landscape formed by each generation of individuals.\nIt effectively prevents the population from falling into the optimal local solution due to over-rapid evolution.\nThe evolution speed of NEAT and FS-NEAT (as the baselines) and our proposed strategies are discussed in the logic operations and continuous control gaming benchmark in the OpenAI-gym  1.\nThese strategies have also passed different levels and types of noise tests to establish their robustness.\nWe reach the following conclusions: (1) Bi-NEAT, and GS-NEAT can improve the evolutionary efficiency of the population in NE; (2) Bi-NEAT and GS-NEAT show a high degree of robustness when subject to noise; (3) Bi-NEAT and GS-NEAT usually yield simpler topologies than the baselines.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: process of NE is modifying connection weights in the fixed network topology (individuals)  by calculating their fitnesses and evaluating the relationship between individuals.
