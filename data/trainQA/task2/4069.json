      "content": "Paper Title: UTTS: Unsupervised TTS with Conditional Disentangled Sequential Variational Auto-encoder\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we introduce the background and relation to our proposed method. Supervised TTS: the neural network based supervised TTS systems can be generally categorised into two forms, the end-to-end methods  [ref]4 6 that directly maps text to speech waveform and the two-stage solutions    [ref]4    6 that utilize an acoustic model to convert text to frame by frame acoustic features (e.g., mel spectrogram) and a vocoder transforms the intermediate features to the waveform. While the end-to-end TTS draws an increased attention for some tasks, most of the current studies still follow the two-stage methods, mainly because of the less constraint from the data and optimization. As mentioned in the Introduction, the proposed UTTS system assembles like the two-stage supervised TTS, with the differences in some of the critical building blocks. Unsupervised TTS: there are not so many successful tries of the unsupervised TTS system development until recently. Thanks to the recent development of self-supervised speech representation learning, both systems in  7 8 used an unsupervised ASR model to transcribe the TTS speech data. With the pseudo labels, they once again can adopt the supervised TTS recipe to build the unsupervised TTS systems. The result indicates that it is possible to produce speech with high intelligibility even without paired TTS data. One notable concern for such unsupervised TTS systems remains in the development of unsupervised ASR, which is still requires necessary improvement to close the gap between the supervised counterparts 9 0. Contrasting with our unsupervised approach, instead of transcribing the training speech data and performing supervised network mapping, our TTS AM is a variant of variational auto-encoder (i.e., C-DSVAE 1), with unsupervised alignment as the condition to regularize the learned latent representation to follow the phonetic structure. With this design, our UTTS system requires an additional mapping for text (forced alignment) space to the unsupervised alignment space. For that purpose, we just conduct a data driven process to map forced alignment to unsupervised alignment with the employment of an ASR system. Disentangled speech representation for voice generation: speech disentanglement algorithms, such as DSVAE and C-DSVAE  1 2 2 1, provide a way to isolate global timbre/speaker feature and local content features. Our work is inspired from disentangled speech representation learning and its downstream tasks, such as reconstruction/resynthesis and voice conversion 2 1 3 4. The difference between those studies and UTTS is that, resyntheis or VC are speech driven, the process keeps the content unchanged, while UTTS has to make a linkage between raw text and the intermediate content embeddings in order to generate meaningful output speech. And how to connect the front-end text with unsupervised TTS AM (C-DSVAE) remains the key in building our UTTS system.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: we introduce the background and relation to our proposed method.
