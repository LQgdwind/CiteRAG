      "content": "Paper Title: Coded sparse matrix computation schemes that leverage partial stragglers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDistributed computation plays a major role in several problems in machine learning. For example, large scale matrix-vector multiplication is repeatedly used in gradient descent which in turn plays a key role in high dimensional machine learning problems. The size of the underlying matrices makes it impractical to perform the computation on a single computer (both from a speed and a storage perspective). Thus, the computation is typically subdivided into smaller tasks that are run in parallel across multiple worker nodes. In these systems the overall execution time is typically dominated by the speed of the slowest worker. Thus, the presence of stragglers (as slow or failed workers are called) can negatively impact the performance of distributed computation. In recent years, techniques from coding theory (especially maximum-distance-separable (MDS) codes) [ref]1 [ref]2   have been used to mitigate the effect of stragglers for problems such as matrix-vector and matrix-matrix multiplication. For instance, the work of [ref]1 proposes to partition the computation of 𝐀T​𝐱superscript𝐀𝑇𝐱\\mathbf{A}^{T}\\mathbf{x} by first splitting 𝐀=[𝐀0|𝐀1]𝐀delimited-[]conditionalsubscript𝐀0subscript𝐀1\\mathbf{A}=[\\mathbf{A}_{0}\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ |\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ \\mathbf{A}_{1}] into two block-columns (with an equal number of column vectors) and assigning three workers, the task of computing A0T​xsubscriptsuperscriptA𝑇0x\\textbf{A}^{T}_{0}\\textbf{x}, A1T​xsubscriptsuperscriptA𝑇1x\\textbf{A}^{T}_{1}\\textbf{x} and (A0+A1)T​xsuperscriptsubscriptA0subscriptA1𝑇x\\left(\\textbf{A}_{0}+\\textbf{A}_{1}\\right)^{T}\\textbf{x}, respectively. Evidently, the computational load on each node is half of the original job. Furthermore, it is easy to see that 𝐀T​𝐱superscript𝐀𝑇𝐱\\mathbf{A}^{T}\\mathbf{x} can be recovered as soon as any two workers complete their tasks (with some minimal post-processing). Thus, this system is resilient to one straggler. The work of , poses the multiplication of two matrices in a form that is roughly equivalent to a Reed-Solomon code. In particular, each worker node’s task (which is multiplying smaller submatrices) can be imagined as a coded symbol. As long as enough tasks are complete, the master node can recover the matrix product by polynomial interpolation. For such coded computing systems we can define a so-called recovery threshold. It is the minimum value of τ𝜏\\tau, such that the master node can recover the result as long as any τ𝜏\\tau workers complete their tasks. Thus, at the top level, in these systems stragglers are treated as the equivalent of erasures in coding theory, i.e., the assumption is that no useful information can be obtained from the stragglers. While these are interesting ideas, there are certain issues that are ignored in the majority of prior work (see   [ref]7   for some exceptions). Firstly, several practical cases of matrix-vector or matrix-matrix multiplication involve sparse matrices. Using MDS coding strategies in a straightforward manner will often destroy the sparsity of the matrices being processed by the worker nodes. In fact, as noted in [ref]7, this can cause the overall job execution time to actually go up rather than down. Secondly, in the distributed computation setting, we make the observation that it is possible to leverage partial computations that are performed by the stragglers. Thus, a slow worker may not necessarily be a useless worker. Fig. 1 (which also appears in ) shows the variation of speed of different t2.micro machines in AWS (Amazon Web Services) cluster, and it can be seen that for a particular job, even the slowest worker node may have approximately 60%−70%percent60percent7060\\%-70\\% of the speed of the fastest worker. In this work we propose schemes which are not only resilient to full stragglers, but can also exploit slow workers by utilizing their partially finished tasks. The works in  and  also address this issue but they are applicable only for matrix-vector multiplication whereas in this work, we propose schemes for matrix-matrix multiplication too. Furthermore, in several of our schemes we can specify the number of block-columns of the individual 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} and 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B} matrices that are linearly combined to arrive at the encoded matrices. This is especially useful in the case of sparse matrices (𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} and 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{B}) that often appear in practical settings. Thus, in short, our proposed approaches can leverage the partial computations of the stragglers and exploit the sparsity of the input matrices, both of which can enhance the overall speed of the whole system. This paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the background and related work and summarizes the contributions of our work. Section III outlines some basic definitions and observations which are required for the subsequent presentation. Section IV discusses our proposed β𝛽\\beta-level coding schemes which constrain the level of coding in the encoded submatrices while leveraging partial computations. Following this, Section V proposes schemes for both matrix-vector and matrix-matrix multiplication which can be optimal in terms of resilience to full stragglers and can improve the utilization of the partial stragglers. Section VI discusses the experimental performance of our proposed methods and shows the comparison with other available approaches. We conclude the paper with a discussion about future work in Section VII.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: or failed workers are called) can negatively impact the performance of distributed computation.
