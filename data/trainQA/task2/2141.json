      "content": "Paper Title: Meta-Adaptive Nonlinear Control: Theory and Algorithms\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOne important goal in autonomy and artificial intelligence is to enable autonomous robots to learn from prior experience to quickly adapt to new tasks and environments. Examples abound in robotics, such as a drone flying in different wind conditions [ref]1, a manipulator throwing varying objects [ref]2, or a quadruped walking over changing terrains . Though those examples provide encouraging empirical evidence, when designing such adaptive systems, two important theoretical challenges arise, as discussed below. First, from a learning perspective, the system should be able to learn an “efficient” representation from prior tasks, thereby permitting faster future adaptation, which falls into the categories of representation learning or meta-learning. Recently, a line of work has shown theoretically that learning representations (in the standard supervised setting) can significantly reduce sample complexity on new tasks   . Empirically, deep representation learning or meta-learning has achieved success in many applications , including control, in the context of meta-reinforcement learning   . However, theoretical benefits (in the end-to-end sense) of representation learning or meta-learning for adaptive control remain unclear. Second, from a control perspective, the agent should be able to handle parametric model uncertainties with control-theoretic guarantees such as stability and tracking error convergence, which is a common adaptive control problem  [ref]12. For classic adaptive control algorithms, theoretical analysis often involves the use of Lyapunov stability and asymptotic convergence  [ref]12. Moreover, many recent studies aim to integrate ideas from learning, optimization, and control theory to design and analyze adaptive controllers using learning-theoretic metrics. Typical results guarantee non-asymptotic convergence in finite time horizons, such as regret      and dynamic regret   . However, these results focus on a single environment or task. A multi-task extension, especially whether and how prior experience could benefit the adaptation in new tasks, remains an open problem. Main contributions. In this paper, we address both learning and control challenges in a unified framework and provide end-to-end guarantees. We derive a new method of Online Meta-Adaptive Control (OMAC) that controls uncertain nonlinear systems under a sequence of new environmental conditions. The underlying assumption is that the environment-dependent unknown dynamics can well be captured by a shared representation, which\nOMAC learns using a meta-adapter. OMAC then performs environment-specific updates using an inner-adapter. We provide different instantiations of OMAC under varying assumptions and conditions. In the jointly and element-wise convex cases, we show sublinear cumulative control error bounds, which to our knowledge is the first non-asymptotic convergence result for multi-task nonlinear control.\nCompared to standard adaptive control approaches that do not have a meta-adapter, we show that OMAC possesses both stronger guarantees and empirical performance.\nWe finally show how to integrate OMAC with deep representation learning, which further improves empirical performance.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: is to enable autonomous robots to learn from prior experience to quickly adapt to new tasks and environments.
