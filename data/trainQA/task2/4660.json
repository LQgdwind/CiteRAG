      "content": "Paper Title: Generalized One-shot Domain Adaptation of Generative Adversarial Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe take the few-shot adaptation method FSGA [ref]29, one-shot adaptation methods MTG , OSCLIP , and one-shot face style transfer method JoJoGAN [ref]9 for comparison on the commonly studied face domain. As shown in Fig. 3, since these works cannot deal with the entity yet, for a fair comparison we select three portraits without entity (Sketch, Disney, Arcane) from previous works [ref]34 [ref]9 and three portraits with entities (hat, Zelda decorations, and mask) from AAHQ . Their masks can be obtained via manual annotation, or alternatively by semantic segmentation  . Qualitative results    Fig. 3 shows the qualitative results. The top row images are the source natural faces, and they are inverted by e4e  to obtain the latent codes.\nFrom the results, we can draw the following conclusions: Firstly, our syntheses are of competitive style as the given references. Though shown in thumbnails, they have more obvious high-frequency details to look sharp and realistic, whereas the results of JoJoGAN are very fuzzy. Secondly, our method achieves the strongest cross-domain correspondence that preserves the content and shape of the source image, which is a great advance compared with other methods without a doubt. It also implies our method can keep the diversity of the source model without content collapse. Thirdly, our method can generate high-quality entities, which are adaptive to the various face shapes and look harmonious with the rest area of the syntheses. Experiments prove that our method has sufficient visual advantages over competitors. Quantitative results    Previous works mainly conduct user studies to compare the visual quality. Following them, we survey user preferences for different methods. We first randomly sample 505050 latent codes in 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W} space and feed them into various models. We provide the references, source syntheses, and adapted syntheses to volunteers. They consider both style and content and subjectively vote for their favorite adapted syntheses. Moreover, to objectively evaluate the cross-domain correspondence, we use the face alignment network  to extract facial landmarks and calculate the Normalized Mean Error (NME) of landmarks between source syntheses and adapted syntheses.\n where l​m​k𝑙𝑚𝑘lmk denotes the 68 points two-dimension landmarks extractor, and n𝑛n is set to 1000.\nNME reflects the face shape difference before and after adaptation. We further report the Identity Similarity (IS) predicted by the Arcface  to metric the preservation of identity information. The model with lower NME and higher IS shows better cross-domain corresponding property. The quantitative results have been shown in Table 1.\nOur method undoubtedly obtains the best scores in terms of NME and IS. It performs stably and gets similar NME in different domains. FSGA and OSCLIP obtain relatively worse scores due to overfitting as shown in Fig. 3, their common characteristic is that the GAN discriminator is used for training. MTG performs very unsteadily especially when the target domains have strong semantic style like Disney and Zelda. Compared with our approach, JoJoGAN works well on NME, but poorly on IS. For the user study, we finally collect valid votes from 53 volunteers, and a user averagely spends 4 seconds on one question. Our method obtains about 60%percent\\% of the votes on each adapted model, whereas other methods evenly acquire the rest of the votes. It proves that our method is much more popular with users. Training and inference time    Our method costs about 12 minutes for 𝒎r​e​f≠𝟎subscript𝒎𝑟𝑒𝑓0\\boldsymbol{m}_{ref}\\neq\\mathbf{0} and 3 minutes for 𝒎r​e​f=𝟎subscript𝒎𝑟𝑒𝑓0\\boldsymbol{m}_{ref}=\\mathbf{0} on NVIDIA RTX 3090. FSGA, MTG, JoJoGAN, OSCLIP cost about 48, 9, 2, 24 minutes respectively. All of them take about 30ms to generate an image.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: We take the few-shot adaptation method FSGA [ref]29, one-shot adaptation methods MTG , OSCLIP , and one-shot face style transfer method JoJoGAN [ref]9 for comparison on the commonly studied face domain.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
