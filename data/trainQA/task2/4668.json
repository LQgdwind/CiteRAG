      "content": "Paper Title: Understanding Time Variations of DNN Inference in Autonomous Driving\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOwing to its high safety and efficiency, autonomous driving has become the fundamental technology for the next generation of transportation. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely deployed in the autonomous driving system for sensing, perception, decision, and control. Typical examples include: YOLOv3 and Faster R-CNN for object detection¬† ; Deeplabv3 for image semantic segmentation¬† ; LaneNet and PINet for lane detection¬† . There are two main reasons for the success of DNNs in autonomous driving systems. The first is the higher accuracy compared with traditional computer vision-based approaches¬†[ref]23. The other is that DNNs can process raw data, making it suitable for autonomous driving vehicles since it generates terabytes of raw sensor data daily¬†. As a safety-critical system, autonomous driving sets high requirements in accuracy, real-time, robustness, etc. The high accuracy of DNN-based algorithms promotes the development of autonomous vehicles. However, satisfying the real-time requirements of the sensing, perception, and planning tasks are still significant challenges. According to¬†[ref]27, when the vehicle drives at 40 km per hour in urban areas, these autonomous functions should be effective every 1 m with task execution time less than 100ms. As DNN models are widely used in object detection/classification, lane tracking, and decision-making applications, guaranteeing the real-time execution of the DNN inference becomes the key to satisfying the real-time requirements of autonomous driving. Generally, for safety-critical applications like sensing, perception, control, etc., deadline-based scheduling is used by the real-time scheduler to guarantee safety. Setting up deadlines is usually based on the worst observed execution time. However, although the model structure and weights are fixed, non-negligible time variations still exist in DNN inference¬† . Prior works¬† observed the time variations for DNN inference in mobile devices and found that inference time follows an approximately Gaussian distribution. However, the statistic-based approach performs poorly when time variations are enormous. Another work¬† on the anytime DNN system also observed the time variations issue and provided a Kalman Filter-based estimation for latency distribution. D3superscriptùê∑3D^{3} is a work that addresses the time variations in AV systems with dynamic deadlines rather than static deadlines¬†. However, none of the existing approaches could handle huge time variations since they do not consider the roots causing DNN inference time variations. Time variations bring a big challenge for real-time schedulers because the deadline with the worst observed execution time could waste many processor resources. Many resources would be saved if the DNN inference time could be fixed or narrowed down to a specific range. A detailed and in-depth analysis of DNN inference time variation is missing. Therefore, understanding the DNN inference time variation is key to optimizing the DNN inference runtime for autonomous driving. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive analysis of DNN inference time variations in a general autonomous driving system. We analyze the time variation issues in fine granularity. For typical DNN models, we consider the variability in DNN inference from six perspectives: data, I/O, model, runtime, hardware, and end-to-end perception system. Six insights are derived for reducing DNN inference time variations.\nIn summary, this paper makes the following contributions: The time variation issues of DNN inference in autonomous driving are thoroughly studied. We found that the majority of DNN models show variations larger than 100ms, which significantly affects autonomous driving safety. Through a comprehensive analysis of the time variation of DNN model inference from six perspectives, we derive six insights into the relationship between DNN inference time variations and variability of data, I/O, model, runtime, hardware, and end-to-end perception system. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section¬†II presents the background and motivation of this work. Section¬†III discusses the time variation analysis for typical DNN models. Section¬†IV present the implementation of the end-to-end perception system. Section¬†V dicussed the time variation analysis for the end-to-end perception system.\nSection¬†VI describes the related work. Section¬†VII concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: for lane detection¬† .
