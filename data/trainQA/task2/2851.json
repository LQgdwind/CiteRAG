Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: SSSNET: Semi-Supervised Signed Network Clustering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe perform experiments on six real-world signed network data sets (Sampson [ref]43,\nRainfall ,\nFin-YNet,\nS&P 1500 6,\nPPI 0,\nand Wiki-Rfa 3).\nTable¬†1\nin the main text gives some summary statistics; here is a brief description of each data set. ‚àô‚àô\\bulletThe Sampson monastery data [ref]43\nwere collected by Sampson while resident at the monastery;\nthe study spans 12 months.\nThis data set contains relationships (esteem, liking, influence,\npraise, as well as disesteem, negative influence, and blame) between 25 novices in total, who were preparing to join\na New England monastery. Each novice was asked to rank their top three choices for each of these relationships.\nSome novices gave ties for some of the choices, and nominated four instead of three other novices. the positive attributes have values 1, 2 and 3 in increasing order of affection, whereas the negative attributes take values -1, -2, and -3, in increasing order of dislike. The social\nrelations were measured at five points in time. Some novices had left the monastery during this process; at time point 4, 18 novices are present. These novices possess as feature whether or not they attended the minor seminary of ‚ÄòCloisterville‚Äô before coming to the monastery. For the other 7 novices this information is not available.\nWe combine these relationships into a network of 25 nodes by adding the weights for each relationship across all time points. Missing observations were set to 0.\nBased on his observations and analyses, Sampson divided the novices into four groups: Young Turks, Loyal Opposition, Outcasts, and an interstitial group; this division is taken as ground truth. We use as node (novice) attribute\nwhether or not they attended ‚ÄòCloisterville‚Äô before coming to the monastery. ‚àô‚àô\\bulletRainfall  contains 64,408 pairwise correlations between n=306ùëõ306n=306 locations in Australia,\nat which historical rainfalls have been measured. ‚àô‚àô\\bulletFin-YNet consists of yearly correlation matrices for n=451ùëõ451n=451 stocks for 2000-2020 (21 distinct networks), using market excess returns. That is, we compute each correlation matrix from overnight (previous close to open) and intraday (open-to-close) price daily returns, from which we subtract the market return of the S&P500 index for the same time interval. In other words, within a given year, for each stock, we consider the time series of 500 market excess returns (there are 250 trading days within a year, and each day contributes with two returns, an overnight one and in intraday one). Each correlation network is built from the empirical correlation matrix of the entire set of stocks. For this data set, we report the results averaged over the 21 networks. ‚àô‚àô\\bulletS&P1500 6 considers daily prices for n=1,193ùëõ1193n=1,193 stocks in the S&P 1500 Index, between 2003 and 2015, and builds correlation matrices from market excess returns (ie, from the return price of each financial instrument, the return of the market S&P500 is subtracted). Since we do not threshold, the result is thus a fully-connected weighted network, with stocks as nodes and correlations as edge weights. ‚àô‚àô\\bulletPPI 0 is a signed protein-protein interaction network between n=3,058ùëõ3058n=3,058 proteins. ‚àô‚àô\\bulletWiki-Rfa 3 is a signed network describing voting information for electing Wikipedia managers. Positive edges represent supporting votes, while negative edges represent opposing votes. We extract the largest connected component and remove nodes with degree at most one, resulting in n=7,634ùëõ7634n=7,634 nodes for experiments.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: We perform experiments on six real-world signed network data sets (Sampson [ref]43,\nRainfall ,\nFin-YNet,\nS&P 1500 6,\nPPI 0,\nand Wiki-Rfa 3).\nTable¬†1\nin the main text gives some summary statistics; here is a brief description of each data set. ‚àô‚àô\\bulletThe Sampson monastery\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
