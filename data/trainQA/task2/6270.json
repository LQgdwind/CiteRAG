      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Optimal Transport: A Practical Algorithm for Photo-realistic Image Restoration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn all of our experiments we use the encoder and decoder of the VAE  from stable-diffusion [ref]7. The pre-trained models we evaluate:\nWe apply our latent transport method (described in section 4) on SwinIR , Restormer [ref]12 and Swin2SR , all of which attempted to minimize average pixel distortion using a supervised regression loss on paired image samples.\nAdditionally, we apply our algorithm on models that are trained to achieve high perceptual quality, and show that we can improve their visual quality even further.\nAs such, we tested two benchmark models in high perceptual quality image restoration: ESRGAN , a GAN-based method, and DDRM , a diffusion-based method.\nBeyond our original goal to improve perceptual quality, we demonstrate that we can also traverse the 𝒲2subscript𝒲2\\mathcal{W}_{2}\\ -MSE tradeoff using any restoration model (e.g., SwinIR, ESRGAN).\nTo do so, we pick any of the aforementioned algorithms and apply our method to improve its perceptual quality, leading to a new estimator.\nWe then interpolate the original algorithm and its improved version using eq. 4, adjusting α𝛼\\alpha to traverse the tradeoff.\nTo clarify, we plug the original algorithm as 𝐱∗superscript𝐱\\mathbf{x}^{*} in eq. 4 (instead of the theoretical MMSE estimator), and plug our improved version as 𝐱^0subscript^𝐱0\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}_{0} (instead of the theoretical 𝐃𝐦𝐚𝐱subscript𝐃𝐦𝐚𝐱\\mathbf{D_{max}} estimator). Restoration tasks:\nWe showcase our algorithm on Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR), denoising of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), JPEG  decompression, Noisy Super-Resolution (NSR) and Compressed Super-Resolution (CSR).\nTraining and inference of our algorithm are performed on each restoration model separately, and the evaluation is performed on the restoration task that corresponds to the given model. Data sets:\n\nThe transport operator is computed using two disjoint sets of 10 randomly picked images from the ImageNet  dataset train split.\nThe first set is used to approximate the predictor’s latent statistics (μ𝐱^esubscript𝜇subscript^𝐱𝑒\\mu_{\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}_{e}}, Σ𝐱^esubscriptΣsubscript^𝐱𝑒\\Sigma_{\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}_{e}}): we degrade each image according to the restoration task the predictor is intended to solve, compute the 10 restored outputs, embed the results and compute the embeddings’ statistics.\nThe second set is embedded into the latent representation without further modification and serves to approximate the natural image latent statistics (μ𝐱esubscript𝜇subscript𝐱𝑒\\mu_{\\mathbf{x}_{e}}, Σ𝐱esubscriptΣsubscript𝐱𝑒\\Sigma_{\\mathbf{x}_{e}}).\nFor all models except DDRM  and Swin2SR , we report the performance on the 50,000 validation samples of ImageNet  following [ref]7.\nBecause of its computational complexity, DDRM  reported its performance on a subset of a 1000 ImageNet  validation samples.\nFor Swin2SR , we use the official DIV2K 0 restored samples provided by the authors.\nAlthough our algorithm can be applied to images with arbitrary aspect ratios, all the tested models were trained on square images.\nThus, we resize the samples to 512×512512512512\\times 512 pixels following the pre-processing procedure of DDRM . Metrics:\nIn addition to Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), we evaluate distortion performance with Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) 1 and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) 2, both of which suit better for natural image comparison 2.\nTo evaluate perceptual quality, we use the Inception Score (IS) 3, the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)  and the Kernel Inception Distance (KID) 4.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: In all of our experiments we use the encoder and decoder of the VAE  from stable-diffusion [ref]7. The pre-trained models we evaluate:\nWe apply our latent transport method (described in section 4) on SwinIR , Restormer [ref]12 and Swin2SR , all of which attempted to minimize average pixel\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
