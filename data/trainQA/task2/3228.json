      "content": "Paper Title: GCoD: Graph Convolutional Network Acceleration via Dedicated Algorithm and Accelerator Co-Design\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe recent breakthrough achieved by deep learning has motivated growing demands for deep learning powered intelligence in many daily life devices featuring contrained resources and a small form factor  [ref]27.\nFor example,\nwe have recently witnessed the tremendously increased excitement towards Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for graph-based learning tasks.\nThe superior performance of GCNs largely benefits from GCNs’ irregular and unrestricted neighborhood connections via two primary execution phases: aggregation and combination, where the former maintains most graph processing behaviors and the latter acts more like neural networks. Specifically, during the aggregation phase, for each node in a graph, GCNs first aggregate all its neighbor nodes’ features, which heavily relies on the graph structure that is inherently random and sparse; during the combination phase, GCNs transform the aggregated features through (hierarchical) feed-forward propagation to update the feature of the given node.\nIn parallel, recent breakthroughs of GCNs have ignited an explosive interest in investigating GCNs for numerous real-world applications, including accurate advertisement in E-commerce [ref]43 and electric grid cascading failure analysis .\nMany of them impose stringent latency/throughput constraints, e.g., real-time decision-making.\nThe promising performance and the potential exciting applications of GCNs come with prohibitive challenges that limit their applications to large real-world graphs and hinder the exploration of deeper and more sophisticated GCN graphs. First,\ngraphs (or graph data), especially real-world ones, are often extraordinarily large and irregular as exacerbated by their intertwined complex neighbor connections, e.g., there are a total of 232,965 nodes in the Reddit graph with each node having about 50 neighbors . One outcome is that GCNs tend to follow the power-law distribution and therefore have highly irregular adjacency matrices resulting in prohibitive inefficiencies in both data processing and movement which substantially limits the achievable GCN acceleration efficiency. Second, the dimension of GCNs’ node feature vectors can be very high, e.g., each node in the Citeseer graph has 3703 features, which can lead to paramount processing costs in the combination phrase.\nAs an illustrative example, a 2-layer GCN requires 19G FLOPs (FLOPs: floating-point operations) to process the Reddit graph , resulting in a latency of 2.94E5 milliseconds when executed on an Intel Xeon E5-2680 CPU platform [ref]13. Such a graph inference costs 2×\\times FLOPs and 5000×\\times latency of a 50-layer DNN, ResNet-50, the inference of which on ImageNet requires only 8G FLOPs  and a latency of less than 50 milliseconds . To alleviate the aforementioned challenges for unleashing many of GCNs’ exciting applications, pioneering works have explored from either the algorithm or hardware level.\nFrom the algorithm level, commonly used compression techniques have been applied to GCNs,\nsuch as GCN quantization  and sparsification .\nFrom the hardware level, most GCN accelerators aim to design innovative micro-architectures and dataflows to boost the acceleration efficiency of the irregular aggregation phase driven by the fact that the acceleration bottleneck of the associated highly sparse and irregular adjacency matrices.\nFor example, AWB-GCN [ref]13 leverages three auto-tuning techniques to dynamically balance the workload for all processing elements (PEs) to boost the efficiency.\nHyGCN  proposes a window sliding method to improve the locality of non-zero elements in GCNs’ adjacency matrices, and leverages intra-vertex/node parallelism for aggregation and weight reuses for combination, respectively. Despite their impressive performance, GCNs’ acceleration efficiency is still limiting, impeding the unfolding of GCNs’ great potential in many real-world applications. In this work, we advocate GCN algorithm and accelerator co-design, and make the following contributions: We propose a GCN algorithm and accelerator Co-Design framework dubbed GCoD which alleviate the aforementioned irregularity of GCN inference at different granularities and largely resolve the bottleneck inefficiency of GCN computing by harmonizing both algorithm and accelerator innovations. To the best of our knowledge, GCoD is the first co-design framework dedicated for efficient GCN acceleration, opening up an exciting perspective for exploring much more efficient GCN solutions. On the algorithm level, GCoD integrates a split and conquer training strategy to polarize the graphs to be either denser or sparser in local neighborhoods without compromising the model accuracy, resulting in adjacency matrices that have two levels of workload and enjoys largely enhanced regularity and thus ease of acceleration. In this way, GCNs still preserve large degrees of irregularity (and thus high inference accuracy) while enabling regular data accesses and processes within each workload, favoring hardware efficiency and overall utilization. On the hardware level, GCoD integrates a dedicated two-pronged accelerator to leverage GCoD algorithm’s resulting graph adjacency matrices for further boosting the acceleration efficiency.\nSpecifically, one branch incorporates a chunk-based micro-architecture to accelerate the polarized denser subgraphs with regular/denser patterns and balanced workloads; while the other branch accelerates (mostly on-chip) the remaining irregular/sparser but largely reduced sparser workloads (a small portion of non-zeros, e.g., 30% in Cora). Results of the two branches are then aggregated without conflicts.  Benchmarking experiments and ablation studies on five GCN models and six graph datasets consistently validate the effectiveness of our GCoD framework, e.g., GCoD leads to 15286×\\times, 294×\\times, 7.8×\\times, and 2.5×\\times speedups over CPUs, GPUs, and the existing SOTA GCN accelerators including HyGCN and AWB-GCN, respectively,\nwhile maintaining the same or an even better accuracy.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: recent breakthrough achieved by deep learning has motivated growing demands for deep learning powered intelligence in many daily life devices featuring contrained resources and a small form factor  [ref]27.\nFor example,\nwe have recently witnessed the tremendously increased excitement towards Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
