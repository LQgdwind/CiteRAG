      "content": "Paper Title: Feature Map Testing for Deep Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used in safety-critical domains, such as autonomous driving  and medical diagnosis . However, DNNs can be complex and susceptible to data bias, overfitting, and underfitting, making them far from dependable for these applications. To address this problem, DNNs must undergo deep learning testing techniques before deployment to ensure their reliability  . This testing helps identify and repair units (e.g., neurons and feature maps) in the model that are particularly vulnerable to change and can significantly impact the model’s performance, resulting in a more reliable model. The deep learning testing technique mainly has three key elements: coverage metric, test case selection, and fuzzing strategy. The testing process typically works in an iterative way. In each iteration, the testing techniques will first feed test cases, which are selected or fuzzed with certain rules (e.g., coverage metric), into the model, after which a coverage metric is calculated. New test cases will be generated to further improve the coverage metric until the metric meets the developers’ requirements. The most important element mentioned above is the coverage metric since it determines how test cases are generated (i.e., fuzzed or selected from a massive amount of candidate test sets) to reveal the fault-inducing units (e.g., neuron and feature map. Illustrated in Fig. 1) of a tested DNN. Therefore, the main criterion of coverage metrics is to explore as much diversity as possible of a certain subspace defined based on different abstraction levels (e.g., neuron activation , neuron activation pattern , and neuron activation conditions [ref]5), while test case selection and fuzzing strategy are used to obtain new test cases, which are fed into the model to increase coverage metrics. To explore more types of model units’ behaviors, multiple Neuron Coverage (NC) metrics, including NAC , KMNC , IDC , and MC/DC  have been proposed. Key problems of existing NC-guided testing.\nDespite the fact that existing NC-guided testing techniques have greatly advanced deep learning testing, there remains a significant constraint, namely that not all fault-inducing units in the model are neurons. Recent studies   have revealed that feature maps are also important fault-inducing units that can affect DNN performance, while NC-guided techniques often focus on analyzing neuron’s behavior and fail to capture and utilize feature-map-level information, causing DNN developers can not detecting feature maps that induce errors. Consequently, NC-guided testing techniques yield a sub-optimal fault detection rate and can merely bring a significant boost to the model 0 1, as retraining the model with test cases generated by NC-Fuzz (e.g., DeepXplore , DeepHunter 2, and ADAPT 3) can only repair fault-inducing neurons. In this work, we address this problem by proposing DeepFeature, which test DNNs from feature map level.\nAs opposed to heuristically defining various neuron-level metrics, we establish a clear connection between output variation at the feature-map level and the performance of the model through clear experiments.\nAs illustrated in Fig. 1, the main distinction between DeepFeature and existing neuron coverage testing works is that DeepFeature tests the DNN model from the feature-map level.\nSpecifically, during the testing process, DeepFeature delves into every inner feature map in the model to evaluate its vulnerability.\nThe vulnerable feature maps therein are then repaired by retraining with test cases selected or generated using our corresponding selection and fuzzing strategy while further improving the overall performance of the model. To validate the effectiveness of DeepFeature, we conduct experiments with four popular DNN models across four widely-used datasets. The experiment results validate our motivation and demonstrate the superiority of our method.\nSpecifically, in comparison to state-of-the-art neuron-level test case selection methods, our DeepFeature yields a higher fault detection rate (e.g., DeepFeature maximum increases 49.32% fault detection rate compared with NC-guided baselines), and in limited test case selection scenarios, DeepFeature can detect more type of faults that are ignored by baselines.\nDeepFeature’s Fuzzer is further exhibited to be the most effective and efficient among state-of-the-art fuzzing techniques. In a nutshell, we make the following contributions. We propose a novel set of testing metrics to quantify the feature map’s vulnerability. We propose a new selection method that can productively select test cases with a high probability of fooling the model from a massive number of unlabeled test cases (e.g., DeepFeature maximum increases 49.32% fault detection rate compared with NC-guided baselines). We propose feature-map-guided fuzzing technique that outperforms current fuzzing techniques.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: to explore as much diversity as possible of a certain subspace defined based on different abstraction levels (e.g., neuron activation , neuron activation pattern , and neuron activation conditions [ref]5), while test case selection and fuzzing strategy are used to obtain new test cases, which are fed into the model to increase coverage metrics.
