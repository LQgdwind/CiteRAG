      "content": "Paper Title: Continual Prune-and-Select: Class-incremental learning with specialized subnetworks This is a preprint version of the work. The published version is: Dekhovich, A., Tax, D. M., Sluiter, M. H., & Bessa, M. A. (2023). Continual prune-and-select: class-incremental learning with specialized subnetworks. Applied Intelligence, 1-16. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10489-022-04441-z\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs previously mentioned, continual learning problems are usually classified according to whether or not the task-ID is available during inference. We focus on the class-IL scenario where the task ID is absent during inference since it is the most realistic and challenging scenario of continual learning. All class-IL methods are usually divided into three categories : regularization [ref]20 [ref]21   [ref]24 , rehearsal     and architectural   . Purely regularization-based methods introduce an additional term in the loss function to prevent forgetting. Some approaches [ref]24 [ref]20   estimate the importance of connections for a given task and penalize the model for gradient updates during training for the next tasks. Learning without forgetting (LwF) [ref]21 adds a term in the loss function that penalizes changes in old output heads for new data while training new output heads on new data. Regularization-based methods have the advantage of not storing past data in memory nor needing network expansion, but they perform worse compared to other approaches . Rehearsal methods replay small amounts of old classes  or generate synthetic examples  to be able to predict previously seen classes. iCaRL uses the nearest class mean  (NCM) classifier together with fixed memory of old data to mitigate forgetting. Bias-correction methods    aim to tackle the tendency of class-IL algorithms to be biased towards classes of the last tasks, which arises due to class imbalance at the latest stages . PODNet  has multiple terms in the loss function using old data from the memory of a fixed size, penalizing signal deviations not only in the output layer but also in intermediate ones. AFC  uses knowledge distillation by estimating the importance of each feature map. The estimation is based on the increase of loss function from changing channelsâ€™ parameters in the feature maps. The obvious limitation of rehearsal methods is the need to keep past data, which is often not desirable in practical applications due to privacy issues as mentioned by . Architectural methods follow a different strategy where the network architecture is modified to avoid forgetting. For example, the Dynamically Expandable Network (DEN)  expands the network architecture in an online manner, increasing network capabilities, and introducing a regularization term to prevent forgetting. However, due to the expansion of the network, the final number of parameters is greater than for the original architecture, which increases the memory costs. Supermasks in Superposition (SupSup)  and SpaceNet  find subnetworks for every task. SpaceNet assigns parameters to one task only, without sharing knowledge between tasks which limits its allocation capabilities for long sequences of tasks. In addition, SpaceNet requires to pre-define the sparsity level for each task. SupSup uses a randomly weighted backbone  instead of pruning to obtain a task-related subnetwork. During inference, SupSup predicts the correct subnetwork for the given test data, using all data points in the batch. In the provided experiments, the batch size is equal to 128 images which may not be applicable to real-life problems. DER  dynamically expands the feature extractor by introducing new channels and freezes old feature representation while learning a new task. Later, DER uses a small portion of old data and current data to finetune the network for all tasks. To stop the growth of the number of parameters, DER uses a pruning strategy, however, the final number of parameters is unpredictable. Similarly, FOSTER 0 introduces a new module with a feature map to learn new classes. However, it uses a knowledge distillation strategy inspired by gradient boosting instead of pruning to compress the model. As a result, the outcome of FOSTER is a single fixed-sized backbone network. A Meta-Learning approach for class-IL is proposed by iTAML 1. The algorithm for updating parameters for all old tasks also needs fixed-sized memory, but iTAML uses a momentum-based strategy for meta-updates to overcome catastrophic forgetting. At the test stage, iTAML starts by predicting the task associated with that sample using a given test batch, and then adapts its parameters to the predicted task using data from fixed memory. Finally, with the adapted model and predicted task-ID, iTAML makes a prediction. Overall, iTAML uses samples from previous tasks to prevent forgetting, and the batch of test data to predict task-ID, making it the most demanding algorithm out of consideration. Also, the model adaptation to the predicted task makes it computationally more expensive than other state-of-the-art methods.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: the task ID is absent during inference since it is the most realistic and challenging scenario of continual learning.
