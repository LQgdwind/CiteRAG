      "content": "Paper Title: Face Swapping as A Simple Arithmetic Operation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFace swapping is the task of transferring the identity from a source\nface image to a target face image while preserving the attributes\n(styles) of the target face image such as pose, facial expression,\nlighting, and background. It has attracted a lot of attentions from\ncommunity recently thanks to its practical applications in entertainment\n [ref]9 and privacy protection\n. A large number of face swapping methods have been proposed. Early\nmethods can only handle source and target faces with similar poses,\nor source faces with known identities  .\nLater methods are able to deal with source and target faces having\nvery different styles, and can even work in unconstrained settings\n [ref]9 7  .\nAmong them, GAN-based methods [ref]9 7\noften achieve better visual results than those using conventional\nimage blending models  . Recent years have also witnessed the development of several powerful\nGANs for image generation    1.\nStyleGAN  1 is probably the\ncurrent state-of-the-art, which been shown to be capable of generating\ndiverse high-fidelity images at megapixel resolution. Its superiority\nmainly comes from the original architectural design of its generator.\nIn conventional GANs , an input noise\nvector z∈𝒵𝑧𝒵z\\in\\mathcal{Z} directly passes through the generator G𝐺G in a feed-forward\nmanner. Meanwhile, in StyleGAN, z𝑧z is mapped to an intermediate\nlatent code w∈𝒲𝑤𝒲w\\in\\mathcal{W} which is then used to modulate the intermediate\nfeature maps of G𝐺G at different spatial resolutions. Many works\nhave shown that the latent space 𝒲+superscript𝒲\\mathcal{W}^{+} of StyleGAN - an extension\nof 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W} - is more expressive and disentangled than 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W} and 𝒵𝒵\\mathcal{Z},\nmotivating the use of 𝒲+superscript𝒲\\mathcal{W}^{+} for latent space manipulation  . Inspired by the great capability of StyleGAN, several works have made\nuse of a pretrained StyleGAN to perform high-resolution face swapping.\nZhu et al.  proposed to learn a Face Transfer Module\n(FTM) that combines the inverted latent codes of the source and target\nfaces to obtain a swapped latent code which will then be sent to the\nStyleGAN generator to produce a swapped face. However, since the two\nlatent codes contain entangled information of identity and attributes,\ndirectly fusing them together may cause the swapped result to retain\nsome information of the source attributes and the target identity.\nXu et al. , on the other hand, proposed to concatenate\nthe “structure” part of the source latent code with the disjoint\n“appearance” part of the target latent code to get an input latent\ncode for the StyleGAN generator. Unfortunately, this input latent\ncode still contains entangled information in its parts. Thus, the\ngenerated face derived from it has mixed styles, and is considered\nas a side output not the final result. To address the above limitation, we propose a novel face swapping\nmethod based on a pretraind StyleGAN that explicitly disentangles\nthe intermediate latent space 𝒲+superscript𝒲\\mathcal{W}^{+} of a pretrained StyleGAN into\ntwo subspaces 𝒲id+superscriptsubscript𝒲id\\mathcal{W}_{\\text{id}}^{+} and 𝒲sty+superscriptsubscript𝒲sty\\mathcal{W}_{\\text{sty}}^{+} characterizing\nidentity and style respectively. Motivated by the expressiveness and\nlinear editability of 𝒲+superscript𝒲\\mathcal{W}^{+}  4,\nwe hypothesize that we can represent the inverted latent code w∈𝒲+𝑤superscript𝒲w\\in\\mathcal{W}^{+}\nof a face image as the sum of an “identity” code wid∈𝒲id+subscript𝑤idsuperscriptsubscript𝒲idw_{\\text{id}}\\in\\mathcal{W}_{\\text{id}}^{+}\nand a “style” code wsty∈𝒲sty+subscript𝑤stysuperscriptsubscript𝒲styw_{\\text{sty}}\\in\\mathcal{W}_{\\text{sty}}^{+}, i.e., w=wid+wsty𝑤subscript𝑤idsubscript𝑤styw=w_{\\text{id}}+w_{\\text{sty}}.\nThis enables us to regard face swapping as a simple arithmetic\noperation in 𝒲+superscript𝒲\\mathcal{W}^{+}, that is the summation of a source “identity”\ncode and a target “style” code. Therefore, we name our\nmethod “Arithmetic Face Swapping” (AFS). Compared to existing\nformulations of face swapping, ours is more intuitive and elegant.\nIn fact, the standard face swapping is just a special case of\nnumerous operations that our identity-style disentanglement could\nsupport. For example, we can take the (weighted) average of multiple\ntarget style codes in 𝒲sty+superscriptsubscript𝒲sty\\mathcal{W}_{\\text{sty}}^{+} and combine the result with\na source identity code in 𝒲id+superscriptsubscript𝒲id\\mathcal{W}_{\\text{id}}^{+} via summation, which is\nequivalent to face swapping with one identity and multiple styles.\nSimilarly, we can easily combine multiple identities together to create\na new identity that has not existed before without changing styles.\nThese kinds of face swapping, to the best of our knowledge, have never\nbeen considered in previous works. We implement our identity-style\ndisentanglement by learning a style extractor network hℎh that maps\nw𝑤w to wstysubscript𝑤styw_{\\text{sty}} and compute widsubscript𝑤idw_{\\text{id}} as w−h​(w)𝑤ℎ𝑤w-h(w). We also provide\na condition for hℎh which theoretically guarantees that our method\ncan preserve the identity of the source image even when this image\ngoes through a sequence of face swapping operations with different\nstyles. This condition is then turned into an objective for training\nhℎh, along with other well-designed objectives to ensure that widsubscript𝑤idw_{\\text{id}}\nand wstysubscript𝑤styw_{\\text{sty}} derived from hℎh capture the true identity and style\ninformation in w𝑤w respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat AFS outperforms existing state-of-the-art face swapping methods\nin generating high-quality results, and preserving the source identity\nand the target attributes.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: the target face image such as pose, facial expression,\nlighting, and background.
