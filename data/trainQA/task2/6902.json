      "content": "Paper Title: Scalable and Configurable Tracking for Any Rowhammer Threshold\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe typical hardware-based solutions for mitigating Rowhammer rely on tracking the row activation counts and identifying aggressor rows. This can be done either probabilistically, or with SRAM-based tracking or DRAM-based tracking. Probabilistic trackers, such as PARA  and PRA [ref]23, require significant mitigation overheads (almost 50X more compared to a precise tracker ), which makes them unappealing at lower thresholds (less than 10K). Other schemes, such as MRLOC  and ProHIT  also use probabilistic decisions; however, they are not deemed secure. SRAM-based trackers use intelligent algorithms to track only a subset of rows in memory to identify the aggressor rows. Several such solutions exist, including Graphene , CBT , TWiCE , Mithril , however all of them incur unacceptable SRAM/CAM overheads at ultra-low thresholds, sometimes even more (due to tag information) than an ideal tracker that dedicates one counter per row. D-CBF  use Bloom Filter for identification. However, to limit the false positives, such filters must be heavily over-provisioned, so they inucr significant SRAM overheads, and can only be used with rate control (and not victim refresh). DRAM-based trackers can provision one counter per row in a table that is resident in the DRAM. However, accessing these counters can still incur significant overheads. For example, Counter-Based Row Activation (CRA) [ref]23 uses dedicated metadata caches to store these counters, however even with 64KB-256KB dedicated metadata caches it incurs a significant slowdown. Hydra  is a recent proposal that uses SRAM filters (to do group tracking) to reduce memory accesses for tracking. While Hydra is effective at the thresholds of a few hundred, we show that it incurs significant SRAM overheads or slowdown at thresholds below 100. Industrial trackers such as Target Row Refresh (TRR) were developed by DRAM vendors to mitigate Rowhammer transparently. Recent attacks, such as TRRespass [ref]13 and Blacksmith , exploit the fact that TRR keeps track of only a small number of aggressor rows and breaks TRR by issuing many requests.\nSamsung’s DSAC  and SK Hynix’s PAT  improve TRR for DDR5, but due to severe area limitation in DRAM, still allow aggressors to escape detection. DSAC has an escape probability of 13.9% between two mitigations and PAT fails 6.9% of the time (compared to DDR4-TRR). While area-efficient, these solutions are not secure due to limited tracking capability.\nThus, it is important to size the tracking structures considering the worst-case access pattern. START provides low-cost tracking for all the rows in memory.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: the row activation counts and identifying aggressor rows.
