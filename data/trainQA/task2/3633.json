      "content": "Paper Title: Exploiting Neighbor Effect: Conv-Agnostic GNN Framework for Graphs with Heterophily\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare our method with the following baselines: (1) classical standard GNNs: GCN , GAT  and GIN ; (2) recent state-of-the-art GNNs of specific structure tackling heterophily: Geom-GCN , MixHop , H2GCN [ref]7, GPRGNN [ref]19, FAGCN [ref]14,\nGCN-Cheby ,\nJK-Net ,\nGCNII ;\nand (3) standard 2-layer MLP. To show the effectiveness and generalizability of our framework, we choose three simple GCN, GAT, and GIN as the graph convolution component in CAGNNs. For ease of comparison, we use the reported results of baselines in the literature  [ref]7. Moreover, for the missing results under these splits, we rerun the released code 10 times and report the mean and standard deviation. Classical GNNs GCN : GCN can be seen as a Laplacian smoother since it uses the mean aggregator to smooth each node and its neighbor’s features. GIN : GIN utilizes the MLP to model the injective function when aggregation and generalizes the WL test. GAT : GAT is a graph neural network that applies the attention mechanism on node features to learn edge weights for aggregation. Heterophily GNNs H2GCN [ref]14: H2GCN proposed three designs with separate ego and neighbors, hider-order neighbors and a combination of intermediate representations to combine the message from neighbors. FAGCN [ref]14: FAGCN divides the message from each edge into low-frequency and high-frequency signals during aggregation. GCN-Cheby : GCN-Cheby combines higher-order neighbor information with Chebyshev polynomials from the spectral domain. GEOM-GCN : GEOM-GCN utilizes structural similarity to capture the smooth structure in the latent space and long-range dependencies. MixHop : MixHop repeatedly mixes feature representations of neighbors at various distances to achieve higher-order message passing. GPRGNN [ref]19: GPRGNN modifies the convolution to the generalized page rank and learned an arbitrary polynomial graph filter to incorporate multi-scale information. JK-Net : JK-Net combines intermediate node representations from each layer by concatenating them in the final layer. GCNII : The state-of-the-art deep model combines initial connections and identity mapping to train a very deep GCN.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: our method with the following baselines: (1) classical standard GNNs: GCN , GAT  and GIN ; (2) recent state-of-the-art GNNs of specific structure tackling heterophily: Geom-GCN , MixHop , H2GCN [ref]7, GPRGNN [ref]19, FAGCN [ref]14,\nGCN-Cheby ,\nJK-Net ,\nGCNII ;\nand (3) standard 2-layer MLP.
