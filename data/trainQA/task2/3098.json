      "content": "Paper Title: Geometric Multimodal Deep Learning with Multi-Scaled Graph Wavelet Convolutional Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMultimodal data are generally composed of several heterogeneous data gathered from multiple real-world phenomena. Different modalities provide parts of the description of a phenomenon from various source domains usually with very different statistical properties. Unlike the unimodal data that may indicate only partial information of an entity, multimodal data provide complementary information by leveraging and fusing modality-specific knowledge [ref]1. Although each modality has its distinct statistical properties, the modalities are usually semantically correlated. Multimodal learning tries to improve the performance in applications with multimodal data by discovering the hidden intra-modality and cross-modality correlations. To apply the geometry-aware data analysis for multimodal problems, data in various modalities can be implicitly represented based on their geometric structures such as graphs, manifolds, and meshed surfaces. Also, there are an increasing number of applications, in which data are generated in non-Euclidean geometries and inherently defined for example as a graph. These applications represent complex relationships and interdependencies among objects , including social networks, citation networks, networks of the spread of epidemic diseases, e-commerce networks, brainâ€™s neuronal networks, biological regulatory networks, and so on. Due to the increasing growth of non-Euclidean data with explicit or implicit geometric structures, and success of deep learning models in capturing hidden patterns in various domains, many deep learning methods have recently been revolutionized to be applied on geometrically structured domains. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are the most common networks developing deep learning methods for graphs as the geometric structure of data, which perform filtering operations directly on the graph via the graph weights .\nGraph convolutional network (GCN) can learn the local meaningful stationary properties of the input signals through especially designed convolution operator on graphs . GCN represents node features (also called node embeddings) within these local neighborhoods on the graph to learn graph embedding for node classification, graph signal classification, graph regression, and so on .\nComplex geometric structures in graphs can be encoded with the strong mathematical tools in many spatial or spectral graph-based methods . In spatial graph-based methods, the convolution on each vertex is directly defined by aggregating feature information from all its neighbors . Spectral graph-based methods define convolution by leveraging graph Fourier transform to convert signals defined in vertex domain into the spectral domain using convolution theorem [ref]7. Most of the recent multimodal data analysis methods are limited because are based on two simplifying assumptions: 1) there is the same number of data samples in each modality (the homogeneity assumption), and 2) at least partial correspondences and/or non-correspondences between modalities are given as prior knowledge. Obviously, these assumptions are unrealistic in practical machine learning scenarios . The success of GCNs for unimodal graph-based data and the limitations of current multimodal methods in practical problems motivates the approach proposed in this paper, that is extending spectral GCN models to multimodal graph-based data. Although various spectral and spatial methods are developed to extend convolutional neural networks on graph-based data, there are not numerous methods for extending GCNs for multimodal graph-based domains. The main purpose of this work is to introduce a novel spectral GCN on graph-based multimodal data in a more practical scenario, in which it is only known that the data points of various modalities are sampled from the same phenomena. In this paper, we proposed a multimodal graph wavelet convolutional network (M-GWCN), with an end-to-end learning. Unlike existing spectral graph-based methods that apply graph Fourier transforms for providing localization properties of the spectral domain, M-GWCN uses graph wavelet transforms as a multiresolution analysis of graph signals. Besides the capability of M-GWCN in highly localizing in the vertex domain, it can simultaneously localize signal content in both spatial and spectral domains (Graph wavelets from the spectral graph theory point of view are studied in ). To prevent over-smoothing, M-GWCN is equipped with an initial residual connection mechanism. It makes sure that the representation at each layer contains a portion of the initial features. To avoid the expensive spectral decomposition for diagonalizing the graph Laplacian, we apply the Chebyshev polynomial method for approximating the graph wavelet bases. This approximation enables the M-GWCN to be applicable for large graphs. The proposed M-GWCN consists of two main parts. In the first part, a graph convolution is conducted by applying multi-scaled graph wavelet transforms in each modality. Graph wavelet bases obtained with different scales provide valuable localization properties in graph domain of each modality. These properties are applied for intra-modality representation of feature vectors of each graph. In the second part, cross-modality representations are computed in one layer, that is responsible for data fusion. In this layer, permutations for encoding the cross-modality correlations are learned by applying new loss function and regularization terms. The main contributions of this paper are briefly summarized as follows: We generalize the spectral GCN model to multimodal graph-based data domains as a problem that has rarely been addressed. We consider a general scenario for multimodal problems with unpaired data in the heterogeneous modalities, which needs no prior knowledge. We introduce a new spectral GCN model that in parallel applies graph wavelet transforms with different scaling parameters in each modality. This method prevents over-smoothing by introducing initial residual connections. We develop a new efficient network with end-to-end learning that simultaneously applies feature mapping on each modality and explores permutations for representing the cross-modality correlations among various modalities. We experimentally demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed M-GWCN model on three unimodal explicit graph-based datasets and five multimodal datasets, which are not explicitly defined as graphs, but the graphs are constructed based on them implicitly. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Related works are reviewed in section II. In section III, we overview the background and the basic notations. Our proposed methods are introduced in section IV. Experimental results are presented and discussed in section V. Finally, section VI concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: properties.
