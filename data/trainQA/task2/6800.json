      "content": "Paper Title: Explainable AI for clinical risk prediction: a survey of concepts, methods, and modalities\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe have previously described several paradigms and methods underpinning inherently interpretable models in AI, including classic models in machine learning, such as decision trees and rule-based models. Often, because these models do not require any post-prediction or post-inference interpretability, they get classified as ante-hoc methods. In cases of models that are not IIM, such as deep learning models or large ensembles, a post-hoc explanation framework needs to be applied after the fact, post-model learning that is separate from the model itself. Under the post-hoc category, we can define two subroups, those post-hoc methods that only work for specific data modalities or models, and model-agnostic explainability methods. The post-hoc approach attempts to address the trade-off between high interpretability and high predictive performance by providing methods to add-on interpretability to complex but high-performing models. Thus, instead of developing an IIM which, as we have seen, suffers under certain constraints either as part of the assumptions or model prediction capabilities, post-hoc explanations can be paired with a wide swath of complex AI models to extract interpretability without understanding the inherent reasoning of the model itself. There has been recent work on making deep neural models ante-hoc interpretable including approaches like self-explainable neural networks (SENNs) and CoFrNets. SENNs rely on staggered generalisation of linear models as a function of locally interpretable functions and representations of the input. The example of the model structure can be seen in . So far, SENNs have only been tested on a few tabular and extracted imaging data. CoFrNets, on the other hand, rely on the mathematics of continued fractions (CFs), typically represented as a ladder-like sequence: a0+b1a1+b2a2+‚ãØsubscriptùëé0subscriptùëè1subscriptùëé1subscriptùëè2subscriptùëé2‚ãØa_{0}+\\frac{b_{1}}{a_{1}+\\frac{b_{2}}{a_{2}+\\cdots}} which can represent any real number and any analytic function . Using the repeating structure and linear activations in between layers (which can be shown are sufficient to achieve universal approximation), the input is passed to each layer and a linear number of weights is learned for each layer instead of the quadratic amount in classic neural networks [ref]74. Per-example feature importance is then computed using the gradients throughout the ladder as a function of the input and global attributions taking advantage of the ladder being a representation of a multivariate power series with the coefficients of the two forms mapping one-to-one. Further work is needed, however, to establish the high predictive performance compared to other black-box deep learning models. Both of the previous methods touch upon conceptual learning, that is, when deep learning models learn from data, they, in fact, extract key concepts important for making the predictions. If one could extract these internal learning concepts, then one would be a lot closer to understanding the internal reasoning of the models, thus making them more explainable. Recently published work builds on this approach by appending a concept generation module (encoder) to jointly optimise for interpretable concepts on top of a latent encoder used for image classification. The concepts are then passed to a decoder to estimate reconstruction error and thus provide an indirect way to measure how \"interpretable\" the concepts are by how well they reconstruct the input. The concepts learned are individually informative by enforcing a fidelity loss. One does not have to rely on the concepts being directly supervisable (i.e. ground truth annotations are not available) because using self-supervision through incorporation of a separate loss function as an auxiliary task allows extension to more learning problems. Even though the framework adds components to existing deep learning models, most can be discarded after training and explanation-generating module can be used at prediction time [ref]75. More experiments need to be done to show good explainability and predictive performance on datasets with varying sizes, including those that are not just image-based, but the conceptual learning paradigm offers a motivating approach to ante-hoc explainability of black-box neural networks. A more popular field of inquiry has been post-hoc methods which provide interpretability and limited explainability after model training, inference, and deployment. These include feature attribution (global and local) methods like Shapley values which adapt concepts from game theory to investigate feature importance and contributions to predictions. A Shapley value is calculated for each feature jùëój with feature value xjsubscriptùë•ùëóx_{j}, usually based only on the test set for risk prediction, by using sets of all possible unions with mùëöm features except feature jùëój. The value is the difference between the results of the characteristic function vùë£v on MùëÄM (the set of all features) and SùëÜS (the subset of MùëÄM without feature jùëój). The Shapley value is then averaged across the marginal contributions of all possible combinations of the feature unions: Shapley values are simultaneously useful for both finding the contribution of each feature to an individual prediction as well as providing global explainability across all samples  . Calculating the value itself is usually computationally expensive even on small test datasets, at which point kernel sampling estimators are used to summarise the process. By defining a specific kernel in KernelSHAP allows for a smaller number of necessary samples by a combination of sampling and penalized linear regression. The method does not, however, take feature dependence into account, especially in its kernel version leading to over-weighing outlier data points. The tree version of SHAP addresses this but its reliance on conditional expected predictions is known to produce noise as non-intuitive feature importance values . A slightly earlier proposed method, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), focuses only on explaining local or individual predictions. LIME relies on introducing perturbations on the training data and observing how they affect the corresponding predictions given an interpretable model like some of the IIMs mentioned earlier all the while approximating the black-box model in the neighbourhood of the sample . In applications to clinical risk prediction, the method has been found to produce unstable feature importance due to random perturbations. [ref]78 propose DLIME (D standing for deterministic), which uses hierarchical clustering to group the training data together and kNN to select the relevant cluster of the new instance being explained instead of relying on randomness. Evaluated on clinical risk problems, DLIME presents a more stable version of instance-wise interpretability than its predecessor. LIME and SHAP present foundational interpretability methods due to their widespread adoption and relatively clear heuristics. Local Interpretable Visual Explanations (LIVE) build on the LIME paradigm by prioritising the visualisation of the interpretability results while keeping the random data perturbations approach and local point variation. While LIVE does not require an interpretable input space since it approximates the black box model directly from the data, it has no theoretical foundation like Shapley values. BreakDown uses a non-local approach to post-hoc, model agnostic interpretability that permutes the data samples based on relaxed loss effect constraints instead of relying on random sampling . The space of features is searched to look for a set of variables where the model prediction will be close to the average expected value across all model predictions. To reduce the computational complexity of the search, a greedy approach is taken. These methods, however, decompose final prediction into additive attribution components and usually do not work well for models with significant inter-feature correlations. Manipulating feature input and evaluating its effects on the outcome is a common set-up of many interpetability methods. The contrastive explanations method (CEM) finds what features should be minimally and sufficiently present to justify its classification and analogously what should be minimally and necessarily absent. This method was evaluated on deep learning models for applications including brain activity prediction but generating explanations of the form \"an input xùë•x is classified in class yùë¶y because features fj,‚ãØ,fksubscriptùëìùëó‚ãØsubscriptùëìùëòf_{j},\\cdots,f_{k} are present and because features fm,‚ãØ,fpsubscriptùëìùëö‚ãØsubscriptùëìùëùf_{m},\\cdots,f_{p} are absent\" . As compared to other methods like LIME, CEM highlights what features need to be present for a specific classification and not just list positively or negatively relevant features that may not be necessary or sufficient to justify the classification. Finding this set of features is defined as an optimisation problem where the modified data is sampled close to the original by using reconstructions from an autoencoder. These types of explanations might be more intuitive to many clinical applications especially in diagnosis as highlighted by . Finding the contrastive explanations can be aided using an adversarial model, for example, but the method‚Äôs limitations of defining what contrastive examples would represent in complex data cases like timeseries has not been sufficiently explored. An image pixel can be made into a constrastive case by being set to 0 but greyscale examples would encounter challenges while a similar approach for timeseries would not be robust . Post-hoc methods are generally model agnostic and apply to a myriad of black box models by directly manipulating the input either through finding a subset of data points or examples that are more \"informative\" or explainable to the prediction or a subset of the feature space that does the same. ProtoDash is a method that generated prototypes from the data and assigns non-negative weights to each of them depending on their importance to the prediction problem. Since each set of prototypes can be weighted, ProtoDash offers a robust response in cases of class imbalance which have been shown to affect the fidelity of earlier interpretability methods . Effectively, ProtoDash is an instance-based interpretability method as the prototypes it samples are examples of samples that would be more important for a prediction rather than features as such. Other earlier instance-level methods like K-medoids and MMD attempt to do the same but ProtoDash provides more general rule explanations with more robust kernel performance that help identify cases of low test accuracy while being relatively constant in its interpretability  . So far we have only discussed methods that manipulate the data space in some form to evaluate feature or example importance for prediction, but other post-hoc paradigms exist that more directly measure model learning. In deep learning, computed gradients are used to update weights through the learning procedure. In cases such as images or timeseries with spatio-temporal dimensionality, visualising the absolute weights of the gradient updates across those dimensions can indicate what part of the example image or timeseries is more influential for a prediction averaged across all examples . Examples include using visual saliency maps to highlight sections of ECG signal important for arrhythmia classification or x-ray images with lung cancer detection which can aid in learning while providing clinicians with more explainable model predictions  . These saliency maps are often sensitive to noise in the input and several approaches have been proposed to address these limitations including by adding noise to the data multiple times and then taking the average of the resulting saliency maps for each example like with SmoothGrad . Newer methods like saliency guided training have features iteratively masked with low gradient values and then minimise a combined loss function of the KL divergence between model outputs from the original and masked inputs, and the model‚Äôs own loss function. Experiments have shown the latter maintains higher predictive performance while simultaneously reducing noise sensitivity . General limitations of saliency maps in clinical risk prediction have been their tendency to represent clinically non-useful information as important as evaluated by physicians and simply localising the area of the example does not add further intepretability on why that area is important for model learning which can appear misleading to domain experts . They have also been vulnerable to adversarial attacks when explanations remain unchanged even after significant adversarial perturbation in the input has changed model behaviour . Visualising weights from the learning process to highlight which aspects of the data the model focuses on for training is the underlying heuristic of attention mechanisms which became a highly popular deep learning model-specific method to achieve better predictive performance while providing more interpretable results. An attention function maps a query and a set of key-value pairs where the output is computed as a weighted sum of the values and the weights are computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key. Multi-head attention parallelises the attention layers to project multiple mappings simultaneously. A comparison of the two frameworks can be seen in . Compared to recurrent layers for learning sequences of data requiring O‚Äã(n)ùëÇùëõO(n) operations, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, thus being computationally cheaper. In the example of timeseries data, the first step is to initialise the attention vectors mapped to the features such that for each feature jùëój an attention vector ùíÇjsubscriptùíÇùëó\\boldsymbol{a}_{j} of length TùëáT (number of time-steps) is learned with |ùíÇj|=1subscriptùíÇùëó1\\left|\\boldsymbol{a}_{j}\\right|=1: where ùëøùëø\\boldsymbol{X} represents the T√ómùëáùëöT\\times m input data (mùëöm number of variables). Once sofmax normalisation is applied, ùíÇj‚ÄãtsubscriptùíÇùëóùë°\\boldsymbol{a}_{jt} can be interpreted as a contribution of feature jùëój within a fixed time step tùë°t.  extend this for global interpretability by applying the softmax to the transposed input with the same notation: By aggregating values ùíÇj‚Äã1,‚Ä¶,ùíÇj‚ÄãTsubscriptùíÇùëó1‚Ä¶subscriptùíÇùëóùëá\\boldsymbol{a}_{j1},\\ldots,\\boldsymbol{a}_{jT} through time one can get the global contribution of the jùëój-th feature ùíôtsubscriptùíôùë°\\boldsymbol{x}_{t} and weights ùëætsubscriptùëæùë°\\boldsymbol{W}_{t} at time tùë°t. Not only is an absolute ranking of features provided, but one can use the softmax activation matrix to extract patient-level feature importance as well as visualise the attention weights using heatmaps (attention maps) both in timeseries and imaging problems, similar to the saliency maps scenario despite early criticism of the lack of explainability of such maps for standard attention mechanisms . Some results do indicate better interpretability of the attention plots but further experiments are still needed to evaluate the fidelity of this approach in achieving the proposed changes in interpretability. Since being originally proposed in 2017 as an alternative to convolutional and recurrent behaviour in deep learning pattern recognition, transformers (models based solely on attention mechanisms) have become robust prediction models in various applications for clinical risk prediction, including ICU outcome prediction, ECG signal diagnosis, and blood pressure response     . Some limitations include inability to distinguish between positive and negative associations among features and output, lack of propagated relevancy through the attention layers partially addressed through a new layer-propagation strategy, and unstable interpretability with covariate shift  . We have seen in this section a combination of methods that try to address the interpretability aspects of explainability using both innovative ante-hoc glass-box approaches to deep learning as well as what have become off-the-shelf methods like LIME and SHAP. Most of the methods share limitations on their robustness to random noise, permutation and covariate shift, as well as a lack of clinical evaluation of their inherent interpretability qualities.\n\nReference markers found: [74]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]74: sufficient to achieve universal approximation), the input is passed to each layer and a linear number of weights is learned for each layer instead of the quadratic amount in classic neural networks [ref]74.
