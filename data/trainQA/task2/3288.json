      "content": "Paper Title: A full dichotomy for Holantc, inspired by quantum computation1footnote 11footnote 1This paper combines extended versions of the conference publications [1] and [3] with some new results.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nQuantum computation provided the inspiration for holographic algorithms , which in turn inspired the holant framework for computational counting problems (first introduced in the conference version of [ref]18).\nComputational counting problems include a variety of computational problems, from combinatorial problems defined on graphs to the problems of computing partition functions in statistical physics and computing amplitudes in quantum computation.\nThey are being analysed in different frameworks, including that of counting constraint satisfaction problems (counting CSPs) and that of holant problems.\nComputational counting problems are an area of active research, yet so far there appear to have been no attempts to apply knowledge from quantum information theory or quantum computation to their analysis.\nNevertheless, as we show in the following, quantum information theory, and particularly the theory of quantum entanglement, offer promising new avenues of research into holant problems. A holant problem is parameterised by a set of functions ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}; in this paper we consider finite sets of algebraic complex-valued functions of Boolean inputs.\nThe restriction to finite sets follows the standard in the counting CSP community.\nWe use it to avoid issues around efficient computability that arise when allowing problems to be parameterised by infinite sets of functions.\nIn the following, the set of all algebraic complex-valued functions of Boolean inputs is denoted ΥΥ\\Upsilon.\nWe also write Υn:={f∈Υ∣arity⁡(f)=n}assignsubscriptΥ𝑛conditional-set𝑓Υarity𝑓𝑛\\Upsilon_{n}:=\\{f\\in\\Upsilon\\mid\\operatorname{arity}(f)=n\\} for the restriction of ΥΥ\\Upsilon to functions of arity n𝑛n.\nAn instance of the problem 𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍​(ℱ)𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍ℱ\\mathsf{Holant}(\\mathcal{F}) consist of a multigraph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) with vertices V𝑉V and edges E𝐸E, and a map π𝜋\\pi.\nThis map assigns to each vertex v∈V𝑣𝑉v\\in V a function π​(v)=fv∈ℱ𝜋𝑣subscript𝑓𝑣ℱ\\pi(v)=f_{v}\\in\\mathcal{F}.\nThe map also sets up a bijection between the edges incident on v𝑣v and the arguments of fvsubscript𝑓𝑣f_{v}, so the degree of v𝑣v must equal the arity of fvsubscript𝑓𝑣f_{v}.\nGiven the map π𝜋\\pi, any assignment σ:E→{0,1}:𝜎→𝐸01\\sigma:E\\to\\{0,1\\} of Boolean values to edges induces a weight where σ|E​(v)evaluated-at𝜎𝐸𝑣\\sigma|_{E(v)} is the restriction of σ𝜎\\sigma to the edges incident on v𝑣v.\nThe desired output of the holant problem is the total weight ∑σ:E→{0,1}wt⁡(σ)subscript:𝜎→𝐸01wt𝜎\\sum_{\\sigma:E\\to\\{0,1\\}}\\operatorname{wt}(\\sigma), where the sum is over all assignments σ𝜎\\sigma.\nFormally, we define the problem 𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍​(ℱ)𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍ℱ\\mathsf{Holant}(\\mathcal{F}) as follows. 𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍​(ℱ)𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍ℱ\\mathsf{Holant}(\\mathcal{F}) A tuple (G,ℱ,π)𝐺ℱ𝜋(G,\\mathcal{F},\\pi). HolantΩ=∑σ:E→{0,1}∏v∈Vfv​(σ|E​(v))subscriptHolantΩsubscript:𝜎→𝐸01subscriptproduct𝑣𝑉subscript𝑓𝑣evaluated-at𝜎𝐸𝑣\\operatorname{Holant}_{\\Omega}=\\sum_{\\sigma:E\\to\\{0,1\\}}\\prod_{v\\in V}f_{v}(\\sigma|_{E(v)}). For example, let N∈ℕ>0𝑁subscriptℕabsent0N\\in\\mathbb{N}_{>0}, and define ℳN:={ONEn∣1≤n≤N}assignsubscriptℳ𝑁conditional-setsubscriptONE𝑛1𝑛𝑁\\mathcal{M}_{N}:=\\{\\mathrm{ONE}_{n}\\mid 1\\leq n\\leq N\\}, where Then 𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍​(ℳN)𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍subscriptℳ𝑁\\mathsf{Holant}(\\mathcal{M}_{N}) corresponds to counting the number of perfect matchings on graphs of maximum degree N𝑁N.\nTo see this, consider some graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) with maximum degree N𝑁N.\nThe map π𝜋\\pi must assign to each vertex a function of appropriate arity and since all functions are invariant under permutations of the arguments, this means π𝜋\\pi is fully determined by this requirement.\nConsider an assignment σ:E→{0,1}:𝜎→𝐸01\\sigma:E\\to\\{0,1\\}, this corresponds to a subset of edges Eσ:={e∈E∣σ​(e)=1}assignsubscript𝐸𝜎conditional-set𝑒𝐸𝜎𝑒1E_{\\sigma}:=\\{e\\in E\\mid\\sigma(e)=1\\}.\nNote that wt⁡(σ)∈{0,1}wt𝜎01\\operatorname{wt}(\\sigma)\\in\\{0,1\\} for all σ𝜎\\sigma, since each weight is a product of functions taking values in the set {0,1}01\\{0,1\\}.\nNow suppose wt⁡(σ)=1wt𝜎1\\operatorname{wt}(\\sigma)=1, then for each v∈V𝑣𝑉v\\in V, σ𝜎\\sigma assigns the value 1 to exactly one edge in E​(v)𝐸𝑣E(v).\nThus, Eσsubscript𝐸𝜎E_{\\sigma} is a perfect matching.\nConversely, if wt⁡(σ)=0wt𝜎0\\operatorname{wt}(\\sigma)=0 then there exists a vertex for which fv​(σ|E​(v))=0subscript𝑓𝑣evaluated-at𝜎𝐸𝑣0f_{v}(\\sigma|_{E(v)})=0.\nThis implies ∑e∈E​(v)σ​(e)≠1subscript𝑒𝐸𝑣𝜎𝑒1\\sum_{e\\in E(v)}\\sigma(e)\\neq 1, i.e. either 0 or at least 2 of the edges incident on v𝑣v are assigned 1 by σ𝜎\\sigma.\nThus, Eσsubscript𝐸𝜎E_{\\sigma} contains either no edges incident on v𝑣v, or at least 2 edges incident on v𝑣v, so Eσsubscript𝐸𝜎E_{\\sigma} is not a perfect matching.\nWe have shown that wt⁡(σ)=1wt𝜎1\\operatorname{wt}(\\sigma)=1 if σ𝜎\\sigma corresponds to a perfect matching and wt⁡(σ)=0wt𝜎0\\operatorname{wt}(\\sigma)=0 otherwise.\nThe correspondence between assignments σ:E→{0,1}:𝜎→𝐸01\\sigma:E\\to\\{0,1\\} and subsets Eσ⊆Esubscript𝐸𝜎𝐸E_{\\sigma}\\subseteq E is a bijection.\nTherefore, the total weight – and hence the output of 𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍​(ℱ)𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍ℱ\\mathsf{Holant}(\\mathcal{F}) – is exactly the number of perfect matchings of G𝐺G. Sometimes it is interesting to restrict holant problems to instances defined on planar graphs.\nIn that case, the correspondence between the edges incident on a vertex v𝑣v and the arguments of its assigned function fvsubscript𝑓𝑣f_{v} must respect the ordering of the edges in the given planar embedding of the graph and the ordering of the arguments of the function.\nThis means that choosing an edge to correspond to the first argument of fvsubscript𝑓𝑣f_{v} fixes the bijection between edges and arguments for all the remaining edges and arguments.\nGiven a finite set of functions ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}, the problem of computing holant values on planar graphs is denoted 𝖯𝗅​-​𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍​(ℱ)𝖯𝗅-𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍ℱ\\mathsf{Pl\\text{-}Holant}(\\mathcal{F}).\nFor example, 𝖯𝗅​-​𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍​(ℳN)𝖯𝗅-𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍subscriptℳ𝑁\\mathsf{Pl\\text{-}Holant}(\\mathcal{M}_{N}) is the problem of counting perfect matchings on planar graphs of maximum degree N𝑁N. The complexity of holant problems has not been fully classified yet, but there exist a number of classifications for subfamilies of holant problems.\nThese classifications restrict the family of problems in one or more of the following ways: by considering only symmetric functions, i.e. functions that are invariant under any permutation of the arguments (these functions depend only on the Hamming weight of their input), or by restricting the codomain, e.g. to algebraic real numbers or even non-negative real numbers, or by considering only sets of functions that contain some specified subset of functions, such as arbitrary unary functions or the two ‘pinning functions’ δ0​(x)=1−xsubscript𝛿0𝑥1𝑥\\delta_{0}(x)=1-x and δ1​(x)=xsubscript𝛿1𝑥𝑥\\delta_{1}(x)=x. Known classification include a full dichotomy for holant problems where all unary functions are assumed to be available , and a classification for 𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍c​(ℱ):=𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍​(ℱ∪{δ0,δ1})assignsuperscript𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍𝑐ℱ𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍ℱsubscript𝛿0subscript𝛿1\\mathsf{Holant}^{c}\\left(\\mathcal{F}\\right):=\\mathsf{Holant}\\left(\\mathcal{F}\\cup\\{\\delta_{0},\\delta_{1}\\}\\right) with symmetric functions .\nThere is also a dichotomy for real-valued 𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍csuperscript𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍𝑐\\mathsf{Holant}^{c}, where functions need not be symmetrical but must take values in ℝℝ\\mathbb{R} instead of ℂℂ\\mathbb{C} .\nBoth existing results about 𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍csuperscript𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍𝑐\\mathsf{Holant}^{c} are proved via dichotomies for counting CSPs with complex-valued, not necessarily symmetric functions (see Section 3.2 for a formal definition): in the first case, a dichotomy for general #​𝖢𝖲𝖯#𝖢𝖲𝖯\\#\\mathsf{CSP} [ref]18, and in the second case, a dichotomy for #​𝖢𝖲𝖯2c#superscriptsubscript𝖢𝖲𝖯2𝑐\\#\\mathsf{CSP}_{2}^{c}, a subfamily of #​𝖢𝖲𝖯#𝖢𝖲𝖯\\#\\mathsf{CSP} in which each variable must appear an even number of times and variables can be pinned to 0 or 1 .\nThe only broad classifications not assuming availability of certain functions are the dichotomy for symmetric holant  and the dichotomy for non-negative real-valued holant . The problem of computing amplitudes in quantum computation can also be expressed as a holant problem.\nThis makes certain holant problems examples of (strong) classical simulation of quantum computations, an area of active research in the theory of quantum computation.\nIf a quantum computation can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer, the quantum computer yields no advantage.\nIf, on the other hand, the complexity of classically simulating a certain family of quantum computations can be shown to satisfy some hardness condition, this provides evidence that quantum computations are indeed more powerful than classical computers. Indeed, while the origin of holant problems is not related to the notion of classical simulation of quantum computations, quantum computing did provide the inspiration for its origins  [ref]18.\nNevertheless, so far there have been no attempts to apply knowledge from quantum information theory or quantum computation to the analysis of holant problems.\nYet, as we show in the following, quantum information theory, and particularly the theory of quantum entanglement, offer promising new avenues of research into holant problems. The complexity of 𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍​(ℱ)𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍ℱ\\mathsf{Holant}\\left(\\mathcal{F}\\right) may depend on decomposability properties of the functions in ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}.\nA function f∈Υn𝑓subscriptΥ𝑛f\\in\\Upsilon_{n} is considered to be decomposable if there exists a permutation ρ:[n]→[n]:𝜌→delimited-[]𝑛delimited-[]𝑛\\rho:[n]\\to[n], an integer k𝑘k satisfying 1≤k<n1𝑘𝑛1\\leq k<n, and functions f1,f2subscript𝑓1subscript𝑓2f_{1},f_{2} such that For example, the constant function f​(x1,x2)=1𝑓subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥21f(x_{1},x_{2})=1 is equal to f1​(x1)​f2​(x2)subscript𝑓1subscript𝑥1subscript𝑓2subscript𝑥2f_{1}(x_{1})f_{2}(x_{2}), where f1​(x)=f2​(x)=1subscript𝑓1𝑥subscript𝑓2𝑥1f_{1}(x)=f_{2}(x)=1.\nNot all functions are decomposable: there are no functions g1,g2∈Υ1subscript𝑔1subscript𝑔2subscriptΥ1g_{1},g_{2}\\in\\Upsilon_{1} such that EQ2​(x1,x2)=g1​(x1)​g2​(x2)subscriptEQ2subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2subscript𝑔1subscript𝑥1subscript𝑔2subscript𝑥2\\mathrm{EQ}_{2}(x_{1},x_{2})=g_{1}(x_{1})g_{2}(x_{2}). The functions in ΥnsubscriptΥ𝑛\\Upsilon_{n} are in bijection with the algebraic complex-valued vectors of length 2nsuperscript2𝑛2^{n} by mapping each function to a list of its values, or conversely.\nUnder this map, the notion of a function being non-decomposable corresponds exactly to the quantum-theoretical notion of a vector being genuinely entangled.\nWe therefore draw on the large body of research about the properties of entangled vectors from quantum theory, and apply it to the complexity classification of holant problems.\nIn the process, we also derive a new result about entanglement previously unknown in the quantum theory literature, this is Theorem 46. For relating the complexity of two computational problems, the main technique used in this paper is that of gadget reductions.\nAn n𝑛n-ary gadget over some set of functions ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} is a fragment of a signature grid using functions from ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}, which is connected to the rest of the graph by n𝑛n external edges.\nThis signature grid is assigned an effective function in ΥnsubscriptΥ𝑛\\Upsilon_{n} by treating the external edges as variables and summing over all possible assignments of Boolean values to the internal edges.\nIf the function g𝑔g is the effective function of some gadget over ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}, then we say g𝑔g is realisable over ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}.\nAllowing functions realisable over ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} in addition to the functions in ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} does not affect the complexity of computing the holant . Now, the problem 𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍​(ℱ)𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍ℱ\\mathsf{Holant}(\\mathcal{F}) is known to be polynomial-time computable if ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} contains only functions that decompose as products of unary and binary functions [12, Theorem 2.1].\nFor 𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍​(ℱ)𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍ℱ\\mathsf{Holant}(\\mathcal{F}) to be #P-hard, ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} must thus contain a function that does not decompose in this way.\nBorrowing terminology from quantum theory, we say functions that do not decompose as products of unary and binary functions have multipartite entanglement.\nBy applying results from quantum theory, we show how to build a gadget for a non-decomposable ternary function using an arbitrary function with multipartite entanglement and the four unary functions We further apply entanglement theory to analyse a family of symmetric ternary gadgets, and show that given some non-decomposable ternary function, this family lets us realise a symmetric non-decomposable ternary function.\nFurthermore, we show how to realise symmetric non-decomposable binary functions with specific properties.\nTogether, these gadgets allow us to classify the complexity of the problem 𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍+​(ℱ):=𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍​(ℱ∪{δ0,δ1,δ+,δ−})assignsuperscript𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍ℱ𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍ℱsubscript𝛿0subscript𝛿1subscript𝛿subscript𝛿\\mathsf{Holant}^{+}\\left(\\mathcal{F}\\right):=\\mathsf{Holant}\\left(\\mathcal{F}\\cup\\{\\delta_{0},\\delta_{1},\\delta_{+},\\delta_{-}\\}\\right). Let ℱ⊆ΥℱΥ\\mathcal{F}\\subseteq\\Upsilon be finite.\nThen 𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍+​(ℱ)superscript𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍ℱ\\mathsf{Holant}^{+}\\left(\\mathcal{F}\\right) can be computed in polynomial time if ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} satisfies one of five explicit conditions.\nIn all other cases, 𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍+​(ℱ)superscript𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍ℱ\\mathsf{Holant}^{+}\\left(\\mathcal{F}\\right) is #P-hard.\nThe same dichotomy holds when the problem is restricted to instances defined on planar graphs. By combining these entanglement-based techniques with techniques from the real-valued 𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍csuperscript𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍𝑐\\mathsf{Holant}^{c} classification in , we then develop a complexity classification for 𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍c​(ℱ):=𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍​(ℱ∪{δ0,δ1})assignsuperscript𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍𝑐ℱ𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍ℱsubscript𝛿0subscript𝛿1\\mathsf{Holant}^{c}\\left(\\mathcal{F}\\right):=\\mathsf{Holant}\\left(\\mathcal{F}\\cup\\{\\delta_{0},\\delta_{1}\\}\\right).\nThe problem 𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍csuperscript𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍𝑐\\mathsf{Holant}^{c} had first been described about a decade ago, with a full complexity classification remaining open until now. Let ℱ⊆ΥℱΥ\\mathcal{F}\\subseteq\\Upsilon be finite.\nThen 𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍c​(ℱ)superscript𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍𝑐ℱ\\mathsf{Holant}^{c}\\left(\\mathcal{F}\\right) can be computed in polynomial time if ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} satisfies one of six explicit conditions.\nIn all other cases, 𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍c​(ℱ)superscript𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍𝑐ℱ\\mathsf{Holant}^{c}\\left(\\mathcal{F}\\right) is #P-hard. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.\nWe introduce preliminary definitions in Section 2 and give an overview over known holant complexity classifications in Section 3.\nIn Section 4, we introduce relevant notions and results from quantum theory, particularly about entanglement.\nThe complexity classification for 𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍+superscript𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍\\mathsf{Holant}^{+} is derived in Section 5 and the complexity classification for 𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍csuperscript𝖧𝗈𝗅𝖺𝗇𝗍𝑐\\mathsf{Holant}^{c} is derived in Section 6.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: computation provided the inspiration for holographic algorithms , which in turn inspired the holant framework for computational counting problems (first introduced in the conference version of [ref]18).\nComputational counting problems include a variety of computational problems, from combinatorial problems defined on graphs to the problems of computing partition functions in statistical\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
