      "content": "Paper Title: OutfitTransformer: Learning Outfit Representations for Fashion Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOutfit Compatibility Prediction. Prior work on fashion outfit compatibility\noften considers pairwise item comparisons to predict the final compatibility score   [ref]25  .\nHowever, these algorithms usually perform aggregation of item-level scores to compute the entire outift compatibility score.\nTo add global constraints in scoring outfit compatibility, a number of methods  [ref]6  [ref]5 aggregate inputs from all constituent items.\nHan et al.  use a bidirectional LSTM to model outfit composition as a sequential process, considering outfits as ordered sequences. However, outfit compatibility should be invariant to the order of items in an outfit.\nSome recent approaches [ref]6  use a graph convolutional network (GCN) for outfit compatibility prediction.\nCucurull et al. [ref]6 train a graph neural network that generates embeddings conditioned on the representations of neighboring nodes.\nThey use GCN to model the node relationship and predict the outfit compatibility but require large neighbor information for best performance, which is impractical for new items as mentioned in .\nCui et al.  model an outfit as a graph, where each node represents a category and each edge represents interaction between two categories.\nChen et al. [ref]5 (hrta. POG) propose a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture for generating compatible outfits that are specifically designed for personalization based on historical clicks data.\nAll these approaches  [ref]6  [ref]5 are mainly designed for classification tasks (CP and FITB ) but do not address large-scale CIR. Outfit Complementary Item Retrieval. Although the compatibility prediction score in previous methods can be used for ranking items, it is impractical to do so in a large-scale setting. The framework must support indexing to avoid linearly scanning the entire database.\nLin et al.  propose a framework to retrieve complementary items that match the entire outfit. Their method retrieves items by considering compatibility between the target item and every\nitem in an outfit in a pairwise manner, and then aggregating the scores. However, they do not consider the outfit as a whole and only use attention at a paired-category level. In contrast, we use a transformer model to capture interactions between all the items in an outfit to learn a global outfit representation. Aso, our method has a much smaller indexing size than  which is important for practical applications (cf. Section 3.2.3).\nLorbert et al.  use a single layer self-attention based framework for outfit generation but do not explicitly model compatibility. Attention-Based Methods and Vision Transformers. There has been considerable research using transformers in a wide variety of computer vision tasks  0  2. Vision transformers  and related models  3  decompose each image into an ordered sequence of smaller patches to learn image representation of a single image for different tasks. On the contrary, we model outfits as an unordered set of different item images and use a transformer-based architecture to learn a global outfit representation that captures overall outfit compatibility. As discussed earlier in this section, attention mechanisms   [ref]5  have also been used in fashion recommendation systems.   use attention to understand complementary relationships in a pairwise manner. In contrast, we use a transformer model to learn interactions between all the items in an outfit, which attends to higher-order compatibility relationships  beyond pairwise [ref]25  .\nBoth POG [ref]5 and  use pretrained ImageNet embeddings, while we learn fashion-specific features by training in an end-to-end manner. Distance Metric Learning: CIR is a fundamentally different task from visual similarity search because the complementary item is from a different category and is visually dissimilar from the other items in the outfit. We specifically design a negative sampling strategy for CIR where we sample negatives from the same category as positive samples, unlike  .\nAlso, in contrast to  [ref]25 , which consider pair-wise compatibility between target items and each individual item in the outfit, we propose a set-wise outfit ranking loss that compares target items with a single embedding for the entire outfit.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: Outfit Compatibility Prediction.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
