      "content": "Paper Title: Less is More: Data-Efficient Complex Question Answering over Knowledge Bases\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs the symbolic executor executes non-differentiable operations against a KB, it is difficult to utilize end-to-end back-propagation to optimize the neural generator.\nTherefore, we adopt the following two-step procedure to train the generator.\nBy using a breadth-first-search (BFS) algorithm, we generate pseudo-gold action sequences for a tiny subset of questions.\nIn BFS, we assemble all the operators and KG artifacts found in question to form candidate action sequences in a brute-force way.\nWe then execute the candidate action sequences to find the ones that yield the right answer and view them as pseudo-gold action sequences.\nUsing these pairs of questions and action sequences, we pre-train the model by Teacher Forcing. We then employ RL to fine-tune the generator on another set of question-answer pairs.\nThe symbolic executor executes the predicted action sequence to output an answer and yield a reward for RL.\nThe reward is the similarity between the output answer and the gold answer. As shown in Algorithm 1, our method works as follows.\nThe training starts with an empty memory buffer, and at every epoch, for each sample, the generated trials that gain high reward will be stored in the memory.\nFor each question, we first use a search algorithm, i.e., greedy-decoding, to generate a trial.\nWe execute the trial and compute a reward rg​r​e​e​d​ysubscript𝑟𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑑𝑦r_{greedy}, which is set as the reward threshold.\nThen we employ a beam search method to generate a set of candidate trials for the question and compute their rewards.\nAt every epoch, we compare the generated trials with the trials in memory to determine the reward bonus, aka proximity and novelty, and further add the reward bonus to the adaptive reward.\nA candidate trial is added into the memory buffer if its reward is higher than rg​r​e​e​d​ysubscript𝑟𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑑𝑦r_{greedy}.\nWe utilize the augmented reward to train the policy under the RL setting. The memory buffer stores a limited set of trials for the training questions.\nOnce the memory buffer is full, we substitute a random trial with the current new trial.\nThis strategy enables the memory buffer to maintain relatively fresher trials, but would not always abandon the older ones. The main components of our training paradigm, namely the RL method, the adaptive reward, and the curriculum reward bonus, are described in the rest of this section. In this step, REINFORCE [ref]41 is used to finetune the neural generator.\nTypically, the three notions mentioned in RL are action, state, and reward, respectively.\nIn our scenario, at each step, action as a fundamental concept in RL is a token produced by a neural generator used to form an executable action sequence.\nWhat needs to be clarified is that when related to RL, the concept of actions refers to the tokens of a trial.\nSince the complex question answering environment is deterministic, we define the state as the question combined with the generated tokens so far.\nMeanwhile, the reward is the same as the notion in RL. In our work, the state, action and reward at time step t𝑡t are denoted as stsubscript𝑠𝑡s_{t}, atsubscript𝑎𝑡a_{t} and rtsubscript𝑟𝑡r_{t} respectively.\nGiven a question q𝑞{q}, the state of time step t𝑡t is defined by q𝑞{q} and the action sequence so far: st=(q,a0:t−1)subscript𝑠𝑡𝑞subscript𝑎:0𝑡1s_{t}=(q,a_{0:t-1}), and the action tokens are generated by the generator.\nAt the last step of decoding T𝑇T, the entire sequence of actions is generated.\nThe symbolic executor will then execute the action sequence to produce an output answer a​n​so𝑎𝑛subscript𝑠𝑜ans_{o}.\nTherefore the reward is computed only after the last step of decoding when a​n​so𝑎𝑛subscript𝑠𝑜ans_{o} is output.\nWe design a Adaptive Reward Function (ARF), which is the adaptive comparison of the output answer a​n​so𝑎𝑛subscript𝑠𝑜ans_{o} and the gold answer a​n​sg𝑎𝑛subscript𝑠𝑔ans_{g}.\nFurthermore, we employ a curriculum-guided Reward Bonus (CRB), which comprises proximity and novelty, to assign non-zero rewards for actions that do not yield correct answers.\nSpecifically, the cumulative reward of an action sequence a0:Tsubscript𝑎:0𝑇a_{0:T} is the sum of CRB and ARF: Then R​(q,a0:T)𝑅𝑞subscript𝑎:0𝑇R(q,a_{0:T}) is sent back to update parameters of the neural generator through a REINFORCE objective as the supervision signal. Though the search space is significantly reduced to O​(17N)𝑂superscript17𝑁O(17^{N}) after the masking and copy mechanisms are incorporated, the length of action sequence, which is N𝑁N, would be fairly long when solving a relatively more complex question.\nIn that case, O​(17N)𝑂superscript17𝑁O(17^{N}), the size of the search space, is still huge which makes it hard for the model to find correct action sequences when gold annotations are unavailable. Moreover, since the reward used to train the model could only be obtained after a sequence of actions is executed, the execution of actions is regarded as a part of training.\nSuppose a large amount of candidate action sequences (normally more than 50) are generated, their execution would consume a large amount of time since it involves searching triples in KB, performing set operations and discrete reasoning.\nTo reduce the training time, we limit our NS-CQA model to form only 5∼similar-to\\sim20 candidate action sequences with a smaller beam size.\nWith the huge search space and small beam size, the sparsity of the reward becomes a problem.\nOf all the candidate action sequences that are predicted, very few of them could output correct answers and be positively rewarded while most of them do not produce any reward.\nUnder such circumstances, without the notion of partial reward, the neural generator would suffer from high variance and instability.\nTherefore the generator would be inclined to be trapped in local optima and not generalize well on data never seen before. Furthermore, different categories of questions entail different answer types.\nThe reward function should be adaptive to the diverse answer types which could measure the degree of correctness of predicted answers more precisely.\nIn other words, the reward function should encourage the generator to generate action sequences with the correct answer type while punishing the model if the predicted answer type is incorrect. In the complex question answering scenario, the possible types of answers are integers, sets of entities and Boolean values.\nTo measure the answer correctness more accurately and adaptively, and to compute partial reward to alleviate the sparse reward problem, we define our adaptive reward function A​R​F𝐴𝑅𝐹ARF.\nA​R​F𝐴𝑅𝐹ARF computes reward based on different answer types using the function S​i​m𝑆𝑖𝑚Sim between the output answer a​n​so𝑎𝑛subscript𝑠𝑜ans_{o} and the gold answer a​n​sg𝑎𝑛subscript𝑠𝑔ans_{g}. The edit-score is used to measure the accuracy of the output provided the answer type is Boolean, while the F1-score is used as a reward when answer is a set of entities.\nWhen the answer type is Boolean, the expected output is a list of Boolean value, for instance as what is presented in Table 6, the expected answer of the question “s Alda Pereira-Lemaitre a citizen of France and Emmelsbull-Horsbull?” is [True, False].\nRegard each Boolean value as a single element in a list, the edit (Levenshtein) distance is used to compute the similarity between two lists, i.e., output answer list, and gold answer list.\nThus the similarity is calculated as follows: On the other hand, suppose the type of answer is a set of entities, F1-score is computed as: If the answer type is incorrect or the action sequence is sematically invalid, reward is set as 0.\nOn the other hand, if the answer type is the same as the gold answer, partial reward is granted.\nWe then defined A​R​F𝐴𝑅𝐹ARF as follows: In our work, ε𝜀\\varepsilon, W1subscript𝑊1W_{1} and W2subscript𝑊2W_{2} are predefined hyper-parameters and set as 0.0010.0010.001, 0.20.20.2 and 0.80.80.8 repectively.\nIf the type of predicted answer is correct, Rt​y​p​esubscript𝑅𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑒R_{type} is set as 111, otherwise 00. In many RL settings, the reward is positive only when a trial, i.e., a long sequence of actions generated by a policy, could yield the correct result.\nAt the initial stage, since the policy is not yet fully-trained, out of all the generated trials, the rate of successful trials is rare.\nThus, there is an insufficient number of collected successful trials for training the RL model, which causes the sparse reward problem. Besides, the suboptimal policy will not explore the search space effectively since many sampled trials could be repeated.\nMoreover, the policy will forget the rare successful trials easily since the trials may not be re-sampled frequently.\nThese factors often lead to the data inefficiency problem. To solve the above problems, we design two reward bonuses to learn from failed trials.\nWe introduce a memory buffer to record the high-reward trials for each training sample.\nWe compare a generated trial with those stored in the memory buffer to see how similar it is to the recorded trials.\nTherefore we give proximity bonus to a generated trial even if it fails to yield the correct answer.\nBy doing this, we could encourage the policy to re-sample the high-reward trials and accordingly reduce the frequency of generating infeasible trials.\nAlso, we give novelty bonus to the generated trials that differ from the trials in the memory buffer.\nThe novelty bonus encourages the policy to generate different trials, thus avoid being trapped by spurious ones.\nOnce the reward is augment with the above two bonuses, the corresponding failed experience is assigned with a nonnegative reward and can contribute to learning the policy. To balance proximity and novelty, we employ a curriculum-learning method to regulate their trade-off dynamically.\nIn the earlier epochs, higher novelty can help the policy to explore unseen areas and generate more diverse trials.\nHowever, in the later epochs, such novelty will bring more noise (often as spurious trials) into training and distract the policy.\nAt the later stage of training, the policy has gained sufficient knowledge about the tasks and is able to generate high-reward, promising trials.\nTherefore, proximity becomes more critical since it will encourage the policy to proceed towards the correct trials and to focus on learning how to generate promising trials. Given a question q𝑞q, suppose the high-reward trials t1q,…,tmqsubscriptsuperscript𝑡𝑞1…subscriptsuperscript𝑡𝑞𝑚{t^{q}_{1},\\ldots,t^{q}_{m}} have already been stored in the memory buffer M𝑀M.\nFor one generated trial t𝑡t, we compute the reward bonus CRB as: where α∈ 𝛼01\\alpha\\in  is the weight of the reward bonus and dependent on the scale of the task rewards.\nThe term Fp​r​o​xsubscript𝐹𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑥F_{prox} reflects the proximity of the trial t𝑡t to the recorded trials in memory M𝑀M while Fn​o​v​e​lsubscript𝐹𝑛𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑙F_{novel} measures the novelty of t𝑡t.\nThe value of λ𝜆\\lambda controls their relative proportion, which is adjusted by the curriculum learning method. We compute the similarity between the generated trial t𝑡t with one trial tiqsubscriptsuperscript𝑡𝑞𝑖t^{q}_{i} in M𝑀M by edit distance, which is: Thus we define the proximity Fp​r​o​xsubscript𝐹𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑥F_{prox} as the highest similarity between the trial t𝑡t and all the trials t1q,…,tmqsubscriptsuperscript𝑡𝑞1…subscriptsuperscript𝑡𝑞𝑚{t^{q}_{1},\\ldots,t^{q}_{m}} in the memory buffer, which is: The term novelty Fn​o​v​e​lsubscript𝐹𝑛𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑙F_{novel} measures the diversity of the trial t𝑡t from the trials t1q,…,tmqsubscriptsuperscript𝑡𝑞1…subscriptsuperscript𝑡𝑞𝑚{t^{q}_{1},\\ldots,t^{q}_{m}}.\nWe assign a high novelty to a generated trial if it is different from the trials in M𝑀M, thus we define the novelty as: where β∈ 𝛽01\\beta\\in  is used to measure the diversity and is dependent on the scale of the similarity. We employ a curriculum learning scheme to adaptively change the weight λ𝜆\\lambda in Formula 19.\nWe start from learning to generate novel trials with large diversity, and gradually focus on re-sampling the trials which have high proximity to the desired successful trials stored in the memory buffer.\nThis method is achieved by progressively increasing the weight λ𝜆\\lambda, which is exponentially increased λ𝜆\\lambda with the training epochs: where η∈ 𝜂01\\eta\\in  is the learning pace which controls the curriculum learning, γ𝛾\\gamma represents the number of the epochs that have been trained, and λ0subscript𝜆0\\lambda_{0} is the initial weight of λ𝜆\\lambda. In our work, α𝛼\\alpha, β𝛽\\beta, η𝜂\\eta, and λ0subscript𝜆0\\lambda_{0} are hyper-parameters which are defined as 0.1, 1.0, 0.08, and 0.1, respectively in our work. At each time step, the output token generated by agent is decided by a certain policy (which is the generator in our work), and the probability that one token a𝑎a is chosen is computed as below, where θ𝜃\\theta denotes model parameters: Thus, the probability of an entire action sequence a0:Tsubscript𝑎:0𝑇a_{0:T} is given by: In 11, we define the cumulative reward R​(q,a0:T)𝑅𝑞subscript𝑎:0𝑇R(q,a_{0:T}).\nOur objective is to maximize the expected cumulative reward.\nTherefore we use the policy gradient method such as the REINFORCE algorithm to finetune the generator.\nThe objective and gradient are: B​(q)=R​(q,a^0:T)𝐵𝑞𝑅𝑞subscript^𝑎:0𝑇B(q)=R(q,\\hat{a}_{0:T}) is a baseline that reduces the variance of the gradient estimation without introducing bias.\nIn our work, the baseline is set as what is used in the self-critical sequence training (SCST) .\nAlso, Monte Carlo integration is employed to approximate the expectation over all possible trials in the policy gradient method [ref]41.\nThe training method is presented in Algorithm 1.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: ones.
