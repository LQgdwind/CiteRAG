      "content": "Paper Title: Graph-based Scalable Sampling of 3D Point Cloud Attributes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPoint clouds (PCs) have become a popular data format to represent 3D objects and scenes. A PC is comprised of a list of unordered points in ‚Ñù3superscript‚Ñù3\\mathbb{R}^{3}, ùí´={ùê©i=(xi,yi,zi)}ùí´subscriptùê©ùëñsubscriptùë•ùëñsubscriptùë¶ùëñsubscriptùëßùëñ{\\cal P}=\\{\\mathbf{p}_{i}=(x_{i},y_{i},z_{i})\\}, representing the geometry, and their corresponding attributes such as color, intensity, or surface normals. A typical PC may contain millions of points. As a result, subsequent downstream tasks, such as compression and real-time streaming in telepresence, become computationally costly   . To alleviate the computational load, we can employ PC sampling (selecting a subset of representative points), compress and stream a low-resolution PC, and reconstruct the original high-resolution PC. A similar technique is employed in image and video compression, i.e., chroma sub-sampling, where chrominance channels are sampled and encoded at a lower resolution . Existing PC sampling frameworks mainly focus on preserving geometry features (e.g., edges, corners) [ref]5 , which can be suboptimal when the goal is to accurately represent the attributes, as shown in our experiments (Section¬†V).\nThis work focuses on scenarios where only attributes are sampled, while geometry information is not sampled (i.e., all point coordinates are preserved). For example,\nin PC compression applications, geometry is available at both the encoder and the decoder and can be used to compress the color attributes. Thus, some color channels (chrominance) can be sampled at the encoder and reconstructed/interpolated to the original higher resolution at the decoder [ref]7.\nPC attribute sampling is also crucial in immersive communication requiring low latency  or rendering at varying resolutions  . Signal sampling and reconstruction are fundamental operations in signal processing. For 1D signals and images\nwe can employ regular sampling patterns (e.g., selecting even samples). In our preliminary work, we proposed an uniform sampling algorithm, which selects points in the PC belonging to a regular 3D grid [ref]7.\nWhile this approach is computationally inexpensive, its performance suffers due to several factors: 1) the sampling algorithm is unaware of the reconstruction algorithm, 2) sampling can only be performed at certain fixed rates, e.g., 50%percent5050\\%, 25%percent2525\\%, 12.5%percent12.512.5\\%, etc., 3) regular sampling is sub-optimal for PCs with irregular point distribution and non-uniform point densities (e.g., in LiDAR PCs  ). All these factors make 3D PC sampling challenging. In this paper, we formulate the problem of sampling set selection with two goals.\nFirst, the sampling set should be optimized for both the reconstruction algorithm and the sampling rate.\nSecond, the sampling algorithm should scale to PCs with millions of points, often encountered in practice 0 1. 3D PCs can be represented and processed using graphs, with nodes\ncorresponding to points, edge weights chosen based on the relative positions of the points, and PC attributes are treated as graph signals 2 3.\nThis has led to the development of graph signal processing (GSP) techniques for PC denoising 4, attribute compression 5 6 and sampling 7 8.\nHowever, even existing fast (eigendecomposition-free) graph signal sampling algorithms 9 0 1 2 3 4 can generally only be applied to small/medium graphs (1000-10,000 nodes) 0 and are optimized for bandlimited graph signal reconstruction. This work proposes a computationally efficient reconstruction-aware global sampling (RAGS) algorithm for PC attributes.\nOur RAGS algorithm is optimized for a popular and scalable graph Laplacian regularized (GLR) reconstruction method\n5 4 6.\nSimilar to 9 0, we choose samples such that certain interpolating vectors at the sampled locations are as close to orthogonal as possible. In 9 0, interpolators based on spectral filters are used, for which it is necessary to estimate the cut-off frequency.\nInstead, in our work, we construct polynomial interpolators directly in the vertex domain without requiring graph frequency analysis.\nUnlike prior work, our proposed interpolators adapt to the sampling rate by means of their polynomial degree, pùëùp.\nThis allows us to select highly localized (small pùëùp) or less localized (large pùëùp) interpolators depending on whether the sampling rate is high (e.g., over 25%) or low. We propose a method to choose the localization parameter pùëùp as a function of the sampling rate, which allows our RAGS algorithm to handle large PCs, even at higher sampling rates.\nOur proposed sampling algorithm has a complexity of ùí™‚Äã((d¬Ø3‚Äãp+s)‚ÄãN)ùí™superscript¬Øùëë3ùëùùë†ùëÅ{\\cal O}((\\bar{d}^{3p}+s)N), where d¬Ø‚àí1¬Øùëë1\\bar{d}-1 is the maximum unweighted graph degree, sùë†s is the number of samples and NùëÅN is the total number of points. Since PCs can be partitioned into non-overlapping blocks using the octree structure with ùí™‚Äã(N‚Äãlog‚Å°(N))ùí™ùëÅùëÅ\\mathcal{O}(N\\log(N)) complexity 7 8, we propose a reconstruction-aware block sampling (RABS) algorithm, which samples each block independently (see Figure¬†1).\nBecause independent block sampling ignores connections between points across block boundaries, we propose to add node weights (self-loops) to those points. We show that RABS on graphs with self-loops reduces the sampling complexity and the runtime by an order of magnitude compared to the RAGS with minimal loss in reconstruction quality. Our main contributions are: A global sampling set selection algorithm optimized for a graph Laplacian-based reconstruction(Section¬†III). Methods to select the interpolation localization parameter pùëùp as a function of the sampling rate (Section¬†III-D). A block-based graph sampling framework where self-loops are added to block-boundary nodes (Section¬†IV). A comprehensive evaluation of our algorithms on two large PC datasets and their application to PC attribute compression through chroma subsampling (Section¬†V).\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: chroma sub-sampling, where chrominance channels are sampled and encoded at a lower resolution .
