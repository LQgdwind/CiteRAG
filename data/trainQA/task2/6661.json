      "content": "Paper Title: UniFormaly: Towards Task-Agnostic Unified Framework for Visual Anomaly Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDefect detection. In Table 1, we present a comprehensive evaluation result for anomaly detection and localization across various approaches, including unsupervised  , self-supervised  , and pre-trained  [ref]27 on the MVTecAD. The results demonstrate that UniFormaly outperforms or shows competitive results compared to its baselines. Additionally, our method shows significantly less standard deviation across classes than most of the baselines, indicating our applicability to various sub-datasets with distinct categories. Furthermore, Table 2 presents the results on other benchmarks (MTD, BTAD, CPD), demonstrating that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in all datasets. This confirms that, compared to pre-trained encoder-based methods, the methods with proxy tasks exhibit larger performance fluctuations with changes in datasets. In contrast, UniFormaly consistently presents outstanding performance without fine-tuning, demonstrating its robustness in various applications. Semantic anomaly detection. In Table 3, we observe that our method consistently outperforms baselines. Particularly in high-resolution datasets such as ImageNet-30 and Species-60, our method exhibits a significant performance margin compared to the alternatives. In low-resolution datasets, such as CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, our method shows less improvement in AUROC compared to the other datasets since ViTs are pre-trained on the resolution of 224 (which is much higher than that of CIFAR-10/100). While a resolution discrepancy exists between the test images and the pretraining datasets, UniFormaly-DINO shows competitive results, and UniFormaly-iBOT even outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) without requiring any adaptation to the test images. We acknowledge potential fairness concerns when comparing with ImageNet-30 since UniFormaly is built on an ImageNet-pre-trained encoder with self-supervision. To address this, we conduct experiments on Species-60, a dataset without semantic overlap with ImageNet. As shown in Table 3, for ImageNet-30 and Species-60, our method outperforms its competitors by a large gap. This confirms the effectiveness of our approach in detecting semantic anomalies and slight anomalies, such as defects, regardless of the aforementioned overlap issue. Meanwhile, both  and , which are self-supervised approaches trained from scratch on the given dataset, exhibit a more significant difference in AUROC compared to ours. This result suggests that the training setups of baselines are tailored to the ImageNet-30 and suboptimal for Species-60. Moreover, PatchCore, another pre-trained encoder-based method, performs poorly on semantic anomaly detection due to an architectural design tailored to defect detection. Multi-class anomaly detection. Our method is easily scalable to multi-class anomaly detection by incorporating representations of multi-class data in a normal memory bank. We present multi-class defect detection results on MVTecAD in Table 4, as well as semantic detection results on CIFAR-10 and Species-60 in Table 5 and 6, respectively. In Table 4, we observe that in multi-class defect detection, our approach shows almost no performance drop in AUROC. The method proposed for the multi-class detection task [ref]39 also exhibits a minimal performance drop compared to the other methods, except for ours. UniAD [ref]39 consistently lags behind our performance in defect detection overall and shows poor performance on Species-60, failing to converge. These observations suggest that the learning-based multi-class detection framework [ref]39 may not be successfully applicable to semantic anomaly detection with more complicated and high-resolution images, indicating a lack of generality. Similar convergence issues are observed in . On the contrary, pre-trained encoder-based methods, including PatchCore[ref]27 and ours, alleviate these issues, as shown in Table 6. In addition, UniFormaly-DINO achieves a new state-of-the-art performance in both one-class and multi-class settings for defect detection (Table 4). Our method also demonstrates the same result for anomaly localization, achieving state-of-the-art results with only a minimal performance drop of 0.1 with UniFormaly-DINO. In multiclass semantic anomaly detection, our method achieves the highest score on Species-60 (Table 6), while still delivering competitive results on CIFAR-10 (Table 5). Although the previous pre-trained encoder-based method[ref]27 shows relatively high scores compared to the other online learning methods, it still falls behind us by 7 in AUROC. Anomaly clustering. UniFormaly effectively clusters anomalies into categories using the top k𝑘k% of patch embeddings based on reordered features, capturing more than just binary information of normality. We easily apply our averaged features to K-means clustering. We compare our method with [ref]28, which is the only method that has studied anomaly clustering task, as well as the deep clustering methods, IIC , GATCluster , and SCAN  as baselines. Although our approach is not primarily designed for clustering, it outperforms baselines, including [ref]28 (Table 7). In terms of F1 scores, we improve the strongest baseline by 10.48% and achieve the highest F1 score. In particular, with K-means clustering, we outperform the state-of-the-art method [ref]28.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: detection.
