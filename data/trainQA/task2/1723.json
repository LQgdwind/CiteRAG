      "content": "Paper Title: Pairwise Symmetry Reasoning for Multi-Agent Path Finding Search\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMAPF can be reduced to other well-studied NP-hard problems, relying on off-the-shelf solvers to find optimal solutions. MAPF can be encoded as an integer multi-commodity flow problem  and thus solved by an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solver. It is shown that such methods are competitive or sometimes even outperform search-based algorithms on small maps. However, they do not scale well on large maps because the ILP encoding requires a Boolean variable for each agent being at each vertex at each timestep.\nBCP  [ref]14 is a more efficient ILP-based algorithm based on branch and price and one of the current leading algorithms. Similar to CBS, BCP is a two-level algorithm whose low level solves a series of single-agent pathfinding problems and whose high level uses ILP to assign paths to agents and resolve conflicts.\nIt is shown that BCP can be substantially sped up by\nmaking use of symmetry-breaking cuts\n(similar to our reasoning techniques) in their fractional solutions. The rectangle and target reasoning techniques used in BCP are based on our earlier work  [ref]21, while BCP was the\nfirst approach to notice pseudo-corridor symmetries (introduced in Section 9.1). BCP also introduces many other symmetries, but they are caused by the fractional solutions and do not occur in CBS. MAPF can also be encoded as a Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) . Like the basic ILP encoding, the basic SAT encoding requires a Boolean variable for each agent being at each vertex at each timestep, and thus its efficiency drops as the size of the problem grows.\nSMT-CBS  is a more efficient SAT-based algorithm based on satisfiability modulo theories. Like CBS, it ignores all conflicts in the beginning and adds conflict-resolving constraints only when necessary. SMT-CBS outperforms the basic SAT-based algorithms, and there is already evidence that its efficiency can be further improved by adding the symmetry reasoning techniques . Like the basic ILP and SAT encodings, MAPF can also be directly encoded as a constraint satisfaction problem and solved by an off-the-shelf Constraint-Programming (CP) solver. But, again, there is a more efficient CP-based algorithm, called lazy-CBS , that deploys the CBS framework. It uses the same constraint tree as CBS but traverses it using lazy clause generation instead of A*. Lazy-CBS is also one of the leading algorithms, and there is already evidence that its efficiency can be further improved by adding the symmetry reasoning techniques [ref]14.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: search-based algorithms on small maps.
