They both use semantic features in networks.  [ref]4 tried to make composite image harmonious via domain transfer.\n [ref]7  both used attention mechanism in networks.\n  propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture for automatic image compositing, which considers geometric, color, and boundary consistency at the same time.\n 1 seek to solve image harmonization via separable harmonization of reflectance and illumination, where reflectance is harmonized through material-consistency penalty and illumination is harmonized by learning and transferring light from background to foreground.\nNote that recently some image harmonization works start to focus on high-resolution images.\n 8 use self-supervised learning strategy to train network with small local patches of high resolution images, but during inference it still follow the two stage post-processing strategy.\n 5  learn global parameters to adjust image attributes such as lightness and saturation.\n 0 learns pixel-wise curves to perform low-light image enhancement. Smart upsampling. Processing high resolution image becomes difficult due to huge computational burden of deep-learning networks and limited GPU memory.\nA common approach to accelerate high resolution processing is to first downsample the image, apply time-consuming operator at low resolution and upsample back. To preserve edge gradients, guided filter upsampling 4 uses original high resolution input as guidance map.\n  fit transformation recipe from compressed input and output, then apply the recipe to high quality input. Bilateral guided upsampling  approximates the operator with grids of local affine transformations and apply them on high resolution input, thus control the operator complexity.\n  predict the local affine model with fully convolution networks, which is trained by end-to-end learning and obtain multi-scale semantic information.\n  propose a guided filter layer, using point-wise convolution to approximate median filter, thus can be plugged into networks and optimized jointly.\n 9 introduce extra networks to learn deformable offsets for each pixel, thus the interpolation neighbour is predicted online during upsampling.\n   learn 3D lookup tables (LUT) to obtain high resolution results, but the learned transformation still lacks interpretable meanings.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: Image harmonization.\nIn this subsection, we focus on the discussion of deep learning based methods.\nThese methods regard color harmonization as a black box image-to-image translation task. [ref]32 apply the well-known encoder-decoder U-net structure with skip-connection and train the network with multi-task learning, simultaneously predicting pixel value and semantic segmentation.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
