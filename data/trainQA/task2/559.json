      "content": "Paper Title: LSBert: A Simple Framework for Lexical Simplification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTextual simplification (TS) is the process of simplifying the content of the original text as much as possible, while retaining the meaning and grammaticality so that it can be more easily read and understood by a wider audience. Textual simplification focuses on simplifying the vocabulary and syntax of the text. Early systems of TS often used standard statistical machine translation approaches to learn the simplification of a complex sentence into a simplified sentence . Recently, TS methods adopted encoder-decoder model to simplify the text based on parallel corpora  4 . All of the above work belong to the supervised TS systems, whose performance strongly relies on the availability of large amounts of parallel sentences. Two public parallel benchmarks WikiSmall 6 and WikiLarge   contain a large proportion of: inaccurate simplifications (not aligned or only partially aligned) ; inadequate simplifications (not much simpler)   . These problems is mainly because designing a good alignment algorithm for extracting parallel sentences from EW and SEW is very difficult . Therefore, a number of approaches focusing on the generation and assessment of lexical simplification were proposed. Lexical simplification (LS) only focuses to simplify complex words of one sentence. LS needs to identify complex words and find the best candidate substitution for these complex words  . The best substitution needs to be more simplistic while preserving the sentence grammatically and keeping its meaning as much as possible, which is a very challenging task. The popular lexical simplification approaches were rule-based, in which each rule contains a complex word and its simple synonyms [ref]23  . Rule-based systems usually identified synonyms from WordNet or other linguistic databases for a predefined set of complex words and selected the ”simplest” from these synonyms based on the frequency of word or length of word  . However, there is a major limitation for the rule-based systems that it is impossible to give all possible simplification rules for each word. As complex and simplified parallel corpora are available, LS systems tried to extract rules from parallel corpora   . Yatskar et al. (2010) identified lexical simplifications from the edit history of simple English Wikipedia (SEW). They utilized a probabilistic method to recognize simplification edits distinguishing from other types of content changes. Biran et al. (2011) considered every pair of distinct word in the English Wikipedia (EW) and SEW to be a possible simplification pair, and filtered part of them based on morphological variants and WordNet. Horn et al. (2014) also generated the candidate rules from the EW and SEW, and adopted a context-aware binary classifier to decide whether a candidate rule should be adopted or not in a certain context. The main limitation of the type of methods relies heavily on parallel corpora. To entirely avoid the requirement of lexical resources or parallel corpora, LS systems based on word embeddings were proposed . They extracted the top 10 words as candidate substitutions whose vectors are closer in terms of cosine similarity with the complex word. Instead of a traditional word embedding model, Paetzold and Specia (2016) adopted context-aware word embeddings trained on a large dataset where each word is annotated with the POS tag. Afterward, they further extracted candidates for the complex word by combining word embeddings with WordNet and parallel corpora . REC-LS  attempted to generate substitutes from multiple sources, e.g, WordNet, Big Huge Thesaurus 111https://words.bighugelabs.com and word embeddings. After examining existing LS methods ranging from rules-based to embedding-based, the major challenge is that they generated simplification candidates for the complex word regardless of the context of the complex word, which will inevitably produce a large number of spurious candidates that confuse the systems employed in the subsequent steps. In this paper, we will first present a LS approach LSBert that requires only a sufficiently large corpus of raw text without any manual efforts. Pre-training language models 1   have attracted wide attention and has shown to be effective for improving many downstream natural language processing tasks. Our method exploits recent advances in Bert to generate suitable simplifications for complex words. Our method generates the candidates of the complex word by considering the whole sentence that is easier to hold cohesion and coherence of a sentence. In this case, many steps used in existing LS methods have been eliminated from our method, e.g., morphological transformation. The previous version LSBert was published in artificial intelligence conference (AAAI) , which only focused on substitute generations given the sentence and its complex word using Bert. In this paper, we propose an LS framework including complex word identification, substitute generations, substitute ranking. The framework can simplify one sentence recursively. One recent work for LS based Bert  was almost simultaneously proposed with our previous version, which also only focused on substitute generations.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: its meaning as much as possible, which is a very challenging task.
