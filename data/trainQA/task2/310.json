      "content": "Paper Title: Explainable Image Classification with Evidence Counterfactual\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMany authors in the field of philosophy and cognitive science have raised the importance of contrastive explanations .\nAs argued by Lipton , it is easier for humans to think in terms of contrastive explanations instead of giving a full causal attribution to an event.\nThis means that in case we want to know why a certain event took place, we actually wonder why that event occurred rather than another.\nThat other event is often referred to as the counterfactual case  . The notion of counterfactual explanations is considered promising to explain decisions of complex machine learning models  .\nSuch an explanation can be defined as a set of features that would alter the classification, if they were not present.\nMartens and Provost  were the first to apply this idea for predictive modeling, in the context of document classification.\nSimilar approaches were taken for classification based on fine-grained behavioral data [ref]33  and structured data .\nApart from the contrastiveness, counterfactual explanations have other benefits.\nIt is argued that they are more likely to comply with recent regulatory developments such as GDPR.\nWachter et al.  state that counterfactual explanations are well-suited to fill three important needs of data subjects: information on how a decision was reached, grounds to contest adverse decisions and an idea of what could be changed to receive a desired outcome.\nMoreover, formulating an explanation as a set of features does not put constraints on model type and complexity , which should make it robust for developments in modeling techniques.\nFinally, the explanation can be done without disclosing the entire model , which allows companies to give only the necessary information without revealing trade secrets. Several authors have used approaches that are closely related to counterfactual reasoning for image classification.\nAdversarial example methods aim at finding very small image perturbations that lead to false classifications [ref]35  .\nThis has proven useful to protect a classifier against attempts to deceive it.\nHowever, since the found perturbations are often too small to be visible for humans (in extreme cases only one pixel), they cannot be used as an interpretable counterfactual explanation. Dhurandhar et al. [ref]38 introduce a method for creating contrastive image classification explanations consisting of two parts: the pixels that should be minimally present for the original classification and the pixels that should be minimally absent for another classification.\nAlso in this case, the found explanations can be very small and/or hard to interpret.\nMoreover, to verify whether pixels should be absent, it is necessary to add them in some way.\nDhurandhar et al. [ref]38 do this for the well-known MNIST dataset of hand-written digits.\nSince this dataset contains grayscale images, adding pixels is rather straightforward (i.e., adding white on a black background).\nHowever, for colored images the idea of adding pixels is less obvious and not applied in practice. To overcome the difficulties concerning image perturbation and small visual explanations, the use of natural language was proposed by Hendricks et al.  to generate textual counterfactual explanations.\nThis method results in a textual description of evidence that, in case of presence, would change the image classification.\nHowever, this relies on human description of the relevant concepts present in an image, which is considered difficult to obtain and objectify.\nGoyal et al.  generate visual counterfactual explanations for a chosen counterfactual class by replacing parts of an image by parts of an image belonging to the counterfactual class.\nHence, this requires access to image data of that counterfactual class, which is not considered feasible in all contexts. Other authors specifically aim at identifying the parts of an image that should be minimally present for its classification.\nZhou et al.  iteratively gray out the least informative segments of a correctly classified image until it is misclassified.\nRibeiro et al.  proposed an algorithm to localize the segments of an image that are sufficient for its classification, irrespective of perturbations of the remaining segments.\nHence, this algorithm searches for evidence that rules out any counterfactual class.\nAlthough both approaches use counterfactual reasoning to some extent, their goal is not to find a counterfactual explanation. It can be concluded that current counterfactual methods have issues to generate interpretable instance-level explanations for image classification.\nTherefore, we propose a novel method that results in enhanced explanations, only based on the image of interest and without the need of human intervention.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: Provost  were the first to apply this idea for predictive modeling, in the context of document classification.\nSimilar approaches were taken for classification based on fine-grained behavioral data [ref]33  and structured data .\nApart from the contrastiveness, counterfactual explanations have other benefits.\nIt is argued that they are more likely to comply with recent regulatory developments\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
