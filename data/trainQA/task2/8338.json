      "content": "Paper Title: Monotone Contractions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe show that a three-dimensional 𝖣𝖬𝖠𝖢𝖣𝖬𝖠𝖢\\mathsf{DMAC} instance f𝑓f can be solved in O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n)\nqueries, where each step runs in time that is polynomial in the representation\nof f𝑓f. As a warm-up, we will describe our ideas in a two-dimensional instance. We\nstart by describing an algorithm that makes O​(log2⁡n)𝑂superscript2𝑛O(\\log^{2}n) queries, which follows the\napproach of . We define the up-set to be Up⁡(f)={x:x≤f​(x)}Up𝑓conditional-set𝑥𝑥𝑓𝑥\\operatorname{Up}(f)=\\{x\\;:\\;x\\leq f(x)\\}, which is\nthe set of points at which f𝑓f moves weakly upward, and the down-set to\nbe Down⁡(f)={x:x≥f​(x)}Down𝑓conditional-set𝑥𝑥𝑓𝑥\\operatorname{Down}(f)=\\{x\\;:\\;x\\geq f(x)\\}, which is the set of points at which f𝑓f moves weakly\ndownward. The idea is to carry out an outer binary search on the first coordinate.\nFor a fixed slice si={x:x1=i}subscript𝑠𝑖conditional-set𝑥subscript𝑥1𝑖s_{i}=\\{x\\;:\\;x_{1}=i\\}, the algorithm uses an\ninner binary search to find some point in Up⁡(f)∩siUp𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖\\operatorname{Up}(f)\\cap s_{i} or Down⁡(f)∩siDown𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖\\operatorname{Down}(f)\\cap s_{i}. If we find a point x∈Up⁡(f)∩s𝑥Up𝑓𝑠x\\in\\operatorname{Up}(f)\\cap s then we can eliminate all\npoints y𝑦y with y1<x1subscript𝑦1subscript𝑥1y_{1}<x_{1}, while if we find a\npoint x∈Down⁡(f)∩s𝑥Down𝑓𝑠x\\in\\operatorname{Down}(f)\\cap s then\nwe can eliminate all points y𝑦y with y1>x1subscript𝑦1subscript𝑥1y_{1}>x_{1}. The justification for this\ncan be found in . We will not dwell on this point here, because it\nturns out we will actually need to use a different justification for our\nalgorithm. Since the algorithm uses two levels of binary search, it makes\nO​(log2⁡n)𝑂superscript2𝑛O(\\log^{2}n) queries overall. Our key idea is that we can use the fact that our surfaces are monotone with\ngradient at most one to speed up this algorithm. Consider the instance shown in\nFigure 3 (a). Recall that each surface represents the\none-dimensional fixed point of each one-dimensional slice. Moreover, since the\ninstance is contracting, we must have that all points beneath the surface move\nupward under f𝑓f, while all points above the surface move downward under f𝑓f,\nbecause otherwise we would have a strict violation of contraction. Our inner binary searches are searching\nfor a point in Up⁡(f)Up𝑓\\operatorname{Up}(f) or Down⁡(f)Down𝑓\\operatorname{Down}(f), which therefore correspond to the points\nthat lie between the red and blue lines. Specifically, whenever the red line is\nabove the blue line, the region in between is Up⁡(f)Up𝑓\\operatorname{Up}(f), while whenever the blue\nline lies above the red line, the region in between is Down⁡(f)Down𝑓\\operatorname{Down}(f). Suppose, as shown in\nFigure 3 (a), that we were carrying out a binary search on\nslice sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i}. In the last iteration of this search, we had eliminated all but\nthe region [ai,bi]subscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑏𝑖[a_{i},b_{i}], and we found point p∈Up⁡(f)𝑝Up𝑓p\\in\\operatorname{Up}(f). Suppose further\nthat the outer binary search moves to the slice j>i𝑗𝑖j>i. If aj=ai+(j−i)subscript𝑎𝑗subscript𝑎𝑖𝑗𝑖a_{j}=a_{i}+(j-i) and bj=bi+(j−1)subscript𝑏𝑗subscript𝑏𝑖𝑗1b_{j}=b_{i}+(j-1), then we prove that\nUp⁡(f)∩sjUp𝑓subscript𝑠𝑗\\operatorname{Up}(f)\\cap s_{j} must lie in the range [aj,bj]subscript𝑎𝑗subscript𝑏𝑗[a_{j},b_{j}], as shown in Figure 3 (a). This is due to the properties we have for surfaces. Since the blue line\ncan move rightward with gradient at most one, it can get no closer to the line\nbetween aisubscript𝑎𝑖a_{i} and ajsubscript𝑎𝑗a_{j} as we move rightward. Likewise, since the red line can\nmove upward with gradient at most one, it can get no closer to the line between\nbisubscript𝑏𝑖b_{i} and bjsubscript𝑏𝑗b_{j}. The only way for the red or blue lines to leave this region is\nfor them to cross and exit the other side, but if the lines have crossed to the\nleft of a slice j𝑗j, then we have\nthat Up⁡(f)∩sjUp𝑓subscript𝑠𝑗\\operatorname{Up}(f)\\cap s_{j} is empty so our claim that\nUp⁡(f)∩sjUp𝑓subscript𝑠𝑗\\operatorname{Up}(f)\\cap s_{j} is contained in the region [aj,bj]subscript𝑎𝑗subscript𝑏𝑗[a_{j},b_{j}] holds trivially. The key point here is that we can now initialize the binary search in slice j𝑗j\nwith the bounds [aj,bj]subscript𝑎𝑗subscript𝑏𝑗[a_{j},b_{j}], and thereby\ncarry over progress from one inner binary\nsearch to the next. So rather than doing log⁡n𝑛\\log n separate binary searches, we\ndo a single binary search that occasionally transfers itself to a new slice.\nSo our query complexity is reduced from O​(log2⁡n)𝑂superscript2𝑛O(\\log^{2}n) to O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n). We should remark that the algorithm needs to be slightly changed to accommodate\nthis. The original algorithm used a single inner binary search that looked for\na point either in Up⁡(f)Up𝑓\\operatorname{Up}(f) or Down⁡(f)Down𝑓\\operatorname{Down}(f). Here we run two independent binary\nsearches: one binary search looks for a point in\nUp⁡(f)Up𝑓\\operatorname{Up}(f) and maintains a bound on Up⁡(f)Up𝑓\\operatorname{Up}(f), and the other looks for a point\nin Down⁡(f)Down𝑓\\operatorname{Down}(f) and maintains a bound on Down⁡(f)Down𝑓\\operatorname{Down}(f). Indeed, everything we have\ndescribed holds symmetrically when we are seeking a point in Down⁡(f)Down𝑓\\operatorname{Down}(f).\nSpecifically, if we have a bound [ai,bi]subscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑏𝑖[a_{i},b_{i}] on Down⁡(f)∩siDown𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖\\operatorname{Down}(f)\\cap s_{i}, then when\nwe move to a slice j<i𝑗𝑖j<i we can set aj=ai−(i−j)subscript𝑎𝑗subscript𝑎𝑖𝑖𝑗a_{j}=a_{i}-(i-j) and bj=bi−(i−j)subscript𝑏𝑗subscript𝑏𝑖𝑖𝑗b_{j}=b_{i}-(i-j) to translate the bound diagonally downward to the slice j𝑗j. At a high level, our algorithm is as follows. We first extend the instance vertically\nas shown in Figure 3 (b), to ensure that the blue line touches\nboth the left and right boundaries of the instance. This enables us to ensure that\nour initial bounds entirely contain the up- and down-sets, while at most\ntripling the height of the instance. Initialize l=1𝑙1l=1 and u=n𝑢𝑛u=n to be the lower and upper bounds on the\nouter binary search, respectively. Let a𝑎a and b𝑏b be the minimum and maximum\ny𝑦y-values of our extended instance.\nInitialize b1up=(a,b)subscriptsuperscript𝑏up1𝑎𝑏b^{\\text{up}}_{1}=(a,b) and\nbndn=(a,b)subscriptsuperscript𝑏dn𝑛𝑎𝑏b^{\\text{dn}}_{n}=(a,b) to be the trivial bounds on the up and down sets in slices 111\nand n𝑛n respectively. Choose a new slice i=⌊u−l2⌋𝑖𝑢𝑙2i=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{u-l}{2}\\right\\rfloor. Set biup=blup+(i−l)⋅(1,1)subscriptsuperscript𝑏up𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝑏up𝑙⋅𝑖𝑙11b^{\\text{up}}_{i}=b^{\\text{up}}_{l}+(i-l)\\cdot(1,1), and set\nbidn=budn+(u−i)⋅(−1,−1)subscriptsuperscript𝑏dn𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝑏dn𝑢⋅𝑢𝑖11b^{\\text{dn}}_{i}=b^{\\text{dn}}_{u}+(u-i)\\cdot(-1,-1), where here we are\napplying our technique for translating bounds from one slice to the next. Carry out two inner binary searches in parallel: one looking for a point in\nUp⁡(f)Up𝑓\\operatorname{Up}(f) in slice i𝑖i\ninitialized with the bounds biupsubscriptsuperscript𝑏up𝑖b^{\\text{up}}_{i}, and a second looking for\nDown⁡(f)Down𝑓\\operatorname{Down}(f) in slice i𝑖i\ninitialized with the bounds bidnsubscriptsuperscript𝑏dn𝑖b^{\\text{dn}}_{i}. If the up-set binary search succeeds, then we set l=i𝑙𝑖l=i and\nbiupsubscriptsuperscript𝑏up𝑖b^{\\text{up}}_{i} to be the last bounds considered by the binary search, and\nwe move back to Step 3. If the down-set inner algorithm succeeds, then we set u=i𝑢𝑖u=i and\nbidnsubscriptsuperscript𝑏dn𝑖b^{\\text{dn}}_{i} to be the last bounds considered by the binary search, and\nwe move back to Step 3. In particular, it is important that we run the two algorithms in\nStep 4 in lockstep, since we only consider the results of one of\nthem, and throw the progress made by the other one away. So while we\npotentially waste the progress made by one binary search, this does not matter,\nbecause the other inner algorithm makes progress that we keep for the rest of the\nalgorithm. So the overall number of steps made by the algorithm is still O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n). There are obviously many things that we need to prove to show that this\napproach is correct. Firstly we show that for every slice sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i} we have Up⁡(f)∩si≠∅Up𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖\\operatorname{Up}(f)\\cap s_{i}\\neq\\emptyset or Down⁡(f)∩si≠∅Down𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖\\operatorname{Down}(f)\\cap s_{i}\\neq\\emptyset, so one of the two\nbinary searches always succeeds.\nSecondly we need to show that once the outer\nbinary search has converged, meaning we have found a slice sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i} with Up⁡(f)∩si≠∅Up𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖\\operatorname{Up}(f)\\cap s_{i}\\neq\\emptyset and Down⁡(f)∩si≠∅Down𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖\\operatorname{Down}(f)\\cap s_{i}\\neq\\emptyset then we can find\na fixed point. For the two-dimensional case we can simply use one further\nbinary search in the slice j𝑗j to find a fixed point. For our three-dimensional\nalgorithm we need an entirely separate terminal algorithm to do this job. We use the same setup\nin\nour three-dimensional algorithm. We carry out an outer binary search on\ndimension 3, and so each slice sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i} that the algorithm visits is now a\ntwo-dimensional slice, rather than a one-dimensional slice. For this to work, we need to be able to maintain succinct bounds on Up⁡(f)∩siUp𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖\\operatorname{Up}(f)\\cap s_{i} and Down⁡(f)∩siDown𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖\\operatorname{Down}(f)\\cap s_{i}, and unfortunately the simple binary search\nbounds we used in the two-dimensional case are no longer sufficient. Here we\ndescribe how a succinct bound on Up⁡(f)∩siUp𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖\\operatorname{Up}(f)\\cap s_{i} can be formulated for a\ntwo-dimensional slice sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i}. Our bound on Down⁡(f)∩siDown𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖\\operatorname{Down}(f)\\cap s_{i} can be obtained\nby flipping both dimensions and applying the same ideas. The structure of the up-set in a two-dimensional slice can be seen in\nFigure 4 (a). As before we have red and blue boundaries for\ndimensions 1 and 2. We also have the green line that represents the boundary\nbetween the points x𝑥x with x3>f3​(x)subscript𝑥3subscript𝑓3𝑥x_{3}>f_{3}(x), which lie below the green line, and\nthe points y𝑦y with y3≤f3​(y)subscript𝑦3subscript𝑓3𝑦y_{3}\\leq f_{3}(y), which lie above it. Note that\nmonotonicity implies that if x𝑥x satisfies x3>f3​(x)subscript𝑥3subscript𝑓3𝑥x_{3}>f_{3}(x), then all points p𝑝p with\np≤x𝑝𝑥p\\leq x and p3=x3subscript𝑝3subscript𝑥3p_{3}=x_{3} also satisfy p3>f3​(p)subscript𝑝3subscript𝑓3𝑝p_{3}>f_{3}(p). So we can always draw\nthe green boundary as a line that starts on the left or top boundaries of the\ninstance, and then moves weakly monotonically down, and weakly monotonically\nleft until it reaches the right or bottom boundaries. The region that we are interested in is labelled U𝑈U in the diagram. This is\nthe region that lies below the red line, to the left of the blue line, and\nabove the green line, which is precisely the set of points that move weakly\nupward in all three dimensions, and therefore U=Up⁡(f)∩si𝑈Up𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖U=\\operatorname{Up}(f)\\cap s_{i}. As can be seen, this region is not necessarily\nsimple to describe, since there is no bound on the number of turns that any of\nthe boundaries of U𝑈U make.\nNevertheless, we show that we can always find a\nrelatively succinct upper bound on U𝑈U. We say that a box-shaped region is a critical box (defined formally\nin Definition 74) if it satisfies the following conditions. It only contains points in the up-set. It touches all three boundaries of the up-set in the sense that The point directly to the right of the bottom-right corner of the box\nmoves strictly down in dimension 1. The point directly above the top-left corner of the box moves strictly down in\ndimension 2. The point diagonally below the bottom-left corner of the box moves\nstrictly down in dimension 3. The region C𝐶C is a critical box in Figure 4 (b).\nFor each critical box we define\nthree lobes: a left lobe that contains all points to the left of the\nbox, a bottom lobe that contains all points beneath the box, and a diagonal\nlobe that contains all points diagonally above the box. These are shown as L𝐿L,\nB𝐵B, and D𝐷D, respectively in the figure. The key point is that, given any critical box, we have that Up⁡(f)∩siUp𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖\\operatorname{Up}(f)\\cap s_{i} is contained in the union of the box and its three lobes. Hence we\ncan bound the up-set using at most three box-shaped regions and one diagonal\nregion. Our algorithm will use bounds of this format. Another crucial point that we will prove is that\nif Up⁡(f)∩siUp𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖\\operatorname{Up}(f)\\cap s_{i} is non-empty, then an almost square critical box\nalways exists. Specifically, this means that if the box has height hℎh and\nwidth w𝑤w, then |h−w|≤1ℎ𝑤1|h-w|\\leq 1. The proof of this fact is actually quite\ninvolved, and will be covered in Section 8.3. So our bound on Up⁡(f)∩siUp𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖\\operatorname{Up}(f)\\cap s_{i} will take the form of a critical box and its\nthree lobes. In the two-dimensional algorithm we had a bound [a,b]𝑎𝑏[a,b] on\nUp⁡(f)∩siUp𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖\\operatorname{Up}(f)\\cap s_{i}, and we used binary search to reduce the size of this bound\nby one-half in each step. Analogously, in the three-dimensional algorithm, we have a\ncritical box and its lobes, and we must make constantly many queries to f𝑓f and\nthen reduce the area covered by the bound by a constant fraction. This turns\nout to be quite a complex task, with several different cases that must be\nconsidered. We start by considering the case where\nwe have a square-shaped region that we know contains\nUp⁡(f)∩siUp𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖\\operatorname{Up}(f)\\cap s_{i}, which would have, for example, at the start of the algorithm,\nwhere we can use the entire slice as a trivial bound on the up-set. We want to refine\nthis square-shaped region to reduce the area of our bound\nUp⁡(f)∩siUp𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖\\operatorname{Up}(f)\\cap s_{i} by a constant fraction. We use a grid-search to achieve this. That is, we overlay a k×k𝑘𝑘k\\times k grid\nwith constantly many points over the square, and we query each point. This\nclearly uses constantly many queries. If we find a point in Up⁡(f)Up𝑓\\operatorname{Up}(f) in our\ngrid then we are done, and we can move to a new slice in the outer algorithm. On the other hand, we know that if Up⁡(f)∩siUp𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖\\operatorname{Up}(f)\\cap s_{i} is non-empty, then an\nalmost square critical box exists. If our grid search failed to find a point in\nUp⁡(f)Up𝑓\\operatorname{Up}(f), then we know that all almost square critical boxes have height and\nwidth less than or equal to k𝑘k, because every point in a critical box lies in\nUp⁡(f)Up𝑓\\operatorname{Up}(f) and we did not find a point in Up⁡(f)Up𝑓\\operatorname{Up}(f) in our grid. This means that the up-set must be contained in a\nmuch smaller region. We proceed by searching for a CB-config (defined formally in\nDefinition 94) in our grid, which is\na 2×2222\\times 2 grid square satisfying the\nfollowing properties. The lower-left corner of the square moves strictly downward in dimension\n3, while the upper-right corner moves weakly upward. Either the top or bottom edge of the square has points that move toward\neach other in dimension 1, with the left point moving weakly right and the\nright point moving strictly left. Either the left or right edge of the square has points that move toward\neach other in dimension 2, with the lower point moving weakly upward and the\nupper point moving strictly downward. Figure 5 (a) shows an example of a CB-config. We prove that if an almost-square critical box exists, then the grid will\ncontain a CB-config. So if we fail to find a CB-config we can declare that\nUp⁡(f)∩siUp𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖\\operatorname{Up}(f)\\cap s_{i} is empty.\nIn this case we will prove that if Up⁡(f)∩siUp𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖\\operatorname{Up}(f)\\cap s_{i} is empty, then Down⁡(f)∩siDown𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖\\operatorname{Down}(f)\\cap s_{i} is non-empty, so\nthe outer algorithm can proceed as if the down-set\ninner algorithm found a point in\nDown⁡(f)∩siDown𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖\\operatorname{Down}(f)\\cap s_{i}. If we do find a CB-config, then we prove that all almost square critical boxes\nmust lie in a 7​k×7​k7𝑘7𝑘7k\\times 7k square region S𝑆S surrounding the CB-config (which\nis specified formally in Lemma 96). Hence, if we take the\nunion of the left,\nbottom, and diagonal lobes of S𝑆S, then this union is guaranteed to contain all almost\nsquare critical\nboxes and all of their lobes, which themselves contain Up⁡(f)Up𝑓\\operatorname{Up}(f). So this region is a\nnew bound on Up⁡(f)∩siUp𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖\\operatorname{Up}(f)\\cap s_{i}. As shown in Figure 5 (b), so long\nas k𝑘k was chosen to be large enough, this\nrules out a significant fraction of the area of the original square. We can now proceed by performing a more refined grid search on the square S𝑆S.\nSince S𝑆S contains all of the almost square critical boxes, and since an almost\nsquare critical box always exists so long as Up⁡(f)∩siUp𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖\\operatorname{Up}(f)\\cap s_{i} is non-empty,\nthere is guaranteed to be a point in S𝑆S that lies in Up⁡(f)Up𝑓\\operatorname{Up}(f) whenever Up⁡(f)∩siUp𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖\\operatorname{Up}(f)\\cap s_{i} is non-empty. So it is valid for us to proceed in this way. The procedure continues until we find a point444\nOr until we discover that\nUp⁡(f)∩siUp𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖\\operatorname{Up}(f)\\cap s_{i} is empty, or\nuntil the down-set inner\nalgorithm, which is running parallel, finds a down-set point. In both of these\ncases we would throw\naway any progress we made here. We proceed in this section assuming that we do\nneed to carry over the progress of the up-set inner algorithm.\nin\nUp⁡(f)∩siUp𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖\\operatorname{Up}(f)\\cap s_{i}, at which point we jump to a new slice. When we jump to a new slice j>i𝑗𝑖j>i, we transpose our existing bound on Up⁡(f)∩siUp𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖\\operatorname{Up}(f)\\cap s_{i} to the new slice. Our bound so far has been defined by a central box\nand its three lobes, and to transpose this bound to a new slice we\nsimply translate all of the regions by (j−i)⋅(1,1,1)⋅𝑗𝑖111(j-i)\\cdot(1,1,1). We will show that\nthis gives us a valid bound on Up⁡(f)Up𝑓\\operatorname{Up}(f) in the new slice. However cannot proceed as before by refining the central square of this bound\nusing a grid search. Figure 6 shows an example of why this is\nthe case: in the example the entire up-set (labelled as U𝑈U in the figure) is\ncontained in one of the lobes, so we lose the invariant that all almost square\ncritical boxes lie in the central square when we jump to a new slice. So we must now use a different procedure to reestablish that invariant.\nFor the example given in\nFigure 6, we can actually make a single query at the point p𝑝p\nshown in the figure to\ndetermine that the up-set lies in the left lobe: if we find that p1>f1​(p)subscript𝑝1subscript𝑓1𝑝p_{1}>f_{1}(p), then monotonicity implies that all points that lie directly below p𝑝p\nalso move strictly to the left, meaning that if Up⁡(f)∩siUp𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖\\operatorname{Up}(f)\\cap s_{i} exists, it\nmust lie strictly within the left lobe. We can likewise make queries at the\npoints q𝑞q and r𝑟r shown in Figure 6 to determine if Up⁡(f)∩siUp𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖\\operatorname{Up}(f)\\cap s_{i} lies entirely within the bottom or diagonal lobes. In the case where the queries at p𝑝p, q𝑞q, and r𝑟r do not tell us that\nUp⁡(f)∩siUp𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖\\operatorname{Up}(f)\\cap s_{i} lies entirely within one of the lobes, we prove that every\nalmost square critical box must lie within a square region that encompasses the\ncentral square, whose area is at most a constant times the area of the central\nsquare. So we reestablish the invariant for this new larger square. The fact\nthat we have increased the area in this case does not matter, because we\nperform this step only when we jump to a new slice, and we jump to a new slice\nat most log⁡n𝑛\\log n times. Moreover, since the area is increased by a constant\nfactor, constantly many reduction steps can cancel out this increase. So our\noverall O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) query complexity is not affected. If the jumping-slices procedure finds a square region, then we can proceed with\na grid-search over this region as before. However, sometimes the jumping-slices\nprocedure determines that the up-set lies in a lobe. If, for example, the\nup-set is contained in a left lobe, then it may be the case that the width of\nthe lobe is more than a constant times the height, which means we cannot place\na constant sized grid of squares over the lobe. So we cannot proceed via\ngrid-search in this case, and we must instead use a different procedure. Here we describe the procedure for a left lobe with width w𝑤w and height hℎh.\nThe procedure for a bottom lobe is symmetric, and can be obtained by exchanging\ndimensions 1 and 2. The procedure for a diagonal lobe follows essentially the\nsame approach, but has the added annoyance of working with diagonal regions. The high-level idea is to use binary search to try to reduce the width of the\nlobe, while maintaining the invariant that the remaining space contains all\nalmost square critical boxes. We keep doing this until w≤c⋅h𝑤⋅𝑐ℎw\\leq c\\cdot h for\nsome constant c𝑐c. At which point we can continue via grid search, since we can\nnow place a constant-sized grid of squares over the space. To process a left lobe, we make a query at the point q𝑞q shown in\nFigure 7, which is the point that lies half-way along the\nbottom of the lobe. In Figure 7 (a) we have q1>f1​(q)subscript𝑞1subscript𝑓1𝑞q_{1}>f_{1}(q). As has been observed\nin prior work on contraction maps [ref]5, the point q𝑞q induces the\nfollowing cone constraint: any point x𝑥x in the cone defined x≥q𝑥𝑞x\\geq q\nand |x2−q2|≤x1−q1subscript𝑥2subscript𝑞2subscript𝑥1subscript𝑞1|x_{2}-q_{2}|\\leq x_{1}-q_{1} must also satisfy x1>f1​(x)subscript𝑥1subscript𝑓1𝑥x_{1}>f_{1}(x), because\notherwise we would have a violation of contraction. Overlaying\nthis cone onto the lobe shows us that once we move hℎh units to the right of\nq𝑞q, all points in the lobe will move strictly rightward. Thus we can eliminate\nall points to the right of q+h⋅e1𝑞⋅ℎsubscript𝑒1q+h\\cdot e_{1}, because none of these points can\nlie in Up⁡(f)Up𝑓\\operatorname{Up}(f), and since we assume h≪wmuch-less-thanℎ𝑤h\\ll w, this roughly halves the area of\nthe lobe. The case where q1≤f1​(q)subscript𝑞1subscript𝑓1𝑞q_{1}\\leq f_{1}(q) is more problematic, however. Here,\nas shown in Figure 7 (b), the cone-constraints applied to q𝑞q\nimply that all points p𝑝p in the lobe with p1≤q1−hsubscript𝑝1subscript𝑞1ℎp_{1}\\leq q_{1}-h satisfy p1≤f1​(p)subscript𝑝1subscript𝑓1𝑝p_{1}\\leq f_{1}(p).\nMoreover, any almost square critical box must have height at most hℎh, and so\nwidth at most h+1ℎ1h+1. Since a critical box is required to touch a point p𝑝p\nwith p1>f1​(p)subscript𝑝1subscript𝑓1𝑝p_{1}>f_{1}(p) on its right boundary, there cannot exist any almost square critical box whose\nlower-left corner x𝑥x satisfies x1≤q1−2​h−1subscript𝑥1subscript𝑞12ℎ1x_{1}\\leq q_{1}-2h-1. So if we consider the line L𝐿L defined by points x𝑥x with x1=q1−2​h−1subscript𝑥1subscript𝑞12ℎ1x_{1}=q_{1}-2h-1, we know that the area to the right of the line satisfies the invariant that\nthe region contains all almost square critical boxes. However, we cannot remove\nthe area to the left of L𝐿L, because we are required to maintain a bound on the\nentire up-set, and the up-set may still exist to the left of L𝐿L. To solve this we make one further query at the point p𝑝p shown in\nFigure 7 (b), which lies half-way along the line L𝐿L. We show\nthat the response to this query always allows us to rule out half of the\nremaining area. In the example given in the picture, the region above and to\nthe left of p𝑝p is excluded, for example. We could attempt to perform binary search along the line L𝐿L to rule out the\nentire space to the left of L𝐿L, but this would cost us log⁡n𝑛\\log n queries, which\nis too expensive. Instead, we will slowly reduce this remaining space over the\nsubsequent iterations of the algorithm. Specifically, we split the lobe into a main lobe, which is the area on\nthe right of L𝐿L, which always contains all of the almost square critical\nboxes, and a sub-lobe, which lies to the left of L𝐿L and contains the\nrest of the up-set.\nIn each step we reduce the size of the main-lobe by\na constant fraction, and then if we create a new-sub lobe, we make some extra\nqueries to merge it with the existing sub-lobe. Finally we make one extra query\nto reduce the size of the sub-lobe by a constant fraction.\nAn example of this is shown in Figure 7 (c). Here, like in\nFigure 7 (a) we have eliminated a constant fraction of the\nmain lobe, and we then make one additional query at the point r𝑟r to rule out a\nconstant fraction of the sub-lobe. Eventually we will reduce the size of the main-lobe enough so that grid-search\ncan once again be applied. However, we may still have a sub-lobe at this point,\nso our grid-search algorithm also needs to keep reducing the size\nof the sub-lobe in each step to ensure that our overall bound on the up-set\nkeeps decreasing by a constant fraction. Overall, the shape of our bound on the up-set can always be described by the\nshape shown in Figure 8 (which is defined formally in\nDefinition 88). This shape has a central region that is\nroughly square shaped, meaning that the height and width are constant multiples\nof one another. The central region is\nsurrounded by a left, bottom, and diagonal lobe, each of which have sub-lobes\nattached. Of course, in most scenarios we do not use the full generality of the\nshape. For example, when we are processing a left lobe, the central region and\nthe bottom and diagonal lobes are both empty. The main technical result that enables the algorithm is that, if we are given a\nregion of the form shown in Figure 8, then we can make\nconstantly many queries and either find a point in Up⁡(f)∩siUp𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖\\operatorname{Up}(f)\\cap s_{i}, correctly\ndeclare that Up⁡(f)∩si=∅Up𝑓subscript𝑠𝑖\\operatorname{Up}(f)\\cap s_{i}=\\emptyset, or find a\nnew region of the same form in which the area has been reduced by a constant\nfraction. This then gives us our inner up-set algorithm that can be used with\nthe outer binary search described earlier. The outer algorithm continues until it finds a slice sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i} that contains both\nan up-set point and a down-set point. Now we must find a fixed point in this\nslice. The first thing we must do is to prove that sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i} actually contains a fixed\npoint555The\nprior algorithm for monotone functions given in  ensured that the remaining\nspace always lies between the up-set and down-set points that are found by the\nouter algorithm, which ensures that sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i} must contain a fixed point. We are unable to maintain this invariant\nhere, because if we try to reduce the remaining space by excluding all points\nthat do not lie above some up-set point x𝑥x, then we may change the set of\nalmost-square critical boxes, and\ninvalidate our bounds. So this extra step is necessary for our setting..\nThis might not be the case if f𝑓f was just a monotone function. However,\nusing the extra properties of a 𝖣𝖬𝖠𝖢𝖣𝖬𝖠𝖢\\mathsf{DMAC} instance, we can show that this is indeed\nthe case. Specifically, we can use the path of fixed points l=p1,p2,…,pk=gformulae-sequence𝑙superscript𝑝1superscript𝑝2…superscript𝑝𝑘𝑔l=p^{1},p^{2},\\dots,p^{k}=g\nwith ‖pi−pi+1‖∞=1subscriptnormsuperscript𝑝𝑖superscript𝑝𝑖11\\|p^{i}-p^{i+1}\\|_{\\infty}=1\nfrom the least fixed point l𝑙l to the greatest fixed point g𝑔g\nwhose existence we proved when we put\n𝖣𝖬𝖠𝖢𝖣𝖬𝖠𝖢\\mathsf{DMAC} in 𝖴𝖤𝖮𝖯𝖫𝖴𝖤𝖮𝖯𝖫\\mathsf{UEOPL}. Since slice sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i} contains an up-set point, by Tarski’s\ntheorem the greatest fixed point either lies in sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i} or above it. Likewise,\nsince sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i} contains a down-set point, the least fixed point either lies in\nsisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i} or below it. If neither the greatest or least fixed points lie in sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i},\nthen the path must pass through sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i}, so there is indeed a fixed point in\nsisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i}. Next we must actually find this fixed point. We design a specialized terminal phase\nalgorithm for this task. We show that any query to the slice sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i} either\nreturns a fixed point, or rules out a vertical half-space, a horizontal\nhalf-space, or diagonal half-space that is aligned with the vector (1,1)11(1,1). We\nuse this fact to build a O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) query algorithm that finds a fixed point\nin the slice. In total, the algorithm makes O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) queries and returns a fixed point of\nf𝑓f. Moreover, all of the steps of our algorithm run in time that is polynomial\nin the size of the representation of f𝑓f\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: which is the point that lies half-way along the\nbottom of the lobe.
