      "content": "Paper Title: ImPress: Securing DRAM Against Data-Disturbance Errors via Implicit Row-Press Mitigation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo the best of our knowledge, ImPress-P represents the first tracker implementation that can securely tolerate both Rowhammer and Row-Press. ImPress exploits the observation that the row-open time can be converted into equivalent activity for Rowhammer. Prior works have made similar observations. For example, ProTRR  was the first to suggests to “increase the counter for victims of the (aggressor) row that remains active”. However, it does not provide methodology to convert the row-open time into equivalent RH (notably, ProTRR appeared one year before Row-Press was publicly known and characterized, so the lack of such details is understandable). Furthermore, ProTRR operates with integer-valued counters, and ImPress-N shows that such an integer-valued design has a significantly higher threshold. While DSAC [ref]11 uses time-weighted counting, it suffers from three problems: (1) the weight is a logarithmic function of time, for example, for tON=256 tRC, the weight will be approximately 8, whereas, the Row-Press characterization  shows that the weight should be about 0.48*256 = 122 (15x higher). Thus, DSAC significantly underestimates the RP damage, (2) Row-Press is ignored for the row getting installed in the tracker, as it always uses a weight of 1, (3) DSAC uses integer counter values and would suffer from the same problem as ImPress-N, even if the weights were accurate. We note that DSAC can be broken with Blacksmith , so assessing the security of DSAC against Row-Press is impractical. Several studies [ref]16    [ref]16  ,   have investigated efficient trackers to identify aggressor rows. Our design can work with any of these trackers. We do not consider In-DRAM designs of TRR [ref]6, DSAC [ref]11, and PAT  as these can be broken with simple patterns [ref]6. Our work is applicable to secure in-DRAM trackers, such as Mithril , MINT , ProTRR , and PRHT . Prior works have looked at alternative mitigation techniques, such as rate-limiting  or Dynamic row-migration    . Prior studies      have also proposed to use ECC and detection codes to tolerate Rowhammer. All these works can reduce, but not eliminate, DDE errors. REGA  and HiRA 6 modify the DRAM module to support multiple concurrent mitigative activations.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: of such details is understandable).
