      "content": "Paper Title: FeTrIL: Feature Translation for Exemplar-Free Class-Incremental Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCIL algorithms are needed when data arrive sequentially and/or computational constraints are important    .\nTheir objective is to ensure a good balance between plasticity, i.e. integration of new information, and stability, i.e. preservation of knowledge about past classes .\nThis is challenging because the lack of past data leads to catastrophic forgetting, i.e. the tendency of neural networks to focus on newly learned data at the expense of past knowledge .\nRecent reviews of CIL   show that a majority of methods replay samples of past classes to mitigate forgetting  4 [ref]34 7.\nOne advantage here is that the network architecture remains constant throughout the incremental process.\nHowever, these methods have two major drawbacks: (1)\nFirst, the assumption that past samples are available is strong since in many cases past data cannot be stored due, for instance, to privacy restrictions 2 and\n(2) the memory footprint of the stored images is high. Here, we investigate exemplar-free CIL, with focus on methods which keep the network size constant.\nThis setting is very challenging since it imposes strong constraints on both memory and computational costs.\nA majority of existing methods use regularization to update the deep model for each incremental step , and adapt distillation  to preserve past knowledge by penalizing variations for past classes during model updates.\nNote that, while some of the distillation-based methods were introduced in an exemplar-based CIL (EBCIL) setting, many of them are also applicable to EFCIL.\nThis approach to CIL was popularized by iCaRL [ref]34, itself inspired by learning without forgetting (LwF) 0.\nDistillation was later refined and complemented with other components to improve the plasticity-stability compromise.\nLUCIR 4 applies distillation on features instead of raw classification scores to preserve the geometry of past classes, and an inter-class separation to maximize the distances between past and new classes.\nThe problem was partially addressed by adding specific class separability components in   4.\nDistillation-based methods need to store the current and the preceding model for incremental updates.\nTheir memory footprint is larger compared to methods which do not use distillation . Another important problem in CIL is the semantic drift between incremental states.\nAuxiliary classifiers were introduced in 1 to reduce the effect of forgetting.\nABD  uses image inversion to produce pseudo-samples of past classes.\nThe method is interesting but image inversion is difficult for complex datasets.\nAnother interesting solution is proposed in 6, where the features drift between incremental steps is estimated from that of new classes.\nRecent EFCIL approaches 8 9  use past class prototypes in conjunction with distillation to improve performance.\nPrototype augmentation is proposed in PASS 9 to improve the discrimination of classes learned in different incremental states.\nFeature generation for past classes is introduced in IL2A 8 by leveraging information about the class distribution.\nThis approach is difficult to scale-up because a covariance matrix needs to be stored for each class.\nA prototype selection mechanism is introduced in SSRE  to better discriminate past from new classes.\nFeTrIL shares the idea of using class prototypes with 6 8 9 .\nAn important difference is that we freeze the model after the initial state, while the other methods deploy more sophisticated mechanisms to integrate prototypes in a knowledge distillation process.\nPast comparative studies   found that, while appealing in theory, distillation-based methods underperform in EFCIL, particularly for large-scale datasets.\nSecond, since the representation space is fixed, a simple geometric translation of actual features of new classes is sufficient to produce usable pseudo-features.\nIn contrast, IL2A 8, the work which is closest to ours, needs to store a covariance matrix per class to obtain optimal performance.\nThird, the use of a fixed extractor simplifies the training process since only the final linear layer is trained, compared to a fine tuning of the backbone model required by recent methods which use prototypes and feature generation. Another line of work takes inspiration from transfer learning 9  to tackle EFCIL.\nA feature extractor is trained in the initial non-incremental state and fixed afterwards.\nThen, an external classification layer is updated in each incremental state to integrate new classes.\nThe nearest class mean (NCM) 7 was used in  [ref]34, linear SVMs  were used in  and extreme value machines  were recently tested by .\nThe advantages of transfer-learning methods are their simplicity, since only the classification layer is updated, and their lower memory requirement, since they need a single deep model to function.\nThese methods give competitive performance compared to distillation-based ones in EFCIL, particularly at scale .\nHowever, features are not updated, and they are sensitive to large domain shifts between incremental tasks .\nEqually, existing transfer-learning inspired works do not sufficiently address inter-class separability, which is in focus here.\n Class prototypes creation was studied in other learning settings than CIL.\nA very interesting method focused on few-shot learning was proposed in .\nA distance-based classifier which uses an approximation of the Mahalanobis distance is proposed.\nThe means and variances of new classes are predicted using two supplementary neural networks.\nWhile adapted for few-shot learning, such an approach is not fully adapted in CIL.\nFirst, the supplementary neural networks require a large number of supplementary parameters.\nThis is a disadvantage here, since CIL methods are needed in computationally-constrained environments.\nSecond, we do not focus on few-shot learning and the means of past classes are well-placed in the representation space.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: of neural networks to focus on newly learned data at the expense of past knowledge .\nRecent reviews of CIL   show that a majority of methods replay samples of past classes to mitigate forgetting  4 [ref]34 7.\nOne advantage here is that the network architecture remains constant throughout the incremental process.\nHowever, these methods have two major drawbacks: (1)\nFirst, the assumption that\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
