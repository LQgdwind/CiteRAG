Resnet-18 backbone  without the final layer as a shared encoder and a 2048 x 2 dimensional fully connected layer for each task is employed as in . We train this network for 100 epochs with Adam optimizer  of learning rate 5‚Äãe‚àí45ùëí45e-4 and batch size 646464. All images are resized to 64√ó64√ó36464364\\times 64\\times 3. Due to space constraints, we report only the abbreviation of each task in the main paper, their full names are presented below. Now we investigate the effectiveness of\nour proposed MT-SGD method on the whole CelebA dataset, compared with prior work: Uniform scaling: minimizing the uniformly weighted sum of objective functions, Single task: train separate models individually for each task, Uncertainty : adaptive reweighting with balanced uncertainty, Gradnorm [ref]4: balance the loss functions via gradient magnitude and MGDA . The results from previous work are reported in [ref]4. For MGDA, we use their officially released codebase at https://github.com/isl-org/MultiObjectiveOptimization. For a fair comparison, we run the code with five different random seeds and present the obtained scores in Figure 9. Following , we divide 40 target binary attributes into two subgroups: hard and easy tasks for easier visualization. As can be seen from Figure 9, we observe that the naively trained\nUniform scaling has relatively low performance on many tasks, e.g. ‚ÄúMustache‚Äù, ‚ÄúBig Lips‚Äù, ‚ÄúOval Face‚Äù. Compared to other baselines, our proposed method significantly reduces the prediction error in almost all the tasks, especially on ‚ÄúGoatee‚Äù, ‚ÄúDouble Chi‚Äù and ‚ÄúNo Beard‚Äù. The detailed result for each target attribute can be found in Table 5.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: minimizing the uniformly weighted sum of objective functions, Single task: train separate models individually for each task, Uncertainty : adaptive reweighting with balanced uncertainty, Gradnorm [ref]4: balance the loss functions via gradient magnitude and MGDA .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
