      "content": "Paper Title: FedRecover: Recovering from Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning using Historical Information\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFederated learning (FL)   is an emerging machine learning paradigm that enables many clients (e.g., smartphones, IoT devices, and edge devices) to collaboratively learn a shared machine learning model (called global model).\nSpecifically, training data are decentralized over the clients in FL, and a server maintains the global model. Roughly speaking, FL performs the following three steps in each round: the server broadcasts the current global model to (a subset of)\nthe clients; each client\nfine-tunes the global model using its local training data and reports its model update to the server; and the server aggregates the clients’ model updates following some aggregation rule and uses the aggregated model update to update the global model. Different FL methods essentially use different aggregation rules. FL\nhas been deployed by tech giants. For instance, Google uses FL on a virtual keyboard app called Gboard  for next-word prediction; and WeBank leverages FL for credit risk prediction . However, due to its distributed setting, FL is vulnerable to poisoning attacks    [ref]12. Specifically, an attacker may have access to some malicious clients, which could be fake clients injected into the system by the attacker [ref]12 or genuine clients compromised by the attacker   . The malicious clients poison the global model via sending carefully crafted malicious model updates to the server. A malicious client can craft its malicious model update by poisoning its local training data and/or directly constructing it without following the prescribed FL protocol.\nIn an untargeted poisoning attack  [ref]12, the poisoned global model indiscriminately misclassifies many test inputs, i.e., the poisoned global model has a large test error rate.\nIn a targeted poisoning attack  , the poisoned global model predicts an attacker-chosen target label for attacker-chosen target test inputs but its predictions for other test inputs are unaffected. For instance, in backdoor attacks (one category of targeted poisoning attacks) , the target test inputs could be any input embedded with an attacker-chosen trigger. Existing defenses against poisoning attacks to FL prevent a small number of malicious clients from poisoning the global model and/or detect malicious clients.\nSpecifically, some studies proposed Byzantine-robust [ref]11 5 6   6 or provably robust  FL methods that can prevent a small number of malicious clients from poisoning the global model, i.e., they can guarantee the global model learnt with malicious clients is close to the global model learnt without them [ref]11 5 6 or guarantee a lower bound of testing accuracy under a bounded number of malicious clients . However, these FL methods are still vulnerable to poisoning attacks with a large number of malicious clients  9.\nTherefore, some studies 3 0 9 further proposed to detect malicious clients during or after the training process, which can be used together with the prevention methods in a defense-in-depth strategy. For instance, the server may distinguish between the malicious clients and benign ones via some statistical differences in their model updates sent to the server. Since such detection methods require enough model updates to make confident decisions, the malicious clients often have already poisoned the global model before being detected.\nTherefore, the server needs to recover an accurate global model from the poisoned one after detecting the malicious clients. However, efficient model recovery in FL is largely unexplored. Since the server does not know in which round the attack happens, the server may not be able to simply roll back to a clean global model in a prior round.\nA naive recovery method (we call it train-from-scratch) is to remove the detected malicious clients and train a new global model from scratch using the remaining clients.\nTrain-from-scratch could recover an accurate global model. However, it introduces substantial computation and communication cost to the clients since it requires them to participate in the entire training process once again. Such computation and communication cost may be intolerable for resource-constrained clients such as smartphones and IoT devices. Our work:  In this work, we propose FedRecover, a method that can recover an accurate global model from a poisoned one while introducing small computation and communication cost for the clients.\nLike train-from-scratch, FedRecover removes the detected malicious clients, re-initializes a global model, and trains it iteratively in multiple rounds. However, unlike train-from-scratch, FedRecover reduces the cost for the clients by changing the way of obtaining their model updates.\nOur intuition is that the historical information, including the global models and clients’ model updates, which the server collected when training the poisoned global model before the malicious clients are detected, still carry valuable information for model recovery. Based on the intuition, our key idea is that, during the recovery process, the server estimates the remaining clients’ model updates using such historical information instead of asking the clients to compute and communicate them. FedRecover is independent of the detection methods used to detect the malicious clients and the aggregation rules of FL. In other words, FedRecover can be used together with any detection method and FL aggregation rule in a defense-in-depth strategy. The key of FedRecover is that the server estimates the clients’ model updates itself during the recovery process. Specifically, the server stores the historical information when training the poisoned global model before the malicious clients are detected. During the recovery process, the server uses the well-known Cauchy mean value theorem to estimate each client’s model update in each round. However, the Cauchy mean value theorem requires an integrated Hessian matrix for each client, whose exact value is challenging to compute. To address the challenge, we further leverage an L-BFGS based algorithm to efficiently approximate the integrated Hessian matrix. FedRecover introduces some storage and computation cost to the server due to storing the historical information and estimating the clients’ model updates. However, such cost is acceptable since the server is powerful. Since FedRecover estimates the clients’ model updates, the estimation errors may accumulate over multiple rounds during the recovery process, which eventually may result in a less accurate recovered global model. We propose multiple strategies to address the challenge. Specifically, the L-BFGS algorithm requires the recovered global models in the previous several rounds to estimate a client’s model update in the current round. The accurately recovered global models in the first several rounds of the recovery process will help reduce the estimation errors in the future rounds. Therefore, we propose the warm-up strategy, in which the server asks the clients to compute and communicate their exact model updates in the first Twsubscript𝑇𝑤T_{w} rounds of the recovery process. Moreover, we propose the periodic correction strategy, in which the server asks the clients to compute and communicate their exact model updates in every Tcsubscript𝑇𝑐T_{c} rounds. When an estimated model update for a client is large, it has large influence on the recovered global model. To reduce the impact of potentially incorrectly estimated large model updates, we propose the abnormality fixing strategy, in which the server asks a client to compute its exact model update when at least one coordinate of the estimated model update is larger than a threshold τ𝜏\\tau. Furthermore, we propose final tuning strategy to reduce the estimation error before the training terminates, in which the server asks the clients to compute and communicate their exact model updates in the last Tfsubscript𝑇𝑓T_{f} rounds.\nThe parameters Twsubscript𝑇𝑤T_{w}, Tcsubscript𝑇𝑐T_{c}, τ𝜏\\tau, and Tfsubscript𝑇𝑓T_{f} control the trade-off between accuracy of the recovered global model and computation/communication cost for the clients. In particular, a larger Twsubscript𝑇𝑤T_{w}, a smaller Tcsubscript𝑇𝑐T_{c}, a smaller τ𝜏\\tau, or a larger Tfsubscript𝑇𝑓T_{f} may recover a more accurate global model but also introduces a larger cost to the clients. Theoretically, we show that the difference between the global model recovered by FedRecover and the global model recovered by train-from-scratch can be bounded under some assumptions, e.g., the loss function used to learn the global model is smooth and strongly convex. Empirically, we evaluate FedRecover extensively using four datasets, three FL methods (e.g., FedAvg , Median 6, and Trimmed-mean 6), as well as Trim attack (an untargeted poisoning attack)  and backdoor attack (a targeted poisoning attack) . Our empirical results show that FedRecover can recover global models that are as accurate as those recovered by train-from-scratch while saving lots of computation/communication cost for the clients.\nFor instance,\nthe backdoor attack with 40 malicious clients can achieve 1.00 attack success rate when the dataset is MNIST and the FL method is Trimmed-mean. Both FedRecover and train-from-scratch can recover global models with 0.07 test error rate and 0.01 attack success rate, but FedRecover saves the clients’ computation/communication cost by 88% on average compared to train-from-scratch. Moreover,\nFedRecover can efficiently recover as accurate global models as train-from-scratch even if the detection method incorrectly detects some malicious clients as benign and/or some benign clients as malicious. In summary, our key contributions are as follows: We perform the first systematic study on model recovery from poisoning attacks in FL. We propose FedRecover\nto recover a global model via estimating clients’ model updates through historical information and multiple optimization strategies. We evaluate FedRecover both theoretically and empirically. Our results show that FedRecover can recover a global model both accurately and efficiently.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: a virtual keyboard app called Gboard  for next-word prediction; and WeBank leverages FL for credit risk prediction .
