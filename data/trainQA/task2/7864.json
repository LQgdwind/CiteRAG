(ii) Self-supervised Learning Methods in computational pathology learn from the data itself without using labels, using pretext tasks to boost downstream task performance.\nKey in this area is contrastive learning-based methods, which focus on distinguishing between similar and contrasting instances within the data.\nBy using contrastive loss, these methods train models to discern augmentation-invariant features crucial for tasks like classification and anomaly detection. Examples include CTransPath for histology image classification [ref]39, H2T , HIPT , and . These techniques help models capture essential inherent data characteristics, enhancing performance on various computational pathology applications.\nOur approach goes beyond contrastive learning methods by not only aligning bags of images but also aligning bags of texts and additional strategies to enhance model performance.\n(iii) Learning with Pathology Language Supervision Methods integrate textual descriptions with visual data to pre-train deep models.\nAdhering to the conventional VL model training approach, these methodologies leverage paired visual-textual data within a contrastive learning framework to ensure that representations of similar visual-textual concepts are drawn closer together, while divergent ones are distanced   .\nRecently, the VL paradigm has been extended to zero-shot classification and segmentation tasks, introducing models like PLIP [ref]17, CONCH , MI-Zero [ref]29, and BiomedCLIP .\nThese innovations have brought forth new datasets containing descriptions of histology images and languages to pre-train architectures resembling CLIP .\nA limitation of these models is their potential inability to generalize well across different datasets due to the training dataset-specific biases consisting of paired textual-visual concepts.\nAlso most of these approaches primarily focus on aligning single textual and visual representations.\nIn contrast, we propose the engagement of comprehensive visual and textual data to concurrently align multiple correlated positive visual-textual concepts.\nWe argue that such an expansive and robust alignment significantly elevates performance across a spectrum of computational pathology tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: like histology image classification, segmentation, and survival prediction, numerous methods have been proposed  .\nThese methods can be broadly categorised as weakly-supervised  , self-supervised [ref]39 , and Vision-Language (VL) supervised [ref]17 [ref]29 .\n\n(i) Weakly-supervised Learning Methods (WSL) use data with labels at a broad level, without needing detailed annotations for every\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
