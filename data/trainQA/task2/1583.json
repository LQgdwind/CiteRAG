      "content": "Paper Title: HINT: Hierarchical Interaction Network for Clinical Trial Outcome Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImplementation Details\nWe use our TOP benchmark for model evaluation.\nThe implementation details are described below.\nThe curated dataset and code repository is available at 888https://github.com/futianfan/clinical-trial-outcome-prediction. ∙∙\\bullet Molecule Embedding (Section 3.3). Regarding the molecule embedding function fm​(⋅)subscript𝑓𝑚⋅f_{m}(\\cdot) in Eq. (5), HINT supports Morgan fingerprint , SMILES encoder [ref]10, graph message passing neural network (MPNN)  [ref]19  , we choose MPNN because it usually works better in our experiments.\nThe depth of MPNN is 3, with hidden layer dimension 100. The input feature of MPNN is molecular graph with atom and bond features. Following  [ref]19 , atom features is a 38 dimensional vector, including its atom type (23 dim, 22 frequent atoms and 1 unknown indicator), degree (6-dim one-hot vector, {0,1,2,3,4,5}012345\\{0,1,2,3,4,5\\}), its formal charge (5-dim one-hot vector, {−1,−2,1,2,0}12120\\{-1,-2,1,2,0\\}) and its chiral configuration (4-dim one-hot vector, {0,1,2,3}0123\\{0,1,2,3\\}). Bond feature is a 11 dim vector, which is concatenation of its bond type (4-dim one-hot vector, {single, double, triple, aromatic}single, double, triple, aromatic\\{\\text{single, double, triple, aromatic}\\}), whether the bond is in a ring (1-dim), and its cis-trans configuration (6-dim one-hot vector, {0,1,2,3,4,5}012345\\{0,1,2,3,4,5\\}).\n\n∙∙\\bullet Disease Embedding (Section 3.3). Disease embedding is obtained by GRAM  , as defined in Eq. (6). The embedding size of both 𝐡dsubscript𝐡𝑑\\mathbf{h}_{d} (Eq. 6) and 𝐞𝐞\\mathbf{e} (Eq. 7) are both 100. Following , the attention model defined in Eq. (8) is feed-forward network with a single hidden layer (with dimension 100).\n\n∙∙\\bullet Protocol Embedding (Section 3.3). 𝐬iIsubscriptsuperscript𝐬𝐼𝑖\\mathbf{s}^{I}_{i} and 𝐬iEsubscriptsuperscript𝐬𝐸𝑖\\mathbf{s}^{E}_{i} in Eq. (9) are both 768 dimensional vectors. Following , the kernel size k1,k2,k3,k4subscript𝑘1subscript𝑘2subscript𝑘3subscript𝑘4k_{1},k_{2},k_{3},k_{4} in Eq. (10) is set to 1,3,5,7, respectively.\n∙∙\\bullet Interaction Graph (Section 3.5). All the node embedding in Interaction Graph have same dimension to support graph neural network reasoning. The dimension is set to 100. The neural architecture of the connections between different nodes are one-layer fully-connected neural network followed by a two-layer highway network. The input dimension of fully-connected neural network is determined by the number of input node number while the output dimension is 100, equal to the hidden dimension of highway network and node dimension in interaction graph. For example, to obtain pharmaco-kinetics node’s embedding in Eq. (20), the input dimension of one-layer fully-connected neural network is 500=5∗1005005100500=5*100 (𝐡A,𝐡D,𝐡M,𝐡E,𝐡Tsubscript𝐡𝐴subscript𝐡𝐷subscript𝐡𝑀subscript𝐡𝐸subscript𝐡𝑇\\mathbf{h}_{A},\\mathbf{h}_{D},\\mathbf{h}_{M},\\mathbf{h}_{E},\\mathbf{h}_{T}), the output dimension is 100. To obtain Interaction node’s embedding in Eq. (21), the input dimension of one-layer fully-connected NN is 300=3∗1003003100300=3*100 (𝐡d,𝐡m,𝐡psubscript𝐡𝑑subscript𝐡𝑚subscript𝐡𝑝\\mathbf{h}_{d},\\mathbf{h}_{m},\\mathbf{h}_{p}).\n\n∙∙\\bullet Graph Neural Architecture (Section 3.5).\nThe hidden size of GCN in Eq. (25) is set to 200. The dropout rate is set to 0.6. The feature dimension of GCN is 100, equal to node’s embedding size. The graph attention model defined in Eq. (26) is a two-layer fully-connected neural network with output dimension 1 with sigmoid activation. The input size is 200=2∗1002002100200=2*100 (concatenation of two nodes’ embedding), the hidden size is 50, the output dimension is 1. As shown in Eq. (26), the output is a scalar, 𝐕i,j∈ℝ+subscript𝐕𝑖𝑗subscriptℝ\\mathbf{V}_{i,j}\\in\\mathbb{R}_{+}. The depth of GNN L𝐿L is set to 3.\n\n∙∙\\bullet Learning. During both pre-training and training procedure, we use the Adam as optimizer [ref]28. The learning rate is selected from {1​e−4,5​e−4,1​e−3}1superscript𝑒45superscript𝑒41superscript𝑒3\\{1e^{-4},5e^{-4},1e^{-3}\\} and tuned on validation set. When pretraining ADMET models, the learning rate is set to 5​e−45superscript𝑒45e^{-4}. When pretraining disease risk model, learning rate is set to 1​e−31superscript𝑒31e^{-3}. When training HINT, the learning rate is set to 5​e−45superscript𝑒45e^{-4}. The maximal epochs are set to 10. We observe all the models converged within maximal epochs.\nWe save the model every epoch and choose the model that performs best on validation set. All hyperparameters are tuned on validation set. Evaluation Settings We consider two realistic evaluation setups. The first is phase-level evaluation where we predict the outcome of a single phase study. Since each phase has different goals (e.g. Phase I is for safety whereas Phase II and III is for efficacy), we conduct evaluation for Phase I, II and III individually. We create the test datasets using the FDA guideline999https://www.fda.gov/patients/drug-development-process/step-3-clinical-research on the success-failure ratio for each phase, specifically 70% success rate for Phase I, 33% for Phase II and 30% for Phase III. Second, we also consider indication-level evaluation where we test if the drug can pass all three phases for the final market approval. To imitate it, we assemble all phase studies related to the drug and disease of the study and then use the latest phase protocol as the input to our model. Drugs that have Phase III success are labelled positive and other drugs that fail in any of the three phases are labelled negative. Data statistics are shown in Table 2. Evaluation Metrics\nWe use the following metrics to measure the performance of all methods.\n\n∙∙\\bullet PR-AUC (Precision-Recall Area Under Curve).\n\n∙∙\\bullet F1. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall.\n\n∙∙\\bullet ROC-AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve).\n\n∙∙\\bullet p-value. We report the results of hypothesis testing in terms of p-value to showcase the statistical significance of our method over the best baseline results. If p-value is smaller than 0.05, we claim our method significantly outperforms the best baseline method. For PR-AUC, F1, and ROC-AUC, higher value represent better performance.\nWe split the dataset based on registration date. The earlier trials are used for learning while the later trials are used for inference. For example, for Phase I dataset, we learn the model using the trials before Aug 13th, 2014 and make inference using the trials after that date, as shown in Table 2.\nWe use Bootstrap  to estimate the mean and standard deviation of accuracy on test set. Baselines. We compare HINT with several baselines, including both conventional machine learning models and deep learning methods. LR (Logistic Regression). It was used in  on trial prediction with disease features only. For fair comparison, we adapt it such that the input features include (i) 1024 dimensional Morgan fingerprint feature , (ii) GRAM embedding (Eq. 7, GRAM is pretrained using disease risk module Eq. 18) and (iii) BERT embedding of eligibility criteria for protocol. Then these three features are concatenated as the input of LR model. RF (Random Forest). Similarly to LR, it was used in  on trial prediction and we adapt it to use the same feature set. XGBoost. An implementation of gradient boosted decision trees designed for speed and performance. It was used in context of individual patient trial outcome prediction in . We adapt it to use the same feature set for general trial outcome prediction. AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting). It was used in  for individual Alzheimer’s patient’s trial result prediction. We adapt it to use the same feature set. kNN+RF.  leverages statistical imputation techniques to handle missing data, and finds using (1) kNN (k-Nearest Neighbor) as imputation technique and (2) Random Forest as classifier would achieve best performance. We adapt this method to use the same feature set. FFNN (Feed-Forward Neural Network) . It uses the same feature with LR. The feature vectors are fed into a three-layer feedforward neural network. DeepEnroll . DeepEnroll was originally designed for patient trial matching, it uses (1) pre-trained BERT model  to encode eligibility criteria into sentence embedding; (2) a hierarchical embedding model to disease information and (3) alignment model to capture the protocol-disease interaction information. To adapt it to our scenario, molecule embedding (𝐡msubscript𝐡𝑚\\mathbf{h}_{m}) is concatenated to the output of alignment model to make prediction. COMPOSE (cross-modal pseudo-siamese network) . COMPOSE was also originally designed for patient trial matching, it uses convolutional highway network and memory network to encode eligibility criteria and diseases respectively and an alignment model to model the interaction. COMPOSE incorporate the molecule information in the same way with DeepEnroll, as mentioned above.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: ∙∙\\bullet Molecule Embedding (Section 3.3).
