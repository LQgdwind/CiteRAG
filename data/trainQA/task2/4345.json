      "content": "Paper Title: Organic Priors in Non-Rigid Structure from Motion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n(a) MoCap Benchmark Dataset. Introduced by Akther et al. and Torresani et al., this dataset has become a standard benchmark for any NRSfM¬†algorithm evaluation. It is composed of 8 real sequences, namely Drink (1102, 41), Pickup (357, 41), Yoga (307, 41), Stretch (370, 41), Dance (264, 75), Walking (260, 55), Face (316, 40) and Shark (240, 91). The last 3 sequences were introduced by Torresani et al.. The numbers presented in bracket correspond to number of frames and points (F,P)ùêπùëÉ(F,P). Tab.(2) shows the comparison of our method with other competing methods. For evaluation, we keep the value of KùêæK generally same as BMM . From Tab.(2), it is easy to observe that more often than not, our approach performs best or second-best than other methods, thus showing a consistent superior performance over a diverse set of object deformation type. Compared to BMM , which also makes no assumption other than low-rank, our <<organic prior>> based method dramatically improves 3D reconstruction accuracy, thereby validating our claims made in the paper. Fig.(2) shows few qualitative results along with the convergence curve comparison with the current methods such as R-BMM [ref]28, AOW [ref]24. The results show recovery of better minima and stable convergence curve using our rotation estimate initialization. (b) Dense NRSfM¬†Benchmark Dataset. Introduced by Garg et al. , it is a standard dataset to evaluate dense NRSfM¬†methods. It comprises of 4 synthetic face sequences and 3 real video sequences of heart, back, and face deformation. The synthetic face dataset is composed of 28,880 tracked feature points. Face sequence 1 and Face sequence 2 are 10 frames long video, whereas Face sequence 3 and Face sequence 4 are 99 frames video. The video sequence for heart, back, and face dataset is 80, 150, and 120 frames long with 68295, 20561, and 28332 feature track points. Tab.(3) provides the statistical results of our approach compared to well-known dense NRSfM¬†algorithms. For better comprehension, we classified the comparison into two sets i.e., sparse NRSfM¬†methods and dense NRSfM¬†methods. From Tab.(3), it is easy to observe the advantage of our approach compared to well-known sparse NRSfM¬†methods. For evaluation of our method, we use K=1ùêæ1K=1 for all the four sequence. For other methods  , we iterate over different KùêæK and put its best possible results. The interesting point to note is that without using any extra assumptions about the dense deforming surface such as union of linear subspaces [ref]29 , variation in the deformation over frame should be smooth , dynamic shape prior , smooth trajectory constraint , and recent deep neural network based latent space constraint , our method provide impressive results and it is close to the best method[ref]29. Note that, contrary to our simple approach, GM[ref]29 is a complex geometric method to implement. To conclude, our results reveal the strength of classical NRSfM¬†factorization if organic priors are exploited sensibly. (c) NRSfM¬†Challenge Dataset. Jensen et al. recently proposed this dataset. It comprises 5 different subjects, namely Articulated, Paper, Balloon, Stretch, and Tearing. Each subject‚Äôs deformations is captured under 6 varying camera trajectories i.e., circle, flyby, line, semi-circle, tricky and zigzag, making the dataset interesting yet challenging. For evaluation, the dataset provide a single frame ground-truth 3D shape for each subject. Tab.(4) show the average 3D reconstruction accuracy comparison in millimeters with the recent and earlier state-of-the-art on this dataset i.e., BMM , R-BMM[ref]28, AOW [ref]24, BP. For comparison, we used the orthogonal sequence of the dataset. The value of KùêæK used by our method for comparison is provided in the bracket. Statistical results indicate that our approach provides better non-rigid shape reconstruction for most of the subject categories on this dataset. Fig.(3) show visual results obtained on this dataset. (d) Rotation Estimation.\nTo validate that the single rotation averaging gives meaningful rotation, we validate our results using the ground-truth rotation available in the Akther et al. dataset. Tab.(5) provide the average camera rotation error eùêësubscriptùëíùêëe_{\\mathbf{R}} results on yoga, pickup, stretch, and drink sequence. The statistics show that using our approach, we can have fine rotation estimate777With ùêñ=ùêëùêíùêñùêëùêí\\mathbf{W=RS} theory, even GT rotation cannot provide GT shape, cf.  Table(3). Further, advantage of our rotation estimation on clean sequence, noisy trajectories and pseudo inverse solution can be inferred from Tab.(6) Fig.4(a), and Tab.(1), respectively. (e) Other Experiments and Ablations. (i) Performance with noisy trajectory. Fig.4(a), Fig.4(b) shows the rotation (eùêësubscriptùëíùêëe_{\\mathbf{R}}) and shape error (e3‚Äãdsubscriptùëí3ùëëe_{3d}) comparison on the noisy trajectory, respectively. We introduce noise to the 2D point trajectory with the standard deviation varying from 0.01-0.25 using normrand() function from MATLAB. We ran the different methods 10 times for each standard deviation value and plotted the method‚Äôs mean and variance. Statistical results show that our method is quite robust to noisy sequence and show much stable behaviour (both in rotation and shape estimation) than the other prior or prior-free approaches (see Fig.4(a)-4(b)). (ii) Performance on missing trajectory cases.\nFor this experiment, we used Lee et al.6 and Kumar [ref]28 setup, where we randomly set 30% of the trajectory missing from the ùêñùêñ\\mathbf{W}. We perform matrix completion using  optimization and then ran our algorithm on the recovered matrix. The results are shown in Fig.4(c). Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in most of the cases. (iii) Performance with change in value of NùëÅN. To show that N=1ùëÅ1N=1 generally works best for Eq.(10), we conducted this experiment. First, we penalize all the singular values using WNN optimization (N=0ùëÅ0N=0) and then we vary the value of NùëÅN from 1 to 555 and recorded the results. Fig.4(d) shows the reconstruction results using different values of NùëÅN. We observed that by penalizing all the singular values using WNN, we are unnecessarily hurting the performance. On the contrary, if we increase NùëÅN value greater than 1, more often than not, it starts to reduce the performance.

Fig.(2) shows few qualitative results along with the convergence curve comparison with the current methods such as R-BMM [ref]28, AOW [ref]24.
