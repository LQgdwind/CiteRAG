      "content": "Paper Title: Entity Type Prediction Leveraging Graph Walks and Entity Descriptions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMany efforts have been made towards the automated generation of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) from heterogeneous resources such as text or images. One such effort is the creation of cross-domain KGs such as DBpedia , Wikidata 2, Freebase , etc. which are either extracted automatically from structured data, generated using heuristics, or are human-curated. This leads to incomplete information in the KGs which can occur on factual level (e.g., missing entities and/or relations between the entities) or on schema level (e.g., the missing entity type information). For instance, DBpedia version 2016-10 consists of 48 subclasses of dbo:Person; however, only 36.6% of the total number of entities belonging to dbo:Person are assigned to its subclasses. Moreover, 307,164 entities in the entire DBpedia 2016-10 version are assigned to owl:Thing. To address the KG incompleteness on the factual level, a lot of models [ref]5  , etc. have been proposed. These models focus mainly on predicting the missing entities and relations in the KGs but not the entity types. However, the entity type information in KGs plays a vital role in various Natural Language Processing based applications such as question answering , relation extraction 0, recommendation, or system . Following these lines, this paper focuses on the problem of entity typing which is the task of assigning or inferring the semantic type of an entity in a KG. Figure 1 shows an excerpt from DBpedia where the class dbo:MusicalArtistis a subclass of dbo:Artist which is a subclass of dbo:Person. dbo:Artist and dbo:MusicalArtist, respectively, are the fine-grained entity types for dbr:Hans_Zimmer\nand dbo:Artist is the missing type information. dbo:Person is the coarse-grained type. Recent years have witnessed a few studies on entity typing approaches in KGs using heuristics  and machine learning based classification models 7 7 1 2 . These models predict entity types using different KG features such as the anchor text mentions in the textual entity descriptions, relations between the entities, entity names, and Wikipedia categories. They learn the representation of the entities from their KG structure by using translational models 5, GCN-based models 2, neighborhood based attention models 1 followed by the correlation between the entities and its types. These models exploit the neighborhood information only by the entities directly connected, i.e., the triple information of the entities. However, the large amount of contextual information of the entities captured in the graph walks remains unexplored. The work presented in this paper emphasizes on modeling the KG by taking advantage of the semantics of graph walks to predict the entity types with the help of different kinds of walk generation strategies, such as classic random walks, entity walks, and property walks. The paths generated by these graph walk strategies are used within the RDF2vec model  to generate different entity representations.\nAdditionally, the textual entity descriptions in the KGs contain rich semantic information which is beneficial in predicting the missing entity types. For instance, as depicted in Figure 1, the textual entity descriptions of the entities clearly mentions that dbr: Christopher_Nolan is a director, dbr: Hans_Zimmer is a music composer, and dbr: Inception is a film. Some of the existing baseline models such as MuLR 8 use non-contextual Neural Language Models (NLMs), whereas the other uses GCN model 2 on the words extracted from the entity descriptions. Therefore, to capture the contextual information of the textual entity description contextual NLM, is used to generate entity representations. This paper presents a framework named GRAND (Graph Walks for RDF2vec and Entity Descriptions), which exploits different variants of the RDF2vec model based on different graph walk strategies together with textual entity descriptions to predict the missing entity types in a KG. In this work, the entity typing problem is modelled as a classification problem. A flat and a hierarchical classification model are deployed on the top of the feature vectors generated from the aforementioned entity representations to predict the missing entity types. The empirical results based on the extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets FIGER 7 and DBpedia630k 9 show that the proposed approach is robust and outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Further experiments show that GRAND performs considerably well on unseen entities. The main contributions of this work are: A framework which leverages different graph walk strategies based RDF2vec models and a contextual NLM for textual entity descriptions is proposed to predict the missing entity types. A generalized classification framework consisting of three different modules namely multi-class, multi-label, and hierarchical classification is introduced to predict the missing entity types on different levels of granularity. It can be easily deployed for predicting entity types on entity representations from any KGs. Extensive experiments are conducted on the benchmark datasets to study the impact of several combinations of entity representations generated from the RDF2Vec variants and the NLM. An analysis on the weights in the classification has been conducted for analyzing which entity representations are suitable in which entity typing situations. Furthermore, the impact of dimensionality reduction of the entity representations on the local and global level using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is studied. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives an overview of the baseline approaches. Section 3 describes the proposed methodology, followed by experiments and results in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 provides the conclusion and an outlook of future work.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: are assigned to its subclasses.
