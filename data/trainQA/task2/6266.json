      "content": "Paper Title: Adversarial Attack Based on Prediction-Correction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAmong all gradient-based adversarial attacks, FGSM [ref]16 is the most classic one. The existing gradient-based attacks are based on the improvement of FGSM generally. For example, I-FGSM , MI-FGSM [ref]12, and NI-FGSM [ref]23 are three iterative variants. Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) [ref]16 generates adversarial example by calculating the gradient of the loss function and performs the one-step update as where ∇xLsubscript∇𝑥𝐿\\nabla_{x}L is the gradient of the loss function with respect to the original example x𝑥x, and s​i​g​n​(⋅)𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛⋅sign\\left(\\cdot\\right) denotes the sign function. Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (I-FGSM)  is an iterative attack based on FGSM. This method applies FGSM multiple times with a small step-size α𝛼\\alpha to generate adversarial example as follows. where x0a​d​v=xsuperscriptsubscript𝑥0𝑎𝑑𝑣𝑥x_{0}^{adv}=x, α=ϵ​/​T𝛼italic-ϵ/𝑇\\alpha={\\epsilon\\mathord{\\left/{\\vphantom{\\epsilon T}}\\right.\\kern-1.2pt}T}, T𝑇T represents the number of iterations, and c​l​i​pxϵ​{⋅}𝑐𝑙𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑝𝑥italic-ϵ⋅{clip}_{x}^{\\epsilon}\\left\\{\\cdot\\right\\} function indications that the generated adversarial example is clipped within the ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-ball of the original image. Momentum Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (MI-FGSM) [ref]12 introduces a momentum term into I-FGSM to stabilize the update directions of perturbations, which can be described as follows. where x0a​d​v=xsuperscriptsubscript𝑥0𝑎𝑑𝑣𝑥x_{0}^{adv}=x, g0=0subscript𝑔00g_{0}=0, gtsubscript𝑔𝑡g_{t} gathers the gradient information up to the t𝑡t-th iteration with a decay factor μ𝜇\\mu, and α𝛼\\alpha is a step-size. Nesterov Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (NI-FGSM) [ref]23 proposes to improve the transferability of adversarial example by integrating Nesterov accelerated gradient  into I-FGSM, which can be formalized as follows. where x0a​d​v=xsuperscriptsubscript𝑥0𝑎𝑑𝑣𝑥x_{0}^{adv}=x, g0=0subscript𝑔00g_{0}=0, and xtn​e​ssuperscriptsubscript𝑥𝑡𝑛𝑒𝑠x_{t}^{nes} is a state constructed using the previously accumulated gradient information.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: Among all gradient-based adversarial attacks, FGSM [ref]16 is the most classic one.
