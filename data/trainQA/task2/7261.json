Deploying ML models on MCUs leads to an emerging field TinyML  [ref]9 [ref]48 for useful applications, such as autonomous nano drone  and smart health bracelet . To support efficient model inference on MCUs, CMSIS-NN , microTVM , TinyEngine 0 and TensorFlow Lite Micro [ref]9 are proposed. Based on these commercial frameworks, recent works improve the performance of ML models on MCUs by recording operator execution to reduce memory consumption , intermittent model execution , model architecture search , etc. DTMM is a systematic solution to enable efficient local inference on MCUs. Model compression. There are existing studies to compress ML models on MCUs including knowledge distillation , low-rank factorization , and quantization [ref]15. They are orthogonal to DTMM and can be used simultaneously. For example, 8-bit quantization is currently used in DTMM (§IV). Another popular model compression technique on MCUs is pruning [ref]15 , which can be divided into structured and unstructured methods. Structured pruning removes model weights according to a given structure    , which might significantly reduce the model accuracy when the compression ratio is high on the MCU. Unstructured pruning 7 [ref]15 can retain the accuracy. However, models after pruning perform slowly due to the large overhead 2. Some research 4 proposes to group weights to form new pruning units, which can have different forms by applying different constraints 7 . Unlike existing works above that focus on the structural design of pruning units, DTMM can actually run ML models with discrete weights after pruning on MCUs. Other methods. In addition to model compression, there have been works proposed to deploy ML models on MCUs from other perspectives  5, where computation offloading is a typical example . However, offloading relies on extra infrastructure for support, such as edge or cloud, which is not conductive to large-scale deployment. In DTMM, we overcome the resource constraints of weak IoT devices to achieve fully autonomous operation and local inference.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: ML models on MCUs.
