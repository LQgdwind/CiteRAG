      "content": "Paper Title: NVC-Net: End-to-End Adversarial Voice Conversion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCurrent voice conversion methods resort to non-parallel training data due to the difficulties in collecting parallel training data. Many of them have been inspired by the recent advances in computer vision. For instance, Hsu et al. [ref]13 introduced a variational auto-encoder (VAE)-based voice conversion framework by conditioning the decoder on the speaker identity. As an extension, Kameoka et al. [ref]18 used an auxiliary classifier for VAEs forcing the converted audio to be correctly classified. Despite the success, it is well known that conditional VAEs have the limitation of generating over-smoothed audio. This can be problematic as the model may produce poor-quality audio . An appealing solution to solve this problem is based on GANs  since they do not make any explicit assumption about the data distribution. They learn to capture the distribution of real audio, making the generated audio sounding more natural 2  . First studies were based on CycleGAN   . The idea is to learn a mapping on acoustic features between the source and target speakers by combining the adversarial loss, cycle-consistency loss, and identity mapping loss. More recently, inspired by the work of Choi et al. , StarGAN-VC  and its improved version 2 showed very promising results for voice conversion. Hsu et al.  demonstrated that GANs could improve VAE-based models. However, despite the success in generating realistic images, building GANs to generate directly high-fidelity audio waveforms is a challenging task   . One reason is that audio are highly periodic and human ears are sensitive to discontinuities. Moreover, unlike images, audio often induce high temporal resolution requirements. In the context of voice conversion, we consider speech as a composition of speaker identity and linguistic content. Disentangling the speaker identity from the linguistic content allows to change the speaker identity independently. There have been several methods leveraging the latent representation of automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for voice conversion 9 2. An ASR model is used to extract the linguistic features from the source speech, then convert these features into a target speaker using another speaker-dependent model. These models can perform non-parallel voice conversion, but their performance highly depends on the accuracy of the ASR model. Other disentanglement techniques for voice conversion include autoencoder , vector quantization 9, and instance normalization . Many of the aforementioned approaches rely on the intermediate representation of speech, such as spectrograms and mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. Although they are capable of producing good perceptual-quality speech, some still need additional supervision to train a robust vocoder. There are only a few methods dealing with the raw audio waveform. For instance, Engel et al.  proposed a WaveNet-style autoencoder for converting audio between different instruments. More recently, Serrà et al. 0 introduced Blow, a normalizing flow network for voice conversion on raw audio signals. Flow-based models have the advantages of efficient sampling and exact likelihood computation, however, they are less expressive compared to autoregressive models.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: resort to non-parallel training data due to the difficulties in collecting parallel training data.
