      "content": "Paper Title: A Survey on Deep Learning-Based Monocular Spacecraft Pose Estimation: Current State, Limitations and Prospects\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this stage, the 2D projections of a set of predefined 3D keypoints are predicted from the cropped regions containing the spacecraft using a DL model (see Figure¬†5). The 3D keypoints are generally defined by the CAD model of the spacecraft. If the CAD model is not available, multiview triangulation (as in¬†[ref]24¬†¬†) or Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques¬† can be used for reconstructing a wireframe 3D model of the spacecraft containing the 3D keypoints. Regression of keypoint locations:\nA common method for predicting keypoints is to directly regress the keypoint locations. Huan et al.¬† uses a CNN regression model with an HRNet[ref]169 backbone for directly regressing the 2D keypoint locations as a 1√ó1√ó2‚ÄãM112ùëÄ1\\times 1\\times 2M vector, where MùëÄM is the number of keypoints. Park et al.¬† uses a YOLOv2 based architecture with a MobileNetv2 backbone with only 5.64M parameters for regressing keypoints. The lightweight nature of the model makes it suitable for deployment in space hardware or edge devices. Similarly, Lotti et al.¬† also propose a deployable CNN regression model for keypoint regression with EfficientNet-Lite backbone¬†, which is obtained by removing operations not well supported for mobile applications (deployment) from the original EfficientNets. Segmentation-driven approach:\nAlgorithms in¬†, and¬†[ref]75 follow the segmentation-driven approach from Hu et al.¬† for regressing the keypoint locations, with a dual-headed (segmentation and regression) network architecture and a shared backbone. The input image is divided into a grid and the segmentation head separates the foreground grid cells (containing the spacecraft) from the background. The regression head predicts the location of each keypoint as an offset from the centre of each of the grid cells. Only the predictions from foreground (spacecraft) grid cells contribute to the prediction of the keypoint location, making predictions more accurate. Additionally,¬†[ref]75 also presents different variants of the keypoint prediction model with a lower number of parameters making it suitable for deployment in space hardware. The model with the lowest number of parameters achieving sufficient keypoint prediction accuracy uses a¬†MobileNetv3 backbone that has only 7.8M parameters. Heatmap prediction:\nAnother method for keypoint prediction is to regress the heatmaps encoding probability of the keypoint locations. The pixel coordinates are then obtained by extracting locations with the highest probability from these heatmaps¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†. The ground truth heatmaps are generated as 2D normal distributions with means equal to the ground truth keypoint locations and unit standard deviations. HRNet¬†[ref]169 network architecture and its derivative, the HigherHRNet¬†, is used extensively for heatmap predictions in different algorithms. HRNet architectures maintain high-resolution feature maps throughout the network making it suitable for heatmap prediction tasks. UNet¬† architecture is also used for predicting keypoint heatmaps¬† (see Figure¬†7-A). Originally developed for image segmentation, UNet architecture consists of a sequence of downsampling layers (contracting path) that captures relevant semantic information. This is followed by symmetrical upsampling layers (expanding path) for precise location predictions. The use of skip connections in the architecture preserves spatial information during downsampling and subsequent upsampling. Huo et al.¬† presented a lightweight hybrid architecture for keypoint prediction combining a YOLO-like CNN spacecraft detector with a heatmap regression subnetwork (see Figure¬†7-B). Sharing the backbone network architecture between the object detection and the keypoint prediction brings down the total number of parameters to ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim.89M, making it suitable to deploy in resource-constrained space systems. Bounding box prediction: Recently, Li et al.¬† formulated keypoint prediction as a keypoint bounding box detection problem. Instead of predicting the keypoint locations or heatmaps, the enclosing bounding boxes over the keypoints are predicted along with the confidence scores. Authors used CSPDarknet¬† CNN backbone with a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)¬† for multi-scale feature extraction, followed by a detection head for the keypoint bounding box detection (see Figure¬†7-C). A similar method is also used in¬†. Here, a counterfactual analysis¬† framework is used to generate the FPN, which is then fed to the keypoint detector.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: the spacecraft using a DL model (see Figure¬†5). The 3D keypoints are generally defined by the CAD model of the spacecraft. If the CAD model is not available, multiview triangulation (as in¬†[ref]24¬†¬†) or Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques¬† can be used for reconstructing a wireframe 3D model of the spacecraft containing the 3D keypoints.
