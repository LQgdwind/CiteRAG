      "content": "Paper Title: BundleTrack: 6D Pose Tracking for Novel Objects without Instance or Category-Level 3D Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRobot manipulation often requires information about the pose of the manipulated object. In some cases, this can be achieved through forward kinematics (FK), assuming the object’s motion equivalent to the end-effector’s motion. Frequently, however, FK is insufficient to accurately estimate the object’s pose . This can be due to slippage during grasping or in-hand manipulation , or during handoffs or due to the compliance of a suction cup (Fig. 1). In these cases, dynamically estimating an object’s pose from visual data is desirable. Single-image 6D pose estimation methods have been studied extensively [ref]3    . Some of them are fast and can re-estimate poses from scratch for every new frame  [ref]9. Nevertheless, this is redundant, less efficient, leading to less coherent estimations over consecutive frames and negatively impacts planning and control. On the other hand, given an initial pose estimate, tracking 6D object poses over image sequences can improve estimation speed while providing coherent and accurate poses by leveraging temporal consistency 0 1 2. Most existing 6D object pose estimation or tracking approaches assume access to an object instance’s 3D model [ref]3 [ref]9. Having access to such instance 3D models complicates generalization to novel, unseen instances. To overcome this limitation, recent efforts have relaxed this assumption and require only category-level 3D models for 6D pose estimation 3 4 5 6 or tracking 7. They often achieve this by training over a large number of CAD models from the same category. While promising results have been demonstrated for previously seen object categories, there are still limitations. These methods are constrained by the variety of categories in the training database. Popular 3D model databases, such as ShapeNet 8 and ModelNet40 9, contain 55 and 40 categories respectively. This is still far from sufficient to cover diverse object categories present in the real world. Furthermore, 3D model databases often require nontrivial manual effort and expert domain knowledge to build, involving steps such as scanning 0, mesh refinement 1 or CAD design. Another line of work from the SLAM literature has moved to address dynamic, object-aware challenges 3 4 5 6, where dynamic objects are being reconstructed on-the-fly while being tracked without the need for object 3D models beforehand. However, tracking-via-reconstruction 6 4 tends to accumulate errors when fusing observations with erroneous pose estimates into the global model. These errors adversely impact model tracking in subsequent frames. Motivated by the above limitations, this work aims for accurate, robust 6D pose tracking that is generalizable to novel objects without instance or category-level 3D models. It exploits recent advances in video segmentation as well as learning-based keypoint detection and matching for a coarse pose estimate, followed by a memory-augmented pose-graph optimization step to achieve spatiotemporal consistent pose output. Instead of aggregating into a global model, representative historical observations are maintained as keyframes in a memory pool, providing candidate nodes for future graphs so as to enable multi-pair data association together with the latest observation. An efficient implementation of this framework in CUDA allows to achieve competitive running times. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two large-scale public benchmarks, shown in Fig. 1. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate a significant improvement over existing state-of-art approaches, including methods using instance or category-level 3D models or SLAM-like methods. In summary, this work’s contributions are the following: 1) A novel integration of methods that result in a 6D pose tracking framework that generalizes to novel objects without access to instance or category-level 3D models. 2) A memory-augmented pose graph optimization for low-drift accurate 6D object pose tracking. In particular, augmenting the memory pool with historical observations enables multi-hop data association and ameliorate the dearth of correspondences between a pair of consecutive frames. Additionally, maintaining keyframes as raw nodes instead of aggregating into a global model significantly reduces tracking drift. 3) An efficient CUDA implementation, which allows to execute online the computationally-heavy multi-pair feature matching as well as pose-graph optimization for 6D object pose tracking (for the first time to the best of the authors’ knowledge). These contributions result in a new state-of-art performance by boosting the previous best accuracy from 33.3% to 87.4% under the “5°5cm” metric in the NOCS Dataset 3, even when compared against approaches utilizing category-level 3D models for training. They also result in comparable performance on the YCBInEOAT dataset 2, even when compared against approaches utilizing instance-level 3D models 2.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: the compliance of a suction cup (Fig. 1).
