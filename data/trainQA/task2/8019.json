      "content": "Paper Title: Neural networks for bifurcation and linear stability analysis of steady states in partial differential equations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMachine learning or neural networks for approximating solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) began in the 1990s.\nSome of the earliest studies on this approach were due to Dissanayake et al.  and Lagaris et al. . They used neural networks, collocation points, and finite difference formulas to transform PDEs into unconstrained optimization problems and solved them using a quasi-Newton method.\nThe well-known theory about universal function approximators explained by Hornik et al. [ref]3 supports neural networks’ success. The neural network approach offers several advantages over traditional methods like finite difference methods.\nFirst, neural networks provide explicit approximate solutions, allowing the value at any point to be calculated straightforwardly without interpolation . Additionally, neural networks support mesh-free or non-uniform grids or collocation points.\nMoreover, since neural networks yield explicit approximate solutions, exact derivatives can be obtained through automatic differentiation [ref]4. Alternatively, finite difference formulas can still be used with higher accuracy for derivative calculations.\nDeep neural networks are particularly adept at handling high-dimensional PDEs [ref]5 . On the other hand, traditional numerical methods often struggle with high-dimensional PDEs due to the exponential increase in computational complexity and memory requirements, a challenge known as the curse of dimensionality. Research using machine learning and neural networks to solve PDEs has significantly increased recently.\nPhysics-informed neural networks (PINNs) proposed by Raissi et al.  are currently one of the most popular research in this field. It is a framework based on deep neural networks that can address direct and inverse problems related to nonlinear PDEs. They implemented the framework to deal with the Schrödinger and the Allen-Cahn equations. However, although they explained PINNs with several new concepts, some parts also have similarities with the method proposed by Dissanayake et al. .\nPINNs have been used in various areas, including fluid mechanics , power systems , optics and metamaterials 0 1, finance 2, subsurface transport 3, continuum micromechanics 4, and supersonic flows 5.\nIn addition, Lu et al. 6 introduced DeepXDE, a Python library designed for PINNs, offering customization and user-friendliness. Additionally, they proposed a novel residual-based adaptive refinement technique to enhance the training efficiency of PINNs.\nA work proposed by Meer et al. 7 can be used to determine better parameters for weighted loss functions to enhance the accuracy of neural networks for solving PDEs.\nRodriguez-Torrado et al. 8 introduced a novel network architecture called physics-informed attention-based neural networks (PIANNs). PIANNs combine the capabilities of recurrent neural networks and attention mechanisms to capture the extreme dynamics of nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs effectively.\nYang et al. 9 introduced a novel approach called Bayesian physics-informed neural network (B-PINN) for solving PDEs. In B-PINN, a combination of a Bayesian neural network and a PINN is employed as the prior. At the same time, the posterior can be estimated using either Hamiltonian Monte Carlo or variational inference methods.\nHan et al. 0 [ref]5 used a unique and parallel deep learning architecture for solving high-dimensional PDEs by reformulating the equations as backward stochastic differential equations 1. It was then used to tackle the nonlinear Black-Scholes equation and the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation . Furthermore, a review to examine the current trends in integrating physics with machine learning, outlining their existing capabilities and limitations, is given by Karniadakis et al. 2. The advancement of neural networks and deep learning is further facilitated by the availability of specialized hardware and software tools, like Matlab with its deep learning toolbox and TensorFlow 3 with Keras 4 5. Despite the significant interest in applying machine learning to PDEs, researchers still underexplore some areas. One such area is the construction of bifurcation diagrams, which are crucial for understanding the behavior of solutions in parameterized PDEs. Fabiani et al. 6 addressed this by using extreme learning machines to construct bifurcation diagrams for the Bratu equation. However, their method did not produce a complete bifurcation diagram for the two-dimensional Bratu equation. Additionally, there is research on using neural networks to effectively track the evolution of bifurcating phenomena in computational fluid dynamics problems using a Reduced Order Models method 7, which differs from our proposed approach. Another area that can be further explored is machine learning for solving eigenvalue problems and, furthermore, for linear stability analysis. While several studies have addressed eigenvalue problems, none applied their concepts to linear stability analysis. One existing research, proposed by Ben-Shaul et al. 8, utilized deep learning for solving eigenvalue problems with only positive eigenvalues, which may not be applicable to linear stability analysis. Yang et al. 9 employed neural networks based on power methods for solving linear eigenvalue problems, which differs from our proposed approach. Other research   discussed eigenvalue problems related to stochastic differential equations, allowing for solutions using deep learning proposed by Han et al. [ref]5. However, this method is also not applicable to general eigenvalue problems. To address this gap, we plan to combine neural networks with a pseudo-arclength continuation to construct bifurcation diagrams. Additionally, we aim to explore the application of machine learning in linear stability analysis. Our approach involves utilizing neural networks to solve the associated eigenvalue problems of the PDEs, focusing on identifying the largest eigenvalue.\nTo validate our proposed method, we will conduct experiments using the one- and two-dimensional Bratu equations   and the one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation . This paper is organized as follows.\nSection 2 presents the Bratu equation and the viscous Burgers equation and their eigenvalue problems.\nSection 3 shows the finite difference method for solving the Bratu equation and the viscous Burgers equation.\nSection 4 discusses the formulation of neural networks for bifurcation and linear stability analysis.\nExperimental results and discussions are provided in Section 5 and the conclusion is given in Section 6.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: to transform PDEs into unconstrained optimization problems and solved them using a quasi-Newton method.\nThe well-known theory about universal function approximators explained by Hornik et al. [ref]3 supports neural networks’ success.
