For the purpose of Open Access, the authors have applied a CC BY public copyright licence to any Author Accepted Manuscript version arising from this submission. All data is provided in full in the results section of this paper.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe initiate a systematic investigation of promise maximum colouring, i.e., k𝑘k- vs. ℓℓ\\ell-colourings.\nAs our first result, we extend the algorithm of Frieze and Jerrum [FJ97] to\nwork for k𝑘k- vs. ℓℓ\\ell-colourings. We analyse the power of the algorithm in two cases: for k=2,ℓ=3formulae-sequence𝑘2ℓ3k=2,\\ell=3, and for k≤ℓ𝑘ℓk\\leq\\ell as k,ℓ→∞→𝑘ℓk,\\ell\\to\\infty.\nFor the case k=2𝑘2k=2 one gets the best possible scenario:\nThere is an efficient approximation algorithm with approximation factor\nα=1𝛼1\\alpha=1\nalready for 333-colourings (and thus also for ℓℓ\\ell-colourings for any ℓ≥3ℓ3\\ell\\geq 3). In particular, we will show the following result. There is a randomised algorithm which, given a graph G𝐺G\nthat admits a k𝑘k-colouring of value ρ𝜌\\rho and a real number ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, finds an ℓℓ\\ell-colouring of expected\nvalue αk​ℓ​ρ−εsubscript𝛼𝑘ℓ𝜌𝜀\\alpha_{k\\ell}\\rho-\\varepsilon in polynomial time in G𝐺G and log⁡(1/ε)1𝜀\\log(1/\\varepsilon). In particular, For k=2,ℓ=3formulae-sequence𝑘2ℓ3k=2,\\ell=3, we have α2,3=1subscript𝛼231\\alpha_{2,3}=1. We have that\nαk​ℓ≥1−1ℓ+2​ln⁡ℓk​ℓ−o​(ln⁡ℓk​ℓ)−O​(1k2)subscript𝛼𝑘ℓ11ℓ2ℓ𝑘ℓ𝑜ℓ𝑘ℓ𝑂1superscript𝑘2\\displaystyle\\alpha_{k\\ell}\\geq 1-\\frac{1}{\\ell}+\\frac{2\\ln\\ell}{k\\ell}-o\\left(\\frac{\\ln\\ell}{k\\ell}\\right)-O\\left(\\frac{1}{k^{2}}\\right). Furthermore, αk​ℓ>1−1/ℓsubscript𝛼𝑘ℓ11ℓ\\alpha_{k\\ell}>1-1/\\ell,\nhence the algorithm is better than random guessing for ρ𝜌\\rho near 1.333The o​(⋅),O​(⋅)𝑜⋅𝑂⋅o(\\cdot),O(\\cdot) notation hides only terms and factors dependant on k,ℓ𝑘ℓk,\\ell, not on ε𝜀\\varepsilon. For illustration, we tabulated numerical approximate values for αk​ℓsubscript𝛼𝑘ℓ\\alpha_{k\\ell} in Table 1\non page 1.444The exact definition of αk​ℓsubscript𝛼𝑘ℓ\\alpha_{k\\ell} is given in Definition 7. The probabilities Pℓ​(a)subscript𝑃ℓ𝑎P_{\\ell}(a) that appear in that definition were computed using the methods and R library from [AG18]. Our algorithm solves the Frieze-Jerrum SDP for k𝑘k-colourings, then rounds like Frieze and Jerrum do for ℓℓ\\ell-colourings [FJ97]. For 222- vs. 333-colourings our analysis begins much like, but is simpler than that of Frieze and Jerrum, because we only care about the case where we get 3 colours; in particular, we establish a closed form for the probability that a pair of vectors is cut properly using the results of Cheng [Che68, Che69]. For k𝑘k- vs. ℓℓ\\ell-colourings, we largely follow the analysis from [FJ97]. We will also show how to derandomise our algorithm. Fix 2≤k≤ℓ2𝑘ℓ2\\leq k\\leq\\ell and let αk​ℓsubscript𝛼𝑘ℓ\\alpha_{k\\ell} be as in Theorem 1.\nThere is a deterministic algorithm which, given a graph G𝐺G that admits a\nk𝑘k-colouring of value ρ𝜌\\rho\nand a real number ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, finds an ℓℓ\\ell-colouring of value αk​ℓ​ρ−εsubscript𝛼𝑘ℓ𝜌𝜀\\alpha_{k\\ell}\\rho-\\varepsilon in polynomial time in G𝐺G and 1/ε1𝜀1/\\varepsilon. The proof of Theorem 2\nuses the method of conditional expectation; however our\nmethod is conceptually simpler (if less efficient) than previous ones: to compute our conditional probabilities, we approximate the normal distribution with a normalised binomial distribution. Moreover, our method explicitly works not only for the rounding scheme in our algorithm but also in the rounding scheme of Frieze and Jerrum [FJ97] (which we use), in contrast to previous work that did not explicitly handle this rounding scheme [MR99, EIO02, BK05, GOWZ10]; cf. Section 4\nand the discussion therein\nfor details.\nTheorem 2 implies the following\ncorollary for k=2,ℓ=3formulae-sequence𝑘2ℓ3k=2,\\ell=3, which eliminates any dependence on ε𝜀\\varepsilon. There is a deterministic algorithm which, given a graph G𝐺G that admits a 2-colouring of value ρ𝜌\\rho, finds a 3-colouring of value ρ𝜌\\rho in polynomial time in G𝐺G. By Theorems 1\nand 2,\nthere exists an algorithm which, if given a graph G𝐺G that admits a\n2-colouring of value ρ𝜌\\rho, will find a 3-colouring of value ρ−ε𝜌𝜀\\rho-\\varepsilon in polynomial time in G𝐺G and 1/ε1𝜀1/\\varepsilon. Note that the value\nof any colouring is of the form k/m𝑘𝑚k/m, where m𝑚m is the number of edges\nof G𝐺G; in particular suppose ρ=k/m𝜌𝑘𝑚\\rho=k/m. Set ε=1/2​m𝜀12𝑚\\varepsilon=1/2m and\nnote that the algorithm returns a 3-colouring of value at least k/m−1/2​m𝑘𝑚12𝑚k/m-1/2m; since the value of the returned colouring is of the form k′/msuperscript𝑘′𝑚k^{\\prime}/m, it must be at least k/m𝑘𝑚k/m as required.\n∎ The algorithm from Theorem 2 has good performance when both k𝑘k and ℓℓ\\ell grow large. What if k𝑘k is fixed and only ℓℓ\\ell grows large? We give an algorithm that has good performance in this case as well.\nThe idea is based on an algorithm of Karger, Motwani and Sudan for approximate graph colouring [KMS98, Section 6], but rather than cutting by Θ​(log⁡(n))Θ𝑛\\Theta(\\log(n)) random hyperplanes we cut with ⌊log2⁡(ℓ)⌋subscript2ℓ\\lfloor\\log_{2}(\\ell)\\rfloor hyperplanes. Let k>2𝑘2k>2 be fixed555The case k=2,ℓ≥2formulae-sequence𝑘2ℓ2k=2,\\ell\\geq 2 is covered by Theorem 2. and ℓ≥kℓ𝑘\\ell\\geq k be large. There is a deterministic algorithm which, given a graph G𝐺G that admits a k𝑘k-colouring of value ρ𝜌\\rho and a real number ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, finds an ℓℓ\\ell-colouring of G𝐺G of value αk​ℓ′​ρ−εsuperscriptsubscript𝛼𝑘ℓ′𝜌𝜀\\alpha_{k\\ell}^{\\prime}\\rho-\\varepsilon in polynomial time in G𝐺G and 1/ε1𝜀1/\\varepsilon. In particular, for a fixed k𝑘k there exists a constant uk>1subscript𝑢𝑘1u_{k}>1 such that which is\n1−o​(1/ℓ)1𝑜1ℓ1-o(1/\\ell)\nwhen ℓℓ\\ell grows large.666For example, for k=3𝑘3k=3 we have uk=2subscript𝑢𝑘2u_{k}=2 and the approximation ratio is 1−O​(1/ℓ2)1𝑂1superscriptℓ21-O(1/\\ell^{2}). This is significantly better, for large ℓℓ\\ell, than the random guessing algorithm which has performance 1−1/ℓ11ℓ1-1/\\ell. Of course, by running the algorithms of Theorem 2 and Theorem 4 in parallel and then taking the better of the two results, we can get an algorithm that is at least as good as either of them. Using the framework of Khot, Kindler, Mossel, and O’Donnel [KKMO07], we\nwill show that,\nunder the UGC,\nit is \\NP-hard to beat the approximation guarantee of our algorithm from Theorem 2 by more than a constant that grows small for any large k,ℓ𝑘ℓk,\\ell with k≤ℓ𝑘ℓk\\leq\\ell and ℓℓ\\ell bounded by a function that is o​(ek3)𝑜superscript𝑒3𝑘o(e^{\\sqrt[ref]3{k}}). We combine this with the methods of Guruswami and Sinop [GS13]777The results of [GS13] were, at the time, conditional on the 2-to-1 conjecture of Khot [Kho02]; however this has recently been proved by Khot, Minzer and Safra [KMS23].\nto also find some weaker (non-tight) unconditional results.888We thank Venkat Guruswami for bringing [GS13] to our attention. We will present a unified version of these proofs, using ideas from the work of Dinur, Mossel and Regev [DMR06] (on which [GS13] also draws). The way the unification of these two proofs works out is also similar to the work of Guruswami and Sandeep [GS20]. Fix some function M​(k)=o​(ek3)𝑀𝑘𝑜superscript𝑒3𝑘M(k)=o(e^{\\sqrt[ref]3{k}}).\nLet 2≤k≤ℓ2𝑘ℓ2\\leq k\\leq\\ell be such that ℓ≤M​(k)ℓ𝑀𝑘\\ell\\leq M(k). For any small enough ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, consider the problem of deciding whether a given graph G𝐺G admits a k𝑘k-colouring of value 1−ε1𝜀1-\\varepsilon, or not even an ℓℓ\\ell-colouring of value β+ε𝛽𝜀\\beta+\\varepsilon. We have the following. Assuming the UGC, the problem is \\NP-hard for β=βk​ℓ=1−1ℓ+2​ln⁡ℓk​ℓ+o​(ln⁡ℓk​ℓ)𝛽subscript𝛽𝑘ℓ11ℓ2ℓ𝑘ℓ𝑜ℓ𝑘ℓ\\displaystyle\\beta=\\beta_{k\\ell}=1-\\frac{1}{\\ell}+\\frac{2\\ln\\ell}{k\\ell}+o\\left(\\frac{\\ln\\ell}{k\\ell}\\right). Unconditionally, the problem is \\NP-hard for β=βk​ℓ′=1−1ℓ+8​ln⁡ℓk​ℓ+o​(ln⁡ℓk​ℓ)𝛽superscriptsubscript𝛽𝑘ℓ′11ℓ8ℓ𝑘ℓ𝑜ℓ𝑘ℓ\\displaystyle\\beta=\\beta_{k\\ell}^{\\prime}=1-\\frac{1}{\\ell}+\\frac{8\\ln\\ell}{k\\ell}+o\\left(\\frac{\\ln\\ell}{k\\ell}\\right). Both of these results only hold when βk​ℓ,βk​ℓ′∈(0,1)subscript𝛽𝑘ℓsubscriptsuperscript𝛽′𝑘ℓ01\\beta_{k\\ell},\\beta^{\\prime}_{k\\ell}\\in(0,1).999The constants hidden in the\nexpression defining βk​ℓsubscript𝛽𝑘ℓ\\beta_{k\\ell} depend on M​(k),k,ℓ𝑀𝑘𝑘ℓM(k),k,\\ell, but not on ε𝜀\\varepsilon. The \\NP-hardness bound in Theorem 5 is limited due to the fact that, for a fixed k𝑘k, we cannot have ℓℓ\\ell arbitrarily large. This is intrinsic to the expression above: for a large ℓℓ\\ell and a fixed k𝑘k we have βk​ℓ>1subscript𝛽𝑘ℓ1\\beta_{k\\ell}>1. Moreover, any \\NP-hardness bound for a fixed k𝑘k and a large ℓℓ\\ell must take into account the algorithm with approximation ratio 1−o​(1/ℓ)1𝑜1ℓ1-o(1/\\ell) we gave in Theorem 4.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: of our algorithm from Theorem 2 by more than a constant that grows small for any large k,ℓ𝑘ℓk,\\ell with k≤ℓ𝑘ℓk\\leq\\ell and ℓℓ\\ell bounded by a function that is o​(ek3)𝑜superscript𝑒3𝑘o(e^{\\sqrt[ref]3{k}}).
