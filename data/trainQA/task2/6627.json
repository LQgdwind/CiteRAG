      "content": "Paper Title: An Alternative to Variance: Gini Deviation for Risk-averse Policy Gradient\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMethods proposed by   [ref]12 consider the problem\n where ξ𝜉\\xi indicates the user’s tolerance of the variance. Using the Lagrangian relaxation procedure , we can transform it to the following unconstrained optimization problem: maxπ⁡𝔼​[G0]−λ​𝕍​[G0]subscript𝜋𝔼delimited-[]subscript𝐺0𝜆𝕍delimited-[]subscript𝐺0\\max_{\\pi}\\mathbb{E}[G_{0}]-\\lambda\\mathbb{V}[G_{0}], where λ𝜆\\lambda is a trade-off hyper-parameter. Note that the mean-variance objective is in general NP-hard  to optimize. The main reason is that although variance satisfies a Bellman equation, it lacks the monotonicity of dynamic programming [ref]20. Double Sampling in total return variance. We first show how to solve unconstrained mean-variance RL via vanilla stochastic gradient. Suppose the policy is parameterized by θ𝜃\\theta, define J​(θ)=𝔼π​[G0]𝐽𝜃subscript𝔼𝜋delimited-[]subscript𝐺0J(\\theta)=\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}[G_{0}] and M​(θ):=𝔼π​[(∑t=0∞γt​R​(St,At))2]assign𝑀𝜃subscript𝔼𝜋delimited-[]superscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝑡0superscript𝛾𝑡𝑅subscript𝑆𝑡subscript𝐴𝑡2M(\\theta):=\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\big{[}(\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\gamma^{t}R(S_{t},A_{t}))^{2}\\big{]}, then 𝕍​[G0]=M​(θ)−J2​(θ)𝕍delimited-[]subscript𝐺0𝑀𝜃superscript𝐽2𝜃\\mathbb{V}[G_{0}]=M(\\theta)-J^{2}(\\theta). The unconstrained mean-variance objective is equivalent to Jλ​(θ)=J​(θ)−λ​(M​(θ)−J2​(θ))subscript𝐽𝜆𝜃𝐽𝜃𝜆𝑀𝜃superscript𝐽2𝜃J_{\\lambda}(\\theta)=J(\\theta)-\\lambda\\big{(}M(\\theta)-J^{2}(\\theta)\\big{)}, whose gradient is\n The unbiased estimates for ∇θJ​(θ)subscript∇𝜃𝐽𝜃\\nabla_{\\theta}J(\\theta) and ∇θM​(θ)subscript∇𝜃𝑀𝜃\\nabla_{\\theta}M(\\theta) can be estimated by approximating the expectations over trajectories by using a single set of trajectories, i.e., ∇θJ​(θ)=𝔼τ​[Rτ​ωτ​(θ)]subscript∇𝜃𝐽𝜃subscript𝔼𝜏delimited-[]subscript𝑅𝜏subscript𝜔𝜏𝜃\\nabla_{\\theta}J(\\theta)=\\mathbb{E}_{\\tau}[R_{\\tau}\\omega_{\\tau}(\\theta)] and ∇θM​(θ)=𝔼τ​[Rτ2​ωτ​(θ)]subscript∇𝜃𝑀𝜃subscript𝔼𝜏delimited-[]superscriptsubscript𝑅𝜏2subscript𝜔𝜏𝜃\\nabla_{\\theta}M(\\theta)=\\mathbb{E}_{\\tau}[R_{\\tau}^{2}\\omega_{\\tau}(\\theta)], where Rτsubscript𝑅𝜏R_{\\tau} is the return of trajectory τ𝜏\\tau and ωτ​(θ)=∑t∇θlog⁡πθ​(at|st)subscript𝜔𝜏𝜃subscript𝑡subscript∇𝜃subscript𝜋𝜃conditionalsubscript𝑎𝑡subscript𝑠𝑡\\omega_{\\tau}(\\theta)=\\sum_{t}\\nabla_{\\theta}\\log\\pi_{\\theta}(a_{t}|s_{t}). In contrast, computing an unbiased estimate for J​(θ)​∇θJ​(θ)𝐽𝜃subscript∇𝜃𝐽𝜃J(\\theta)\\nabla_{\\theta}J(\\theta) requires two distinct sets of trajectories to estimate J​(θ)𝐽𝜃J(\\theta) and ∇θJ​(θ)subscript∇𝜃𝐽𝜃\\nabla_{\\theta}J(\\theta) separately, which is known as double sampling. Remark. Some work claims that double sampling cannot be implemented without having access to a generative model of the environment that allows users to sample at least two next states [ref]12. This is, however, not an issue in our setting where we allow sampling multiple trajectories. As long as we get enough trajectories, estimating J​(θ)​∇θJ​(θ)𝐽𝜃subscript∇𝜃𝐽𝜃J(\\theta)\\nabla_{\\theta}J(\\theta) is possible. Still, different methods were proposed to avoid this double sampling for faster learning. Specifically,  considers the setting γ=1𝛾1\\gamma=1 and considers an unconstrained problem: maxθ⁡L1​(θ)=𝔼​[G0]−λ​g​(𝕍​[G0]−ξ)subscript𝜃subscript𝐿1𝜃𝔼delimited-[]subscript𝐺0𝜆𝑔𝕍delimited-[]subscript𝐺0𝜉\\max_{\\theta}L_{1}(\\theta)=\\mathbb{E}[G_{0}]-\\lambda g\\big{(}\\mathbb{V}[G_{0}]-\\xi\\big{)}, where λ>0𝜆0\\lambda>0 is a tunable hyper-parameter, and penalty function g​(x)=(max⁡{0,x})2𝑔𝑥superscript0𝑥2g(x)=(\\max\\{0,x\\})^{2}. This method produces faster estimates for 𝔼​[G0]𝔼delimited-[]subscript𝐺0\\mathbb{E}[G_{0}] and 𝕍​[G0]𝕍delimited-[]subscript𝐺0\\mathbb{V}[G_{0}] and a slower updating for θ𝜃\\theta at each episode, which yields a two-time scale algorithm.  considers the setting γ<1𝛾1\\gamma<1 and converts Formula 1 into an unconstrained saddle-point problem: maxλ⁡minθ⁡L2​(θ,λ)=−𝔼​[G0]+λ​(𝕍​[G0]−ξ)subscript𝜆subscript𝜃subscript𝐿2𝜃𝜆𝔼delimited-[]subscript𝐺0𝜆𝕍delimited-[]subscript𝐺0𝜉\\max_{\\lambda}\\min_{\\theta}L_{2}(\\theta,\\lambda)=-\\mathbb{E}[G_{0}]+\\lambda\\big{(}\\mathbb{V}[G_{0}]-\\xi\\big{)}, where λ𝜆\\lambda is the dual variable. This approach uses perturbation method and smoothed function method to compute the gradient of value functions with respect to policy parameters. [ref]12 considers the setting γ=1𝛾1\\gamma=1, and introduces Fenchel duality x2=maxy⁡(2​x​y−y2)superscript𝑥2subscript𝑦2𝑥𝑦superscript𝑦2x^{2}=\\max_{y}(2xy-y^{2}) to avoid the term J​(θ)​∇θJ​(θ)𝐽𝜃subscript∇𝜃𝐽𝜃J(\\theta)\\nabla_{\\theta}J(\\theta) in the gradient. The original problem is then transformed into maxθ,y⁡L3​(θ,y)=2​y​(𝔼​[G0]+12​λ)−y2−𝔼​[G02]subscript𝜃𝑦subscript𝐿3𝜃𝑦2𝑦𝔼delimited-[]subscript𝐺012𝜆superscript𝑦2𝔼delimited-[]subscriptsuperscript𝐺20\\max_{\\theta,y}L_{3}(\\theta,y)=2y\\big{(}\\mathbb{E}[G_{0}]+\\frac{1}{2\\lambda}\\big{)}-y^{2}-\\mathbb{E}[G^{2}_{0}], where y𝑦y is the dual variable. Limitations of Total Return Variance. The presence of the square term Rτ2superscriptsubscript𝑅𝜏2R_{\\tau}^{2} in the mean-variance gradient ∇θM​(θ)=𝔼τ​[Rτ2​ωτ​(θ)]subscript∇𝜃𝑀𝜃subscript𝔼𝜏delimited-[]subscriptsuperscript𝑅2𝜏subscript𝜔𝜏𝜃\\nabla_{\\theta}M(\\theta)=\\mathbb{E}_{\\tau}[R^{2}_{\\tau}\\omega_{\\tau}(\\theta)](Equation 2) makes the gradient estimate sensitive to the numerical scale of the return, as empirically verified later. This issue is inherent in all methods that require computing ∇θ𝔼​[G02]subscript∇𝜃𝔼delimited-[]superscriptsubscript𝐺02\\nabla_{\\theta}\\mathbb{E}[G_{0}^{2}]. Users can not simply scale the reward by a small factor to reduce the magnitude of Rτ2superscriptsubscript𝑅𝜏2R_{\\tau}^{2}, since when scaling reward by a factor c𝑐c, 𝔼​[G0]𝔼delimited-[]subscript𝐺0\\mathbb{E}[G_{0}] is scaled by c𝑐c but 𝕍​[G0]𝕍delimited-[]subscript𝐺0\\mathbb{V}[G_{0}] is scaled by c2superscript𝑐2c^{2}. Consequently, scaling the reward may lead to different optimal policies being obtained.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: Methods proposed by   [ref]12 consider the problem\n where ξ𝜉\\xi indicates the user’s tolerance of the variance.
