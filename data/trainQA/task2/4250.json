      "content": "Paper Title: Spherical Channels for Modeling Atomic Interactions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMolecular and atomic property prediction has made significant recent progress. Models relying on hand-crafted representations like Behler-Parrinello[ref]4 and sGDML[ref]8 have recently been surpassed by learned feature representations using GNNs   4 6. Early GNN developments focused only on invariant representations. CGCNN and SchNet5 make energy and force estimations using only atomic species and pair-wise distance information. DimeNet , SphereNet, and GemNet4  extend this to explicitly capture triplet and quadruplet angles, which are scalars. Utilizing invariant representations offers flexibility in model architecture design since the node or edge features are inherently invariant and model constraints are not needed to maintain equivariance. The enumeration of triplets and quadruplets of atoms to calculate functions of relative or dihedral angles requires careful model design to maintain efficiency. More recently, equivariant models, capturing both scalar and equivariant features, have outperformed traditional GNNs on small molecular datasets including MD17 and QM92. While not strictly equivariant, our work falls into this later class of GNNs for atomic property predictions. Models that strictly enforce equivariance to the SO(3) (3D rotations) or E(3) group (3D rigid transformations) share similarities to our use of spherical channels 6    . Both represent atoms by higher-order tensors and not just scalar information. For instance, Tensor Field Networks , Cormorant , NequIP , SEGNN  and BOTNet  use the same spherical harmonic representations as SCNs, while PaiNN 6 is an l=1ùëô1l=1 variation. All models place constraints on the operations that can be performed to ensure equivarance, such as restricting non-linear operators to invariant scalar inputs, e.g., pair-wise atom distances. In networks like TFN, geometric information of higher degree lùëôl are mixed into the l=0ùëô0l=0 features via tensor products on which a gated non-linear function is applied. Similar to our approach, the recently proposed SEGNN uses the spherical harmonic representation to enable steerable features based on edge orientations. SEGNN introduces steerable MLPs that enforce equivariance by restricting the learnable parameters to those that scale the Clebsch-Gordan tensor products followed by gated non-linearities . In our approach, we increase the expressivity of the model by identifying a set of m=0ùëö0m=0 coefficients across degrees lùëôl that are invariant to rotations given an edge‚Äôs orientation to which unconstrained functions may be applied. We also demonstrate that improved performance can be achieved by relaxing the requirement for strict message equivariance by including a broader set of coefficients beyond m=0ùëö0m=0. Furthermore, we project the spherical channels onto a grid and perform a pointwise 1√ó1111\\times 1 convolution followed by a non-linearity. Although not strictly equivariant, the pointwise operation allows for complex mixing of different degrees of spherical harmonics resulting in rich geometric descriptions. Perhaps as a result of the network‚Äôs increased expessivity, we see an increase in accuracy with higher degrees (L=4,6,8ùêø468L=4,6,8) unlike previous approaches that typically use L=1ùêø1L=1 or L=2ùêø2L=2.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Molecular and atomic property prediction has made significant recent progress.
