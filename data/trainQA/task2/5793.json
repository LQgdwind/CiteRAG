Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Paco: Provocation Involving Action, Culture, and Oppression\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn India, most people identify themselves with a religion, leading to two main groups: Hindus and Muslims, who form 79% and 13% of Indians, respectively . However, the same identifying attribute, religion, is often misused to provoke these groups against each other [ref]33. In psychology, provocation is considered antecedent to aggression and violence  . Hence, in our setting, we define provoking sentences as those that either make the readers angry (at a religious group) or urge them to take any action (against that religious group). Saha et al.  curate a dataset of WhatsApp posts that instill fear of Indian Muslims in the mind of readers. Our investigation found that such fearful posts also contain provoking sentences against the same religious group. Example 1 shows one such WhatsApp post. The sentence colored blue may instill fear among the readers, especially among citizens of the mentioned states due to the possible Islamic acquisition. Whereas, its subsequent sentences (colored red) typecast Muslims and can make the readers angry at them. The readers of such posts can be Muslims themselves but the readers who are provoked belong to other religious groups. [htb] Example 1: Provocation accompanied with fear\n\n\n“Leave chatting and read this post or else all your life will be left in chatting. In 1378, a part was separated from India, became an Islamic nation - named Iran …and now Uttar Pradesh, Assam and Kerala are on the verge of becoming an Islamic state …People who do love jihad is a Muslim. Those who think of ruining the country - Every single one of them is a Muslim !!!! Everyone who does not share this message forward should be a Muslim. …”\n Our manual investigation of WhatsApp posts reveals the following three types of provoking sentences: Sentences that can make readers annoyed at a religion’s scriptures, religious practices, or religious leaders fall in this category. Moreover, the sentences stereotyping all people of that religion are also considered relevant. Sentences highlighting past misdeeds (either real incidents or fake) of a religious group, such as its violence, domination, or superiority over others. Sentences that urge its readers to act against a religious group. Such actions include violence, discriminating against people of that religion, or boycotting that religious group or their monuments. [htb] Example 2: Categories of provoking sentences\n\n\nReligious culture\n“…Hindu-Muslim unity is impossible because the Muslim Quran does not tolerate Hinduism as a friend.”\n\nReligious oppression\n“…Only Hindu temples are destroyed and business and other activities are being increased in their place and Hindus are also being attacked!”\n\nAction\n“Hindu society should stop worshiping these tombstones, tombs, pirs.”\n Example 1 shows a sentence for each type of provocation. The first sentence can make readers angry at the religious book, Quran (Islamic scripture). We consider all the sentences that target scriptures, leaders, or people of religion as provoking involving religious culture. The second sentence provokes readers by mentioning the past misdeeds of Muslims destroying Hindu temples, hence it falls under the religious oppression category. Whereas, the third sentence asks Hindu readers to not worship tombstones of other religions (Islam according to the context of the post), making it provocation involving action. Difference from hate speech: Hate speech generally leverages derogatory keywords to take direct digs at the target , which is not necessary for provocative speech. The three sentences in Example 1 show how readers can be provoked without using abusive and derogatory words. Due to this indirect nature of provocative speech, the identification of provoking sentences is even more difficult. Provoking sentences can be disturbing for the target religious group (Muslims in our case) and can emotionally harm them, especially on platforms such as WhatsApp where there is no content moderation due to end-to-end encryption . On the other hand, non-target groups can end up sharing posts containing provoking sentences. This can even lead to violence against the target religious group . Therefore, we propose the following research questions.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: to two main groups: Hindus and Muslims, who form 79% and 13% of Indians, respectively .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
