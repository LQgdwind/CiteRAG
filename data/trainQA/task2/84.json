      "content": "Paper Title: A Bounded Measure for Estimating the Benefit of Visualization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nClaude Shannon’s landmark article in 1948  signifies the birth of information theory.\nIt has been underpinning the fields of data communication, compression, and encryption since.\nAs a mathematical framework, information theory provides a collection of useful measures, many of which, such as Shannon entropy , cross entropy , mutual information , and Kullback-Leibler divergence  are widely used in applications of\nphysics, biology, neurology, psychology, and computer science\n(e.g., visualization, computer graphics, computer vision, data mining, machine learning), and so on.\nIn this work, we also consider Jensen-Shannon divergence  in detail. Information theory has been used extensively in visualization [ref]9.\nIt has enabled many applications in visualization, including\nscene and shape complexity analysis by Feixas et al.  and Rigau et al. ,\nlight source placement by Gumhold ,\nview selection in mesh rendering by Vázquez et al. 4 and Feixas et al. ,\nattribute selection by Ng and Martin ,\nview selection in volume rendering by Bordoloi and Shen , and Takahashi and Takeshima ,\nmulti-resolution volume visualization by Wang and Shen ,\nfocus of attention in volume rendering by Viola et al. ,\nfeature highlighting by Jänicke and Scheuermann 6 5,\nand Wang et al. ,\ntransfer function design by Bruckner and Möller ,\nand Ruiz et al.  ,\nmulti-modal data fusion by Bramon et al. ,\nisosurface evaluation by Wei et al. 0,\nmeasuring observation capacity by Bramon et al. ,\nmeasuring information content by Biswas et al. ,\nproving the correctness of “overview first, zoom, details-on-demand” by Chen and Jänicke 3 and Chen et al. [ref]9, and\nconfirming visual multiplexing by Chen et al. 5. Ward first suggested that information theory might be an underpinning theory for visualization 5.\nChen and Jänicke 3 outlined an information-theoretic framework for visualization, and it was further enriched by Xu et al. 2 and Wang and Shen 8 in the context of scientific visualization.\nChen and Golan proposed an information-theoretic measure for analyzing the cost-benefit of visualization processes and visual analytics workflows 1.\nIt was used to frame an observation study showing that human developers usually entered a huge amount of knowledge into a machine learning model 3.\nIt motivated an empirical study confirming that knowledge could be detected and measured quantitatively via controlled experiments 8.\nIt was used to analyze the cost-benefit of different virtual reality applications\n0.\nIt formed the basis of a systematic methodology for improving the cost-benefit of visual analytics workflows .\nIt survived qualitative falsification by using arguments in visualization 1.\nIt offered a theoretical explanation of “visual abstraction” 5.\nThis work continues the path of theoretical developments in visualization 2, and is intended to improve the original cost-benefit formula 1, in order to make it more intuitive and usable in practical visualization applications.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: computer vision, data mining, machine learning), and so on.\nIn this work, we also consider Jensen-Shannon divergence  in detail.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
