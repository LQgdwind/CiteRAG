      "content": "Paper Title: Word2Pix: Word to Pixel Cross Attention Transformer in Visual Grounding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this paper we address the task of visual grounding, or referring expression comprehension, where the target is to localize the object instance in an image with a bounding box given a natural language expression which describes the referred object. From one perspective, image classification, object detection and image segmentation are fundamental vision recognition tasks. These supervised optimization tasks guide AI systems to establish correspondences between language tokens (class labels) and image feature from entire image, image regions and to image pixels respectively. However in visual grounding, models are expected to learn correspondence between object instances and sentence or phrases. These language queries may comprise many words that are not just class labels but can also be attribute words, location words or even more complicated relational descriptions.\n Existing methods for visual grounding can be split into two categories: two-stage and one-stage strategies. Two-stage visual grounding networks achieve state-of-the-art performance[ref]1[ref]2[ref]3 with the capability of modeling various relationships between context objects in an explicit way. However, two stage methods suffer from slow inference time (usually at hundreds of milliseconds) and the performance is bound by the quality of region proposals from pre-trained detectors whose model weights cannot be optimized for visual grounding target during training. To improve inference efficiency and enable end-to-end training, many one-stage methods are gaining interest recently. The common strategy for these methods is to fuse visual and textual feature at middle stage and then formulate the localization as a regression problem. As shown in Fig. 1(a), language query is encoded into one sentence level vector embedding and then duplicated at each spatial location to facilitate the regression process after the multi-modal feature fusion. In this formulation, the language modality can only provide sentence level guidance for visual localization because the embedding for each word is implicitly merged as one single sentence vector. This is a disadvantage as individual word cannot directly interact with the visual feature so the importance of each word is diluted. For example in Fig. 1(a) where the query sentence is cat sitting under the chair, the major component of the sentence embedding is taken by subject word (cat), verb (sitting) and object word (chair). However, word indicating location and relationship (under) is more critical in this case but it has to share the same sentence embedding with other words. As a result, the network fails to change its attention when the word under is replaced with on because individual word loses the chance to independently guide the network to focus on the corresponding visual feature. Additional qualitative examples are illustrated in latter section (Fig. 3). Inspired by the success of transformers in NLP research and computer vision , we propose Word2Pix: a one-stage visual grounding network based on transformer architecture to overcome the shortcomings of existing methods while at the same time maintaining the merits of one-stage paradigm. As illustrated in Fig. 1(b), the transformer decoder takes individual word token embedding as input, enabling each word to guide language to visual attention independently. This word to pixel attention provides a chance for each word in a sentence to impact the grounding results individually so that the network can learn to focus on critical word of the sentence without being biased towards the dominant words. Specifically, each word is able to attend to different visual pixels in first decoder layer and this attention is adjusted towards referent object via subsequent layers by the fusion with visual feature. Comparing with the two-stage methods, Word2Pix eliminates the need for proposal networks and enables end-to-end training, allowing gradient to reach visual feature extractor efficiently by connecting encoder layers directly to CNN backbone. Our proposed model is able to learn word feature with an embedding weight matrix or utilize off-the-shelf language models such as BERT. At prediction stage, a final visual representation refined by word to pixel attention is used for object category classification, attribute learning and bounding box regression. Experiments on three referring expression datasets (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+ and RefCOCOg) show that our method greatly extends the performance of one-stage methods to surpass state-of-the-art two-stage ones, at the same time keeps the benefits of one-stage methods for real-time inference and end-to-end training. We summarize our contributions in the following points: We propose Word2Pix: a one-stage visual grounding framework with word to pixel attention, enabling the network to consistently adjust the attention of each word on referent object and allowing a chance for individual word to guide the language-visual attention independently. We are the first to formulate word to pixel attention via encoder-decoder transformer architecture for visual grounding, which improves the robustness and explainability of existing one-stage methods. The proposed method enables gradient to propagate efficiently through low level visual feature encoder and CNN backbone. Our method extends the performance of existing one-stage by a margin to surpass two-stage methods, setting new state-of-the-art on three datasets and at the same time keeps real-time inference speed.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: descriptions.\n Existing methods for visual grounding can be split into two categories: two-stage and one-stage strategies.
