      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Spatiotemporal Frequency-Transformer for Low-Quality Video Super-Resolution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe VSR methods are developed from the image super-resolution method .\nExisting video super-resolution approaches   [ref]3 [ref]5 [ref]6    focus on restoring HR frames by extracting more temporal information, including the recurrent structure and sliding-window structure.\nFor sliding-window structures, these methods [ref]3 [ref]5 [ref]6 usually recover HR frames from adjacent LR frames within a sliding window. To align the temporal features, 3D convolution [ref]3, optical flow   and deformable convolution [ref]5 [ref]6 are widely-used.\nTypically, 3DSRNet [ref]3 adopts 3D convolution to extract temporal features.\nSTTN  estimates optical flow in both spatial and temporal dimensions and uses the estimated flow to warp target frames.\nEDVR [ref]6 adopts deformable convolution to align temporal features from adjacent frames.\nHowever, long-distance temporal features can not be utilized by these approaches. Other methods      based recurrent structure usually transmit long-distance temporal information from video frames by hidden state.\nFRVSR  restores the target SR frame with the hidden information from previously restored SR frames.\nRSDN  designs a two-stream structure-detail block to learn textures by recurrent structure.\nThe bidirectional recurrent structure that fuses forward and backward propagation features in BasicVSR and IconVSR  brings notable benefits.\nAlthough they aggregate the information from the whole sequence by hidden state, this mechanism loses the long-term modeling capabilities since the vanishing gradient. Recently, with Transformer-based approaches    are applied in VSR, great successes are achieved by using different attention   to capture temporal features. But they just can aggregate information from a few adjacent frames since the limited computational costs. Despite the impressive advancements made by these techniques, they primarily target uncompressed videos with known degradation processes and usually fail to recover the HR frames from compressed videos, or LR videos with blur degradation kernels and additive noises. In this work, we investigate the challenges of low-quality LR videos and propose a frequency-Transformer to handle these challenges.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: The VSR methods are developed from the image super-resolution method .\nExisting video super-resolution approaches   [ref]3 [ref]5 [ref]6    focus on restoring HR frames by extracting more temporal information, including the recurrent structure and sliding-window structure.\nFor sliding-window structures, these\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
