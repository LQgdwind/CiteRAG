      "content": "Paper Title: Leaking Secrets through Modern Branch Predictors in the Speculative World\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs end users are increasingly demanding higher performance from computer systems, processor vendors have been looking for every possible source of optimization and improvement in microarchitecture design.\nModern processors heavily rely on speculation to offer high instruction level parallelism.\nUnder speculation, the processor executes instructions based on certain predicted paths, which may potentially resolve to be the wrong executions (i.e., transient execution).\nAs transient execution can defy program software semantics, the underlying speculation engine is carefully designed to ensure that executions of undesired instructions are squashed, and no architectural state changes are in effect for mis-speculation. Recent advances in transient execution attacks have demonstrated the possibility of exploiting speculative execution to construct dangerous information leakage attacks. As the branch prediction unit (BPU) plays a key role in determining instructions to be fetched in the speculative path, it has been heavily exploited in these attacks to trigger mis-speculation. Particularly, in Spectre V1, the attacker can induce speculative access of unintended data through branch direction mistraining, which enables the later leakage of secrets through a microarchitecture side channel . Although hardware-based side channels in the non-speculative domain are widely studied     , transient execution attacks considerably empower these classical information leakage threats by expanding the attack surface to the speculative domain.\nWhile several system-level mitigation techniques are proposed   [ref]9, recent studies show that these techniques either are ineffective towards certain attack variants or rarely employed in userspace due to performance concerns 0 . In this work, we demonstrate a new class of hardware-based information leakage that exploits BPU state updates within the speculative domain. Our key observation is that resolutions of conditional branch instruction in the speculative path (e.g., nested speculation) alter the states of branch pattern history—the pattern history table (PHT) in particular. More critically, these speculative updates of PHT states are not restored even after the squash of speculatively executed branches in modern processors. As branch instruction outcomes in the speculation domain can depend on data accessed in a domain beyond the programmer’s original intention, speculative branch execution can be potentially exploited to perform transient execution attacks in which the BPU is utilized as the secret transmitting hardware.\nWe systematically explore the aforementioned security vulnerability and implement a new form of BPU side/covert channel in the speculative domain, which we term BranchSpectre. Similar to how Spectre fuels traditional cache timing channels, BranchSpectre reveals a more severe security concern for branch predictors with the attack manifestation in the speculative world as compared to prior BPU side channels 1 2 .\nFurthermore, BranchSpectre exhibits two unique characteristics distinctive from existing speculation-based exploits: (i) BranchSpectre completely relies on the BPU for transient execution triggering and speculation-domain secret transmission, minimizing the hardware footprint for attackers. It can bypass the bulk of existing defense techniques mostly targeting protection in the cache hierarchy 3 4; (ii) Different from Spectre attacks that depend on the relatively rare code gadget (e.g., memory access indirection 5), BranchSpectre can utilize much simpler code patterns that are more commonly existing (e.g., branch whose conditional is based on a speculatively-loaded value). These enable even higher exploitability for BranchSpectre as the transient execution attack in real systems. This article considerably extends our prior work 6 in the following aspects: i) We provide new insights about mode transitions and the PHT collision mechanism for hybrid branch predictor in commercial-off-the-shelf processors, which enable substantially higher efficiency in speculative secrets transmission. ii) We introduce a new variant of BranchSpectre side channel exploitation (i.e., BranchSpectre-v2) that chains arbitrary BranchSpectre gadgets through branch target poisoning, which further enhances the attack flexibility and capability over BranchSpectre-v1. iii) We conduct a comprehensive investigation of code patterns in commonly-used application binaries to quantify the existence of BranchSpectre gadgets and demonstrate a real-world BranchSpectre attack against OpenSSL on Intel processors.\nOur new findings further broaden the scope of the previous work and highlight the need for rethinking branch predictor designs that are secure in speculative executions. In summary, the key contributions are111Our PoC source is released at http://tiny.cc/hfgutz.:\n We find that speculative update of PHT states in modern processors creates a new information leakage threat that can leverage branch predictors as the transmitting medium in the speculative domain. We systematically explore the prediction mode transition in three recent generations of Intel processors and reverse-engineer the PHT collision mechanism under the history-based predictor. The discovery enables probing of the PHT state perturbations by an attacker with extremely high efficiency. We present a novel transient execution attack framework–BranchSpectre–that enables information leakage through BPU in various forms: BranchSpectre-cc, an ultra-fast covert channel that achieves up to 1.3Mbps transmission bit rate; BranchSpectre-v1 and BranchSpectre-v2 side channels that leverage conditional branch mistraining and branch target poisoning respectively to induce speculative PHT update in nested speculation. We perform extensive analysis on code bases of 10 popular open-source applications/libraries, which shows wider existence and stronger leakage capability of BranchSpectre gadgets in real systems. Further, our case study demonstrates a real-world BranchSpectre side channel on OpenSSL that achieves 97.3% bit accuracy. We discuss potential speculation-secure branch predictor designs that can mitigate transient execution attacks exploiting modern branch predictors.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: attacks considerably empower these classical information leakage threats by expanding the attack surface to the speculative domain.\nWhile several system-level mitigation techniques are proposed   [ref]9, recent studies show that these techniques either are ineffective towards certain attack variants or rarely employed in userspace due to performance concerns 0 .
