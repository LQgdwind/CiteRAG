      "content": "Paper Title: Faster maximal clique enumeration in large real-world link streams\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe analysis of real-world interaction networks has recently made significant progress as the field evolved from static to dynamic representations.\nIndeed, the availability of temporal data, as well as the development of tools to describe and analyze them, have revealed the importance of the events temporality.\nThey allow to understand the structure and functioning of complex interacting systems such as computer networks¬†, online social networks¬†, human communication networks¬†, or mobility networks¬†[ref]1 . Static representations of interacting systems are usually based on graphs. Concerning dynamical networks, several formalisms have been developed at the same time.\nSome choose to represent a dynamical network as a sequence of static images of equal duration ‚Äì see for instance¬†7.\nThis allows to use standard graph tools, but also raises issues about the existence of an adequate time window of analysis¬† .\nIn the same vein, time varying graphs¬† represent a dynamical network as a graph where links have attributes corresponding to the time-stamps at which they exist in the network.\nSome use a representation ‚Äì often simply called temporal network¬† ‚Äì which aims at gathering the different existing models of dynamical interacting systems, without making a strict choice of formalism.\nIn this paper, we use link streams¬†, which associate a time interval to each interaction.\nIt proposes a rigorous formalism and allows to account for the temporal aspect of the data without any parameter or restricting choice of time scale.\nYet, it is simple to go from one mode of representation to another. Listing all maximal cliques in a graph is known to be NP-hard.\nHowever, this problem is of utmost importance to analyze real-world graphs because it reveals high-density subgraphs and is thus a keystone to understand their structure.\nFor instance, clique mining is used to detect relevant dense subgraphs¬† , define communities¬† \nor compress graphs¬†.\nEfficient listing algorithms have been designed on large graphs representing real-world interaction networks.\nIn particular, the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm¬† is used on large and sparse instances, especially by using the pivot improvement, which allows to considerably reduce the search space.\nCurrently, one of the most efficient versions of this algorithm is the pivot proposed by Tomita¬†et al.¬† and its implementation by Eppstein¬†et al.¬†, which uses an adequate node ordering method and an efficient implementation for large sparse real-world graphs. In link streams, cliques are sets of vertices interacting with all others during a time interval, and maximal cliques are maximal both in number of nodes and in duration.\nTheir listing has attracted interest in the last few years because it brings a powerful analysis tool to the field. To the best of our knowledge,\nthe first algorithm to achieve this task was proposed by Viard¬†et al.¬† and later improved in¬†[ref]42.\nIn the meantime, Himmel et al. proposed a new version based on the adaptation of the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm to a dynamical context¬† , which was later generalized to the notion of kùëòk-plex by Bentert¬†et al.¬†.\nDepending on the experimental settings, one or the other method can be faster.\nHowever, these methods are still limited to relatively small dynamical networks, not allowing the enumeration on very large datasets.\nTherefore, there is a need for more efficient algorithms to list maximal cliques in link streams. The contributions of this paper are the following: We propose a new algorithm for listing maximal cliques in link streams, which scales to massive real-world datasets, We analyze the complexity of this algorithm and provide two complexities: one that depends on the input and an output-sensitive complexity that is close to the output size, thereby showing that our algorithm is efficient.\nWe also show that the memory requirements are close to optimal. We show experimentally that it significantly outperforms the state of the art and allows to enumerate cliques in networks that are two orders of magnitude larger than what was previously feasible in the time and memory limits of the protocol, which allows us to step up from link streams with less than half a million links to link streams with more than 100 million links. Finally, we provide two implementations of the algorithm: one in Python, used for comparison to the state of the art and another in C++, which is the most efficient one currently available and also allows a parallel enumeration.\nThe code is freely available‚Äâ111https://gitlab.lip6.fr/baudin/maxcliques-linkstream. The rest of this paper is organized as follows.\nSection¬†2 gives the basic definitions and notations that we use throughout the paper.\nSection¬†3 presents work in the literature related to maximal clique enumeration in link streams.\nThen, our new algorithm is presented in Section¬†4.\nIn Section¬†5, we analyze this algorithm, giving a proof of validity as well as two theoretical complexities: one as a function of input parameters and one as a function of output parameters of the enumeration.\nFinally, in Section¬†6, we make an extensive experimental assessment of the performances of this algorithm, and briefly show the results of the parallel implementation.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: allow to understand the structure and functioning of complex interacting systems such as computer networks¬†, online social networks¬†, human communication networks¬†, or mobility networks¬†[ref]1 .
