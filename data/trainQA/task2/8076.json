      "content": "Paper Title: Event Stream based Sign Language Translation: A High-Definition Benchmark Dataset and A New Algorithm\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur experiments are conducted on four event-based sign language translation datasets, including the newly proposed Event-CSL, and public EvSign [ref]42, PHOENIX-2014T-Event , CSL-Daily-Event [ref]44 datasets. We will introduce these datasets below: ∙∙\\bullet EvSign Dataset is an event-based sign language dataset drawn from daily life, such as social interaction, education, shopping, traveling, and healthcare. This dataset is collected by multiple sign language volunteers and the annotations are extracted and reorganized from the National Sign Language Dictionary of China and CSL-Daily to form an oral sentence. The training set, validation set, and testing set of the EvSign dataset contain 5570, 553, and 650 sign language videos respectively. The EvSign dataset comprises 1,387 Chinese glosses and a Chinese vocabulary of 1,947 words. ∙∙\\bullet PHOENIX-2014T-Event Dataset is derived from weather broadcasts in German Sign Language. The original videos of PHOENIX-2014T dataset are captured by traditional cameras, and its video frames are RGB images. We obtain its event representation through the DVS-Voltmeter 2, which is a stochastic process-based event simulator for dynamic vision sensors, as shown in Fig. 5 (a). We refer to the event representation of PHOENIX-2014T as PHOENIX-2014T-Event, and it remains consistent with the dataset configuration of PHOENIX-2014T in terms of the number of videos and German annotations. The training set, validation set, and testing set of PHOENIX-2014T-Event dataset contain 7096, 519, and 642 sign language videos respectively. PHOENIX-2014T-Event dataset comprises 1,066 German glosses and a German vocabulary of 2,887 words. ∙∙\\bullet CSL-Daily-Event Dataset [ref]44 is derived from daily life scenarios, covering multiple themes such as family life, healthcare, and school life. We also obtain its event representation through the DVS-Voltmeter 2, as shown in Fig. 5 (b). We refer to the event representation of CSL-Daily as CSL-Daily-Event, and it remains consistent with the dataset configuration of CSL-Daily in terms of the number of videos and Chinese annotations. The training set, validation set, and testing set of CSL-Daily-Event dataset contain 18401, 1077, and 1176 sign language videos respectively. The CSL-Daily-Event dataset comprises 2,000 Chinese glosses and a Chinese vocabulary of 2,343 words. We adopt BLEU 7 and ROUGE-L 0 to assess the performance of sign language translation. BLEU mainly scores by comparing the matching degree of n-grams in the candidate translation with multiple reference translations. The higher the score, the greater the lexical similarity between the candidate translation and the reference translations. ROUGE-L calculates the recall rate based on the Longest Common Subsequence. It focuses more on evaluating the similarity in content coverage between the generated translation and the reference translations. For both of these metrics, a higher value indicates better performance.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: Our experiments are conducted on four event-based sign language translation datasets, including the newly proposed Event-CSL, and public EvSign [ref]42, PHOENIX-2014T-Event , CSL-Daily-Event [ref]44 datasets.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
