      "content": "Paper Title: Image-Guided Navigation of a Robotic Ultrasound Probe for Autonomous Spinal Sonography Using a Shadow-aware Dual-Agent Framework\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the RL framework, an agent learns the behavior policy by interacting with the environment through a sequence of states, actions and rewards. Here, we formulate the task of the US acquisition robot to observe US images and navigate the probe toward a target standard view as a partially observed sequential decision making problem in the RL framework. States and observations.\nThe full state of the probe-holding agent can be represented as (𝐓PW,𝐓GW,I,Ig)superscriptsubscript𝐓𝑃𝑊superscriptsubscript𝐓𝐺𝑊𝐼subscript𝐼𝑔(\\prescript{W}{P}{\\mathbf{T}},\\prescript{W}{G}{\\mathbf{T}},I,I_{g}), indicating the current and goal probe poses and the corresponding US images, as described in Section III-A. We assume that the patient anatomy and the relative pose between the robot and the patient are unknown. Therefore, the goal probe pose and image are unobservable to the agent, and the agent can only observe the acquired US image I𝐼I and make navigation decisions. We use a sequence of 444 consecutive US frames acquired by the agent recently as the observation at time t𝑡t: st=[It−3,⋯,It]subscript𝑠𝑡subscript𝐼𝑡3⋯subscript𝐼𝑡s_{t}=[I_{t-3},\\cdots,I_{t}] to make use of the dynamic information, similar to . Navigation actions.\nThe policy of the RL agent π:st↦at:𝜋maps-tosubscript𝑠𝑡subscript𝑎𝑡\\pi\\colon s_{t}\\mapsto a_{t} maps from the current observation stsubscript𝑠𝑡s_{t} to a navigation action atsubscript𝑎𝑡a_{t}. In order to make the learned actions more versatile and independent of the actual patient position and orientation, different from previous methods that represent the actions in the world frame [ref]29[ref]30, we follow a probe-centric parameterization and define the navigation action a𝑎a as a transformation operator 𝐓Psuperscript𝐓𝑃\\prescript{P}{}{\\mathbf{T}} with respect to the probe frame {P}𝑃\\{P\\}, so that the probe is moved by Since 𝐓Psuperscript𝐓𝑃\\prescript{P}{}{\\mathbf{T}} contains 161616 parameters under constraints to represent a valid transformation, directly learning these parameters will be intractable and the interpretability of the learned policy will be limited. Also, a small change of the parameters may result in an abrupt change of the probe pose, which is not favorable in the US probe navigation task. To address these issues, we discretize the action space into 101010 action primitives associated with 555 DOFs of the probe, as shown in Fig. 2 (b). Four actions represent the translation of the probe along ±xplus-or-minus𝑥\\pm x, ±yplus-or-minus𝑦\\pm y axes of the probe, and six actions represent the rotation around ±xplus-or-minus𝑥\\pm x, ±yplus-or-minus𝑦\\pm y, ±zplus-or-minus𝑧\\pm z axes of the probe.\nWe adopt hierarchical action steps to navigate the probe in a coarse-to-fine manner, similar to . Specifically, the action step ds​t​e​psubscript𝑑𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑝d_{step} and θs​t​e​psubscript𝜃𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑝\\theta_{step} are initialized as 5​m​m/5∘5𝑚𝑚superscript55mm/5^{\\circ}. 303030 most recent probe poses are stored in a buffer with the format of (𝒑t,𝒒t)subscript𝒑𝑡subscript𝒒𝑡(\\boldsymbol{p}_{t},\\boldsymbol{q}_{t}), where 𝒑tsubscript𝒑𝑡\\boldsymbol{p}_{t} is the position of the probe at time t𝑡t and 𝒒tsubscript𝒒𝑡\\boldsymbol{q}_{t} is the quaternion representation of the probe orientation. If at least 333 pairs among the 303030 most recent probe poses have a pairwise Euclidean distance smaller than 0.010.010.01, the probe pose is assumed to have converged and the action step will be decreased by 1​m​m/1∘1𝑚𝑚superscript11mm/1^{\\circ}. State transition under constraints.\nDifferent from previous work that directly apply the navigation action selected by the agent [ref]29[ref]30, we take into account some safety-related environment constraints in real-world US scans to update the probe pose, as shown in Fig. 2.\nFirst, we consider the practical requirement that the probe be placed over the skin surface to ensure good acoustic coupling. Since the virtual patient in our simulation is roughly parallel with the horizontal plane (see Section III-A), we use 111-DOF translational movement of the probe in the ±zplus-or-minus𝑧\\pm z direction to follow the patient surface z=f​(x,y)𝑧𝑓𝑥𝑦z=f(x,y).\nSecond, to ensure good probe-patient contact and guarantee patient safety, the tilt angle of the probe (angle between the imaging plane and the vertical direction) should be limited. Therefore, after the new probe orientation is calculated, the tilt angle is calculated as where 𝒛^psubscript^𝒛𝑝\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}_{p} is a unit vector along the z𝑧z-axis of the probe.\nWe limit the tilt angle to be smaller than 30∘superscript3030^{\\circ}. If α>30∘𝛼superscript30\\alpha>30^{\\circ}, the probe orientation will not be updated. After the new probe pose is determined under the above constraints, a new US image can be acquired from the virtual patient, and the state of the probe will be updated. Reward.\nIn our task, the reward function used for RL training should encourage the agent to minimize the distance to goal, which can be represented by where ∥⋅∥2\\left\\|\\cdot\\right\\|_{2} is the L2 norm and ⟨⋅,⋅⟩⋅⋅\\langle\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle is the inner product. By definition, dtsubscript𝑑𝑡d_{t} measures the Euclidean distance between the current probe position and the goal position at time t𝑡t, and θtsubscript𝜃𝑡\\theta_{t} is the minimum angle required to rotate from the current probe orientation to the goal orientation. Some methods construct a dense reward function by classifying the actions as “good” (moving closer to the goal) or “bad” (moving away from the goal), and assigning rewards with manually set values [ref]29[ref]30. Similar to , we design the navigation reward at time t𝑡t to be proportional to the amount of pose improvement normalized by the action steps Note that rn​a​v,t∈[−1,1]subscript𝑟𝑛𝑎𝑣𝑡11r_{nav,t}\\in[-1,1] since the action in each step is either translation or rotation.\nIn addition, we assign a high reward (+1010+10) for task accomplishment (dt≤1​m​m​and ​θt≤1∘subscript𝑑𝑡1𝑚𝑚and subscript𝜃𝑡superscript1d_{t}\\leq 1mm\\ \\text{and }\\theta_{t}\\leq 1^{\\circ}) and add some penalties based on the safety-related constraints. When the tilt angle of the probe α𝛼\\alpha exceeds 30∘superscript3030^{\\circ}, the agent will receive a penalty of −0.50.5-0.5. When the probe moves outside the patient volume (the proportion of pixels with non-zero gray value in Itsubscript𝐼𝑡I_{t} is less than 30%percent3030\\%), the agent will get a reward of −11-1. In summary, the reward at time step t𝑡t is defined as Termination conditions.\nDuring training, we define four conditions to terminate the navigation: (i) the goal is reached; (ii) the number of steps exceeds the maximum limit (e.g., 120120120); (iii) the action step is decreased to zero; and (iv) the probe moves out of the patient. Only the last three conditions are used during inference, since the true location of the standard plane is assumed unknown to the agent.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: In order to make the learned actions more versatile and independent of the actual patient position and orientation, different from previous methods that represent the actions in the world frame [ref]29[ref]30, we follow a probe-centric parameterization and define the navigation action a𝑎a as a transformation operator 𝐓Psuperscript𝐓𝑃\\prescript{P}{}{\\mathbf{T}} with respect to the probe frame\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
