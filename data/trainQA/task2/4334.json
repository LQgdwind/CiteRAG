      "content": "Paper Title: UniNet: Unified Architecture Search with Convolution, Transformer, and MLP\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) dominate the learning of visual representations and show effectiveness on various visual tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, etc.\nRecently, convolution-free backbones show impressive performances on image classification [ref]10. Vision Transformer (ViT) [ref]11 demonstrates that pure transformer architecture that is mainly built on multi-head self-attentions (MSAs) can attain state-of-the-art performance when trained on large-scale datasets (e.g., ImageNet-21K, JFT-300M).\nMLP-Mixer [ref]41 introduced a pure multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture that can almost match ViT’s performance without using the time-consuming attention mechanism.\nThe main operators in those networks perform differently in terms of efficiency and data utilization.\nOn the one hand, convolutions in CNNs are locally connected and their weights are input-independent, which makes it effective at extracting low-level representations and efficient under the low-data regime. On the other hand, MSAs in the transformer capture long-range dependency, and the attention weights are dynamically dependent on the input representations. Hence, it is more data and computation demanding. The token-mixing in MLP-Mixer performs like a depthwise convolution of a full receptive field with parameter sharing, which is also data demanding. It is an important topic to study how to combine them effectively to form high-performance hybrid visual architectures, which, however, remains a challenge.\n There were recent papers on attempting to manually combine the different types of operators to form hybrid visual networks. In ViT [ref]11, a hybrid architecture using ResNet and transformer is also studied and improves upon pure transformers for smaller model sizes. Besides, many other works        also explored the combination of convolution and transformer to form hybrid architectures to improve data or computation efficiency. Furthermore, the combination of convolution and MLP is studied in , and the combination of gated MLP and MSA is studied in . Those previous approaches focus on combining two distinct operators and can achieve satisfactory performances to some extent. However, a unified view and a systematical study are missed in prior arts. We identify two key challenges when building high-performance hybrid architectures: (1) The operators can be implemented with various styles, and it is infeasible to manually explore all possible implementations and combinations. Although we can automate the exploration with Neural Architecture Search (NAS) techniques, the search space should be properly designed so that the search cost is affordable. (2) Each operator has its own characteristics, and simply combining them together does not lead to optimal results. We conduct a simple pilot study on directly stacking different operators to form hybrid networks. As shown in Table 1, however, the straightforward stacking of different operators achieves even worse performance than the vanilla ViT. In this paper, we study the learnable combination of convolution, transformer, and MLP by proposing a novel unified architecture search approach. Our approach has two key designs to address the challenges mentioned above.\nFirst, we model distinct operators in a unified form, and use the same\nset of searchable configuration parameters (i.e., OP type, expansion, channels, etc) to characterize each of the different operators.\nThe unified design enables us to greatly reduce the overall search space, and as a result, the total search cost becomes affordable. Besides, we propose context-aware downsampling modules (DSMs) to harmonize the combination of different operators. The proposed DSMs can be instantiated into three types, i.e., Local-DSM (L-DSM), Local-Global-DSM (LG-DSM), and Global-DSM (G-DSM), aiming to better adapt the representations from one operator to another.\nBased on these designs, we build a unified search space consisting of a large family of different general operators (GOPs), DSMs, and network size, and jointly optimize model accuracy and FLOPs for identifying high-performance hybrid networks. We illustrate the search space and the backbone in Figure 6. The discovered network, named UniNet, exhibits strong performance and efficiency improvements over common ConvNets, Transformers, or hybrid architectures on various visual benchmarks. Our experiments show that UniNet has the following characteristics: (1) placing convolutions in the shallow layers and transformers in the deep layers, (2) allocating a similar amount of FLOPs for both convolutions and transformers, and (3) inserting L-DSM to downsample for convolutions and LG-DSM for transformers. Our analysis shows that the conclusion is consistent among the top-5 models. To go even further, we build a family of high-performance UniNet models by scaling up the searched baseline network, which achieves better accuracy and efficiency in both small and large model sizes. In particular, our UniNet-B5 achieves comparable accuracy (+0.1%) to EfficientNet-B7 while requires much less computation cost (-44%) (Figure 1 (a)). By pretraining on large-scale ImageNet-21K, our UniNet-B6 achieves 87.4% accuracy, outperforming Swin-L with fewer FLOPs (-51%) and parameters (-41%) (Figure 1 (c)).\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: on various visual tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, etc.\nRecently, convolution-free backbones show impressive performances on image classification [ref]10.
