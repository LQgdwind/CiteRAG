      "content": "Paper Title: PINN Training using Biobjective Optimization: The Trade-off between Data Loss and Residual Loss\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSince the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, a variety of compartmental models have been introduced as enhanced susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) compartment models to study various aspects of the spread of SARS-CoV-2.\nPINNs have been applied to compartment models and studied in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic as well. For instance, Malinzi et al.¬†applied a PINN to a susceptible-infected-recovered-deceased (SIRD) model in order to identify the behavioural dynamics of COVID-19 in the Kingdom of Eswatini between March 2020 and September 2021.\nThey found that their PINN outperformed all other data analysis models even when given minimal quantities of training data . Kharazmi et al.¬† considered different integer-order, fractional-order and time-delay models expressed as systems of ODEs.\nWith the aim of analyzing the past dynamics of COVID-19 in New York City, Rhode Island and Michigan states as well as Italy, they used PINNs that were reported capable of performing parameter inference and simulation of the observed and unobserved dynamics simultaneously.\nTheir results showed that purely statistical approaches were generally not well suited for long-term predictions of epidemiological dynamics, and integer-order models seemed to be more robust than fractional-order models, that were first developed by Pang et al.¬†.\nMoreover, they stated that no model could accurately capture all the dynamics that play out during an extended pandemic, but models with the ability to adjust key parameters during training could lead to more useful predictions . Cai, Karniadakis and Li calibrated the unknown model parameters of a susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model using the novel fractional physics-informed neural networks (fPINNs) deep learning framework in order to obtain reliable short-term predictions of the COVID-19 dynamics caused by the Omicron variant [ref]9.\nData from the National Health Commission of the People‚Äôs Republic of China covering the time from 27t‚Äãhsuperscript27ùë°‚Ñé27^{th} February 2022 to the end of April 2022 were used. For instance, predictions were able to capture sudden changes of the tendency for the new infected cases. On the other hand, concerning the general PINN approach,\nthe multiobjective nature of PINN training was recognized in several recent publications.\nRohrhofer et al.¬† analyze the impact of different weights in a weighted sum objective of data loss and model loss by scanning the weight interval.\nAlso Jin et al.¬†[11, Section 4.4.] studied the\ninfluence of weights in an experiment for turbulent channel flow,\nby manually tuning the weight in order to improve the results.\nFinally, Wang et al.¬†[12, Algorithm¬†2.1]\nproposed an adaptive rule, called ‚Äôlearning rate annealing for PINNS‚Äô, for choosing the weights online during the training process.\nThe basic idea behind this is to automatically tune the weights by using the back-propagated gradient statistics during model training to properly balance all terms in the loss function.\nTheir numerical results on diffusion equations and Navier-Stokes equations, respectively, impressively show the impact of the weight selection on the training success.\nIndeed, suboptimal results are obtained for several training runs, thus leaving room for improved multiobjective training approaches.\nWhen the physical model and the data are in good correspondence (this is, for example, the case when the data is artificially generated from the model at hand), an ‚Äòideal‚Äô solution that simultaneously minimizes data and model loss can be sought. Maddu et al.¬† suggest a multiobjective descent method that adaptively updates the weights using an inverse Dirichlet strategy to avoid premature termination. While they do not discuss convergence guarantees, their numerical results show a good performance in comparison with recent adaptations of multiobjective descent methods  [ref]15 to PINN training .\nStochastic multiobjective gradient descent algorithms were introduced for general NN training in [ref]17.\nWe also refer to self-adaptive PINNs  and to PINN training in which the loss weights are regarded as hyperparameters . In a more general setting, multiobjective training approaches were suggested in  to trade off between data loss and regularization terms in the context of image recognition.\nThe different characteristics (slope and curvature) of the considered training goals are addressed by enhancing the stochastic multi-gradient descent approach [ref]17 with pruning strategies, and by combining adaptive weighted-sum scalarizations with interval bisection.\nThe latter supports the identification of favorable knee solutions on the Pareto front. This paper is organized as follows: In Section¬†2, the compartment model for COVID-19 predictions is introduced.\nFirstly, the SIR model is explained in Section¬†2.1 to provide an insight into the basics of epidemic modelling.\nThen the system of ODEs of our compartment model, the SVIHR model, is defined along with the used transition rates and transmission rate in Section¬†2.2.\nAll model parameters are listed in Table¬†1. Section¬†3 is devoted to the methodological developments.\nThe Nonstandard Finite Difference (NSFD) method is introduced in Section¬†3.1, where the concept of the scheme is explained, the so-called denominator function is derived and the NSFD scheme for the SVIHR model is established.\nSection¬†3.2 provides an introduction to physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with a focus on the loss function and the suggested neural network structure.\nSection¬†3.3 introduces some aspects of biobjective optimization needed to examine the Pareto front that is obtained by biobjective PINN training approaches.\nFinally, in Section¬†3.4, we introduce a dichotomic search scheme aiming to quickly find near-ideal Pareto optimal solutions and supporting an informed decision on the preferable trade-off between the data loss and the residual loss. We present our numerical results in Section¬†4.\nIn Section¬†4.1, we perform a short-term prediction of infection data, using data generated during the delta-variant wave as training data to predict the first omicron wave.\nIn Section¬†4.2, we continue with the application of the dichotomic search scheme to discuss its ability to approximate a Pareto front, and identify reasonable trade-off solutions.\nFinally, in Section¬†4.3, we perform a long-term prediction using most of our available data as training data to predict the delta wave.\nWe use the dichotomic search to find a low cost weighting parameter for both objective functions.\nA conclusion is drawn and an outlook to future work is given in Section¬†5.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: using the novel fractional physics-informed neural networks (fPINNs) deep learning framework in order to obtain reliable short-term predictions of the COVID-19 dynamics caused by the Omicron variant [ref]9.\nData from the National Health Commission of the People‚Äôs Republic of China covering the time from 27t‚Äãhsuperscript27ùë°‚Ñé27^{th} February 2022 to the end of April 2022 were used.
