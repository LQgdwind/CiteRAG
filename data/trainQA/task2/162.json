      "content": "Paper Title: Supervised Dimensionality Reduction and Visualization using Centroid-encoder\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe select three suites of data sets from the literature\nwith which we conduct three bench-marking experiments comparing centroid-encoder with a range of other supervised dimension reduction techniques.\nWe describe the details of the data sets in Section 6.1. In Section 6.2, we describe the comparison methodology and present the results of the experiments in Section 6.3. Experiment 1: The first bench-marking experiment is conducted on the\nwidely studied MNIST and USPS data sets (see Section 6.1 for details). In this experiment we compare CE with the following methods: autoencoder, nonlinear NCA , supervised UMAP , GerDA [ref]38, HOPE , parametric t-SNE , t-distributed NCA  and t-distributed MCML , and supervised UMAP. Parametric t-SNE is a DNN based model with RBM pre-training, where the objective of t-SNE is used to update the model parameters (hence parametric t-SNE). Although it is an unsupervised method, we included it as t-SNE has become a baseline model to compare visualization. We also included autoencoder as it is widely used for data visualization. We implemented nonlinear-NCA in Python, and we used the scikit-learn  package to run supervised UMAP. For the rest of the methods, we took the published results for comparison. Experiment 2: We conducted the second experiment on Phoneme, Letter, and Landsat data sets (see Section 6.1 for details). In this case, we compared CE with the following techniques: supervised neighbor retrieval visualizer (SNeRV) by , multiple relational embedding (MRE) by , colored maximum variance unfolding (MUHSIC) by , supervised isomap (S-Isomap) by\n, parametric embedding (PE) by  and neighborhood component analysis (NCA) by . We didn’t implement these models; instead, we used the published results from . On the Landsat data set, we ran UMAP and SUMAP along with the methods as mentioned above. Experiment 3: For the third experiment, we compared the performance of centroid-encoder with supervised PCA (SPCA), and kernel supervised PCA (KSPCA) on the Iris, Sonar, and a subset of USPS dataset (details of these dataset are given in Section 6.1). We implemented SPCA and KSPCA in Python following .\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: on the\nwidely studied MNIST and USPS data sets (see Section 6.1 for details). In this experiment we compare CE with the following methods: autoencoder, nonlinear NCA , supervised UMAP , GerDA [ref]38, HOPE , parametric t-SNE , t-distributed NCA  and t-distributed MCML , and supervised UMAP.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
