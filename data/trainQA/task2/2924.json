      "content": "Paper Title: Quantum Machine Learning Beyond Kernel Methods\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era [ref]1, a few methods have been proposed to construct useful quantum algorithms that are compatible with mild hardware restrictions  . Most of these methods involve the specification of a quantum circuit Ansatz, optimized in a classical fashion to solve specific computational tasks. Next to variational quantum eigensolvers in chemistry  and variants of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm , machine learning approaches based on such parametrized quantum circuits  stand as some of the most promising practical applications to yield quantum advantages. In essence, a supervised machine learning problem often reduces to the task of fitting a parametrized function – also referred to as the machine learning model – to a set of previously labeled points, called a training set. Interestingly, many problems in physics and beyond, from the classification of phases of matter  to predicting the folding structures of proteins , can be phrased as such machine learning tasks. In the domain of quantum machine learning  , an emerging approach for this type of problem is to use parametrized quantum circuits to define a hypothesis class of functions     [ref]15 [ref]16. The hope is for these parametrized models to offer representational power beyond what is possible with classical models, including the highly successful deep neural networks. And indeed, we have substantial evidence of such a quantum learning advantage for artificial problems    0 [ref]16 1, but the next frontier is to show that quantum models can be advantageous in solving real-world problems as well.Yet, it is still unclear which of these models we should preferably use in practical applications. To bring quantum machine learning models forward, we first need a deeper understanding of their learning performance guarantees and the actual resource requirements they entail. This is precisely where the main contribution of our work lies. In this paper, we analyze the relations between the different quantum models currently proposed in the literature, and uncover clear indications on which models to use in practice, in light of experimentally-relevant restrictions such as the number of qubits and quantum circuit evaluations needed to learn. Previous works have made strides in this direction by exploiting a connection between some quantum models and kernel methods from classical machine learning 2. Many quantum models indeed operate by encoding data in a high-dimensional Hilbert space and using solely inner products evaluated in this feature space to model properties of the data. This is also how kernel methods work. Building on this similarity, the authors of 3 4 noted that a given quantum encoding can be used to define two types of models (see Fig. 1): (a) explicit quantum models, where an encoded data point is measured according to a variational observable that specifies its label, or(b) implicit kernel models, where weighted inner products of encoded data points are used to assign labels instead. In the quantum machine learning literature, much emphasis has been placed on implicit models 5 6 0 7 8 9 0 1, in part due to a fundamental result known as the representer theorem 2. This result shows that implicit models can always achieve a smaller labeling error than explicit models, when evaluated on the same training set. Seemingly, this suggests that implicit models are systematically more advantageous than their explicit counterparts in solving machine learning tasks 5. This idea also inspired a line of research where, in order to evaluate the existence of quantum advantages, classical models were only compared to quantum kernel methods. This restricted comparison led to the conclusion that classical models could be competitive with (or outperform) quantum models, even in tailored quantum problems 0. In recent times, there has also been progress in so-called data re-uploading models 2 which have demonstrated their importance in designing expressive models, both analytically 3 and empirically 2 [ref]16 [ref]15, and proving that (even single-qubit) parametrized quantum circuits are universal function approximators 4 5. Through their alternation of data-encoding and variational unitaries, data re-uploading models can be seen as a generalization of explicit models. However, this generalization also breaks the correspondence to implicit models, as a given data point 𝒙𝒙\\bm{x} no longer corresponds to a fixed encoded point ρ​(𝒙)𝜌𝒙\\rho(\\bm{x}). Hence, these observations suggest that data re-uploading models are strictly more general than explicit models and that they are incompatible with the kernel-model paradigm. Until now, it remained an open question whether some advantage could be gained from data re-uploading models, in light of the guarantees of kernel methods. In this work, we introduce a unifying framework for explicit, implicit and data re-uploading quantum models (see Fig. 2). We show that all function families stemming from these can be formulated as linear models in suitably-defined quantum feature spaces. This allows us to systematically compare explicit and data re-uploading models to their kernel formulations. We find that, while kernel models are guaranteed to achieve a lower training error, this improvement can come at the cost of a poor generalization performance outside the training set. Our results indicate that the advantages of quantum machine learning may lie beyond kernel methods, more specifically in explicit and data re-uploading models.\nTo corroborate this theory, we quantify the resource requirements of these different quantum models in terms of the number of qubits and data points needed to learn. We show the existence of a regression task with exponential separations between each pair of quantum models, demonstrating the practical advantages of explicit models over implicit models, and of data re-uploading models over explicit models. From an experimental perspective, these separations shed light on the resource efficiency of different quantum models, which is of crucial importance for near-term applications in quantum machine learning.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: In the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era [ref]1, a few methods have been proposed to construct useful quantum algorithms that are compatible with mild hardware restrictions  .
