      "content": "Paper Title: MCTS with Refinement for Proposals Selection Games in Scene Understanding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMore traditional approaches in room layout reconstruction relied on estimation of vanishing points      to reconstruct room layouts under strong Manhattan-world assumptions. These approaches typically failed in scenarios where edge features of the layout are not visible in the image. Another track of room layout estimation methods tries to fit a single box that best describes the input scene  [ref]32   [ref]33 , some of which also include objects and humans in the room layout estimation loop  . Our 3D room layout reconstruction approach is more related to approaches that identify planes corresponding to the layout components. Zou et al.   detects layout proposals with up-to-five dominant layout planes and applies a greedy hill-climbing algorithm to select among proposals based on the input RGB-D image. Recent data driven approaches for plane detection    [ref]40 became a very attractive option to extract general planes in the scene from a single color image. Howard-Jenkins et al.   directly learns to estimate layout planes from an input color image and, similarly, we show in this work that we can train the PlaneTR [ref]40 network to infer room layout planes. We build upon Stekovic et al.   that, first, generates a set of room layout proposals by intersecting the detected layout planes, and, then, formulates a discrete optimization setting to find the optimal set of proposals. Instead of performing the brute force search, we rely on MCTS to find the optimal solution while jointly refining sampled solutions.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: failed in scenarios where edge features of the layout are not visible in the image.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
