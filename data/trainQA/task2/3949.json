      "content": "Paper Title: Parallel and Distributed Graph Neural Networks: An In-Depth Concurrency Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMany of the considered parts of the parallel and distributed GNN landscape were\nnot thoroughly researched. Some were not researched at all. We now list such\nchallenges and opportunities for future research. Efficient GNN inference Most GNN frameworks focus on training,\nbut fewer of them also target inference. There is a large potential for developing\nhigh-performance schemes targeting fast inference. Advanced mini-batching in GNNs There is very little work on\nadvanced mini-batch training and GNN layer pipelining. Mini-batch training of\nGNNs is by nature complex, due to the dependencies between node, edge, or graph\nsamples. While the traditional deep learning saw numerous interesting works\nsuch as GPipe , PipeDream [ref]169,\nor Chimera [ref]147, that investigate mechanisms such as\nasynchronous or bi-directional mini-batching, such works are yet to be\ndeveloped for GNNs. Asynchronous GNNs The landscape of asynchronous GNNs is largely\nunexplored. While we outline the overall framework defined in\nEq. (2), (3), (4), and\n(5), implementations, optimizations, and analyses are missing.\nThere could be a plethora of works improving the GNN performance by\nincorporating different forms of asynchrony. More performance in GNNs via replication Many GNN works have\nexplored graph partitioning. However, very few (e.g.,\nCAGNET ) uses replication for more\nperformance (e.g., through 2.5D & -3D matrix multiplications). Parallelization of GNN models beyond simple C-GNNs There is not\nmuch work on parallel and distributed GNN models beyond the simple seminal\nones from the C-GNN or A-GNN classes, such as GCN \nor GraphSAGE [ref]103. One\nwould welcome works on more complex models from the MP-GNN class,\ncf. Tables V-VI. Parallelization of GNN models beyond linear ones\nVirtually no research exists on parallel and distributed GNN models of\npolynomial and rational types, cf. Table VII. Parallelization of other GNN settings Besides very few\nattempts , there is no work on parallelizing\nheterogeneous GNNs , dynamic and temporal\nGNNs , or hierarchical GNNs . We\npredict that parallel and distributed schemes targeting these works will come\nwith a large number of research opportunities, due to the rich diversity of\nthese GNN models and the associated graph related problems.\nOne example idea\nwould be to use the available techniques from dynamic and streaming graph\nprocessing  for GNNs. Achieving large scales A large challenge is to further\npush the scale of GNN computations. When comparing the scale and parameter\ncounts of models such as CNNs or Transformers with GNNs, it can be\nseen that there is a large gap and a lot of research opportunities. New forms of parallelism It would be interesting to investigate\neffective utilization of other forms of parallelism in GNNs, for example using\nMixture of Experts . Incorporating new HW architectures While some initial works\nexist, there are not many designs on using GNNs with architectures such as\nFPGAs  , transactional\nprocessing , or processing in\nmemory          . Incorporating high-performance distributed-memory capabilities\nCAGNET  illustrated how to scalably execute GNN\ntraining across many compute nodes. It would be interesting to push this\ndirection and use high-performance distributed-memory developments and\ninterconnects, and the associated mechanisms for more performance of\ndistributed-memory GNN computations, using – for example – RDMA and RMA\nprogramming  ,\nSmartNICs  , serverless\ncomputing , of high-performance networking\narchitectures    . Such techniques have been successfully used to accelerate the\nrelated graph processing field 0. Incorporating techniques from graph processing There is more\npotential in using graph processing techniques for GNNs. While many such\nschemes have already been incorporated, there are\nmany more to be tried,\nfor example sketching and sampling    or various forms of approximate graph\nprocessing   5      4  4 . Incorporating techniques from linear algebra computations\nA lot of work has been done into optimization algebraic operations such as\nmatrix products 8    8 6 . Many of them could be applied\nin the GNN setting, especially in the context of GL GNN formulations. System designs for graph predictions\nThere are few studies and systems focusing on graph-related predictions.\nFor example, developing load balancing schemes for mini-batch parallelism where\nsamples are graphs would be a promising area of study.\n\nReference markers found: [169]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]169: training of\nGNNs is by nature complex, due to the dependencies between node, edge, or graph\nsamples. While the traditional deep learning saw numerous interesting works\nsuch as GPipe , PipeDream [ref]169,\nor Chimera [ref]147, that investigate mechanisms such as\nasynchronous or bi-directional mini-batching, such works are yet to be\ndeveloped for GNNs. Asynchronous GNNs The landscape of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
