For convex optimization problems, the KKT conditions map coefficients to the set of solutions, and thus can be differentiated for argminargmin\\operatorname*{argmin} using implicit function theorem. Following this idea, existing work\ndeveloped implicit layers of argmin in neural network, including OptNet  for quadratic programs (QP) problems and CVXPY  for more general convex optimization problems. Further with linear relaxation and QP regularization, Wilder et al. derived an end-to-end framework for combinatorial programs , which accelerates the computation by leverage the low-rank properties of decision vectors , and is further extended to mixed integer linear programs in MIPaaL [ref]27. Besides, for the relaxed LP problems, instead of differentiating KKT conditions, IntOpt [ref]28 proposes an interior point based approach which computes gradients by differentiating homogeneous self-dual formulation. Optimizing surrogate loss functions. Elmachtoub and Grigas [ref]10 proposed a convex surrogate loss function, namely SPO+, measuring the decision error induced by a prediction, which can handle polyhedral, convex and mixed integer programs with linear objectives. TOPNet  proposes a learned surrogate approach for exotic forms of decision loss functions, which however is hard to generalize to handle constrained programs. Differentiating argminargmin\\operatorname*{argmin} is critical for gradient methods to optimize decision-focused prediction models. Many kinds of efforts, including regularization for specific problems (e.g., differentiable dynamic programming 0, differentiable submodular optimization 1), reparameterization 2, perturbation 3 and direct optimization (), are spent for optimization with discrete or continuous variables and still actively investigated. As a comparison, our work proposes a surrogate loss function for constrained linear and quadratic programs extended with soft constraints, where the soft constraints were not considered principally in previous work. Also, unlike OptNet  and CVXPY , our method does not need to solve KKT conditions. Instead, by adding reasonable costs for infeasibility, we convert the constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained one while keeping the same solution set, and then derive the required Jacobian analytically. To some degree, we reinvent the exact function 4 in prediction+optimization.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: framework for combinatorial programs , which accelerates the computation by leverage the low-rank properties of decision vectors , and is further extended to mixed integer linear programs in MIPaaL [ref]27.
