      "content": "Paper Title: Progressive Correspondence Pruning by Consensus Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAccurate pixel-wise correspondences act as a premise to tackle many important tasks in computer vision and robotics, such as Structure from Motion (SfM)¬†[ref]39, Simultaneous Location and Mapping (SLAM)¬†, image stitching¬†, visual localization¬†[ref]31, and virtual reality¬†. Unfortunately, feature correspondences established by off-the-shelf detector-descriptors ¬†    tend to be sensitive to challenging cross-image variations, such as rotations, scale changes, viewpoint changes, and illumination changes.\nMuch recent research has therefore focused on correspondence selection¬†  [ref]29, aiming to identify correct matches (inliers) while rejecting false ones (outliers). In this context, deep learning has been utilized as a powerful solution¬†[ref]29 8 7 0, typically casting correspondence selection as a per-match classification task, and adopting Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) to classify putative matches into inliers and outliers. However, the resulting learning problem is significantly complicated by the fact that the initial matches are general extremely unbalanced, with around 90%percent9090\\% of outliers¬†8(refer to the bottom-left image in Fig¬†1), which are randomly distributed in real-world scenarios¬†8. We therefore employ a toy line-fitting example shown in Fig.¬†2 to explain this issue, in which 100 inliers are identically sampled from the same line, while 900 outliers are randomly located. The standard PointCN¬†[ref]29 baseline may fail to detect the same set of inliers depending on the outliers included in the data, because, given a finite training time, learning a distinctive feature embedding from arbitrarily located outliers is non-trivial. In this paper, motivated by the classical L‚àûsubscriptùêøL_{\\infty} minimization method¬†, we propose to progressively prune the initial set of correspondences into a subset of candidates instead of classifying correspondences in a one-shot fashion. As the majority of outliers are expected to be filtered out after progressive pruning, this approach lets us identify reliable inliers among the candidates (bottom-right image in Fig.¬†1).\nThis process, however, requires defining a pruning strategy. Leveraging the intuition that one cannot classify an isolated correspondence as inlier or outlier without context information, we therefore introduce a local-to-global consensus learning framework, which explicitly captures local and global correspondence context via dynamic graphs to facilitate the correspondence pruning process. Specifically, we dynamically construct a local graph for each input correspondence, whose nodes and edges represent the neighbors of the correspondence and their affinities in feature space, respectively. We then introduce an annular convolutional layer to aggregate local features and produce a consensus score for each local graph. Guided by local consensus scores, we further merge multiple local graphs into a global one, from which we obtain a global consensus score via a spectral graph convolutional layer¬†. Together, the local and global consensus learning layers form a novel ‚Äúpruning‚Äù block, which preserves potential inliers with higher consensus scores while filtering out outliers with lower scores. Correspondence pruning is then progressively achieved by stacking multiple pruning blocks. Such an architecture design encourages the refinement of local and global consensus learning at multiple scales. In contrast to previous works¬†[ref]29 0 that implicitly model contextual information via feature normalization, our network explicitly exploits context thanks to our local-to-global graphs.\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows. We propose to progressively prune correspondences for better inlier identification, which alleviates the effects of unbalanced initial matches and random outlier distribution. We introduce a local-to-global consensus learning network for robust correspondence pruning, achieved by establishing dynamic graphs on-the-fly and estimating both local and global consensus scores to prune correspondences111Code is available at: https://sailor-z.github.io/projects/CLNet. Our approach explicitly captures contextual information to identify inliers from outliers. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the tasks of robust line fitting, camera pose estimation and retrieval-based image localization. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a considerable margin.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: Accurate pixel-wise correspondences act as a premise to tackle many important tasks in computer vision and robotics, such as Structure from Motion (SfM)¬†[ref]39, Simultaneous Location and Mapping (SLAM)¬†, image stitching¬†, visual localization¬†[ref]31, and virtual reality¬†.
