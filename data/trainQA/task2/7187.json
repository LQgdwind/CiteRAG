Their approach starts with Compliance Requirements (in form of e.g. laws or regulations) which first need to be interpreted into compliance objectives and then specified into compliance rules. How the Compliance Requirements, meaning the relevant laws, regulations, etc. are identified is not covered. Thus, all of the above mentioned approaches take relevance as an implicit assumption. While legal information retrieval (LIR) identifies relevant data based on a large corpus of legal data, we study relevance based on business process data.\nInformation retrieval is based on similarity computation, using e.g., BERT-Variations [ref]43 between the search term and the text corpus [ref]25. A search term usually consists of a few keywords, rather than a long, complex prompt as in our case.\nCurrent research   [ref]43 7 in the field of regulatory document ranking and retrieval show, that a “combination of lexical and semantic retrieval models leads to the best results” .\nMajor research in this area originates form the Competition on Legal Information Extraction/Entailment (COLIEE) .\nThe tasks about relevant text retrieval are related to our problem. However, the fact, that there are different tasks for case and statute law already indicates how different the approaches are even when retrieving relevant law texts based on other relevant law texts of the same type.\nAnother very recent work is concerned with classifying regulatory documents as business-relevant or business-irrelevant . Our approach focuses on the identification of the relevant processes within the business and even more detailed, which process parts are affected.\nIn summary, no LIR analysis exists to identify relevant requirements for a specific business process or even more specific task of a business process as presented in this work. Our application area of generative AI falls into the field of text classification, as we want to classify a regulatory text as relevant or irrelevant, given a process scenario and context information. The literature reviews on large language models and their capabilities conducted by  come to the conclusion that “ChatGPT has tremendous potential in text classification tasks”. 7 studies the classification capabilities of ChatGPT with crowd workers for identifying implicit hate speech in tweets.\nThey conclude that ChatGPT can aid the understanding of the experts and provides “great potential of ChatGPT as a data annotation tool” 7. As of October 2023, the latest GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) version is GPT-4. OpenAI introduces their model with the promise of “human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks” , including applicability to the legal domain through e.g. “passing a simulated bar exam” .\nTherefore, as applicability to classification tasks and the legal domain has been shown, but no combination of legal data classification, depending on complex process and context data has been performed yet, we choose GPT-4 as one method for this study. Over the years, crowdsourcing has provided great opportunities to create large-scale manually labeled ground-truth data to harness the “wisdom of crowds” for various applications (e.g., training machine learning models)  .\nOn paid crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon MTurk (AMT), crowd workers usually complete tasks anonymously, and, hence, collecting high-quality data becomes a major challenge. Existing research has explored different ways to guarantee the quality of the collected data, such as answer aggregation models  8, suitable workers selection   9, embedding purpose-designed questions (e.g., gold standard) 4 6, and encouraging workers to re-think about the questions 2.\nFollowing this line of research, in our crowd study, we adopt three quality checks in the deployed task, including: (1) test questions to check if the worker has understood the task, (2) attention checks to filter those who provide random answers, and (3) sophisticated task design where only certain combinations of the answers make sense according to  (implementation details are described in Sect. 4.4).\nOn the other hand,  and  show that a combination of automated\nmethods with input from crowd workers can improve the quality of the generated annotations.\nTherefore, we also consider combining algorithmic approaches with crowdsourcing to\ndesign our process for annotating a large amount of regulatory documents, for which the first step is to understand, to what extent, such a complex task could be completed by AI, experts and crowds.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: relevant data based on a large corpus of legal data, we study relevance based on business process data.\nInformation retrieval is based on similarity computation, using e.g., BERT-Variations [ref]43 between the search term and the text corpus [ref]25. A search term usually consists of a few keywords, rather than a long, complex prompt as in our case.\nCurrent research   [ref]43 7 in the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
