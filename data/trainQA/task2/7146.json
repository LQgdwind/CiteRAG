      "content": "Paper Title: Depth-discriminative Metric Learning for Monocular 3D Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMonocular 3D object detections¬† [ref]24 [ref]25 [ref]29 has gained prominence as a cost-effective and easily deployable solution, playing a critical role in autonomous driving and robotic navigation systems.\nTypically, the frameworks consist of a feature extractor and lightweight multi-head architectures that predict the projected centers, depths, bounding box sizes, and heading directions of multiple objects from a single RGB image¬†  [ref]24 [ref]25  [ref]29 .\nAmong these tasks, object depth estimation, inferring the distance from a monocular camera to the center of an object, is the most challenging sub-task due to depth ambiguity.\nPrevious work¬†[ref]25 has highlighted this issue in ablation studies, revealing that substituting object depth predictions with ground-truth (GT) values significantly improves overall performance, while replacing other sub-tasks, such as heading direction and 3D size, does not notably enhance performance.\nFurthermore, several prior works¬†   [ref]24 [ref]29 0 9  have attempted to improve object depth estimation quality by adding additional modules or introducing new formulations.\nHowever, despite the subsequent increase in inference time and model size, the improvement in performance remains limited. These observations suggest that monocular 3D object detection heavily relies on object depth quality; nevertheless, conventional methods yield unsatisfactory results due to the extraction of less-discriminative features for object depth inference.\nOne reason is that the extracted feature involves visual attributes, such as the color, size, and heading direction of objects, resulting in the object depth head receiving feature with limited depth discernment.\nTo improve object depth performance, the network should be capable of extracting purely depth-discriminative features that involve essential geometric information, irrespective of the visual attribute.\nA feasible method for extracting the depth-discriminative features involves using deep metric learning schemes such as contrastive learning¬†   or representation learning¬† 6. However, most existing deep metric learning schemes¬†    rely on aggressive two-view augmentation (i.e. Affine transform) to train the distance or similarity metric.\nThis aggressive data augmentation method is hardly leveraged in current monocular 3D object detection frameworks due to the violation of geometric constraints, where horizontal flip and color distortion are the only two methods used in this field for a long time¬†.\nOne alternative way is to learn a regression-aware representation by contrasting samples against each\nother based on their target distance using GT labels¬†.\nHowever, forcibly arranging the manifold of the feature space using this depth distance metric may negatively impact the performance of the other tasks, because the feature extractor for monocular 3D object detection inevitably produces complex shared representations across multiple sub-tasks. Note that the experiment of negative impact is conducted in Sec.¬†5.2. To address these issues, we propose a (K,B,œµ)ùêæùêµitalic-œµ(K,B,\\epsilon)-quasi-isometric loss, a new metric learning approach that encourages the network to extract depth-discriminative features using object depth labels.\nInspired by several manifold learning schemes¬†1 5, we locally preserve the neighborhood distances to maintain the natural non-linear manifold of feature space in order to mitigate the negative transfer effect on other sub-tasks.\nOur approach utilizes the quasi-isometric properties providing a relaxed condition for the distance metric between the depth and feature metric spaces.\nThis enables the model to arrange the feature space with respect to the object depth labels while maintaining the performance of other sub-tasks.\nMoreover, we introduce an auxiliary head for object-wise depth estimation to further improve object depth estimation. The head component is removed after the training process, ensuring that the inference time remains unaffected and does not experience an increase.\nExperimental results indicate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a variety of 3D object detection datasets.\nOur method has been shown to be compatible with various monocular 3D object detection frameworks¬†  [ref]24 [ref]25 [ref]29, demonstrating its broad applicability without compromising inference time or increasing model size.\nThe effectiveness of each proposed module is further underscored through comprehensive ablation studies. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We propose a simple yet effective metric learning scheme that preserves the geodesic distance of depth information to feature space. We present an auxiliary head for object-wise depth estimation, which enhances the depth quality without impacting the inference time, maintaining efficient performance. Our method significantly enhances the performance of various monocular 3D object detection methods without increasing inference time and model size.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: Monocular 3D object detections¬† [ref]24 [ref]25 [ref]29 has gained prominence as a cost-effective and easily deployable solution, playing a critical role in autonomous driving and robotic navigation systems.\nTypically, the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
