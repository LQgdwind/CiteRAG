According to  LeCun et al. (2015) and, deep learning allows computational models to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction, improving the state-of-the-art in many domains, such as speech recognition, object recognition, object detection. The simplest Deep Learning models are called Deep Feedforward, in which information is only propagated in one direction through neurons. Other examples of algorithms are: Back-Propagation, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Auto-Encoder (AE), Deep Belief Network (DBN), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) . One particular type of deep, feedforward network that was much easier to train and generalized much better than networks with full connectivity was the convolutional neural networks . The CNNs constitute one of the most powerful techniques for modeling complex processes and performing pattern recognition in applications with a large amount of data and pattern recognition in images (). This one is a connectionist approach that stands out as one of the most prominent because it allows the automatic extraction of features. Their results in some experiments are already superior to humans in large-scale reconnaissance tasks. Figure 1 presents a conceptual architecture for convolutional neural networks. In recently researches of Convolutional Neural Networks many approaches already make use of popular architectures such as LeNet , AlexNet [ref]28, VGGNet [ref]29, GoogLeNet , InceptionV3 , ResNet  and DenseNet , considerably increasing the accuracy in the identification and recognition of objects. New topologies and architectures dawn for many others approaches, as described in .\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: Computer Vision, along with Artificial Intelligence (AI), has been developing techniques and methods for recognizing and classifying objects with significant advances [ref]24.
