      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Pixel Aggregations for Image and Video Denoising\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImage and video capturing systems are often degraded by noise including shot noise of photons and read noise from sensors .\nThis problem is exacerbated for the images and videos captured in low-light scenarios or by cellphone cameras with small-apertures.\nTo address the problem, different image denoising algorithms have been proposed for generating high-quality images and video frames from the noisy inputs       [ref]8 [ref]9. The success of most denoising methods stems from the fact that averaging multiple independent observations of the same signal leads to lower variance than the original observations.\nMathematically, this is formulated as: where V​a​r𝑉𝑎𝑟Var denotes the variance operation. x𝑥x is a noisy pixel, and {x(i),i=1,2,…,N}formulae-sequencesubscript𝑥𝑖𝑖12…𝑁\\{x_{(i)},i=1,2,...,N\\} are N𝑁N i.i.d.formulae-sequence𝑖𝑖𝑑i.i.d. observations of it.\nSince it is difficult to obtain multiple observations of the same pixel,\nexisting denoising algorithms      usually sample similar pixels from the input image and aggregate them with weighted averaging.\nThe sampling grid 𝒩𝒩\\mathcal{N} and averaging weights ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} are usually data-dependent and spatially-variant as the distribution of similar pixels depends\non local image structures.\nThe strategies to decide 𝒩𝒩\\mathcal{N} and ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} are the key factors distinguishing different denoising approaches.\nAs a typical example,\nthe bilateral smoothing model  samples pixels in a local square region and computes the weights with Gaussian functions.\nIn addition, the BM3D  and VBM4D  methods search relevant pixels by block matching, and the averaging weights are decided using empirical Wiener filter.\nHowever, these approaches usually use hand-crafted schemes for sampling and weighting pixels, which do not always perform well in complex scenarios as shown in Figure 1(c) and (h). Recently, numerous denoising methods based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) 0 1 2 have been proposed.\nThese models exploit a large amount of training data to learn the mapping function from the noisy image to the desired clear output.\nHowever, the CNNs usually use spatially-invariant and data-independent convolution kernels whereas the denoising process is spatially-variant and data-dependent .\nThus, very deep structures are needed for these methods to achieve high non-linearities to implicitly approximate the spatially-variant and data-dependent process, which is not as efficient and concise as the aggregation-based formulation.\nIn addition, the CNN-based approaches do not explicitly manipulate the input pixels to constrain the output space and may generate corrupted image textures and over-smoothing artifacts as shown in Figure 1(d). To address the aforementioned problems, we propose a pixel aggregation network to explicitly integrate the pixel aggregation process with data-driven methods for image denoising.\nSpecifically, we use CNNs to estimate a spatial sampling grid 𝒩𝒩\\mathcal{N} for each location in the noisy image.\nTo aggregate the sampled pixels, we predict the averaging weights ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} for each sample.\nNote that both 𝒩𝒩\\mathcal{N} and ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} are content-aware and can adapt to image structures.\nFinally, the denoised output can be obtained by combining ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} and 𝒩𝒩\\mathcal{N} with weighted averaging in an end-to-end network.\nThe advantages of the proposed denoising method are as follows.\nFirst, we improve the pixel aggregation process by learning from data instead of relying on hand-crafted schemes.\nSecond, compared to other deep learning based methods, the proposed model can better adapt to image structures and preserve details with the spatially-variant and data-dependent sampling and averaging strategies.\nIn addition, our algorithm directly filters the noisy input, which thereby constrains the output space.\nAs shown in Figure 1(e), the proposed network generates clearer result with fewer artifacts.\nNote that while one can simply sample pixels from a rigid grid similar to the kernel prediction network (KPN) [ref]9, it often leads to limited receptive field and cannot efficiently exploit the structure information in the images.\nMoreover, the irrelevant sampling locations of the rigid sampling scheme may negatively affect the denoising performance.\nIn contrast, the proposed method can sample pixels in a dynamic manner to better adapt to image structures and increase the receptive field without sampling more locations. In addition to single images, we can also use the proposed method in video denoising.\nA straightforward approach for this is to apply 2D pixel aggregation on each frame separately and then fuse the results by pixel-wise summation.\nHowever, this simple strategy is not effective in handling videos with large motion, where few reliable sampling locations can be found in neighboring regions for pixel aggregation. To address this issue, we need to allocate more sampling locations on the frames with higher reliability and discard the frames with drastic motion.\nAs such, this requires our algorithm to be able to search pixels across the spatio-temporal space of the input video.\nInstead of predicting 2D sampling grid and averaging weights,\nwe develop a spatio-temporal pixel aggregation network for each location in the desired output to adaptively select the most informative pixels in the neighboring video frames.\nThe proposed spatio-temporal method naturally solves the large motion issues by capturing dependencies between 3D locations and sampling on more reliable frames.\nOur method can effectively deal with the misalignment caused by dynamic scenes and reduce the artifacts of existing video denoising approaches  [ref]9 as shown in Figure 1(j). In this paper, we make the following contributions.\nFirst, we exploit the strength of both aggregation-based methods and the deep neural networks, and propose a new algorithm to explicitly learn the pixel aggregation process for image denoising.\nSecond, we extend the spatial pixel aggregation to the spatial-temporal domain to better deal with large motion in video denoising, which further reduces artifacts and improves performance.\nIn addition, we introduce a regularization term to facilitate training the video denoising model.\nExtensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method compares favorably against state-of-the-arts on both single image and video inputs.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: cameras with small-apertures.\nTo address the problem, different image denoising algorithms have been proposed for generating high-quality images and video frames from the noisy inputs       [ref]8 [ref]9.
