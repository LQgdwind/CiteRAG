      "content": "Paper Title: Link Prediction on N-ary Relational Data Based on Relatedness Evaluation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe rapid development of KG has triggered the spring up of a great many methods, including tensor/matrix based methods, translation based ones, and neural network based ones, for link prediction on binary relational data. Among tensor/matrix based methods  [ref]13 [ref]14     , RESCAL  views a KG as a three-way tensor, where each way corresponds to head entities, relations, or tail entities. The entry corresponds to the score indicating the validity of the triple formed by the thee ways. Through minimizing the reconstruction error of the tensor, the embeddings of entities and relations are learned. Then, the reconstructed tensor from the learned embeddings is used to conduct link prediction, with triples corresponding to entries of high scores as valid ones. Based on RESCAL, type constraints are further integrated in [ref]14 via indexing only those embeddings of entities for each relation that agree with specific type constraint. Similar to RESCAL, ComplEx  constructs a matrix for each relation, which is factorized and optimized via minimizing the reconstruction error to learn the embeddings. Differently, complex values are used to define the embeddings, so as to deal with antisymmetric relations effectively. Upon ComplEx, TypeComplex  enhances each base factorization with two type compatibility terms between entity-relation pairs (one for the head entity and the other for the tail entity). Translation based methods are derived from TransE . Its translation assumption advocates that valid triples can be viewed as relational translations from head entities to tail entities. Based on this assumption, different types of translations and accordingly different score functions measuring the similarity between the relational translation results of the head entities and the target tail entities are defined               . The embeddings of entities and relations are then learned via minimizing score function based loss, which encourages valid triples to have much larger scores than invalid ones. Among these methods, TransE, performs translations in a shared space of entities and relations. TransH  further thinks translations should be conducted in relation-specific hyperplanes and relates each relation with a hyperplane. Then, entities are projected into the hyperplanes of relations before translations. TKRL  takes advantage of hierarchical entity types in the construction of projection matrices for entities. And in negative sampling, it tends to select entities having the same types; In evaluation, it removes the candidates which do not follow type constraints. TransT  constructs relation types from entity types and utilizes type-based semantic similarity of the related entities and relations to capture prior distributions of entities and relations. With these prior distributions, it generates semantic vectors for entities in different contexts, which are learned following TransE. Then, it estimates the posterior probability of entity and relation predictions. TAPR  uses types to enrich the embeddings of entities and relations, and describes a type-level attention to select the most relevant type of the given entity in a specific triple. Inspired by the excellent performance of neural networks in various applications, they have been introduced into link prediction on binary relational data and have achieved extremely promising results   [ref]37      . Among them, the R-GCN [ref]37 method introduces relational Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) as its encoder to get the embeddings of entities, and uses the existing method  as its decoder to compute the scores of triples with the embeddings of entities from the encoder and the embeddings of relations randomly initialized. CompGCN  further learns the embeddings of relations in the GCN encoder. Differently, SENN  integrates the prediction tasks of head entities, relations, and tail entities in a unified Fully Connected Network (FCN) framework based on shared embeddings. ConvKB  represents each triple as a three-column matrix. This matrix is fed into a convolution layer to get feature maps, which are then concatenated into a single feature vector representing the triple. After passing it to a fully connected layer, ConvKB obtains a score indicating the validity of the triple.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: a great many methods, including tensor/matrix based methods, translation based ones, and neural network based ones, for link prediction on binary relational data.
