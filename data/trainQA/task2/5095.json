      "content": "Paper Title: TuRaN: True Random Number Generation Using Supply Voltage Underscaling in SRAMs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTrue random number generators (TRNGs) sample random physical phenomena (e.g., electrical noise  , atmospheric noise  , thermal noise , clock jitter , noise in a compact memory ) to generate non-deterministic truly-random numbers. Random number sequences generated by TRNGs are unpredictable and irreproducible, since the source of entropy is non-deterministic. Therefore, security-critical applications use TRNGs to guarantee secure operation, as the random values generated by TRNGs do not depend on a seed value that can compromise the system security when predicted. Modern systems use dedicated hardware TRNGs to provide true random numbers to applications.\nHowever, not all modern computing devices have dedicated hardware TRNGs (e.g., IoTs and mobile systems  ). To enable true random numbers in these devices, prior works propose TRNG mechanisms that use existing memory devices such as SRAMs      , DRAMs   , FLASH memories . Among these devices, SRAM (i) exists in most commodity systems even where other devices do not (e.g., RFID tag circuits ) and (ii) is more secure as it is on-chip and does not require any off-chip link to transfer the generated random numbers to the computing unit. These advantages make SRAM a promising TRNG substrate. Prior works on SRAM-based TRNGs     [ref]91  [ref]118      use start-up values as a source of entropy to generate random numbers. The start-up values of some SRAM cells settle to an unpredictable value depending on the environmental noise (e.g. temperature and voltage fluctuations) at each power-up. Unfortunately, existing SRAM-based TRNGs that rely on start-up values suffer from four key drawbacks: they (i) cannot sustain continuous operation and generate true random numbers with  (ii) low-throughput,  (iii) high-latency, and  (iv) high energy consumption, compared to the other memory-based TRNGs    [ref]37. Our goal in this paper is to overcome these drawbacks and develop\nan SRAM-based TRNG that can be practically implemented in commodity devices while continuously providing high-throughput true random numbers with low-latency and low energy consumption. To meet our goal, we propose a new technique to generate true random numbers in SRAM devices by underscaling the supply voltage of an SRAM device. Underscaling the supply voltage of the SRAM blocks below the manufacturer-recommended margin and accessing the SRAM cells using the nominal latency violates the required access latency, and thus causes an access failure . We observe that not all access failures are deterministic and reading certain reduced-voltage SRAM cells induce metastability in SRAM sense amplifiers which causes sense amplifiers to sample random data. To this end, we propose TuRaN, a new SRAM-based TRNG that leverages the access failures in SRAM cells as the source of entropy to generate true random numbers by aggressively underscaling SRAM supply voltage and post-processing the resulting errors using a cryptographic hash function. TuRaN consists of three steps: 1) experimentally identifying the SRAM rows that have high entropy under voltage underscaling operation using a low-cost profiling step as a one-time process, 2) performing read operation on the previously-identified high entropy rows and, 3) post-processing the result of the read operation using SHA-256 cryptographic hash function and generates true random numbers. We verify the randomness of failure mechanism i.e., access failure that TuRaN leverages using detailed circuit-level simulations. We show that regardless of process node 1) SRAM devices are inherently susceptible to access failures, and 2) access failures can be used as a source of entropy as it exhibits randomness. To support our simulation-based observations, we conduct FPGA-based experiments. We perform our real-world experiments and characterization on two identical samples of the Xilinx ZC702 FPGA board  with 560 blocks of SRAMs in total. We analyze each SRAM row’s entropy under four operating parameters: (i) voltage, (ii) data pattern, (iii) frequency, and (iv) temperature. We observe that the randomness caused by access failures in reduced-voltage SRAMs does not only occur in simulation environment but also occurs in commodity SRAM chips. Therefore, we expect that TuRaN is a reliable TRNG mechanism that is applicable for a wide range of SRAM devices. We evaluate TuRaN using 560 real SRAM chips in four aspects: quality (i.e., randomness), throughput, energy, and latency. We use the NIST STS to validate the randomness of TuRaN’s output and observe that random numbers generated by TuRaN pass all NIST STS tests. Our empirical results show that TuRaN generates true random numbers with the average (maximum) throughput of 1.6​G​b​p​s1.6𝐺𝑏𝑝𝑠1.6Gbps (1.812​G​b​p​s1.812𝐺𝑏𝑝𝑠1.812Gbps). TuRaN consumes 0.11​n​J0.11𝑛𝐽0.11nJ energy per true random bit while having 278.46​μ​s278.46𝜇𝑠278.46\\mu s 256-bit true random number generation latency. We integrate TuRaN into L1 data cache and L2 cache in a modern computing system . We use Drowsy Cache  to enable TuRaN, as Drowsy Cache allows us to scale the voltage level of each cache line at negligible cost. To generate true random numbers, TuRaN takes advantage of the idleness in data cache hierarchy. To leverage the idle time intervals in caches, TuRaN follows a two step approach. First, when a cache have enough idle cycles to generate random numbers, TuRaN underscales the voltage of a previously-identified cache line that has the highest entropy and reads the sense amplifier result to obtain a random bitstream. Second, TuRaN performs the SHA-256 function using the CPU to avoid any additional area overhead. We evaluate TuRaN by running applications from SPEC2006  benchmark suite on a realistic system modelled using the gem5  system simulator and observe that TuRaN generates true random numbers in the L1 data cache (L2 cache) with an average throughput of 4.03​G​b​p​s4.03𝐺𝑏𝑝𝑠4.03Gbps (10.95​G​b​p​s10.95𝐺𝑏𝑝𝑠10.95Gbps) and has 0.00165​m​m20.00165𝑚superscript𝑚20.00165mm^{2} (0.0111​m​m20.0111𝑚superscript𝑚20.0111mm^{2}) chip area overhead which is 0.0066% (0.0444%) of a core die area of modern high-end\nCPU ) while having 4.86%percent4.864.86\\% (1.92%percent1.921.92\\%) performance degradation on average. Our contributions are as follows: We introduce TuRaN, a new SRAM-based TRNG that leverages SRAMs for extracting true random numbers by performing aggressive voltage underscaling below the safe margin. To our knowledge, this study is the first work to use the voltage underscaling technique for generating true random numbers in SRAMs. To evaluate the potential of true random number generation using SRAMs, we characterize SRAM access failures under four different operating parameters: voltage, data pattern, frequency and temperature using 560 SRAM blocks embedded in FPGAs. We experimentally evaluate that TuRaN is a high-quality TRNG using the standard NIST STS for randomness and show that random bitstreams extracted with TuRaN pass all tests. We show that TuRaN (i) maintains its continuous operation, (ii) achieves 2.26×2.26\\times higher throughput, (iii) consumes 5.09×5.09\\times less energy, and (iv) has 5.39×5.39\\times lower latency, compared to the state-of-the-art SRAM-based TRNGs, We study system integration of TuRaN and show that TuRaN can generate true random numbers in the L1 data cache (the L2 cache) at 4.03​G​b​p​s4.03𝐺𝑏𝑝𝑠4.03Gbps (10.95​G​b​p​s10.95𝐺𝑏𝑝𝑠10.95Gbps) throughput while incurring a negligible area overhead of 0.00165​m​m20.00165𝑚superscript𝑚20.00165mm^{2} (0.0111​m​m20.0111𝑚superscript𝑚20.0111mm^{2}) and 4.86%percent4.864.86\\% (1.92%percent1.921.92\\%) performance degradation, on average.\n\nReference markers found: [91]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]91: and does not require any off-chip link to transfer the generated random numbers to the computing unit.
