      "content": "Paper Title: MisMatch: Calibrated Segmentation via Consistency on Differential Morphological Feature Perturbations with Limited Labels\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the current study the backbone is a 2D U-net [ref]27 with 24 channels in the first encoder. To ensure a fair comparison we use the same U-net as the backbone across all baselines. The first baseline utilises supervised training on the backbone, is trained with labelled data, augmented with flipping and Gaussian noise and is denoted as “Sup1”. To investigate how unlabelled data improves performance, our second baseline “Sup2” utilises supervised training on MisMatch, with the same augmentation. Because MisMatch uses consistency regularisation, we focus on comparisons with five consistency regularisation SSLs: 1) “mean-teacher” (MT) , with Gaussian noise, which has inspired most of the current state-of-the-art SSL methods; 2) the current state-of-the-art model called “FixMatch” (FM) [ref]2. To adapt FixMatch for a segmentation task, we use Gaussian noise as weak augmentation and “RandomAug”  without shearing for strong augmentation. We do not use shearing for augmentation because it impairs spatial correspondences of pixels of paired dense outputs; 3) a state-of-the-art model with multi-head decoder [ref]6 for segmentation (CCT), with random feature augmentation in each decoder [ref]6. This baseline is also similar to models recently developed  ; 4) a further recent model in medical imaging  using image reconstruction as an extra regularisation (MTA), augmented with Gaussian noise; 5) a U-net with two standard decoders, where we respectively apply erosion and dilation on the features in each decoder, augmented with Gaussian noise (Morph)”; 6) an uncertainty aware mean-teacher based SSL segmentation model . Our MisMatch model has been trained without any augmentation.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: In the current study the backbone is a 2D U-net [ref]27 with 24 channels in the first encoder.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
