[ref]15 involves 5,763 users and 56 contents, which consists of 175,856 interactions. used in Ref. [ref]15, while the numbers of users and contents are larger, making the Netflix even much sparser.\nAfterwards, we perform a 60%-20%-20% chronological split of the dataset for training, validation, and testing, respectively. Evaluation Tasks and Training Configuration:\nTo verify the effectiveness of our proposed models, we compare our models with several state-of-the-art models, including TGAT , DyRep [ref]23, TGN [ref]25 and its variants (i.e., TGN-L, TGN-M and TGN-A).\nNotably, the receptive field for the graph in GNN is proportional to the number of GNN layers l𝑙l and the neighbors Nnsubscript𝑁𝑛N_{n} in each sub-graph.\nAs Ref.  suggests, we set l=2𝑙2l=2 and Nn=10subscript𝑁𝑛10N_{n}=10 in TGAT, while l=1𝑙1l=1 and Nn=10subscript𝑁𝑛10N_{n}=10 in TGN.\nBesides, we also compare our models to the TGN model with larger receptive field, i.e., l=1,2𝑙12l=1,2 and Nn=11,12,13,14,15,20subscript𝑁𝑛111213141520N_{n}=11,12,13,14,15,20. Furthermore, as for pre-trained NLP models,\nGlove  is conducted by global word-to-word occurrence statistics from a large corpus, while BERT  is a neural network model based on 12-layer Transformer.\nThe dimension numbers of their output embeddings are fixed (50 for Glove and 738 for BERT).\nTo reduce the computational cost, we also adopt an MLP to compress the representations of BERT.\nBesides, Ref.  also discovers that the outputs from the 666-th to 101010-th layers outperform in semantic tasks.\nTherefore, we average the embeddings from the 666-th to 101010-th layers to investigate the performance. Moreover, we conduct experiments under two tasks, i.e., transductive task and inductive task.\nDifferent from the transductive task, the validation set and test set in an inductive task may contain some vertices that have not been observed by models during the training phase.\nFor both tasks, we adopt the average precision (AP) and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) as evaluation metrics. Caching Policy Setting:\nAs depicted in Fig. 3, we configure a multi-layer network architecture.\nThe storage capacity in the device closer to users is typically smaller .\nHence, we assume that the Tier 1 can store 5 contents, while 7 and 8 contents can be cached at Tier 2 and Tier 3, respectively. As for the content caching task, our target is to predict contents’ popularity during 24 hours in the test phase.\nWe assume that the candidate content set ℐℐ\\mathcal{I} is known apriori.\nTo make the simulations more practical, we supplement the candidate content set with a noise set, which consists of the contents that have been requested within a 50-hour duration before the prediction starting time.\nBesides, the user set 𝒰𝒰\\mathcal{U} of each hour is also assumed to be known in our simulation.\nAs for other hyperparameters, we compute the per-hour popularity with ΔP=1subscriptΔ𝑃1\\Delta_{P}=1h and δP=60subscript𝛿𝑃60\\delta_{P}=60s while the threshold value pthre=0.995subscript𝑝thre0.995p_{\\text{thre}}=0.995. To verify the superiority of our models in content caching, a comparison between the traditional caching method, LRU, and the prediction results based strategy is also carried out.\nWe deploy TGN-A and its variants, e.g., M2-STGN-A and M2-STGN-A+U, as predictive models.\nDue to the trade-off between training speed and prediction performance for M2-STGN-L+U and M2-STGN-L+U+SPE, simulations based on them are executed as well.\nMoreover, testing in the inductive setting, we also conduct extensive ablation studies with M2-STGN-A+U, whose performance in preference prediction is the most superior, so as to examine the influence of different hyperparameters (i.e., different sizes of content supplement set and values of δPsubscript𝛿𝑃\\delta_{P} & pt​h​r​esubscript𝑝𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒p_{thre}) on content caching.\nNotably, we adjust the size of the content supplement set by changing the duration before the starting time.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: we actually adopt includes 86,889 interactions, which involve 11,254 different users and 4,057 pieces of content.\nThe number of interactions is less than the dataset555The dataset used in Ref.
