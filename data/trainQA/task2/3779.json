A successful approach to do so is to use supervised learning, i.e., to train a model on a large, manually annotated dataset [ref]32. However, if we take inspiration from how infants learn to move, we are brought to conclude that they may not rely on extensive guidance. In fact, while supervision from adults might come through language , the signal is certainly not detailed enough to fully define the locomotion dynamics.\nOne approach that does not require direct supervision is to learn just through direct scrutiny of other agents, i.e., through passive imitation. In fact, infants have an abundance of sensory exposure to the activities of adults before they themselves learn how to perform them . The first step for an observing agent to learn how to operate in an environment through passive imitation and without explicit supervision is to build a model that:\n1) separates an agent from its environment, 2) captures the appearance of the agent and its environment, and 3) builds a description of the agent’s dynamics. The first requirement implies that the model incorporates some segmentation capability, and it allows to explain transitions over time more easily. The second requirement is dictated by the fact that we exploit the reconstruction of visual observations as our indirect supervision signal. Thus, our model also relates to the video generation literature. Finally, the third requirement is that the model includes an action space, which serves two purposes: i) it allows the model to decode a video into a sequence of actions (which is a representation of the agent’s dynamics) and ii) it allows the model to control the generation of videos by editing the action sequence. Recently, several methods have explored the above direction to different extents  2   . In particular, CADDY  models the dynamics and the appearance of videos globally: It does not have an explicit separation between the agent and the environment, and thus their dynamics are tangled in action space (e.g., a person walking and the camera panning).\nA recent method by Huang et al. 2 is instead heavily based on the segmentation of a foreground from the background. However, this method does not learn to decode a sequence of frames into an action sequence. Moreover, the method relies on a static background and the dynamics are limited to transformations of a mask (2D shifts and affine transformations) so that it would not be obvious how to control more general dynamics such as rotations and similar in situ animations.

As shown in Fig. 2, GLASS first learns to segment each frame of a video into foreground and background layers. A basic principle to do that is to use motion as a cue, i.e., the fact that agents exhibit, on average, a distinct motion flow compared to the environment. Motion-based segmentation could be achieved through background subtraction, which is however restricted to stationary backgrounds, or instead, more in general, via optical flow. For simplicity, we propose to use an explicit foreground-background motion segmentation based on 2D shifts.\nThen, GLASS regresses the relative shift between the foregrounds of two subsequent frames, which we call the global action, and between the backgrounds (see Fig. 3). The local actions are learned only from the foregrounds. We train an RNN to predict, through a decoder, the next foreground by using an encoding of a foreground, the previous state, and an encoding of the local and global actions as input. All networks are trained via reconstruction losses. We evaluate GLASS on both synthetic and real data. As synthetic data we introduce W-Sprites (Walking Sprites   ) (see Fig. 1), a dataset with a pre-defined action space, and where the action labels between pairs of frames (as well as the agent segmentation and location, and the background shift) are known. We find that GLASS learns a robust representation of both global and local dynamics on W-Sprites. Moreover, GLASS is able to decode videos into sequences of actions that strongly correlate with the ground truth action sequences. Finally, users can generate novel sequences by controlling the input action sequences to GLASS. On real data, we find that GLASS can also generate realistic sequences by controlling the actions between frames.\nContributions: i) We introduce GLASS, a novel generative model with a global and local action space; the shifts estimated and generated through the global actions have an accuracy comparable to or higher than SotA; moreover, local actions allow a fine-grained modeling of dynamics that is not available in prior work;\nii) We introduce W-Sprites, a novel dataset for the evaluation of action identification and generation; iii) We demonstrate GLASS on both synthetic and real datasets and show that it can: 1) segment an agent from its environment and estimate its global shift over time; 2) learn a disentangled action space that is consistent across agents; 3) decode videos into sequences of actions; 4) synthesize realistic videos under the guidance of a novel action policy.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: that can learn how to operate in an environment through visual data 7.
