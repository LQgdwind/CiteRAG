      "content": "Paper Title: SCAM! Transferring humans between images with Semantic Cross Attention Modulation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBeing able to perform subject transfer between two images is a key challenge for many applications, from post-processing in game or art industries to software addressing the needs of the public. For instance, in film industries, one could replace a stunt performer by the main actors, thus alleviating the need of finding a look-alike performer; hence, increasing the filmmakers freedom. Similarly, it could enable finishing a film when an actor is indisposed. Given a source and a target subject, the idea of subject transfer is for the source subject to replace the target subject in the target image seamlessly. The target image should keep the same background, the same interactions between subject and objects, and the same spatial configuration, to account for possible occlusions. Figure 1 illustrates this. Note, in contrast to faces, buildings, or landscapes, human bodies are malleable with high morphological diversity, thus casting the task hard to model. Most methods focus either on pose transfer [ref]51  [ref]45, where the pose changes, or on style transfer [ref]56 , where the pose remains fixed but the subject’s styling changes.\nThese are limited and cannot be used out of the box for our task, as they are:\n(1) restrictive; they only work on uniform backgrounds, failing in complex ones (PISE [ref]51, SEAN [ref]56, [ref]45), and\n(2) expensive; they require hard training [ref]45 or training one model per human (Everybody Dance Now ). Instead, subject transfer changes both the pose and the style/identity of the subject. Thus, a successful system is decoupled in both pose and style transfer and performs both tasks simultaneously. Semantic editing is a related task, consisting in controlling the output of a generative network by a segmentation mask. Indeed, subject transfer can be performed with semantic editing by using the mask of the target subject with the style of the source.\nHowever, modern methods cannot handle complex layout and rich structure (like full-bodies) with in the wild backgrounds.\nFor instance, SPADE  fails to control each region style independently, while SEAN [ref]56 fails to handle complex, detailed scenes, such as multiple background objects. To this end, we propose the Semantic Cross Attention Modulation system (SCAM), a semantic editing model that accounts for all aforementioned challenges relevant to subject transfer.\nSCAM captures fine image details inside the semantic region by having multiple latents per semantic regions. This enables capturing unsupervised semantic information inside the semantic labels, which allows for better handling coarse semantic labels, such as background. Our model can generate more complex backgrounds than previous methods and outperforms SEAN [ref]56 both on the subject transfer and semantic reconstruction tasks. We propose three architectural contributions:\nFirst, we propose the Semantic Cross Attention (SCA) that performs attention between a set of latents (each linked to a semantic region) and an image feature map. SCA constrains the attention, such as the latents only attend the regions on the image feature map that correspond to the relevant semantic label.\nSecondly, we introduce the SAT operation and encoder (Semantic Attention Transformer) that relies on cross attention to decide which information to gather in the image and for which latent, thus allowing for richer information to be encoded.\nThird, we propose the SCAM-Generator (after which SCAM is named) that modulates the feature maps using the SCAM-Operation, which allows every pixel to attend to the semantically meaningful latents. Note, the whole architecture is trained using a reconstruction setup only, and subject transfer is performed at test time.\n\nReference markers found: [51]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]51: Note, in contrast to faces, buildings, or landscapes, human bodies are malleable with high morphological diversity, thus casting the task hard to model.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
