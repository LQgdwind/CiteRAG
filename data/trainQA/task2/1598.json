      "content": "Paper Title: Extending Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Neural Networks with Differentiable Contact Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLagrangian/Hamiltonian-inspired Neural Networks:\nIn the last few years, an increasing volume of work has proposed neural network models to learn the underlying dynamics from data while enforcing energy conservation. This line of works leverage Lagrangian dynamics       or Hamiltonian dynamics    [ref]16 to incorporate the physics prior of energy conservation into deep learning. Recently, Finzi et al. [ref]17 show that using Cartesian coordinates and enforcing explicit constraints improve learning in both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian settings. To learn the underlying dynamics governed by an ODE, many of these prior works have used Neural ODE  which can learn an ODE from observed trajectories. However, real systems often exhibit non-smooth trajectories caused by sudden/abrupt changes in the velocity due to contacts and collisions. Although Neural ODE based approaches have recently been extended for learning dynamics with jump discontinuities   , they cannot accommodate the physical constraints (e.g., maximum dissipation principle, non-negative normal force) associated with contacts. Among the energy-conserving neural networks, only [ref]16 attempted to address contacts and collisions; to capture the elastic collision of a billiard ball, it manually reverses the momentum of the ball orthogonal to the contact surface. However, this specialized technique cannot be applied to frictional or inelastic contacts, or objects that can rotate. Contact Model:\nOur contact model shares similarity with the contact model of MuJoCo   . However, there are three differences: (1) our contact model handles elastic contacts while MuJoCo only focuses on inelastic contacts; (2) MuJoCo solves the convex optimization problem with a generalization of the Projected Gauss-Seidel method while we leverage the open-source scs solver  to solve the optimization problem; (3) the dynamics in MuJoCo is described using generalized coordinates, while we use Cartesian coordinates, since it has been shown in previous work [ref]17, the use of Cartesian coordinates improves the learning of system properties. Another category of contact models solve contact impulses by solving a linear complementarity problem (LCP) . Recently, a number of works       has proposed differentiable LCPs for downstream planning and control tasks. However, their performance on learning the contact properties has yet to be tested. Differentiable Simulation:\nThe recent past has also witnessed a growing interest in differentiable physics simulation that can be used in many downstream tasks (e.g., parameter estimation, planning, and control)     [ref]37 . Jiang et al.  use an LCP formulation to learn contact impulses for perfectly inelastic contacts. DiffTaichi  focuses on material point method and only provides intuitively simple contact mechanisms. The support for partially elastic frictional contacts is yet to be provided. Geilinger et al.  differentiates through the dynamics solver analytically.\nMacklin et al. [ref]37 develop a compliant contact model and formulate an implicit time-stepping scheme for integrating the dynamics. Incremental Potential Contact (IPC)  uses a custom implicitly time-stepped solver to solve nonlinear intersection-free and inversion-free elastodynamics.\nHowever, it is not clear if unknown dynamics and contact properties can be learned using the implicit time-stepping scheme proposed in [ref]37 . NeuralSim  formulates a nonlinear complementarity problem to learn contact impulses and then solves it using Projected Gauss-Siedel. GradSim  uses a relaxed Coulomb model to learn contacts from video sequences.\nLe Lidec et al.  propose a differentiable physics simulator that can handle conic friction and elasticity. They demonstrate its ability for system identification on a simple 2D system.\nChen et al.  propose neural event functions to handle instantaneous changes in a continuous system and test it on frictionless bouncing balls.\nHowever, these prior differentiable simulation models do not focus on the energy aspect of the system and their performance on the prediction of system energy (of learned dynamics) has not been evaluated.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: has proposed neural network models to learn the underlying dynamics from data while enforcing energy conservation.
