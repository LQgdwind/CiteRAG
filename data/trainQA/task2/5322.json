      "content": "Paper Title: 3DSGrasp: 3D Shape-Completion for Robotic Grasp\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDataset.\nWe use the partial version of the YCB dataset [ref]4, which is a popular choice in PCD completion for robotic grasping [ref]5. We randomly sample 50 views from the training set (Training Views), 50 views from the holdout view set (Holdout Views), and 50 views from the holdout models set (Holdout Models).\nWe evaluate the completion network on holdout views and holdout model sets and the training is achieved with only the training set split.\nAs the exact train/test split is unspecified in [ref]4, for fair comparison with the state-of-the-art methods on PCD shape completion, we train all compared methods using our own split dataset. All PCDs are pre-processed as described in Section III-A for normalisation and sampling.\n\nComparison.\nWe compare our proposed PCD completion network against a range of state-of-the-art methods for shape completion in terms of the L​2𝐿2L2 Chamfer-Distance loss  (multiplied by 1000) between the reconstructed, and the ground truth PCD. For a fair comparison, we train from scratch (all the mentioned methods using the same dataset and split) and test against the existing PCD completion networks such as FoldingNet , PCN , MSN [ref]7, and PoinTr  on the partial YCB dataset using their open-source code with their best hyper-parameters. We are unable to fairly compare against  as the code is unavailable.\nAs shown in Table I, on average, our completion network achieves the lowest reconstruction loss among the competitors, outperforming the state-of-the-art method (i.e., PoinTr)\nby +0.230.23+0.23. Ablation.\n\nWe perform extensive experiments to justify our network design choices in terms of the Offset-attention and skip-connection using the partial YCB dataset. Moreover, we evaluate the effect of our proposed PCD alignment processing technique on PCD completion performance. Do the Offset-attention and skip-connection improve the PCD completion accuracy?\nWe evaluate the impact of our proposed Offset-Attention encoder-decoder layer and skip connection on the PCD reconstruction error. A set of variant models are studied: model A𝐴A is the baseline Transformer with Self-Attention encoder-decoder layer, model B𝐵B adds Skip-connection between the encoder and decoder to the baseline model, model C𝐶C replaces Self-Attention with Offset-Attention layer and model D adds both skip-connection and Offset-Attention layer to the transformer.\nAs shown in Table II, we observed that using skip-connection can improve the performance of the baseline model by +0.130.13+0.13. When using Offset-Attention layer (model C𝐶C) instead of Offset-Attention layer (model A𝐴A), we observe an improvement to 0.980.980.98. The best result is achieved by model D𝐷D when adding both skip-connection and Offset-Attention layer to the transformer. Does the PCD pre-processing help with PCD completion? We evaluate the effect of our proposed PCD pre-processing technique on point cloud completion using our completion network, PCN  and PoinTr . The B​a​s​e​l​i​n​e​n​o​r​m.𝐵𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚Baseline~{}norm. stands for normalising the GT and partial PCD with same formula but different parameters and O​u​r​n​o​r​m.𝑂𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚Our~{}norm. use the parameters of partial PCD to normalise GT PCD (See Section III-A). As shown in Table III, our network achieved the lowest reconstruction error compared to the other two methods using both PCD processing techniques. Moreover, there is a large reduction in PCD reconstruction error when applying our proposed pre-processing technique to all methods.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Dataset.\nWe use the partial version of the YCB dataset [ref]4, which is a popular choice in PCD completion for robotic grasping [ref]5.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
