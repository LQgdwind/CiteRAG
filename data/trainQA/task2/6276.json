      "content": "Paper Title: Human-imperceptible, Machine-recognizable Images\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRelying on massive personal images, the industry has shown promising capabilities for developing artificial intelligence (AI) for many computer vision tasks, e.g., image classification [ref]1 [ref]2, face recognition  , action recognition  [ref]6, etc. In this process, a major conflict has been seen relating to software engineers between better developing AI systems and distancing from the sensitive training data. To reconcile this conflict, we raise a problem in this paper: Can we process images to be human-imperceptible and machine-recognizable? Such that software engineers can access the sensitive training data to facilitate their developing AI systems, without leaking the sensitive contents to the engineers. To process images to be “human-imperceptible, machine-recognizable”, we develop two encryption strategies: random shuffling (RS) and mixing-up (MI); see Figure 1. RS randomly shuffles the patch order of an image, which destroys the position configurations between patches and can thus be applied to position-insensitive scenarios. Decrypting an image encrypted by RS is to solve a jigsaw puzzle problem, which can incur considerable computational overhead since the problem to be solved is a NP-hard one . MI mixes up the sub-patches in a patch, which preserves the position configurations between patches and can thus be applied to position-sensitive scenarios. Decrypting an image encrypted by MI is to solve an ill-posed inverse problem, which could be hard to solve due to the difficulty in modeling the sub-patch distribution. Then, we make minimal adaptations to vision transformer (ViT)  to enable it to learn on the encrypted images; see Figure 2. By removing position encoding, ViT is made permutation-invariant and thus capable of learning on images encrypted by RS, resulting in PEViT for the image classification task. Further, we develop a reference-based positional encoding for PEViT, which can retain the permutation-invariant property and thus boost the performance by a noticeable margin. Since position information plays a key role in the low-level object detection task, MI is chosen to encrypt images for this task. By adapting the way that image patches are embedded, YOLOS , a vanilla ViT-based model, is able to learn on images encrypted by MI, resulting in PEViT for the object detection task. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet  and COCO . Extensive attack experiments show the security of our encryption strategies. Comparison results on large-scale benchmarks show that both PEViT and PEYOLOS achieve promising performance even with highly encrypted images as input. We thus show that the proposed paradigm can ensure the encrypted images have become human-imperceptible while preserving machine-recognizable information. The code is available at https://github.com/FushengHao/PrivacyPreservingML. Our main contributions are summarized as follows: We propose an efficient privacy-preserving learning paradigm that can ensure the encrypted images have become human-imperceptible while preserving machine-recognizable information. RS is tailored for the standard image classification with ViT. By substituting the reference-based positional encoding for the original one, ViT is capable of learning on images encrypted by RS. By further designing MI, the privacy-preserving learning paradigm is extensible to position-sensitive tasks, such as object detection, for which we only need to adapt the way image patches are embedded. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed privacy-preserving learning paradigm.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Relying on massive personal images, the industry has shown promising capabilities for developing artificial intelligence (AI) for many computer vision tasks, e.g., image classification [ref]1 [ref]2, face recognition  , action recognition  [ref]6, etc. In this process, a major conflict has been seen relating to software engineers between better developing AI systems and distancing\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
