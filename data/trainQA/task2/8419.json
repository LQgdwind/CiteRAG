      "content": "Paper Title: Un-evaluated Solutions May Be Valuable in Expensive Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor comparative analysis, we identify three representative Bayesian optimization toolkits: the BayesianOptimization toolkit (BOT) [ref]46, Heteroscedastic Evolutionary Bayesian Optimisation (HEBO) , and Scikit-Optimize (Skopt) . These toolkits are based on Bayesian optimization algorithms and possess the following key attributes: BOT: Incorporates sequential domain reduction  within the standard BO framework, significantly accelerating the search process and hastening convergence. HEBO: Implements input and output warping to mitigate the effects of heteroscedasticity and non-stationarity in the objective function. It employs multi-objective optimization to optimize multiple acquisition functions concurrently, thereby enhancing the algorithmâ€™s robustness. Skopt: Utilizes the Hedge strategy  to probabilistically select among different acquisition functions at each iteration, increasing the robustness of the search process. Additionally, two surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) are utilized in the experiments: the surrogate-assisted multiswarm optimization (SAMSO)  and the fuzzy classification-based preselection for CoDE (FCPS-CoDE) , representing EAs assisted by regression and classification models, respectively. An Estimation of Distribution Algorithm with local search (EDA/LS)  serves as the baseline algorithm for this study and is included in the experimental analysis. Detailed descriptions are as follows: SAMSO: Utilizes a dual-swarm approach with cross-swarm intelligence sharing and dynamic swarm size regulation, guided by a Radial Basis Function (RBF) to estimate the evaluation function. FCPS-CoDE: Employs a fuzzy K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier to predict solution categories before evaluation, aiding the Composite Differential Evolution (CoDE) algorithm in its evolutionary search. EDA/LS: Integrates an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) using a Variable Width Histogram (VWH) and includes a local search operator to facilitate the evolutionary search.\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: For comparative analysis, we identify three representative Bayesian optimization toolkits: the BayesianOptimization toolkit (BOT) [ref]46, Heteroscedastic Evolutionary Bayesian Optimisation (HEBO) , and Scikit-Optimize (Skopt) .
