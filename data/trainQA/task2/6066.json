Consequently, the leader’s utility in an δ𝛿\\delta-RSE can be viewed as a well-defined function uRSE​(δ)subscript𝑢RSE𝛿u_{\\textup{RSE}}(\\delta) of δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0.\nBy analyzing the function uRSE​(δ)subscript𝑢RSE𝛿u_{\\textup{RSE}}(\\delta), we show several analytical properties of the δ𝛿\\delta-RSE and compare it with other solution concepts, including the classic SSE and the maximin equilibrium.\nUnder a minor non-degeneracy assumption, the function uRSE​(δ)subscript𝑢RSE𝛿u_{\\textup{RSE}}(\\delta) is proved to exhibit Lipschitz continuity within a regime of small δ𝛿\\delta, and approaches the leader utility under SSE as δ→0→𝛿0\\delta\\to 0. Note that such continuity is a “surprisingly” nice property since in discrete strategic games an agent’s equilibrium utility typically is not continuous in the other agents’ parameters. For instance, in SSE, the leader’s utility may drop significantly if the follower’s payoff changes even slightly or the follower’s response is slightly sub-optimal because these may cause the follower to switch to a response that is dramatically worse to the leader. Interestingly, our added layer of worst-case analysis somehow smoothed the follower response and installed the continuity property. This continuity property has multiple interesting implications. First, it implies that regardless of what causes the follower’s up-to-δ𝛿\\delta sub-optimal behavior,222It is easy to see that any δ𝛿\\delta perception error on follower’s payoffs   or leader’s mixed strategy [ref]4  will lead to O​(δ)𝑂𝛿O(\\delta) sub-optimal follower responses when payoffs are bounded. the leader’s utility will always be O​(δ)𝑂𝛿O(\\delta) off from the SSE utility for small δ𝛿\\delta. Second, this property turns out to be very useful for learning both the RSE and SSE, which we will further elaborate on below. Next, we investigate the complexity of computing a δ𝛿\\delta-RSE. In sharp contrast to the tractability of computing an SSE, we show that for any δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0, it is NP-hard to even approximate (the leader’s strategy in) a δ𝛿\\delta-RSE; this inapproximability result rules out the possibility of a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS), assuming P ≠\\neq NP. Our proof employs a highly nontrivial reduction from the eXact 3-set Cover (X3C) problem. The reduction is combinatorial in nature despite computing (continuous) mixed strategies and a key technical challenge in the proof is to relate continuous game strategy space to the combinatorial solution space of X3C.\nOn the positive side, we present a quasi-polynomial approximation\nscheme (QPTAS) to compute an approximate RSE.\nOur proof employs the probabilistic method  to prove the existence of an approximate δ𝛿\\delta-RSE, which is similar to [ref]30 for proving the existence of an approximate Nash equilibrium with simple format termed the uniform strategy (which can be enumerated in quasi-polynomial time). However, our algorithm for identifying the approximate δ𝛿\\delta-RSE is significantly different — in fact, the approximate δ𝛿\\delta-RSE is not even a uniform strategy but instead is some strategy nearby. This is due to the nature of bi-level optimization in Stackelberg games. While a uniform leader strategy 𝒙¯¯𝒙\\overline{\\boldsymbol{x}} and any nearby strategy 𝒙𝒙\\boldsymbol{x} will lead to similar leader utilities, they will lead to different follower responses which in turn affects what leader utility is induced in the equilibrium. This challenge forces us to efficiently search the nearby region of a uniform strategy 𝒙¯¯𝒙\\overline{\\boldsymbol{x}} for a leader strategy 𝒙𝒙\\boldsymbol{x} that induces the most favorable follower response. This challenge brought by follower responses does not present in computing an approximate Nash equilibrium. We remark that it is an intriguing though highly non-trivial open question to close the gap between the above hardness result and QPTAS.333Familiar readers may recall that there was a similar gap in the complexity landscape of computing a Nash equilibrium, which was an open problem for about 10 years. Specifically, around 2005, Lipton et al. [ref]30 developed a QPTAS for finding an ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-Nash whereas Daskalakis et al. , Chen et al.  ruled out FPTAS for two-player Nash (assuming PPAD⊈not-subset-of-or-equals\\not\\subseteqP). The gap between these two results was open for about 10 years until Rubinstein  settled the lower bound that rules out PTAS for Nash and matches the QPTAS of [ref]30, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis for PPAD. Last but not least, we turn to the learnability of δ𝛿\\delta-RSE in a setting where the payoff functions are not known in advance but need to be learned from samples of the players’ utilities. Such a learning paradigm is crucial to today’s common practice of “centralized\ntraining, decentralized execution” in multi-agent learning  [ref]5. We obtain almost tight results on the learnability of the δ𝛿\\delta-RSE. Specifically, we construct a learning algorithm that, with high probability, outputs a strategy with leader’s utility O​(ϵ)𝑂italic-ϵO(\\epsilon) or O​(1)𝑂1O(1) away from the δ𝛿\\delta-RSE by using O​(1/ϵ2)𝑂1superscriptitalic-ϵ2O(1/\\epsilon^{2}) samples, depending on whether a continuity condition is satisfied or not. We then present hard instances with sample complexity lower bounds for each case. As a corollary of this learnability result and the property mentioned before that δ𝛿\\delta-RSE approaches SSE as δ→0→𝛿0\\delta\\rightarrow 0, we immediately obtain an algorithm for learning SSE. This algorithm strictly improves a recent learning algorithm for SSE by [ref]5 with both better utility guarantee and better computational efficiency.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: implies that regardless of what causes the follower’s up-to-δ𝛿\\delta sub-optimal behavior,222It is easy to see that any δ𝛿\\delta perception error on follower’s payoffs   or leader’s mixed strategy [ref]4  will lead to O​(δ)𝑂𝛿O(\\delta) sub-optimal follower responses when payoffs are bounded. the leader’s utility will always be O​(δ)𝑂𝛿O(\\delta) off from the SSE utility for small δ𝛿\\delta.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
