      "content": "Paper Title: Image Retrieval on Real-life Images with Pre-trained Vision-and-Language Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor CIRR, we evaluate the following methods using publicly available implementations222https://github.com/google/tirg, https://github.com/yahoo/maaf: TIRG [ref]40 is an image-text composition model for composed image retrieval, which has proven to be effective on multiple datasets  [ref]13 [ref]40 [ref]18. The method uses a gating and residual design to encourage the learning of cross-modal features. Two setups for TIRG are available based on whether to inject text features at the last FC-layer (default), or the last convolution layer (LastConv). We test both setups. MAAF  is specifically designed for composed image retrieval with state-of-the-art performance. By default, it treats the convolutional spatial image features and the learned text embeddings (randomly initialized with LSTM ) as modality-agnostic tokens, which are passed to a Transformer . We evaluate three design choices that were originally reported with comparable results: (+BERT) pretrained context-aware word representations using BERT , (-IT) removing the output of text tokens in the last pooling layer, (-RP) substituting the final resolution-wise pooling with average pooling. For comparison, we also evaluate the following baselines, implemented by Vo et al. [ref]40: Random (theoretical): theoretical random guess. Random (init. ResNet): pretrained ImageNet  features, but random weights for others parameters. Image and text-only: substituting the combined image-text feature with the reference image or text feature. Random image with text: randomly sampling images to pair with text during training and validation. Concatenation: replacing the image-text composition layer with a simple concatenation of features followed by a 2-layer perceptron with ReLU. For Fashion-IQ, we additionally include published results from the following methods: MRN  uses stacked blocks of element-wise products with residual learning to embed V&L jointly. FiLM  modulates the image feature map conditioned on text features after the layers of CNN. Relationship  learns the joint embeddings through relationship features constructed by concatenating the image and text features followed by FC-layers. VAL  is specially designed for composed image retrieval, which adopts the Transformer to compose multi-level V&L joint representations. For images with text descriptions as side information, an additional visual-semantic loss is applied to align visual features and the corresponding text features.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: For CIRR, we evaluate the following methods using publicly available implementations222https://github.com/google/tirg, https://github.com/yahoo/maaf: TIRG [ref]40 is an image-text composition model for composed image retrieval, which has proven to be effective on multiple datasets  [ref]13 [ref]40 [ref]18.
