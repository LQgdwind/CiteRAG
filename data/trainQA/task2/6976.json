Unleash Mathematical Reasoning of Large Language Models with Monte Carlo Tree Search Guided by Energy Function\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLLMs have achieved substantial advancements on various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. These models are first pretrained on the hundreds of billions tokens, which equips them with substantial common sense and knowledge to solve several problems. Due to the complexity and diversity of reasoning tasks, LLMs struggle to solve these tasks accurately, which include common-sense reasoning , logical reasoning [ref]38, and mathematical reasoning [ref]39     that often requires to understand mathematical concepts, computation and multi-step reasoning. To enhance the mathematical reasoning ability of LLMs, numerous methods have been proposed.   proposed CoT demonstrating its capability to empower LLMs with fine-grained reasoning ability to decompose complex questions into sequential intermediate steps.  [ref]13 further suggest the exploration of diverse inference paths throughout the reasoning process with path score or majority voting. Recently,   study the relationship how the pretraining loss, augmented data amount influence the reasoning performances of a LLM. They propose a rejection-sampling method to generate augment data to supervised training of Llama 2 and achieves improvments on GSM8k.   furhter propose a reinforcement learning to augment LLM with more powerful mathematical reasoning ability. The key idea is to apply Reinforcement Learning from Evol-Instruct Feedback (RLEIF) to make a better alignment to mathematical reasoning tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: knowledge to solve several problems.
