S𝑆S is a set of states; A𝐴A is a set of actions; the transition probabilities T:S×A×S→[ref]0 [ref]1:𝑇→𝑆𝐴𝑆01T:S\\times A\\times S\\to[ref]0 [ref]1 defines the probability of the environment transitioning from state s𝑠s to s′superscript𝑠′s^{\\prime} given that the agent acts with action a𝑎a; the reward function R:S×A→ℝ:𝑅→𝑆𝐴ℝR:S\\times A\\to\\mathbb{R} maps a state-action transition to a real number; and 0≤γ≤10𝛾10\\leq\\gamma\\leq 1 is the discount factor, which controls how much an agent should prefer rewards sooner rather than later. The performance a policy, defined by π​(a|s)𝜋conditional𝑎𝑠\\pi(a|s), is typically measured using the cumulative discounted return ∑tγt​rtsubscript𝑡superscript𝛾𝑡subscript𝑟𝑡\\sum_{t}\\gamma^{t}r_{t} that the policy achieves in an episode. Central to our work is algorithms that do reinforcement learning via supervised learning (RvS) such as Decision Transformer [ref]1. These approaches train a model using supervised learning on a dataset of trajectories to predict p𝒟​(a|s,R)subscript𝑝𝒟conditional𝑎𝑠𝑅p_{\\mathcal{D}}(a|s,R) - the probability of next action conditioned on the current state and on the agent getting a cumulative discounted return R=∑tγt​rt𝑅subscript𝑡superscript𝛾𝑡subscript𝑟𝑡R=\\sum_{t}\\gamma^{t}r_{t}. At evaluation time, the model is conditioned on a desired target return and the agent takes the actions predicted by the model. To understand the problem with RvS in stochastic environments, we build off of a general framework where a goal is presented to a policy, the policy acts in the environment, and the agent is scored on how well the goal was achieved as described in Furuta et al. [ref]18. Mathematically, the agent’s objective can be expressed as minimizing some distance metric D​(⋅,⋅)𝐷⋅⋅D(\\cdot,\\cdot) between a target goal z𝑧z and the information statistics I​(τ)𝐼𝜏I(\\tau) of the trajectory generated by a conditional policy π​(a|s,z)𝜋conditional𝑎𝑠𝑧\\pi(a|s,z): where p​(z)𝑝𝑧p(z) is the goal distribution, pπz​(τ)subscript𝑝subscript𝜋𝑧𝜏p_{\\pi_{z}}(\\tau) is the trajectory distribution (s1,a1,s2,a2,…)subscript𝑠1subscript𝑎1subscript𝑠2subscript𝑎2…(s_{1},a_{1},s_{2},a_{2},\\ldots) obtained by running rollouts in an MDP following policy π​(a|s,z)𝜋conditional𝑎𝑠𝑧\\pi(a|s,z). In this section, we refer to the goal presented to an agent as z𝑧z and the function that calculates which goal was achieved in a particular trajectory τ𝜏\\tau as its statistics I​(τ)𝐼𝜏I(\\tau). As discussed in Furuta et al. [ref]18, this framework includes a number of popular algorithms, including RvS algorithms that condition on target returns (e.g., [ref]1   ) or goals (e.g.,  ). For example, in Decision Transformer [ref]1 cumulative discounted reward is used as the trajectory statistics I​(τ)=∑tγt​rt𝐼𝜏subscript𝑡superscript𝛾𝑡subscript𝑟𝑡I(\\tau)=\\sum_{t}\\gamma^{t}r_{t} and a reasonable choice for D​(⋅,⋅)𝐷⋅⋅D(\\cdot,\\cdot) could be the squared error between the target and achieved return. Furuta et al. [ref]18 justify using the supervised learning approach (RvS) to minimize Equation 2.1 by claiming that trajectories with statistics I​(τ)𝐼𝜏I(\\tau) act as optimal examples of how to act to achieve D​(I​(τ),z)=0𝐷𝐼𝜏𝑧0D(I(\\tau),z)=0 for an agent whose goal is to achieve z=I​(τ)𝑧𝐼𝜏z=I(\\tau). However, in stochastic environments, the actions taken in these trajectories may not be optimal since a trajectory may achieve a goal due to uncontrollable randomness in the environment rather than from the agent’s own actions. In fact, as discussed in Paster et al. , not only can the actions taken in these “optimal trajectories” actually be sub-optimal, but they can be arbitrarily bad depending on the policy used to collect the data, the environment dynamics, and the choice of distance metric. In this section, we propose to sidestep this issue by limiting the types of statistics I​(τ)𝐼𝜏I(\\tau) we are interested in to those that are not affected by uncontrollable randomness in the environment. We show first that RvS policies trained to reach such goals, under the assumption of infinite data and model capacity, learn optimal policies for achieving such goals and that goals that are independent from environment stochasticity are the only goals that RvS can reliably achieve. Importantly, we argue that limiting the form of trajectory statistics I​(τ)𝐼𝜏I(\\tau) in this way is not prohibitive and that desirable quantities can be transformed to fit this property in an intuitive way (e.g., return turns into expected return when optimized to be independent of environment stochasticity). Finally, we propose an approach for automatically finding such trajectory statistics using adversarial learning.\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: We model the environment as an MDP, defined as the tuple (S,A,T,R,γ)𝑆𝐴𝑇𝑅𝛾(S,A,T,R,\\gamma).
