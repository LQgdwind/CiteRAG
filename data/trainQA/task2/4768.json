      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-Agent Chance-Constrained Stochastic Shortest Path with Application to Risk-Aware Intelligent Intersection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nParallel to the aforementioned centralized planners, a separate line of research has been devoted to developing decentralized intersection management schemes resting on Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication. For instance, the works in  [ref]20 present game-theoretic decentralized approaches in the context of platooning so as to optimize traffic flow under several scenarios, including intersections. Chandra et.al.  propose a game-theoretic approach for unsignaled intersections, where priory is defined based on the driver’s behavior (aggressive having higher priority).\nZhang et.al.  present a decentralized priority-based intersection system for cooperative AVs. The system incorporates three levels of planning; the first level is based on FCFS for vehicles at the intersection zone, the second considers AVs followed by emergency AVs arriving at the intersection (far zone) by scheduling their arrival time accordingly, and the third level is for the lowest priorities. However, unlike their centralized counterparts, decentralized schemes could inflict diminished system-wide controllability and efficiency, let alone communication overheads. In this work, we focus on the centralized case, with V2I communication, allowing the system to achieve better overall global optimality. An essential component of autonomous vehicle planning is uncertainty estimation in the environment. In particular, we are interested in tactical-decision making in the presence of uncertainty in HVs’ intentions  and tracking error, where AVs may not be able to follow precisely a reference trajectory, mainly due to control uncertainty. Also, AVs from different vendors may run different controllers, hence have trajectory variations from the same reference trajectory. To cope with uncertainty in AVs’ tactical decision-making, several works in the literature model the problem as Markov decision process variants. Brechtel et al.  model the decision-making problem as a continuous state partially observable MDP (POMDP), where observation stochasticity resembles perception noise (e.g., LiDAR point cloud noise). Hong et al.  model intention recognition of human-driven vehicles as hidden state variables in POMDP.\nBesides optimizing an objective function in POMDPs, [ref]14  consider an additional chance constraint that bounds the collision probability below a safety threshold.\nArguably, with a properly modeled state space, as we illustrate in this work, the driving problem can be modeled as a fully observable chance-constrained MDP, which is more scalable than the POMDP counterpart. MDP  is a widely used model for planning under uncertainty.\nMoreover, the problem has a dual linear programming (LP) formulation  which solves the problem as a minimum cost flow problem also known as the Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problem.\nA special class of MDP optimizes an objective function while also bounding the probability of constraint violations is often called chance-constrained MDP (CC-MDP)  which is an NP-Hard problem. To reduce the problem, an approximation of the chance constraint using Markov’s inequality was proposed by , effectively converting the problem into an MDP with a secondary cost function, called constrained MDP (C-MDP). Another approach  applies Hoeffding’s inequality to improve the approximation. Both methods provide conservative policies with respect to safety thresholds. Exact methods for solving CC-MDP rely on those used for the partially observable MDPs (CC-POMDP)  . However, even for a single agent, such methods suffer from scalability. They require full history enumeration in the worst case, which makes the solution space exponentially large with respect to the planning horizon . To the best of our knowledge, our technique, even for the single-agent case, is the first exact method for solving CC-MDPs that does not require history enumeration. Also, our method extends the approximate method , which considers independent agents with a shared risk budget, to situations where agents can interact at specific locations.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: planners, a separate line of research has been devoted to developing decentralized intersection management schemes resting on Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication.
