      "content": "Paper Title: AniGAN: Style-Guided Generative Adversarial Networks for Unsupervised Anime Face Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nReference Animations play an important role in our daily life and have been widely used in entertainment, social, and educational applications. Recently, anime, aka Japan-animation, has been popular in social media platforms. Many people would like to transfer their profile photos into anime images, whose styles are similar to that of the roles in\ntheir favorite animations such as Cardcaptor Sakura and Sailor Moon. However, commercial image editing software fails to do this transfer, while manually producing an anime image in specific styles needs professional skills. In this paper, we aim to automatically translate a photo-face into an anime-face based on the styles of a reference anime-face. We refer to such a task as Style-Guided Face-to-Anime Translation (StyleFAT). Inspired by the advances of generative adversarial networks (GANs) , many GAN-based methods (e.g.,  [ref]24  [ref]45) have been proposed to automatically translate images between two domains.\nHowever, these methods  [ref]30 focused on learning one-to-one mapping between the source and target images, which does not transfer the information of the reference image into a generated image.\nConsequently, the styles of their generated anime-faces  [ref]30 are usually dissimilar from that of the reference ones. Recently, a few reference-guided methods   were proposed for multi-modal translation which generates diverse results by additionally taking reference images from the target domain as input.\nThese methods, however, usually fail to fulfill the StyleFAT task and generate low-quality anime images. Different from the image translation tasks of reference-guided methods, StyleFAT poses new challenges in two aspects. First, an anime-face usually has large eyes, a tiny nose, and a small mouth which are dissimilar from natural ones. The significant variations of shapes/appearances between anime-faces and photo-faces require\ntranslation methods to largely overdraw the local structures (e.g., eyes and mouth) of a photo-face, different from caricature translation  and makeup-face transfer    which preserve the identity of a photo-face.\nSince most reference-guided methods are designed to preserve the local structures/identity of a source image, these methods not only poorly transform the local shapes of facial parts into anime-like ones, but also fail to make the these local shapes style-consistent with the reference anime-face. On the other hand, simultaneously transforming local shapes and transferring anime styles is challenging and has not yet been well explored.\nSecond, anime-faces involve various appearances and styles (e.g. various hair textures and drawing styles). Such large intra-domain variations poses challenges in devising a generator to translate a photo-face into a specific-style anime-face, as well as in training a discriminator to capture the distributions of anime-faces. To address the above problems, we propose a novel GAN-based model called AniGAN for StyleFAT. First,\nsince it is difficult to collect pairs of photo-faces and anime-faces, we train AniGAN with unpaired data in an unsupervised manner.\nSecond, we propose a new generator architecture that preserves the global information (e.g., pose) of a source photo-face, while transforming local facial shapes into anime-like ones and transferring colors/textures based on the style of a reference anime-face. The proposed generator does not rely on face landmark detection or face parsing. Our insight is that\nthe local shapes (e.g., large and round eyes) can be treated as a kind of styles like color/texture. In this way, transforming a faceâ€™s local shapes can be achieved via style transfer. To transform local facial shapes via style transfer, we explore where to inject the style information into the generator. In particular, the multi-layer feature maps extracted by the decoder represent multi-level semantics (i.e., from high-level structural information to low-level textural information). Our generator therefore injects the style information into the multi-level feature maps of the decoder.\nGuided the injected style information and different levels of feature maps, our generator adaptively learns to transfer color/texture styles and transform local facial shapes.\nFurthermore, two normalization functions are proposed for the generator to further improve local shape transformation and color/texture style transfer. In addition to the generator, we propose a double-branch discriminator, that explicitly considers large appearance variations between photo-faces and anime-faces as well as variations among anime images.\nThe double-branch discriminator not only learns domain-specific distributions by two branches of convolutional layers, but also learns the distributions of a common space across domains by shared shallow layers, so as to mitigate artifacts in generated faces. Meanwhile, a domain-aware feature matching loss is proposed to reduce artifacts of generated images by exploiting domain information in the branches. Our major contributions are summarized as follows: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the style-guided face-to-anime translation task. We propose a new generator to simultaneously transfer color/texture styles and transform the local facial shapes of a source photo-face into their anime-like counterparts based on the style of a reference anime-face, while preserving the global structure of the source photo-face. We devise a novel discriminator to help synthesize high-quality anime-faces via learning domain-specific distributions, while effectively avoiding noticeable distortions in generated faces via learning cross-domain shared distributions between anime-faces and photo-faces. Our new normalization functions improve the visual qualities of generated anime-faces in terms of transforming local shapes and transferring anime styles.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: anime-face.
