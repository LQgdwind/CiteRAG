      "content": "Paper Title: Generalized One-shot Domain Adaptation of Generative Adversarial Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGAN adaptation leverages the knowledge stored in pre-trained GANs to mitigate the lack of data and speed up the training on a new domain. [ref]42 is the first to study and evaluate different adapting strategies. It shows that transferring both pre-trained generator and discriminator can improve the convergence time and the quality of the generated images. Since then, more and more adapting strategies     are proposed for\nvarious GAN architectures   . As StyleGAN  and its variants   continue to make breakthrough progress in the generation of various classes of data, designing the adapted strategies of StyleGAN has gained a lot and sustained attention. Specifically,   have explored the zero-shot GAN adaptation, which transfers StyleGAN into the target domain defined by the text prompts with the help of CLIP .  [ref]29     study to transfer the StyleGAN to the domain defined by the given few-shot images. Among the above works, our work has a close relation to FSGA [ref]29, which proposes the cross-domain consistency (CDC) loss to maintain the diversity of the source generator, and makes the transferred and source samples have a corresponding relation. Although CDC loss is ineffective for FSGA when the training data is only one-shot, its mechanism inspires us to consider a more effective regularization to maintain the relation, which will be discussed in Sec. 4.4. Recently,   [ref]9  have explored the one-shot adaptation task.   align the adapted samples and reference image in the CLIP feature space. [ref]9 learns a style mapper by constructing a substantial paired dataset.  introduces the extra latent mapper and classifier to the original GAN. In contrast, we focus on both style and entity adaptation which has never been studied before. And we prove that under the decoupling of style and entity, aligning the internal distributions with the proper regularization is effective for GAN adaptation.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: GAN adaptation leverages the knowledge stored in pre-trained GANs to mitigate the lack of data and speed up the training on a new domain.
