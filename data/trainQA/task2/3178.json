We limit the runtime to 48 hours. All methods considered in this study, with the exception of the FV method that uses Ansys Fluent¬†, and FD-FLIP, are part of the PolyFEM library 0, and use Pardiso¬†  [ref]8 direct solver. We use the pressure-based solver and the laminar model in Ansys Fluent¬†. The coupled scheme is used for the pressure-velocity coupling. For the spatial discretization, we use the least square cell-based scheme for gradients, the second-order scheme for pressure, and the second-order upwind scheme for momentum. We use the second-order implicit scheme provided in Fluent as the transient formulation. The convergence criteria is set to 10‚àí6superscript10610^{-6} for the continuity and velocity residual. Other parameters are set to default values. The non-linear equation is solved via Newton‚Äôs method, whose tolerance is set to 10‚àí8superscript10810^{-8}. To ease convergence, we first use Picard iterations¬† up to 10‚àí3superscript10310^{-3} tolerance. We briefly overview 3,\nfocusing on the specific discretization choices that we use in our comparison.\nFor time step nùëõn with velocity unsuperscriptùë¢ùëõu^{n}, the advection step aims at integrating over time by Œî‚ÄãtŒîùë°\\Delta t to obtain an intermediate velocity u¬Ønsuperscript¬Øùë¢ùëõ\\bar{u}^{n}, where semi-Lagrangian-type methods  [ref]39   or particle-in-cell methods  0   are often applied.\nAfter advection, body forces are integrated into the velocity field via the forward Euler scheme. The diffusion step resolves the viscosity terms (smoothing the current velocity field) and obtains u~nsuperscript~ùë¢ùëõ\\tilde{u}^{n} via Finally, the pressure projection step projects the velocity field back to a divergence-free state: We use the P1subscriptùëÉ1P_{1} or Q1subscriptùëÑ1Q_{1} basis for both velocity and pressure in the FEM discretization. The advection requires to find the element containing a given point and compute its local coordinates in that element. We use spatial hashing¬† to identify a small set of candidate elements. We then compute the local coordinates with respect to each, and identify the element for which these are within the valid [ref]0 01[ref]0  range. For triangular and tetrahedral meshes, local coordinates are computed by solving a small linear system; for quadrilateral and hexahedral meshes, the bi-linear and tri-linear map is inverted using Newton‚Äôs method. In the pressure projection step, we solve the Laplacian equation by FE to get the pressure field. We then compute the gradient of pressure at each node by averaging the gradient in all adjacent elements. FLIP is used for advection, where the specific ODE per FLIP particle is solved via RK-3. During the RK-3 solve, when velocity is queried at a point outside of the domain, we project the sample point to the closest point on the domain boundary to interpolate velocity.\nIf a FLIP particle goes outside of domain, we simply ignore its contribution. As FLIP particle resampling is performed at the beginning of each time step to ensure 2dsuperscript2ùëë2^{d} particles per cell (d=2ùëë2d=2 or 333 is the dimension of space), a nearly uniform particle distribution is always maintained at the expense of introducing a small amount of random noise. After advection, Dirichlet boundary conditions are enforced by overwriting the boundary velocities. Diffusion and pressure projection linear systems are solved using Pardiso¬†  [ref]8. For diffusion, velocities are the unknowns; we enforce boundary conditions with linear equality constraints, requiring the boundary velocity DOF at the face centers and the boundary velocity interpolation at the edge centers are all equal to the prescribed values.\nOn the other hand, boundary conditions in the pressure projection system follows the standard scheme¬†3: a volume fraction weighted gradient operator is applied to better resolve solid boundaries that are not grid-aligned.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: We limit the runtime to 48 hours.
