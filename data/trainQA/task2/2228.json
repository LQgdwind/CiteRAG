      "content": "Paper Title: Fingerprinting Generative Adversarial Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe conduct comprehensive experiments to validate that our concrete designs can meet the strong fingerprint requirements in Section IV-A. We report the main results, and a plethora of experimental results can be found in Appendix G-B. Model and dataset. Our scheme can be applied to general image-to-image translation GAN models and tasks, since the design does not rely on any assumptions about datasets, model architectures or parameters. Without loss of generality, we employ three mainstream GANs (i.e., AttGAN [ref]4, StarGAN , and STGAN ) for evaluations, all of which take a face image as input, and produce an image with modified attributes specified by the user. We train each model to edit five attributes: (A1) black hair, (A2) blond hair, (A3) brown hair, (A4) male and (A5) young. We adopt a public dataset CelebA [ref]35, which is a standard benchmark dataset used in this area. Scheme implementation.\nIn our experiments, the property classifier f𝑓f is implemented by ResNet34 .\nWe train f𝑓f as a multi-label classifier on the CelebA dataset to predict the facial attributes. Each sample in CelebA has 404040 annotated attributes. Then the output of f𝑓f is a 40-bit vector, with each bit representing whether the image has the corresponding attribute. Note that the construction of f𝑓f is general, so other mainstream classification models can be applied to our task. We compare the time cost of training a GAN and generating verification samples for it in Appendix H. For 𝐅𝐠𝐞𝐧subscript𝐅𝐠𝐞𝐧\\mathbf{F_{gen}} in Algorithm 1,\nwe select 100 random samples from CelebA as the verification sample set V𝑉V.\nFor each sample, we set its unique verification label VL​(x)subscript𝑉𝐿𝑥V_{L}(x) by flipping each bit in its ground-truth label vector. We minimize Fo​b​jsubscript𝐹𝑜𝑏𝑗F_{obj} in Equation 2 under the constraint ∥G(v(i)),G(x(i))∥≤δ\\|G(v^{(i)}),G(x^{(i)})\\|\\leq\\delta. We set δ=9​e−4𝛿9superscript𝑒4\\delta=9e^{-4}, which is proven to be sufficient to ensure the indistinguishability between the verification sample and its corresponding clean sample. The generated verification sample set can be used for all the three proposed methods. After V𝑉V is crafted, we keep all the flipped 40 attributes as the verification label for CFP-iBDv1 and CFP-iBDv2. For CFP-AE, we only flip 5 attributes, while the rest attributes are the same as the ground truth. These attributes are selected as the easiest ones to be misclassified by analyzing the decision boundary of the classifier. They are listed in Appendix E. For CFP-AE, we do not need to make any changes to the classifier f𝑓f. For CFP-iBDv1 and CFP-iBDv2, we need to embed the fingerprint into the composite model following 𝐅𝐞𝐦𝐛subscript𝐅𝐞𝐦𝐛\\mathbf{F_{emb}} in Algorithm 2. We fix 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G}, while fine-tuning the classifier f𝑓f using the prepared verification sample set. This will give us the final fingerprint-embedded composite model M^=f^​(G​(⋅))^𝑀^𝑓𝐺⋅\\hat{M}=\\hat{f}({G}(\\cdot)).\nFor 𝐅𝐞𝐦𝐛subscript𝐅𝐞𝐦𝐛\\mathbf{F_{emb}} in Algorithm 2,\nto enhance the robustness of the fingerprinted classifier, we adopt four types of mainstream image transformations (adding noise, blurring, compression and cropping) to augment the verification sample set 𝒱ssubscript𝒱𝑠\\mathcal{V}_{s} and normal sample set 𝒩ssubscript𝒩𝑠\\mathcal{N}_{s}. We fine-tune f𝑓f with only 100 verification samples and 100 normal samples, so it is very efficient for the model owner to annotate these samples. For verification, we query the suspicious GAN model with 100100100 verification samples. Similar to prior works [ref]14    , we empirically set the threshold τ𝜏\\tau for ownership judgement, which is 0.8. Baselines.\nSince there are no existing works for fingerprinting image-to-image translation GAN models, we migrate the fingerprinting strategy from classification models to GANs as our baselines. Past works proposed two types of common techniques to generate adversarial attacks for GAN models, which are adopted for fingerprint generation in our baselines. Specifically, (1) AE-D leverages the distortion attack     , whose outputs are distorted away from the correct one. This is achieved by maximizing the distance between the adversarial output and ground-truth output. During verification, we determine the legitimacy of the suspicious model by measuring the noise ratio of the responses and ground-truth outputs. A model is considered as illegal if the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR)  is smaller than a threshold (202020). (2) AE-I leverages the identity attack  , whose outputs are identical with the inputs. This is achieved by minimizing the distance between the sample outputs and inputs. During verification, we measure the similarity between the verification samples and the corresponding responses. We flag the model as pirated if their Euclidean distance is smaller than a threshold (9​e−49superscript𝑒49e^{-4}). Both types of adversarial examples are generated by C&W , which is also used in  for fingerprinting classification models. Metrics.\nWe introduce two metrics: (1) Match Score for Verification samples (MSV) denotes the match ratio of verification labels for verification samples; (2) Match Score for Clean samples (MSC) denotes the match ratio of ground-truth labels for clean samples. For a good fingerprinting method, the target model should have high MSV and MSC, while the MSV on unrelated models should be low.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: GAN models and tasks, since the design does not rely on any assumptions about datasets, model architectures or parameters.
