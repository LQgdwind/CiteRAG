      "content": "Paper Title: Generative Joint Source-Channel Coding for Semantic Image Transmission\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCommunication systems are designed and optimized to reliably transmit information from one point to another over noisy communication channels. They consist of three blocks: an encoder at the transmitter, a noisy channel, and a decoder at the receiver. From the first to the fifth generation of communication systems, the encoding process has followed the conventional two-step approach of Shannonâ€™s separation theorem , which decomposes the transmitter into a source encoder and a channel encoder. The former removes the redundant information from the source to allow reconstruction at the desired quality, while the latter protects the compressed information against errors introduced over the wireless channel. Similarly, the receiver consists of source and channel decoders. Shannon proved that separate source and channel coding provides theoretical optimality in the case of infinitely long code blocks. On the other hand, in practical systems that require source transmission under extreme latency, bandwidth, or energy constraints, it is known that the separation approach can be highly suboptimal. Such constraints apply in most emerging applications, such as Internet-of-everything (IoE), vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications, eHealth services, and augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR). Although joint source-channel coding (JSCC) has been known to achieve better performance than separate source compression followed by channel coding, practical design of such joint coding schemes has been a long-standing challenge. Recently, deep learning (DL) based JSCC methods, e.g., DeepJSCC, have shown outstanding results due to their ability to extract complex features from the training data while incorporating the channel characteristics into their encoding implicitly    [ref]5  [ref]7 [ref]8  0. However, these DL-based JSCC methods do not focus on the semantic similarities between the source signal and its reconstruction at the receiver and have mostly considered the mean squared error (MSE) or structured similarity metrics (SSIM/MS-SSIM) as the end-to-end measure of distortion, and the loss function for training. On the other hand, in semantic communications 1, particularly in the context of image/video transmission, the receiver is not necessarily interested in reconstructing the original source signal with minimal distortion. Instead, the receiver may be interested in some downstream task, such as classification 2 3, or retrieval 4, in which case it would be sufficient to only convey the relevant features of the source signal for the prescribed task. Alternatively, for extreme image compression 5, the receiver may be interested in generating an output with the same distribution as the source signal rather than its accurate representation. In image compression literature, this aspect has recently been acknowledged as the perception loss, resulting in the rate-distortion-perception trade-off 6. In general, the perception loss is measured by the divergence between the source and reconstruction distributions and can be minimized in practice using generative adversarial networks (GANs) 7. In this work, we propose two JSCC schemes for wireless image transmission that are designed and optimized to tackle the extreme physical limitations of the environment, while reconstructing an output image that minimizes the desired fidelity measure with respect to the particular input image and looks realistic to human perception. Some examples of the edge cases that can negatively affect the communication overhead are very low bandwidth compression ratio (BCR) and very low channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In classical DeepJSCC, the goal is to reconstruct the source signal, e.g., image, at the receiver with minimum distortion by jointly optimizing the source and the channel coding via deep neural networks (DNNs). However, this often results in a significant loss of perceptual quality for the edge cases. We overcome this by following a context-aware communication approach that utilizes style-based generative adversarial network (StyleGAN) generators as well as distortion metrics that align well with the human perception in our optimizations. Past works on DeepJSCC train the encoder/decoder networks on patches of images from a large dataset, which are then used and evaluated for the transmission of high-resolution images from the Kodak dataset    [ref]5  [ref]7 [ref]8 . It has been observed that the larger and richer the training dataset the better the performance. On the other hand, the performance improves further if the statistics of the training dataset match that of the test images. This is shown in  by training and testing DeepJSCC on satellite images that exhibit a particular statistic, where the gain from DeepJSCC with respect to conventional separation-based approaches becomes even more significant. In our first scenario in this work, we consider a DeepJSCC encoder/decoder pair trained on a generic training dataset, e.g., ImageNet. Later, we are given images from another dataset to be transmitted wirelessly. We assume that the encoder network remains the same, but the decoder can deduce the knowledge of the dataset to improve the quality of the reconstructed images. We propose a novel inverse problem approach for this scenario, called InverseJSCC. InverseJSCC performs denoising on the distorted reconstructions of DeepJSCC by solving an unsupervised inverse problem and recovers a high-quality source image with better perceptual quality. Exploiting the learned distribution for a particular dataset, e.g., face images, we use a DeepJSCC model and a pre-trained StyleGAN-2 8 generator, whose architecture is the SotA for high-quality image generation, to generate new face images that perceptually match the source image. While InverseJSCC significantly improves classical DeepJSCC perceptually, it also allows using any differentiable encoder/decoder pair to reconstruct the noisy images. We also show that, unlike DeepJSCC, InverseJSCC does not lose significant performance when the statistics of the training dataset do not match that of the test images. Next, we consider end-to-end training of the encoder and decoder using the learned distribution. The proposed solution is called GenerativeJSCC, which is composed of an encoder, a non-trainable channel, and a decoder that incorporates residual DNNs and the StyleGAN-2 generator structure. We perform end-to-end training of the encoder/decoder pair of GenerativeJSCC by optimizing a distortion measure that also takes perceptual quality into account.\nOur results show that GenerativeJSCC outperforms classical DeepJSCC in terms of both traditional distortion metrics (e.g., mean-squared error) and perceptual similarity metrics that align with human perception well.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: DeepJSCC, have shown outstanding results due to their ability to extract complex features from the training data while incorporating the channel characteristics into their encoding implicitly    [ref]5  [ref]7 [ref]8  0.
