      "content": "Paper Title: Trust Your Robots! Predictive Uncertainty Estimation of Neural Networks with Sparse Gaussian Processes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis work aims to provide an algorithm that can estimate uncertainty of DNN predictions reliably and fast, and at the same time, is suited for integration into a large range of robotic systems. Generic solutions to this problem are crucial for safe robot learning and introspection  [ref]2, giving the robots with an ability to assess their own failure probabilities and to alter their behaviors towards safety. While the state of the art is advancing [ref]3 [ref]4 , we still face practical difficulties in two main domains. First, the current methods are often not efficient at test-time, e.g. for a single input, the methods require multiple predictions from several copies of a model [ref]4 or samples from the modelâ€™s distribution [ref]3. And second, in general these methods do not provide reliable uncertainty estimates when compared to GPs - often known as the golden standard of probabilistic machine learning  . Therefore, we propose to estimate the predictive uncertainty of DNNs using MoE-GPs   - a sparse variant of GPs that divides the input space into smaller local regions using a gating function, where individual GPs called experts learn and make predictions (see figure 1). To do so, we provide both theoretic foundations and a practical learning algorithm. First, we formally derive a connection between DNNs and MoE-GPs. As a result, we reveal how MoE-GPs with a DNN-based kernel 0 can provably approximate uncertainty in DNNs. Moreover, we devise a learning algorithm that brings the derived theory into practice. Our solution involves a gating function that strictly divides the input data into smaller subsets by performing clustering in kernel space, and we propose the concept of a patchwork prior, mitigating the problem of discontinuity between local GP experts at their boundaries. For efficiency, we further propose to exploit active learning and model compression techniques. Our approach has several favorable features for many classification and regressions tasks in robotics. At run-time, it maintains the predictive power of a DNN, and its uncertainty estimates do not require combining multiple predictions of DNNs. Moreover, we inherit the benefits of MoE-GPs for uncertainty estimates. These include an improved scalability when compared to a GP with the neural tangent kernel 0 (NTK), as well as natural support for distributed training. We contend that such probabilistic methods must run efficiently on a robot and as applicable as the sparse GPs. Therefore, we not only provide ablation studies and evaluations against the state-of-the-art (SOTA), but we also show that our method (i) scales to approximately 2 million data points for the task of learning inverse dynamics, and (ii) on a Jetson TX2 of a MAV, runs more than 12 times faster than the widely used MC-dropout [ref]3, while performing object detection within a scenario for planetary exploration. Contributions In summary, our main contribution is a novel method for estimating predictive uncertainty of DNNs with sparse GPs (section 3.1), backed up by (i) a theoretical connection between DNNs and MoE-GPs (section 3.2), (ii) a learning algorithm for its applicability in practice (section 3.3), and (iii) an exhaustive empirical evaluation that shows the benefits of our approach (section 4).\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: reliably and fast, and at the same time, is suited for integration into a large range of robotic systems.
