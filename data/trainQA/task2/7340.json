      "content": "Paper Title: Diffusion model for relational inference\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA variety of methods have been developed to address the relational inference problem with time series data. We can categorize these methods into three types: model-free descriptive statistics-based (e.g., correlation), model-free information theory-based (e.g., mutual information), and model-based methods (e.g., autoregressive models) [ref]29 [ref]30. Here, we focus on model-based methods implemented with neural networks in machine learning frameworks. Other model-based models often assume deterministic or stochastic dynamical systems models that can reproduce observational data by fitting model parameters [ref]29. Most model-based methods   [ref]13  are grounded in the NRI model proposed by , which integrates a VAE with GNN operations to construct neural representations and learns to predict future dynamics. For example, Chen et al. introduced efficient message-passing mechanisms into the GNNs with structural prior knowledge [ref]13. Later, Banijamali further improved the NRI model by incorporating individualized information with newly introduced private nodes in the graph . Recently, extended frameworks derived from the original NRI model have been presented. For example, Zhang et al. introduced a general framework, Gumbel Graph Network (GGN), consisting of a network generator and a dynamics learner for performing both network interaction inference and time series prediction, which are jointly trained with backpropagation . Wang et al. proposed a novel integration of a Reservoir Computing (RC) model with a VAE for computationally efficient structural inference . Additionally, they explored an active learning strategy combined with Partial Information Decomposition (PID) . We notice that most related works adopt a prediction-based VAE framework. In this work, we present a novel solution to relational inference from time series data. Our work leverages a diffusion model for time series imputation in combination with an interaction estimation process.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: into three types: model-free descriptive statistics-based (e.g., correlation), model-free information theory-based (e.g., mutual information), and model-based methods (e.g., autoregressive models) [ref]29 [ref]30.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
