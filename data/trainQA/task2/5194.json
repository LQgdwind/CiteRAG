      "content": "Paper Title: High-Fidelity Guided Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGAN-based methods have been extensively explored for performing guided image synthesis from coarse user scribbles. 4 [ref]1   9  9 use GAN-inversion for projecting user scribbles on to manifold of real images. While good for performing small scale inferences these methods fail to generate\nhighly\nphotorealistic outputs when the given stroke image is too far from the real image manifold.\nConditional GANs\n6     2 8\nlearn to directly generate realistic outputs based on user-editable semantic segmentation maps.\nIn another work, Singh et al. 6 propose\nan image\nsynthesis framework which leverages autonomous painting agents 4 5 0  for inferring photorealistic outputs from rudimentary user scribbles.\nDespite its efficacy, this requires the creation of a new dataset and conditional training for each target domain, which is expensive. Guided image synthesis with LLI models 0 5 2 8   \nhas gained widespread attention  1  3   1 due to their ability to perform high quality image generation from diverse target modalities.\nOf particular interest are works wherein the guidance is provided using a coarse stroke painting and the model learns to generate outputs conditioned on both text and painting.\nCurrent works in this direction typically 1) use semantic segmentation based conditional training 0   which is expensive, or, 2) adopt an inversion-based approach for mapping the input stroke painting to the target data manifold without requiring paired annotations. For instance,\nMeng et al. 3  propose\nguided image synthesis framework,\nwherein the generative prior is introduced by simply considering a noisy version of the original sketch input as the start of the reverse diffusion process.\nChoi et al.  propose an iterative conditioning strategy wherein the intermediate diffusion outputs are successively refined to move towards the reference image. While effective, the use of an inversion-like approach causes an implicit domain shift problem, wherein the output images though faithful to the provided reference show blurry or less textured details. Iteratively reperforming\nguided synthesis with generated outputs  seems to\nimprove realism but it is costly. In contrast, we show that it is possible to perform highly photorealistic image synthesis while just requiring a single reverse diffusion pass. Cross-attention control. Recently, Hertz et al.  propose a prompt-to-prompt image editing approach with text-conditioned diffusion models. By constraining the cross-attention features of all non-targeted text tokens to remain the same, they show that by only modifying the text prompt, it is possible to perform diverse image editing without changing the underlying structure of the original input image. In contrast, we use cross-attention control for from-scratch synthesis and show that by simply defining a cross-attention based correspondence between input text tokens and the user stroke-painting, it is possible to control and define the fine-grain semantics of different painted regions.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: GAN-based methods have been extensively explored for performing guided image synthesis from coarse user scribbles. 4 [ref]1   9  9 use GAN-inversion for projecting user scribbles on to manifold of real images.
