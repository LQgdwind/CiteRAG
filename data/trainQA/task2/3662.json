      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Hardware Acceleration of Sparsely Active Convolutional Spiking Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nArtificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have become the go-to solution for many machine learning problems [ref]1 . Generally, ANNs start to outperform conventional machine learning approaches when large amounts of training data are available . However, this performance comes at a significant computational cost. For example, the ANN model ResNet-50 requires a total 3.9⋅109⋅3.9superscript1093.9\\cdot 10^{9} operations to process a single 224×224224224224\\times 224 image . Generally, a trend can be observed that ANNs increase in size as their classification accuracy improves and the task at hand gets more complex . This places a heavy load on the underlying compute resources in terms on memory, memory bandwidth and processing power. To satisfy non-functional requirements such as power, throughput and latency, careful co-design of the underlying algorithms and the respective processing hardware is necessary [ref]4 . To find more efficient processing systems, inspiration may come from the most efficient cognitive system known to mankind: the human brain. An emerging trend is to implement dedicated hardware to process biologically inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)       . The term SNN refers to a large set of models that share one property: the outputs of the neurons (activations) are not encoded with real-valued scalars like in standard NNs, but with sequences of binary events called spikes. What makes SNNs interesting from a computational perspective is their inherent event-driven processing: computations need to be performed only when spikes, i.e., events, occur  . To actually achieve a performance advantage compared to standard NNs, three aspects are crucial: The neural code determines how information is encoded with binary spikes. The length of the encoding window and the number of spikes required to encode neuronal activations are the most important determinants of the SNN’s inference speed and efficiency  [ref]16. In general, the higher the spike sparsity, the better. In general, high sparsity in the neuronal output activations requires less computations that need to be performed during inference. While spike sparsity is a nice theoretical property, it is actually very difficult to exploit with standard computer architectures, due to the irregular dataflow associated with it . The output of a spiking neuron does not depend only on its input but also on its internal state called membrane potential. The real-valued membrane potentials need to be stored and thus increase memory requirements which are already very high to begin with. Strategies have to be deployed to multiplex the membrane potential memory to decrease the overall memory footprint. To achieve state-of-the-art classification performance on computer vision tasks, established methods from standard NNs have to be adapted to SNNs. These methods are primarily: convolutional layers and pooling layers. To accelerate such Convolutional Spiking Neural Networks (CSNNs) using specialized hardware, most authors propose large spatial arrays of Processing Elements (PEs)   . Spatial architectures couple PEs in such away that they can exchange intermediate results without having to access a central memory . Typical implementations use either fixed data path connections between the individual PEs (Systolic Arrays)  or Network-on-Chips (NoCs) that feature a highly flexible packet-based interconnect  .\nSystolic arrays are excellent for performing convolutions in cases where dataflow is easily predictable, i.e., in low sparsity situations 0. NoCs are better at handling unpredictable dataflows since they allow balancing the workload over the different PEs. This comes at the cost of the more expensive NoC communication infrastructure for implementing routers and control circuitry.\nThe major downside of such spatial architectures is that most PEs are left idle if highly sparse activations have to be processed. However, idle PEs still consume power due to leakage and clock switching (the latter only applies for synchronous implementations). Furthermore, idle PEs are not contributing to the end result and are thus wasting chip area. This is complicated by the fact that activation sparsity and the associated irregular dataflow cannot be predicted a priori [ref]4 1. Consequently, the non-trivial task of mapping neural operations to PEs must be performed at run-time.\nThe main contributions of this paper are as follows: A non-spatial hardware architecture optimized for sparse event-based spike processing using a highly efficient neural code. A sequential processing scheme that allows the memory for storing the membrane potentials to be multiplexed, keeping the memory footprint low. The introduction of a novel memory mapping scheme called memory interlacing that allows a highly parallel, fine grained and high-bandwidth distribution of on-chip RAM. A queue-based self-timed processing to enable a maximal utilization of PEs, because skipping zero-activations is inherent to the dataflow of the architecture. This allows the execution time to scale directly with the number of spikes. The core idea is to employ less PEs but to maximize their utilization.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have become the go-to solution for many machine learning problems [ref]1 .
