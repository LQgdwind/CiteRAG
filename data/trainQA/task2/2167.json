      "content": "Paper Title: S2 Engine: A Novel Systolic Architecture for Sparse Convolutional Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConvolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made remarkable success in modern artificial intelligence (AI) applications .\nThe required training data size and model complexity, however, keep increasing for better performance in a large variety of applications.\nThe incurred high computational cost and data movement bandwidth are hardly supported by conventional computing platforms and hence, motivating recent huge investment on the corresponding accelerators .\nAmong these designs, systolic architecture  – a specialized processing element network designed for massive parallelization and extensive data reuse, has been proved efficient in performing CNN computations.\nIn addition to academic research [ref]4 , systolic architectures were also adopted in some industrial practices of deep neural network (DNN) accelerators    [ref]9. The highly regularized layout and internal data movement path of systolic arrays make engineering realization of the design very efficient. However, such a regularity also prevents exploiting irregular computation patterns that frequently appear in sparse CNNs.\nSparsity of deep CNNs has been proven important to minimize computation workloads and model size 0 1 2.\nState-of-the-art pruning algorithms can reduce the model size by >10×>10\\times 3 and computational cost by >4×>4\\times 1 with negligible accuracy loss.\nHowever, due to the large variety of the irregularities, the sparsity is not fully exploited by the existing accelerators and introduces significant design overheads.\nFor example, Cambricon-X only considers the weight sparsity 4 while Cnvlutin only deploys the feature sparsity 5.\nCambricon-S can fully deploy both the weight and feature sparsity but requires the sparsity pattern to be coarse-grained, which greatly limits the application scope 6.\nSCNN supports fine-grained sparsity in both feature and weight but introduces significant computational overhead due to the required additional coordinates transformation 7.\nSparTen 8 also utilizes both feature and weight sparsity, but the energy efficiency is significantly degraded due to the required additional logic for inner-join operations. In this work, we propose S 2  Engine – a novel Systolic architecture for Sparse convolutional neural networks.\nDifferent from the existing systolic approaches [ref]4 , compressed feature and weight flows are fed into the systolic array and the aligned pairs can be dynamically selected from the compressed dataflow by each processing element (PE).\nOur approach solves the contradiction between the regularity of data transmission and the irregularity of sparsity such that the sparsity in CNNs can be fully exploited.\nData reuse could be efficiently implemented in S 2 Engine by introducing an associated collective element (CE) array for the PE array to reduce external buffer access.\nFurthermore, fine-grained mixed-precision data processing is also supported by S 2 Engine to satisfy the varying precision requirement of CNNs even within the same kernel 9.\nExperimental results show that S 2 Engine can achieve about 3.2×3.2\\times speedup and about 3.0×3.0\\times energy efficiency improvement compared with the existing systolic approaches. The main contributions of our work are: We propose a novel systolic architecture, namely, S 2 Engine. By allowing each PE to select the aligned data pairs dynamically from the compressed dataflows, S 2 Engine could fully exploit the sparsity during the execution of CNNs with low overhead. We introduce a collective element (CE) array to further allow data reuse during convolution procedures. This technique also works for native systolic array. S 2 Engine solves the contradiction between the regularity of data transmission and the irregularity of sparsity, showing good robustness for different sparsity degrees. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a preliminary on CNN sparsity and a brief introduction of systolic architecture for CNN accelerators. Section 3 discusses the motivation of our design by considering data reuse manner and sparsity irregularities in CNNs. Section 4 illustrates the detailed architectures of proposed S 2 Engine. Section 5 explains the experimental methodology and Section 6 presents the experimental results. Several related works are discussed in Section 7, and concluding remarks are given in Section 8.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: – a specialized processing element network designed for massive parallelization and extensive data reuse, has been proved efficient in performing CNN computations.\nIn addition to academic research [ref]4 , systolic architectures were also adopted in some industrial practices of deep neural network (DNN) accelerators    [ref]9.
