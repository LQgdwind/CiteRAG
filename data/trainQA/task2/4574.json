Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11.

Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: MemoNav: Selecting Informative Memories for Visual Navigation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare the proposed model with baselines that also utilize memory mechanisms. Random is an agent taking random actions with oracle stopping. ANS [ref]8 and Exp4nav  are metric map-based models proposed for the task of exploration. They are adapted for ImageNav in the experiments of VGM [ref]20. SMT  stacks past observations in chronological order and uses a Transformer decoder to further process them. Neural Planner [ref]4 needs to explore the scene first to pre-build a topological map. Once the map is built, this method performs a hierarchical planning strategy to generate navigation actions. NTS  incrementally builds a topological map without pre-exploring. Its navigation strategy follows two steps: a global policy samples a subgoal, and then a local policy takes navigational actions to reach the subgoal. VGM [ref]20 (see Section 3.2) is the baseline the MemoNav is built on. The quantitative results of these baselines on 1-goal tasks are from [ref]20. We re-evaluate VGM and report the new results.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: We compare the proposed model with baselines that also utilize memory mechanisms.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
