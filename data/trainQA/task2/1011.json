      "content": "Paper Title: Counting Subgraphs in Degenerate Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur main result in this paper is as follows.\n Assuming Conjecture 1.1, hom-cntHsubscripthom-cnt𝐻\\textsc{hom-cnt}_{H} is hard whenever H𝐻H is not α𝛼\\alpha-acyclic. As mentioned above, Theorem 1 shows that the sufficient condition (for hom-cntHsubscripthom-cnt𝐻\\textsc{hom-cnt}_{H} being easy) supplied by Bressan’s algorithm  is in fact necessary. Thus we obtain the following characterization: hom-cntHsubscripthom-cnt𝐻\\textsc{hom-cnt}_{H} is easy if and only if H𝐻H is α𝛼\\alpha-acyclic. The “only if” part is under Conjecture 1.1. Given Theorem 1, it is natural to ask if there is a cleaner description of the α𝛼\\alpha-acyclic graphs.\nActually, another reason for seeking such a clean description is that in order to prove Theorem 1, it would be desirable to know that graphs that are not α𝛼\\alpha-acyclic have certain easy-to-describe obstructions.\nLuckily (and somewhat surprisingly), we have the following concise equivalent description of the α𝛼\\alpha-acyclic graphs. Throughout the paper, Cksubscript𝐶𝑘C_{k} denotes the cycle of length k𝑘k. For graphs H,H0𝐻subscript𝐻0H,H_{0}, we say that H𝐻H is induced H0subscript𝐻0H_{0}-free if H𝐻H contains no induced copy of H0subscript𝐻0H_{0}. An undirected graph H𝐻H is α𝛼\\alpha-acyclic if and only if H𝐻H is induced Cksubscript𝐶𝑘C_{k}-free for every k≥6𝑘6k\\geq 6. By combining Corollary 2 and Theorem 3, we immediately obtain the following very clean characterization of the graphs H𝐻H for which hom-cntHsubscripthom-cnt𝐻\\textsc{hom-cnt}_{H} is easy. hom-cntHsubscripthom-cnt𝐻\\textsc{hom-cnt}_{H} is easy if and only if H𝐻H is induced Cksubscript𝐶𝑘C_{k}-free for all k≥6𝑘6k\\geq 6. The “only if” part is under Conjecture 1.1. Let us now discuss the ideas that go into the proofs of Theorems 1 and 3.\nThe proof of Theorem 3 relies on a useful characterization of α𝛼\\alpha-acyclic hypergraphs given in  (and stated here as Theorem 8). This characterization asserts that a hypergraph is α𝛼\\alpha-acyclic if and only if it does not contain two certain types of obstructions.\nThese two types of obstructions generalize in different ways the notion of an induced cycle from graphs to hypergraphs.\nThe main difficulty in the proof of Theorem 3 lies in translating these “hypergraph obstructions” into “digraph obstructions”, i.e. recognizing the digraph structures whose reachability hypergraphs correspond to these obstructions. We now move on to discuss the proof of Theorem 1.\nWith Theorem 3 at hand, it is natural to first try and show that hom-cntCksubscripthom-cntsubscript𝐶𝑘\\textsc{hom-cnt}_{C_{k}} is hard for all k≥6𝑘6k\\geq 6. This is indeed accomplished in the following lemma. Assuming Conjecture 1.1, hom-cntCksubscripthom-cntsubscript𝐶𝑘\\textsc{hom-cnt}_{C_{k}} is hard for every k≥6𝑘6k\\geq 6. The proof of Lemma 1.6 works by reducing triangle detection (in general graphs) to the problem of counting colorful Cksubscript𝐶𝑘C_{k}-homomorphisms (in bounded-degeneracy graphs), which is in turn reduced to hom-cntCksubscripthom-cntsubscript𝐶𝑘\\textsc{hom-cnt}_{C_{k}}. The remaining ingredient in the proof of Theorem 1 is the following lemma, which states that if hom-cntHsubscripthom-cnt𝐻\\textsc{hom-cnt}_{H} is easy then so is hom-cntH′subscripthom-cntsuperscript𝐻′\\textsc{hom-cnt}_{H^{\\prime}} for every induced subgraph H′superscript𝐻′H^{\\prime} of H𝐻H.\nIt is easy to see that the combination of Theorem 3 and Lemmas 1.6 and 1.7 implies Theorem 1. If hom-cntHsubscripthom-cnt𝐻\\textsc{hom-cnt}_{H} is easy, then hom-cntH′subscripthom-cntsuperscript𝐻′\\textsc{hom-cnt}_{H^{\\prime}} is easy for every induced subgraph H′superscript𝐻′H^{\\prime} of H𝐻H. The proof of Lemma 1.7 uses an innovative application of a powerful technique developed recently in several works on homomorphism-counting, see [ref]19 . At the heart of this technique is the observation that for (non-isomorphic) graphs H1,…,Hksubscript𝐻1…subscript𝐻𝑘H_{1},\\dots,H_{k} and non-zero constants c1,…,cksubscript𝑐1…subscript𝑐𝑘c_{1},\\dots,c_{k}, the problem of computing the linear combination c1​hom⁡(H1,⋅)+⋯+ck​hom⁡(Hk,⋅)subscript𝑐1homsubscript𝐻1⋅⋯subscript𝑐𝑘homsubscript𝐻𝑘⋅c_{1}\\hom(H_{1},\\cdot)+\\dots+c_{k}\\hom(H_{k},\\cdot) is as hard as computing hom⁡(Hi,⋅)homsubscript𝐻𝑖⋅\\hom(H_{i},\\cdot) for every 1≤i≤k1𝑖𝑘1\\leq i\\leq k.\nThe proof of this fact (appearing in [ref]19) uses tensor products of graphs and a result of Erdős, Lovász and Spencer  (stated here as Lemma A.2) regarding linear independence of homomorphism counts.\nFor completeness, we present this proof (adapted to the setting of input graphs of bounded degeneracy and stated here as Lemma 4.2) in the appendix. The use of linear combinations of homomorphism-counts plays a crucial role in many of the reductions presented in this paper. Our proof of Lemma 1.7 proceeds by showing that for every graph G𝐺G, one can (efficiently) construct a graph G′superscript𝐺′G^{\\prime} such that hom⁡(H,G′)hom𝐻superscript𝐺′\\hom(H,G^{\\prime}) equals to a linear combination of the homomorphism counts of all induced subgraphs of H𝐻H in G𝐺G.\nUnlike Lemmas 1.8 and 1.9, which are similar (both in their statements and their proofs) to results obtained in [ref]19, Lemma 1.7 is (to the best of our knowledge) a new application of the homomorphism-linear-combination technique. In the next two sections we take advantage of known relations between the subgraph counts hom,inj,indhominjind\\hom,\\mathrm{inj},\\mathrm{ind} in order to derive analogues of Corollary 4 for the problems inj-cnt and ind-cnt. A similar approach was taken in [ref]19.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: induced subgraph H′superscript𝐻′H^{\\prime} of H𝐻H.
