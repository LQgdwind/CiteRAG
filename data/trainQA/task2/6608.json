We combine\n‘Mssubscript𝑀𝑠M_{s}’ and ‘Mtsubscript𝑀𝑡M_{t}’ to form a new multi-scale strategy ‘M-scale’. In addition, we combine ‘Mssubscript𝑀𝑠M_{s}’, ‘Mtsubscript𝑀𝑡M_{t}’, ‘Cssubscript𝐶𝑠C_{s}’, and ‘Ctsubscript𝐶𝑡C_{t}’ to form another new strategy ‘M&C-scale’ that matches spatial and temporal features simultaneously at multiple scales and also cross scales. We compare our method with two groups of state-of-the-art methods on one-shot skeleton action recognition. The first group consists of state-of-the-art few-shot image classification methods including Subspace , ProtoNet [ref]32, Dynamic Filter , FEAT . All these methods use the same embedding network as our method for fair comparisons. We re-implement  [ref]32   based on publicly available codes and conduct experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD datasets. The implementation details are available in the appendix.\nThe second group consists of state-of-the-art one-shot skeleton action recognition techniques including APSR [ref]1, TCN , SL-DML [ref]3, Skeleton-DML , uDTW , and JEANIE .\nFor those one-shot skeleton action recognition works [ref]1  [ref]3   , the results in Tabs. I,II,IV are from the original papers.\nWe compare our method with the first group methods under both evaluation protocols, while the second group with Evaluation Protocol 2 only.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: with two groups of state-of-the-art methods on one-shot skeleton action recognition.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
