      "content": "Paper Title: Visually Grounded VQA by Lattice-based Retrieval\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSGG1 handles object detection and provides region-based visual features that are used as basis for modeling attribute and relationship detection (as well as for training other reference VQA models). We use a Faster R-CNN [ref]31 model with ResNet101 [ref]12 backbone and an FPN [ref]26 for region proposals. We build the model using Facebook’s Detectron2 framework . The ResNet101 backbone model was pre-trained on ImageNet .\nWe use the model’s softmax output distributions (a 1702-dim vector for 1702 object classes per detected object) for up to 100 detected objects per image to populate the scene graph. We trained the model for GQA’s 1702 object classes using 75k training images (images in GQA’s train partition). Training lasted for 1m iterations with mini-batch of 4 images, using a multi-step learning rate starting at 0.005, reducing it by a factor of 10 at 700k and again at 900k iterations. No other parameters were changed in the official Detectron2 training recipe for this model architecture. Training took about 7 days on an RTX 2080 Ti. We use the softmax output distribution (a 1702-dim vector for 1702 object classes) for each post-NMS detected object to populate our scene graph. Up to 100 objects per images are selected as follows: per-class NMS is applied at 0.7 IoU for objects that have any softmax object class probability of >0.05absent0.05>0.05. We also use this model to extract 1024-dim object-based visual features, which we use in SGG2&3 (attribute recognition, relationship detection models) and for training other VQA reference models which are used for performance comparisons.\nWe extract these visual features from a layer in the object classification head of the model which acts as input to the final fully-connected softmax-activated output layer. This is done for each surviving object (i.e. for the set of objects determined with per-class NMS and top100 capping). SGG1’s object detection evaluation using metrics222https://cocodataset.org/#detection-eval defined for the COCO dataset  are shown in Table 5. We also include one more data point in Table 5 to share a very rough comparison to UpDn’s  object detection model that was used in many VQA-related works to extract high dimensional visual features. This model was trained on a heavily cleaned subset of Visual Genome  (on which GQA is based) and uses 1600 object classes (results are unpublished, we print the ones listed in UpDn’s official repository ). Object categories take on a central role in the GQA dataset. Many questions refer to objects by their category instead of their object class identity (e.g. “Is someone standing next to the red piece of furniture?”). To determine category recognition scores for detected objects, we simply sum softmax scores of all object classes that belong to the requested category. Like for attribute recognition (see SGG2), we determine the categories, as well as the members (object class names) in each category, based on implicit declarations in GQA. Note that there is no explicit definition of the used categories and their members in GQA given as part of the official annotations, but this information can be inferred by appropriate processing of the Q/A annotation files.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: and provides region-based visual features that are used as basis for modeling attribute and relationship detection (as well as for training other reference VQA models).

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
