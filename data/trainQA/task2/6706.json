      "content": "Paper Title: Revisiting Fully Convolutional Geometric Features for Object 6D Pose Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nObject 6D pose estimation is the problem of finding the Euclidean transformation (i.e. pose) of an object in a scene with respect to the camera frame .\nThis problem is important for autonomous driving , augmented reality , space docking , robot grasping , and active 3D classification .\nThe main challenges are handling occlusions, structural similarities between objects, and non-informative textures.\nDifferent benchmarks have been designed to study these challenges, such as LineMod-Occluded (LMO) , YCB-Video (YCBV) , and T-LESS 4.\nLMO includes poorly-textured objects in scenarios with several occlusions.\nIn YCBV, well-textured objects appear in scenarios with fewer occlusions but more pose variations.\nT-LESS includes poorly-textured and geometrically-similar objects in industrial scenarios with occasional occlusions. whiteCompetitor two-stage approaches whiteOur approach Object 6D pose estimation approaches based on deep learning can be classified as one-stage 7 [ref]26  or two-stage 8 3 2 [ref]39.\nOne-stage approaches can directly regress the object pose 7 [ref]26 .\nTwo-stage approaches can predict 3D keypoints 3 2 or point-level correspondences between the scene and the object [ref]39.\nCorrespondences can be computed through point-level features [ref]39.\nOne-stage approaches are typically more efficient than their two-stage counterpart, as they require only one inference pass. However, rotation regression is a difficult optimisation task because the rotation space is non-Euclidean and non-linear, and the definition of correct orientation is ambiguous in case of symmetric objects .\nOn the other hand, correspondence-based approaches have to be coupled with registration techniques, such as RANSAC, PnP, or least square estimation [ref]39. We argue that the problem of learning discriminative point-level features is overlooked in the related literature.\nMoreover, we believe that working at intermediate levels of representation learning, rather than regressing the pose directly, facilitates interpretability and enables us to effectively debug algorithms.\nLiterature on representation learning for point cloud registration has made great advances  , and none of the object 6D pose estimation methods have deeply investigated the application of these techniques to the underlying problem (Fig. 1).\nIn a landscape dominated by complex networks, our work stands as the first to comprehensively explore and quantify the benefits of this formulation with a simple yet effective solution. Our research addresses fundamental and previously unanswered questions:\ni) How to learn features of heterogeneous point clouds (objects and scenes) that align in the same representation space and exhibit cross-domain generalisation (synthetic to real)?\nii) What training strategies are optimal for this approach?\niii) What degree of improvement can these strategies bring?\nTo answer these questions, we revisit Fully Convolutional Geometric Features (FCGF)  and show that its potential to achieve state-of-the-art results lies in an attentive design of data augmentations, loss negative mining, network architecture, and optimisation strategies.\nFCGF is designed to learn point-level features by using a fully-convolutional network optimised through a hardest contrastive loss.\nCompared to the original FCGF setting, our setting is asymmetric, i.e. the two input point clouds have different sizes and resolutions.\nTherefore, we modify the hardest contrastive loss to take into account the size of each point cloud for the mining of the hardest negatives.\nWe use separate architectures to learn specific features for the two (heterogeneous) input data (object and scene), but unlike several state-of-the-art methods we train only a single model for all the objects of each dataset.\nWe use specific augmentations to tackle occlusions, which are the main challenge in real-world scenarios and in the considered datasets.\nWe name our approach FCGF6D.\nFCGF6D outperforms state-of-the-art methods (+3.5 ADD(S)-0.1d on LMO, +0.8 ADD-S AUC on YCBV), even when comparing with methods that train one model for each object.\nOur ablation study suggests that most of the performance gain is obtained thanks to our changes to the loss, the addition of the RGB information and our changes to the optimizer.\nIn summary, our contributions are: We tailor FCGF for object 6D pose estimation in order to\ni) process entire scenes rather than cropped regions as competitors,\nii) learn a single model for all objects instead of a model for each object,\niii) process both photometric and geometric information with a single unified deep network model. A modified version of the hardest contrastive loss that is applied to heterogeneous point clouds and that considers a geometric constraint when mining the hardest negative. We study data augmentations that enable FCGF to improve generalisation between synthetic and real data.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: industrial scenarios with occasional occlusions. whiteCompetitor two-stage approaches whiteOur approach Object 6D pose estimation approaches based on deep learning can be classified as one-stage 7 [ref]26  or two-stage 8 3 2 [ref]39.\nOne-stage approaches can directly regress the object pose 7 [ref]26 .\nTwo-stage approaches can predict 3D keypoints 3 2 or point-level correspondences between the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
