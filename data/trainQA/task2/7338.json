      "content": "Paper Title: GuReT: Distinguishing Guilt and Regret related Text\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe ReDDIT dataset introduced in [ref]17 , serves as a valuable resource for understanding the expression of regret on social media, particularly on the Reddit platform. This dataset offers a fine-grained analysis of regret, classifying texts into three distinct categories: Regret by Action, Regret by Inaction, and No Regret. The data collection process involved scraping posts from three relevant subreddits, including \\sayregret, \\sayregretfulparents, and \\sayconfession spanning from January 1, 2000, to September 10, 2022. The dataset has undergone a meticulous annotation process, with three annotators having backgrounds in information technology and computer science, ensuring its reliability. It provides valuable insights into the domains most commonly associated with regret, especially in the realm of relationships. The dataset’s statistics reveal the distribution of posts across different regret types and domains, making it a valuable resource for researchers developing and evaluating natural language processing algorithms focused on detecting and understanding emotional language in online texts. The VIC dataset, first introduced in [ref]37 and also featured in [ref]38, is a pioneering resource that addresses the previously understudied area of guilt detection in text using Natural Language Processing (NLP). This dataset, created by combining and binarizing samples from three existing emotion detection datasets, namely VENT , ISEAR , and CEASE , provides a comprehensive foundation for exploring guilt as an emotion in textual content. The dataset development process involved selecting relevant samples from these datasets, emphasizing guilt-labeled categories. Careful data cleaning and balancing techniques resulted in a dataset with a balanced distribution of guilt and no-guilt samples, making it suitable for machine learning experiments. The VIC dataset’s statistics showcase its origin and characteristics, highlighting differences in average sentence and word lengths between guilt and no-guilt samples. Researchers can leverage this dataset to delve into the complex realm of guilt detection in the text, laying the groundwork for future research and advancements in understanding this intricate emotion through NLP methods. Both dataset were subjected to meticulous preprocessing to address class imbalance and ensure a judicious distribution of samples. For VIC, we initiated the procedure by grouping the dataset by the \\sayorigin column, subsequently applying random sampling with replacement to select 500 samples from each group. These operations were followed by a judicious selection of pertinent columns, namely \\saytext and \\saylabel, signifying textual content and corresponding labels, respectively. To rectify the class imbalance in ReDDIT and align the dataset with our research objectives, we initiated the process by grouping the dataset by the \\saylabel. We then executed random sampling with replacement to select 500 samples from each group. Furthermore, to enhance label interpretability, we employed a label transformation scheme, replacing numeric labels (0, 1, and 2) with descriptive labels, specifically \\sayno regret and \\sayregret. The culminating step in our dataset preparation involved the concatenation of \\sayVIC and \\sayReDDIT along the rows, a procedure executed employing. The resultant dataset is distinguished by its balanced composition, affording parity between the various class categories. Table 2 shows the statistics of the dataset after pre-processing and unification.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: The ReDDIT dataset introduced in [ref]17 , serves as a valuable resource for understanding the expression of regret on social media, particularly on the Reddit platform.
