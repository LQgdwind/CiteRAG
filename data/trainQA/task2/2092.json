      "content": "Paper Title: Multiplierless MP-Kernel Machine For Energy-efficient Edge Devices\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEnergy-efficient SVM implementations have been reported for both digital  and analog hardware , which also exploit the inherent parallelism and regularity in MVM computation. In , an analog circuit architecture of Gaussian-kernel SVM having on-chip training capability has been developed. Even though it has a scalable processor configuration, the circuit size increases in proportion to the number of learning samples. Such designs are not scalable as we increase the dataset size for edge devices due to hardware constraints. Analog domain architectures tend to have lower classification latency , but they support simple classification models with small feature dimensions. In , an SVM architecture has been reported using an array of processing elements in a systolic chain configuration implemented on an FPGA. By exploiting resource sharing capability among the processing units and efficient memory management, such an architecture permitted a higher throughput and a more scalable design. Digital and optimized FPGA implementation of SVM has been reported in  using a cascaded architecture. A hardware reduction method is used to reduce the overheads due to the implementation of additional stages in the cascade, leading to significant resource and power savings for embedded applications. The use of cascaded SVMs increase the classification speeds, but the improved performance comes at the cost of additional hardware resources. Ideally, a single-layered SVM should be enough for classification at the edge. In , SVM prediction on an FPGA platform has been explored for ultrasonic flaw detection. A similar system has been implemented in  using Hamming distance for onboard classification of hyperspectral images. Since the SVM training phase needs a large amount of computation power and memory space, and often retraining is not required, the SVM training was realized offline. Therefore, the authors chose to accelerate only the classifier’s decision function.\nIn , the authors use stochastic computing as a low hardware cost and low power consumption SVM classifier implementation for real-time EEG based gesture recognition. Even though, this novel design has merits of energy efficient inference, the training framework had to be handled offline on a power hungry system. Often, training offline is not ideal for edge devices, primarily when the device is operating in dynamic environments, i.e., ever-changing parameters. In such cases, retraining of the ML architecture becomes important. One such system is discussed in , where sequential minimal optimization learning algorithm is implemented as an IP on FPGA. This can be leveraged for online learning systems. However, this system standalone cannot provide an end-to-end training and inference system. Another online training capable system was reported in  and used an FPGA implementation of a sparse neural network capable of online training and inference. The platform could be reconfigured to trade-off resource utilization with training time while keeping the network architecture the same. Even though the same platform can be used for training and inference, memory management and varying resource utilization based on training time make it less conducive to deploy on the edge device. Reconfiguration of the device would require additional usage of a microcontroller, increasing the system’s overall power consumption. As hardware complexity and power reduction are a major concern in these designs, the authors in  implement a multiplierless SVM kernel for classification in hardware instead of using a conventional vector product kernel. The data-flow amongst processing elements is handled using a parallel pipelined systolic array system. In the multiplierless block the authors use Canonic Signed Digit (CSD) to reduce the maximum number of adders. CSD is a number system by which a floating-point number can be represented in two’s complement form. The representation uses only -1, 0, +1 (or -, 0, +) symbols with each position denoting the addition and subtraction of power of 2. Despite being multiplierless, the system consumes many Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) due to the usage of polynomial kernel having exponent operation. The usage of DSPs increases the power consumption of the design. Another system that uses multiplierless online training was reported in . The authors use a logarithm function based on a look-up table, and a float-to-fixed point transform to simplify the calculations in a Naive Bayes classification algorithm. A novel format of a logarithm look-up table and shift operations are used to replace multiplication and division operations. Such systems incur an overhead of generating the logarithmic look-up table for most operations. The authors chose to calculate logarithmic values offline and store them in memory, contributing to increased memory access for every operation. l.1int.1in(a) l.1int.1in(b) l.05int.1in(c) There have been various neural network implementations that eliminate the usage of multipliers in their algorithms. In [ref]33, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are optimized using a new similarity measure by taking L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} norm distance between the filters, and the input features as the output response. Even though it eliminated the multipliers, this implementation requires batch normalization after each convolution operation, resulting in usage of multipliers for this operation. It also requires a full precision gradient-descent training scheme to achieve reasonable accuracy. Similarly, in [ref]34, convolutional shifts and fully connected shifts are introduced to replace multiplications with bitwise shifts and sign flipping. The authors use powers of 2 to represent weights, bias, and activations and use compression logic for storing these values. There is a significant overhead for compression and decompression logic for the implementation of an online system. In , the authors leverage the idea of using additions and logical bit-shifts instead of multiplications to explicitly parameterize deep networks that involve only bit-shift and additive weight layers. This network has limitations for implementing activation functions in the shift-add technique. In all these neural network systems, the training algorithm and activation implementations involve multipliers. Hence these systems cannot be termed as a complete multiplierless system. l.1int.1in(a) l.05int.1in(b) l.1int.1in(c) In this work, we propose to use an MP approximation to implement multiplierless kernel machine. MP-based approximation was first reported in , and in , an MP-based SVM was reported for analog hardware. The main objective of this work is to build scalable digital hardware using an optimized MP approximation. Also,\nthe previous work in MP-based SVM has used offline training. Our system is a one-of-a-kind digital hardware system using a multiplierless approximation technique in conjunction with online training and inference on the same platform.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: memory access for every operation. l.1int.1in(a) l.1int.1in(b) l.05int.1in(c) There have been various neural network implementations that eliminate the usage of multipliers in their algorithms.
