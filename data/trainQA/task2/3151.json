      "content": "Paper Title: BCD Nets: Scalable Variational Approaches for Bayesian Causal Discovery\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStructure Learning for Bayesian Networks: The field of Bayesian structure learning investigates how to infer the structure of Bayesian networks from data.\nLearning the structure of graphical models from data is known to be NP-hard . Nevertheless, two main families of approaches have been developed to tackle this problem.\nThe first are constraint-based approaches , aiming to infer conditional independences from the data and learn a structure consistent with these independences. The second family of approaches are score-based methods [ref]30 , which assign a score to a proposed DAG based on the goodness-of-fit to the data, and search over the space of DAGs to find a structure which maximizes the score. The combinatorial size and discrete nature of the set of possible DAGs in d𝑑d dimensions present the main difficulties to this approach. Several competing scores have been proposed [ref]46 , which generally have an either implicit or explicit term penalizing complexity to avoid overfitting to the data.\nRecent work has focussed on developing approximate algorithms that can return a high-scoring graph with probabilistic guarantees  and on exact methods for graphs under structural assumptions, such as an upper bound on the number of parents of a node 2 , similar to the classic Chow-Liu algorithm . Using these techniques it is possible to search over all graphs where nodes have at most two parents for dimension d>1000𝑑1000d>1000 . Another set of works improve sampling from distributions over DAGs, e.g. approaches sampling over orderings instead of over DAGs .\nGiven a particular network structure, there are several approaches to learning DAG edge weights, even in the presence of latent variables . Continuous Relaxations for Structure Learning: The problem of learning the structure of probabilistic graphical models on undirected graphs can be formulated as a convex optimization problem 7, which allows fast inference even for large graphs. However, the acyclicity constraint for learning directed graphs means continuous optimization cannot be applied directly.\nIn recent years, relaxation-based approaches to structure learning have emerged, based on the idea of learning the adjacency matrix corresponding to a DAG via optimization over a matrix W∈ℝd×d𝑊superscriptℝ𝑑𝑑W\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times d}, instead of in the set of adjacency matrices corresponding to DAGs. This approach was introduced in Zheng et al. [ref]62, with the least-squares loss ‖X−W⊤​X‖F2superscriptsubscriptnorm𝑋superscript𝑊top𝑋𝐹2\\|X-W^{\\top}X\\|_{F}^{2} used to measure the fit of the data to W𝑊W. To encourage W𝑊W to approximately form an adjacency matrix, a penalty h​(W)ℎ𝑊h(W) was added to the loss, where h​(W)=0ℎ𝑊0h(W)=0 only if W𝑊W is a DAG. Originally the penalty h​(W)=Tr⁡eW⊙Wℎ𝑊Trsuperscript𝑒direct-product𝑊𝑊h(W)=\\operatorname{Tr}e^{W\\odot W} was used, and subsequently different penalties have been proposed . Particularly of interest to us is GOLEM , which specifically investigates relaxed optimization approaches for the linear-Gaussian SEM that we consider. They point out the similarity of the squared loss to the log-likelihood in equation (1), and show that the additional term log​det(I−W)𝐼𝑊\\log\\det(I-W) also serves as a penalty for non-DAG W𝑊W. This allows optimization over W𝑊W to maximize the likelihood without the augmented Lagrangian optimization procedure used in Zheng et al. [ref]62. Learned Orderings: There are strong connections between our SEM setting and the problem of learning an ordering for autoregressive models. An SEM is similar to an autoregressive model  in the sense that the value at the i𝑖ith index depends on (possibly) all of the values before i𝑖i. It has been observed that certain orderings for autoregressive models can lead to higher likelihood 0, and subsequent work 5 8 has developed methods to find the orderings which lead to the best performance from the autoregressive model. The closest to our work is Li et al. 8, which uses latent permutations to learn an ordering for an autoregressive model. However, this approach doesn’t allow reparameterised gradients due to the hard assignment for the autoregressive order, and the REINFORCE  gradient estimator is used instead of lower-variance reparameterised gradients.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: approaches , aiming to infer conditional independences from the data and learn a structure consistent with these independences.
