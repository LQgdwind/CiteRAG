      "content": "Paper Title: The Scattering Compositional Learner: Discovering Objects, Attributes, Relationships in Analogical Reasoning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPGM [ref]34 is a visual analogical reasoning task. The task mimics how Raven Progressive Matrices were designed as a test for Intelligence Quotient (IQ) for humans .\nPGM consists of 8 different subdatasets, each containing 1,222,000 questions with 119,552,000 images. Due to the size of the dataset, we conduct experiments on only one of the sub-datasets, “neutral”. Each image may contain a variable number of objects of type “shape” or “line”. Five relationships (progression, XOR, OR, AND, and union) are defined over 5 attributes (size, type, color, position, and number) of the objects. There are on average 1-2 relationships defined in each problem. RAVEN [ref]39 is an extension to the PGM dataset.\nWhile RAVEN shares the same set of attributes as PGM, it introduces a different set of relationships over these attributes: progression, constant, union and arithmetic. The dataset is designed to be a more difficult task than PGM, as each problem contains 6.3 relationships on average, compared to 1-2 in PGM.\nThe dataset consists of 7 distinct configurations: Center, 2x2Grid, 3x3Grid, L-R, U-D, O-IC, O-IG. Each contains 10,000 problems. An illustration of each configuration is shown in Appendix B along with a detailed explanation. We evaluated our method on this dataset in addition to PGM because RAVEN also provides labeled symbolic representation of the attributes. This helps us verify the learning of compositional structures in Section 4.4. The symbolic representation is an integer-valued scalar for each feature, ranging from 0 to 9. Recently,  Hu et al. [ref]19 observed that there are defects in the design of candidate set generation in RAVEN dataset. In particular, they discovered a short-cut solution that predicts the label perfectly solely based on the candidate set without any information of the context images. Hence, they introduced a revised dataset called Balanced-RAVEN, which generates the candidate set in a different way to eliminate the short-cut solution. Since the results on RAVEN can be untrustworthy, in the following experiments, we mainly compare results on Balanced-RAVEN. Results on the original RAVEN are also included for completeness in Appendix C.2. \n\n\n\n\nTest Accuracy(%percent\\%)\n\n\nModel\nAvergae\nCenter\n2Grid\n3Grid\nL-R\nU-D\nO-IC\nO-IG\n\nLSTM [ref]19\n18.9\n26.2\n16.7\n15.1\n14.6\n16.5\n21.9\n21.1\n\nWReN [ref]19\n23.8\n29.4\n26.8\n23.5\n21.9\n21.4\n22.5\n21.5\n\nResnet [ref]19\n40.3\n44.7\n29.3\n27.9\n51.2\n47.4\n46.2\n35.8\n\nWild ResNet [ref]19\n44.3\n50.9\n33.1\n30.8\n53.1\n52.6\n50.9\n38.7\n\nLEN \n39.0\n45.5\n27.9\n26.6\n44.2\n43.6\n50.5\n34.9\n\nCoPINet \n46.3\n54.4\n33.4\n30.1\n56.8\n55.6\n54.3\n39.0\n\nHriNet [ref]19\n63.9\n80.1\n53.3\n46.0\n72.8\n74.5\n71.0\n49.6\n\nSCL (ours)\n95.0\n99.0\n96.2\n89.5\n97.9\n97.1\n97.6\n87.7\n\nHuman222The human experiments were conducted on the original RAVEN dataset, obtained from Zhang et al.
