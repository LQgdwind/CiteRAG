      "content": "Paper Title: Skeleton-DML: Deep Metric Learning for Skeleton-Based One-Shot Action Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAction recognition is a broad research topic that varies not only in different modalities like image sequences, skeleton sequences, data by inertial measurement units but also by their evaluation protocols. Most common protocols are cross-view or cross-subject. More recently one-shot protocols have gained attention. As our approach focuses on skeleton-based one-shot action recognition we present related work from the current research state directly related to our method.\nSkeleton based action recognition gained attention with the release of the Microsoft Kinect RGB-D camera. This RGB-D camera not only streamed depth and color images, but the SDK also supported the extraction of skeleton data. With the NTU RGB+D dataset  [ref]13 a large scale RGB-D action recognition dataset that also contains skeleton sequences has been released. The progress made on this dataset gives a good indication of the performance of various skeleton-based action recognition approaches. Because convolution neural architectures showed great performance in the image-classification domain, a variety of research concentrated on finding image-like representations for different research areas like speech recognition . Representations for encoding spatio-temporal information were explored in-depth for recognizing actions  [ref]1. They focus on a classification context by associating class labels with skeleton sequences in contrast to learning an embedding space. The idea of representing motion in image-like representations lead to serious alternatives to sequence classification approaches based on Recurrent Neural Networks  and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) .\n[ref]28 [ref]28 presented joint trajectory maps. Viewpoints from each axis were set and encoded 3D trajectories for each of the three main axis views. A simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture was used to train a classifier analyzing the joint trajectory maps. Occlusion could not be directly tackled, therefore the representation by   added flexibility by fusing up to nine representation schemes in separate image channels. A similar representation has recently shown to be usable also for action recognition on different modalities and their fusion .   on the other hand presented a compact and human-interpretable representation. Joint movement contributions over time can be interpreted.\nInteresting to note is also the skeleton transformer by  . They employ a fully connected layer to transform skeleton sequences into a 2 dimensional matrix representation. Yang et al.  present a joint order that puts joints closer together if their respective body parts are connected. It is generated by a depth-first tree traversal of the skeleton starting in the lower chest.\nSkepxels are small 5×5555\\times 5-pixel segments containing the positions of all 25 skeleton joints in a random but fixed order. Liu et al.  use this 2D structure as it is more easily captured by CNNs. Each sample of a sequence is turned into multiple sufficiently different Skepxels which are then stacked on top of each other. These Skepxels differ only in their joint permutation. The full Skepxel-image of a sequence of skeletons is assembled width-wise, without altering the joint permutation within one row of Skepxels.\nCaetano et al. [ref]1 generate two images containing motion information in the form of an orientation and a magnitude. The orientation is defined by the angles between the motion vector and the coordinate axes. The angles are stored in the color channels of an image, with time in horizontal and the joints in TSSI order in vertical direction. The gray-scale magnitude image contains the euclidean norm of the motion vectors instead. One-shot recognition in general aims at finding a method to classify new instances with a single reference sample. Possible approaches for solving problems of this category are metric learning  , or meta-learning . In action recognition this means a novel action can be learned with a single reference demonstration of the action. In contrast to one-shot image classification, actions consist of sequential data. A single frame might not contain enough context to recognize a novel activity. Along with the NTU RGB+D 120 dataset, [ref]13 [ref]13 presented a one-shot action recognition protocol and corresponding baseline approaches. The Advanced Parts Semantic Relevance (APSR) approach extracts features by using a spatio-temporal LSTM method. They propose a semantic relevance measurement similar to word embeddings. Body parts are associated with an embedding vector and a cosine similarity is used to calculate a semantic relevance score.\nSabater et al.  presented a one-shot action recognition approach based on a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). After normalization of the skeleton stream, they calculate pose features and use the TCN for the generation of motion descriptors. The descriptors at the last frame, assumed to contain all relevant motion from the skeleton-sequence, are used to calculate the distances to the reference samples. Action classes are associated by thresholding the distances.\nOur previous work on multi-modal one-shot action recognition  proposed to formulate the one-shot action recognition problem as a deep metric learning problem. Signals originating from various sensors are transformed into images and an encoder is trained using triplet-loss. The focus in that work was on showing the multi-modal applicability, whereas in this work we concentrate on skeleton-based one-shot action recognition.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: the release of the Microsoft Kinect RGB-D camera.
