      "content": "Paper Title: Progressive Correspondence Pruning by Consensus Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGeneration-verification framework. The generation-verification framework has been widely used for robust model estimation, e.g., RANSAC¬†2, LO-RANSAC¬†, PROSAC¬†, USAC¬†, NG-RANSAC¬†[ref]5, etc. It iteratively generates hypotheses and verifies the hypothesis confidence. Specifically, RANSAC¬†2 randomly samples a minimal subset of data to estimate a parametric model, and then verifies its confidence by evaluating the consistency between the data and generated parametric model. NG-RANSAC¬†[ref]5 proposes a two-stage approach which improves the sampling strategy of RANSAC by a pre-trained deep neural network. RANSAC and its variations have been proven sensitive to outliers in the literature¬†, since the sampled subset is prone to including inevitable outliers in the case of consumed data extremely unbalanced with enormous outliers. They appear as powerful solutions of robust model estimation when the majority of outliers is removed in advance¬†  by correspondence pruning methods¬†[ref]29  . Per-match classification.\nInspired by the tremendous success of deep learning¬†  , correspondence selection is now typically performed using deep networks. Due to the irregular and unordered characteristics of correspondences, 2D convolutions cannot be easily applied. PointCN¬†[ref]29 proposes to treat the correspondence pruning as a per-match classification problem, using MLPs to predict the label (inlier or outlier) for each correspondence. Since then, per-match classification has become the de facto standard. NM-Net¬† expects to extract reliable local information for correspondences via a compatibility-specific mining, which relies on the known affine attributes. OANet¬† presents differentiable pooling and unpooling techniques to cluster input correspondences and upsample the clusters for a full size prediction (predicting labels for all input correspondences), respectively. An attentive context normalization is proposed in¬†, which implicitly represents global context by the weighted feature normalization.\nAlthough existing methods have shown satisfactory performance, they still suffer from the dominant outliers included in the putative correspondences. To address this issue, we suggest progressively pruning correspondences into a subset of candidates for easier inlier identification and more robust model estimation. We illustrate empirically that our approach effectively mitigates the effects of outliers in Sec.¬†4. Consensus in correspondences.\nCorrect matches are consistent in epipolar geometry or under the homography constraint¬†, while mismatches are inconsistent because of their random distribution. The idea of correspondence consensus has therefore been studied, but mostly within hand-crafted methods. For instance, GTM¬† computes a game-theoretic matching based on a payoff function that utilizes affine information around keypoints to measure the consistency between a pair of correspondences. LPM¬† assumes that local geometry around correct matches does not change freely; the geometry variation is represented by the consensus of kùëòk-nearest neighbors on keypoint coordinates. GMS¬† proposes to indicate the consensus by the number of correspondences located in small regions. However, in¬†, the hand-crafted methods\nare shown to be sensitive to specific nuisances such as rotation, translation, and viewpoint changes. Inspired by these hand-crafted efforts, we also exploit the notion of consensus, but propose to learn it using local-to-global graphs.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: Generation-verification framework.
