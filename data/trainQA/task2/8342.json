For instance, Fagin \nshowed that existential second-order logic (ESO) captures the complexity class NP. Taking\ncomplements, universal second-order logic (USO) captures coNP. Further restrictions of ESO might no longer have the full expressive power, but still the full\ncomputational power of NP, in the sense that every problem in NP is polynomial-time equivalent to a problem that can be expressed in the restricted logic; we will call such classes NP-rich.111If we consider disjunctive, conjunctive, or Turing reductions, we call such classes conjunctive, disjunctive, or Turing NP-rich, respectively.\nA prominent example of an NP-rich ESO fragment is SNP (for strict NP), which is defined as the\nrestriction of ESO to sentences with a universal first-order part. SNP is quite expressive, and contains for instance all of Datalog .\nFeder and Vardi \nproved that SNP is NP-rich (see [ref]4 for some of the missing details of the proof given in ). Of course, there is a corresponding\nfragment of USO which captures the computational power of coNP. The fine-grained study of the computational complexity of fragments of ESO is closely related to the study of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs).\nIf 𝔹𝔹\\mathbb{B} is a structure with a finite relational signature τ𝜏\\tau, then CSP⁡(𝔹)CSP𝔹\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbb{B})\ndenotes the class of all finite τ𝜏\\tau-structures that homomorphically map to 𝔹𝔹\\mathbb{B}; this might be viewed as a decision problem, namely\nthe task of deciding membership in CSP⁡(𝔹)CSP𝔹\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbb{B}).\nIt can be shown that SNP is conjunctive NP-rich\nif two further strong restrictions are imposed: monotonicity and connectedness \n(see Section 2.3 for definitions).\nThe significance of monotone connected SNP is that every problem described in this logic is the constraint satisfaction problem of a reduct of a finitely bounded structure 𝔹𝔹\\mathbb{B},\nand conversely every such CSP can be expressed in monotone connected SNP.\nA structure 𝔹𝔹\\mathbb{B} is called finitely bounded\nif there exists a finite set ℱℱ{\\mathcal{F}} of finite structures such that a finite structure 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A} embeds into 𝔹𝔹\\mathbb{B} if and only if no structure from ℱℱ{\\mathcal{F}} embeds into 𝔸𝔸\\mathbb{A}. The problem CSP⁡(𝔹)CSP𝔹\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbb{B}) might be undecidable in general , but if 𝔹𝔹\\mathbb{B} is finitely bounded, then CSP⁡(𝔹)CSP𝔹\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbb{B}) is in NP. A reduct of a structure 𝔹𝔹\\mathbb{B} is a structure obtained from 𝔹𝔹\\mathbb{B} by dropping some of the relations.\nReducts of finitely bounded structures need not be finitely bounded, but their CSP obviously remains in NP. The conjunctive NP-richness of the class of CSPs for reducts of finitely bounded structures contrasts nicely\nwith the famous complexity dichotomy for finite structures 𝔹𝔹\\mathbb{B}: in this case, CSP⁡(𝔹)CSP𝔹\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbb{B}) is in P or NP-complete [ref]51 (the result has\nbeen announced independently by Bulatov  and by Zhuk ).\nUsing earlier results of Feder and Vardi  and Kun , this shows that the ESO fragment of monotone monadic SNP has a complexity dichotomy as well (an alternative proof can be found in ).\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: defined as the\nrestriction of ESO to sentences with a universal first-order part. SNP is quite expressive, and contains for instance all of Datalog .\nFeder and Vardi \nproved that SNP is NP-rich (see [ref]4 for some of the missing details of the proof given in ).
