We first discuss the different processes involving machine consciousness  and then, the different approaches that have tackled machine consciousness . Machine consciousness processes involve mainly four categories ordered from 1 to 4 in function of how close to generating real awareness they are 5. Level 1 includes machines that implements external behaviour associated with consciousness. Some of the described behaviours in the introduction section like social interactions implemented in machines would be level 1 and the field of artificial general intelligence  lies in this level. Several authors   argue that machines implementing these behaviours may produce consciousness, but there is controversy. Machines that implement cognitive characteristics like imagination , attention, emotion, depiction and planning are level 2 machines. When an architecture involving all these process exists, we are talking about level 3 machines, that is, machines with an architecture that is claimed to be a cause or correlate of human consciousness. Lastly, phenomenally conscious machines are level 4 machines based in the hypothesis that several level 2-3 design could emerge phenomenal states . Several approaches have tackled the previous categories of machine consciousness. A classification of them all  includes five categories: First one are methods based in the global workspace theory . According to this theory, consciousness emerges from a system, like the brain, with a collection of distributed specialized networks with a fleeting memory capacity whose focal contents are widely distributed to many unconscious specialized networks, called contexts. These contexts work together to jointly constrain conscious events and to shape conscious contents . These theory has support of the neuroscience community [ref]7 and the computer science community . We are also inspired by this theory to provide a cognitive architecture  with machine learning techniques. Other categories include methods that suggest that consciousness emerges from a certain amount of information processing and integration [ref]9, from creating an internal self-model , from generating higher-level representations  and from attention mechanisms 8. Machine consciousness has risen as a research topic for the deep learning literature , where the interest resides in learning representations of high-level concepts of the kind humans manipulate with language. We suggest that machine learning and related techniques  are able to work as a global workspace, process a high amount of information, can generate internal self-models and higher level representations and have attention mechanisms. Hence, machine learning and generative processes should be explored in this field.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: specialized networks, called contexts. These contexts work together to jointly constrain conscious events and to shape conscious contents . These theory has support of the neuroscience community [ref]7 and the computer science community .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
