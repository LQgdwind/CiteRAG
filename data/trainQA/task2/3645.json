Self-supervised learning for visual understanding leverages the intrinsic properties of images as the supervisory information for training, for which the capability of visual representation heavily depends on the formulation of pretext tasks. Prior to the recent popularity of instance discrimination [ref]2 4  [ref]28, people have explored numerous pretext tasks, including image denoising and reconstruction   , adversarial learning   , and heuristic tasks such as image colorization , jigsaw puzzle 6 , context and rotation prediction  3, and deep clustering . The emergence of contrastive learning, or more specifically, the scheme of instance discrimination [ref]2 4  [ref]28 has made a break-through in unsupervised learning, as MoCo [ref]28 achieves superior transfer performance than supervised training in a wide range of downstream tasks. Inspired by this success, many follow-up works conduct deeper explorations in self-supervised contrastive learning and put forward different optimization objectives  1 2   4, model architectures , and training strategies   . Dense contrastive learning. To obtain better adaptation in dense prediction tasks, a recent work 7 extends the image-level contrastive loss into a pixel-level. Despite the extension of contrastive loss helps the model learn finer grained features, it is not able to establish the model’s perception of spatially varying information, and therefore the model has to be re-purposed in downstream finetuning. More recent works try to enhance the model’s understanding of positional information in images by encouraging the consistency of pixel-level representations 5, or by employing heuristic masks   and applying a patch-wise contrastive loss 0. Copy-paste for contrastive learning. Copy-paste, i.e., copying crops of one image and pasting them onto another image, once serves as a data augmentation method in supervised instance segmentation and semantic segmentation  for its simplicity and significant effect in enriching images’ positional and semantic information. Similarly, by mixing images 9 1 or image crops 8 as data augmentation, the supervised models also attain considerable performance improvements in various tasks. The use of copy-paste is also reported in recent works of self-supervised object detection 6 0. Inspired by the success of copy-paste, we utilize this approach in our dense contrastive learning method as the self-supervisory information.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: supervisory information for training, for which the capability of visual representation heavily depends on the formulation of pretext tasks.
