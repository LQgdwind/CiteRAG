      "content": "Paper Title: Market Making without Regret\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere exists a vast literature that treats various trading-related tasks as specific stochastic control problems and solves them using techniques from stochastic control theory    . However, most of that work assumes that the parameters of the underlying stochastic process are known or have been fitted to historical data in a previous “calibration” step.\nFitting a distribution to data is challenging, especially in a market with hundreds of thousands of assets. Moreover, the distribution-fitting process is typically unaware of the downstream optimization problem the distribution is going to be fed into, and thus is unlikely to minimize generalization error on the downstream task. The field of online learning     provides adversarial or distribution-free approaches for solving exactly the kinds of sequential decision making problems that are common in financial trading, and even though some recent research does apply these approaches to trading, they are still far from being widely adopted.\nAn early contribution to this area is Cover’s model of “universal portfolios” , where a problem of portfolio construction is solved in the case where asset returns are generated by an adversary. Cover showed that one can still achieve logarithmic regret with respect to the best “constantly rebalanced portfolio”, that ensures the fraction of wealth allocated to each asset remains constant through time. A long line of work has built up on his model to handle transaction costs  and side information , as well as optimizing the trade-off between regret and computation    . The problem of pricing derivatives such as options has also been tackled using online learning, where the prices are generated by an adversary as opposed to a geometric Brownian motion   .\nHowever, most of the problems considered in the online learning framework are from the point of view of a liquidity seeker as opposed to a liquidity provider, such as a market maker. Here we begin a rigorous study of possibly the simplest online market making setup: online market making with instant clearing. This work contributes to the existing body of research on first-price auctions and dynamic pricing within the online learning paradigm, specifically the multi-armed bandit framework, which boasts a substantial literature base across Statistics, Operations Research, Computer Science, and Economics  0  [ref]47. Our focus centers on environments exhibiting Lipschitz continuity [ref]47  [ref]11 and how this property aids learning under different assumptions on the level of information shared with the learner while bidding.\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: the online learning paradigm, specifically the multi-armed bandit framework, which boasts a substantial literature base across Statistics, Operations Research, Computer Science, and Economics  0  [ref]47.
