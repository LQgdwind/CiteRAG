      "content": "Paper Title: Dynamical Isometry: The Missing Ingredient for Neural Network Pruning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPruning is a time-honored methodology to reduce parameters in a neural network without seriously compromising its performance¬†[ref]39 [ref]46. The prevailing pipeline of pruning comprises three steps: 1) pretraining: train a dense model; 2) pruning: prune the dense model based on certain rules; 3) finetuning: retrain the pruned model to regain performance. Most existing research focuses on the second step, which is believed to be the central problem in pruning, i.e., seeking the best criterion to select unimportant weights so as to incur as less performance degradation as possible. These said several recent works discovered that there are other important axes not well noted by the community. Specifically,   found that the learning rate (LR) in finetuning holds a critical role in the final performance. A proper learning rate schedule (e.g., a larger initial LR 0.01 vs.¬†0.001) can improve the top-1 accuracy of a pruned ResNet-34 model¬† by more than 1% on ImageNet¬†. This discovery calls upon more attention being paid to the finetuning step when comparing different pruning methods. Unfortunately, they did not present more theoretical insights to explain its occurrence. Up to date, this remains an open problem in the community, to our best knowledge. Another open problem in pruning is the debate about its value. Several works have questioned the necessity of the 1st step in the pipeline.  [ref]30 argue the 1st step (i.e., pretraining a large model) is unnecessary because they empirically found the small model trained from scratch can match (or sometimes outperform) the counterpart pruned from the pre-trained large model. Pruning has been developed for more than 30 years to date¬†  . Even a moment‚Äôs thought is enough to see it should have value. However, at the same time, the discovery of  [ref]30 is challenging our belief. To our best knowledge, no paper has systematically responded to the questioning and explained why scratch training could match pruning in their experiments. These are two open problems in neural network pruning, which are discovered empirically but with little theoretical understanding of the underlying rationale. On the other hand, the prevailing point of view about the pruning pipeline is to regard finetuning as a post-processing step for pruning111As a result, many pruning papers describe the pruning part in length, leaving the details of finetuning scratched or even not mentioned at all. This issue was also noted by¬†.. Actually, there is another perspective around, which we think is better, is to see pruning as initialization for finetuning. This perspective holds finetuning at the center and asks if pruning serves it well. After all, the performance after finetuning is what really matters; there is no reason to overlook it¬†. From this perspective, it is easy to see a seriously under-explored problem in pruning: In stark contrast to the fact that the initialization of neural networks in SGD training¬†  has been well-recognized¬†   3 , we have rarely questioned if pruning provides the proper initialization for finetuning (note finetuning is essentially SGD training, too). In this paper, we examine the initialization role of pruning from the signal propagation perspective of neural networks. Specifically, we look into how pruning and finetuning affect the dynamical isometry¬† of a pretrained network. With its help, our results suggest theoretical explanations towards the two aforementioned mysteries in pruning: (1) Pruning hurts dynamical isometry (see Fig.¬†1). Finetuning can recover it. A larger LR can help recover it faster thus achieving a better final accuracy. (2) The finetuning learning rates in  [ref]30 are actually far from optimal, which cannot fully recover the dynamical isometry and finally lead to the ‚Äúno value of pruning‚Äù argument. With a more proper finetuning LR, our results suggest that filter pruning (even if using the most basic L1subscriptùêø1L_{1}-norm pruning¬†8) still outperforms scratch training across different pruning ratios. On top of resolving the two mysteries, our work also suggests that dynamical isometry recovery (DIR) before finetuning is a very imperative step, which should be included in the pruning pipeline. In this regard, we propose a DIR method (OrthP) based on inherited weights by pruning. In short, our contributions in this paper can be summarized into the following three aspects: We tap into dynamical isometry as a powerful tool to diagnose the role of pruning as initialization and discover that the inherited weights by pruning are not a good initialization (Sec.¬†3.1). We propose a dynamical isometry recovery algorithm (OrthP) that can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to recover the damaged dynamical isometry (Sec.¬†3.2). With the insights from dynamical isometry and OrthP, we unveil two mysteries in pruning: why a larger finetuning LR can improve the final performance significantly¬†  (Sec.¬†3.3) and whether filter pruning really bears no value compared to training from scratch¬† [ref]30 (Sec.¬†3.4).\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: Pruning is a time-honored methodology to reduce parameters in a neural network without seriously compromising its performance¬†[ref]39 [ref]46.
