      "content": "Paper Title: Refining a Deep Learning-based Formant Tracker using Linear Prediction Methods\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFormant tracking was studied in this article based on refining the formant contours predicted\nby an existing modern data-driven formant tracker, DeepFormants. In the studied approach, the trained NN model of the DeepFormants tracker first maps input speech frames to the preliminary contours of F1subscriptùêπ1F_{1}, F2subscriptùêπ2F_{2}, and F3subscriptùêπ3F_{3}. The predicted formants are then replaced frame-wise by the local peaks in the all-pole spectra computed in a model-driven manner by an LP-based method from the same speech frames. As an LP method, one conventional method (LP-COV) and one recently developed algorithm (QCP-FB) were used. The proposed refinement technique was compared in formant tracking to the original version of DeepFormants and to five classic trackers. In the first experiment, altogether eight trackers (five classical trackers, DeepFormants, DeepFormantsLP-COV, and DeepFormantsQCP-FB) were compared using evaluation data that consisted of the vowels, diphthongs, and semivowels of the VTR corpus. The results showed that the three DeepFormants-based trackers outperformed all five classic trackers, and that DeepFormantsQCP-FB was the best tracker. In the second experiment, four best trackers of the first experiment were compared by dividing the evaluation data into seven phonetic categories. The results indicated that the refined DeepFormantsQCP-FB tracker showed a consistent performance improvement over the original DeepFormants tracker in all three formants for vowels, diphthongs, semivowels, and nasals. Particularly for fricatives, however, tracking of F1subscriptùêπ1F_{1} showed lower performance for DeepFormantsQCP-FB compared to DeepFormants. Finally, in the third experiment, robustness of formant tracking with respect to noise was evaluated by comparing the same trackers that were included in the second experiment. The results of this experiment indicated that DeepFormantsQCP-FB showed the best resilience to noise. The results summarized above suggest that the proposed idea to refine the formants tracked by DeepFormants using the formants predicted by a model-driven, LP-based signal processing approach results in an improved accuracy and noise robustness in formant tracking. The observed performance degradation of DeepFormantsQCP-FB in tracking formants of fricatives is due to the aperiodic nature of the excitation of the speech production mechanism in these sounds. For speech sounds with aperiodic glottal excitations, there are namely no clear glottal closure instants, and therefore QCP-FB analysis is not able to improve the estimation of the vocal tract by reducing the effect of glottal closure instants. The improved noise robustness of DeepFormantsQCP-FB can in turn be explained by two issues. First, QCP-FB analysis estimates vocal tract resonances by emphasizing the contribution of speech waveform samples that occur after glottal closure . These speech samples are more robust against noise because their amplitude level is larger than in other parts of the glottal cycle. Therefore, QCP-FB analysis inherently utilizes speech samples that are more resilient to additive noise, which leads to improved formant tracking by DeepFormantsQCP-FB. Second, the key concept of DeepFormantsQCP-FB, the combination of model-driven and data-driven approaches, in formant tracking helps in improving noise robustness of formant tracking. In purely data-driven trackers, such as DeepFormants, there is always the risk of having a mismatch between the system training and test stages. The DeepFormants tracker has been namely trained with clean speech, and therefore it is understandable that its performance might drop when the tracker is tested in conditions that have not been seen by the tracker's NN models in the system training stage. In DeepFormantsQCP-FB, however, the other part of the combination, the model-driven QCP-FB technique, is free of any data learning stage, and therefore the tracker will be more resilient to mismatch between the training and test conditions. In reporting results of formant tracking experiments (e.g.,  [ref]30 ), authors typically compare their proposed method with known reference techniques by using absolute FEE measure as metrics (in Hz, defined Eq.¬†15), which was also used in this study. In some studies (e.g., ), results are reported using the mean absolute deviation (MAD), which is the relative error (in %) between the tracked formant and its reference value. (Note that MAD is called the mean absolute percentage error in some studies [ref]28 ). What is, however, left undiscussed by authors of the study area is the question whether the tracking metrics obtained can be considered good enough when the underlying formant tracker is in use, for example, in phonetic studies of natural speech. This question about the goodness of metrics is obviously difficult to answer because formant tracking can be used in tasks that are of different requirements in terms of how large errors formant tracking is allowed to show. As an example, in identification of vowels based on their tracked F1subscriptùêπ1F_{1} and F2subscriptùêπ2F_{2} values, a larger error may be tolerated for vowels that are at the corners of the vowel triangle (i.e., /u/, /i/, and /a/) compared to those that are in the middle (e.g., /≈ì/ and //). In order to shed light on this problematic question about the goodness of metrics, we propose that the assessment of the metrics shown by a formant tracker could be done by comparing the tracker's metrics with the results reported in human perception studies on formants. There are namely many investigations that have been done since the 1950's to study human perceptual thresholds in formant distinction (e.g.,  ). The results of these studies were summarized by Kewley-Port and Watson in , and their conclusion was that humans are able to distinguish changes in F1subscriptùêπ1F_{1} when its value is altered by 3%-10% (corresponding to MAD values between 3% and 10%). Achieving MAD values of this small magnitude even for one phonetic category (e.g., vowels which were considered in ) is obviously a tough requirement in automatic formant tracking. In order to demonstrate this for the trackers of the current study, we computed MAD values for DeepFormants and DeepFormantsQCP-FB in tracking F1subscriptùêπ1F_{1} from vowels and diphthongs. For vowels, MAD values of 15.7% and 11.4% were obtained by DeepFormants and DeepFormantsQCP-FB, respectively. For diphthongs, the corresponding values were 15.3% and 11.6%. Hence, the performance of even the best trackers is still many percentage units lower compared to human performance in detection of noticeable changes in F1subscriptùêπ1F_{1}. It is undoubtedly ambitious to set the goal in formant tracking\nto metrics values that correspond to the thresholds reported in formant distinction by humans, and this requirement seems not be possible to be achieved yet even by the latest data-driven trackers. However, we hope that the introduction of this goal motivates the development of new formant trackers, and we argue the goal is in line with recent progress in other areas of speech technology, such as text-to-speech synthesis  and automatic speech recognition , where performance of machine is approaching human performance. In conclusion, the study showed that the two groups of formant estimation techniques that have been used in formant trackers, the conventional model-based approach based on parametric all-pole modeling and the modern data-driven approach, should not be seen as alternatives to each other. Instead they can be used together to enhance the accuracy of data-driven trackers. Accuracy improvement can be implemented easily by plugging an LP-based formant estimation method into an existing data-driven tracker without re-training the tracker's NNs.  Future studies will be conducted to analyze the system performance when the test data is taken from other annotated databases than the VTR corpus, which was used in the training of DeepFormants.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: free of any data learning stage, and therefore the tracker will be more resilient to mismatch between the training and test conditions.
