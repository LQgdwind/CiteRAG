      "content": "Paper Title: Masked Spatio-Temporal Structure Prediction for Self-supervised Learning on Point Cloud Videos\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMask prediction has been proven to be an excellent self-supervised task for visual representation learning   [ref]15. By reconstructing target signals from the masked input, mask prediction enables the network to learn rich representations and boosts self-supervised learning [ref]4 [ref]2  . Chen et al. [ref]4 extended GPT  to operate the pixel sequence for prediction. Bao et al. [ref]2 and Wang et al.  introduced another successful framework, BERT , to predict the identities of masked tokens. Then, He et al. [ref]15 proposed MAE as a scalable vision learner to predict the pixels of masked patches. Feichtenhofer et al.  and Tong et al. 7 extended MAE to video representation learning by masking patch tubes. Wei et al.  developed MaskFeat to predict the HOG features of masked spatio-temporal tubes for self-supervised video pre-training. The regular structure of images and videos makes it easy to obtain patches or patch tubes, which facilitates the design of masking strategies. Pang et al.  extended MAE to unstructured static point clouds and designed a masking strategy based on the local spatial neighborhoods. However, point cloud videos are not only spatially irregular but also temporally misaligned across frames  . To remedy this, we design a point-tube masking strategy.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: Mask prediction has been proven to be an excellent self-supervised task for visual representation learning   [ref]15.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
