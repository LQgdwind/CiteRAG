Baselines\nDiffuseIT: The most similar work to ours based on diffusion models is DiffuseIT  that tackles the same problem formulation. We compare our results with DiffuseIT using their pretrained model and default parameters. \nDiffAE+SDEdit: Since Diffusion Autoencoder  does not directly support image-to-image translation, we combine that with SDEdit . The input image for the reverse process is x600subscript𝑥600x_{600} (chosen empirically) obtained as q​(x600|xc)𝑞conditionalsubscript𝑥600subscript𝑥𝑐q(x_{600}|x_{c}) by running the forward process on the content image. The semantic feature zs​e​msubscript𝑧𝑠𝑒𝑚z_{sem} from the semantic encoder of DiffAE is used given the style image xssubscript𝑥𝑠x_{s}.\nDiffAE+MagicMix: We also combine MagixMix  with DiffAE. Similar to DiffAE+SDEdit, this model takes x600subscript𝑥600x_{600} from xcsubscript𝑥𝑐x_{c} as input and zs​e​msubscript𝑧𝑠𝑒𝑚z_{sem} from xssubscript𝑥𝑠x_{s} as conditioning. Additionally, at each timestep, the approximated previous timestep x^t−1subscript^𝑥𝑡1\\hat{x}_{t-1} is combined with xt−1subscript𝑥𝑡1x_{t-1} from the content image xcsubscript𝑥𝑐x_{c}, i.e., x^t−1=v​x^t−1+(1−v)​q​(xt−1|xc)subscript^𝑥𝑡1𝑣subscript^𝑥𝑡11𝑣𝑞conditionalsubscript𝑥𝑡1subscript𝑥𝑐\\hat{x}_{t-1}=v\\hat{x}_{t-1}+(1-v)q(x_{t-1}|x_{c}). For this experiment, v=0.5𝑣0.5v=0.5 is used and the noise mixing technique is applied between t= 0𝑡600300t= 0. \nSAE: Swapping Autoencoder  based on GAN  is also evaluated. Since the available pretrained model is on the resolution of 512, we resize the generated results to 256 for fair comparison. Evaluation Metrics\nFID: We use the commonly used Fréchet inception distance (FID)  to ensure the generated samples are realistic. We follow the protocol proposed in [ref]7 for reference based image translation. To obtain statistics from generated images, 2000 test samples are used as the content images and five randomly chosen images from the rest of the test set are used as style images for each content image to generate 10000 synthetic images. \nLPIPS: Even though FID evaluates realism of the generations, the model could use just content and ignore style (or vice versa) and still get good FID. Following [ref]7, we use LPIPS score obtained by measuring the feature distances between pairs of synthetic images generated from the same content image but with different style images. Higher LPIPS indicates more diverse results. It is ideal for the model to tradeoff between LPIPS and FID, i.e incorporate enough style information from different style images for the same content image (increasing LPIPS) but without going out of the real distribution (decreasing FID).\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Datasets\nWe train different models on the commonly used datasets such as AFHQ [ref]7, FFHQ [ref]22 and LSUN-church [ref]52.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
