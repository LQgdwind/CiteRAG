      "content": "Paper Title: Stroke-Based Autoencoders: Self-Supervised Learners for Efficient Zero-Shot Chinese Character Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNatural Language Processing Deep learning-based neural networks are the prevailing models applied in almost all NLP tasks. Recurrent sequence modelings, such as RNN, LSTM8, and Transformer, predict the next word based on previous information. Masked language modeling, such as BERT and GPT[ref]2, has been a great success. By training the model with a portion of the input sequence, these models learn the representation of the word and then predict the missing parts. The latest research suggests that pre-training methods    generalize well to various downstream tasks.\n\nMasked Image Encoding To learn image representations by predicting masked images from an input sequence of images, DAE first considers masks as noises and obtain image representation by denosing the corrupted input signals. This pioneering work is generalized to a number of masked image encoding methods. Inspired by the Transformer, many approaches 2  1 are proposed for image encoding. The Vision Transformer(ViT)1 performs a preliminary exploration of masked patch prediction for self-supervised learning. Beit2 predicts the discrete tokens to pre-train ViT. Most recently, MAE3 masks about 75% proportion of the input image and achieves better recognition accuracy on ImageNet-1K and other datasets.\n\nSemantic Enhancement from the morphology of Chinese Characters Cao et al.  first exploit the stroke-level information of Chinese characters with stroke n-grams. Li et al. encode Chinese characters with Five-Stroke for the recognition of Chinese Named Entities. But these human-generated encoding methods may lead to repetition, since they cannot take full advantage of the spatial information of Chinese characters.\nInstead of using the ID-based character embedding method, Sun et al. and Li et al.0 extract the glyph information of Chinese characters for the language model based on Chinese character images. However, due to the lack of supervision, these methods cannot focus on global and local information simultaneously.\nIn addition, word embedding evaluation plays a important role in the estimation of semantic enhancement. Evaluation methods can be roughly divided into two categories: Intrinsic evaluation with word similarity or word analogy, and extrinsic evaluation for the performance of downstream NLP tasks. It has been verified that there are strong correlations between intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations.\nZero-Shot Chinese Character Recognition Zero-Shot Chinese character recognition depends on the set of labeled training set of seen classes and some preliminary knowledge about the semantic relation between unseen classes and seen classes.\nThis semantic relation is often described as a high-dimensional vector , which is established from a semantic embedding space (e.g., the attribute space).\nSpecifically, most existing zero-shot learning methods learn a projection function from the visual feature space to the semantic embedding space, by training visual data with labels consisting only of visible classes.\nFor zero-shot Chinese character recognition, the semantic embedding space is heavily based on the exploration of the structures of Chinese characters, which can be explored from radical-level6   and stroke-level4.\nCw2vec first exploits the stroke-level information of Chinese characters with stroke n-grams, which divides Chinese characters into five basic categories of strokes such as horizontal, vertical, left-falling, right-falling, and turning, according to the Chinese national standard GB18030-20, as shown in Fig. 3. For example, the Chinese character ’鸣’ can be encoded as ’25135451’ as shown in Fig. 4. Chen et al.4 then used this stroke-based encoding as the semantic embedding of the Chinese character, making breakthrough progress in zero-shot recognition.\nHowever, this human-generated encoding still lacks spatial information and has the potential for repetition.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: applied in almost all NLP tasks.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
