      "content": "Paper Title: Reinforcement Learning-enhanced Shared-account Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe evaluate RL-ISN on two real-world datasets HVIDEO [ref]11 and HAMAZON [ref]39. HVIDEO is a smart TV dataset that records the watching logs of family accounts (shared-account) on two platforms, i.e., the V-domain and E-domain, from October 2016 to June 2017. The V-domain is a video watching platform containing TV series, movies, cartoons, etc. The E-domain includes the educational videos from elementary to high school, as well as instructional videos on sports, food, etc. As these records are generated by shared family accounts on two domains, they are suitable for investigating the SCSR task. With further filtering out accounts that have less than 10 watching videos and those records with watching time less than 300 seconds, our resulting dataset contains 13,714 overlapped accounts and 125,943 sequences. HAMAZON is a product review dataset released by Sun et al. [ref]39, which contains users’ review behaviors on two Amazon platforms, i.e., M-domain and B-domain, from May 1996 to July 2014. The M-domain refers to Amazon users’ watching and rating interactions on movies. The B-domain refers to users’ reading and rating behaviors on books. This dataset satisfies the cross-domain characteristic via only keeping users who have interactions in both Amazon movie and book domains.\nTo simulates the shared-account characteristic, this dataset first splits the time schedule into 6 intervals, which are 1996-2000, 2001-2003, 2004-2006, 2007-2009, 2010-2012, 2013-2015. Then, it randomly merges 2-4 users and their review records in each interval as one shared-account. After splitting each sequence into small fragments within one year, and filtering out the sequences with less than 5 items from M-domain and 2 items from B-domain, the resulted dataset is finally reached, which contains 13,724 accounts and 196,297 sequences. The statistics of these two datasets are summarized in Table I. We take HAMAZON as a supplement to the real-life dataset mainly because: 1) We cannot find other datasets that contain shared-account information.\nThough the CAMRa 2011 dataset  also contains real-life shared-account information, the owner does not wish to distribute the dataset anymore.\n2) The HAMAZON dataset has been commonly used for SCSR in recent publications  [ref]39 as a supplement to the real-life dataset. In this work, we follow their experimental settings, and utilize the synthetic HAMAZON data to evaluate our method. Moreover, we also notice that using synthetic accounts is a common practice in studying the shared-account recommendation problem   . For example, Verstrepen et al.  study the top-n recommendation for shared-account with synthetic accounts that are manually created by randomly merging several users’ histories together. Jiang et al.  follow the account creation strategy in , and study a user identification task based on that.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: We evaluate RL-ISN on two real-world datasets HVIDEO [ref]11 and HAMAZON [ref]39.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
