      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring and Distilling Posterior and Prior Knowledge for Radiology Report Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe conduct the experiments on two public datasets, i.e., IU-Xray [ref]8 and MIMIC-CXR . IU-Xray ¬†The IU-Xray [ref]8 is a widely-used benchmark dataset to evaluate the performance of radiology report generation methods. It contains 7,470 chest Xray images associated with 3,955 radiology reports.\nFor data preparation, we first exclude the entries without the findings section and are left with 6,471 images and 3,336 reports. Then, following    , we randomly split the dataset into 70%-10%-20% training-validation-testing splits. There is no overlap of patients across train, validation and test sets. At last, we preprocess the reports by tokenizing, converting to lower-cases and removing non-alpha tokens. The top 1,200 words, which cover over 99.0% word occurrences in the dataset, are included in our vocabulary. MIMIC-CXR ¬†We further adopt a recently released largest dataset to date, i.e., MIMIC-CXR , to verify the effectiveness of our approach. The dataset includes 377,110 chest X-ray images and 227,835 reports. Following  for a fair comparison, we use the official splits to report our results. As a result, the MIMIC-CXR dataset is split into 368,960 images/222,758 reports for training, 2,991 images/1,808 reports for validation and 5,159 images/3,269 reports for testing. We convert all tokens of reports to lower-cases and remove the tokens whose frequency of occurrence is less than 10, resulting in around 4k words. Metrics ¬†We adopt the widely-used BLEU 2, METEOR , ROUGE-L  and CIDEr 8, which are calculated by the standard evaluation toolkit . In particular, BLEU 2 and METEOR  are originally proposed for machine translation evaluation. ROUGE-L¬† is designed for measuring the quality of summaries. CIDEr 8 is designed to evaluate image captioning systems. Settings ¬†We extract image features from both datasets with a ResNet-152 , which is pretrained on ImageNet and fine-tuned on CheXpert dataset . The extracted features are 2,048 feature maps in the shape of 7√ó7777\\times 7 which are further projected into 512 feature maps, i.e. NIsubscriptùëÅIN_{\\text{I}} is 49 and dùëëd is 512. According the performance on the validation set, the number of retrieved reports NKsubscriptùëÅKN_{\\text{K}} and heads in MHA nùëõn are set to 100 and 8, respectively. During training, following  , we first pre-train our approach with a multi-label classification network and employ a weighted binary cross entropy loss for tag classification. Then we apply the Eq.¬†(11) to train our full model. We use the Adam optimizer¬† with a batch size of 16 and a learning rate of 1e-4 for parameter optimization.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: We conduct the experiments on two public datasets, i.e., IU-Xray [ref]8 and MIMIC-CXR . IU-Xray ¬†The IU-Xray [ref]8 is a widely-used benchmark dataset to evaluate the performance of radiology report generation methods. It contains 7,470 chest Xray images\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object. Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. Generate exactly 40 titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning."
