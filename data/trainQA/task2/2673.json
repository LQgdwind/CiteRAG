      "content": "Paper Title: Computation Rate Maximum for Mobile Terminals in UAV-assisted Wireless Powered MEC Networks with Fairness Constraint\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo ensure the performance of each terminal, we aim to maximize the sum computation bits of all mobile terminals in the entire flight time ∑m=1MUmsuperscriptsubscript𝑚1𝑀subscript𝑈𝑚\\sum_{m=1}^{M}U_{m}, while guaranteeing the fairness of computation bits among different terminals. Based on the Jain’s fairness index , we define the fairness index I𝐼I (1/M≤I≤11𝑀𝐼11/M\\leq I\\leq 1) as Clearly, a larger I𝐼I indicates higher fairness. Accordingly, we define the objective function as a joint function of the computation bits and fairness, as Iω⋅∑m=1MUm⋅superscript𝐼𝜔superscriptsubscript𝑚1𝑀subscript𝑈𝑚I^{\\omega}\\!\\cdot\\!\\sum_{m=1}^{M}U_{m} , where ω𝜔\\omega is a non-negative integer used to adjust the proportion of I𝐼I in the objective function. We intend to optimize the UAV trajectory and the resource allocation of terminals during the flight time of the UAV. Let vu​[n]subscript𝑣𝑢delimited-[]𝑛v_{u}[n] and θu​[n]subscript𝜃𝑢delimited-[]𝑛\\theta_{u}[n] be the flight speed and direction of the UAV in slot n𝑛n, respectively. The UAV trajectory is described by 𝐯u={vu​[n]|n∈𝒩}subscript𝐯𝑢conditional-setsubscript𝑣𝑢delimited-[]𝑛𝑛𝒩\\mathbf{v}_{u}=\\left\\{v_{u}[n]|n\\in\\mathcal{N}\\right\\} and 𝜽u={θu​[n]|n∈𝒩}subscript𝜽𝑢conditional-setsubscript𝜃𝑢delimited-[]𝑛𝑛𝒩\\bm{\\theta}_{u}=\\left\\{\\theta_{u}[n]|n\\in\\mathcal{N}\\right\\}, where 𝒩={1,2,⋯,N}𝒩12⋯𝑁\\mathcal{N}=\\left\\{1,2,\\cdots,N\\right\\}. The resource allocation variables include the transmit powers, offloading times, and CPU frequencies in all the N𝑁N slots. In particular, the resource allocation variables are 𝐏={Pm​[n]|m∈ℳ,n∈𝒩}𝐏conditional-setsubscript𝑃𝑚delimited-[]𝑛formulae-sequence𝑚ℳ𝑛𝒩\\mathbf{P}=\\left\\{P_{m}[n]|m\\in\\mathcal{M},n\\in\\mathcal{N}\\right\\}, 𝐭={tm​[n]|m∈ℳ,n∈𝒩}𝐭conditional-setsubscript𝑡𝑚delimited-[]𝑛formulae-sequence𝑚ℳ𝑛𝒩\\mathbf{t}=\\left\\{t_{m}[n]|m\\in\\mathcal{M},n\\in\\mathcal{N}\\right\\}, and 𝐟={fm​[n]|m∈ℳ,n∈𝒩}𝐟conditional-setsubscript𝑓𝑚delimited-[]𝑛formulae-sequence𝑚ℳ𝑛𝒩\\mathbf{f}=\\left\\{f_{m}[n]|m\\in\\mathcal{M},n\\in\\mathcal{N}\\right\\}.\nNote that, the transmit power and offloading time affect the offloading performance, and the CPU frequency decides the number of local computation bits. Consequently, to maximize the objective function, we should jointly optimize the flight speed and direction of the UAV, and the transmit powers, offloading times, and CPU frequencies of mobile terminals in each slot. Our optimization problem is formulated as where emsubscript𝑒𝑚e_{m} is the initial energy of the m𝑚mth terminal, vum​a​xsuperscriptsubscript𝑣𝑢𝑚𝑎𝑥v_{u}^{max} is the maximum horizontal flying speed of UAV, 𝐪u​[ref]1subscript𝐪𝑢delimited-[]1\\mathbf{q}_{u}[ref]1 and 𝐪u​[N+1]subscript𝐪𝑢delimited-[]𝑁1\\mathbf{q}_{u}[N+1] are respectively the locations of UAV in the first slot and after the last slot, 𝐪Ssubscript𝐪𝑆\\mathbf{q}_{S} and 𝐪Dsubscript𝐪𝐷\\mathbf{q}_{D} are the locations of designed starting point and the destination. C​1𝐶1C1 indicates that the transmit powers and CPU frequencies of terminals should be non-negative. C​2𝐶2C2 restricts that, by each slot, the accumulated energy consumption of a terminal cannot exceed the sum of the initial energy and the energy harvested by this terminal. C​3𝐶3C3 states that the sum of offloading time of all terminals in each slot cannot exceed the duration of a slot. C​4𝐶4C4 and C​5𝐶5C5 give the range of the flight speed and direction of the UAV. C​6𝐶6C6 and C​7𝐶7C7 restrict the starting point and the destination of the UAV. Though problem 𝐏1subscript𝐏1\\mathbf{P}_{1} is a sequential decision problem that can be characterized by a Markov decision process (MDP), the moving trajectories of terminals may be unpredictable and cannot be known in advance. Also, it involves the joint optimization and continuous control of high-dimensional parameters. As a result, traditional optimization approaches fail to solve this problem. For example, offline algorithms such as dynamic planning, successive convex approximation, or block coordinate descending, require the system information a priori; the DQN method  can only deal with problems with discrete or low-dimensional actions ; also, it is a challenge for the policy gradient method  or the actor-critic (AC) method [ref]24 to maintain both high sample efficiency and stable convergence at the same time [ref]25, when they are employed to handle a 𝐏1subscript𝐏1\\mathbf{P}_{1}-like complex high-dimensional DRL task. We thus will introduce the soft actor-critic (SAC) method  to solve this problem in the next section.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: problem is formulated as where emsubscript𝑒𝑚e_{m} is the initial energy of the m𝑚mth terminal, vum​a​xsuperscriptsubscript𝑣𝑢𝑚𝑎𝑥v_{u}^{max} is the maximum horizontal flying speed of UAV, 𝐪u​[ref]1subscript𝐪𝑢delimited-[]1\\mathbf{q}_{u}[ref]1 and 𝐪u​[N+1]subscript𝐪𝑢delimited-[]𝑁1\\mathbf{q}_{u}[N+1] are respectively the locations of UAV in the first slot and after the last slot,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
