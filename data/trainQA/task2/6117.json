      "content": "Paper Title: Structured Sentiment Analysis as Transition-based Dependency Parsing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSince Barnes et al. [ref]17 introduced SSA,\nseveral efforts have tried to fully address that task following an end-to-end framework. In that initial work, they propose to approach SSA as graph-based dependency parsing by transforming original sentiment graphs into bi-lexical dependency-based representations. Then, they directly apply the model by Dozat and Manning : a graph-based dependency parser that processes any sentence with length nùëõn in O‚Äã(n2)ùëÇsuperscriptùëõ2O(n^{2}) by scoring each possible dependency edge and outputting the high-scoring graph. Subsequently, Peng et al. [ref]22 adopted the same encoding strategy and extended the original work by adding a sparse fuzzy attention mechanism to deal with the sparseness of dependency arcs and by exploiting a second-order graph-based parser. In particular, they adopted the parser developed by Wang and Tu . This model leverages second-order information (such as sibling, co-parent and grandparent relations) and scores sets of arcs to compute the highest-scoring dependency graph in O‚Äã(n3)ùëÇsuperscriptùëõ3O(n^{3}). While less efficient, the approach developed by Peng et al. [ref]22 delivered substantial gains in accuracy with respect to the original graph-based model. Very recently, some research works focused on tackling full SSA without resorting to independent dependency parsers. These methods directly predict sentiment graphs without the need for an intermediate dependency representation.\nShi et al.  opted for extracting\ndifferent dependency-based features\nfor representing nodes and edges from the original sentiment graph during training and combining them by means of graph attention networks . Then, during decoding, they\napply a three-stage procedure:\nthey first identify spans, subsequently\nattach each holder and target node to their expression node, and, finally,\ncombine holder-expression and target-expression pairs\nto produce a valid sentiment graph.\nSamuel et al.  adopted the text-to-graph model developed by Samuel and Straka  and augmented it with fine-tuned contextualized embeddings from XLM-R . Their method is then exploited for directly building edges that connect text spans. And, finally, Xu et al. [ref]36 presented a complex transition-based approach equipped with: graph convolutional networks  for encoding high-order features, a specific component exclusively trained for detecting span boundaries, and two separate classifiers for argument labeling and polarity identification.\nDespite surpassing dependency-based methods in terms of accuracy, these task-specific approaches are notably less resource-efficient,\nespecially the top-performing model by Samuel et al.  (which undertakes an expensive fine-tuning of XLM-R-based representations to the specific SSA task). Finally, transition-based models have been successfully applied in a wide range of NLP parsing tasks, including dependency parsing , constituency parsing , semantic dependency parsing , generating abstract meaning representations  or semantic role labeling . In this research work, we further explore transition-based algorithms to solve SSA as dependency parsing and compare them with\nprior graph-based alternatives. Unlike the complex transition-based method by Xu et al. [ref]36 that directly produces sentiment graphs, our model relies on the encoding scheme introduced by Barnes et al. [ref]17 to approach SSA more efficiently.\nDespite being notably simpler, our transition-based model manages to not only outperform dependency-based baselines but also\nsurpass the task-specific method by Xu et al. [ref]36 in the majority of benchmarks.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: Since Barnes et al.
