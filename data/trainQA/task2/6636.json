      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to Select SAT Encodings for Pseudo-Boolean and Linear Integer Constraints\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMany constraint satisfaction and optimisation problems can be solved effectively\nby encoding them as instances of the Boolean Satisfiability problem\n(SAT). Modern SAT solvers are remarkably effective even with large formulas, and\nhave proven to be competitive with (and often faster than) CP solvers (including\nthose with conflict learning). However, even the simplest types of constraints\nhave many encodings in the literature with widely varying performance, and the\nproblem of predicting suitable encodings is not trivial. We explore the problem of selecting encodings for constraints of the form\n∑i=1nqi​ei⋄k⋄superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛subscript𝑞𝑖subscript𝑒𝑖𝑘\\sum_{i=1}^{n}q_{i}e_{i}\\diamond k where ⋄∈{<,≤,=,≠,≥,>}\\diamond\\in\\{<,\\leq,=,\\neq,\\geq,>\\},\nq1​…​qnsubscript𝑞1…subscript𝑞𝑛q_{1}\\ldots q_{n} are integer coefficients, k𝑘k is an integer constant and\neisubscript𝑒𝑖e_{i} are decision variables or simple expressions containing a single decision\nvariable (such as negation).\nWe separate these constraints into two classes:\npseudo-Boolean (PB) when all eisubscript𝑒𝑖e_{i} are Boolean; and\nlinear integer (LI) when there exists an integer expression eisubscript𝑒𝑖e_{i}. We\ntreat these two classes separately, selecting one encoding for each class when\nencoding an instance. We select from a set of state-of-the-art encodings, including all eight\nencodings of Bofill et\nal  [ref]2  which are\nextensions of the Generalized Totalizer , Binary Decision\nDiagram , Global Polynomial\nWatchdog , Local Polynomial Watchdog ,\nSequential Weight Counter , and n-Level Modulo\nTotalizer . All eight of these encodings are for pseudo-Boolean\nconstraints combined with at-most-one (AMO) sets of terms (where at most one of\nthe corresponding eisubscript𝑒𝑖e_{i} Boolean expressions are true in a solution). The AMO sets come from\nan integer variable or are detected automatically  as\ndescribed in Section 2.1.\nWe also use an encoding named Tree which is described in this paper. The context for this work is Savile Row 0, a constraint\nmodelling tool that takes the modelling language Essence Prime and can produce\noutput for various types of solver, including CP, SAT, and recently\nSMT 1. When encoding a constraint to SAT, two\ndifferent approaches may be taken depending on the type of constraint. Some\nconstraint types are decomposed into simpler constraints prior to encoding\n(e.g. allDifferent is decomposed into a set of at-most-one constraints, stating\nthat each relevant domain value appears at most once). Other constraint types\nare encoded to SAT directly, in which case Savile Row will apply the encoding chosen on\nthe command-line (or the default if no choice is made). We use a supervised machine learning approach, trained with a corpus of 614\ninstances from 49 problem classes (constraint models). We show that it is\npossible to select encodings effectively, approaching the performance of the\nvirtual best encoding (i.e. the best possible choice for each instance), using\nan existing set of features for constraint problem instances. Also we obtain\nbetter performance by adding a new set of features specifically designed for the\npseudo-Boolean and linear integer constraints, especially when selecting\nencodings for unseen problem classes. We study two versions of the encoding selection problem: split-by-instance and\nsplit-by-class. In the first, the set of all\ninstances is split into training and test sets with no reference to the\nproblem classes (in common with earlier work 2 3).\nFor any given test instance, the model may have been trained on other instances of the same class.\nIn split-by-class, each test instance belongs to a problem class that was\nnot seen in training. We would argue that split-by-class is a realistic\nand useful version of the encoding selection problem because it is desirable for\nconstraint modelling tools to be robust for new problem classes.\nEven when the encoding and solver settings will be hand-optimised for an important new problem class, a\ngood initial configuration is likely to be useful.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: these two classes separately, selecting one encoding for each class when\nencoding an instance. We select from a set of state-of-the-art encodings, including all eight\nencodings of Bofill et\nal  [ref]2  which are\nextensions of the Generalized Totalizer , Binary Decision\nDiagram , Global Polynomial\nWatchdog , Local Polynomial Watchdog ,\nSequential Weight Counter , and n-Level\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
