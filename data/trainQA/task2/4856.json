      "content": "Paper Title: Sustainable Online Reinforcement Learning for Auto-bidding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the era of Internet, online advertising business has become one of the main profit models for many companies, such as Google [ref]6 and Alibaba [ref]3, which, at the same time, benefits millions of advertisers who are willing to bid for impression opportunities.\nContemporary online advertising systems, as auctioneers, usually have large amount of candidate advertisers contesting for numerous impression opportunities at every moment. Making auction decisions based on accurate evaluation of each impression opportunity for all advertisers within several milli-seconds is computationally infeasible. Therefore,\na real-world advertising system (RAS) adopts a cascade architecture  . In this architecture, the auction of each impression opportunity is completed through several stages. Without loss of generality, we here simply view the RAS as a system with two stages: stage 1 and stage 2, as shown in Fig. 1. The auction process of each impression opportunity is as follows: in stage 1, rough\nevaluations are conducted for all the candidate advertisers (∼106similar-toabsentsuperscript106\\sim 10^{6}), and a group of the most promising advertisers (∼102similar-toabsentsuperscript102\\sim 10^{2}) are fed to the stage 2; and in stage 2, accurate valuations and auction are carried out to determine the winning advertiser of the impression opportunity. The winner will gain the value of the impression opportunity and pay the market price. See Appendix A.1.1 for detailed explanations on the RAS structures.\nFaced with huge amount of impression opportunities at every moment, advertisers cannot bid in the granularity of individual opportunities. Recently, many auto-bidding policies have emerged to realize automatic real-time biddings for each impression opportunity on behalf of advertisers [ref]1   , which significantly increase their revenues. State-of-the-art auto-bidding policies are usually learned with reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms . It was believed that the auto-bidding policy being trained cannot directly access to the RAS during the RL training process for safety concerns [ref]1.\nA common solution in most existing works [ref]1    is to train the auto-bidding policy in a virtual advertising system (VAS) — an offline simulated environment that is built based on the advertisers’ historical data generated in the RAS.\nSee Appendix A.1.2 for the details of the VAS structures. IBOO Challenges.\nHowever, we argue that there exists gaps between the RAS and the VAS,\nwhich makes this common solution suffer from the problem of inconsistencies between online and offline (IBOO).\nHere, online refers to the RAS, while offline refers to the VAS, and inconsistencies refer to the gaps. Formally, we can define the IBOO as follows.\n The IBOO refers to the gaps between the RAS and the VAS that prevent the VAS from accurately simulating the RAS.\n Specifically, there are two dominated gaps between the RAS and the VAS. One is that the VAS cannot accurately simulate the cascade auction architecture of the RAS. For example, due to the constraint on computing power, the VAS\nis built only based on the historical data generated in stage 2 of the RAS111Detailed reasons are shown in Appendix A.1.2., which makes the VAS lack the mechanism of stage 1 in the RAS.\nIn addition, the VAS does not incorporate the exact influences of other advertisers as RAS does, which makes up the second dominated gap. For example, in the RAS, the market prices are determined by the bids of all advertisers which can change during the training process.\nHowever, the VAS always provides constant market prices for the auto-bidding policy being trained. See figures in Appendix A.3 for illustrations.\nEssentially, the IBOO makes the VAS provide the auto-bidding policy with false rewards and state transitions during RL training process.\nAs presented in Table. 1, the auto-bidding policy with better performance in the VAS (i.e., higher R/R∗R/R*) may yield poorer performance in the RAS (i.e., lower A/B test value). Hence, the IBOO can seriously degrade the performance of the auto-bidding policy in the RAS.\nOne way to address the IBOO challenge is to improve the VAS and reduce the gaps as much as possible. However, due to the complex and ever-changing nature of the RAS, the reduction in IBOO is usually very limited, resulting in little improvement in the auto-bidding policy performance for illustrations.\nHence, new schemes need to be devised so as to avoid the IBOO and improve the performance of auto-bidding policies.\nBesides, it is worth noting that the IBOO resembles the sim2real problem studied in other realms, such as computer visions  and robotics . Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that formally put forward the concept of IBOO in the field of auto-bidding and systematically analyzes and resolves it. In this paper, we propose a novel sustainable online reinforcement learning (SORL) framework to address the IBOO challenge. For the first time, the SORL abandons the way of learning with the VAS and trains the auto-bidding policy by directly interacting with the RAS. Notably, the SORL can obtain true rewards and state transitions from the RAS and thereby does not suffer from the IBOO problem.\nThe SORL contains two main algorithms.\nThe first one is a safe and efficient online exploration policy for collecting data from the RAS, named as the SER policy.\nSpecifically, to guarantee the safety of explorations, we design a safety zone to sample actions from based on the Lipschitz smooth property of the Q function we theoretically proved. We also derive the lower bound on the safety degree.\nTo increase the efficiency of explorations, we develop a sampling distribution that can make the collected data give more feedbacks to the auto-bidding policy being trained.\nThe second main algorithm is an effective and stable offline RL method to train the auto-bidding policy based on the collected data, named as the variance-suppressed conservative Q-learning (V-CQL).\nSpecifically, motivated by the observation that the optimal222Here ”optimal” refers to the optimal Q function in the simulated experiments. See Section 4.2 for details. Q function is in the quadratic form, we design a regularization term in the V-CQL to optimize the shape of the Q function. The V-CQL can train the auto-bidding policy with high average, hence effective, and low variance, hence stable, in performance under different random seeds.\nThe whole SORL works in an iterative manner, alternating between collecting data and training the auto-bidding policy.\nExtensive simulated and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: In the era of Internet, online advertising business has become one of the main profit models for many companies, such as Google [ref]6 and Alibaba [ref]3, which, at the same time, benefits millions of advertisers who are willing to bid for impression opportunities.\nContemporary online advertising systems, as auctioneers,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
