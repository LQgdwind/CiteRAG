Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7.

Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

AI and ML have achieved significant breakthroughs starting from supervised learning and rapidly advancing with the development of unsupervised, semi-supervised, reinforcement, and deep learning. The latest frontier of AI technology has arrived as Generative AI . Generative AI models are developed using deep neural networks to learn the pattern and structure of big training corpus to generate similar new content . Generative AI (GenAI) technology can generate different forms of content like text, images, sound, animation, source code, and other forms of data. The launch of ChatGPT  (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), a powerful new generative AI tool by OpenAI in November 2022, has disrupted the entire community of AI/ML technology . ChatGPT has demonstrated the power of generative AI to reach the general public, revolutionizing how people perceive AI/ML. At this time, the tech industry is in a race to develop the most sophisticated Large Language Models (LLMs) that can create a human-like conversation, the result of which is Microsoft’s GPT model , Google’s Bard [ref]6, and Meta’s LLaMa . GenAI has become a common tool on the internet within the past year. With ChatGPT reaching 100 million users within two months of release, suggesting that people who have access to the internet have either used GenAI or know someone who has [ref]8.\nFigure 1 demonstrates the working of an AI-powered chatbot where a user initiates requests, and after analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP), is given a real-time response by the chatbot. This response is analyzed again to provide a better user experience in the proceeding conversation.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: the tech industry is in a race to develop the most sophisticated Large Language Models (LLMs) that can create a human-like conversation, the result of which is Microsoft’s GPT model , Google’s Bard [ref]6, and Meta’s LLaMa .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
