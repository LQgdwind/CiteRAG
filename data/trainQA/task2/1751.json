      "content": "Paper Title: Compacting Deep Neural Networks for Internet of Things: Methods and Applications\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe Graph-based distillation method is a KD technique used in graph neural networks. Lee et al.  proposed a new method for extracting dataset-based knowledge from teacher networks using attention networks. Ma et al. [ref]115 proposed a multi-task knowledge extraction method for graph representation learning that uses graph metrics based on network theory as an auxiliary task through multi-task learning. Meanwhile, Park et al.  proposed distance and angular distillation losses to compensate for structural differences in the relationship. Tian et al.  captured correlation and high-order output correlation by comparing target families and adapted them to extract knowledge from one neural network to another. Liu et al. [ref]117 considered transferring structural information from large networks to small networks for intensive prediction tasks and proposed paired distillation with paired similarities by establishing static diagrams and global distillation with antagonistic training to extract overall knowledge. Gao et al.  proposed residual KD, which further distilled the knowledge by introducing an assistant. Moreover, Vapnik et al. [ref]109 considered a learning paradigm called learning using privileged information. Lopez-Paz et al.  unified distillation and privileged information as generalized distillation, i.e., a framework for learning data representation from multiple machines. Tang et al.  proposed a method for multitask learning to preserve privileged information. Wang et al.  and Xu et al.  combine KD with GAN. Uijlings et al.  proposed that a group of source classes with boundary box annotations be used to revisit the knowledge transfer of training object detectors on the target class of weakly supervised training images. Anil et al.  proposed large-scale distributed neural network training through online distillation. Furlanello et al.  trained and parameterized the same student network as the teacher network, making the student network outperform the teacher network. Tan et al.  used model distillation to learn a global additive explanation describing the relationship between input characteristics and model predictions. Heo et al.  proposed a method for knowledge transfer by extracting activation boundaries formed by cryptogenic neurons. He et al.  made some improvements to traditional distillation methods for the semantics split task. Liu et al.  transferred “knowledge” from multiple deep teacher networks to a deep network student network. Yang et al.  proposed a KD method based on transferring feature statistics from the teacher network to the student network. Song et al.  proposed a framework that transfers knowledge from a large pre-training model to a small model and performs both pre-training and fine-tuning at the same time.\n\nReference markers found: [115]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]115: method is a KD technique used in graph neural networks.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
