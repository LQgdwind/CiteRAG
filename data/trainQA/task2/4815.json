      "content": "Paper Title: Training Debiased Subnetworks with Contrastive Weight Pruning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur theoretical observations elucidate the importance of balancing between the bias-aligned and bias-conflicting samples in discovering the optimal unbiased subnetworks structure. While the true analytical form of the debiasing distribution is unknown in practice, we aim to approximate such unknown distribution with existing bias-conflicting samples and simulate the mixture distribution Pm​i​xηsubscriptsuperscript𝑃𝜂𝑚𝑖𝑥P^{\\eta}_{mix} with modifying sampling strategy. To this end, we propose a Debiased Contrastive Weight Pruning (DCWP) algorithms that learn the unbiased subnetworks structure from the original full-size network. Consider a L𝐿L layer neural networks as a function f𝑾:𝒳→ℝC:subscript𝑓𝑾→𝒳superscriptℝ𝐶f_{\\boldsymbol{W}}:\\mathcal{X}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{C} parameterized by weights 𝑾={𝑾1,…,𝑾L}𝑾subscript𝑾1…subscript𝑾𝐿\\boldsymbol{W}=\\{\\boldsymbol{W}_{1},\\dots,\\boldsymbol{W}_{L}\\}, where C=|𝒴|𝐶𝒴C=|\\mathcal{Y}| is the number of classes. Analogous to the earlier works on pruning, we introduce binary weight pruning masks 𝒎={𝒎1,…,𝒎L}𝒎subscript𝒎1…subscript𝒎𝐿\\boldsymbol{m}=\\{\\boldsymbol{m}_{1},\\dots,\\boldsymbol{m}_{L}\\} to model the subnetworks as f​(⋅;𝒎1⊙𝑾1,…,𝒎L⊙𝑾L)𝑓⋅direct-productsubscript𝒎1subscript𝑾1…direct-productsubscript𝒎𝐿subscript𝑾𝐿f(\\cdot;\\boldsymbol{m}_{1}\\odot\\boldsymbol{W}_{1},\\dots,\\boldsymbol{m}_{L}\\odot\\boldsymbol{W}_{L}). We denote such subnetworks as f𝒎⊙𝑾subscript𝑓direct-product𝒎𝑾f_{\\boldsymbol{m}\\odot\\boldsymbol{W}} for the notational simplicity. We treat each entry of 𝒎lsubscript𝒎𝑙\\boldsymbol{m}_{l} as an independent Bernoulli variable, and model their logits as our new pruning parameters 𝚯={𝚯1,…,𝚯L}𝚯subscript𝚯1…subscript𝚯𝐿{\\boldsymbol{\\Theta}}=\\{{\\boldsymbol{\\Theta}}_{1},\\dots,{\\boldsymbol{\\Theta}}_{L}\\} where 𝚯l∈ℝnlsubscript𝚯𝑙superscriptℝsubscript𝑛𝑙{\\boldsymbol{\\Theta}}_{l}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n_{l}} and nlsubscript𝑛𝑙n_{l} represents the dimensionality of the l𝑙l-th layer weights 𝑾lsubscript𝑾𝑙\\boldsymbol{W}_{l}. Then πl,i=σ⁡(Θl,i)subscript𝜋𝑙𝑖𝜎subscriptΘ𝑙𝑖\\pi_{l,i}=\\operatorname{\\sigma}(\\Theta_{l,i}) denotes the probability of preserving the i𝑖i-th weight of l𝑙l-th layer 𝑾l,isubscript𝑾𝑙𝑖\\boldsymbol{W}_{l,i} where σ𝜎\\operatorname{\\sigma} refers to a sigmoid function. To enable the end-to-end training, the Gumbel-softmax trick [ref]18 for sampling masks together with ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1} regularization term of 𝚯𝚯{\\boldsymbol{\\Theta}} is adopted as a sparsity constraint. With a slight abuse of notations, 𝒎∼G​(𝚯)similar-to𝒎𝐺𝚯\\boldsymbol{m}\\sim G({\\boldsymbol{\\Theta}}) denotes a set of masks sampled with logits 𝚯𝚯{\\boldsymbol{\\Theta}} by applying Gumbel-softmax trick. Then our main optimization problem is defined as follows: where S𝑆S denotes the index set of whole training samples, λℓ1>0subscript𝜆subscriptℓ10\\lambda_{\\ell_{1}}>0 is a Lagrangian multiplier, 𝑾~bold-~𝑾\\boldsymbol{\\tilde{W}} represents the pretrained weights and ℓd​e​b​i​a​ssubscriptℓ𝑑𝑒𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠\\ell_{debias} is our main objective which will be illustrated later. Note that we freeze the pretrained weights 𝑾~bold-~𝑾\\boldsymbol{\\tilde{W}} during training pruning parameters ΘΘ\\Theta. We interchangeably use ℓd​e​b​i​a​s​({(𝒙i,yi)}i=1|S|;Θ)subscriptℓ𝑑𝑒𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝒙𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖𝑖1𝑆Θ\\ell_{debias}\\Big{(}\\{(\\boldsymbol{x}_{i},y_{i})\\}_{i=1}^{|S|};\\Theta\\Big{)} and ℓd​e​b​i​a​s​(S;Θ)subscriptℓ𝑑𝑒𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠𝑆Θ\\ell_{debias}\\big{(}S;\\Theta\\big{)} in the rest of the paper. For comparison with our formulation, we recast the optimization problem of 7 with our notations as follows: where 7 uses the cross entropy (CE) loss function for ℓℓ\\ell. Bias-conflicting sample mining In the first stage, we identify bias-conflicting training samples which empower functional modular probing. Specifically, we train a bias-capturing model and treat an error set Sb​csubscript𝑆𝑏𝑐S_{bc} of the index of misclassified training samples as bias-conflicting sample proxies. Our framework is broadly compatible with various bias-capturing models, where we mainly leverage the ERM model trained with generalized cross entropy (GCE) loss : where q∈(0,1]𝑞01q\\in(0,1] is a hyperparameter controlling the degree of bias amplification, 𝑾Bsubscript𝑾𝐵\\boldsymbol{W}_{B} is the parameters of the bias-capturing model, and pyi​(xi;𝑾B)subscript𝑝subscript𝑦𝑖subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑾𝐵p_{y_{i}}(x_{i};\\boldsymbol{W}_{B}) is a softmax output value of the bias-capturing model assigned to the target label yisubscript𝑦𝑖y_{i}. Compared to the CE loss, the gradient of the GCE loss up-weights the samples with a high probability of predicting the correct target, amplifying the network bias by putting more emphasis on easy-to-predict samples . To preclude the possibility that the generalization performance of DCWP is highly dependent on the behavior of the bias-capturing model, we demonstrate in Section 5 that DCWP is reasonably robust to the degradation of accuracy on capturing bias-conflicting samples. Details about the bias-capturing model and simulation settings are presented in the supplementary material. Upweighting Bias-conflicting samples\nAfter mining the index set of bias-conflicting sample proxies Sb​csubscript𝑆𝑏𝑐S_{bc}, we treat Sb​a=S∖Sb​csubscript𝑆𝑏𝑎𝑆subscript𝑆𝑏𝑐S_{ba}=S\\setminus S_{bc} as the index set of majority bias-aligned samples. Then we calculate the weighted cross entropy (WCE) loss ℓW​C​E​({xi,yi}i=1|S|;𝑾~,Θ)subscriptℓ𝑊𝐶𝐸superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖𝑖1𝑆bold-~𝑾Θ\\ell_{WCE}\\big{(}\\{x_{i},y_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{|S|};\\boldsymbol{\\tilde{W}},\\Theta\\big{)} as follows: where λu​p≥1subscript𝜆𝑢𝑝1\\lambda_{up}\\geq 1 is an upweighting hyperparameter, and where ℓC​Esubscriptℓ𝐶𝐸\\ell_{CE} denotes the cross entropy loss. ℓb​asubscriptℓ𝑏𝑎\\ell_{ba} is defined as similar to ℓb​csubscriptℓ𝑏𝑐\\ell_{bc}. The expectation is approximated with Monte Carlo estimates, where the number of mask 𝒎𝒎\\boldsymbol{m} sampled per iteration is set to 1 in practice. To implement (14), we oversample the samples in Sb​csubscript𝑆𝑏𝑐S_{bc} for λu​psubscript𝜆𝑢𝑝\\lambda_{up} times more than the samples in Sb​asubscript𝑆𝑏𝑎S_{ba}. This sampling strategy is aimed at increasing the mixture weight ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi of the proposed mixture distribution Pm​i​xηsuperscriptsubscript𝑃𝑚𝑖𝑥𝜂P_{mix}^{\\eta} in (5), while we empirically approximate the unknown bias-conflicting group distribution with the sample set Sb​csubscript𝑆𝑏𝑐S_{bc}. Note that although simple oversampling of bias-conflicting samples may not lead to the OOD generalization due to the inductive bias towards memorizing a few counterexamples in overparameterized neural networks , such failure is unlikely reproduced in learning pruning parameters under the strong sparsity constraint. We sample new weight masks 𝒎𝒎{\\boldsymbol{m}} for each training iteration in a stochastic manner, effectively precluding the overparameterized networks from potentially memorizing the minority samples. As a result, DCWP exhibits reasonable performance even with few bias-conflicting samples. Bridging the alignment gap by pruning To fully utilize the bias-conflicting samples, we consider the sample-wise relation between bias-conflicting samples and majority bias-aligned samples. Zhang et al.  demonstrates that the deteriorated OOD generalization is potentially attributed to the distance gap between same-class representations; bias-aligned representations are more closely aligned than bias-conflicting representations, although they are generated from the same-class samples. We hypothesized that well-designed pruning masks could alleviate such geometrical misalignment. Specifically, ideal weight sparsification may guide each latent dimension to be independent of spurious attributes, thereby preventing representations from being misaligned with spuriously correlated latent dimensions. This motivates us to explore pruning masks by contrastive learning. (Related illustrative example in appendix) Following the conventional notations of contrastive learning, we denote f𝑾e​n​c:𝒳→ℝnL−1:subscriptsuperscript𝑓𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑾→𝒳superscriptℝsubscript𝑛𝐿1f^{enc}_{\\boldsymbol{W}}:\\mathcal{X}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{n_{L-1}} as an encoder parameterized by 𝑾=(𝑾1,…,𝑾L−1)𝑾subscript𝑾1…subscript𝑾𝐿1\\boldsymbol{W}=(\\boldsymbol{W}_{1},\\dots,\\boldsymbol{W}_{L-1}) which maps samples into the representations at penultimate layer. Let f𝑾Lc​l​s:ℝnL→ℝC:subscriptsuperscript𝑓𝑐𝑙𝑠subscript𝑾𝐿→superscriptℝsubscript𝑛𝐿superscriptℝ𝐶f^{cls}_{\\boldsymbol{W}_{L}}:\\mathbb{R}^{n_{L}}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{C} be the classification layer parameterized by 𝑾Lsubscript𝑾𝐿\\boldsymbol{W}_{L}. Then f𝑾​(𝒙)=f𝑾Lc​l​s​(f𝑾e​n​c​(𝒙)),∀𝒙∈𝒳formulae-sequencesubscript𝑓𝑾𝒙subscriptsuperscript𝑓𝑐𝑙𝑠subscript𝑾𝐿subscriptsuperscript𝑓𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑾𝒙for-all𝒙𝒳f_{\\boldsymbol{W}}(\\boldsymbol{x})=f^{cls}_{\\boldsymbol{W}_{L}}(f^{enc}_{\\boldsymbol{W}}(\\boldsymbol{x})),\\forall\\boldsymbol{x}\\in\\mathcal{X}. We similarly define f𝒎⊙𝑾e​n​csubscriptsuperscript𝑓𝑒𝑛𝑐direct-product𝒎𝑾f^{enc}_{\\boldsymbol{m}\\odot\\boldsymbol{W}} and f𝒎L⊙𝑾Lc​l​ssubscriptsuperscript𝑓𝑐𝑙𝑠direct-productsubscript𝒎𝐿subscript𝑾𝐿f^{cls}_{\\boldsymbol{m}_{L}\\odot\\boldsymbol{W}_{L}}. For the i𝑖i-th sample 𝒙isubscript𝒙𝑖\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}, let 𝒛i​(𝑾)=norm⁡(f𝑾e​n​c​(𝒙i))subscript𝒛𝑖𝑾normsubscriptsuperscript𝑓𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑾subscript𝒙𝑖\\boldsymbol{z}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{W})=\\operatorname{norm}(f^{enc}_{\\boldsymbol{W}}(\\boldsymbol{x}_{i})) be the normalized representations lies on the unit hypersphere, and similarly define 𝒛i​(𝒎⊙𝑾)subscript𝒛𝑖direct-product𝒎𝑾\\boldsymbol{z}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{m}\\odot\\boldsymbol{W}). We did not consider projection networks  [ref]20 for architectural simplicity. Given index subsets of training samples 𝒱,𝒱+𝒱superscript𝒱\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{V}^{+}, the supervised contrastive loss [ref]20 function is defined as follows: where a∈𝒱∖{i}𝑎𝒱𝑖a\\in\\mathcal{V}\\setminus\\{i\\}, τ>0𝜏0\\tau>0 is a temperature hyperparameter, and 𝒱+​(yi)={k∈𝒱+:yk=yi,k≠i}superscript𝒱subscript𝑦𝑖conditional-set𝑘superscript𝒱formulae-sequencesubscript𝑦𝑘subscript𝑦𝑖𝑘𝑖\\mathcal{V}^{+}(y_{i})=\\{k\\in\\mathcal{V}^{+}:y_{k}=y_{i},k\\neq i\\} indicates the index set of samples with target label yisubscript𝑦𝑖y_{i}. Then, we define the debiased alignment loss as follows: where the expectation is approximated with Monte Carlo estimates as in (14). Intuitively, (LABEL:4.1_eq:_debiased_alignment_loss) reduces the gap between bias-conflicting samples and others (first term), while preventing bias-aligned samples from being aligned too close each other (second term, more discussions in appendix). Finally, our debiased loss in (11) is defined as follows: where λa​l​i​g​n>0subscript𝜆𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑛0\\lambda_{align}>0 is a balancing hyperparameter. Fine-tuning after pruning After solving (11) by gradient-descent optimization, we can obtain the pruning parameters 𝚯∗superscript𝚯{\\boldsymbol{\\Theta}}^{*}. This allows us to uncover the structure of unbiased subnetworks with binary weight masks 𝒎∗={𝒎1∗,…,𝒎L∗}superscript𝒎superscriptsubscript𝒎1…superscriptsubscript𝒎𝐿\\boldsymbol{m}^{*}=\\{\\boldsymbol{m}_{1}^{*},\\dots,\\boldsymbol{m}_{L}^{*}\\}, where 𝒎l∗={𝟙​(σ⁡(Θl,i∗)>1/2)| 1≤i≤nl},∀l∈{1,…,L}formulae-sequencesubscriptsuperscript𝒎𝑙conditional-set1𝜎subscriptsuperscriptΘ𝑙𝑖121𝑖subscript𝑛𝑙for-all𝑙1…𝐿\\boldsymbol{m}^{*}_{l}=\\{\\mathbbm{1}(\\operatorname{\\sigma}(\\Theta^{*}_{l,i})>1/2)\\>|\\>1\\leq i\\leq n_{l}\\},\\forall l\\in\\{1,\\dots,L\\}, and nlsubscript𝑛𝑙n_{l} is a dimensionality of the l𝑙l-th weight. After pruning, we finetune the survived weights 𝑾^=𝒎∗⊙𝑾~bold-^𝑾direct-productsuperscript𝒎bold-~𝑾\\boldsymbol{\\hat{W}}=\\boldsymbol{m}^{*}\\odot\\boldsymbol{\\tilde{W}} using ℓW​C​Esubscriptℓ𝑊𝐶𝐸\\ell_{WCE} in (14) and λa​l​i​g​n​ℓa​l​i​g​nsubscript𝜆𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑛subscriptℓ𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑛\\lambda_{align}\\ell_{align} in (LABEL:4.1_eq:_debiased_alignment_loss).\nInterestingly, we empirically found that the proposed approach works well without the reset  (Related experiments in Section 5). Accordingly, we resume the training while fixing the unpruned pretrained weights.
