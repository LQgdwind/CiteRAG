      "content": "Paper Title: Self-Taught Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning with Weakly Supervised Object Localization and Task-Decomposition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFew-Shot Learning (FSL) is to recognize novel visual concepts with several examples based on the acquired knowledge [ref]1 [ref]2 . It is also taken as a practice paradigm for meta-learning [ref]4 , which learns the method to transfer old knowledge on novel tasks. However, vanilla FSL methods are limited by that old and novel tasks are from the same domain. Obviously, this setting is far from the demands of real-world applications. Thus, Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CD-FSL) is proposed, in which acquired knowledge and novel tasks come from the source domain and the target domain respectively. Accordingly, the domain shift from the source domain to the target one is the main challenge in CD-FSL. There are different embedding distributions in the source and target domain, as shown in Fig. 1. The domain shift results in that the knowledge of domain A can not work well on domain B. A typical method to address this problem is aligning the two distributions by adversarial training , domain alignment  and knowledge distillation . They usually choose some samples from the target domain as an auxiliary set during training. Obviously, these approaches violate the CD-FSL setting, on which the target domain is absolutely unknown during the training on the source domain. Therefore, FT  explores to realize feature transformation without access to the target domain, which employs affine transforms to simulate various feature distributions under different domains. This transformation is not directed to the target domain, which performs unstably on the different target domains. How to employ limited labeled samples to provide a directive metric space for the target source is a research focus in CD-FSL. We observe that directly measuring the distance of the target and the source domain is difficult by limited labeled target samples. By contrast, the tasks of the same domain are highly related, so that these tasks can be decomposed to guide the metric space. This guidance can be formed by employing the labeled samples and self-labeled samples to construct multiple task-oriented metric spaces, which updates parameters to adapt for the target domain quickly, as shown in Fig.1 (c). To construct task-oriented and robust metric spaces, it is important to generate diverse and real samples. The current setting of CD-FSL is transferring universal knowledge (miniImageNet) to fine knowledge. Since the target domains are usually fine-grained datasets, the test samples often have similar backgrounds, as shown in Fig. 2. The share of backgrounds could provide task-oriented and abundant metric spaces for task-decomposition. Thus, we introduce Weakly Supervised Object Localization (WSOL) to find the object regions. WSOL aims at obtaining the localization of objects only with the image-level labels, which has broad applications in video understanding , medical imaging  and remote sensing imagery analysis . Most WSOL methods extract activated regions of feature maps, which is called Class Activation Map (CAM) . These CAM-based approaches have achieved promising results on WSOL. Considering the capability of coverage, we apply the simplest CAM approach to find the discriminative regions and exchange the regions to realize task expansion. To this end, we design inner tasks nesting in few-shot tasks (outer tasks), of which inner tasks learn task-oriented metric spaces by iterations. The inner tasks contain 2 stages, i.e., task-expansion and task-decomposition, which are formed by a task-expansion-decomposition framework. We name it Self-Taught (ST) approach. The illustration of ST is shown in Fig. 3. Specifically, in the Task-Expansion Module (TE-Module), weakly supervised object localization and self-supervised technologies are employed to enrich task-related samples by exchanging and rotating the discriminative regions. The TE-Module generates a more abundant task set. Then the Task-Composition Module (TD-Module) samples tasks from the set produced by TE-Module to finish the inner task, which contains the task of few-shot recognition and rotation classification. After several iterations of inner tasks, the parameters of networks are updated to the optimal metric space for the outer task, i.e., the actual few-shot task. Our ST approach is capable of fully utilizing limited labeled samples to construct target-oriented metric spaces by the task-expansion-decomposition framework. The highlight of our work is three-fold: 1. We propose a task-expansion-decomposition framework, called Self-Taught (ST), for cross-domain few-shot learning, which alleviates the problem of undirected guidance caused by the unknown target domain. Our ST approach can work on many mainstream metric-based FSL methods, which is a plug-and-play framework. 2. We incorporate weakly supervised object localization and self-supervised technologies to construct target-oriented metric spaces, which aims at focusing on discriminative region representations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce weakly supervised object localization to cross-domain few-shot learning. 3. Extensive experiments on eight target benchmark datasets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our ST approach.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Few-Shot Learning (FSL) is to recognize novel visual concepts with several examples based on the acquired knowledge [ref]1 [ref]2 .
