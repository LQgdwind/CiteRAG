      "content": "Paper Title: Two-phase Dual COPOD Method for Anomaly Detection in Industrial Control System\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAnomaly and intrusion detection in ICSs has been the subject of extensive research. System state prediction is the first stage in physics-based detection, as mentioned in [ref]16. For instance, some research employed linear dynamical system modeling   or autoregressive models . The linear dynamical system proposed in  is based on a secure state estimation algorithm that involves Kalman filters for attack detection and state estimation against sensor attacks in a noiseless dynamical system. The work in  makes use of Autoregressive Moving Average models for meter management data anomaly detection. The ARMA model in  is a linear process that assumes that the meter management data is stationary and when the data fluctuates, it does so uniformly around a particular time. Unfortunately, the linearity of the modeled system, which is generally not satisfied in ICSs, is one of the assumptions made by both techniques. Invariant-based techniques   and specification-based system modeling  have been shown to be efficient anomaly detection approaches. Specificity or the requirement that the solution is suited to the system and its operating circumstances is one of the key downsides of invariant-based techniques and specification-based systems. Approaches based on statistical models in the context of anomaly detection typically start by fitting probability distributions to data points. Using the fitted models, the statistical models decide which points are outliers. Parametric and nonparametric methods are two main classes into which these techniques are typically divided. The main distinction is that parametric methods take the data to come from a parametric distribution under the assumption; hence fitting such a distribution entails learning the parameters of the assumed parametric distribution. Both linear regression and Gaussian mixture models (GMM) are used parametric techniques for anomaly detection  . In contrast, nonparametric techniques do not rely on a parametric model of the data. Examples include histogram-based techniques (HBOS) , Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) . After the model fitting process, parametric models for anomaly detection are typically quick to utilize; however, nonparametric models for anomaly detection can be more expensive to deal with. To obtain reliable anomaly detection results, ensemble-based methods integrate the output from different base outlier detectors. Notable works of ensemble based anomaly detection methods include feature bagging , isolation forest [ref]28, locally selective methods , and scalable unsupervised outlier detection . Feature bagging method employs a variety of sub-feature spaces. Isolation forests method combines data from multiple base trees. Locally selective combination in parallel outlier ensembles method dynamically selects the best base estimator for each data point. Scalable unsupervised outlier detection method employs numerous heterogeneous estimators. In general, ensemble-based approaches for anomaly detection frequently perform well in practice, even for high-dimensional datasets  . However, ensemble-based methods can require non-trivial tweaking, such as choosing the appropriate meta-detectors . Ensemble anomaly detection methods are frequently difficult to interpret . The COPOD anomaly detection algorithm is modeled after copulas for multivariate data distribution . Copulas are mathematical functions that let COPOD distinguish between the dependency structure of a given multivariate distribution and the marginal distributions of a dataset. Empirical Cumulative Distribution Functions (ECDF) are first calculated by the authors using a specified dataset. The empirical copula functions are then created using the (ECDF). Finally, the COPOD anomaly detection algorithm uses the empirical copula to approximate the tail probabilities and quantifies the probabilities as the anomaly scores of the data records. The authors in  evaluated their proposed algorithm on 30 public outlier detection benchmark datasets. In each instance, 60% of the data was used for training, and the remaining 40% of the data was used for testing. Through extensive experiments conducted, the authors claim the detection algorithm is a state-of-the-art outlier detection algorithm in terms of detection accuracy and computational cost . An unsupervised outlier detection algorithm known as ECOD, which is inspired by the fact that outliers are often the rare events that occur at the tails of a distribution, is proposed in [ref]14. The authors’ method models each dimension in the dataset using a nonparametric statistical method. The proposed method calculates the ECDF per dimension for each data point in order to first estimate the underlying distribution of the input dataset. The algorithm then estimates the dataset’s tail probabilities across all dimensions using the obtained ECDF. Finally, quantification of the tail probability is utilized to score the data records for outliers in the dataset. The authors conducted in-depth tests using 30 benchmark datasets and claimed that the ECOD algorithm outperforms 11 state-of-the-art baselines in terms of detection accuracy, model efficiency, and scalability. Despite their model’s robust performance, the work in [ref]14 made a simplistic unimodal assumption about the input dataset, and so the approach is not appropriate for multimodal distributions in which an outlier could be in neither left nor right tails. The detection of anomalies in PLCs has also been done using NN-based prediction algorithms . For the purpose of identifying PLC anomalies employing long short-term memory (LSTM), the authors in  presented a non-intrusive power-based anomaly detection approach. With the proposed models, accuracy of up to 98% was obtained. However, identifying malicious code by monitoring the power consumption of the PLC is insufficient as a faulty power supply and a power electronics breakdown, can result in false positive readings .\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: Anomaly and intrusion detection in ICSs has been the subject of extensive research.
