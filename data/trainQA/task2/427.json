      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Various Length Dependence by Dual Recurrent Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLSTM models are popular for temporal information processing .\nAfter the long short-term memory (LSTM)  model was proposed, many variations of LSTM have been developed. Roughly, there exist three approaches, i.e., improvements around the gated units, cell neurons or additional mechanism based. The first category of methods try to reduce the number of gates and trainable variables such as GRU  and MRU [ref]12.\nWith the modified gates, this kind of methods are easier to achieve better performance on a variety of tasks.\nThe second category improves around the cell state updating, such as ON-LSTM [ref]13.\nThe last category of methods use some additive mechanisms such that special dependence or non-sequential information can be learned.\nFor example, the model STA-LSTM pays different levels of attention to the dependence of discriminative joints of skeleton [ref]14; convolutional LSTM  encodes spatial information while processing sequences, etc.\nFurthermore, techniques such as recurrent dropout, recurrent batch normalization, zoneout are always used to improve the performance of gated RNNs models   , and works like  and  which sparse the gated models also provide a performance improvement. Though massive improvements have already been made, these approaches are still relatively complex and sequential dependence is still difficult to be captured.\nAt the same time, the gradient back propagation of very long sequence is also not guaranteed to be stable without vanishing because the uncontrolled forget gates may cause it to decrease.\nSo these approaches cannot process very long sequences well while learning the sequence with general length is rather effective.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: i.e., improvements around the gated units, cell neurons or additional mechanism based. The first category of methods try to reduce the number of gates and trainable variables such as GRU  and MRU [ref]12.\nWith the modified gates, this kind of methods are easier to achieve better performance on a variety of tasks.\nThe second category improves around the cell state updating, such as ON-LSTM\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
