      "content": "Paper Title: A review of ensemble learning and data augmentation models for class imbalanced problems: combination, implementation and evaluation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGradient Boosting is a machine learning technique that can be used for both classification and regression problems. The Gradient Boosting regressor uses the mean-squared error loss, while the Gradient Boosting classifier uses the log-likelihood loss [ref]87, and also known as gradient boosting machines (GBM) . The objective is to minimise the loss function by adding consecutive models that are trained using the error residuals from the previous models . In an ensemble, M𝑀M is the total number of stages, whereas m𝑚m is the current stage of Gradient Boosting. We denote the final model as F​_​M​(x)𝐹_𝑀𝑥F\\_M(x) and F​_​m​(x)𝐹_𝑚𝑥F\\_m(x) is the model obtained after adding base learners. The boosting procedure begins from high bias and gradually reaches low bias F​_​0=γ𝐹_0𝛾F\\_0=\\gamma. Next, each model is added from m=1𝑚1m=1 to m=M𝑚𝑀m=M one at a time, after one other. We obtain the model Fm−1​(x)subscript𝐹𝑚1𝑥F_{m-1}(x) by adding m−1𝑚1m-1 weighted base learners and compute pseudo-residuals for each i𝑖ith training example. We compute the loss L𝐿L given in Equation 5. yisubscript𝑦𝑖y_{i} is the observed value. In Equation\n6, we compute each residual calculation ri​msubscript𝑟𝑖𝑚r_{i}m for i𝑖ith training example to the current base learner m𝑚m on the weighted sum of base learners from 111 to m−1𝑚1m-1, and the initial constant function. Next, we generate a new dataset from the original dataset and train (fit) the base learner hm​(x)subscriptℎ𝑚𝑥h_{m}(x) as shown in Equation 7. Therefore, we calculate Fm​(x)subscript𝐹𝑚𝑥F_{m}(x) using Equation 9: We fit the function hm​(x)subscriptℎ𝑚𝑥h_{m}(x) to the rate of change of loss L𝐿L with respect to Fm−1​(x)subscript𝐹𝑚1𝑥F_{m}-1(x). The function hm​(x)subscriptℎ𝑚𝑥h_{m}(x) approximates the behaviour of the derivative of the loss with respect to Fm−1​(x)subscript𝐹𝑚1𝑥F_{m}-1(x). The function hm​(x)subscriptℎ𝑚𝑥h_{m}(x) represents the direction in which the loss function decreases with respect to Fm−1​(x)subscript𝐹𝑚1𝑥F_{m}-1(x). In Equation 10, we formulate an optimisation problem to find γo​p​t​i​m​u​msubscript𝛾𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚\\gamma_{optimum}: We run the procedure for each base model m=1​t​o​M𝑚1𝑡𝑜𝑀m=1toM and after the M𝑀M iterations, we obtain the final model FM​(x)subscript𝐹𝑀𝑥F_{M}(x) in Equation 11. Gradient Boosting is known for its high accuracy and ability to handle large datasets. According to a study by Chen et al. [ref]88, Gradient Boosting was one of the best machine learning models for various benchmark application datasets. Gradient Boosting can handle categorical variables directly without requiring them to be encoded as numerical values. Chen et al. [ref]88 reported that Gradient Boosting was effective in handling non-linear relationships and was less prone to overfitting than other boosting algorithms. Gradient Boosting does not restrict itself to simple models such as decision trees and neural networks. It can also be used with deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks [ref]119 and other machine learning models. A limitation of Gradient Boosting is that it is slow to train on large datasets [ref]88. Since Gradient Boosting features a series of base models in an ensemble, it cannot be easily implemented with parallel computing. Furthermore, Gradient Boost requires careful tuning of the hyperparameters, such as the number of base models and the learning rate. According to a study by Benntejac et al. , Gradient Boosting requires careful tuning of the parameters to achieve good performance. Gradient Boost is considered to be a black-box model, meaning it is difficult to interpret what is happening inside the model [ref]87. Finally, Gradient Boosting learns the new model very quickly, which leads to over-fitting. This can be addressed by slowing the learning using a weighting factor for the corrections by new predictors (base models), known as the learning rate and shrinkage . Some examples of Gradient Boosting applications are disease risk assessment , credit risk assessment , mobility prediction , anti-money laundering , optimisation of transduction , strength prediction , travel time prediction , modelling energy consumption , geography  , medical diagnosis   , image recognition . It is worth mentioning that Gradient Boost has been widely used in Kaggle 333https://www.kaggle.com/ and other machine learning competitions. Examples of applications of Gradient Boosting for imbalanced data are spam filtering , stroke diagnosis , modelling energy consumption , fraud detection , anomaly detection , and natural language processing .\n\nReference markers found: [87]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]87: can be used for both classification and regression problems.
