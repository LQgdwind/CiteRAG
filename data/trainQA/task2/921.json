      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-grained Semantics-aware Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn many real-world applications, such as social networks, recommendation systems, and biological networks, data can be naturally organised as graphs¬†.\nNevertheless, working with this powerful node and graph representations remains a challenge, since it requires integrating the rich inherent features and complex structural information.\nTo address this challenge, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which generalise deep neural networks to graph-structured data, have drawn remarkable attention from academia and industry, and achieve state-of-the-art performances in a multitude of applications¬†[ref]32 .\nThe current literature on GNNs can be used for tasks with two categories.\nOne is to learn node representations to perform tasks such as link prediction¬† and node classification¬† .\nThe other is to learn graph representations for tasks, such as graph classification¬†[ref]37 [ref]9 . On node-wise tasks, existing GNN models on learning node representations rely on a similar methodology that utilises a GNN layer to aggregate the sampled neighbouring nodes‚Äô features in a number of iterations, via non-linear transformation and aggregation functions.\nIts effectiveness has been widely proved, however, a major limitation of these GNN models is that they are inherently flat as they only propagate information across the observed edges in the original graph.\nThus, they lack the capacity to encode features in the high-order neighbourhood in the graphs¬† .\nFor example, in an academic collaboration network, flat GNN models could capture the micro semantic (e.g., co-authorships) between authors, but neglect their macro semantics (e.g., belonging to different research institutes). On the other hand, graph classification is to predict the label associated with an entire graph by utilising the given graph structure and initial node features.\nNevertheless, existing GNNs for graph classification are unable to learn graph representations in a multi-grained manner, which is crucial to encode better meso- and macro-level graph semantics hidden in the graphs for many practical applications such as drug design¬† and program analysis¬†8.\nTo remedy this limitation, novel pooling approaches have been proposed, where sets of nodes are recursively aggregated to form super nodes in the pooled graph.\nDiffPool¬†[ref]37 is a differentiable pooling operator but its assignment matrix is too dense¬† to apply on large graphs.\ng-U-Net¬†[ref]9, SagPool¬†6, GXN¬† and ASAP¬† are four recently proposed methods that adopt the Top-kùëòk selection strategy to address the sparsity concerns of DiffPool.\nThey score nodes based on a learnable projection vector and select a fraction of high scoring nodes as super nodes.\nHowever, the pre-defined pooling ratio limits these models‚Äô adaptivity on graphs with different sizes, and the Top-kùëòk selection may easily lose important node features or graph structure by simply ignoring low scoring nodes.\nAs shown in Figure¬†1 (Section¬†2), different numbers of kùëòk will significantly affect the number of covered nodes of super nodes in the pooled graph, which means the important nodes‚Äô features could get lost during the trivial pooling strategy.\nThe hyper-parameter kùëòk is also crucial for the final performance¬†[ref]9, thus reduces their convenience in applications. In the end, we argue that node- and graph-wise tasks are inherently correlated with one another.\nThat said, node representations form graph representation, and graph representation can provide node representations with meso/macro-level semantic information in the graph.\nJoint modelling with node- and graph-wise tasks will allow GNNs to overcome the limitation of flat propagation mode in capturing multi-grained semantics,\nand the enriched node representation could further ameliorate the graph representation.\nHowever, to the best of our knowledge, none of the existing work simultaneously exploit node- and graph-wise tasks, along with capturing multi-grained semantics hidden in the graph, to learn representations of nodes and the graph. In this work, we propose a novel framework, Adaptive Multi-grained Graph Neural Networks (AdamGNN), which integrates graph convolution, adaptive pooling and unpooling operations into one framework to generate both node and graph level representations interactively.\nUnlike the above-mentioned GNN models, we treat node and graph representation learning tasks in a unified framework so that they can collectively optimise each other during training.\nIn modelling multi-grained semantics, the adaptive pooling and unpooling operators preserve the important node features and hierarchical structural features.\nMore concretely, as shown in Figure¬†2-(a),\nwe employ (i) an adaptive graph pooling (AGP) operators to generate a multi-grained structure based on the derived primary node representations by a GNN layer,\n(ii) graph unpooling (GUP) operators to further distribute the explored meso- and macro-level semantics to the corresponding nodes of the original graph,\nand (iii) a flyback mechanism to integrate all received multi-grained semantic messages as the evolved node representations.\nBesides, the attention-enhanced flyback aggregator provides a reasonable explanation of the importance of messages from different grains.\nExperimental results reveal the effectiveness of AdamGNN, and the ablation and empirical studies confirm the effectiveness and flexibility of different components in AdamGNN.\nAt last, through case studies, AdamGNN is shown to highlight variant-range node interactions in different graph datasets. Our contributions can be summarised as follows.\n(1) We propose a novel framework, AdamGNN111Code and data are available at: https://github.com/zhiqiangzhongddu/AdamGNN,\nthat adaptively integrates multi-grained semantics into node representations and achieves mutual optimisation between node-wise and graph-wise tasks in one unified process.\n(2) An adaptive and efficient pooling operator is devised in AdamGNN to generate the multi-grained structure without introducing any hyper-parameters.\n(3) An attention-based flyback aggregation can provide model explainability on how different grains benefit the prediction tasks.\n(4) Extensive experiments on 141414 real-world datasets demonstrate the promising performance of AdamGNN, along with providing insightful explanations with case studies.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: which generalise deep neural networks to graph-structured data, have drawn remarkable attention from academia and industry, and achieve state-of-the-art performances in a multitude of applications¬†[ref]32 .\nThe current literature on GNNs can be used for tasks with two categories.\nOne is to learn node representations to perform tasks such as link prediction¬† and node classification¬† .\nThe other\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
