      "content": "Paper Title: Towards real-world navigation with deep differentiable planners\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPlanning in fully-known deterministic state spaces was partially solved by graph-search algorithms [ref]10     .\nA Markov Decision Process (MDP) [ref]3 [ref]44\nconsiders probabilistic transitions and rewards, enabling planning on stochastic models and noisy environments.\nWith known MDPs, Value Iteration achieves the optimal solution [ref]3 [ref]44.\nReinforcement Learning (RL) focuses on unknown MDPs\n    .\nModel-free RL systems are reactive; a policy (i.e. a generic plan) is built over a long period of trial and error, and will be specific to the training environment (there is no online planning).\nThis makes them less ideal for robotics, where risky failures must be avoided, and new plans (policies) must be created on-the-fly in new environments.\nModel-based RL methods attempt to learn an MDP and often use it for planning online     . The environment is assumed to provide a reward signal at every step in both cases. Several works have made advances into training deep networks for navigation.\nThe Neural Map  is an A2C  agent (thus reactive) that reads and writes to a differentiable memory (i.e. a map).\nSimilarly, Mirowski et al.  train reactive policies which are specific to an environment.\nThe Value Prediction Network  learns an MDP and its state-space from data, and plans with a single roll-out over a short horizon.\nHausknecht et al.  add recurrence to deep Q-learning to address partially-observable environments, but considering only single-frame occlusions.\nSeveral works treat planning as a non-differentiable module, and focus on training neural networks for other aspects of the navigation system.\nSavinov et al.  do this by composing siamese networks and value estimators trained on proxy tasks, and use an initial map built from footage of a walk through the environment.\nActive Neural SLAM  trains a localisation and mapping component (outputting free space and obstacles), a policy network to select a target for the non-differentiable planner, and another to perform low-level control.\nSubsequent work  complemented this map with semantic segmentation.\nThis map is different from ours, which consists of embeddings learned by a differentiable planner, and so are not constrained to correspond to annotated labels.\nThe later two works navigate successfully in large simulations of 3D-scanned environments, and were transferred to real robots. To avoid learning by trial-and-error, Imitation Learning instead uses expert trajectories.\nInverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)  1 0  achieves this by learning a reward function that best explains the expert trajectories.\nHowever, this generally leads to a difficult nested optimisation and is an ill-posed problem, since many reward functions can explain the same trajectory. Tamar et al.  introduced the Value Iteration Network (VIN) for Imitation Learning, which generates a plan online (with value iteration) and back-propagates errors through the plan to train estimators of the rewards (Sec. 3.1).\nVINs were also applied to localisation from partial observations by Karkus et al. , but assuming a full map of the environment.\nLee et al.  replaced the maximum over actions in the VI formula with a LSTM.\nThe evaluation included an extension to rotation, but assuming a fully-known four directional view for every gridded state, which is often not available in practice.\nA subtle difference is that they handle rotation by applying a linear policy layer to the hidden channels of a 2D state-space grid, which is less interpretable than our 3D translation-rotation grid. Most previous work on deploying VIN to robots   assume an occupancy map and goal map rather than learning the map embedding and goal themselves from data.\nTo the best of our knowledge, Gupta et al.’s Cognitive Mapper and Planner (CMP)  is the only work which evaluated a differentiable planner on real-world data using map embeddings learned end-to-end.\nCMP uses a hierarchical VIN  to plan on larger environments, and updates an egocentric map.\nIt handles rotation as a warping operation external to the VIN (i.e. it plans in a 2D translation state-space, not 3D translation-rotation space).\nWarping an egocentric map per update achieves scalability at the cost of progressive blurring of the embeddings.\nCMP was evaluated for rotations of 90​°90° and deterministic motion, rather than noisy translation and rotation.\nOur 3D translation-rotation space and learned transition model allows smooth trajectories with finer rotations.\nCMP also requires gathering new trajectories online during training (with DAgger ), while ours is trained solely with a fixed set of training trajectories,\nforegoing the need for a simulator and the associated domain gap.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: Planning in fully-known deterministic state spaces was partially solved by graph-search algorithms [ref]10     .\nA Markov Decision Process (MDP) [ref]3 [ref]44\nconsiders probabilistic transitions and rewards, enabling planning on stochastic models and noisy environments.\nWith known MDPs, Value\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
