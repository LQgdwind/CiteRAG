Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Survey on Table Question Answering: Recent Advances\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe research on table QA has been increasing over the past few years due to the availability of large datasets. In this survey, we present an overview of these table QA datasets. As shown in Table 3, most of the datasets are closed-domain, and their question type is factoid 111We extend the question type with free form and multiple choice, which originally includes factoid, list, definition and complex.. Table-only Datasets contain database tables or non-database tables without pre/post-annotation. These datasets contain different kinds of supervision for model training. Some datasets, such as WikiSQL  and Spider[ref]47, provide logical form annotations as supervision. However, others provide the final answers as supervision, for example, WTQ  and SQA [ref]8.\nMost of the table-only datasets consist of relational tables with regular structure except HiTab [ref]8 and AITQA , whose tables have hierarchical structure and a number of merged cells. Non-table-only Datasets include samples that consist of a table and its pre/post-annotation. Among these datasets, OTTQA [ref]5 and NQ-tables , which are used for open-domain table QA, are constructed from existing closed-domain datasets. TAT-QA  and FinQA  are extracted from financial reports with a large number of tables. Moreover, researchers propose TabMCQ  and GeoTSQA  datasets that contain multiple choice questions. Generally, non-table-only datasets require modelling over tables and text, which have been a popular and challenging research topic in recent years.\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: contain database tables or non-database tables without pre/post-annotation. These datasets contain different kinds of supervision for model training. Some datasets, such as WikiSQL  and Spider[ref]47, provide logical form annotations as supervision. However, others provide the final answers as supervision, for example, WTQ  and SQA [ref]8.\nMost of the table-only datasets consist of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
