      "content": "Paper Title: Uncertainty Detection and Reduction in Neural Decoding of EEG Signals\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe take a probabilistic modeling approach of input uncertainty, and propagate the uncertainty through the neural decoder with assumed density filtering (ADF) . We denote the underlying noise free signal with 𝐱¯¯𝐱\\mathbf{\\bar{x}}, and the noise corrupted input as 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x}, which can be modeled with distribution where u𝑢u is the variance which depicts uncertainty in source signal. The joint distribution of the hidden states in intermediate layers of decoder can be represented as with z0=xsuperscript𝑧0𝑥z^{0}=x. In assumed density filtering, the conditional probability is approximated as where the moments of the distribution are where fisuperscript𝑓𝑖f^{i} is the function performed with the i𝑖ith layer of the neural network. 𝔼p​(zi−1)subscript𝔼𝑝superscript𝑧𝑖1\\mathbb{E}_{p(z^{i-1})} and 𝕍p​(zi−1)subscript𝕍𝑝superscript𝑧𝑖1\\mathbb{V}_{p(z^{i-1})} are the first and second moments of the underlying distribution. Forward propagating with this recursive conditional probabilistic rule produces μlsuperscript𝜇𝑙\\mu^{l} and vlsuperscript𝑣𝑙v^{l} for the final decoding layer, which corresponds to the network prediction and its corresponding variance. The probabilistic propagation can be performed on common neural network structures such as convolutional layer, ReLU activation layer, batch normalization layer and pooling layer etc., corresponding to the different f​(z)𝑓𝑧f(z) functions. The propagation rule outlined in eq. 4 and eq. 5 can either be exactly derived or through probabilistic approximation. The convolutional layer performs linear operations in which μisuperscript𝜇𝑖\\mu^{i} and visuperscript𝑣𝑖v^{i} don’t correlate with each other, allowing straight forward calculation of the two terms in closed form. The Relu layer, although nonlinear in nature, also leads to closed form solutions as derived in . Other types of operations, e.g. max pooling, requires probabilistic approximation for tractable computation, as detailed in [ref]42. Please note this ADF propagation don’t impose additional modification on the network structure. The number of parameters in the network also remains the same as its non-probabilistic counterpart. The only difference is that each layer receives the paired values (mean and variance) as input and also output the paired value to the next layer. Different ways exist to estimate the noise level u𝑢u in the input signal. Previous works either uses a user defined constant  or estimate the noise level from the data [ref]5. Using a constant is computationally efficient, but in general it is not easy to accurately get the prior information of input noise characteristics. Learning the input noise from data is able to reflect the change from different input sources and increases the model’s adaptation ability. However, its implementation requires tailored modification on the network architecture and hinders its application on existing classifiers. For applications in EEG signal analysis, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is either available or can be readily computed with well developed techniques . Another approach is to perform a grid search on a range of noise values for optimized NLL,\nas NLL is minimized when the\nmagnitude of assumed input noise matches the underlying\nground truth.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: nonlinear in nature, also leads to closed form solutions as derived in . Other types of operations, e.g. max pooling, requires probabilistic approximation for tractable computation, as detailed in [ref]42.
