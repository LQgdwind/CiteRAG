      "content": "Paper Title: RANC: Reconfigurable Architecture for Neuromorphic Computing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMapping convolution onto neuromorphic architectures is either restricted in size or is often inefficient due to the need for extensive repetition of input data . From size point of view, for instance, the best CIFAR10 network reported by  requires 31,492 cores. Given that CIFAR images are only 32x32, there are scalability challenges for applications that require processing larger images such as 512x512 images from the EM segmentation challenge dataset [ref]28.From inefficiency point of view, studies have shown that crossbar underutilization is a challenge when mapping neural network connections to neuromorphic architectures [ref]20 . The inefficiency of mapping convolution can be reduced by increasing the percent of the total image available within a single core.\nIf the entirety of the image can be sent to a core, then the need for all axon redundancy is eliminated and a larger fraction of the core’s neurons can be used.\nThis is because all possible strides of each convolutional filter can be calculated as every input is available for computation.\nWhen an image can not fit entirely within a single core, computations must be split across multiple cores, and pixels that are shared between kernels located in different cores must be replicated.\nAn alternative method for addressing the mapping inefficiency for convolution could be scaling down the kernel size for a layer, or increasing feature counts. This approach allows more strides to be calculated within a single core and decreases the amount of input data replication required for the next core. However, network design decisions should not be forced upon the designer purely due to restrictions of the deployment hardware. Instead, they should be guided collectively by insights from both hardware and software design perspectives to jointly optimize application performance and hardware efficiency, and they should converge to values that enable the application designer to maximize performance without requiring expensive tradeoffs caused by mismatch in hardware capabilities. Figure  8 provides an illustration of the convolution mapping  that utilizes a neuron to represent a single output feature of a convolutional stride, with each connected axon supplying an input value from the image.\nIn this example, we assume that the image is 4x4, the kernel is 2x2, and each core has 20 axons with 6 neurons.\nTwo axons are used per input pixel to allow for ternary kernel weights of -1, 0, or 1.\nTernary weights limit this axon configuration to process a maximum of 10 pixels worth of input data per core, therefore a core can process a maximum of 3x3 input region that allows for a maximum of 4 cores.\nDue to the overlapping regions, only 9 of the 24 total neurons are utilized in overall.\nPixels 6, 7, 10, and 11 are replicated in all 4 cores.\nPixels within the middle of the perimeter of the image are replicated twice.\nAmong all 4 cores, unique axon usage is 40%, and 60% of axons are either unconnected or receiving a duplicate input. Adjusting the core input size to accommodate the full image is infeasible within fixed neuromorphic architectures as the per-core axon count is a set value across the system, typically well below the number required for an entire image. The RANC emulator allows the designer to configure axon and neuron counts per core, which can be tuned to be a function of the network’s input image size and kernel parameters.\nFor example, in the provided example above, a custom convolutional core of 32 axons and 9 neurons perfectly maps the operation with no waste. Although the individual core resource usage itself is greater, the same operation that originally required 4 cores or 80 axons now uses a single core with 32 axons.\nWhile this larger core would come at the cost of a slower tick rate as the computations required within the core controller increase, this tradeoff can be seen as desirable by reducing resources enough such that many parallel classifiers can be instantiated with the savings. To explore this, in this section, we utilize RANC’s ability to deploy heterogeneous cores and propose dedicated convolution cores that reduce the need for input redundancy.\nBy increasing the axon and neuron counts per core, we show that we are able to improve axon utilization without sacrificing the classification accuracy.\nFor this, we set up a controlled experiment starting with the RANC architecture defined based on the VMM study that supports symmetric threshold. We refer to this implementation as the Default configuration.\nWe establish a common data preparation and network training flow that is shared between the two configurations, and as such the only variation occurs on the architecture.\nBy controlling variation to only be within the architecture, we evaluate the impact of the proposed heterogeneous core configurations on hardware performance with respect to post-routing FPGA resource usage, latency, and classification throughput with networks trained for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and CIFAR-10 image classification. We end by noting that, as these changes affect only architectural mapping strategies, the network behavior is unchanged, and as such, classification accuracy is not compromised.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: Given that CIFAR images are only 32x32, there are scalability challenges for applications that require processing larger images such as 512x512 images from the EM segmentation challenge dataset [ref]28.From inefficiency point of view, studies have shown that crossbar underutilization is a challenge when mapping neural network connections to neuromorphic architectures [ref]20 .
