      "content": "Paper Title: PerceiverS: A Multi-Scale Perceiver with Effective Segmentation for Long-Term Expressive Symbolic Music Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent advancements in music generation, especially in audio generation models such as AudioLDM [ref]1, MusicGen [ref]2, and Jen-1 , have demonstrated significant progress, with these models capable of generating highly natural-sounding music. However, symbolic music generation, an area where models can generate and manipulate music in symbolic form, plays a crucial role in the field of music generation, particularly due to its editable nature. This allows for operations such as cutting and rearranging different sections or substituting instrument timbres, enabling human involvement in high-quality music production during the post-processing stage. Compared to audio generation, symbolic music offers a further level of abstraction, making it easier for machine learning models to capture deeper musical characteristics and understanding. However, the symbolic music generation still faces two key challenges. First, despite the advancements, many of the most expressive datasets, recorded from live performances and recording studios, are seldom used compared to manually created MIDI-file datasets. The primary reason is that they lack detailed annotations, making it harder for models to learn complex structures. Furthermore, due to computational limitations, these models cannot fully capture the context of an entire piece of music. Techniques, such as chunking and quantization, are often employed to reduce computational complexity, leading to the loss of crucial musical details and making it difficult for models to grasp the full structure of a composition. Second, the waterfall-like approaches that use abstract structural representations as conditions for music generation tasks have enabled the generation of structured music. However, such methods rely heavily on handcrafted feature engineering. Our objective is to design and develop a model that is capable of learning the long-range dependencies in music without relying on explicit structural annotations. The emergence of Transformer Attention technologies, such as Perceiver AR [ref]4, has made it possible to access much longer contextual dependencies. It allows for the simultaneous learning of musical structure and the generation of expressive performances. Perceiver AR has demonstrated the ability to attend to a context length of up to 32,768 tokens using the Maestro dataset , where the query in cross-attention attends to significantly longer key/value pairs  [ref]4. However, this approach has also introduced challenges. Specifically, the causal mask, when applied with the default input sequence segmentation, does not fully conceal tokens that should not be visible during autoregressive training and generation, which ultimately degrades the quality of the generated music. Additionally, when using ultra-long context as a condition, the model tends to generate identical or similar repetitive segments as the sequence length increases due to issues with high similarity in the context of neighboring tokens, which leads to a high token autocorrelation  tendency. To address the challenges mentioned above, in this paper, we propose PerceiverS, a novel model that addresses the causal masking issue by incorporating Effective Segmentation. Additionally, PerceiverS employs Multi-Scale attention to mitigate the high token autocorrelation problem that arises from relying solely on long-range dependencies. Specifically, by adjusting the input sequence segmentation to start from the head segment with an effective causal mask and aggressively increasing the segment length up to the maximum input sequence length, we resolve the learning limitations caused by the causal mask in Perceiver AR [ref]4. Additionally, by incorporating Multi-Scale masks across multiple layers of cross-attention, the model considers both ultra-long and short-range attention simultaneously. This approach addresses the limitation in Perceiver AR, which focuses solely on long-range attention [ref]4. Different from Perceiver AR, our approach enhances symbolic music generation by effectively capturing both long-term structural dependencies and short-term expressive details. Through improved segmentation and multi-scale attention mechanisms, PerceiverS generates coherent, diverse music without relying on extensive structural annotations. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed PerceiverS. The experimental results demonstrate an average 40% improvement in Overlap Area when measured against the original training dataset, highlighting a substantial advantage of our approach over Perceiver AR [ref]4 in generating high-quality symbolic music.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Recent advancements in music generation, especially in audio generation models such as AudioLDM [ref]1, MusicGen [ref]2, and Jen-1 , have demonstrated significant progress, with these models capable of generating highly natural-sounding music.
