      "content": "Paper Title: On the Complexity of Verification of Time-Sensitive Distributed Systems: Technical Report\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe again point out that in our previous work     we only dealt with finite traces. The additional challenge in addressing the complexity of the Z𝑍Z and S𝑆S problems\nin  and the new verification problems L𝐿L and V𝑉V in this paper, is to deal with infinite traces. Assume throughout this section the following: ΣΣ\\Sigma – A finite alphabet with J𝐽J predicate symbols and E𝐸E constant and function symbols; 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} – A progressing timed MSR\nconstructed over ΣΣ\\Sigma; 𝒮0subscript𝒮0\\mathcal{S}_{0} – An initial configuration; m𝑚m – The number of facts in the initial configuration 𝒮0subscript𝒮0\\mathcal{S}_{0}; 𝒞​𝒮𝒞𝒮\\mathcal{CS} – A critical configuration specification constructed over ΣΣ\\Sigma; k𝑘k – An upper-bound on the size of facts; Dm​a​xsubscript𝐷𝑚𝑎𝑥D_{max} – An upper-bound on the numeric values of 𝒮0,𝒯subscript𝒮0𝒯\\mathcal{S}_{0},\\mathcal{T} and 𝒞​𝒮𝒞𝒮\\mathcal{CS}. For the Z𝑍Z problem and the S𝑆S problem, PSPACE-completeness for PTSes was proved in  [ref]17.\nPSPACE-hardness of the L𝐿L problem for PTSes\ncan be shown by adequately adapting our previous work  [ref]17. The L𝐿L problem\nfor PTSes\nthat use the l.t.s. is PSPACE-hard.\n The Z𝑍Z problem is an instance of the problem of checking whether a configuration is not a point-of-no-return.\nRecall that a system satisfies the Z𝑍Z property if there exists a compliant infinite time trace 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} from the initial configuration in which global time tends to infinity.\nSince 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} is progressing, we obtain the condition on time (time tends to infinity) from Proposition 2.\nIndeed, a system satisfies the Z𝑍Z property if and only if the initial configuration is not a point-of-no-return.\nSince PSPACE and co-PSPACE are the same complexity class\nand the Z𝑍Z property is PSPACE-hard, the problem of determining whether a configuration is a point-of-no-return  is PSPACE-hard. Since the L𝐿L property problem comprises checking whether a configuration is a point-of-no-return,\nit is PSPACE-hard.\n∎ Infinite traces over configurations of PTSes are infinite time traces (Proposition 2). The same holds for traces over\nδ𝛿\\delta-representations of PTSes.\nFor our verification problems we, therefore, need to construct an infinite compliant trace. The following lemma establishes a criterion. For a PTS 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} assume Σ,𝒮0,m,𝒞​𝒮,k,Dm​a​xΣsubscript𝒮0𝑚𝒞𝒮𝑘subscript𝐷𝑚𝑎𝑥\\Sigma,\\mathcal{S}_{0},m,\\mathcal{CS},k,D_{max} as described above. If there is a compliant trace (constructed using δ𝛿\\delta-representations) starting with the δ𝛿\\delta-representation of 𝒮0subscript𝒮0\\mathcal{S}_{0} with length LΣ​(m,k,Dm​a​x)subscript𝐿Σ𝑚𝑘subscript𝐷𝑚𝑎𝑥L_{\\Sigma}(m,k,D_{max}), then there is an infinite compliant trace starting with the δ𝛿\\delta-representation of 𝒮0subscript𝒮0\\mathcal{S}_{0}.\n  Since there are only LΣ​(m,k,Dm​a​x)subscript𝐿Σ𝑚𝑘subscript𝐷𝑚𝑎𝑥L_{\\Sigma}(m,k,D_{max}) different δ𝛿\\delta-representations, a trace of length greater than LΣ​(m,k,Dm​a​x)subscript𝐿Σ𝑚𝑘subscript𝐷𝑚𝑎𝑥L_{\\Sigma}(m,k,D_{max}) necessarily contains the same δ𝛿\\delta-representations twice, that is, there is a loop in the trace. By repeating the δ𝛿\\delta-representations appearing in the loop, we can construct an infinite trace which is necessarily compliant.\n∎ For our complexity results we use some auxiliary functions with configurations or δ𝛿\\delta-representations as their arguments, as suitable.\nFor our next results involving the four properties,\nassume that for any given timed MSR 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T}, an initial configuration 𝒮0subscript𝒮0\\mathcal{S}_{0} and a critical configuration specification 𝒞​𝒮𝒞𝒮\\mathcal{CS}\nwe have two functions,  and 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}, which check, respectively, whether a rule in 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} is applicable to a given δ𝛿\\delta-representation and whether a δ𝛿\\delta-representation is critical with respect to 𝒞​𝒮𝒞𝒮\\mathcal{CS}. Moreover, for a given timed MSR 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T}, let ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} be a function implementing the l.t.s. a δ𝛿\\delta-representation of\nsystem 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T}, and returns 1 when the T​i​c​k𝑇𝑖𝑐𝑘Tick must be applied and 0 when it must not be applied according to the l.t.s. We assume that , 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}, and ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} run in Turing space bounded by a polynomial in m,k,log2⁡(Dm​a​x)𝑚𝑘subscript2subscript𝐷𝑚𝑎𝑥m,k,\\log_{2}(D_{max}). Notice that for our examples this is the case, as such functions can be constructed because the system is balanced and facts are of bounded size. Because of Lemma 2, we can show that the Z𝑍Z problem is in PSPACE by searching for compliant traces of length LΣ​(m,k,Dm​a​x)subscript𝐿Σ𝑚𝑘subscript𝐷𝑚𝑎𝑥L_{\\Sigma}(m,k,D_{max}) (stored in binary). To do so, we rely on the fact that PSPACE and NPSPACE are the same complexity class . For a PTS 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} assume Σ,𝒮0,m,𝒞​𝒮,k,Dm​a​xΣsubscript𝒮0𝑚𝒞𝒮𝑘subscript𝐷𝑚𝑎𝑥\\Sigma,\\mathcal{S}_{0},m,\\mathcal{CS},k,D_{max}, ,𝒳,\\mathcal{X}, and ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} as described above. There is an algorithm that, given an initial configuration 𝒮0subscript𝒮0\\mathcal{S}_{0}, decides whether 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} satisfies the Z𝑍Z property with respect to the l.t.s., 𝒞​𝒮𝒞𝒮\\mathcal{CS}, and 𝒮0subscript𝒮0\\mathcal{S}_{0} and the algorithm runs in a space bounded by a polynomial in m,k𝑚𝑘m,k and l​o​g2​(Dm​a​x)𝑙𝑜subscript𝑔2subscript𝐷𝑚𝑎𝑥log_{2}(D_{max}). The polynomial is in fact  log2⁡(LΣ​(m,k,Dm​a​x))subscript2subscript𝐿Σ𝑚𝑘subscript𝐷𝑚𝑎𝑥\\log_{2}(L_{\\Sigma}(m,k,D_{max})).\n  We now consider the S𝑆S problem. Recall that in order to prove that 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} satisfies the S𝑆S property with respect to the l.t.s., a critical configuration specification 𝒞​𝒮𝒞𝒮\\mathcal{CS} and an initial configuration 𝒮0subscript𝒮0\\mathcal{S}_{0}, we must show that 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} satisfies the Z𝑍Z property w.r.t. the l.t.s., 𝒞​𝒮𝒞𝒮\\mathcal{CS} and 𝒮0subscript𝒮0\\mathcal{S}_{0},\nand that all infinite traces 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} that use the l.t.s. and start with 𝒮0subscript𝒮0\\mathcal{S}_{0} are compliant with respect to 𝒞​𝒮𝒞𝒮\\mathcal{CS}, and that the global time in 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} tends to infinity (Definition 13). Checking that a system satisfies the Z𝑍Z property is PSPACE-complete as we have just shown. Moreover, the property that time tends to infinity follows from Proposition 2 for progressing timed MSR. It remains to show that all infinite traces using the l.t.s. are compliant, which reduces to checking that no critical configuration is reachable from the initial configuration 𝒮0subscript𝒮0\\mathcal{S}_{0} by a trace that uses the l.t.s. This property can be decided in PSPACE by relying on the fact that PSPACE, NPSPACE and co-PSPACE are all the same complexity class . Therefore, the S𝑆S problem is also in PSPACE. For a PTS 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} assume Σ,𝒮0,m,𝒞​𝒮,k,Dm​a​xΣsubscript𝒮0𝑚𝒞𝒮𝑘subscript𝐷𝑚𝑎𝑥\\Sigma,\\mathcal{S}_{0},m,\\mathcal{CS},k,D_{max}, ,𝒳,\\mathcal{X}, and ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} as described above. There is an algorithm that decides whether 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} satisfies the the S𝑆S property with respect to the l.t.s., 𝒞​𝒮𝒞𝒮\\mathcal{CS} and 𝒮0subscript𝒮0\\mathcal{S}_{0} which runs in space bounded by a polynomial in m,k𝑚𝑘m,k and l​o​g2​(Dm​a​x)𝑙𝑜subscript𝑔2subscript𝐷𝑚𝑎𝑥log_{2}(D_{max}).\n  We now investigate the complexity of the L𝐿L problem for PTSes, that is for the problem of deciding whether a given PTS satisfies the L𝐿L property.\nThis problem coincides with the V𝑉V problem for PTSes.\nRecall that a configuration 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} is a point-of-no-return \niff  there is no compliant infinite time trace\nfrom 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} that uses the l.t.s. For a PTS 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} assume Σ,𝒮0,m,𝒞​𝒮,k,Dm​a​xΣsubscript𝒮0𝑚𝒞𝒮𝑘subscript𝐷𝑚𝑎𝑥\\Sigma,\\mathcal{S}_{0},m,\\mathcal{CS},k,D_{max}, ,𝒳,\\mathcal{X}, and ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} as described above. There is an algorithm that, given an initial configuration 𝒮0subscript𝒮0\\mathcal{S}_{0}, decides whether 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} satisfies the L𝐿L property with respect to the l.t.s.,\n𝒞​𝒮𝒞𝒮\\mathcal{CS} and 𝒮0subscript𝒮0\\mathcal{S}_{0} and the algorithm runs in space bounded by a polynomial in m,k𝑚𝑘m,k and l​o​g2​(Dm​a​x)𝑙𝑜subscript𝑔2subscript𝐷𝑚𝑎𝑥log_{2}(D_{max}). We first propose an algorithm that, for a fixed system 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} and a fixed critical configuration specification 𝒞​𝒮𝒞𝒮\\mathcal{CS},\nchecks whether some δ𝛿\\delta-representation corresponds to a configuration that is a point-of-no-return w.r.t. 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} and 𝒞​𝒮𝒞𝒮\\mathcal{CS}. Following PSPACE-completeness of the Z𝑍Z problem  [ref]17, let R​E​A​L𝑅𝐸𝐴𝐿REAL denote the Z𝑍Z problem PSPACE algorithm over δ𝛿\\delta-representations.\n(For details, see the proof of [17, Theorem 1].) When given δ𝛿\\delta-representation 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W}, as input, the algorithm R​E​A​L​(𝒲)𝑅𝐸𝐴𝐿𝒲REAL(\\mathcal{W}) returns ACCEPT if and only if there is an infinite time trace of 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} that starts with 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W}, uses the l.t.s., and is compliant w.r.t. 𝒞​𝒮𝒞𝒮\\mathcal{CS},\nand it\nruns in polynomial space w.r.t. the given parameters, m,k𝑚𝑘m,k and l​o​g2​(Dm​a​x)𝑙𝑜subscript𝑔2subscript𝐷𝑚𝑎𝑥log_{2}(D_{max}).\nSince PSPACE and co-PSPACE are the same complexity class , we\nswitch the ACCEPT and FAIL and obtain a deterministic algorithm N​O​T​R​E​A​L𝑁𝑂𝑇𝑅𝐸𝐴𝐿NOTREAL that runs in polynomial space w.r.t. m,k𝑚𝑘m,k and l​o​g2​(Dm​a​x)𝑙𝑜subscript𝑔2subscript𝐷𝑚𝑎𝑥log_{2}(D_{max}). The algorithm N​O​T​R​E​A​L​(𝒲)𝑁𝑂𝑇𝑅𝐸𝐴𝐿𝒲NOTREAL(\\mathcal{W}) accepts if and only if\nthere is no compliant infinite time trace from 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W} that uses the l.t.s. Then, using N​O​T​R​E​A​L𝑁𝑂𝑇𝑅𝐸𝐴𝐿NOTREAL we construct the algorithm P​O​N𝑃𝑂𝑁PON that checks whether the given δ𝛿\\delta-representation 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W} corresponds to a point-of-no-return. Let P​O​N𝑃𝑂𝑁PON be the following algorithm, which takes a δ𝛿\\delta-representation 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W} as input: If  𝒳​(W)=1𝒳𝑊1\\mathcal{X}(W)=1, i.e., if  W𝑊W represents a critical configuration, then return FAIL, otherwise continue; If  N​O​T​R​E​A​L​(W)=1𝑁𝑂𝑇𝑅𝐸𝐴𝐿𝑊1NOTREAL(W)=1,\ni.e., if  W𝑊W represents a point-of-no-return,\nthen return ACCEPT, otherwise return FAIL. When given δ𝛿\\delta-representation 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W}, as input, the algorithm P​O​N​(𝒲)𝑃𝑂𝑁𝒲PON(\\mathcal{W}) accepts if and only if 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W} is a δ𝛿\\delta-representation of a point-of-no-return w.r.t. 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} and 𝒞​𝒮𝒞𝒮\\mathcal{CS}.\nSince 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} and N​O​T​R​E​A​L𝑁𝑂𝑇𝑅𝐸𝐴𝐿NOTREAL run in the polynomial space w.r.t. m,k𝑚𝑘m,k and l​o​g2​(Dm​a​x)𝑙𝑜subscript𝑔2subscript𝐷𝑚𝑎𝑥log_{2}(D_{max}),\nP​O​N𝑃𝑂𝑁PON is a deterministic algorithm that also runs in such a polynomial space. Next, we check that for any configuration 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} reachable from 𝒮0subscript𝒮0\\mathcal{S}_{0} using the l.t.s., there is a compliant infinite time trace from 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S}, i.e.,\nthat 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} is not a point-of-no-return.\nThe following algorithm accepts when no point-of-no-return is reachable from 𝒮0subscript𝒮0\\mathcal{S}_{0} in 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} on a compliant trace that uses the l.t.s., and fails otherwise.\nIt begins with i=0𝑖0i=0 and W0subscript𝑊0W_{0} set to be the δ𝛿\\delta-representation of 𝒮0subscript𝒮0\\mathcal{S}_{0}, and iterates the following sequence of operations: If  Wisubscript𝑊𝑖W_{i} represents a critical configuration, i.e., if 𝒳​(Wi)=1𝒳subscript𝑊𝑖1\\mathcal{X}(W_{i})=1, then return FAIL, otherwise continue; If  Wisubscript𝑊𝑖W_{i} represents a point-of-no-return, i.e., if P​O​N​(Wi)=1𝑃𝑂𝑁subscript𝑊𝑖1PON(W_{i})=1, then return FAIL, otherwise continue; If  i>LΣ​(m,k,Dm​a​x)𝑖subscript𝐿Σ𝑚𝑘subscript𝐷𝑚𝑎𝑥i>L_{\\Sigma}(m,k,D_{max}), then ACCEPT;\nelse continue; If ℒℒ\\mathcal{L}(Wi)=1subscript𝑊𝑖1(W_{i})=1, then replace Wisubscript𝑊𝑖W_{i} by Wi+1subscript𝑊𝑖1W_{i+1} obtained from Wisubscript𝑊𝑖W_{i} by applying the T​i​c​k𝑇𝑖𝑐𝑘Tick rule; Otherwise non-deterministically guess an instantaneous rule, r𝑟r, from 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} applicable to Wisubscript𝑊𝑖W_{i},\ni.e., such a rule r𝑟r that (r,Wi)=1𝑟subscript𝑊𝑖1(r,W_{i})=1. If so,\nreplace Wisubscript𝑊𝑖W_{i} with the δ𝛿\\delta-representation Wi+1subscript𝑊𝑖1W_{i+1}\nresulting from applying the rule r𝑟r to the δ𝛿\\delta-representation\nWisubscript𝑊𝑖W_{i}.\nOtherwise, continue; Set  i=i+1𝑖𝑖1i=i+1. Since P​O​N𝑃𝑂𝑁PON, ,𝒳,\\mathcal{X} and ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} run in Turing space bounded by a polynomial in m𝑚m, k𝑘k and log2⁡(Dm​a​x)subscript2subscript𝐷𝑚𝑎𝑥\\log_{2}(D_{max}),\nit follows that the above algorithm runs in deterministic polynomial space.\n∎ Let ΣΣ\\Sigma be a finite alphabet, 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} a PTS,\n𝒮0subscript𝒮0\\mathcal{S}_{0} an initial configuration, m𝑚m the number of facts in 𝒮0subscript𝒮0\\mathcal{S}_{0}, 𝒞​𝒮𝒞𝒮\\mathcal{CS} a critical configuration specification, k𝑘k an upper-bound on the size of facts, and Dm​a​xsubscript𝐷𝑚𝑎𝑥D_{max} an upper-bound on the numeric values in 𝒮0,𝒯subscript𝒮0𝒯\\mathcal{S}_{0},\\mathcal{T} and 𝒞​𝒮𝒞𝒮\\mathcal{CS}.\nLet the functions ,𝒳,\\mathcal{X}, and ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} run in Turing space bounded by a polynomial in m,k,log2⁡(Dm​a​x)𝑚𝑘subscript2subscript𝐷𝑚𝑎𝑥m,k,\\log_{2}(D_{max}) and return 1, respectively, when a rule in 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} is applicable to a given δ𝛿\\delta-representation, when a δ𝛿\\delta-representation is critical with respect to 𝒞​𝒮𝒞𝒮\\mathcal{CS}, and when a T​i​c​k𝑇𝑖𝑐𝑘Tick rule should be applied to the given δ𝛿\\delta-representation using the l.t.s. The L𝐿L problem for PTSes that use the l.t.s. is PSPACE-complete when assuming a bound on the size of facts. The result follows directly from Propositions 12\nand 15.\n∎ The PSPACE-completeness of the Z𝑍Z and S𝑆S problems\nobtained in \nfollows directly from Propositions  13\nand  14, and the lower bound proof from [17, Appendix C].\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: – An upper-bound on the numeric values of 𝒮0,𝒯subscript𝒮0𝒯\\mathcal{S}_{0},\\mathcal{T} and 𝒞​𝒮𝒞𝒮\\mathcal{CS}.
