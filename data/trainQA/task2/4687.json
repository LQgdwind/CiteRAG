      "content": "Paper Title: Concept Embedding Models: Beyond the Accuracy-Explainability Trade-Off\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor our evaluation, we propose three simple benchmark datasets of increasing concept complexity (from Boolean to vector-based concepts): (1) XOR (inspired by ) in which tuples (x1,x2)∈[ref]0 2subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2superscript012(x_{1},x_{2})\\in[ref]0 ^{2} are annotated with two Boolean concepts {𝟙ci>0.5}i=12superscriptsubscriptsubscript1subscript𝑐𝑖0.5𝑖12\\{\\mathbb{1}_{c_{i}>0.5}\\}_{i=1}^{2} and labeled as y=c1​ XOR ​c2𝑦subscript𝑐1 XOR subscript𝑐2y=c_{1}\\text{ XOR }c_{2}; (2) Trigonometric (inspired by 4) in which three latent normal random variables {bi}i=13superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑏𝑖𝑖13\\{b_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{3} are used to generate a 7-dimensional input whose three concept annotations are a Boolean function of {bi}i=13superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑏𝑖𝑖13\\{b_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{3} and task label is a linear function of the same; (3) Dot in which four latent random vectors 𝐯1,𝐯2,𝐰1,𝐰2∈ℝ2subscript𝐯1subscript𝐯2subscript𝐰1subscript𝐰2superscriptℝ2\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\mathbf{w}_{1},\\mathbf{w}_{2}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2} are used to generate two concept annotations, representing whether latent vectors 𝐯isubscript𝐯𝑖\\mathbf{v}_{i} point in the same direction of reference vectors 𝐰isubscript𝐰𝑖\\mathbf{w}_{i}, and task labels, representing whether the two latent vectors 𝐯1subscript𝐯1\\mathbf{v}_{1} and 𝐯2subscript𝐯2\\mathbf{v}_{2} point in the same direction. Furthermore, we evaluate our methods on two real-world image tasks: the Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset (CUB, 6), preprocessed as in , and the Large-scale CelebFaces Attributes dataset (CelebA, ). In our CUB task we have 112112112 complete concept annotations and 200200200 task labels while in our CelebA task we construct 666 balanced incomplete concept annotations and each image can be one of 256256256 classes. Therefore, we use CUB to test each model in a real-world task where concept annotations are numerous and they form a complete description of their downstream task. In contrast, our CelebA task is used to evaluate the behaviour of each method in scenarios where the concept annotations are scarce and incomplete w.r.t. their downstream task. Further details on these datasets and their properties are provided in Appendix A.3. We compare CEMs against Bool, Fuzzy, and Hybrid Joint-CBMs as they all provide concept-based explanations for their predictions and allow concept interventions at test-time. Note that this set excludes architectures such as Self-Explainable Neural Networks  and Concept Whitening 2 as they do not offer a clear mechanism for intervening on their concept bottlenecks. To ensure fair comparison, we use the same architecture capacity across all models\n. We empirically justify this decision in Appendix A.4 by showing that the results discussed in this section do not change if one modifies the underlying model architecture.\nSimilarly, we use the same values of α𝛼\\alpha and m𝑚m within a dataset for all models trained on that dataset and set pint=0.25subscript𝑝int0.25p_{\\text{int}}=0.25 when using CEM (see Appendix A.5 for an ablation study of pintsubscript𝑝intp_{\\text{int}} showing how intervention improvement plateaus around this value). When using Hybrid CBMs, we include as many activations in their bottlenecks as their CEM counterparts (so that they both end up with a bottleneck with k​m𝑘𝑚km activations) and use a Leaky-ReLU activation for unsupervised activations.\nFinally, in our evaluation we include a DNN without concept supervision with the same capacity as its CEM counterpart to measure the effect of concept supervision in our model’s performance.\nFor further details on the model architectures and training hyperparameters, please refer to Appendix A.6. We measure a model’s performance based on four metrics. First, we measure task and concept classification performance in terms of both task and mean concept accuracy. Second, we evaluate the interpretability of learnt concept representations via our concept alignment score. To easily visualise the accuracy-vs-interpretability trade-off, we plot our results in a two-dimensional plane showing both task accuracy and concept alignment. Third, we study the information bottleneck in our models via mutual information (MI) and the Information Plane technique . Finally, we quantify user trust 3 by evaluating a model’s task performance after concept interventions. All metrics in our evaluation, across all experiments, are computed on test sets using 555 random seeds, from which we compute a metric’s mean and 95%percent9595\\% confidence interval using the Box-Cox transformation for non-normal distributions.\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: For our evaluation, we propose three simple benchmark datasets of increasing concept complexity (from Boolean to vector-based concepts): (1) XOR (inspired by ) in which tuples (x1,x2)∈[ref]0 2subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2superscript012(x_{1},x_{2})\\in[ref]0 ^{2} are annotated with two Boolean concepts\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
