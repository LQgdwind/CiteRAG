      "content": "Paper Title: GD2-NeRF: Generative Detail Compensation via GAN and Diffusion for One-shot Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, with the rapid development of the 3D computer vision community, there exist different technologies that can solve the one-shot novel view synthesis (O-NVS) task, though under different settings, including OG-NeRF    0, Geometry-free Methods 1 2 3, 3D GAN 4 5 6, and Large-model-based Image-to-3D 7 8 [ref]6 . Our work is motivated from the OG-NeRF perspective yet not limited by it. Specifically, we target relieving the blurry issue of existing OG-NeRF methods while maintaining its nice property of inference-time finetuning-free. However, in contrast to previous OG-NeRF methods that mainly focus on improving the in-distribution details from the limited dataset, we make the early attempt to also include the out-distribution details from the powerful diffusion models [ref]2  that pre-trained on billions of high-quality images for getting vivid plausible outputs.\nIn the following paragraphs, we will distinguish between these technologies in detail, and we list comparisons with several representative methods in Tab. I. OG-NeRF.\nThe original NeRF technology 9 overfits the specific scene with tens or hundreds of posed input views and requires per-scene optimization. Targeting these issues, generalizable NeRF    is proposed which learns the general 3D prior across multiple scenes given very sparse reference images, which can naturally be applied to the O-NVS task. (i) Implicit condition. Early works   employ the implicit condition paradigm, which implicitly encode the scene information into the latent code based on the auto-decoder framework and requires tedious test-time optimization to find the latent code for new scenes. (ii) Explicit condition. Another line of works    construct the condition explicitly with the help of an encoder module which extracts condition features from the reference images, and can generalize to a new scene by a single feed-forward pass. However, they inevitably suffer the blurry issues, especially when the target view is far from the source view, since they rely highly on the condition features from the limited reference image. Targeting this issue, we propose GD2-NeRF, a coarse-to-fine framework to compensate for the details using generative models. At the coarse stage, we first inject the GAN model into the existing OG-NeRF pipeline to primarily relieve the blurry issue through learning in-distribution detail priors. Building on top of this, at the fine stage, we further exploit more vivid out-distribution priors from the pre-trained diffusion model [ref]2 . Recent work 0 also tries to relieve the blurry issue by adding a generative model. However, it co-trains a diffusion model with a conditional NeRF from scratch and needs tedious inference-time finetuning for each reference image. While our framework is finetuning-free and the pre-trained diffusion model [ref]2  on the large-scale high-resolution dataset is directly employed. Geometry-free Methods. Several works 2 3 also attempt to train a conditional model on posed images while without modeling the underlying geometry. For example, 3DiM 3 trains a pose-conditioned diffusion model on pairs of posed images, and inference in an auto-regression manner. However, though better at per-image quality (high FID), it fails to show smooth 3D consistency than the OG-NeRF methods due to the lack of geometry constraints. 3D GAN.\nIn recent years, with the success of GANs in 2D image synthesizing    and the impressive performance of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) 9, a bunch of works  4  6 include NeRF into GAN models as inductive bias for 3D-aware image synthesis. Typically, they can solve the O-NVS task via GAN inversion technology 6. However, there mainly exist the following drawbacks: (i) Per-scene optimization. It requires tedious optimization to find the corresponding latent code for each reference image. Though 5further includes the encoder model into the existing framework 4 to obtain a conditional 3D GAN model, the performance is still unsatisfactory since it is trained on a collection of unposed images, i.e., unsupervised. (ii) Specific category. Similar to the traditional GAN methods, they usually only work on a specific category like cat, car, etc. In contrast to these methods  4  6, our method does not require per-scene optimization given reference images and can generalize across different categories, even for real-world complex scenes. Large-model-based Image-to-3D.\nAs the recent advances on pre-trained large models   [ref]2 , a bunch of works 8 7 [ref]6  explore using them to solve the O-NVS task in a per-scene optimization manner for getting plausible 3D representations. (i) DINO&CLIP-based. Early attempts DietNeRF 8 and SinNeRF 7 use DINO  or CLIP  to constrain the distance between the rendered novel views and the reference view in the feature space. However, the feature space constraint struggles to provide fine-grained information, and  7 only works in nearby views. (ii) Diffusion-based. Recently, several works  0 [ref]6  attempt to lift the fine-grained 2D generative prior in pre-trained diffusion models [ref]2  to plausible 3D representations. For instance, Zero123 [ref]6 first finetunes the latent diffusion [ref]2 on a synthetic dataset 1 to inject the viewpoint condition (Zero123-NVS). Though Zero123-NVS can work in an inference-time finetuning-free manner, it achieves poor 3D consistency considering the undeterministic nature of diffusion models. Therefore, it further optimizes a 3D representation with the finetuned diffusion model using SJC 2 framework. Different from all the methods above  0 8 7 [ref]6 , our framework requires NO per-scene optimization, and the pre-trained diffusion model is also fixed with no further finetuning in our fine-stage method 3DE.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: can solve the one-shot novel view synthesis (O-NVS) task, though under different settings, including OG-NeRF    0, Geometry-free Methods 1 2 3, 3D GAN 4 5 6, and Large-model-based Image-to-3D 7 8 [ref]6 .
