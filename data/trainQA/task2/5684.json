      "content": "Paper Title: Probe: Learning Users‚Äô Personal Projection Bias in Inter-temporal Choices\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDataset Description.\nWe evaluate the performance of our proposed Probe model using the Steam dataset . The Steam dataset is a comprehensive dataset that provides information on users‚Äô purchase and interaction behaviors with both individual games and bundles. The dataset is organized into three main parts: individual games data, bundles data, and users‚Äô interactions data. The individual game data provides detailed information about each game, including the game title, description, genre, price, and user reviews. The bundle data contains information including the bundle title, games included in the bundle, price, and the discount rate. The users‚Äô interaction data includes users‚Äô purchases, playtime, reviews, and ratings of individual games or bundles. Note that our access to the dataset is limited to users‚Äô final purchases, and we do not have explicit information about the available options users had when they made decisions. In particular, when we observe users buying a bundle, we do not know which specific item they originally intended to purchase. Similarly, when users‚Äô purchase involves a single item, we are unaware of the available bundles that were presented to them at the time of their decisions. To address this limitation, we use the following method to generate the available options. When there is a purchase of a bundle ‚Ñ¨‚Ñ¨{\\mathcal{B}} in the dataset, we consider the game within the bundle that the user has played for the longest duration as the main item imsubscriptùëñùëöi_{m}. When there is a purchase of an individual item imsubscriptùëñùëöi_{m} in the dataset, we check bundles containing that specific item on the Steam platform. If there exists one bundle ‚Ñ¨‚Ñ¨{\\mathcal{B}} that includes item imsubscriptùëñùëöi_{m}, we treat that bundle as the available option for the user. In cases where multiple bundles contain item imsubscriptùëñùëöi_{m}, we select the one with the lowest price. However, if there are no bundles containing item imsubscriptùëñùëöi_{m}, we discard that particular purchasing record of the single item as it does not provide relevant information for our analysis. Following the above steps, we obtained a dataset with 197,438 records. Detailed statistical information is in Table¬†I. Evaluation Metrics. In this work, we adopt the classic binary classification metrics to evaluate the performance of Probe. Considering the sparsity of bundle purchases in the Steam dataset, where the number of bundle purchases (37,706) is approximately one-fifth of the number of individual game purchases (159,732), we define the positive class as bundle purchases and the negative class as individual game purchases. This allows us to account for the class imbalance in the dataset. We use the confusion matrix shown in Table¬†II to calculate the precision, recall and F1 score, where Precision measures the accuracy of the model‚Äôs positive predictions, and recall measures the model‚Äôs ability to identify positive instances correctly. F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure between the two metrics. We primarily focus on F1 score as a comprehensive metric for evaluating the performance of the Probe. Baseline Methods. In this work, we compare the performance of our proposed Probe with several baseline methods. Note that the linear bias model , which requires the true values of users‚Äô future preferences to be known, is not applicable in our setting. Therefore, we do not include the linear bias model in the baseline methods. Frequency-based method, where we assume that the probability of a user selecting the bundle in the testing set is the same as the frequency observed in the training set. Binary classification-based methods: Classic methods in this category include Naive Bayes Classifier 6, Support Vector Machines (SVM) 7, Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) 8, and AdaBoost 9. Among these classifiers, AdaBoost achieves the best performance, thus, we show the results of AdaBoost as an example. Learning-to-rank methods including RankSVM  and RankNet . Bundle recommendation methods including BPR method , BGCN [ref]14, and CrossCBR . Detailed implementation of these methods can be found in the appendix.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: the best performance, thus, we show the results of AdaBoost as an example.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
