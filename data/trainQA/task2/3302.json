      "content": "Paper Title: Topic Modeling on Podcast Short-Text Metadata\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTopic modeling on short text faces the challenge of severe data sparsity due to the nature of this type of input .\nShort text, as it consists of only few\nwords, can be ambiguous and noisy and, in general, has limited context.\nThis means that pairs of words that are topic-related do not or rarely co-occur in the same contexts, leading to conventional topic modeling techniques such as LDA  to perform poorly.\nVarious topic modeling techniques have been designed to address this issue.\nModels can be classified in four groups: pseudo-documents-based  , probabilistic , neural  [ref]33, and NMF-based  .\nWe further review each group and some representative models. The principle of pseudo-documents is to aggregate connected short texts in longer documents, which are further used as input to conventional topic modeling .\nInitial aggregation methods leveraged metadata such as hashtags in tweets [ref]16.\nHowever, this proved limiting for other types of short texts (e.g. search queries) and led to self-aggregation methods, able to aggregate using topic cues based on the corpus only  .\nAn issue identified with this type of methods is overfitting .\nAlso, they appear overall less competitive than the other groups of topic modeling techniques for short text  , discussed further. The second group entailing probabilistic models is the most related to conventional topic modeling (LDA) that represents documents and topics as multinomial distributions over topics, respectively words.\nThe adaptation of these models to short text is to assume that each document is sampled only from a single topic, thus restricting document-topic distribution to a mixture of unigrams   .\nGPU-DMM , an effective and fast model in this group, is based on Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture (DMM) model and uses a Generalized Pólya Urna (GPU) as a sampling process to promote topic-related words.\nThe word association is estimated by exploiting pre-trained word embedding .\nThis allows to alleviate data sparsity as it extends the context to words that are semantically related but they do not necessarily co-occur in the same text. The third group has become popular in the last years with the rise of deep learning.\nNeural topic modeling is based on Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE)    [ref]33.\nTypically, an encoder such as a MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) compresses the Bag-of-Words (BoW) document representation into a continuous vector.\nThen, a decoder reconstructs the document by generating words independently  .\nNegative sampling and Quantization Topic Model (NQTM) [ref]33, the latest topic modeling technique on short texts brings two contributions which yielded the current SOTA results.\nThe first is a new quantification method applied to the encoder’s output whose goal is to generate peakier distributions for decoding.\nThe second is to replace the standard decoder with a negative sampling algorithm that proves better at discovering non-repetitive topics. The NMF-based group learns topics by decomposing the term-document (BoW) matrix representation of the corpus into two low-rank matrices, one corresponding to document representations over topics and the other to topic representations over words .\nGiven the limited contextual information, the Semantics-assisted Non-negative Matrix Factorization (SeaNMF) model  adjusts NMF to short texts by integrating into it word-context semantic correlations learnt from the skip-gram view of the input corpus.\nIn contrast to SeaNMF which focuses on the learning part, CluWords  enhances the corpus representation before being factorized with standard NMF.\nThe matrix is obtained with a proposed custom TF-IDF strategy that exploits pre-trained word embeddings. The existing works include in their benchmark, datasets consisting of question or news titles, web snippets, review comments, or tweets     [ref]33.\nPodcast metadata compared to these datasets exhibits a much higher frequency of NEs, which we exploit with the goal to further address data sparsity.\nTo our knowledge, we are the first to assess existing models on podcast metadata and to explicitly consider NE-related cues in short-text topic modeling.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: such as LDA  to perform poorly.\nVarious topic modeling techniques have been designed to address this issue.\nModels can be classified in four groups: pseudo-documents-based  , probabilistic , neural  [ref]33, and NMF-based  .\nWe further review each group and some representative models.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
