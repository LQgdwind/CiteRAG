This is one of the most successful implementations of Self-Attention. Although, the transformer introduces a scaled-dot product mechanism paired with multi-headed self-attention. The architecture proposed in [ref]5 is: The major modules of the transformer model that make up the architecture include the encoder and decoder multi-head attention, feed forward respectively. The inputs initially are the word embeddings of the words being processed by the model and the inputs to the subsequent layers are the outputs of the preceding layers. The pictorial representation of scaled dot-product and multi-head attention is as follows: One head of the attention module includes self attention with a scaling add-on; the Key-Query-Value structure stays. The Query and Key dot product is scaled by a value dksubscriptùëëùëò\\sqrt{d_{k}} where dùëëd is the dimension of the input and is merely a scaling parameter to avoid explosion of values after the dot-product. The dot-product is then softmax-ed and operated with the value vector. This is essentially the math for calculation of the vector aisubscriptùëéùëñ{a_{i}} from equation (2) in the self-attention fashion. However, in transformer multiple aisubscriptùëéùëñ{a_{i}}s are calculated with different weights. This gives a notion of extracting multiple feature maps as in Convolutional Neural Networks. These vectors are then concatenated and then fed to a feed forward neural network layer. Similarly at the decoder the expected output is fed to the decoder layer and then combined at the ‚Äômulti-head-encoder-decoder-attention‚Äô layer with the encoder outputs. The transformer was trained on WMT‚Äô14 English-German dataset, 4.5 million sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ref]20, which has a vocabulary of about 37000 tokens at source and targets. For English-French, WMT‚Äô14 English-French dataset with of 36M sentences was used. 32000 word-piece vocabulary was used . The transformers yielded state of the art results with the big transformer model scoring 28.4 BLEU on English-German dataset and 41 BLEU on English-French dataset. The transformer model aims not only at achieving state of the art results but also to do that with minimal computational complexity. To measure performance, [ref]5 has calculated FLOPs (Floating Point Operations Per Second) which is 10-100 times better than the state of the art models.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: [ref]5 proposes the well known transformer model.
