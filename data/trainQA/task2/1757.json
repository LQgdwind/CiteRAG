For traditional techniques, we direct refers to a comprehensive survey by Nazar et al.  [ref]26. Since the first neural model of code summarization was proposed by Iyer et al. , we have witnessed the introduction of the latest neural technologies for text generation tasks (e.g., machine translation and text summarization) into this research field recently. For example, Wei et al. [ref]12 and Ye et al.  [ref]11 introduced the code generation task to improve code summarization task via dual learning  . Hu et al.   proposed an API sequence encoder to assist code summarization by transferring learning of API knowledge. Yao et al.   adopted Tree-RNN and reinforcement learning to enhance BLEU score of code summaries. Chen et al.   designed a neural framework for code summarization and code retrieval based on Variational Auto Encoders (VAEs).\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: and rapidly-growing research topic in the community of software engineering and natural language processing.
