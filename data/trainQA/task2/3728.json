      "content": "Paper Title: Factored Adaptation for Non-stationary Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLearning a stable policy under non-stationary environments is a long-standing challenge in Reinforcement learning (RL)¬†  [ref]3.\nWhile most RL approaches assume stationarity, in many real-world applications of RL there can be changes in the dynamics or the reward function, both across different episodes and within each episode.\nRecently, several works adapted Meta-RL methods to learn sequences of non-stationary tasks [ref]4 [ref]5. However, the continuous MAML  adaptation for non-stationary RL [ref]4 does not explicitly model temporal changing components, while TRIO¬†[ref]5 needs to meta-train the model on a set of non-stationary tasks. LILAC¬† and ZeUS  leverage latent variable models to directly model the change factors in the environment in a shared embedding space.\nIn particular, they consider families of MDPs indexed by a single latent parameter. In this paper, we argue that disentangling the changes as separate latent parameters and modeling the process with a factored representation improves the efficiency of adapting to non-stationarity. In particular, we leverage insights from the causality literature  0 that model non-stationarity in terms of individual latent change factors and causal graphs across different environments.\nWe propose Factored Adaptation for Non-Stationary RL (FANS-RL), a factored adaptation framework that jointly learns the causal structure of the MDP and a factored representation of the individual change factors, allowing for changes at discrete timepoints and continuously varying environments.\nWhile we provide a specific architecture (FN-VAE), the theoretical framework of FANS-RL can be implemented with different architectures and combined with various RL algorithms.\nWe formalize our setting as a Factored Non-stationary MDP (FN-MDP), which combines a Factored-MDP ¬†1 2 3 with latent change factors that evolve in time following a Markov process. We build upon the AdaRL framework 4, a recently proposed fast adaptation approach. AdaRL learns a factored representation that explicitly models changes (i.e., domain-specific components) in observation, dynamics and reward functions across a set of source domains. An optimal policy learnt on the source domains can then be adapted to a new target domain simply by identifying a low-dimensional change factor, without any additional finetuning.\nFANS-RL extends AdaRL from the stationary case with constant change factors to a general non-stationary framework.\nSpecifically, FANS-RL learns the low-dimensional and time-evolving representations ùúΩtssuperscriptsubscriptùúΩùë°ùë†\\bm{\\theta}_{t}^{s} and ùúΩtrsubscriptsuperscriptùúΩùëüùë°\\bm{\\theta}^{r}_{t} that fully capture the non-stationarity of dynamics and rewards, allowing for continuous and discrete changing functions, both within-episode and across-episode.\nOur main contributions can be summarized as: We formalize FN-MDPs, a unified factored framework that can handle many non-stationary settings, including discrete and continuous changes, both within and across episodes. We prove that, under standard assumptions, the causal graph of the transition and reward function is identifiable, while we can recover a partial structure for the change factors. We introduce Factored Adaptation for Non-Stationary RL (FANS-RL), a general non-stationary RL approach that interleaves model estimation of an FN-MDP and policy optimization. We also describe FN-VAE, an example architecture for learning FN-MDPs. We evaluate FANS-RL on simulated benchmarks for continuous control and robotic manipulation tasks and show it outperforms the state of the art on the return, compactness of the latent space representation and robustness to varying degrees of non-stationarity.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Learning a stable policy under non-stationary environments is a long-standing challenge in Reinforcement learning (RL)¬†  [ref]3.\nWhile most RL approaches assume stationarity, in many real-world applications of RL there can be changes in the dynamics or the reward function, both across different episodes and within each\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
