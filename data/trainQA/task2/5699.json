      "content": "Paper Title: Twin Contrastive Learning with Noisy Labels\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep neural networks have shown exciting performance for classification tasks 3. Their success largely results from the large-scale curated datasets with clean human annotations, such as CIFAR-10  and ImageNet , in which the annotation process, however, is tedious and cumbersome. In contrast, one can easily obtain datasets with some noisy annotations—from online shopping websites , crowdsourcing  , or Wikipedia —for training a classification neural network. Unfortunately, the mislabelled data are prone to significantly degrade the performance of deep neural networks. Therefore, there is considerable interest in training noise-robust classification networks in recent years    [ref]21 [ref]29 . To mitigate the influence of noisy labels, most of the methods in literature propose the robust loss functions  , reduce the weights of noisy labels  , or correct the noisy labels   [ref]29.\nIn particular, label correction methods have shown great potential for better performance on the dataset with a high noise ratio. Typically, they correct the labels by using the combination of noisy labels and model predictions , which usually require an essential iterative sample selection process   [ref]29 [ref]21.\nFor example, Arazo et al.  uses the small-loss trick to carry out sample selection and correct labels via the weighted combination.\nIn recent years, contrastive learning has shown promising results in handling noisy labels [ref]29 [ref]21 [ref]21. They usually leverage contrastive learning to learn discriminative representations, and then clean the labels [ref]29 [ref]21 or construct the positive pairs by introducing the information of nearest neighbors in the embedding space. However, using the nearest neighbors only considers the label noise within a small neighborhood, which is sub-optimal and cannot handle extreme label noise scenarios, as the neighboring examples may also be mislabeled at the same time. To address this issue, this paper presents TCL, a novel twin contrastive learning model that explores the label-free unsupervised representations and label-noisy annotations for learning from noisy labels.\nSpecifically, we leverage contrastive learning to learn discriminative image representations in an unsupervised manner and construct a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) over its representations. Unlike unsupervised GMM, TCL links the label-free GMM and label-noisy annotations by replacing the latent variable of GMM with the model predictions for updating the parameters of GMM.\nThen, benefitting from the learned data distribution, we propose to formulate label noise detection as an out-of-distribution (OOD) problem, utilizing another two-component GMM to model the samples with clean and wrong labels. The merit of the proposed OOD label noise detection is to take the full data distribution into account, which is robust to the neighborhood with strong label noise.\nFurthermore, we propose a bootstrap cross-supervision with an entropy regulation loss to reduce the impact of wrong labels, in which the true labels of the samples with wrong labels are estimated from another data augmentation.\nLast, to further learn robust representations, we leverage contrastive learning and Mixup techniques to inject the structural knowledge of classes into the embedding space, which helps align the representations with estimated labels. The contributions are summarized as follows: We present TCL, a novel twin contrastive learning model that explores the label-free GMM for unsupervised representations and label-noisy annotations for learning from noisy labels. We propose a novel OOD label noise detection method by modeling the data distribution, which excels at handling extremely noisy scenarios. We propose an effective cross-supervision, which can bootstrap the true targets with an entropy loss to regularize the model. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin. In particular, we achieve 7.5% improvements in extremely noisy scenarios.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: data are prone to significantly degrade the performance of deep neural networks.
