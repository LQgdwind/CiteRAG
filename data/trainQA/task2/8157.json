      "content": "Paper Title: WISDOM: An AI-powered framework for emerging research detection using weak signal analysis and advanced topic modeling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this work, we presented WISDOM, an automated framework empowered by artificial intelligence, devised to detect emerging research themes through the integration of multiple techniques such as advanced topic modeling and weak signal analysis. As a case study, we evaluate WISDOM‚Äôs efficacy in identifying emerging research themes and trends in underwater sensing technologies using scientific literature spanning from 2004 to 2021. Eighteen research topics were identified as weak signals in at least one of the three periods, namely P1subscriptùëÉ1P_{1}, P2subscriptùëÉ2P_{2}, and P3subscriptùëÉ3P_{3}. As depicted in Figure 6, among the eighteen weak signal topics, only Topics4 (underwater fish tracking), 33 (CoAP congestion control scheme for UWSNs), and 42 (SDRT) emerged in P3subscriptùëÉ3P_{3}, with all of them anticipated to sustain growth in the following years. In recent years, underwater fish tracking has captured the interest of researchers due to its potential to revolutionize our understanding of aquatic ecosystems and fisheries management . Advanced sensing technologies, such as acoustic telemetry and satellite tagging , and digital technologies, such as deep learning and computer vision , have enabled researchers to track fish movements in real-time over large spatial scales, providing valuable insights into migration patterns, habitat utilization, and population dynamics. Congestion management in wireless sensor networks (Topic33) is also a challenging and important problem that recently garnered significant attention from researchers . Advanced sensing technologies and the proliferation of interconnected underwater devices have heightened the need for efficient congestion control mechanisms to ensure reliable and timely data transmission in underwater environments. This scheme offers promising solutions by leveraging the lightweight and energy-efficient characteristics of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) , tailored specifically for the unique constraints and conditions of UWSNs, thereby improving network performance and facilitating a wide range of underwater applications, from the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT)  to the Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) . Reliable data transmission in underwater environments is crucial. With the advent of advanced sensing technologies and the increasing deployment of underwater sensor networks, there is a growing demand for robust communication protocols capable of ensuring data integrity and reliability despite harsh underwater conditions. Segmented Data Reliable Transfer (SDRT, Topic42)  offers a promising solution by employing segmented data transmission techniques tailored to the unique characteristics of underwater communication, thereby enhancing the efficiency and reliability of data transfer in underwater research applications. As depicted in Figure 5, five topics‚ÄîTopics1, 5, 52, 55, and 60‚Äîemerged as strong signals, with all appearing in the P1subscriptùëÉ1P_{1} period except for Topic5, which emerged in P2subscriptùëÉ2P_{2}. From Figure 7, only Topics1 (arctic ocean, ice, oil) and 60 (CTDA, localization of USNs) experienced an overall increasing trend, with the growing trend expected to continue for Topic60. The Arctic Ocean has been an intriguing research topic for researchers in underwater sensing technologies due to several factors such as environmental concerns , resource exploration , geopolitical significance , and technological challenges. Scientists have aimed to address several critical research challenges such as ice monitoring and prediction, oil spill detection and mapping , and underwater mapping and exploration using advanced sonar systems and AUVs , and contribute to the sustainable management of Arctic resources and ecosystems through innovative underwater sensing technologies. Precise localization and tracking of USNs (Topic60) could also enhance environmental monitoring, resource exploration, and maritime security. Recent research in this area focuses on developing advanced acoustic and electromagnetic localization techniques , improving underwater communication systems , and integrating AUVs for efficient data collection and network maintenance . The BERTopic model [ref]8 provides time-specific keyword sets for each extracted topic (see Tables 1 and 2) that enable experts to gain insights into the evolving nature of topics over time. By analyzing the keywords associated with each topic at different time intervals, we can track changes in the focus or emphasis of discussions within a particular topic area. This can help identify emerging trends, shifting research interests, or evolving terminology within a field. As an example, Topic1 (refer to Table 2) represents a tightly focused research area, whereas Topic4 exemplifies a transition in data sources (Table 1), and Topic2 illustrates shifts in technology (refer to Table 1). Comparing keyword sets across different time periods can reveal patterns or correlations between topics, providing a deeper understanding of the dynamic nature of research discourse and facilitating more informed decision-making in various domains. Additionally, the temporal evolution curves (see Figures 6 and 7), characterized by peaks and lows with intervals between consecutive peaks, offer valuable insights into the dynamics of topic popularity or relevance over time. By examining these patterns, experts can discern trends, identify periods of heightened interest or activity, and uncover shifts in research focus and the time needed for a shift within a given topic area. While manual identification of emerging research topics can provide valuable insights, it is often limited by its time-consuming nature, subjectivity, and potential inefficiencies in handling large volumes of data. In addition, manual identification may lack consistency and standardization across different domain experts, leading to variations in the identification process and potentially impacting the reliability of the results. Automated approaches, such as using machine learning and natural language processing techniques, can help mitigate these disadvantages by providing more scalable, objective, and efficient methods for identifying emerging technologies. WISDOM offers strategic planners and domain experts a streamlined approach to identifying and monitoring emerging research topics by rapidly processing extensive datasets, unveiling latent cross-disciplinary patterns, and delivering impartial insights, thereby enhancing the efficacy and objectivity of trend detection. Lastly, while showcased in this paper within the domain of underwater sensing technologies, WISDOM is applicable to other domains as well.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: acoustic and electromagnetic localization techniques , improving underwater communication systems , and integrating AUVs for efficient data collection and network maintenance .
