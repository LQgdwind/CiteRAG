      "content": "Paper Title: Advancing Spatio-Temporal Processing in Spiking Neural Networks through Adaptation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the previous sections, we discussed the theoretical advantages of SE discretization over the more commonly used Euler-Forward discretization of the adLIF neuron model. From these theoretical considerations however, it is not directly evident whether this method provides any advantages in a realistic task setup. We therefore evaluated how recurrent networks of adLIF neurons compete against classical vanilla LIF networks as well as networks of adaptive neurons that have previously been considered in the literature: a model with threshold adaptation (ALIF) , a constrained variant of the adLIF neuron model, similar to the model in this study, but with differences in discretization and neuron formulation (cAdLIF) [ref]9, another adLIF network but with batch normalization (RadLIF) , a feed-forward model with delays implemented as temporal convolutions (DCLS-Delays) , and the balanced resonate-and-fire neuron model (BHRF) , a variant of the resonate-and-fire neuron  where output spikes do not disrupt the phase of the membrane potential oscillation. To that end, we constructed a recurrently connected SNN composed of one or two layers (depending on the task) of adLIF neurons, followed by a layer of leaky integrator (LI) neurons to provide a real-valued network output. We trained the SNN using BPTT with surrogate gradients 7  4 . We used a dropout rate of 15%percent1515\\% except noted otherwise, but otherwise no regularization, normalization, or data augmentation methods. The trained parameters included the synaptic weights Œ∏ùúÉ\\theta, as well as all neuron parameters aùëéa, bùëèb, œÑusubscriptùúèùë¢\\tau_{u} and œÑwsubscriptùúèùë§\\tau_{w}, which were not shared across neurons such that each neuron could have individual parameter values. Neurons were initialized heterogeneously, such that for each neuron the initial values of these parameters were chosen randomly from a uniform distribution over a pre-defined range. Heterogeneity has previously been shown to improve the performance of SNNs 7. We applied a reparametrization technique for the training of time constants œÑusubscriptùúèùë¢\\tau_{u} and œÑwsubscriptùúèùë§\\tau_{w} and parameters aùëéa and bùëèb, see Methods¬†for details. We evaluated the networks on two commonly used audio benchmark datasets: Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD)  and Spiking Speech Commands (SSC) \n, as well as an ECG dataset previously used to test ALIF neurons . In Table 1 we report the test accuracy on the corresponding test sets. SHD does not define a dedicated validation set and previous work reported performances for networks validated on the test set, which is methodologically not clean. We therefore report results for two validation variants for SHD: with validation on the test set (to ensure comparability) and with validation on a fraction of the training set. Our results show that recurrent adLIF networks clearly outperformed LIF network baselines on all tasks.\nFor all considered datasets, recurrent SE-discretized adLIF networks performed better than previously considered recurrent SNNs. For SSC, their performance was slightly below that of the DCLS-model , a feed-forward network using extensive delays trained via dilated convolutions.\nNetworks composed of SE-discretized adLIF neurons (SE-adLIF networks) performed significantly better than those based on Euler-forward discretization (EF-adLIF networks) on SHD and SSC (significance values for a two-tailed t-test were p<0.000001ùëù0.000001p<0.000001 for SHD and p<0.005ùëù0.005p<0.005 for SSC). Small networks with a single recurrent layer on ECG performed on-par (p=0.115ùëù0.115p=0.115), while SE-adLIF networks significantly improved over EF-adLIF networks when larger networks with two recurrent layers were used (p<0.02ùëù0.02p<0.02).\nWe found that EF-adLIF networks suffered from severe instabilities if neuron parameters were not constrained to values in which the decay rate exceeds the critical boundary of r=1ùëü1r=1, resulting in instabilities for example in the ECG task, see Section A in Appendix. The SE method is hence the preferred choice when adLIF neurons are used in a discretized form. AdLIF neurons could, depending on their parameters, exhibit many different experimentally observed neuronal dynamics . We wondered whether networks trained on spatio-temporal classification tasks utilized the diverse dynamical behaviors of adLIF neurons. To that end, we investigated the resulting parameterizations of adLIF neurons in networks trained on SHD, and indeed found a heterogeneous landscape of neuron parameterizations, see Section B in the Appendix.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: a model with threshold adaptation (ALIF) , a constrained variant of the adLIF neuron model, similar to the model in this study, but with differences in discretization and neuron formulation (cAdLIF) [ref]9, another adLIF network but with batch normalization (RadLIF) , a feed-forward model with delays implemented as temporal convolutions (DCLS-Delays) , and the balanced resonate-and-fire neuron\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
