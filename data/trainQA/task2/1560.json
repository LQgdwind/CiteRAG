Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11.

Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: GTAE: Graph-Transformer based Auto-Encoders for Linguistic-Constrained Text Style Transfer\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis section shows the experiment results in the perspective of evaluation metrics. Specifically, in Table II, WMD is the masked Word Mover’s distance with style-related tokens removed, which serves as the major metric for content preservation evaluation. B-P, B-R and B-F1 denote the precision, recall and F1 score of the BERTSCORE, which are rescaled as suggested in [] for better illustration. We also report the BLEU scores between the original and transfer sentences. A smaller WMD means the transfer sentence is closer to the original one, while higher BLEU and BERTSCORE metrics indicate better content preservation ability. N-A, N-C and N-D are the adversarial naturalness scores calculating from the three released classifiers trained on ARAE, CAAE and DAR respectively, where a higher score means a higher probability to be \"natural\" [ref]40. ACCU and EMD denote empirical transfer accuracy and Earth Mover’s Distance based on a pretrained CNN classifier. Higher ACCU and EMD scores indicate a stronger transfer intensity. For the yelp dataset, we evaluated the results released in  for DualRl , UnsuperMT , UnpairedRL , and DAR-related methods , the results released in [ref]26 for IMaT [ref]26, CAAE , Multi_Decoder [ref]12, and Style_Emb [ref]12, and the results of StyleTrans  and FineGrained  methods that are released on their own websites. Note that for the FineGrained results, the authors only released a subset that containing 500 rather than 1000 sentences. We also trained ARAE  under its default setting on the yelp dataset. For the political and title datasets, we trained CAAE, ARAE and DAR-related methods using their released source codes under the default settings as well.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: N-D are the adversarial naturalness scores calculating from the three released classifiers trained on ARAE, CAAE and DAR respectively, where a higher score means a higher probability to be \"natural\" [ref]40.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
