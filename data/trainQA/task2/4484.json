      "content": "Paper Title: Joint covariate-alignment and concept-alignment: a framework for domain generalization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDomain generalization (DG) has been studied extensively over the past decade as an important practical problem arising in a number of areas such as computer vision, signal processing, and medical imaging [ref]1 . Like standard learning settings, DG aims to learn a model from several seen domains (training data) that can generalize well on an unseen domain (test data). However, in contrast to the standard setting where the test data is assumed to come from the same distribution as training data, in DG, the distribution of the test data is different, i.e., there is a presence of what is referred to as a distribution shift. This phenomena can be observed in many practical settings . A number of approaches for DG are based on the assumption that there exist domain-invariant features that are transferable and unchanged from domain to domain. Thus, a classifier designed on top of these features will likely generalize well to the unseen domain. In practice, DG methods based on this assumption consist of two steps: (a) learning a good representation function that outputs the domain-invariant features, and (b) designing a classifier based on these domain-invariant features. Different definitions of domain-invariant features have been proposed and they lead to different feature selection schemes. In [ref]4       , a feature is defined as domain-invariant if its marginal distribution is unchanged over domains. On the other hand, in [ref]12        a feature is considered as domain-invariant if its conditional distribution of the label given the representation feature is unchanged from domain to domain. The differences in the definitions are rooted in the different modeling assumptions regarding the domains. Particularly, in the covariate-shift setting 0, the marginal distribution of data varies across the domains. On the other hand, in the setting of concept-shift 0, the conditional distribution of the label (class) conditioned on the data varies from domain to domain222The setting where the conditional distribution of data conditioned on the label (class) changes from domain to domain is also referred to as concept-shift. However, we do not consider that scenario in this paper..\nWe survey related work in this context in Sec. 2. In this paper, we revisit the seminal upper bound for the prediction risk in the unseen domain derived in 1 and show the necessity of jointly designing a representation function that minimizes both the covariate-shift and the concept-shift risks.\nWe make the following contributions: We derive a novel upper bound for the prediction risk in the unseen domain that consists of two terms, namely, a covariate-alignment term and a concept-alignment term. This theoretical result motivates a domain generalization algorithm that combines both covariate-alignment and concept-alignment algorithms. We propose two new algorithms MMD-CEM and CORAL-CEM that combine, respectively, the CORrelation ALignment algorithm (CORAL) 2 and the Maximum Mean Discrepancy algorithm (MMD) [ref]4 with the Conditional Entropy Invariant Risk Minimization  algorithm (CEM) 3. We compare the proposed algorithms (MMD-CEM, CORAL-CEM) with six competing DG methods. Our methods exhibit similar or better performance compared to the six alternatives on both CS-CMNIST 4 and CMNIST [ref]12 datasets. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Sec. 2, we summarize the recent work on DG dealing with covariate-shift and concept-shift. Sec. 3 formally defines the problem and clarifies notation used. Sec. 4 provides the main theoretical results which motivate the practical algorithms of Sec. 5. Finally, we provide the numerical results in Sec. 6 and conclude in Sec. 7.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: generalization (DG) has been studied extensively over the past decade as an important practical problem arising in a number of areas such as computer vision, signal processing, and medical imaging [ref]1 .
