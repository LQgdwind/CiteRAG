      "content": "Paper Title: Reachability-Aware Laplacian Representation in Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe Laplacian Representation (LapRep)  is a task-agnostic state representation in RL, originally proposed in  (known as proto-value function).\nFormally, the Laplacian representations for all states are the eigenfunctions of Laplace-Beltrami diffusion operator on the state space manifold.\nFor simplicity, here we restrict the introduction of LapRep to the discrete state case and refer readers to  for the formulation in the continuous case. The states and transitions in an MDP can be viewed as nodes and edges in a graph.\nThe LapRep is formed by d𝑑d smallest eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian (usually d≪|𝒮|much-less-than𝑑𝒮d\\ll\\lvert\\mathcal{S}\\rvert). Each eigenvector (of length |𝒮|𝒮\\lvert\\mathcal{S}\\rvert) corresponds to a dimension of the LapRep. Formally, we denote the graph as 𝒢=(𝒮,ℰ)𝒢𝒮ℰ\\mathcal{G}=(\\mathcal{S},\\mathcal{E}) where 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} is the node set consisting of all states and ℰℰ\\mathcal{E} is the edge set consisting of transitions between states.\nThe Laplacian matrix of graph 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is defined as L≔D−A≔𝐿𝐷𝐴L\\coloneqq D-A, where A𝐴A is the adjacency matrix of 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} and D≔diag​(A​𝟏)≔𝐷diag𝐴1D\\coloneqq\\mathrm{diag}(A\\mathbf{1}) is the degree matrix [ref]7.\nWe sort the eigenvalues of L𝐿L by their magnitudes and denote the i𝑖i-th smallest one as λisubscript𝜆𝑖\\lambda_{i}. The unit eigenvector corresponding to λisubscript𝜆𝑖\\lambda_{i} is denoted as 𝐯i∈ℝ|𝒮|subscript𝐯𝑖superscriptℝ𝒮\\mathbf{v}_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{\\lvert\\mathcal{S}\\rvert}.\nThen, the d𝑑d-dimensional LapRep of a state s𝑠s can be defined as where 𝐯i​[s]subscript𝐯𝑖delimited-[]𝑠\\mathbf{v}_{i}[s] denotes the entry in vector 𝐯isubscript𝐯𝑖\\mathbf{v}_{i} corresponding to state s𝑠s.\nIn particular, 𝐯1subscript𝐯1\\mathbf{v}_{1} is a normalized all-ones vector and hence it provides no information about the environment geometry. Therefore we omit 𝐯1subscript𝐯1\\mathbf{v}_{1} and only consider other dimensions. For environments with a large or even continuous state space, it is infeasible to obtain the LapRep by directly computing the eigendecomposition.\nTo approximate LapRep with neural networks, previous works  [ref]30 propose sample-based methods based on the spectral graph drawing [ref]14.\nIn particular, Wang et al. [ref]30 introduce a generalized graph drawing objective that ensures dimension-wise faithful approximation to the ground truth 𝝆d​(s)subscript𝝆𝑑𝑠\\boldsymbol{\\rho}_{d}(s).\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: of graph 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} is defined as L≔D−A≔𝐿𝐷𝐴L\\coloneqq D-A, where A𝐴A is the adjacency matrix of 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} and D≔diag​(A​𝟏)≔𝐷diag𝐴1D\\coloneqq\\mathrm{diag}(A\\mathbf{1}) is the degree matrix [ref]7.\nWe sort the eigenvalues of L𝐿L by their magnitudes and denote the i𝑖i-th smallest one as λisubscript𝜆𝑖\\lambda_{i}.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
