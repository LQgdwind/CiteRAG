      "content": "Paper Title: Physically Realizable Natural-Looking Clothing Textures Evade Person Detectors via 3D Modeling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep Neural Networks(DNNs) have been widely used in many real-world systems such as face recognition and object detection    . However, it is well known that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples  . Adversarial examples can be crafted by adding small perturbations to the clean inputs, rendering the DNNs’ outputs incorrect. Such vulnerabilities could result in severe safety problems when deploying DNN-based systems. This has become a hot research topic recently      . Adversarial examples were first identified in the digital world. However, adversarial examples also exist in the physical world, posing more risks in real-world scenarios. Recently, many works     2    [ref]40  3 have designed physical adversarial examples to deceive DNNs in the real world. Among them, hiding persons    8 9 from DNN-based object detectors is especially challenging due to the difficulties of modeling non-rigid object surfaces (i.e., clothes). Most works     8 print adversarial patches on the front side of clothes to hide people from being detected. We call them patch-based adversarial examples. These patches are usually conspicuous to humans, making the clothes look strange and easily noticeable by human observers. Efforts have been put on making the adversarial patches more natural-looking 8 2 . However, these patch-based adversarial clothes can only attack object detectors at a narrow range of viewing angles (i.e., when the camera faces the front of the person). To attack the detector at a wider range of viewing angles, one may print the adversarial patches everywhere on the clothes, which would make the clothes unnatural-looking again. For example, a dog-head-like patch on the front of a T-shirt is natural, but putting this patch everywhere on the T-shirt would make the T-shirt look weird. Another way to craft physical adversarial examples is to design the textures on the surface of the target objects  9  [ref]40 3, i.e., crafting texture-base adversarial examples. Unlike patch-based adversarial examples, texture-based ones are usually adversarially effective at multiple viewing angles. They are mostly optimized via 3D modeling or using clone networks, and printed on the surface of rigid objects such as turtles and cars [ref]40 3.\nHowever, it is much harder to realize the 3D textures of non-rigid objects like humans and clothes in the physical world while maintaining their adversarial effectiveness, since there is a huge gap between a 3D human model and a real-world person.\nTo circumvent this difficulty, Hu et al. 9 propose to craft texture-based adversarial clothes by extending patches into textures with repetitive patterns, which does not require 3D modeling. However, their textures are very conspicuous to humans, and obtaining natural-looking textures can be difficult under the constraint of repetitive patterns. In this paper, we propose a 3D modeling pipeline to produce natural-looking adversarial clothes that are physically realizable and can hide people at multiple viewing angles. Specifically, we craft adversarial camouflage texture (AdvCaT) patterns and apply them on clothes. We choose camouflage texture patterns mainly because they are typical texture patterns widely used in daily clothes, therefore making the clothes more natural-looking\nIn order to make the texture patterns more generalizable when applied to deformed and unseen 3D models, we propose a novel 3D augmentation method combining topologically plausible projection (TopoProj) and thin plate spline (TPS)  0  8 for non-rigid objects such as clothes. We optimized several AdvCaT patterns to attack widely used detection models, including YOLOv3 , Faster RCNN , and deformable DETR , and applied the texture patterns on clothes in the physical world. See Fig. 1 for the visualization of our adversarial clothes compared with others. Experiments showed that our adversarial clothes could evade different detectors at multiple viewing angles. A subjective test experiment indicated that the naturalness score of our adversarial clothes covered with AdvCaT is significantly higher than other adversarial clothes and close to daily clothes.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: examples were first identified in the digital world.
