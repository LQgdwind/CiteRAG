      "content": "Paper Title: Accelerated Sparse Neural Training: A Provable and Efficient Method to Find N:M Transposable Masks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPruning of neural networks weights has been extensively investigated, starting with classical methods in the late 1980s     and then amounting to dozens of papers published in recent years. Since DNNs are generally over-parameterized, pruning the weights reduces their memory footprint. In special cases, when the sparsity mask has a specific pattern, it has the potential to reduce computational footprint as well. The most common practice is to prune a pretrained dense model, so that it will be sparse at deployment. Since the accuracy of the pretrained dense model is known, one can tune the sparsity level to ensure comparable accuracy for the sparse model. Recently, a new line of research that aims to train sparse models from scratch [ref]14  [ref]9 has emerged. The goal is to train models that cannot fit into currently available hardware. Next, we briefly overview the structured, unstructured, and accelerating-sparse-training categories. It removes individual elements of the matrix, aiming for high total sparsity, while being agnostic to the location of the pruned elements. Standard pruning methods are based on different criteria, such as magnitude , approximate L0subscriptùêø0L_{0} regularization , or connection sensitivity . Recent methods [ref]12, suggested to train a dense network until convergence, extract the required mask (‚Äúwinning ticket\"), and use the original training regime to re-train the active weights from their original initialization or final values  using the original training schedule. These methods are able to achieve over 80% sparsity on ResNet50- ImageNet dataset . Despite the high sparsity ratio that can be achieved with these methods, modern hardware cannot efficiently utilize such a form of sparsity for reducing computational resources . It removes weights in specific location based patterns, which are more useful for hardware acceleration. Such methods can be applied at either the level of channels or layers. For example, Li et¬†al.  remove the channels with the lower norm, Luo et¬†al.  prune channels according to the effect on the activation of the following layer, and  split the filters\ninto multiple groups, applying a group Lasso regularization. All these methods are natively supported in both hardware and software, as they effectively change the model structure by reducing channels or groups. Yet, no such method was able to achieve a reasonable accuracy with sparsity levels higher than 50%. As observed by Liu et¬†al. , filter pruning of a pretrained dense over-parameterized\nmodel is rarely the best method to obtain an efficient final model. Thus, here the structured pruning serves mostly as a DNN architecture search for the optimal compact model  .\nOur work is most closely related to Zhou et¬†al. , which is the first work that attempted training with a fine-grained N:M:ùëÅùëÄN:M structured sparsity mask, as explained above. The most common approach for sparse model deployment requires a three steps process: (a) train a dense model; (b) define a sparsity mask (c) fine-tune while enforcing the mask on the model‚Äôs weights. The lottery ticket hypothesis of Frankle & Carbin [ref]12 demonstrates that we can avoid the dense training, i.e., step (a), had we known how to choose the appropriate mask. Since Frankle & Carbin [ref]12 discovered the optimal mask (winning ticket) by applying dense training, the question of how to find the optimal mask without training remained open. Since setting a predefined fixed mask results in some accuracy degradation (Gray et¬†al. [ref]14 that requires expanding the model size), several researchers     [ref]9 tried to enable dynamic mask changes during the training process. All methods focused on unstructured sparsity and aimed to enable training large models on hardware with memory limitations.\nIn contrast to these approaches, Zhou et¬†al.  does not aim to reduce the model memory footprint during training, but rather accelerate inference while avoiding dense pre-training. To that end, they keep a dense weight matrix, and in each iteration they re-calculate the mask. With the obtained pruned copy of the weights they perform the forward and backward pass and update the dense copy. Therefore, this method is most relevant when a pretrained dense model is not given, and one wishes to obtain a fine grained N:M:ùëÅùëÄN:M sparse model for inference. While our work focuses on the setting of Zhou et¬†al. , we argue that it can easily combined with Evci et¬†al. [ref]9 work, as it aims to solve a different issue within the same problem.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: pretrained dense model is known, one can tune the sparsity level to ensure comparable accuracy for the sparse model.
