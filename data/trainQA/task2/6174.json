      "content": "Paper Title: An Ensemble Semi-Supervised Adaptive Resonance Theory Model with Explanation Capability for Pattern Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSupervised learning models are effective for problems with sufficient labeled samples.\nHowever, obtaining labeled samples in many real-world problems, e.g., medical diagnosis and fault diagnosis, is expensive, difficult, and time-consuming, as it requires human labeling efforts.\nMeanwhile, unlabeled samples contain useful information such as geometric structure, and exploiting such information can help to learn a better model  [ref]2  .\nSemi-supervised learning (SSL) techniques offer a good compromise to address such problems   .\nThey use a large number of unlabeled samples to augment a small set of labeled samples, in order to improve the performance of a learning model   0. The success of SSL techniques is attributed to the three assumptions, which are semi-supervised smoothness, manifold, and cluster assumptions 1.\nSemi-supervised smoothness assumes that two samples should share the same target class if they are close in a high-density region.\nThe manifold assumption states that a higher degree of similarity is ensured if the high-dimensional samples lie on a low-dimensional manifold.\nWhile the cluster-based assumption indicates that if two samples are located in a cluster, they belong to the same class 2.\nIn general, SSL techniques can be categorized into self-training, co-training, generative and graph-based methods 3 4.\nSelf-training techniques use a classifier to bootstrap the learning model with labeled samples that obtained from their own highly confident predictions 5.\nWhile, co-training techniques utilize multiple classifiers and iteratively re-train them by each other’s most confident predictions 6.\nGenerative-based methods aim to model a process to generate samples 7.\nGraph-based techniques build graph and find a minimum energy to link unlabeled samples to the labeled ones 8.\nAlthough the existing SSL methods have shown good performance on different problems, most of them behave as a black box due to their complex structures and iterative process, leading to difficulties for users to interpret their predictions. The family of Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) networks 9 offers a self-organized, online learning model pertaining to a sequence of incoming data samples with the capability of providing explanation pertaining to a predicted output and solving both unsupervised and supervised problems.\nFuzzy ART  and fuzzy ARTMAP  are the most prominent members of unsupervised and supervised ART models, respectively.\nThey benefit from ART in solving stability-plasticity dilemma, i.e., the ability to learn new samples without forgetting previously learned ones.\nThey also benefit from fuzzy logic in handling vague and imprecise human linguistic information.\nThe key learning concept of an ART model is the determination of the similarity level among the prototype nodes stored in its structure and the current input sample against a criterion.\nIf the criterion is not satisfied, the ART model adds a new prototype node to encode the current input sample.\nTo date, many hybrid models have been developed to enhance the performance of ART-based networks, e.g., fuzzy ARTMAP with reinforcement learning  ,\npopulation-based evolutionary algorithms  , as well as SSL method .\nHowever, one key limitation of ART-based models is a high dependence on the sequence of the learning samples.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: as it requires human labeling efforts.\nMeanwhile, unlabeled samples contain useful information such as geometric structure, and exploiting such information can help to learn a better model  [ref]2  .\nSemi-supervised learning (SSL) techniques offer a good compromise to address such problems   .\nThey use a large number of unlabeled samples to augment a small set of labeled samples, in\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
