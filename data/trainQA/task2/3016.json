      "content": "Paper Title: Auto-Encoding Knowledge Graph for Unsupervised Medical Report Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs shown in Figure 1, the proposed KGAE includes a knowledge graph, a knowledge-driven encoder and a knowledge-driven decoder, which will be described in detail in the following sections. Knowledge Graph   \nThe motivation of using the knowledge graph is that writing medical reports usually requires particular domain knowledge [ref]11 . Therefore, we can utilize the knowledge graph, which models the domain-specific knowledge structure, to serve as a bridge to correlate the knowledge representations of the visual and textual domains.\nIn particular, we construct an off-the-shelf global medical knowledge graph 𝒢=(V,E)𝒢𝑉𝐸\\mathcal{G}=(V,E) covering the common abnormalities and normalities, where V={vi}i=1:NKG∈ℝNKG×d𝑉subscriptsubscript𝑣𝑖:𝑖1subscript𝑁KGsuperscriptℝsubscript𝑁KG𝑑V=\\{v_{i}\\}_{i=1:N_{\\text{KG}}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N_{\\text{KG}}\\times d} is a set of nodes and E={ei,j}i,j=1:NKG𝐸subscriptsubscript𝑒𝑖𝑗:𝑖𝑗1subscript𝑁KGE=\\{e_{i,j}\\}_{i,j=1:N_{\\text{KG}}} is a set of edges.\nIn detail, based on the report corpus, i.e., MIMIC-CXR , we consider the NKGsubscript𝑁KGN_{\\text{KG}} frequent clinical abnormalities (e.g., \"enlarged heart size\", \"pleural effusion\", and \"bibasilar consolidation\") and normalities (e.g., \"heart size is normal\" and \"lungs are clear\") as nodes.\nThe edge weights are calculated by the normalized co-occurrence of different nodes computed from report corpus. Please note that this knowledge graph is built purely from the training set of MIMIC-CXR, thus there is no label leakage.\nAfter that, the knowledge graph is embedded by a graph embedding module, i.e., graph convolution network  , which is implemented as follows: where ReLU​(⋅)ReLU⋅\\text{ReLU}(\\cdot) represents the ReLU activation function and Wv∈ℝd×dsubscript𝑊𝑣superscriptℝ𝑑𝑑W_{v}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times d} is the learnable matrix.\nAs a result, we can acquire a set of node embeddings V′={v1′,v2′,…,vNKG′}∈ℝNKG×dsuperscript𝑉′subscriptsuperscript𝑣′1subscriptsuperscript𝑣′2…subscriptsuperscript𝑣′subscript𝑁KGsuperscriptℝsubscript𝑁KG𝑑V^{\\prime}=\\{v^{\\prime}_{1},v^{\\prime}_{2},\\dots,v^{\\prime}_{N_{\\text{KG}}}\\}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N_{\\text{KG}}\\times d}.\nIt is worth noting that more complex graph structures could be constructed by using more large-scale medical textbooks. Therefore, our model is not limited to the currently constructed graph and could provide a good basis for the research of unsupervised medical report generation for other domains. Knowledge-driven Encoder   \nThe knowledge-driven encoder (KE) is designed to utilize the knowledge graph 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} to extract knowledge representations (𝒢I∈ℝNI×dsubscript𝒢𝐼superscriptℝsubscript𝑁𝐼𝑑\\mathcal{G}_{I}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N_{I}\\times d} and 𝒢R∈ℝNR×dsubscript𝒢𝑅superscriptℝsubscript𝑁𝑅𝑑\\mathcal{G}_{R}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N_{R}\\times d}) of both image I𝐼I and report R𝑅R to bridge the vision and the language domains, which can be formulated as: In implementations, as shown in Figure 1, we first adopt the ResNet-50  and the Transformer [ref]37 as the image embedding module and report embedding module to embed the image I𝐼I and report R𝑅R, acquiring the image embeddings I′∈ℝNI×dsuperscript𝐼′superscriptℝsubscript𝑁𝐼𝑑I^{\\prime}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N_{I}\\times d} and report embeddings R′∈ℝNR×dsuperscript𝑅′superscriptℝsubscript𝑁𝑅𝑑R^{\\prime}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N_{R}\\times d}, respectively.\nNext, to extract the knowledge representations from knowledge graph 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G}, we adopt the attention mechanism [ref]37 to implement the KE.\nThe motivation stems from that the attention mechanism can compute the association weights between different features and allows probabilistic many-to-many relations instead of monotonic relations, as in [ref]37  . As a result, we take I′superscript𝐼′I^{\\prime} and R′superscript𝑅′R^{\\prime} as the queries, and take the knowledge graph 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} (i.e., V′={v1′,v2′,…,vNKG′}∈ℝNKG×dsuperscript𝑉′subscriptsuperscript𝑣′1subscriptsuperscript𝑣′2…subscriptsuperscript𝑣′subscript𝑁KGsuperscriptℝsubscript𝑁KG𝑑V^{\\prime}=\\{v^{\\prime}_{1},v^{\\prime}_{2},\\dots,v^{\\prime}_{N_{\\text{KG}}}\\}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N_{\\text{KG}}\\times d}) as the lookup matrix: where x∈ℝNx×dx,y∈ℝNy×dyformulae-sequence𝑥superscriptℝsubscript𝑁𝑥subscript𝑑𝑥𝑦superscriptℝsubscript𝑁𝑦subscript𝑑𝑦x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N_{x}\\times d_{x}},y\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N_{y}\\times d_{y}}; Wq∈ℝdx×dxsubscript𝑊qsuperscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝑥subscript𝑑𝑥W_{\\text{q}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{x}\\times d_{x}}, Wk∈ℝdy×dysubscript𝑊ksuperscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝑦subscript𝑑𝑦W_{\\text{k}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{y}\\times d_{y}} and Wv∈ℝdy×dysubscript𝑊vsuperscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝑦subscript𝑑𝑦W_{\\text{v}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{y}\\times d_{y}} (dx=dysubscript𝑑𝑥subscript𝑑𝑦d_{x}=d_{y}) are learnable parameters.\nℱℱ\\mathcal{F} is implemented as two fully-connected (FC) layers with a ReLU in between, i.e., FC-ReLU-FC.\nThe resulted 𝒢I∈ℝNI×dsubscript𝒢𝐼superscriptℝsubscript𝑁𝐼𝑑\\mathcal{G}_{I}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N_{I}\\times d} and 𝒢R∈ℝNR×dsubscript𝒢𝑅superscriptℝsubscript𝑁𝑅𝑑\\mathcal{G}_{R}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N_{R}\\times d} turn out to be a set of attended (i.e., extracted) knowledge related to the image and report.\nThe knowledge representations 𝒢Isubscript𝒢𝐼\\mathcal{G}_{I} and 𝒢Rsubscript𝒢𝑅\\mathcal{G}_{R} share the common latent space which bridges the vision and the language domains.\nNote that the ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} used in KEIsubscriptKE𝐼\\text{KE}_{I} and KERsubscriptKE𝑅\\text{KE}_{R} shares the same parameters and is thus introduced to further boost the bridging capabilities of different modalities.\nIt means that we adopt two KEs, i.e., KEIsubscriptKE𝐼\\text{KE}_{I} and KERsubscriptKE𝑅\\text{KE}_{R}, and each KE includes an attention model as well as a common mapping function ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}. The only shared weights of KEIsubscriptKE𝐼\\text{KE}_{I} and KERsubscriptKE𝑅\\text{KE}_{R} are the parameters of ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}, and the parameters of attention models are independent. Knowledge-driven Decoder   \nThe decoder is designed to generate the reports based on the graph representations 𝒢Isubscript𝒢𝐼\\mathcal{G}_{I} or 𝒢Rsubscript𝒢𝑅\\mathcal{G}_{R}.\nFor clarity, we use 𝒢ksubscript𝒢𝑘\\mathcal{G}_{k} to represent the 𝒢Rsubscript𝒢𝑅\\mathcal{G}_{R} and 𝒢Isubscript𝒢𝐼\\mathcal{G}_{I} during the training and testing stages, respectively.\nIn implementations, since medical report generation requires generating a long paragraph, we choose the (three-layer) Transformer [ref]37 as the basic module of our decoder and incorporate the proposed Knowledge-driven Attention (KA) to effectively model the long sequences. At each decoding step t𝑡t, the decoder takes the embedding of current input word xt=wt+et∈ℝ2​dsubscript𝑥𝑡subscript𝑤𝑡subscript𝑒𝑡superscriptℝ2𝑑x_{t}=w_{t}+e_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2d} as input, where wtsubscript𝑤𝑡w_{t} and etsubscript𝑒𝑡e_{t} denote the word embedding and fixed position embedding, respectively, and generate each word rtsubscript𝑟𝑡r_{t} in report R={r1,r2,…,rT}𝑅subscript𝑟1subscript𝑟2…subscript𝑟𝑇R=\\{r_{1},r_{2},\\dots,r_{T}\\}, which can be defined as follows: where FFN stands for Feed-Forward Network in the original Transformer [ref]37; Wp∈ℝ2​d×|D|subscriptW𝑝superscriptℝ2𝑑𝐷\\text{W}_{p}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2d\\times|D|} is the learnable parameter (|D|𝐷|D| denotes the vocabulary size); B𝐵B represents the knowledge bank in the KA. In particular, the knowledge-driven attention (KA) is inspired by the success of many works that attempt to augment a working memory into the network, e.g., memory network. Memory network preserves a dynamic knowledge base for subsequent inference [ref]36      . For example, [ref]36  and   proposed to preserve the context of a document and visual knowledge to solve language modeling and visual question answering, respectively.\nIn this paper, since the knowledge representations 𝒢ksubscript𝒢𝑘\\mathcal{G}_{k} are extracted from the off-the-shelf global knowledge graph 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G}, we incorporate a knowledge memory mechanism to distill and preserve the fine-grained medical knowledge related to report generation task, which encourages our decoder to generate more accurate and desirable reports.\nSpecifically, we introduce the knowledge bank B={b1,b2,…,bNB}∈ℝNB×d𝐵subscript𝑏1subscript𝑏2…subscript𝑏subscript𝑁Bsuperscriptℝsubscript𝑁B𝑑B=\\{b_{1},b_{2},\\dots,b_{N_{\\text{B}}}\\}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N_{\\text{B}}\\times d}, where NBsubscript𝑁BN_{\\text{B}} stands for the total number of the knowledge corresponding to report generation.\nAs a result, given the graph representations 𝒢k∈ℝNk×dsubscript𝒢𝑘superscriptℝsubscript𝑁𝑘𝑑\\mathcal{G}_{k}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N_{k}\\times d}, the knowledge memory mechanism is defined as follows: Through above operation, each feature/vector in the 𝒢k∈ℝNk×dsubscript𝒢𝑘superscriptℝsubscript𝑁𝑘𝑑\\mathcal{G}_{k}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N_{k}\\times d} can distill the fine-grained knowledge preserved in B𝐵B to acquire Bk∈ℝNk×dsubscript𝐵𝑘superscriptℝsubscript𝑁𝑘𝑑{B}_{k}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N_{k}\\times d} for accurate report generation. Based on the above mechanism, the knowledge-driven attention in Eq. (5) is defined as: where [⋅;⋅]⋅⋅[\\cdot;\\cdot] denotes the concatenation operation.\nIt is worth noting that these operations are all differentiable, thus the bank B𝐵B can be learned in an end-to-end fashion. In our subsequent analysis, we will show that the introduced knowledge memory mechanism indeed distills and preserves the desired medical knowledge, and thus boost the generation of reports.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: will be described in detail in the following sections.
