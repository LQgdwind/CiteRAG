      "content": "Paper Title: Data fusion strategies for energy efficiency in buildings: Overview, challenges and novel orientations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis section deals with the conducted works on data fusion based energy efficiency systems, most of which are related to human behavioral change. They describe different energy efficiency frameworks for persuading consumers and their corresponding methodologies. Most of the following frameworks are part of an initiative started by the Europe Commission under the Horizon 2020 program to reach “Secure, Clean and Efficient Energy” state . Thus, it is best to review what they have achieved so far as it is the most recent works done on energy efficiency. In , BIGFUSE attempts to develop semantic-based information fusion and analysis techniques for (a) combining multimodality data from multiple sources; and (b) extracting practical knowledge to support the users to make the right decisions to reduce energy wastage. In , STREAMER architecture is proposed aiming at developing a semantic data fusion strategy to motivate buildings’ occupants towards adopting energy efficient lifestyles. To achieve this challenge, this project relies on the fusion of data through the combination of building information models (BIM) and geographic information systems (GIS).\nIn [ref]216, BENEFFICE platform uses a multi-sensor data fusion strategy to monitor energy consumption in typical households and hence aids in reducing electricity usage via following energy saving recommendations triggered by a mobile application. The latter allows users earning CO2 coins to exchange with real currency (Euros). In , the ORBEET platform focuses on fusing data of BIM, business process models and real-time power consumption footprints. This was made possible by using a cloud computing server aiming at enabling electricity usage monitoring and establishing a real-time countability of individuals inside buildings and work spaces to a better energy management.\nIn , MOBISTYLE incorporates what other projects missed to add, which includes the health aspect of the energy consumers. This framework opted not only for providing guidance for reducing energy consumption, but also took into consideration suggestions for creating a healthy environment. Multiple sensors are used to measure indoor conditions such as temperature, humidity and CO2 levels along with power consumptions, in addition to user occupancy, thermostat adjustments, windows and doors openings and outdoor environmental variables from online sources . Papaioannou et al.  introduce ChArGED ecosystem, in which the objective of creating a serious game is to persuade consumers to reduce energy consumption at peak hours. Based on given peak hours slots by the electric utility, contests between the players are designed to monitor their overall consumption using data fusion from multiple sources . In , GreenPlay architecture is proposed, which aims at raising consciousness among household users via implementing a real-time power usage monitoring platform along with developing a serious game. In , Brudermann et al. propose TRIBE project that targets how to contribute to an end-user behavioral change to achieve a high level energy saving in public buildings. This is done through (a) collecting and aggregating data from various sources; (b) engaging consumers in the adventure of playing a serious game that is connected to real-time data collection; and (c) providing actionable feedback to reduce wasted energy.\nIn , the EnerGAware platform essentially focuses on providing a serious game heavily backed by IoT sensors fusion and integration using a service management system based on publish/subscribe approach. The main purpose of the serious game is to improve the likelihood of behavioral change for energy consumers via education and training. Rewards given in the serious game are based on improvements in their recorded energy consumption reductions. Furthermore, game progress is recorded to see the effect of the game with respect to real-life energy savings (i.e. how much the end-users have gathered points) .\nIn , the PEAKapp framework is proposed to incentivize consumers comport in an energy saving manner by supplying personalized saving pieces of advice through a social game application. Overall, data are collected and fused from different sensors to automatically provide discounts during peaks of power consumption for electricity produced from renewable energies. This results in significantly reducing carbon footprints. In , enCOMPASS architecture creates a recommendation system that provides energy saving suggestions based on the fusion of contextual data. Advised actions (recommendations) are generated based on collecting, fusing and analyzing data from various sources, including electricity consumption, user presence, indoor and outdoor temperatures and humidity. In addition, the data visualization and user participation tool MyEnCompass  along with the game application Funergy, are implemented to raise awareness regarding energy consumption, especially for kids .\nIn , ENTROPY strives to boost behavioral change towards energy saving in buildings environment. Interestingly, it uses a set of novel ICT elements, generally categorized by data fusion, semantic web, context-based recommendations, information retrieval and analysis strategies. Along with that, designs of both recommender system and serious game are established . In addition to data collected from power meters, ambient sensors and outside weather conditions, information related to the user such as his/her nickname, role, gender, age and score are also gathered.\nIn  , the overall objective of the GAIA ecosystem is to reduce energy consumption of academic community, faculty, staff, students and parents. A recommender system is deployed to produce tailored recommendations based on the collection, fusion and analysis of multiple data sources from academic buildings. Towards this regard, an inventive ICT framework is implemented using web-based, mobile, social and sensing devices.\nIn , the GreenSoul platform is deployed with the view of saving more than 20% of energy consumption through behavioural modification recommendations. The latter are generated based on gathering and fusing data from several pilot buildings in different climate areas. Further, it can also properly evaluate the improvements made by end-users. In , BestEenergy ecosystem uses a set of data visualization tools such as interactive websites and giant screens to inform end-users about their power usage footprints. To that end, various energy consumption fingerprints from different sources are recorded, fused and then visualized in order to come up with an energy saving decision-making feedback.\nWhile, in , eSESH platform provides efficient energy usage monitoring and control of electricity consumption mainly through visualizing and comparing consumption footprints collected and fused from a social housing network. Consequently, end-users could compare their consumption rates over short or long periods and can have access to a prediction of their energy usage.\nFollowing, SmartBuild framework  provides the end-users with visualization and statistical tools about the social-economic benefits that can be achieved when they follow a set of energy efficiency orientations. The latter are generated based on collecting, fusing and analyzing consumption fingerprints and comfort preferences from 9 pilot buildings. It also offers consumers the possibility to remotely monitor their electrical appliances and communicate their feedback about building comfort and satisfaction.\nNext, in , SAVE@WORK platform is developed in order to endorse energy saving in public buildings. This is mainly assisted with the implementation of online data visualization tools built upon data collection and fusion of various consumption and ambient conditions. Visualization provides end-users with real-time consumption statistics and comparisons to prompt them to shortage wasted energy. Finally, the EM3 initiative   is proposed, which allows exploiting power consumption data and ambient conditions to develop energy efficiency models and smart data analytics that highlight opportunities for consumers and businesses. This was possible through (a) data collection and fusion at different levels ; (b) data analysis using the micro-moment paradigm, which helps in detecting anomalous power consumption, such as excessive consumption and/or consumption while the end-user is outside; (c) a mobile recommender system that is used to provide end-users with personalized advices to optimize their consumption levels; and (d) novel interactive visualizations that allow end-users to easily comprehend their consumption footprints .\nTable 1, summarizes a list of several data fusion based energy efficiency ecosystems. It presents a comparison between these frameworks based on the different aspects discussed in the aforementioned sub-sections, including (1) data fusion level; (2) data fusion techniques; (3) behavioral change influencer; (4) behavioral change incentive; (5) recorded data; (6) platform architecture; (7) IoT technologies; and (8) application scenario.\n\nReference markers found: [216]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]216: efficient lifestyles.
