This research was supported in part by NSF under Grant CCF-2300356.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUnit-disk graphs are a fundamental model in wireless networks, particularly where coverage and connectivity are governed by proximity¬†   . However, many classical graph problems, including coloring, vertex cover, independent set, and dominating set, remain NP-hard even when restricted to unit-disk graphs¬†. One exception is that finding a maximum clique in a unit-disk graph can be done in polynomial time¬†  1 and the current best algorithm runs in O‚Äã(n2.5‚Äãlog‚Å°n)O(n^{2.5}\\log n) time¬†1 (see¬† for a comment about improving the runtime to O‚Äã(n7/3+o‚Äã(1))O(n^{7/3+o(1)})). The assumption that points are in convex position can simplify certain problems that are otherwise NP-hard for general point sets in the plane.\nThis has motivated the exploration of other computational problems under similar assumptions. For example, the continuous kk-center problem where centers can be anywhere in the plane is NP-hard for arbitrary points but become polynomial time solvable under the convex position assumption .\nThe convex position constraint was even considered for classical problems that are already polynomial time solvable in the general case. For instance, the renowned result of Aggarwal, Guibas, Saxe, and Shor¬† gives a linear time algorithm for computing the Voronoi diagram for a set of planar points in convex position. Refer to 4   for more work for points in convex position. The kk-center problem under a variety of constraints has received much attention. Particularly, when kk, the number of centers, is two and the centers can be anywhere in the plane (referred to as the continuous 22-center problem), several near-linear time algorithms have been developed¬†   2, culminating in an optimal O‚Äã(n‚Äãlog‚Å°n)O(n\\log n) time¬†1.\nThe problem variations under other constraints were also considered.\nFor example, the kk-center problem can be solved in O‚Äã(n‚Äãlog‚Å°n)O(n\\log n) time if centers are required to lie on the same line¬†4  or two lines¬†[ref]11.\nThe continuous one-center problem is the classical smallest enclosing circle problem and can be solved in linear time¬†. For the convex position case of the continuous kk-center problem,\nChoi, Lee, and Ahn¬† proposed an O‚Äã(min‚Å°{k,log‚Å°n}‚ãÖn2‚Äãlog‚Å°n+k2‚Äãn‚Äãlog‚Å°n)O(\\min\\{k,\\log n\\}\\cdot n^{2}\\log n+k^{2}n\\log n) time algorithm. Hence, the worst-case runtime of their algorithm is cubic, while our discrete kk-center algorithm runs in near quadratic time. The discrete 22-center problem also gets considerable attention. Agarwal, Sharir, and Welzl gave the first subquadratic O‚Äã(n4/3‚Äãlog5‚Å°n)O(n^{4/3}\\log^{5}n) time algorithm¬†; the logarithmic factor was slightly improved by Wang¬†3.\nAs the continuous two-center problem can be solved in O‚Äã(n‚Äãlog‚Å°n)O(n\\log n) time¬†1 while the current best discrete two-center algorithm runs in Œ©‚Äã(n4/3)\\Omega(n^{4/3}) time¬† 3, the discrete problem appears more challenging than the continuous counterpart. This makes our discrete kk-center algorithm even more interesting because it is almost a linear factor faster than the continuous kk-center algorithm in . Therefore, it is an intriguing question whether the algorithm in  can be further improved. Other variations of the discrete kk-center problem for small kk were recently studied by Chan, He, and Yu¬†, improving over previous results¬†  9. The dispersion problem and some of its variants have also been studied before. The general planar dispersion problem can be solved by an exact algorithm in nO‚Äã(k)n^{O(\\sqrt{k})} time¬†.\nIf all points of PP lie on a single line, Araki and Nakano¬† gave an algorithm of O‚Äã((2‚Äãk2)k‚ãÖn)O((2k^{2})^{k}\\cdot n) time (assuming that the points are not given sorted), which is O‚Äã(n)O(n) for a constant kk. For a circular case where all points of PP lie on a circle and the distance between two points is measured by their distance along the circle, the problem is solvable in O‚Äã(n)O(n) time¬†8, provided that the points are given sorted along the circle. We note that this implies that the line case problem, which can be viewed as a special case of the circular case, is also solvable in O‚Äã(n)O(n) time after the points are sorted on the line.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: under other constraints were also considered.\nFor example, the kk-center problem can be solved in O‚Äã(n‚Äãlog‚Å°n)O(n\\log n) time if centers are required to lie on the same line¬†4  or two lines¬†[ref]11.\nThe continuous one-center problem is the classical smallest enclosing circle problem and can be solved in linear time¬†. For the convex position case of the continuous kk-center\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
