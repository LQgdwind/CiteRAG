      "content": "Paper Title: Face Swapping as A Simple Arithmetic Operation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFace swapping has long been an interesting and difficult problem in\ncomputer vision [ref]7. Early approaches are\nmainly based on conventional image processing techniques, thus, require\nthe source and target faces to have similar poses and appearances\n 7. With the development deep neural\nnetworks, especially deep generative models such as VAEs 4\nand GANs , more advanced face swapping\nmethods have been proposed. Korshunova et al. \nregard face swapping as a style transfer problem in which content\nis the target face, and style is the source identity. They leverage\na Texture Network  to model the identity\nof each subject in the training data. However, their method cannot\ngeneralize to unseen subjects. Nirkin et al. \nlearn an occlusion-aware face segmentation model and combine it with\noff-the-shelf 3D morphable face models (3DMM)  \nand image blending model  to form a complete\npipeline for face swapping that can handle unconstrained face images.\nTheir subsequent work  further enhances this\npipeline by proposing a novel reenactment generator to better preserve\nthe target pose and expression, and a novel blending loss to better\npreserve the target skin color. However, due to the limitation of\nthe Possion blender in simulating complex textures and lighting effects,\nmethods based on this technique   \ntend to create unnatural swapped faces. Therefore, there has been\nanother line of works that make use of GANs to generate real looking\nswapped faces. FSNet  extracts the representation\nof the source face region and the representation of the target face\nlandmarks, and sends them along with the target face-masked image\nto an UNet-like generator to generate a swapped face. Since only the\ntarget landmark information is given as input to the generator, this\nmodel may not be able to preserve the expression and skin color of\nthe target face. IPGAN  generates a swapped\nface from the concatenation of the source identity and the target\nattribute vectors. This method can generalize to unseen identities\nquite well but often fails to preserve details in the target face\nsuch as wrinkles or beards. FaceShifter \nproposes a well-designed generator that combines the source identity\nvector with the target attribute feature maps at various spatial resolutions.\nThis generator can generate good-looking a swapped face that faithfully\nrespects the style and resolution of the target face. The swapped\nface then goes through a refinement network for facial occlusion correction.\nSimSwap  uses an ID Injection Module (IIM)\nto integrate the source identity into the target features before sending\nto the generator. This IIM contains multiple AdaIN layers \nwhose parameters depend on the source identity. HiFiFace 8\nextends the source identity vector with the target 3D pose and expression\nrepresentation vectors extracted by a 3DMM model ,\nand uses this extended source identity vector to modulate the generation\nof a swapped face from the target face in nearly the same way as FaceShifter.\nFaceInpainter  is a two-stage face swapping\nframework inspired by FaceShifter that also uses 3D pose and expression\nas prior knowledge for face swapping. InfoSwap \nleverages the Information Bottleneck principle \nto achieve a good separation between identity and style information. Besides the aforementioned methods, some methods make use of a pretrained\nStyleGAN2 and are more related to ours. These methods usually map\nthe source and the target faces to the StyleGAN2 intermediate latent\ncodes, and use these latent codes to perform face swapping. MegaFS\n uses a Face Transfer Module (FTM) to fuse 14 high-level\ncomponents of the source and the target latent codes together. The\nfused high-level components are then concatenated with the remaining\n4 low-level components of the target latent codes to obtain a complete\nswapped latent code which serves as the input to the StyleGAN2 generator\nto generate a swapped face. HiRes  uses both the\nsource and the target facial landmarks to modify the “structure”\npart of the source latent codes (consisting of the first 7 components),\nand combines the modified one with the “appearance” part of the\ntarget latent codes (consisting of the last 11 components) to obtain\na swapped latent code. This swapped latent code is then fed to the\nStyleGAN2 generator not to generate a swapped face but to get the\nintermediate feature maps. These intermediate feature maps will be\nused to modulate another auto-encoder network that maps the target\nface to the actual swapped face. Due to large scopes of GAN Inversion and GAN Latent Space Manipulation,\nin this paper, we only discuss works in these topics that are the\nmost related to ours. Given a well-trained GAN, we often want to find\nthe latent code that faithfully represents an input image. There are\nthree main approaches to the problem namely i) latent optimization\n  0 8,\nii) learning an encoder 3 5 4,\nand iii) the hybrid of learning an encoder and latent optimization\n 4. The first approach directly optimizes\na random latent code by minimizing the reconstruction error between\nthe generated image w.r.t. the latent code and the input image. This\napproach often yields accurate inversion but does not scale well since\nwe have to run multiple optimization steps for each input image. By\ncontrast, the second approach computes the latent code via a single\nforward pass through the encoder, thus, is significantly faster at\ninference time. The third approach learns an encoder to find good\ninitializations of latent codes, then optimizes these latent initializations.\nThis approach often enjoys the benefits of fast inference and good\naccuracy from the first two approaches. Many recent works have shown that semantically meaningful image editions\ncan be done via simple affine transformations in the latent space\nof a pretrained GAN. Some works try to discover interpretable directions\nin the GAN latent space in an unsupervised manner 7 9 6.\nHowever, they have to manually assign semantics to the discovered\ndirections. Supervised methods 8 2 3 1,\nby contrast, make use of pretrained attribute classifiers/regressors\nto guide the search for semantic directions.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Face swapping has long been an interesting and difficult problem in\ncomputer vision [ref]7.
