      "content": "Paper Title: UTTS: Unsupervised TTS with Conditional Disentangled Sequential Variational Auto-encoder\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nText-to-speech (TTS) synthesis plays an important role for human computer interaction. With the continuous development of neural-based TTS systems, e.g., Tacotron , DurIAN [ref]2, FastSpeech [ref]3 [ref]4  or more recent Glow-TTS series   , high-fidelity synthetic speech has been produced and the gap between machine generated speech and real speech is reduced. This is especially true for languages with rich resources, which refers to a sizeable high quality parallel speech and textual data. Usually, the supervised TTS system requires dozens of hours of single-speaker high quality data to retain a good performance. However, collecting and labeling such data is a non-trivial task, which is time-consuming and expensive. In that sense, current supervised solutions are still have their limitations on the demanding needs of ubiquitous deployment of customized speech synthesizers for AI assistants, gaming or entertainment industries. Natural, flexible and controllable TTS pathways become more essential when facing these diverse needs. One possible way to relax the aforementioned limitation is to develop unsupervised text-to-speech (UTTS) synthesis, which does not require high quality parallel speech and textual data for training TTS acoustic models (AM). In this preliminary study, we propose a novel UTTS framework based on the recent advancement of self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques for speech representation  0 1 2. Like many conventional supervised TTS systems, our proposed UTTS framework is essentially a two-stage TTS process, namely an acoustic model that converts a raw text to a mel spectrogram and a vocoder which transforms the mel spectrogram to the speech waveform. While the supervised TTS AM achieves the text to mel spectrogram transformation by explicitly composing an external aligner or by learning a latent alignment  [ref]2 [ref]4 [ref]3 , the UTTS AM must resolve this mapping with an indirect way since no paired TTS training data is available. For conceptual comparison purpose, Fig.1 illustrates the necessary components of a typical supervised TTS AM (e.g., DurIAN [ref]2 or FastSpeech2 [ref]4 which shares a similar structure) and our UTTS AM. Although UTTS follows most of the procedures of supervised AM during inference, the UTTS AM differs the supervised AM in three major ways: 1) For supervised AM, the neural network maps forced alignment of phoneme sequence to frame-by-frame acoustic features. We replace forced alignment with unsupervised alignment, which is derived from acoustic partitioning with the SSL features (e.g., kmeans labels of WavLM 0 features). 2) supervised AMs (DurIAN and FastSpeech2) are only trained with TTS speech data, since UTTS investigates the Conditional Disentangled Sequential Variational Auto-encoder (C-DSVAE 1) as the backbone, the self-supervised/unsupervised model possibly enables more generic speech data to build a more generalized AM instead of being restricted with the TTS data only. 3) UTTS uses external speech recognition data to train the multi-speaker duration model and the projection between forced alignment to unsupervised alignment (FA2UA), while traditional TTS AMs rarely introduces such variability. For system implementation and experimental studies, the multi-speaker VCTK and LibriTTS dataset 3 4 are utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We show the possibility that UTTS can generate speech of high naturalness and intelligibility in terms of objective and subjective tests. Although more detailed explanations and analysis can be found throughout this paper, the main contributions of this work are summarized as follows: By exploring the conditions to end to end disentangled speech representation learning, we justify that unsupervised TTS AM is feasible. UTTS and voice conversion are unified under a generative model (C-DSVAE), showing the potential of employing self-supervised (disentangled) representation learning for voice generation tasks. With disentangled representations, UTTS offers a flexible framework that can bridge control signal (speaker identity, text, style etc.) and generated voice, which enables more fine grained processes for controllable and customized TTS. The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Sec II introduces the background and related work. Section III illustrates the C-DSVAE and its development for voice generation. The UTTS framework is presented in Sec IV. Experimental setup and results are shown in Sec V, with conclusions in Sec. VI.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis plays an important role for human computer interaction.
