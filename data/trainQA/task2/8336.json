      "content": "Paper Title: Impact-Aware Control using Time-Invariant Reference Spreading\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExploiting impacts in robotics has been a topic of interest for many years, enabling complex robotic locomotion tasks such as running   and jumping .\nRecently, research interest has also started to increase towards robotic impact-aware manipulation tasks such as hitting [ref]4, catching  or fast grabbing    of objects. One application domain that can benefit from this research is the field of material handling in logistics processes. Fast and reliable automated solutions with a small footprint are sought in this domain, but at the moment only human operators are capable of performing these tasks, which are often injury-prone and not fully ergonomic. Within this context, impact-aware dual-arm manipulation could provide a solution for fast material handling of heavy objects, potentially allowing for human-like swift pick-and-place operations without the need of creating a custom end effector for different types of handled products  0. Utilization of impacts in robotic manipulation in a human-like fashion can decrease cycle times, but requires addressing multiple challenges. Firstly, it needs to be ensured that hardware does not get damaged due to potentially large peak forces on the robots induced by impacts  1.\nBut secondly, even when impacts stay within safe limits, the rapid velocity transitions that result from the impact can result in a peak in the error between the desired and actual velocity of the robot under traditional tracking control as a result of the inevitable mismatch between the actual and the predicted impact times 2 3. This, in turn, results in undesired peaks in the actuator commands, potentially inducing vibrations, controller destabilization, hardware damage and increased energy consumption. This work focuses on the extension of a framework for robotic manipulation under nominally simultaneous impacts 4 suitable for single- and dual-arm manipulation. In a nominally simultaneous impact, contact between the environment and the robot or robots in all relevant contact areas is ideally established simultaneously with nonzero velocity. In the development of the proposed control strategy, impacts are modeled as instantaneous events, following theory of nonsmooth mechanics 5 6.\nIt is, however, inevitable that impacting surfaces are not perfectly aligned at the time of impact, or that one robot establishes contact just before the other robot (in dual-arm manipulation), for example, due to uncertainties in the environment.\nAs a result, a series of unplanned intermediate impacts and a corresponding unpredictable series of velocity jumps will typically occur, where it is generally not possible to estimate the contact state. As confirmed by simulations and experiments, this implies that velocity feedback control cannot be reliably used during an impact sequence 7 8. The control approach proposed in this work combines the ability to handle simultaneous impacts with a time-invariant framework for generating references, and is called time-invariant reference spreading. In this work, we present for the first time an application of this time-invariant reference spreading framework on a real-world robotic setup, as well as a thorough experimental validation.\nIn the remainder of this section, we will present the related works in more detail, followed by the precise research contribution and an outline of this work.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: enabling complex robotic locomotion tasks such as running   and jumping .\nRecently, research interest has also started to increase towards robotic impact-aware manipulation tasks such as hitting [ref]4, catching  or fast grabbing    of objects.
