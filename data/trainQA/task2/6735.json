      "content": "Paper Title: Motion Planning Diffusion: Learning and Planning of Robot Motions with Diffusion Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe briefly describe the standard motion planning costs used in the objective (III-B). Note that for cost functions defined on waypoints, the total cost for a trajectory is the sum of waypoint costs, i.e. c​(𝝉)=∑i∑j=0H−1ci​(𝝉​[j])𝑐𝝉subscript𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑗0𝐻1subscript𝑐𝑖𝝉delimited-[]𝑗c(\\bm{\\tau})=\\sum_{i}\\sum_{j=0}^{H-1}c_{i}(\\bm{\\tau}[j]). Start and Goal States Cost.\nFor the diffusion model, the start (𝒔ssubscript𝒔𝑠\\bm{s}_{s}) and goal (𝒔gsubscript𝒔𝑔\\bm{s}_{g}) state distribution is represented as a Dirac delta, i.e., one factor of (2) for the start state equates to\np​(𝝉​=𝒔s|𝝉)=δ𝝉​=𝒔s​(𝝉)𝑝𝝉delimited-[]0conditionalsubscript𝒔𝑠𝝉subscript𝛿𝝉delimited-[]0subscript𝒔𝑠𝝉p(\\bm{\\tau}=\\bm{s}_{s}|\\bm{\\tau})=\\delta_{\\bm{\\tau}=\\bm{s}_{s}}(\\bm{\\tau}). In practice, this is implemented by hard setting the initial and final configurations of the trajectory as in lines 1 and 1 of Algorithm 1 [ref]38.\nIf the generative model does not support Dirac delta distributions, this cost can also be formulated as a quadratic cost, e.g. for the start state c𝒔s​(𝝉)=‖𝒔s−𝝉​‖22subscript𝑐subscript𝒔𝑠𝝉subscriptsuperscriptnormsubscript𝒔𝑠𝝉delimited-[]022c_{\\bm{s}_{s}}(\\bm{\\tau})=\\|\\bm{s}_{s}-\\bm{\\tau}\\|^{2}_{2}. Collision Cost. Similar to GPMP , we populate K𝐾K collision spheres on the robot body. Given differentiable forward kinematics implemented in PyTorch [ref]50, with the kinematics Jacobian computed by auto-differentiation, the obstacle cost for any configuration 𝒒𝒒{\\bm{q}} is\ncobs​(𝒒)=1K​∑j=1Kc​(𝒙​(𝒒,Sj))subscript𝑐obs𝒒1𝐾superscriptsubscript𝑗1𝐾𝑐𝒙𝒒subscript𝑆𝑗{c_{\\textrm{obs}}({\\bm{q}})=\\frac{1}{K}\\sum_{j=1}^{K}c({\\bm{x}}({\\bm{q}},S_{j}))}\nwith 𝒙​(𝒒,Sj)𝒙𝒒subscript𝑆𝑗{\\bm{x}}({\\bm{q}},S_{j}) is the forward kinematics position of the jthsuperscript𝑗thj^{\\text{th}}-collision sphere. For gradient-based motion optimizers, we design the cost using the differentiable signed-distance function d​(⋅)𝑑⋅d(\\cdot) from the sphere center to the closest obstacle surface (minus the sphere radius) in the task space with a ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon>0 margin\nc​(𝒙)={−d​(𝒙)+ϵif ​d​(𝒙)≤ϵ0if ​d​(𝒙)>ϵ.𝑐𝒙cases𝑑𝒙italic-ϵif 𝑑𝒙italic-ϵ0if 𝑑𝒙italic-ϵ{c({\\bm{x}})=\\begin{cases}-d({\\bm{x}})+\\epsilon&\\text{if }d({\\bm{x}})\\leq\\epsilon\\\\\n0&\\text{if }d({\\bm{x}})>\\epsilon\\end{cases}}. Self-collision Cost. We group the collision spheres that belong to the same robot links. Then, we compute the pair-wise link sphere distances. The self-collision cost is the average of the computed pair-wise distances. Joint Limits Cost. We enforce joint limits (and velocity limits) by computing the L222 norm joint violations as costs, with a ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon>0 margin on each dimension i𝑖i End-effector Cost. The distance on SE(333) state space defines the end-effector cost. Given two points 𝑻1=[𝑹1,𝒑1]subscript𝑻1subscript𝑹1subscript𝒑1{{\\bm{T}}_{1}=[{\\bm{R}}_{1},{\\bm{p}}_{1}]} and 𝑻2=[𝑹2,𝒑2]subscript𝑻2subscript𝑹2subscript𝒑2{{\\bm{T}}_{2}=[{\\bm{R}}_{2},{\\bm{p}}_{2}]} in SE(333), consisting of a translational and rotational part, we choose the following distance on SE(333)\ndSE(3)​(𝑻1,𝑻2)=∥𝒑1−𝒑2∥22+∥LogMap​(𝑹1⊺​𝑹2)∥,subscript𝑑SE(3)subscript𝑻1subscript𝑻2superscriptsubscriptdelimited-∥∥subscript𝒑1subscript𝒑222delimited-∥∥LogMapsuperscriptsubscript𝑹1⊺subscript𝑹2d_{\\textsc{SE($3$)}}({\\bm{T}}_{1},{\\bm{T}}_{2})=\\lVert{\\bm{p}}_{1}-{\\bm{p}}_{2}\\rVert_{2}^{2}+\\lVert\\textrm{LogMap}({\\bm{R}}_{1}^{\\intercal}{\\bm{R}}_{2})\\rVert,\nwhere LogMap​(⋅)LogMap⋅\\textrm{LogMap}(\\cdot) is the operator that maps an element of SO(333) to its tangent space . Then, given the current end-effector pose 𝑻​(𝒒)𝑻𝒒{\\bm{T}}({\\bm{q}}) computed via forward kinematics and the goal pose 𝑻gsubscript𝑻𝑔{\\bm{T}}_{g}, the end-effector cost is Gaussian Process Cost. The uncontrolled trajectory distribution can be represented as the zero-mean GP prior   qF​(𝝉)=𝒩​(𝝉;𝟎,𝑲)subscript𝑞𝐹𝝉𝒩𝝉0𝑲q_{F}({\\bm{\\tau}})=\\mathcal{N}(\\bm{\\tau};\\bm{0},{\\bm{K}}), with a constant time discretization Δ​tΔ𝑡\\Delta t, and time-correlated covariance matrix 𝑲=[𝑲​(i,j)]|i​j,0≤i,j≤H−1,𝑲​(i,j)∈ℝd×dformulae-sequence𝑲evaluated-atdelimited-[]𝑲𝑖𝑗formulae-sequence𝑖𝑗0𝑖𝑗𝐻1𝑲𝑖𝑗superscriptℝ𝑑𝑑{{\\bm{K}}=[{\\bm{K}}(i,j)]\\big{|}_{ij,0\\leq i,j\\leq H-1},\\,{\\bm{K}}(i,j)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times d}}.\nWe can factorize the GP prior by following , i.e., with each binary GP factor defined as with 𝚽t,t+1subscript𝚽𝑡𝑡1\\mathbf{\\Phi}_{t,t+1} the state transition matrix, and 𝐐t,t+1subscript𝐐𝑡𝑡1\\mathbf{Q}_{t,t+1} the covariance between time steps t𝑡t and t+1𝑡1t+1. In this work, we assume a holonomic system model and the state transition and covariance matrices are respectively, with 𝐐csubscript𝐐𝑐\\mathbf{Q}_{c} the power-spectral density matrix.\nVia the planning-as-inference perspective, the GP cost is In essence, this cost promotes dynamic feasibility and smoothness. More details on GP priors can be found in . Note that we can introduce further costs, such as manipulability, depending on task requirements.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: In practice, this is implemented by hard setting the initial and final configurations of the trajectory as in lines 1 and 1 of Algorithm 1 [ref]38.\nIf the generative model does not support Dirac delta distributions, this cost can also be formulated as a quadratic cost, e.g. for the start state\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
