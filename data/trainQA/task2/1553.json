      "content": "Paper Title: Transformer Based Deliberation for Two-Pass Speech Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEnd-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) has made rapid progress in recent years    [ref]4   [ref]7.\nRepresentative models include streaming models such as the recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) , attention-based models   , and transformer-based models  0 1 2.\nCompared to sophisticated conventional models 3 4, E2E models such as RNN-T and Listen, Attend and Spell (LAS) have shown competitive performance   [ref]7 5. To further improve recognition accuracy, a two-pass LAS rescoring model has been proposed in 6, which uses a non-streaming LAS decoder to rescore the RNN-T hypotheses. The rescorer attends to audio encoding from the encoder to re-rank the first-pass hypotheses. [ref]7 shows that by using an RNN-T model which is capable of endpointing based on an end-of-query token, LAS rescoring can outperform a large conventional model 3 in both latency and word error rate (WER). Recently, deliberation network 7 has been proposed for second-pass rescoring 8 and achieved state-of-the-art WER on Google Voice Search (VS). By using multi-source attention in a LAS decoder, deliberation attends to both encoder outputs and first-pass hypotheses for rescoring. For comparison, LAS rescoring only attends to encoder outputs for rescoring 6 [ref]7, and neural correction models post-process hypotheses using only text hypotheses or lattice 9 0 1. While long short-term memory (LSTM) has been a popular building block for E2E models, there has been a continuing success in applying transformer models 2 in ASR 3 1 0  4 5 [ref]4. Instead of using a recurrent mechanism to model temporal dynamics, the transformer uses multi-headed attention to associate sequential elements in one step. 3 1 incorporate transformer layers to conventional models for acoustic modeling. For E2E models, the transformer has been adapted or applied to streaming models 0  2 and non-streaming models [ref]4. Comparative studies 6 [ref]4 show that transformer-based models outperform their recurrent neural network (RNN) counterparts in a number of tasks. Transformers have also been applied in post-processing for E2E models. 5 5 use transformer for spelling correction.  4 applies transformer decoder in second-pass rescoring. The non-autoregressive nature of a transformer layer enables token-level parallel rescoring, i.e., the rescoring of one token in a sequence does not depend on the previous one. This can significantly reduce latency on a matrix computation friendly hardware such as Tensor Processing Units (TPU). In this work, we develop a transformer-based deliberation rescorer, which is more TPU friendly than its LSTM counterpart 8. We use a transformer decoder in the second pass rescoring, i.e., the first-pass RNN-T model generates first-pass hypotheses, and then we use a transformer decoder to rescore the first-pass hypotheses. In rescoring, the transformer “encoder-decoder” attention attends to two sources: Encoder outputs and first-pass hypothesis encoding. The resultant context vectors are then combined by a merger layer to produce a new context vector that has the same dimension as the output from the previous self-attention layer. Our model is different from transformer rescoring 4 where the decoder only attends to the encoder outputs. As in 8, our model encodes first-pass hypotheses bidirectionally to model context. When encoding multiple hypotheses, we model the hypothesis order (i.e., rank in the n-best list) using a learned embedding 7 and add that to the embedding of wordpiece tokens in the corresponding hypothesis. We note that the wordpiece-based 8 sequences are usually short for VS queries, and computation can be paralleled to improve latency. We conduct experiments on the same training data as in 9 8 0, which is from multiple domains including Voice Search, YouTube, Telephony such as SwitchBoard 1 and Fisher 2, etc. We researched different types of merge layer, i.e., sum, concatenation, attention or gated averaging, to combine the attention vectors from encoder outputs and first-pass hypothesis encoding, and find sum is a more effective and efficient method. Similar to the previous study 8, we observe that using multiple RNN-T hypotheses, additional encoder (AE) layers, and minimum WER (MWER) training 3 improves WER. Order embedding and joint training further improve WER. In summary, our best proposed transformer deliberation rescorer achieves 7% WER reduction compared to the best LSTM-based deliberation 8 for VS and proper noun recognition, and reduces computation by 38% relative. Compared to non-deliberation transformer rescoring 4, our deliberation rescorer shows 9% and 11% relative improvement. To achieve a tradeoff between WER and computation, we explore reducing the model complexity by encoding a single hypotheses for deliberation, and achieves 4% and 8% WER reduction for VS and proper noun recognition, respectively, by using 1.25 times computation of 4.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: End-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) has made rapid progress in recent years    [ref]4   [ref]7.\nRepresentative models include streaming models such as the recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) , attention-based models   , and transformer-based models  0 1 2.\nCompared to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
