      "content": "Paper Title: Fast Multi-Resolution Transformer Fine-tuning for Extreme Multi-label Text Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMany real-world applications such as open-domain question\nanswering [ref]1 , e-commerce dynamic search\nadvertising  [ref]4, and semantic matching , can be formulated as an\nextreme multi-label text classification (XMC) problem: given a text input,\npredict relevant labels from an enormous label collection of size L𝐿L.\nIn these applications, L𝐿L ranges from tens of thousands to millions, which\nmakes it very challenging to design XMC models that are\nboth accurate and efficient to train. Recent works such as\nParabel , Bonsai ,\nXR-Linear  and AttentionXML [ref]8,\nexploit the correlations among the labels to generate label partitions or\nhierarchical label trees (HLTs) which can be used to shortlist candidate\nlabels to be considered during training and inference. While these methods are scalable in\nterms of the size of the label collection, most of them rely only on statistical\nrepresentations (such as bag-of-words) or pooling from pre-generated token\nembeddings (such as word2vec) to vectorize text inputs. In light of the recent success of deep pretrained transformers models such as\nBERT , XLNet  and\nRoBerta  in various NLP applications,\nX-Transformer  and\nLightXML  propose to fine-tune pre-trained\ntransformer models on XMC tasks to obtain new state-of-the-art results over the\naforementioned approaches. Although transformers are able to better capture\nsemantic meaning of textual inputs than statistical representations, text\ntruncation is often needed in practice to reduce GPU memory footprint and\nmaintain model efficiency. For example, X-Transformer truncates input texts to\ncontain the first 128 tokens before feeding it into transformer models.\nEfficiency of transformer fine-tuning poses another challenge for XMC applications. Directly fine-tuning transformer models on the\noriginal XMC task with a very large label collection is infeasible as both\nthe training time and the memory consumption are linear in L𝐿L. In order to\nalleviate this, both X-Transformer and LightXML adopt a similar approach to\ngroup L𝐿L labels into K𝐾K clusters of roughly equal size denoted by B𝐵B and\nfine-tune transformers on the task to identify relevant label clusters (instead of\nlabels themselves). If B≈L𝐵𝐿B\\approx\\sqrt{L} and K≈L𝐾𝐿K\\approx\\sqrt{L}, then both the\ntraining time and the memory requirement of the fine-tuning can be reduced to\nO​(L)𝑂𝐿O(\\sqrt{L}) from O​(L)𝑂𝐿O(L). However, as pointed out\nin [ref]8, the model performance would deteriorate due to\nthe information loss from label aggregation.\nThus, both X-Transformer and LightXML still choose a small constant B𝐵B (\n≤100absent100\\leq 100) as the size of the label clusters. As a result, transformers are\nstill fine-tuned on a task with around L/100𝐿100L/100 clusters, which leads to\na much longer training time compared with non-transformer based models. For\nexample, it takes X-Transformer 23 and 25 days respectively to train on\nAmazon-3M and Wiki-500K even with 8 Nvidia V100 GPUs. To address these issues, we propose XR-Transformer, an XMC architecture that\nleverages pre-trained transformer models and has much smaller training cost\ncompared to other transformer-based XMC methods. Motivated by the\nmulti-resolution learning in image\ngeneration    and\ncurriculum learning , we formulate the XMC problem\nas a series of sub-problems with multi-resolution label signals and recursively\nfine-tune the pre-trained transformer on the coarse-to-fine objectives.\nIn this paper, our contributions are as follows:\n We propose XR-Transformer, a transformer based framework for extreme multi-label text\nclassification where the pre-trained transformer is recursively fine-tuned\non a series of easy-to-hard training objectives defined by a hierarchical\nlabel tree. This allows the transformers to be quickly fine-tuned for a\nXMC problem with a very large number label collection progressively. To get better text representation and mitigate the information loss in\ntext truncation for transformers, we take into account statistical text\nfeatures in addition to the transformer text embeddings in our model.\nAlso, a cost sensitive learning scheme by label aggregation is proposed to\nintroduce richer information on the coarsified labels. We conduct experiments on 6 public XMC benchmarking datasets and our\nmodel takes significantly lower training time compared to other\ntransformer-based XMC models to yield better state-of-the-art results. For\nexample, we improve the state-of-the-art Prec@1 result on Amazon-3M established by\nX-Transformer from 51.20% to 54.04% while reducing\nthe required training time from 23 days to 29 hours using the same hardware.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Many real-world applications such as open-domain question\nanswering [ref]1 , e-commerce dynamic search\nadvertising  [ref]4, and semantic matching , can be formulated as an\nextreme multi-label text classification (XMC) problem: given a text input,\npredict relevant\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
