      "content": "Paper Title: Runtime Complexity Analysis of Logically Constrained Rewriting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConsider the rewrite system ℛ1subscriptℛ1\\mathcal{R}_{1} from Ex. 1, and\na rewrite sequence starting with an instance of 𝗂𝗇𝗂𝗍​(x0,y0,z0)𝗂𝗇𝗂𝗍subscript𝑥0subscript𝑦0subscript𝑧0\\mathsf{init}(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0}).\nBelow we sketch the steps to obtain an upper bound on the runtime complexity of ℛ1subscriptℛ1\\mathcal{R}_{1}, expressed in |x0|subscript𝑥0|x_{0}|, |y0|subscript𝑦0|y_{0}|, and\n|z0|subscript𝑧0|z_{0}|, where |⋅||\\cdot| denotes the absolute value. An automated runtime complexity analysis of mergesort is notoriously difficult:\nFor this example, CoFloCo   can only derive a quadratic bound,\nwhile KoAT [ref]8 (as well as AProVE ) even proposes an exponential bound. PUBS  can produce an 𝒪​(n⋅log⁡(n))𝒪⋅𝑛𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n\\cdot\\log(n)) bound, using a special level-counting feature, which however negatively affects its overall success rate.\nDue to the work presented in this paper, our complexity analyser TCT can automatically\nprove the optimal 𝒪​(n⋅log⁡(n))𝒪⋅𝑛𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n\\cdot\\log(n)) upper bound. This is obtained by the following\nrecipe. We first compute dependency tuples of all rules to focus the\nanalysis on recursive calls (see Def. 4).\nThen a dependency graph approximation is computed\nto estimate computation paths, where the numbers refer to the\nrespective dependency tuples of rules in Ex. 1: Next, we derive bounds on the size of variables in left hand sides of rules, in\nterms of the sizes of the variables in the initial term 𝗂𝗇𝗂𝗍​(x0,y0,z0)𝗂𝗇𝗂𝗍subscript𝑥0subscript𝑦0subscript𝑧0\\mathsf{init}(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0}).\nFor example, it is easy to check that for rule (9), |x|𝑥|x|, |y|𝑦|y|, and |z|𝑧|z| are bounded by |x0|subscript𝑥0|x_{0}|, |y0|subscript𝑦0|y_{0}|, and |z0|subscript𝑧0|z_{0}|, respectively, and all variables in other rules are bounded by |x0|subscript𝑥0|x_{0}|. This is established by the size bounds processor (Lem. 3).\nFormally, we adapt techniques developed for ITSs for that purpose [ref]8. We first derive time bounds for the SCCs {2,4,8}248\\{2,4,8\\} and {6}6\\{6\\} separately (Lem. 2).\nThus, using the size bounds from above and suitable interpretations  (also called polynomial ranking functions [ref]8) for LCTRSs, one can derive linear runtime bounds 2​|x0|+12subscript𝑥012|x_{0}|+1 and |x0|subscript𝑥0|x_{0}| for these subproblems, respectively. In order to analyse the SCC {3,7,9}379\\{3,7,9\\}, we first apply chaining\nto combine rule (9) with (3) and (7), respectively (eliminating symbols 𝗆1subscript𝗆1\\mathsf{m}_{1} and 𝗆2subscript𝗆2\\mathsf{m}_{2}). With respect to the modified rule (9) and the derived subproblem bounds, we exploit the loop processor (Lem. 5) to observe that its runtime can thus be overestimated by the following recurrence\nequations. Solving the recurrences by the Master Theorem, implies an\noverall runtime complexity of 𝒪​(|x0|⋅log⁡(|x0|))𝒪⋅subscript𝑥0subscript𝑥0\\mathcal{O}(|x_{0}|\\cdot\\log(|x_{0}|)) for ℛ1subscriptℛ1\\mathcal{R}_{1}, as |x|𝑥|x| in rule (9) is bound by |x0|subscript𝑥0|x_{0}|. Wrt. ℛ2subscriptℛ2\\mathcal{R}_{2} from Ex. 2, we can fully automatically infer an\n(asymptotic) optimal linear bound on the runtime complexity for the given instantiation.\nHere, we take an instance of 𝗆𝖺𝗑​_​𝗅𝖾𝗇𝗀𝗍𝗁​(x​s,z,l)𝗆𝖺𝗑_𝗅𝖾𝗇𝗀𝗍𝗁𝑥𝑠𝑧𝑙\\mathsf{max\\_length}(xs,z,l) as initial term.\nAs for comparison, note that the corresponding logic program cannot be handled by a dedicated variant of\nAProVE  geared towards runtime complexity analysis of logic programs.\nOnly termination can be shown by the most recent version of AProVE .\nA priori, our approach is restricted to logic programs with\ninstantiation patterns that ensure determinism and avoid failure, but in\nthe conclusion we discuss how to overcome this limitation. Finally, Ex. 3 cannot yet be handled, as a successful analysis requires the extension of the\nproposed framework to (innermost) derivational complexity (i.e.,\nthe setting of arbitrary starting terms that may contain nested defined symbols).\nThis is subject to future work. However, we conceive\nthe work established in this paper as a solid first step towards the automated analysis of such systems.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: where |⋅||\\cdot| denotes the absolute value.
