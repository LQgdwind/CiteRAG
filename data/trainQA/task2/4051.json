The final feature map has the same spatial resolution as the original image and thus, retaining keypoint’s pixel level accuracy. Each pixel is represented by a descriptor vector of length c=128𝑐128c=128. Finally, to find correspondence sets between frames, descriptors are matched using cosine similarity.\nTo train C​o​n​t​r​a​F​e​a​t𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝐹𝑒𝑎𝑡ContraFeat network, we use synthetic data [ref]41(see Sec 6). Accordingly, keypoints are extracted using . Then, using known depth, pose and camera intrinsics, we collect ground-truth matches from corresponding 3D points and remove occluded points by filtering-out distant matches. Inspired by recent self-supervised learning methods based on contrastive losses [ref]35 [ref]38,\nwe use a loss similar to the InfoNCE loss  to train ContraFeat to learn discriminative representations of keypoints. The contrastive loss for an image pair (i,j)𝑖𝑗(i,j) and a correct match k𝑘k out of Mi,jsubscript𝑀𝑖𝑗M_{i,j} possible matches is given by where zimsubscriptsuperscript𝑧𝑚𝑖z^{m}_{i} and zjmsubscriptsuperscript𝑧𝑚𝑗z^{m}_{j} are descriptor vectors sampled at pixel coordinates k​pim𝑘subscriptsuperscript𝑝𝑚𝑖kp^{m}_{i} and k​pjm𝑘subscriptsuperscript𝑝𝑚𝑗kp^{m}_{j} in the feature map of images i𝑖i and j𝑗j, respectively. τ𝜏\\tau represents a temperature parameter. We enforce ∥zim∥2\\|{}z^{m}_{i}\\|{}_{2} = 1 via a L2-normalization layer. This loss is then averaged over all ground-truth matches.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: c=128𝑐128c=128.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
