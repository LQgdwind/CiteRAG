      "content": "Paper Title: Reinforcement Learning-based Dialogue Guided Event Extraction to Exploit Argument Relations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEvent extraction aims to detect, from the text, the occurrence of events of specific types and to extract arguments (e.g., typed event participants or other attributes) that are associated with an event . It is a fundamental technique underpinning many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks like knowledge reasoning , text summarization , and event prediction . Event extraction requires extracting all arguments and their roles corresponding to each event. Doing so is challenging because an event is often associated with more than one argument, whose role can vary in different contexts. For example, the argument ‚Äútroops‚Äù has different roles in multiple sentences, as shown in Fig.¬†1. This argument has the role of being the ‚Äútarget‚Äù in sentence S‚Äã1ùëÜ1S1, while in sentence S‚Äã2ùëÜ2S2, its role is the ‚Äúattacker‚Äù. In sentence S‚Äã3ùëÜ3S3, the argument ‚Äútroops‚Äù could be either the ‚Äútarget‚Äù or the ‚Äúattacker‚Äù.\nTo extract an event, we need to identify the argument role correctly. Failing to do so can lead to erroneous information propagation, affecting the recognition of other event arguments and sentence understanding. For example, incorrectly associating the ‚Äútroops‚Äù argument in the sentence S‚Äã2ùëÜ2S2 as the target will lead to misunderstanding of the sentence. Unfortunately, argument role detection remains an open problem because an argument can be associated with multiple roles. Our work aims to find new ways to identify event argument roles for event extraction. Our key insight is that multiple arguments associated with an event are typically strongly correlated. Their correlations can provide useful information for determining the role of an event argument. Consider again our example given earlier in Fig.¬†1. To determine the role of argument ‚Äútroops‚Äù in the sentence S‚Äã1ùëÜ1S1, we can consider its relevant arguments of ‚Äúweapons‚Äù and ‚Äúuse‚Äù. The roles and appearance order of ‚Äúweapons‚Äù and ‚Äúuse‚Äù suggest ‚Äútroops‚Äù is the target in the context. Although the argument ‚Äúuse‚Äù has many subtle roles, we can still attribute it with the ‚ÄúConflict: Attack‚Äù event type in sentence S‚Äã1ùëÜ1S1 by using ‚Äúweapons‚Äù as a hint. Moreover, the role of argument ‚Äútroops‚Äù can be recognized to role by looking at the argument ‚Äúweapons‚Äù and ‚Äúuse‚Äù. If the ‚Äútroops‚Äù is detected firstly, it may misidentify its argument role and other arguments. As can be seen from this representative example, the relation among arguments can help in inferring the argument roles that are essential for event extraction. However, prior work largely ignores such relations, leaving much room for improvement.\nMost existing methods extract all arguments simultaneously [ref]5  or individual arguments sequentially [ref]7, all of which do not consider the effect of argument extraction order.\nOur work seeks to close this gap by explicitly modeling the argument relation for event extraction. Our approach is enabled by the recent advance in task-oriented dialogue systems  [ref]9 that are shown to be highly effective in entity-relation extraction 0.\nA task-oriented dialogue system uses domain knowledge, e.g., knowledge structures of intentions extracted from sentences, to complete a specific task. The natural language understanding task is structured as many slots are to be filled, where each slot can take a set of possible values. For example, a travel query could be translated into a structure consisting of slots like original_city, destination_city, departure_time and arrival_time. The goal of the dialogue system in this context is thus to extract the right values from the user sentence to fill the slots. The recent progress in a task-oriented dialogue system allows one to effectively exploit the dialogue historical information to optimize slot filling with the right order 1 2 3. In this work, we formulate the event extraction task within a task-oriented dialogue system, as shown in Fig.¬†2. We consider the problem of event extraction as filling slots of relevant arguments and their roles extracted from the input sentence. To this end, we develop a multi-turn dialogue system [ref]9 with two agents to iteratively solve the slot filling problem. During each turn, one agent selects an argument role and generates a query through a dialogue generator. For example, the query for the role of ‚Äúinstrument‚Äù could be ‚ÄúWhat is the killing instrument of event Life: Die?‚Äù in Turn 3 of Fig.¬†2. The other agent answers the query by identifying the right argument or event type from the sentence. This iterative generation and answering paradigm enable us to introduce knowledge obtained from previous turns when extracting a current argument. For instance, it can exploit the argument relation like ‚Äúweapon‚Äù, ‚Äúuse‚Äù and ‚Äútroops‚Äù in sentence S‚Äã1ùëÜ1S1 in Fig.¬†1 to improve the quality of event extraction.\nOur dialogue-based method extracts the argument of victim ‚Äùsoldiers‚Äù according to the argument of trigger killing and instrument explosives for event Life: Die in Fig.¬†2.\nThis multi-turn process also enables us to leverage additional information about the newly extracted argument to update and correct the argument roles identified in the previous turn. As we repeat the process, we will obtain more information about event arguments and better understand the sentence over time. This richer information helps us extract argument roles more precisely towards the end of the process. While our multi-turn dialogue system provides a potentially powerful event extraction capability, its potential can only be fully unlocked if the arguments are processed in the right order. Since we extract arguments and determine their roles in sequential order by utilizing the knowledge obtained from previously extracted arguments, the order of argument extraction is crucial. Ideally, we would like to start from event arguments whose argument roles are likely to be accurately decided using already extracted information and leave the more challenging ones later once we have obtained sufficient information from others. For instance, we may wish to extract argument ‚Äúweapon‚Äù before ‚Äúuse‚Äù of sentence S‚Äã1ùëÜ1S1 given in Fig.¬†1 because determining the former‚Äôs role is more straightforward than doing that for the latter. We address the challenge of argument extraction order by employing Reinforcement Learning (RL) to rank arguments to best utilize the argument relation. To allow RL to navigate the potentially large problem space, we need to find the right representation of each word in the target sentence and use the representation to predict the start and end position of each argument.\nTo that end, we use both a lexicon-based graph attention network 4 and an event-based BERT model 5 for learning the word representation from semantics and context two perspectives.\nWe then utilize the learned representation to determine which argument to extract and in what order. We go further by designing an incremental learning strategy to iteratively incorporate the argument relation into the multi-turned event extraction process by continually updating the event representation across turns. By doing so, the representation becomes increasingly more accurate as the argument extraction process proceeds, which, in turn, enhances the quality of the resulting argument and event extraction. We evaluate our approach111Code and data are available at: https://github.com/xiaoqian19940510/TASLP-EAREE by applying it to sentence-level event extraction performed on the ACE 2005 dataset 6. We compare our approach to 7 recently proposed event extraction approaches [ref]5  7 8 9 [ref]7 0. Experimental results show that our approach can effectively utilize the argument relation to identify the argument roles, leading to better event extraction performance. We show that our incremental event learning strategy is particularly useful when the amount of labeled data is limited. This paper makes the following contributions. It is the first to: develop a multi-turned, task-oriented dialogue guided event extraction framework aiming to fill arguments extracted from input text for specific arguments roles (Section III); employ reinforcement learning to rank argument extraction order to utilize argument correlation for event extraction (Section III-B); leverage a lexicon-based graph attention network and event-based BERT, under an incremental learning framework to learn word representation for even extraction (Sections III-A);\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: roles that are essential for event extraction.
