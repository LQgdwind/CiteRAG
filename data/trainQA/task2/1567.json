      "content": "Paper Title: Generative deep learning for decision making in gas networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is concerned with the modelling and solving of problems from discrete optimisation. These problems can represent real-world scenarios, where discrete decisions can be appropriately captured and modelled by the integer variables. In real-world scenarios a MILP model is rarely solved only once. More frequently, the same model is used with varying data to describe different instances of the same problem which are solved on a regular basis. This holds true in particular for decision support systems, which can utilise MILP to provide real-time optimal decisions on a continual basis, see  and 0 for examples in nurse scheduling and vehicle routing. The MILPs that these decision support systems solve have identical structure due to both their underlying application and cyclical nature, and thus often have similar optimal solutions. Our aim is to exploit this repetitive structure, and create generative neural networks that generate binary decision encodings for subsets of important variables. These encodings can then be used in a primal heuristic by solving the induced sub-problem following variable fixations. Additionally, the then result of the primal heuristic can be used in a warm-start context to help improve solver performance in a globally optimal context. We demonstrate the performance of our neural network (NN) design on the transient gas optimisation problem , specifically on real-world instances embedded in day-ahead decision support systems. The design of our framework is inspired by the recent development of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [ref]17. Our design consists of two NNs, a Generator and a Discriminator. The Generator is responsible for generating the binary decision values, while the Discriminator is tasked with predicting the optimal objective function value of the MILP induced by fixing these binary variables to their generated values. Our NN design and its application to transient gas-network MILP formulations is an attempt to integrate Machine Learning (ML) into the MILP solving process. This integration has recently received an increased focus 3  , which has been encouraged by the success of ML integration into other facets of combinatorial optimisation, see  for a thorough overview. Our contribution to this intersection of two fields is as follows: We introduce a new generative NN design for learning integer variables of parametric MILPs, which interacts with the MILP directly during training. We also apply our design to a much more difficult and convoluted problem than traditionally seen in similar papers, namely the transient gas transportation problem. This paper is to the best our knowledge the first successful implementation of ML applied to discrete control in gas-transport.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: , specifically on real-world instances embedded in day-ahead decision support systems.
