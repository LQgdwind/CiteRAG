      "content": "Paper Title: Query Adaptive Few-Shot Object Detection with Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHow do the graph convolutional layers help for FSOD? As shown in the Table 1 and Fig. 4, we analyze the impact of each component in our model. We first verify the effectiveness of the GCN layers.\nTo this end, we replace the GCN layers with fully-connected layers (MLP). Specifically, if we only consider a one-layer GCN, Eq. 4 becomes 𝒀=𝑨​𝑿​𝑾𝒀𝑨𝑿𝑾{\\boldsymbol{Y}}={\\boldsymbol{AXW}}, where 𝑨𝑨{\\boldsymbol{A}} is the adjacency matrix, and 𝑾𝑾{\\boldsymbol{W}} is the learnable parameter. Notice that the MLP baseline shares the same structure as GCN except that we remove the adjacency matrix 𝑨𝑨{\\boldsymbol{A}}. In other words, the MLP can be formulated as 𝒀=𝑿​𝑾𝒀𝑿𝑾{\\boldsymbol{Y}}={\\boldsymbol{XW}}. Compared with the GCN layer, the MLP baseline only uses self-connected edges in the graph, and as a result, each node updates its features independently. Comparing the MLP baseline in Table 1 (b) with the vanilla baseline model in Table 1 (a) and our heterogeneous GCNs in Table 1 (g), we can conclude that the additional learnable modules are useful, and the message passing among different nodes in the graph is crucial for the final performance. How do the three types of edges help for FSOD? We then analyze the roles of the three types of edges in our heterogeneous graph. Firstly, we experiment on using only one type of edges as shown in Table 1 (c-e). We notice that all three types of edges can improve the baseline model’s performance in Table 1 (b). This demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-class modeling, class-proposal mutual adaptation, and learning context-aware proposal features in our model. Among all three types of edges, we observe that the class-proposal edge is the most important. This is because the objective of FSOD is to calculate the similarity score between the proposal feature and class prototype, thereby preferring that both sides adapt to each other. By further adding proposal-proposal edges, we obtain the full Intra-Class Subgraph, which, as shown in Table 1 (f), further improves the performance owing to context-aware proposal features. Finally, our full model, shown in Table 1 (g), achieves the best results after introducing the Inter-Class Subgraph. The effectiveness of meta-learning and fine-tuning. We show the comparison results between meta-training-only and fine-tuning in Table 1 (g) and (h). We find that fine-tuning improves the performance in 10/30 shot settings. However, when examples are extremely scarce, e.g., 2-shot as in Table 1, the performance hardly improves as fine-tuning tends to over-fit with small samples. This demonstrates the strong generalization ability of our meta-learning-based model, and fine-tuning needs large number of samples to perform well. The roles of local and global context in the proposal-proposal edge. We show the ablation study of using local and global context in Table 2. We find that both local and global contextual information contributes to the model’s performance. Local context can provide missing features and help refine bounding boxes, especially when proposals are not accurate. Global scene-context, on the other hand, can provide complementary information from the global view. Using both context produces the best results. The efficacy of the bidirectional class-proposal edge. We show in Table 3 the results of using bidirectional class-proposal edges against using solely uni-directional edges. We observe that the model with mutual adaptation achieves better results than with any of the two types of uni-directional edges. The comparison between the class-proposal edge and non-local attention in [ref]14. We compare our proposed method with Hsieh et al.’s work [ref]14 in Table 3. Hsieh et al. [ref]14 proposes to use non-local attention (a.k.a co-attention) between the query image and the support image for feature enhancement. To compare its performance with our class-proposal edge, we use the official codebase of [ref]14 and perform training/testing in our FSOD pipeline. Our model outperforms Hsieh et al.’s method [ref]14 significantly. The main difference is that in [ref]14, each ‘pixel’ in the feature maps is regarded as a basic unit for co-attention. In contrast, the category-specific proposal is used as the basic node in our model. Compared with the ‘pixels’ in the feature maps used in [ref]14, the category-specific proposals could provide richer semantics related to the target object in the query image, and therefore are more suitable for mutual adaptation. The advantage of using base class memory in the Inter-Class Subgraph. We show in Table 6 the results of using different numbers of base classes in our Inter-Class Subgraph. If we only use novel classes, the model gains little advantage from multi-class modeling. However, the Inter-Class Subgraph sees massive improvement when introduced with all base-class prototypes, which could enhance novel-class prototypes with more robust features from base classes. In practice, we deploy all 60 base classes by default in our Inter-Class Subgraph. \n\n\n\n\nClass-class\nClass-proposal\nProposal-proposal\n2-shot\n10-shot\n30-shot\n\n\nAP\nAP50\nAP75\nAP\nAP50\nAP75\nAP\nAP50\nAP75\n\nMeta-training the model on base classes, and meta-testing on novel classes\n\n(a)\nw/o heterogeneous GCNs\n5.4\n11.6\n4.6\n7.6\n15.4\n6.8\n8.9\n17.8\n8.0\n\n(b)\nUsing MLP instead of GCN layers (only self-connected edges)\n5.9\n12.5\n5.1\n8.4\n17.0\n7.6\n9.8\n20.3\n8.8\n\n(c)\n✓\n\n\n6.3\n13.3\n5.5\n9.0\n17.7\n8.1\n10.6\n20.9\n9.6\n\n(d)\n\n✓\n\n7.6\n16.0\n6.5\n9.8\n19.7\n8.8\n11.2\n22.8\n10.1\n\n(e)\n\n\n✓\n6.7\n14.0\n5.8\n9.3\n18.5\n8.3\n10.8\n21.5\n9.7\n\n(f)\n\n✓\n✓\n7.6\n16.2\n6.5\n10.0\n20.1\n8.9\n11.3\n23.1\n10.1\n\n(g)\n✓\n✓\n✓\n7.8\n16.4\n6.6\n10.2\n20.4\n9.0\n11.5\n23.4\n10.3\n\nFine-tuning the model on novel classes, and testing on novel classes\n\n(h)\n✓\n✓\n✓\n7.6\n16.1\n6.2\n11.6\n23.9\n9.8\n16.5\n31.9\n15.5\n\n \n\n\n\nLocal\nGlobal\n2-shot\n10-shot\n\nAP\nAP50\nAP75\nAP\nAP50\nAP75\n\n\n\n✓\n\n6.6\n13.8\n5.7\n9.0\n17.9\n8.1\n\n\n✓\n6.4\n13.2\n5.7\n9.1\n17.9\n8.2\n\n✓\n✓\n6.7\n14.0\n5.8\n9.3\n18.5\n8.3\n\n \n\n\n\nModel\n2-shot\n10-shot\n\nAP\nAP50\nAP75\nAP\nAP50\nAP75\n\n\n\nclass→→\\rightarrowproposal\n6.4\n13.2\n5.9\n8.6\n17.1\n7.9\n\nclass←←\\leftarrowproposal\n7.2\n15.7\n5.7\n9.4\n19.1\n8.6\n\nclass↔↔\\leftrightarrowproposal\n7.6\n16.0\n6.5\n9.8\n19.7\n8.8\n\nNon-local attention [ref]14\n6.0\n12.8\n5.3\n8.3\n17.3\n7.4\n\n \n\n\n\n#GCN Layer\n2-shot\n10-shot\n\nAP\nAP50\nAP75\nAP\nAP50\nAP75\n\n1 w/ W\n5.0\n10.4\n4.3\n7.2\n14.2\n6.5\n\n\n\n1 w/o W\n6.3\n13.3\n5.5\n9.0\n17.7\n8.1\n\n2 w/o W\n6.1\n13.0\n5.3\n8.8\n17.6\n8.0\n\n3 w/o W\n5.8\n12.2\n4.9\n8.6\n17.3\n7.8\n\n \n\n\n\n#GCN Layer\n2-shot\n10-shot\n\nAP\nAP50\nAP75\nAP\nAP50\nAP75\n\n1 w/o W\n7.2\n15.6\n6.0\n9.4\n19.3\n8.4\n\n\n\n1 w/ W\n7.6\n16.2\n6.5\n10.0\n20.1\n8.9\n\n2 w/ W\n7.4\n15.9\n6.3\n9.8\n19.7\n8.8\n\n3 w/ W\n6.9\n14.5\n5.5\n9.2\n18.6\n8.1\n\n \n\n\n\n#Base Classes\n2-shot\n10-shot\n\nAP\nAP50\nAP75\nAP\nAP50\nAP75\n\n\n\n0\n6.0\n12.8\n5.1\n8.5\n17.0\n7.7\n\n20\n6.1\n13.1\n5.2\n8.6\n17.3\n7.7\n\n40\n6.3\n13.4\n5.4\n8.9\n17.5\n8.0\n\n60\n6.3\n13.3\n5.5\n9.0\n17.7\n8.1\n\n The analysis on different numbers of GCN layers in the Inter-Class and the Intra-Class Subgraphs. We show in Table 4 and 5 the results of applying different numbers of GCN layers in the two Subgraphs.\n(1) We first emphasize that proposal and class nodes should go through the same number of transformation layers in a siamese network before the final pairwise matching.\nIf we learn W𝑊W for the inter-class subgraph, the few-shot classes would have one more learnable layer than the proposals, and we show in Table 4 that the performance is worse. But for intra-class subgraphs, the GCN layers are applied to both proposals and few-shot classes. As shown in Table 5, learning W𝑊W does not violate the siamese structure, and could help improve performance.\n(2) As shown in both Table 4 and 5, using one GCN layer is sufficient in both subgraphs as we already connect edges to all neighbors that a node needs in our model.\nUsing more GCN layers are not helpful due to the over-smoothing problem  in GCNs. \n\n\n\nMethod / Shot\nVenue\nBackbone\nNovel Set 1\nNovel Set 2\nNovel Set 3\n\n1\n2\n3\n5\n10\n1\n2\n3\n5\n10\n1\n2\n3\n5\n10\n\nMeta-training the model on base classes, and meta-testing on novel classes\n\nFan et al. [ref]3†\nCVPR 2020\nResNet-101\n32.4\n22.1\n23.1\n31.7\n35.7\n14.8\n18.1\n24.4\n18.6\n19.5\n25.8\n20.9\n23.9\n27.8\n29.0\n\nQA-FewDet (Ours)\nThis work\nResNet-101\n41.0\n33.2\n35.3\n47.5\n52.0\n23.5\n29.4\n37.9\n35.9\n37.1\n33.2\n29.4\n37.6\n39.8\n41.5\n\nFine-tuning the model on novel classes, and testing on novel classes\n\nFSRW \nICCV 2019\nYOLOv2\n14.8\n15.5\n26.7\n33.9\n47.2\n15.7\n15.3\n22.7\n30.1\n40.5\n21.3\n25.6\n28.4\n42.8\n45.9\n\nMetaDet \nICCV 2019\nVGG16\n18.9\n20.6\n30.2\n36.8\n49.6\n21.8\n23.1\n27.8\n31.7\n43.0\n20.6\n23.9\n29.4\n43.9\n44.1\n\nMeta R-CNN \nICCV 2019\nResNet-101\n19.9\n25.5\n35.0\n45.7\n51.5\n10.4\n19.4\n29.6\n34.8\n45.4\n14.3\n18.2\n27.5\n41.2\n48.1\n\nTFA w/ fc [ref]37\nICML 2020\nResNet-101\n36.8\n29.1\n43.6\n55.7\n57.0\n18.2\n29.0\n33.4\n35.5\n39.0\n27.7\n33.6\n42.5\n48.7\n50.2\n\nTFA w/ cos [ref]37\nICML 2020\nResNet-101\n39.8\n36.1\n44.7\n55.7\n56.0\n23.5\n26.9\n34.1\n35.1\n39.1\n30.8\n34.8\n42.8\n49.5\n49.8\n\nXiao et al. \nECCV 2020\nResNet-101\n24.2\n35.3\n42.2\n49.1\n57.4\n21.6\n24.6\n31.9\n37.0\n45.7\n21.2\n30.0\n37.2\n43.8\n49.6\n\nMPSR \nECCV 2020\nResNet-101\n41.7\n42.5\n51.4\n55.2\n61.8\n24.4\n29.3\n39.2\n39.9\n47.8\n35.6\n41.8\n42.3\n48.0\n49.7\n\nFan et al. [ref]3 †\nCVPR 2020\nResNet-101\n37.8\n43.6\n51.6\n56.5\n58.6\n22.5\n30.6\n40.7\n43.1\n47.6\n31.0\n37.9\n43.7\n51.3\n49.8\n\nQA-FewDet (Ours)\nThis work\nResNet-101\n42.4\n51.9\n55.7\n62.6\n63.4\n25.9\n37.8\n46.6\n48.9\n51.1\n35.2\n42.9\n47.8\n54.8\n53.5\n\n \n\n\n\n\n1-shot\n2-shot\n3-shot\n5-shot\n10-shot\n30-shot\n\nMethod\nAP\nAP50\nAP75\nAP\nAP50\nAP75\nAP\nAP50\nAP75\nAP\nAP50\nAP75\nAP\nAP50\nAP75\nAP\nAP50\nAP75\n\nMeta-training the model on base classes, and meta-testing on novel classes\n\nFan et al. [ref]3†\n4.0\n8.5\n3.5\n5.4\n11.6\n4.6\n5.9\n12.5\n5.0\n6.9\n14.3\n6.0\n7.6\n15.4\n6.8\n8.9\n17.8\n8.0\n\nQA-FewDet (Ours)\n5.1\n10.5\n4.5\n7.8\n16.4\n6.6\n8.6\n17.7\n7.5\n9.5\n19.3\n8.5\n10.2\n20.4\n9.0\n11.5\n23.4\n10.3\n\nFine-tuning the model on novel classes, and testing on novel classes\n\n\nFSRW \n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n –\n–\n–\n5.6\n12.3\n4.6\n9.1\n19.0\n7.6\n\nMetaDet \n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n –\n–\n–\n7.1\n14.6\n6.1\n11.3\n21.7\n8.1\n\nMeta R-CNN \n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n –\n–\n–\n8.7\n19.1\n6.6\n12.4\n25.3\n10.8\n\nTFA w/ fc [ref]37\n2.9\n5.7\n2.8\n4.3\n8.5\n4.1\n6.7\n12.6\n6.6\n8.4\n16.0\n8.4\n10.0\n19.2\n9.2\n13.4\n24.7\n13.2\n\nTFA w/ cos [ref]37\n3.4\n5.8\n3.8\n4.6\n8.3\n4.8\n6.6\n12.1\n6.5\n8.3\n15.3\n8.0\n10.0\n19.1\n9.3\n13.7\n24.9\n13.4\n\nXiao et al. ‡\n3.2\n8.9\n1.4\n4.9\n13.3\n2.3\n6.7\n18.6\n2.9\n8.1\n20.1\n4.4\n10.7\n25.6\n6.5\n15.9\n31.7\n15.1\n\nMPSR  †\n2.3\n4.1\n2.3\n3.5\n6.3\n3.4\n5.2\n9.5\n5.1\n6.7\n12.6\n6.4\n9.8\n17.9\n9.7\n14.1\n25.4\n14.2\n\nFan et al. [ref]3†\n4.2\n9.1\n3.0\n5.6\n14.0\n3.9\n6.6\n15.9\n4.9\n8.0\n18.5\n6.3\n9.6\n20.7\n7.7\n13.5\n28.5\n11.7\n\nQA-FewDet (Ours)\n4.9\n10.3\n4.4\n7.6\n16.1\n6.2\n8.4\n18.0\n7.3\n9.7\n20.3\n8.6\n11.6\n23.9\n9.8\n16.5\n31.9\n15.5\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: that the model with mutual adaptation achieves better results than with any of the two types of uni-directional edges.
