      "content": "Paper Title: Universal Deep Image Compression via Content-Adaptive Optimization with Adapters\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImage compression is a fundamental technology for reducing the costs of storage and network transmission.\nCompressed images are ubiquitous—digital cameras and smartphones compress images.\nThe common compression standard is JPEG , whereas JPEG2000 , BPG , and VVC  are more recent standard-based compression.\nDeep image compression is the image compression technique based on neural networks.\nRecent studies have demonstrated that deep image compression exhibits higher performance than conventional codecs on natural images   . However, deep image compression is learning-based.\nTherefore, we encounter the problem of performance degradation in compressing out-of-domain images.\nGeneral compression models pre-trained only on natural images exhibit relatively low performance on images in other domains, as shown in Fig. 1.\nTo investigate this problem, we address a novel deep image compression task, which we name universal deep image compression.\nThe objective of universal deep image compression is to compress images from arbitrary domains, such as line drawings and comics, as well as natural images. We propose a content-adaptive optimization framework to address the problem of compressing out-of-domain images.\nThis framework adapts the pre-trained compression model to each target image and addresses domain shifts between pre-training and testing.\nOur framework is efficient owing to a small number of parameters needed for the per-image adaptation during testing. Our framework has two advantages over previous approaches studied in content-adaptive compression  [ref]30  [ref]48  [ref]56: the flexibility of the base network architecture and the efficiency in terms of rate-distortion.\nIn content-adaptive compression, certain studies adapted the compression model during testing by refining the latent representation extracted by the encoder  .\nOther studies additionally updated the parameters in the decoder and transmitted these [ref]30  [ref]48  [ref]56.\nHowever, the state-of-the-art latent refinement method  has restrictions on pre-trained compression models: it assumes that the hyper latent representation follows a Gaussian distribution to perform the bit-back coding  .\nMoreover, previous approaches for updating the parameters in the decoder update an excessive number of parameters for an individual image  [ref]48, insert and train ad-hoc layers [ref]56, or optimize parameters only in terms of distortion  [ref]56. In our framework, we refine the latent representation by the simplified approach of the state-of-the-art refinement method.\nWe omit the process of bit-back coding and only optimize the latent representation in terms of rate-distortion with gradient descent.\nTherefore, our latent refinement is efficient and flexible to the base network architecture. To update the decoder, we insert adapters into the decoder and train these.\nAdapters are small modules with a small number of parameters and have been successful in parameter-efficient transfer learning    .\nUsing adapters, we can improve the compression performance by updating a relatively small number of parameters.\nMoreover, we optimize adapters in terms of rate-distortion with gradient descent.\nTherefore, our decoder update is efficient in terms of rate-distortion. To evaluate our framework, we construct a benchmark dataset that comprises four domains: natural images, line drawings, comics, and vector arts.\nWe sample natural images from the Kodak dataset  and images in the other three domains from the BAM dataset .\nWe use one of the state-of-the-art compression models (window attention-based convolutional neural networks (WACNN) )\nfor the baseline, and modify it by inserting adapters and optimizing the latent representation and the adapter parameters.\nWe pre-train the model on a natural image dataset and evaluate its performance on in-domain and out-of-domain images. The main contributions of this study are as follows We address universal deep image compression. To our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses the deep compression of images in arbitrary domains, such as line drawings and comics. We propose a content-adaptive optimization framework, wherein we adapt a pre-trained model to each target image. Our framework refines the latent representation by a simplified approach of the state-of-the-art method. We then train adapters inserted into the decoder via optimization in terms of rate-distortion. The adapter parameters are additionally transmitted. We demonstrate experimentally that the proposed method is effective and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art conventional codec on the four domains.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: efficient owing to a small number of parameters needed for the per-image adaptation during testing.
