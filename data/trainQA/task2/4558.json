      "content": "Paper Title: On The Complexity of Distance-𝑑 Independent Set Reconfiguration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, reconfiguration problems have attracted the attention from both theoretical and practical viewpoints.\nThe input of a reconfiguration problem consists of two feasible solutions of some source problem (e.g., Satisfiability, Independent Set, Vertex Cover, Dominating Set, etc.) and a reconfiguration rule that describes an adjacency relation between solutions.\nOne of the primary goal is to decide whether one feasible solution can be transformed into the other via a sequence of adjacent feasible solutions where each intermediate member is obtained from its predecessor by applying the given reconfiguration rule exactly once.\nSuch a sequence, if exists, is called a reconfiguration sequence.\nIn general, the (huge) set of all feasible solutions is not given, and one can verify in polynomial time (with respect to the input’s size) the feasibility and adjacency of solutions.\nAnother way of looking at reconfiguration problems involves the so-called reconfiguration graphs—a graph whose vertices/nodes are feasible solutions and their adjacency relation is defined via the given reconfiguration rule.\nNaturally, a reconfiguration sequence is nothing but a walk in the corresponding reconfiguration graph.\nReaders may recall the classic Rubik’s cube puzzle as an example of a reconfiguration problem, where each configuration of the Rubik’s cube corresponds to a feasible solution, and two configurations (solutions) are adjacent if one can be obtained from the other by rotating a face of the cube by either 909090, 180180180, or 270270270 degrees.\nThe question is whether one can transform an arbitrary configuration to the one where each face of the cube has only one color.\nFor an overview of this research area, we refer readers to the surveys    . Reconfiguration problems involving vertex subsets (e.g., clique, independent set, vertex cover, dominating set, etc.) of a graph have been extensively considered in the literature.\nIn such problems, to make it more convenient for describing reconfiguration rules, one usually view a vertex subset of a graph as a set of tokens placed on its vertices.\nSome of the well-known reconfiguration rules in this setting are: Token Sliding (𝖳𝖲𝖳𝖲{\\mathsf{TS}}): a token can only move to one of the unoccupied adjacent vertices; Token Jumping (𝖳𝖩𝖳𝖩{\\mathsf{TJ}}): a token can move to any unoccupied vertex; and Token Addition/Removal (𝖳𝖠𝖱​(k)𝖳𝖠𝖱𝑘{\\mathsf{TAR}}(k)): a token can either be added to an unoccupied vertex or remove from an occupied one, such that the number of tokens is always (upper/lower) bounded by some given positive integer k𝑘k. Let G𝐺G be a simple, undirected graph.\nAn independent set of a graph G𝐺G is a set of pairwise non-adjacent vertices.\nThe Independent Set (MaxIS) problem, which asks if G𝐺G has an independent set of size at least some given positive integer k𝑘k, is one of the fundamental 𝙽𝙿𝙽𝙿{\\mathtt{NP}}-complete problems in the computational complexity theory .\nGiven an integer d≥2𝑑2d\\geq 2, a distance-d𝑑d independent set (also known as d𝑑d-scattered set\nor sometimes d𝑑d-independent set111In fact, the terminology d𝑑d-independent set is sometimes used to indicate a vertex subset such that any two members are of distance at least d+1𝑑1d+1 for d≥1𝑑1d\\geq 1.\nWe note that sometimes a d𝑑d-independent set is defined as a vertex subset S𝑆S such that the maximum degree of the subgraph induced by S𝑆S is at most d𝑑d.\nIn some other contexts, a d𝑑d-independent set is nothing but an independent set of size d𝑑d.) of G𝐺G is a set of vertices whose pairwise distance is at least d𝑑d.\nThis “distance-d𝑑d independent set” concept generalizes “independent set”: an independent set is also a distance-222 independent set but may not be a distance-d𝑑d independent set for d≥3𝑑3d\\geq 3.\nGiven a fixed integer d≥2𝑑2d\\geq 2, the Distance-d𝑑d Independent Set (MaxDd𝑑dIS) problem asks if there is a distance-d𝑑d independent set of G𝐺G whose size is at least some given positive integer k𝑘k.\nClearly, MaxD222IS is nothing but MaxIS.\nIt is known that MaxDd𝑑dIS is 𝙽𝙿𝙽𝙿{\\mathtt{NP}}-complete for every fixed d≥3𝑑3d\\geq 3 on general graphs  and even on regular bipartite graphs when d∈{3,4,5}𝑑345d\\in\\{3,4,5\\} .\nEto et al.  proved that MaxDd𝑑dIS is 𝙽𝙿𝙽𝙿{\\mathtt{NP}}-complete for every fixed d≥3𝑑3d\\geq 3 even for bipartite graphs and for planar bipartite graphs of maximum degree three.\nThey also proved that on chordal graphs, MaxDd𝑑dIS is in 𝙿𝙿{\\mathtt{P}} for any even d≥2𝑑2d\\geq 2 and remains 𝙽𝙿𝙽𝙿{\\mathtt{NP}}-complete for any odd d≥3𝑑3d\\geq 3.\nThe complexity of MaxDd𝑑dIS on several other graphs has also been studied  7 0.\nAdditionally, MaxDd𝑑dIS and its variants have been studied extensively from different viewpoints, including exact exponential algorithms , approximability [ref]6  0, and parameterized complexity . In this paper, we take MaxDd𝑑dIS as the source problem and initiate the study of Distance-d𝑑d Independent Set Reconfiguration (Dd𝑑dISR) from the computational complexity viewpoint.\nThe problem for d=2𝑑2d=2, which is usually known as the Independent Set Reconfiguration (ISR) problem, has been well-studied from both classic and parameterized complexity viewpoints.\nISR under 𝖳𝖲𝖳𝖲{\\mathsf{TS}} was first introduced by Hearn and Demaine .\nIto et al.  introduced and studied the problem under 𝖳𝖠𝖱𝖳𝖠𝖱{\\mathsf{TAR}} along with several other reconfiguration problems.\nUnder 𝖳𝖩𝖳𝖩{\\mathsf{TJ}}, the problem was first studied by Kamiński et al. .\nVery recently, the study of ISR on directed graphs has been initiated by Ito et al. .\nReaders are referred to   for a complete overview of recent developments regarding ISR.\nWe now briefly mention some known results regarding the computational complexity of ISR on different graph classes.\nISR remains 𝙿𝚂𝙿𝙰𝙲𝙴𝙿𝚂𝙿𝙰𝙲𝙴{\\mathtt{PSPACE}}-complete under any of 𝖳𝖲,𝖳𝖩,𝖳𝖠𝖱𝖳𝖲𝖳𝖩𝖳𝖠𝖱{\\mathsf{TS}},{\\mathsf{TJ}},{\\mathsf{TAR}} on general graphs , planar graphs of maximum degree three and bounded bandwidth  1 3 and perfect graphs .\nUnder 𝖳𝖲𝖳𝖲{\\mathsf{TS}}, the problem is 𝙿𝚂𝙿𝙰𝙲𝙴𝙿𝚂𝙿𝙰𝙲𝙴{\\mathtt{PSPACE}}-complete even on split graphs .\nInterestingly, on bipartite graphs, ISR under 𝖳𝖲𝖳𝖲{\\mathsf{TS}} is 𝙿𝚂𝙿𝙰𝙲𝙴𝙿𝚂𝙿𝙰𝙲𝙴{\\mathtt{PSPACE}}-complete while under any of 𝖳𝖩𝖳𝖩{\\mathsf{TJ}} and 𝖳𝖠𝖱𝖳𝖠𝖱{\\mathsf{TAR}} it is 𝙽𝙿𝙽𝙿{\\mathtt{NP}}-complete .\nOn the positive side, ISR under any of 𝖳𝖩𝖳𝖩{\\mathsf{TJ}} and 𝖳𝖠𝖱𝖳𝖠𝖱{\\mathsf{TAR}} is in 𝙿𝙿{\\mathtt{P}} on even-hole-free graphs  (which also contains chordal graphs, split graphs, interval graphs, trees, etc.), cographs 6, and claw-free graphs 2.\nISR under 𝖳𝖲𝖳𝖲{\\mathsf{TS}} is in 𝙿𝙿{\\mathtt{P}} on cographs , claw-free graphs 2, trees 8, bipartite permutation graphs and bipartite distance-hereditary graphs 9, and interval graphs 4 . Dd𝑑dISR for d≥3𝑑3d\\geq 3 was first studied by Siebertz 2 from the parameterized complexity viewpoint.\nMore precisely, in 2, Siebertz proved that Dd𝑑dISR under 𝖳𝖠𝖱𝖳𝖠𝖱{\\mathsf{TAR}} is in 𝙵𝙿𝚃𝙵𝙿𝚃{\\mathtt{FPT}} for every d≥2𝑑2d\\geq 2 on “nowhere dense graphs” (which generalized the previously known result for d=2𝑑2d=2 of Lokshtanov et al. 0) and it is 𝚆​𝚆delimited-[]1\\mathtt{W}-hard for some value of d≥2𝑑2d\\geq 2 on “somewhere dense graphs” that are closed under taking subgraphs. Since the 𝖳𝖩𝖳𝖩{\\mathsf{TJ}} and 𝖳𝖠𝖱𝖳𝖠𝖱{\\mathsf{TAR}} rules are somewhat equivalent , i.e., any 𝖳𝖩𝖳𝖩{\\mathsf{TJ}}-sequence between two size-k𝑘k token-sets can be converted into a 𝖳𝖠𝖱𝖳𝖠𝖱{\\mathsf{TAR}}-sequence between them whose members are token-sets of size at least k−1𝑘1k-1 and vice versa222They proved the result for ISR, but it is not hard to extend it for Dd𝑑dISR., in this paper, we consider Dd𝑑dISR (d≥3𝑑3d\\geq 3) under only 𝖳𝖲𝖳𝖲{\\mathsf{TS}} and 𝖳𝖩𝖳𝖩{\\mathsf{TJ}}.\nMost of our results are summarized in Table 1.\nIn short, we show the following results. It is worth noting that Even though it is well-known that MaxDd𝑑dIS on G𝐺G and MaxIS on its (d−1)𝑑1(d-1)th power (this concept will be defined later) are equivalent, this does not necessarily holds for their reconfiguration variants. (Section 3.1.) The definition of Dd𝑑dIS implies the triviality of Dd𝑑dISR for large enough d𝑑d on graphs whose (connected) components’ diameters are bounded by some constant, including cographs and split graphs.\n(Section 3.2.) On chordal graphs and split graphs, there are some interesting complexity dichotomies.\n(Section 4.) Under 𝖳𝖩𝖳𝖩{\\mathsf{TJ}} on chordal graphs, Dd𝑑dISR is in 𝙿𝙿{\\mathtt{P}} for even d𝑑d and 𝙿𝚂𝙿𝙰𝙲𝙴𝙿𝚂𝙿𝙰𝙲𝙴{\\mathtt{PSPACE}}-complete for odd d𝑑d. On split graphs, Dd𝑑dISR under 𝖳𝖲𝖳𝖲{\\mathsf{TS}} is 𝙿𝚂𝙿𝙰𝙲𝙴𝙿𝚂𝙿𝙰𝙲𝙴{\\mathtt{PSPACE}}-complete for d=2𝑑2d=2  but in 𝙿𝙿{\\mathtt{P}} for d=3𝑑3d=3.\nUnder 𝖳𝖩𝖳𝖩{\\mathsf{TJ}}, it is in 𝙿𝙿{\\mathtt{P}} for d=2𝑑2d=2  but 𝙿𝚂𝙿𝙰𝙲𝙴𝙿𝚂𝙿𝙰𝙲𝙴{\\mathtt{PSPACE}}-complete for d=3𝑑3d=3. There is a proof of the 𝙿𝚂𝙿𝙰𝙲𝙴𝙿𝚂𝙿𝙰𝙲𝙴{\\mathtt{PSPACE}}-hardness of Dd𝑑dISR on general graphs under 𝖳𝖩𝖳𝖩{\\mathsf{TJ}} for d≥3𝑑3d\\geq 3\nwhich is not a direct extension of the corresponding result by Ito et al.  for d=2𝑑2d=2.\n(Section 5.)\nAdditionally, several known results for d=2𝑑2d=2, including the one by Ito et al., can be extended for d≥3𝑑3d\\geq 3.\n(Section 6.)\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: other graphs has also been studied  7 0.\nAdditionally, MaxDd𝑑dIS and its variants have been studied extensively from different viewpoints, including exact exponential algorithms , approximability [ref]6  0, and parameterized complexity .
