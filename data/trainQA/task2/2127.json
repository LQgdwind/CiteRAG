      "content": "Paper Title: Reinforced Few-Shot Acquisition Function Learning for Bayesian Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBayesian optimization via myopic AFs.\nIn BO, AFs are usually designed to reflect the trade-off between exploration and exploitation of the global optima through maximizing some cheap-to-evaluate myopic objective, which typically corresponds an one-step look-ahead strategy.\nSuch AFs have been designed from various perspectives on how to address the trade-off.\nFor instance, under GP-UCB, AF is designed from the perspective of optimism in the face of uncertainty .\nUnder EI, AF incorporates the expected one-step improvement in terms of the best observation made so far by design  [ref]14.\nSimilarly, under the knowledge gradient method [ref]39, AF is chosen to be the expected improvement in the largest posterior mean over the input domain.\nInstead of using the expected improvement, PI  uses the tail probability of improvement as the AF for BO.\nUnder entropy search methods, AF is the expected reduction in the uncertainty of the global optima  [ref]11 .\nUnder Thompson sampling, AF values are directly drawn from the posterior predictive distribution .\nAs the AFs are often handcrafted according to different perspectives of the exploration-exploitation trade-off, the performance of an AF can vary significantly under different types of black-box functions [ref]11.\nThus, designing an AF that can adapt and demonstrate outstanding performance to a wide variety of black-box functions remains a critical challenge.\nThis is the goal of our paper: we propose a reinforced few-shot learning framework, in which an initial AF is learned with fast adaption to various black-box functions given a limited number of samples (e.g., 1-shot). Bayesian optimization via non-myopic methods.\nTo go beyond myopic AFs, recently there has been some interest in designing non-myopic strategies for BO from the perspective of dynamic programming (DP).\nFor example,   characterized the optimal non-myopic strategies for BO.\nTo tackle the intractable DP problem,   proposed to approximately solve the DP problem for BO by different simulation techniques.\n focused on the two-step lookahead AFs for BO and proposed an efficient Monte-Carlo method to find such AFs.\nInstead of fixing the horizon in advance,  proposed a principled way to select the rolling horizon for approximate dynamic programming in BO.\n proposed to achieve non-myopia by maximizing a lower bound on the multi-step expected utility.\n proposed a tree-based AF to enable approximate multi-step lookahead in a one-shot manner by leveraging the reparameterization trick.\nThe proposed FSAF is also non-myopic by nature as it implicitly takes multi-step effect into account by using Q-networks as AFs.\nDifferent from the above multi-step solutions, FSAF is meant to serve as an AF that can adapt to a wide variety of black-box functions given only a small amount of meta-data. Few-shot learning. Few-shot learning has recently attracted much attention since the data scarcity has become a bottleneck to many real-world machine learning tasks .\nUsing prior knowledge, few-shot learning can rapidly generalize a pre-trained model to new tasks given only a few examples.\nOne of the most representative frameworks for few-shot learning is MAML , where an initialization of parameters is pre-trained to be close to the tasks drawn from the task distribution, and thus a few gradient steps are sufficient to adapt it to a specific task.\nThere are several follow-up studies for MAML. For instance, in , vanilla MAML is shown to be sensitive to the network hyperparameters, often leading to training instability. To overcome that, learning the majority of hyperparameters end to end is proposed. In , a Bayesian version of MAML is proposed to learn complex uncertainty structure beyond a simple Gaussian approximation. In , MAML is revisited under multimodel task distributions. To better adapt to different modes, a modulation network is proposed to identify the mode of the task distribution and then customize the meta-learned prior for the identified mode. Meta Bayesian optimization. Meta-learning for BO has been discussed in many prior studies. Some of them   use a single GP model as the prior of all the tasks. However, in real-world applications, different tasks may have different task-specific features that fail to be captured by a single model. To mitigate the issue, several studies propose to learn an ensemble of GPs as the prior. For instance, Wistuba et al.  proposed to use a transferable AF that uses several GPs to evaluate the target dataset then weights expected improvement by the result of the evaluation for fitting in the current task.\nFeurer et al.  proposed to use an ensemble of GP models obtained from each subset of meta-data and use all of them for inference in the new task.\nBut these works still need a sufficiently large amount of data for knowledge transfer to new tasks.\nMetaBO  used policy-based RL to train a neural AF that learns structural properties of a set of source tasks to enable knowledge transfer to related new tasks.\nFSBO  provides a few-shot deep kernel network for a GP surrogate that can quickly adapt its kernel parameters to unseen tasks.\nHowever, the benefits of using meta-data for more efficient exploration via few-shot fast adaptation of AFs were not explored by  .\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: AF is designed from the perspective of optimism in the face of uncertainty .\nUnder EI, AF incorporates the expected one-step improvement in terms of the best observation made so far by design  [ref]14.\nSimilarly, under the knowledge gradient method [ref]39, AF is chosen to be the expected improvement in the largest posterior mean over the input domain.\nInstead of using the expected\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
