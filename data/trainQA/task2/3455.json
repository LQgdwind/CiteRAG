      "content": "Paper Title: Supported Policy Optimization for Offline Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nData. We use the datasets from the D4RL benchmark , of the latest versions, which are ‚Äúv2‚Äù for both Gym-MuJoCo and AntMaze domains. Baselines. We report Gym-MuJoCo results of baselines directly from IQL paper  and rerun competitive baselines for AntMaze tasks on ‚Äúv2‚Äù datasets, taking their official implementations: BC : modified from https://github.com/sfujim/TD3_BC Decision Transformer : https://github.com/kzl/decision-transformer TD3+BC [ref]8: https://github.com/sfujim/TD3_BC CQL : https://github.com/aviralkumar2907/CQL IQL : https://github.com/ikostrikov/implicit_q_learning/ Implementation details. Our algorithm SPOT consists of two stages, namely VAE training and policy training. We will introduce the details of both stages respectively. For VAE training, our code is based on the implementation of BCQ: https://github.com/sfujim/BCQ/tree/master/continuous_BCQ. Following TD3+BC [ref]8, we normalize the states in the dataset for Gym-MuJoCo domains but do not normalize the states for AntMaze domains. Hyperparameters used by VAE are in Table 5. For policy training, our code is based on the implementation of TD3+BC [ref]8. Following IQL , we subtract 1 from rewards for the AntMaze datasets. Hyperparameters used by policy training are in Table 6. For evaluation, we average mean returns overs 10 evaluation trajectories on the Gym-MuJoCo tasks, and average over 100 evaluation trajectories on the AntMaze tasks. Hyperparameter tuning. The weight of regularization term ŒªùúÜ\\lambda is essential for SPOT to control different strengths of the constraint. Following prior works [ref]2  , we allow access to the environment to tune a small (<10absent10<10) set of the hyperparameter ŒªùúÜ\\lambda. The hyperparameter sets for Gym-MuJoCo and AntMaze domains can be seen in Table 6. We tune hyperparameters using 3 seeds but then evaluate the best hyperparameter by training with totally new 10 seeds and then report final results on these additional 10 seeds. As discussed in Brandfonbrener et al. [ref]2, it‚Äôs a reasonable setup for applications like robotics, where we can test a limited number of trained policies on a real system. Beyond the scope of this work, we believe that to make offline RL more widely applicable, better approaches for offline policy evaluation and selection are indispensable. Fortunately, it has attracted wide attention by the community and we refer the reader to [ref]36 . Note that Paine et al. [ref]36 demonstrate that policies learned by policy constraint methods have the advantage of being easier to evaluate and rank offline, since the methods encourage learned policies to stay close to the behavior policy. Learning curves. Learning curves of best tuned ŒªùúÜ\\lambda for each dataset is presented in Figure 4 and Figure 5. Learning curves of different ŒªùúÜ\\lambda for Gym-MuJoCo domains is presented in Figure 6.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: AntMaze tasks on ‚Äúv2‚Äù datasets, taking their official implementations: BC : modified from https://github.com/sfujim/TD3_BC Decision Transformer : https://github.com/kzl/decision-transformer TD3+BC [ref]8: https://github.com/sfujim/TD3_BC CQL : https://github.com/aviralkumar2907/CQL IQL : https://github.com/ikostrikov/implicit_q_learning/ Implementation details.
