      "content": "Paper Title: Taming Reachability Analysis of DNN-Controlled Systems via Abstraction-Based Training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur work is a sequel of recently emerged approaches for the reachability analysis of DNN-controlled systems such as Verisig 2.0 , Polar [ref]30, ReachNN* .\nBesides these states of the art,\nNNV  introduces the star set analysis technique 7 to deal with the neural network and combines with the tool called CORA  for the reachability analysis of non-linear systems. JuliaReach  integrates the over-approximation of environment dynamics and DNNs together using Taylor models and zonotope. All these approaches treat DNNs as white boxes by over-approximating them with efficiently computable models such as Taylor models . Due to the intrinsic complexity of DNNs, these white-box approaches are applicable to only a limited type of DNNs on small scales. Our abstraction-based training method follows those machine learning methodologies which advocate a similar idea of pre-processing training data using either abstraction  [ref]34, fuzzing  or granulation 2 for various purposes of reducing the size of models, capturing uncertainties in input data and extracting abstract knowledge.\nRecent studies show that,\nrather than training on concrete datasets,\ntraining on symbolic datasets\nis helpful to build verification-friendly neural networks 0 and network-controlled systems [ref]34.\nThe approach in  is focused on the training of finite-state systems, while the one in [ref]34 needs to extend existing training methods to admit abstract states. Our design of abstract neural networks is more decent than the approach in [ref]34 because we only need to insert abstraction layers into neural networks and do not impose any other changes to training algorithms. There are several black-box but unsound verification approaches for DNN-controlled systems. For instance, Fan et al. proposed a hybrid approach of combining black-box simulation and white-box transition graph for a probabilistic verification result 2. Xue et al. proposed a black-box model-checking approach for continuous-time dynamical systems based on Probably Approximate Correctness (PAC) learning .\nDong et al. built a discrete-time Markov chain from extracted trajectories of a DRL system and verified safety properties by probabilistic model checking .\nHowever, these approaches are not sound and can only compute error probability and confidence with probably approximate correctness guarantees.\nThe fundamental reason for the unsoundness is that only partial behaviors of systems can be modeled when conventional neural networks are treated as black-box oracles, i.e., fixing concrete system states and feeding them into the networks to determine the state transitions.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: Our work is a sequel of recently emerged approaches for the reachability analysis of DNN-controlled systems such as Verisig 2.0 , Polar [ref]30, ReachNN* .\nBesides these states of the art,\nNNV  introduces the star set analysis technique 7 to deal with the neural network and combines with the tool called CORA  for the reachability\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
