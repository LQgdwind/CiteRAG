      "content": "Paper Title: Stochastic Submodular Maximization via Polynomial Estimators\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile submodular optimization problems are generally NP-hard, the celebrated greedy algorithm 1 attains a (1‚àí1/e)11ùëí(1-1/e) approximation ratio for submodular maximization subject to uniform matroids and a 1/2121/2 approximation ratio for general matroid constraints. As discussed in the introduction, the continuous greedy algorithm  restores the (1‚àí1/e)11ùëí(1-1/e) approximation ratio by lifting the discrete problem to the continuous domain via the multilinear relaxation. Stochastic submodular maximization, in which the objective is expressed as an expectation, has gained a lot of interest in the recent years  7 . Karimi et al. [ref]12 use a concave relaxation method that achieves the (1‚àí1/e)11ùëí(1-1/e) approximation guarantee, but only for the class of submodular coverage functions. Hassani et al.¬†[ref]11 provide projected gradients methods for the general case of stochastic submodular problems that achieve 1/2121/2 approximation guarantee. Mokhtari et al. 0 propose stochastic conditional gradient methods for solving both minimization and maximization stochastic submodular optimization problems. Their method for maximization, Stochastic Continous Greedy (SCG) can be interpreted as a stochastic variant of the continuous greedy algorithm 5  and achieves a tight (1‚àí1/e)11ùëí(1-1/e) approximation guarantee for monotone and submodular functions. Our work builds upon and relies on the approach by √ñzcan et al.¬†2, who studied ways of accelerating the computation of gradients via a polynomial estimator. Extending on the work of Mahdian et al.¬†, √ñzcan et al. show that submodular functions that can be written as compositions of (a) an analytic function and (b) a multilinear function can be arbitrarily well approximated via Taylor polynomials; in turn, this gives rise to a method for approximating their multilinear relaxation in a closed form, without sampling. We leverage this method in the context of stochastic submodular optimization, showing that it can also be applied in combination with SCG of Mokhtari et al.¬†0: this eliminates one of the two sources of randomness, thereby reducing variance at the expense of added bias. From a technical standpoint, this requires controlling the error introduced by the bias of the polynomial estimator, while simultaneously accounting for the variance inherent in SCG, due to sampling instances.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: domain via the multilinear relaxation.
