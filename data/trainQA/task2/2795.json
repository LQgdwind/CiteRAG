Also, we read about SPENs [ref]8 used as output layers for structured prediction in energy-based models and it may be interesting to explore how to use SPEN layer as as internal neural network layers in the form of attention-based modules (replace CRF based attention module with SPEN based module), using approximate inference methods and end-to-end training mechanism mentioned in [ref]17, , and [ref]10. We may try finding alternatives to ICNN [ref]10 approach which is less restrictive for enforcing convexity or employ a regularization method that enforces convexity as a soft constraint. Also, GLOM  mentioned about consensus based attention mechanism which can be modelled using linear-chain CRF with pairwise dependencies. Much work has not been done in the field of seq-to-seq models and Natural language inference using structured prediction based techniques and recently it has been found that transformers  give great accuracy on these tasks but it was found in TaxiNLI  that many taxonomic categories were found to be difficult to be predicted accurately by transformers in Natural Language inference and question answering. We want to experiment by adding structured prediction based methods on top of the output layer in such seq-to-seq tasks and see which are more robust to all taxonomic categories. Also, we would like to experiment how transformer would work if we replace its normal soft attention layer by structured attention layer. Recent structured prediction approaches that we surveyed like SPENs, DVNs and TreeLSTMs are being applied to a very small set of tasks which are simpler than majority of structured prediction tasks. We would like to extend these ideas to other language understanding tasks where we have to predict a structured output and see if these techniques improve the baselines. There may be some problems in making the model tractable but the end-to-end training mechanisms of these individual methods or application of certain restrictions suggested in ICNNs [ref]10 would make the model training work properly. Many natural language understanding datasets contain annotation artifacts or biases and we would like to explore how various NLP approaches are robust to dataset biases. We believe structured prediction techniques would result in more robust models. We would further like to work on making the models even more robust, come up with new training methods to combat bias, and extending the ideas to other language understanding tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: Structured Attention networks [ref]17 proposed an approach to add graphical models anywhere within deep networks in place of simple attention layers.
