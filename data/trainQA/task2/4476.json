      "content": "Paper Title: Generative Bias for Robust Visual Question Answering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVQA [ref]5   has been actively studied in recent years with performance reaching close to human performance      in the most recent works.\nEven still, the VQA dataset has been notorious for its reliance on language biases as shown by [ref]3.\nTo this date, many VQA datasets and evaluation protocols have been derived from the original VQA dataset and have been released to the public as a means to test and understand the biases and robustness of VQA models such as VQA-CP2 and CP1 [ref]3, GQA-OOD , and VQA-CE . In light of this, many methods have been proposed. One line of work strives to improve visual attention through visual grounding by including additional human annotations or explanations  , which show limited improvements. Another line of work changes the distribution of the training set by either randomly or systematically replacing the images and questions      or by augmenting the dataset through counterfactual samples  or through the use of an external inpainting network . Although powerful, according to , changing the distribution of the training set does not agree with the philosophy of the creation of this dataset. Therefore, we do not directly compare experimentally with this line of works. Most recently, another line of work has been released where an additional objective of Visual Entailment is added to further boost performance , which we do not compare for fairness. Another recent work focuses on distilling knowledge from the some of the aforementioned methods to train a robust student model . As this method is built upon other methods, we compare to this method where possible. One of the most effective line of work is ensemble based methods    9 and we place our line of work here. Within ensemble based methods, AReg , RUBi , LMH 3, GGE 9 tackle the language prior directly and only use a question-only model. Unlike these methods, GGE 9 shows the possibility of using the same model as the target model to learn biases but to a limited extent. On the other hand, CF-VQA  uses both question and image, but uses the modalities individually without combining them.\nOur work is distinct from all previous ensemble based methods as we use a generative network with a noise input to aid the bias model in learning the bias directly from the target model.\nWe also believe that our work can be applied to other multi-modal        and uni-modal research  tasks in the future.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: VQA [ref]5   has been actively studied in recent years with performance reaching close to human performance      in the most recent works.\nEven still, the VQA dataset has been notorious for its reliance\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
