      "content": "Paper Title: Hybrid Beamforming Design for RSMA-assisted mmWave Integrated Sensing and Communications\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe sixth generation (6G) of wireless networks is regarded as a major enabler for emerging services such as autonomous driving, smart manufacturing, remote health care, and digital twins . The aforementioned applications require networks with both high-throughput communication and high-accuracy sensing capabilities. Meanwhile, the exponential growth of wireless services and the massive number of connections to wireless devices are straining spectrum resources, which will create an urgent need for additional spectrum, of which the radar frequency bands are one of the best candidates for coexistence with communication systems [ref]2. Based on the above service and spectrum coexistence requirements, integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) technology has arisen and attracted extensive resesarch attention in industry and academia . Recently, the international telecommunication union (ITU) has released the 6G overall objective recommendation, in which ISAC, as one of the six key scenarios, aims to enable ubiquitous wireless sensing capabilities for 6G network infrastructures . Distinguished from communication and radar coexistence designs ,, ISAC is designed to simultaneously realize communication and sensing functions by sharing wireless resources, hardware platforms, and joint signal processing frameworks, yielding integration gains and collaboration gains to the system. Specifically, ISAC signal design methods can be classified into three categories: sensing-centric design (SCD), communication-centric design (CCD), and joint design (JD). Early SCD scheme modulates the communication symbols into the radar chirp signals . The CCD scheme is mainly based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveforms to design the ISAC signal , . However, the JD scheme does not rely on the existing waveforms and designs the ISAC waveforms from scratch in order to improve the freedom and flexibility of the system. The authors of 0 pioneered a JD approach based on optimization techniques to solve the problem of designing the constant envelope waveforms for the ISAC system. In addition, since multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology can further improve the diversity gain and degrees of freedom (DoFs) of the system, the integration design of MIMO communication and MIMO radar in the spatial domain is an inevitable trend. The authors of 1 proposed a scheme that utilizes the sidelobe level of the MIMO radar beampattern to represent the communication symbols, while the main beam is only used for target sensing. Further, the beamforming design of the MIMO-ISAC system can be formulated as nonlinear optimization problems considering communication performance metrics (e.g., throughput 2, 3, symbol error rate (SER) 4, singal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) 5, etc.) and sensing performance metrics (e.g., beampattern matching mean-square error 6,7, signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) 8, Cram√©r-Rao bound (CRB) 9, , etc.). All of the above ISAC research is based on the sub-6 GHz band, but in order to cope with the explosive growth of wireless devices and services, the millimeter-wave (mmWave) spectrum band of 30-300 GHz can further dramatically improve communication capacity and target sensing accuracy, and thus, become a new research spectrum band for ISAC. The authors of  achieved gigabit communication rates and centimeter-level sensing accuracy for short distances based on the IEEE 802.11ad protocol at 60 GHz carriers. However, the short wavelength of mmWave leads to severe road loss and rain fading . Therefore, transmitters usually need to employ massive MIMO (mMIMO) technology to form high beam gains to overcome these drawbacks. Note that the fully digital large-scale antenna array structure, i.e., each antenna needs to be equipped with a radio frequency (RF) chain, will lead to high hardware costs and power consumption. To address the above issues, the mmWave communication base station (BS) has widely adopted hybrid beamforming (HBF) architectures ,,, which require only a few RF chains to be connected to the large-scale antenna arrays via phase shifters (PSs), thus reducing the hardware cost and improving the energy efficiency of the system. In addition, the above hybrid architecture was also demonstrated in phased-MIMO radar , which integrates the advantages of the diversity gain of orthogonal waveforms of MIMO radar and the high beam gain of phased-array radar to improve the SCNR of the received signals and the target detection probability. Based on the similarities between communication hybrid architectures and phased-MIMO radars, the research of HBF has been in mmWave ISAC systems. The authors of  have pioneered the HBF design for ISAC systems that minimizes the weighted sum of the radar beampattern error and the communication precoding error. The complete uplink and downlink communication protocols and target sensing steps in HBF-based mmWave ISAC systems were given in . The authors of ,0 presented the HBF design scheme based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. In the MIMO-ISAC systems mentioned above, spatial division multiple access (SDMA) was used to manage the interference between the user and the radar. However, rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) is a non-orthogonal transmission strategy based on rate-splitting (RS) precoding at the transmitter and successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding at the receiver, which provides strong anti-interference capability for multi-antenna wireless networks 1. Specifically, RSMA divides user messages into common and private parts, encodes the common part jointly into common data streams decoded by SIC for multiple users, and encodes the private part independently into private data streams decoded by corresponding users. RSMA reconciles two extreme interference management strategies, SDMA, which treats interference entirely as noise, and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), which decodes interference completely, to achieve higher spectral and energy efficiencies 2,3. Further, the authors of 4,5 proposed a scheme for the RSMA-assisted ISAC system and demonstrated the advantages of RSMA in managing interference between communication users and interference between dual functions. The authors of 6 investigated RSMA-assisted multi-BS cooperative ISAC systems for advanced interference management and high-accuracy localization services. Motivated by the advantages of mmWave hybrid architecture‚Äòs low power consumption and robust RSMA interference management, we introduce RSMA in mmWave ISAC systems to address the joint common rate allocation and HBF design issues in order to fill the research gap in this area. We further improve the performance trade-off region of the ISAC system and reveal the mechanism of the RSMA strategy common data streams at the dual functions of communication and sensing. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: We first propose mmWave ISAC system with HBF structure assisted by RSMA. We formulate the weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problem by joint common rate allocation and HBF design, subject to the constraints of target sensing SCNR threshold, PSs unit-modulus, the total power budget, and the necessity for accurate correct decoding of common messages. The penalty dual decomposition (PDD) method coupled with the weighted mean squared error minimization (WMMSE) method is proposed to solve the above high-dimensional non-convex problem. First, the WMMSE method is used to transform the original problem into an equivalent form that is easy to solve. Next, the PDD algorithm of 7,8 is used to solve the corresponding problem by means of an inner and outer double loop, in which the variables are updated in the form of a closed-form solution in the inner loop. Rigorous proof of the algorithm‚Äôs converges to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the original optimization problem is provided. We extend the proposed algorithm to the HBF design based on finite-resolution PSs, which further reduces the hardware cost and power consumption and improves the energy efficiency of the system. Our simulation results show that the proposed WMMSE-PDD algorithm converges quickly. For both high and low spatial correlation channels, the RSMA-ISAC scheme outperforms the SDMA-ISAC and NOMA-ISAC schemes in terms of WSR and anti-clutter interference capability. We reveal that the common data stream has a dual function in mitigating multi-user interference and trade-offs between communication and sensing performance. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.\nIn Section II, we introduce the HBF-based RSMA-assisted mmWave ISAC system model and problem formulation. The specific algorithm for solving the optimization problem is presented in Section III. Section IV presents the extension of the algorithm to ISAC systems with finite resolution PSs. The simulation results are presented in Section V. Finally, our conclusions are provided in Section VI.
