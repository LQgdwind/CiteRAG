      "content": "Paper Title: POPO: Pessimistic Offline Policy Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImitation learning  methods study how to learn a policy by mimicking expert experience demonstrations. IL has been combined with RL, either by learning from demonstrations   , or using deep RL extensions  , or using variants policy gradient methods  . Although this family of methods has proven its efficiency, it is still insufficient in the face of fully offline datasets. They either require interaction with the environment or need high-quality data. These requirements are unable to meet under offline setting, making the use of imitation learning from offline data impractical [ref]18. How to deal with the impact of noise is also an urgent area in imitation learning  . Gao et al.  introduced an algorithm that learns from imperfect data, but it is not suitable for continuous control tasks. We borrow from the idea of imitation learning and introduce a generative model into POPO, which gives our model the potential of rapid learning. For unlimited data, some offline RL methods have proven their convergence, such as using non-parametric function approximation methods  and kernel methods . Fitted Q-iteration, using function approximation methods, such as decision trees , neural networks , cannot guarantee convergence in the offline setting. Recently, many offline RL algorithm combined with deep learning have received significant attention  [ref]18 [ref]26  [ref]28    . Offline RL suffers from the problem of the distribution shift, a.k.a. out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. Specifically, the target of the Bellman backup operator utilizes actions sampled from the learned policy in the policy evaluation and policy improvement process, which may not exist in the datasets. In the sense of batch-constrained, the BCQ algorithm [ref]18 can ensure that it converges to the optimal policy under the given consistent datasets. Bootstrapping error accumulation reduction (BEAR) algorithm [ref]26 uses maximum mean discrepancy (MMD)  to constrain the support of learned policy close to the behavior policy. Safe policy improvement with baseline bootstrapping (SPIBB) , similar to BEAR, constrains the support of learned policy w.r.t. behavior policy. Behavior regularized actor-critic (BRAC)  is an algorithmic framework that generalizes existing approaches to solve the offline RL problem by regularizing the behavior policy. AlgaeDICE  is an algorithm for policy gradient from arbitrary experience via DICE , which is based on a linear programming characterization of the Q-function. Critic Regularized Regression (CRR)  algorithm can be seen as a form of filtered behavior cloning where data is selected based on the policy’s value function. Conservative Q-learning (CQL)  aims to learn a conservative Q-function such that the expected value of a policy under this Q-function lower-bounds its true value. Random ensemble mixture (REM) [ref]28 uses random convex combinations of value functions to learn a static data set. Besides, REM proves that distributional RL can learn a better policy than the conventional form in offline setting. But there is a controversy that the success comes from the massive amount of data resulting in actions induced by concurrent policy always in the datasets . However, their work did not consider distributional value functions to control the attitude towards the OOD actions, thus improving policy. We recommend that readers check IQN algorithm . These methods focus on how to deal with OOD actions.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: require interaction with the environment or need high-quality data.
