Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Source models and their training.\nWe reimplement SimCLR¬†[ref]4 framework to train source embedding models.\nFollowing the original framework, ResNet50 is employed as the base network of the source models and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) head is appended to its last pooling layer.\nOn the CIFAR-10 dataset, the source models are trained for 1K epochs while following the details (\\eg, augmentation, learning rate, and temperature) described in [ref]4.\nOn the STL-10 dataset, we adopt the same configuration except that Gaussian blur is additionally employed for data augmentation. Target models and their training.\nFor training of target models, the MLP on top of the source models are removed and their embedding vectors are l2subscriptùëô2l_{2} normalized.\nTarget models have the same architecture as their source counterpart where the MLP head is removed, but with no l2subscriptùëô2l_{2} normalization.\nDetails of training target models are the same as those for the corresponding source models.\nAll target models are trained using the LARS optimizer¬† with initial learning rate of 4.04.04.0 and weight decay of 10‚àí6superscript10610^{-6}.\nWe warm up the learning rate linearly during the first 10 epochs\nand apply the cosine decay¬† after that.\nRegarding hyperparameters, both Œ¥ùõø\\delta and œÉùúé\\sigma in our loss are set to 1.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: Datasets and evaluation.\nSelf-supervised models and those enhanced by embedding transfer are evaluated on the CIFAR-10¬†[ref]24 and STL-10¬† datasets.\nIn the STL-10 dataset, both the labeled training set and unlabeled set are used for training, and the rest are kept for testing.\nThe performance of the models is\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
