The context of latent world models offers a natural solution that isn’t available in the general embedding problem, which consists in additionally training a probabilistic inverse model pω​(at∣zt,zt+1)subscript𝑝𝜔conditionalsubscript𝑎𝑡subscript𝑧𝑡subscript𝑧𝑡1p_{\\omega}(a_{t}\\mid z_{t},z_{t+1}) such that if TZ​(zt,at)=zt+1subscript𝑇𝑍subscript𝑧𝑡subscript𝑎𝑡subscript𝑧𝑡1T_{Z}(z_{t},a_{t})=z_{t+1}, then pω​(at∣zt,zt+1)>pω​(ak∣zt,zt+1)​∀ak≠at∈Asubscript𝑝𝜔conditionalsubscript𝑎𝑡subscript𝑧𝑡subscript𝑧𝑡1subscript𝑝𝜔conditionalsubscript𝑎𝑘subscript𝑧𝑡subscript𝑧𝑡1for-allsubscript𝑎𝑘subscript𝑎𝑡𝐴p_{\\omega}(a_{t}\\mid z_{t},z_{t+1})>p_{\\omega}(a_{k}\\mid z_{t},z_{t+1})\\forall a_{k}\\neq a_{t}\\in A.\nThe inverse model, parameterized by ω𝜔\\omega, can be trained to predict the action atsubscript𝑎𝑡a_{t} that causes the latent transition between two embeddings zt,zt+1subscript𝑧𝑡subscript𝑧𝑡1z_{t},z_{t+1} by minimizing multi-class cross entropy. Intuitively, ℒCEsubscriptℒCE\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{CE}} increases as embeddings collapse, since it becomes harder for the inverse model to recover the actions responsible for latent transitions. For this reason, it mitigates unwanted local minima. Moreover, it is empirically observed to enforce a regular structure in the latent space that eases the training procedure, as argued in Sec. A of the Appendix.\nWe note that this loss plays a similar role to the reconstruction loss in Hafner et al. [ref]18. However, ℒC​Esubscriptℒ𝐶𝐸\\mathcal{L}_{CE} does not force the encoder network to embed information that helps with reconstructing irrelevant parts of the observation, unlike training methods relying on image reconstruction   [ref]18  . While ℒCEsubscriptℒCE\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{CE}} is sufficient for preventing collapse of the latent space, a discrete structure needs to be recovered in order to deploy graph search in the latent space. In particular, it is still necessary to define a criterion to reidentify nodes during the search procedure, or to establish whether two embeddings (directly encoded from observations or imagined) represent the same true low-dimensional state. A straightforward way to enforce this is by introducing a margin ε𝜀\\varepsilon, representing a desirable minimum distance between embeddings of non-bisimilar states . A third and final loss term can then be introduced to encourage margins in the latent space: We then propose to reidentify two embeddings as representing the same true state if their Euclidean distance is less than ε2𝜀2\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2}. Adopting a latent margin effectively constrains the number of margin-separated states that can be represented on an hyperspherical latent space.\nHowever, this quantity is lower-bounded by the kissing number , that is the number of non-overlapping unit-spheres that can be tightly packed around one d𝑑d dimensional sphere.\nThe kissing number grows exponentially with the dimensionality d𝑑d.\nThus, the capacity of our d𝑑d-dimensional unit sphere latent space (d=16𝑑16d=16 in our case with margin ε=0.1𝜀0.1\\varepsilon=0.1) is not overly restricted. The world model can be trained jointly and end-to-end by simply minimizing a combination of the three loss functions: To summarize, the three components are respectively encouraging accurate dynamics predictions, regularizing latent representations and enforcing a discrete structure for state reidentification.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: not be distinguished in this case, this is not a desirable solution.\nWe remark that this is a known problem in metric learning and image retrieval , for which solutions ranging from siamese networks [ref]9 to using a triplet loss [ref]22 have been proposed.
