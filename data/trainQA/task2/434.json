      "content": "Paper Title: A Fully Dynamic Algorithm for k-Regret Minimizing Sets 1This research was mostly done when Yanhao Wang worked at National University of Singapore (NUS).\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere have been extensive studies on the k𝑘k-regret minimizing set (k𝑘k-RMS) problem\n(see  for a survey).\nNanongkai et al. \nfirst introduced the notions of maximum regret ratio and r𝑟r-regret query\n(i.e., maximum 111-regret ratio and 111-RMS in this paper).\nThey proposed the Cube algorithm to provide an upper-bound guarantee\nfor the maximum regret ratio of the optimal solution of 111-RMS.\nThey also proposed the Greedy heuristic for 111-RMS, which always picked a tuple that\nmaximally reduced the maximum regret ratio at each iteration.\nPeng and Wong  proposed the GeoGreedy algorithm to\nimprove the efficiency of Greedy by utilizing the geometric properties of 111-RMS.\nAsudeh et al. 1 proposed two discretized matrix min-max (DMM)\nbased algorithms for 111-RMS. Xie et al. 3\ndesigned the Sphere algorithm\nfor 111-RMS based on the notion of ε𝜀\\varepsilon-kernel .\nShetiya et al. 4 proposed a unified algorithm called URM\nbased on k𝑘k-Medoid clustering for lpsuperscript𝑙𝑝l^{p}-norm RMS\nproblems, of which 111-RMS was a special case when p=∞𝑝p=\\infty.\nThe aforementioned algorithms cannot be used for k𝑘k-RMS when k>1𝑘1k>1.\nChester et al.  first extended\nthe notion of 111-RMS to k𝑘k-RMS.\nThey also proposed a randomized Greedy∗ algorithm\nthat extended the Greedy heuristic to support k𝑘k-RMS when k>1𝑘1k>1.\nThe min-size version of k𝑘k-RMS that returned the minimum subset whose maximum k𝑘k-regret ratio\nwas at most ε𝜀\\varepsilon for a given ε∈(0,1)𝜀01\\varepsilon\\in(0,1) was studied\nin  2.\nThey proposed two algorithms for min-size k𝑘k-RMS based on the notion of\nε𝜀\\varepsilon-kernel  and hitting-set,\nrespectively. However, all above algorithms are designed for the static setting and\nvery inefficient to process database updates.\nTo the best of our knowledge, FD-RMS is the first k𝑘k-RMS algorithm that is optimized for\nthe fully dynamic setting and efficiently maintains the result for dynamic updates. Different variations of regret minimizing set problems were also studied recently.\nThe 111-RMS problem with nonlinear utility functions were studied\nin  [ref]30 .\nSpecifically, they generalized the class of utility functions to\nconvex functions ,\nmultiplicative functions [ref]30,\nand submodular functions , respectively.\nAsudeh et al. [ref]32 proposed the\nrank-regret representative (RRR) problem.\nThe difference between RRR and RMS is that\nthe regret in RRR is defined by ranking while the regret in RMS is defined by score.\nSeveral studies [ref]33  4\ninvestigated the average regret minimization (ARM) problem.\nInstead of minimizing the maximum regret ratio,\nARM returns a subset of r𝑟r tuples such that the average regret of all possible users is minimized.\nThe problem of interactive regret minimization that aimed to enhance the regret minimization\nproblem with user interactions was studied\nin  .\nXie et al.  proposed a variation of min-size RMS\ncalled α𝛼\\alpha-happiness query.\nSince these variations have different formulations from the original k𝑘k-RMS problem,\nthe algorithms proposed for them cannot be directly applied to the k𝑘k-RMS problem.\nMoreover, these algorithms are still proposed for the static setting\nwithout considering database updates.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: maintains the result for dynamic updates. Different variations of regret minimizing set problems were also studied recently.\nThe 111-RMS problem with nonlinear utility functions were studied\nin  [ref]30 .\nSpecifically, they generalized the class of utility functions to\nconvex functions ,\nmultiplicative functions [ref]30,\nand submodular functions , respectively.\nAsudeh et al. [ref]32 proposed\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
