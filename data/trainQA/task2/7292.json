      "content": "Paper Title: A review of Deep Learning Methods for Photoplethysmography Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn our reviewed papers, there are several signal processing topics related to PPG and deep learning. Among them, signal quality assessment and denoising are two main tasks, especially the former. Given the common presence of noise during PPG signal acquisition, it is indeed imperative to mitigate its adverse effects. Signal quality assessment frequently entails classifying PPG signals as either \"good\" or \"bad.\" For instance, Goh et al.  used CNN to categorize five-second PPG segments as clean or artifact-affected, achieving classification accuracies of 93.8% and 86.7% on two independent datasets sourced from the PhysioNet MIMIC-II matched waveform database. In the domain of denoising, Ahmed et al.  introduced a hybrid method in their work, leveraging a custom feedforward neural network to exploit the multi-resolution analysis capability of wavelets for PPG signal denoising. Another approach involved the use of GAN to reconstruct corrupted PPG signals, thus alleviating their adverse impact on model training . In addition to signal quality assessment and denoising, researchers have also explored studies focusing on the localization and segmentation of PPG signals. For instance, Ref.  employed CNN to detect and localize fiducial points within the PPG signal, such as the foot, maximum slope, and peak. Besides, in Ref. [ref]146, a Bi-directional LSTM was proposed for the accurate segmentation of PPG signals into systolic and diastolic phases. Biometric identification serves a critical function in safeguarding individualsâ€™ privacy on a daily basis. While traditional methods such as fingerprint identification and facial recognition are susceptible to spoofing or manual reproduction , advances in wireless sensor network technologies have made dynamic biometric identification more accessible. In 2019, Biswas et al.  introduced \"CorNET,\" a deep learning framework for biometric identification using a single-channel wrist-worn PPG signal. This framework comprises a two-layer CNN, a two-layer LSTM, and a final dense layer. Similarly, several other studies    have employed similar architectures for biometric identification, employing varying configurations of CNN, LSTM, and dense layers. Additionally, CNNs have been utilized for biometric identification, as well. For instance, Wang et al.  conducted a comparative study of scalable end-to-end CNNs, and their model achieved accuracies exceeding 97% on the VitalDB dataset, 99.5% on the BIDMC dataset, and 99.3% on the PRRB dataset, respectively. Moreover, some studies aimed to harness the power of CNN in image processing. To accomplish this, they firstly converted the time-serial PPG signals into 2D images using techniques such as Gram matrix  and spectrogram transformation , subsequently employing 2D-CNN to extract features and generate recognition results. Recently, there have been developments in using PPG signals to reconstruct ECG signals, driven by three primary factors. Firstly, the strong correlation between PPG and ECG signals  has enabled the synthesis of ECG waveforms solely from PPG waveforms. Secondly, while PPG signals have gained popularity in the healthcare system, ECG signals remain the gold standard for diagnosing certain heart conditions such as AF. Lastly, PPG sensors can be more easily integrated into various wearable devices (e.g., smartwatches) than ECG, as they require no electrodes and involve reduced skin contact, offering an optical method for capturing cardiac physiological measurements in everyday settings . In the task of deep learning-based ECG reconstruction, precise alignment between PPG and ECG signals is important. Tang et al.  addressed this by aligning the systolic peak of the PPG signal to the corresponding R peak of the ECG signal, and they used LSTM for ECG reconstruction. However, the manual alignment of PPG to ECG signals can be time-consuming and laborious due to the varying offsets in PPG signals resulting from device differences and individual physiological variations. Therefore, some alternative approaches have been proposed as demonstrated in   . For example, Chiu et al.  proposed a sequence Transformer network and a QRS complex-enhanced loss for automatic calibration of offsets and improved reconstruction quality. Human activity recognition holds increasing importance in diverse application scenarios, encompassing medical services and rehabilitation surveillance  . In this context, inertial measurement units, comprising ACC and gyroscopes, serve as prevalent sensors for recognizing human activities like walking, running, fast biking, and slow biking . In contrast, PPG sensors are extensively integrated into current smartwatches and wristbands, fostering ongoing studies to explore their potential in activity recognition. In Ref. , Boukhechba et al. decomposed the PPG signal into three parts: (1) cardiac signal (0.5-4Hz), (2) respiration signal (0.2-0.35Hz), and (3) motion artifact signal (0.1Hz or more) . By utilizing these components as inputs for their models, they successfully predicted five types of activities (standing, walking, jogging, jumping, and sitting) using solely PPG sensors, showcasing the viability of PPG sensors for human activity recognition. Besides,    combined PPG with other sensors such as ACC and ECG, leading to improved performance.\n\nReference markers found: [146]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]146: and segmentation of PPG signals.
