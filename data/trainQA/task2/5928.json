      "content": "Paper Title: AutoQNN: An End-to-End Framework for Automatically Quantizing Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBinary methods with only one bit, such as BC¬†[ref]17, BNN¬†, and Xnor-Net¬†, prefer noticeable efficiency improvement.\nThey can compress DNN memory footprint by up to 32x and replace expensive multiplication with cheap bit-operations.\nHowever, the binary methods significantly degrade accuracy, since the low bitwidth loses much information.\nTernary methods¬†   0 quantize the weights or activation of DNNs into ternaries of {-1, 0, 1}, aiming at remedying the accuracy degradation of the binary methods and not introducing additional overheads.\nQuaternary methods¬†  quantize model weights into four values of {-2, -1, 0, 1}. They reduce the model accuracy degradation using the same two bits as the ternary methods. Despite the advanced computing efficiency of the 1-bit or 2-bit methods above, the low bitwidth can significantly affect the model accuracy.\nThis motivates researchers to investigate high bitwidth fixed-point quantization.\nThe proposed method in¬†1 abandons the last bits of the binary strings of values and keeps the remaining bits as quantized fixed-point values.\nT-DLA 2 quantizes values into low-precision fixed-point values by reserving the first several significant bits of the binary string of values and dropping others.\nHowever, it is challenging for fixed-point quantization to handle the weights with a high dynamic range. Zoom quantization methods handle the weights with a high dynamic range by multiplying a full-precision scaling factor.\nFor example,\nDorefa-Net  and STC¬†0 first zoom the weights into the range of [-1,1] by dividing the weights according to their maximum value, and then uniformly map them into continuous integers.\nZoom quantization does not deal with the outliers in weights, which increases the quantization loss. Clip quantization eliminates the impact of outliers on zoom methods by estimating a reasonable range. It truncates weights into the estimated range.\nThe key point of clip quantization is how to balance clip-errors and project-errors¬†3 4 5.\nPACT¬†6 reparameterizes the clip threshold to learn a reasonable quantizing range.\nHAQ¬† minimizes the KL-divergence between the original weight distribution and the quantized weight distribution to seek the optimal clip threshold.\nŒºùúá\\muL2Q¬† seeks the optimal quantizing step-size by minimizing the L2 distance between the original values and the quantized ones. Besides, there are many studies concerning non-uniform quantization, such as power-of-two (PoT) quantization and residual quantization.\nPoT methods¬†7 8  quantize values into the form of PoT thus converting the multiplication into addition¬†7.\nResidual methods¬†9 0 1 2 quantize the residual errors, which are produced by the last quantizing process, into binaries iteratively.\nSimilar methods, such as LQ-Nets 3, ABC-Net 4, and AutoQ¬†5, quantize the weights/activation into the sum of several binary results.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: Binary methods with only one bit, such as BC¬†[ref]17, BNN¬†, and Xnor-Net¬†, prefer noticeable efficiency improvement.\nThey can compress DNN memory footprint by up to 32x and replace expensive multiplication with cheap bit-operations.\nHowever,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
