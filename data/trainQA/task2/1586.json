Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: (ùêÄùêÖ)^ùüê-S3Net: Attentive Feature Fusion with Adaptive Feature Selection for Sparse Semantic Segmentation Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSqueezeSeg [ref]31 is one of the first works on LiDAR semantic segmentation using range-image, where LiDAR point cloud projected on a 222D plane using spherical transformation. SqueezeSeg [ref]31 network is based on an encoder-decoder using Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) and a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) as a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) layer. In order to reduce number of the parameters in the network, SqueezeSeg incorporates ‚ÄúfireModules‚Äù from 4. In a subsequent work, SqueezeSegV2  introduced Context Aggregation Module (CAM), a refined loss function and batch normalization to further improve the model. SqueezeSegV3  stands on the shoulder of [ref]31 4, adopting a Spatially-Adaptive Convolution (SAC) to use different filters in different locations in relation to the input image. Inspired by YOLOv3 , RangeNet++ [ref]21 uses a DarkNet backbone to process a range-image. In addition to a novel CNN, RangeNet++ [ref]21 proposes an efficient way of predicting labels for the full point cloud using a fast implementation of K-nearest neighbour (KNN). Benefiting from a new 222D projection, PolarNet  takes on a different approach using a polar Birds-Eye-View (BEV) instead of the standard 222D grid-based BEV projections. Moreover, PolarNet encapsulates the information regarding each polar gird using PointNet, rather than using hand crafted features, resulting in a data-driven feature extraction, a nearest-neighbor-free method and a balanced grid distribution. Finally, in a more successful attempt, SalsaNext , makes a series of improvements to the backbone introduced in SalsaNet  such as, a new global contextual block, an improved encoder-decoder and Lov√°sz-Softmax loss  to achieve state-of-the-art results in 222D LiDAR semantic segmentation using range-image input.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: SqueezeSeg [ref]31 is one of the first works on LiDAR semantic segmentation using range-image, where LiDAR point cloud projected on a 222D plane using spherical transformation.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
