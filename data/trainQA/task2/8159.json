For the 2-dimensional instances, the symmetry results from the simple calculation of the colors on the three 111-simplices on the boundary. Algorithm 4 gives a valid 333-out-of-k+1𝑘1k\\!+\\!1 Approximate Symmetric Sperner instance for k=2𝑘2k=2. We will give a complete characterization of the coloring on the three boundaries: for any x∈ [ref]1𝑥01x\\in [ref]1, This directly implies (x,1−x,0)∼Csym(2)(x,0,1−x)∼Csym(2)(0,x,1−x)subscriptsimilar-tosuperscriptsubscript𝐶sym2𝑥1𝑥0𝑥01𝑥subscriptsimilar-tosuperscriptsubscript𝐶sym20𝑥1𝑥(x,1-x,0)\\sim_{C_{\\rm sym}^{(2)}}(x,0,1-x)\\sim_{C_{\\rm sym}^{(2)}}(0,x,1-x) for any x∈ [ref]1𝑥01x\\in [ref]1. For (x,1−x,0)𝑥1𝑥0(x,1-x,0), the projection is trivially (x,1−x)𝑥1𝑥(x,1-x). Then, we discuss three cases to prove Eq. 17: If x∈0.9±ε2𝑥plus-or-minus0.9superscript𝜀2x\\in 0.9\\pm\\varepsilon^{2}, 0.5​ε−2⋅(y0−0.1)∈±0.5⋅0.5superscript𝜀2subscript𝑦00.1plus-or-minus0.50.5\\varepsilon^{-2}\\cdot(y_{0}-0.1)\\in\\pm 0.5 and thus y~0=0.5+0.5​ε−2⋅(0.9−x)subscript~𝑦00.5⋅0.5superscript𝜀20.9𝑥\\tilde{y}_{0}=0.5+0.5\\varepsilon^{-2}\\cdot(0.9-x). The projection 𝒚(2)superscript𝒚2\\boldsymbol{y}^{(2)} in consideration, is then If x<0.9𝑥0.9x<0.9, y2(2)>0.5superscriptsubscript𝑦220.5y_{2}^{(2)}>0.5. Otherwise if x≥0.9𝑥0.9x\\geq 0.9, y2(2)≤0.5superscriptsubscript𝑦220.5y_{2}^{(2)}\\leq 0.5.\nSince C​(1−y,y,0)=1+𝟙​(y>0.5)𝐶1𝑦𝑦011𝑦0.5C(1-y,y,0)=1+\\mathds{1}(y>0.5) (Fact 25), we have Csym(2)​(x,1−x,0)=1+𝟙​(x<0.9)superscriptsubscript𝐶sym2𝑥1𝑥011𝑥0.9C_{\\rm sym}^{(2)}(x,1-x,0)=1+\\mathds{1}(x<0.9) for this subcase.

The intermediate projection 𝒚(2)superscript𝒚2\\boldsymbol{y}^{(2)} in consideration, is then (1,0,0)100(1,0,0).

For (x,0,1−x)𝑥01𝑥(x,0,1-x), the projection is (1,0)10(1,0). Therefore, y~0=0subscript~𝑦00\\tilde{y}_{0}=0 and the intermediate projection 𝒚(2)=(x,0,1−x)superscript𝒚2𝑥01𝑥\\boldsymbol{y}^{(2)}=(x,0,1-x).\nAccording to Fact 26, Csym(2)​(x,0,1−x)=C​(x,0,1−x)=1+2⋅𝟙​(x<0.9)superscriptsubscript𝐶sym2𝑥01𝑥𝐶𝑥01𝑥1⋅21𝑥0.9C_{\\rm sym}^{(2)}(x,0,1-x)=C(x,0,1-x)=1+2\\cdot\\mathds{1}(x<0.9), matching Eq. 18. For (0,x,1−x)0𝑥1𝑥(0,x,1-x), the projection is (0,1)01(0,1).\nTherefore, y~0=1subscript~𝑦01\\tilde{y}_{0}=1 and the intermediate projection 𝒚(2)=(0,x,1−x)superscript𝒚20𝑥1𝑥\\boldsymbol{y}^{(2)}=(0,x,1-x).\nAccording to Fact 26, Csym(2)​(0,x,1−x)=C​(0,x,1−x)=2+𝟙​(x<0.9)superscriptsubscript𝐶sym20𝑥1𝑥𝐶0𝑥1𝑥21𝑥0.9C_{\\rm sym}^{(2)}(0,x,1-x)=C(0,x,1-x)=2+\\mathds{1}(x<0.9), matching Eq. 19.\n∎ Note that we embed a \\PPAD-hard\ninstance C𝐶C inside Csym(2)superscriptsubscript𝐶sym2C_{\\rm sym}^{(2)} with a scaling factor of 2−2​n+1=2​ε2superscript22𝑛12superscript𝜀22^{-2n+1}=2\\varepsilon^{2} on the first and the second coordinates.\nIt is then easy to obtain the following \\PPAD-hardness result for Csym(2)superscriptsubscript𝐶sym2C_{\\rm sym}^{(2)}.
