PointNetGPD¬†[ref]13 is a sample-based method that represents a candidate grasp pose by the canonicalized points inside the gripper and infers grasp quality using a PointNet¬†[ref]22 model. VGN¬† (Volumetric Grasping Network) takes a TSDF of the workspace as input and outputs the grasp orientation and quality at each voxel. GIGA¬† (Grasp detection via Implicit Geometry and Affordance) uses a structured implicit neural representation from 2D feature grids and generates the grasp orientation and quality for each point trained with a auxiliary occupancy loss. Both VGN and GIGA receive a 40√ó40√ó4040404040\\times 40\\times 40 TSDF based on output from a single depth image.\nWe also evaluate a variation of GIGA with a 60√ó60√ó6060606060\\times 60\\times 60 resolution TSDF, which we refer to as GIGA-High. We use the pretrained models222Our trained models for VGN and GIGA on the dataset described above in Section¬†V-D did not perform as well as the pretrained models from Jiang et al.¬†. It is probably because they train separate models for the packed and pile scenarios with a larger dataset (4M labeled grasps for each scenario). We used their pretained models to do the evaluations.\nof VGN and GIGA from Jiang et al.¬†\nand uniformly sample 64 approach points and 4000 grasps for our method and PointNetGPD. As shown in Table II, the pretrained VGN and GIGA models have fewer parameters than our method due to their TSDF input. While our model requires more parameters to operate on point clouds, all compared models are relatively lightweight.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: We compare our method against three strong baselines.
