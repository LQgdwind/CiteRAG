      "content": "Paper Title: Explainability in Process Outcome Prediction: Guidelines to Obtain Interpretable and Faithful Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPredictive process monitoring is concerned with providing insights about the business processes of modern organizations. Most predictive efforts are primarily driven by using classical machine learning (ML) approaches such as logistic regression (LR) , ensemble methods such as XGBoost (XGB) and Random Forest (RF)  , with recent works showing interest in applying deep learning models [ref]19 . In [ref]19, they propose to use attention-based bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks for process outcome prediction. Next,  compare LSTMs with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), stating that the latter models work better. The study of  provides an extensive benchmark that comprises different event logs and classic approaches used for process outcome prediction, with the study of [ref]6 describing which event log properties facilitate the use of deep learning (DL) methods. Nonetheless, the lack of transparency of these sophisticated models prohibits the ability to understand the rationale of the decision-making process. Over the last two years, the topic of explainability has gained traction in predictive process monitoring. The different works are often divided into two different trends based on how they deal with the explainability-performance trade-off . The first trend generates post-hoc explanations for black box models. Several papers have already suggested explainability techniques on top of machine learning models, such as Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) SHapley or Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values [ref]21 , with similar developments in a deep learning context. As an example,  visualizes the influence of certain attributes in the different steps of the process in a LSTM model with the use of SHAP values. Next,  focuses on creating local post-hoc explanations with the use of a surrogate decision tree. In , Bidirectional LSTMs are used, where the hidden states of the time steps of both RNNs are concatenated. After this, a context vector is learnt that takes the different time steps into account.  visualizes the impact of the activities on the predictions with the use of gated graph neural networks.\nThe second trend introduces interpretable models instead of trying to break open these black box models, stating that there are alternative models that yield better explainability-performance trade-offs. In , a set of fuzzy rules are learnt from neural networks. Here, the relationship between inputs and output is determined by a set of IF-THEN rules. Nonetheless, this approach requires domain knowledge in order to bin the attributes into different interpretable terms. Next, a Bayesian network is used in  for next event and suffix prediction. Even though the causal relationships are inferred from historical data, it relies on domain knowledge assumptions. Finally,  draws two advanced logistic regression models from the XAI literature and adapts them to POP. These models, the Logit Leaf Model (LLM) and the Generalized Logistic Rule Model (GLRM), are originally introduced by  and  respectively. In the field of XAI, a wide range of works have already evaluated these different models with predictive performance-based metrics or with metrics that assess the quality of the explanation methods. As an example,  created a metric for explainability based on human-friendly properties, while  introduced a metric based on three different properties that define model complexity. Nonetheless, these metrics do not take into account the different attributes that are typical of a process-based analysis. The benchmark study of [ref]21 compares different explainability models in the field of predictive process monitoring, but the properties evaluated, stability and duration of execution, are not directly related to explainability and/or take into account the dimensions of process data. Furthermore, none of the above metrics evaluate the faithfulness of the explainability model. However, work from related fields show that there are substantial problems with the faithfulness of post-hoc explainability methods. First, the work of  states that the learned attention weights are uncorrelated with the gradient-based attribute importance, even though they mimic the predictions rather accurately. In addition, they state that a Leave-One-Out (LOO) attribute importance ranking correlates better with the gradient-based attribute importance ranking. Similarly, the findings of  show that the importance ranking of the attributes made by attention scores is not faithful to the model decisions (i.e., what the model perceived as important). Second,  demonstrated that there is a non-monotonic relationship between the SHAP values and the predictive performance. Third,  introduced metrics to the field of POP that assess the relevance of the attribute value range and the relevance of the decision boundary by calculating the change in predictions by permuting the attribute values inside and outside the attribute value range, respectively. The results show that both LIME and SHAP report low-to-moderate scores for both the faithfulness metrics. A comprehensive study about the (un)faithfulness of explainability methods in POP is hence missing, due to the fact that the accuracy, by which these post-hoc explanations reflect the behaviour of the predictive model, is often inadequate  . To conclude, there is a need for model-agnostic explainability metrics that are adapted to POP and work for both transparent and non-transparent models. Furthermore, the faithfulness of (post-hoc) explainability methods used for POP needs to be evaluated with the use of metrics that are based on the properties of explainability, i.e. interpretability and faithfulness. These domain-specific metrics can guide practitioners to select the best model for the task at hand  and can reduce the scope of research for human-based studies by reducing the financial and time costs of such experiments.\nThere is a notable void in the POP literature in this respect, which this paper will address through both introducing the notions of interpretability, faithfulness, and a POP-specific set of guidelines.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: learning (ML) approaches such as logistic regression (LR) , ensemble methods such as XGBoost (XGB) and Random Forest (RF)  , with recent works showing interest in applying deep learning models [ref]19 .
