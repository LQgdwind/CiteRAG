      "content": "Paper Title: NeuroQL: A Neuro-Symbolic Language and Dataset for Inter-Subjective Reasoning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe implemented NeuroQL as a DSL   using reflection and meta-programming [ref]29 [ref]35, allowing us to change the normal semantics of Python only for NeuroQL expressions (leaving the rest of the runtime unchanged). These changes include (i) the redefinition of variable declaration (when using the vars() and ids() primitives) (ii) the redefinition of the dot, assignment and equality operators for NeuroQL variables and NeuroQL ids. These changes make NeuroQL an embedded pidgin language according to the categorization of DSLs provided in . Our base unification algorithm   is implemented as a generalization of pattern matching  8, where both the pattern and the target may contain variables. The generalization receives a set of bindings as input (usually referred to as frames) and returns possible augmentations that contain matched values of – as yet – unresolved variables. By allowing for sub-queries to be matched either jointly or in parallel we can implement logical operations such as conjunction and disjunction. Unification with inference rules can then be achieved through nested pattern matching that tries to satisfy a rule’s body given the current bindings. We use a slight variation of the BM25 (Best Match 25) algorithm in our work to compensate for the most common cases of the “exact overlapp” problem of the initial algorithm [ref]20. The BM25 is itself an improvement over TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) [ref]20, with both algorithms being used as ranking methods for sparse retrievers. In our case we pre-process both the documents and the query to be matched by tokenizing and stemming the inputs. We don’t provide a further solution for synonyms using BM25, since in this case the more accurate DPR primitive can be used (see below). The two methods (BM25 and DPR) provide a trade-off for our users between speed and accuracy, with BM25 being the fastest and DPR being the most accurate. DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval) is a method that uses dense text embeddings for both query and documents that need to be matched. It is based on a BERT bi-encoder architecture that computes a dot product similarity between a document and a query. Our DPR is based on , using question & context encoders trained with the Natural Questions dataset  . This DPR is then used as a backend for of our neural_match primitive. The neural_match primitive receives a sub-query whose results are used to create a set of (id, document) pairs. It then tries to match the documents against a target query text, using our DPR to return the top_k results that matched (see full example of neural_match in Section 2.1.1). A Reader or reading comprehension model is a neural network that can perform extractive Q&A by returning relevant text intervals of documents. In our work we use the MiniLM  model initially trained on the SQuAD 2.0 dataset  and further fine-tuned on the NeuroQL training set to improve its performance (as we describe in Section 2.4). This Reader is then used as a backend for of our neural_extract primitive. The neural_extract primitive receives the name of a new variable to bind for extracted answers, a query to create (id, document) pairs and finally a target query text. It then tries to extract relevant text intervals from our documents using the Reader to return the top_k results found. We fine-tuned our reader model for 3 epochs, using a 384-token sequence length with a 128-token document stride. We used a batch size of 16, learning rate of 1e-5 with a 0.2 warmup and included the ability to return no answers when predicting results. A translation model is a sequence-to-sequence neural network trained over pairs of input and target sequences. In our case we fine-tuned a CodeT5 model ) using the NeuroQL question/query dataset in order to translate inter-subjective questions posed in natural language into the NeuroQL query that can answer them (as detailed in Sections 2.3 and 2.4). This translation model is then used as a backend for our NeuroQL.translate and NeuroQL.answer primitives, which as their name suggests can translate questions into NeuroQL code and attempt to answer them.\nOur translation model was fine-tuned for 20 epochs with a maximum input/output length of 512 tokens, a batch size of 64 and an 1e-4 learning rate using a linear scheduler and an AdamW optimizer . In machine translation tasks the sacreBleu  score is used for the evaluation of generated translations focusing on reproducibility and comparability of reported results. It is itself a standardization of the Bleu  score that compares the n-grams of the generated sequences to those of the reference translations. In our work we use sacreBleu to evaluate the quality of our translation model (as detailed in Section 2.4). Recall: is a metric used to evaluate retrieval methods such as our neural_match primitive that is using a DPR model. Recall represents the percentage of relevant documents retrieved among the top_k results returned by a retriever (as we report in Section 2.4). EM & F1 Scores: are used to evaluate Q&A extraction methods such as our neural_extract primitive that is using a Reader model. EM represents the percentage of exact extracted matches, while F1 measures the harmonic mean of precision and recall (reported in Section 2.4).\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: We implemented NeuroQL as a DSL   using reflection and meta-programming [ref]29 [ref]35, allowing us to change the normal semantics of Python only for NeuroQL expressions (leaving the rest of the runtime unchanged).
