Variables are usually denoted with x,y,z,…𝑥𝑦𝑧…x,y,z,...; and finite sequences thereof with x¯,…¯𝑥…\\bar{x},...; and constants with a,b,c,…𝑎𝑏𝑐…a,b,c,..., etc. An atom is of the form P​(t1,…,tn)𝑃subscript𝑡1…subscript𝑡𝑛P(t_{1},\\ldots,t_{n}), with n𝑛n-ary P∈𝒫𝑃𝒫P\\in\\mathcal{P} and t1,…,tnsubscript𝑡1…subscript𝑡𝑛t_{1},\\ldots,t_{n} terms, i.e. constants, or variables.\nAn atom is ground (a.k.a. a tuple) if it contains no variables. A database (instance), D𝐷D, for ℛℛ\\mathcal{R} is a finite set of ground atoms; and it serves as an  interpretation structure for 𝔏​(ℛ)𝔏ℛ\\mathfrak{L}(\\mathcal{R}). A conjunctive query (CQ) is a FO formula, 𝒬​(x¯)𝒬¯𝑥\\mathcal{Q}(\\bar{x}), of the form  ∃y¯​(P1​(x¯1)∧⋯∧Pm​(x¯m))¯𝑦subscript𝑃1subscript¯𝑥1⋯subscript𝑃𝑚subscript¯𝑥𝑚\\exists\\bar{y}\\;(P_{1}(\\bar{x}_{1})\\wedge\\dots\\wedge P_{m}(\\bar{x}_{m})),\nwith Pi∈𝒫subscript𝑃𝑖𝒫P_{i}\\in\\mathcal{P}, and (distinct) free variables x¯:=(⋃x¯i)∖y¯assign¯𝑥subscript¯𝑥𝑖¯𝑦\\bar{x}:=(\\bigcup\\bar{x}_{i})\\smallsetminus\\bar{y}. If 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} has n𝑛n (free) variables, c¯∈𝒞n¯𝑐superscript𝒞𝑛\\bar{c}\\in\\mathcal{C}^{n}  is an answer to 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} from D𝐷D if D⊧𝒬​[c¯]models𝐷𝒬delimited-[]¯𝑐D\\models\\mathcal{Q}[\\bar{c}], i.e. Q​[c¯]𝑄delimited-[]¯𝑐Q[\\bar{c}] is true in D𝐷D when the variables in x¯¯𝑥\\bar{x} are componentwise replaced by the values in c¯¯𝑐\\bar{c}. 𝒬​(D)𝒬𝐷\\mathcal{Q}(D) denotes the set of answers to 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} from D𝐷D. 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} is a Boolean conjunctive query (BCQ) when x¯¯𝑥\\bar{x} is empty; and when true in D𝐷D, 𝒬​(D):={𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒}assign𝒬𝐷𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒\\mathcal{Q}(D):=\\{{\\it true}\\}. Otherwise, it is false, and 𝒬​(D):=∅assign𝒬𝐷\\mathcal{Q}(D):=\\emptyset. We will consider only conjunctive queries, which are the most common the data management. Integrity constraints (ICs) are sentences of 𝔏​(ℛ)𝔏ℛ\\mathfrak{L}(\\mathcal{R}) that a DB is expected to satisfy. Here, we consider mainly denial constraints  (DCs), i.e. of the form κ:¬∃x¯​(P1​(x¯1)∧⋯∧Pm​(x¯m)):𝜅¯𝑥subscript𝑃1subscript¯𝑥1⋯subscript𝑃𝑚subscript¯𝑥𝑚\\kappa\\!:\\neg\\exists\\bar{x}(P_{1}(\\bar{x}_{1})\\wedge\\dots\\wedge P_{m}(\\bar{x}_{m})),\nwhere Pi∈𝒫subscript𝑃𝑖𝒫P_{i}\\in\\mathcal{P}, and x¯=⋃x¯i¯𝑥subscript¯𝑥𝑖\\bar{x}=\\bigcup\\bar{x}_{i}.\n  If an instance D𝐷D does not satisfy the set ΣΣ\\Sigma of ICs associated to the schema, we say that D𝐷D is inconsistent, denoted with  D⊧̸Σnot-models𝐷ΣD\\not\\models\\Sigma. Now we move into the proper subject of this section.   In data management we need to understand and compute\nwhy certain results are obtained or not, e.g. query answers, violations of semantic conditions, etc.; and we\nexpect a database system to provide explanations.  Here, we will consider explanations that are based on actual causality 4 . They were introduced in\n , and will be illustrated by means of an example. Consider the database D𝐷{D}, and the Boolean conjunctive query (BCQ) oo oo 𝒬:∃x​∃y​(S​(x)∧R​(x,y)∧S​(y)):𝒬𝑥𝑦𝑆𝑥𝑅𝑥𝑦𝑆𝑦\\mathcal{Q}\\!:\\ \\exists x\\exists y(S(x)\\land R(x,y)\\land S(y)),\nfor which  D⊧𝒬models𝐷𝒬{D\\models\\mathcal{Q}} holds, i.e. the query is true in D𝐷D.  We ask about the causes for 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} to be true.  A tuple τ∈D𝜏𝐷{\\tau\\in D} is\ncounterfactual cause for 𝒬𝒬{\\mathcal{Q}}  (being true in D𝐷D)  if  D⊧𝒬models𝐷𝒬{D\\models\\mathcal{Q}} oo and  D∖{τ}⊧̸𝒬not-models𝐷𝜏𝒬{D\\smallsetminus\\{\\tau\\}\\not\\models\\mathcal{Q}}.\n In this example, S​(b)𝑆𝑏S(b) is a counterfactual cause for 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q}:  If S​(b)𝑆𝑏{S(b)} is removed from D𝐷{D},\n𝒬𝒬{\\mathcal{Q}} is no longer true. Removing a single tuple may not be enough to invalidate the query. Accordingly, a tuple τ∈D𝜏𝐷{\\tau\\in D} is an actual cause for 𝒬𝒬{\\mathcal{Q}}\nif there is a contingency set  Γ⊆(D∖{τ})Γ𝐷𝜏{\\Gamma\\subseteq(D\\smallsetminus\\{\\tau\\})}, such that  τ𝜏{\\tau}  is a counterfactual cause for 𝒬𝒬{\\mathcal{Q}} in D∖Γ𝐷Γ{D\\smallsetminus\\Gamma}. That is, D⊧𝒬models𝐷𝒬D\\models\\mathcal{Q},  D∖Γ⊧𝒬models𝐷Γ𝒬D\\smallsetminus\\Gamma\\models\\mathcal{Q}, but D∖(Γ∪{τ})⊧̸𝒬not-models𝐷Γ𝜏𝒬D\\smallsetminus(\\Gamma\\cup\\{\\tau\\})\\not\\models\\mathcal{Q}.\n In this example, R​(a,b)𝑅𝑎𝑏{R(a,b)} is not a counterfactual cause for 𝒬𝒬{\\mathcal{Q}}, but it is an actual cause with contingency set\n{R​(b,b)}𝑅𝑏𝑏{\\{R(b,b)\\}}:  If R​(b,b)𝑅𝑏𝑏{R(b,b)} is removed from D𝐷{D}, 𝒬𝒬{\\mathcal{Q}} is still true, but further removing R​(a,b)𝑅𝑎𝑏{R(a,b)} makes 𝒬𝒬{\\mathcal{Q}} false.\n  □□\\Box Notice that every counterfactual cause is also an actual cause, with empty contingent set. Actual causes that are not counterfactual causes need company to invalidate a query result.\n Now, we ask how strong are tuples as actual causes.  To answer this question, we appeal to the responsibility of an actual cause τ𝜏{\\tau} for 𝒬𝒬{\\mathcal{Q}} , defined by: where |Γ|Γ{|\\Gamma|} is the\nsize of a smallest contingency set, ΓΓ\\Gamma, for τ𝜏{\\tau},  and 00, otherwise. (ex. 1 cont.)  The responsibility of R​(a,b)𝑅𝑎𝑏{R(a,b)} is   1212\\frac{1}{2} =11+1absent111{=\\frac{1}{1+1}}  (its several smallest contingency sets have all size 11{1}).  R​(b,b)𝑅𝑏𝑏{R(b,b)} and S​(a)𝑆𝑎{S(a)} are also actual causes with responsibility  1212{\\frac{1}{2}}; and\nS​(b)𝑆𝑏{S(b)} is actual (counterfactual) cause with responsibility   111 =11+0absent110{=\\frac{1}{1+0}}.   □□\\Box We can see that causes are, in this database context, tuples that come with their responsibilities as “scores”.  It turns out that there are precise connections between database repairs and tuples as actual causes for queries answers in databases. These connections where exploited to obtain complexity results for responsibility  (among other uses, e.g. to obtain answer-set programs for the specification and computation of actual causes and responsibility [ref]9). The notion of repair of a relational database was introduced in order to formalize the notion of consistent query answering (CQA)  : If a database D𝐷D is inconsistent in the sense that is does not satisfy a given set of integrity constraints, 𝐼𝐶𝑠𝐼𝐶𝑠{\\it ICs}, and a query 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} is posed to D𝐷D, what are the meaningful, or consistent, answers to 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} from D𝐷D? They are sanctioned as those that hold (are returned as answers) from all the repairs of D𝐷D. The repairs of D𝐷D are consistent instances D′superscript𝐷′D^{\\prime} (over the same schema of D𝐷D), i.e. D′⊧𝐼𝐶𝑠modelssuperscript𝐷′𝐼𝐶𝑠D^{\\prime}\\models{\\it ICs}, and minimally depart from D𝐷D. Let us consider the following set of denial constraints (DCs) and a database D𝐷D, whose relations (tables) are shown right here below. D𝐷D is inconsistent, because it violates the DCs: it satisfies the joins that are prohibited by the DCs. ooo We want to repair the original instance by deleting tuples from relations. Notice that, for DCs, insertions of new tuple will not restore consistency. We could change (update) attribute values though, a possibility that has been investigated in [ref]9. Here we have two subset-repairs, a.k.a. S-repairs. They are subset-maximal consistent subinstances of D𝐷D:  D1={P​(e),Q​(a,b),R​(a,c)}subscript𝐷1𝑃𝑒𝑄𝑎𝑏𝑅𝑎𝑐D_{1}=\\{P(e),Q(a,b),R(a,c)\\}  and  D2={P(e),D_{2}=\\{P(e), P(a)}P(a)\\}. They are consistent, subinstances of D𝐷D, and any proper superset of them (still contained in D𝐷D) is inconsistent. (In general, we will represent database relations as set of tuples.) We also have cardinality repairs, a.k.a. C-repairs. They are consistent subinstances of D𝐷D that minimize the number of tuples by which they differ from D𝐷D. That is, they are maximum-cardinality consistent subinstances. In this case, only\nD1subscript𝐷1D_{1} is a C-repair.  Every C-repair is an S-repair, but not necessarily the other way around.   □□\\Box Let us now consider a BCQ which we assume is true in a database D𝐷D.  It turns out that we can obtain the causes for 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q}  to be true D𝐷D, and their contingency sets from database repairs. In order to do this, notice that\n¬𝒬𝒬\\neg\\mathcal{Q}  becomes a DC 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} holds in D𝐷D   iff   D𝐷D is inconsistent w.r.t. κ​(𝒬)𝜅𝒬\\kappa(\\mathcal{Q}). S-repairs are associated to causes with minimal contingency sets, while C-repairs are associated to causes for 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} with minimum contingency sets, and maximum responsibilities . In fact,\nfor a database tuple  τ∈D𝜏𝐷\\tau\\in D: τ𝜏\\tau  is actual cause for 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} with subset-minimal contingency set ΓΓ\\Gamma  iff  D∖(Γ∪{τ})𝐷Γ𝜏D\\smallsetminus(\\Gamma\\cup\\{\\tau\\})  is an S-repair (w.r.t. κ​(𝒬)𝜅𝒬\\kappa(\\mathcal{Q})),\nin which case, its responsibility is  11+|Γ|11Γ\\frac{1}{1+|\\Gamma|}. τ𝜏\\tau  is actual cause with minimum-cardinality contingency set ΓΓ\\Gamma  iff  D∖(Γ∪{τ})𝐷Γ𝜏D\\smallsetminus(\\Gamma\\cup\\{\\tau\\})  is C-repair,\nin which case, τ𝜏\\tau is a maximum-responsibility actual cause. Conversely, repairs can be obtained from causes and their contingency sets . These results can be extended to unions of BCQs (UBCQs), or equivalently, to sets of denial constraints. One can exploit the connection between causes and repairs to understand the computational complexity of the former by leveraging existing results for the latter. Beyond\nthe fact that computing or deciding actual causes can be done in polynomial time in data for CQs and unions of CQs (UCQs)  , one can show that\nmost computational problems related to responsibility are intractable, because they are also intractable for repairs, in particular, for C-repairs (all this in data complexity)\n3. In particular, one can prove : The responsibility problem, about deciding if a tuple has responsibility above a certain threshold, is N​P𝑁𝑃{\\it N\\!P}-complete for UCQs.  However, on the positive side, this problem is fixed-parameter tractable (equivalently, belongs to the FPT class) , with the parameter being the inverse of the threshold. Computing 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑝D𝒬​(τ)superscriptsubscript𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑝𝐷𝒬𝜏{\\it Resp}_{{}_{\\!D\\!}}^{\\!\\mathcal{Q}}(\\tau)  is F​PN​P​(𝑙𝑜𝑔​(n))𝐹superscript𝑃𝑁𝑃𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑛{\\it F\\!P}^{{\\it N\\!P(log}(n))}-complete for BCQs. This the functional, non-decision, version of the responsibility problem. The complexity class involved is that of computational problems that use polynomial time with a logarithmic number of calls to an oracle in NP. Deciding if a tuple τ𝜏\\tau is a most responsible cause is PN​P​(𝑙𝑜𝑔​(n))superscript𝑃𝑁𝑃𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑛P^{\\it N\\!P(log(n))}-complete for BCQs. The complexity class is as the previous one, but for decision problems . For further illustration, property (b) right above tells us that there is a database schema and a Boolean conjunctive query 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q}, such that computing the responsibility of tuple in an instance D𝐷D as an actual cause for 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} being true in D𝐷D is F​PN​P​(𝑙𝑜𝑔​(n))𝐹superscript𝑃𝑁𝑃𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑛{\\it F\\!P}^{{\\it N\\!P(log}(n))}-hard in |D|𝐷|D|. This is due to the fact that, through the C-repair connection,\ndetermining the responsibility of a tuple becomes the problem on hyper-graphs of determining the size of a minimum vertex cover that contains the tuple as a vertex (among all vertex covers that contain the vertex) [7, sec. 6]. This latter problem was first investigated in the context of C-repairs w.r.t. denial constraints. Those repairs can be characterized in terms of hyper-graphs 3 (see Section 3 for a simple example).  This hyper-graph connection also allows to obtain the FPT result in (a) above, because we are dealing with hyper-edges that have a fixed upper bound given by the number of atoms in the denial constraint associated to que conjunctive query 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} (see [7, sec. 6.1] for more details). Notice that a class of database repairs determines a possible-world semantics for database consistency restoration. We could use in principle any reasonable notion of distance between database instances, with each choice defining a particular repair semantics. S-repairs and C-repairs are examples of repair semantics. By choosing alternative repair semantics and an associated notion of counterfactual intervention, we can define also alternative notions of actual causality in databases and associated responsibility measures [ref]9.\n We will show an example in Section 2.1.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: where exploited to obtain complexity results for responsibility  (among other uses, e.g. to obtain answer-set programs for the specification and computation of actual causes and responsibility [ref]9).
