      "content": "Paper Title: MemoNav: Selecting Informative Memories for Visual Navigation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHuman beings plan their routes by recalling detailed experiences of the past   . When we get into a new environment, the first thing is usually to explore our surroundings to get familiar with the scene layout. This exploration behavior enables us to quickly plan new routes with the help of the so-called working memory  . Recent neuroscience research    has found that working memory is essential for organizing goal-directed behaviors including navigation, as it maintains task-relevant information. Several models   [ref]3 of working memory have been constructed to explain the relationships among short-term memory (STM), long-term memory (LTM), and working memory (WM). Particularly, the model by Cowan et al.  (shown in the Appendix) demonstrates that the human brain selects short-term memory as part of working memory by focusing attention on task-relevant experiences to avoid distractions. It is also noticed that working memory is not a simple extension of short-term memory, but an incorporation of selected short-term memory and long-term memory in goal-oriented tasks [ref]3. Inspired by the above neuroscience research, we propose a MemoNav for image-goal visual navigation (ImageNav) agents, which is built upon a SoTA topological map-based method VGM [ref]20. The MemoNav simulates the working memory mechanism of the human brain and improves the agent’s ability to complete multi-goal navigation tasks. Recently, a number of ImageNav methods [ref]20 [ref]9    have introduced memory mechanisms. According to the structure of memory, these methods can be classified into three categories: (a) metric map-based methods   that reconstruct local top-down maps and aggregate them into a global map, (b) stacked memory-based methods    that stack the past observations and pose sensor data in chronological order, and (c) topological map-based methods [ref]20 [ref]9   that store sparse landmark features in the graph nodes. Comparatively speaking, the metric map-based methods store every detail of the scene, thus consuming large memory when the agent encounters large scenes; the stacked memory-based methods utilize all past data without differentiating useful information and noise; the topological map-based methods benefit from the memory sparsity of topological maps, but still suffer from all memory computation without considering the contribution of each graph node. To overcome these limitations, the MemoNav enables the agent to flexibly retain informative navigation experience. In our design, the MemoNav utilizes the aforementioned three types of memory: STM, LTM, and WM. STM represents the local node features in a topological map; LTM is a global node continuously aggregating short-term memory; WM incorporates the informative fraction of the STM and the LTM. Technically, the MemoNav consists of four steps: map update, selective forgetting, memory encoding and decoding, and action generation. (1) Firstly, the map update module stores landmark features on the map as the STM. (2) To incorporate informative STM into the WM, a selective forgetting module temporarily removes nodes whose attention scores assigned by the memory decoder rank below a predefined percentage. After forgetting, the navigation pipeline will not compute the forgotten node features at subsequent time steps. To assist the STM, we add a global node   to the map as the LTM. The global node links to all map nodes and continuously aggregates the features of these nodes at each time step. (3) The retained STM and the LTM form the WM, which is then processed by a GATv2  encoder. Afterward, two Transformer  decoders use the embeddings of the goal image and the current observation to decode the processed WM. (4) Lastly, the decoded features are used for generating navigation actions. The MemoNav enables the agent to utilize task-relevant experiences to find a short path to the goal without being intervened by misleading information. With the synergy of these three types of memory, the MemoNav achieves considerable progress in multi-goal ImageNav tasks. The results show that compared with the SoTA method [ref]20, the MemoNav increased the success rate by 5%, 9%, and 3% on 2-goal, 3-goal, and 4-goal test datasets, respectively.\nThe main contributions of this paper are as follows: We propose the MemoNav, which utilizes a forgetting module to select informative short-term memory stored in the topological map for generating navigation actions. We introduce a global node to represent long-term memory as a supplement to the short-term memory. We evaluate the proposed model on a multi-goal task. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms the SoTA baseline by a large margin on a multi-goal task.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: .
