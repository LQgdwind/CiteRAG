      "content": "Paper Title: Formalizing and Estimating Distribution Inference Risks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHere we summarize prior work on formal definitions of privacy, distribution inference attacks and proposed defenses. Privacy definitions.\nMost formal privacy definitions, including numerous variations on differential privacy , focus on bounding inferences about specific data elements, not the statistical properties of a dataset. The key privacy notion of traditional differential privacy is intuitively connected to the risk to an individual in contributing their data to a dataset — this corresponds well to dataset privacy risks, but does not capture distribution inference risks; indeed, the main goal of most differentially private mechanisms is to satisfy the inference bound for individual data while providing the most accurate aggregate statistics possible. One notable exception is the Pufferfish framework [ref]14, which introduces notions that allow capturing aggregates of records via explicit specifications of potential secrets (e.g., distribution of vehicle routes in a shipping company) and their relations. Zhang et al. extend the Pufferfish framework to define the concept of “attribute privacy” , including a notion of distributional attribute privacy that takes a hierarchical approach for parameterizing distributions and could be instantiated to capture notions of distribution inference such as the fraction of records with some attribute. Although these definitions are promising and valuable, none of them are able to satisfy the simple goal we have to define distribution inference attacks in a way that is general and powerful, while clearly distinguishing inferences that are considered attacks from allowable statistical inferences. A recent attempt to formalize property inference [ref]5 consists of a framework that reduces property inference to Boolean functions of individual members, posing the ratio of members satisfying the given function in a dataset as the property. These ratio-based formulations limit the kinds of distribution inferences considered since they cannot capture many other kinds of statistical properties of the training distribution that may be sensitive, like the degree distribution of a graph . Ratio-based formulations assume the property function is applicable over individual data points (with the ratio as the property), while for graphs it is an aggregation over interconnected nodes. Distribution inference attacks.\nAll previous distribution inference attacks in the literature take a meta-classifier approach—the adversary trains models on datasets with different properties, then trains a meta-classifier using representations of those models. The adversary then uses the meta-classifier to look at the victim’s model and predict a property of the model’s training data, which is usually related to the ratio of members satisfying some Boolean property. Ateniese et al.  were the first to identify the threat of distribution inference (which they called property inference) and proposed a meta-classifier attack targeting Support Vector Machines and Hidden Markov Models. The proposed attacks can successfully infer the accent of speakers in speech-to-text systems, or the presence of traffic from particular sources in network traffic classification systems.\nModel representations for training the meta-classifier can take several forms: using model weights themselves  , or model activations or logits for a generated set of query points . These methods show promise, achieving better-than-random results for several properties, various tasks, and models across different domains. For instance, predicting a doctor’s specialty based on rating-prediction systems on text reviews [ref]9, identifying accents of speakers in voice-recognition models , and even predicting if a model has been trained to have a backdoor Trojan . Although these approaches achieve high accuracy rates on “toy-like” classifiers like decision trees and shallow neural networks, and with distributions that are highly disparate, successful property inference attacks have not been demonstrated on realistic (or even semi-realistic) deep neural networks or complex datasets. Our work is the first to demonstrate the capability of such attacks to work on large convolutional networks and different datasets across domains. Zhou et al.  extend distribution inference attacks to directly infer property ratios for Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Their approach involves the adversary training shadow GANs and then launching a black-box attack on the victim model using generated samples. Although their attack setting includes targeting large GAN models on complex datasets like CelebA , the adversary does not use the victim model’s model parameters directly as is done by our extension to convolutional models (Section 5.2.2). Similarly, Pasquini et al.  extend distribution inference attacks to a split-learning setting and only target parts of the victim model. Zhang et al. extended this approach to graphs and their properties 0, distinguishing training graphs according to properties such as the number of nodes and edges using attacks that assume access to graph embeddings.\nRecent attacks on hyper-parameter stealing 1 along with practical attacks on large language models 2 provide further evidence that deep neural networks leak many kinds of information about their training data and process. Defences against distribution inference.\nUnlike other notions of privacy like membership privacy, there are no known defenses against distribution inference. Differential privacy does not mitigate distribution inference risks since it obfuscates the contribution of individual records, while the adversary in our setting cares about statistical properties of the underlying distribution. Attempts in previous works to evaluate differential privacy as a potential defense  show that it fails to mitigate distribution inference. Removing sensitive attributes from datasets is not an effective defense either [ref]9, since correlations between attributes still leak information. Using node multiplicative transformations  has been proposed as a defense for neural networks with ReLU activations, but provides no protection against black-box attacks.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: private mechanisms is to satisfy the inference bound for individual data while providing the most accurate aggregate statistics possible.
