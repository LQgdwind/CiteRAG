      "content": "Paper Title: Story Visualization by Online Text Augmentation with Context Memory\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn Table 1, we summarize the performance of the prior arts and the proposed CMOTA in Pororo-SV [ref]17 and Flintstones-SV  dataset in the various metrics. By default, all methods generate 64×64646464\\times 64 images along with the higher resolution 128×128128128128\\times 128 images.\nCMOTA outperforms existing methods by a large margin in both benchmarks in most of metrics. The very recent method VP-CSV  performs on par to our CMOTA while ours still outperforms in FID, BLEU and R-precision, implying that CMOTA generates high quality images maintaining global semantic matching between story paragraph and images better than the VP-CSV.\nThe lower performance than the VP-CSV in Char. F1 score and Frm. Acc. is attributed to the specialized character-centric module that only focuses the model to generate accurate characters for each image at the expense of the other performance metrics.\nIn addition, our CMOTA-HR model even outperforms the VP-CSV  by large margin without the specialized character-centric module. Not surprisingly, CMOTA-HR outperforms CMOTA with default (low-) resolution (i.e., 64×64646464\\times 64) in almost all metrics.\nInterestingly, however, VLC-StoryGAN-HR 2 shows similar performance to 64×64646464\\times 64 model in Frame accuracy, BLEU, R-precision, and drops performance in all other metrics.\nFor the increased FID scores by the VLC-StoryGAN when goes to high resolution, we hypothesize that the constituency parse trees of input sentences in the VLC-StoryGAN increases the difficulty in generating visual details as the images contains more visual details in high resolution. In addition, we observe that the performance drop of FID in both our CMOTA and VLC, when goes to high resolution.\nIt is because as high-resolution image requires the model to depict fine-grained details, generation task would be more difficult compared to the low-resolution image generation.\nIn particular, the drop of FID in Flintstones-SV is larger than that in Pororo-SV.\nIt is because there are more complicated visual details in the Flintstones-SV than the Pororo-SV dataset.\nNote that the FID drops by our method from low-resolution to high resolution is less than the VLC in Pororo-SV.\nFurthermore, in terms of computational cost, our CMOTA gains performance boost by using high-resolution effectively with just adding relatively small computational cost on top of original 64×64646464\\times 64 model. Although our method does not explicitly enforce the character semantic preservation, the proposed memory delivers the semantic across the sentence implicitly.\nWe here investigate the character context preservation performance by comparing our method to 3 2 on per-character classification F1-score on test split of Pororo-SV dataset and normalized character frequency in train split dataset as illustrated in Fig. 7.\nEspecially, it is interesting to compare with  as it is explicitly proposed for that purpose. As shown in the figure, our method outperforms prior arts 3 2 by large margins.\nAlthough we did not have any special module for character information preserving, unlike , our model maintains such information over multiple sentences, even outperforming the image quality denoted as FID by −13.3813.38-13.38.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: In Table 1, we summarize the performance of the prior arts and the proposed CMOTA in Pororo-SV [ref]17 and Flintstones-SV  dataset in the various metrics. By default, all methods generate 64×64646464\\times 64 images along with the higher resolution 128×128128128128\\times 128 images.\nCMOTA\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
