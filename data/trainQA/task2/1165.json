      "content": "Paper Title: Transductive Zero-Shot Learning using Cross-Modal CycleGAN\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we provide a post-analysis of subsection 4.5 and further validate CM-GAN by using it to visually ground language . More precisely, we study the word embeddings learned in subsection 4.5, to investigate whether they capture visual information and common-sense knowledge. The goal of grounding is to enhance textual representations using visual information.\nThe first motivation for language grounding came from cognitive psychology studies    , stating that the human understanding of language is intrinsically linked to our perceptual and sensory-motor experience. It was further consolidated by quantitative-based findings such as the Human Reporting Bias [ref]45 : the frequency at which objects, relations, or events occur in natural language are significantly different from their real-world frequency — in other terms, what is obvious (visual commonsense) is rarely stated explicitly in text, since it is supposed to be known by the human reader. Following these considerations, AI researchers began to point out the lack of grounding  of Distributional Semantic Models such as Word2Vec [ref]15, where the meaning of words only depends on textual co-occurrence patterns. Unlike previous grounding models, that leverage direct correspondence between words and images , CM-GAN also exploits unsupervised information: it is thus interesting to determine whether this can enhance our word representations.\nBased on our CM-GAN model trained on ImageNet (subsection 4.5), we learn grounded word representations using information from seen and unseen classes.\n[ref]48 has shown that a word representation X𝑋X given by Word2Vec (purely textual as it is learned using Word2Vec on textual corpus only) and its projection in a visual space (which is said to be grounded since visual information has been incorporated) have complementary information, that can be exploited by concatenating them. Thus, we also evaluate various concatenation combinations between X𝑋X and its grounded projections. Evaluations are reported in Table 6 for standard word embeddings benchmarks . First, we consider semantic relatedness benchmarks, such as WordSim353 , MEN , SimLex-999 , SemSim and VisSim , which give human judgements of similarity (e.g., between 00 and 101010) for a series of word pairs. For each benchmark, the reported result is the Spearman correlation computed between (i) human similarity scores and (ii) the cosine similarities between word vectors.\nSecond, we report results for the concreteness prediction task on the USF dataset , which gives concreteness scores for 3260 English words. A SVM model is trained to predict these scores from the word vector. The reported result is the accuracy on a test set. We use the original Word2Vec vectors (dimension d=300𝑑300d=300) as T0subscript𝑇0T_{0} representations.\nWe note Vsup​(X)subscript𝑉sup𝑋V_{\\text{sup}}(X) (resp. Vtrans​(X)subscript𝑉trans𝑋V_{\\text{trans}}(X)) the cross-modal projection of X𝑋X learned using a supervised (resp. transductive) step.\nWe observe that grounded vectors tend to outperform X𝑋X on all benchmarks except Concreteness, and that the information present in X𝑋X and the grounded vectors is complementary, as X⊕Vtrans​(X)direct-sum𝑋subscript𝑉trans𝑋X\\oplus V_{\\text{trans}}(X) (resp. X⊕Vsup​(X)direct-sum𝑋subscript𝑉sup𝑋X\\oplus V_{\\text{sup}}(X)) outperforms both X𝑋X and Vtrans​(X)subscript𝑉trans𝑋V_{\\text{trans}}(X) (resp. Vsup​(X)subscript𝑉sup𝑋V_{\\text{sup}}(X)). Interestingly, we notice that X⊕Vtrans​(X)direct-sum𝑋subscript𝑉trans𝑋X\\oplus V_{\\text{trans}}(X) gives the highest performance, thus showing the efficiency of exploiting unsupervised visual information using CM-GAN.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: human understanding of language is intrinsically linked to our perceptual and sensory-motor experience.
