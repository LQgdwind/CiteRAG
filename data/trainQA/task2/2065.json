      "content": "Paper Title: Adversarial VQA: A New Benchmark for Evaluating the Robustness of VQA Models adversarialvqa.github.io\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRobust VQA Benchmarks \nThere has been a growing interest in building new benchmarks to study the robustness of VQA models. VQA-CP [ref]2, the first robust VQA benchmark constructed via reshuffling examples in VQA v2 , is proposed\nto evaluate question-oriented language bias in VQA models. GQA-OOD  improves from VQA-CP, and proposes to evaluate the performance differences between in-distribution and out-of-distribution split.\nBesides language bias, VQA-Rephrasings  exposes the brittleness of VQA models to linguistic variations in questions by collecting human-written rephrasings of VQA v2 questions.\nCausal VQA  studies robustness against semantic image manipulations, and tests for prediction consistency to questions on clean images and corresponding edited images. Further studies investigate robustness against reasoning. For instance,  collects perception-related sub-questions per question for a new reasoning split of VQA dataset.\n3 tests model’s ability to logical reasoning through logical compositions of yes/no questions in VQA v2.\nGQA 7 provides large-scale rule-based questions from ground-truth scene graphs, that can test VQA model’s ability on positional reasoning and relational reasoning. Despite the continuous efforts in evaluating robustness of VQA models, these works mostly focus on a single type of robustness, and are based on the original VQA v2 dataset via either another round of question collection given the existing VQA examples, or automatic transformation or manipulation of current examples. In comparison, we use different image sources, and collect a new challenging VQA benchmark by allowing human annotators to directly attack current state-of-the-art VQA models. Model-in-the-Loop Data Collection \nDataset collection with a model-in-the-loop setting has received increasing attention in recent years in the NLP community. In this setting, models are used in the collection process to identify wrongly predicted, thus more challenging examples. These models are used either as a post-processing filter  [ref]5 or directly during annotation  [ref]34 [ref]5.\nIn ANLI [ref]34, the model-in-the-loop strategy is extended to a Human-And-Model-in-the-Loop Enabled Training (HAMLET) setting, where the data collection happens in multiple rounds, and in each round, the models are updated to stronger versions by training with examples collected from previous rounds.\nThe goal of ANLI is to create a natural language inference (NLI) dataset that can grow along with the rapid advance of model capabilities 0   .\nIn contrast to static datasets that will eventually saturate as models become stronger, datasets created with the HAMLET procedure are dynamic – if the test set saturates with a more powerful model, one can use this more powerful model to assist the collection of a new set of difficult examples, leading to a never-ending challenge for the community.\nMeanwhile, the adversarial nature of the HAMLET procedure also helps to identify the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of existing models, and the biases or annotation artifacts 5   in existing datasets   .\nBeyond its application to the NLI task, the HAMLET procedure is also proved to be useful in collecting more challenging examples for the video-and-language future prediction task .\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Robust VQA Benchmarks \nThere has been a growing interest in building new benchmarks to study the robustness of VQA models.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
