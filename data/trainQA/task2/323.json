Training ML models at realistic scales, however, is challenging, given the enormous computing power required to process today’s data volumes. The collected data is also dispersed across networks of devices, while ML models are traditionally managed in a centralized manner . Fortunately, the rise in data generation in networks has occurred alongside a rise in the computing power of networked devices.\nThus, a possible solution for real-time training of and inferencing from data-driven ML algorithms lies in the emerging paradigm of fog computing, which aims to design systems, architectures, and algorithms that leverage device capabilities between the network edge and cloud .\nDeployment of 5G wireless networks and the Internet of Things (IoT) is accelerating adoption of this computing paradigm by expanding the set of connected devices with compute capabilities and enabling direct device-to-device communications between them . Though centralized ML algorithms are not optimized for such environments, distributed data analytics is expected to be a major driver of 5G adoption [ref]8. Initial efforts in decentralizing ML have focused on decomposing model parameter updates over several nodes, typically managed by some centralized server  . Most of these methods implicitly assume idealized network topologies where node and link properties are homogeneous. Fog environments, by contrast, are characterized by devices’ computation and communication resource heterogeneity, e.g., due to power constraints or privacy considerations.\nFor example, consider the two common fog topologies depicted in Figure 1. In the hierarchical scenario, weaker edge devices are connected to powerful edge servers. In the social network case, devices tend to have similar compute resources, but connectivity may vary significantly depending on levels of trust between users . A central question that arises, then, in adapting ML methodologies to fog environments is: How should each fog device contribute to the ML training and inference? The examples above motivate techniques for network-aware distributed learning, which (i) account for the potentially heterogeneous computation and communication resources across devices, and (ii) leverage the network topology for device communications to optimize the distribution of data processing through the network. In this paper, we develop a novel network-aware distributed learning methodology that optimizes the distribution of processing across a network of fog devices.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: New technologies like autonomous cars and smart factories are coming to rely extensively on data-driven machine learning (ML) algorithms   [ref]4 to produce near real-time insights based on historical data.
