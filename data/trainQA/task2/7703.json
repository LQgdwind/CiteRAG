      "content": "Paper Title: Cosystolic Expansion of Sheaves on Posets with Applications to Good 2-Query Locally Testable Codes and Lifted Codes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLocal criteria for establishing cosystolic expansion\nof constant sheaves on simplicial complexes\nappeared\nin  (dimX≤3dimension𝑋3\\dim X\\leq 3, ℱ=(𝔽2)Xℱsubscriptsubscript𝔽2𝑋{\\mathcal{F}}=(\\mathbb{F}_{2})_{X}),\n[ref]11\n(ℱ=(𝔽2)Xℱsubscriptsubscript𝔽2𝑋{\\mathcal{F}}=(\\mathbb{F}_{2})_{X}, see also [ref]13),\n\n(any constant sheaf),\n (same).\nOur Theorem 1.2 is an improvement of these results in two\nways. First, it applies to general posets, and second, it applies to all sheaves.\nIt further improves\n,\n[ref]11,\n by providing a lower bound\non the cosystolic expansion which is independent of the dimension and the degree of X𝑋X.\nOn the other hand, in the simplicial case,\n gives\na better lower bound on the k𝑘k-cosystolic expansion\nand\n[26, Thm. 7] establishes a better lower bound\non the k𝑘k-cocycle distance in the case ℱ=(𝔽2)Xℱsubscriptsubscript𝔽2𝑋{\\mathcal{F}}=(\\mathbb{F}_{2})_{X};\nboth bounds are Θ​(εk+1)Θsuperscript𝜀𝑘1\\Theta(\\varepsilon^{k+1}).\nThe reason\nfor this difference\nseems to stem from the fact that the arguments\nin\n,\n make critical use of the fact that the sheaf is constant and the poset is simplicial.\nA new feature of our result that did not appear in previous works on cosystolic expansion is the use of no-intersection graphs, which turned out to be necessary in treating the non-simplicial case.\nNo-intersection graphs were already studied in \nin the context of amplified testability, but not as a way to get cosystolic expansion. A local criterion for establishing cosystolic expansion\nof general sheaves on simplicial complexes first appeared in an earlier work of the authors\n[15, §8] now\nsuperseded by this work. The main result of [ref]10 gives sufficient conditions\nfor certain (non-constant) sheaves on certain cube complexes\nto have good cosystolic and systolic\nexpansion.\nIt is likely that\nthe cosystolic part of this result follows from our Theorem 1.2,\npossibly with different constants.\nIndeed, the two-way robustness requirement in [ref]10 is\nessentially the same as saying\nthat the proper links of the sheaved cube complex at hand are good\ncoboundary and boundary expanders, and therefore satisfy assumptions\n(1a) and (1b) of Theorem 1.2,\nand the expansion conditions in [ref]10\nimply the necessary expansion condition (2) in Theorem 1.2\nwhen X𝑋X is a cube complex [10, Claim 5.11, Lemma 5.12]. Our main theorem is also related to the main result\nof  (see also\n). There,\nthe authors consider codes modelled over 222-layer expanding systems,\nand show that these codes are locally testable if the underlying system\nsatisfies some global and local expansion conditions.\nIn our language, the 222-layer system is a 222-poset X𝑋X, and the code modelled over it, while not strictly\nbeing a sheaf, is very similar to an 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F}-sheaf ℱℱ{\\mathcal{F}} on X𝑋X in which ℱ​(x)=𝔽ℱ𝑥𝔽{\\mathcal{F}}(x)=\\mathbb{F} for all x∈X𝑥𝑋x\\in X\nand all the restriction maps are isomorphisms.\nThe conditions under which [27, Thm. 1.17]\napplies\nresemble assumptions (1a)–(2c) of Theorem 1.3 and suggest that conditions of this flavor may be necessary in general.\nIn fact, the codes modelled on 222-layer\nsystems of \nare examples of constraint systems on a poset — a variation on the definition of a sheaf to\nwhich our main result still applies, see 5.5 —,\nand so our Theorem 1.2 recovers the testability\npart of [27, Thm. 1.17].\nOn the other hand,  establishes a stronger kind of testability called\namplified local testability. Finally, we note that Kaufman and Tessler \nextended Garland’s Method and Oppenheim’s Trickling Down Theorem,\nwhich are examples of local criteria for other types of expansion, from\nsimplicial complexes to general posets.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: for establishing cosystolic expansion\nof constant sheaves on simplicial complexes\nappeared\nin  (dimX≤3dimension𝑋3\\dim X\\leq 3, ℱ=(𝔽2)Xℱsubscriptsubscript𝔽2𝑋{\\mathcal{F}}=(\\mathbb{F}_{2})_{X}),\n[ref]11\n(ℱ=(𝔽2)Xℱsubscriptsubscript𝔽2𝑋{\\mathcal{F}}=(\\mathbb{F}_{2})_{X}, see also [ref]13),\n\n(any constant sheaf),\n (same).\nOur Theorem 1.2 is an improvement of these results in two\nways.
