      "content": "Paper Title: Optimal task and motion planning and execution for multi-agent systems in dynamic environments\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis paper deals with interleaving task planning and motion planning and how to consider human behaviors in this process.\nExisting methods address the first aspect by following the combined task and motion planning (TAMP) paradigm .\nUsually, TAMP provides a task planner able to reason geometrically through calls to a motion planning algorithm. In such a hierarchical approach, a task planning algorithm finds a feasible sequence of actions, and a motion planner checks for geometric feasibility   [ref]5  .\nMost TAMP methods focus on the feasibility of the plan rather than its optimality (except for a few exceptions  ).\nFew works address temporal planning to consider task duration . HRC-oriented works usually focus on sub-problems such as scheduling human and robot actions   , or cooperative planning at a symbolic level   .\nFew works address TAMP by explicitly modeling the human agent  .\nFor example,  and 0 proposed a hierarchical agent-based task planner, where complex tasks are decomposed into simple actions.\nThe method improves the collaborative experience by considering human preferences as social costs, but throughput-oriented objectives are not considered 1 2.\nIn manufacturing-oriented methods, 3 optimizes the ergonomics of the human worker by using an online workflow scheduler.\n4 and 5 proposed a TAMP framework for planning and executing tasks using first-order logic graphs.\nA contingent-based approach was proposed in 6, and 7 to deal with uncertainty on the outcome of actions. The approaches above focus on finding feasible plans and do not consider: (i) process throughput; (ii) temporal constraints and uncertainty; (iii) human-robot synergy.\nRegarding (i) and (ii), timeline-based task planning 8 has proved to be a powerful approach in many real-world applications 9 0.\nThe value of this approach consists of integrating planning and scheduling in a unified reasoning framework, making decisions about what actions to perform and when.\nThis approach can also model the features’ controllability, i.e., the planner knows whether it can control the task’s beginning or the end 1.\nTimelines were applied to HRC in 2, although the integration with motion planning was inefficient because it reasoned at a low level of abstraction (point-to-point movements). Consequently, motion plans were pre-computed, hindering the flexibility of the approach in dynamic environments.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: through calls to a motion planning algorithm. In such a hierarchical approach, a task planning algorithm finds a feasible sequence of actions, and a motion planner checks for geometric feasibility   [ref]5  .\nMost TAMP methods focus on the feasibility of the plan rather than its optimality (except for a few exceptions  ).\nFew works address temporal planning to consider task duration .\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
