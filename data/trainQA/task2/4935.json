      "content": "Paper Title: Contrastive Representation Learning for Gaze Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGaze estimation methods are built using large-scale datasets either having 2D target labels   or 3D gaze directions   [ref]1. Broadly, gaze estimation methods can be divided into two categories: appearance methods  which directly map image pixels to 3D gaze direction, and model methods which rely on eye-geometry [ref]29. Appearance methods perform better than traditional model methods in real-world settings [ref]29 [ref]1. Recent progress in appearance methods relies heavily on deep learning to map eye/face images to gaze directions [ref]1 [ref]2. Furthermore, a few gaze methods are hybrid. For instance, Park et al. 0 extracted the relevant eye landmarks from the images and then used these features to train model gaze estimators. Other than eye images, several works  1 2 3 exploit both eye and face images in computing gaze direction. Nevertheless, both appearance methods and hybrid extensions require a huge amount of labeled data to achieve their potential in terms of accuracy. As a result of huge label dependence by appearance methods, efforts have been made in the direction of few-shot gaze estimation. In particular, Liu et al. 4 exploit a two-branch network to predict differential gaze between two images and use few calibration samples during inference. Furthermore,  5 disentangle gaze from other nuisance factors via training an encoder-decoder architecture 6 to learn gaze specific representations. Recent approaches 7 8 9 leverage labeled source domain and unsupervised domain adaptation for improving the performance of gaze estimation task on target domain.\nIn a similar spirit, our work attempts to reduce the amount of required label information via learning gaze representations without relying on gaze labels and utilizing multi-view data  .\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Gaze estimation methods are built using large-scale datasets either having 2D target labels   or 3D gaze directions   [ref]1.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
