      "content": "Paper Title: You Can‚Äôt Count on Luck: Why Decision Transformers and RvS Fail in Stochastic Environments\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOffline reinforcement learning (RL) [ref]3 [ref]1   is a promising approach to train agents without requiring online experience in an environment, which is desirable when online experience is expensive or when offline experience is abundant. A recent trend in offline RL has been to use simple approaches that do RL via Supervised Learning (RvS) (e.g., [ref]1 [ref]2   ) rather than typical value-based approaches. RvS algorithms such as Decision Transformer [ref]1 train a model to predict an action based on the current state and an outcome such as a desired future return. These agents ask the question ‚Äúif I assume the desired outcome will happen, in my experience what action do I typically take next.‚Äù These methods are popular due to their simplicity, strong performance on offline benchmark tasks [ref]1 [ref]2, and similarity to large generative models (e.g.,    ) that continue to show stronger performance on more tasks when training larger models on more data. However, as we will show, methods that condition on outcomes such as return can make incorrect decisions in stochastic environments regardless of scale or the amount of data they are trained on. This is because implicitly these methods assume that actions that end up achieving a particular goal are optimal for achieving that goal. This assumption is not true in stochastic environments, where it is possible that the actions taken in the trajectory were actually sub-optimal and that the outcome was only achieved due to lucky environment transitions. For example, consider the gambling environment in Figure¬†1. Though there may be many episodes in which an agent gets a positive return from gambling (a0subscriptùëé0a_{0} or a1subscriptùëé1a_{1}), gambling is sub-optimal since it results in a negative return in expectation while a2subscriptùëé2a_{2} always results in a positive return. Since RvS takes all of these trajectories as expert examples of how to achieve the goal, RvS will act sub-optimally. This limitation of RvS approaches in stochastic environments is well-hidden by the majority of benchmark tasks for offline RL (e.g.,  ), which tend to be deterministic or near-deterministic. Locomotion tasks in MuJoCo  and Atari games in the Arcade Learning Environment  are two such examples.\nWhile deterministic tasks can be solved by replaying promising action sequences, stochastic tasks are significantly less trivial to solve and often more realistic, requiring reactive policies to be learned . Many real-world tasks are stochastic, either inherently or due to partial observability, such as having a conversation, driving a car, or navigating an unknown environment. In their current form, approaches such as Decision Transformer [ref]1 are likely to behave in unexpected ways in such scenarios. One way to view why RvS doesn‚Äôt work in the gambling environment is that when conditioning on trajectories that achieve a positive reward, the model doesn‚Äôt get to see any of the trajectories where the same sequence of actions leads to a negative reward. Due to these unrealistic dynamics, there is no policy that would generate this set of trajectories in the real environment, so it doesn‚Äôt make sense to treat them as expert trajectories. Our insight is that there are certain functions of the trajectory other than return that, when conditioned on, will better preserve the dynamics of the environment. Our approach, called ESPER, realizes this by conditioning on outcomes that are fully determined by the actions of the agent and independent of the uncontrollable stochasticity of the environment. While trajectory return is not such an outcome, we show that the expected return of behavior shown in a trajectory is, and how to learn such a value. The contributions of this work are as follows: We show that RvS-style agents can only reliably achieve outcomes that are independent from environment stochasticity and only depend on information that is under the agent‚Äôs control. We propose a method to learn environment-stochasticity-independent representations of trajectories using adversarial learning, on top of which we label each trajectory with the average return for trajectories with this representation. We introduce several stochastic offline RL benchmark tasks and show that while RvS agents consistently underperform on the conditioned returns, our approach (ESPER, short for environment-stochasticity-independent representations) achieves significantly stronger alignment between target return and actual expected performance. ESPER gets state-of-the-art performance on these tasks, solving all tasks with near-maximum performance and surpassing the performance of even strong value-based methods such as CQL .\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) [ref]3 [ref]1   is a promising approach to train agents without requiring online experience in an environment, which is desirable when online experience is expensive or when offline experience is\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
