      "content": "Paper Title: Automatic Detection of COVID-19 Vaccine Misinformation with Graph Link Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSeveral knowledge embedding models have been widely used in the past decade, e.g. TransE , TransD .\nIn addition to TransE and TransD, several other knowledge graph embedding models have shown promise in recent years, e.g. TransMS  and TuckER [ref]42. We have explored how all these four different knowledge embedding models perform in our framework for misinformation detection as graph link prediction. We briefly describe them before discussing how they were used in a novel neural architecture for twitter misinformation detection as graph link detection. TransE, like all knowledge embedding models, learns an embedding, for each node in the knowledge graph and an embedding for each relation type. Given the MKG, TransE learns an embedding t​ei𝑡subscript𝑒𝑖{te_{i}} for each tweet tisubscript𝑡𝑖t_{i} and an embedding m​ej𝑚subscript𝑒𝑗{me_{j}} for each MisTj, with j𝑗j ranging over all MisTs represented in the MKG. Moreover, TransE considers that the link embedding is a translation vector between the two tweet embeddings representing its arguments.\nThis means that for any tweet tisubscript𝑡𝑖t_{i}, the tweet most likely to be linked to tisubscript𝑡𝑖t_{i} by a link labeled MisTj should be the tweet whose embedding is closest to (t​ei+m​ej)𝑡subscript𝑒𝑖𝑚subscript𝑒𝑗(te_{i}+me_{j}) in the embedding space.\nBy modeling the tweets as points in the embedded space and the MisTs they share as translation vectors, it is possible to measure the plausibility of any potential link labeled as MisTj between any pair of tweets tisubscript𝑡𝑖t_{i} and tksubscript𝑡𝑘t_{k} using the geometric structure of the embedding space: where ||⋅||L​1||\\cdot||_{L1} is the L​1𝐿1L1 norm.\nThe plausibility of a relation between an unconnected tweet tusubscript𝑡𝑢t_{u} and tweet tdsubscript𝑡𝑑t_{d} connected to (or prototypical of a) FCG-x with labels MisTx, represented as a triple, ⟨tu,M​i​s​Tx,td⟩subscript𝑡𝑢𝑀𝑖𝑠subscript𝑇𝑥subscript𝑡𝑑\\langle t_{u},MisT_{x},t_{d}\\rangle, is inversely proportional to the distance in the embedding space between the point predicted by the TransE model, (t​eu+m​ex𝑡subscript𝑒𝑢𝑚subscript𝑒𝑥te_{u}+me_{x}), and the point in the embedding space representing the destination argument of the link labeled as MisTx, i.e. (t​ed𝑡subscript𝑒𝑑te_{d}).\nTransE has the advantage that it is extremely simple to utilize, but interactions between node embeddings and edge embeddings are limited. TransD extends TransE by learning two knowledge embeddings for each node and each edge from a knowledge graph\nsuch that the first embedding represents the “knowledge meaning” of the node or relation while the second embedding is a projection vector (with superscript p), used to construct a dynamic mapping matrix for each node/link pair. Thus, for each tweet from the MKG,\ntisubscript𝑡𝑖t_{i} TransD learns the pair of embedding (t​ei,t​eip)𝑡subscript𝑒𝑖𝑡subscriptsuperscript𝑒𝑝𝑖(te_{i},te^{p}_{i}) and for each link labeled as MisTj, it learns the pair of embeddings (m​ej,m​ejp)𝑚subscript𝑒𝑗𝑚subscriptsuperscript𝑒𝑝𝑗(me_{j},me^{p}_{j}). The pair of knowledge embeddings for the tweet and for the link are learned by using a scoring function that measures the plausibility of a link labeled MisTj between a tweet tisubscript𝑡𝑖t_{i} and a tweet tksubscript𝑡𝑘t_{k}, defined as: where 𝑰𝑰\\bm{I} is the identity matrix. TransD improves upon TransE by modeling the interactions between tweets and the links that span them through their respective knowledge embeddings, such that tweet embeddings change depending on which MisT is being considered for labeling a link. TransMS recognizes the importance of capturing non-linear interactions between nodes and edges in a knowledge graph, and therefore expands on the approach of TransD. TransMS introduces non-linear interactions on both the node and edge knowledge embeddings before the additive translation of TransE is performed, and also adds an edge-specific threshold parameter αjsubscript𝛼𝑗\\alpha_{j}.\nWhen considering the MKG, the knowledge embeddings for the tweet and for the link are learned by using a scoring function that measures the plausibility of a link labeled MisTj between a tweet tisubscript𝑡𝑖t_{i} and a tweet tksubscript𝑡𝑘t_{k}, defined as: where t​a​n​h​(x)𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ𝑥tanh(x) is the non-linear hyperbolic tangent function and αjsubscript𝛼𝑗\\alpha_{j} is a real numbered parameter dependent on each MisT. The operator ⊗tensor-product\\otimes represents the Hadamard product. TransMS improves upon TransD by allowing both the nodes to influence the edge embeddings and the edges to influence the node embeddings. TransMS also introduces non-linearities in these interactions, and allows edge type-specific αjsubscript𝛼𝑗\\alpha_{j} thresholds to be learned. TuckER utilizes a multiplicative approach to learning knowledge embeddings, as opposed to the additive approach of TransE, TransD, and TransMS. TuckER introduces a learned “core tensor” 𝒲∈ℝz×v×z𝒲superscriptℝ𝑧𝑣𝑧\\mathcal{W}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{z\\times v\\times z} which encodes some of the learned knowledge outside of the knowledge embeddings. When considering the MKG, the knowledge embeddings for tweets and for links spanning them are learned by using a scoring function that measures the plausibility of a link labeled MisTj between a tweet tisubscript𝑡𝑖t_{i} and a tweet tksubscript𝑡𝑘t_{k}. The pair of knowledge embeddings for the tweet and for the link are learned in TuckER by using a scoring function that measures the plausibility of a link labeled MisTj between a tweet tisubscript𝑡𝑖t_{i} and a tweet tksubscript𝑡𝑘t_{k}, defined as: where ×nsubscript𝑛\\times_{n} indicates the tensor product along the n-th mode. TuckER approaches the problem of learning knowledge embeddings from a multiplicative perspective, with an additional component in the 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W} tensor which allows for additional shared interactions to be learned between the nodes and edges of the knowledge graph through tensor products. In addition to the knowledge embedding models, we also considered a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) baseline approach. The KNN approach ignores entirely the edge information available in the FCC(Mistj) of each Mistj. Instead, this approach favors tweets that are closest in their representation in the embedding space. Thus, when scoring a link between an unconnected tweet tisubscript𝑡𝑖t_{i}, represented by a knowledge embedding t​ei𝑡subscript𝑒𝑖te_{i}, and any tweet tksubscript𝑡𝑘t_{k}, from the FCC(MisTj), represented as t​ek𝑡subscript𝑒𝑘te_{k}, it computes: where ||⋅||L​2||\\cdot||_{L2} is the L​2𝐿2L2 norm. To predict the link to any MisT of interest, e.g. MisTx, the\nConditionALL, defined in Section 4.1, must be met. This condition is applied because all nodes that are already assigned to all FCGs from the MKG need to be considered when searching in the embedding space for the tweets that are closest to tisubscript𝑡𝑖t_{i}. For the KNN approach, this condition\nrequires that\nthere must be at least Nxsubscript𝑁𝑥N_{x} values of f𝑓f which are larger than a given threshold Txsubscript𝑇𝑥T_{x} for all nodes nxsubscript𝑛𝑥n_{x} connected in the FCG(Mistx). When the condition is satisfied, a link is predicted between\ntisubscript𝑡𝑖t_{i} and MisTx. But the condition may be satisfied by more than one MisT of interest, and thus multiple links may be predicted. This baseline is equivalent to a KNN approach, where the distance metric is the Euclidean distance, and the value of K𝐾K is selected automatically based on (a) the number of MisTs for which ConditionALL is satisfied, which implicitly depends on (b) the development collection available from CoVaxLies, which was used to generate the seed FCGs from the\nMKG. Any of the scoring functions of these four knowledge embedding models or the baseline model using KNN can be used to predict a graph link in the MKG. But, because the tweets use natural language to communicate their message, and each of the MisTs also are expressed in natural language, the subtleties and deep connections expressed in language also need to be captured. The language used in two different tweets from the MKG, that might be linked together need to accounted for. In addition, the language describing the MisT they share needs also to be accounted for when predicting if there is a link. With this in mind, we have designed a neural architecture for Twitter Misinformation Detection through Graph Link Prediction (TMD-GLP), illustrated in Figure 3. Given a MisT mjsubscript𝑚𝑗m_{j}, the TMD-GLP system first performs Word-Piece Tokenization [ref]43 on the textual description of the misinformation target, producing tokens m1j,m2j,…,mljsuperscriptsubscript𝑚1𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑚2𝑗…superscriptsubscript𝑚𝑙𝑗m_{1}^{j},m_{2}^{j},...,m_{l}^{j}, where l𝑙l is the number of word-piece tokens produced.\nWord-Piece Tokenization segments text into word-pieces, where the segmentation is data-driven and based on maximizing the size of frequently occurring sub-word tokens.\nCommon English words remain intact as whole tokens, while uncommon words are segmented into more common sub-word components.\nThis process ensures every word can be segmented into a known vocabulary of sub-word units, and no words are left out-of-vocabulary.\nThe [C​L​S]delimited-[]𝐶𝐿𝑆[CLS] and [S​E​P]delimited-[]𝑆𝐸𝑃[SEP] tokens are placed at the beginning and end of the token sequence respectively, as was done in prior work to denote the beginning and end of the token sequence [ref]43. The word-piece tokens [C​L​S]j,m1j,m2j,…,mlj,[S​E​P]jsuperscriptdelimited-[]𝐶𝐿𝑆𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑚1𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑚2𝑗…superscriptsubscript𝑚𝑙𝑗superscriptdelimited-[]𝑆𝐸𝑃𝑗[CLS]^{j},m_{1}^{j},m_{2}^{j},...,m_{l}^{j},[SEP]^{j} are then provided to the BERT [ref]43 COVID-19 Language Model COVID-Twitter-BERT-v2 [ref]44.\nCOVID-Twitter-BERT-v2 is a pre-trained domain-specific language model, which means that it started with neural weights equal to those of BERT, but was additionally pre-trained on the masked language modeling task [ref]43 for 97 million COVID-19 tweets.\nThis process of further pre-training has been shown to improve performance on downstream tasks in various scientific , biomedical , and social media  domains.\nCOVID-Twitter-BERT-v2 therefore produces contextualized embeddings m​c1j,m​c2j,…,m​cl+2j𝑚superscriptsubscript𝑐1𝑗𝑚superscriptsubscript𝑐2𝑗…𝑚superscriptsubscript𝑐𝑙2𝑗mc_{1}^{j},mc_{2}^{j},...,mc_{l+2}^{j} for the word-piece tokens in the MisT mjsubscript𝑚𝑗m_{j} along with the [C​L​S]jsuperscriptdelimited-[]𝐶𝐿𝑆𝑗[CLS]^{j} and [S​E​P]jsuperscriptdelimited-[]𝑆𝐸𝑃𝑗[SEP]^{j} tokens.\nIn this way,\nwe encode the language describing the MisT using a contextualized embedding m​rj∈ℝ1024𝑚subscript𝑟𝑗superscriptℝ1024mr_{j}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{1024}, where 102410241024 is the contextual embedding size for COVID-Twitter-BERT-V2, which is the first contextualized embedding m​c1j𝑚superscriptsubscript𝑐1𝑗mc_{1}^{j}, representing the initial [C​L​S]jsuperscriptdelimited-[]𝐶𝐿𝑆𝑗[CLS]^{j} token embedding. Similarly, the language used in the tweets tisubscript𝑡𝑖t_{i} and tksubscript𝑡𝑘t_{k} is processed through Word-Piece Tokenization and then represented by contextual embeddings t​ri𝑡subscript𝑟𝑖tr_{i} and t​rk𝑡subscript𝑟𝑘tr_{k} after being processed through COVID-Twitter-BERT-v2.\nBut, it is important to note, that the scoring function f𝑓f of any of the knowledge embedding models that we considered, illustrated in Figure 3, cannot operate directly on the contextual embeddings t​ri𝑡subscript𝑟𝑖tr_{i}, m​rj𝑚subscript𝑟𝑗mr_{j} or t​rk𝑡subscript𝑟𝑘tr_{k}, as they do not have the same dimensions of the knowledge embeddings these models learn. Therefore, in TMD-GLP we needed to consider two forms of projection encoders, capable to project from the contextualized embedding space into the knowledge embedding space. For this purpose, we have relied on the Misinformation Knowledge Embedding Projection Encoder (M-KEPE), using a fully-connected layer to project from m​rj𝑚subscript𝑟𝑗mr_{j} into the necessary knowledge embedding m​ej∈ℝv𝑚subscript𝑒𝑗superscriptℝ𝑣me_{j}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{v} of any of the knowledge embedding models considered. Similarly, we have\nrelied on the Tweet Knowledge Embedding Projection Encoder (T-KEPE) using a different fully-connected layer than M-KEPE. As shown in Figure 3, these encoders produce the arguments of the scoring function, which informs the decision whether the link between the unconnected tweet tisubscript𝑡𝑖t_{i} and a tweet from the FCG for MisTj (or its prototypical tweet) tksubscript𝑡𝑘t_{k} can be predicted, according to the two options described in Section 4.1. If a link is predicted, it receives the label of MisTj. We trained the TMD-GLP system to perform graph-link prediction on the training collection of CoVaxLies described in Section 3.3. Labeled links within the training data were used as positive examples, and we perform negative link sampling to construct negative examples. Negative link sampling consists of corrupting a link triplet (ti,mj,tk)∈Esubscript𝑡𝑖subscript𝑚𝑗subscript𝑡𝑘𝐸(t_{i},m_{j},t_{k})\\in E. This process is performed by randomly sampling a different tweet ts∈VTsubscript𝑡𝑠subscript𝑉𝑇t_{s}\\in V_{T}, where VTsubscript𝑉𝑇V_{T} represents all training tweets, to replace tksubscript𝑡𝑘t_{k}. We ensure (ti,mj,ts)∉Esubscript𝑡𝑖subscript𝑚𝑗subscript𝑡𝑠𝐸(t_{i},m_{j},t_{s})\\not\\in E by re-sampling if we ever sample a link in E𝐸E. This process guarantees that corrupted triplets are not real links. We utilize these negative links for learning, with the goal being to utilize the TMD-GLP system to score labeled links higher than corrupted links.\nMoreover, we optimized the following margin loss to train TMD-GLP when performing graph-link prediction: where γ𝛾\\gamma is a training score threshold which represents the differences between the score of correct links and the incorrect predicted links. The loss ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} is minimized with the ADAM optimizer, a variant of gradient descent.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: widely used in the past decade, e.g. TransE , TransD .\nIn addition to TransE and TransD, several other knowledge graph embedding models have shown promise in recent years, e.g. TransMS  and TuckER [ref]42.
