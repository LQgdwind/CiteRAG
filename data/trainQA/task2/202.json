      "content": "Paper Title: Counterfactual Samples Synthesizing for Robust Visual Question Answering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVisual Question Answering (VQA), i.e., answering natural language questions about the visual content, is one of the core techniques towards complete AI. With the release of multiple large scale VQA datasets (e.g., VQA v1  and v2 [ref]17), VQA has received unprecedented attention and hundreds of models have been developed. However, since the inevitable annotation artifacts in the real image datasets, today’s VQA models always over-rely on superficial linguistic correlations (i.e., language biases)  2 3 [ref]17. For example, a model answering “2” for all “how many X” questions can still get satisfactory performance regardless of the X. Recently, to disentangle the bias factors and clearly monitor the progress of VQA research, a diagnostic benchmark VQA-CP (VQA under Changing Priors)  has been proposed. The VQA-CP deliberately has different question-answer distributions in the train and test splits. The performance of many state-of-the-art VQA models     drop significantly on VQA-CP compared to other datasets. Currently, the prevailing solutions to mitigate the bias issues are ensemble-based methods: they introduce an auxiliary question-only model to regularize the training of targeted VQA model. Specifically, these methods can further be grouped into two sub-types: 1) adversary-based 3 [ref]18 : they train two models in an adversarial manner  , i.e., minimizing the loss of VQA model while maximizing the loss of question-only model. Since the two models are designed to share the same question encoder, the adversary-based methods aim to reduce the language biases by learning a bias-neutral question representation. Unfortunately, the adversarial training scheme brings significant noise into gradients and results in an unstable training process [ref]18. 2) fusion-based   7: they late fuse the predicted answer distributions of the two models, and derive the training gradients based on the fused answer distributions. The design philosophy of the fusion-based methods, is to let the targeted VQA model focuses more on the samples, which cannot be answered correctly by the question-only model. Although the ensemble-based methods have dominated the performance on VQA-CP, it is worth noting that current methods fail to equip them with two indispensable characteristics of an ideal VQA model: 1) visual-explainable: the model should rely on the right visual regions when making decisions, i.e., right for the right reasons 4. As shown in Figure 1 (a), although both two models can predict the correct answer “surfing”, they actually refer to totally different reference regions when making this answer prediction. 2) question-sensitive: the model should be sensitive to the linguistic variations in question. As shown in Figure 1 (b), for two questions with similar sentence structure (e.g., only replacing word “luggage” with “bus”), if the meanings of two questions are different, the model should perceive the discrepancy and make corresponding predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel model-agnostic Counterfactual Samples Synthesizing (CSS) training scheme. The CSS serves as a plug-and-play component to improve the VQA models’ visual-explainable and question-sensitive abilities, even for complex ensemble-based methods. As shown in Figure 2, CSS consists of two different types of samples synthesizing mechanisms: V-CSS and Q-CSS. For V-CSS, it synthesizes a counterfactual image by masking critical objects in the original image. By “critical”, we mean that these objects are important in answering a certain question (e.g., object    for the question “what color is the man’s tie”). Then, the counterfactual image and original question compose a new image-question (VQ) pair. For Q-CSS, it synthesizes a counterfactual question by replacing critical words in the original question with a special token “[MASK]”. Similarly, the counterfactual querstion and original image compose a new VQ pair. Given a VQ pair (from V-CSS or Q-CSS), a standard VQA training sample triplet still needs the corresponding ground-truth answers. To avoid the expensive manual annotations, we design a dynamic answer assigning mechanism to approximate ground-truth answers for all synthesized VQ pairs (e.g., “not green” in Figure 2). Then, we train the VQA models with all original and synthesized samples. After training with numerous complementary samples, the VQA models are forced to focus on critical objects and words. Extensive ablations including both qualitative and quantitative results have demonstrated the effectiveness of CSS. The CSS can be seamlessly incorporated into the ensemble-based methods, which not only improves their both visual-explainable and question-sensitive abilities, but also consistently boosts the performance on VQA-CP. Particularly, by building of top on model LMH , we achieve a new record-breaking performance of 58.95% on VQA-CP v2.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: i.e., answering natural language questions about the visual content, is one of the core techniques towards complete AI.
