      "content": "Paper Title: On Multi-Domain Long-Tailed Recognition, Imbalanced Domain Generalization and Beyond\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare BoDA to a large number of algorithms that span different learning strategies. We group them according to their categories, and provide detailed descriptions for each algorithm below. Vanilla: The empirical risk minimization (ERM) 6 minimizes the sum of errors across all domains and samples. Distributionally robust optimization: Group distributionally robust optimization (GroupDRO) 0 performs ERM while increasing the importance of domains with larger errors. Cross-domain data augmentation: Inter-domain mixup (Mixup)  performs ERM on linear interpolations of examples from random pairs of domains and their labels. Style-agnostic network (SagNet)  disentangles style encodings from image content by randomizing and augmenting styles. Meta-learning: Meta-learning for domain generalization (MLDG)  leverages meta-learning to learn how to generalize across domains. Domain-invariant representation learning: Invariant risk minimization (IRM) [ref]1 learns a feature representation such that the optimal linear classifier on top of that representation matches across domains. Domain adversarial neural networks (DANN)  employ an adversarial network to match feature distributions. Class-conditional DANN (CDANN)  builds upon DANN but further matches the conditional distributions across domains for all labels. Deep correlation alignment (CORAL)  matches the mean and covariance of feature distributions. Maximum mean discrepancy (MMD)  matches the MMD  of feature distributions. Transfer learning: Marginal transfer learning (MTL)  estimates a mean embedding per domain, passed as a second argument to the classifier. Multi-task learning: Gradient matching for domain generalization (Fish) 2 maximizes the inner product between gradients from different domains through a multi-task objective. Imbalanced learning: Focal loss (Focal)  reduces the relative loss for well-classified samples and focuses on difficult samples. Class-balanced loss (CBLoss)  proposes re-weighting by the inverse effective number of samples. The LDAM loss (LDAM)  employs a modified marginal loss that favors minority samples more. Balanced-Softmax (BSoftmax)  extends Softmax to an unbiased estimation that considers the number of samples of each class. Self-supervised pre-training (SSP)  uses self-supervised learning as a first-stage pre-training to alleviate the network dependence on imbalanced labels. Classifier re-training (CRT)  decomposes the representation and classifier learning into two stages, where it fine-tunes the classifier using class-balanced sampling with representation fixed in the second stage.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Meta-learning for domain generalization (MLDG)  leverages meta-learning to learn how to generalize across domains.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
