      "content": "Paper Title: PMSN: A Parallel Multi-compartment Spiking Neuron for Multi-scale Temporal Processing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe human brain, recognized as one of the most sophisticated computational systems on the planet, demonstrates unparalleled energy efficiency and cognitive capabilities. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been proposed as one of the most representative brain-inspired computational models, aiming to mimic the efficient spatiotemporal information processing in the brain . In contrast to traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs) that rely on real-valued neural representation and continuous activation functions, SNNs utilize discrete spike trains to represent information and inherently support efficient event-driven computation. Furthermore, spiking neurons can incorporate rich neuronal dynamics for effective temporal processing [ref]2. At present, SNNs have demonstrated competitive performance and substantial energy savings compared to traditional ANNs [ref]3 [ref]4  in a wide range of applications, such as image classification  , audio processing  , and robotic control 0 1. While SNNs have gained increasing attention in recent years, their main applications have been primarily confined to computer vision tasks that involve limited temporal dynamics, such as classifying static images or data collected from dynamic vision sensor (DVS) with artificially added saccade motion 2 3. However, real-world scenarios are often more challenging as they involve sensory signals with information that varies across different timescales. For instance, speech recognition tasks often necessitate models to establish dependencies across various timescales, encompassing phonemes, words, and sentences.\nWhile several algorithms have been developed to enhance the temporal processing capacity of SNNs 4 5 6 7, most of them still struggle to establish diverse scales of temporal representations, resulting in poor performance in complex temporal processing tasks. Considering the remarkable temporal processing capabilities observed in biological neurons, it is crucial to carefully examine their computational mechanisms. In the context of large-scale SNNs, the majority of existing spiking neurons are modeled as single-compartment systems, such as the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model 8. In these single-compartment models, the neuronal dynamics are simplified to first-order dynamics of a single state variable - the membrane potential, disregarding any interactions among substructures within a single neuron. This simplification reduces computational complexity but limits their ability to generate complex neuronal dynamics. In contrast, real biological neurons can be better modeled by the multi-compartment neuron models 9   , which divide a single neuron into several interconnected subunits with interactions among them. Extensive neuroscience experiments have evidenced the important roles of these interactive dynamics in temporal processing. For example, the nonlinear interactions among ion channels endows neurons with significant computational power for processing temporal signals  .\nAdditionally, the interaction among coupled dendritic components acts as temporal filters for signals traveling from dendrites to the soma, thereby facilitating the temporal sequence detection  .\nWhile detailed multi-compartment models show great potential in temporal processing, they are computationally expensive due to the intricate anatomical structures of dendritic trees and high-dimensional ionic properties. Consequently, they are not well suited for constructing large-scale SNNs to tackle real-world pattern recognition tasks. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop an efficient spiking neuron model that strikes a balance between computational complexity and the ability to capture the valuable interaction among different substructures of a biological neuron. Recently, several simplified compartmental spiking neuron models have been specifically designed for deep SNNs. For instance, a two-compartment model was introduced to simulate double-exponential threshold decay , and a dendritic neuron model was proposed to endow multiple dendritic compartments with heterogeneous decaying time constants . Furthermore, inspired by the well-known Pinsky-Rinzel (P-R) pyramidal neuron located in the CA3 region of the hippocampus, a two-compartment LIF model was proposed, which divides a single neuron into dendritic and soma compartments . Nevertheless, there are three significant challenges that remain to be tackled. Firstly, these models overlook the valuable recurrent interactions among different compartments, limiting the complexity of neuronal dynamics that can be generated. Secondly, these meticulously hand-crafted models often lack an effective method to adjust the level of abstraction, as they are limited by a predetermined compartment number. This restricts their ability to handle tasks with varying complexities. Thirdly, compared to single-compartment models, the increased temporal dynamics in these models result in significantly slower training processes when using the back-propagation through time (BPTT) algorithm. Consequently, these models demonstrate limited scalability to larger networks for tackling challenging real-world temporal processing tasks, particularly those involving long sequences. To tackle these challenges, we propose a generalized multi-compartment spiking neuron model for SNNs that integrates essential recurrent interactions among interconnected compartments. Moreover, the number of compartments can be flexibly adjusted in the proposed model, allowing for adaptation to the different temporal complexities required in real-world tasks.\nFurthermore, considering the significant constraint on training speed caused by increasing neuronal dynamics in the proposed model, we introduce two temporal parallelization techniques to accelerate the training process. Firstly, for the linear recurrence associated with the neuron charging process, we draw inspiration from the recent studies in deep learning that have revealed that recurrent models with linear recurrence can be effectively parallelized in the temporal domain   . Specifically, we design the neuron charging process to function as a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. Furthermore, for the non-linear recurrence associated with the neuron firing and reset process, we introduce a novel membrane potential reset strategy to decouple the temporal dependency. Altogether, these strategies enable efficient parallel training of our model over time. The proposed design methodologies have led to the development of a novel Parallel Multi-compartment Spiking Neuron (PMSN) model as illustrated in Fig. 1. The PMSN model effectively captures multi-scale temporal information through the interaction among neuronal compartments. Both theoretical analysis and dynamics visualizations are provided to substantiate the efficacy of the PMSN model in establishing temporal dependencies across various timescales. Moreover, the proposed PMSN model offers a significant improvement in training speed, particularly when deployed on GPU-accelerated machine learning (ML) frameworks. The main contributions of this work are summarized as follows: We propose a generalized multi-compartment spiking neuron model for deep SNNs that incorporates valuable interactions among different neuronal compartments. The number of compartments in this model can be flexibly adjusted to represent temporal information across diverse timescales. We develop two temporal parallelization techniques for the proposed model, resulting in a remarkable training acceleration of over 10×10\\times times on GPU-accelerated ML frameworks. Our comprehensive experimental studies on numerous benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed model not only showcases superior temporal processing capacity but also offers a favorable computational cost when compared to single-compartment models.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: spike trains to represent information and inherently support efficient event-driven computation.
