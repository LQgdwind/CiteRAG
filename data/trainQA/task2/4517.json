      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Entity Linking Features for Emerging Entities\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFully-supervised EL has been well studied by abundant literature  [ref]2, where “fully-supervised” means not only the training of EL models is supervised by some documents annotated for EL specifically (e.g., AIDA-CoNLL 3), but also the estimation of EL features for entities is supervised by a labeled corpus (e.g., Wikipedia).\nSpecifically, prior probability provides the probability of the appearance of a candidate entity given the mention without considering the context where the mention appears. It is usually estimated using some structured information provided by Wikipedia such as hyperlinks in Wikipedia articles and pageview counts of the candidate entity. It plays a significant role in most EL methods 2 3 [ref]7 4 0 5 due to its strong effectiveness.\nRelatedness score (e.g., WLM ) is adopted by lots of EL works 3 2 6 7 1,8 to calculate the topical coherence between candidate entities. WLM is defined under the assumption that two entities tend to be related if there are many Wikipedia articles that link to both. Additionally, with the advent of deep learning, entity embedding that encodes each candidate entity as a dense and low-dimensional vector has been applied in many deep learning based EL methods [ref]2 [ref]7 9      to implicitly represent the semantic and syntactic properties of the candidate entity. Rich data existing in Wikipedia (e.g., textual entity description [ref]7  , entity context  , and hyperlink structure of entity pages [ref]7  9) are usually leveraged to learn entity embeddings. To sum up, the estimation of these EL features for entities depends on various structures existing in Wikipedia. Since manual annotation is time-consuming, weakly-supervised setting for EL was considered in recent works  . In this setting, KBs like Wikipedia are available while documents in the target domain are unlabeled (i.e., mentions are linked without any labeled examples). Specifically, Le and Titov  performed message passing based on the Wikipedia link subgraph corresponding to the document to construct a high recall list of candidates for each mention. What’s more, Le and Titov  leveraged entity type information provided by Freebase  to generate entity embeddings for weakly-supervised linking. In addition, zero-shot learning  has also been considered in the field of entity linking. The key idea of zero-shot is to train the model on a domain with rich labeled data resources and apply it to a new domain with minimal data . In the setting of zero-shot EL  0 , the entity being linked with has not been seen during training and is only defined by a textual entity description from its corresponding Wikipedia page. Specifically, Logeswaran et al. 0 and Wu et al.  utilized a BERT-based  cross-encoder to perform joint encoding of mentions and entities. The cross-encoder takes the concatenation of the mention context and the textual entity description to produce a scalar score for each candidate entity. Wu et al.  and Li et al.  leveraged a BERT-based  bi-encoder which uses two separate encoders to learn vectors of the mention context and the textual entity description respectively. The candidate entity ranking is performed by comparing dot-products of representation vectors. In this paper, we consider a completely different setting from the settings introduced above. In our setting, EEs are newly discovered and have not be included in Wikipedia yet. Accordingly, no data from Wikipedia could be provided for EEs, which makes the existing EL models unable to link ambiguous mentions with EEs correctly as the absence of their EL features. Due to the fact that the world is constantly evolving and newly emerging entities are constantly being discovered, such a setting is essential and meaningful for real-world applications.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Fully-supervised EL has been well studied by abundant literature  [ref]2, where “fully-supervised” means not only the training of EL models is supervised by some documents annotated for EL specifically (e.g., AIDA-CoNLL 3), but also the estimation of EL features\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
