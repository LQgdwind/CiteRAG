      "content": "Paper Title: SB-MTL: Score-based Meta Transfer-Learning for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are three key sets of methods used in few-shot learning: metric-based methods, transfer-based methods and data augmentation. Metric-based methods aim to learn a metric function ϕmsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑚\\phi_{m} that can be used to classify query images based on their distances from the few support images. The approach can be generalized in the following way . Let the feature encoder be ϕfsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑓\\phi_{f}. Let a query image’s feature vector be ϕf​(Xq)∈ℝdsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑓subscript𝑋𝑞superscriptℝ𝑑\\phi_{f}(X_{q})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d} and let the support image set’s feature vectors form the matrix ϕf​(XS)∈ℝNs×dsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑓subscript𝑋𝑆superscriptℝsubscript𝑁𝑠𝑑\\phi_{f}(X_{S})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N_{s}\\times d}. Then, The training objective is cross-entropy loss L​(Yq,Y^q)𝐿subscript𝑌𝑞subscript^𝑌𝑞L(Y_{q},\\hat{Y}_{q}). A popular metric-based method is prototypical networks 8, which generates mean-centroids “prototypes” using support examples. Further classification of query examples is performed using a nearest centroid approach in Euclidean space. A natural extension of this method introduces a Relation Network [ref]31 that learns a deep distance metric to compare the feature vectors. Other metric learning methods include learning embeddings that can generalize under a linear support vector machine . The key metric-based method that we use is Graph Neural Network. Graph-based convolutions can create more flexible representations of data, which can be a benefit when there is no inherent reason to assume an Euclidean structure to the data . Moreover, 7 shows that previous metric-based methods such as Protypical Networks and Relation Networks have corresponding graph representations with fixed weights. We expand on this key method later. Transfer learning involves reusing features learned from base classes 4. This is typically performed by fine-tuning a pre-trained model to perform well on the unseen classes. Transdusctive fine-tuning uses batch normalization  statistics of all samples in the episode for prediction rather than individually predicting the label for each query sample independently. Surprisingly, applying transdusctive fine-tuning on a simple pre-trained model has comparable performance to previous metric-learning methods . A simple extension of fine-tuning would be to learn to fine-tune. Methods such as Model Agnostic Meta Learner (MAML)  learn an internal representation that can be fine-tuned on new tasks using a few gradient steps. First-order approximations to the MAML, such as Reptile 3, trains faster but perform as well on established benchmarks. Other more complex methods include a few-shot optimisation approach that applies an LSTM-based meta-learner model to learn the optimization strategies used to train another learner network 5. We apply the first-order MAML algorithm, together with transdusctive fine-tuning, to learn how to fine-tune our feature encoder. Data augmentation generates more images from the sparse support images to improve generalization. Methods range from mechanical augmentations such as rotation, jitter and crops 0 to using generative adversarial networks to learn complex augmentations  . Despite the obvious benefits of data augmentation for overcoming domain shifts and sparse samples, augmentation during fine-tuning has not been applied to previous work in CD-FSL.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: using support examples.
