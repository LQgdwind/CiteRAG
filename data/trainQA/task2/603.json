      "content": "Paper Title: Accuracy Prediction with Non-neural Model for Neural Architecture Search\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe first analyze the performance of GBDT as predictor using NASBench-101. NASBench-101 is a dataset for evaluating NAS algorithms, which eliminates the efforts of training and evaluating candidate architectures. It defines a narrow search space containing only 423​k423𝑘423k CNN architectures and each architecture has been trained and evaluated on CIFAR-10 following exactly the same pipeline and setting. Thus, one can get architecture-accuracy pairs effortless via directly querying from the dataset, and use them to quickly evaluate a NAS algorithm and fairly compare it with other algorithms. The search space is graph-like structure following  [ref]25 [ref]19 which involves candidate connections between different nodes besides operations. We follow the encoding guide by the authors to represent the architecture in a sequence . For each node, we use its adjacent vector concatenated with its operation to represent it. Standardization is used to rescale the accuracy when training predictors. We randomly sample 110011001100 architecture-accuracy pairs from the dataset. 100010001000 of them are used as training set and the remaining 100100100 pairs are used as test set. We train a GBDT model based on LightGBM  with 100100100 trees and 313131 leaves per tree. We also evaluate LSTM, GCN and Transfomer based accuracy predictors as baselines. For LSTM based predictor, we follow NAO [ref]22 and use a single layer LSTM of hidden size 161616 followed by two fully connected layers of hidden size 646464. For GCN based accuracy predictor, we follow  with a 3-layer GCN of hidden size 144144144 followed by a fully connected layer of hidden size 128128128. For Transformer based accuracy predictor, we follow  and use a 4-layer Transformer model. All the models are trained on the same training set and tested on the same test set described above. To evaluate the predictors, we compute the pairwise accuracy following [ref]22 on the held out test set via ∑x1∈X,x2∈X𝟙f​(x1)≥f​(x2)​𝟙y1≥y2|X|​(|X|−1)/2subscriptformulae-sequencesubscript𝑥1𝑋subscript𝑥2𝑋subscript1𝑓subscript𝑥1𝑓subscript𝑥2subscript1subscript𝑦1subscript𝑦2𝑋𝑋12\\frac{\\sum_{x_{1}\\in X,x_{2}\\in X}\\mathbbm{1}_{f(x_{1})\\geq f(x_{2})}\\mathbbm{1}_{y_{1}\\geq y_{2}}}{|X|(|X|-1)/2}, where 𝟙1\\mathbbm{1} is the 0-1 indicator function. We run each setting for 100100100 times and report the average results in Table 2. It shows that the first two neural network based predictors (Transformer and LSTM) are easy to overfit. Even after careful hyper-parameter tuning, Transformer still shows severe overfitting, and LSTM has some improvements but still archives lower test accuracy than GBDT. GCN achieves good performance as we use the already tuned setting for NASBench by . Non-neural predictor (GBDT) achieves better prediction accuracy (82%percent8282\\%) than neural networks (Transformer, LSTM, GCN). Note that graph-like architectures can not only be well modeled by GCN, but also be well modeled by GBDT which treats them as tabular data. However, training a GBDT model is much faster than training neural models and do not require much design of the neural predictor architecture or tuning of the hyper-parameters.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: effortless via directly querying from the dataset, and use them to quickly evaluate a NAS algorithm and fairly compare it with other algorithms.
