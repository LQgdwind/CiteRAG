      "content": "Paper Title: Tab2KG: Semantic Table Interpretation with Lightweight Semantic Profiles\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA vast amount of data is currently published in a tabular format   [ref]3. Typically, this data does not possess any machine-readable semantics. Semantic table interpretation is an essential step to make this data usable for a wide variety of applications, with data analytics workflows (DAWs) as a prominent example . DAWs include data mining algorithms and sophisticated deep learning architectures, and require a large amount of heterogeneous data as an input.\nTypically, DAWs treat tabular data as character sequences and numbers\nand potentially miss important information that has not been made available explicitly. This practice can lead to error-prone analytics processes and results, particularly when data analytics frameworks utilize the data from various heterogeneous sources. Therefore, DAWs can substantially profit from the semantic interpretation of the involved data tables  . In this context, semantic table interpretation aims to transform the input data table into a semantic data graph. In this process, table columns are mapped to a domain ontology’s classes and properties; table cell values are transformed into literals, forming the data graph – a network of semantic statements, typically encoded in RDF.\nIn the context of DAWs, semantic table interpretation can bring several advantages. First, an abstraction from tabular data to semantic concepts and relations can guide domain experts in the DAW creation . Second, validation options (e.g., type inference) that become available through the semantic table interpretation can increase the robustness of DAWs . Third, semantic descriptions can be employed to facilitate the explainability of the data analytics results . Finally, semantic table interpretation adds structure directly usable for knowledge inference [ref]9. The existing approaches to semantic table interpretation do not adequately support the interpretation of tabular data for DAWs.\nAt the core of such approaches (e.g., 0 1 2) is the instance lookup task, where table cells are linked to known instances in a target knowledge graph, with DBpedia 3 being a popular cross-domain target. Subsequent steps such as property mapping are based on the results of this lookup step. However, as shown by Ritze et al. 4, only about 3%percent33\\% of the tables contained in the 3.5 billion HTML pages of the Common Crawl Web Corpus111http://commoncrawl.org/ can be matched to DBpedia. In the context of DAW, the input data typically represents new instances (e.g., sensor observations, current road traffic events, …), and substantial overlap between the tabular data values and entities within existing knowledge graphs cannot be expected. In this article, we present Tab2KG – a novel semantic table interpretation approach. Tab2KG aims to transform a data table into a semantic data graph.\nAs a backbone of the data graph, Tab2KG relies on an existing domain ontology that defines the concepts and relations in the target domain.\nTo facilitate the transformation, Tab2KG introduces original lightweight semantic profiles for domains and data tables.\nDomain profiles enrich ontology relations and represent domain characteristics. A domain profile associates relations with feature vectors representing data types and statistical characteristics such as value distributions.\nTo transform a data table, Tab2KG first creates a data table profile.\nThen, Tab2KG uses the domain and data table profiles to transform the table into a data graph using a novel one-shot learning approach. Lightweight semantic profiles generated by Tab2KG can be utilized as compact domain representations\nand complement and enrich existing dataset catalogs. Such profiles can be generated automatically from the existing datasets and described using the DCAT222https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/ and the SEAS333https://ci.mines-stetienne.fr/seas/index.html vocabularies to enable their reusability. We believe that lightweight semantic profiles presented in this article are an essential contribution that can benefit a wide range of semantic applications beyond semantic table interpretation. In summary, Tab2KG is driven by the following three goals, which distinguish Tab2KG from traditional semantic table interpretation approaches: Interpretation of previously unseen data: Tab2KG can interpret domain-specific tables in the common case where the table values are not yet present in existing knowledge graphs. Usage of lightweight semantic profiles: Tab2KG relies on lightweight semantic profiles with profile features which can be easily modeled as part of data catalogs (e.g., histograms and data types). Generalisation through one-shot learning: Tab2KG generalises towards new domain ontologies with a one-shot learning approach. Consequently, our contributions presented in this article are as follows: We introduce lightweight semantic domain and table profiles. Domain profiles enrich relations of domain ontologies and serve as a lightweight domain representation. Semantic table profiles summarize data tables facilitating effective semantic table interpretation. We propose the Tab2KG approach to transform tabular data into a data graph with one-shot learning based on semantic profiles. We evaluate the proposed method on several real-world datasets.\nOur evaluation results demonstrate that Tab2KG outperforms state-of-the-art semantic table interpretation baselines. We make the scripts for creating lightweight semantic profiles and transforming data tables into data graphs publicly available444https://github.com/sgottsch/Tab2KG. The structure of this article is as follows: In Section 2, we introduce a running example used throughout this article. Then, in Section 3, we define the problem of semantic table interpretation, followed by the definition and creation of domain and data table profiles (Section 4).\nIn Section 5, we describe our proposed Tab2KG approach and its implementation (Section 6).\nWe present evaluation setup and results in Sections 7 and 8, followed by a discussion of our profile-based approach in Section 9. Then, we discuss related work in Section 10. Finally, we provide a conclusion in Section 11.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: A vast amount of data is currently published in a tabular format   [ref]3.
