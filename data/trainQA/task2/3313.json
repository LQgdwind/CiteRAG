      "content": "Paper Title: Weakly Supervised Scene Text Detection using Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOnly a few works have been published that make use of RL as the main algorithm component for detection. They mostly target object detection but can often be transferred to text detection as well. Most of the methods aim to build a faster top-down alternative to the bottom-up region proposal based object detection, which often requires the analysis of thousands of regions per image . Caicedo et al. [ref]13 were the first to develop such an active search detector and also laid the groundwork for the first RL text detection algorithm proposed by Wang et al.  as well as for our algorithm design. \nThey use deep Q-learning to learn a RL policy that manipulates a bounding box on top of an image until it covers the sought-after object. A similar approach was followed by Mathe et al. [ref]24. However, their algorithm uses a stochastic policy that decides on fixation points in an image, instead of transforming a bounding box. Kong et al.  improve Caicedo et al.’s work by adapting their approach to a multi-agent collaborative RL setting. Instead of a single, multiple agents search the image for objects, trained jointly via gated cross connections. Bueno et al. [ref]25 also try to improve upon [ref]13. Before their RL agent begins its visual search the image is zoomed into one of 5 predefined regions. This hierarchical image search allows for detection with fewer steps. Another variant of object detection RL was introduced by Jie et al. . They base their approach on a tree-search. Starting with the entire image as the root node of a tree, a scaling and a translation action are chosen at each tree level. The leaf node representing the best bounding box is then selected as the final detection.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: the methods aim to build a faster top-down alternative to the bottom-up region proposal based object detection, which often requires the analysis of thousands of regions per image .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
