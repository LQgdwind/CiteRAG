In this section\nwe propose suitable runtime complexity notions for LCTRSs. Following common notions in complexity analysis ,\nthe derivation height of a term t𝑡t wrt. a binary relation →→\\to is\ndefined as follows:\n𝖽𝗁​(t0,→):=sup{k∣∃t1,…,tk.t0→…→tk}assign𝖽𝗁subscript𝑡0→supremumconditional-set𝑘formulae-sequencesubscript𝑡1…subscript𝑡𝑘→subscript𝑡0…→subscript𝑡𝑘\\mathsf{dh}(t_{0},\\to)\\mathrel{:=}\\sup\\,\\{k\\mid\\exists\\,t_{1},\\dots,t_{k}.\\ t_{0}\\to\\dots\\to t_{k}\\}.\nWe assume that an LCTRS ℛℛ\\mathcal{R} is associated with a unique\ninitial state (t0,φ0)subscript𝑡0subscript𝜑0(t_{0},\\varphi_{0}) such that φ0subscript𝜑0\\varphi_{0} is a\nconstraint and\nt0=𝗂𝗇𝗂𝗍​(x¯)subscript𝑡0𝗂𝗇𝗂𝗍¯𝑥t_{0}=\\mathsf{init}(\\overline{x}) is the\ninitial term, for a vector of input variables x¯=(x1,…,xn)¯𝑥subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛\\overline{x}=({x_{1}},\\dots,{x_{n}}) and a function symbol 𝗂𝗇𝗂𝗍𝗂𝗇𝗂𝗍\\mathsf{init} that\ndoes not occur on any right-hand side.\nThe intention is that we consider only rewrite sequences starting\nat t0​σsubscript𝑡0𝜎t_{0}\\sigma, such that σ𝜎\\sigma is a valuation that respects φ0subscript𝜑0\\varphi_{0}.\nSometimes s0subscript𝑠0s_{0} will be used as a shorthand for (t0,φ0)subscript𝑡0subscript𝜑0(t_{0},\\varphi_{0}).

Dependency pairs are commonly used in termination and complexity analysis\nof rewrite systems.\nFor termination of LCTRSs they were already used in earlier work .\nFor complexity analysis, stronger notions were developed for standard\nrewriting: dependency tuples (DTs) ,\nweak ,\nand grouped dependency pairs .\nSince we consider innermost rewriting, we can use an LCTRS\nvariant of dependency tuples.\nTo that end, for every defined symbol f𝑓f we consider a fresh symbol\nf♯superscript𝑓♯f^{\\sharp}, and for a term t=f​(t1,…,tn)𝑡𝑓subscript𝑡1…subscript𝑡𝑛t=f({t_{1}},\\dots,{t_{n}}) write\nt♯superscript𝑡♯t^{\\sharp} to denote f♯​(t1,…,tn)superscript𝑓♯subscript𝑡1…subscript𝑡𝑛f^{\\sharp}({t_{1}},\\dots,{t_{n}}).

The DG is not computable in general, but approximation techniques\nare well-known    .\nFor instance, the graph in Sect. 2 constitutes a dependency\ngraph approximation for the LCTRS from Ex. 1.\nFollowing Noschiniski et al. , we assume particular interpretation\nfunctions for the tuple operators ⟨…⟩delimited-⟨⟩…\\langle\\dots\\rangle.\nTo this end, let a DT-measure interpretation ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} be a measure\ninterpretation that interprets\n⟨t1,…,tk⟩ℳ=t1+⋯+tksuperscriptsubscript𝑡1…subscript𝑡𝑘ℳsubscript𝑡1⋯subscript𝑡𝑘\\langle{t_{1}},\\dots,{t_{k}}\\rangle^{\\mathcal{M}}=t_{1}+\\dots+t_{k}, for all k⩾0𝑘0k\\geqslant 0.

A triple P=((t,φ),𝒟,ℛ)𝑃𝑡𝜑𝒟ℛP=((t,\\varphi),\\mathcal{D},\\mathcal{R}) of a constrained term (t,φ)𝑡𝜑(t,\\varphi),\na set of DTs 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}, and an LCTRS ℛℛ\\mathcal{R} is called a (complexity) problem.\nFollowing Brockschmidt et al. [ref]8, we next define time and size bound approximations. For a complexity problem ((t,φ),𝒟,ℛ)𝑡𝜑𝒟ℛ((t,\\varphi),\\mathcal{D},\\mathcal{R}) with x¯=𝒱​a​r¯​(t)¯𝑥¯𝒱𝑎𝑟𝑡\\overline{x}=\\overline{\\mathcal{V}ar}(t),\na function T:𝒟→UB:𝑇→𝒟UBT\\colon\\mathcal{D}\\to\\textup{UB} is a runtime approximation if,\nfor all ρ∈𝒟𝜌𝒟\\rho\\in\\mathcal{D} and m¯∈ℕn¯𝑚superscriptℕ𝑛\\overline{m}\\in\\mathbb{N}^{n}, In words, a runtime approximation T​(ρ)𝑇𝜌T(\\rho) over-approximates how often a\nDT ρ∈𝒟𝜌𝒟\\rho\\in\\mathcal{D} can be used in a rewrite sequence starting from the initial state, expressed in terms of the input variables.\nFor instance, consider Ex. 1 and let (1#)superscript1#(1^{\\#}) be the DT corresponding\nto rule (1)1(1). Then the function T𝑇T such that\nT​(1#)=1𝑇superscript1#1T(1^{\\#})=1 and T​(ρ)​(|x0|,|y0|,|z0|)=|x0|2𝑇𝜌subscript𝑥0subscript𝑦0subscript𝑧0superscriptsubscript𝑥02T(\\rho)(|x_{0}|,|y_{0}|,|z_{0}|)=|x_{0}|^{2}\nfor all other DTs ρ∈𝒟𝜌𝒟\\rho\\in\\mathcal{D}\nis a valid (though not optimal) runtime approximation. For a complexity problem ((t,φ),𝒟,ℛ)𝑡𝜑𝒟ℛ((t,\\varphi),\\mathcal{D},\\mathcal{R}),\nthe set of entry variables EV is the set of all\ntuples (ρ,y)𝜌𝑦(\\rho,y) such that\nρ∈𝒟𝜌𝒟\\rho\\in\\mathcal{D} and y∈𝒱​a​r​(l​h​s​(ρ))𝑦𝒱𝑎𝑟𝑙ℎ𝑠𝜌y\\in\\mathcal{V}ar(lhs(\\rho)).

A size approximation over-approximates how large a\nvariable in the left-hand side of a rule\nin 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} can get in a rewrite sequence from the initial state,\nagain expressed in terms of the input variables.\nA tuple (T,S)𝑇𝑆(T,S) is a bound approximation for\na complexity problem P𝑃P if T𝑇T and S𝑆S are runtime and size\napproximations for P𝑃P.\nWe next define a complexity framework in the spirit of Avanzini and\nMoser . Given a complexity problem P=(s0,𝒟,ℛ)𝑃subscript𝑠0𝒟ℛP=(s_{0},\\mathcal{D},\\mathcal{R}), a (complexity) judgement is a statement\n⊢P:(T,S){\\vdash\\,}{P}\\colon{(T,S)}, for functions T:𝒟→UB:𝑇→𝒟UBT:\\mathcal{D}\\to\\textup{UB} and\nS:EV→UB:𝑆→EVUBS:\\textup{EV}\\to\\textup{UB}.\nThe judgement is valid if (T,S)𝑇𝑆(T,S) is a bound\napproximation for P𝑃P.\nA complexity processor is an inference rule on complexity\njudgements of the following form: and it is sound\nif ⊢P:(T,S){\\vdash\\,}{P}\\colon{(T,S)} is valid whenever all ⊢Pi:(Ti,Si){\\vdash\\,}{P_{i}}\\colon{(T_{i},S_{i})}\nare valid. For a problem P=(s0,𝒟,ℛ)𝑃subscript𝑠0𝒟ℛP=(s_{0},\\mathcal{D},\\mathcal{R}) with initial state s0=(𝗂𝗇𝗂𝗍​(x¯),φ)subscript𝑠0𝗂𝗇𝗂𝗍¯𝑥𝜑s_{0}=(\\mathsf{init}(\\overline{x}),\\varphi),\na DT ℓ→r​[ψ]∈𝒟→ℓ𝑟delimited-[]𝜓𝒟\\ell\\to r~{}[\\psi]\\in\\mathcal{D} is initial if 𝗋𝗈𝗈𝗍​(ℓ)=𝗂𝗇𝗂𝗍#𝗋𝗈𝗈𝗍ℓsuperscript𝗂𝗇𝗂𝗍#\\mathsf{root}(\\ell)=\\mathsf{init}^{\\#}.\nThe initial processor for P𝑃P is given by where T​(ρ)=1𝑇𝜌1T(\\rho)=1 if ρ𝜌\\rho is initial and T​(ρ)=ω𝑇𝜌𝜔T(\\rho)=\\omega otherwise; and\nSω​(ρ,x)=ωsubscript𝑆𝜔𝜌𝑥𝜔S_{\\omega}(\\rho,x)=\\omega for all (ρ,x)∈EV𝜌𝑥EV(\\rho,x)\\in\\textup{EV}.\nSince 𝗂𝗇𝗂𝗍#superscript𝗂𝗇𝗂𝗍#\\mathsf{init}^{\\#} does not occur on any right-hand side by assumption,\nthe processor Initial is sound. For instance, the DT\n𝗂𝗇𝗂𝗍#​(x,y,z)→𝗆#​(x,y,z)→superscript𝗂𝗇𝗂𝗍#𝑥𝑦𝑧superscript𝗆#𝑥𝑦𝑧\\mathsf{init}^{\\#}(x,y,z)\\to\\mathsf{m}^{\\#}(x,y,z) originating from rule (1)\nin Ex. 1 is initial.\nFor a problem P=(s0,𝒟,ℛ)𝑃subscript𝑠0𝒟ℛP=(s_{0},\\mathcal{D},\\mathcal{R}) and an expression C∈UB𝐶UBC\\in\\textup{UB}, we sometimes write\n⊢P:((C)Σ,S){\\vdash\\,}{P}\\colon{((C)_{\\Sigma},S)} to express that there is a\nruntime approximation T𝑇T such that ⊢P:(T,S){\\vdash\\,}{P}\\colon{(T,S)} and\nC=∑ρ∈𝒟T​(ρ)𝐶subscript𝜌𝒟𝑇𝜌C=\\sum_{\\rho\\in\\mathcal{D}}T(\\rho). The next result states that valid judgements bound the runtime complexity\nof LCTRSs. It can be proven in a similar way as [4, Theorem 6], using\nthe properties of dependency tuples for innermost rewriting.
