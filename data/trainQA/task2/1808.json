      "content": "Paper Title: PATE-AAE: Incorporating Adversarial Autoencoder into Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles for Spoken Command Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n(1) Dataset and Classifier Model: A large-scale dataset (∼similar-to\\sim100k training samples) for the partition process is needed in our experiments. Therefore, we have chosen the Google Speech Commands V2 [ref]19 task, which contains 105,829 utterances of 35 words from 2,618 speakers with a sampling rate of 16 kHz. The audio length per sample clip is 1 second for a total amount of 55.555.555.5 hours. We split the dataset into I𝐼I=200  disjoint subsets to train individual teacher classifiers following the procedure indicated in Eq. (7). We use the mel-spectrogram feature with an 80-band mel-scale and 1024 points of discrete Fourier transform as inputs to the classifiers. For a fair comparison, both teacher and student classifiers use an identical self-attention [ref]35 and U-Net  based neural network proposed in the recent work , which has shown benchmark prediction accuracy on the selected speech commands dataset.\n\n(2) Encoder-Decoder Model:\nFor encoder-decoder inputs, we use standard 13 MFCC at a sampling rate of 100 Hz from 80 log-mel filter-bank features on training (x𝑥x) and synthetic (u𝑢u) data. We carefully build our encoder-decoder upon a WaveNet-based autoencoder presented in , which has shown competitive performance for unsupervised speech synthesis tasks. As shown in Fig 3(a), our encoder has four network blocks associated 768 input units, which include the first ResNet layer, a convolution layer with a stride scale = 2, the second ResNet layer, and a Dense layer with ReLU activation. The latent representation z𝑧z is computed by outputs (μ,σ𝜇𝜎\\mu,\\sigma) from two linear layers with 128 units. As shown in Fig 3(b), our decoder applied a randomized dropout layer from an output of the discriminator, which is selected from a latent vector (z𝑧z) or a random vector (η𝜂\\eta). The output vector is then upsampled 320 times to fit the 16 kHz sampling rate for WaveNet decoding. Finally, we follow the same setting with  for running two cycles of WaveNet with 20 convolution layers followed by a 256-ReLU layer. We follow μ𝜇\\mu-law companding transformation [ref]37  with 256 quantization levels to generate raw 16k Hz audio. (3) Synthesis and Classification Evaluation Metrics:\nFor the speech synthesis task, the Frechet Inception Distance (FID)  is selected to evaluate the sample quality that computes the Frechet Distance  between two multivariate Gaussian distributions for the synthetic and real samples. We follow a standard FID setup in  to evaluate the quality of over 10,000 synthetic speech samples generated from random noise. For the speech command classification task, classification accuracy is used to evaluate the student model. We train each privacy-preserving model 20 times and report its average prediction accuracy. \n\n\n\nprivacy target (ε𝜀\\varepsilon)\n0.01\n0.1\n1\n10\n100\n\nDP-GAN \n35.2±plus-or-minus\\pm0.5\n32.2±plus-or-minus\\pm0.6\n28.8±plus-or-minus\\pm0.4\n26.7±plus-or-minus\\pm0.3\n24.9±plus-or-minus\\pm0.3\n\nPATE-GAN \n33.4±plus-or-minus\\pm0.5\n30.1±plus-or-minus\\pm0.4\n27.9±plus-or-minus\\pm0.3\n26.0±plus-or-minus\\pm0.3\n24.3±plus-or-minus\\pm0.1\n\nPATE-AAE\n30.2±plus-or-minus\\pm0.4\n28.6±plus-or-minus\\pm0.3\n26.3±plus-or-minus\\pm0.2\n24.7±plus-or-minus\\pm0.2\n24.0±plus-or-minus\\pm0.1\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: and Classifier Model: A large-scale dataset (∼similar-to\\sim100k training samples) for the partition process is needed in our experiments.
