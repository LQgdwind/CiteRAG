Extractive methods aim to select the salient sentences from the input and combine them, typically by concatenation, in order to generate a summary. This is usually approached as a binary classification problem, where for each sentence the model decides whether it should be included in the summary or not   [ref]6. On the other hand, abstractive methods try to encode the input into a hidden representation and then use a decoder conditioned on that representation to generate the summary    [ref]6    . In addition to these two main categories, there also exist hybrid approaches that combine both extractive and abstractive methods either by using pointer-generators  [ref]5  5 0 or by fusing extractive and abstractive models [ref]16 . In order to encode the input text, different methods are using different variations of encoders based on RNNs   [ref]5 5   or convolutional networks [ref]16. One notable addition here is 6 which introduces the Rotational Unit of Memory (RUM). RUM is a different type of RNN unit that can be superior to conventional LSTMs in some summarization scenarios. Finally, given the increased popularity and success of large pre-trained Transformers  in various NLP tasks, many recent methods employ Transformer models [ref]6. Towards that direction a variety of pre-training objectives have been suggested that are better suited for the task of abstractive summarization    . In an effort to enhance performance and address some common shortcomings of neural summarization models, policy learning 7 has been proposed [ref]5 5 [ref]16 8 9 to further improve summarization performance.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: in order to generate a summary. This is usually approached as a binary classification problem, where for each sentence the model decides whether it should be included in the summary or not   [ref]6. On the other hand, abstractive methods try to encode the input into a hidden representation and then use a decoder conditioned on that representation to generate the summary    [ref]6    . In\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
