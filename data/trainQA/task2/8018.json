      "content": "Paper Title: STT-RAM-based Hierarchical In-Memory Computing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBit-line computing is more suitable for non-volatile memories and SRAM than DRAM-based memory due to frequent refreshes required by DRAMs  . To ensure reliable bit-line operations the source operands need to be fully charged. These prior works ensured that the source operands are refreshed before any operations  . Thus, previous works by Seshadri et al. , and Gao et al.  proposed copying source operands to reserved rows to perform bit-line computing, ensuring that the source operands are always refreshed.\nHowever, unlike DRAMs, non-volatile memories do not have to move the data to reserved rows. Many previous studies have investigated processing in memory (PiM) utilizing non-volatile memories (NVM)   [ref]19. For instance, Fan et al. [ref]19 proposed an in-memory AES accelerator employing spintronic devices, demonstrating a 58.6% reduction in energy consumption compared to CMOS circuits. Li et al.  explored bitwise PiM utilizing NVMs like phase-change memory (PCM) and resistive RAM (ReRAM) for data-intensive applications, achieving a 500x speedup for bitwise operations and an overall speedup of 1.12x for data-intensive graph applications. Parveen et al.  proposed an STT-RAM-based in-memory computing architecture that performed Boolean logic operations on any two cells of the same memory array. They evaluated their work in-memory Boolean vector logic and found optimization by 8x and 5x for energy and latency over DRAM-based in-memory computing.\nJain et al. proposed using bit-line computing with STT-RAM memories featuring a compute unit of AND, OR, NOR, NAND, NOT, XOR, and ADD operations. They also evaluated a reliable PiM implementation under process variations with STT-RAMs. Their architecture achieves system-level performance and energy improvements by 3.93x and 3.83x, respectively.\nTheir work, which we leverage for our PiM implementation, features an STT-RAM PiM design that performs addition and logical operations. Although PiC (Processing in Cache) has not received as much attention as PiM (Processing in Memory), previous research  has demonstrated that PiC can address data transfer overheads that may arise in certain workload types for PiM. Aga et al.  proposed integrating computing units within SRAM caches to mitigate data transfer overhead, leading to performance improvements and energy reduction by factors of 1.9x and 2.4x, respectively, compared to CPU-only computing. Eckert et al.  introduced a Neural Cache that transforms SRAM caches into parallel compute units specifically designed for deep neural network inference. Nag et al.  proposed GenCache, a method utilizing SRAM-based in-cache computing to accelerate the genetic sequence alignment task. Our work  is the first to explore PiC using STT-RAM and analyze the tradeoffs associated with STT-RAM-based computing at various memory hierarchy levels.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: unlike DRAMs, non-volatile memories do not have to move the data to reserved rows.
