      "content": "Paper Title: On the Complexity of Scheduling Problems With a Fixed Number of Parallel Identical Machines\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe now give the proofs that did not make it into the main part of this paper. First of all, we prove Corollary 2.2:\nSee 2.2 It is important that A=poly​(n)​T=nc​T𝐴poly𝑛𝑇superscript𝑛𝑐𝑇A=\\text{poly}(n)T=n^{c}T for some constant c𝑐c in the reduction by Abboud et al. [ref]1. Assume that there is an ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0 such that for every δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0, Subset Sum can be solved in time 𝒪​(2δ​n​A1−ε)𝒪superscript2𝛿𝑛superscript𝐴1𝜀\\mathcal{O}\\left(2^{\\delta n}A^{1-\\varepsilon}\\right). We have if we set δ′:=2​δassignsuperscript𝛿′2𝛿\\delta^{\\prime}:=2\\delta and assume that n𝑛n is large enough so that δ​n≥c​log⁡(n)𝛿𝑛𝑐𝑛\\delta n\\geq c\\log(n). Otherwise, n𝑛n is bounded by a constant depending on δ𝛿\\delta and c𝑐c. Note that we assume that we can solve Subset Sum for any δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0. Hence, for every δ′superscript𝛿′\\delta^{\\prime}, we can find a δ=δ′2𝛿superscript𝛿′2\\delta=\\frac{\\delta^{\\prime}}{2} and get a contradiction to Theorem 1.1. To avoid repetitions, we now show a useful lemma that encapsulates the technical parts in the computations of our lower bounds: Suppose there is an 𝒪​(poly​(n))𝒪poly𝑛\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\text{poly}(n)\\right)-time reduction from Subset Sum (or Partition) with n𝑛n items and ∑i=1nai=Asuperscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛subscript𝑎𝑖𝐴\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}=A to some scheduling problem α​|β|​γ𝛼𝛽𝛾\\alpha|\\beta|\\gamma with N=𝒪​(n)𝑁𝒪𝑛N=\\mathcal{O}\\left(n\\right) jobs and parameter K=𝒪​(poly​(n)​A)𝐾𝒪poly𝑛𝐴K=\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\text{poly}(n)A\\right). Then for every ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, there exists a δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0 such that α​|β|​γ𝛼𝛽𝛾\\alpha|\\beta|\\gamma cannot be solved in time 𝒪​(2δ​N​K1−ε)𝒪superscript2𝛿𝑁superscript𝐾1𝜀\\mathcal{O}\\left(2^{\\delta N}K^{1-\\varepsilon}\\right), unless the SETH fails. For the sake of contradiction, assume that there exists an ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0 such that for every δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0, α​|β|​γ𝛼𝛽𝛾\\alpha|\\beta|\\gamma can be solved in time 𝒪​(2δ​N​K1−ε)𝒪superscript2𝛿𝑁superscript𝐾1𝜀\\mathcal{O}\\left(2^{\\delta N}K^{1-\\varepsilon}\\right). Now, consider an instance of Subset Sum (or Partition) with n𝑛n items and ∑i=1nai=Asuperscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛subscript𝑎𝑖𝐴\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}=A. Using the reduction, we construct an instance of α​|β|​γ𝛼𝛽𝛾\\alpha|\\beta|\\gamma with N=𝒪​(n)=c1​n𝑁𝒪𝑛subscript𝑐1𝑛N=\\mathcal{O}\\left(n\\right)=c_{1}n jobs and parameter K=𝒪​(poly​(n)​A)=c2​nc3​A𝐾𝒪poly𝑛𝐴subscript𝑐2superscript𝑛subscript𝑐3𝐴K=\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\text{poly}(n)A\\right)=c_{2}n^{c_{3}}A in time 𝒪​(poly​(n))=nc4𝒪poly𝑛superscript𝑛subscript𝑐4\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\text{poly}(n)\\right)=n^{c_{4}}. In order to contradict the lower bound for Subset Sum (or Partition), we set ε′:=εassignsuperscript𝜀′𝜀\\varepsilon^{\\prime}:=\\varepsilon and consider some arbitrary but fixed δ′>0superscript𝛿′0\\delta^{\\prime}>0. Since we can – by assumption – solve α​|β|​γ𝛼𝛽𝛾\\alpha|\\beta|\\gamma in time 𝒪​(2δ​N​K1−ε)𝒪superscript2𝛿𝑁superscript𝐾1𝜀\\mathcal{O}\\left(2^{\\delta N}K^{1-\\varepsilon}\\right) for every δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0, we can also do so for δ=(δ′−(c3+c4)​log⁡(n)n)​nc1​n𝛿superscript𝛿′subscript𝑐3subscript𝑐4𝑛𝑛𝑛subscript𝑐1𝑛\\delta=(\\delta^{\\prime}-\\frac{(c_{3}+c_{4})\\log(n)}{n})\\frac{n}{c_{1}n}, as long as this is larger than 00. For this, we need that n𝑛n is large enough so we get: Note that for smaller n𝑛n, the inequality n≤(c3+c4)​log⁡(n)δ′𝑛subscript𝑐3subscript𝑐4𝑛superscript𝛿′n\\leq\\frac{(c_{3}+c_{4})\\log(n)}{\\delta^{\\prime}} means that n𝑛n has to be bounded by some function in δ′superscript𝛿′\\delta^{\\prime} and hence (since δ′superscript𝛿′\\delta^{\\prime} is fixed), we could solve Subset Sum (or Partition) in polynomial time. So let us now assume that n𝑛n is large enough so that δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0 and we can use the supposed algorithm for α​|β|​γ𝛼𝛽𝛾\\alpha|\\beta|\\gamma. Using the reduction and this algorithm, we can then solve the Subset Sum (or Partition) instance in time: So there exists a fixed ε′>0superscript𝜀′0\\varepsilon^{\\prime}>0 such that for every fixed δ′>0superscript𝛿′0\\delta^{\\prime}>0, we can solve Subset Sum (or Partition) in time 𝒪​(2δ′​n​A1−ε′)𝒪superscript2superscript𝛿′𝑛superscript𝐴1superscript𝜀′\\mathcal{O}\\left(2^{\\delta^{\\prime}n}A^{1-\\varepsilon^{\\prime}}\\right), which contradicts the corresponding lower bound under SETH and concludes the proof. Analogously, we can also get a lower bound if K=𝒪​(poly​(n)​T)𝐾𝒪poly𝑛𝑇K=\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\text{poly}(n)T\\right). We then get a contradiction to Theorem 1.1, instead. See 2.3 We use a simple reduction from Subset Sum to Partition (a similar reduction from Knapsack to Partition has been given by Karp .\nConsider a Subset Sum instance with items a1,…,ansubscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑛a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n} and target T𝑇T. We construct a Partition instance by copying all items ai′=aisuperscriptsubscript𝑎𝑖′subscript𝑎𝑖a_{i}^{\\prime}=a_{i} for all i∈[n]𝑖delimited-[]𝑛i\\in[n] and then adding the two items an+1′=T+1subscriptsuperscript𝑎′𝑛1𝑇1a^{\\prime}_{n+1}=T+1 and an+2′=A+1−Tsubscriptsuperscript𝑎′𝑛2𝐴1𝑇a^{\\prime}_{n+2}=A+1-T to the instance. Let N=n+2𝑁𝑛2N=n+2. Given a solution S𝑆S of the Subset Sum instance, we get the partitions S∪{an+2′}𝑆subscriptsuperscript𝑎′𝑛2S\\cup\\{a^{\\prime}_{n+2}\\} and S¯∪{an+1′}¯𝑆subscriptsuperscript𝑎′𝑛1\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5muS\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu\\cup\\{a^{\\prime}_{n+1}\\}, which both sum up to A+1𝐴1A+1. For the other direction, note that the sum of all items is equal to 2​A+22𝐴22A+2 and hence the items an+1′subscriptsuperscript𝑎′𝑛1a^{\\prime}_{n+1} and an+2′subscriptsuperscript𝑎′𝑛2a^{\\prime}_{n+2} cannot be in the same partition, as they sum up to T+1+A+1−T=A+2𝑇1𝐴1𝑇𝐴2T+1+A+1-T=A+2. So given a solution S∪S¯𝑆¯𝑆S\\cup\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5muS\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu of the Partition instance, assume w.l.o.g. that an+1′subscriptsuperscript𝑎′𝑛1a^{\\prime}_{n+1} is in S¯¯𝑆\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5muS\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu and an+2′subscriptsuperscript𝑎′𝑛2a^{\\prime}_{n+2} is in S𝑆S. Then in order for the items in S𝑆S to have a total sum of A+1𝐴1A+1, the other items in S𝑆S need to have a total sum that is exactly T𝑇T. Hence, those items give us a solution of the original Subset Sum instance. With K:=∑i∈[N]ai′=A+(T+1)+(A+1−T)=𝒪​(A)assign𝐾subscript𝑖delimited-[]𝑁superscriptsubscript𝑎𝑖′𝐴𝑇1𝐴1𝑇𝒪𝐴K:=\\sum_{i\\in[N]}a_{i}^{\\prime}=A+(T+1)+(A+1-T)=\\mathcal{O}\\left(A\\right) as parameter and N:=n+2assign𝑁𝑛2N:=n+2 jobs, Lemma A.7 yields the claim, since the reduction takes time 𝒪​(n)𝒪𝑛\\mathcal{O}\\left(n\\right).999Note that we only use the Subset Sum-part of Lemma A.7. This way, we do not actually use a lemma to prove a result that is used by the lemma itself. See 3.1 We only show the correctness of the reduction, here. The implication regarding the lower bound has already been shown above. Let a1,…,ansubscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑛a_{1},\\dots,a_{n} be a Partition instance and let T=12​∑i=1nai𝑇12superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛subscript𝑎𝑖T=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}.\nWe construct an instance of 1||∑wjUj{1||\\sum w_{j}U_{j}} by setting pj=wj=aj,dj=Tformulae-sequencesubscript𝑝𝑗subscript𝑤𝑗subscript𝑎𝑗subscript𝑑𝑗𝑇p_{j}=w_{j}=a_{j},d_{j}=T for each j∈[n]𝑗delimited-[]𝑛j\\in[n] and y=T𝑦𝑇y=T.\nRemember that the idea was that the jobs corresponding to items in one of the partitions can be scheduled early (i.e. before the uniform due date T𝑇T). Formally, assume that there is a solution S𝑆S of the given Partition instance. We schedule the jobs corresponding to items in S𝑆S first, in any order; after that, we schedule the rest of the jobs (also in any order). Now the items in S𝑆S sum up to T𝑇T, so they finish exactly at T𝑇T and are all early. The other jobs are all late and have total weight T=y𝑇𝑦T=y. For the other direction, indirectly assume that there is no solution for the Partition instance and consider any optimal schedule for the constructed instance. Without loss of generality, there are no gaps in the schedule, as they can only increase the weighted number of late jobs. Since there is no subset of items with total size exactly T𝑇T, there is also no set of jobs with total processing time exactly T𝑇T. Let S𝑆S be the set of jobs that are scheduled early and note that ∑j∈Spj<Tsubscript𝑗𝑆subscript𝑝𝑗𝑇\\sum_{j\\in S}p_{j}<T. Now the schedule has total weighted number of late jobs which means that an optimal schedule has value larger than y𝑦y and hence the instance is negative. See 3.5 The lower bound has already been shown, so we only prove the correctness of the reduction, here. Remember that given an instance v1,…,vnsubscript𝑣1…subscript𝑣𝑛v_{1},\\ldots,v_{n}, a1,…,ansubscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑛a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n}, T𝑇T, y𝑦y of Knapsack, we construct jobs with pj=ajsubscript𝑝𝑗subscript𝑎𝑗p_{j}=a_{j}, wj=vjsubscript𝑤𝑗subscript𝑣𝑗w_{j}=v_{j} and dj=Tsubscript𝑑𝑗𝑇d_{j}=T for every j∈[n]𝑗delimited-[]𝑛j\\in[n]. The threshold is set to y′=∑j=1nvj−ysuperscript𝑦′superscriptsubscript𝑗1𝑛subscript𝑣𝑗𝑦y^{\\prime}=\\sum_{j=1}^{n}v_{j}-y. Let S⊆[n]𝑆delimited-[]𝑛S\\subseteq[n] be a solution of a given Knapsack instance, i.e. ∑j∈Saj≤Tsubscript𝑗𝑆subscript𝑎𝑗𝑇\\sum_{j\\in S}a_{j}\\leq T and ∑j∈Svj≥ysubscript𝑗𝑆subscript𝑣𝑗𝑦\\sum_{j\\in S}v_{j}\\geq y. In the constructed 1||∑wjUj{1||\\sum w_{j}U_{j}} instance, we schedule the jobs corresponding to items in S𝑆S first (in any order) and afterwards the jobs in S¯¯𝑆\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5muS\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu (also in any order). Now, since ∑j∈Saj≤Tsubscript𝑗𝑆subscript𝑎𝑗𝑇\\sum_{j\\in S}a_{j}\\leq T and pj=ajsubscript𝑝𝑗subscript𝑎𝑗p_{j}=a_{j} for every job j𝑗j, we can see that all jobs corresponding to items in S𝑆S are early. The weighted number of late jobs in the schedule is therefore at most: Hence, the constructed instance of 1||∑wjUj{1||\\sum w_{j}U_{j}} is positive. Now, consider a solution of a constructed 1||∑wjUj{1||\\sum w_{j}U_{j}} instance, i.e. a schedule with weighted number of late jobs at most y′superscript𝑦′y^{\\prime}. Let S⊆[n]𝑆delimited-[]𝑛S\\subseteq[n] be the set of jobs that are scheduled early. Now, S𝑆S is a solution of the original Knapsack instance, since ∑j∈Saj=∑j∈Spj≤Tsubscript𝑗𝑆subscript𝑎𝑗subscript𝑗𝑆subscript𝑝𝑗𝑇\\sum_{j\\in S}a_{j}=\\sum_{j\\in S}p_{j}\\leq T and ∑j∈Svj=∑j=1nvj−∑j∈S¯vj=∑j=1nvj−∑j∈S¯wj≥∑j=1nvj−y′=∑j=1nvj−(∑j=1nvj−y)=ysubscript𝑗𝑆subscript𝑣𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑗1𝑛subscript𝑣𝑗subscript𝑗¯𝑆subscript𝑣𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑗1𝑛subscript𝑣𝑗subscript𝑗¯𝑆subscript𝑤𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑗1𝑛subscript𝑣𝑗superscript𝑦′superscriptsubscript𝑗1𝑛subscript𝑣𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑗1𝑛subscript𝑣𝑗𝑦𝑦\\sum_{j\\in S}v_{j}=\\sum_{j=1}^{n}v_{j}-\\sum_{j\\in\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5muS\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu}v_{j}=\\sum_{j=1}^{n}v_{j}-\\sum_{j\\in\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5muS\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu}w_{j}\\geq\\sum_{j=1}^{n}v_{j}-y^{\\prime}=\\sum_{j=1}^{n}v_{j}-\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n}v_{j}-y\\right)=y.\nSo the original Knapsack instance is also positive. See 3.7 Suppose that for some δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0, there is a (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-approximation algorithm that solves the optimization version of 1||∑wjUj{1||\\sum w_{j}U_{j}} in time 𝒪​((n+12​n​ε)2−δ)𝒪superscript𝑛12𝑛𝜀2𝛿\\mathcal{O}\\left((n+\\frac{1}{2n\\varepsilon})^{2-\\delta}\\right). Since n​wmax≥opt𝑛subscript𝑤optnw_{\\max}\\geq\\operatorname{\\text{{opt}}} for any given instance, setting ε:=11+n​wmaxassign𝜀11𝑛subscript𝑤\\varepsilon:=\\frac{1}{1+nw_{\\max}} yields a solution with value z𝑧z such that Since all weights are integer, optopt\\operatorname{\\text{{opt}}} is also integer and hence, z=opt𝑧optz=\\operatorname{\\text{{opt}}}. So we just solved the optimization version of 1||∑wjUj{1||\\sum w_{j}U_{j}} exactly in time 𝒪​((n+12​n​ε)2−δ)=𝒪​((n+1+n​wmax2​n)2−δ)≤𝒪​((n+2​n​wmax2​n)2−δ)=𝒪​((n+wmax)2−δ)𝒪superscript𝑛12𝑛𝜀2𝛿𝒪superscript𝑛1𝑛subscript𝑤2𝑛2𝛿𝒪superscript𝑛2𝑛subscript𝑤2𝑛2𝛿𝒪superscript𝑛subscript𝑤2𝛿\\mathcal{O}\\left((n+\\frac{1}{2n\\varepsilon})^{2-\\delta}\\right)=\\mathcal{O}\\left((n+\\frac{1+nw_{\\max}}{2n})^{2-\\delta}\\right)\\leq\\mathcal{O}\\left((n+\\frac{2nw_{\\max}}{2n})^{2-\\delta}\\right)=\\mathcal{O}\\left((n+w_{\\max})^{2-\\delta}\\right). With that, we can also solve the decision problem in the same running time for any given threshold y𝑦y and by Theorem 3.5, this refutes the (min,+)(\\min,+)-conjecture. See 3.8 The NP-hardness of 1||∑Tj{1||\\sum T_{j}} is shown by Du and Leung , who reduce from the NP-hard problem Even-Odd-Partition (or EO-Partition for short) via a restricted version thereof (REO-Partition).\nWhile the hardness of EO-Partition is usually attributed to Garey and Johnson , the first reduction in the literature (to the best of our knowledge) is due to Garey, Tarjan and Wilfong .\nWe revisit the reductions in  and  to prove Theorem 3.8. EO-Partition Integers b1,…,b2​n∈ℕsubscript𝑏1…subscript𝑏2𝑛ℕb_{1},\\ldots,b_{2n}\\in\\mathbb{N} with bi>bi+1subscript𝑏𝑖subscript𝑏𝑖1b_{i}>b_{i+1} for each i∈[2​n−1]𝑖delimited-[]2𝑛1i\\in[2n-1]. Decide whether there is a subset S⊆[2​n]𝑆delimited-[]2𝑛S\\subseteq[2n] such that ∑i∈Sbi=∑i∈S¯bisubscript𝑖𝑆subscript𝑏𝑖subscript𝑖¯𝑆subscript𝑏𝑖\\sum_{i\\in S}b_{i}=\\sum_{i\\in\\bar{S}}b_{i} and |S∩{b2​i−1,b2​i}|=1𝑆subscript𝑏2𝑖1subscript𝑏2𝑖1|S\\cap\\{b_{2i-1},b_{2i}\\}|=1 for each i∈[n]𝑖delimited-[]𝑛i\\in[n]. In other words, the items bisubscript𝑏𝑖b_{i} are strictly decreasing and consist of n𝑛n pairs of items (b2​i−1,b2​i)subscript𝑏2𝑖1subscript𝑏2𝑖(b_{2i-1},b_{2i}), where the items of a pair may not be in the same partition. The reduction from Partition to EO-Partition by to Garey, Tarjan and Wilfong  is as follows: Given a Partition instance a1,…,ansubscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑛a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n}, we may assume that A=∑i∈[n]ai𝐴subscript𝑖delimited-[]𝑛subscript𝑎𝑖A=\\sum_{i\\in[n]}a_{i} is even because otherwise the instance is trivial.\nWe set b2​n=1subscript𝑏2𝑛1b_{2n}=1, b2​i−1=b2​i+aisubscript𝑏2𝑖1subscript𝑏2𝑖subscript𝑎𝑖b_{2i-1}=b_{2i}+a_{i} for each i∈[n]𝑖delimited-[]𝑛i\\in[n], and b2​i=b2​i+1+1subscript𝑏2𝑖subscript𝑏2𝑖11b_{2i}=b_{2i+1}+1 for each i∈[n−1]𝑖delimited-[]𝑛1i\\in[n-1]. In other words, we start at the smallest item (which also has the largest index) and set it to 111. Then we recursively define the other items, step by step: If we stay in the same pair i𝑖i, we add aisubscript𝑎𝑖a_{i} and if we go from one pair to the next, we add only 111. Hence, the items increase throughout the construction and we get bi>bi+1subscript𝑏𝑖subscript𝑏𝑖1b_{i}>b_{i+1} for each i∈[2​n−1]𝑖delimited-[]2𝑛1i\\in[2n-1]. Moreover, the difference between the larger item of a pair and the smaller one is b2​i−1−b2​i=aisubscript𝑏2𝑖1subscript𝑏2𝑖subscript𝑎𝑖b_{2i-1}-b_{2i}=a_{i} for every pair i∈[n]𝑖delimited-[]𝑛i\\in[n]. Suppose that the Partition instance is positive, i.e. we have a set S⊆[n]𝑆delimited-[]𝑛S\\subseteq[n] such that ∑i∈Sai=∑i∈S¯aisubscript𝑖𝑆subscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑖¯𝑆subscript𝑎𝑖\\sum_{i\\in S}a_{i}=\\sum_{i\\in\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5muS\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu}a_{i}. Consider the set T={j∈[2​n]|(i∈S∧j=2​i−1)∨(i∈S¯∧j=2​i)}𝑇conditional-set𝑗delimited-[]2𝑛𝑖𝑆𝑗2𝑖1𝑖¯𝑆𝑗2𝑖T=\\{j\\in[2n]\\,|\\,(i\\in S\\land j=2i-1)\\lor(i\\in\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5muS\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu\\land j=2i)\\}, where we take all the odd-indexed (i.e. larger) items corresponding to items in S𝑆S and the even-indexed (i.e. smaller) items corresponding to items in S¯¯𝑆\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5muS\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu. It is not quite clear how large ∑j∈Tbjsubscript𝑗𝑇subscript𝑏𝑗\\sum_{j\\in T}b_{j} is, but using the fact that b2​i−1−b2​i=aisubscript𝑏2𝑖1subscript𝑏2𝑖subscript𝑎𝑖b_{2i-1}-b_{2i}=a_{i}, we can see that and hence, T𝑇T and T¯¯𝑇\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5muT\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu are a valid partition. For the other direction, suppose T𝑇T, T¯¯𝑇\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5muT\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu is a solution of the EO-Partition instance. Define a solution of the corresponding Partition instance as follows: S={i∈[n]|b2​i−1∈T}𝑆conditional-set𝑖delimited-[]𝑛subscript𝑏2𝑖1𝑇S=\\{i\\in[n]\\,|\\,b_{2i-1}\\in T\\}. Using essentially the same transformations as above, it follows that ∑i∈Sai−∑i∈S¯ai=∑j∈Tbj−∑j∈T¯bjsubscript𝑖𝑆subscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑖¯𝑆subscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑗𝑇subscript𝑏𝑗subscript𝑗¯𝑇subscript𝑏𝑗\\sum_{i\\in S}a_{i}-\\sum_{i\\in\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5muS\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu}a_{i}=\\sum_{j\\in T}b_{j}-\\sum_{j\\in\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5muT\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu}b_{j}, which is equal to zero, by assumption. So S𝑆S is indeed a solution of the Partition instance. Note that ∑j∈[2​n]bj=𝒪​(n2+n​A)subscript𝑗delimited-[]2𝑛subscript𝑏𝑗𝒪superscript𝑛2𝑛𝐴\\sum_{j\\in[2n]}b_{j}=\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{2}+nA\\right), since the largest item b1subscript𝑏1b_{1} is bounded by 𝒪​(n+A)𝒪𝑛𝐴\\mathcal{O}\\left(n+A\\right).\nFurthermore, note that in the resulting EO-Partition instance we have ∑i∈[n](b2​i−1−b2​i)=∑i∈[n]aisubscript𝑖delimited-[]𝑛subscript𝑏2𝑖1subscript𝑏2𝑖subscript𝑖delimited-[]𝑛subscript𝑎𝑖\\sum_{i\\in[n]}(b_{2i-1}-b_{2i})=\\sum_{i\\in[n]}a_{i} and therefore may assume that this number is even in the following. The REO-Partition problem was introduced by Du and Leung  and is very similar to EO-Partition.\nHowever, in this version of the problem the input consist of integers c1,…,c2​n∈ℕsubscript𝑐1…subscript𝑐2𝑛ℕc_{1},\\ldots,c_{2n}\\in\\mathbb{N} with ci>ci+1subscript𝑐𝑖subscript𝑐𝑖1c_{i}>c_{i+1} for each i∈[2​n−1]𝑖delimited-[]2𝑛1i\\in[2n-1], c2​i>c2​i+1+δsubscript𝑐2𝑖subscript𝑐2𝑖1𝛿c_{2i}>c_{2i+1}+\\delta for each i∈[n−1]𝑖delimited-[]𝑛1i\\in[n-1], and ci>n​(4​n+1)​δ+5​n​(c1−c2​n)subscript𝑐𝑖𝑛4𝑛1𝛿5𝑛subscript𝑐1subscript𝑐2𝑛c_{i}>n(4n+1)\\delta+5n(c_{1}-c_{2n}) for each i∈[2​n]𝑖delimited-[]2𝑛i\\in[2n], where δ=12​∑i∈[n](c2​i−1−c2​i)𝛿12subscript𝑖delimited-[]𝑛subscript𝑐2𝑖1subscript𝑐2𝑖\\delta=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i\\in[n]}(c_{2i-1}-c_{2i}). So in this restricted variant, the items of subsequent pairs have difference >δabsent𝛿>\\delta and each item is larger than some value depending on n𝑛n, δ𝛿\\delta and the difference between the largest and smallest item.\nThe reduction by Du and Leung  from EO-Partition to REO-Partition is as follows: Let Δ=12​∑i∈[n](b2​i−1−b2​i)=12​AΔ12subscript𝑖delimited-[]𝑛subscript𝑏2𝑖1subscript𝑏2𝑖12𝐴\\Delta=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i\\in[n]}(b_{2i-1}-b_{2i})=\\frac{1}{2}A and for every i∈[n]𝑖delimited-[]𝑛i\\in[n]. We know Δ∈ℕΔℕ\\Delta\\in\\mathbb{N} as the sum is even, by a previous assumption. Note that δ=Δ𝛿Δ\\delta=\\Delta since c2​i−1−c2​i=b2​i−1−b2​isubscript𝑐2𝑖1subscript𝑐2𝑖subscript𝑏2𝑖1subscript𝑏2𝑖c_{2i-1}-c_{2i}=b_{2i-1}-b_{2i} holds for each i∈[n]𝑖delimited-[]𝑛i\\in[n].\nMoreover, ci>ci+1subscript𝑐𝑖subscript𝑐𝑖1c_{i}>c_{i+1} for each i∈[2​n−1]𝑖delimited-[]2𝑛1i\\in[2n-1] since bi>bi+1subscript𝑏𝑖subscript𝑏𝑖1b_{i}>b_{i+1}. We also have c2​i>c2​i+1+δsubscript𝑐2𝑖subscript𝑐2𝑖1𝛿c_{2i}>c_{2i+1}+\\delta for each i∈[n−1]𝑖delimited-[]𝑛1i\\in[n-1], since we get an additional Δ=δΔ𝛿\\Delta=\\delta between subsequent pairs and since already b2​i>b2​i+1subscript𝑏2𝑖subscript𝑏2𝑖1b_{2i}>b_{2i+1}. Finally, we also get ci>n​(4​n+1)​δ+5​n​(c1−c2​n)subscript𝑐𝑖𝑛4𝑛1𝛿5𝑛subscript𝑐1subscript𝑐2𝑛c_{i}>n(4n+1)\\delta+5n(c_{1}-c_{2n}) for each i∈[2​n]𝑖delimited-[]2𝑛i\\in[2n], as we will show. First note that and hence: So the inequality holds for the smallest item, which means that it holds for all items. We can conclude that the constructed instance of REO-Partition is valid. It is not hard to verify that a solution of the EO-Partition instance can be transformed to a solution of the REO-Partition instance and vice-versa by just selecting the corresponding cjsubscript𝑐𝑗c_{j} (respectively bjsubscript𝑏𝑗b_{j}). If we consider the two reductions one after another and use previously observed bounds for b1subscript𝑏1b_{1}, ∑j∈[2​n]bjsubscript𝑗delimited-[]2𝑛subscript𝑏𝑗\\sum_{j\\in[2n]}b_{j} and ΔΔ\\Delta, we get: In the last step, Du and Leung construct a 1||∑Tj{1||\\sum T_{j}} instance from the REO-Partition instance. For the details, see the paper . What is important for our lower bound are the parameter sizes of the 1||∑Tj{1||\\sum T_{j}} instance, namely the number of jobs and the total processing time. The due dates are trivially bounded by the total processing time, which makes them less interesting in a lower bound. An examination of the construction (page 487) gives the following parameters: N:=3​n+1assign𝑁3𝑛1N:=3n+1 jobs and total processing time K:=P=∑i∈[2​n]ci+(n+1)​(4​n+1)​δ=𝒪​(n3​A)=𝒪​(poly​(n)​A)assign𝐾𝑃subscript𝑖delimited-[]2𝑛subscript𝑐𝑖𝑛14𝑛1𝛿𝒪superscript𝑛3𝐴𝒪poly𝑛𝐴K:=P=\\sum_{i\\in[2n]}c_{i}+(n+1)(4n+1)\\delta=\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{3}A\\right)=\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\text{poly}(n)A\\right). Since the reduction is polynomial in n𝑛n, we can use Lemma A.7 to conclude the proof. See 3.9 Consider an instance a1,…,ansubscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑛a_{1},\\dots,a_{n}, T𝑇T of Subset Sum. We create an instance of 1|R​e​j≤Q|Cmaxconditional1𝑅𝑒𝑗conditional𝑄subscript𝐶{1|Rej\\leq Q|C_{\\max}} n𝑛n jobs, pj=wj=ajsubscript𝑝𝑗subscript𝑤𝑗subscript𝑎𝑗p_{j}=w_{j}=a_{j} for every j∈[n]𝑗delimited-[]𝑛j\\in[n], y=T𝑦𝑇y=T and Q=A−T𝑄𝐴𝑇Q=A-T. We can now see that there is a subset of items that sums up to T𝑇T, if and only if there is a subset of jobs that is scheduled in time T𝑇T, the rest of the jobs is rejected and total weight of rejected jobs is at most A−T𝐴𝑇A-T. In the constructed instance, we have N:=nassign𝑁𝑛N:=n jobs and using K:=y+P+Q+W=T+A+A−T+A=𝒪​(A)assign𝐾𝑦𝑃𝑄𝑊𝑇𝐴𝐴𝑇𝐴𝒪𝐴K:=y+P+Q+W=T+A+A-T+A=\\mathcal{O}\\left(A\\right) as parameter with Lemma A.7 proves the claim, since the reduction takes time 𝒪​(n)𝒪𝑛\\mathcal{O}\\left(n\\right). See 4.1 We show that the lower bound 𝒪​(2δ​n​A1−ε)𝒪superscript2𝛿𝑛superscript𝐴1𝜀\\mathcal{O}\\left(2^{\\delta n}A^{1-\\varepsilon}\\right) for Partition can be transferred to P2||Cmax{P2||C_{\\max}}.\nLet a1,…,ansubscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑛a_{1},\\dots,a_{n} be a Partition instance. Construct the P2||Cmax{P2||C_{\\max}} instance by setting pj=ajsubscript𝑝𝑗subscript𝑎𝑗p_{j}=a_{j} for every j∈[n]𝑗delimited-[]𝑛j\\in[n] and y=12​A𝑦12𝐴y=\\frac{1}{2}A. It is easy to see that there is a partition of the items into two subsets of equal sum, if and only if the jobs can be split among the two machines such that each one gets assigned jobs with total processing time y𝑦y. Since the constructed instance has N:=nassign𝑁𝑛N:=n jobs and takes time linear in n𝑛n, we can prove the claim by using K:=y+P=12​A+A=𝒪​(A)assign𝐾𝑦𝑃12𝐴𝐴𝒪𝐴K:=y+P=\\frac{1}{2}A+A=\\mathcal{O}\\left(A\\right) as parameter in Lemma A.7. See 4.2 We assume that m>1𝑚1m>1, as the problem is trivial on a single machine. In , Chen et al.show that the known approximation schemes for Pm||Cmax{Pm||C_{\\max}} are essentially optimal. In particular, they also show that there is no 2𝒪​(m12−δ​|I|)superscript2𝒪superscript𝑚12𝛿𝐼2^{\\mathcal{O}\\left(m^{\\frac{1}{2}-\\delta}\\sqrt{|I|}\\right)}-time exact algorithm for any δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0, unless the ETH fails. This is done by a reduction from 3-Sat via 3-Dimensional-Matching to Pm||Cmax{Pm||C_{\\max}}. For us, the crucial part about these reductions is that we can choose m𝑚m arbitrarily and if the original 3-Sat formula has n′superscript𝑛′n^{\\prime} variables, the Pm||Cmax{Pm||C_{\\max}} instance has 𝒪​(n′+m)𝒪superscript𝑛′𝑚\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{\\prime}+m\\right) jobs and total processing time bounded by P≤n′​m𝒪​(n′​log⁡(m)m)𝑃superscript𝑛′superscript𝑚𝒪superscript𝑛′𝑚𝑚P\\leq n^{\\prime}m^{\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{n^{\\prime}\\log(m)}{m}\\right)}. This can be seen in the paper by Chen et al.  on page 666, where a job is constructed for each of the 𝒪​(n′)𝒪superscript𝑛′\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{\\prime}\\right) matches and elements in addition to at most m𝑚m dummy jobs and one huge job. The processing time of the huge job is set to 6​m3​(m+1)​∑i=19​q+ταi6superscript𝑚3𝑚1superscriptsubscript𝑖19𝑞𝜏superscript𝛼𝑖6m^{3}(m+1)\\sum_{i=1}^{9q+\\tau}\\alpha^{i} minus the total processing time of the other constructed jobs, where q=n′m𝑞superscript𝑛′𝑚q=\\frac{n^{\\prime}}{m}, τ=𝒪​(n′​log⁡(m)m)𝜏𝒪superscript𝑛′𝑚𝑚\\tau=\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{n^{\\prime}\\log(m)}{m}\\right) and α=6​m4+6​m3+6​m2𝛼6superscript𝑚46superscript𝑚36superscript𝑚2\\alpha=6m^{4}+6m^{3}+6m^{2}. Note that in the reduction it is assumed that q𝑞q is integer, so n′≥msuperscript𝑛′𝑚n^{\\prime}\\geq m. This is achieved by adding dummy elements to the 3-Dimensional-Matching instance. Hence, the total processing time is equal to 6​m3​(m+1)​∑i=19​q+ταi6superscript𝑚3𝑚1superscriptsubscript𝑖19𝑞𝜏superscript𝛼𝑖6m^{3}(m+1)\\sum_{i=1}^{9q+\\tau}\\alpha^{i}, which can be bounded by using where the first implication follows because the function klog⁡(k)𝑘𝑘\\frac{k}{\\log(k)} is monotone for values k≥2𝑘2k\\geq 2 (and we assumed m𝑚m – and hence also n′superscript𝑛′n^{\\prime} – to be larger than 111). Now, suppose that we have an 𝒪​(n​m​Po​(mlog2⁡(m)))𝒪𝑛𝑚superscript𝑃𝑜𝑚superscript2𝑚\\mathcal{O}\\left(nmP^{o\\left(\\frac{m}{\\log^{2}(m)}\\right)}\\right)-time algorithm solving Pm||Cmax{Pm||C_{\\max}}. Using the reduction by Chen et al. , which has a running time poly​(n)=ncpoly𝑛superscript𝑛𝑐\\text{poly}(n)=n^{c}, we could then solve 3-Sat in time: This contradicts the ETH and proves the theorem. See 4.3 We only show the correctness of the reduction, here. The fact that the lower bound follows from the reduction has already been shown. Remember that given a Partition instance a1,…,ansubscript𝑎1…subscript𝑎𝑛a_{1},\\dots,a_{n}, we construct a P2||∑wjCj{P2||\\sum w_{j}C_{j}} instance in the following way: Let pj=wj=ajsubscript𝑝𝑗subscript𝑤𝑗subscript𝑎𝑗p_{j}=w_{j}=a_{j} for each j∈[n]𝑗delimited-[]𝑛j\\in[n] and set the limit y=∑1≤i≤j≤naj​ai−14​A2𝑦subscript1𝑖𝑗𝑛subscript𝑎𝑗subscript𝑎𝑖14superscript𝐴2y=\\sum_{1\\leq i\\leq j\\leq n}a_{j}a_{i}-\\frac{1}{4}A^{2}. Note that the execution order of the jobs on one specific machine does not influence the sum of weighted completion times for that machine, since pj=wjsubscript𝑝𝑗subscript𝑤𝑗p_{j}=w_{j} for all jobs j𝑗j: This follows from the observation that ∑j∈[k]wj​Cj=∑j∈[k]pj​(∑i≤jpi)=∑1≤i≤j≤kpj​pisubscript𝑗delimited-[]𝑘subscript𝑤𝑗subscript𝐶𝑗subscript𝑗delimited-[]𝑘subscript𝑝𝑗subscript𝑖𝑗subscript𝑝𝑖subscript1𝑖𝑗𝑘subscript𝑝𝑗subscript𝑝𝑖\\sum_{j\\in[k]}w_{j}C_{j}=\\sum_{j\\in[k]}p_{j}(\\sum_{i\\leq j}p_{i})=\\sum_{1\\leq i\\leq j\\leq k}p_{j}p_{i} holds for any k𝑘k jobs running on one machine.\nBefore we prove the correctness of the construction, consider a schedule of jobs {1,…,n}=S∪S¯1…𝑛𝑆¯𝑆\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}=S\\cup\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5muS\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu with wj=pjsubscript𝑤𝑗subscript𝑝𝑗w_{j}=p_{j}, where jobs in S𝑆S are scheduled on the first machine and jobs in S¯¯𝑆\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5muS\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu are scheduled on the second machine. We wish to show that the total weighted completion time of this schedule is ∑j=1nwj​Cj−∑j∈Swj​∑j∈S¯pj=∑1≤i≤j≤npj​pi−∑j∈Swj​∑j∈S¯pjsuperscriptsubscript𝑗1𝑛subscript𝑤𝑗subscript𝐶𝑗subscript𝑗𝑆subscript𝑤𝑗subscript𝑗¯𝑆subscript𝑝𝑗subscript1𝑖𝑗𝑛subscript𝑝𝑗subscript𝑝𝑖subscript𝑗𝑆subscript𝑤𝑗subscript𝑗¯𝑆subscript𝑝𝑗\\sum_{j=1}^{n}w_{j}C_{j}-\\sum_{j\\in S}w_{j}\\sum_{j\\in\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5muS\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu}p_{j}=\\sum_{1\\leq i\\leq j\\leq n}p_{j}p_{i}-\\sum_{j\\in S}w_{j}\\sum_{j\\in\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5muS\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu}p_{j}.\nIf all jobs were scheduled on the first machine, the value would be just ∑1≤i≤j≤npj​pisubscript1𝑖𝑗𝑛subscript𝑝𝑗subscript𝑝𝑖\\sum_{1\\leq i\\leq j\\leq n}p_{j}p_{i}, as argued above. Again, this does not depend on the order of the jobs, but let us assume that the jobs in S¯¯𝑆\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5muS\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu are scheduled first. Moving them to the second machine reduces the total weighted completion time by ∑j∈Swj​∑j∈S¯pjsubscript𝑗𝑆subscript𝑤𝑗subscript𝑗¯𝑆subscript𝑝𝑗\\sum_{j\\in S}w_{j}\\sum_{j\\in\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5muS\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu}p_{j}, as the completion time of each job in S𝑆S is reduced by ∑j∈S¯pjsubscript𝑗¯𝑆subscript𝑝𝑗\\sum_{j\\in\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5muS\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu}p_{j} and the completion time of the jobs in S¯¯𝑆\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5muS\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu stays the same. Now, consider a solution S∪S¯𝑆¯𝑆S\\cup\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5muS\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu of Partition. We schedule the jobs corresponding to items in S𝑆S on the first machine and the rest on the second machine, in arbitrary order. By the previous observations, this schedule has total weighted completion time: So this schedule meets the threshold y=∑1≤i≤j≤naj​ai−14​A2𝑦subscript1𝑖𝑗𝑛subscript𝑎𝑗subscript𝑎𝑖14superscript𝐴2y=\\sum_{1\\leq i\\leq j\\leq n}a_{j}a_{i}-\\frac{1}{4}A^{2}. For the other direction, it is only important to see that we have the term ∑1≤i≤j≤naj​aisubscript1𝑖𝑗𝑛subscript𝑎𝑗subscript𝑎𝑖\\sum_{1\\leq i\\leq j\\leq n}a_{j}a_{i} in the total weighted completion time no matter what and that the selection of jobs S¯¯𝑆\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5muS\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu we put on the second machine determines the second part ∑j∈Saj​∑j∈S¯ajsubscript𝑗𝑆subscript𝑎𝑗subscript𝑗¯𝑆subscript𝑎𝑗\\sum_{j\\in S}a_{j}\\sum_{j\\in\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5muS\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu}a_{j} that is subtracted from the first term. Since the total sum A=∑i=1nai=∑j∈Saj+∑j∈S¯aj𝐴superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛subscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑗𝑆subscript𝑎𝑗subscript𝑗¯𝑆subscript𝑎𝑗A=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}=\\sum_{j\\in S}a_{j}+\\sum_{j\\in\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5muS\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu}a_{j} is fixed, the maximum of the product ∑j∈Saj​∑j∈S¯ajsubscript𝑗𝑆subscript𝑎𝑗subscript𝑗¯𝑆subscript𝑎𝑗\\sum_{j\\in S}a_{j}\\sum_{j\\in\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5muS\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu}a_{j} is attained when ∑j∈Saj=∑j∈S¯ajsubscript𝑗𝑆subscript𝑎𝑗subscript𝑗¯𝑆subscript𝑎𝑗\\sum_{j\\in S}a_{j}=\\sum_{j\\in\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5muS\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu}a_{j}. This is also exactly the case where the value is equal to 14​A214superscript𝐴2\\frac{1}{4}A^{2}. In all other cases, the product is smaller and hence subtracting less from ∑1≤i≤j≤naj​aisubscript1𝑖𝑗𝑛subscript𝑎𝑗subscript𝑎𝑖\\sum_{1\\leq i\\leq j\\leq n}a_{j}a_{i} gives us an objective value larger than y𝑦y. With this observation, clearly the jobs must be split such that the jobs on machine 1 have the same total processing time as the jobs on machine 2, which is only possible if the corresponding Partition instance is positive. See 4.5 We show that the lower bound 𝒪​(2δ​n​(y+P)1−ε)𝒪superscript2𝛿𝑛superscript𝑦𝑃1𝜀\\mathcal{O}\\left(2^{\\delta n}(y+P)^{1-\\varepsilon}\\right) for P2||Cmax{P2||C_{\\max}} can be transferred to P​2​|s​i​z​e|​Cmax𝑃2𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒subscript𝐶{P2|size|C_{\\max}}.\nConstruct the P​2​|s​i​z​e|​Cmax𝑃2𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒subscript𝐶{P2|size|C_{\\max}} instance from the P2||Cmax{P2||C_{\\max}} instance by setting the size to 111 for each job. The correctness for this reduction is trivial and neither the number of jobs nor the total processing time or threshold changes, so the lower bound for P2||Cmax{P2||C_{\\max}} directly applies to P​2​|s​i​z​e|​Cmax𝑃2𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒subscript𝐶{P2|size|C_{\\max}} and we can conclude that there is no algorithm that solves P​2​|s​i​z​e|​Cmax𝑃2𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒subscript𝐶{P2|size|C_{\\max}} in 𝒪​(2δ​n​(y+P)1−ε)𝒪superscript2𝛿𝑛superscript𝑦𝑃1𝜀\\mathcal{O}\\left(2^{\\delta n}(y+P)^{1-\\varepsilon}\\right), unless the SETH fails. See 4.6 We show that the lower bound 𝒪​(2δ​n​(y+P)1−ε)𝒪superscript2𝛿𝑛superscript𝑦𝑃1𝜀\\mathcal{O}\\left(2^{\\delta n}(y+P)^{1-\\varepsilon}\\right) for P2||Cmax{P2||C_{\\max}} can be transferred to P​2​|a​n​y|​Cmax𝑃2𝑎𝑛𝑦subscript𝐶{P2|any|C_{\\max}}. Construct the P​2​|a​n​y|​Cmax𝑃2𝑎𝑛𝑦subscript𝐶{P2|any|C_{\\max}} instance by setting pj,1=pj,2=pjsubscript𝑝𝑗1subscript𝑝𝑗2subscript𝑝𝑗p_{j,1}=p_{j,2}=p_{j} for every j∈[n]𝑗delimited-[]𝑛j\\in[n]. Any schedule for P2||Cmax{P2||C_{\\max}} also represents a schedule for P​2​|a​n​y|​Cmax𝑃2𝑎𝑛𝑦subscript𝐶{P2|any|C_{\\max}} and since no advantage can be achieved by scheduling any job on two machines, a feasible schedule for P​2​|a​n​y|​Cmax𝑃2𝑎𝑛𝑦subscript𝐶{P2|any|C_{\\max}} is also feasible for P2||Cmax{P2||C_{\\max}}.\nAgain, this does not change the size of the instance and hence the lower bound for P2||Cmax{P2||C_{\\max}} directly applies to P​2​|a​n​y|​Cmax𝑃2𝑎𝑛𝑦subscript𝐶{P2|any|C_{\\max}} so we can conclude that there is no algorithm that solves the problem in time 𝒪​(2δ​n​(y+P)1−ε)𝒪superscript2𝛿𝑛superscript𝑦𝑃1𝜀\\mathcal{O}\\left(2^{\\delta n}(y+P)^{1-\\varepsilon}\\right), unless the SETH fails. See 4.9 For three machines, the main idea of the dynamic program stays the same; the recurrence formula just becomes a bit more complicated. We create a field F​(j,t1,t2)𝐹𝑗subscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2F(j,t_{1},t_{2}), which tells us the minimum load we can get on machine 3, if we schedule all the jobs in [j]delimited-[]𝑗[j] such that machine 1 and 2 have load t1subscript𝑡1t_{1} and t2subscript𝑡2t_{2}, respectively. In analogy to the dynamic program for two machines, we define the recurrence formula: The cases correspond to scheduling job j𝑗j on machine 1, on machine 2, on machine 3, on machine 1 and 2, on machine 1 and 3, on machine 2 and 3 and finally on all three machines. Again, the initial entries are F​(0,0,0)=0𝐹0000F(0,0,0)=0 and F​(0,t1,t2)=∞𝐹0subscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2F(0,t_{1},t_{2})=\\infty for every t1,t2∈[y]subscript𝑡1subscript𝑡2delimited-[]𝑦t_{1},t_{2}\\in[y]. This time, we need to compute 𝒪​(n​P2)𝒪𝑛superscript𝑃2\\mathcal{O}\\left(nP^{2}\\right) entries; the actual distribution of our jobs among the machines can be obtained in the standard way, i.e. by remembering how we obtained every entry or by going backwards through the table. However, in this case, it is not directly clear that this distribution of jobs yields a feasible schedule with makespan at most y𝑦y. Fortunately, as Du and Leung  observed, there is a canonical schedule in the case of three machines: The jobs are swapped such that there are only two-machine jobs on machines 1 and 2 and on machines 2 and 3. Then, the three-machine jobs are moved to the beginning of the schedule, followed by the two-machine jobs on machine 1 and 2. Finally, the two-machine jobs on machine 2 and 3 are executed at the end of the schedule and the one-machine jobs are executed in between. Using this canonical schedule and the distribution of the jobs to machines, we can obtain the actual schedule (i.e. with starting times).\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: this paper.
