      "content": "Paper Title: Lost in Compression: the Impact of Lossy Image Compression on Variable Size Object Detection within Infrared Imagery\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this study we utilise three state-of-the-art, well-established and characteristically diverse object detection architectures as outlined in Table 1. These are namely: Cascade R-CNN , Feature Selective Anchor-Free , and Deformable End-to-End Detection with Transformers . All architectures in this study utilise a ResNet-50  backbone and are initialised with weights trained on COCO [ref]32. Cascade R-CNN (CR-CNN) : Cascade Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Cascade R-CNN) is an extension of R-CNN  which offers a solution to the trade-off between low Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds inducing noisy detections and performance degradation with high IoU thresholds. It accomplishes this by training a sequence of detectors stage-by-stage with increasing IoU thresholds to be more selective against false positives. FSAF : Feature Selective Anchor-Free (FSAF) is a module for single-shot object detection can be added to detectors with a feature pyramid structure and performs online feature selection upon multi-level anchor-free branches. This aims to address the limitations induced by heuristic-guided feature selection and overlap-based anchor sampling, leading to increased performance while introducing negligible inference overhead. Deformable DETR (DDETR) : Detection Transformer (DETR) combines convolutional features with a transformer architecture 7 which powerfully model sequential relations using multi-head attention. This means that the DETR architecture does not rely on hand-crafted components and as such can be trained fully end-to-end. Deformable DETR is an extension to this architecture which speeds up the convergence by having attention modules only attend to a small set of neighbouring points as well as tackling the problem of representing objects at varying scale.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: Feature Selective Anchor-Free , and Deformable End-to-End Detection with Transformers .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
