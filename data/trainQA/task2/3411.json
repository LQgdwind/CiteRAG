      "content": "Paper Title: Abstract\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSince their inception in the mid-90s  , CDCL solvers have proven enormously successful in solving the satisfiability problem of propositional logic (SAT). As a case in point, we refer to the annual SAT Competition111The goal of the annual SAT Competition is to promote further improvements in the field of SAT solving by hosting a competitive event where researchers can present their newest implementation work. All submitted solvers are put up against each other to solve a pool of instances. The fastest solver wins. We refer to http://www.satcompetition.org for more detailed information.: CDCL solvers won several of the last competitions.\nIn many combinatorial fields, applied problems are nowadays even solved by reducing the problem to a SAT instance and invoking a CDCL solver (see e. g. [ref]3), despite the 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-completeness of the SAT problem.222SAT solvers have also been used in the last few years to generate computerized proofs of long-standing open problems. We refer to [ref]4 for a solution of the Boolean Pythagorean Triples problem, [ref]5 for Schur number five, or  for the resolution of Keller’s Conjecture with SAT solvers. The abbreviation CDCL stands for conflict-driven clause learning. The eponymous component of CDCL is clause learning, a mechanism that can enhance the simple exhaustive exploration of the search tree for possible satisfying assignments by learning from mistakes made and avoiding these in the future. During its execution, the solver learns additional clauses containing this learned information (we refer to Section 2.1 for an introduction to CDCL solvers). This enables the solver to prune the search tree and avoid re-exploring similar parts. In addition to a clause learning scheme, many modern CDCL solvers also employ a technique to delete some of the new clauses from time to time when they were deemed not helpful by the solver. However, it is still largely a mystery whether this deletion process is only used to keep computation times low by having a manageable clause database or if there is some theoretical benefit to deleting clauses. Although both techniques, clause learning and clause deletion, are routinely employed in modern CDCL solvers, the theoretical underpinnings of the interactions between the two techniques are not entirely understood .\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: solvers won several of the last competitions.\nIn many combinatorial fields, applied problems are nowadays even solved by reducing the problem to a SAT instance and invoking a CDCL solver (see e. g. [ref]3), despite the 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-completeness of the SAT problem.222SAT solvers have also been used in the last few years to generate computerized proofs of long-standing open problems.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
