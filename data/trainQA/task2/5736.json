While the softmax predictions are easy to implement, the predicted probabilities tend to be overconfident and need to be calibrated . Additionally, they are often erroneously interpreted as model confidence .\nA mathematically sound approach based on Bayesian inference is provided by \\acbnns where a deterministic network is transformed into a stochastic one. This is done by either placing probability distributions over the activations or the weights .\nFor example, Bayes by Backprop [ref]3 uses variational inference to learn approximate distributions over the weights. At test time, weights are sampled from the learned distributions, resulting in an ensemble of models that is used to sample from the posterior distribution over the predictions.\nTo overcome the high computational cost of \\acbnns, Gal and Ghahramani  propose Monte Carlo Dropout as an approximation of a stochastic gaussian process using a common regularization method. While dropout regularization  is usually only used during training, Monte Carlo Dropout applies this technique to sample from the posterior distribution of the predictions at test time. Since Monte Carlo Dropout only captures the uncertainty inherent to the model, the method is combined with learned uncertainty predictions and assumed density filtering  by Kendall and Gal and Loquercio et al.   to obtain the total uncertainty in the predictions respectively. The uncertainties produced by Monte Carlo Dropout are not calibrated , which is a major drawback that is overcome by \\acdes [ref]21 where an ensemble of trained models produces samples of predictions at test time. Due to randomness introduced by random weight initialization or different data augmentations across the ensemble members , \\acdes are well-calibrated [ref]21 and outperform \\acuq approaches like softmax probability, Monte Carlo Dropout, and Bayes by Backprop, as is shown by Ovadia et al. . The latter also show that \\acdes seem to be more robust against dataset shift, which was also observed by Wursthorn et al. .\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: consist of a large number of model parameters and often include non-linearities, which generally makes the exact posterior probability distribution of a network’s output prediction intractable [ref]3 .\nThis leads to approximate \\acuq approaches including softmax probability, Bayesian techniques like \\acbnns [ref]25 and Monte Carlo Dropout  as well as \\acdes [ref]21.
