      "content": "Paper Title: VQA with Cascade of Self- and Co-Attention Blocks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInitial attention-based approaches [ref]355 focused on identifying salient image regions based on the text of a given question. In other words, the focus was on giving attention to images (visual attention) only. Subsequent methods, often referred to as co-attention-based methods [ref]4, combined textual attention along with image attention. Textual attention focuses on relevant words in the context of the given image. Co-attention-based methods improved the performance of VQA systems. A few studies 0 have shown that considering attention in a cascaded or stack-based manner helps in obtaining enriched representation with fine-grained information. Recent attention-based models have taken inspiration from transformer-based models  to include self-attention (SA) as well. The SA helps in incorporation of internal correlation within a modality. For text modality, SA encodes internal correlation among words to obtain informative representation of the given sentence. Similarly, for image modality, SA helps in encoding correlation among the salient regions of image. Figure 1 shows an example for illustration. The given question is ‚ÄúWhat color is the women‚Äôs shirt?. Salient regions within image include ‚Äòwoman‚Äô. It is likely to be informative if the region consisting of ‚Äòwomen‚Äô keeps the contextual information such as ‚Äúdress she is wearing‚Äù, ‚Äúhair color‚Äù as well as correlation with other salient objects. Here, women‚Äôs shirt could be one of the more correlated region with respect to some other salient objects. The SA helps in encoding such information. Based on the advantages of each of the following modules: SA, co-attention (CA) and cascade of attention mechanisms, this work proposes combining them together in a systematic manner. Towards this objective, the proposed model builds one self- and co-attention based attention block (SCA), that combines both SA and CA in a specific way. For each of the text and image modalities, a specific SA module obtains a feature representation for the respective modality. Then the co-attention module uses self-attended representation of one modality and attends (takes attention) on the self-attended representation of the other modality to obtain cross-modality contextual representation for the second modality. Thus, there are two SA modules (one for each text and image modalities) and two co-attention modules within a single SCA block (Figure¬†2). In one complex attention block of SCA, both modalities guide itself to capture internal correlation and each other to learn the robust representation of each of the visual and textual domains. The proposed model exploits the niche attributes of the different attention mechanisms and further combines them together in a dense attention module (SCA block). A Cascade of multiple SCA blocks (CSCA) is used to extract fine-grained information. Figure¬†2 gives the overview of the tthsuperscriptùë°tht^{\\text{th}} SCA block which takes representations of question and image of the (t‚àí1)thsuperscriptùë°1th(t-1)^{\\text{th}} block as input, and provides the improved representation of question and image. To analyse and evaluate the model performance, extensive experiments are performed on two widely used VQA datasets: VQA2.0 2 and TDIUC 4. Ablation analysis experiments are also performed to understand the impact of the important components of the proposed model. Primary contributions of this work are: A dense attention based VQA model comprising of cascaded attention blocks. The core of each attention block consists of self-attention and co-attention so that the two modalities guide each other to obtain an enriched representation. Extensive performance evaluation along with ablation analysis of the proposed model on the two benchmark datasets ‚Äì TDIUC and VQA2.0.\n\nReference markers found: [355]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]355: Initial attention-based approaches [ref]355 focused on identifying salient image regions based on the text of a given question.
