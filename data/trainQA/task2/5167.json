First, the regularization-based methods [ref]16 [ref]6   , this line of work introduces additional regularization terms in the loss function to consolidate previous knowledge when learning new tasks.\nThese methods are based on regularizing the parameters corresponding to the old tasks, penalizing the feature drift on the old tasks and avoiding storing raw inputs.\nKirkpatrick et al.  [ref]6 limits changes to parameters based on their significance to the previous tasks using Fisher information;\nLwF [ref]16 is a data-focused method, and it leverages the knowledge distillation combined with a standard cross-entropy loss to mitigate forgetting and transfer knowledge by storing the previous parameters.\nThuseethan et al.   propose an indicator loss, which is associated with the distillation mechanism that preserves the existing upcoming emotion knowledge.\nYang et al.   introduce an attentive feature distillation approach to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while accounting for semantic spatial- and channel-level dependencies. The regularization-based procedures can protect privacy better because they do not collect samples from the original dataset. Second, the rehearsal-based methods      [ref]4   , which sample a limited subset of data from the previous tasks or a generative model as the memory.\nThe stored memory is replayed while learning new tasks to mitigate forgetting.\nIn ER , this memory is retrained as the extended training dataset during the current training;\nRM  is a replay method for the blurry setting;\niCaRL [ref]4 selects and stores samples closest to the feature mean of each class for replaying;\nAGEM  resets the training gradient by combining the gradient on the memory and training data;\nYe et al.   propose a Teacher-Student network framework. The Teacher module would remind the Student about the information learnt in the past. Third, the parameter isolation based methods    , which generate task-specific parameter expansion or sub-branch. When no limits apply to the size of networks, Expert Gate  grows new branches for new tasks by dedicating a model copy to each task. PackNet  iteratively assigns parameter subsets to consecutive tasks by constituting binary masks. Though the existing methods have achieved successes in SLCL, they are hardly used in MLCL directly.\nThe overlook of the partial label problem means the inevitability of more serious forgetting in MLCL, let alone the construction of multi-label relationships and reducing the forgetting of the relationships.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Class-incremental continual learning [ref]4 builds a classifier that learns a sequence of new tasks corresponding to different classes.\nThe state-of-art methods for class-incremental continual learning can be categorized into three main\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
