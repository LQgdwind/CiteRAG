In this section, we propose to define the robust Q-value solely based on the worst model.\nDefine the robust Q-value, the robust value function, and the robust occupation respectively as: For s𝑠s-rectangular uncertainty sets (in particular, for (s,a)𝑠𝑎(s,a)-rectangular), the above definition of robust value function coincides with the common one, i.e., v(P𝒰π,R𝒰π)π=min(P,R)∈𝒰⁡v(P,R)πsubscriptsuperscript𝑣𝜋subscriptsuperscript𝑃𝜋𝒰subscriptsuperscript𝑅𝜋𝒰subscript𝑃𝑅𝒰subscriptsuperscript𝑣𝜋𝑃𝑅v^{\\pi}_{(P^{\\pi}_{\\mathcal{U}},R^{\\pi}_{\\mathcal{U}})}=\\min_{(P,R)\\in\\mathcal{U}}v^{\\pi}_{(P,R)} .\nIf the uncertainty set is additionally (s,a)𝑠𝑎(s,a)-rectangular (as in 1 or  [ref]14), the above definition of robust Q-value also coincides with the common one because then, Getting back to our own definition, robust Q-value and value functions are related through: as both quantities are defined based on worst kernel and reward, i.e., Q𝒰π:=Q(P𝒰π,R𝒰π)πassignsubscriptsuperscript𝑄𝜋𝒰subscriptsuperscript𝑄𝜋subscriptsuperscript𝑃𝜋𝒰subscriptsuperscript𝑅𝜋𝒰Q^{\\pi}_{\\mathcal{U}}:=Q^{\\pi}_{(P^{\\pi}_{\\mathcal{U}},R^{\\pi}_{\\mathcal{U}})} and v𝒰π:=v(P𝒰π,R𝒰π)πassignsubscriptsuperscript𝑣𝜋𝒰subscriptsuperscript𝑣𝜋subscriptsuperscript𝑃𝜋𝒰subscriptsuperscript𝑅𝜋𝒰v^{\\pi}_{\\mathcal{U}}:=v^{\\pi}_{(P^{\\pi}_{\\mathcal{U}},R^{\\pi}_{\\mathcal{U}})}. Given an optimal robust policy π𝒰∗subscriptsuperscript𝜋𝒰\\pi^{*}_{\\mathcal{U}}, we further use P𝒰∗,R𝒰∗,v𝒰∗,Q𝒰∗,d𝒰∗subscriptsuperscript𝑃𝒰subscriptsuperscript𝑅𝒰subscriptsuperscript𝑣𝒰subscriptsuperscript𝑄𝒰subscriptsuperscript𝑑𝒰P^{*}_{\\mathcal{U}},R^{*}_{\\mathcal{U}},v^{*}_{\\mathcal{U}},Q^{*}_{\\mathcal{U}},d^{*}_{\\mathcal{U}} as a shorthand for P𝒰π𝒰∗,R𝒰π𝒰∗,v𝒰π𝒰∗,Q𝒰π𝒰∗,d𝒰π𝒰∗subscriptsuperscript𝑃subscriptsuperscript𝜋𝒰𝒰subscriptsuperscript𝑅subscriptsuperscript𝜋𝒰𝒰subscriptsuperscript𝑣subscriptsuperscript𝜋𝒰𝒰subscriptsuperscript𝑄subscriptsuperscript𝜋𝒰𝒰subscriptsuperscript𝑑subscriptsuperscript𝜋𝒰𝒰P^{\\pi^{*}_{\\mathcal{U}}}_{\\mathcal{U}},R^{\\pi^{*}_{\\mathcal{U}}}_{\\mathcal{U}},v^{\\pi^{*}_{\\mathcal{U}}}_{\\mathcal{U}},Q^{\\pi^{*}_{\\mathcal{U}}}_{\\mathcal{U}},d^{\\pi^{*}_{\\mathcal{U}}}_{\\mathcal{U}} respectively.\nFor (s,a)𝑠𝑎(s,a)-rectangular uncertainty set 𝒰sasuperscript𝒰sa\\mathcal{U}^{\\texttt{sa}}, the optimal value function is the best optimal Q-value, that is because an optimal policy deterministically takes the action with the highest Q-value [ref]20 .\nThis does no longer hold for s𝑠s-rectangular or coupled uncertainty sets, as there, an optimal policy may be stochastic .\nStill, based on Thms. 4.2 and 4.3, we get the Bellman recursion below. Let an ℓpsubscriptℓ𝑝\\ell_{p}-ball constrained uncertainty set. Then, for all (s,a)∈𝒳𝑠𝑎𝒳(s,a)\\in\\operatorname{\\mathcal{X}} and π∈Π𝜋Π\\pi\\in\\Pi, the robust Q-value satisfies the following recursion in the (s,a)𝑠𝑎(s,a) and s𝑠s-rectangular case respectively: We give proof for the (s,a)𝑠𝑎(s,a)-rectangular case only. The s𝑠s-rectangular case follows the exact same lines except that it uses Thm. 4.3 instead of Thm. 4.2. We have: ∎ The above recursion applies the standard Bellman operator on robust Q-values. We can similarly apply it on the robust value function (itself can be computed efficiently based on  [ref]14). Let an ℓpsubscriptℓ𝑝\\ell_{p}-ball constrained uncertainty set. Then, for all (s,a)∈𝒳𝑠𝑎𝒳(s,a)\\in\\operatorname{\\mathcal{X}} and π∈Π𝜋Π\\pi\\in\\Pi, the robust Q-value satisfies the following recursion in the (s,a)𝑠𝑎(s,a) and s𝑠s-rectangular case respectively:\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: .\nIf the uncertainty set is additionally (s,a)𝑠𝑎(s,a)-rectangular (as in 1 or  [ref]14), the above definition of robust Q-value also coincides with the common one because then, Getting back to our own definition, robust Q-value and value functions are related through: as both\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
