      "content": "Paper Title: Distance and Collision Probability Estimation from Gaussian Surface Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSeveral discrete- and continuous-space methodologies have been\nproposed to compute Euclidean Distance Fields (EDFs), which\nindicates distance from an obstacle using only positive values, and\nEuclidean Signed Distance Fields (ESDFs), which indicate occluded\ndistance using a negative sign. While the applications of these\nquantities are quite diverse (e.g., shape reconstruction, meshing,\netc.), we review continuous-space methods that have been\nproposed for robot navigation purposes. Collision probability\ncalculation methods under robot position uncertainty are also\ndiscussed. Gaussian Process regression has been used extensively in continuous EDF generation.\nLee et al.  model the surface point cloud using a GP implicit\nsurface (GPIS) [ref]51, which enables creating continuous\nESDFs that are limited to a short-range from the surface.\nWu et al.  propose the Log-GPIS map representation that estimates\ncontinuous EDFs further into 2D and 3D workspaces. This method models heat\ndiffusion from the surface  as a GP regression and uses the\nlogarithm of the regressed heat as the distance. The gradient is also regressed\nas part of the GP regression. The error in EDF estimates is demonstrated to be\nlower than the popular discrete-space Voxblox \napproach.\nThe downside of this method is that the logarithm operation is numerically\nunstable when the heat approaches zero, which occurs at distances far from the\nsurface.\nLe Gentil et al.  prove that the error in Log-GPIS\nEDF increases with the distance from the surface and\npropose an alternate formulation, which leverages reverting functions of covariance\nkernels for GP regression . While this method\nachieves EDFs that are relatively accurate, the numerical instability limitation\nstill exists because a logarithm operation is needed over an occupancy value\nthat gets close to zero far from the surface. Furthermore, all of the GP-based\nmethods assume a spherical robot body. In contrast, our approach is numerically\nstable far from the surface and explicitly accounts for ellipsoidal robot\nshapes. GPIS-based representations provide a variance estimate,\nwhich indicates the uncertainty in the fused map; however,\nthere remains an open research question about how to compute a\ncollision probability leveraging this variance and the robot position\nuncertainty. Our approach, however, does provide a collision\nprobability estimate. Few deep learning approaches enable EDF and gradient estimation.\nOrtiz et al.  model the signed distance function using a 4-layer multi-layer\nperceptron along with 3D positional embedding for input coordinates .\nDuring training, an upper bound on the distance is calculated from sampled free space points by approximating the location\nof the closest surface points. In larger workspaces, this method requires replaying stored keyframes\nto avoid catastrophic forgetting. Just like GP-based methods, a spherical robot body\nis assumed implicitly. Instead of the closest point, we use the notion of the closest\nellipsoid on the surface. This ellipsoid belongs to a set of ellipsoids that\ngeometrically approximate the surface GSM. The GSM is created using a\nmethodology that does not suffer from catastrophic forgetting and does not\nrequire free space data [ref]15. Note that the GP-based\nmethods mentioned earlier also do not need to account for catastrophic\nforgetting and do not use free space points. Due to this reason, the\nstate-of-the-art GP-based method in  is used\nas a baseline method for distance field and gradient comparison (Section IV). Nguyen et al.  utilize deep neural networks to predict the collision\nprobability using a depth image, uncertain partial robot state, and motion primitives\nas inputs. The network is trained in simulation environments using 1.5 million data points.\nThe Gaussian uncertainty in robot state is propagated through the network\nthrough an Unscented Transform [ref]22 of Monte Carlo samples of the Gaussian. The model uncertainty\nis obtained via the Monte Carlo dropout  approach. Both uncertainty calculation methods\ncontain randomness because of the Monte Carlo sampling. Due to this randomness, it is unclear if the uncertainty\nmeasure will generalize to real-world environments that are significantly\ndifferent from the simulation environments used for training. Furthermore, the\ntraining will also require data points obtained at various noise levels in robot\nstate, increasing the cost of prior training. In contrast, the proposed method\nis geometric and does not require prior training. There are a few methods to note that enable relevant applications without\nexplicitly creating EDFs. Dhawale et al.  demonstrate reactive collision avoidance for a\nquadcopter from a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) surface model without creating EDFs. The Gaussian\ncomponents of the GMM are approximated as isocontour ellipsoids. To simplify the\nC-space , a spherical robot approximation is leveraged to inflate the ellipsoids\nby the radius of the robot body model. Given the inflated ellipsoids, the robot\nis approximated as a point object and point-in-ellipsoid tests are used for\ndeterministic collision tests. For the same task, Florence et al. \nprovide collision probability estimates for a spherical robot\nbody. Liu et al.  use an ellipsoidal model for a quadcopter\nand use the raw point cloud maps (within a KD-Tree for scalability) for\npoint-in-ellipsoid tests. Srivastava and Michael  and Li et al.  use\nsurface and free space GMMs to compute continuous-space occupancy prediction.\nHowever, the occupancy prediction does not encode robot position uncertainty so\nthat a collision probability may be regressed. In contrast, the proposed methods\nenable continuous-space collision probability, Euclidean distance and gradient\ncalculation without using free space GMMs for ellipsoidal robots.\n\nReference markers found: [51]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]51: uncertainty are also\ndiscussed. Gaussian Process regression has been used extensively in continuous EDF generation.\nLee et al.  model the surface point cloud using a GP implicit\nsurface (GPIS) [ref]51, which enables creating continuous\nESDFs that are limited to a short-range from the surface.\nWu et al.  propose the Log-GPIS map representation that estimates\ncontinuous EDFs further into 2D\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
