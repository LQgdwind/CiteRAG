      "content": "Paper Title: On Association between Absolute and Relative Zigzag PersistenceThis research is supported by NSF grants CCF 1839252 and 2049010.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStandard persistent homology defined over a growing sequence\nof simplicial complexes is\na fundamental tool in topological data analysis (TDA). Since the advent of\npersistence algorithm¬† and its algebraic\nunderstanding¬†, various extensions of the basic concept\nhave been explored¬†   .\nThese extensions\ncreate a need for finding relations among them for a more coherent theory,\nwhich can potentially lead to improved algorithms.\nTwo excellent examples catering to this need are\nthe papers by de Silva et al.¬† and Cohen-Steiner et al.¬†,\nwhich relate standard persistence modules\nfor absolute and relative\nhomology. The original persistence algorithm¬† was designed for absolute homology,\nbut in practice persistence modules involving relative homology do appear¬† . Although\nthe persistence for relative homology can be computed\nby ‚Äòconing‚Äô on the complexes,\nthe authors of¬† show a duality between the modules arising\nfrom absolute and relative homology,\nthereby revealing an equivalence in their computations. In this paper, we explore a similar correspondence\nbetween the two types of modules but in the context of zigzag persistence.\nZigzag persistence introduced by Carlsson and de Silva¬†\nempowered TDA to deal with\nfiltrations where both insertion\nand deletion of simplices are allowed.\nIn practice, allowing deletion of simplices does make the topological tool more powerful.\nFor example, in dynamic networks¬†,\na sequence of graphs may not grow monotonically but can also shrink due to\ndisappearance of vertex connections. Zigzag persistence possesses some key differences\nfrom standard persistence. For example,\nunlike standard (non-zigzag) modules which decompose\ninto only finite and infinite intervals, zigzag modules\ndecompose into four types of intervals (see Definition¬†1).\nThis motivates us to have a fresh look at\nrelating zigzag modules arising from absolute and relative homology,\nand it\nturns out that the technique\nused in the non-zigzag case¬† does not extend straightforwardly.\nUsing\nthe Mayer-Vietoris diamond proposed by Carlsson and de Silva¬†, we arrive\nat a duality result which is weak in the sense that\nan interval from the absolute zigzag module\nmay correspond to two intervals from the relative zigzag module (see Theorem¬†6). Furthermore, this (weak) duality exists only for\nthe non-repetitive\nfiltrations where a simplex is never inserted again\nafter its deletion (see Definition¬†4). We demonstrate an application of the weak duality result\nby proposing an efficient algorithm for computing zigzag persistence\nfor non-repetitive filtrations of simplicial pùëùp-manifolds.\nThe algorithm utilizes\nthe Lefschetz duality¬† \nand a recent\nnear-linear algorithm for zigzag persistence on graphs¬†[ref]9.\nIt computes all pùëùp-th intervals\nand\nall (p‚àí1)ùëù1(p-1)-th intervals (except for one type)\nin near-linear time. This improves the current best time bound of O‚Äã(nœâ)ùëÇsuperscriptùëõùúîO(n^{\\omega}) incurred by applying the algorithm for computing general zigzag persistence¬† to this special case. One insight we gain from proving the weak duality is\nthe fact that a non-repetitive zigzag filtration\nadmits an up-down filtration as its canonical form.\nWe further discover that the up-down filtration can be converted\ninto a non-zigzag filtration\nand the barcode of the resulting filtration can be related to the original one.\nThis leads to\nan efficient algorithm for\ncomputing zigzag persistence\nfor any non-repetitive filtrations.\nNote that\nalgorithms\nfor zigzag persistence¬†  are\nmore involved (and hence slower in practice)\nthan algorithms for\nthe non-zigzag version though they have the same time complexity¬†.\nBy leveraging our results, we are able to compute zigzag persistence for\nnon-repetitive filtrations using any\nefficient software for computing standard persistence.\nIn fact, our experiments show that the\ngain in practice is substantial. However, the reader should be aware of\nthe caveat that the input\nfiltration has to be non-repetitive. The importance of this condition has not been pointed\nout in the literature before. In a sense, this condition\nis satisfied by\na milder version of zigzag persistence called levelset zigzag¬†.\nLast but not the least, our finding helps to pinpoint\nthe repetitive filtrations as the instances of zigzag filtrations\nthat fundamentally distinguish zigzag persistence\nfrom the standard persistence.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: zigzag persistence\nfor non-repetitive filtrations of simplicial pùëùp-manifolds.\nThe algorithm utilizes\nthe Lefschetz duality¬† \nand a recent\nnear-linear algorithm for zigzag persistence on graphs¬†[ref]9.\nIt computes all pùëùp-th intervals\nand\nall (p‚àí1)ùëù1(p-1)-th intervals (except for one type)\nin near-linear time.
