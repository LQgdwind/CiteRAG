      "content": "Paper Title: Asymptotic Convergence and Performance of Multi-Agent Q-learning Dynamics\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur work applies the framework of monotone games, which encompass a number of classes of\ngames, including potential  and network zero sum games [ref]27. Indeed\nrecent work has considered the question of designing games which are monotone . Most prominent in this is\nthe study of network games . These works relate the monotonicity of the game with properties of\nthe network. From a design perspective, this makes the study of monotone games rather attractive, as it becomes\npossible to make any game, be it co-operative or competitive, monotone. This fact is also exploited in , in which it was shown how any game, regardless of its structure, can be made monotone by appropriate\nparameter tuning. In addition, monotone games have been used to design online learning algorithms that\nconverge to a Nash Equilibrium  . However, many of these require the\ngradient (or estimates) of their cost functions at each step. Ideally, an online learning algorithm should require\nonly obtained rewards at each time step. To resolve this,  derive a distributed algorithm\nwhich converges to a Nash Equilibrium in monotone games. These results are advanced in  in which an algorithm is developed which converges, whilst also achieving no-regret; this was\nthe first instance of a no-regret algorithm who could provably converge in a monotone game. In a similar\nmanner,  show the convergence of the Best Response Algorithm in a class of network games which\nsatisfy the monotonicity property. Our work departs from the above by considering Q-Learning, and by lifting strong technical assumptions on the payoff\nfunctions. Specifically, we do not assume a form of the payoffs as in , or the growth of the\nfunction as in . In addition, we require no knowledge of the cost gradients as in . Finally, our work considers the generalised class of weighted monotone games, rather\nthan the unweighted case considered by the above. This class of games is also considered in [ref]35 , in which variations of online gradient descent are\nanalyzed. However, the former requires weighted strong monotonicity (which is much more restrictive even than\nstrict monotonicity) and the latter requires strong assumptions on the parameters of the learning algorithm. Our work also touches upon the Follow the Regularised Leader (FTRL) dynamic. The strongest convergence result\nregarding this dynamic in continuous time is a negative one: FTRL does not converge to a Mixed Nash\nEquilibrium , or to any equilibrium in zero sum games . The strongest\npositive result, and the one most similar to our own is [ref]38 in which it is shown that FTRL\nconverges in unweighted strictly monotone games, a more restrictive class that that analysed here. Other positive\nresults regard FTRLs local convergence to a strict Nash Equilibrium  and its\nconvergence in time average [ref]38. Our paper is structured as follows. We begin in Section 2 by outlining the setting and tools through which we analyse convergence of learning. Section 3 proceeds with our main results, namely that convergence of Q-Learning dynamics can be achieved through sufficient exploration (Theorem 1), and that non-convergent learning dynamics can outperform the equilibrium (Theorem 4). Our experiments in Section 4 validate these results by showing examples of games in which convergence occurs through increased exploration, although at the cost of decreasing payoff across all agents.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: Our work applies the framework of monotone games, which encompass a number of classes of\ngames, including potential  and network zero sum games [ref]27.
