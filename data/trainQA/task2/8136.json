      "content": "Paper Title: Evaluating the Efficacy of Instance Incremental vs. Batch Learning in Delayed Label Environments: An Empirical Study on Tabular Data Streaming for Fraud Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor instance incremental learning, we consider: Adaptive Random Forest (ARF) [ref]17: This model is one of the best performing among instance incremental algorithms [ref]17 [ref]26 [ref]20. We use ARF with the ADWIN detector . Leveraging Bagging with Hoeffding Tree as base learner (LB_HT) : We include this model in our comparison as it is the best performing model in . Leveraging Bagging with Logistic Regression as base learner (LB_LR) : We explore in this study a non tree base learner for Leveraging Bagging. More specifically we use the Logistic Regression (LR) with a Stochastic Gradient Optimizer (SGD). Alongside state-of-the-art instance incremental models, we include the following glass box algorithms for interpretability, as discussed in Section 2: Logistic Regression (LR): This model can be used in both batch or instance incremental models. In this study, we use it as an instance incremental model by combining it with a Stochastic Gradient Optimizer (SGD) Hoeffding Tree (HT) :\nThis model offers interpretable and adaptive decision rules by following paths in the tree, particularly if it‚Äôs shallow. Thus, we cap the maximum depth at 6. Additionally, we employ Naive Bayes Adaptive for leaf prediction, which enhances the performance of the traditional HT  . Hoeffding Adaptive Tree (HAT): The same model as the Hoeffding Tree, but with ADWIN  for drift handling. For all instance incremental models, we used the Python-based package River .\nAs batch incremental models, we consider: XGBoost :\nIt is a leading model in batch learning across various real-world applications and tabular learning competitions. We make XGBoost adaptive by retraining it from scratch after every new batch (Algorithm 1, line 17), referred to as r_XGBoost. Following [ref]26 , we use a stacking of the last M=3ùëÄ3M=3 retrained XGBoost models, denoted as B_XGBoost. Although stacking may increase prediction time, it helps preserve some previously learned concepts. We don‚Äôt include Adaptive XGBoost (AXGB)\nas it was already outperformed by the optimized version in B_XGBoost. Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) :\nEBM is a Generalized Additive Model with pairwise interaction terms, featuring shape functions that are piece-wise constant and optimized using a boosting mechanism. We include this model in our comparison for its inherent interpretability‚Äîits shape function can be monitored to detect changes over time‚Äîunlike XGBoost.\nSimilarly to XGBoost, we used retraining from scratch (r_EBM) and stacking (B_EBM) to make the EBM model adaptive over time. Rather than stacking naively (M=3ùëÄ3M=3) EBM models, which may compromise interpretability, we merged the shape functions111https://interpret.ml/docs/python/examples/merge-ebms.html of the stacked models into a single final EBM model. TabSRA : It is also an inherently interpretable model based on an attention mechanism called self-reinforcement . Monitoring TabSRA‚Äôs attention weights and inherent feature attributions can help to understand changes over time. We also used the retraining (r_TabSRA) to make the TabSRA model adaptive. In addition, we investigate the continual fine-tuning of the weights of an initially trained TabSRA model. The learning rate is reduced over time to avoid a catastrophic forgetting of previously learned concepts. This strategy is named u_TabSRA.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: For instance incremental learning, we consider: Adaptive Random Forest (ARF) [ref]17: This model is one of the best performing among instance incremental algorithms [ref]17 [ref]26 [ref]20.
