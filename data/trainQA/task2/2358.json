      "content": "Paper Title: HCGR: Hyperbolic Contrastive Graph Representation Learning for Session-based Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn many e-commerce online scenarios, user profiles usually cannot be obtained so that session-based recommendation has become an important solution to address anonymous recommendation. Session-based recommender (SBR) system learns users’ preferences by mining sequential patterns from users’ chronological historical behavior without user profiles to predict users’ future interests in one session.\nMost traditional Markov chain based SBR models, e.g., FPMC [ref]1, FOSSIL [ref]2, conduct sequence modeling and prediction only by considering user’s last behavior.\nLately, RNN-based models the treat historical behaviours of each user as a strictly-order, temporally dependent sequence like linguistic sentences. These methods like GRU4REC  surprisingly increase the performance in many real scenarios because of their effectiveness in storing short-term information. However, they assume that the adjacent items in a session have a fixed sequential dependence which is unable to capture the user interest variations, as a result, they are prone to introduce wrong dependencies.\nTo address this issue, later models that fusing self-attention mechanisms like SASREC, were proposed. Guo et al. [ref]4\nfurther improve the attention-based approaches by introducing specialized human sentiment factors.\nThe aforementioned attention-based methods prefer to model unidirectional message transformation between adjacent items in a sequence. Such transformation may lose the insight of the relevant information of the whole sequence.\nFor example, in a music player APP, although a user may randomly play an album or a certain type of music, which will generate different playback records, it does not mean that the user’s interest has changed. In other words, strictly modeling the user’s local click records and ignoring the global relationship may lead to overfitting.\nTo resolve the problem in attention-based methods, GNN-based models like SR-GNN  and GC-SAN  utilize graphs to capture the coherence of items within a session due to their powerful ability to represent structured data and adopt attention layers to learn long-term dependence. Despite the leading performance of GNN-based models compared with traditional SBR methods, great challenges remain.\n Challenge1:\nThe user’s interests are extensive and hierarchical, which can be expressed as a power-law distribution of items clicked by users. The existing session-based recommendation methods learn the representations in Euclidean space, which can’t effectively capture the information of such hierarchical, or in other words, tree-structured data. Challenge2:\nRecent studies have proved that hierarchical data can be better explained under Non-Euclidean geometry of low-dimensional manifolds. But in the GNN-based methods, introducing Non-Euclidean transformation will result in the discrepancy between Euclidean and Non-Euclidean space when aggregating neighbouring messages and applying attention mechanism.\n\n These challenges remain prevalent in real-world recommendation scenarios since it has been demonstrated that users’ behaviors like clicking or purchasing have prototypical characteristics of complex structures, which are generally power-law distributed   . Aforementioned, data with hierarchical structure could be well represented in hyperbolic space. This has motivated representation learning in hyperbolic space to effectively capture the information of the user behaviors with hierarchical property . Furthermore, the hyperbolic representations can naturally capture the similarity and hierarchy by their distance. To illustrate the difference between Euclidean and hyperbolic space, we visualized them in Figure 2 and Figure 2. In a two-dimensional Euclidean space as showed in Figure 2, the number of nodes increases polynomial in the center to the radius. By contrast, in two-dimensional hyperbolic space in Figure 2, the number of nodes increases exponentially in the center to the given radius, and the hyperbolic space has more powerful (exponential-level) representation ability than then Euclidean space. In conclusion, given the same radius, hyperbolic space has larger space, thereby including more nodes. Therefore, the general representational capacity of Euclidean space can be summarized as a square level, which can cause high distortion if we model the data of hierarchical relational users’ preferences. To overcome these session-based challenges above, in this paper we propose a novel graph neural network framework, namely Hyperbolic Contrastive Graph Recommender (HCGR), upon hyperbolic space, specifically, Lorentz hyperbolic space for its simplicity and stability, to optimize the underlying hierarchical embeddings. First, we embed items with dense and effective representations, which are predisposed to preserving their internal hierarchical properties in Lorentz hyperbolic space. To ensure the correctness of the necessary representations’ transformation, we utilize some specific operations based on the Lorentz hyperboloid model. Second, we construct an improved graph neural network framework and a novel message propagation mechanism to model the preferences in user behavior sequences. To enable the model better distinguish users’ preferences for different items, we propose an adaptive hyperbolic attention calculation method. Third, we introduce contrastive learning to optimize the model by considering the distance between positive and negative samples in hyperbolic space. Overall, we summarize our main contributions of this work as follows: We exploit hyperbolic item representation for session-based recommendation, to the best of our knowledge, our method is the first one to extract hierarchical information of user behaviors within a session under hyperbolic space for SBR tasks. We design a novel attention calculation approach in hyperbolic space to deal with graph information aggregating, which can’t be effectively implemented by the existing aggregation methods in Euclidean space. We introduce contrastive learning to optimize the item representation by considering the geodesic distance between positive and negative samples in Lorentz hyperbolic space. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets and one financial service industrial dataset, which show that our Lorentz hyperbolic session-based recommendation framework can achieve better performance compared to the state-of-the-art SBR methods in terms of H​i​t​R​a​t​e​@​K𝐻𝑖𝑡𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒@𝐾HitRate@K, N​D​C​G​@​K𝑁𝐷𝐶𝐺@𝐾NDCG@K and M​R​R​@​K𝑀𝑅𝑅@𝐾MRR@K, where K=𝐾absentK=10,20102010,20.
