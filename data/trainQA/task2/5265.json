      "content": "Paper Title: Contextually Enhanced ES-dRNN with Dynamic Attention for Short-Term Load Forecasting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGlobal ML forecasting models learn from all series in a dataset, however when forecasting a particular series, only inputs derived from this one series are typically used. For every series there is likely to exist one or more series in the dataset, that, if used as an additional input, would improve the forecasting accuracy. These issues have been researched in depth. In the context of statistical models we have the notion of Granger causality [ref]26, there are factor models [ref]27, [ref]28, ,  and in ML there has been quite a bit of work done on Graphical NNs , , , . In the ML context there are two main issues here: how to find a small subset of ”friendly” time series out of many, perhaps dozen or hundreds of thousands of others, and having found them, how to aggregate the features extracted, considering that just concatenating them is unlikely to succeed, because in ML systems inputs are position sensitive. Additionally, if, as is typical, the number of ”friendly” series, or neighborhood size, is a constant, it is a rigid constraint, too low for some series and too high for other series. We propose a RNN-based forecasting system composed of two tracks: the first one, the context track, processes a representative subset of series and outputs an opaque vector that, optionally after being modulated to suit a particular series, is concatenated with other features and becomes an input to the second, main forecasting track. The idea of context has been inspired by , but the context here is calculated in a quite different, and much more computationally efficient way, notably it does not use standard attention (distinct from a completely different attention mechanism used internally by adRNNCell, see below). The architecture of each track is inspired by the winning submission to the M4 forecasting competition 2018 . This hybrid and hierarchical forecasting model was composed of ES and RNN modules that are simultaneously trained by the same optimization algorithm.\nES allows for on-the-fly preprocessing of the series, i.e. deseasonalization and adaptive normalization, and thus captures the main features of the individual series. RNN is composed of several stacked long short term memory cells (LSTMs) with dilated and residual connections, which improve long-term memory performance and speed-up training. Due to the hybrid and hierarchical architecture and cross-learning on many series, the model is able to learn both local and global time series features. This and also ensembling at three levels improve forecasting accuracy. Based on this solution, in , we developed a model for mid-term load forecasting and in  we developed a model for STLF. The latter model uses a new type of recurrent cell with additional delayed states and an additional output vector. The delayed states help to model seasonalities and long-term relationships, while introducing an additional output vector allows the cell to better control the flow of information. An interesting feature of the model is that RNN learns not only the forecasting function but also the ES parameters to ensure optimal time series preprocessing. A further refinement of the STLF model proposed in  is the introduction of an internal attention mechanism that dynamically weights the inputs for the cell. In continuing the development of the STLF models based on a hybrid and hierarchical architecture combining ES and RNN, this study makes the following contribution: we propose a new STLF model which is composed of two tracks: the context track and the main track. The context track produces a dynamic context vector based on the history, up to the moment, of a representative group of series. This vector is modulated to adjust to the forecast series and introduced as an additional input to the main track RNN. It extends per-series input data with information contained in the context series and thus supports forecasting individual series. The model inherits the features of its predecessors, i.e. attentive dilated recurrent cells, multiple dilated recurrent layers stacked with hierarchical dilations, cross-learning ability, ability to learn the ES smoothing coefficients, and ability to produce both point forecasts and predictive intervals (PIs).\nWe provide the open-source code of our model in the github repository . In the experimental part of the work covering STLF for 35 European countries, we show that our proposed model is more accurate than its predecessor and 16 baseline models, including both statistical and ML models. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. First, the forecasting model is described in Section II, which includes the STLF problem, model architecture and components, and loss function. Then, an extensive experimental evaluation is provided in Section III. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section IV.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: that, if used as an additional input, would improve the forecasting accuracy.
