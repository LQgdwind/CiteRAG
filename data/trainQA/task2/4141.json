Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

[ref]14, Yang et al. [ref]15, Araci , and\nDeSola et al. , all of which are pre-trained to adapt to\ndifferent financial domains. Originally, in the general domain, BERT\n[ref]6 was pre-trained on two corpora: BooksCorpus (0.8 billion words),\nand English Wikipedia (2.5 billion words), forming a total of 3.3 billion\nwords, so the idea of these financial language models is to take the\noriginal model, and pre-train it on their respective financial corpora. Araci  was the first to propose FinBERT as a pre-trained\ndomain-adapted BERT [ref]6 on a corpus called TRC2-financial, which\nincludes 46,143 documents with more than 29M words and nearly 400K\nsentences, from a set of Reuters news stories.\nIn experimentation, they saw a 15% increase in accuracy for classification\ntasks, a significant margin. Liu et al. [ref]14 focused on financial news\nand dialogues present on websites, and collected three financial corpora: 13\nmillion financial news (15GB) and financial articles (9GB) from Financial\nWeb, totaling 24GB and 6.38 billion words; financial articles from Yahoo!\nFinance, totaling 19GB and 4.71 billion words; and question-answer pairs\nabout financial issues from Reddit, totaling 5GB and 1.62 billion words.\nThey pre-trained their model on these corpora to adapt it to the financial\nnews and dialogues domain. In experimentation, they saw their model\noutperform BERT [ref]6 on all the financial tasks in their experiments,\nin terms of accuracy, precision, and recall [ref]14. Yang et al.\n[ref]15 focused on financial and business communications that companies\nproduce, and collected a corpus of three types of data: 10-K and 10-Q\nreports, totaling 2.5 billion word tokens; earnings call transcripts,\ntotaling 1.3 billion word tokens; and analyst reports, totaling 1.1 billion\nword tokens [ref]15.\nThey report that their model outperforms BERT [ref]6 in three sentiment\nanalysis tasks, all by significant margins [ref]15. DeSola et\nal.  introduced another domain-specific pre-trained\nlanguage model, also named FinBERT, for financial NLP applications. This\nmodel was trained on the 10-K filings from 1998 to 1999 and from 2017 to\n2019, totaling 497 million words, and it showed better performance than BERT\non the masked LM and next sequence prediction tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: In terms of domain-adapted pre-trained LMs, in the English-speaking Finance\nsphere, four models have been proposed and implemented, all named FinBERT:\nLiu et al.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
