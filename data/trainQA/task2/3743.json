      "content": "Paper Title: SD-Conv: Towards the Parameter-Efficiency of Dynamic Convolution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur main experiments are implemented on the ImageNet dataset , which is one of the most challenging image classification datasets with 1,000 classes, including 1,281,167 images for training and 50,000 images for validation. CNN Backbones. We use ResNet  and MobileNetV2 [ref]48 families for experiments, covering both light-weight CNN architectures and larger ones. Specifically, we choose ResNet-10, ResNet-18, ResNet-50 and MobileNetV2 (1.0√ó,0.75√ó,0.5√ó1.0\\times,0.75\\times,0.5\\times) as the backbones. Experimental Setup. We validate the effectiveness of our method by replacing dynamic convolution for all convolution layers except the first layer. Each layer has k=4ùëò4k=4 experts with the reduce ratio as 161616 for the attention block in dynamic convolution . We use an SGD optimizer [ref]47 with 0.9 momentum, following cosine learning rate scheduling and warmup strategy. The learning rate rises to the max learning rate linearly in the first 10 epochs and is scheduled to arrive at zero within a single cosine cycle. When generating binary masks, we set constant T=11024ùëá11024T=\\frac{1}{1024} to ensure M~~ùëÄ\\tilde{M} follows approximately 0/1 binary values. The scale factor ŒªssubscriptùúÜùë†\\lambda_{s} of sparse penalty ‚Ñís‚Äã(œÑ,s)subscript‚Ñíùë†ùúèùë†\\mathcal{L}_{s}(\\tau,s) is fixed as 0.01. We follow Zhou¬†et al.¬†‚Äôs temperature annealing strategy to avoid the unstable output values of the softmax function in the first epoch. We train the ResNet models for 100 epochs, and the max learning rate is 0.1. For the MobilenetV2 models, we train them for 300 epochs, and the max learning rate is 0.05. The weight decay is 4e-5 for all models. Main Results. Table 2 and 2 show the comparison between SD-Conv and other convolution architectures in two CNN architectures (ResNet and MobilenetV2). Our baselines include the static convolution, CondConv  and DY-Conv . We set s=50%ùë†percent50s=50\\% to make the overall sparsity over 50%. As shown, sparse dynamic convolution achieves significant performance improvement with a much smaller model size compared to vanilla dynamic convolution. For ResNet-18, sparse dynamic convolution has only 54.3% of the parameters of vanilla dynamic convolution. For MobilenetV2-1.0, our method only requires 53.5% of the parameters of dynamic convolution to achieve the same level of accuracy. The most prominent advantage of sparse dynamic convolution is its low computational cost. Owing to the sparse computational kernel W^^ùëä\\hat{W}, our method requires much fewer FLOPs in the convolution operation that acts as the dominant part of the overall FLOPs. The computational cost of our method is even less than that of static convolution, while all the other dynamic networks introduce extra computational costs. For example, sparse dynamic convolution only has 87.3% of FLOPs of static convolution in MobilenetV2-1.0. Robustness. Traditional network structures are robust to the images perturbed with small Gaussian noise, while networks pruned with random masks can even have higher robustness than normal ones [ref]38. To check whether SD-Conv also enjoys such property or even has better robustness in this scenario, we also consider the model‚Äôs endurance of noise attack. We conduct an robustness evaluation on ImageNet for ResNet-50 . Inspired by Luo¬†et al.¬†‚Äôs work [ref]38, we feed input images with Gaussian noises z‚àºN‚Äã(0,œÉ2)similar-toùëßùëÅ0superscriptùúé2z\\sim N\\left(0,\\sigma^{2}\\right) to networks. Table 3 shows the robustness evaluation on random noise attack, we set the sparse ratio sùë†s as 20% and 80% separately for our model. Disturbed by the same intensity of noise, we can see that our networks have the highest accuracy and gain up to 0.5% improvement compared to dynamic architectures. \n\n\n\n\nModel\nOption\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n\nResNet-50\nStatic\n68.2\n65.4\n58.4\n54.2\n\nDY-Conv\n68.7\n66.1\n59.2\n55.4\n\nSD-Conv\n69.1\n66.5\n59.5\n55.9\n\nResNet-18\nStatic\n60.7\n53.9\n49.8\n45.1\n\nDY-Conv\n61.1\n54.8\n50.4\n46.3\n\nSD-Conv\n61.3\n55.2\n50.5\n46.7\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: one of the most challenging image classification datasets with 1,000 classes, including 1,281,167 images for training and 50,000 images for validation.
