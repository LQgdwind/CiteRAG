      "content": "Paper Title: Model Inversion Attack against Transfer Learning: Inverting a Model without Accessing It\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nData augmentation techniques have been widely used in deep learning to address the problem of limited data [ref]31.\nThese techniques have also been combined with one-shot learning which aims to learn classifiers with only a few labeled examples of each class .\nHere, we also use one-shot learning with data augmentation to train a shadow model. We adopt two data augmentation approaches for one-shot learning:\nthe noise-based approach   8 and the jigsaw-based approach  [ref]44.\nThe rationale for the noise-based approach is that adding proper noise to a given sample can generate its “neighboring” samples\nwith the same main features as the given sample.\nFurther, the jigsaw-based approach is able to generate the samples that intentionally destroy the spatial coherence of the given sample .\nThus, the jigsawed samples typically sit at a large distance away from the given sample in the data space.\nThese generated samples are expected to contain various features of the class to which the given sample belongs.\nHence, using these samples could train a shadow model to mimic the student model. The noise-based data augmentation approach     Formally, let xc∗subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑐x^{*}_{c} be a given sample for class c𝑐c,\nwhere class c𝑐c is one of the student model S𝑆S’s classes and xc∗subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑐x^{*}_{c} is possessed by the adversary.\nTo add proper noise to xc∗subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑐x^{*}_{c}, the adversary carefully crafts noise to make the noisy samples semantically similar to xc∗subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑐x^{*}_{c},\nnamely these noisy samples can be classified as the same class as xc∗subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑐x^{*}_{c}.\nTo achieve this goal, the adversary first feeds xc∗subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑐x^{*}_{c} to the teacher model T𝑇T\nand receives the output of the K𝐾Kth layer of model T𝑇T denoted as TK​(xc∗)subscript𝑇𝐾subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑐T_{K}(x^{*}_{c}). The adversary then introduces a mask mcsubscript𝑚𝑐m_{c} for xc∗subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑐x^{*}_{c} .\nEach dimension i𝑖i of xc∗subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑐x^{*}_{c}, i.e., xc∗​[i]subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑐delimited-[]𝑖x^{*}_{c}[i], is associated with a scalar mc​[i]∈ subscript𝑚𝑐delimited-[]𝑖01m_{c}[i]\\in .\nTo generate a mask mcsubscript𝑚𝑐m_{c}, the adversary defines a perturbation operator ψ𝜓\\psi: where η𝜂\\eta is a random noise sampled from Gaussian distribution 𝒩​(0,σ2)𝒩0superscript𝜎2\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^{2}).\nThus, when mc​[i]=1subscript𝑚𝑐delimited-[]𝑖1m_{c}[i]=1, no noise is added to xc∗​[i]subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑐delimited-[]𝑖x^{*}_{c}[i]; when mc​[i]=0subscript𝑚𝑐delimited-[]𝑖0m_{c}[i]=0, some random noise replaces xc∗​[i]subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑐delimited-[]𝑖x^{*}_{c}[i].\nThe adversary aims to find mcsubscript𝑚𝑐m_{c} such that xc∗subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑐x^{*}_{c}’s main features can be preserved while those remaining features are perturbed.\nTo this end, the adversary defines a learning problem: where the first term D​(⋅,⋅)𝐷⋅⋅D(\\cdot,\\cdot) measures the Euclidean distance between two vectors,\nand the second term λ⋅‖mc‖1⋅𝜆subscriptnormsubscript𝑚𝑐1\\lambda\\cdot||m_{c}||_{1} encourages most of the mask to be close to 111, i.e., perturbing a small part of xc∗subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑐x^{*}_{c}.\nThe parameter λ𝜆\\lambda balances the two terms.\nIn particular, the learning problem tries to minimize the distance between a generated sample ψ​(xc∗;mc)𝜓subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑐subscript𝑚𝑐\\psi(x^{*}_{c};m_{c}) and the given sample xc∗subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑐x^{*}_{c}.\nNote that the adversary is not minimizing the direct distance between the two samples.\nInstead, she feeds the two samples into the teacher model T𝑇T\nand receives the outputs of the K𝐾Kth of model T𝑇T, i.e., TK​(ψ​(xc∗;mc))subscript𝑇𝐾𝜓subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑐subscript𝑚𝑐T_{K}(\\psi(x^{*}_{c};m_{c})) and TK​(xc∗)subscript𝑇𝐾subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑐T_{K}(x^{*}_{c}).\nThe adversary then minimizes the distance between TK​(ψ​(xc∗;mc))subscript𝑇𝐾𝜓subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑐subscript𝑚𝑐T_{K}(\\psi(x^{*}_{c};m_{c})) and TK​(xc∗)subscript𝑇𝐾subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑐T_{K}(x^{*}_{c}).\nWe reason that if two samples can be classified as the same class by the student model S𝑆S, they must have very similar features.\nAs the student model S𝑆S is trained by transferring parameters from the teacher model T𝑇T,\nmodel T𝑇T can be used as a feature extractor whose output of the K𝐾Kth layer contains the features of the input sample.\nOnce the mask mcsubscript𝑚𝑐m_{c} is created, the adversary uses the perturbation operator ψ𝜓\\psi to generate a set of neighboring samples ψ​(xc∗;mc)𝜓subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑐subscript𝑚𝑐\\psi(x^{*}_{c};m_{c}) of xc∗subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑐x^{*}_{c}. The jigsaw-based data augmentation approach    \nIn addition to neighboring samples, the adversary also needs extra samples\nthat are far away from, but still in the same class as, the given sample xc∗subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑐x^{*}_{c}.\nFor this, the adversary uses the jigsaw-based approach.\nConcretely, the adversary collects a set of unlabeled auxiliary samples, DAsubscript𝐷𝐴D_{A}, which share their main features with xc∗subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑐x^{*}_{c}.\nFor example, if xc∗subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑐x^{*}_{c} is a woman’s facial image, the auxiliary samples may also be images of women’s faces but not the same person.\nThe adversary, then, resizes these auxiliary samples to the same size as xc∗subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑐x^{*}_{c}.\nNext, she introduces a binary mask Mc∈{0,1}W×Hsubscript𝑀𝑐superscript01𝑊𝐻M_{c}\\in\\{0,1\\}^{W\\times H} indicating where to drop out and fill in from two images.\nHere, W𝑊W and H𝐻H denote the width and height of xc∗subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑐x^{*}_{c}, respectively.\nThe mask Mcsubscript𝑀𝑐M_{c} is used to mix the two samples.\nFormally, given a sample x𝑥x from the auxiliary set DAsubscript𝐷𝐴D_{A}, the mixed sample x~c∗subscriptsuperscript~𝑥𝑐\\tilde{x}^{*}_{c} is computed as where 𝟏={1}W×H1superscript1𝑊𝐻\\mathbf{1}=\\{1\\}^{W\\times H} is a binary mask filled with ones and ⊙direct-product\\odot is element-wise multiplication.\nThe adversary aims to find an Mcsubscript𝑀𝑐M_{c} such that the mixed sample x~c∗subscriptsuperscript~𝑥𝑐\\tilde{x}^{*}_{c} has similar features to xc∗subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑐x^{*}_{c}.\nTo this end, the adversary defines a learning problem: Here, the mask generated using Eq. 5 is similar to Eq. 3.\nThe main difference is that Eq. 5 does not include the second term as in Eq. 3, λ⋅‖mc‖1⋅𝜆subscriptnormsubscript𝑚𝑐1\\lambda\\cdot||m_{c}||_{1}.\nThis means that Eq. 5 does not encourage using a small part of an auxiliary sample x𝑥x to mix with xc∗subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑐x^{*}_{c},\nbut, rather, focuses only on the features of the mixed sample x~c∗subscriptsuperscript~𝑥𝑐\\tilde{x}^{*}_{c} and the given sample xc∗subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑐x^{*}_{c}.\nHence, to a large extent, Eq. 5 avoids generating neighboring samples of xc∗subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑐x^{*}_{c}. Finally, the noisy samples and jigsawed samples are labelled as c𝑐c and stored in a dataset, denoted as Da​u​gcsubscriptsuperscript𝐷𝑐𝑎𝑢𝑔D^{c}_{aug}.\nThe adversary then uses the same approaches to generate noisy and jigsawed samples for the other classes of the student model S𝑆S.\nWhen a dataset Da​u​gcsubscriptsuperscript𝐷𝑐𝑎𝑢𝑔D^{c}_{aug} for each class c𝑐c has been built, the adversary trains a shadow model A𝐴A to mimic model S𝑆S.\nAs the adversary knows which transfer learning method is used to train model S𝑆S,\nshe, thus, adopts the same method to train the shadow model A𝐴A using a cross-entropy loss function.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: Data augmentation techniques have been widely used in deep learning to address the problem of limited data [ref]31.\nThese techniques have also been combined with one-shot learning which aims to learn classifiers with only a few labeled examples of each class .\nHere, we also use one-shot learning with data\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
