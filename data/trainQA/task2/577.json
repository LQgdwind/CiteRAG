      "content": "Paper Title: From Spectrum Wavelet to Vertex Propagation: Graph Convolutional Networks Based on Taylor Approximation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLearning and signal processing over graph models have gained significant\ntraction owing to their demonstrated abilities\nto capture underlying\ndata interactions.\nModeling each data point as a node and their interactions as edges in a graph,\ngraph-based methods have been adopted in various signal\nprocessing and analysis tasks, such as\nsemi-supervised classification  , spectral clustering  [ref]4,\nlink prediction [ref]5 and graph classification .\nFor example, in , an undirected graph is constructed based on a Gaussian-distance model to\ncapture geometric correlations among points in a\npoint cloud, with which several graph-based filters\nhave been developed to extract contour features\nof objects. Among various graph-based tools, graph signal processing\n(GSP) has emerged as an efficient analytical tool for processing graph-modeled signals ,.\nBased on a graph Fourier space defined by the eigenspace of the representing adjacency\nor Laplacian matrix,\nGSP filters have found applications in\npractice, including bridge health monitoring 0, point cloud denoising 1, and image classification 2.\nLeveraging graph Fourier transform 3, graph wavelet 4 and graph spectral convolution 5\ncan extract additional features from graph signals. For example,\ngraph convolutional filters have been successful in\nedge detection\nand video segmentation 6. Although GSP-based spectral filtering has demonstrated successes in\na variety of applications, it still suffers from the high-complexity\nof spectrum computation and the need to\nselect suitable propagation models.\nTo efficiently extract signal features and integrate traditional GSP\nwithin the machine learning framework,\ngraph convolutional networks (GCN)  have\nbeen developed for semi-supervised classification problems.\nApproximating graph spectral convolution with first-order Chebyshev expansions,\nGCN has been effective in such learning tasks. Furthermore,\ndifferent GCN-related graph learning architectures,\nincluding personalized propagation\nof neural predictions (PPNP)7 and N-GCN8,\nhave also been developed to process graph-represented datasets.\nHowever, some limitations remain with the traditional GCN based on Chebyshev expansions. For example,\ntraditional GCN\nrequires strong assumptions on maximum eigenvalues and Chebyshev coefficients\nfor approximating spectral convolution,\nat the cost of possible information loss\nwhen compared against basic\nconvolutional filters.\nFurthermore, systematic selection and design of graph representations for GCN remain elusive. Our goal is to improve GCN by exploring its\nrelationship with GSP.\nSpecifically in this work, we explore the\nprocess from spectrum wavelet\nto vertex propagation, and investigate\nalternative designs for\ngraph convolutional networks. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We revisit graph spectral convolution in GSP and define\nconditions for approximating spectrum wavelet via propagation in the vertex domain.\nThese conditions could provide insights to design GCN layers. We propose alternative propagation models for the GCN layers and\ndevelop a Taylor-based graph convolutional networks (TGCN) based on the aforementioned approximation conditions. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed frameworks\nover several well-known datasets in comparison with\nother GCN-type and graph-based methods in node\nsignal classification. We also provide an interpretability discussion on the use of Taylor expansion, together with guidelines on selecting\nsuitable graph representations for GCN layers. In terms of the manuscript organization, we first provide an\noverview on graph-based tools and review the fundamentals\nof GCN in Section II and Section III, respectively. Next,\nwe present the theoretical motivation and basic design of the\nTaylor-based graph convolutional networks (TGCN) in Section IV.\nSection V discusses the interpretability\nof Taylor expansion in approximation, and highlights\nthe difference between TGCN and traditional GCN-based methods.\nWe report the experimental results of the proposed TGCN framework\non different datasets in Section VI, before concluding\nin Section VII.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: node and their interactions as edges in a graph,\ngraph-based methods have been adopted in various signal\nprocessing and analysis tasks, such as\nsemi-supervised classification  , spectral clustering  [ref]4,\nlink prediction [ref]5 and graph classification .\nFor example, in , an undirected graph is constructed based on a Gaussian-distance model to\ncapture geometric correlations among points in\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
