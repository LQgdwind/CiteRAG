      "content": "Paper Title: Language Conditioned Imitation Learning over Unstructured Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImitation learning   is a popular framework for acquiring complex robotic skills from raw onboard sensors.\nTraditionally, imitation learning has been applied to learning individual skills from structured and isolated human demonstrations 9  . These collection requirements are difficult to scale to real world scenarios, where robots are expected to be generalists—capable of autonomously performing a wide variety of skills. As we consider deploying imitation learning in this setting, a critical challenge is scale: how can we lessen the data requirements of learning each new skill? Is it possible instead to learn many skills simultaneously from large amounts of unstructured, unlabeled demonstration data 6 [ref]26 4? Recent works have focused on scaling up multitask imitation learning over unstructured data [ref]8 [ref]26. However, these approaches typically assume that tasks are specified to the agent at test time via mechanisms like one-hot task selectors 7 3, goal images  1 [ref]26, or target configurations of the state space 4. While these types of conditioning are straightforward to provide in simulation, they are often impractical to provide in open-world settings. Thus, another important consideration when deploying imitation learning in everyday settings is scalable task specification: how can untrained users instruct robot behavior? This motivates robots that can follow free-form natural language instructions. Training agents to follow instructions is an active area of research in the broader machine learning community , yet it remains a difficult open challenge. Prior approaches have trained agents that map observations and language inputs directly to actions using neural networks, but often make assumptions that limit their applicability to robotics. Typical studies involve 2D observation spaces (e.g. games  2  2 and gridworlds ), simplified actuators, (e.g. binary pick and place primitives 8 8), or synthetic predefined language 7   . In this work, we study the setting of human language conditioned robotic manipulation (Fig. 1, step 3).\nIn this setting, a single agent must execute a series of visual manipulation tasks in a row, each expressed in free-form natural language, e.g. “open the door all the way to the right…now grab the block…now push the red button…now open the drawer”. Furthermore, agents in this scenario are expected to be able to perform any combination of subtasks in any order.\nThis is the first version of instruction following, to our knowledge, that combines: natural language conditioning, high-dimensional pixel inputs, 8-DOF continuous control, and complex tasks like long-horizon robotic object manipulation.\nText conditioning is also a new and difficult setting for goal-directed imitation learning [ref]26 [ref]8, which introduces important new research questions. For example, how can we learn the mapping between language and actions with the fewest language labels? How can we leverage large unstructured demonstration datasets that have no language labels? How can we follow the maximum number of instructions at test time, given a finite training set? To address this setting, we propose a simple approach for combining imitation learning with free-form text conditioning (Fig. 1).\nOur method consists of only standard supervised learning subroutines, and learns perception, language understanding, and control end-to-end as a single neural network.\nCritically, unlike prior work in instruction following, our method can leverage large amounts of unstructured and unlabeled demonstration data (i.e. with no language or task labels). We show this reduces the burden of language annotation to less than 1% of total data.\nTo scale up the maximum amount of instructions our agent can follow at test time, we introduce a simple technique for combining any language conditioned policy with large pretrained language models  6. We find that this simple modification allows our agent to follow thousands of new synonym instructions at test time, without requiring that new robot demonstrations be collected for each synonym.\nWe believe that the capabilities proposed here of learning from unlabeled demonstrations, end-to-end learning of text conditioned visuomotor policies, and following new synonym instructions without new robot data constitute important steps towards scalable robot learning systems. We evaluate our method in a dynamically accurate simulated 3D tabletop environment with a fixed set of objects. Our experiments show that a language conditioned visuomotor policy trained with our method can perform many complex robotic manipulation skills in a row specified entirely with natural language (see video), outperforming conventional imitation baselines trained on structured data. Contributions To summarize the contributions of this work, we: introduced a setting of human language conditioned robotic visual manipulation. introduced a simple learning method for combining free-form text conditioning with multitask imitation learning. introduced multicontext imitation learning, applicable to any contextual imitation learning setup, allowing us to train a language conditioned policy over mostly unstructured and unlabeled demonstrations (i.e. with no task or language labels). demonstrated that the resulting language conditioned visuomotor policy can follow many free-form human text instructions over a long horizon in a simulated 3D tabletop setting, i.e. “open the door…now pick up the block…now press the red button” (see video). introduced a simple way to combine any language conditioned policy with large pretrained language models. We show this improves manipulation performance and allows an agent to be robust to thousands of new synonym instructions at test time, in 16 languages, without requiring new demonstrations for each synonym.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: how can we lessen the data requirements of learning each new skill?
