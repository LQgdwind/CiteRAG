Variable nodes are only connected to factor nodes and vice versa. GBP performs marginal inference, where it computes the per-variable marginal posterior distributions. The marginal inference proceeds iteratively via message passing between variable and factor nodes, which can in principle happen in many different types of patterns but still with convergent behaviour. GBP is guaranteed to compute the exact marginal means on convergence, although the same is unfortunately not true for the variances as they are often overconfident for loopy graphs . Thus when it converges, GBP yields the same mean as the maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference produced by a centralised solver.\nThere are generally no convergence guarantees for GBP, but there are certain conditions under which it is known to converge and methods that can improve its chances of convergence . This section summarises the basic operation of GBP.\nFor more detailed derivation, refer to FutureMapping 2  or ‘A visual introduction to Gaussian Belief Propagation’ [ref]42. We represent the Gaussian distribution in information form as: where Λ=Σ−1monospace-Λsuperscriptmonospace-Σ1{{\\mathtt{\\Lambda}}}={{\\mathtt{\\Sigma}}}^{-1} and 𝜼=Λ​𝝁𝜼monospace-Λ𝝁{{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}}}={{\\mathtt{\\Lambda}}}{{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}}.\nIn GBP where we have Nvsubscript𝑁𝑣N_{v} variables and Nfsubscript𝑁𝑓N_{f} factors, variables V={𝐯i}i=1:Nv𝑉subscriptsubscript𝐯𝑖:𝑖1subscript𝑁𝑣V=\\{{{\\mathbf{v}}}_{i}\\}_{i=1:N_{v}} are assumed to be Gaussian; thus, each variable has a belief b​(𝐯i)=𝒩−1​(𝐯i;𝜼i,Λi)𝑏subscript𝐯𝑖superscript𝒩1subscript𝐯𝑖subscript𝜼𝑖subscriptmonospace-Λ𝑖b({{\\mathbf{v}}}_{i})=\\mathcal{N}^{-1}({{\\mathbf{v}}}_{i};{{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}}}_{i},{{\\mathtt{\\Lambda}}}_{i}).\nFactors F={fi}i=1:Nf𝐹subscriptsubscript𝑓𝑖:𝑖1subscript𝑁𝑓F=\\{f_{i}\\}_{i=1:N_{f}} are a probabilistic Gaussian constraint on or between the variables.\nWe define neighbourhood n​(𝐱)𝑛𝐱n({{\\mathbf{x}}}) to indicate the set of adjacent nodes connected via an edge to node 𝐱𝐱{{\\mathbf{x}}} in the factor graph, where 𝐱𝐱{{\\mathbf{x}}} may be a variable or a factor. GBP can be divided into local operations at the variables, local operations at the factors, and message passing between them which we now detail.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: its chances of convergence .
