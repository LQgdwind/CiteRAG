      "content": "Paper Title: Theoretically Achieving Continuous Representation of Oriented Bounding Boxes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nObject detection constitutes a fundamental task within the realm of computer vision. In conventional object detection scenarios , the commonplace approach involves the localization of objects using Horizontal Bounding Boxes (HBB). However, in many real-world settings such as remote sensing   and scene text [ref]17 [ref]11, where objects exhibit arbitrary orientations, HBBs are inadequate in precisely delineating object boundaries. To overcome this issue, Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB) , conceptualized as rotated rectangles, have been introduced as a more suitable representation for Oriented Object Detection (OOD). Various models have been proposed for OOD     2. However, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(b), prevalent representation methods for OBBs exhibit discontinuity issues, encoding similar OBBs into distinct vectors. This introduces challenges in training neural networks as regression targets for similar input features may differ significantly, potentially causing confusion and hindering the training process. The relationship between two OBBs can be conceptualized as one being transformed into the other through geometric operations: translation, rotation, scaling, and aspect ratio changes. While translation and scaling are relatively benign, rotation and aspect ratio changes are primary sources of discontinuity. Rotation discontinuity, often referred to as the “Boundary Problem” 3 or “Rotation Sensitive Error” 1, stems from the periodicity of rotation angles. Although prior efforts 3 5  have addressed this, most of them still suffer from discontinuity arising from changes in aspect ratio. Some other methods, e.g. Gliding Vertex 2, aim to mitigate aspect ratio discontinuity but still struggle with rotation discontinuity. The discontinuity phenomena emerge during the encoding of OBBs into the regression target. Consequently, they can be termed encoding discontinuity. Additionally, existing methods aim at resolving the encoding discontinuity issue, yet meanwhile would often bring about decoding discontinuity, namely Decoding Incompleteness (DI) and Decoding Ambiguity (DA). DI arises when OBBs cannot be accurately represented, often attributed to angle discretization and classification as exemplified by CSL 3 in Fig. 1(c). DA, on the other hand, pertains to instances where distinct OBBs share similar representations, rendering predicted OBBs sensitive to minor disturbances in the model’s output, exemplified by GWD 6 in Fig. 1(d). Fundamentally, DI and DA result in decoded OBBs lacking continuity concerning their representation. Hence, we categorize DI and DA as decoding discontinuities. The decoding discontinuities bring precision errors and directly degrade the prediction precision. Due to the absence of a rigorous definition, prior approaches have often addressed discontinuity issues incompletely. To address this, we introduce formal continuity metrics, evaluating previous methods using these benchmarks. As a comprehensive solution to discontinuity problems, we propose Continuous OBB (COBB)—a novel, continuous OBB representation satisfying all defined metrics.\nCOBB employs nine parameters derived from continuous functions based on the outer Horizontal Bounding Box (HBB) and OBB area. This ensures continuity as the outer HBB and OBB area undergo continuous changes during shape transformations.\nOur COBB can be easily integrated into existing OOD methods by simply replacing their original representations of OBB with ours. We have developed a benchmark using the detection toolbox JDet of Jittor  which is an open-source deep learning framework friendly to vision tasks. In particular, a fair comparison across different models is made by aligning the data augmentation schemes and diverse techniques. Our experiments on this benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness\nof COBB across diverse datasets and baseline detectors, particularly demonstrating advantages in high-precision object detection. Notably, it achieves a 3.95% improvement in mAP75subscriptmAP75\\text{mAP}_{75} when applied to Faster R-CNN on the DOTA Dataset. Detailed results are presented in Sec. 5. Our contributions encompass the following aspects: We systematically analyze the inherent discontinuity issues in existing OBB representation methods for OOD, and introduce formal metrics to assess their continuity. Building upon our findings, we introduce COBB, a fully continuous representation of OBBs. We construct a new benchmark for fair comparisons among OOD methods. Experiments on this benchmark validate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting its advantages in high-precision OOD.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: scenarios , the commonplace approach involves the localization of objects using Horizontal Bounding Boxes (HBB).
