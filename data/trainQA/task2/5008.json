      "content": "Paper Title: ON-DEMAND-FL: A Dynamic and Efficient Multi-Criteria Federated Learning Client Deployment Scheme\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, researchers have made significant contributions to federated learning’s communication, cost, security, privacy, and accuracy . In this section, we provide an overview of the recent related work in the literature. The authors of  emphasized the significance of managing IoT resources while installing services on them utilizing lightweight technology like Docker containerization. A fog-formation on-demand architecture was given by the authors in . Fog devices often have specified locations and conduct specific services. The authors used containerization technology to deploy containers quickly and install the required services on the devices in order to increase device availability. Additionally, based on this design, fog devices can now be installed and made available to use whenever and wherever volunteers are located. The developers of  extended on this architecture by proposing an on-demand micro-services deployment with the lowest possible cost while maintaining reachability between the desired customers and the accessible vehicular fog clusters. Furthermore, the authors in [ref]19 tried to operate the placement of services proactively using Deep Reinforcement Learning.\nWe make use of this architecture in our work to dynamically allocate and deploy prepared clients to take part in a federated learning round using containers. In , the authors find a solution to the issue of a bottleneck when there are a lot of customers in FL. The authors suggested a system that only chooses a few clients that are carrying representative gradient data to send changes to the server. Submodularity was used by the writers of this research to encourage the diversity of the chosen clients, which helped them achieve their goals. According to , it is not necessary to select a maximum number of clients throughout each round as most of the proposed client selection approaches concentrate when selecting the maximum number of clients who can update their models. We can reduce training loss and increase accuracy by choosing fewer clients in the early rounds and more in the latter ones. The authors of  suggested a dynamic optimization based on a trade-off between increasing selection and lowering participant clients’ energy usage. Using optimization techniques, some strategies  try to balance the trade-off between the client consumption and the learning rate. The authors in  developed a new sampling technique that combines customers into pools for easy selection and summarizes their attributes in a single floating point. In addition, the suggested model achieves 50–80% faster convergence in a high-class imbalance and a low-data environment.\nAuthors in  attempted to improve the routing protocols’ level of service and privacy. They were successful in segmenting the routing domain into advantageous subdomains, and federated reinforcement learning is used to maintain privacy. The authors in  proposed an effective FL-based algorithm for anomaly detection. Multiple local deep reinforcement learning models were used to build the FL, which prevents privacy leakage while also suggesting a leaking technique to boost prediction. Additionally, authors of  utilized FL and Blockchain to offer a trustworthy and secure energy solution for trade between numerous businesses. The authors in  suggested deep federated learning for health care data. Recently, researchers started to focus on healthcare systems [ref]28. For instance, in order to diagnose COVID-19,  suggested a clustered FL method. For selecting clients, the authors of  suggested a multi-criteria model. The system takes into account the clients’ resources to forecast the amount of time needed to complete the jobs without stopping the process until convergence. Additionally, according to a report by , IoT and mobile devices can get quite active at certain times of the day. As a result, the number of clients participating in the FL process significantly relies on the time of day, with a low number during the day and an increase of 4x at night that may result in the discarding of certain learning rounds. In order to guarantee a balanced, impartial model, the developers in  suggested a new scheduling architecture based on the historical participation of each edge device. The authors of , , and  considered resource capacities. , , and  all focused on the trade-off between the amount of clients chosen in each round, while  and  also considered the time of day for choosing clients, and communication costs were taken into account by the authors in . Authors in , , , and  target the use of FL in applications without taking into consideration the availability of enough clients. If there are not enough clients available to participate in FL, none of the methods for selecting and optimizing client selection described previously is applicable. In this paper, we focus on the issue of client availability in various areas. To the best of our knowledge, no prior research work has focused on the ability to execute machine learning models in environments that are not set up for training or do not have the flexibility to add new devices. Furthermore, none has provided the ability to deploy clients instantly whenever and wherever there are volunteer devices. This paper concentrates on areas with lots of data that helps improve the model, while making more clients available for learning.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: on-demand micro-services deployment with the lowest possible cost while maintaining reachability between the desired customers and the accessible vehicular fog clusters.
