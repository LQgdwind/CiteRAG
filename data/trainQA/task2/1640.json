      "content": "Paper Title: Comparative evaluation of CNN architectures for Image Caption Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSome of the earliest works attempted to solve the problem of caption generation in constrained environments such as the work proposed in  where the authors try to generate captions for objects present in an office setting. Such methods had limited scalability and applications. Some works tried to address the task as a Retrieval problem where a pool of sentences was constructed which could describe all (or most) images in a particular setting. Then for a target image, a sentence which was deemed appropriate by the algorithm was selected as the caption. For example, in , the authors construct a ’meaning space’ which consists of triplets of <<objects, actions, scene>>. This is used as a common mapping space for images and sentences. A similarity measure is used to find sentences with the highest similarity to the target image and the most similar sentence is selected as the caption. In , a set of images are retrieved from the training data which are similar to the target image using a visual similarity measure. Then a word probability density conditioned on the target image is calculated using the captions of the images that were retrieved in the last step. Then the captions in the dataset are scored using this word probability density and the sentence which has the highest score is selected as the caption for the target image. The retrieval based methods generally produce grammatically correct and fluent captions because they select human generated sentence for a target image. However, this approach is not scalable because a large number of sentences need to be included in the pool for each kind of environment. Also the selected sentence may not even be relevant because the same kind of objects may have different kind of relationships among them which cannot be described by a fixed set of sentences. Another class of approaches are the Template based methods which construct a set of hand-coded sentence templates according to the rules of grammar and semantics and optimization algorithms. Then the methods plug in different object components and their relationships into the templates to generate sentences for the target image. For example, in , Conditional Random Fields are used to recognize image contents. A graph is constructed with the image objects, their relationships and attributes as nodes of the graph. The reference captions available with the training images are used to calculate pairwise relationship functions using statistical inference and the visual concepts are used to determine the unary operators on the nodes. In , visual models are used to extract information about objects, attributes and spatial relationships. The visual information is encoded in the form of [<<adjective1,object1>>,preposition,<<adjective2,object2>>] triplets. Then n-gram frequency counts are extracted from web-scale training dataset using statistical inference. Dynamic programming is used to determine optimal combination of phrases to perform phrase fusion to construct the sentences. Although the Template based approaches are able to generate more varied captions, they are still handicapped by the problems of scalability because a large number of sentence templates are to be hand-coded and even then a lot of phrase combinations may be left out. In recent years, most of the works proposed in the literature have employed Deep Learning to generate captions. Most works use CNNs, which are pre-trained on the ImageNet Object Recognition dataset , to extract vectorized representation of the image. Words of a sentence are represented as Word Embedding vectors extracted from a look-up table. The look up table is learned during training as the set of weights of the Embedding Layer. The image and word information is combined in different ways. Most methods use different variants of Recurrent Neural Network  (RNN) to model the temporal relationships between words in the sentence. In [ref]5, the image features extracted from CNN and the word embeddings are mapped to the same vector space and merged using element-wise addition at each time-step. Then the merged image features and word embeddings are used as input to a MultiModal Reccurent Neural Network (m-RNN) which generates the output. The authors use AlexNet and VGG-16 4 as CNNs to extract image features. In [ref]4 a Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network is used as decoder because it can map the word relationships with both the words that precede and the words that succeed a particular word in the sentence. The word embeddings and image features are merged before being fed into the decoder. The authors use AlexNet  CNN to extract image features. In , a Long Short Term Memory Network  is used as decoder. The image features are mapped to the vector space spanned by hidden state representations of the LSTM and are used as initial hidden state of the LSTM. Thus the image information is fed to LSTM at initial state only. The LSTM takes in previously generated words as input (with a special ’start token’ as the first input) and generates the next word sequentially. The authors use  as CNN for extracting image features. Using the Attention approach, in  the authors train the model to focus on certain parts of the image at certain time-steps. This attention mechanism takes as input, the image features and output until the last time-step and generates an image representation conditioned on text input. This is merged with the word embeddings at the current time-step by using vector concatenation operation and used as input to the LSTM generator. The authors used VGGNet 4 CNN as image feature extractor. Recently, methods using Convolutional Neural Networks as sequence generators have been proposed such as in [ref]25 for text generation. Based on this approach,  propose a method which uses a CNN for encoding the image and another CNN for decoding the image. The CNN decoder is similar to the one used in [ref]25 and uses a hierarchy of layers to model word relationships of increasing complexity. The authors use ResNet1523 CNN to encode the image features. More recently, Transformer Network has been used which uses self-attention to model word relationships instead of Recurrent or Convolutional operations . Based on this approach a Transformer based caption generation is proposed in . Since most of the methods use different CNN architectures to extract image features, there is a need for a comparative analysis of their effectiveness in image feature extraction using the same overall format for caption generation.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: image and word information is combined in different ways. Most methods use different variants of Recurrent Neural Network  (RNN) to model the temporal relationships between words in the sentence. In [ref]5, the image features extracted from CNN and the word embeddings are mapped to the same vector space and merged using element-wise addition at each time-step. Then the merged image features and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
