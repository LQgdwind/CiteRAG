      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-Agent Chance-Constrained Stochastic Shortest Path with Application to Risk-Aware Intelligent Intersection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe intersection system unders tudy considers a risk-aware architecture [ref]30 for both AVs and HVs, with the former following a centralized controller and HVs adhering to traffic signals. We adopt the protocol specified in  for AVs, where each vehicle declares a target destination to the coordinator via V2I communication. The coordinator is a computing unit installed on a road side unit equipped with communication and sensing modalities. Given vehicles’ target destinations, the coordinator optimizes the intersection’s overall performance and transmits a trajectory specification to each vehicle. The coordinator also predicts the intention of HVs and incorporates the uncertainty in the AV plans. Overall, the proposed system comprises six modules, as depicted in Fig. 2, which are elaborated in the paragraphs to follow. Probabilistic Perception:\nPerception uncertainty can be specified as a distribution in which the object is located. One way to obtain a distribution over the object’s shape and location is through point clouds. The points are segmented according to the face-plane of the obstacle they belong to; points belonging to the same face can be used to perform a Bayesian linear regression on the plane’s parameters. Given a Gaussian prior on the face-plane parameters and under reasonable assumptions about the underlying noise-generation process, the posterior on the face-plane parameters will also be Gaussian . A recent work in  presents a fast algorithm that generates a probabilistic occupancy model for dynamic obstacles in the scene with few sparse LIDAR measurements. Typically, the occupancy states exhibit highly nonlinear patterns that cannot be captured with a simple linear classification model. Therefore, deep learning models and kernel-based models can be considered as potential candidates.\nThis module obtains a two-dimensional top-down representation of all vehicles in the scene along with uncertainty in their locations. For AVs, accurate location and pose (along with Gaussian uncertainty in location, which could be estimated via Kalman filter) can be transmitted through V2I . Moreover, infrastructure sensors, such as cameras, can obtain HVs poses and validate AV pose estimations via segmentation methods . Motion Model Generator: The system continuously elicits trajectory traversal data of both AVs and HVs to learn probabilistic motion models in an online (real-time) fashion. These models are helpful in two ways: (i) for AVs, the learned motion models capture the uncertainty in the control system (ii) for HVs, the learned motion models represent how humans drive according to different driving patterns associated with tracking uncertainties.\nTo encode uncertainty in trajectory traversal, we leverage a probabilistic representation, called Probabilistic Flow Tube (PFT) , that encodes a nominal trajectory and uncertainties for a given driving pattern.\nThe PFT is learned from a set of demonstrating trajectories, where each trajectory is composed of a sequence of positions. The output is a Gaussian process, a sequence of means and covariances that represents a nominal trajectory and uncertainties in traversals. We refer to  for further details on PFTs. The generation of the initial trajectory for AVs is described in Sec. VI. Existing works   assume the demonstrating trajectories are pre-labeled with maneuver types and learn a PFT for each maneuver type, which entails extra labeling effort and confines to a fixed taxonomy of maneuvers. Instead, we leverage an unsupervised clustering algorithm to create distinct clusters  given demonstrating trajectories representing different driving patterns and learn a distinct PFT for each cluster. As we continuously acquire more trajectories from the perception system, we update the clusters when the variance of a PFT is excessively high. We visualize an example of PFT and its demonstrating trajectories in Figs. 1(c) and 1(b), respectively. Since the demonstrating trajectories are collected with different sizes, we use dynamic time warping (DTW) [ref]36 to ensure equally sized trajectories prior to applying the PFT generator.\nThen, PFTs are computed by sampling multiple trajectories, each obtained by following a nominal trajectory using a PID controller with slightly perturbed parameters to emulate manufacturer-specific controller deviations. HV Management:\nConsidering that the intersection system lacks communication means with HVs, we assume HVs follow traffic signals and the employed intent recognition module predicts the trajectory of HVs to generate safe plans for AVs. For instance, if the traffic light is green on a given road, only HVs from that road may enter the intersection immediately. In contrast, AVs from any road may enter the intersection upon the system’s command. Intent Recognizer: This module predicts human driver’s intention as a distribution over a discrete set of candidate PFTs, thereby allowing AVs to maintain contingency plans for all potential scenarios. This is a departure from current approaches in the literature, where an AV is often provided with a single trajectory, whereas we provide a response trajectory for each potential scenario. Contingency planning enables fast response to risky scenarios. The set of candidate PFTs are elected based on road policies that determine the set of legal maneuvers, each with its corresponding PFT.\nIntent recognition, in its own field, has been extensively studied and there are more sophisticated learning-based methods, such as [ref]37 , that can produce accurate motion predictions conditioned on more detailed priors. Given the tracked trajectory points of HVs, the module predicts the set of PFTs that the human driver is likely to follow through Bayesian filtering.\nFirst, we supplement the tracked vehicle trajectory with more data points based on polynomial fit, then extend it into future horizons based on the polynomial coefficients to obtain an augmented trajectory. The augmentation allows us to provide sufficient data in case of short observation tracks.\nSecond, we compute the observation probability of the augmented trajectory conditioned on each candidate PFT. The observation probability is multiplied by a prior distribution over PFT probabilities to obtain a posterior distribution of a candidate PFT the driver intends to follow.\nThe result is a distribution over a set of candidate PFTs, which allows us to leverage a risk-aware planner for each contingency, as explained in the following sections.\n Given a prior of all possible PFTs, the module computes the likelihood of the tracked trajectory against each PFT and updates the posterior distribution over discrete PFT choices. The future trajectory points are then predicted given the nominal trajectory and uncertainties associated with each PFT. Risk-Aware Planner:\nThe planner takes as input the perception data, including observed AV states, PFT motion models learned for AVs, intentions of HVs, and outputs contingency plans for each AV in the scene. In Sec. V, we formulate the intersection problem as an MCC-SSP and devise an exact ILP-based solution approach. Risk Estimator:\nThe online nature of the system and the high number of queries from the planner call for a computationally lightweight risk calculation method. Since PFTs are multi-dimensional Gaussian processes, collision at a given time amounts to solving multi-variate integrations. A straightforward alternative to the exact risk computation method is a high-resolution Monte Carlo sampling. Moreover, in Sec. V-H we show how to compute the risk offline for most cases.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: The intersection system unders tudy considers a risk-aware architecture [ref]30 for both AVs and HVs, with the former following a centralized controller and HVs adhering to traffic signals.
