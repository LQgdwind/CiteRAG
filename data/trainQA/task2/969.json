      "content": "Paper Title: Refining Semantic Segmentation with Superpixels using Transparent Initialization and Sparse Encoder\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSemantic segmentation is an essential task in computer\nvision which requires mapping image pixels of interesting objects to predefined semantic labels.\nApplications include autonomous driving\n, object identification  ,\nimage editing , and scene\nanalysis .\nRecent developments of semantic segmentation are greatly promoted by deep\nlearning on several large-scale datasets  , resulting in effective networks    [ref]8    .\nSemantic segmentation obtained by these methods, however, is not substantially\naligned with object edges. This problem can be alleviated by using qualified edge-preserving\nmethods [ref]28  [ref]8\nor independently learning edges for semantic segmentation\n  .\nNevertheless, those edges are usually incomplete and oversegmented.\nTo solve this problem, denseCRF [ref]28 based methods\naggregate object features over a large and dense range using bilateral\nfilters with high-dimensional lattice computations.\nThis, however, could be more efficient and desirable to learn on locally oversegmented\nareas, such as superpixels that aggregate similar pixels into a higher-order\nclique  . Existing superpixel segmentation approaches are mainly categorized into\ntraditional methods, such as SLIC , LSC ,\nCrisp , BASS , and those\nusing neural networks, such as SSN ,\naffinity loss , and superpixels by FCN [ref]52.\nAlthough those traditional methods have qualified performance on superpixel\nsegmentation, they cannot be easily embedded into neural networks for\nend-to-end learning due to nondifferentiability or large\ncomputational complexity.\nIn contrast,  provides an end-to-end learning for\nsuperpixel semantic segmentation, but the pixel labels in each superpixel are not always consistent.\nSimilarly, [ref]52 uses a fully convolutional network to learn\nsuperpixels for stereo matching, which is the\ncurrent state-of-the-art in superpixel learning.\nHowever, the problem of inconsistent pixel labels in each superpixel will also occur when [ref]52 is applied\nto semantic segmentation. To deal with the problems of edge loss and inconsistent superpixel labelling,\nwe jointly train\nthese networks with additional fully-connected\nlayers using transparent initialization and logit consistency,\nresulting in enhanced object edges in Fig.Â 1.\nSpecifically, transparent initialization warm starts the training\nby recovering the pretrained network output from its input at initialization, followed by a\ngradual improvement in learning superpixels.\nSimultaneously, logit consistency with sparse encoder enables\nefficient logit averaging to guarantee consistent pixel labels in each superpixel.\nFurthermore, we used the popular performance ratio  and F-measure  5 to evaluate\nthe quality of semantic segmentation edges.\nOur code will be available upon publication.\nThe main contributions of this work are: We jointly learn the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation network and\nsuperpixel network to enhance the labelling performance with\nsharp object edges.\nThe improvement is vivid as demonstrated by evaluating on PASCAL VOC 2012,\nADE20K and PASCAL Context. Transparent initialization is proposed for learning fused features\nwhile adding fully-connected layers to pretrained networks.\nThis helps to join and fine-tune state-of-the-art networks without interrupting\nthe effect of pretrained network parameters.\nThe transparent initialization may also be adapted to fine-tune\nmultiple and deeper pretrained networks for other tasks. Logit consistency, implemented by a sparse encoder with sparse matrix\noperations, ensures consistent semantics for all\npixels in each superpixel.\nThis makes it feasible and efficient to index pixels\nby superpixels, because of greatly reduced computational complexity.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: ,\nimage editing , and scene\nanalysis .\nRecent developments of semantic segmentation are greatly promoted by deep\nlearning on several large-scale datasets  , resulting in effective networks    [ref]8    .\nSemantic segmentation obtained by these methods, however, is not substantially\naligned with object edges.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
