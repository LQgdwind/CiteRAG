      "content": "Paper Title: PALMER: Perception-Action Loop with Memory for Long-Horizon Planning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhat is the main reason why memory-based reasoning over actually-observed transitions is necessary? Why are methods like SPTM or SoRB that solely rely on learning-based distance estimates are inherently prone to false predictions:  By definition, states that are far apart from each other in-terms of physical reachability are rarely observed together in an experiential learning framework (e.g., within the same RL episode, or within close by time-steps during random exploration). Therefore, for any learning-based prediction model that is conditioned on current-goal state pairs (e.g., Q​(st,a,sg),πi​n​v​(a′|st,sg),pt​(T′|st,sg)𝑄subscript𝑠𝑡𝑎subscript𝑠𝑔subscript𝜋𝑖𝑛𝑣conditionalsuperscript𝑎′subscript𝑠𝑡subscript𝑠𝑔subscript𝑝𝑡conditionalsuperscript𝑇′subscript𝑠𝑡subscript𝑠𝑔Q(s_{t},a,s_{g}),\\ \\pi_{inv}(a^{\\prime}|s_{t},s_{g}),\\ p_{t}(T^{\\prime}|s_{t},s_{g})), if it is trained solely on the observed distribution of experiential data, far apart states will be out of distribution (i.e., they have a low probability of being sampled from the experiential data distribution, therefore they are underrepresented in the replay buffer). This means that predictions for such far apart states will inevitably be inaccurate, unless a hard-negative sampling mechanism is implemented to explicitly push their reachability-estimates lower. The problem with this is that there is no inherent signal solely contained in perceptual input (e.g., images) that can guide the resampling process in a way that is generally applicable to all tasks. For example, [ref]53 employs a hard-negative sampling mechanism for a manipulation task using joint pose labels for guidance, but such a mechanism has two bottlenecks: i) it is specific to their particular manipulation task, ii) it assumes auxiliary labels. Similarly, the temporally consistent localization mechanism used in SPTM is essentially a heuristic fix specific to navigation. For the case of SoRB, there is no inherent mechanism in distributional RL that addresses this out-of-distribution issue either. While employing an ensemble of Q-functions could potentially capture the epistemic uncertainty for out-of-distribution pairs to directly address this problem, we used an ensemble of Q-functions in our implementation of SoRB and empirically observed that it was insufficient. A similar conclusion can be drawn from the Fig.8 of the original SoRB paper [ref]12, as the bulk of the performance increase appears to be due to distributional RL, and ensembles only provide a moderate benefit. All of these considerations highlight the importance of memory as a robustification mechanism. To summarize the discussions from above, there are two main reasons that cause false reachability predictions: i) there is no robust and general signal solely contained in the isolated instances of perceptual input (sc,sg)subscript𝑠𝑐subscript𝑠𝑔(s_{c},s_{g}) (i.e., without the trajectory of states in between that connect them) that can identify whether two states are physically far apart, ii) both physically close and far apart states can occur with a long temporal distance in between. Therefore, an agent needs to rely on memory: in order to identify whether two states are close or not, it should try to remember if it ever actually observed those two states close-by in a segment of past experience. What are the details for our implementations of SoRB and SPTM: Tha main difference of our SPTM implementation is that it doesn’t employ temporally consistent localization and adaptive waypoint selection. The main differences of our SoRB implementation are: i) we use an ensemble of Q-functions, but they are trained with DDQN rather than distributional RL, ii) we train the Q-function on offlline random-walk data, rather than an online episodic training setup with resets and a reward oracle as employed in the original paper. We acknowledge and emphasize that for SoRB, these differences are the most likely reason for the lower performance level we observed in our evaluations compared to the original paper, as they inevitably reduce the accuracy of Q-values. We however note that our method also employs the same Q-values, and generally these implementation differences in the baselines were chosen to facilitate a clear understanding of our approach without confounders, because: i) they do not directly address the root cause of the false prediction problem (as discussed above), ii) one of the main benefits of our method is that it operates over arbitrary offline data without any resets or reward oracles (and it uses DDQN to train the related Q-function).\n\nReference markers found: [53]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]53: this is that there is no inherent signal solely contained in perceptual input (e.g., images) that can guide the resampling process in a way that is generally applicable to all tasks.
