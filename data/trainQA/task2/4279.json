      "content": "Paper Title: Target-absent Human Attention\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe attention mechanism used by humans to prioritize and select visual information    has attracted the interest of computer vision researchers seeking to reproduce this selection efficiency in machines     [ref]38. The most often-used paradigm to study this efficiency is a visual search task, where efficiency is measured with respect to how many attention shifts (gaze fixations) are needed to detect a target in an image. But what about when the target is not there? Understanding gaze behavior during target-absent search (including search termination) would serve applications in human-computer interaction while addressing basic questions in attention research. No predictive model of human search fixations would be complete without addressing the unique problems arising from target-absent search. The neuroanatomy of the primate foveated retina is such that visual acuity decreases with increasing distance from the high-resolution central fovea.\nWhen searching for a target, this foveated retina drives people to move their eyes selectively to image locations most likely to be the target, thereby providing the highest-resolution visual input to the target-recognition task, with each fixation movement guided by low-resolution input from peripheral vision.\nRecognizing the fact that the human visual input is filtered through a foveated retina is crucial to understanding and predicting human gaze behavior, and this is especially true for target-absent search where there is no clear target signal and gaze is driven instead by contextual relationships to other objects and the spatial cues that might provide about the target’s location.  To simulate a foveated retina for predicting human search fixations, Zelinsky et al.  directly applied a pretrained ResNet [ref]16 to foveated images  to extract feature maps for the state representation. Yang et al.  proposed DCBs that approximate a high-resolution fovea and a low-resolution periphery by using the segmentation maps of a full-resolution image and its blurred version, respectively, predicted by a pretrained Panoptic-FPN .\nLike other models for predicting human attention   [ref]26  , these approaches rely on pretrained networks to extract image features and train much smaller networks for the downstream tasks using transfer learning, usually due to the lack of human fixation data for training. Also noteworthy is that these approaches apply networks pretrained on full-resolution images (e.g., ResNets [ref]16 trained on ImageNet ) on blurred images,\nexpecting the pretrained networks to approximate how humans perceive blurred images.\nHowever, Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) are highly vulnerable to image perturbation   and the visual features extracted from the model on blurred images are hardly meaningful in the context of object recognition (contrary to human vision that actively seeks guidance from low-resolution peripheral vision for target recognition). To better represent the degraded information that humans have available from their peripheral vision and can therefore use to guide their search, we exploit the fact that modern ConvNets have an inherent hierarchical architecture such that deeper layers have progressively larger receptive fields, corresponding to the greater blurring that occurs with increasing visual eccentricity. We propose combining the feature maps at different layers in a manner that is contingent upon the human fixation locations, approximating the information available from a foveated retina111Note that it is not our aim to perfectly approximate the information extracted by a human foveated retina.. We name this method Foveated Feature Maps (FFMs). FFMs are computed on full-resolution images, so they can be readily applied to a wide range of pretrained ConvNets. Moreover, FFMs are a lightweight modification of modern ConvNets that capable of representing the subtle transition from fovea to periphery and are thus better suited for predicting human gaze movement. We find that our FFMs, when combined with inverse reinforcement learner (IQ-Learn ), significantly outperforms DCBs  and other baselines (see Sec. 4.3) in predicting both target-absent and target-present fixations. In short, our paper makes the following contributions: (1)\nwe introduce a data-driven computational model applicable to both the target-present and target-absent search prediction problems;\n(2) we propose a new state representation that dynamically integrates knowledge collected via a foveated retina, similar to humans; (3) we predict target-absent search fixations at the ceiling of human performance, and achieve superior performance in predicting target-present scanpaths compared to previous methods; and (4) We propose a novel evaluation metric called semantic sequence score that measures the object-level consistency between human scanpaths. Compared to the traditional sequence score , it better captures the contextual cues that people use to guide their target-absent search behavior.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: mechanism used by humans to prioritize and select visual information    has attracted the interest of computer vision researchers seeking to reproduce this selection efficiency in machines     [ref]38.
