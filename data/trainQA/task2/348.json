      "content": "Paper Title: Bridge-Depth Characterizes which Minor-Closed Structural Parameterizations of Vertex Cover Admit a Polynomial Kernel\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor each integer c∈ℕ𝑐ℕc\\in\\mathbb{N}, we will obtain a kernel for the following parameterized problem. \n\n\n\n\nIndependent Set with c𝑐c-bridge-depth modulator (IS/c𝑐c-bd-mod)\nParameter: |X|𝑋|X|.\n\n\nInput: Undirected graph G𝐺G, integer k𝑘k, and a set X⊆V​(G)𝑋𝑉𝐺X\\subseteq V(G) such that 𝖻𝖽​(G∖X)≤c𝖻𝖽𝐺𝑋𝑐{\\sf bd}(G\\setminus X)\\leq c.\nQuestion: Does G𝐺G have an independent set of size k𝑘k?\n\n Note that, for structural graph parameterizations that do not refer to the solution size, the IS and VC problems are equivalent: an instance (G,X,k)𝐺𝑋𝑘(G,X,k) of IS with a structural parameter |X|𝑋|X| is equivalent to the similarly-parameterized instance (G,X,|V​(G)|−k)𝐺𝑋𝑉𝐺𝑘(G,X,|V(G)|-k) of VC, and this reduction preserves the parameter. Similarly as in previous work [ref]22 , we therefore present the kernelization algorithm for IS, since it makes some arguments more intuitive. We may assume that a modulator X𝑋X is given in the input, since one may use the polynomial-time approximation algorithm given by Proposition 3.6 to obtain a modulator that can be used to compute the kernel. This is a standard assumption also used in related work; see [13, §2.2] for a detailed discussion. Given an input (G,X,k)𝐺𝑋𝑘(G,X,k) of IS/c𝑐c-bd-mod, we henceforth denote by R:=V​(G)∖Xassign𝑅𝑉𝐺𝑋R:=V(G)\\setminus X the remaining bounded-bridge-depth graph that results from removing the modulator. The kernelization algorithm is defined in Algorithm 1; throughout this section we present a series of definitions and results that will eventually lead to a proof that this algorithm indeed computes a polynomial kernel for IS/c𝑐c-bd-mod. Let us first explain the roadmap of the proof, keeping in mind the outline given in the beginning of this section.\nSection 6.2 corresponds to the easy part of the kernel, as we invoke the classical machinery to bound the number of connected components of R𝑅R by a polynomial in the parameter |X|𝑋|X|. We employ the notions of conflict and chunk that were introduced in [ref]22 for analyzing how a choice of an independent set from the modulator X𝑋X affects the number of additional vertices from R𝑅R that can be added to the independent set. The fact that having bounded minimal blocking set size (in R𝑅R) allows for an efficient reduction of the number of connected components of R𝑅R (cf. Lemma 6.10) is implicit in previous work [22, §3.1] [4, Rule 3]; see [19, Thm. 3] for an explicit argument. We use the same kind of arguments in our Rules 1 and 2. While some earlier work  uses an annotated version of the problem, in this work we introduce the notion of almost-free set (cf. Definition 6.2) to avoid having annotations. This allows us to work in a conceptually cleaner setting. Let us now turn to Section 6.3. When working with a modulator to bounded tree-depth , once the number of connected components of R𝑅R is bounded by a polynomial in |X|𝑋|X|, we can move a tree-depth decreasing vertex from each connected component into the modulator, and get a (c−1)𝑐1(c-1)-tree-depth-modulator X′superscript𝑋′X^{\\prime}, with |X′|superscript𝑋′|X^{\\prime}| being still polynomial in |X|𝑋|X|. This facilitates a recursion on c𝑐c presented in Section 6.4, immediately leading to a polynomial kernel. In our case, we cannot move an entire lowering tree (cf. Definition 3.7) of a connected component of R𝑅R into the modulator, as its size may be unbounded.\nThus, the main challenge to obtain the polynomial kernel is addressed in Section 6.3, where we define new rules to shrink the size of lowering trees. Notice that shrinking these lowering trees generalizes the reduction rules for Independent Set parameterized by distance to a forest [ref]22, since for any component in R𝑅R that is a tree, its unique lowering tree consists of the entire component. This explains why we cannot simply use the kernelization for the parameterization by feedback vertex set [ref]22 as a black box, as it was the case in previous work  7 8  . Let us now formally define the above notions. For a graph G𝐺G and disjoint vertex sets X′,R′⊆V​(G)superscript𝑋′superscript𝑅′𝑉𝐺X^{\\prime},R^{\\prime}\\subseteq V(G), we define the number of conflicts induced on R′superscript𝑅′R^{\\prime} by X′superscript𝑋′X^{\\prime} as When G𝐺G is clear from the context, 𝖼𝗈𝗇𝖿R′G​(X′)subscriptsuperscript𝖼𝗈𝗇𝖿𝐺superscript𝑅′superscript𝑋′{\\sf conf}^{G}_{R^{\\prime}}(X^{\\prime}) will be simply denoted by 𝖼𝗈𝗇𝖿R′​(X′)subscript𝖼𝗈𝗇𝖿superscript𝑅′superscript𝑋′{\\sf conf}_{R^{\\prime}}(X^{\\prime}). Intuitively, 𝖼𝗈𝗇𝖿R′​(X′)subscript𝖼𝗈𝗇𝖿superscript𝑅′superscript𝑋′{\\sf conf}_{R^{\\prime}}(X^{\\prime}) measures how much smaller the independence number of G​[R′]𝐺delimited-[]superscript𝑅′G[R^{\\prime}] becomes when one is forbidden from picking vertices that are adjacent in G𝐺G to X′superscript𝑋′X^{\\prime}. This allows us to reason about which subsets X′superscript𝑋′X^{\\prime} are viable candidates for occurring in a maximum independent set of G𝐺G. Let (G,X,k)𝐺𝑋𝑘(G,X,k) be an input of IS/c𝑐c-bd-mod and R:=G∖Xassign𝑅𝐺𝑋R:=G\\setminus X. A chunk is an independent set X′⊆Xsuperscript𝑋′𝑋X^{\\prime}\\subseteq X of size at most 2csuperscript2𝑐2^{c} in G𝐺G.\nWe denote by 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} the set of all chunks. The degree of a chunk X′superscript𝑋′X^{\\prime}, denoted d​(X′)𝑑superscript𝑋′d(X^{\\prime}), is defined as the number of connected components R′superscript𝑅′R^{\\prime} of R𝑅R for which 𝖼𝗈𝗇𝖿R′​(X′)≠0subscript𝖼𝗈𝗇𝖿superscript𝑅′superscript𝑋′0{\\sf conf}_{R^{\\prime}}(X^{\\prime})\\neq 0. A set Z⊆V​(R)𝑍𝑉𝑅Z\\subseteq V(R) is free if 𝖼𝗈𝗇𝖿Z​(X′)=0subscript𝖼𝗈𝗇𝖿𝑍superscript𝑋′0{\\sf conf}_{Z}(X^{\\prime})=0 for all X′∈𝒳superscript𝑋′𝒳X^{\\prime}\\in\\mathcal{X}. A set Z⊆V​(R)𝑍𝑉𝑅Z\\subseteq V(R) is x𝑥x-almost-free for x∈ℕ𝑥ℕx\\in\\mathbb{N}, if for any X′∈𝒳superscript𝑋′𝒳X^{\\prime}\\in\\mathcal{X} such that 𝖼𝗈𝗇𝖿Z​(X′)≠0subscript𝖼𝗈𝗇𝖿𝑍superscript𝑋′0{\\sf conf}_{Z}(X^{\\prime})\\neq 0, it holds that 𝖼𝗈𝗇𝖿R​(X′)≥xsubscript𝖼𝗈𝗇𝖿𝑅superscript𝑋′𝑥{\\sf conf}_{R}(X^{\\prime})\\geq x. Slight abusing notation, for a subgraph R′superscript𝑅′R^{\\prime} of R𝑅R we will sometimes write 𝖼𝗈𝗇𝖿R′​(X′)subscript𝖼𝗈𝗇𝖿superscript𝑅′superscript𝑋′{\\sf conf}_{R^{\\prime}}(X^{\\prime}) as a shorthand for 𝖼𝗈𝗇𝖿V​(R′)​(X′)subscript𝖼𝗈𝗇𝖿𝑉superscript𝑅′superscript𝑋′{\\sf conf}_{V(R^{\\prime})}(X^{\\prime}). Note the subtle difference in the subscripts of 𝖼𝗈𝗇𝖿𝖼𝗈𝗇𝖿{\\sf conf} for the definition of almost-free. Intuitively, if Z𝑍Z is x𝑥x-almost-free, then any chunk that makes a conflict on the subgraph induced by Z𝑍Z, will make at least x𝑥x conflicts on the entire bounded bridge-depth graph R𝑅R. For x≥|X|𝑥𝑋x\\geq|X|, this will allow us to infer that there is a maximum independent set of G𝐺G that does not contain any chunk that makes a conflict on Z𝑍Z. Let (G,X,k)𝐺𝑋𝑘(G,X,k) be an instance of IS/c𝑐c-bd-mod. There is a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the function 𝖼𝗈𝗇𝖿𝖼𝗈𝗇𝖿{\\sf conf} for any R′⊆V​(R)superscript𝑅′𝑉𝑅R^{\\prime}\\subseteq V(R), to compute the degree d𝑑d of a chunk, and to decide if a subset Z⊆V​(R)𝑍𝑉𝑅Z\\subseteq V(R) is free or x𝑥x-almost free. For any R′⊆V​(R)superscript𝑅′𝑉𝑅R^{\\prime}\\subseteq V(R) we have 𝗍𝗐​(G​[R′])≤𝖻𝖽​(G​[R′])≤c𝗍𝗐𝐺delimited-[]superscript𝑅′𝖻𝖽𝐺delimited-[]superscript𝑅′𝑐{\\sf tw}(G[R^{\\prime}])\\leq{\\sf bd}(G[R^{\\prime}])\\leq c, by Item 6 of Proposition 3.2. Since IS is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by treewidth (cf. [7, §7.3.1]), and a tree decomposition of constant width c𝑐c can be computed in linear time , this means independence numbers of subgraphs of G∖X𝐺𝑋G\\setminus X can be computed in polynomial time. Since the number of potential chunks is polynomial in |X|𝑋|X| since c𝑐c is a constant, this allows all mentioned quantities to be efficiently computed. The following lemma shows why having small blocking sets is useful to characterize the interaction between maximum independent sets in R𝑅R and chunks. Let (G,X,k)𝐺𝑋𝑘(G,X,k) be an instance of IS/c𝑐c-bd-mod and let R′⊆V​(R)superscript𝑅′𝑉𝑅R^{\\prime}\\subseteq V(R).\nFor every independent set SX⊆Xsubscript𝑆𝑋𝑋S_{X}\\subseteq X such that 𝖼𝗈𝗇𝖿R′​(SX)≠0subscript𝖼𝗈𝗇𝖿superscript𝑅′subscript𝑆𝑋0{\\sf conf}_{R^{\\prime}}(S_{X})\\neq 0 there exists a chunk X′∈𝒳superscript𝑋′𝒳X^{\\prime}\\in\\mathcal{X}, with X′⊆SXsuperscript𝑋′subscript𝑆𝑋X^{\\prime}\\subseteq S_{X}, such that 𝖼𝗈𝗇𝖿R′​(X′)≠0subscript𝖼𝗈𝗇𝖿superscript𝑅′superscript𝑋′0{\\sf conf}_{R^{\\prime}}(X^{\\prime})\\neq 0. Let Z=NG​(SX)∩R′𝑍subscript𝑁𝐺subscript𝑆𝑋superscript𝑅′Z=N_{G}(S_{X})\\cap R^{\\prime}. The fact that 𝖼𝗈𝗇𝖿R′​(SX)≠0subscript𝖼𝗈𝗇𝖿superscript𝑅′subscript𝑆𝑋0{\\sf conf}_{R^{\\prime}}(S_{X})\\neq 0 implies that Z𝑍Z is a blocking set of G​[R′]𝐺delimited-[]superscript𝑅′G[R^{\\prime}].\nAs 𝖻𝖽​(R′)≤c𝖻𝖽superscript𝑅′𝑐{\\sf bd}(R^{\\prime})\\leq c, which implies that 𝗆𝖻𝗌​(R′)≤2c𝗆𝖻𝗌superscript𝑅′superscript2𝑐{\\sf mbs}(R^{\\prime})\\leq 2^{c} by Theorem 5.5, there exists Z′⊆Zsuperscript𝑍′𝑍Z^{\\prime}\\subseteq Z with |Z′|≤2csuperscript𝑍′superscript2𝑐|Z^{\\prime}|\\leq 2^{c} such that Z′superscript𝑍′Z^{\\prime} is a blocking set of R′superscript𝑅′R^{\\prime}.\nThus, with any z∈Z′𝑧superscript𝑍′z\\in Z^{\\prime} we associate a vertex vz∈SXsubscript𝑣𝑧subscript𝑆𝑋v_{z}\\in S_{X} such that vzsubscript𝑣𝑧v_{z} is adjacent to z𝑧z, and we get that X′:={vz∣z∈Z′}assignsuperscript𝑋′conditional-setsubscript𝑣𝑧𝑧superscript𝑍′X^{\\prime}:=\\{v_{z}\\mid z\\in Z^{\\prime}\\} is the desired chunk. Let (G,X,k)𝐺𝑋𝑘(G,X,k) be an instance of IS/c𝑐c-bd-mod. A set Z⊆V​(R)𝑍𝑉𝑅Z\\subseteq V(R) is free if and only if for any independent set S⊆X𝑆𝑋S\\subseteq X, 𝖼𝗈𝗇𝖿Z​(S)=0subscript𝖼𝗈𝗇𝖿𝑍𝑆0{\\sf conf}_{Z}(S)=0 (or equivalently α​(G​[Z∖NG​(S)])=α​(G​[Z])𝛼𝐺delimited-[]𝑍subscript𝑁𝐺𝑆𝛼𝐺delimited-[]𝑍\\alpha(G[Z\\setminus N_{G}(S)])=\\alpha(G[Z])).
