      "content": "Paper Title: Generation of microbial colonies dataset with deep learning style transfer\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning (DL) has recently achieved outstanding results in several disciplines, including medicine, microbiology, and bioinformatics. DL-based automatic extraction of information from images has led to unprecedented progress in many fields. Neural networks were applied in numerous medical tasks, most extensively in radiology and pathology specialties       [ref]7 . Moreover, their performance is frequently comparable, or even better than in the case of human experts. Furthermore, it is possible that DL algorithms could be used to extract data that would not be apparent in human analysis . The use of neural networks also makes it possible to automate industrial processes such as counting microbial colonies on Petri dishes, which is an important step in the microbiological laboratory to evaluate the cleanliness of the samples. Traditionally, the counting task is done manually or semi-automatically0 1, but recent studies suggest that DL-based methodology will accelerate the process 2 3 4 5 6. To evaluate the number of microbial colonies grown on a Petri dish, neural network models called detectors may be applied 2. The most representative group of detectors are two-stage models. These architectures are characterised by high localization and classification accuracy. The concept is to separately resolve the localization and classification tasks in two stages. During the first stage, regions of interest are generated, and then in the second stage, a bounding box regression is made, and the achieved region proposals are assigned to the appropriate class with some level of confidence 7. The baseline two-stage architecture is Faster R-CNN 8. The Mask R-CNN 9 extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition. However, object instance segmentation needs annotation at a pixel level, which makes the labeling process even more challenging. Estimation of the number of microbial colonies may also be based on density map estimation 4, similarly to the case of human crowd counting 0. In this approach, the annotations for each object are in the form of a density map. Algorithms based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) learn the mapping between the extracted features and their object density maps, to indirectly count objects by integration of the predicted map. In turn, in this type of research UNet 1-based models are used. However, despite the broad possibilities and the recent interest in the topic 2 3 4, the application of DL-based methods in medical, pharmaceutical, or food industries still faces some challenges. DL algorithms are quite efficient when learning from large amounts of data, whose collection and annotations require a lot of time and financial support. Moreover, the labelling process itself can be challenging. In our case, the problem of identifying a separate colony could be hard even for trained professionals, because some microbial colonies tend to agglomerate and overlap, thus becoming indistinguishable. On top of that, the identified colony can be atypical or deformed, and the image itself is influenced by various uncontrolled natural conditions. Object diversity requires well-annotated data whose distribution should match the target industrial use case.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: of information from images has led to unprecedented progress in many fields.
