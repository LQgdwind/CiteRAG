      "content": "Paper Title: Glance to Count: Learning to Rank with Anchors for Weakly-supervised Crowd Counting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFully-supervised Crowd Counting.\nIn recent years, deep learning based method [ref]8, , [ref]9, 0,  have attracted much attention in computer vision for crowd counting. The crowd counting methods mainly include detection-based methods and regression-based methods.\nFor the detection-based methods, Stewart et al. propose to learn person detector relying on bounding box annotations to count.  only requires point supervision to detect the human heads and count them in crowds simultaneously.\nHowever, it is difficult to accurately detect heads or bodies in extremely dense and congested crowd scenes, and that always degrades counting performance. Therefore, the mainstream idea is to train deep CNN networks for density regression. CNN-based regression methods learn a mapping from semantic features to density map and predict the total count. The main issue of regression-based counting task is the huge variation of instance scales. To tackle scale variations, employing multiple receptive fields is effective to learn from people with various sizes. For instance, several works , , 3, 4, 5, 6 employ multi-column networks to obtain local or global contextual features to handle scale variations. , 7, 8 utilize inception blocks to acquire different receptive fields. Several approaches , 9 combine the semantic features with dilated convolution for density estimation. Meanwhile, some works 0, 1, 2, 3 introduce attention mechanism which is effective in extracting foreground features. Considering performance gain from extra supervision, perspective maps 4, 5, 6 and depth maps 7 are delivered to bring more scale guidance. On the other hand, combining with high-level tasks, i.e., localization 8, 9, segmentation 0, depth prediction 1, can provide more accurate location labels for density regression and boost the counting with extra semantic information. However, all the above CNN-based methods require a large number of labels during training, and annotating the crowd counting dataset is a labor-intensive and time-consuming task. Weakly-/Un-/Self-Supervised Crowd Counting.\nThere are some weakly, self or unsupervised counting methods proposed with the considerations of relieving the labeling burden.\nIn the weakly-supervised setting, most methods are regression-based and adopt the image-level count label as the weak supervision signal for training. Idrees et al.1 leverage Fourier Analysis as feature extraction mechanisms to predict total counts. The work in 2 applies Gaussian process as a weakly-supervised solution for crowd counting. For the CNN-based methods,  proposes a soft-label sorting network to strengthen the supervision on crowd numbers beyond the original counting network, and 3 is a semi-supervised method combining a few location-level labels with count-level annotations. 4 focuses on high confident regions while addressing the noisy supervision from unlabeled data as well in a semi-supervised manner. Although the above count-level methods are “weakly-supervised”, the time spent for annotation actually is not remarkably reduced, while just the number of labels is reduced. Besides, Sam et al.5 develop an autoencoder to achieve crowd counting under an almost unsupervised manner, and only few parameters are updated when training. By matching statistics of the distribution of labels, they propose a completely self-supervised training paradigm without using any annotated image in 6. But the performance of unsupervised methods still exists a large gap with fully-supervised works. Besides, it is known that deep CNN-based crowd counting methods usually struggle with the overfitting problem due to existing small datasets and limited variety of them. To ease the overfitting problem, Wang et al.7 explore generating synthetic crowd images to reduce the burden of annotation and alleviate overfitting. Compared with the prior weakly-supervised methods, our proposed training settings based on ranking labels can effectively reduce the labeling burden, while maintaining the state-of-the-art performance. Learning to rank.\nDifferent from the standard machine learning tasks of regression or classification, the ranking tasks are not with precise ground-truth metric targets or class labels as supervision. These works are designed to handle with ordered ranks, i.e., which may be from human preferences, to predict the ordinal rank or relevant metric. There are many learning-to-rank works proposed in the literature. Some of the approaches, such as Ranking SVM 8, RankBoost 9, and RankNet 0, focus on a pair of instances to learn their ranking function by minimizing the loss functions. 1 applies learning-to-rank to large-scale datasets by adapting the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) method. In contrast to the above works for predicting ranks, additional numerical references or other auxiliary supervision is required if we will make a prediction on the number of count.\nLiu et al.2 propose a learning-to-rank self-supervised strategy for utilizing available unlabeled images. And they show the ranking can be used as a proxy task for some regression tasks to solve the problem of limited size in existing datasets. However, relying the ranking of cropped images, which are cropped from the same source image, suffers the influence of similar paired patterns. In this paper, the proposed ranking strategy works on pairwise instances of different images, similar to ranking SVM 8. The setting can be free from the aforementioned problems from the same source pattern. And our method alleviate both overfitting problem and intensive annotation burden. The performance in a weakly-supervised setting is comparable to location-level supervised methods, such that can be feasibly applied in practical applications.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: Fully-supervised Crowd Counting.\nIn recent years, deep learning based method [ref]8, , [ref]9, 0,  have attracted much attention in computer vision for crowd counting.
