Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

Because these ‚Äúsegments‚Äù are created in sentence-level increments there is no token-level control of sequence length.\nFurthermore 10%percent1010\\% (default value,¬†) of sequences are intentionally cut short.\nThis leads to significant levels of padding, especially for longer maximum sequence lengths\n(see Figure¬†1 and Section¬†J[ref]1).\nAt sequence length 128128128 (commonly used in phase 1 of pre-training) the theoretical speed-up is around 1.21.21.2,\nat sequence length 384384384 this increases to 1.71.71.7,\nand finally at sequence length 512512512 (commonly used for phase 2 of pre-training)\nit is 2.02.02.0.\nDespite the widespread use of the Wikipedia dataset for pre-training BERT such histograms have,\nto the best of our knowledge, not been published previously.\nThis has perhaps lead to the underestimation of the speed-up opportunity available.\nTo put things into perspective, the sequence length 512 dataset contains 8.338.338.33 billion tokens, of which 4.174.174.17 billion are padding tokens. Note that the skewed sequence length distributions are neither limited to Wikipedia, as shown with\nGLUE¬†[ref]30 [ref]31 from Section¬†L[ref]1\nand SQuAD 1.1¬† from Section¬†K[ref]1\n(2.2‚Äãx2.2ùë•2.2x speed up), to BERT training,\nas shown with LibiSpeech text distributions¬†\nfrom Section¬†M[ref]1,\nnor to text itself, given the LibriSpeech audio data distributions,\nand the QM9 molecular data¬† \n(1.6‚Äãx1.6ùë•1.6x speed-up, Section¬†Q[ref]1).\nAll distributions can be found in Figure¬†1.\nSince LibriSpeech audio data is skewed to longer sequences,\nonly 1.3‚Äãx1.3ùë•1.3x speed-up could be achieved despite the theoretical maximum of 1.6‚Äãx1.6ùë•1.6x.\nFor all other cases, the algorithms presented in Section¬†3.1 lead\nto close to optimal packing.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: 10%percent1010\\% (default value,¬†) of sequences are intentionally cut short.\nThis leads to significant levels of padding, especially for longer maximum sequence lengths\n(see Figure¬†1 and Section¬†J[ref]1).\nAt sequence length 128128128 (commonly used in phase 1 of pre-training) the theoretical speed-up is around 1.21.21.2,\nat sequence length 384384384 this increases to 1.71.71.7,\nand finally at\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
