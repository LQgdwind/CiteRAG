      "content": "Paper Title: First Order Motion Model for Image Animation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGenerating videos by animating objects in still images has countless applications across areas of interest including movie production, photography, and e-commerce.\nMore precisely, image animation refers to the task of automatically synthesizing videos by combining the appearance extracted from a source image\nwith motion patterns derived from a driving video. For instance, a face image of a certain person can be animated following the facial expressions of another individual (see Fig. 1). In the literature, most methods tackle this problem by\nassuming strong priors on the object representation (e.g. 3D model)  and resorting to computer graphics techniques   . These approaches can be referred to as object-specific methods, as they assume knowledge about the model of the specific object to animate. Recently, deep generative models have emerged as effective techniques for image animation and video retargeting [ref]2 2  3 [ref]28 [ref]29 8 1 2 . In particular, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)  and Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs)  have been used to transfer facial expressions 8 or motion patterns  between human subjects in videos.\nNevertheless, these approaches usually rely on pre-trained models in order to extract object-specific representations such as keypoint locations. Unfortunately, these pre-trained models are built using costly ground-truth data annotations [ref]2 [ref]28 2 and are not available in general for an arbitrary object category. To address this issues, recently\nSiarohin et al. [ref]29 introduced Monkey-Net, the first object-agnostic deep model for image animation. Monkey-Net encodes motion information via keypoints learned in a self-supervised fashion. At test time, the source image is animated according to the corresponding keypoint trajectories estimated in the driving video.\nThe major weakness of Monkey-Net is that it poorly models object appearance transformations in the keypoint neighborhoods assuming a zeroth order model (as we show in Sec. 3.1). This leads to poor generation quality in the case of large object pose changes (see Fig. 4).\nTo tackle this issue, we propose to use a set of self-learned keypoints together with local affine transformations to model complex motions. We therefore call our method a first-order motion model. Second, we introduce an occlusion-aware generator, which adopts an occlusion mask automatically estimated to indicate object parts that are not visible in the source image and that should be inferred from the context. This is especially needed when the driving video contains large motion patterns and occlusions are typical.\nThird, we extend the equivariance loss commonly used for keypoints detector training  5, to improve the estimation of local affine transformations. Fourth, we experimentally show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art image animation methods and can handle high-resolution datasets where other approaches generally fail. Finally, we release a new high resolution dataset, Thai-Chi-HD, which we believe could become a reference benchmark for evaluating frameworks for image animation and video generation.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: methods, as they assume knowledge about the model of the specific object to animate.
