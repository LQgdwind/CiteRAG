      "content": "Paper Title: Benchmarking Shadow Removal for Facial Landmark Detection and Beyond\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe adopt the well-known and widely used physical model of shadow in . Specifically, following the illumination and reflectance formulation of an image , we can represent a clean (i.e., shadow-free) image captured under a single primary light source as\n where 𝐈pclnsuperscriptsubscript𝐈𝑝cln\\mathbf{I}_{p}^{\\text{cln}}, 𝐋psubscript𝐋𝑝\\mathbf{L}_{p}, and 𝐑psubscript𝐑𝑝\\mathbf{R}_{p} are pixel intensity, illumination, and reflectance at the p𝑝p-th pixel, respectively. The illumination stems from two sources, i.e., the direct illumination 𝐋dsuperscript𝐋d\\mathbf{L}^{\\mathrm{d}} and the ambient illumination 𝐋asuperscript𝐋a\\mathbf{L}^{\\mathrm{a}}. When an occluder appears in front of the light source, the direct illumination disappears while the ambient illumination is also affected. We can represent the p𝑝p-th shadowed pixel as\n where α𝛼\\alpha is a scalar and determines the attenuation of the ambient illumination, which is caused by the occluder. With a clean image 𝐈clnsuperscript𝐈cln\\mathbf{I}^{\\text{cln}} and a dark image 𝐈shdsuperscript𝐈shd\\mathbf{I}^{\\text{shd}}, we can represent an image containing a shadow region as\n where 𝐌𝐌\\mathbf{M} is a binary map that defines the shadow region and is determined by the occluder, and 𝐃𝐃\\mathbf{D} is a face depth map.\nNote that, the images of living faces have face-like depth information, which are critical for anti-spoofing application. 𝐃𝐃\\mathbf{D} can make generated shadow more realistic, which are not considered in previous shadow models  .\nMoreover, to generate realistic shadow pattern, we borrow the implementation in   and use function ρ𝜌\\rho to render the depth-aware mask (i.e. 𝐃⊙𝐌direct-product𝐃𝐌\\mathbf{D}\\odot\\mathbf{M}) to become a shadow matte image by modeling the light scattering beneath human skin and modeling the spatial variation of the shadow via a spatially-varying blur. Please find more details in . Then, we can substitute Eq. (2) into Eq. (3) and get\n where β=−𝐋d​𝐑𝛽superscript𝐋d𝐑\\beta=-\\mathbf{L}^{\\mathrm{d}}\\mathbf{R}\nrepresenting the response of the camera to the reflected direct illumination and the ambient attenuation α𝛼\\alpha does not depend on the light source (e.g., wavelength) .\nMoreover, as demonstrated and discussed in , β𝛽\\beta is a three-channel vector and can be estimated from the α𝛼\\alpha via a linear transformation. Overall, given a clean face image 𝐈clnsuperscript𝐈cln\\mathbf{I}^{\\text{cln}}, a shadow map 𝐌𝐌\\mathbf{M}, a depth map 𝐃𝐃\\mathbf{D}, and the α𝛼\\alpha, we can synthesize a shadowed face 𝐈𝐈\\mathbf{I}. In practice, we use the 3DDFA-V2 [ref]11 to predict the depth map from the clean image.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: 𝐈clnsuperscript𝐈cln\\mathbf{I}^{\\text{cln}}, a shadow map 𝐌𝐌\\mathbf{M}, a depth map 𝐃𝐃\\mathbf{D}, and the α𝛼\\alpha, we can synthesize a shadowed face 𝐈𝐈\\mathbf{I}. In practice, we use the 3DDFA-V2 [ref]11 to predict the depth map from the clean image.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
