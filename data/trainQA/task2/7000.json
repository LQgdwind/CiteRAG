      "content": "Paper Title: GraspGF: Learning Score-based Grasping Primitive for Human-assisting Dexterous Grasping\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe significance of human hands in everyday life cannot be overstated. However, there are situations where they may not always be available, especially in scenarios where an individual may have upper limb loss or need to interact with hazardous objects.\nIn such instances, utilising an anthropomorphic dexterous robotic hand for assistance can be a viable option [ref]1. Such a dexterous hand possesses a high degree of freedom, allowing it to handle diverse daily tasks  [ref]3 [ref]4, given that many everyday objects are designed to match the structure of the human hand. This inspired us to propose a novel task called human-assisting dexterous grasping, in which a policy is trained to assist users with upper limb loss in grasping objects by controlling the robotic hand’s fingers, as illustrated in Figure 1a. Traditional teleoperation methods   are unsuitable for assisting upper limb amputees in grasping because no information about the human fingers can be accessed.\nCompared to conventional dexterous grasping, human-assisting dexterous grasping poses a more complex challenge, as the policy must adapt to an exponentially growing number of pre-conditions. As shown in Figure 1b, human users may grasp an object with various intentions, such as grasping different parts for different purposes or moving the hand and wrist at different speeds due to the complexity and diversity of human behaviour. Consequently, the conditional policy must be tailored not only to the object’s geometry, as required by conventional dexterous grasping, but also to the user’s intentions, requiring the policy to be user-aware. In this context, open-looped methods such as grasp pose generation     and classification-based methods    may fall short, as they do not factor in the user’s intention. Reinforcement learning (RL)    presents a natural solution by enabling the training of a closed-loop human-object-conditioned policy. However, in human-assisting dexterous grasping, RL may encounter more severe generalisation issues, due to the need to generalise to diverse grasping pre-conditions. Prior RL-based approaches   have explored leveraging human-collected and engineering-heavy demonstrations to address this issue. However, collecting a large volume of diverse demonstrations that encompass different objects, grasping timings, and locations may not be feasible. To address the challenges associated with achieving dexterous grasping for assisting humans, an effective policy needs to tackle the following two crucial questions:\n\n 1) How should the robot grasp the object considering the current relative pose between the user and the object? 2) When and at what speed should the robot execute the grasping action based on the user movement trajectory history?  In this paper, we present a novel approach that consists of two sub-modules designed to address the aforementioned questions individually:\n1) a hand-object-conditional grasping primitive, and\n2) a history-conditional residual policy.\nThe grasping primitive, which we call Grasping Gradient Field (GraspGF), is trained to learn ‘how to grasp’ by estimating the score function, i.e., the gradient of the log-density, of a success grasping example set.\nThe GraspGF outputs a gradient that indicates the fastest direction to increase the ‘grasping likelihood’ conditioned on an object and the user’s wrist.\nThe gradient can be translated into primitive controls on each finger joint, enabling the fingers to reach an appropriate grasp pose iteratively.\nHowever, GraspGF is not capable of determining how fast the fingers should move along the gradient as it is history-agnostic.\nTo determine ‘when to grasp’, we train a residual policy that outputs a ‘scaling action’ that determines how fast the finger joints should move along with the primitive action, based on the history of the wrist’s trajectory.\nBesides, as the primitive policy is not aware of the environment dynamics due to the offline training, we further require the residual policy to output a ‘residual action’ to correct the primitive action. Our proposed approach offers several conceptual advantages. GraspGF leverages the strong conditional generative modelling of score-based methods, as demonstrated in prior works   0, enabling it to output promising primitive actions conditioned on novel user’s intentions. Additionally, the residual-learning design of GraspGF facilitates cold start exploration and enhances the efficiency of residual policy training. Compared to demonstration-based methods, our approach only requires a synthesised grasping example set and does not rely on exhaustive human labelling or extensive engineering effort, making it more practical for implementation in real-world applications. In our experiments, we evaluate several methods on a dexterous grasping environment that assists humans in grasping over 4900+ on-table objects with up to 200 realistic human wrist movement patterns.\nOur comparative results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the baselines across various metrics. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our proposed grasping gradient field and residual-learning design.\nOur analysis reveals that our method’s superiority lies in its user-awareness, i.e., our trained policy is more tailored to the user’s intentions.\nAdditionally, we conduct real-world experiments to validate the practicality of our approach.\nOur results indicate that our trained model can generalise to the real world to some degree without fine-tuning. Our contributions are summarized as follows:\n We introduce a novel and challenging human-assisting dexterous grasping task, which may potentially help social welfare. We propose a novel two-stage framework that decomposes the task into learning a primitive policy via score-matching and training a residual policy to complement the primitive policy via RL. We conduct experiments to demonstrate our method significantly outperforms the baselines and the effectiveness of our method deployed in the real world.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: where an individual may have upper limb loss or need to interact with hazardous objects.\nIn such instances, utilising an anthropomorphic dexterous robotic hand for assistance can be a viable option [ref]1.
