      "content": "Paper Title: Truncated Matrix Power Iteration for Differentiable DAG Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe consider continuous DAG learning methods\nbased on both Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss (see\nEq. (9)) and likelihood-based (see\nEq. (10)) loss from GOLEM\n. For both losses, we\ninclude the following DAG constraints:\n(1) MSE/Likelihood loss+Exponential DAG constraint\n(3), i.e. NOTEARS\n[ref]50/GOLEM ;\n(2) MSE/Likelihood loss+Binomial DAG constraint (4)\nfrom DAG-GNN [ref]45;\n(3) MSE/Likelihood loss+Spectral radius based DAG constraint from\nNOBEARS ;\n(4) MSE/Likelihood loss+Single Term DAG constraint\n(8);\n(5) MSE/Likelihood loss+Truncated Matrix Power Iteration (TMPI) based\nDAG constraint (7).\nFor the NOCURL method , since it is a two stage methods where the initialization stage rely on MSE\nloss and Binomial DAG constraint, we include it as a baseline, but do\nnot combine it with likelihood loss. The other baselines include GES  and MMHC\n The implementation is provided here.. Gaussian Exponential Gumbel For MSE loss based DAG learning methods\n(9), we set Œ∑=0.1ùúÇ0.1\\eta=0.1 and use the same\nstrategy as Zheng et¬†al. [ref]50 to update the parameters œÅùúå\\rho and\nŒ±ùõº\\alpha. For likelihood loss based DAG learning methods\n(10), we set Œ∑1=0.02subscriptùúÇ10.02\\eta_{1}=0.02 and\nŒ∑2=5.0subscriptùúÇ25.0\\eta_{2}=5.0 as Ng et¬†al. . For the Binomial DAG constraints\n(4), the parameter Œ±ùõº\\alpha is set to 1/d1ùëë1/d as\nYu et¬†al. [ref]45. For our TMPI DAG constraint, we set the parameter œµ=10‚àí6italic-œµsuperscript106\\epsilon=10^{-6}. For the NOCURL method, we use\ntheir public available implementation and default parameter\nsetting444https://github.com/fishmoon1234/DAG-NoCurl/blob/master/main_efficient.py\nfrom commit 4e2a1f4 on 14 Jun 2021. Better performance may be\nattained by tuning the hyper-parameters, but the current best reported\nperformance is slightly worse than NOTEARS in most settings.. For GES and MMPC, we use the implementation and default parameter\nsetting in the CausalDiscoveryToolbox package .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
