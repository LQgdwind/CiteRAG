      "content": "Paper Title: Skill-Critic: Refining Learned Skills for Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo optimize πasubscript𝜋𝑎\\pi_{a} and πzsubscript𝜋𝑧\\pi_{z}, we show the skill framework is a continuous version of a semi-MDP similar to option-critic  [ref]33 [ref]35. However, the semi-MDP formulation uses inter-related value functions that require special algorithms. In contrast, Double-actor-critic 3 casts the semi-MDP as two parallel augmented MDPs, and any policy optimization algorithms can be used to learn each policy. We show this is applicable even for our continuous skills - thus we can use any policy optimization algorithm to optimize πasubscript𝜋𝑎\\pi_{a} and πzsubscript𝜋𝑧\\pi_{z}, including optimization algorithms with non-uniform prior regularization . Semi-MDP with skills. We argue that the MDP endowed with skills is a semi-MDP similar to the one defined in the options framework [ref]35, as skills are continuous, fixed-duration options. The state space 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} consists of the environment states that are augmented with a one-hot encoding of the time index since the beginning of the active skill, kt≐(tmodH)∈𝒦≐{0,1,…​H−1}approaches-limitsubscript𝑘𝑡modulo𝑡𝐻𝒦approaches-limit01…𝐻1k_{t}\\doteq(t\\mod H)\\in\\mathcal{K}\\doteq\\{0,1,...H-1\\}. Following options notation 3, the skill can be defined as a triple (ℐ,πa,β)ℐsubscript𝜋𝑎𝛽(\\mathcal{I},\\pi_{a},\\beta), with initiation set ℐℐ\\mathcal{I}, intra-skill policy πa:𝒮×𝒵→𝒜:subscript𝜋𝑎→𝒮𝒵𝒜\\pi_{a}:\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{Z}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{A}, and termination function β:𝒮→ :𝛽→𝒮01\\beta:\\mathcal{S}\\rightarrow . In our case, we set ℐℐ\\mathcal{I} to the subset of states in 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} where k=0𝑘0k=0, so that skills are only initiated after a fixed horizon H𝐻H since the previous skill was initiated. The termination function is likewise β​(st)≐𝕀kt=0approaches-limit𝛽subscript𝑠𝑡subscript𝕀subscript𝑘𝑡0\\beta(s_{t})\\doteq\\mathbb{I}_{k_{t}=0}, which takes value β​(st)=1𝛽subscript𝑠𝑡1\\beta(s_{t})=1 when kt=0subscript𝑘𝑡0k_{t}=0 and β​(st)=0𝛽subscript𝑠𝑡0\\beta(s_{t})=0 otherwise.\nThe semi-MDP, therefore, consists of the tuple {𝒮,𝒜,𝒵,R,p,p0,γ}𝒮𝒜𝒵𝑅𝑝subscript𝑝0𝛾\\{\\mathcal{S},\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{Z},R,p,p_{0},\\gamma\\}, of states, actions, skills, reward, transition probability, initial state distribution, and\ndiscount factor. The RL objective, 𝔼πa,πz,β​[Σt=0T−1​γt​rt]subscript𝔼subscript𝜋𝑎subscript𝜋𝑧𝛽delimited-[]superscriptsubscriptΣ𝑡0𝑇1superscript𝛾𝑡subscript𝑟𝑡\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi_{a},\\pi_{z},\\beta}[\\Sigma_{t=0}^{T-1}\\gamma^{t}r_{t}], maximizes the expected discounted rewards induced by πasubscript𝜋𝑎\\pi_{a}, πzsubscript𝜋𝑧\\pi_{z}, and β𝛽\\beta. Reformulation as two parallel MDPs.\nWe adapt DAC 3 for continuous, fixed-horizon skills to formulate two parallel augmented MDPs. The HL policy πzsubscript𝜋𝑧\\pi_{z} makes decisions (selects skills) in the high-MDP Mℋsuperscript𝑀ℋM^{\\mathcal{H}}, and the LL policy πasubscript𝜋𝑎\\pi_{a} makes decisions (selects actions) in the low-MDP Mℒsuperscript𝑀ℒM^{\\mathcal{L}}.\nTo account for continuous skills, we define the skill transition and reward function: In Mℋsuperscript𝑀ℋM^{\\mathcal{H}}, a state-skill pair is interpreted as the new state, and the skill is interpreted as the new action: where 𝕀𝕀\\mathbb{I} is the indicator function. It is not necessary to define a dummy skill 3, since we always start with skill selection from policy πz​(zt|st)subscript𝜋𝑧conditionalsubscript𝑧𝑡subscript𝑠𝑡\\pi_{z}(z_{t}|s_{t}) at t=0𝑡0t=0. We define a Markov policy πℋsuperscript𝜋ℋ\\pi^{\\mathcal{H}} on Mℋsuperscript𝑀ℋM^{\\mathcal{H}} as Eqn. (3) shows that the previous skill is used until β​(st)=1𝛽subscript𝑠𝑡1\\beta(s_{t})=1; then a new skill is selected via πzsubscript𝜋𝑧\\pi_{z}. In Mℒsuperscript𝑀ℒM^{\\mathcal{L}}, the state-skill pair is interpreted as the new state, and the action space is unchanged: We define a Markov policy πℒsuperscript𝜋ℒ\\pi^{\\mathcal{L}} on Mℒsuperscript𝑀ℒM^{\\mathcal{L}} as the LL policy πasubscript𝜋𝑎\\pi_{a}: It follows that when we fix πasubscript𝜋𝑎\\pi_{a} and optimize πℋsuperscript𝜋ℋ\\pi^{\\mathcal{H}}, we are optimizing πzsubscript𝜋𝑧\\pi_{z}. Likewise, when we fix πzsubscript𝜋𝑧\\pi_{z} and optimize πℒsuperscript𝜋ℒ\\pi^{\\mathcal{L}}, we are optimizing πasubscript𝜋𝑎\\pi_{a} 3. This implies that any policy optimization algorithm can be used to optimize πℋsuperscript𝜋ℋ\\pi^{\\mathcal{H}} and πℒsuperscript𝜋ℒ\\pi^{\\mathcal{L}}.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: To optimize πasubscript𝜋𝑎\\pi_{a} and πzsubscript𝜋𝑧\\pi_{z}, we show the skill framework is a continuous version of a semi-MDP similar to option-critic  [ref]33 [ref]35.
