      "content": "Paper Title: Beyond the Nav-Graph: Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAside from modeling details, much of the remaining progress in VLN has come from adjusting the training regime ‚Äì adding auxiliary losses / rewards  , mitigating exposure bias during training [ref]4 , or reducing data sparsity by incorporating synthetically generated data augmentation [ref]26 . We explore some of these directions for VLN-CE, but note that this is not an exhaustive accounting of impactful techniques. Particularly, we suspect that methods addressing exposure bias and data sparsity in VLN will help in the VLN-CE setting where these problems may be amplified by lengthy action sequences. We report ablations with and without these techniques in Sec.¬†5. Imitation Learning. A natural starting point for training is simply to maximize the likelihood of the ground truth trajectories. To do so, we perform teacher-forcing training with inflection weighting. As described in [ref]30, inflection weighting places emphasis on time-steps where actions change (i.e. at‚àí1‚â†atsubscriptùëéùë°1subscriptùëéùë°a_{t-1}\\neq a_{t}), adjusting loss weight proportionally to the rarity of such events. This was found to be helpful for problems like navigation with long sequences of repeated actions (e.g. going forward down a hall). We observe a similar effect in early experiments and apply inflection weighting in all our experiments. Coping with Exposure Bias. Imitation learning in auto-regressive settings suffers from a disconnect between training and test ‚Äì agents are not exposed to the consequences of their actions during training. Prior work has shown significant gains by addressing this issue for VLN through scheduled sampling [ref]4 or reinforcement learning fine-tuning  [ref]26. In this work, we apply Dataset Aggregation (DAgger)  towards the same end. While DAgger and scheduled sampling share many similarities, DAgger trains on the aggregated set of trajectories from all iterations 1 to nùëõn. Thus, the resulting policy after iteration nùëõn is optimized over all past experiences and not just those collected from iteration nùëõn. Synthetic Data Augmentation. Another popular strategy is to learn an inverse ‚Äòspeaker‚Äô model that produces instructions given a trajectory. These models can be used to re-rank paths or to generate new trajectory-instruction pairs from any trajectory. Both [ref]26 and  take this data augmentation approach and many follow-up works have used these trajectories for gains in performance. We take the ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim150k synthetic trajectories generated this way from [ref]26 ‚Äì converting them to our continuous environments. Progress Monitor. An important aspect of a successful navigation is accurately identifying where to stop. Prior work  has found improvements from explicitly supervising the agent with a progress-toward-goal signal. Specifically, agents are trained to predict the fraction through the trajectory they are at each time step. We apply this progress estimation during training with a mean squared error loss term akin to .\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Aside from modeling details, much of the remaining progress in VLN has come from adjusting the training regime ‚Äì adding auxiliary losses / rewards  , mitigating exposure bias during training [ref]4 , or reducing data sparsity by incorporating synthetically generated data augmentation [ref]26 .
