      "content": "Paper Title: Perfect Matching in Random Graphs is as Hard as Tseitin\\TCSthanks Supported by the Approximability and Proof Complexity project funded by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere is a rich literature on embeddings of graphs as minors or\ntopological minors into expander graphs. We focus here on the ones\nmost closely related to Theorem 1.2. The classical result of Kleinberg and Rubinfeld [ref]39 shows\nthat a regular expander G𝐺G on n𝑛n vertices contains every\ngraph H𝐻H with O​(n/\\polylog​(n))𝑂𝑛\\polylog𝑛O(n/\\polylog(n)) vertices and edges as a minor.\nKrivelevich and Nenadov  simplified and strengthened this by\nimproving the bound on the\nsize of H𝐻H to O​(n/log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n/\\log n). These results differ from ours in two\nkey ways: (i) we want topological minors, and (ii) we want to be able\nto control the parities of the path lengths in the embedding. We now\ndiscuss these two aspects separately. Results on topological minors, while somewhat less common, also\nexist. A result similar to ours is the result of Broder et\nal.  that with high probability the random graph 𝒢​(n,m)𝒢𝑛𝑚\\mathcal{G}(n,m) on n𝑛n\nvertices and m=Ω​(n​log⁡n)𝑚Ω𝑛𝑛m=\\Omega(n\\log n) edges contains any graph H𝐻H with\nΔ​(H)=O​(m/n)Δ𝐻𝑂𝑚𝑛\\Delta(H)=O(m/n) and at most O​(n/log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n/\\log n) edges (and at most\nn/2𝑛2n/2 vertices) as a topological minor. For our second property, the possibility to choose the\nparities of the paths used in the topological embedding, we are not\naware of any previous work studying this question.\nA related notion are so called odd minors which are more general\nthan topological minors with odd length\npaths. This notion has been considered in connection with a\nstrengthening of Hadwiger’s Conjecture, see e.g., the survey by\nSeymour .\nThis line of research mostly considers complete odd minors, e.g.,\n, and thus is not directly applicable to our situation. Recently Draganić et al.  independently obtained\na new embedding theorem similar to ours.\nThey assume the somewhat stronger property that the\nhost graph G𝐺G is a spectral expander but also obtain a stronger\nconclusion:\neach path of the topological embedding is of equal (odd) length and the\nembedding even works in an adversarial setting.\nNamely, the adversary\nis allowed to fix the embedding of the vertices, as long as no\nneighborhood in G𝐺G contains too many vertex embeddings. The\nembedding theorem of Draganić et al. can be used to implement our\nproof strategy.\nThe results are unaffected by this change except\nin the setting of Theorem 1.3. There, instead of considering\nvertex expanders, we need to consider regular spectral expanders\nwith the benefit that the required average degree d0subscript𝑑0d_{0} is\nconsiderably decreased.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: on embeddings of graphs as minors or\ntopological minors into expander graphs.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
