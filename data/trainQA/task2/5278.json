Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

We also re-implement four baselines with same employment of datasets. The brief introduction of above state-of-the-art models is shown below. MFB  SAN [ref]42\nBAN  models are general VQA frameworks employed in medical domain, residing image-text encoders in separate spaces and then modeling the cross-modal features with a simple fusion model. MAML  utilizes the meta-learning methods to pre-train the vision encoder for a quick adaption to new cross-modal tasks. MAML+SAN and MAML+BAN adopt the Stacked Attention Networks (SAN) and Bilinear Attention Network (BAN) as the fusion module. MEVF  is the baseline that pre-trains the vision encoder with the combination of convolutional denoising auto-encoder and meta-learning.\nMEVF+SAN, MEVF+BAN adopt the SAN and BAN to fuse pre-trained vision representations and texural features. CRPD  leverages medical images to train and distill the general image encoder for Medical-VQA, employing the contrastive representation learning with\nrandom mask augmentation strategy.\nCRPD+BAN combines with the BAN attention mechanism for cross-modal fusion. MMBERT [ref]21 adopts the BERT  to grasp the interaction of the images and texture through the Masked Language Modeling tasks with random mask strategy. VQAMix  claims to mitigate data limitation in medical VQA through the conditional-mixed labels data augmentation strategy with great interpretability. PubMedCLIP-ViT-B+QCR [ref]11 applies the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training(CLIP) with random augmentation strategy to better extract vision representations for Medical-VQA, whereas the question conditional reasoning module is used to improve reasoning ability.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: The UnICLAM is compared with the 111111 current state-of-the-art models   [ref]42   [ref]21  [ref]11.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
