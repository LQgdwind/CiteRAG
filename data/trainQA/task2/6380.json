Most recently, diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have risen to prominence in generative modelling following impressive results in text-driven image generation.\nDPMs models essentially provide a way to model the entire probability distribution of data using only squared error minimisation during training.\nIn speech synthesis, DPMs been used for acoustic modelling, waveform generation (e.g.,  ), and even end-to-end synthesis (e.g., ).\nWe here focus on acoustic modelling, as it is the part of TTS that most resembles gesture generation and thus offers a natural integration point.\nOff-the-shelf neural vocoders can then be used to generate waveforms.\n For acoustic models, Diff-TTS  was the first work to apply diffusion-based models to synthesise mel-spectrograms.\nLater, Grad-TTS [ref]23 (described further in Sec.Â 3.1) formulated the diffusion process as a stochastic differential equation (SDE).\nFollowing Grad-TTS, Grad-StyleSpeech  introduced reference style vectors for few-shot synthesis, whilst Guided-TTS  considered few-shot synthesis with speaker embeddings. We base our work on\nGrad-TTS [ref]23 and use the same monotonic alignment search to jointly learn the alignment between input text and synthesised speech and gesture.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: Neural models of acoustics and waveforms have taken TTS technology to new heights  [ref]12.\nBy now, a large number of deep generative approaches have been applied to speech synthesis tasks [ref]13, including GANs  , VAEs , and normalising flows  .\nFor large read-speech\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
