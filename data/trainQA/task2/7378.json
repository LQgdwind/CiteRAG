      "content": "Paper Title: OpenMoE: An Early Effort on Open Mixture-of-Experts Language Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLarge Language Model (LLM) has exhibited remarkable performance on various NLP tasks  7, and has even become a part of our daily lives through chatbot applications such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Copilot.\nHowever, LLMs are computationally expensive in both training and inference.\nAs LLMs become increasingly prevalent, enhancing their performance without proportionally increasing computational resources is a critical challenge.\nIn response to this challenge, [ref]36  proposed the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to scale up the trainable parameters of the transformer with little additional computation overhead.\nRecent advancements in MoE-based language models, such as GLaM 4 and ST-MoE  have demonstrated superior performance in various tasks.\nHowever, before the release of OpenMoE, there were few open-sourced MoE language models trained with trillion-level diverse datasets. In this work, we set forth three primary goals: (1) To offer a first-attempt solution in detail for training a decoder-only MoE model within the existing framework of training LLMs. (2) To perform an in-depth analysis of the MoE routing mechanisms, thereby providing the research community with deeper insights into the behaviors and potential limitations of MoE-based LLMs. (3) To pave the way for future MoE LLM development. Through this early endeavor, we aim to stimulate and accelerate the growth of the open-source MoE community. Releasing OpenMoE. First, we release OpenMoE, a series of open-sourced MoE-based LLMs, including:\n(1) OpenMoE-Base/16E: a small model with 0.65B parameters for debugging purposes. 16E means 16 experts per MoE layer;\n(2) OpenMoE-8B/32E: this variant features 8B parameters in total, activating around 2B parameters per token in Transformer blocks, and is pre-trained on over 1 trillion tokens;\n(3) OpenMoE-8B/32E-Chat, a chat version of OpenMoE-8B/32E, fine-tuned with a 100K subset of the WildChat  dataset;\n(4) OpenMoE-34B/32E: a larger scale model, activating 6B parameters per token in Transformer blocks and trained with 200B tokens, serving as a testament to the scalability of our approach.\nDetailed configuration can be found in Appendix B\nOur OpenMoE-8B/32E models achieved comparable performance with OpenLLaMA-3B  and TinyLLaMA-1.1B , two dense open LLMs used higher training cost. Notably, On the MT-Bench , OpenMoE-8B/32E-Chat outperformed the two dense LLMs significantly on the single-turn conversation.\nIn addition, we release 5 intermediate checkpoints of OpenMoE-8B/32E, each trained with 200B more tokens than the previous one, to support and encourage future research. Section 2 and 3 will discuss the design, training details, and evaluation results of OpenMoE. Exploring Advanced Training Strategies. As part of our research endeavor, we are committed to exploring more advanced Techniques in LLM training:\n(1) Different from the common practice of training models on in-house or text-dominated open-sourced data, we train OpenMoE with a substantial proportion of code, constituting up to 52.25% during the early stages of pre-training;\n(2) Moving beyond the conventional next-token prediction training objective, we investigate UL2 training objective , motivated by its proven effectiveness in previous work  and its good alignment with coding data .\nWe acknowledge that the performance of our model, while acceptable, does not significantly exceed our expectations, which may be attributed to some sub-optimal design choices. Nevertheless, we believe that this exploratory work offers substantial value to the open-source community, particularly in assessing the potential and effectiveness of these under-explored techniques.\n Studying MoE Routing In-depth. While MoE is effective, there remains a lack of study on why MoE performs well. From a high level, MoE introduces more trainable parameters than its dense counterpart. To keep the FLOPs fixed when scaling the number of parameters, MoE applies a routing layer that sparsely and adaptively assigns each token to a few experts. This process of sparse expert selection is crucial to MoE’s functionality. Unfortunately, despite existing pieces of literature briefly visualizing the routing decison  6   [ref]36, we still don’t have a clear understanding of how the router works and how the routing decision impacts the results in MoE models, especially for the post-ChatGPT LLMs trained on a mixture of datasets from diverse domains.\nIn this work, we study this problem based on various taxonomies, including domain, language, task, and token. Our key findings are as follows:\n(1) Context-independent Specialization: MoE tends to simply cluster tokens based on similar token-level semantics, implying that, regardless of context, a certain token is more likely to be routed to a certain expert; (2) Early Routing Learning: Token ID routing specialization is established early in pre-training and remains largely fixed, resulting in tokens being consistently processed by the same experts throughout the training; (3) Drop-towards-the-End: Since each expert has a fixed max capacity, tokens appearing later in the sequence face a higher risk of being dropped if the expert is already at capacity. This issue is more severe in instruction-tuning datasets. These datasets often exhibit a domain gap compared to the pre-training data, meaning that the balanced token assignment strategies established and solidified during early pre-training may not be samely effective in instruction-tuning scenarios.\nThis is concerning as instruction data plays an important role in deploying LLMs to real-world applications. Section 4 discusses the above phenomenons in detail. Rethinking Our Mistakes and Proposing Potential Solutions. In retrospect, our project encountered several mistakes and made sub-optimal decisions (e.g., aggressive data mixture), as detailed in Section 5.\nAs an early open-source effort, we believe that sharing these experiences and insights is crucial, perhaps even more important than solely focusing on successful strategies.\nBased on our empirical findings during training and subsequent visualization analysis (Section 4), we have developed a set of potential solutions. We sincerely hope these insights can help the community develop better models in the future. The structure of this paper mirrors the lifecycle of the OpenMoE project, encompassing all its phases. This includes the initial design (Section 2), training and evaluation (Section 3, in-depth analysis (Section 4), and a rethinking of the OpenMoE project (Section 5).\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: and inference.\nAs LLMs become increasingly prevalent, enhancing their performance without proportionally increasing computational resources is a critical challenge.\nIn response to this challenge, [ref]36  proposed the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to scale up the trainable parameters of the transformer with little additional computation overhead.\nRecent advancements in MoE-based language models,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
