      "content": "Paper Title: Bayesian Statistical Model Checking for Multi-agent Systems using HyperPCTL*\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBroadly, two classes of techniques have been explored for verification of probabilistic properties on probabilistic system models.\nProbabilistic model checking (PMC) techniques based on numerical methods that compute exact probability of satisfaction of a specification given in logics such as LTL , PCTL  , CSL , Bounded Temporal Logic (BTL)  and œâùúî\\omega-regular languages  on stochastic models such as discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC)    , continuous time Markov chain (CTMC)  , Markov decision process (MDP)   and œâùúî\\omega-automaton  have been explored. However, these methods are generally model specific and involve solving a system of linear equations   or complex properties of algebraic and transcendental number theory , which makes them computationally intensive. On the other hand, statistical model checking (SMC) algorithms are based on random sampling of the probabilistic models and use statistical tests to provide (with certain confidence) inference on whether probability of a property lies within a certain range. Although SMC can only provide answers with certain amount of errors, it is much less computation intensive and thus used in a large number of real life applications  . SMC has been used for verification of properties specified in LTL  , Bounded LTL , Probabilistic Bounded LTL , PCTL [ref]25 and CSL [ref]2   where DTMC [ref]25 [ref]2 , CTMC , MDP  , semi-Markov process (SMP)  , generalised semi-Markov process (GSMP)  and various Stochastic Hybrid Systems (SHS)       have been considered for the underlying probabilistic models. A brief discussion on state of the art SMC techniques (e.g., sampling and testing methods) can be found from several survey papers  . For example, sampling techniques like Monte-Carlo  and perfect simulation  have been used to sample various probabilistic models, and statistical tests like Bayesian [ref]2 , importance sampling , acceptance sampling  have been used to gather inference about their probabilistic properties. Detailed study on various statistical tests and their applications has been performed  . Tools like Apmc , PRISM , STORM  have been developed that can automatically verify probabilistic properties on probabilistic models. Encoding multi-trace properties (known as hyperproperties) using logics like LTL, PCTL, CSL is not straightforward as they mainly capture properties about individual traces of the underlying model. Logics like Bounded HyperLTL , HyperLTL [ref]3, HyperCTL* [ref]3 were defined for specification of hyperproperties. More recently, HyperPSTL  and HyperPCTL*  have been defined to encode probabilistic hyperproperties. Model checking of probabilistic hyperproperties is a relatively new area of research; one recent work explores a statistical model-checking algorithm based on Clopper-Pearson interval method  and sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) . In this paper, we explore a Bayesian approach for verification of probabilistic hyperproperties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first statistical model-checking algorithm for probabilistic hyperproperties based on a Bayesian approach.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: computation intensive and thus used in a large number of real life applications  .
