A typical MCS system is composed of one or multiple data requesters, an MCS platform (MCSP), and multiple MUs  and [ref]7.\nThe data requesters submit their sensing requests to the MCSP who acts as the intermediary between the data requesters and the MUs.\nParticularly, the MCSP converts the sensing requests into sensing tasks, and publishes the tasks to the MUs including information about their type.\nThe MUs independently decide whether to participate or not in each published task.\nThis decision is selfishly and individually made by each MU depending on the effort needed to perform the task and the expected payment from the MCSP .\nThe MUs signal their willingness to participate in a task by sending a sensing offer to the MCSP containing a payment proposal, i.e., the number of monetary units the MU is charging the MCSP for performing the task.\nBased on the offers of the MUs, the MCSP then decides which task is assigned to each MU by sending them an acknowledgment to their sensing proposal.\nThe revenue of the MCSP depends on its own earnings, i.e, the net payments received from the data requesters for their service after paying the MUs for performing the sensing tasks.\nThe MUs’ satisfaction depends on the number of sensing offers that were accepted by the MSCP.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: that the interest in MCS has steadily increased across academia and industry. A typical MCS system is composed of one or multiple data requesters, an MCS platform (MCSP), and multiple MUs  and [ref]7.\nThe data requesters submit their sensing requests to the MCSP who acts as the intermediary between the data requesters and the MUs.\nParticularly, the MCSP converts the sensing requests into\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
