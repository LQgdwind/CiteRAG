Traditional methods employ  hidden Markov models (HMM) , such as [ref]23 predicts facial motions through HMM learnt from time-aligned audio-visual streams with the minimized entropy.\nRecently, deep learning achieved great success which also brought benefits to the TFG task.\nIndeed, the majority of those TFG works can be categorized into intermediate representation-based and reconstruction-based methods [ref]11, as elaborated next. Intermediate representation-based TFG methods include two cascaded modules which learn intermediate facial representations i.e., landmarks or 3D meshes for face synthesis from the coherent speech input. For example, in , facial landmarks are predicted from input speeches which are then used to generate face videos conditioned on a reference image.\nIn , landmarks dependent on speech content and speaker identity are disentangled to generate faces of unseen subjects.\nIn , 3D facial meshes are reconstructed from the extracted expression, geometry and pose parameters to facilitate TFG.\nHowever, these methods strongly depend on the quality of 3D face model construction, and are hard to be applied to arbitrary identities [ref]12. Thus has limited generalization capability. Moreover, fine details i.e., teeth regions are difficult to be captured using 3D models  which may degrade the generation performance. Reconstruction-based methods mostly adopt the encoder-decoder structure to generate talking face videos end-to-end. In , a pre-trained discriminator conditioned on the lip-speech sync is employed which emphasizes its impact on the sync quality. By disentangling speech- and identity-related factors from video, [ref]12 learns better visual representations through the proposed associative and adversarial training strategy.\nDifferently,  improves the audio representations by disentangling phonetic and emotional content from speech to generate better TFG results. Reconstruction-based methods are free of generating intermediate ground truth and contain fine details of mouth [ref]11.\nTherefore, we rely on the reconstruction strategy to synthesize photo-realistic talking faces from speech directly. To be noted, our concept of employing a lip-reading expert to penalize the incorrectly generated images can be easily extended to both categories while we select the reconstruction strategy to set an example.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: TFG was first studied in the 1990s  which aims at mapping acoustic features to time-aligned realistic facial motions.
