      "content": "Paper Title: Rethinking Multi-domain Generalization with A General Learning Objective\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDomain shift, which breaks the independent and identical distributed (i.i.d.) assumption amid training and test distributions [ref]50, poses a common yet challenging problem in real-world scenarios.\nMulti-domain generalization (mDG) ) is garnering increasing attention owing to its promising capacity to utilize multiple distinct but related source domains for model optimization, ultimately intending to generalize well to unseen domains.\nIntrinsically, the primary objective for mDG is the maximization of the joint distribution between observations 𝐗𝐗{\\mathbf{X}} and targets 𝐘𝐘{\\mathbf{Y}} across all domains 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}: A prevalent approach initiates by maximizing the marginal distribution P​(𝐗|𝒟)𝑃conditional𝐗𝒟P({\\mathbf{X}}|\\mathcal{D}) before presuming an invariant P​(𝐘|𝐗)=P​(𝐘|𝐗,𝒟)𝑃conditional𝐘𝐗𝑃conditional𝐘𝐗𝒟P({\\mathbf{Y}}|{\\mathbf{X}})=P({\\mathbf{Y}}|{\\mathbf{X}},\\mathcal{D}) across domains ,\nanchored on an assumption that P​(𝐘|𝒟)𝑃conditional𝐘𝒟P({\\mathbf{Y}}|\\mathcal{D}) remains consistency across 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}. Is P​(𝐘|𝒟)𝑃conditional𝐘𝒟P({\\mathbf{Y}}|\\mathcal{D}) truly static across domains? In other words, does 𝐘𝐘{\\mathbf{Y}} truly lack domain-dependent features?\nIn classification tasks, typically, the influence of 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} on 𝐘𝐘{\\mathbf{Y}} is substantially marginal. However, this assumption is not universally applicable, particularly in tasks such as regression or segmentation. Consequently, MDA [ref]16 relaxes the assumption of stable P​(𝐘|𝒟)𝑃conditional𝐘𝒟P({\\mathbf{Y}}|\\mathcal{D}) by providing an average class discrepancy, allowing both P​(𝐗|𝐘,𝒟)𝑃conditional𝐗𝐘𝒟P({\\mathbf{X}}|{\\mathbf{Y}},\\mathcal{D}) and P​(𝐘|𝒟)𝑃conditional𝐘𝒟P({\\mathbf{Y}}|\\mathcal{D}) vary across 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}. However, MDA has to conduct class-specific sample selection under domains for obtaining P​(𝐗|𝐘,𝒟)𝑃conditional𝐗𝐘𝒟P({\\mathbf{X}}|{\\mathbf{Y}},\\mathcal{D}), which constrains its objective’s universality and struggles with tasks beyond basic classification, especially where 𝐘𝐘{\\mathbf{Y}} is not discrete. To better tackle the 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}-dependent variations in both 𝐗𝐗{\\mathbf{X}} and 𝐘𝐘{\\mathbf{Y}} for border tasks beside classification, we introduce two learnable mappings, ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi and ψ𝜓\\psi, that project 𝐗𝐗{\\mathbf{X}} and 𝐘𝐘{\\mathbf{Y}} into the same latent Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), assumed to extract 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}-independent features from 𝐗,𝐘𝐗𝐘{\\mathbf{X}},{\\mathbf{Y}}. Incorporating these, Eq. 1 can be changed as Built upon the optimization of Eq. 2, we further identify two additional issues that warrant consideration. 1). The synergy of integrating prior information and domain-invariant feature learning plays a crucial role. pre-trained (oracle) models can be used as priors   to regulate feature learning. 2). Issues regarding invalid causality predicament within the P​(𝐘|𝒟)𝑃conditional𝐘𝒟P({\\mathbf{Y}}|\\mathcal{D}) static assumption relaxation during learning the invariance come to light. This is aligned with the causality premise ϕ​(𝐗)→ψ​(𝐘)→italic-ϕ𝐗𝜓𝐘\\phi({\\mathbf{X}})\\to\\psi({\\mathbf{Y}}) to maximize P​(ϕ​(𝐗),ψ​(𝐘)∣𝒟)𝑃italic-ϕ𝐗conditional𝜓𝐘𝒟P({\\phi({\\mathbf{X}}),\\psi({\\mathbf{Y}})\\mid\\mathcal{D}}). Efforts must be made to suppress invalid causality ψ​(𝐘)→ϕ​(𝐗)→𝜓𝐘italic-ϕ𝐗\\psi({\\mathbf{Y}})\\to\\phi({\\mathbf{X}}) during invariant-feature learning (Refer to Eq. 8 for derivation). Considering these findings, the general objective for mDG, which copes with the above issues and effectively relaxes the static target distribution assumption, is crucial.\nTo be specific, it should consist of four key parts:\nAim1- Learning domain-invariant representations and Aim2- Maximizing the posterior; with two regularization Reg1- Integrating prior information and the Reg2- Suppression of invalid causality. In essence, the objective should certify invariant representations of 𝐗,𝐘𝐗𝐘{\\mathbf{X}},{\\mathbf{Y}} across domains while preserving the prediction relationship in 𝐗→𝐘→𝐗𝐘{\\mathbf{X}}\\!\\to\\!{\\mathbf{Y}}. As a notable contribution, we redesign the conventional mDG paradigm and uniformly simplify most previous works’ empirical objectives, as summarized in Table 1 while Notations are shown in Table 2. Most current mDG studies only focus on classification. SOTA methods such as MIRO  and SIMPLE  propose learning similar features by “oracle” models as a substitute for learning domain-invariant representations for mDG. Worth mentioning, we counter MIRO’s argument by confirming the persisting necessity of domain-invariant features, even under prior distribution, by theoretically deviating from minimizing the Generalized Jensen-Shannon Divergence (GJSD). MDA [ref]16 pioneered the relaxation of the P​(𝐘|𝒟)𝑃conditional𝐘𝒟P({\\mathbf{Y}}|\\mathcal{D}) static assumption,\nyet without explicitly introducing a 𝐘𝐘{\\mathbf{Y}}-mapping function, and overlooked the emergence of invalid causality that arises upon the relaxation.\nBeyond classification,\nRobustNet [ref]10 and VA-DepthNet 1 explore their methods on mDG settings in segmentation and regression but propose no explicit objective for mDG.\nImportantly, our theoretical analysis and empirical findings suggest that mere aggregation of all the aforementioned objectives fails to yield a comprehensive general objective for mDG. For instance, term −H​(P​(ϕ​(𝐗|𝒟)))𝐻𝑃italic-ϕconditional𝐗𝒟\\!-H(P({\\phi({\\mathbf{X}}|\\mathcal{D})})), coupled with prior knowledge utilization, could inadvertently precipitate performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce the General Multi-Domain Generalization Objective (GMDG) to overcome current limitations in current methods,\nrelaxing the static assumption of P​(𝐘|𝒟)𝑃conditional𝐘𝒟P({\\mathbf{Y}}|\\mathcal{D}) (overall formulation is shown in Section 3). Meanwhile, we propose an actionable solution to the invalidated causality through the minimization of the Conditional Feature Shift (CFS). Our main contributions can be summarized as follows: We theoretically prove that domain generalization can be improved through the minimization of Generalized Jensen-Shannon Divergence (GJSD), with the incorporation of prior knowledge, leading to the derivation of an alignment upper bound (PUB) (Section 3). We analyze existing approaches, demonstrating their incomplete optimization against the GMDG and identifying unexpected terms they inadvertently introduce (Section 4). Our approach is the first try that is designed as compatible with existing mDG frameworks and exhibits performance improvements in a suite of tasks, including regression, segmentation, and classification, as confirmed by our comprehensive experiments (Section 5). Notably, our results that only used one pre-trained model as prior in classification tasks exceed the SOTA SIMPLE++, which employs 283 pre-trained models as an ensemble oracle, while yielding consistent improvement in regression and segmentation, as shown in Figure 1.\nThis further suggests the superiority of GMDG.\n\nReference markers found: [50]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]50: Domain shift, which breaks the independent and identical distributed (i.i.d.) assumption amid training and test distributions [ref]50, poses a common yet challenging problem in real-world scenarios.\nMulti-domain generalization (mDG) ) is garnering increasing attention owing to its promising capacity to utilize multiple\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
