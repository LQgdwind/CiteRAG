Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Skeleton-based Human Action Recognition via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep-learning approaches have been demonstrated superiority over conventional machine learning algorithms in various computer vision tasks, including image classification as demonstrated in [ref]1 in the ImageNet dataset, object detection as introduced by Ren et al.  with their Faster R-CNN framework, action recognition as recently revisited by Duan et al [ref]14, and action detection as proposed by Wang et al. . In recent years, skeleton-based representations have garnered increasing attention due to the wealth of rich and discriminative features that can be obtained from the skeleton joints. Examples of such representations include the Skeleton Map[ref]16, Joint Trajectory Map, Joint Distance Map , among others, all of which are based solely on features extracted from the skeleton joints data.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Deep-learning approaches have been demonstrated superiority over conventional machine learning algorithms in various computer vision tasks, including image classification as demonstrated in [ref]1 in the ImageNet dataset, object detection as introduced by Ren et al.  with their Faster R-CNN framework, action recognition as recently revisited by Duan et al [ref]14, and action detection\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
