      "content": "Paper Title: A Graph-Based Method for Soccer Action Spotting Using Unsupervised Player Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSoccer is perhaps the most popular sport in the world as it is officially played in 187 countries  and, as an example, it gathered an estimated live audience of 1,12 billion people for the 2018 World Cup final  [ref]12, a figure close to fifteen percent of the world population. Moreover, this interest in broadcast soccer matches has become one of the major sources of revenue for soccer clubs in leagues such as the European . Accordingly, there is a growing interest in analyzing soccer videos to provide tactical information [ref]1, quantitative statistics and visualizations , camera selection in broadcasting [ref]8, or video summaries  that aim to highlight the main events of a match. In all these tasks, the automatic spotting of key actions such as goal, corner or red card (among others) stands as a fundamental tool. At the present time, locating events in soccer videos is manually performed by trained operators aided by algorithmic tools. These operators not only rely on recorded broadcast videos, but also in event metadata coming from logs, GPS data, and video-tracking data 5. This is a laborious task considering that a soccer match lasts around 90 minutes, but it can contain more than 1,500 events 9 and take about 8 hours to annotate them  . As defined in , the action spotting task aims at locating the anchor time that identifies such event. Current approaches for action spotting from soccer videos are based on modeling the dynamics of the game, the complexity of the events and the variation of the video sequences. Several methods have been focused on the latter    , as they exploit the similar visual features of standard shots of video sequences. For instance, the shots of a standard goal scoring video sequence could consist of a goal-view of a player shooting and scoring, a close-up of fans rejoicing, and a zoom-in of the team celebrating. Other methods have considered also modeling the narration given by the broadcast commentators . In contrast, a few methods  have modeled the visual dynamics of the game as it entails understanding the interactions of the players according to the rules of the game. Moreover, videos of broadcast sport events present an additional difficulty since they usually do not cover all the field, making the location of the players unknown at a given time. Besides, broadcast video sequences are not always showing the main action of the game, as they also capture the audience in the stands, the coaches in the bench, and replays. In this work, our aim is to model the interactions of soccer players rather than using global generic features to perform action spotting in soccer videos. Consequently, we propose a model that represents the players in the field as nodes linked by their distance in a graph. The information about each player contained in the nodes is their position on the field, a calculated motion vector, and their predicted player class. A schematic overview of our approach is shown in Figure 1.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: the most popular sport in the world as it is officially played in 187 countries  and, as an example, it gathered an estimated live audience of 1,12 billion people for the 2018 World Cup final  [ref]12, a figure close to fifteen percent of the world population.
