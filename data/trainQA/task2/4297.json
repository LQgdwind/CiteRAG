There are gaps in neuro/cognitive science findings and artificial intelligence techniques for DAA of spoken language; however, it is important to integrate them.\nIt is assumed that some regions in the brain are responsible for the processing of the double articulation structure.\nThere is a near consensus on the regional partitioning of the auditory cortex in non-human primates .\nHowever, where and how DAA is performed in the human brain has not been established, although some insights into this process have been obtained[ref]6.\nIn contrast, there are computational models that allow for DAA [ref]7 [ref]8 .\nThe nonparametric Bayesian double articulation analyzer (NPB-DAA) [ref]7 is an unsupervised learning method based on Bayesian inference in a probabilistic generative model (PGM) that assumes that time-series data has a double-articulation structure.\nHowever, these computational models do not incorporate neuroscientific findings, and their correspondence to the brain has not been discussed.\nThis study compared, mapped, and integrated these existing computational models with neuroscientific findings. This study is part of the grand challenge of realizing a whole-brain architecture using PGM 0.\nRelated approaches have modeled the biologically-inspired function in whole-brain format 1 2; however, they have not been studied in a manner that can be implemented in a real robot.\nThe reason for modeling a brain-inspired architecture using PGMs is that the Neuro-SERKET (symbol emergence in the robotics tool kit) is available for both theoretical and practical use 3.\nWhole-brain PGM is expected to integrate with PGM sub-modules for multiple brain regions using Neuro-SERKET.\nTherefore, the PGM for DAA proposed in this study can be used as a module to represent an integrated whole-brain cognitive architecture. Brain reference architecture (BRA) can be developed using the structure-constrained interface decomposition (SCID) method .\nThe SCID method creates a brain information flow (BIF), which is a data flow diagram that shows the information processing architecture of the brain while defining the top-level function (TLF) and the region of interest (ROI).\nThis allows the construction of a hypothetical component diagram (HCD) that systematizes the TLFs for which the ROIs are responsible so that they are consistent with the anatomical structure.\nTherefore, the SCID method can be used to construct a computational model in terms of neuroscience and engineering.\nThis study used the SCID method to construct a PGM for DAA by generating hypotheses based on anatomical and neuroscientific findings of the brain.\nThe contributions of this study are as follows:\n Investigation of the anatomical structure and function of the brain regions involved in the DAA of spoken language and their compilation into a brain information flow diagram. Construction of a novel PGM consistent with the anatomical structure and function of the brain based on existing computational models of DAA.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: of the auditory cortex in non-human primates .\nHowever, where and how DAA is performed in the human brain has not been established, although some insights into this process have been obtained[ref]6.\nIn contrast, there are computational models that allow for DAA [ref]7 [ref]8 .\nThe nonparametric Bayesian double articulation analyzer (NPB-DAA) [ref]7 is an unsupervised learning method\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
