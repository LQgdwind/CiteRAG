      "content": "Paper Title: Reducing Traffic Wastage in Video Streaming via Bandwidth-Efficient Bitrate Adaptation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nForecasting the download time of transmitted chunks has always been a critical aspect of adaptive streaming systems, as it directly affects the calculation of rebuffering time, which is closely related to QoE performance.\nIn our context of wastage-controlled systems, the network predictor gains even more significance.\nWith decreased buffer occupancy, there is less room for error in throughput predictions, as there are not enough video segments stored in the buffer to compensate for inaccuracies.\nTo address this need for highly precise transmission time predictions for each video chunk, we propose T3​P\\mathrm{T^{3}P} in this section. Challenges and solutions:\nIn the following content, we first reveal the intricacies of the highly nonlinear complexity inherent in the network information, as well as the irregular time series characteristics present in historical network bandwidth sampling data.\nThen we introduce from a high-level perspective how the T3​P\\mathrm{T^{3}P} algorithm is designed to tackle these challenges. Highly non-linear complexity:\nThe relationship between available network information and transmission time exhibits high non-linearity and complexity.\nThe user’s allocated bandwidth is influenced by numerous cross-layer network factors as well as the size of the requested chunk   .\nThis complexity makes it difficult to effectively capture the features and patterns needed for accurate transmission time prediction. To address this challenge, we first perform decoupling to separate the various influences on the allocated bandwidth, thereby simplifying the learning task.\nThen we employ an encoder-only transformer to handle the pattern learning task.\nAs one of the most cutting-edge deep learning architectures built upon the attention mechanism, Transformers have demonstrated their efficacy in capturing complex patterns and dependencies [ref]40 [ref]41 [ref]42  , making them well-suited for handling non-linear and complex network data. Irregular time series: The historical network data is essentially irregular time series data, as the measurements are not taken at fixed time intervals.\nFigure 2 displays the download process and highlights the key time points, which helps to describe the irregular nature of network data sampling. By dividing the size of the ii-th video chunk by its download time, we can obtain the average throughput pip_{i} during the download of the ii-th chunk.\nThis value can be approximately considered as the bandwidth value at tibt_{i}^{b}, which is the midpoint of the download time for chunk ii: And the bandwidth sampling interval τi\\tau_{i}, which refers to the time difference between consecutive observations of bandwidth, is calculated as: It is evident that the sampling intervals for the bandwidth are not constant.\nThis variability in time intervals could lead to changes in the correlation structures between data points.\nTherefore, we incorporate sampling times as input features and design a time perception module based on a key-query attention mechanism  to effectively handle the irregular time-series network data. Model:\nConsidering the aforementioned network characteristics, we present T3​P\\mathrm{T^{3}P}, a Transformer-based, time-aware transmission delay prediction model, to predict the transmission time of each chunk based on the historical measurements of network throughput, corresponding sampling time, and requested chunk size. Figure 3 illustrates the basic network structure of T3​P\\mathrm{T^{3}P}.\nOur model consists of three main components: a pattern learning module, a time perception module and a prediction module.\nEach module plays a crucial role in the overall efficacy of the model.\nIn the pattern learning module, we first simplify the task to enable efficient network pattern capturing, which employs a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with shared parameters to decouple the influence of the requested chunk size. Following this, we adopt an encoder-only transformer  architecture to learn the complex patterns of network performance and trends.\nThe primary objective of the time perception module is to investigate the impact of the sampling time of historical data on network status prediction.\nTo achieve this, we employ a key-query attention mechanism that derives time-aware attention weights, evaluating the impact of varying sampling intervals on the temporal correlation between historical data at the same position in the sequence and the future bandwidth.\nIn the final step, the prediction module integrates the outputs from both the pattern learning and time perception modules with the requested chunk size to provide a direct estimation of transmission time. Pattern Learning Module:\nA variety of confounding factors determine the evolution of throughput, and even with powerful deep learning models, it is impossible to capture all influencing mechanisms simultaneously.\nHence, we first simplify the learning task by decoupling the influence of requested chunk size on throughput. We insert the historical TT data points xk−T,⋯,xk−1x_{k-T},\\cdots,x_{k-1} (we use x1,x2,⋯,xTx_{1},x_{2},\\cdots,x_{T} instead for brevity) into the pattern learning module.\nSpecifically, xix_{i} is composed of did_{i} and bib_{i}, representing the size of chunk ii and the throughput measured at time tibt_{i}^{b}.\nOwing to scheduling policies in network pipelines and TCP’s slow start mechanism, allocated bandwidth is not linearly affected by chunk size.\nTherefore, we respectively feed each xix_{i} into a MLP with shared parameters to obtain a decoupled network state vector vi∈I​Rsv_{i}\\in IR^{s}.\n\nThe MLP used here consists of three layers, each with 16 neurons.\nThe first two layers use the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function, while the last layer uses a linear one. Subsequently, we input V=[v1,v2,⋯,vT]V=[v_{1},v_{2},\\cdots,v_{T}] into an encoder-only Transformer model (denoted as FF) to learn long-term dependencies among historical network states.\n\nThe detailed architecture of the Encoder-only Transformer model is illustrated in Fig. 4.\nThe model primarily consists of an input layer, a position encoding layer, and a standard encoder layer.\nThe input layer maps VV to a vector of dimension dm​o​d​e​ld_{model} through a fully-connected network.\nThen, the position encoding layer is added to incorporate temporal order information into the time series data, which is performed in the same manner as in Vaswani et al ..\nAfterwards, we feed the resulting vector into a one-layer encoder to learn the long-term dependencies among the historical data.\nThe final output of our encoder-only Transformer is: Time Perception Module:\nDue to the irregular temporal nature of network data, historical data at the same position in the sequence may exert varying impacts on the future bandwidth prediction.\nTherefore, it is essential to learn the influence of sampling time intervals on the correlation between data points.\nIn this module, we utilize a key-query attention mechanism  to generate time-aware attention weights.\nBy converting the decoupled network state vector as a query vector and the processed sampling time interval as a key vector, we can obtain attention weights that help adjust the significance of historical network data at different positions in the sequence with respect to the future bandwidth prediction. First, we compute the interval δi\\delta_{i} between the historical bandwidth sampling time and the current time: Then we convert each time interval δi\\delta_{i} into a key vector ki∈I​Rsk_{i}\\in IR^{s}: where Wk∈I​RsW_{k}\\in IR^{s} and bk∈I​Rsb_{k}\\in IR^{s} are parameters.\nMeanwhile, we convert the historical network state vector VV into a query vector q∈I​Rsq\\in IR^{s}: where Wq∈I​RTW_{q}\\in IR^{T} and bq∈I​Rsb_{q}\\in IR^{s} are parameters. To investigate the influence of sampling time intervals on the correlation structures between data points, the key-query attention mechanism is applied to get an attention weight: We then get normalized time-aware attention weights β\\beta through a softmax layer: Finally, we obtain the prediction of the hidden state vector of future network h∗∈I​Rsh_{*}\\in IR^{s} by combining the time-aware attention weights and the hidden representation of historical network states: Prediction Module:\nThis module is responsible for restoring the impact of requested chunk volume and generating the final prediction results for the transmission time.\nFirst, we integrate h∗h_{*} with the size of the chunk being transmitted d∗d_{*}.\nThen, we employ a multi-layer feedforward neural network (FNN) to restore the nonlinear effects of chunk size on allocated bandwidth.\n\nThe FNN consists of three layers with neuron distributions of 32-32-1, utilizing ReLU activation for the first two layers and linear activation for the final layer.\nThe prediction result t∗t_{*} is expressed by: Dataset and training:\nThe performance of the T3​P\\mathrm{T^{3}P} relies heavily on the network data or network environment used for training.\nAlgorithms trained in simulated environments may perform poorly in the real world because it can still not emulate the diversity and dynamics of Internet paths well  .\nTo this end, we extract the desired training data from Puffer .\nPuffer is a free, publicly accessible video streaming service platform that streams six commercial television channels over the air.\nLeveraging Puffer’s network data logging, we construct a dataset comprising ten million data points.\nThis dataset is partitioned into a ratio of 8:1:1 for training, validation and testing respectively. We set the batch size as 512 and train our model on top of the PyTorch  framework.\nWe adopt Mean Squared Loss as the loss function and use ADAM  algorithm as the optimizer.\nTo prevent overfitting, we employ early stopping with a patience of 7.\nWe also use a warm-up learning rate schedule for smooth convergence, defined as: Here, we set the w​a​r​m​u​p​_​s​t​e​p​swarmup\\_steps to be 5000 empirically.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: task.\nAs one of the most cutting-edge deep learning architectures built upon the attention mechanism, Transformers have demonstrated their efficacy in capturing complex patterns and dependencies [ref]40 [ref]41 [ref]42  , making them well-suited for handling non-linear and complex network data.
