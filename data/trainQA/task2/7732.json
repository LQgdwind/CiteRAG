This pioneering venture allows users to be part of a shared digital experience where they can play games, socialize, create, buy, or sell digital items. Few of the key components of Decentraland include LAND (virtual real estate), Parcels (individual units of LAND), Estates (clusters of LAND for collaborative purposes), Avatars (virtual user representations), and the Builder tool for creating 3D content. Notably, the popularity of Decentraland surged when virtual parcels were traded for almost $1 million in June 2021, followed by a notable transaction of cryptocurrency worth $2.4 million, with the buyer being the crypto investor Tokens.com. As reported in [ref]35, in 2022, Decentraland experienced around 8000 daily active users with large number of repeat visitors to explore and spend time on the platform. This series of events played a crucial role in propelling the market capitalization to a noteworthy $903,847,923 in the recent year . Unlike other Metaverse platforms, Decentraland is governed by the DAO, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, that utilizes off-chain voting for community engagement. As the Decentraland experiences a surge in popularity and an expanding user-base, a plethora of interesting research avenues emerge. Among these, notable research problems include predicting parcel prices and forecasting their future values, classifying high-valued parcels, and tracking intricate trends within the Decentraland ecosystem. Recent research efforts in the literature aimed at understanding the impact of various features on the dynamic pricing behavior of Decentraland Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)        [ref]29    . However, the datasets used in their training phases contain a limited number of records and attributes of Decentraland parcels, therefore lacking the comprehensive representation necessary for analyzing the multifaceted influences on parcel dynamics within Decentraland. Specifically, out of the four publicly available datasets    , two contain a maximum of 6,141 records with 37 attributes, while the other two contains social media comments/discussions. This underscores the pressing need for a comprehensive dataset encompassing Decentraland parcels along with their detailed attributes, which are currently fragmented and scattered across diverse sources. To this aim, this paper is dedicated to the development of a comprehensive dataset, called IITP-VDLand, tailored specifically for the virtual realm of Decentraland parcels. Our extensive compilation encompasses a diverse array of attributes, spanning parcels’ characteristics and their trading history, as well as transaction-specific details recorded on the Ethereum blockchain including social media data. Drawing from various sources such as Decentraland , OpenSea , Etherscan 0, Google BigQuery , Discord , Telegram 1, and Reddit , this dataset serves as a robust resource for training machine- and deep-learning models specifically designed to address real-world challenges within the domain of Decentraland parcels. In particular, our dataset comprises in total 92,598 parcels with 81 attributes. These parcels are associated with various characteristics attributes including their coordinates, geographical proximity from prominent locations, visual link, unique Id, and rarity score. This is worth emphasizing that, for the first time, we use one of the most popular rarity meters, namely Rarity.tools, to calculate the rarity score of the parcels, which measures the uniqueness of each parcel in comparison to others. To capture the market dynamics of Decentraland, we leverage the extensive trading history available on OpenSea, the largest secondary marketplace. This allows us to access offers prices and sales prices for each parcel over a specified time period. Since Decentraland operates on the Ethereum blockchain, to delve into the specifics of Ethereum on-chain transactions, we aim to include transaction details such as gas prices, bidding history, and parcel-related activities. These attributes encompass details like invoked methods, block-specific information, mining specifics, and more. In essence, we seek to comprehensively analyze Ethereum transactions within Decentraland by capturing a broad spectrum of relevant data points, facilitating deeper insights into user interactions and the ecosystem’s dynamics. We also dive into social media platforms to get a gist of people’s views and sentiments. These distinctive attributes significantly enrich our dataset, offering a novel perspective for research and academic exploration. By delving into the economic dimension of Decentraland, researchers can gain a profound understanding of this virtual world. To enhance clarity, we’ve organized our dataset into four segments: (1) Characteristics Data-Fragment, (2) OpenSea Trading History Data-Fragment, (3) Ethereum Activity Transactions Data-Fragment, and (4) Social Media Data-Fragment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first benchmark dataset that is in-depth and tailor-made for various machine- and deep-learning applications of Decentraland parcels. Unlike existing Decentraland NFT datasets which are notably incomplete and lack critical attributes, IITP-VDLand sets a new standard encompassing details ranging from parcels’ metadata, transactional details to social media data. To summarize, the major contributions of our paper are: We introduce IITP-VDLand, an extensive dataset comprising Decentraland’s parcel NFTs sourced from diverse platforms, including Decentraland , OpenSea , Etherscan 0, Google BigQuery , Discord , Telegram 1, and Reddit . This dataset serves as a robust resource for training machine- and deep-learning models tailored to tackle real-world challenges within the Decentraland NFT domain. We meticulously curate the data, creating four distinct segments: (1) Characteristics Data-Fragment, (2) OpenSea Trading History Data-Fragment, (3) Ethereum Activity Transactions Data-Fragment, and (4) Social Media Data-Fragment. Alongside the existing data, we also introduce a significant attribute of Decentraland parcels in the dataset, namely Rarity score, which quantifies the uniqueness of each parcel within the virtual world. We conduct a performance benchmarking of more than 20 state-of-the-art price prediction models on our novel dataset, aiming at assessing their predictive performance and determine which models are best suited for our dataset. The results demonstrate that ensemble models perform better than both deep learning and linear models for our dataset, achieving highest R2superscript𝑅2R^{2} score of 0.8251 and accuracy of 74.23% in case of Extra Trees Regressor and Classifier. Furthermore, the ablation study reveals the importance of various attributes present in our dataset, demonstrating the substantial influence of coordinates, geographical proximity, rarity score, and few other economic indicators on parcel price prediction. The structure of the rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we provide a preliminary background about Decentraland Metaverse platform. In Section 3, we present an overview of previous research endeavors and publicly available datasets in the literature. A detailed description of our proposed dataset is provided in Section 4, emphasizing its composition, sourcing methodology, and inherent attributes. Section 5 conducts an exploratory data analysis, highlighting key insights and patterns in our dataset. Section 6 outlines the empirical results from the performance benchmarking of our dataset using over 20 state-of-the-art price prediction models. Finally, in Section 7, we discuss our key findings and highlight the potential future avenues.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: parcels were traded for almost $1 million in June 2021, followed by a notable transaction of cryptocurrency worth $2.4 million, with the buyer being the crypto investor Tokens.com.
