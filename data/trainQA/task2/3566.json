      "content": "Paper Title: Influencing Long-Term Behavior in Multiagent Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLearning in multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) is fundamentally difficult because an agent interacts with other simultaneously learning agents in a shared environment¬†.\nThe joint learning of agents induces non-stationary environment dynamics from the perspective of each agent, requiring an agent to adapt its behavior with respect to potentially unknown changes in the policies of other agents¬†.\nNotably, non-stationary policies will converge to a recurrent set of joint policies by the end of learning.\nIn practice, this converged joint policy can correspond to a game-theoretic solution concept, such as a Nash equilibrium¬† or more generally a cyclic correlated equilibrium¬†, but multiple equilibria can exist for a single game with some of these Pareto dominating others¬†[ref]5.\nHence, a critical question in addressing this non-stationarity is how individual agents should behave to influence convergence of the recurrent set of policies towards more desirable limiting behaviors. Our key idea in this work is to consider the limiting policies of other agents as time approaches infinity.\nSpecifically, the converged behavior of this dynamic multiagent system is not due to some arbitrary stochastic processes, but rather each agent‚Äôs underlying learning process that also depends on the behaviors of the other interacting agents.\nAs such, effective agents should model how their actions can influence the limiting behavior of other agents and leverage those dependencies to shape the convergence process.\nThis farsighted perspective contrasts with recent work that also considers influencing the learning of other agents¬†[ref]6  [ref]8  0 1.\nWhile these approaches show improved performance over methods that neglect the learning of other agents entirely¬†2 3 4, they suffer from myopic evaluation: only considering a few updates to the policies of other agents or optimizing for the discounted return, which only considers a finite horizon time of 1/(1‚àíŒ≥)11ùõæ1/(1\\!-\\!\\gamma) for discount factor Œ≥ùõæ\\gamma¬†5. With this insight, we make the following primary contributions in this paper: Formalization of multiagent non-stationarity (Section¬†2). We introduce an active Markov game setting that formalizes MARL with simultaneously learning agents as a directed graphical model and captures the underlying non-stationarity over time. We detail how such a system eventually converges to a stationary periodic distribution. As such, the objective is to maximize its long-term rewards over this distribution and, if each agent maximizes this objective, the resulting multiagent system settles into a new and general equilibrium concept that we call an active equilibrium. Practical framework for optimizing an active Markov game (Section¬†3).\nWe outline a practical approach for optimization in this setting, called FUlly Reinforcing acTive influence witH averagE Reward (FURTHER). Our approach is based on a policy gradient and Bellman update rule tailored to active Markov games. Moreover, we show how variational inference can be used to approximate the update function of other agents and support decentralized execution and training. Comprehensive evaluation of our approach (Section¬†4). We demonstrate that our method consistently converges to a more desirable limiting distribution than baseline methods that either neglect the learning of others¬†4 or consider their learning with a myopic perspective¬†[ref]8 in various multiagent benchmark domains.\nWe also demonstrate that FURTHER provides a flexible framework such that it can incorporate recent advances in multiagent learning and improve performance in large-scale settings by leveraging the mean-field method¬†6.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: solution concept, such as a Nash equilibrium¬† or more generally a cyclic correlated equilibrium¬†, but multiple equilibria can exist for a single game with some of these Pareto dominating others¬†[ref]5.\nHence, a critical question in addressing this non-stationarity is how individual agents should behave to influence convergence of the recurrent set of policies towards more desirable limiting\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
