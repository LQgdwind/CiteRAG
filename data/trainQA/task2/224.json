Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: ScrabbleGAN: Semi-Supervised Varying Length Handwritten Text Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\ncan be seen as a specific case of optical character recognition (OCR).\nThis is a well studied topic, in the in-depth survey , HTR approaches are divided into online and offline methods, which differ by the type of data they consume:\nOnline methods have access to the pen location as the text is being written, and hence can disambiguate intersecting strokes.\nOffline methods, conversely, have access only to the missingfinal resulting text image (i.e. rasterized), possibly also in the presence of some background noise or clutter.\nClearly, online methods have a strict advantage over their offline counterparts in terms of data quality, but require additional equipment (such as a touchscreen) to capture pen stroke data.\nHence, online data is harder to create in large quantities, especially in a natural setting.\nFurthermore, these methods are unsuitable for historic manuscripts and markings which are entirely offline.\nFor this reason, we chose to focus on offline methods and leave online methods out of the scope for this manuscript. Modern HTR methods harness the recent advancements in deep networks, achieving top performance on most, if not all, modern benchmarks.\nMany of these methods are inspired by the convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) architecture, used originally for scene text recognition by Shi et al. .\nPoznanski et al.  used a CNN to estimate the n-grams profile of an image and match it to the profile of an existing word from a dictionary.\nPHOCNet by Sudholt et al.  extended the latter by employing a pyramidal histogram of characters (PHOC), which was used mainly for word spotting.\nSuerias et al.  used an architecture inspired by sequence to sequence [ref]41, in which they use an attention decoder rather than using the CRNN outputs directly.\nDutta et al.  compiled several recent advances in text recognition into a powerful architecture, reminiscent of modern networks for scene text recognition, as the ones presented recently by Baek et al. .\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: et al.  extended the latter by employing a pyramidal histogram of characters (PHOC), which was used mainly for word spotting.\nSuerias et al.  used an architecture inspired by sequence to sequence [ref]41, in which they use an attention decoder rather than using the CRNN outputs directly.\nDutta et al.  compiled several recent advances in text recognition into a powerful architecture,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
