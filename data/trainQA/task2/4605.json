Consequently, practitioners are perhaps left with no choice but to use their best judgment to apply a single fairness criterion. We suspect that the conflicting nature of existing mathematical definitions of fairness might have led to this undesirable practice of narrowing down fairness-related measurement and mitigation to one chosen definition. This is somewhat analogous to the trade-off between precision and recall while evaluating model performance . Instead of choosing one of precision or recall to evaluate the performance of a classification model, practitioners often evaluate the trade-off and choose models that can maintain a certain level of precision while optimizing recall or vice-versa . In this paper, we provide a framework for explicitly addressing such trade-offs among multiple fairness criteria and model performance toward optimal model selection. One of the most prolific examples of fairness in machine learning arose from the ProPublica recidivism study (), in which a risk assessment tool called COMPAS was found to be biased against black defendants. But beyond the immediate implications in criminal justice, the study also prompted more general studies in algorithmic fairness and, in particular, led to a key result highlighted in [ref]13, 1, and 5 which some colloquially refer to as the \"impossibility theorem\" in fairness 0 4. This theorem essentially states that three common definitions of algorithmic fairness - demographic parity , equalized odds 1, and predictive parity , cannot be simultaneously satisfied outside of pathological situations. Several works following these initial results have therefore focused on satisfying one metric (1 2) or proposing adaptable methods for different metrics ( 7). Yet, while we do not deny the conclusions of the impossibility theorem, we also believe there have not been sufficient efforts to reconcile the conflicting fairness definitions to the best extent possible. We fill this gap in the literature by translating the trade-offs among multiple fairness criteria and model performance into a constrained optimization problem and propose a post-processing methodology for simultaneously achieving approximate fairness in the conflicting definitions simultaneously. We believe our framework would alleviate the practitioner from making the hard choice in choosing a particular metric. Instead, if they have a partial ordering of importance amongst the metrics (which many possess), our framework would explicitly allow them evaluate such trade-offs. The application which we highlight in Section 4 discusses these in detail.\nOverall, we make three main contributions in this work: We design a flexible optimization framework that returns a post-processing score transformation function that can make scores group-wise ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-fair along three definitions (demographic parity, equalized odds, and predictive rate parity) simultaneously. This framework can be applied to any binary classifier that produces a continuous score, can be configured for singular or multiple metrics of fairness, and also can account for fairness vs. performance trade-offs in terms of ROC-AUC. We present a novel reformulation of this non-convex optimization problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) . This reformulation allows us to find provably globally optimal solutions. We further show that in practice, we can consistently find better solutions through our global optimization method compared to local optimization methods in a reasonable time. We discuss and extend our framework from a post-processing mechanism to a tool that can aid practitioners in better understanding their data and models’ empirical fairness characteristics and trade-offs and compare these traits across models. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we mathematically define fairness metrics and the multiple fairness optimization problem. We discuss the optimal solution via MILP in Section 3. We try to answer the question of “who’s the fairest of them all?” through our applications and experiments in Section 4. Finally, we conclude with a discussion in Section 5. We wrap up this section with a discussion of the related literature. Related Work:\nEarly works [ref]13 exploring the conflicts between fairness definitions prove that for a binary predictor, predictive rate parity conflicts with equalized odds (1) unless base rates are equal or the model is perfectly predictive. Chouldechova [ref]13 also considers trade-offs between the fairness definitions in the binary prediction case. Kleinberg et al. 5 generalizes this study by showing that statistical (i.e., demographic) parity is also inconsistent with predictive rate parity and equalized odds. The same paper studies these inconsistencies in a more general bin-wise prediction setting and shows that approximate fairness definitions (predictive rate parity, equalized odds) can simultaneously hold but only under ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-approximate equal base rates or ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-approximate perfect performance. This work further proves that there is an inherent trade-off between fairness and loss. Beyond impossibility theorem results, several works have focused on trade-offs between fairness and model performance 1  7 . They develop in-processing solutions aimed at reducing one metric while maintaining accuracy. A few authors have analyzed trade-offs or attempted to achieve multiple fairness. One example is Pleiss et al. 6, which shows that predictive rate parity and a relaxed form of equalized odds are reconcilable under a randomized prediction scheme. Another notable example is Celis et al. , which develops a flexible in-processing approach to achieve multiple types of fairness (potentially at the same time). Like Celis et al. , the framework we develop also aims for a flexible approach to focus on one or many fairness metrics simultaneously. However, our method is distinct in that it is a post-processing based solution and also more general as it works for continuous scores (rather than binary classification). Our work is most closely related to Nandy et al. 2 in terms of the underlying score transformation mechanism, and we leverage some of their methods. However, whereas 2 only targets equalized odds, we go further and include demographic parity and predictive rate parity in our framework—this posits computational challenges, which we address by proposing novel methodology based on\ninteger programming. As noted at the end of 5, some open questions are how to optimally assign scores to satisfy multiple criteria when base rates are equal and additionally, how to satisfy predictive rate parity and either equal TPR or TNR when one cost outweighs the other. To our knowledge, no prior work has attempted to reconcile all three fairness conditions (demographic parity, equalized odds, and predictive rate parity) simultaneously with model performance through a post-processing framework. Although the post-processing methods tend to be less flexible for fairness-performance trade-offs than their in-processing counterparts, they can be much more easily added on top of any existing model training pipeline. This makes a post-processing approach modular, and in particular, more appealing in complex web-scale recommender systems that use (a combination of) certain prediction scores to rank a list of items.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: defendants.
