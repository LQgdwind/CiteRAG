      "content": "Paper Title: Better Schedules for Low Precision Training of Deep Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBackground.\nDNNs have revolutionized the performance of autonomous systems.\nYet, such gains come at a steep cost‚ÄîDNN training is computationally burdensome and becoming more so, as the community tends towards larger-scale experiments .\nThough many approaches exist for reducing DNN overhead  , low precision training has gained recent popularity due to its ability to improve training efficiency with minimal performance impact [ref]4 [ref]5. Quantized training approaches use lower precision representations for DNN activations, gradients, and weights during training; see Figure 1.\nThen, the forward and backward pass can be expedited via (faster) low precision arithmetic, which recent generations of hardware are beginning to support .\nThough implementing quantized training is more nuanced in complex architectures (e.g., batch normalization modules require special treatment [ref]7), the basic approach remains the same‚ÄîDNN activations, weights, and gradients are replaced with lower-precision representations during training to reduce the cost of each forward and backward pass. Early approaches to quantized training adopted a static approach that maintained the same, low level of precision throughout training [ref]7  .\nAlthough this work was successful in revealing that DNN training is robust to substantial reductions in precision, later work achieved further efficiency gains by dynamically adapting precision along the training trajectory [ref]4 [ref]5.\nSuch work i)i) sets minimum (qminsubscriptùëûminq_{\\text{min}}) and maximum (qmaxsubscriptùëûmaxq_{\\text{max}}) bounds for precision, and ii)ii) varies the precision between these bounds according to some (possibly cyclical) schedule throughout training.\nInterestingly, experiments using cyclic precision training (CPT) [ref]5 demonstrated that precision plays a role similar to that of the learning rate in DNN training. Because state-of-the-art results with DNNs are often achieved using curated hyperparameter schedules 0 1 2, different scheduling options for common hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate and momentum) have been explored extensively 3 4.\nDespite known similarities between precision and the learning rate, however, no such study has been performed for low precision training‚Äîexisting approaches to CPT simply adopt common learning rate strategies (i.e., a cyclical cosine schedule [ref]5) without adequate comparison to alternatives.\nAs such, best practices for dynamically varying DNN precision along the training trajectory remain largely unknown. This work.\nTo close this gap, we provide an extensive empirical study of different CPT variants.\nFirst, we rigorously define the space of potential CPT schedules by deconstructing such schedules via a three-step process of i)i) choosing a profile, ii)ii) choosing the number of cycles, and iii)iii) choosing whether cycles are repeated and/or have a ‚Äútriangular‚Äù form.\nUsing this decomposition, we define a suite of ten CPT schedules‚Äîincluding the originally-proposed cyclical cosine schedule [ref]5‚Äîthat are analyzed across a variety of domains, including image classification and object detection with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), language modeling with long short-term memory (LSTM) networks 5, entailment classification with pre-trained transformers 1, and graph node classification with graph neural networks (GNNs) 6.\nAs a byproduct of this analysis, to the best of the authors‚Äô knowledge, we are the first to study quantized training strategies for GNNs. Going beyond prior work, we discover new CPT variants that further improve DNN training efficiency and performance relative to prior schedules, revealing that exploring a wider variety of schedules for CPT is beneficial.\nMore generally, we observe across all experiments that model performance tends to be correlated with the amount of compute used for training, revealing that manipulating the CPT schedule is a simple tool for controlling the tradeoff between model performance and training efficiency.\nAiming to explain this relationship, we draw a connection between quantized training and critical learning periods, finding that prolonged training at low precisions can impair the training process and cause a permanent performance degradation.\nFinally, we leverage these empirical observations to provide best practices for choosing the correct CPT schedule in different practical scenarios.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: .\nThough many approaches exist for reducing DNN overhead  , low precision training has gained recent popularity due to its ability to improve training efficiency with minimal performance impact [ref]4 [ref]5.
