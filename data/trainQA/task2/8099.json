      "content": "Paper Title: Hypercontractivity on HDX II: Symmetrization and 𝑞-Norms\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent years have seen the development of a powerful theory of boolean function analysis beyond the cube, with breakthrough applications in extremal and probabilistic combinatorics  , quantum communication , approximate sampling [ref]4 7 , and hardness of approximation 5 4  . Among the most powerful tools in boolean analysis, and the core of all above applications, is the theory of hypercontractivity 3, an analytic inequality bounding the high norm behavior of low degree functions on the cube. Popularized in the seminal work of Kahn, Kalai, and Linial , variants of hypercontractivity have since been established for many objects, including products [ref]9  [ref]30 , the slice , the shortcode , the Grassmann  6, and various groups  . Many potential applications of hypercontractivity (e.g. to low-soundness PCPs 5, sparsest cut , the unique games conjecture 0) are still hindered by the fact that most known hypercontractive inequalities only hold for dense domains. Motivated in this context, Gur, Lifshitz, and Liu  and Bafna, Hopkins, Kaufman, and Lovett  recently proved the first hypercontractive inequalities for sparse systems, in particular for the class of hypergraphs known as high dimensional expanders (HDX), an extension of expander graphs to high dimensions that have garnered significant interest in boolean analysis and hardness of approximation 3 9  1   1 0 2. Unfortunately, known bounds on HDX still fall short of their analogs on products: suffering from sub-optimal dependence on degree (a critical parameter in application),111Technically  do achieve the correct dependence, but only for the much stricter class of two-sided HDX. and restrictive assumptions on the low-degree function. Inspired by O’Donnell and Zhao’s  proof of hypercontractivity for products, we take a new approach for high dimensional expanders that completely avoids these issues: symmetrization. Symmetrization is a classical technique of Kahane  and Bourgain 4 which analyzes high moment behavior of functions on product spaces f:Ωi⊗d→ℝ:𝑓→superscriptsubscriptΩ𝑖tensor-productabsent𝑑ℝf:\\Omega_{i}^{\\otimes d}\\to\\mathbb{R} by convolving them with a random boolean string r∈{±1}d𝑟superscriptplus-or-minus1𝑑r\\in\\{\\pm 1\\}^{d}. Up to the application of a small amount of noise, Bourgain proved that the resulting function f~:{±1}d×Ωi⊗n→ℝ:~𝑓→superscriptplus-or-minus1𝑑superscriptsubscriptΩ𝑖tensor-productabsent𝑛ℝ\\tilde{f}:\\{\\pm 1\\}^{d}\\times\\Omega_{i}^{\\otimes n}\\to\\mathbb{R} has the same behavior of f𝑓f, allowing one to analyze f~~𝑓\\tilde{f} instead using standard analysis on its boolean component. We prove Bourgain’s theorem holds for sufficiently strong high dimensional expanders up to a (1±o​(1))plus-or-minus1𝑜1(1\\pm o(1)) factor. As applications, we prove an optimal (2→4)→24(2\\to 4)-hypercontractive inequality for high dimensional expanders, and a booster theorem for general low influence functions generalizing Bourgain’s classical result on products . This resolves two of the main open questions of   Our proof of the symmetrization theorem is based on two new ideas in the theory of high dimensional expansion. First, we introduce the notion of q𝑞q-norm HDX, which bounds the local divergence of a hypergraph from a product space in q𝑞q-norm, and show any strong enough spectral HDX is a q𝑞q-norm HDX. This allows us to manipulate higher norms directly, avoiding expensive error terms appearing in  . Second, we introduce a basic variant of coordinate-wise analysis for the noise operator Trsubscript𝑇𝑟T_{r} on q𝑞q-norm HDX, showing it can be approximately broken into coordinate-wise components Triisuperscriptsubscript𝑇subscript𝑟𝑖𝑖T_{r_{i}}^{i} that correctly localize to the standard 111-dimensional operators Trisubscript𝑇subscript𝑟𝑖T_{r_{i}} when restricted to the i𝑖ith coordinate. This allows for the replacement method as used in Bourgain’s original proof of the symmetrization theorem, greatly simplifying prior analysis.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: of a powerful theory of boolean function analysis beyond the cube, with breakthrough applications in extremal and probabilistic combinatorics  , quantum communication , approximate sampling [ref]4 7 , and hardness of approximation 5 4  .
