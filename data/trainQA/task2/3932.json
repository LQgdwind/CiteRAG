      "content": "Paper Title: Addressable Superconductor Integrated Circuit Memory from Delay Lines\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe memory density of the PTL delay line was calculated using the equation: where f𝑓f represents the operating frequency of the memory controller in Hz, w𝑤w is the PTL pitch, and v𝑣v is the travel speed of single flux quanta in m/s. \n Controller operational frequency and PTL pitch:\nThe delay results shown in Figure 7 indicate a maximum controller operational frequency of 100 GHz. In the conducted memory density analysis, as summarized in Table 1, the value of f𝑓f is selected to span from this value down to 20 GHz to highlight the trade-off between density versus bias margins, as suggested by the findings presented in Figure 8. Regarding the PTL pitch—the sum of the PTL linewidth and minimum spacing requirement—this is typically determined by the fabrication process. For example, the well-established SFQ5ee  process allows for the reliable fabrication of Nb and MoN microstrips and striplines with a 250 nm linewidth and 250 nm spacing, or a pitch of 500 nm. The more advanced SC2  process can reduce the pitch to 240 nm. Further miniaturization down to a pitch of 135 nm and smaller is possible using e-beam lithography . \n Travel speed: The velocity factor equation was used to determine the travel speed (v𝑣v) of single flux quanta in PTLs constructed with different materials. The equation is given by: Here, c𝑐c is the speed of light in m/s, L𝐿L is the inductance per unit length in H/m, and C𝐶C is the capacitance per unit length in F/m. The capacitance and inductance values used in the calculations were sourced from literature and are shown in Table 1. In cases where geometric inductance is significant, such as in Nb striplines, the inductance scales non-linearly and must be evaluated at each linewidth individually. Based on available experimental measurements , a 250 nm-wide Nb stripline has 0.5 pH/μ𝜇\\mum, while a 120 nm-wide line has 0.65 pH/μ𝜇\\mum. For high-kinetic inductors like MoN and NbTiN striplines and MoN microstrips, the kinetic inductance is directly proportional to the length of the inductor and inversely proportional to its width. This can be calculated by multiplying the known inductance per square values of 8 pH/□□\\square for MoN striplines and microstrips  and 49 pH/□□\\square for NbTiN striplines  by the unit length divided by the linewidth. Regarding their capacitances, we relied on recently-published fabrication results . For instance, a stripline having a linewidth of 120 nm has a capacitance of 0.19 fF/μ𝜇\\mum, which is solely determined by the dielectric material and geometry. Similarly, a microstrip having a linewidth of 120 nm has a capacitance of 0.14 fF/μ𝜇\\mum. For the 40 nm NbN nanowires, experimental measurements yielded an inductance of 82 pH/□□\\square or 2,050 pH/μ𝜇\\mum for this width, and a capacitance of 0.044 fF/μ𝜇\\mum .Lastly, inductance and capacitance values for 15 nm NbN nanowires were obtained from simulation results . Effects of coherent quantum phase slips (CQPS) have been observed in NbN films with comparable cross-sectional dimensions .\nNevertheless, these effects do not present an issue here, as the kinetic inductance of the films, even with the most extreme linewidths considered, is still one order of magnitude lower than what has been used to observe CQPS. Consequently, the phase-slip amplitude in our case will be e−9superscript𝑒9e^{-9} times lower than in systems in which CQPS has been shown to be a significant contributor to conductivity \n, and for this reason, we neglect it in our analysis. Layer stacking: An approach to further enhance memory density is by vertically stacking multiple layers of PTLs. In this case, the memory density increases linearly with the number of PTL layers, denoted by N𝑁N in the equation that follows: In this regard, a stackup of Nb striplines with nine planarized superconducting layers, stackable stud vias, self-shunted Nb/AlOx-Al/Nb Josephson junctions, and a single layer of MoN kinetic inductors has been successfully developed and currently serves as the de facto fabrication process  . This stackup, MIT Lincoln Laboratory’s state-of-the-art SFQ5ee process, allows for four memory layers based on the typical allocation of ground planes and signal planes. Several advancements to this process are under development, including the addition of self-shunted junctions , which use higher critical current density and can reduce the chip area of digital hardware by 50%, and the introduction of two additional routing layers . Looking forward, foundries have recently announced plans to scale up to sixteen routing layers and one layer for NbTiN kinetic inductors ; to the best of our knowledge, however, there is no fundamental limitation that constrains vertical growth 5    [ref]58.\n\nReference markers found: [58]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]58: plans to scale up to sixteen routing layers and one layer for NbTiN kinetic inductors ; to the best of our knowledge, however, there is no fundamental limitation that constrains vertical growth 5    [ref]58.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
