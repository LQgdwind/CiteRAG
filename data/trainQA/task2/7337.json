      "content": "Paper Title: GuReT: Distinguishing Guilt and Regret related Text\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEmotion analysis in the realm of digital communication has undergone significant methodological shifts. Early on, emotion analysis was limited in its approach (relay on traditional machine learning algorithms), primarily distinguishing sentiments as positive or negative  . However, the linguistic diversity and complexity in communications presented new challenges as the digital landscape expanded, and binary classification proved inadequate in capturing the depth of human emotional expression . Therefore, more sophisticated models were required for emotion analysis. Deep learning, as a transformative approach, introduced a multitude of nuanced techniques (e.g., neural networks) for emotion analysis [ref]17. A number of neural networks based approaches have been proposed, such as the Deep Averaging Networks (DAN) , Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) , and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) . These foundational models, along with more sophisticated model, such as the Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTM)  and attention mechanisms , found applications in diverse platforms. Furthermore, more recent advancements led to the development of transformer-based models (e.g., LLMs), such as Step-by-step reasoning, which further rely on self-consistency of thought [ref]23, chain-of-thought (CoT) , and tree-of-thought (ToT) [ref]25. Therefore, all these techniques and models (e.g., DialogueGCN , DialogueRNN , and PAN ) exemplify the adaptability, highlight deep learning’s efficacy in different communication contexts, and pave the way for a more granular understanding of digital sentiment. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated good results in understanding and generating human-like text due to their reasoning abilities . In the realm of emotion-related tasks, particularly regret and guilt classification, LLMs have been harnessed for their advanced reasoning abilities  . There are two methodologies used to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs): (i) Step-by-step reasoning, and (ii) chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Both methods aim to improve the model’s ability to solve complex problems by generating intermediate reasoning steps, but they differ in their approach and implementation. In step-by-step reasoning, the model breaks down complex emotional nuances into sequential logical steps and generates intermediate reasoning steps automatically . This approach often involves integrating external tools, and it has shown substantial improvements over few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought (CoT)   . This approach allows for a detailed analysis of the emotional context, enabling the LLM to discern subtle distinctions between regret and guilt. On the other hand, CoT reasoning is a technique that enables LLMs to articulate a series of intermediate reasoning steps. Unlike Step-by-step reasoning which often integrates external tools and has shown improvements over CoT, CoT prompting guides the model to decompose complex problems into intermediate steps, mimicking an intuitive thought process . This method does not require a large training dataset or modifying the language model’s weights, and it is particularly effective when combined with few-shot prompting to capture intricate emotions  . Furthermore, the exploration of tree-of-thought (ToT) reasoning in LLMs adds another layer of sophistication to emotion-related tasks. By structuring the reasoning process as a tree, the model can allow exploration over coherent units of text and enable deliberate decision-making through considering multiple reasoning paths and the ability to backtrack when necessary . This hierarchical approach aids in capturing the multi-faceted nature of these emotions, allowing for a nuanced and comprehensive classification. Therefore, these methodologies, including CoT, step-by-step reasoning, and ToT, are crucial for understanding and classification of emotions. Table 1 summarizes existing emotion analysis models along with their respective datasets. Though a wide variety of emotion-related datasets are available. The majority of them are limited to Ekman  and Plutchik’s emotions . Whereas, the current datasets and approaches used to classify regret and guilt exhibit a limited understanding of regret and guilt and overlap several emotions that are distinct in their expression.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: more sophisticated models were required for emotion analysis.
