      "content": "Paper Title: Probabilistic Forecasting with Coherent Aggregation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nObtaining accurate forecasts is an important step for long-term planning in complex and uncertain environments, with applications ranging from energy management to supply chains, from transportation to climate prediction   .\nGoing beyond point forecasts such as means and medians, probabilistic forecasting provides a key tool for forecasting uncertain future events.\nThis involves, e.g., forecasting that there is a 90% chance of rain on a certain day, or that there is a 99% chance that people will want to buy fewer than 100 items at a certain store on a certain week.\nProviding more detailed predictions of this form permits finer uncertainty quantification.\nThis in turn permits planners to prepare for different scenarios and to allocate resources depending on their anticipated likelihood and cost structure.\nThis can lead to better resource allocation, improved decision making, and less waste. In many applications, there exist natural hierarchies over quantities one wants to forecast:\nenergy consumption at various temporal granularities, from monthly to weekly; or at different geographic granularities, from the building-level to city-level to state-level; or forecasting retail demand for specific items, as well as for categories of items or brands.\nTypically, most or all levels of the hierarchy are important:\nbase-levels of the hierarchy are key for operational short-term planning; and\nhigher levels of aggregation yield insights on longer-term or coarser trends.\nMoreover, it is often desired that the probabilistic forecasts at different granularities are coherent (or consistent) for efficient decision-making at all levels  . To be somewhat more precise, we say that probabilistic forecasts at different granularities in a hierarchy are coherent if and only if there exists a valid joint distribution across all base-levels such that the probabilistic forecasts have the same distributions as the corresponding marginals of the joint distribution   .\nSee also Def. 2.1 below. This follows , and informally it means that the distribution of an aggregate is the sum of the distributions of the base-levels in the aggregate.\nDesigning a model which is accurate at all levels of aggregation of the hierarchy, and which can exploit information at different levels, while also enforcing coherency, is well-known to be a difficult challenge .\nIn particular, one can not simply aggregate or disaggregate probabilistic forecasts independently (assuming, of course, that one wants to achieve reasonable accuracy), without accounting for correlations among base time series. In the last few years, end-to-end trainable neural network models have achieved a measure of success for (multi-horizon) probabilistic forecasting for univariate time series   [ref]2  .\nCompared to previous auto-regressive methods,\nthese models provide additional flexibility: one can now fit quantile functions directly through nonlinear quantile regression   8    (while forbidding quantile crossing 9); and one can differentiate through sampling complex hierarchical graphical models.\nThe added flexibility results in higher forecast accuracy. In addition to multi-horizon univariate time series forecasting problems, targets to be forecasted sometimes lie in a linear subspace of a common multivariate target. This is the case for hierarchical forecasting: there is a linear relationship between base-level series and aggregates  .\nDespite the flexibility of neural network models, we cannot expect the output of these models to learn from the training data to satisfy (these hierarchical, or other) constraints exactly  5.\nRecent work has aimed at enforcing these constraints exactly; and these\nneural networks models have achieved state of the art results for the hierarchical forecasting setup  7 .\nThese end-to-end forecasting models mitigate an important shortcoming of previous (pre-neural network) hierarchical forecasting methods: the need to forecast first, before reconciliating those forecasts in a coherent manner.\nBy exploiting an end-to-end training approach, these methods permit one to train a coherent model in one step: either by integrating the reconciliation as a differentiable module ; or by designing a probabilistic model which enforces the coherence, with distribution parameters given by neural networks 7. In the light of the recent literature, here are properties which a hierarchical forecasting method should satisfy: 1) coherence by construction; 2) end-to-end trainability; 3) ability to optimize for arbitrary sample-based loss functions, e.g., quantile loss, Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS), depending on the use-case; 4) exploitation of the hierarchical structure in the data, leading to a factor model representation; 5) flexibility in the choice of factor and base-level noise distributions that best approximate the data distribution; and 6) compact representation of the forecast to minimize storage cost. In this paper, we present a method which satisfies all of these properties.\nWe are aware of only two previous methods which provide end-to-end trainable, and coherent hierarchical forecasts:  and 7.\nHowever, these two previous methods only satisfy some of the properties stated above.\nSee Table 1 for a summary. In more detail, our main contributions are the following. We propose a a novel model for probabilistic forecasting that satisfies all the desired properties stated above. Our model explicitly leverages exchangeability of the base-level targets using a factor model structure. It can be easily adapted to use different factor and base-level distributions, e.g., Gamma, Normal, Truncated Normal, etc.\nOur model enforces coherent aggregation exactly by construction. The factor model parameters are the output of a neural network.\nWe optimize this neural network directly by optimizing for marginal forecast accuracy, using a reparametrization trick.\nIn addition, depending on the use-case, our model can be used for optimizing arbitrary forecast metrics, such as quantile losses, CRPS, mean squared error, or combinations of them. Due to the importance of coherent forecasts in practice, we evaluate our method empirically by comparing against previous coherent end-to-end trainable methods, namely those of  7 , on three public datasets. Following previous work, we evaluate on the CRPS metric 3, and we find that our method improves on previous methods by 11.811.8\\bf 11.8-41.4%percent41.4\\bf 41.4\\% depending on the dataset. We additionally evaluate our mean forecasts using the relative MSE, and find that our method improves on previous methods by 28.928.9\\bf 28.9-44.1%percent44.1\\bf 44.1\\% on two of three datasets. We analyze CRPS results at different levels of the hierarchy, demonstrating higher or comparable accuracy at all levels on the three datasets. Our model achieves this while providing a more compact forecast representation (an important practical consideration) than previous proposed coherent models. We illustrate the influence of the choice of base-level distributions.\nChanging distributional assumptions, even in seemingly-minor ways, can have a large impact on accuracy, and the best choice often depends sensitively on the data.\nOur model has the flexibility to evaluate different modeling choices quickly and easily.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: base time series.
