      "content": "Paper Title: 1 Introduction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOne popular line of solutions for AD relies on the geometric structure of the data. These include methods such as Local Outlier Factor (LOF) , which locates anomalous data by measuring local deviations between the data point and its neighbors. Another example is using the distance to the kùëòk nearest neighbors (kùëòkNN) to detect anomalies. Several authors have used an AutoEncoder (AE) for this task by modeling anomalies as harder-to-reconstruct samples¬† . Chen et¬†al., 2017a  have improved upon this approach by presenting an ensemble of AE with different dropout connections. Another well-studied paradigm for anomaly detection is one-class classification. Deep One-Class Classification trains a deep neural network to learn a transformation that minimizes the volume of a data-enclosing hypersphere centered on a pre-determined point. Anomalies are detected based on their distance to the hypersphere‚Äôs center. Several works have used self-supervision to improve the classifier‚Äôs power to distinguish between normal and abnormal samples. Examples include 2, which apply affine transformations to non-image datasets and use the likelihood of a contrastive predictor to detect anomalies. Shenkar and Wolf,  presented Internal Contrastive Learning (ICL), which relies on a special masking scheme for learning an informative anomaly score. Density-based anomaly detection is based on the logic that anomalous events happen rarely and\nare unlikely, thus considering an unlikely sample to have a low \"likelihood\", and high probability density for a normal sample. Multiple works are based on this intuition implicitly or explicitly [ref]35,\n,, even in classification    3 or reconstruction [ref]14  based anomaly detection.\nRecently, numerous works pointed out that anomaly detection based on simple density estimation has multiple flaws.\nLe¬†Lan and Dinh,  claimed that methods based on likelihood scoring are unreliable even when provided with a perfect density model of in-distribution data.\nNalisnick et¬†al., 2019b  demonstrated that the regions of high likelihood in a probability distribution may not be associated with regions of high probability, especially as the number of dimensions increases.\nCaterini and Loaiza-Ganem,  focuses on the impact of the entropy term in anomaly detection and suggests looking for lower-entropy representations of data before performing likelihood-based anomaly detection.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: unlikely, thus considering an unlikely sample to have a low \"likelihood\", and high probability density for a normal sample.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
