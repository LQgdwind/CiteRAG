      "content": "Paper Title: Revisiting data augmentation for subspace clustering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the advancements in data acquisition technology, high-dimensional data is widespread in many areas of machine learning and signal processing.\nData clustering plays a vital role in analyzing and understanding high-dimensional data. Many techniques have been proposed for this challenging problem. Their common goal is to aggregate the data into several groups based on a similarity/proximity measure. Among these approaches, subspace clustering (SC) is a prominent clustering approach that groups the data points according to their proximity to underlying latent low-dimensional subspaces . SC relies on the assumption that the data samples are distributed around multiple low-dimensional subspaces, rather than being uniformly spread across the whole ambient space. Let the matrix X∈ℝd×n𝑋superscriptℝ𝑑𝑛X\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times n} consist of n𝑛n samples in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} that are drawn from a union of p𝑝p unknown linear subspaces, {𝒮i}i=1psuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝒮𝑖𝑖1𝑝\\{\\mathcal{S}_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{p}, with unknown dimensions, {dj}j=1psuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑑𝑗𝑗1𝑝\\{d_{j}\\}_{j=1}^{p} where dj≪dmuch-less-thansubscript𝑑𝑗𝑑d_{j}\\ll d for j=1,…,p𝑗1…𝑝j=1,\\dots,p.\nWithout any prior information about the orientation or the distribution of subspaces, the goal is to recover the underlying low-dimensional structures by assigning each sample to a subspace/cluster. In the past two decades, a wide variety of SC approaches have been proposed; see  8    and the references therein.\nAmong the many proposed techniques, the ones that are based on the concept of self-expressive representations are widely accepted to be the current state-of-the-art SC approaches  7 . Self-expressive representations rely on the fact that each sample can be expressed as a linear combination of other samples from the same subspace, that is, X​(:,j)=∑i≠jC​(i,j)​X​(:,i)𝑋:𝑗subscript𝑖𝑗𝐶𝑖𝑗𝑋:𝑖X(:,j)=\\sum_{i\\neq j}C(i,j)X(:,i), where X​(:,j)𝑋:𝑗X(:,j) indicates the j𝑗j-th column of the data matrix X𝑋X, and C​(i,j)𝐶𝑖𝑗C(i,j) is the (i,j)𝑖𝑗(i,j)-th entry of the self-expressive coefficient matrix C∈ℝn×n𝐶superscriptℝ𝑛𝑛C\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}. The nonzero entries in the square matrix C𝐶C indicate a pairwise affinity between the corresponding samples. However, there are typically infinitely many solutions to a self-expressive model, because the number of samples in a low-dimensional subspace is usually larger than its intrinsic dimension. Ideally, the coefficient matrix should respect the subspace preserving property, which requires each sample to be represented by the data points from the same subspace. In other words, the entries in the coefficient vector C​(:,j)𝐶:𝑗C(:,j) that correspond to the samples from different subspaces should be equal to zero.\nSeveral regularization functions are proposed in the literature to enforce the subspace preserving property in self-expressive representations; including the sparsity-inducing ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1} norm , the low-rank promoting nuclear norm 7, and the Forbenius norm .\nOnce the self-expressive coefficient matrix is computed, the samples are clustered by applying the classic spectral clustering algorithm  on the affinity matrix A=|C|+|C⊤|∈ℝn×n𝐴𝐶superscript𝐶topsuperscriptℝ𝑛𝑛A=|C|+|C^{\\top}|\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}. Self-expressive based SC algorithms have been extensively studied from a theoretical standpoint    6 ,\nand have been used successfully in many machine learning applications  [ref]51 .\nHowever, the success of self-expressiveness heavily depends on the existence of well-spread samples in each subspace .\nTo the best of our knowledge, the majority of the literature has overlooked the role of the data distribution within each subspace on the performance of the SC algorithms, and has treated the given data points as a fixed input.\nIn fact, the major focus of most SC approaches is to obtain a higher quality coefficient matrix, that is, strengthening the connections between the data points within each subspace while reducing the wrong connections between the samples from different clusters. This was tackled using different regularizations 9  , post-processing approaches  1 , or proposing more robust techniques  . However, the key role of the distribution of the samples across the subspaces is usually not discussed. In this paper, we focus on the role of the data “quality” and its underlying impact on the “quality” of the coefficient matrix. Inspired by the remarkable influence of data augmentation on the performance and generalization ability of neural networks  , we employ data augmentation to increase the diversity of the data without collecting new samples. In this paper, we propose a general framework to incorporate data augmentation within SC. First, in Section 2, we review the self-expressive based model and the existing algorithms which are the foundations of the proposed models.\nThen, the main contributions are presented in the next sections: In Section 3, we provide a geometric interpretation to illustrate the impact of augmented samples on the performance of SC, with the focus on sparsity regularized SC. In Section 4, we consider unsupervised and semi-supervised SC, and propose a framework for integrating data augmentation within the general optimization model of SC.\nWe first revisit our prior work [ref]3 and generalize it for three representative self-expressive unsupervised SC algorithms.\nWe then adapt it to the semi-supervised setting with a few labeled samples available. Using the labeled samples, we present an auto-augmentation strategy.\nWe also provide a simple practical strategy to improve the scalability of the proposed approaches for large real-world data sets. In Section 5, we illustrate the different properties of the proposed approaches on several numerical experiments, and show their effectiveness compared to the state of the art using several synthetic and real-world data sets. This paper is the extension of our recent conference paper [ref]3 which only considers the unsupervised setting with classic augmentation strategies and only for sparsity regularized SC.\n\nReference markers found: [51]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]51: n}.
