The key result that leads to domain liftability of C2, is the following: Let Œ¶Œ¶\\Phi be a first-order logic sentence and let ŒìŒì\\Gamma be an arbitrary cardinality constraint. Then, wfomc‚Äã(Œ¶‚àßŒì,ùê§)wfomcŒ¶Œìùê§\\mbox{\\sc wfomc}(\\Phi\\land\\Gamma,{\\bm{k}}) can be computed in polynomial time with respect to the domain cardinality, relative to the wfomc‚Äã(Œ¶,ùê§)wfomcŒ¶ùê§\\mbox{\\sc wfomc}(\\Phi,{\\bm{k}}) oracle. In order to prove Theorem 2, the proof in [ref]31 relies on Lagrange interpolation. We provide an easier presentation of the proof in the appendix. In the proof presented in the appendix (and in [ref]31), the first-order definability of Œ¶Œ¶\\Phi is never invoked. This property has also been exploited for imposing cardinality constraints with tree axiom in . Theorem 2 extends domain-liftability of any sentence Œ¶Œ¶\\Phi to its domain-liftability with cardinality constraints. We now move to domain-liftability in C2: The fragment of first-order logic with two variables and counting quantifiers is domain-liftable. The key idea behind Theorem 3 is that WFOMC of a C2 sentence Œ¶Œ¶\\Phi can be converted to a problem of WFOMC of an FO2 sentence Œ¶‚Ä≤superscriptŒ¶‚Ä≤\\Phi^{\\prime} with cardinality constraints ŒìŒì\\Gamma on an extended vocabulary with additional weights for the new predicates (the new predicates are weighted 1 or -1). We refer the reader to [ref]31 and [ref]32 for the detailed treatment of Theorem 3. However, for our purposes it is important to note that this transformation is modular. The modularity of the WFOMC procedure, as presented in [ref]31, has also been exploited to demonstrate domain-liftability of C2 extended with Tree axiom  and Linear Order axiom .\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: [ref]32 and [ref]31 show that WFOMC in C2 can be reduced to WFOMC in FO2 with cardinality constraints.
