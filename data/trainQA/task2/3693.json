      "content": "Paper Title: HetSched: Quality-of-Mission Aware Scheduling for Autonomous Vehicle SoCs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAVs pose a challenge with the need to execute heterogeneous applications within stringent real-time and safety constraints. Prior work proposes the use of heterogeneous SoCs to help meet the performance constraints of individual tasks within the heterogeneous applications [ref]35 . However, during runtime, multiple critical applications and tasks are required to be executed simultaneously within their deadlines . A plethora of work exists on scheduling algorithms for heterogeneous systems. Much of the prominent schedulers focus on optimizing the makespan, i.e. execution time of a single DAG   . Tong et al. use Q-learning along with heterogeneous earliest finish time (HEFT) algorithm from  to reduce the makespan of a DAG . Shetti et al. propose HEFT-NC  to optimize ranking and task selection of HEFT  by considering global and local processor information. However, as these schedulers are not optimized for the real-time requirements of the AVs and are not built for multiple DAG execution, they would need to be operated on AVs running at very low speeds to meet deadlines for all the critical DAGs of the mission. To schedule for a multi-DAG scenario on heterogeneous systems, Xu et al. develop the reverse HEFT scheduling algorithm . However, this algorithm is not feasible for dynamic systems as it requires a priori knowledge of arrival times of all DAGs. Real-time schedulers like earliest deadline first (EDF) and deadline monotonic (DM), in contrast, cater to real-time systems where all tasks have a fixed priority and the criticality of tasks is not considered . However, AVs are categorized as cyber-physical systems and require schedulers that can schedule for mixed criticalities and multiple DAGs . In this regard, Xie et al.  propose two dynamic schedulers; fairness-based dynamic scheduler (FDS_MIMF) and an adaptive dynamic scheduler (ADS_MIMF), to optimize the makespan of the DAGs and to achieve low deadline miss ratio (DMR) by considering safety and criticality of the system values for high-criticality DAGs, respectively. Wu and Ryu , present the best speed fit EDF scheduler that prioritizes tasks according to the earliest deadline and assigns the task to the best possible PE while considering the execution profile of the task, similar to the 2lvl-EDF implementation in this work. However, none of these work consider that meeting real-time deadlines does not translate to safe completion of mission at the least mission time, i.e. while operating the AV at the maximum safe speed. Moreover, use of HEFT-like algorithms for task scheduling on a highly heterogeneous SoC leads to low utilization in slow PEs. HetSched caters to both the requirements of an AV, i.e. to meet real-time deadlines for critical DAGs and reduce overall mission time. Recent work also propose the use of power management systems to help reduce the power and energy consumption of the real-time systemsusing machine learning techniques  . HetSched can work in conjunction with these schedulers to further reduce energy along with the efficient utilization of resources to meet real-time deadlines and power constraints.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: stringent real-time and safety constraints.
