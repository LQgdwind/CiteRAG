These works resulted in two common ways of measuring calibration: reliability diagrams¬† and estimates of the squared expected calibration error (ECE)¬†[ref]40: ùîº‚Äã(f‚Äã(X)‚àíùîº‚Äã[Y‚à£f‚Äã(X)])2ùîºsuperscriptùëìùëãùîºdelimited-[]conditionalùëåùëìùëã2\\smash{\\mathbb{E}(f(X)-\\mathbb{E}\\left[Y\\mid f(X)\\right])^{2}}. Squared ECE can easily be generalized to multiclass settings and some related notions such as absolute deviation ECE and top-label ECE have also been considered, for instance¬†3 . ECE is typically estimated through binning, which provably leads to underestimation of ECE for calibrators with continuous output¬† . Certain methods have been proposed to estimate ECE without binning¬†4 1, but they require distributional assumptions for provability. While these papers have focused on the difficulty of estimating calibration error, ours is the first formal impossibility result for achieving calibration. In particular, Kumar et¬†al. [24, Theorem 4.1] show that the scaling-binning procedure achieves calibration error close to the best within a fixed, regular, injective parametric class. However, as discussed in Section¬†3.3 (after Theorem¬†3), we show that the best predictor in such an injective parametric class is itself not distribution-free calibrated. In summary, our results show not only that (some form of) binning is necessary for distribution-free calibration (Theorem¬†3), but also sufficient (Corollary¬†3). Apart from classical methods for calibration  2 3 , some new methods have been proposed recently, primarily for calibration of deep neural networks¬† 3      0 . These calibration methods perform well in practice but do not have distribution-free guarantees. A calibration framework that generalizes binning and isotonic regression is Venn prediction¬†    ; we briefly discuss this framework and show some connections to our work in Appendix¬†E. Calibration has natural applications in numerous sensitive domains where uncertainty estimation is desirable (healthcare, finance, forecasting). Recently, calibrated classifiers have been used as a part of the pipeline for anomaly detection¬†  and label shift estimation¬†  2.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: The problem of assessing the calibration of binary classifiers was first studied in the meteorological and statistics literature¬† [ref]40        ; we refer the reader to the review by¬†Dawid  for more details.
