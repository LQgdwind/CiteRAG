      "content": "Paper Title: Seeing What You Said: Talking Face Generation Guided by a Lip Reading Expert\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDataset We train the proposed method in the train set (29 hours) of LRS2 and evaluate it with other competitive approaches in the test sets of two publicly available datasets: LRW [ref]44, and LRS2 . LRW is a dataset for audio-visual word classification. Each sample in the LRW contains a video with 29 frames (about 1 second), synchronized audio, and a target word in the middle of the sample. There are 500 different words in the whole dataset. LRS2 is an open-world audio-visual speech recognition dataset. Each sample in it consists of video, audio and target text sequence. There are two subsets for training with a 60k vocabulary: pretrain (195 hours), and train (29 hours). Audio and video sample rates of both datasets are 16 Khz and 25 fps, respectively. Metrics Comparisons are evaluated on the following widely used metrics: PSNR [ref]11, SSIM , LSE-C [ref]13. PSNR and SSIM are metrics to measure visual quality, which are calculated by comparing generated images with ground truth. LSE-C is proposed in  to quantify lip-speech synchronization through a pre-trained sync-net . The higher their scores, the better their performances. Additionally, we propose a new strategy to evaluate reading intelligibility, including the Word Error Rate (WER) of synthesized video on LRS2, and the Word Accuracy (ACC) on the unseen dataset LRW.\nTo evaluate the WER, we employ the AV-Hubert (large) , which achieves SOTA performance on the lip-reading task. We fine-tune it on the whole LRS2 dataset as one lip-reading observer. Its performance on the test set of LRS2 is 23.82% WER. Note that the lip-reading expert in our proposed method is different from the lip-reading observer since the lip-reading expert is AV-Hubert (base).\nBesides, To further increase the difference between lip-reading expert and observer, a lip-reading network adopting Conformer   serves as another lip-reading observer. We run Conformer in teacher-forcing mode  to calculate WER. In other words, ground truth text is involved in inference. For measuring ACC on LRW, we choose MVM , whose prediction accuracy on LRW is 88.5%. Comparison methods Five SOTA methods of talking face generation are used to compare: ATVGnet , Wav2Lip , Faceformer , PC-AVS [ref]13, SyncTalkFace [ref]11. ATVGnet belongs to the intermediate representation-based method, which first predicts a face landmark and then generates a realistic image. Wav2Lip is a representative of reconstruction methods and claims SOTA performance in lip sync synchronization. Faceformer represents an emerging manner, namely sequence-to-sequence manner, which employs a transformer to take the whole audio and output a video sequence. Originally, in , this method is applied to generate a vertex sequence (3D scan data) from an audio sequence. It does not work if we simply replace the vertex sequence by the image sequence. Thus, we adopt the video encoder and corresponding visual input to replace the style encoder in  and add a skip connection between the visual input and the output image. PC-AVS is also a reconstruction method, which disentangles identity, speech content, and poses. SyncTalkFace addresses lip-speech synchronization via a memory network. The last two methods do not publicly share their code or training code. Thus, their performances are collected from [ref]11. Implementation details Below preprocessing is applied on raw audio and videos. Following Wav2Lip , we detect faces on each image as  Region of interest (ROI) and then crop and resize the ROI to 96Ã—\\times96. Audio wavforms are preprocessed to mel-spectrogram with hop and window lengths, and mel bins are 12.5 ms, 50 ms, and 80. We only fine-tune the last 3 transformer blocks of the pre-trained transformer audio encoder during the TFG training. The detailed architectures of our method can be found in the supplementary. During inference, we always use the first image of a video as the identity reference.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: Dataset We train the proposed method in the train set (29 hours) of LRS2 and evaluate it with other competitive approaches in the test sets of two publicly available datasets: LRW [ref]44, and LRS2 .
