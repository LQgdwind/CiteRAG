      "content": "Paper Title: RC-RNN: Reconfigurable Cache Architecture for Storage Systems Using Recurrent Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are numerous studies in SSD-based caching for storage systems       [ref]10 . Most of these studies suggest simple and linear caching algorithms based on conventional algorithms such as Least Recently Used (LRU) or Access Frequency that have shown to be practical and efficient in other levels of memory hierarchy such as CPU caches. Although LRU has low overhead, certain workloads can cause cache thrashing   and significantly decrease its efficiency. Previous studies that use LRU as their baseline caching algorithm tried to overcome this problem with various approaches. ARC  employs two lists to keep track of recency and frequency of accessed I/O blocks. It buffers a percentage of each list based on the hit ratio in the recent accesses and keeps balance between blocks that have been accessed recently and blocks, which have been mostly accessed during the workload. LARC  employs a virtual LRU queue as a filter for recently accessed blocks and prevents randomly accessed blocks from entering cache in the first access. If a block is accessed for the second time while in filter, it gets promoted to the main LRU and will be buffered. With this approach, LARC prevents cache thrashing and significantly decreases cache replacements compared to LRU. mARC  benefits from both previous architectures in different phases of the workload. It uses hit ratio, recency, and frequency as feedback to switch between two methods. Although the mentioned studies have improved SSD caching performance in few workloads, they still have low performance in other workload types. In addition, the number of unnecessary cache replacements is still high in such architectures. In addition to modifying LRU, using access frequency has also been suggested in the previous studies  . In , a caching architecture called Azor is suggested, which is an access frequency cache that assigns metadata blocks a higher priority over data blocks. This architecture will be effective only for workloads with high percentage of metadata accesses. In case of workload change, older metadata blocks, which are not performance critical anymore, will be kept in cache and prevent performance critical pages from entering the cache. Hystor  proposes a hybrid storage architecture consists of both SSD and HDD to improve the overall performance. One of the drawbacks of hystor is allocating a fixed section of SSD as a writeback buffer for HDD subsystem, which can be either too large or too small for certain workloads. The size of the write-back cache significantly affects the performance of running workloads.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: There are numerous studies in SSD-based caching for storage systems       [ref]10 .
