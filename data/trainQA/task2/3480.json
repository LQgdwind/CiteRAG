A common approach  [ref]2  to provide personalized recommendation is through analyzing user profile and his behavior to match his mostly interested items. However, user profile may not be available in many practical situations, for example, a user browsing items without logging. The task of session-based recommendation (SBR) is hence proposed for such situations, which has attracted widespread attentions recently . According to  [ref]6 , the SBR task can be defined as follows: Let V={vi|i=1,2,…,N}𝑉conditional-setsubscript𝑣𝑖𝑖12…𝑁V=\\{v_{i}|i=1,2,...,N\\} denote the set of all unique items, where N𝑁N is the total number of items. A session is a chronological sequence of clicked items for an anonymous user, which can be represented as S={v1,v2,…,vτ}𝑆subscript𝑣1subscript𝑣2…subscript𝑣𝜏S=\\{v_{1},v_{2},...,v_{\\tau}\\}, where vi∈Vsubscript𝑣𝑖𝑉v_{i}\\in V in the session is the i𝑖i-th item clicked by the user and τ𝜏\\tau is the session length. The SBR task is to predict the next item to be clicked for an ongoing session, i.e. vτ+1subscript𝑣𝜏1v_{\\tau+1} for session S𝑆S. A SBR recommendation model predicts the preference scores for all candidate items in V𝑉V, i.e. 𝐲^={y^1,y^2,…,y^N}^𝐲subscript^𝑦1subscript^𝑦2…subscript^𝑦𝑁\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}=\\{\\hat{y}_{1},\\hat{y}_{2},...,\\hat{y}_{N}\\}, and constructs a top-K𝐾K recommendation list by selecting K𝐾K items with highest preference scores. The challenges of SBR lies in two aspects: (1) Sessions are anonymous and items are recorded with only their identifiers (ID), which makes it impossible to establish users’ profiles nor to analyze items’ features; (2) Sessions are often short, which makes it difficult to capture transitional logics in sessions, not even mention that items often have no attribution information. Early approaches have mainly relied on some simple popularity rules  or matrix factorization  for predicting the next item, which have not well encoded items’ representations, nor utilizing items’ sequential relations in sessions . Recently, for their powerful capabilities of representation learning, many neural networks have been designed and applied for the SBR task. Some neural network-based methods  [ref]6 0 1 2 3 have achieved significant improvements over traditional approaches. The core idea is to design a neural network model for encoding items’ representations and learning the ongoing session representation, such that the next item is selected with its representation the most similar to that the session representation, e.g., using a cosine or dot product similarity function. Some of neural models 0 1 have further considered the collaborative information between multiple sessions to enhance the session representation learning. However, they lack the exploration of potential relations in between items from multiple sessions. Some graph-based models propose to first construct an item graph for item embedding learning and session representation learning  4 5 6 7 8 9  . As many items’ transitions are extracted from multiple sessions, it is expected that more useful transitional information can be encoded in items’ embeddings via, say for example, a graph neural network (GNN). We approve the effectiveness of item graph construction, as it has two advantages: One is to alleviate the issue of item sparsity in individual sessions; The other is to transfer the problem of mining item inter-relations as exploring structural characteristics of a graph. Some well-known GNNs, including graph convolution network (GCN) , graph attention network (GAT) , LightGCN , have been adopted for learning item embedding mainly from the viewpoint of item co-occurrences in the graph by capturing node-centric local structural characteristics. Although these GNNs can encode graph structural characteristics, they may not be much suitable for item embedding learning in the SBR task. The items contained in anonymous sessions are only equipped with their identifiers (ID). On the one hand, items’ embeddings are often randomly initialized. On the other hand, the objective of such ID-based embedding learning is to ensure a kind of neighborhood affinity by capturing items’ co-occurrences as their topological relations on the item graph. We refer the neighborhood affinity to indicate the condition that a node embedding is closer to its neighbors’ than its non-neighbors’ in the embedding space. Some GNNs, like the GCN and GAT, employ a kind of global transformation kernel to update items’ initial embeddings. Although they can capture local structural characteristics, such global transformation may not ensure the neighborhood affinity in the original item embedding space, not to mention introducing additional trainable parameters for embedding space transformation. The LightGCN, though without a global transformation, the aggregation computation simply updates a node embedding via averaging its neighbors’, yet not including the node itself embedding in the update process. In this paper, we propose a new graph spring network (GSN) for learning item embedding on an item graph. The basic idea of GSN is to ensure the neighborhood affinity in the embedding space by aggregating the neighbors’ information to a node through a series of current optimal aggregation weights in an iterative way. Compared with the GCN and GAT, it does not employ some global transformation kernel, so without involving additional trainable parameters. Compared with the LightGCN, its aggregation weights computation directly depends on item embeddings, rather than simple graph Laplacian matrix. We can stack multiple GSN layers to include high-order neighbors for learning item embedding, however it still may not be enough to encode possible relations for two item nodes far-apart in the item graph. Indeed, the item graph only establishes edges of co-appeared items in sessions. It could be the case that some items have not co-appeared in sessions, but they may share some similar latent features, say for example categorical features. This resembles the case of two nodes far-apart in the item graph but containing similar latent features, which motivates us to further encode some global topological signals for each item. In this paper, we propose to first select some informative items (called anchors) and then encode potential relations to these anchors. In this paper, we proposed a GSN-IAS model (Graph Spring Network and Informative Anchor Selection) for the SBR task. An item graph is first constructed for describing items’ co-occurrences in all sessions. We design the GSN for item embedding learning based on the item graph, and analyze its convergence property. We propose a measure, called item entropy, to select informative anchors only based on their statistics in sessions. We next design an unsupervised learning mechanism to output items’ encodings, which is to encode items’ potential relations to anchors. Based on item embedding and item encoding, we employ a shared gated recurrent unit (GRU) network to learn two session representations and output two next item predictions. Finally, we design an adaptive decision fusion strategy to fuse the two predictions to output final preference scores for recommendation list construction. Extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets validate that our GSN-IAS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods . Our main contributions can be summarized as follows: Propose a new graph neural network (GSN) for item embedding learning. Provide a proof on the GSN convergence. Define item entropy for informative anchor selection. Propose an unsupervised method for anchor-based item encoding learning. Propose a parameters shared GRU for two session representations and two next item predictions. Propose an adaptive decision fusion to fuse two predictions for final recommendation. The rest is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the related work. Section 3 presents our GSN-IAS model. Experiment settings are provided in Section 4 and results are analyzed in Section 5.
