      "content": "Paper Title: Dual Forgetting Operators in the Context of Weakest Sufficient and Strongest Necessary Conditions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStandard forgetting, 𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡\\mathit{forget}(), has been introduced in the foundational paper , where model theoretical definitions and analysis of properties of the standard 𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡\\mathit{forget}() operator are provided. Its second-order characterization as well as its entailment preserving property, as quoted in Theorem 2.1 above, are consequences of this definition. The paper  opened a research subarea, summarized, e.g., in  or more recently, in . In the approach used in the current paper, one begins with an entailment-based, inferential perspective, as expressed by (10) and (11). This is directly beneficial for pragmatic application, since this approach leads directly to algorithms and implementations of the dual forgetting operators. In addition to introducing a new weak forgetting operator, standard forgetting is also characterized in this context. The paper  concentrates on introspective forgetting (“forgetting as becoming\nignorant”). It extends modal epistemic logic with modal operators allowing one to express what is known before and what remains known after forgetting. It therefore essentially deals with necessary conditions, corresponding to standard forgetting. In  two types of forgetting are distinguished: (1) forgetting part of the signature, corresponding to standard forgetting, and (2) forgetting a formula, related to contracting in the AGM theory of belief change  . In the current paper, both dual operators, weak and strong forgetting, belong to the first type of forgetting. The extension of this work to forgetting formulas is an interesting research direction. A general framework, covering a range of belief changes involving forgetting, is proposed in . In particular, a commonsense perspective based on belief change, involving contraction, ignorance introduction, revision/update, (deductive) abstraction at the level of rules, marginalization, etc., is proposed. Another general framework for standard-like forgetting is investigated in , where forgetting is regarded as a belief change operator, independent of the underlying logic. Forgetting is achieved by reducing a part of a signature in a theory. In that approach, forgetting is specified by the set of logical consequences of the input theory over the reduced language. Though providing very interesting characterizations and contexts of forgetting, the frameworks of  and  deal with consequences (necessary conditions) of the considered theories and do not deal with sufficient conditions, expressed by the weak forgetting operator in this paper. Papers which consider relations between forgetting and weakest sufficient and strongest necessary conditions include  . In the first of these papers, forgetting is applied in the context of strongest necessary and weakest sufficient conditions in Computation Tree Logic (CTL). Axiomatic characterization of forgetting and an algorithm for computing forgetting are provided. In addition, weakest sufficient and strongest necessary conditions are characterized using forgetting (Theorem 9 in ). The characterization is similar in spirit to the Corollaries (49) and (50) in the current paper. In  the results of  are transferred into the context of μ𝜇\\mu-calculus. Both in CTL and μ𝜇\\mu-calculus, typical reasoning problems are intractable. Forgetting in multiagent modal logics, sharing a similar methodology, has been addressed in . Unlike in   , in the current paper, both standard and weak forgetting are considered. The approach isolates broad classes of formulas for which one can compute first-order or fixpoint equivalents of both forgetting operators. This in turn, leads to a tractable reasoning-by-querying machinery. In 2 a weak forgetting operator has been introduced which differs from the weak forgetting operator, FS​C​()superscript𝐹𝑆𝐶F^{SC}\\big{(}\\big{)}, used in this paper, and it has characteristics much more related to the standard forgetting operator, FN​C​()superscript𝐹𝑁𝐶F^{NC}\\big{(}\\big{)}. While standard forgetting is not always first-order expressible, the weak operator of 2 has been developed to make sure that the result of forgetting can always be expressed in first-order logic. Weak forgetting in the sense of 2 and standard forgetting differ only in the cases where the result of standard forgetting is not first-order expressible. This operator does not coincide with the dual weak forgetting operator FS​C​()superscript𝐹𝑆𝐶F^{SC}\\big{(}\\big{)}. The terminology used in the current paper, reflects the fact that FS​C​()superscript𝐹𝑆𝐶F^{SC}\\big{(}\\big{)} and FN​C​()superscript𝐹𝑁𝐶F^{NC}\\big{(}\\big{)} are dual operators that formally show the relationship of FS​C​()superscript𝐹𝑆𝐶F^{SC}\\big{(}\\big{)} to weakest sufficient conditions and FN​C​()superscript𝐹𝑁𝐶F^{NC}\\big{(}\\big{)} to strongest necessary conditions. A series of papers   3 (see also references there) has addressed forgetting in description logics. Though description logics are strongly related to modal logics , the papers   3 are methodologically closer to the approach used in this paper. In , forgetting-based abduction is investigated using weakest sufficient and strongest necessary conditions. The idea, inspired by , is implemented and experimentally verified using resolution. As in the approach proposed in the current paper, the papers  3 use the Ackermann  and fixpoint 8 Lemmas, adjusted to the description logic formalism. Though directly dealing with abduction, the approaches in   3 concentrate on (valuable and important) experimental research and do not separate the weak forgetting operator from the standard forgetting operator. Forgetting in description logics has also been addressed in 7 via uniform interpolants, where mixed model-theoretic and automata-theoretic approaches are applied. It is shown that computing uniform interpolants in the context of the description logics considered, is generally highly intractable. Forgetting is particularly useful in rule-based languages, when one simplifies a belief base to improve querying performance, or protect its parts 0 0 1. This is especially useful for Answer Set Programs, where the corresponding entailment tasks, centering around necessary conditions, are typically intractable. In 0 semantic forgetting is proposed. It preserves skeptical and credulous consequences on unforgotten variables, as well as strong equivalence of ASP programs. It is shown that computing the forgetting result is intractable even for Horn logic programs. The paper 0, provides a comprehensive survey of the area as pertains to Answer Set Programs. In summary, while the topic of forgetting in knowledge representation has gained considerable attention with numerous publications, the dual weak forgetting operator which is proposed and investigated in this paper, has not been explicitly considered in the literature. Additionally, the fundamental principles of forgetting founded on the entailment-based, inferential perspective, which is the starting point of this paper, is somewhat unique in comparison to other papers, where theoretical results are a consequence of model-theoretical, or other considerations. This perspective, which results in entailment preservation on a respective sublanguage, naturally leads to the consideration of both standard and weak forgetting operators. Second-order quantifier elimination is used in this paper as the main logical tool for computing propositional, first-order and fixpoint equivalents of both standard and weak forgetting operators. Although there are several alternative techniques that could be used (see, e.g., [ref]19), Ackermann-like approaches have been selected for their expressive power and pragmatic application. Combining Ackermann-like lemmas with tautology-preserving formula transformations, as exhibited in this paper, has been shown to be very powerful and useful in many different contexts, including that of computing dual forgetting operators. In particular, as shown in , the Dls algorithm subsumes most other known techniques that have been developed for computing circumscription. The paper , shows that the Dls algorithm covers all Sahlqvist formulas, an important class of formulas used in modal correspondence theory. The fixpoint lemma of 8, has been used originally for application to modal correspondence theory. This in turn has led to the development of the Dls* algorithm for fixpoint computations, which has been used for computing various forms of domain circumscription . Both the Dls and Dls* algorithms have been shown to be useful in computing weakest sufficient and strongest necessary conditions .\nThe previously mentioned works   3, in addition to other papers by these authors, have shown that Ackermann-like techniques are also powerful tools for computing forgetting in description logics. The experimental results of these papers also show that such approaches are very efficient and applicable to real-world problems. For other uses of Ackermann-like approaches, including use of the Dls and Dls* algorithms, see [ref]19.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: for computing propositional, first-order and fixpoint equivalents of both standard and weak forgetting operators.
