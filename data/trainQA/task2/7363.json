However, before coming to the actual statement of the Theorem 1, it is worth recapping the general context.\nLet p∈ℕ𝑝ℕp\\in\\mathbb{N}, p≥1𝑝1p\\geq 1, Ω=(0,1)Ω01\\Omega=(0,1) and Θ=[−1,1]pΘsuperscript11𝑝\\Theta=[-1,1]^{p}.

DL-ROMs aim at approximating the map where u𝝁:=𝒢​(𝝁)assignsubscript𝑢𝝁𝒢𝝁u_{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}:=\\mathcal{G}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}) is the solution to some parametrized PDE, with 𝒢:Θ→Hs​(Ω):𝒢→Θsuperscript𝐻𝑠Ω\\mathcal{G}:\\Theta\\to H^{s}(\\Omega) taking values in a suitable Sobolev space, s≥1.𝑠1s\\geq 1. In the DL-ROM paradigm, such approximation is provided by a neural network architecture obtained via the composition of a reduced module, ϕ:ℝp→ℝm:italic-ϕ→superscriptℝ𝑝superscriptℝ𝑚\\phi:\\mathbb{R}^{p}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{m}, and a decoder module, Ψ:ℝm→ℝNh:Ψ→superscriptℝ𝑚superscriptℝsubscript𝑁ℎ\\Psi:\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{N_{h}}. During training, these architectures are supplemented by an auxiliary encoder module, Ψ′:ℝNh→ℝm:superscriptΨ′→superscriptℝsubscript𝑁ℎsuperscriptℝ𝑚\\Psi^{\\prime}:\\mathbb{R}^{N_{h}}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{m}, which effectively turns the intermediate state space, ℝmsuperscriptℝ𝑚\\mathbb{R}^{m}, onto a latent space. In fact, the idea is that while, at the same time, ϕ​(𝝁)≈Ψ′​([u𝝁​(x1),…,u𝝁​(xNh)]⊤).italic-ϕ𝝁superscriptΨ′superscriptsubscript𝑢𝝁subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑢𝝁subscript𝑥subscript𝑁ℎtop\\phi(\\boldsymbol{\\mu})\\approx\\Psi^{\\prime}([u_{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}(x_{1}),\\dots,u_{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}(x_{N_{h}})]^{\\top}).\n\nRecently, the theory underlying DL-ROMs has evolved significantly, see, e.g. [ref]8  [ref]18 [ref]19. However, practical insights on the implementation and training of these architectures are far from being exhaustive. For this reason, domain practitioners often rely on suitable rules of thumb, deduced from empirical evidence. Some of these include: in practice, althought certain studies suggest otherwise , ReLU networks are particularly expressive compared to other architectures that rely on different nonlinearities, such as the sigmoidal activation . Thus, the ReLU activation can be a good choice when constructing DL-ROMs; convolutional layers can significantly enhance the performances of the decoder module. In fact, given the high dimensionality of the output, classical layers would be prohibitive to train  ; the number of convolutional layers in the decoder module should be proportional to the resolution of the spatial grid [ref]18; the encoder block does not need to be as complex as the decoder, nor it benefits as much from the use of convolutional layers [ref]19; ideally, it should be possible to use the same autoencoder for different problems simultaneously  , without the need for re-training (a practice also known as transfer learning). In fact, classical compression techniques based on, e.g., Fourier transform, or wavelets, are somewhat universal. Similarly, we should be able to find problem-agnostic autoencoders that do not require a specific training routine; the reduced map should be trained by taking the encoder outputs as a ground truth reference, i.e., by minimizing where {𝝁i}i=1N⊂Θsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝝁𝑖𝑖1𝑁Θ\\{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{N}\\subset\\Theta is an independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) random sample, generated according to ϱitalic-ϱ\\varrho; to avoid overfitting and ensure a proper generalization, DL-ROMs can benefit from suitable regularization strategies , especially at the latent level ; As we shall see in a moment, by embedding convolutional neural networks within the novel framework of practical existence theorems, we can finally derive a comprehensive theory supporting these heuristics. We report our main result, Theorem 1, right below. For the sake of better readability, the proof is postponed to Section 4. There are universal constants c0,c1,c2,c3,c4>0subscript𝑐0subscript𝑐1subscript𝑐2subscript𝑐3subscript𝑐40c_{0},c_{1},c_{2},c_{3},c_{4}>0 such that the following holds.\nLet p∈ℕ𝑝ℕp\\in\\mathbb{N}, p≥1𝑝1p\\geq 1, and ϵ,γ>0italic-ϵ𝛾0\\epsilon,\\gamma>0. Let ϱitalic-ϱ\\varrho be the uniform probability distribution over Θ:=[−1,1]passignΘsuperscript11𝑝\\Theta:=[-1,1]^{p}.

Fix a training size N≥1𝑁1N\\geq 1 and a probability of failure 0<ε<1.0𝜀10<\\varepsilon<1. Define Let {xj}j=1Nh⊂Ω¯superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑥𝑗𝑗1subscript𝑁ℎ¯Ω\\{x_{j}\\}_{j=1}^{N_{h}}\\subset\\overline{\\Omega} be an equispaced grid of stepsize h=2−kℎsuperscript2𝑘h=2^{-k} for some k∈ℕ𝑘ℕk\\in\\mathbb{N}. Fix a latent dimension m≥1𝑚1m\\geq 1 and let m~:=2​m+1assign~𝑚2𝑚1\\tilde{m}:=2m+1. Then, there exist a class of ReLU networks ℱℱ\\mathscr{F} from ℝp→ℝm~→superscriptℝ𝑝superscriptℝ~𝑚\\mathbb{R}^{p}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{\\tilde{m}} with a latent regularization function ℛ:ℱ→[0,+∞):ℛ→ℱ0\\mathcal{R}:\\mathscr{F}\\to[0,+\\infty), equivalent to a certain norm of the trainable parameters, and a regularization parameter λ=λ​(N~,p)𝜆𝜆~𝑁𝑝\\lambda=\\lambda(\\tilde{N},p), a ReLU convolutional neural network, Ψ:ℝm~→ℝNh:Ψ→superscriptℝ~𝑚superscriptℝsubscript𝑁ℎ\\Psi:\\mathbb{R}^{\\tilde{m}}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{N_{h}}, whose architecture only depends on m𝑚m and s𝑠s, with acting as a decoder, a ReLU network, Ψ′:ℝNh→ℝm~:superscriptΨ′→superscriptℝsubscript𝑁ℎsuperscriptℝ~𝑚\\Psi^{\\prime}:\\mathbb{R}^{N_{h}}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{\\tilde{m}}, whose architecture only depends on m𝑚m and s𝑠s, operating as an encoder, such that the following holds with probability 1−ε1𝜀1-\\varepsilon. Let {𝛍i}i=1Nsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝛍𝑖𝑖1𝑁\\{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{N} be an i.i.d. random sample, uniformly drawn from the parameter space ΘΘ\\Theta.

Every minimizer ϕ^∈ℱ^italic-ϕℱ\\hat{\\phi}\\in\\mathscr{F} of satisfies for all N~≥N0~𝑁subscript𝑁0\\tilde{N}\\geq N_{0}, where N0=N0​(ϵ,𝒢,m,p,s)subscript𝑁0subscript𝑁0italic-ϵ𝒢𝑚𝑝𝑠N_{0}=N_{0}(\\epsilon,\\mathcal{G},m,p,s) and ℰ𝛒subscriptℰ𝛒\\mathcal{E}_{\\boldsymbol{\\rho}} is as in Definition 3. Theorem 1 has multiple implications. First of all, it shows clearly how the different properties of the problem affect the design of the neural network architectures. For instance, the complexity of the decoder, both in terms of depth and size, scales logarithmically with the grid resolution, hℎh. In contrast, the reduced network, ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi, does not depend on hℎh, but on p𝑝p. Notably, thanks to the regularity of the parameter-to-solution map, the reduced network is only mildly affected by the curse-of-dimensionality: its size grows at most quadratically in p𝑝p. Another interesting fact concerns the latent dimension, m𝑚m, which directly appears in the error bound (4). On the hand, increasing m𝑚m can improve the accuracy of the model (at a rate that depends on the smoothness of the PDE solutions, s𝑠s). However, in order to generalize properly, DL-ROMs with a larger latent space necessitate of more training data, as clearly depicted by the term m​exp⁡(−N~1/(2​p)/2)𝑚superscript~𝑁12𝑝2\\sqrt{m}\\exp(-\\tilde{N}^{1/(2p)}/\\sqrt{2}). In general, Theorem 1 shows that the error of a trained DL-ROM can be bounded by two terms: a sampling error, which—asymptotically—decays exponentially with respect to the training set size, and an approximation error, driven by the architecture design and the output smoothness. Interestingly, our result confirms most of the heuristics adopted by domain practitioners: from the use of ReLU networks and convolutional autoencoders, to the introduction of latent regularization techniques. On this note, we also observe that Theorem 1 implicitly supports the use of transfer learning. In fact, our result suggests that, for a fixed degree of smoothness, there exists a universal autoencoder performing equivalently well for all operators 𝒢𝒢\\mathcal{G} (up to a norm factor). In practice, such autoencoder could be initialized and trained a priori, by relying on synthetic data.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: the theory underlying DL-ROMs has evolved significantly, see, e.g. [ref]8  [ref]18 [ref]19.
