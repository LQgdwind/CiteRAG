However, before coming to the actual statement of the Theorem¬†1, it is worth recapping the general context.\nLet p‚àà‚Ñïùëù‚Ñïp\\in\\mathbb{N}, p‚â•1ùëù1p\\geq 1, Œ©=(0,1)Œ©01\\Omega=(0,1) and Œò=[‚àí1,1]pŒòsuperscript11ùëù\\Theta=[-1,1]^{p}.

DL-ROMs aim at approximating the map where uùùÅ:=ùí¢‚Äã(ùùÅ)assignsubscriptùë¢ùùÅùí¢ùùÅu_{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}:=\\mathcal{G}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}) is the solution to some parametrized PDE, with ùí¢:Œò‚ÜíHs‚Äã(Œ©):ùí¢‚ÜíŒòsuperscriptùêªùë†Œ©\\mathcal{G}:\\Theta\\to H^{s}(\\Omega) taking values in a suitable Sobolev space, s‚â•1.ùë†1s\\geq 1. In the DL-ROM paradigm, such approximation is provided by a neural network architecture obtained via the composition of a reduced module, œï:‚Ñùp‚Üí‚Ñùm:italic-œï‚Üísuperscript‚Ñùùëùsuperscript‚Ñùùëö\\phi:\\mathbb{R}^{p}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{m}, and a decoder module, Œ®:‚Ñùm‚Üí‚ÑùNh:Œ®‚Üísuperscript‚Ñùùëösuperscript‚ÑùsubscriptùëÅ‚Ñé\\Psi:\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{N_{h}}. During training, these architectures are supplemented by an auxiliary encoder module, Œ®‚Ä≤:‚ÑùNh‚Üí‚Ñùm:superscriptŒ®‚Ä≤‚Üísuperscript‚ÑùsubscriptùëÅ‚Ñésuperscript‚Ñùùëö\\Psi^{\\prime}:\\mathbb{R}^{N_{h}}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{m}, which effectively turns the intermediate state space, ‚Ñùmsuperscript‚Ñùùëö\\mathbb{R}^{m}, onto a latent space. In fact, the idea is that while, at the same time, œï‚Äã(ùùÅ)‚âàŒ®‚Ä≤‚Äã([uùùÅ‚Äã(x1),‚Ä¶,uùùÅ‚Äã(xNh)]‚ä§).italic-œïùùÅsuperscriptŒ®‚Ä≤superscriptsubscriptùë¢ùùÅsubscriptùë•1‚Ä¶subscriptùë¢ùùÅsubscriptùë•subscriptùëÅ‚Ñétop\\phi(\\boldsymbol{\\mu})\\approx\\Psi^{\\prime}([u_{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}(x_{1}),\\dots,u_{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}(x_{N_{h}})]^{\\top}).\n\nRecently, the theory underlying DL-ROMs has evolved significantly, see, e.g. [ref]8  [ref]18 [ref]19. However, practical insights on the implementation and training of these architectures are far from being exhaustive. For this reason, domain practitioners often rely on suitable rules of thumb, deduced from empirical evidence. Some of these include: in practice, althought certain studies suggest otherwise , ReLU networks are particularly expressive compared to other architectures that rely on different nonlinearities, such as the sigmoidal activation . Thus, the ReLU activation can be a good choice when constructing DL-ROMs; convolutional layers can significantly enhance the performances of the decoder module. In fact, given the high dimensionality of the output, classical layers would be prohibitive to train  ; the number of convolutional layers in the decoder module should be proportional to the resolution of the spatial grid [ref]18; the encoder block does not need to be as complex as the decoder, nor it benefits as much from the use of convolutional layers [ref]19; ideally, it should be possible to use the same autoencoder for different problems simultaneously  , without the need for re-training (a practice also known as transfer learning). In fact, classical compression techniques based on, e.g., Fourier transform, or wavelets, are somewhat universal. Similarly, we should be able to find problem-agnostic autoencoders that do not require a specific training routine; the reduced map should be trained by taking the encoder outputs as a ground truth reference, i.e., by minimizing where {ùùÅi}i=1N‚äÇŒòsuperscriptsubscriptsubscriptùùÅùëñùëñ1ùëÅŒò\\{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{N}\\subset\\Theta is an independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) random sample, generated according to œ±italic-œ±\\varrho; to avoid overfitting and ensure a proper generalization, DL-ROMs can benefit from suitable regularization strategies , especially at the latent level ; As we shall see in a moment, by embedding convolutional neural networks within the novel framework of practical existence theorems, we can finally derive a comprehensive theory supporting these heuristics. We report our main result, Theorem 1, right below. For the sake of better readability, the proof is postponed to Section 4.

Theorem¬†1 has multiple implications. First of all, it shows clearly how the different properties of the problem affect the design of the neural network architectures. For instance, the complexity of the decoder, both in terms of depth and size, scales logarithmically with the grid resolution, h‚Ñéh. In contrast, the reduced network, œïitalic-œï\\phi, does not depend on h‚Ñéh, but on pùëùp. Notably, thanks to the regularity of the parameter-to-solution map, the reduced network is only mildly affected by the curse-of-dimensionality: its size grows at most quadratically in pùëùp. Another interesting fact concerns the latent dimension, mùëöm, which directly appears in the error bound (4). On the hand, increasing mùëöm can improve the accuracy of the model (at a rate that depends on the smoothness of the PDE solutions, sùë†s). However, in order to generalize properly, DL-ROMs with a larger latent space necessitate of more training data, as clearly depicted by the term m‚Äãexp‚Å°(‚àíN~1/(2‚Äãp)/2)ùëösuperscript~ùëÅ12ùëù2\\sqrt{m}\\exp(-\\tilde{N}^{1/(2p)}/\\sqrt{2}). In general, Theorem¬†1 shows that the error of a trained DL-ROM can be bounded by two terms: a sampling error, which‚Äîasymptotically‚Äîdecays exponentially with respect to the training set size, and an approximation error, driven by the architecture design and the output smoothness. Interestingly, our result confirms most of the heuristics adopted by domain practitioners: from the use of ReLU networks and convolutional autoencoders, to the introduction of latent regularization techniques. On this note, we also observe that Theorem¬†1 implicitly supports the use of transfer learning. In fact, our result suggests that, for a fixed degree of smoothness, there exists a universal autoencoder performing equivalently well for all operators ùí¢ùí¢\\mathcal{G} (up to a norm factor). In practice, such autoencoder could be initialized and trained a priori, by relying on synthetic data.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: the theory underlying DL-ROMs has evolved significantly, see, e.g. [ref]8  [ref]18 [ref]19.
