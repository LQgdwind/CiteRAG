      "content": "Paper Title: Complex matrix inversion via real matrix inversions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe will first show that Frobenius inversion works over any quadratic field extension, with ℂℂ\\mathbb{C} over ℝℝ\\mathbb{R} a special case. More importantly, we will show that Frobenius inversion is optimal over any quadratic field extension in that it requires a minimal number of matrix multiplications, inversions, and additions (Theorem 2.5). The reason for the generality in this section is to show that Frobenius inversion can be useful beyond numerical analysis, applying to matrix inversions in computational number theory  , computer algebra  , cryptography  , and finite fields   as well. This section covers the symbolic computing aspects of Frobenius inversion, i.e., in exact arithmetic. Issues related to the numerical computing aspects, i.e., in floating-point arithmetic, including conditioning, positive definiteness, etc, will be treated in Sections 3–5. Recall that a field 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} is said to be a field extension of another field 𝕜𝕜\\Bbbk if 𝕜⊆𝔽𝕜𝔽\\Bbbk\\subseteq\\mathbb{F}. In this case, 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} is automatically a 𝕜𝕜\\Bbbk-vector space. The dimension of 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} as a 𝕜𝕜\\Bbbk-vector space is called the degree of 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} over 𝕜𝕜\\Bbbk and denoted [𝔽:𝕜]delimited-[]:𝔽𝕜[\\mathbb{F}:\\Bbbk] . A degree-two extension is also called a quadratic extension and they are among the most important field extensions. For example, in number theory, two of the biggest achievements in the last decade were the generalizations of Andrew Wiles’ celebrated work to real quadratic fields  and imaginary quadratic fields [ref]9. Let 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} be a quadratic extension of 𝕜𝕜\\Bbbk. Then it follows from standard field theory  that there exists some monic irreducible quadratic polynomial f∈𝕜​[x]𝑓𝕜delimited-[]𝑥f\\in\\Bbbk[x] such that where ⟨f⟩delimited-⟨⟩𝑓\\langle f\\rangle denotes the principal ideal generated by f𝑓f and 𝕜​[x]/⟨f⟩𝕜delimited-[]𝑥delimited-⟨⟩𝑓\\Bbbk[x]/\\langle f\\rangle the quotient ring.\nLet f​(x)=x2+β​x+τ𝑓𝑥superscript𝑥2𝛽𝑥𝜏f(x)=x^{2}+\\beta x+\\tau for some β,τ∈𝕜𝛽𝜏𝕜\\beta,\\tau\\in\\Bbbk. Then, up to an isomorphism, f𝑓f may be written in a normal form: char⁡(𝕜)≠2char𝕜2\\operatorname{char}(\\Bbbk)\\neq 2: β=0𝛽0\\beta=0 and −τ𝜏-\\tau is not a complete square in 𝕜𝕜\\Bbbk; char⁡(𝕜)=2char𝕜2\\operatorname{char}(\\Bbbk)=2: either β=0𝛽0\\beta=0 and −τ𝜏-\\tau is not a complete square in 𝕜𝕜\\Bbbk, or β=1𝛽1\\beta=1 and x2+x+τsuperscript𝑥2𝑥𝜏x^{2}+x+\\tau has no solution in 𝕜𝕜\\Bbbk.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: For example, in number theory, two of the biggest achievements in the last decade were the generalizations of Andrew Wiles’ celebrated work to real quadratic fields  and imaginary quadratic fields [ref]9.
