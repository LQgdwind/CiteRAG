      "content": "Paper Title: From ChatGPT to ThreatGPT: Impact of Generative AI in Cybersecurity and Privacy\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe generalization power of AI has been successful in replacing the traditional rule-based approaches with more intelligent technology [ref]17. However, the evolving digital landscape is not only upgrading technology but also elevating the sophistication of cyber threat actors. Traditionally, cyberspace faced relatively unsophisticated intrusion attempts but in very high volume. However, the introduction of AI-aided attacks by cyber offenders has begun an entirely new era, unleashing known and unknown transformations in cyberattack vectors [ref]17 . AI/ML has upgraded the effectiveness of cyber attacks making cyber offenders more powerful than ever. Evidently, with several recent instances getting noticed, GenAI has gained great interest from the cybersecurity community as well in both cyber defense and offense. The evolving GenAI tools have been a double-edge sword in cybersecurity, benefiting both the defenders and the attackers. The GenAI tools like ChatGPT can be used by cyber defenders to safeguard the system from malicious intruders. These tools leverage the information from LLMs trained on the massive amount of cyber threat intelligence data that includes vulnerabilities, attack patterns, and indications of attack. Cyber defenders can use this large sum of information to enhance their threat intelligence capability by extracting insights and identifying emerging threats . The GenAI tools can also be used to analyze the large volume of log files, system output, or network traffic data in case of cyber incidence. This allows defenders to speed up and automate the incident response process. GenAI driven models are also helpful in creating a security-aware human behavior by training the people for growing sophisticated attacks. GenAI tools can also aid in secured coding practices, both by generating the secure codes and producing test cases to confirm the security of written code. Additionally, LLM models are also helpful to develop better ethical guidelines to strengthen the cyber defense within a system. On the other side, the use of GenAI against cybersecurity and its risks of misuse can not be undermined. Cyber offenders can use GenAI to perform cyber attacks by either directly extracting the information or circumventing OpenAI’s ethical policies. Attackers use the generative power of GenAI tools to create a convincing social engineering attack, phishing attack, attack payload, and different kinds of malicious code snippets that can be compiled into an executable malware file  . Though the ethical policy of OpenAI  restricts LLMs, like ChatGPT, to provide malicious information to attackers directly, there are ways to bypass the restrictions imposed on these models using jailbreaking, reverse psychology and other techniques, as discussed later in this paper. In addition, the GenAI tools further assist cyber attackers due to a lack of context, unknown biases, security vulnerabilities, and over-reliance on these transformative technologies. Clearly, as the common public is getting access to the power of GenAI tools, analyzing the implications of GenAI models from a cybersecurity perspective is essential. Further, the sophistication and ease of access to ChatGPT makes it our primary tool in this paper to understand and analyze GenAI impacts on cybersecurity. There are some online blogs discussing the benefits and threats of GenAI  [ref]17  , but from our knowledge, there is not any formal scientific writing that reflects a holistic view of the impact of GenAI on cybersecurity. We believe that this work will contribute to the growing knowledge of GenAI from a cybersecurity perspective, helping the stakeholders better understand the risk, develop an effective defense, and support a secured digital environment. Figure 3 illustrates the impacts of GenAI and ChatGPT in cybersecurity and privacy, and provides a roadmap for our research. This paper has the following key contributions: It provides an overview of the evolution of GenAI, discuss its landscape in cybersecurity, and highlight limitations introduced by GenAI technology. It discusses the vulnerabilities in the ChatGPT model itself that malicious entities can exploit to disrupt the privacy as well as ethical boundaries of the model. It demonstrates the attacks on the ChatGPT with the GPT-3.5 model and its applications to cyber offenders. It presents the use of GenAI and ChatGPT for cyber defense and demonstrate defense automation, threat intelligence and other related approaches. It highlights aspects of ChatGPT, and its social, legal, and ethical implications, including privacy violations. It compares the security features of the two contemporary state-of-the-art GenAI systems including ChatGPT and Google’s Bard. It provides the open challenges and future directions for enhancing cybersecurity as the GenAI technology evolves. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.\nSection 2 discuss different ways to attack the ChatGPT and trick the system to bypass its ethical and privacy safeguards. Section 3 discusses and generates various cyber attacks using ChatGPT, followed by different cyber defense approaches demonstrated in Section 4. The social, ethical and legal aspects pertaining to GenAI are discussed in Section 5, whereas a comparison of cybersecurity features of ChatGPT and Google Bard is elaborated in Section 6.\nSection 7 highlights open research challenges\nand possible approaches to novel solutions. Finally, Section 8\ndraws conclusion to this research paper.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: The generalization power of AI has been successful in replacing the traditional rule-based approaches with more intelligent technology [ref]17.
