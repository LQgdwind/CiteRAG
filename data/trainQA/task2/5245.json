Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Our model architecture is based on ones studied before for 2D keypoint discovery¬†[ref]43 .\nOur encoder Œ¶Œ¶\\Phi is a ResNet-50¬†[ref]14, which outputs our appearance features. Our pose decoder Œ®Œ®\\Psi uses GlobalNet¬†, which outputs our 2D heatmaps. Our volume-to-volume network œÅùúå\\rho is based on V2V¬†[ref]33. Finally, our reconstruction decoder œàùúì\\psi is a a series of convolution blocks, where the architecture details are in Table¬†11. Our code is available at https://github.com/neuroethology/BKinD-3D. Hyperparameters. The hyperparameters for the volumetric 3D keypoint discovery model is in Table¬†12. All keypoint discovery models are trained until convergence, with 5 epochs for Human3.6M and 8 epochs for Rat 7M. We use œÉ=0.08ùúé0.08\\sigma=0.08 for the keypoint separation hyperparameter based on previous works¬†[ref]43. We include additional details on each dataset: Human3.6M.\nThe Human 3.6M dataset¬† contains 3.6 million frames of 3D human poses with corresponding video captured from 4 different camera views, recorded from a set of different scenarios (discussion, sitting, eating, ‚Ä¶). Each scenario consists of videos from all 4 views with the same background, across a set of human participants. The person in the video is approximately 1700mm tall while the room is approximately 4000mm in dimension. The dataset is captured at 50Hz.\nThis dataset is licensed for academic use, and more details on the dataset and license are provided by the Human 3.6M authors within¬†. Rat7M. The Rat7M dataset¬† consists of 3D pose and videos from a behavioral experiment with a set of rats, recorded across 6 views.\nThis is currently one of the largest dataset with animal 3D poses.\nThe dataset consists of 5 rats, with videos from some of the rats across multiple days.\nThe rats are approximately 250mm long with the cage being around 1000mm in dimension.\nThe video is captured at 120Hz.\nSome of the ground truth poses in Rat7M contains nans, and during processing, similar to ¬†, we remove frames with nans from evaluation.\nOur training procedure is not affected since we do not use any 3D poses during training.\nThis dataset is open-sourced for research.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: Architecture Details.
