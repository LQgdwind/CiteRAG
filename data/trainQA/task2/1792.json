      "content": "Paper Title: Temporal Memory Relation Network for Workflow Recognition from Surgical Video\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nComputer assisted surgery can help improve the quality of interventional healthcare, reduce intraoperative adverse events, and increase patient safety .\nRecognizing the surgical workflow is a fundamental enabler to design intelligent assistant systems in the operating room [ref]2.\nParticularly, workflow recognition enables the systems to monitor and optimize surgical process, provide context-aware decision support, and generate early warning of potential deviations and anomalies .\nThe real-time analysis of workflow information can facilitate coordination and communication among the surgical team members .\nAnother great usage is the automatic extraction of recorded database beyond intra-operative period,\nwhich can advance surgeon skill evaluation, surgical report documentation, surgeon educational training, and post-operative patient monitoring   .\nHowever, pure video-based workflow recognition is highly complex.\nComplicated surgical scenes lead to limited inter-phase variance but high intra-phase variance.\nScenes are often blurred due to the frequent motion of the surgical instruments.\nThe changes in lighting conditions, inevitable visual occlusions from smoke and blood, and artifacts introduced by the lens cleaning process also increase the difficulty of surgery perception. Capturing the long-range temporal dynamics effectively is of great importance for accurate workflow recognition, since surgical videos usually continue up to 30 minutes to 2 hours with each surgical phase lasting at least minute-level time.\nTo utilize the temporal information, one stream of recent works jointly learn the high-level spatio-temporal features using end-to-end recurrent convolutional networks (RCNets)  [ref]9 or 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) 0.\nHowever, those video models only collect information from a short-term view with 10s duration at most, limited by the GPU memory and computational resource.\nDue to the large variety of surgical scenes in each phase and commonly existed artifacts, watching only short-term cues is not sufficient to achieve accurate recognition.\nSee Fig. 1(a), recognizing phase of the current frame is difficult by watching 10s information.\nExtending to longer-term context (about 30s) helps better perceive the present phase of Calot Triangle Dissection.\nAnother stream of solutions first extract features or prediction probabilities of isolated frames using CNN, and then input these pre-calculations into the temporal models for refinement, typically using hidden Markov models (HMMs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs)  1 2 3.\nAlthough covering up to the whole procedure, those separate training schemes hardly make the best use of the complementary information of visual and temporal features.\nHow to simultaneously take both advantages of end-to-end learning and long-range temporal information is crucial to achieving accurate workflow recognition. We also identify another vital intrinsic property of surgical workflow.\nAs the surgical procedure can be described as a sequence of tasks at different granularity levels, including phases, steps, and activities, with gradually fine-grained definition 4,\neach phase can be naturally presented as the compositions of actions, in which we observe that these actions are characterized by high variability in their temporal duration.\nFor example, see Fig. 1 (b), the phase Calot Triangle Dissection can be broken down into the homogeneous and repetitive actions about using hook to dissect tissues, while varying in performing span.\nThe phase Gallbladder Packaging is composed of different actions, including opening bag, grasping gallbladder, and putting gallbladder into bag, also exhibiting large variations in temporal extents.\nHowever, existing works scarcely take this nature into account.\nThey model the surgical video dynamics either using 3D convolutions with fixed kernel size 0, or inputting the constant length of video clip representations into LSTM layers  5 3 [ref]9.\nBoth forms of variables are too rigid to capture the varieties of temporal space for complex surgical workflow analysis. In this paper, we present a novel temporal memory relation network (TMRNet) for surgical workflow recognition, by relating long-range and multi-scale temporal supports for strengthening the features of current frame, with the end-to-end network training.\nConcretely, we establish a long-range memory bank to store rich and time-indexed representations of the whole surgical procedure, serving as an auxiliary component to augment the standard video models.\nA temporal variation layer is then proposed to enhance the long-range features from the memory bank with multi-scale convolutions in temporal space, which can reason about complex temporal patterns of surgical procedure.\nImportantly, we design a non-local bank operator that enables our TMRNet to access such rich supportive context from the memory bank, without interrupting the end-to-end training process towards joint spatio-temporal feature learning.\nOur method only accesses the previous information from memory bank when estimating each frame. Such online setup improves the applicability of our method for real-world surgery.\nWe extensively evaluate our method in online mode on two typical and publicly available surgical video datasets, including M2CAI challenge dataset and a large-scale Cholec80 dataset.\nOur method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches significantly and consistently on both datasets.\nOur main contributions are summarized as follows: We propose a novel framework, i.e., TMRNet, to accurately recognize workflow from surgical videos. Superior to previous short-term and rigid-scope temporal modeling, our end-to-end TMRNet can observe long-range temporal dependency and capture complex multi-scale temporal patterns for improving recognition accuracy. We build a long-range memory bank to provide the long-term supportive features encoding the past surgical frames.\nThe information is further augmented by our designed temporal variation layer with multi-scale temporal-only kernels, to tolerate large variations in duration of action components. We develop a non-local bank operator, to enhance the current spatio-temporal feature by attentively relating it to the information stored in the memory bank, also to remain the capability of end-to-end network training. We conduct extensive validations on two well-known and public benchmark surgical video datasets. Our method achieves a great performance gain, surpassing the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin (e.g., 68.5%percent68.568.5\\% v.s. 74.3%percent74.374.3\\% Jaccard on M2CAI and 67.0%percent67.067.0\\% v.s. 78.9%percent78.978.9\\% Jaccard on Cholec80).
