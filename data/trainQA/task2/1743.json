      "content": "Paper Title: Lower bound for the 𝑇 count via unitary stabilizer nullity\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nResource theory for magic monotones has wide applications in quantum information. In this work, we introduce a magic monotone for unitaries, and use it to lower bound the T𝑇T count in the circuit synthesis task. This lower bound quantifies the minimum magic resources required for the computation, and lower bounds the runtime of classical simulation algorithms based on the Clifford+T𝑇T gate set. We also give numerical results which show that our magic monotone can give better T𝑇T count lower bounds for some gates when compared with other magic monotones. Specifically, in this paper, for any n𝑛n-qubit unitary U𝑈U, we introduce its unitary-stabilizer nullity as v​(U)=2​n−s​(U)𝑣𝑈2𝑛𝑠𝑈v(U)=2n-s(U), where s​(U)𝑠𝑈s(U) is the number of ±1​splus-or-minus1𝑠\\pm 1s in the Pauli transfer matrix. We prove that the unitary-stabilizer nullity satisfies several desirable properties, and in particular establish that it is a lower bound for the T𝑇T count of U𝑈U. We show that the lower bound obtained by the unitary-stabilizer nullity never performs worse than the state-stabilizer nullity. We also give an n𝑛n-qubit unitary family of unitary-stabilizer nullity 2​n2𝑛2n, providing examples where the unitary-stabilizer nullity strictly outperforms. For the diagonal unitaries, we prove the lower bounds obtained by the state- and the unitary-stabilizer nullity are the same. Besides, we connect the unitary-stabilizer nullity and the state-stabilizer nullity with auxiliary systems. Moreover, the results in this work may shed lights for the study of resource theories of quantum dynamics (e.g., Refs.      [ref]43 [ref]44). Meaningful magic monotones with desirable properties are very useful to exploit the power of nonstabilizer resources in\nquantum computation. Our work has, in particular, shown the applications of unitary-stabilizer nullity in estimating the T𝑇T count, which is central for resource estimation for fault-tolerant computation , performance analysis for classical-simulation algorithms   ,\nand even for the complexity of the\nparameterized Quantum Merlin-Arthur problem\n(QMA problem) .\nThere are many other applications beyond. For one thing, we could apply the unitary-stabilizer nullity to benchmark the gate synthesis task under stabilizer operations   . Using the result in Theorem 13, the benchmark method can be generalized for any non-Clifford gates. For another, one might use the unitary-stabilizer nullity to quantify the nonstabilizerness of quantum circuits   on near-term quantum devices, as we could extract the unitary Pauli function on the quantum hardware, via firstly measuring the states U​(σv+I)/2n​U†𝑈subscript𝜎𝑣𝐼superscript2𝑛superscript𝑈†U(\\sigma_{v}+I)/{2^{n}}U^{\\dagger} and U​(I−σv)/2n​U†𝑈𝐼subscript𝜎vsuperscript2𝑛superscript𝑈†U(I-\\sigma_{{\\textbf{v}}})/{2^{n}}U^{\\dagger} with measurement operator σusubscript𝜎u\\sigma_{{\\textbf{u}}}, and then obtain the Pauli function.\nProtocols for evaluating the nonstabilizerness experimentally   can be used to analyze the performance of quantum devices. Beyond this work, there are still various interesting open questions\non the quantification of non-Clifford resources: For the task of lower bounding T𝑇T gates for a given unitary,\nthe unitary-stabilizer nullity gives a bound up to 2​n2𝑛2n. However, in general the T𝑇T count can be much larger than 2​n2𝑛2n. For example, it is known that only unitaries with elements in certain rings can be exactly synthesized by Clifford and T𝑇T gates . Is it possible to get a superlinear bound by devising alternative magic monotones? Here we define the T𝑇T count to be the minimum number of T𝑇T gates used for exactly synthesizing a given unitary U𝑈U. Is it possible to lower bound the number of T𝑇T gates for unitary V𝑉V which approximates U𝑈U, i.e. |V−U|≤ϵ𝑉𝑈italic-ϵ|V-U|\\leq\\epsilon? Beverland et al.  have considered this setting for single-qubit unitaries.
