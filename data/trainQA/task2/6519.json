      "content": "Paper Title: Temporal Graph Benchmark for Machine Learning on Temporal Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMany real-world systems such as social networks, transaction networks, and molecular structures can be effectively modeled as graphs, where nodes correspond to entities and edges are relations between entities. Recently, significant advances have been made for machine learning on static graphs, led by the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) [ref]22 3  and Graph Transformers   , and accelerated by the availability of public datasets and standardized evaluations protocols, such as the widely adopted Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) . However, most available graph datasets are designed only for static graphs and lack the fine-grained timestamp information often seen in many real-world networks that evolve over time. Examples include social networks , transportation networks , transaction networks  and trade networks [ref]33.\nSuch networks are formalized as Temporal Graphs (TGs) where the nodes, edges, and their features change dynamically. A variety of machine learning approaches tailored for learning on TGs have been proposed in recent years, often demonstrating promising performance     . However, Poursafaei et al. [ref]33 recently revealed an important issue: these TG methods often portray an over-optimistic performance — meaning they appear to perform better than they would in real-world applications — due to the inherent limitations of commonly used evaluation protocols. This over-optimism creates serious challenges for researchers. It becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish between the strengths and weaknesses of various methods when their test results suggest similarly high performance. Furthermore, there is a discrepancy between real-world applications of TG methods and the existing evaluation protocols used to assess them. Therefore, there is a pressing need for an open and standardized benchmark that enhance the evaluation process for temporal graph learning, while being aligned with real-world applications. In this work, we present the Temporal Graph Benchmark (TGB), a collection of challenging and diverse benchmark datasets for realistic, reproducible, and robust evaluation for machine learning on temporal graphs. Figure 2 shows TGB’s ML pipeline. Inspired by the success of OGB, TGB automates the process of dataset downloading and processing as well as evaluation protocols, and allows the user to easily compare their model performance with other models on the public leaderboard. TGB improves the evaluation of temporal graph learning in both dataset selection and evaluation protocol and covers both edge and node level tasks. Dataset Selection.\nContrary to real-world networks that typically contain millions of nodes and tens of millions of edges, existing TG benchmark datasets are notably smaller, falling short by several orders of magnitude [ref]33 . Furthermore, these datasets often have limitations in terms of their domain diversity, with a substantial focus on social and interaction networks   . This lack of diversity can be problematic as network properties, such as network motifs , the scale-free property , and the modular structure  vary significantly across different domains. Consequently, it is important to benchmark existing methods across a wide variety of domains for a more comprehensive evaluation. To address these limitations, TGB datasets provide diversity in terms of the number of nodes, edges, timestamps, and network domains. As shown in Figure 1, TGB datasets are larger in scale and present statistics that were under-explored in prior literature. For instance, the tgbn-token dataset has around 73 million edges while the tgbl-comment dataset has more than 30 million timestamps.  Additionally, TGB introduces four datasets in the novel node affinity prediction task to address the scarcity of large scale datasets for node level tasks in the current literature. Improved Evaluation.\nIn TGB, we aim to design the evaluation for both edge and node level tasks on temporal graphs based on real applications. Historically, the standard approach for dynamic link prediction evaluation is to treat it as a binary classification task using one negative edge per positive edge in the test set    [ref]33.\nThis strategy tends to generate negatives that are easy to predict, given the structure and sparsity of real-world networks , leading to inflated model performance estimations [ref]33. To address this issue,\nwe propose to treat the task as a ranking problem, contrasting each positive sample against multiple negatives and using Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) as the metric. Moreover, historical negatives – past edges absent in the current step – are more difficult to predict correctly than randomly sampled negatives [ref]33. Thus, we sample both historical and random negatives in link prediction evaluations. There is a lack of large scale datasets for node level tasks in temporal graphs as acquiring dynamic node labels remains challenging due to privacy concerns. We plan to include additional datasets for node classification in the future. As a starting point, we present the novel node affinity prediction task, which finds its motivation in recommendation systems. The objective is to anticipate the shifts in user preferences for items over time, as expanded in Section 3.2. In this task, node property is considered as the affinity towards different items at a given time. To assess the effectiveness of methods in addressing this task, we adopt the normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) metric. This metric serves to determine whether the methods’ predictions for class importance adhere to the same ordering as the ground truth.\nIn Section 5.1, we show that simple heuristics can outperform state-of-the-art TG methods in achieving superior performance for this task.\n Overall, our proposed Temporal Graph Benchmark has the following contributions: Large and diverse datasets. TGB includes datasets coming from a diverse range of domains and spanning both node and edge-level tasks. We contributed seven novel datasets which are orders of magnitude larger than existing ones in terms of number of edges, nodes and timestamps. Improved evaluation. We propose an improved and standardized evaluation pipeline motivated by real-world applications. For dynamic link property prediction, we sample multiple negative samples per positive edge and ensure a mix of both historical and random negative samples, while using the MRR metric. For the node affinity prediction task, we use the NDCG metric to evaluate the relative importance of classes within the top ranking ones. Empirical findings. We show that for the dynamic link property prediction task, model performances can vary drastically across datasets. For example, the best performing model on tgbl-wiki encounters a 40% test MRR drop on tgbl-review and the surprise index of a dataset affects model performance. On the node affinity prediction task, we find that simple heuristics can often outperform state-of-the-art TG methods, thus leaving ample room for development of future methods targeting this task. Public leaderboard and reproducible results. Following the good practice of OGB, TGB also provides an automated and reproducible pipeline for both link and node property prediction tasks. Researchers can submit and compare method performance on the TGB leaderboard. Reproducibility: TGB code, datasets, leaderboards and details are on the TGB website. The code is also publicly available on GitHub with documentations seen here.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: correspond to entities and edges are relations between entities.
