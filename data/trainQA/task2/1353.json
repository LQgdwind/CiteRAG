      "content": "Paper Title: Graph integration of structured, semistructured and unstructured data for data journalism\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur work belongs to the area of data integration .\nData integration can be achieved either in a warehouse fashion (consolidating all the data sources into a single repository), or in a mediator fashion (preserving the data in their original repository, and querying through a mediator module which distributes the work to each data source, and combines the results).\nInitially, we followed a mediator approach , allowing users to express queries using a mix of languages fitting every individual data source, similar to polystore systems  .\nOur apporach could be further combined with a mixed XML-RDF language for fact-checking applications  .\nHowever, the journalists’ feedback was that the installation and maintenance of a mediator over several data sources, and querying through a mixed language, were very far from their technical skills.\nThis is why here, we (i𝑖i) pursue a warehouse approach; (i​i𝑖𝑖ii) base our architecture on Postgres, a highly popular and robust system; (i​i​i𝑖𝑖𝑖iii) simplify the query paradigm to keyword querying. ConnectionLens integrates a wide variety of data sources: JSON, relational, RDF and text since , to which we have added XML, multidimensional tables, and PDF documents.\nWe integrate such heterogeneous content in a graph, therefore, our work recalls the production of Linked Data.\nA significant difference is that we do not impose that our graph is RDF, and we do not assume, require, or use a domain ontology. Graphs are also produced when constructing knowledge bases, e.g., Yago 5 .\nOur setting is more limited in that we are only allowed to integrate a given set of datasets that journalists trust to not “pollute” the database.\nTherefore, we use a KB only for disambiguation and accept (as stated in Section 1) that the KB does not cover some entities found in our input datasets. Our simple techniques for matching (thus, connecting) nodes are reminiscent of data cleaning, entity resolution  9, and key finding in knowledge bases, e.g. . Much more elaborate techniques exist, notably, when the data is regular, its structure is known and fixed, an ontology is available, etc.; none of these holds in our setting. Keyword search (KS) is widely used for searching in unstructured (typically text) data, and it is also the best search method for novice users, as witnessed by the enormous success of keyword-based search engines.\nAs databases grow in size and complexity, KS has been proposed as a method for searching also in structured data , when users are not perfectly familiar with the data, or to get answers enabled by different tuple connections.\nFor relational data, in  and subsequent works, tuples are represented as nodes, and two tuples are interconnected through primary key-foreign key pairs.\nThe resulting graphs are thus quite uniform, e.g., they consist of “Company nodes”, “Employee nodes” etc.\nThe same model was considered in    ;  also establishes links based on similarity of constants appearing in different relational attributes.\nAs explained in Section 8.2, our problem is (much) harder since our trees can traverse edges in both directions, and paths can be (much) longer than those based on PK-FK alone. KS has also been studied in XML documents  3, where an answer is defined as a subtree of the original document, whose leaves match the query keywords. This problem is much easier than ours, since: (i𝑖i) an XML document is a tree, guaranteeing just one connection between any two nodes; in contrast, there can be any number of such connections in our graphs; (i​i𝑖𝑖ii) the maximum size of an answer to a k𝑘k-keywords query is k⋅h⋅𝑘ℎk\\cdot h where hℎh, the height of an XML tree, is almost always quite small, e.g., 202020 is considered “quite high”; in contrast, with our bi-directional search, the bound is k⋅D⋅𝑘𝐷k\\cdot D where D𝐷D is the diameter of our graph - which can be much larger. Our Grow and Merge steps are borrowed from  , which address KS for graphs, assuming optimal-substructure, which does not hold for us, and single-direction edge traversal. For RDF graphs  0 traverse edges in their direction only; moreover, 0 also make strong assumptions on the graph, e.g., that all non-leaf nodes have types, and that there are very few types (regular graph). In , the authors investigate a different kind of answers, called r𝑟r-clique graphs, which they find using specific indexes. Keyword search across heterogeneous datasets has been previously studied in  1. However, in these works, each answer comes from a single dataset, that is, they never consider answers spanning over and combining multiple datasets, such as the one shown in Figure 2.\nIn turn, multiple datasets lead to equivalence and similarity edges; we have shown how to compactly encode the latter using representatives, and efficiently enumerate solutions which may span data, equivalence, and similarity edges. A recent work 4 leverages text data sources to find more answers to queries over knowledge graphs. An important difference is that we integrate all datasets prior to querying whereas in 4, text is accessed when required to complement the loaded data graph.\nThe effort we invest in building the graphs pays off by making queries faster.\nFurther, our work is more general in the data formats we support. Finally, 4 applies a set of heuristics, tied to the nature of the graphs they used, to find the most relevant answers; our work does not make such assumptions. (G)STP has been addressed under simplifications that do not hold in our context.\nFor instance: the quality of a solution decreases exponentially with the tree size, thus search can stop when all trees are under a certain threshold [ref]7; edges are considered in a single direction   0; the cost function has the suboptimal-structure property  2 etc.\nThese assumptions reduce the computational cost; in contrast, to leave our options open as to the best score function, we build a feasible solution for the general problem we study.\nSome works have focused on finding bounded (G)STP approximations, i.e., (G)STP trees solutions whose cost is at most f𝑓f times higher than the optimal cost, e.g.,  .\nBeyond the differences between our problem and (G)STP, due notably to the fact that our score is much more general (Section 9), non-expert users find it hard to set f𝑓f.
