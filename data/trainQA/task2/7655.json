      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Vision-and-Language Pre-training with Text-Relevant Image Patch Selection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nE2E-VLP : proposes the first end-to-end VLP method for both V+L understanding and generation, with a unified Transformer encoder-decoder architecture. VinVL [ref]59: pre-trains a large-scale object-attribute detection model with much larger amounts of supervised data on four public object detection datasets for extracting better region-based visual features. OSCAR [ref]27: proposes to use object tags detected in images as anchor points to ease the learning of cross-modal alignments, where the input to the Transformer is a combination of image, text, and object tags. METER [ref]11: systematically investigates how to design and pre-train a fully transformer-based VL model in an end-to-end manner. VLMo : presents a unified vision-language pre-trained model that jointly learns a dual encoder and a fusion encoder with a modular Transformer network. SimVLM : different from previous VLP methods that only use limited (4M-10M) image-text pairs for pre-training, it proposes a simple VLP model with a single prefix language modeling objective, which pre-trains on an extremely large aligned cross-modal data of about 1.8B noisy image-text pairs. This is also the latest state-of-the-art method of image captioning. ALBEF : introduces a contrastive loss to align the image and text representations before fusing them through cross-modal attention, which enables more grounded vision and language representation learning. UNITER : proposes an improved single-stream VLP method, by designing two new pre-training strategies: 1) it uses conditional masking on pre-training tasks instead of random masking strategy, 2) it designs a new word-region alignment pre-training task via the use of optimal transport to explicitly encourage fine-grained alignment between words and image regions. ALIGN : leverages a noisy dataset of over one billion image alt-text pairs, obtained without expensive filtering or post-processing steps in the Conceptual Captions dataset. ViLT : adopts linear projection and word embedding as the visual and textual encoders, and uses the visual transformer as the cross-modal encoder to align and fuse the features of both modalities in an end-to-end manner. BLIP : proposes a new VLP framework that transfers flexibly to both vision-language understanding and generation tasks. It effectively utilizes noisy web data by bootstrapping the captions. UNICORN : proposes a vision-language (VL) model that unifies text generation and bounding box prediction into a single architecture. LXMERT : is the pioneering work to pre-train a dual-stream multi-modal Transformer, which consists of an object relationship encoder, a language encoder, and a cross-modality encoder. It is widely used as a baseline method for VLP models. ViLBERT : proposes the first work that extends the BERT architecture to a multi-modal dual-stream VLP model, which processes both visual and textual inputs in separate streams that interact through co-attentional transformer layers. mPLUG  : is a vision-language foundation model for both cross-modal understanding and generation and introduces an effective and efficient vision-language architecture with novel cross-modal skip-connections.\n\nReference markers found: [59]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]59: E2E-VLP : proposes the first end-to-end VLP method for both V+L understanding and generation, with a unified Transformer encoder-decoder architecture.
