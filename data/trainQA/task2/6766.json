      "content": "Paper Title: Object Goal Navigation with Recursive Implicit Maps\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVisual navigation.\nThe history of visual navigation can be dated back to the late 1960s with the development of the robot Shakey   which combined perception and planning to accomplish high-level tasks. The field gained traction in the early 1980s  and, since then, a range of visual navigation tasks   have been proposed for navigation in 3D environments with different goal specifications.\nFor example, point goal navigation (PointNav)   uses coordinates relative to the agent’s start position as the target; image goal navigation (ImageNav) 9   requires agents to go to the place where an image is taken;\nand in vision-and-language navigation (VLN)   , agents must follow step-by-step instructions to reach the goal.\nObject goal navigation (ObjectNav)  uses the object category as target. It is particularly challenging as it requires semantic recognition to detect the goal\nand needs more efficient exploration than VLN.\nWhile current methods have nearly ‘solved’ PointNav   even in the real world and perform well in other visual navigation tasks  , they are less competitive in ObjectNav.\nHence, in this work, we focus on improving models for ObjectNav. Object goal navigation.\nModeling previous navigation history is crucial for efficient exploration and navigation in the environment.\nIt is typically done in two ways: explicit mapping and implicit representations.\nExplicit mapping based approaches build maps for planning, as for example occupancy maps 8 and semantic maps  [ref]6 8.\nDifferent exploration strategies have been proposed based on these maps such as frontier-based search 7, maximizing exploration area 8 and object location prediction [ref]6 8.\nYet, recent work  observes that these maps are still insufficient for efficient object-oriented exploration.\nThe other line of work implicitly learns representations of the environment in an end-to-end manner. Many works    utilize recurrent neural networks 9 0, while few works 1 2 treat navigation episodes as sequences and apply transformers to leverage long-term memory.\nTo train these navigation models, reinforcement learning (RL) 0 is the most widely used approach.\nHowever, RL often suffers from poor sample efficiency , requires reward engineering and is prone to overfit in seen environments  .\nMore recently, Habitat-web  designed a web interface to easily collect human demonstrations and showed that behavior cloning with human demos enables learning smarter exploration strategies than RL.\nWe use this human demonstration dataset for training with behavior cloning and design a new implicit representation for end-to-end learning. Maps for navigation.\nExplicit maps have shown to be beneficial for navigation, especially for long-term navigation tasks 1.\nThey can be represented by occupancy maps 8, topological graphs 9, meshes 2, point clouds 3 or sparse points 4.\nSuch representations aim to capture the geometry of the environment for obstacle avoidance and have been extended to semantic maps  [ref]6 8.\nThese maps are commonly built using Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) 5, but this construction process is tedious, notably due to noise in the sensors, expensive compute, parameter tuning and high storage requirements as the maps grow.\nImplicit scene representation is one promising alternative to alleviate these limitations: Partsey et al.  demonstrate that explicit mapping may not be necessary for navigation, even in a realistic setting, while\nWijmans et al. 6 show that maps can emerge in implicit representations.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: is typically done in two ways: explicit mapping and implicit representations.\nExplicit mapping based approaches build maps for planning, as for example occupancy maps 8 and semantic maps  [ref]6 8.\nDifferent exploration strategies have been proposed based on these maps such as frontier-based search 7, maximizing exploration area 8 and object location prediction [ref]6 8.\nYet, recent\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
