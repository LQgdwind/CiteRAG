      "content": "Paper Title: Toward Practical Benchmarks of Ising Machines: A Case Study on the Quadratic Knapsack Problem\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCombinatorial optimization is an important research area with applications in various fields such as artificial intelligence and operations research.\nFor example, the knapsack problem and its variants are famous and well-studied combinatorial optimization problems with numerous applications including production planning, resource allocation, and portfolio selection¬†.\nTheoretically, combinatorial optimization problems are often hard to solve exactly within a reasonable amount of time due to their NP-hardness.\nTherefore, various heuristics and meta-heuristics have been developed for dealing with large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. Ising machines offer a new computing paradigm for tackling hard combinatorial optimization problems¬†.\nIsing machines search a ground state of a given Ising model, a model in statistical mechanics involving binary variables (called spins) and their interactions, and thus can be used for optimization over binary variables.\nFor problems with additional constraint conditions on binary variables,\nthe penalty method is typically used¬†.\nNamely, a constraint on binary variables x=(x1,‚ãØ,xn)ùë•subscriptùë•1‚ãØsubscriptùë•ùëõx=(x_{1},\\cdots,x_{n}) is translated into a penalty term Hcon‚Äã(x)subscriptùêªconùë•H_{\\mathrm{con}}(x) added to the objective function Hobj‚Äã(x)subscriptùêªobjùë•H_{\\mathrm{obj}}(x) with a positive coefficient Œª>0ùúÜ0\\lambda>0 to construct an unconstrained binary optimization problem to which an Ising machine is applied.\nThere exist several types of Ising machines depending on the way of physical implementation: examples are quantum annealers¬† , coherent Ising machines¬† , and specialized-circuit-based digital machines¬†[ref]8  0 1 2.\nThese machines enable fast sampling of near-optimal solutions on the max cut problem, which is naturally formulated with an Ising model. However, for problems with additional constraint conditions on binary variables, the superiority of Ising machines to other methods has not been observed.\nFor example, previous benchmark results¬†3 4 5 6 on the quadratic knapsack problem (QKP) and quadratic assignment problem (QAP) show that Ising machines are not competitive with previous (meta-)heuristic solvers.\nA critical performance issue is that Ising machines do not necessarily output feasible solutions, i.e., solutions satisfying constraints.\nThe penalty coefficient ŒªùúÜ\\lambda in (1) is required to be large for outputs to be feasible, but large ŒªùúÜ\\lambda typically degrades the objective value.\nFor practical use, it is strongly required to show examples where Ising machines can achieve high performance by overcoming this dilemma and leveraging their strengths. In this study, we focus on the benchmark of Ising machines on the QKP¬†7.\nThe QKP is a well-studied practical problem involving one inequality constraint over binary variables and thus is presumably suitable for solving with Ising machines. Several methods to encode an inequality constraint into penalties have been proposed and validated¬†8 9 0 1 to apply Ising machines to the QKP,\nsince the choice of encoding methods has impacts on controlling the trade-off between the feasibility and objective value.\nNevertheless, none of them have achieved better results than other heuristic solvers or even a simple greedy method.\nMoreover, each encoding method has different advantages and disadvantages, making it difficult to select the appropriate method for a given problem instance. We take another approach to enhance the solving performance of Ising machines by exploiting the problem structure.\nSpecifically, we propose to incorporate efficient two-stage post-processing into the solving process using an Ising machine.\nThe post-processing consists of repair and improvement procedures.\nFirst, if the output of the Ising machine is not feasible, the repair procedure is applied to convert it into a feasible solution.\nThe repair procedure resolves the biggest problem of Ising machines that they might output infeasible solutions.\nThis enables us to tune the penalty coefficient according to the objective value, not to the rate of feasible solutions (Fig.¬†1).\nThen, the obtained feasible solution is improved by a local improvement procedure.\nSince Ising machines are suited for global search, the improvement procedure takes a complementary role to achieve further improvement via local search.\nBoth procedures are based on a well-known greedy algorithm that runs sufficiently fast compared to the execution of Ising machines. We conduct simulation experiments on medium-sized QKP instances using simulated annealing.\nThe results show that the combined use of the repair and improvement procedures provides the synergistic effect on gaining the solving performance, achieving optimal solutions on more than 80% of the test instances within a reasonable time.\nBesides, we find that the post-processing greatly reduces the dependency of the Ising machine performance on the choice of encoding methods of the inequality constraint to penalties, which might make practical use of Ising machines much easier. Lastly, we evaluate the performance of Amplify Annealing Engine (AE)¬†2, one of the state-of-the-art Ising machines, with our method on a data set of large QKP instances of size ranging from 1000 to 2000.\nAE combined with the post-processing achieves best-known solutions on 77.5% of test instances and a small optimality gap on the rest instances.\nThis result significantly exceeds the previous benchmark using Ising machines on QKP and is comparable to the results of previous (meta-)heuristic methods¬†3 4 5 6. Our contribution is summarized as follows: We propose a method to solve the QKP with Ising machines combined with the post-processing consisting of the repair and improvement procedures. Through simulation experiments on medium-sized instances, we show that the post-processing is effective in obtaining optimal solutions and making the performance robust to a choice of encoding methods. We benchmark AE, a state-of-the-art Ising machine, on large QKP instances and show that it achieves best-known solutions on 77.5% of them. This is the first result that an Ising-machine-based solver achieves a performance comparable to previous heuristics on the QKP. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.\nBackgrounds on Ising machines and the QKP are explained in Section¬†II.\nWe introduce the proposed method in Section¬†III.\nThe simulation experiment is conducted in Section¬†IV.\nWe benchmark the Ising machine in Section¬†V.\nRelated work and future direction is discussed in Section¬†VI.\nSection¬†VII concludes this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: exist several types of Ising machines depending on the way of physical implementation: examples are quantum annealers¬† , coherent Ising machines¬† , and specialized-circuit-based digital machines¬†[ref]8  0 1 2.\nThese machines enable fast sampling of near-optimal solutions on the max cut problem, which is naturally formulated with an Ising model.
