      "content": "Paper Title: IM-META: Influence Maximization Using Node Metadata in Networks With Unknown Topology\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe method that we proposed in this study is related to the following four broad research lines. IM in topologically known networks. Kempe et al.  originally introduced the problem formulation of IM when the network structure is initially known and proposed a greedy approach to solve it. Besides heuristic solutions scalable to large-scale networks    , subsequent studies focused mostly on reducing the computational complexity of greedy algorithms, such as CELF/CELF++  0, TIM/TIM+ , IMM [ref]21, SSA/D-SSA , RS , and CFDI , while providing approximate solutions with performance guarantees. IM in topologically unknown networks. More recently, researchers have paid attention to a more challenging IM problem, in which the structure of the underlying network is initially unknown. Following the concept of active learning for classification  , dynamic IM over a series of rounds in which information on edges is collected after each round has been studied . To aid the network discovery process, exploratory IM (EIM) methods exploit topological information such as the community structure 3. Recently, EIM methods tend to rely on complementary data such as a set of similar graphs 4 5 6. However, such data are scarcely available under the topology-unaware setting of many real-world networks. As follow-up studies on EIM, CHANGE 1 utilized the friendship paradox, while DQN 4, CLAIM 5, and RL4IM 6 learned patterns from a set of similar graphs to effectively select a set of query nodes.\nAnother attempt to solve the IM problem in unknown networks involves learning an influence function based on observed cascades . Although some attempts have been made to exploit node metadata  , they rely on handcrafted metadata, thereby incurring significant annotation efforts by domain experts that lack scalability since such work is infeasible on large network datasets. Moreover, a theoretical analysis on the performance of IM was carried out in settings where a subgraph is retrieved via random node sampling 6 7. TableÂ I summarizes the aforementioned IM methods utilizing different types of side information in topologically unknown networks. IM in temporal/dynamic networks. Recently, there have been several studies that explore the IM problem for temporal and dynamic networks with different settings. Assuming that the past and current snapshots of the underlying network are known, the authors attempted to forecast its evolution using non-negative matrix factorization and graph neural networks 8. In another setting, under the assumption that the network changes over time, it was studied that such changes can be obtained by probing nodes and updating the topology 9.\nIn a similar probing context, a divide-and-conquer strategy was used in  to minimize the variance between the observed topology and the ground truth network across diverse representative communities. Link prediction using metadata. When the network structure is partially observable, a matrix factorization-aided approach  was proposed to leverage node features for link prediction. Our study is related to the inductive link prediction problem, the so-called cold-start link prediction, in which no initial topological information is available. To achieve satisfactory prediction performance, deep learning-based techniques such as G2G  and DEAL  have been proposed, where they use a deep encoder that embeds each node in a given network as Gaussian distributions and aligns both structure and feature embeddings, respectively. Discussion. Despite numerous contributions to IM in unknown networks, our method is the first to exploit the collected node metadata to automatically aid the process of discovering influential seed nodes. Unlike prior studies that perform inductive link prediction in a supervised manner (e.g., graph neural network-based methods), our solution tackles the lack of explored edges that can be used as labels in training when only a small portion of the underlying network is observable via node queries.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: heuristic solutions scalable to large-scale networks    , subsequent studies focused mostly on reducing the computational complexity of greedy algorithms, such as CELF/CELF++  0, TIM/TIM+ , IMM [ref]21, SSA/D-SSA , RS , and CFDI , while providing approximate solutions with performance guarantees.
