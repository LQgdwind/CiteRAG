Because obtaining massive and high-quality annotations is extremely labor-consuming and infeasible, many researchers often take an inexpensive and imperfect method as a substitution, such as pattern-based extraction in NLP   and automatic labeling in multimedia processing    . These methods inevitably involve incorrect samples (i.e., samples with label noise), but DNNs can easily overfit to noisy labels and lead to poor generalization performance\n.\nTo improve model performance and generalization, curriculum learning (CL) presents a new idea that easy samples should be learned before hard ones during training  . This can be done by estimating the importance of each sample directly during training based on the intuitive observation that easy and hard samples behave differently in terms of their respective loss, and can therefore be discriminated. However, previous studies primarily select or reweight samples to suppress the contribution of incorrect samples to the loss function and regard incorrect samples as ordinary hard ones     .\nIn this situation, hard samples mix with incorrect ones.  state that hard samples rather than incorrect samples are analogs to support vectors, critical for model generalization. To facilitate this, we follow the core principle of curriculum learning and append a novel loss function DiscrimLoss on top of the existing task loss to discriminate between hard samples and incorrect ones.\nIn contrast to conventional CL, DiscrimLoss focuses on easy, hard, and incorrect samples (exemplified by Fig. 1) simultaneously and dedicate to separating hard samples and incorrect samples as much as possible.\nSpecifically, DiscrimLoss is a stage-wise learning strategy.\nAt the early training stages, we focus on improving the model performance by discriminating easy and difficult samples (including hard and incorrect samples).\nAs we move into the following training stages, we aim at enhancing model generalization by separating hard instances and incorrect ones. In this way, a model can learn from correct samples (including easy samples and hard ones) more adequately and avoid memorizing noisy labels.\nTo this end, we present a stable sample reweight method to automatically estimate the difficulty and importance of samples via an adaptive indicator. We learn DiscrimLoss in a self-supervised manner by involving an extra learnable parameter.\nExperimental results on six datasets under two modals, comprising benchmark-simulated and real-world label noise datasets, demonstrate consistent gain, which verifies the effectiveness and generality of our method.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved extraordinary success in various tasks, such as commonsense reasoning [ref]1 , natural language generation , speech recognition [ref]4, and image classification [ref]5.\nHowever, as a data-driven method, the success is largely attributed to the large-scale\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
