      "content": "Paper Title: Weakly-Supervised Temporal Action Detection for Fine-Grained Videos with Hierarchical Atomic Actions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFine-grained action detection has become an increasingly important research topic recently. Several fine-grained action datasets have been proposed, such as MPII , Salad 50 , MERL Shopping , GTEA , EPIC-KITCHENS-100 , FineGym , and FineAction . Small differences between fine-grained action categories post extra challenges for action detection. As a result, it is not uncommon to see that models designed for general action detection perform much worse on fine-grained datasets  . Previous works explored different methods to model fine-grained action details. Mac et al.  applied deformable convolution to extract local spatio-temporal features in order to obtain fine-grained motion details. Piergiovanni and Ryoo  leveraged temporal structures to detect actions. Mavroudi et al.’s work [ref]28 involved learning a dictionary for action primitives. These primitives capture fine-grained action details, and inspired our work in the use of atomic actions. The most relevant to our work is [ref]32, which decomposed the detection task into two steps on coarse and fine levels respectively. This inspired our hierarchical modeling of visual concepts. All these prior works require full supervision of action start/end point annotations. Some previous works’ settings are close to weakly-supervised setting, but still require extra supervision other than just the set of actions, such as the order of actions  . This research is set to address weakly-supervised action detection for fine-grained videos with only the set of actions available.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: convolution to extract local spatio-temporal features in order to obtain fine-grained motion details.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
