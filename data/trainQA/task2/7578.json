Several works leverage DNN quantization to construct high-performing, efficient DNNs [ref]17 [ref]18 [ref]19  .\n studies quantization-aware training strategies to facilitate post-training DNN quantization,  adopts learnable approaches for DNN quantization, and [ref]19 applies adaptive precision to different DNN components (e.g., layers or filters) during inference.\nBinary and ternary DNNs have also been studied  .\nFor GNNs, a few works have studied post-training quantization  , but quantized training of GNNs has not been considered. Quantized Training. Several works, as in     , pioneer low precision DNN training, finding that quantized training at a static, low level yields significant time and energy savings.\nLater work explores adaptive precision throughout training  .\nSuch methods can be applied on top of static quantization schemes and are found to yield gains in efficiency and model performance, by dynamically lowering precision below that of static techniques during training. Critical Learning Periods. Critical learning periods within deep neural networks describe the early training epochs, during which the network is most sensitive to learning impairments.\nEarly work on critical learning periods found that neural networks trained over blurry images for a sufficient number of epochs could never recover the accuracy of a network trained normally .\nSubsequent work studied different forms of training impairments, such as improper regularization and non-i.i.d. data  .\nWork on critical learning periods reveals that learning deficits during an initial, sensitive phase of training yield a permanent degradation in performance, no matter the amount of training performed after removing the deficit. Hyperparameter Schedules.\nMost state-of-the-art results on deep learning benchmarks use curated hyperparameter schedules  .\nScheduling is commonly used for hyperparameters like the learning rate , but the general concept is widely-applied within deep learning.\nFor example, scheduling approaches have been proposed for mini-batch sizes , image spatial resolution , the amount of regularization , and more.\nBest practices for hyperparameter scheduling have been established through extensive empirical analysis; e.g., for the learning rate  , momentum , and even batch size and weight decay .\nOur work aims to provide empirical analysis that establishes such best practices for low precision training.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: Neural Network Quantization. Several works leverage DNN quantization to construct high-performing, efficient DNNs [ref]17 [ref]18 [ref]19  .\n studies quantization-aware training strategies to facilitate post-training DNN quantization,  adopts learnable approaches for DNN quantization, and [ref]19 applies\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
