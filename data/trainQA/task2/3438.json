      "content": "Paper Title: MetaKG: Meta-learning on Knowledge Graph for Cold-start Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInspired by the human-learning, meta-learning  could learn the prior knowledge across different tasks and then quickly adapt the learned prior knowledge to new tasks. Specifically, meta-learning is often employed to learn a learner, which can adapt to new tasks even when there is only a few training samples. Therefore, meta-learning has achieved great success in few-shot learning settings [ref]30  [ref]5 . The existing work on meta-learning can be broadly divided into three categories: metric-based, memory-based, and optimization-based methods. The metric-based methods aim to learn a metric to evaluate the distance between instances. Siamese Network  capitalizes on powerful discriminative features with a convolutional architecture and distance layer.\nPrototypical Network  learns a metric space in which classification tasks can be performed by Euclidean distance computation to prototype representations of each class. However, the metric-based methods are mostly designed for classification problems, which are unsuitable for recommendation analytics involving prediction tasks. The memory-based methods exploit memory architectures or specially-designed training processes to store key knowledge that can be generalized to new tasks. For example, MANN  introduces a memory-augmented model that can ingratiate significant short-term and long-term memory demands.\nSNAIL [ref]29 proposes a generic meta learner which combines temporal convolutions and soft attention to aggregate and memorize specific information for new unseen data. Nonetheless, these memory-based methods rely on extra memory mechanisms, resulting in too many parameters to tune. Finally, the optimization-based methods learn parameters that are conducive to fast gradient-based adaptation to new tasks, which achieve the state-of-the-art performance. In this category,\nMAML [ref]5 learns a good initialization from a base model. In that case, the adapted model can achieve strong generalization performance after applying a few gradient steps.\nIn this paper, we utilize the optimization-based meta-learning, as to be discussed in Section 3.2. Inspired by the success of meta-learning, researchers start devoting efforts to address the cold-start recommendations   . MeLU  uses the MAML framework [ref]5 for cold-start recommendations, and provides a candidate selection strategy for customized preference estimation. MetaHIN  proposes semantic-wise and task-wise adaptation to explore the semantics in heterogeneous networks. Moreover, specific scenarios (such as CTR prediction   and clinical risk prediction ) are also investigated. However, these methods only consider one meta leaner to learn one optimization target (i.e., the rating loss), which are not feasible for KG-based recommendation since it is necessary to simultaneously capture the prior collaborative and knowledge information for user preference learning, and the simple model architectures of these methods are unable to capture the high-order relations between users and items.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: is often employed to learn a learner, which can adapt to new tasks even when there is only a few training samples.
