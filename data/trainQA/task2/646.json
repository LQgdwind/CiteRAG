      "content": "Paper Title: Improved Approximation Factor for Adaptive Influence Maximization via Simple Greedy Strategies\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the Influence Maximization (IM) problem, we are given a social network, a stochastic model for diffusion of influence over the network, and a budget kùëòk, and we ask to find a set of kùëòk nodes, called seeds, that maximize their spread of influence, which is the expected number of nodes reached by a cascade of influence diffusion generated by the seeds according to the given diffusion model. One of the most studied models for influence diffusion is the Independent Cascade (IC), where each edge is associated with an independent probability of transmitting influence from the source node to the tail node. In the IC model the spread of influence is a monotone submodular function of the seed set, therefore a greedy algorithm, which iteratively selects a seed with maximum marginal gain, guarantees a 1‚àí1e11ùëí1-\\frac{1}{e} approximation factor for the IM problem¬†.\nSince its definition by Domingos and Richardson¬†  and formalization as an optimization problem by Kempe et al.¬† , the IM problem and its variants have been extensively investigated, motivated by applications in viral marketing¬†, adoption of technological innovations¬†, and outbreak or failure detection¬†. See¬†[ref]9 [ref]30 for surveys on the IM problem. Recently, Golovin and Krause¬† initiated the study of the IM problem under the framework of adaptive optimization, where, instead of selecting all the seeds at once at the beginning of the process, we can select one seed at a time and observe, to some extent, the portion of the network reached by a new selected seed. The advantage is that the decision on the next seed to choose can be based on the observed spread of previously selected seeds, usually called feedback.\nTwo main feedback models have been introduced: in the full-adoption feedback the whole spread from each seed can be observed, while, in the myopic feedback, one can only observe the direct neighbors of each seed. Golovin and Krause¬† considered the Independent Cascade model and showed that, under full-adoption feedback, the objective function satisfies the property of adaptive submodularity (introduced in the same paper) and therefore an adaptive greedy algorithm achieves a 1‚àí1e11ùëí1-\\frac{1}{e} approximation factor for the adaptive IM problem. In their arXiv version, they retracted a claim (appeared in their previous conference version) in which they mistakenly showed that the adaptive submodularity holds even under the myopic feedback model, and this property would have guaranteed that the adaptive greedy is a constant factor approximation algorithm (under the myopic feedback model). Anyway, they conjectured that there exists a constant factor approximation algorithm for the myopic feedback model, which indeed has been found by Peng and Chen¬† who showed that both the adaptive and non-adaptive greedy algorithms guarantee a 14‚Äã(1‚àí1e)1411ùëí\\frac{1}{4}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{e}\\right)-approximation. In particular, they showed that the adaptivity gap, which is the supremum, over all possible inputs, of the ratio between the spread of an optimal adaptive policy and that of an optimal non-adaptive one, is upper-bounded by 4. By combining this bound with the approximation factor of both the adaptive and non-adaptive greedy algorithms for the non-adaptive problem they obtain a 14‚Äã(1‚àí1e)1411ùëí\\frac{1}{4}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{e}\\right)-approximation factor. To prove their upper-bound on the adaptivity gap, Peng and Chen use an approach that is inspired by Bradac et al.¬†[ref]5, which in turn is based on the approach introduced by Gupta et al.¬†  in the context of stochastic probing. To relate a non-adaptive solution to an optimal adaptive one, they consider the decision tree of an optimal adaptive solution and construct a non-adaptive policy by performing a random root-leaf walk in the tree, according to a probability distribution induced by the tree. Note that computing the non-adaptive policy that guarantees the upper-bound on the adaptivity gap would require to know an optimal decision tree. However, this approach only requires to show the existence of such a non-adaptive policy since it allows us to bound the adaptivity gap and non-adaptive approximation factor is obtained by combining the non-adaptive approximation factor with the adaptivity gap. In the same paper, Peng and Chen showed that both the adaptive greedy and the non-adaptive greedy algorithms cannot achieve a factor better than e2+1(e+1)2<0.607<1‚àí1esuperscriptùëí21superscriptùëí120.60711ùëí\\frac{e^{2}+1}{(e+1)^{2}}<0.607<1-\\frac{1}{e} of the adaptive optimum, and that the adaptivity gap is at least ee‚àí1‚âà1.582ùëíùëí11.582\\frac{e}{e-1}\\approx 1.582. In¬†, the same authors showed some upper and lower bounds on the adaptivity gap in the case of full-adoption feedback, still under independent cascade, for some particular graph classes. In order to show these bounds, they followed an approach introduced by Asadpour and Nazerzadeh¬† which consists in transforming an adaptive policy into a non-adaptive one by means of multilinear extensions, and constructing a Poisson process to relate the influence spread of the non-adaptive policy to that of the adaptive one. For general graphs, a non-constant upper bound for the adaptivity gap under the full-adoption feedback has been recently shown in .\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: , the IM problem and its variants have been extensively investigated, motivated by applications in viral marketing¬†, adoption of technological innovations¬†, and outbreak or failure detection¬†.
