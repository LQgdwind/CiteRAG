      "content": "Paper Title: Refining Low-Resource Unsupervised Translation by Language Disentanglement of Multilingual Model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFully unsupervised machine translation (UMT), where absolutely only unlabeled monolingual corpora are used in the entire model training process, has gained significant traction in recent years. Early success in UMT has been built on the foundation of cross-lingual initialization and iterative back-translation   [ref]9  . While achieving outstanding performance on empirically high-resource languages, such as German and French, these UMT methods fail to produce any meaningful translation (near zero BLEU scores) when adopted in low-resource cases, like the FLoRes Nepali and Sinhala unsupervised translation tasks . Arguably, such low-resource languages need UMT the most. Liu et¬†al. [ref]21 discovered that low-resource UMT models benefit significantly when they are initialized with a multilingual generative model (mBART), which is pre-trained on massive monolingual corpora from 25 languages (CC25). Not only does this multilingual pre-training set contain data of the low-resource languages of interest (e.g., Nepali), it also comprises sentences from related languages (e.g.,¬†Hindi), which presumably boosts the performance of their low-resource siblings. Tran et¬†al. [ref]31 and Nguyen et¬†al.  later propose ways to mine pseudo-parallel data from multiple directions to improve low-resource UMT. On the other hand, Conneau et¬†al.  find the curse of multilinguality, which states that performance of a multilingual model with a fixed model capacity tends to decline after a point as the number of languages in the training data increases. Thus, adding more languages may hinder further improvement in low-resource UMT, which is intuitively due to incompatibility between the linguistic structures of different languages. Furthermore, these models have to tell languages apart by using only a single-token language specifier prepended into the input sequence, which is shown to be insufficient . Our analysis also shows that the models sometimes predict words of the wrong language (see Appendix). Meanwhile, as shown later in our analyses (section¬†4.4), other complementary techniques such as pseudo-parallel data mining may have reached their limits in improving low-resource UMT. To alleviate the curse of multilinguality and work around the linguistic incompatibility issue in low-resource UMT, we propose a simple refinement strategy aimed at disentangling, or separating, irrelevant languages from a pre-trained multilingual unsupervised model, namely CRISS [ref]31, and focusing exclusively on a number of low-resource UMT directions. Briefly, our method consists of four stages. In the first stage, we use a modified back-translation technique  to finetune an initial pre-trained multilingual UMT model on English (En) and a family of low-resource languages ‚Ñí‚Ñí{\\mathcal{L}} with a different set of feed-forward layers in the decoder for each E‚Äãn‚Üî‚Ñí‚Üîùê∏ùëõ‚ÑíEn\\leftrightarrow{\\mathcal{L}} pair. This step aims at discarding irrelevant languages and separating the languages ‚Ñí‚Ñí{\\mathcal{L}} from each other. The second stage separates the resulting E‚Äãn‚Üî‚Ñí‚Üîùê∏ùëõ‚ÑíEn\\leftrightarrow{\\mathcal{L}} model into two E‚Äãn‚Üí‚Ñí‚Üíùê∏ùëõ‚ÑíEn\\rightarrow{\\mathcal{L}} and ‚Ñí‚ÜíE‚Äãn‚Üí‚Ñíùê∏ùëõ{\\mathcal{L}}\\rightarrow En models. This stage is motivated by the fact that English is often vastly distinct from low-resource languages ‚Ñí‚Ñí{\\mathcal{L}}, thus requiring a greater degree of disentanglement and less parameter sharing. The third stage boosts the performance by using the second-stage models as fixed translators for the back-translation process. The final stage, which is only applied to from-English directions, is aimed to separate the target low-resource languages between themselves into different models. Overall, our method prioritises to maximize the individual performance of each low-resource task, though the trade-off is that it can no longer translate multiple languages in a one-for-all manner. In our experiments, our method establishes the state of the art in fully unsupervised translation tasks of English (En) to Nepali (Ne), Sinhala (Si), Gujarati (Gu), Latvian (Lv), Estonian (Et) and Kazakh (Kk) with BLEU scores of 9.0, 9.5, 17.5, 18.5, 21.0 and 10.0 respectively, and vice versa. This is up to 4.5 BLEU improvement from the previous state of the art [ref]31. We also show that the method outperforms other related alternatives that attempt to achieve language separation in various low-resource unsupervised tasks. Plus, our ablation analyses demonstrate the importance of different stages of our method, especially the English separation stage (stage 2).\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: entire model training process, has gained significant traction in recent years.
