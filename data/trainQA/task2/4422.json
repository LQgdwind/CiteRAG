      "content": "Paper Title: A general-purpose method for applying Explainable AI for Anomaly Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs defined in Section 2, an explanation function accepts an AD model F𝐹F, an observation x𝑥x, and the model’s score of the observation F​(x)𝐹𝑥F(x), and returns a variable attribution on the input data, B​(x)𝐵𝑥B(x). In this section, we propose multiple desirable properties of an explanation function, and then evaluate various methods for suitability. First, an explanation function must be contrastive, as defined by [ref]20. In this work, we extend the definition with an approach that provides constructive explanations. In AD, observation x𝑥x is anomalous, so the suitable explanation would be based on a contrastive normal point x′superscript𝑥′x^{\\prime}, selected as discussed in 4.3 from the exemplar set. Second, an explanation function must be conservative (as in Definition 2, ) or, equivalently, complete (as in the the Completeness Axiom of  or Efficiency Axiom in , where the sum of attributions equals the difference in classification scores between the baseline and observed points: ∑d∈DBd​(x,x′)=F​(x′)−F​(x)subscript𝑑𝐷subscript𝐵𝑑𝑥superscript𝑥′𝐹superscript𝑥′𝐹𝑥\\sum_{d\\in D}B_{d}(x,x^{\\prime})=F(x^{\\prime})-F(x). Third, an explanation function for local explanations must satisfy sensitivity, first in the sense of , which states that any dimension that changes the prediction when its value is altered should also have a non-zero attribution. Further, any dimension that induces no change to the prediction when perturbed (i.e., dummy variable) should have a zero attribution. Fourth, the explanation should satisfy proportionality111Proportionality in this work is different from Proportionality defined in , since proportionality in the latter refers to a condition under which the dimensional components of the distance between a baseline point and an observation is proportional to the attribution.; this is elaborated next. Given a path P𝑃P from x𝑥x to x​’𝑥’x\\textquoteright, dimension u𝑢u has a stronger influence on F𝐹F than dimension v𝑣v over P𝑃P if the average (or overall) rate of change of F𝐹F along dimension u𝑢u is greater than the average (or overall) rate of change of F𝐹F along dimension v𝑣v. If P𝑃P is the path defined by z=x+α​(x′−x)𝑧𝑥𝛼superscript𝑥′𝑥z=x+\\alpha(x^{\\prime}-x) for α∈ 𝛼01\\alpha\\in , between x𝑥x and x′superscript𝑥′x^{\\prime}, then the overall rate of change of F𝐹F along dimension u𝑢u over path P𝑃P is I​Gu​(x,x′)≡∫01(x′−x)u​∇uF​(x+α​(x′−x))​𝑑α𝐼subscript𝐺𝑢𝑥superscript𝑥′superscriptsubscript01subscriptsuperscript𝑥′𝑥𝑢subscript∇𝑢𝐹𝑥𝛼superscript𝑥′𝑥differential-d𝛼IG_{u}(x,x^{\\prime})\\equiv\\int_{0}^{1}(x^{\\prime}-x)_{u}\\nabla_{u}F(x+\\alpha(x^{\\prime}-x))\\,d\\alpha. This is justified by taking G​(α)=F​(z)=F​(x+α​(x′−x))𝐺𝛼𝐹𝑧𝐹𝑥𝛼superscript𝑥′𝑥G(\\alpha)=F(z)=F(x+\\alpha(x^{\\prime}-x)), and observing that that is, the sum of dimensional rates of change of F𝐹F over path P𝑃P. Therefore, the instantaneous rate of change of F𝐹F at a point z=x+α​(x′−x)𝑧𝑥𝛼superscript𝑥′𝑥z=x+\\alpha(x^{\\prime}-x) along dimension u𝑢u is ∇uF×(x′−x)usubscript∇𝑢𝐹subscriptsuperscript𝑥′𝑥𝑢\\nabla_{u}F\\times(x^{\\prime}-x)_{u}, and thus the overall rate of change along dimension u𝑢u is the integral of the instantaneous rate of change of F𝐹F over the path. Therefore, Definition 2 becomes: Given a path P=(x+α​(x′−x))𝑃𝑥𝛼superscript𝑥′𝑥P=(x+\\alpha(x^{\\prime}-x)) from x𝑥x to x′superscript𝑥′x^{\\prime}, dimension u𝑢u has a stronger influence on F𝐹F than dimension v𝑣v over P𝑃P if that is, dimension u𝑢u has a stronger influence on F𝐹F than dimension v𝑣v over P𝑃P if I​Gu​(x,x′)>I​Gv​(x,x′)𝐼subscript𝐺𝑢𝑥superscript𝑥′𝐼subscript𝐺𝑣𝑥superscript𝑥′IG_{u}(x,x^{\\prime})>IG_{v}(x,x^{\\prime}). An explanation function B​(x,x′)𝐵𝑥superscript𝑥′B(x,x^{\\prime}) is proportional on observation x∈ℝD𝑥superscriptℝ𝐷x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D} if for any dimension u𝑢u that has a stronger influence on F𝐹F than another dimension v𝑣v over a path P𝑃P from a point x𝑥x to a point x′superscript𝑥′x^{\\prime}, then Bu​(x,x′)>Bv​(x,x′)subscript𝐵𝑢𝑥superscript𝑥′subscript𝐵𝑣𝑥superscript𝑥′B_{u}(x,x^{\\prime})>B_{v}(x,x^{\\prime}). In other words, dimensions that have a stronger influence on the anomaly prediction F𝐹F should have greater attributions than dimensions that have a weaker influence. Proportionality enables ranking and thresholding of dimensions. We evaluated LIME , SHAP 8, Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP)  , Deep Taylor Decomposition (DTD) 3, One Class Deep Taylor Decomposition (OC-DTD) 3 and Integrated Gradients (IG) against contrastive, conservative, sensitivity and proportionality desiderata. Details and jstification are provided in Appendix 0.D. LIME, LRP, and most implementations of SHAP are not contrastive 9. DTD, OC-DTD make approximate the gradient as a linaerly, and are not guaranteed to satisfy proportionality. IG does not specify a fully defined method for choosing a baseline point. Instead, its authors provided general guidelines for selecting a good baseline, where a good baseline point should have nearly opposite scores as the point of interest (i.e., if F​(x)≈1𝐹𝑥1F(x)\\approx 1, then F​(x′)≈0𝐹superscript𝑥′0F(x^{\\prime})\\approx 0, or vice-versa). Therefore, IG provides a contrastive explanation against the set of all baseline points that have significantly contrastive scores. Because it applies a path integral between x𝑥x and x′superscript𝑥′x^{\\prime}, IG accurately approximates the gradient, is conservative, and meets sensitivity criteria . In addition, by computing the path gradient for each dimension, IG also satisfies proportionality (as shown in Theorem 4.2). Therefore, because it satisfies each desideratum, we propose IG is a suitable explanation function for AD. Integrated Gradients satisfies proportionality, as defined in Definition 3. Proof is provided in Appendix 0.C.2.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: section, we propose multiple desirable properties of an explanation function, and then evaluate various methods for suitability.
