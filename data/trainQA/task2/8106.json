      "content": "Paper Title: LibMOON: A Gradient-based MultiObjective OptimizatioN Library in PyTorch\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn addition to optimizing the single-objective aggregation function, a number of gradient manipulation methods adjust gradients and compute update directions to ensure solutions satisfy specific properties.\nThese methods can be summarized as follows: the update direction 𝒅𝒅{\\bm{d}} is a dynamically weighted sum of gradient vectors , expressed as 𝒅=∑i=1mα~i⋅∇Li​(𝜽)𝒅superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑚⋅subscript~𝛼𝑖∇subscript𝐿𝑖𝜽{\\bm{d}}=\\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\tilde{\\alpha}_{i}\\cdot\\nabla L_{i}({\\bm{\\theta}}).\nEquivalently, updating the direction involves optimizing a generalized aggregation function. As listed in Table 3, notable methods using gradient manipulations include EPO  for finding “exact Pareto solutions” (intersection points of Pareto front and preference vectors), HVGrad [ref]39 for maximizing hypervolume, MGDA-UB  for finding directions beneficial to all objectives, MOO-SVGD [ref]19 for diverse solutions, PMGDA [ref]40 for Pareto solutions satisfying specific user requirement, and PMTL  for sector-constrained Pareto solutions. In LibMOON , multiple gradient manipulation methods are implemented by first calculating dynamic weight factors α~isubscript~𝛼𝑖\\tilde{\\alpha}_{i} and then performing backpropagation on the generalized function g~𝝀​(𝑳​(𝜽))subscript~𝑔𝝀𝑳𝜽\\tilde{g}_{\\bm{\\lambda}}({\\bm{L}}({\\bm{\\theta}})) to update the parameters of neural network. Those weight factors α~isubscript~𝛼𝑖\\tilde{\\alpha}_{i} are typically computed by solving a linear programming (LP) problem (e.g., [Eq. 24], [ref]40[Eq. 16]), a quadratic programming (QP) problem (e.g., [Eq. 14], [Eq. 3]), or through other methods like hypervolume gradient estimation . Some methods use user-specific preference vectors as input, making the aggregation function dependent on preference 𝝀𝝀{\\bm{\\lambda}}, while others do not (preference-free optimizers). A summary of whether an optimizer is preference-based or preference-free is provided in Table 3. LibMOON not only supports first-order optimization when the gradients of those objective functions are known, but also supports zero-order optimization methods with estimated gradients ∇^​Li​(𝜽)^∇subscript𝐿𝑖𝜽\\hat{\\nabla}L_{i}({\\bm{\\theta}}) using methods such evolutionary strategy (ES) .\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: function.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
