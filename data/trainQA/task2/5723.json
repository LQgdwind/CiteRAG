      "content": "Paper Title: Zero-Shot Contrastive Loss for Text-Guided Diffusion Image Style Transfer\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStyle transfer is the task that converts the style of a given image into another style while preserving its content. Over the past few years, GAN-based methods such as pix2pix 8, cycleGAN , and contrastive unpaired image-to-image translation (CUT) have been developed .\nRecently, joint use of a pretrained image generator and image-text encoder enabled text-guided image editing which requires little or no training of the networks [ref]29    . Inspired by the success of diffusion models for image generation  , image editing , in-painting , super-resolution , etc.,\nmany researchers have recently investigated the application of the diffusion models for image-to-image style transfer  [ref]34.\nFor example,   proposed\nconditional diffusion models that require paired dataset for image-to-image style transfer.\nOne of the limitations of these approaches is that\nthe diffusion models need to be trained with paired data set with matched source and target styles.\nAs collecting matched source and target domain data is impractical,\nmany recent researchers have focused on unconditional diffusion models.\nUnconditional diffusion models have limitations in maintaining content due to the stochastic nature of the reverse sampling procedure that doesn’t explicitly impose content consistency. As a result, content and styles can change simultaneously, creating challenges for maintaining content. To tackle this problem, the dual diffusion implicit bridge (DDIB) [ref]34 exploits two score functions that have been independently trained on two different domains. Although DDIB can translate one image into another without any external condition, it also requires training of two diffusion models for each domain which involves additional training time and a large amount of dataset. On the other hand,\nDiffusionCLIP  leverages the pretrained diffusion models and CLIP encoder to enable\ntext-driven image style transfer without additional large training data set. Unfortunately,\nDiffusionCLIP still requires additional fine-tuning of the model for the desired style.\nFurthermore, DiffuseIT  uses disentangled style and content representation inspired by the slicing Vision Transformer . Although DiffuseIT has shown its superiority in preserving content, it still suffers from the trade-off between transforming the texture of images and maintaining the content. Also, an additional network is required for computing content losses in DiffuseIT. To address this problem, here we propose a simple yet effective Zero-shot Contrastive (ZeCon) loss for diffusion models to transfer the style of a given image while preserving its semantic content in a zero-shot manner. Our approach is based on the observation that a pre-trained diffusion model already contains spatial information in its embedding that can be used to maintain content through patch-wise contrastive loss between the input image and generated images. Unlike DiffusionCLIP, our method doesn’t require additional training. In other words, we could effectively preserve the content in a zero-shot manner by leveraging the patch-wise contrastive loss. Furthermore, unlike DiffuseIT, our method achieves more accurate texture modification while preserving the content. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we show a text-driven style transfer using CLIP [ref]29. However, our method can be extended for general guidance beyond text inputs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method can be applied to text-driven image-to-image translation and image manipulation tasks, illustrating its wide applicability.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: (CUT) have been developed .\nRecently, joint use of a pretrained image generator and image-text encoder enabled text-guided image editing which requires little or no training of the networks [ref]29    .
