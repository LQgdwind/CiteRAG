      "content": "Paper Title: Spatz: Clustering Compact RISC-V-Based Vector Units to Maximize Computing Efficiency\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIncreasing memory capacity to lower the bandwidth requirements at a higher level of the memory hierarchy is a fundamental trade-off found in several architectures. For instance, GPUs have a large multi-context register file allowing for fast context switching between many concurrent threads. Each SM of Nvidia’s Hopper GPUs has a \\qty[quantity-product=-]256 Ki -large register file to hold the context of up to 204820482048 threads . Therefore, a considerable design effort is dedicated to concurrently optimizing the capacity, bandwidth, reliability, and power consumption of such large register files . Table II compares our PPA metrics against the Snitch cluster [ref]21 and Ara . Spatz is highly competitive in sustained fraction of peak performance, as well as in energy efficiency. At a scale much smaller than GPUs, IoT end nodes require high performance and energy efficiency under a tight power budget to execute edge-AI workloads. In this scenario, the Single Instruction, Multiple Thread (SIMT) computation paradigm of GPUs is hard to leverage, as it requires a massive amount of multi-threaded parallelism (and, therefore, a very large register file). Typical IoT end nodes exploit the SIMD computing paradigm over a moderate amount of functional units. For example, Dustin  proposes a configurable Vector Lockstep Execution Mode (VLEM), in which its 161616 \\qty[quantity-product=-]32 cores are synchronized, and a single instruction fetch controls all 161616 datapaths. Therefore, Dustin can achieve the high energy efficiency of packed-SIMD architectures, while keeping the flexibility of the Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data (MIMD) paradigm. In VLEM mode, the register files of the scalar cores act as a single, \\qty[quantity-product=-]512-wide register file. Unlike Spatz, Dustin was designed for low-precision (e.g., \\qty[quantity-product=-]2) integer computation. However, its architecture highlights the trend of compact processing elements exploiting SIMD computation. Intel’s Advanced Vector Extension (AVX) family of ISAs also exploits the packed-SIMD paradigm. Its widest ISA variant proposes 323232 \\qty[quantity-product=-]512-wide registers  on Intel’s line of high-performance processors. With the recent introduction of the AVX10 ISA, Intel introduces a common vector ISA on the high-performance (P) product lines (e.g., Intel Xeon) and the to-be-introduced high-efficiency (E) product line, with a shorter \\qty[quantity-product=-]256 vector length on the latter . It is important to note that all packed-SIMD solutions tie the register file width to the number of functional units in the system, thus the L0 capacity of the GPR is not available as an architectural tuning knob, once the ISA is defined. The vector-SIMD paradigm provides a clean abstraction to separate the VRF capacity from the architecture’s programming model. Specifically, the same software can run on any vector machine thanks to VLA parametrization: programs automatically adjust their execution to exploit the longest possible vector, which is impossible with packed-SIMD architectures  and prohibitively expensive with GPUs. Therefore, vector processors present the unique characteristic of allowing a full exploration of the memory capacity and bandwidth trade-off. Many vector processing units have been proposed in recent years, thanks to new vector ISAs such as Arm’s Scalable Vector Extension (SVE)  and RISC-V’s RVV [ref]20. Examples of such large-scale vector architectures based on the RVV ISA include BSC’s Vitruvius , PULP Platform’s Ara , and SiFive’s P270  and X280  cores, to name a few. Ultimately, the long history of vector processing limited its application to the PEs of a compact shared-L1 cluster. From its inception with the Cray-1  to the modern Fujitsu’s Fugaku , vector processing has always been associated with supercomputers. Thus, vector processors usually include all microarchitectural tricks to increase Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP), e.g., renaming, out-of-order execution, speculation, and branch prediction, which increase the area and energy overhead of classical high-performance vector processors. As a result, typical vector processors are implemented with very long vectors to amortize not only the VNB but also the massive overheads of complex instruction issue mechanisms  . The energy efficiency of these high-performance vector processors is encumbered by their heavy-duty microarchitecture. For instance, Fujitsu’s A64FX achieves about \\qty16 G DP/ in a \\qty7 n  node , much lower than the energy efficiency of the Spatz cluster despite a more scaled technology node. However, the defining characteristic of a vector processor is not ILP but Data Level Parallelism (DLP). This key observation led to the design of streamlined vector cores where most hardware resources are dedicated to DLP support . In this vein, the idea of an embedded vector machine is gaining traction with modern vector ISAs. Arm’s M-Profile Vector Extension (MVE)  and the 𝚉𝚟𝚎∗\\mathtt{Zve*} subset of RISC-V’s RVV ISA [ref]20 target small vector machines for edge processing. Arm’s Helium MVE is an optional extension proposed as part of the Armv8.1-M architecture . The Arm Cortex-M55  is the first processor to ship with support to MVE. However, no quantitative assessment of the performance and efficiency of a Cortex-M55 silicon implementation has been reported in the open literature; hence, a quantitative comparison with Spatz is impossible. For what concerns a qualitative comparison, we observe that the Helium MVE defines eight \\qty[quantity-product=-]128 wide vector registers as aliases to the floating-point register file. On the M55 processor, the \\qty[quantity-product=-]64 datapath means Helium operates on a “dual-beat regime,” i.e., vector instructions execute in two cycles. This is enough to overlap the execution of successive vector instructions in different processing units without a superscalar core. However, the scalar core must frequently issue instructions to the Helium-capable processing unit to keep its pipeline busy. In contrast, Spatz’ longer vector registers and RVV’s LMUL register grouping allow for a maximum vector length of 409640964096 bits, keeping Spatz busy for 323232 cycles. This long execution, as shown by our results, massively amortizes the energy overhead of the scalar core, which is a considerable part of the overall energy consumption even on extremely data-parallel kernels such as the matrix multiplication. In general, architectures based on a tightly-coupled cluster of small vector processors have not been explored in past literature, possibly due to the novelty of small vector machines. Small-scale vector units have been proposed for Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), where the leanness of the vector processor is a constraint due to limited FPGA resources. Vicuna [ref]46 is a timing-predictable RVV-compliant vector processor, synthesized on a Xilinx Series 7 FPGA. Its VRF was implemented as a multi-ported Random-Access Memory (RAM) due to concerns with timing anomalies with a multi-banked VRF. Vicuna’s largest configuration achieves up to \\qty117/ on an \\qty[quantity-product=-]8 \\numproduct1024x1024 matrix multiplication kernel. Vicuna’s multi-ported VRF is similar to Spatz’ VRF. There is no study about Vicuna’s scaling nor an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) implementation of this architecture, making a power or energy efficiency comparison with Spatz difficult. The same can be said about other small-scale RVV vector units demonstrated on FPGAs  .\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: effort is dedicated to concurrently optimizing the capacity, bandwidth, reliability, and power consumption of such large register files .
