As stated in Section 3.2, we know that for any u∈f​(K)𝑢𝑓𝐾u\\in f(K), the number mp​(u)subscript𝑚𝑝𝑢m_{p}(u) of critical p𝑝p-simplices of 𝒱𝒱{\\mathcal{V}} in Lusubscript𝐿𝑢L_{u} is at least rank⁡Hp​(K​(u),⋃u′⪵uK​(u′))ranksubscript𝐻𝑝𝐾𝑢subscriptprecedes-and-not-equalssuperscript𝑢′𝑢𝐾superscript𝑢′\\operatorname{rank}H_{p}(K(u),\\bigcup_{u^{\\prime}\\precneqq u}K(u^{\\prime})). This expression can be rewritten in terms of Lusubscript𝐿𝑢L_{u}. Indeed, notice that ⋃u′⪵uK​(u′)subscriptprecedes-and-not-equalssuperscript𝑢′𝑢𝐾superscript𝑢′\\bigcup_{u^{\\prime}\\precneqq u}K(u^{\\prime}) is simply K​(u)\\Lu\\𝐾𝑢subscript𝐿𝑢K(u)\\backslash L_{u}. Then, using the excision theorem (see ) to excise K​(u)\\Cl⁡Lu\\𝐾𝑢Clsubscript𝐿𝑢K(u)\\backslash\\operatorname{Cl}L_{u}, we see that which leads to the next proposition. Let 𝒱𝒱{\\mathcal{V}} be combinatorial vector field compatible with a multifiltering function f:K→ℝk:𝑓→𝐾superscriptℝ𝑘f:K\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}}^{k}. For all u∈f​(K)𝑢𝑓𝐾u\\in f(K), if H∗​(Cl⁡Lu,Ex⁡Lu)subscript𝐻Clsubscript𝐿𝑢Exsubscript𝐿𝑢H_{*}\\big{(}\\operatorname{Cl}L_{u},\\operatorname{Ex}L_{u}\\big{)} is nonzero, then 𝒱𝒱{\\mathcal{V}} has a critical simplex in Lusubscript𝐿𝑢L_{u}. Conversely, if 𝒱𝒱{\\mathcal{V}} is perfect relatively to f𝑓f and has a critical simplex in Lusubscript𝐿𝑢L_{u}, then H∗​(Cl⁡Lu,Ex⁡Lu)subscript𝐻Clsubscript𝐿𝑢Exsubscript𝐿𝑢H_{*}\\big{(}\\operatorname{Cl}L_{u},\\operatorname{Ex}L_{u}\\big{)} is nonzero. This motivates the following definition. For a multifiltering function f:K→ℝk:𝑓→𝐾superscriptℝ𝑘f:K\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}}^{k}, we say u∈f​(K)𝑢𝑓𝐾u\\in f(K) is a Pareto critical value of f𝑓f if the relative homology H∗​(Cl⁡Lu,Ex⁡Lu)subscript𝐻Clsubscript𝐿𝑢Exsubscript𝐿𝑢H_{*}(\\operatorname{Cl}L_{u},\\operatorname{Ex}L_{u}) is nonzero. Similarly, σ∈K𝜎𝐾\\sigma\\in K is Pareto critical for f𝑓f if it belongs in a connected component C𝐶C of Lf​(σ)subscript𝐿𝑓𝜎L_{f(\\sigma)} such that H∗​(Cl⁡C,Ex⁡C)subscript𝐻Cl𝐶Ex𝐶H_{*}(\\operatorname{Cl}C,\\operatorname{Ex}C) is nonzero. The Pareto critical simplices of f𝑓f constitute the Pareto set of f𝑓f, noted 𝒫fsubscript𝒫𝑓\\mathcal{P}_{f}. When f𝑓f is the max-extension of a component-wise injective vertex map, each level set Lusubscript𝐿𝑢L_{u} is connected. Thus, when assuming this hypothesis, we have that σ∈K𝜎𝐾\\sigma\\in K is Pareto critical iff f​(σ)𝑓𝜎f(\\sigma) is a Pareto critical value. In the original setting  , a Pareto set is defined using concepts of differential topology, so our proposed definition may seem somewhat unrelated. Nonetheless, as mentioned earlier, in the smooth setting, it was shown that the Pareto set of a smooth vector-valued map is directly linked to the homological changes in the multifiltration induced by this map   . Moreover, it is rather common to use homology to characterize singularities in other discrete settings. Notably, it is done in PL Morse theory in order to define both critical points of real-valued functions  [ref]44  and critical (Jacobi) sets of vector-valued mappings . Our definition is also inspired from the theory of combinatorial multivector fields, which provides discrete analogues to many concepts from smooth dynamics 1. Indeed, consider a multifiltering function f:K→ℝk:𝑓→𝐾superscriptℝ𝑘f:K\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}}^{k} and some u∈f​(K)𝑢𝑓𝐾u\\in f(K). For any two simplices σ≤σ′𝜎superscript𝜎′\\sigma\\leq\\sigma^{\\prime}, if f​(σ)=f​(σ′)=u𝑓𝜎𝑓superscript𝜎′𝑢f(\\sigma)=f(\\sigma^{\\prime})=u, then for all τ∈K𝜏𝐾\\tau\\in K such that σ≤τ≤σ′𝜎𝜏superscript𝜎′\\sigma\\leq\\tau\\leq\\sigma^{\\prime}, we have f​(τ)=u𝑓𝜏𝑢f(\\tau)=u because f​(σ)⪯f​(τ)⪯f​(σ′)precedes-or-equals𝑓𝜎𝑓𝜏precedes-or-equals𝑓superscript𝜎′f(\\sigma)\\preceq f(\\tau)\\preceq f(\\sigma^{\\prime}) by the definition of a multifiltering function. Hence, σ,σ′∈Lu𝜎superscript𝜎′subscript𝐿𝑢\\sigma,\\sigma^{\\prime}\\in L_{u} implies τ∈Lu𝜏subscript𝐿𝑢\\tau\\in L_{u} whenever σ≤τ≤σ′𝜎𝜏superscript𝜎′\\sigma\\leq\\tau\\leq\\sigma^{\\prime}, meaning that Lusubscript𝐿𝑢L_{u} is convex with respect to the face relation in K𝐾K. In other words, each Lusubscript𝐿𝑢L_{u} is a combinatorial multivector in the sense of 1. Therefore, the partition of K𝐾K in level sets is a well-defined combinatorial multivector field for which each Lusubscript𝐿𝑢L_{u} is a multivector. Finally, a multivector Lusubscript𝐿𝑢L_{u} is defined as critical by Lipiński et al. 1 when H∗​(Cl⁡Lu,Ex⁡Lu)subscript𝐻Clsubscript𝐿𝑢Exsubscript𝐿𝑢H_{*}(\\operatorname{Cl}L_{u},\\operatorname{Ex}L_{u}) is nonzero, so our proposed definition of a Pareto critical value agrees with the combinatorial multivector field theory. To further justify the proposed definition of Pareto singularity, we present concisely the idea of Pareto points for smooth maps and give an interpretation which is common to both discrete and smooth settings. The reader is referred to [ref]46 for more details regarding the basic concepts of differential geometry. Let f=(f1,…,fk):M→ℝk:𝑓subscript𝑓1…subscript𝑓𝑘→𝑀superscriptℝ𝑘f=(f_{1},...,f_{k}):M\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}}^{k} be a smooth map on a manifold M𝑀M and consider some point p∈M𝑝𝑀p\\in M. We say p𝑝p is in the Pareto set θ𝜃\\theta of f𝑓f if there exists no direction in which the gradient vectors of all components fisubscript𝑓𝑖f_{i} at p𝑝p agree. In other words, away from θ𝜃\\theta, all fisubscript𝑓𝑖f_{i} increase in some common direction. For all p∉θ𝑝𝜃p\\notin\\theta and for some small enough neighbourhood U𝑈U of p𝑝p, we could show that this common direction may be represented by the subset {q∈U|fi​(q)>fi​(p)​ for each ​i=1,…,k}conditional-set𝑞𝑈formulae-sequencesubscript𝑓𝑖𝑞subscript𝑓𝑖𝑝 for each 𝑖1…𝑘\\{q\\in U\\ |\\ f_{i}(q)>f_{i}(p)\\text{ for each }i=1,...,k\\}, which is homeomorphic to the intersection of a convex cone with some small neighbourhood, so it is a contractible subset of U𝑈U. An example of such a subset is represented in green in Figure 7a. Generally, this is not true for points p∈θ𝑝𝜃p\\in\\theta. For example, in Figure 7b, we see that the subset {q∈U|fi​(q)>fi​(p)​ for each ​i=1,…,k}conditional-set𝑞𝑈formulae-sequencesubscript𝑓𝑖𝑞subscript𝑓𝑖𝑝 for each 𝑖1…𝑘\\{q\\in U\\ |\\ f_{i}(q)>f_{i}(p)\\text{ for each }i=1,...,k\\} has two distinct components while, in Figure 7c, it is empty. This brings us back to the idea behind the proposed definition of a Pareto critical point of a discrete multifiltering function f:K→ℝk:𝑓→𝐾superscriptℝ𝑘f:K\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}}^{k}. Let σ∈K𝜎𝐾\\sigma\\in K such that f​(σ)=u𝑓𝜎𝑢f(\\sigma)=u. To take the idea of Lipiński et al. 1, the level set Lusubscript𝐿𝑢L_{u} may be seen as a black box inside of which we know nothing of the dynamics. Instead, to understand the behaviour of f𝑓f around σ𝜎\\sigma, we have to look at the boundary of Lusubscript𝐿𝑢L_{u}. Notice that Ex⁡Lu=Cl⁡Lu\\Lu⊆Cl⁡Lu\\Int⁡Lu=Bd⁡LuExsubscript𝐿𝑢Cl\\subscript𝐿𝑢subscript𝐿𝑢Cl\\subscript𝐿𝑢Intsubscript𝐿𝑢Bdsubscript𝐿𝑢\\operatorname{Ex}L_{u}=\\operatorname{Cl}L_{u}\\backslash L_{u}\\subseteq\\operatorname{Cl}L_{u}\\backslash\\operatorname{Int}L_{u}=\\operatorname{Bd}L_{u}, so the exit set Ex⁡LuExsubscript𝐿𝑢\\operatorname{Ex}L_{u} is part of the boundary of Lusubscript𝐿𝑢L_{u}, and from the definition of a multifiltering function, we could show that Ex⁡Lu={τ∈Cl⁡Lu|f​(τ)⪵f​(σ)}Exsubscript𝐿𝑢conditional-set𝜏Clsubscript𝐿𝑢precedes-and-not-equals𝑓𝜏𝑓𝜎\\operatorname{Ex}L_{u}=\\{\\tau\\in\\operatorname{Cl}L_{u}\\ |\\ f(\\tau)\\precneqq f(\\sigma)\\}. Hence, Ex⁡LuExsubscript𝐿𝑢\\operatorname{Ex}L_{u} corresponds to the part of the domain neighbouring σ𝜎\\sigma for which the components of f𝑓f decrease. Thus, when the relative homology of Cl⁡LuClsubscript𝐿𝑢\\operatorname{Cl}L_{u} with respect to Ex⁡LuExsubscript𝐿𝑢\\operatorname{Ex}L_{u} is trivial, we interpret that all components of f𝑓f behave similarly and agree in some common direction around σ𝜎\\sigma, represented by Ex⁡LuExsubscript𝐿𝑢\\operatorname{Ex}L_{u}.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: it is rather common to use homology to characterize singularities in other discrete settings.
