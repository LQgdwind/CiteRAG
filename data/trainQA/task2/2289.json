      "content": "Paper Title: A Generative Model For Raw Audio Using Transformer Architectures\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor comparison against baseline neural generative models, we have chosen the prediction of the next sample as a criterion to compare different models. To quantify the performance, we choose to have top-5 accuracy as a metric. By this, we say that the model is accurate if one of the levels out of the top-5 predictions matches that of the ground truth. Such metrics have been used in error performance where there are many output categories e.g.  . For all the numbers reported in Table 1, we randomly subsample about 30min of data in total duration out of the 50 test tracks. No data augmentation or any other pre-processing was carried out. This is in contrast to what was reported in wavenet, which relied on Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) to quantify the performance of wavenet with that of other generative/audio synthesis algorithms. We reason that the output of a system such as a text-to-speech system is dependent on several variables. For example, how well can a model handle external attributes/conditioning, the performance of spectral synthesis over waveform synthesis, etc. There can also be errors introduced due to the generation of waveforms from spectral representations too. Additionally, there can be different errors introduced due to different applications e.g. a mean opinion score metric for the TTS system might not be a good metric for other perceptual tasks such as speech denoising/enhancement. Finally, concerning the quality of generated audio in unconditioned setup without meta-data, it again is a function of how to sample the predictions, how we modify the temperature function. We evaluate it against the wavenet model as it is state-of-the-art in raw waveform synthesis. Due to these reasons, we focus on the synthesis of waveform alone and report raw accuracy numbers. Since for both wavenet, the objective for training is how good the model is in the next step prediction using cross-entropy loss, we believed that instead of giving negative log-likelihood scores, we give the accuracy as to how each of them does in the objective criteria they are trained on. Table 1 compares the performance of all the systems tried. For the vanilla wavenet system, we fix the hyper-parameters according to the one implemented by Google in . The vanilla wavenet architecture consists of 10 layers of causal convolutions with each layer having 128 filters, and the receptive field was dilated by a factor of 2 in each layer with the initial filter size being 2. The second variant of this model stacked 3 such modules yielding a total of 30 layers. We see that with depth the model achieves a performance of about 76% as opposed to 74% with the vanilla model. This is because the stacked model learns even longer context as opposed to the vanilla architecture. We did not tune on the filter sizes, the number of filters, and these parameters were chosen from the paper as described in . For the Transformer architecture, we first choose the parameters to have 4 attention heads, with the size of latent space being 128, and the size of the feed-forward architecture was chosen to be 256. For most of the Transformer implementation seen across literature [ref]33 typically the number of attention heads are chosen to be either 4 or 8 and we adhered to such a choice. We see that the network already outperforms even the large-scale 30-Layer wavenet architecture by a significant margin of about 4%. One of the main reasons we attribute the success of these models is because attention models learn which parts of the waveform are important. This enables learning a much more complex topology than the causal convolutional filters learned by wavenet architectures. Additionally, when we condition it on the past waveform, it outperforms the same architecture without conditioning by 2 %. Even though this is a small number, it is as significant of a jump as between a Vanilla wavenet implementation and a Stacked 30-Layer wavenet model. One of the hypotheses as to why this happens is the fact that we are in some manner able to capture even longer contexts by conditioning the generation on past samples. For example, the latent code can learn pitch patterns, chord distributions, which can guide the output predictions better. In the future, speaker/instrument-specific conditioning can be carried out to generate a diverse range of audio signals. This flexibility of conditioning via convolutional architectures can be modified in future for a variety of applications e.g. Packet Loss Concealment 9 , instrument transfer 5  to name a few. Finally, to see how much we can improve the performance with large deeper Transformer architectures, we train an 8-Layer Transformer model, with 8 attention heads keeping the size of embeddings and the architecture of feed-forward architecture the same. We see that the performance increases significantly yielding 5% absolute improvement over the baseline Transformer architecture. This is in line with what has been seen in the literature of improved performances with the size of the models. The improvement over traditional wavenet architectures with comparable architecture by such significant margins is exciting for the future of raw audio synthesis.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: have 4 attention heads, with the size of latent space being 128, and the size of the feed-forward architecture was chosen to be 256.
