      "content": "Paper Title: Lower Bounds and Optimal Algorithms for Personalized Federated Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFederated Learning (FL)  [ref]24 is a relatively new field that attracted much attention recently. Specifically, FL is a subset of distributed machine learning that aims to fit the data stored locally on plentiful clients. Unlike typical distributed learning inside a data center, each client only sees his/her data, which might differ from the population average significantly. Furthermore, as the clients are often physically located far away from the central server, communication becomes a notable bottleneck, which is far more significant compared to in-datacenter learning. While the main difference between FL and the rest of the machine learning lies in means of the training, the two scenarios are often identical from the modeling perspective. In particular, the standard FL aims to find the minimizer of the overall population loss: where fisubscript𝑓𝑖f_{i} is the loss of the client i𝑖i that only depends on his/her own local data. However, there is major criticism of the objective (1) for many of the FL applications   [ref]10. Specifically, the minimizer of the overall population loss might not be the ideal model for a given client, given that his/her data distribution differs from the population significantly. A good example to illustrate the requirement of personalized FL models is the prediction of the next word written on a mobile keyboard, where a personalized FL approach  significantly outperformed the non-personalized one. There are multiple strategies in the literature for incorporating the personalization into FL: multi-task learning   , transfer learning  , variational inference , mixing of the local and global models  [ref]19  [ref]10 and others . See also   for a personalized FL survey. In this work, we focus on the mixing FL objective from [ref]19 which is well-known from the area of distributed optimizaton   and distributed transfer learning  . The mentioned formulation allows the local models xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} to be mutually different, while penalizing their dissimilarity: Suprisingly enough, the optimal solution x⋆=[x1⋆,x2⋆,…,xn⋆]∈ℝn​dsuperscript𝑥⋆superscriptsubscript𝑥1⋆superscriptsubscript𝑥2⋆…superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑛⋆superscriptℝ𝑛𝑑x^{\\star}=[x_{1}^{\\star},x_{2}^{\\star},\\dots,x_{n}^{\\star}]\\in\\mathbb{R}^{nd} of (2) can be expressed as xi⋆=x¯⋆−1λ​∇fi​(xi⋆)superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖⋆superscript¯𝑥⋆1𝜆∇subscript𝑓𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖⋆x_{i}^{\\star}=\\bar{x}^{\\star}-\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\nabla f_{i}(x_{i}^{\\star}), where x¯⋆=1n​∑i=1nxi⋆superscript¯𝑥⋆1𝑛superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛subscriptsuperscript𝑥⋆𝑖\\bar{x}^{\\star}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x^{\\star}_{i} [ref]19, which strongly resembles the famous MAML . In addition to personalization, the above formulation sheds light on the most prominent FL optimizer – local SGD/FedAvg. Specifically, it was shown that a simple version of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) applied on (2) is essentially222Up to the stepsize and random number of the local gradient steps. equivalent to FedAvg algorithm [ref]19. Furthermore, the FL formulation (2) enabled local gradient methods to outperform their non-local cousins when applied to heterogeneous data problems.333Surprisingly enough, the non-local algorithms outperform their local counterparts when applied to solve the classical FL formulation (1) with heterogeneous data.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: Federated Learning (FL)  [ref]24 is a relatively new field that attracted much attention recently.
