      "content": "Paper Title: Artificial Intelligence for Complex Network: Potential, Methodology and Application\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor urban networks, we also classify applications, ML problems, and AI technology of related works in Table 7. Specifically, ML problems in these studies mainly involve prediction, generation, and control, which will be introduced in detail in the following. Prediction: In urban networks, one of the most crucial applications of AI algorithms is prediction.\nMore specifically, prediction tasks involve cascading failures prediction, travel time estimation, and demand prediction of electric networks [ref]232 [ref]13. AI techniques include GCN [ref]232 and Bayesian Networks [ref]13 are leveraged to predict the future state of the whole network after a long-term evolution, or the missing information (edge-level) of the network. Simulation: It is practically valuable to simulate traffic flow of road networks  and contagion dynamics based on human contact networks [ref]166 . Among these applications, the widely used AI techniques include GCN [ref]166 , neural ODE , and auto-reservoir Neural Networks . Most of them focus on simulating the future state of different urban infrastructure networks or urban activity networks based on their current states and topology. This problem is solved by proficiently modeling the dynamics within urban networks, and GCN has been validated as a robust tool for handling this problem. Specifically, Murphy et al. [ref]166 show the contagion dynamics on complex networks can be efficiently modeled by GCN.\nMeanwhile, Neural ODE, as a method capable of effectively modeling dynamics by using powerful neural networks to fit the derivatives of states over time, has become a potent approach for solving the prediction problem on urban networks combined with GCN methods . Generation: The generation task in this domain mainly focuses on synthesizing plausible urban networks to support downstream applications, e.g., urban infrastructure design , etc.\nSpecifically,\nKocayusufoglu et al.  focus on generating realistic flow graphs of urban infrastructure networks, and they propose a two-step approach based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to generate both the adjacency matrix and flow matrix of urban infrastructure simultaneously.\nSimini et al.  extend the classical model for mobility flow based on feed-forward neural networks to generate plausible urban mobility networks.\nRong et al.  further tackle this city-wide flow generation problem through the network perspective, proposing a graph denoising diffusion model that can directly generate a realistic urban mobility network. Decision-making and control:\nThe control problem in urban networks aims to address how to intervene in the nodes or edges of the network to influence the behavior of the entire network or reveal its key characteristics such as resilience and vulnerable nodes   .\nSpecifically, Mao et al.  utilize reinforcement learning combined with GCN to capture the risk of cascade failure and discover vulnerable infrastructures of cities. Hao et al.   propose a reinforcement learning method combined with graph neural networks for efficient COVID-19 vaccine allocation in large-scale metropolises, addressing challenges in decision-making complexity and heterogeneous information utilization. Specifically, in the GAT-MF model proposed in , they model the interactions between agents as interactions between agents and a weighted mean field, which is based on the classical mean-field theory, to reduce the computational complexity significantly. These studies stand as a noteworthy case of applying AI technology to resolve control problems in complex networks.\n\nReference markers found: [232]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]232: crucial applications of AI algorithms is prediction.\nMore specifically, prediction tasks involve cascading failures prediction, travel time estimation, and demand prediction of electric networks [ref]232 [ref]13.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
