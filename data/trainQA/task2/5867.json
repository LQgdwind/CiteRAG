      "content": "Paper Title: TSEN: Transformer and Snowball Graph Convolution Learning for Brain Functional Network Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this paper, we used two human brain functional networks, as shown in Table 1. ABIDE I  contains the resting-state fMRI data from Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) patients and health controls (HC). By eliminating the low quality of imaging , we selected 974 subjects, including 467 ASD and 507 HC, to construct brain functional networks for classification experiments. REST-meta-MDD  includes brain network data generated from the resting-state fMRI data from Major Depressive Disorders (MDD) patients and HC. We selected 2027 subjects, including 1041 MDD and 986 HC, to construct brain functional networks for classification experiments. In the datasets of ABIDE I and REST-meta-MDD, we constructed a brain functional network for each subject, where the node represents the ROI based on a brain atlas  [ref]40, and the edge between nodes represents the brain functional connection of ROI pairs [ref]14 . The functional connection was defined by the pairwise Pearson correlation coefficient between the mean fMRI series of ROIs. The node/ROI features were defined by the node’s corresponding row in the adjacency matrix of brain network. We compared TSEN with baselines of three types, including typical GNN models, GNN models with special design for graph classification, and graph-transformer based GNN models. Graph convolutional networks (GCN) [ref]41, graph attention networks (GAT) , GraphSAGE , and snowball GCN (SBGCN) : There are typical GNN models that were not specifically designed for graph classification. GCN is based on a variant of CNNs which operate directly on graphs. GAT is a GNN architecture using masked self-attentional layers. GraphSAGE is based on randomly edges sampling to enhance the ability of capturing global structure. SBGCN is a GCN architecture using a snowball structure to capture multi-scale information. DiffPool , GIN , PGCN , MRGNN , BrainGNN , BrainNetCNN , and FBNetGNN : There are graph neural networks which have a special design for graph classification. GIN is a well-known typical GNN that was expected to achieve the ability as the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test, but a graph-level readout function of GIN was specially designed to produce the embedding of the entire graph for graph classification tasks. DiffPool is a differentiable graph pooling module that could generate hierarchical representations for graph classification. PGCN introduced the polynomial graph convolution layer to independently exploit neighbouring nodes at different topological distances, and used subsequent readout layers to generate graph representation. MRGNN used a shallow readout function to generate an unsupervised graph representation. BrainGNN was specially designed with graph convolution and interpretation for brain network classification. BrainNetCNN proposed multiple types of convolution to extract features from edge weights. FBNetGNN applied GNNs based on a learnable graph, and the graphs could be considered as a type of attention score. BrainNetTF [ref]14, GraphGPS , GraphTrans , and Spectral Attention Network (SAN) : They are well-known graph-transformer based models. GraphTrans applied graph convolution operation to introduce local patterns and structure information of graphs. Graphormer specially designed three positional encoding methods for graph classification. SAN used learned positional encoding of Laplacian spectrum to introduce position information of nodes in graphs. BrainNetTF learned fully pairwise attention weights with Transformer-based models to obtain the brain network structures. “Attr.” means the dimension of the node features.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: for classification experiments.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
