First of all, we consider the autonomous driving problem in\nan urban environment as a goal-directed motion planning task.\nTo this end, we adopt the Conditional Imitation Learning (CIL)\nframework  to train our model in an end-to-end manner. Secondly, our approach learns semantic segmentation and depth\nestimation to learn to encode the image into a meaningful\nfeature vector as in [ref]21. Although the\nauthors of [ref]21 were the first to introduce\nthose scene representation learning in the CIL framework,\nthe learning process was divided into perception and driving.\nIn our approach, we train segmentation and depth estimation\ntogether with control.\nMoreover, we also add traffic light classification task as\nthe fourth task that our network performs at the same time\nas the others. Thirdly, our approach incorporates an attention mechanism\ninspired by the MTAN proposed by Liu et al.inÂ \nto successfully learn task-shared and task-specific features separately.\nDifferently from the original MTAN which drops irrelevant features\nfrom global feature maps, we use a CBAM-based attention module to\nemphasize the global feature maps by additive operation.\nThis contributes to the learning of much more complex behavior\nof reacting to traffic lights than the ability to keep\nlane and following vehicles.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: Inspired by the previous works of end-to-end driving\n [ref]21 and visual\nattention methods  [ref]29,\nwe introduce a multi-task attention-aware neural\nnetwork that learns compact road scene representation to\njointly predict scene representations\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
