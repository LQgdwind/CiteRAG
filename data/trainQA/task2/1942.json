      "content": "Paper Title: Pose-driven Attention-guided Image Generation for Person Re-Identification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare our proposed method with the state-of-the-art pose-guided person re-ID methods, PAC-GAN , Pose-transfer [ref]12, PSE , PDC , PIE , Gated Fusion [ref]48, PN-GAN , FD-GAN [ref]10 on Market-1501 and Pose-transfer [ref]12, PSE , PIE , Gated Fusion [ref]48, PN-GAN , FD-GAN [ref]10 on the DukeMTMC-reID dataset. The results are reported in Tables 1 and 2. The previous state-of-the-art method is FD-GAN [ref]10 for Market1501 with a 90.5% rank-1 accuracy, where a Siamese architecture is adopted to extract identity-related and pose-invariant features. A novel pose loss is also introduced between generated images from the same identity to further encourage the network to learn identity-related features. For the DukeMTMC-reID dataset, the previous state-of-the-art method was the pose-invariant embedding (PIE) method of  which achieved 80.8% rank-1 accuracy and a mAP of 64.1. PIE  addresses the problem of poor pedestrian alignment and a Pose-Box is introduced to align the pedestrians to a standard pose. To construct the PoseBox, first the human poses are estimated by convolutional pose machines (CPM) to detect the body joints. Affine transformations are then used to project the body parts to a canonical pose. In contrast to these methods, our proposed pose-guided method is different in terms of architecture and loss functions. None of the above-mentioned methods consider capturing local details of a person together with the global structure which is essential to generate person images with new poses while preserving the appearance. The proposed method sequentially learns local details of a person through the blocks of the proposed attention-based appearance network and decodes them in a progressive manner using the attention-based image generation network, moving from small scales to larger scales to combine the local information with the global structure. The proposed method achieves 93.5% rank-1 accuracy on the Market-1501 dataset which outperforms the state-of-the-art method of [ref]10 by 3.0%. For DukeMTMC-reID, our rank-1 accuracy is 84.2% while the state-of-the-art method achieved 80.8%. Generated pose-transferred samples from Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID are shown in Figures 8 and 9. The first column shows the condition (source) image while the second, third and fourth shows the condition pose, target pose and the generated images. From the figures, it can be seen that the generated images successfully adapt the subject to the target pose while keeping the appearance of the condition images. From Figure 8, we observe that the proposed method successfully transferred to the target pose, even when the source person is riding a bicycle in the source image (see the person wearing yellow t-shirt and riding a bicycle, or the person wearing a blue t-shirt in Figure 8). We note that while the DukeMTMC-reID dataset is very challenging due to poor camera resolution, our method is still able to transfer the poses of the condition images according to the target pose map, as illustrated in Figure 9.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: We compare our proposed method with the state-of-the-art pose-guided person re-ID methods, PAC-GAN , Pose-transfer [ref]12, PSE , PDC , PIE , Gated Fusion [ref]48, PN-GAN , FD-GAN [ref]10 on Market-1501 and Pose-transfer [ref]12, PSE , PIE , Gated Fusion [ref]48, PN-GAN , FD-GAN [ref]10 on the DukeMTMC-reID\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
