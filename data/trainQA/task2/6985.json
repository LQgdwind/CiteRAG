      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Mitigating Architecture Overfitting in Dataset Distillation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDataset Distillation: The goal of dataset distillation is to learn a smaller set of training samples (i.e. distilled dataset) that preserves essential information of the original large dataset so that the model trained on this small dataset performs similarly to that trained on the original large dataset.\nExisting dataset distillation approaches are based on either meta-learning or data matching [ref]22.\nThe former category includes backpropagation through time (BPTT) approach [ref]7   and kernel ridge regression (KRR) approach  ; the latter category includes gradient matching  , trajectory matching   , and distribution matching  .\nHowever, these methods suffer from severe architecture overfitting, which means significant performance degradation when the architecture of the training network and the test network are different.\nRecently, some factorization methods    , which learn synthetic datasets by optimizing their factorized features and corresponding decoders, greatly improve the cross-architecture transferability.\nHowever, the instance per class (IPC), which indicates the number of instances in the distilled dataset, used in these methods is at least 555 times larger than that of meta-learning and data matching approaches, which greatly cancels out the advantages of dataset distillation.\nTo better fit the motivation of dataset distillation, we only consider small IPCs (111, 101010 and 505050) in this work, so the factorization methods are not included for comparison. Model Ensemble: Model ensemble aims to integrate multiple models to improve the generalization performance.\nPopular ensemble methods for classification models include bagging , AdaBoost , random forest , random subspace , and gradient boosting .\nHowever, these methods require training several models and thus are computationally expensive.\nBy contrast, DropOut  trains the model only once but stochastically masks its intermediate feature maps during training.\nAt each training iteration with DropOut, only part of the model parameters are updated, which forms a sub-network of the model.\nIn this regard, DropOut enables implicit model ensembles of different sub-networks to improve the generalization performance.\nSimilar to DropOut, DropPath  also implicitly ensembles sub-networks but it blocks a whole layer rather than masking some feature maps.\nTherefore, it is applicable to network architectures with multiple branches, such as ResNet , otherwise, the model output will be zero if a layer of a single branch network is dropped.\nBy contrast, we propose a DropPath variant in this work which is generic, applicable to single-branch networks and effective to mitigate architecture overfitting.\n Knowledge Distillation:\nKnowledge distillation [ref]36 aims to compress a well-trained large model (i.e., teacher model) into a smaller and more efficient model (i.e., student model) with comparable performance.\nThe standard knowledge distillation [ref]36 is also known as offline distillation since the teacher model is fixed when training the student model.\nOnline distillation   is proposed to further improve the performance of the student model, especially when a large-capacity high-performance teacher model is not available.\nIn online distillation, both the teacher model and the student model are updated simultaneously.\nIn most cases, knowledge distillation methods use large models as the teachers and small models as the students, which is based on the fact that larger models typically have better performance.\nHowever, in the context of dataset distillation, a smaller test network with the same architecture as the training network can achieve a better performance than a larger one on the distilled dataset, so we use the small model as the teacher and the large model as the student in this work. We show in the following sections that combining DropPath and knowledge distillation, architecture overfitting in dataset distillation can be almost overcome.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: the model trained on this small dataset performs similarly to that trained on the original large dataset.\nExisting dataset distillation approaches are based on either meta-learning or data matching [ref]22.\nThe former category includes backpropagation through time (BPTT) approach [ref]7   and kernel ridge regression (KRR) approach  ; the latter category includes gradient matching  , trajectory\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
