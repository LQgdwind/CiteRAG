      "content": "Paper Title: Accurate 3D Hand Pose Estimation for Whole-Body 3D Human Mesh Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAlthough there have been remarkable progress in 3D body-only      0 , hand-only    7, and face-only 8 mesh estimation, there have been few attempts to simultaneously recover the 3D body, hands, and face.\nSeveral early works are based on an optimization-based approach, which fits a 3D human model to the 2D/3D evidence.\nJoo et al.  fits their human models (i.e., Frank and Adam) to 3D human joints coordinates and point clouds in a multi-view studio environment.\nXiang et al. 2 extended Joo et al.  to the single RGB case.\nSMPLif-X 6 and Xu et al. 4 fit their human models, SMPL-X and GHUM, respectively, to 2D human joint coordinates.\nAs the above optimization-based methods can be slow and prone to noisy evidence, a regression-based approach is presented recently.\nRecently, several neural network-based methods have been proposed.\nAll of them consist of body, hand, and face networks, where each takes a human image, hand-cropped image, and face-cropped image, respectively.\nThe three networks predict SMPL-X parameters for a final whole-body 3D human mesh.\nExPose [ref]4 is the earliest regression-based approach, which utilizes the three separated networks.\nFrankMocap 7 consists of body and hand networks, and their hand prediction is attached to 3D body results.\nZhou et al. 6 utilize 3D joint coordinates for the 3D joint rotation prediction.\nPIXIE [ref]5 introduced a moderator to predict 3D joint rotations. Compared to the recent whole-body 3D human mesh estimation methods, our Hand4Whole has three clear novel contributions.\nFirst, we design Pose2Pose as the main module of our Hand4Whole.\nPose2Pose enables Hand4Whole to understand different semantic information of each joint by introducing joint features, while previous works [ref]4 7 [ref]5 provides only an instance-level feature to their system by performing the GAP.\nSecond, Hand4Whole uses both body and hand MCP joint features for the 3D wrist rotations.\nOn the other hand, ExPose [ref]4 and FrankMocap 7 predict 3D wrist rotation only from a hand feature without a body feature.\nThe absence of the body feature when predicting the 3D wrist rotations results in implausible 3D wrist rotations when hands are occluded or truncated, as shown in Figure 2.\nZhou et al. 6 predict 3D wrist rotations only from a body feature without a hand feature.\nThey suffer from inaccurate 3D wrist rotations as they do not utilize MCP joint features.\nPIXIE [ref]5 combines body and hand features by a moderator to predict 3D wrist rotations.\nHowever, their hand feature contains lots of unnecessary information, such as finger information, which can hurt the 3D wrist rotation accuracy as fingers often move independently to the wrists.\nThird, Hand4Whole discards the body feature when predicting 3D finger rotations.\nIn contrast, Zhou et al. 6 and PIXIE [ref]5 uses the body feature, which contains very coarse hand information due to the small pixel size of the hands.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: and face networks, where each takes a human image, hand-cropped image, and face-cropped image, respectively.\nThe three networks predict SMPL-X parameters for a final whole-body 3D human mesh.\nExPose [ref]4 is the earliest regression-based approach, which utilizes the three separated networks.\nFrankMocap 7 consists of body and hand networks, and their hand prediction is attached to 3D body\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
