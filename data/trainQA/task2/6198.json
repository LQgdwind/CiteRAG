      "content": "Paper Title: Rethink Diversity in Deep Learning Testing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDL systems have demonstrated remarkable performance across various machine learning tasks and also revolutionized modern society  [ref]2. More recently, large language models  and stable diffusion models  have shown impressive, or even superhuman capabilities on many generative tasks. Despite the wide application of DL systems nowadays, their decision process remains quite black-box and less explainable to humans, and they are also shown to be vulnerable to various bugs   . With the wide deployment of DL systems, especially in some safety-critical applications, it is important to ensure the security and trustworthiness of those systems. However, DL systems are also software artifacts, thus amenable to SE approaches. Testing, one of the classical SE techniques, has been practiced for decades to detect erroneous behaviors of traditional software . By serving numerous inputs to the programs, testing can expose bugs when the execution deviates from the specification. Moreover, the inputs can serve as concrete examples for developers to demonstrate the existence of defects and to understand and debug the program. In traditional software testing, tools often employ the adaptive testing scenario: a repeated loop involving input mutation, program execution, and evaluation of fitness [ref]9 0. Inputs with higher fitness scores are prioritized or given more mutation resources for the next loop iterations. The goal is to expose bugs fast and this fitness quantifies how likely an input can expose bugs. As a result, to design an effective testing framework, an important task is to create a good metric that can prioritize potential defective inputs.\nMotivated by the idea of adaptive testing, to extend its utility toward detecting DNN bugs, a natural question arises as follows:\n There are two types of testing frameworks: diversity-based testing and directed testing.\nDiversity-based testing relies on the assumption that diversified tests can execute the program thoroughly, and often expose corner cases that are overlooked by developers. This methodology is suitable for general-purpose testing, where tools aim to expose as many bugs as possible [ref]9 .\nOn the other hand, the goal of directed testing is more specific; such as detecting a particular type of bug rather than any bug. Driven by the specific goal, directed testing prioritizes inputs that are more potential to expose particular bugs rather than inputs that improve the “diversity” 1 0. For example, standard fuzz testing prioritizes tests that trigger unseen coverage. However, if the tool is to identify concurrency errors, test executions that are close to the potential data-race code in the program should be considered more promising to expose concurrency bugs 2. In recent years, researchers have proposed methods to test DL systems. Many of them are motivated by traditional software testing practices, in particular, to encourage the diversity of inputs. One of the common diversity measures in software testing is code coverage of execution from the inputs . Researchers were motivated by this measure and defined similar metrics for DNNs. They treated neurons as the basic computational components, similar to basic blocks in programs, and defined diversity metrics in terms of neuron activation patterns 3, namely, Neuron Coverage (NC).\nHowever, later works argued that NC is not a meaningful metric 4.\nTill these days, the usage of neuron activation diversity remains controversial: some recent works re-confirm that NC does not bring significant advantage 5 while some others still design diversity metrics based on neuron activations 6. Contrary to existing works that design different diversity metrics for DL testing, we argue that many DL testing tasks in the literature 3 6 should be treated as directed testing tasks because they are well-defined and specific. We refer to these bugs under detection as functionality bugs because these bugs violate the DNN functionality.\nAlso, the mathematical semantics of DNNs are simple compared to traditional software, so one can quantify how likely one input is to change the DNN’s functionality, and this provides a measure for testing. Therefore, test generation should be guided by this directed measure rather than a diversity measure. Moreover, we suggest that the testing can be even accelerated by exploiting an intrinsic nature of DL systems: differentiability.\nThe differentiability of DNNs allows us to derive fast and precise linear approximations in a small neighborhood using gradients. As we will explain, state-of-the-art ℓpsubscriptℓ𝑝\\ell_{p}-adversarial attacks from DL literature, projected gradient descent (PGD) 7, can also be categorized into our testing framework. Moreover, we provide a careful mathematical analysis of gradient-based methods, which validates these methods for ℓpsubscriptℓ𝑝\\ell_{p}-transformations, but also casts doubt on their applications to other types of transformations. In fact, we notice that there are discrepancies between the practices in the SE and DL communities. Even though DL systems are also programs and many SE techniques can be applied, DL has also been studied extensively outside SE due to its capability and popularity. Many practices in both communities are similar at a high level but still different in many ways. We point out some of these gaps and hopefully, this work can help bridge some of the gaps. To summarize, we make the following contributions: We provide a novel conceptual framework for many DL testing tasks, and demonstrate that some state-of-the-art DL practices are the natural consequences of this framework. We believe that our work can help clarify the controversial DNN testing topic, i.e., NC maximization; and bridge the gaps between practices in the SE and DL communities. In fact, we point out that the NC maximization metric generates out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs using the DL glossary. To instantiate our framework, we provide several concrete testing metrics with careful mathematical analysis. Our unified testing framework allows us to handle various types of input transformations, and past works were unable to. Moreover, our analysis validates the application of gradients on ℓpsubscriptℓ𝑝\\ell_{p}-adversarial attacks but also calls for rigorous scrutiny of gradient methods on other types of input transformations. We empirically validate our framework with several carefully designed experiments\nMoreover, we also compare our framework with several diversity-based methods. The result shows that our metrics are more effective in exposing the functionality bugs among all settings, and also reveals that the diversity metrics are weak indicators for bugs under small ℓpsubscriptℓ𝑝\\ell_{p}-perturbations.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: DL systems have demonstrated remarkable performance across various machine learning tasks and also revolutionized modern society  [ref]2.
