      "content": "Paper Title: SiTe CiM: Signed Ternary Computing-in-Memory for Ultra-Low Precision Deep Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe post-CMOS era of memory technology has observed a growing pool of non-volatile memories (NVM) . NVMs exhibit several attractive features such as high area efficiency and zero stand-by leakage. In this work, we choose hafnium zirconium oxide (HZO)-based ferroelectric metal transistor (FEMFET) NVM [ref]24. Apart from the standard attributes of NVMs discussed in Section  I, FEMFETs offer low power electric field-driven write and excellent CMOS compatibility. Amongst the ferroelectric based technologies, FEMFETs offer (i) reduced trap-induced endurance/retention degradation and lower write voltage compared to ferroelectric FETs or FEFETs [ref]24; (ii) significantly larger distinguishability between memory states and decoupled read and write paths compared to FERAMs. However, these benefits come at the cost of area and some gate leakage-induced read challenges . FEMFETs store bit information in the form of polarization (P𝑃P) of FE in a non-volatile fashion. +P/−P+P/-P correspond to a low/high resistance state (L​R​S/H​R​S𝐿𝑅𝑆𝐻𝑅𝑆LRS/HRS) and encode bits ‘1’/’0’ (Fig.  1(c)). While FEMFETs can be utilized to store multi-level values, here, we focus on binary FEMFET devices. We utilize the 3T-FEMFET-based cell (Fig.  1(c)) consisting of n-type read and write access transistors  connected to the drain and gate of FEMFET respectively (Fig.  1(c)). For write, we first perform a global reset on all the FEMFET cells (switch polarization to −P𝑃-P) by driving the write bit line W​B​L𝑊𝐵𝐿WBL to -VW​r​i​t​esubscript𝑉𝑊𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒V_{Write}. We then selectively set (write +P𝑃+P) in some FEMFET cells by driving the corresponding W​B​L𝑊𝐵𝐿WBL and W​W​L​s𝑊𝑊𝐿𝑠WWLs to VW​r​i​t​esubscript𝑉𝑊𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒V_{Write}. During read, R​B​L𝑅𝐵𝐿RBL is pre-charged to VD​Dsubscript𝑉𝐷𝐷V_{DD} and the read word line (R​W​L𝑅𝑊𝐿RWL) is asserted. If the FEMFET stores a ‘1’ (Fig.  1(f)), RBL discharges, else it remains at VD​Dsubscript𝑉𝐷𝐷V_{DD}. FEMFET read can also be performed using current-based sensing. Following the works in , we assume that the effect of the gate leakage on read  can be minimized. The study of FEFET/FEMFET-based CiM macros is a promising area of research.  proposes CiM-based binarized neural networks using FEFETs.  uses FEFETs to implement a ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM) for one-shot learning. Recently, we explored signed ternary hardware accelerator design by cross-coupling two 3T-FEMFET bitcells , which achieved signed-ternary CiM, but incurs some area overhead. In this work, we expand on this design by exploring how the benefits of cross-coupling can be attained for signed ternary cells while incurring lower area overheads. With this background, we briefly explain our modeling and simulation approach next.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: exhibit several attractive features such as high area efficiency and zero stand-by leakage.
