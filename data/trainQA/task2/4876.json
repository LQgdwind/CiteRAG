      "content": "Paper Title: A Secure Federated Data-Driven Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization Algorithm\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEvolutionary algorithms (EAs) are a class of population-based metaheuristics inspired from natural evolution that have witnessed huge success in solving single- or multi-objective optimization problems . Since they do not rely on gradients of the objective functions, EAs are well suited for data-driven surrogate-assisted optimization , often in combination with Bayesian optimization (BO) [ref]3  for surrogate management. Despite their effectiveness and efficiency, existing BO and data-driven EAs suffer from several limitations. At present, most data-driven EAs are implemented in a centralized manner, assuming that all required information for optimization is available on a single computer, including raw data, the acquisition function, and new data points. However, this centralized approach is unpractical in many real-world scenarios, since raw data and data to be sampled may be distributed across multiple locations. For instance, as described in the scenario in , a bank (i.e., a client) aims to identify the loan applicants with the highest return on investment and outsources the task to an AI consulting company (i.e., the server). In this scenario, the bank is unable to disclose the raw data of the loan applicants due to privacy and security requirements, whereas the AI consultancy is unwilling to share the implementation of their selection strategy. This scenario can be naturally extended to multiple banks, i.e., multiple banks work collaboratively and aim to identify the most promising loan applicants by utilizing the data of each client privately. In this case, each bank holds its own applicant’s data and the overall target is to improve the effectiveness of identifying the most promising loan applicants.\nFurthermore, collecting data from devices introduces security threats and vulnerabilities during data transmission and collection, which is a concern for privacy-sensitive applications. In addition, certain raw data may be sensitive and cannot be transferred to third parties due to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). To address these issues, a privacy-preserving framework for data-driven optimization is in high demand, especially when the data is distributed across multiple devices. Privacy-preserving machine learning, including federated learning (FL)   and learning over encrypted data  has shown great promise in the past decade. By contrast, only sporadic research has been reported on privacy-preserving data-driven optimization. For example, federated BO [ref]9 is proposed to tackle a global optimization task under a federated framework. To fully utilize the data of clients, Xu et al. 0 1 propose a federated acquisition function within a federated data-driven EA framework. Although these studies are inspired by FL, the following challenges arise as the targets of federated learning and federated BO are different. One major challenge in federated optimization is that federated averaging cannot be directly applied to non-parametric surrogate models such as the Gaussian process (GP) widely used in BO, and it is non-trivial to design secure optimization of the acquisition function without having direct access to the predicted objective values of the clients. The second challenge is that the amount of data on each client/user device is often very limited, such as car crash data 2 or oil distillation data 3. This requires to utilize all clients’ data, while the privacy of the data must be protected. Finally, the secure aggregation schemes in federated learning cannot be directly applied to federated data-driven evolutionary algorithms based on an acquisition function. The reason is that apart from aggregating the weights from all participating clients, the server also needs to propose new query points by optimizing the acquisition function. Thus, secure optimization of the acquisition function without having a direct access to the predicted objective values of each client becomes quintessential. Existing work on federated Bayesian optimization and federated data-driven evolutionary algorithm mainly consider the protection of raw data. In 4 [ref]9, a surrogate is trained with a set of available hyperparameters and their corresponding validation accuracy that is obtained by the raw data such as images from each client. However, we argue that information such as the hyperparameters and prediction accuracy should not be revealed either. In 0 and 1, however, the server can directly access the predicted objective values of each client given any set of decision variables. We posit that although the surrogate models are unable to accurately predict the real objective values, the predicted objective values obtained based on the model parameters can still reveal private information such as the rank of solutions. This is because the surrogate models reflect the landscape of the surrogates that have been trained using the real function evaluations. To address this issue, we propose to transmit the perturbed predicted objective values of any unobserved solutions instead of directly sharing local model parameters to protect the rank of the newly infilled solutions. Additionally, we argue that the new query points should not be visible to the server, since the server can directly evaluate the quality of all newly infilled solutions, including calculating acquisition function values of all query inputs with the information available from all clients. We propose that the next query input should be suggested on a randomly selected client to prevent the server from knowing the rank of all new solutions and the infilled solutions. In the context of FL and BO, privacy-preserving mechanisms such as homomorphic encryption (HE) and differential privacy (DP) are widely used for privacy preservation. However, both HE and DP have their own advantages and disadvantages. HE allows for computations to be performed under ciphertext, which provides a high level of security but requires more computational resources and incurs higher communication costs for encryption and decryption. By contrast, DP adds noise to local data or models as a perturbation method, which suffers form a trade-off between accuracy and protection. Given these limitations, this work designs a light-weight privacy-preserving framework that can maintain optimization performance. Our goal is to strike a balance between privacy preservation and optimization performance by leveraging techniques that minimize computational and communication costs while preserving the privacy of sensitive data. Considering that the federated data-driven evolutionary algorithm optimization (FDD-EA) in 1 can only protect the raw data, this work proposes a secure privacy-preserving framework based on FDD-EA 1 to protect both the raw data and the newly infilled samples. Our proposed framework incorporates a secure aggregation method based on Diffie-Hellman-based noise, which enables a lightweight design while ensuring strong security. With this approach, our framework can maintain optimization performance without sacrificing privacy. The main contributions of this work are: To protect the new infilled solutions, the predicted objective values are masked with Diffie-Hellman-based noise and aggregated on one randomly selected client. Meanwhile, adding different amounts of noise to different individuals in the population changes the relative ranks of the individuals in each client, thereby protecting the predicted values of the clients. The predicted mean objective value and uncertainty are normalized to reduce the negative influence of the added noise in the estimation of uncertainty when calculating the federated acquisition function value. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II and Section III present the related work and the preliminaries of this work, respectively. Section IV describes the problem formulation of federated optimization and the security assumptions. The proposed privacy-preserving scheme is detailed in Section V, followed by a security analysis of the proposed algorithm in Section VI and a presentation of the experimental results in Section VII. Finally, Section VIII concludes the paper and proposes future work for the secure federated data-driven evolutionary algorithms.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: problems .
