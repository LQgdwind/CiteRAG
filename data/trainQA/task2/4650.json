Instrumental Variable Regression.\nIV regression is another method for learning causal relationships with observational data.\nWhen measurements of input and output are confounded, the causal relationship, also called the structural relationship,\ncan be identified if an instrumental variable is available (see Figure 2).\nInstrumental variable regression involves two-stage regression (2SLS), and Singh et al. , Mastouri et al.  generalize this method to nonlinear settings.\nThey also provide consistency guarantees for their kernel instrumental variable algorithm.\nThe idea of dual formulation simplifies traditional two-stage methods.\nSeveral works   propose such ideas with similar mathematical structure. Instrumental Variable in Bandits.\nA few papers apply IV regression in machine learning.\nKallus [ref]17 formalize an instrumented-armed bandit (IAB) framework in a multi-armed bandit setting.\nThe arm pull is the choice of the instrumental variable which influences rather than guarantees the application of the treatment.\nAs an application of IAB, Ngo et al.  develop a novel recommendation mechanism that views the recommendation as a form of instrumental variables.\nSuch mechanisms strategically select instruments to incentive compliance over time to achieve optimal regrets up to logarithmic terms.\nHowever, both works assume the linearity of structural equations.\nWhen structural functions are nonlinear, Xu et al. 6 show that IV implementation can be broken into two supervised stages, which can be targeted with deep networks.\nLiao et al.  take an important step in this direction and provide convergence analysis for neural networks. Kernelized Bandit.\nThe kernelized bandit was originally formulated by Srinivas et al. 0.\nThis work generalizes stochastic linear optimization in a bandit setting,\nwhere the unknown reward function comes from a finite-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS).\nThe smoothness assumptions about functions are encoded through the choice of kernels in a flexible nonparametric fashion.\nSrinivas et al. 0 resolve the problem of deriving regret bounds via GP optimization in RKHS.\nValko et al. 5 propose Kernel-UCB algorithm and obtain 𝒪~​(d~​T)~𝒪~𝑑𝑇\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{\\tilde{d}T}) regret, where d~~𝑑\\tilde{d} is the effective dimension of data.\nJanz et al.  consider the cases when the kernel is of infinite rank, e.g., Matérn kernel.\nThey use the improved GP-UCB algorithm to achieve a suboptimal regret upper bound 𝒪~​(Td​(d+1)d​(d+1)+2​ν)~𝒪superscript𝑇𝑑𝑑1𝑑𝑑12𝜈\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(T^{\\frac{d(d+1)}{d(d+1)+2\\nu}}), where ν𝜈\\nu captures the smoothness of Matérn kernels and d𝑑d is the dimension of contexts.\nLater, Zenati et al. 8 improve computational efficiency of kernelized UCB algorithms.\nThey also show that the concepts of information gain in 0 and effective dimension in 5 8 are equivalent up to logarithmic factors.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: traditional two-stage methods.\nSeveral works   propose such ideas with similar mathematical structure.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
