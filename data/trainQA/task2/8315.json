      "content": "Paper Title: A Sparse Multicover Bifiltration of Linear Size\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor k=1𝑘1k=1, the 111-cover is the union of balls of radius r𝑟r around points of\nX𝑋X. The union of balls is commonly used in reconstructing submanifolds from\nsamples  \nand is a cornerstone of persistent homology methods in Topological Data\nAnalysis, driving the Čech complex and the alpha\ncomplex  ,\namong others. The union of balls assembles into a 111-parameter filtration: by\nincreasing the scale parameter r𝑟r we obtain inclusions\nCovr,1↪Covr′,1↪subscriptCov𝑟1subscriptCovsuperscript𝑟′1\\textrm{Cov}_{r,1}\\hookrightarrow\\textrm{Cov}_{r^{\\prime},1}, for r≤r′𝑟superscript𝑟′r\\leq r^{\\prime}. Taking the homology\nof each Covr,1subscriptCov𝑟1\\textrm{Cov}_{r,1}, we obtain a persistence module, an algebraic\ndescriptor of the topology of the filtration across the different scales. Such a\npersistence module is stable to perturbations of the\npoints [ref]22, but is not robust\nto outliers (already appreciated in Fig. 1) and insensitive to\ndifferences in density in the point cloud. There are multiple methods that address the lack of robustness to outliers and\nchanges in density within the 111-parameter framework. These include density\nestimation   ,\ndistance to a\nmeasure 6 4   ,\nand subsampling . However, they all\ndepend on choosing a parameter. The problem is that it is not clear how to\nchoose such a parameter for all cases, and such a choice might focus on a\nspecific range of scales or densities. We refer to [6, Section\n1.7] for a complete overview of the\nmethods and its limitations. It is then natural to consider constructions over two parameters, scale and\ndensity. Examples include the density\nbifiltration 2, degree\nbifiltrations 9, and the\nmulticover, closely related to both the distance to a\nmeasure 6 and k𝑘k-nearest\nneighbors 0. The advantage of the\nmulticover is that it does not depend on any further choices (like choosing a\ndensity estimation function) and that it is robust to outliers, as a consequence\nof its strong stability\nproperties [ref]6. However, one currently problematic aspect of the multicover is its computation.\nSheehy 0 introduced a celebrated\nsimplicial model of the multicover called the subdivision Čech\nbifiltration, based on the barycentric subdivision of the Čech\nfiltration. It has exponentially many vertices on the number of input points,\nmaking its computation challenging. A crucial ingredient in the theory is the\nmulticover nerve\ntheorem 0 3 [ref]6\nthat establishes the topological equivalence\n(see Section 4.1 for a precise definition) of the\nsubdivision Čech and multicover bifiltrations. Such a multicover nerve\ntheorem has its analogue for the sparse multicover, the sparse\nmulticover nerve theorem (Theorem 4.3). Dually to an hyperplane arrangement in ℝd+1superscriptℝ𝑑1\\mathbb{R}^{d+1}, Edelsbrunner and\nOsang 0 \ndefine the rhomboid tiling and use it to compute the multicover\nbifiltration. Corbet, Kerber, Lesnick and\nOsang  \nbuild on the rhomboid tiling to define two bifiltrations topologically\nequivalent to the multicover, that are of size O​(|X|d+1)𝑂superscript𝑋𝑑1O(\\lvert X\\rvert^{d+1}) and that can\nbe efficiently computed. Most recently, Buchet, Dornelas and Kerber 0\nintroduce an elegant (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-approximation of the multicover whose\nm𝑚m-skeleton has size that is linear on |X|𝑋\\lvert X\\rvert but that incurs an exponential\ndependency on the maximum order k𝑘k we want to compute. A crucial difference\nbetween our work and the Buchet-Dornelas-Kerber (BDK) sparsification is that BDK\nwork at the level of intersection of balls, rather than at the level of balls,\nas we do with the sparse balls. This starting point is what allows us to\nultimately remove the exponential dependency on k𝑘k. BDK work by freezing the lenses: at a certain scale they stop growing. It is not\nclear how to compute exactly the first scale at which freezing lenses first\nintersect—a problem they sidestep by discretizing the scale parameter (at no\ncomplexity cost). In contrast, by letting sparse balls grow slowly at a certain\nrate, rather than freezing them completely, we can compute their first\nintersection time exactly, as we explain in Section 6.3.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: we obtain a persistence module, an algebraic\ndescriptor of the topology of the filtration across the different scales. Such a\npersistence module is stable to perturbations of the\npoints [ref]22, but is not robust\nto outliers (already appreciated in Fig. 1) and insensitive to\ndifferences in density in the point cloud.
