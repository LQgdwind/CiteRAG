      "content": "Paper Title: ViTALiTy: Unifying Low-rank and Sparse Approximation for Vision Transformer Acceleration with a Linear Taylor Attention\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVision Transformers (ViT) are gaining increasing popularity with their state-of-the-art performance in various computer vision tasks¬† [ref]38  0 6 . Compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which exploit local information through convolutional layers, ViT uses multi-head attention (MHA) modules to capture global information and long-range interactions, showing superior accuracy against CNNs . Nevertheless, computing and storing such attention matrices incurs a quadratic computational and memory cost dependency on the number of patches (input resolution). To better understand the runtime breakdown for ViTs‚Äô MHA module, we profile DeiT-Tiny¬†[ref]38, a popular ViT model, on various commercial devices, such as NVIDIA RTX 2080Ti¬†, NVIDIA Edge GPU TX2¬†, and Google Pixel3 phone¬†.\nIn Fig. ¬†1, we observe that computing the softmax attention (Step 2) consistently dominates (52%‚àí58%percent52percent5852\\%-58\\%) the MHA runtime, especially when devices become less powerful and more resource-constrained. Hence, the major bottleneck for ViTs is the softmax attention, which limits their achievable efficiency and scalability, and prohibits extensive real-world ViT applications on resource-constrained devices. To alleviate the above quadratic complexity, a simple approach is to reduce the number of patches or input resolution. However, this would result in larger patch sizes with an additional burden on hardware resources to compute the corresponding queries, keys, and values (Step 1 in Fig.¬†1). Moreover, many real-world computer vision applications, such as medical imaging, autonomous driving, drone imagery and surveillance, etc, require high resolution inputs to discover finer-grained details in the images¬†. A popular alternative approach in Transformers for Natural Language Processing (NLP) is to use sparse attention. Here, the attention matrix generated by the dot product between the dense queries and keys is made sparse by using a binary mask. Then, the sparse attention matrix with reduced entries goes through the softmax operation after which it is multiplied by a dense value matrix. Many works in algorithm¬†  8   9 and hardware¬†1 0 8  2 have been proposed to implement such sparse attentions for NLP-based Transformer models by efficiently tackling various static and dynamic sparse patterns. Orthogonal to the aforementioned techniques, we replace the vanilla softmax attention with a linear attention, and leverage the matrix associative property to linearize the cost of computing ViTs‚Äô attentions. Such linear attention has been proposed for NLP-based Transformer models¬†4 . However, there is a missed opportunity in applying linear attentions to ViTs. Unlike sparsity-based accelerators, we seek to exploit the low-rank property of the proposed linear attention to design dedicated accelerator for improved latency and energy efficiency. Our main contributions are summarized below: We propose an algorithm-accelerator codesign framework, dubbed ViTALiTy, that unifies low-rank and sparse approximation to boost the achievable accuracy-efficiency of ViTs using linear Taylor attentions. To the best of our knowledge, this is first of its kind work dedicated for ViTs by exploiting the low-rank properties in linear attentions. On the algorithm level, we propose a linear attention for reducing the computational and memory cost by decoupling the vanilla softmax attention into its corresponding ‚Äúweak‚Äù and ‚Äústrong‚Äù Taylor attention maps. Unlike the vanilla attentions, the linear attention in ViTALiTy generates a global context matrix ùêÜùêÜ\\mathbf{G} by multiplying the keys with the values. Then, we unify the low-rank property of the linear attention with a sparse approximation of ‚Äústrong‚Äù attention for training the ViT model. Here, the low-rank component of our ViTALiTy attention captures global information with a linear complexity, while the sparse component boosts the accuracy of linear attention model by enhancing its local feature extraction capacity. At the hardware level, we develop a dedicated accelerator to better leverage the algorithmic properties of ViTALiTy‚Äôs linear attention, where only a low-rank component is executed during inference favoring hardware efficiency. Specifically, ViTALiTy‚Äôs accelerator features a chunk-based design integrating both a systolic array tailored for matrix multiplications and pre/post-processors customized for ViTALiTy attentions‚Äô pre/post-processing steps. Furthermore, we adopt an intra-layer pipeline design to leverage the intra-layer data dependency for enhancing the overall throughput, together with a down-forward accumulation dataflow for the systolic array to improve hardware efficiency. We perform extensive experiments and ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of ViTALiTy in terms of latency speedup (3√ó3\\times), and energy efficiency (3√ó3\\times) under comparable model accuracy with respect to the state-of-the-art solution.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: Vision Transformers (ViT) are gaining increasing popularity with their state-of-the-art performance in various computer vision tasks¬† [ref]38  0 6 .
