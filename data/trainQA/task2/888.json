      "content": "Paper Title: Online AUC Optimization for Sparse High-Dimensional Datasets\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets.  We consider the high-dimensional sparse datasets with the task of binary classification. All datasets are summarized in Table I. More specifically, n𝑛n is the total number of samples, n+subscript𝑛n_{+} and n−subscript𝑛n_{-} is the total number of positive and negative samples respectively. Datasets of real-sim, rcv1b, news20b, and avazu can be downloaded from . The dataset of farm-ads  can be downloaded from . There are two sentiment classification datasets, reviews  and imdb . We also consider a click-through rate prediction dataset avazu  which has 1 million features and about 14 millions of training samples.

𝒪​(k)𝒪𝑘\\mathcal{O}(k) tells the number of nonzero entries on 𝒙isubscript𝒙𝑖\\bm{x}_{i} on average. Baseline methods.  We consider two types of method. The first type is for online AUC optimization. It has six methods, including SOLAM, a stochastic online AUC Maximization method proposed in [ref]16, SPAM, a\nstochastic proximal AUC maximization algorithm put forward in  (SPAM-ℓ1superscriptℓ1\\ell^{1}, SPAM-ℓ2superscriptℓ2\\ell^{2}, and SPAM-ℓ1/ℓ2superscriptℓ1superscriptℓ2\\ell^{1}/\\ell^{2} based on the different regularization strategy), FSAUC, a fast\nstochastic algorithm for true AUC maximization designed in , and SPAUC proposed in .333There are other online AUC optimization methods such as OAM , OPAUC  and AdaOAM . However, these algorithms either need to have 𝒪​(d×d)𝒪𝑑𝑑\\mathcal{O}(d\\times d) memory or 𝒪​(T×d)𝒪𝑇𝑑\\mathcal{O}({T\\times d}) run time, which makes them hard to be applied to high-dimensional sparse datasets. The second type is the online learning methods that minimize the logistic loss. We mainly consider the sparse-pursuing ones, including RDA-ℓ1superscriptℓ1\\ell^{1} , AdaGrad , and FTRL-Pro  which is an essentially Follow-The-Regularized-Leader approach proposed in . Experimental setup.  All methods are implemented in C language with a Python2.7 wrapper. We split all datasets in the following way: 4/6 samples are for training and the rest two 1/6 samples for validation and testing respectively. We repeat this procedure 10 times and report the results over these 10 trials. Parameter tuning and other detailed experimental setup can be found in the appendix. All methods stop after seeing all training samples. That is, all methods pass training samples once. AUC scores of all convergence curves in our experiments are calculated by using testing datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: Baseline methods.  We consider two types of method.
