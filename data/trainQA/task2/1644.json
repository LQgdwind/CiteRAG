      "content": "Paper Title: Adversarial Robustness with Non-uniform Perturbations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDifferent levels of robustness of different features have already been studied in the literature  [ref]24 [ref]25.\nAmong these,  and [ref]24 study the effect of robust and non-robust features in standard and adversarial training. Both works show that different types of features might either be vulnerable or robust to small input perturbations. This is a discrete interpretation of different levels of perturbation tolerance which is the core idea of our approach. Both works provide effective theoretical analysis of robust and non-robust features and their effect on clean and adversarial accuracy, while we propose a defense mechanism utilizing this phenomenon. A closely related work to ours is [ref]25 which considers non-uniform perturbation bounds for input features. Given a non-uniform adversarial budget œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon for ‚Ñì‚àûsubscript‚Ñì\\ell_{\\infty} norm bounded inputs, [ref]25 proposes a framework that maximizes the volumes of certified bounds. However, this work only proposes robustness certification of pre-trained models, and does not consider training a robust model against these non-uniform perturbations. The approach is also data-agnostic meaning that it does not take correlations or an additional knowledge on the data into account. We instead use non-uniform perturbations in data-dependent AT to achieve robustness in a DNN model. In fact, [ref]25 mentioned consideration of feature correlations as a potential future direction of their work. In [ref]26, a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) is trained to learn perturbation sets for image data and the generated adversarial images are then used in augmented training. The work proposes robustness against common image corruptions as well as ‚Ñìpsubscript‚Ñìùëù\\ell_{p} perturbations. However, it mainly focuses on possible corruptions and attacks specific to image domain, and assumes access to the test data distribution. In our work, we focus on non-image data which have correlated and different scale features and we do not rely on an additional knowledge of the test set. Recent work in the malware detection space  creates realistic AEs by defining a set of comprehensive and realistic constraints on how an input file can be transformed. Though this approach creates realistic AEs, collecting a representative corpus of raw input files is a challenging problem . The recent release of binary feature sets, such as the EMBER dataset , enables model development without having access to the raw input files. Our work can be used to create more realistic AEs in situations where access to a large representative corpus of files is not possible.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: Different levels of robustness of different features have already been studied in the literature  [ref]24 [ref]25.\nAmong these,  and [ref]24 study the effect of robust and non-robust features in standard and adversarial training.
