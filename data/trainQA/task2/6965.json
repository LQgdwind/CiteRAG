      "content": "Paper Title: Revisiting File Context for Source Code Summarization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA source code “summary” is a short description of that code in natural language. Code summaries have long been at the center of documentation for programmers such as JavaDocs and PyDocs , though recent interest is ballooning for interactive programmer tools and educational systems. Tools with code summarization features such as Github Copilot and ChatGPT have captured the public imagination with their ability to read and describe code. Even a short summary such as “books a seat on an airplane flight” can help a programmer quickly understand what a snippet of source code does without having to read the code itself. The beating heart of almost all source code summarization research is the neural encoder-decoder architecture . The setup is simple. The input to the encoder is the source code to be summarized, while the decoder generates a summary one word at a time. Usually in laboratory settings, the code to be summarized is a single subroutine. The problem with this setup is that not all of the information needed to write a summary of a subroutine is included in that subroutine. Software engineering literature has documented for decades how programmers need summaries to include high-level rationale about why the code exists rather than just restating words from the code itself  . Current approaches struggle to find the right words to provide this rationale because it often does not exist in single subroutine. An alternative model was proposed by Haque et al [ref]16 using “file context.” File context means the other subroutines in the same file as a subroutine under investigation. Haque et al. built an encoder based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) to augment the attention component of the RNN-based encoder-decoder architectures that were prevalent at the time. Experimental results in the original paper and replicated by Bansal et al  showed how the file context encoder could be added to and improves several RNN-based baselines. Since then Transformer-based architectures of superseded RNN-based ones in nearly all respects. Transformer models tended to be able to outperform RNNs even with the file context encoder, when performance is measured by automated metrics over a whole dataset. E.g., BLEU scores were higher over popular benchmark datasets. Yet these results are slightly misleading. In fact, there is a subset of code for which file context helps, and a subset where it does not. Newer models achieve higher BLEU score by boosting performance on part of the dataset, but not in the way in which file context can help. And unfortunately, there is not a clear means to augment Transformer-based models with the encoder proposed by Haque et al [ref]16 due to the differences in how Transformer and RNN-based architectures handle attention. In this paper, we introduce a novel modification to the Transformer architecture for code summarization designed to encode file context. In a nutshell, our approach has two Transformer-based encoders: one for file context and one for the code being described. On the decoder side we use a stack two Transformer-based decoders. The “lower” decoder receives the output of the file context encoder. The “upper” decoder receives the output of the first decoder and the code encoder. This dual encoder design is an alternative to standard transformers that use a giant context window. We show experimentally that our approach outperforms several baselines over three datasets, two in Java and one in Python. We also show how the design decision of a separate encoder for file context helps performance. We show that our approach outperforms other transformer architecture that use a large context window or “prompt”. But more importantly, we show that the performance increase is due to the file context instead of other factors such as scale. We also conduct a human study and report programmer opinions on the quality of summaries generated by our approach, when compared against the best performing baseline.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: code itself  .
