      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Data Augmentation with Online Bilevel Optimization for Image Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur work has similarities with techniques used in the hyperparameter optimization field.\nHyperparameters tuning is important to obtain the best performances when training neural networks on a given dataset. Classic approaches assume that the learning model is a black-box and use methods like grid search, random search [ref]6 , Bayesian optimisation [ref]47, or a tree-search approach [ref]24. These approaches are simple but expensive because they repeat the optimization from scratch for each sampled value of the hyperparameters and so are only applicable to low dimensional hyper-parameter spaces.\nA different line of research is to leverage the gradient of these (continuous) hyperparameters (or hyper-gradients) to perform the hyper-optimization.\nThe first work proposing this idea , shows that the implicit function theorem can be used to this aim.\n was the first work to propose a gradient-based method using a bilevel optimization approach  to learn hyperparameters. Using a bilevel optimization approach to train a neural network is challenging, as usually there is no closed-form expression of the function learned in the inner loop (Section 3).\nTo address this, Maclaurin et al. 4 and later Franceschi et al.  proposed methods to reverse the forward pass to compute the gradient of the validation loss. However, these methods are applicable only when the number of hyperparameters and the complexity of the models are limited due to the memory needed to save the intermediate steps.\nAnother approach to address the computational hurdle in the inner loop is to calculate an approximation of the gradient like in Pedregosa  Luketina et al. 2 or MacKay et al. 3. Our method differentiates from those by using truncated back propagation to estimate the gradient of the validation loss.\nFinally, note that hyper-parameter optimization presents some similarities to meta learning as shown in Franceschi et al. . For instance, in MAML , a shared model initialization is learned to minimize the validation loss and therefore improve the generalization capabilities of the model.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: to obtain the best performances when training neural networks on a given dataset.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
