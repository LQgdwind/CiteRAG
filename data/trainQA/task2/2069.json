      "content": "Paper Title: Relational Reasoning Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRelational Reasoning Networks bridge ideas from different research areas, like logic, neural networks, probability, and, as a result, they present several connections with different AI models. In the following, the links between R2Ns and prominent work in different areas are highlighted. R2Ns and (Probabilistic) Reasoning.  The capability of make inference is a fundamental property of AI systems whose behaviour could be considered intelligent, and possible ways on how to automatize the process of reasoning have received a lot of attention over the years . In forward chaining (or forward reasoning) [ref]30 novel true facts are produced as a result of the application of one or more inference steps, starting with a set of known true facts. In the same spirit, an R2N performs one or more sub-symbolic reasoning steps by manipulating a set of input fact embeddings into a set of refined new ones, accounting for the relational structure of the task.\nProbabilistic reasoners define a more flexible inference process than their counterparts based on standard logic. For example, Statistical Relational Learning approaches like Markov Logic Networks (MLN)  translate a First-Order Logic (FOL) logic theory into an undirected graphical model.\nProbabilistic Soft Logic  tried to overtake the scalability limitations of MLNs by defining a tractable fraction of FOL and relaxing inference using fuzzy logic. R2Ns exploit the same graph construction of MLNs but inference is performed faster as a forward step of a neural architecture. R2Ns and Neuro-Symbolic AI.  Neuro-symbolic methods  bridge the reasoning capabilities of logic reasoners with the ability of sub-symbolic systems to deal with the feature-based representations that typically represent sensorial inputs like video, images or sounds.\nIn particular, neuro-symbolic distillation methods like Semantic-based Regularization [ref]32, teacher-student setups  and Logic Tensor Networks  inject logic knowledge into the network weights by enforcing the knowledge on the predictor outputs.\nIn spite of their simplicity, these methods are powerful when the logic knowledge should be applied to the entire output space in a flat fashion, unlike what is needed to obtain a full probabilistic reasoning process.\nR2Ns define a more flexible employment of the logic knowledge, since reasoning over latent representation learns how and where to apply the available knowledge.\nNeural Logic Machines (NLM) [ref]35 exploit neural networks and logic programming to carry out both inductive learning and logic reasoning tasks. However, NLM could not be applied to Knowledge Graph Embeddings tasks, where the relational information is not fully known. Further NMLs directly compute output Boolean values, which strongly limits the flexibility of reasoning under uncertainty, while reasoning in R2Ns happens at latent level.\nAnother class of neuro-symbolic approaches, like Deep ProbLog ,\nSemantic Loss ,\nDeep Logic Models  and Relational Neural Machines  define directed or undirected graphical models to jointly train predicates approximated by deep learners and reasoning layers in a single differentiable architecture.\nExact inference over the graphical models is generally intractable and these systems rely on heuristics to apply to any real-world problem 0 1.\nLifted Relational Neural Networks 2 and Neural Theorem Provers (NTP)   \nrealize a soft forward or backward chaining via an end-to-end gradient-based scheme. NTP allows soft-unification among symbols using a tensorial representation to allow a more flexible matching. However, this introduces scalability issues as reasoning paths can not be easily pruned without relying on heuristics.\nNeural LP  learns rules using differentiable operators defined in TensorLog 3, which is a framework to get advantage of deep learning computational power to perform probabilistic logical reasoning.\nUnlike this class of models, R2N approximates relational inference using a forward step in a neural architecture and can scale up to much larger problems. R2Ns and KGEs. \nWith the emergence of Knowledge Graphs (KG), representation learning has played a pivotal role in learning embedding spaces, which allow efficient inference and query answering.\nKnowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE), initially built from the statistical co-occurrences of entities and relations, have been later enriched with semantic information carried by higher-level logic knowledge to improve embedding accuracy and explainability. As an example of this line of research, both probabilistic Logic Neural Networks 4 and the work by Niu at al. 5 inject logic knowledge into a KGE. However, both approaches require strong assumptions on the form of the distributions to make inference tractable.\nAnother related class of approaches uses KGs for question answering by modeling multi-hop reasoning in latent space. For example, MINERVA  learns to do query answering by walking on a knowledge graph conditioned on a query, and then by stopping when reaching the answer node.\nDeepPath 6 uses reinforcement learning to find paths in a KG but, like 7, its applicability is limited to cases where the target entity is known in advance. R2Ns and GNNs.  Finally, R2N is related to a recent line of research using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)   to approximate inference in PGMs.\nStandard GNNs are examples of Message Passing Neural Networks , whose expressiveness can be interpreted in terms of two variable counting logic 8, a small fragment of First-Order Logic.\nIn order to overtake the limitations of standard GNNs in approximating inference, some authors have proposed hybrid models where GNNs are integrated to replace one step of a traditional inference algorithm like Belief Propagation 9 .\nOther work has instead attempted at defining higher-order GNNs  which yield expressive models at the cost of a combinatorial explosion of the higher-order edges. R2Ns stand in the middle of standard GNNs and higher-order GNNs as the logic provides a bias on which “higher-order edges” (i.e. factors) to instantiate.\nThe proposed model can indeed be seen as a higher-order GNN, where the layers computing the factor representations process the higher-order information. In this regard, R2N is related to Factor Graph Neural Networks (FGNN) , but applied to structures representing a grounded FOL logic theory.\nUnlike FGNNs, R2Ns are aware of the order of the in-going and outgoing edges in the factor graph. In particular, M​L​Pj1𝑀𝐿subscriptsuperscript𝑃1𝑗MLP^{1}_{j} concatenates its in-going messages following the order in which atoms appear in a rule, and one different M​L​Pj,i2𝑀𝐿subscriptsuperscript𝑃2𝑗𝑖MLP^{2}_{j,i} is specialized to correctly predict the embedding for the i𝑖i-th element in the list of the outgoing neighbors.\nFurthermore, unlike what done by FGNNs, R2N is designed to work in a neuro-symbolic environment, where the input representations are also co-developed during training. R2Ns are also related to graph recurrent neural networks (like graph LSTMs) with constrained gating mechanisms  . Here, activation in both the spatial and temporal domain are constrained to be coherent. Other GNNs have been defined to process the KG topological structure. For example, ExpressGNN  attempts at overtaking the scalability limitations of probabilistic reasoning approaches using a GNN defined over the KG to embed the constants. Since the employed GNN does not have enough expressive power to perform reasoning, as there are isomorphic substructures in the KG that can not be distinguished, reasoning is performed via an external variational process.\nA similar relational structure is considered by Discriminative Gaifman models , which translate FOL formulas into a set of features.\nUnlike this class of models, the proposed architecture directly compiles the relational structures required to approximate the reasoning process into the model architecture. Therefore, R2N can embed the constants and the atoms via the knowledge in the forward step of the network without employing an external inference step.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: could be considered intelligent, and possible ways on how to automatize the process of reasoning have received a lot of attention over the years .
