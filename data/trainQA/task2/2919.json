      "content": "Paper Title: False Correlation Reduction for Offline Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe techniques used in most existing works in offline RL algorithms fall into two categories, namely, policy-constrained methods and value-penalized methods. Policy-constrained methods defend against OOD actions by restricting the hypothesis space of the policy. For example, BCQ  [ref]1 and EMaQ  exclusively consider actions proposed by the estimated behavioral policy. Alternatively, some methods     [ref]23 reformulate the policy optimization problem as a constrained optimization problem to keep the learned policy sufficiently close to the behavioral policy. More recently, Fujimoto et al.  proposes a simple yet effective solution by directly using behavioral cloning in policy optimization. In brief, policy-constraint approaches have an intuitive motivation but often struggle to outperform the behavioral policy. While SCORE’s regularization term also adopts the policy-constraint technique, it is improved by a decaying factor that avoids an explicit reliance on the behavioral policy. Alternatively, the value-penalized methods steer the policy towards training distribution by penalizing the value of OOD actions. For example, CQL  explicitly minimizes the action value of OOD data via a value regularization term. MOPO  and MOReL  learn pessimistic dynamic models and use model uncertainty as the penalty. However, in a subsequent work , the authors claim that the model uncertainty for complex dynamics tends to be unreliable and revert to the CQL-type penalty method. Instead of explicitly learning the dynamics and then inferring its uncertainty, SCORE utilizes bootstrapped q-networks to estimate uncertainty, providing reliable estimations. Some model-free methods also use uncertainty to construct the penalty term. For example, UWAC [ref]23 proposes to use Monte Carlo (MC) dropout to quantify uncertainty and perform uncertainty-weighted updates. This method relies on a strong policy-constrained method ; more importantly, the dropout method does not converge with increasing data .\nEDAC  proposes to use a large number of networks to guarantee diversification so that OOD actions are sufficiently penalized via the traditional min-Q objective. PBRL  introduces an OOD sampling procedure similar to CQL and a pseudo target punished by the uncertainty for OOD actions.\nTheoretically, PBRL analyzes the connection between bootstrapped uncertainty and the LCB penalty, but it does not explicitly address the algorithm’s convergence rate. In contrast, SCORE is supported by a thorough theoretical analysis showing that it achieves a sublinear convergence rate. Since SCORE does not need to sample OOD data, its convergence result remains valid even without access to the exact value of OOD samples. In addition to algorithmic advances, some research works study the detrimental effects of false correlation from the theoretical perspective. To deal with this problem, most existing works impose various assumptions on the sufficient coverage of the dataset, e.g., the ratio between the visitation measure of the target policy and that of the behavior policy to be upper bounded uniformly over the state-action space    0 1 2 3 4 5, or the concentrability coefficient to be upper bounded 6 7 8 9 0 1.\nUntil recently, without assuming sufficient coverage of the dataset, Jin et al. [ref]5 incorporate pessimism into value iteration to establish a data-dependent upper bound on the suboptimality in episodic MDPs.\nWe take a step forward from the theoretical result in [ref]5, extending it to address infinite-horizon regularized MDPs and incorporating the policy optimization process, which bridges the gap between theory and practice. Our algorithm converges to an optimal policy with a sublinear rate, relying on a minimal assumption regarding the compliance of the dataset. Specifically, we assume the data collection process aligns with the MDP of interest.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: categories, namely, policy-constrained methods and value-penalized methods.
