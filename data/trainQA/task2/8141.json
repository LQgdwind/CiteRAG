      "content": "Paper Title: New Lower Bound and Algorithms for Online Geometric Hitting Set Problem\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe study the online hitting set problem when only the set 𝒫𝒫{\\mathcal{P}} of points is known in advance.\nThe set 𝒮𝒮\\cal S of objects is not known a priori; elements of this set are revealed one by one. The algorithm needs to maintain a hitting set for the revealed objects by choosing points from 𝒫𝒫{\\mathcal{P}}.\nOnce a point is included in the solution set, the decision cannot be reverted in the future.\nBelow, we mention each contribution formally and discuss the context and comparison to prior work. A New Improved Lower Bound. First, we establish that the competitive ratio of any algorithm, whether deterministic or randomized, is Ω​(d​log⁡M)Ω𝑑𝑀\\Omega(d\\log M) for hitting homothetic hypercubes with side lengths in the range [1,M]1𝑀[1,M] using points in ℤdsuperscriptℤ𝑑\\mathbb{Z}^{d} (Theorem 3.4). This improves the current best-known deterministic lower bound of Ω​(log⁡M)Ω𝑀\\Omega(\\log M)  by a factor of d𝑑d.\nTo obtain the lower bound, we use Yao’s minimax principle (as in ). We first construct a complete binary tree 𝒯𝒯{\\mathcal{T}} of height O​(d​log⁡M)𝑂𝑑𝑀O(d\\log M), where each path from the root to a leaf of 𝒯𝒯{\\mathcal{T}} represents a sequence of similarly sized homothetic hypercubes. If any path of 𝒯𝒯{\\mathcal{T}} from the root node to one of the leaf nodes is presented at random as an input sequence, then we bound the competitive ratio of any deterministic algorithm for this random input sequence. An Almost Tight Algorithm for Hypercubes. Next, we consider the hitting set problem using points in ℤdsuperscriptℤ𝑑\\mathbb{Z}^{d}, where objects are (axis-aligned) hypercubes having side lengths in [1,M]1𝑀[1,M] and d≥3𝑑3d\\geq 3.\nSince the value of α𝛼\\alpha is 111 for (axis-aligned) hypercubes, the best known competitive ratio for this problem was 25d​log⁡Msuperscript25𝑑𝑀25^{d}\\log M due to Alefkhani et al. .\nWe propose a randomized algorithm LayeredRIRLayeredRIR\\operatorname{\\textsc{LayeredRIR}} that achieves a competitive ratio of O​(d2​log⁡M)𝑂superscript𝑑2𝑀O(d^{2}\\log M) (Theorem 4.2).\nThe algorithm LayeredRIRLayeredRIR\\operatorname{\\textsc{LayeredRIR}} uses a generalized version of an algorithm by De and Singh , designed for hitting unit hypercubes using points in ℤdsuperscriptℤ𝑑\\mathbb{Z}^{d}. To accomplish this, we introduce two concepts: layer formation and core construction. Although the layer formation technique has been used before , our approach differs from prior implementations.\nWe partition the set of homothetic hypercubes into layers such that each hypercube within a particular layer contains at least 2dsuperscript2𝑑2^{d} points and at most 3dsuperscript3𝑑3^{d} points from (s​ℤ)dsuperscript𝑠ℤ𝑑(s\\mathbb{Z})^{d}, where the value of s𝑠s will depend on the layer of the object. Since hypercubes within each layer are not of the same size, we cannot directly apply the generalized version of De and Singh’s algorithm. This takes us to the introduction of the core construction concept, where we create a core object for each hypercube in a layer. This core object contains the same set of points from (s​ℤ)dsuperscript𝑠ℤ𝑑(s\\mathbb{Z})^{d} as the original object but has a fixed side length dependent on the layer. This allows us to use the generalized version of De and Singh’s algorithm effectively.\nHere is a brief overview of our algorithm. Upon the arrival of a new hypercube, if it is not hit by previously selected points, we first determine the layer. We then evoke the generalized algorithm of  to hit the core of the object using points in (s​ℤ)dsuperscript𝑠ℤ𝑑(s\\mathbb{Z})^{d}, where s𝑠s will depend on the layer. We show that algorithm LayeredRIRLayeredRIR\\operatorname{\\textsc{LayeredRIR}} achieves a competitive ratio of O​(d2​log⁡M)𝑂superscript𝑑2𝑀O(d^{2}\\log M) (Theorem 4.2). An Exponential Improved Competitive Algorithm for Fat Objects.\nFat objects have several desirable properties and are well-studied due to their various applications and appearance in geometric problems [ref]5  .\nWe focus on the hitting set problem, where the set 𝒫=ℤd𝒫superscriptℤ𝑑{\\mathcal{P}}=\\mathbb{Z}^{d} and the set 𝒮𝒮\\cal S consists of similarly sized α𝛼\\alpha-fat objects in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} having widths in the range [1,M]1𝑀[1,M]. For this, we present a deterministic algorithm CloseToCenterCloseToCenter\\operatorname{\\textsc{CloseToCenter}}, which is as follows: Upon the arrival of a new object σ𝜎\\sigma with width w𝑤w, if σ𝜎\\sigma is not hit by the previously selected points, our algorithm identifies a point r∈(2i+1​ℤ)d𝑟superscriptsuperscript2𝑖1ℤ𝑑r\\in(2^{i+1}\\mathbb{Z})^{d} to hit σ𝜎\\sigma, where i=⌊log⁡w⌋𝑖𝑤i=\\lfloor\\log w\\rfloor. We show that this algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of at most ⌊2α+2⌋d​(⌊log2⁡M⌋+1)superscript2𝛼2𝑑subscript2𝑀1{\\lfloor\\frac{2}{\\alpha}+2\\rfloor^{d}}\\left(\\lfloor\\log_{2}M\\rfloor+1\\right) (Theorem 5.2).\nThe previous best-known upper bound for this problem due to Alefkhani et al.  was (4α+1)2​d​log⁡Msuperscript4𝛼12𝑑𝑀\\left(\\frac{4}{\\alpha}+1\\right)^{2d}\\log M. Note that (4α+1)d​(4α+1)d≥(5)d​(4α+1)d>(5)d​(2α+2)dsuperscript4𝛼1𝑑superscript4𝛼1𝑑superscript5𝑑superscript4𝛼1𝑑superscript5𝑑superscript2𝛼2𝑑\\left(\\frac{4}{\\alpha}+1\\right)^{d}\\left(\\frac{4}{\\alpha}+1\\right)^{d}\\geq\\left(5\\right)^{d}\\left(\\frac{4}{\\alpha}+1\\right)^{d}>\\left(5\\right)^{d}\\left(\\frac{2}{\\alpha}+2\\right)^{d}. Since the value of α𝛼\\alpha is in the range (0,1]01(0,1] and 4α+1=2α+2α+1≥2α+2+1>2α+24𝛼12𝛼2𝛼12𝛼212𝛼2\\frac{4}{\\alpha}+1=\\frac{2}{\\alpha}+\\frac{2}{\\alpha}+1\\geq\\frac{2}{\\alpha}+2+1>\\frac{2}{\\alpha}+2, the first and second inequalities hold.\nThus, our result improves the upper bound of Alefkhani et al.  by a factor of at least 5dsuperscript5𝑑5^{d} which is an exponential improvement. An O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) Competetive Algorithm for Similarly Sized Homothetic Regular k𝑘k-gons.\nFinally, we consider the hitting set problem, where the set 𝒫⊂ℝ2𝒫superscriptℝ2{\\mathcal{P}}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{2} consists of n𝑛n points and the set 𝒮𝒮\\cal S consists of similarly sized homothetic regular k𝑘k-gons (k≥4𝑘4k\\geq 4) having diameters in the range [1,M]1𝑀[1,M].\nFor this, we\npropose a randomized algorithm LayeredESLayeredES\\operatorname{\\textsf{{LayeredES}}}\nhaving a competitive ratio of O​(log⁡n​log⁡M)𝑂𝑛𝑀O(\\log n\\log M) (Theorem 6.7). In this setup, no algorithm was known, even for squares, as mentioned earlier. In fact,\nboth Alefkhani et al.  and Khan et al. 4 posed it as an open problem to design an online algorithm having a competitive ratio of O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) for hitting squares using a set P⊂ℝ2𝑃superscriptℝ2P\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{2} of n𝑛n points. Thus, for a fixed M𝑀M, the above-mentioned outcome affirmatively answers this open problem. On the way to design our algorithm LayeredESLayeredES\\operatorname{\\textsf{{LayeredES}}}, we propose an O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) competitive deterministic algorithm for translates of a regular k𝑘k-gon (Theorem 6.5) that is similar to the algorithm of Even and Smorodinsky  for hitting translates of a disk. We show how to implement their algorithm without the knowledge of the set of objects beforehand. In particular, we show how to find the extreme points (defined in Section 6) used to hit the introduced objects without knowing the objects (Lemma 6.1). Along the way of extending the result of unit balls to regular k𝑘k-gons, we obtain a key property (Lemma 6.4) of regular k𝑘k-gons that apparently was known only for unit disks. We refer to the property as angle property. We feel this would be of independent interest, and it will find its applications in other geometric problems.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: Exponential Improved Competitive Algorithm for Fat Objects.\nFat objects have several desirable properties and are well-studied due to their various applications and appearance in geometric problems [ref]5  .\nWe focus on the hitting set problem, where the set 𝒫=ℤd𝒫superscriptℤ𝑑{\\mathcal{P}}=\\mathbb{Z}^{d} and the set 𝒮𝒮\\cal S consists of similarly sized α𝛼\\alpha-fat objects in\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
