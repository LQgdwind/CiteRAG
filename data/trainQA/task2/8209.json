Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5.

Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: WorkflowHub: a registry for computational workflows\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWorkflowHub engages and supports a broad set of use cases, including numerous projects and consortia of global significance. Major projects are supported so that their members are able to use WorkflowHub in a way that aligns with the expectations of their project and its funders. Workflow communities (e.g. nf-core, CWL, Snakemake) are directly engaged by the WorkflowHub team, and supported to make their best practice workflows available in the registry. The main mechanism through which engagement happens is the fortnightly open format WorkflowHub Club meeting454545https://about.workflowhub.eu/#community, where anyone can join the conversation, learn more about the registry, ask questions, and even contribute to the on-going development and evolution of the registry. There are also indirect ways through which workflow creators and users interact with WorkflowHub and its resources. The WorkflowHub Club team creates and presents content for the registry at conferences, in webinars and workshops, and as part of Ask-Me-Anything forum events464646https://about.workflowhub.eu/project/outreach/. Registered users of WorkflowHub are also able to ask questions and provide direct feedback via the registry interface. These communications are sent directly to the administrators of WorkflowHub for review and response. Finally, WorkflowHub operates a documentation site where users can access information on how to use the registry474747https://about.workflowhub.eu/docs/. Clear and practical guidelines are required to support users of WorkflowHub. For example, some annotations are consistently missing from workflow entries, and useful features are sometimes overlooked (e.g. Git integration, parsing of CITATION.cff files, linking data to workflows, and linking workflows to each other). This highlights that the rich feature set of WorkflowHub is not necessarily immediately clear, and that guidance in leveraging these features is absolutely critical to support users in achieving best practice. It is important that the provided guidelines also extend to recommendations for how to organise a workflow development repository (i.e. Git repositories). This will enable WorkflowHub to extend the process currently in place for Galaxy IWC to more community repositories: integrating with these repositories in a more standard way to automatically manage the update of workflow versions in WorkflowHub, such that they are in sync with Git releases. As a result, and as highlighted earlier, a general onboarding and set up guide for projects and consortia has been developed , as have multiple consortia specific guides   . Workflow resources have also been developed for the Galaxy Training Network (GTN ) Smörgåsbord events484848https://gallantries.github.io/video-library/modules/ro-crate and specific GTN tutorial sets494949https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/fair/. Finally, the WorkflowHub team actively identifies opportunities to engage with peer infrastructures to grow the user base of the registry, investigate and create integrations that are of enduring value, and further improve the function of the registry. For example, WorkflowHub is actively fostering a conversation with publishers and journals focused on how to make workflows citable objects in the literature . WorkflowHub is also being further developed to fully align with the best practice guidelines of the SciCodes Consortium , implement the FAIR Principles for Research Software (FAIR4RS)  and contribute to the CodeMeta specification for software . As described earlier, a registry like WorkflowHub enables the creation of workflows that follow the FAIR principles, from the perspective of data , software , and the unique features of workflows (e.g. abstraction, composition). WorkflowHub is central to discussions in the FAIR Computational Workflows working group for the Workflows Community Initiative (WCI505050https://workflows.community/groups/fair/). This working group engages broadly across the global workflows ecosystem (i.e. workflow developers, communities, platforms and services) to develop FAIR principles for workflows [ref]17. The ultimate aim is to use the outcomes of these engagements to guide the evolution of WorkflowHub as a FAIR registry for workflows.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: This working group engages broadly across the global workflows ecosystem (i.e. workflow developers, communities, platforms and services) to develop FAIR principles for workflows [ref]17. The ultimate aim is to use the outcomes of these engagements to guide the evolution of WorkflowHub as a FAIR registry for workflows.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object. Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. Generate exactly 40 titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning."
