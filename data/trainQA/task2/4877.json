      "content": "Paper Title: A Secure Federated Data-Driven Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization Algorithm\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCanonical BO algorithms suffer from both security and privacy issues. Adversarial attacks are the most popular attacks, which aim to mislead the BO by making the regret of suggesting appropriate querying points as high as possible. This type of attacks was successfully launched in , which achieved the targeted attacks on GP bandits. Adversial parties can attempt to eavesdrop on private information in an optimization task, such as objective values, decision variables, constraints, or ranking of solutions, depending on what is believed to be sensitive for a special task. Most approaches in privacy-preserving optimization algorithms assume the decision variables and objectives are sensitive. For instance, the rankings of individuals are treated as insensitive in  and transmitted to a service provider to drive the optimization process with the aim of protecting the real objective values. Another approach is to directly mask or encrypt the sensitive objective or decision values using DP  and homomorphic encryption (HE) , which are two representative additional privacy-preserving techniques to enhance the security level of FL, BO, and evolutionary algorithms. DP is considered to be the most secure perturbation-based privacy protection method, which can provide statistical privacy guarantees for individual records and prevent inference attacks on the model without incurring additional computational overhead compared to the encryption methods. However, such systems tend to generate less accurate models due to the added noise in the learning process. In the differential private BO , Laplace noise is added at the end of the optimization process to ensure the hyperparameters of the neural network are private and near-optimal. However, adding the Laplace noise to the end of the optimization process still has the potential privacy issues of the data leakages. An alternative solution is to add local differential noise to the real objective value in each round of the surrogate update, which can ensure that the best objective value of each client is preserved [ref]39. Recently, Kharkovskii et al. proposes to send transformed sets of the decision variables to the service provider, and the BO process is conducted based on the transformed decision variables to protect the query input . However, the objective values are still directly exposed to the service provider in  under this scenario. To protect both decision variables and objective values, Honkela et al.  propose to adopt a sparse GP, which adds Gaussian noise to the corresponding terms of the posterior prediction. By doing so, the decision variables and objective values of the raw data can be kept confidential when conducting inference on unobserved points. Apart from directly adding noise to the objective values like [ref]39 in regression tasks, DP is also extended to handle expensive classification problems for data protection. Authors in [ref]41 adopt the Laplace noise generation mechanism and implements it in the expected value of the classification probability, and accomplish classification tasks with an embedded squash function. Finally, HE has been introduced in constructing the GP  for protecting data privacy. HE requires that the ciphertext can be directly operated algebraically (typically by addition or multiplication), and the result must be the same as that obtained by using plaintext operations followed by encryption. However, HE cannot be directly applied to federated learning or federated Bayesian optimization. For example, in collaborative scenarios, it remains unclear which client should hold the key. In this regard, an attempt has been made in the literature  to propose a distributed key-based HE solution for performing summation computations among untrusted clients. However, the computational cost required to achieve fully HE is extremely high and almost impractical to apply in a federated learning scenario.\nThere are only a few pieces of research on how to embed HE into evolutionary optimization or GP modeling for privacy reasons. Earlier work such as  implements a HE scheme to achieve a collaborative solving of multi-objective optimization tasks between a producer and a supplier entity by securely encrypting the overall optimization process of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. HE is also studied along the line of BO to handle expensive problems, where computational cost is a key consideration.\nTo reduce the computational cost, a modular approach to GP modeling is suggested . As an extension of privacy-preserving GP regression to BO, the GP must be updated iteratively, making it computationally prohibitive. To sum up, the aforementioned methods are independent of each other and there are various approaches that can be employed by federated BO to enhance privacy guarantees. Although most existing federated learning systems using DP or HE can achieve good privacy guarantees, some limitations of these methods are currently difficult to overcome. The degradation of model accuracy due to DP methods is more unacceptable for industrial users than the large computational overhead associated with encryption algorithms, as opposed to individual users. Thus, it is necessary to find a novel approach that combines data privacy protection with flexible privacy requirements.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: alternative solution is to add local differential noise to the real objective value in each round of the surrogate update, which can ensure that the best objective value of each client is preserved [ref]39.
