      "content": "Paper Title: Bypassing Logits Bias in Online Class-Incremental Learning with a Generative Framework\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nProposed generative framework is based on ER strategy, and aims to avoid the intrinsic logits bias problem by removing the softmax FC layer g𝑔g and build a generative classifier on the feature space 𝒵:𝒛=f​(𝒙):𝒵𝒛𝑓𝒙\\mathcal{Z}:\\bm{z}=f(\\bm{x}). If the feature 𝒛𝒛\\bm{z} is well discriminative, we can conduct inference with samples in ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} instead of a parametric classifier which is prone to catastrophic forgetting [ref]10. We use NCM classifier firstly suggested by [ref]10 for CL and show it is a generative model. We use ℳcsubscriptℳ𝑐\\mathcal{M}_{c} to denote the subset of class c𝑐c of ℳℳ\\mathcal{M}. The class mean 𝝁csubscript𝝁𝑐{\\bm{\\mu}}_{c} is computed by 𝝁cℳ=1|ℳc|​∑𝒙∈ℳcf​(𝒙)superscriptsubscript𝝁𝑐ℳ1subscriptℳ𝑐subscript𝒙subscriptℳ𝑐𝑓𝒙{\\bm{\\mu}}_{c}^{\\mathcal{M}}=\\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{M}_{c}|}\\sum_{\\bm{x}\\in\\mathcal{M}_{c}}f(\\bm{x}).\nDuring inference, the prediction for 𝒙∗superscript𝒙\\bm{x}^{*} is made by: In fact, the principle of prediction in Eq (2) is to find a Gaussian distribution 𝒩​(f​(𝒙∗)|𝝁cℳ,𝐈)𝒩conditional𝑓superscript𝒙superscriptsubscript𝝁𝑐ℳ𝐈\\mathcal{N}(f(\\bm{x}^{*})|{\\bm{\\mu}}_{c}^{\\mathcal{M}},\\mathbf{I}) with the maximal probability for 𝒙∗superscript𝒙\\bm{x}^{*}. Therefore, assuming the conditional distribution p​(𝒛|y=c)=𝒩​(𝒛|𝝁cℳ,𝐈)𝑝conditional𝒛𝑦𝑐𝒩conditional𝒛superscriptsubscript𝝁𝑐ℳ𝐈p(\\bm{z}|y=c)=\\mathcal{N}(\\bm{z}|{\\bm{\\mu}}_{c}^{\\mathcal{M}},\\mathbf{I}) and the prior distribution p​(y)𝑝𝑦p(y) is uniform, NCM classifier virtually deals with p​(y|𝒛)𝑝conditional𝑦𝒛p(y|\\bm{z}) by modeling p​(𝒛|y)𝑝conditional𝒛𝑦p(\\bm{z}|y) in a generative way. The inference way is according to Bayes rule: arg⁡maxp​(y|𝒙∗)=arg⁡maxp​(f​(𝒙∗)|y)​p​(y)𝑝conditional𝑦superscript𝒙𝑝conditional𝑓superscript𝒙𝑦𝑝𝑦\\mathop{\\arg\\max}p(y|\\bm{x}^{*})=\\mathop{\\arg\\max}p(f(\\bm{x}^{*})|y)p(y). The assumption about p​(y)𝑝𝑦p(y) simplifies the analysis and works well in practice. In contrast, softmax classifier models p​(y|𝒙∗)𝑝conditional𝑦superscript𝒙p(y|\\bm{x}^{*}) in a typical discriminative way. As discussed above, online CIL is in a low data setting where generative classifiers are preferable compared to discriminative classifiers [ref]17. Moreover, generative classifiers are more robust to continual learning [ref]18 and imbalanced data settings . At each iteration, ℬn∪ℬrsubscriptℬ𝑛subscriptℬ𝑟\\mathcal{B}_{n}\\cup\\mathcal{B}_{r} is also highly imbalanced. Considering these results, we hypothesis generative classifiers are promising for online CIL problem. It should be noted our method only models a simple generative classifier p​(𝒛|y)𝑝conditional𝒛𝑦p(\\bm{z}|y) on the feature space, instead of modeling p​(𝒙|y)𝑝conditional𝒙𝑦p(\\bm{x}|y) on the input space using DNNs [ref]18, which is time-consuming and thus is not suitable for online training.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: If the feature 𝒛𝒛\\bm{z} is well discriminative, we can conduct inference with samples in ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} instead of a parametric classifier which is prone to catastrophic forgetting [ref]10.
