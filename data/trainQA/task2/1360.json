      "content": "Paper Title: Measuring Disentanglement: A Review of Metrics\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFactor independence means that variation in one factor does not affect other factors, i.e. there is no causal effect between them . In a disentangled representation factors are also independent in the representation space. In other words, a factor affects only a subset of the representation space, and only this factor affects this subspace. Most authors agree on the importance of this property which has different names (e.g., disentanglement [ref]5, modularity [ref]6). In this paper, we use the naming convention of [ref]6 and refer to this property as modularity. Some authors argue that the subset of the representation space affected by a factor should be as small as possible. Ideally, only one dimension completely describes a factor. This property is called completeness in [ref]5, but is called compactness in [ref]6. In this paper we refer to this property as compactness. The desirability of compactness relates to the type of factors for a given application. As argued in [ref]6, enforcing compactness may be counterproductive. A group of code dimensions provides more flexibility when describing complex factors [ref]33. For instance, if an angle is represented as a single value Œ∏‚àà[0,2‚ÄãœÄ]ùúÉ02ùúã\\theta\\in[0,2\\pi], there is a discontinuity in the space at 2‚ÄãœÄ2ùúã2\\pi. Alternatively, if two dimensions encode the angle (e.g. sin‚Å°Œ∏ùúÉ\\sin{\\theta} and cos‚Å°Œ∏ùúÉ\\cos{\\theta}), continuity is preserved. Furthermore, sometimes factors are complex concepts like facial expression  or phonetic content , which are unlikely describable by a 1-dimensional space. As a second argument against enforcing strict compactness, Ridgeway and Mozer[ref]6 explain that allowing redundancy in the learned latent space allows for different equivalent solutions, which facilitate model optimization from a practical standpoint. All metrics assume that a set of independent factors exists in the problem. However, in practice, identifying useful and interpretable independent factors represents a challenging task . Factors must be conceptually independent, but should also be statistically independent . This condition is hard to satisfy in real-world data sets where certain factor realizations tend to co-occur more than others  . For example, in a data set of fruit images, we could be interested in two conceptually different factors: fruit type and color. However, color is statistically dependent on the fruit type. Dependent factors impact modularity score. If two factors were to share information, parts of the representation relate to both. The selection of factors is application-specific and is beyond the scope of this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: affects only a subset of the representation space, and only this factor affects this subspace.
