      "content": "Paper Title: Learning 3D Face Reconstruction with a Pose Guidance Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMost recent 3D face shape models are derived from Blanz and Vetter 3D morphable models (3DMM) [ref]7, which represents 3D faces with linear combination of PCA-faces from a collection of 3D face scans. To make 3DMM more representative, Basel Face Model (BFM)  improved shape and texture accuracy, and FaceWarehouse 9 constructed a set of individual-specific expression blend-shapes. Our approach is also built on 3DMM — we aim to predict 3DMM parameters to reconstruct 3D faces from monocular frames. 3D Face Landmark Detection and Reconstruction. 3D face landmark detection and 3D face reconstruction are closely related. On the one hand, if the 3DMM parameters can be estimated accurately, face landmark detection can be greatly improved, especially for the occluded landmarks 5. Therefore, several approaches 5 0 1 aligned 3D face by fitting a 3DMM model. On the other hand, if 3D face landmarks are precisely estimated, it can provide strong guidance for 3D face reconstruction. Our method goes towards the second direction—we first estimates 3D face landmarks by regressing UV position map and then utilizes it to guide 3D face reconstruction. 3D Face Reconstruction from a Single Image. To reconstruct 3D faces from a single image, prior methods   2 usually conduct iterative optimization methods to fit 3DMM models by leveraging facial landmarks or local features e.g., color or edges. However, the convergence of optimization is very sensitive to the initial parameters.\nTremendous progress has been made by CNNs that directly regress 3DMM parameters 5 3 4.\nJackson et al. 5 directly regressed the full 3D facial structure via volumetric convolution.\nFeng et al. 6 predicted a UV position map to represent the full 3D shape. MMFace 2 jointly trained a volumetric network and a parameter regression network, where the former one is employed to refine pose parameters with ICP as a post-processing.\nAll these three methods need to be trained in a supervised manner, requiring full 3D face annotations, which are limited at scale 5. To bypass the limitation of training data, Tewari et al. 6 and Genova et al. 7 proposed to fit 3DMM models with only unlabeled images. They show that it is possible to achieve great face reconstruction in an unsupervised manner by minimizing photometric consistency or facial identity loss. Later, Chang et al. 8 proposed to regress identity, expression and pose parameters with three independent networks. However, due to depth ambiguity, these unsupervised monocular methods fail to capture precise 3D facial structure.\nIn this paper, we propose to mitigate the limitation of datasets by utilizing both labeled and unlabeled datasets, and to learn better facial geometry from multiple frames. 3D Face Reconstruction from Multiple Images.\nMultiple images of the same person contain rich information for learning better 3D face reconstruction.\nPiotraschke et al. 9 introduced an automated algorithm that selects and combines reconstructions of different facial regions from multiple images into a single 3D face. RingNet 1 considered shape consistency across different images of the same person, while we focus on face reconstruction from videos, where photometric consistency can be well employed. MVF 4 regressed 3DMM parameters from multi-view images. However, MVF assumes that the expressions in different views are the same, therefore its application is restricted to multi-view images. Our method does not have such constraint and can be applied to both single-view and multi-view 3D face reconstruction. The approach that is closest to ours is FML , which learns face reconstruction from monocular videos by ensuring consistent shape and appearance across frames. However, it only adds multi-frame identity consistency constraints, which does not fully utilize geometric constraints among different images. Unlike FML, we do not model albedo to estimate texture parameters, but directly sample textures from images, swap commonly visible texture and project them onto different image planes while enforcing photometric and semantic consistency. Additionally, we introduce a PGN, which removes the need of pose parameter estimation and enables our model to produce more accurate identity and expression estimation.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Most recent 3D face shape models are derived from Blanz and Vetter 3D morphable models (3DMM) [ref]7, which represents 3D faces with linear combination of PCA-faces from a collection of 3D face scans.
