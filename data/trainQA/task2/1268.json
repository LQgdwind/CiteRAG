      "content": "Paper Title: Quantum learning algorithms imply circuit lower bounds\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere is a rich history of connections between circuit complexity theory and the investigation of learning algorithms. In many cases, specific circuit lower bound techniques have been used to design new algorithms. For instance, Linial, Mansour, and Nisan  relied on the method of random restrictions to show that constant-depth polynomial-size circuits can be PAC-learned in quasi-polynomial time under the uniform distribution from random examples. In a more recent development, Carmosino, Impagliazzo, Kabanets, and Kolokolva  showed that learning algorithms can be obtained from any lower bound technique that is “constructive” in the sense of the theory of natural proofs of Razborov and Rudich . This allowed them to show that constant-depth polynomial-size circuits augmented with parity gates can be PAC learned in quasi-polynomial time under the uniform distribution from membership queries. These, and several other results (cf. Servedio and Tan ), show that a circuit lower bound against a circuit class 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}, in most cases, can be converted into a learning algorithm for 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}. The first results in the opposite direction, i.e., showing that learning algorithms imply circuit lower bounds, were established by Fortnow and Klivans [ref]21. In their work, among other results, they proved that any sub-exponential time (i.e., 2no​(1)superscript2superscript𝑛𝑜12^{n^{o(1)}}), deterministic exact learning algorithm for 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} (using membership and equivalence queries) implies the existence of a function in 𝖤𝖭𝖯superscript𝖤𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{E}^{\\mathsf{NP}} that is not in 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}. They also showed that if 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is PAC learnable with membership queries under the uniform distribution or exact learnable in randomized polynomial-time, there is a function in 𝖡𝖯𝖤𝖡𝖯𝖤\\mathsf{BPE} (an exponential time analog of 𝖡𝖯𝖯𝖡𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{BPP}) that is not in 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}. Note that these results have the appealing feature that they make no assumption about the techniques employed in the design of the learning algorithm. Nevertheless, there is an important drawback in the initial results of [ref]21: they make strong assumptions about the resources of the learning algorithm. For example, many learning algorithms are randomized and require at least quasi-polynomial time (e.g.,  ), and the results from [ref]21 do not apply in this case. Over the last decade several works have addressed this and other aspects of the learning-to-lower-bound connection. Harkins and Hitchcock  eliminated the 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP} oracle and showed that 𝖤⊈𝒞not-subset-of-nor-equals𝖤𝒞\\mathsf{E}\\nsubseteq\\mathcal{C} from the existence of exact deterministic sub-exponential time learning algorithms with membership and equivalence queries. Shortly after, Klivans, Kothari, and Oliveira  simplified these proofs, strengthened a few existing learning-to-lower-bound connections, and obtained results for additional learning models (e.g., learning from statistical queries). In particular,  proved that 𝖤⊈𝒞not-subset-of-nor-equals𝖤𝒞\\mathsf{E}\\nsubseteq\\mathcal{C} if there are exact learners for 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} running in deterministic time o​(2n)𝑜superscript2𝑛o(2^{n}), showing that “non-trivial” deterministic learners yield lower bounds. In a different direction, Volkovich  showed how to extract lower bounds in polynomial-time classes from randomized learners running in polynomial time. More precisely,  shows that 𝖡𝖯𝖯/1𝖡𝖯𝖯1\\mathsf{BPP}/1 (𝖡𝖯𝖯𝖡𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{BPP} with 111 bit of non-uniform advice per input length) is not contained in 𝒞​[nk]𝒞delimited-[]superscript𝑛𝑘\\mathcal{C}[n^{k}] for all k≥1𝑘1k\\geq 1 if 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} can be PAC learned with membership queries under the uniform distribution by randomized learners running in polynomial time. In another work, Volkovich  explores connections between algebraic complexity lower bounds and learning algorithms. While extracting circuit lower bounds from non-trivial deterministic learners can be done using elementary techniques , extending the result to randomized learners required advanced tools from complexity theory. This was first achieved by Oliveira and Santhanam , who proved that if for every k≥1𝑘1k\\geq 1 the class 𝒞​[nk]𝒞delimited-[]superscript𝑛𝑘\\mathcal{C}[n^{k}] can be PAC learned under the uniform distribution with membership queries by a randomized algorithm running in time 2n/nω​(1)superscript2𝑛superscript𝑛𝜔12^{n}/n^{\\omega(1)}, then for every k≥1𝑘1k\\geq 1 we have 𝖡𝖯𝖤⊈𝒞​[nk]not-subset-of-nor-equals𝖡𝖯𝖤𝒞delimited-[]superscript𝑛𝑘\\mathsf{BPE}\\nsubseteq\\mathcal{C}[n^{k}]. Their result admits an extension to faster learners with a weaker advantage γ𝛾\\gamma, with parameters similar to our 1. A simpler proof that non-trivial randomized learning yields lower bounds, with a stronger consequence, was obtained by Oliveira and Santhanam [ref]45 under the additional assumption that the learner has “pseudo-deterministic” behaviour. We refer to their work for details. In a more recent work, Oliveira [ref]43 explored the learning-to-lower-bound connection in an indirect way to show that a natural problem in time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity cannot be solved in probabilistic polynomial time. This can be achieved by proving a lower bound under the assumption that learning algorithms do not exist (since otherwise a useful lower bound immediately follows from an existing learning-to-lower-bound connection). Chen, Rothblum, Tell, and Yogev  established a “fine-grained” learning-to-lower-bound connection with respect to circuit size in the setting of randomized learners. More precisely, they show that learning general Boolean circuits of size n⋅𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒​(log⁡n)⋅𝑛𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝑛n\\cdot\\mathsf{poly}(\\log n) in randomized time 2n/𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒​(log⁡n)superscript2𝑛𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝑛2^{n/\\mathsf{poly}(\\log n)} yields a function in 𝖡𝖯𝖤𝖡𝖯𝖤\\mathsf{BPE} that cannot be computed by circuits of size n⋅𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒​(log⁡n)⋅𝑛𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝑛n\\cdot\\mathsf{poly}(\\log n). While their running time assumption is much more stringent than 2n/nω​(1)superscript2𝑛superscript𝑛𝜔12^{n}/n^{\\omega(1)}, it is not necessary to learn circuits of large polynomial size to get interesting lower bound consequences. In a parallel line of work, Williams  employed completely different methods to establish that “non-trivial” (running in time 2n/nω​(1)superscript2𝑛superscript𝑛𝜔12^{n}/n^{\\omega(1)}) deterministic satisfiability algorithms for a class 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} of polynomial-size circuits imply that 𝖭𝖤⊈𝒞not-subset-of-nor-equals𝖭𝖤𝒞\\mathsf{NE}\\nsubseteq\\mathcal{C}, where 𝖭𝖤𝖭𝖤\\mathsf{NE} is an exponential time analogue of 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}. The satisfiability-to-lower-bound connection and its extensions have been highly successful in establishing new circuit lower bounds for a variety of circuit classes (see e.g.,     and references therein).\nChen, Oliveira, and Santhanam  combined learning and satisfiability algorithms to strengthen lower bound consequences from learning algorithms in the particular case of 𝒞=𝖠𝖢𝖢0𝒞superscript𝖠𝖢𝖢0\\mathcal{C}=\\mathsf{ACC}^{0} (constant-depth polynomial-size circuits extended with modular gates). In contrast to all these works, here we establish the first general connection between the design of quantum (learning) algorithms for an arbitrary class 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} of polynomial-size circuits and the existence of lower bounds against 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}. In Section 2, we fix notation and review a few basic definitions and results, as well as formalize our quantum learning model and the useful concept of inherently random circuits. In Section 3, we establish that non-trivial quantum learners imply lower bounds (1), under the assumption that a conditional 𝖯𝖱𝖦𝖯𝖱𝖦\\mathsf{PRG} against quantum computations exists. Section 4 develops the tools that are needed to establish the correctness of our 𝖯𝖱𝖦𝖯𝖱𝖦\\mathsf{PRG} construction. Finally, Section 5 defines and analyses a 𝖯𝖱𝖦𝖯𝖱𝖦\\mathsf{PRG} with the desired properties, which completes the proof of 1.
