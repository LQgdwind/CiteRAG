      "content": "Paper Title: One-Vote Veto: Semi-Supervised Learning for Low-Shot Glaucoma Diagnosis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGlaucoma is a prevalent and debilitating disease that can lead to progressive and irreversible vision loss through optic nerve damage . The global incidence of glaucoma was estimated at 64.3 million in 2013, and due to aging populations, this number is expected to rise to 111.8 million by 2040 . Improvement in the management of glaucoma would have a major human and socio-economic impact . Early identification and intervention would significantly reduce the economic burden of late-stage disease . In addition, visual impairment in glaucoma patients has been associated with decreased physical activity and mental health   and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents  [ref]8. With the recent advances in machine learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained via supervised learning, have shown promise in diagnosing glaucoma from fundus images (photographs of the back of eyes) . However, this requires large amounts of empirical data for supervised training 0. In this study, we use 66,715 fundus photographs from the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) 1 2 3, which is a 22-site multi-center, longitudinal (phase 1 and 2, 1994-2008) randomized clinical trial of 1,636 subjects (3,272 eyes). The primary goal of the OHTS was to determine if topical ocular hypotensive medications could delay or prevent the onset of glaucoma in eyes with high intraocular pressure 1. Conversion to glaucoma was decided by a masked endpoint committee of three glaucoma specialists using fundus photographs and visual fields. Owing to its well-characterized ground-truth labels, the OHTS dataset provides us a basis to explore an effective way of training CNNs to diagnose glaucoma with low-shot learning when only a small quantity of labeled data is available, and/or semi-supervised learning when raw data is abundant, but labeling resources are scarce, costly, require strong expertise, or are just unavailable. However, as shown in Fig. 1, conventional semi-supervised learning approaches typically require a reliable pre-trained CNN (using a small sample) as prior knowledge, which is often challenging due to the over-fitting problem. Moreover, there is also a strong motivation to design a feasible semi-supervised learning strategy capable of determining confident predictions and generating pseudo labels for unlabeled data. We focus specifically on fundus images and glaucoma diagnosis in this article because we have sufficient data to accurately characterize the effectiveness of our methods. The same techniques could also be applied to tasks where there is limited data, such as rare diseases or where limited labels are available (e.g., asthma and diabetes prediction from fundus images). Therefore, this article aims to answer the following questions: Can a CNN be developed to accurately diagnose glaucoma, compared to the expert graders of the OHTS? Will the model be generalizable to other datasets? Is it necessary to train CNNs with thousands of labeled fundus images to diagnose glaucoma, or can diagnosis be achieved using only one image per patient (approximately 1.1K fundus images in the OHTS training set)? Can the performance of a CNN trained using a small sample be improved further by fine-tuning it with additional unlabeled training data? To answer these questions, we first evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art (SoTA) glaucoma diagnosis algorithms, including six supervised learning algorithms 4 5 6 7 8 , one low-shot learning algorithm 9, and two semi-supervised learning algorithms 0 1, on the OHTS dataset. Their generalizabilities are further validated on three additional clinical datasets of fundus images: (a) ACRIMA (Spain) 2, (b) Large-Scale Attention-Based Glaucoma (LAG, China) , and (c) the UCSD-based Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma Study and African Descent and Glaucoma Evaluation Study (DIGS/ADAGES, US) 3. Furthermore, we propose a novel extension to the conventional Siamese network, referred to as the Multi-Task Siamese Network (MTSN), as depicted in Fig. 2. By minimizing a novel Combined Weighted Cross-Entropy (CWCE) Loss, the MTSN can simultaneously perform two tasks: measuring the similarity of a given pair of images (primary task) and classifying them as healthy or glaucoma (secondary task). With a small training set of approximately 1.1K fundus images, we explore the feasibility of training an MTSN for glaucoma diagnosis. Although the MTSN may not provide complementary information, it effectively performs a type of “data augmentation” by generating C​(N,2)𝐶𝑁2C(N,2) pairs of fundus images for training instead of using N𝑁N independent fundus images. The visual features learned from these two tasks prove to be more informative for glaucoma diagnosis when the training set is small. Our experimental results demonstrate that the MTSN greatly reduces over-fitting and achieves an accuracy on a small training set comparable to a large training set, which contains approximately 53K fundus images. Moreover, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning strategy, referred to as One-Vote Veto (OVV) Self-Training, which generates reliable pseudo labels for the unlabeled training data and incorporates them into the labeled training data to fine-tune the MTSN for improved performance and generalizability. Our extensive experiments show that the MTSN fine-tuned with OVV self-training achieves similar performance to the corresponding backbone CNN trained via supervised learning on the OHTS dataset, and achieves higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) scores on the additional fundus image datasets. The fine-tuned MTSN also outperforms SoTA semi-supervised glaucoma diagnosis approaches 0 1, and in some cases, even outperforms SoTA supervised approaches. Additionally, we compare our proposed OVV self-training approach with four SoTA general-purpose semi-supervised learning methods, including FreeMatch 4, SoftMatch 5, FixMatch 6, and FlexMatch 7, all of which utilize vision Transformer 8 as their backbone network. The results demonstrate that our proposed OVV self-training approach outperforms these methods on the OHTS dataset and demonstrates better generalizability on three additional fundus image test sets. We also conduct two additional few-shot biomedical image classification experiments (chest X-ray image classification 9 0 and lung histopathological image classification 1) to further validate the effectiveness of the MTSN on other types of image data. The promising results indicate that our proposed algorithms have the potential to solve a variety of biomedical image classification problems.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: of late-stage disease .
