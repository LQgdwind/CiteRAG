      "content": "Paper Title: Evolving Neural Architecture Using One Shot Model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConvolutional neural networks have been instrumental in solving various\nproblems in the field of computer vision. However, the network designs were mainly done by humans\n(like AlexNet 2, ResNet , DenseNet\n, VGGNet ) on the basis of their intuition and\nunderstanding of the specific problem. This has led to the growing interest in the automated\nsearch of neural architecture called Neural Architecture Search (NAS)\n[ref]20. NAS has shown some promising\nresults in the field of computer vision but most of these methods demand a considerable amount of\ncomputational power. For example, obtaining the state-of-the-art architecture for CIFAR-10\nrequired 3150 GPU days of evolution  and 1800 GPU days of reinforcement\nlearning (RL) . This can be mainly attributed to the evaluation of the\narchitectures during the search process of the different NAS methods because most NAS methods\ntrain each architecture individually for certain number of epochs in order to evaluate its\nperformance on the validation data. Recent works\n[ref]20 have reduced the search time by weight\nsharing among the architectures. DARTS 7 further improves upon the scalability\nby relaxing the search space to a continuous space in order to use gradient descent for optimizing\nthe architecture. But these gradient based methods are highly dependent on the search space and\nthey tend to overfit to operations in the search space that lead to faster gradient\ndescent . In this work, we propose a method called EvNAS (Evolving Neural\nArchitecture using One Shot Model) which involves evolving a convolutional neural\nnetwork architecture with weight sharing among the architectures in the population for the\nimage classification task. The work is inspired in part by the representation used for\nthe architectures of the network in DARTS 7 and a random\nsearch 3 using the same representation as DARTS which\nachieved a competitive result on the CIFAR-10 dataset. By replacing the idea of using\na random search with a genetic algorithm on the representation used in DARTS, we\nintroduce a directional component to the otherwise directionless random search\n3 through the use of crossover with tournament selection and elitism. The\nstochastic nature of the algorithm also ensures that the algorithm does not get stuck in the\nlocal minima. The objective of the paper is to show how to apply a simple genetic algorithm to the\nneural architecture search problem while reducing the high search time associated with\nthe evolution based search algorithm. Our experiments (Section  4) involves\nneural architecture search on a proxy dataset i.e. CIFAR-10 which achieves the\ntest error of 2.47% with 3.63M parameters on this dataset while using minimal computational\nresources (4.4 GPUs day on a single GPU). The discovered architecture is then transferred to\nCIFAR-100 and ImageNet achieving top-1 error of 16.37% and top-5 error of 7.4%\nrespectively. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We introduce a novel method of applying a simple genetic algorithm to the NAS problem with\nreduced computational requirements. We propose a decoding technique for each architecture in the population which diverts a\nmajority of the gradient information to the current architecture during the training phase and is\nused to calculate the fitness of the architecture from the one shot model during the fitness\nevaluation phase. We propose a crossover operation that is guided by the predicted fitness of the partially\ntrained architectures of the previous generation and does not require keeping track of the\nancestors of the parent architectures. We achieved remarkable efficiency in the architecture search achieving\ntest error of 2.47% with 3.63M parameters on CIFAR-10 and showed that the architecture\nlearned by EvNAS is transferable to CIFAR-100 and ImageNet.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: on the basis of their intuition and\nunderstanding of the specific problem.
