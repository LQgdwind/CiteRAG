      "content": "Paper Title: FLTrust: Byzantine-robust Federated Learning via Trust Bootstrapping\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPoisoning attacks generally refer to attacking the training phase of machine learning.\nOne category of poisoning attacks called data poisoning attacks aim to pollute the training data to corrupt the learnt model. Data poisoning attacks have been demonstrated to many machine learning systems such as spam detection¬† [ref]35, SVM¬†, recommender systems¬†   , neural networks¬†     , and graph-based methods¬†  , as well as distributed privacy-preserving data analytics¬† .\nFL is also vulnerable to data poisoning attacks¬†, i.e., malicious clients can corrupt the global model via modifying, adding, and/or deleting examples in their local training datasets. For instance, a data poisoning attack known as label flipping attack changes the labels of the training examples on malicious clients while keeping their features unchanged. Moreover, unlike centralized learning, FL is further vulnerable to local model poisoning attacks¬†  [ref]15 [ref]43, in which the malicious clients poison the local models or their updates sent to the server. Depending on the attacker‚Äôs goal, local model poisoning attacks can be categorized into untargeted attacks [ref]15 and targeted attacks   [ref]43. Untargeted attacks aim to corrupt the global model such that it makes incorrect predictions for a large number of testing examples indiscriminately, i.e., the testing error rate is high. Targeted attacks aim to corrupt the global model such that it predicts attacker-chosen target labels for attacker-chosen target testing examples while the predicted labels for other non-target testing examples are unaffected. Note that any data poisoning attack can be transformed to a local model poisoning attack, i.e., we can compute the local model update on a malicious client‚Äôs poisoned local training dataset and treat it as the poisoned local model update. Moreover, recent studies  [ref]15 showed that local model poisoning attacks are more effective than data poisoning attacks against FL. Therefore, we focus on local model poisoning attacks in this work. Next, we discuss two state-of-the-art untargeted attacks (i.e., Krum attack and Trim attack) [ref]15 and one targeted attack (i.e., Scaling attack) . Krum attack and Trim attack [ref]15:¬† Fang et al.¬†[ref]15 proposed a general framework for local model poisoning attacks, which can be applied to optimize the attacks for any given aggregation rule.\nAssuming the global model update without attack is ùíàùíà\\bm{g},\nFang et al.¬†[ref]15 formulate the attack as an optimization problem that aims to change the global model update the most along the opposite direction of ùíàùíà\\bm{g}, by optimizing the poisoned local model updates sent from the malicious clients to the server.\nDifferent aggregation rules lead to different instantiations of the optimization problem.\nFang et al. applied the framework to optimize local model poisoning attacks for Krum (called Krum attack) as well as Trim-mean and Median (called Trim attack). Scaling attack :¬† This attack aims to corrupt the global model to predict attacker-chosen target labels for attacker-chosen target testing examples, while the predicted labels for other testing examples are unaffected (i.e., the normal testing error rate remains the same). For instance, the attacker-chosen target testing examples can be normal testing examples embedded with a predefined backdoor trigger (e.g., a logo, a specific feature pattern). To achieve the goal, the Scaling attack adds trigger-embedded training examples with the attacker-chosen target label to the local training data of malicious clients. The local model updates on malicious clients are then computed based on the local training datasets augmented with the trigger-embedded examples. However, the poisoned local model updates may have limited impact on the global model update because it is aggregated over all clients‚Äô local model updates. For instance, in FedAvg, the effect of the attack will be diluted after the averaging¬†. Therefore, the attack further scales the poisoned local model updates on malicious clients by a factor that is much larger than 1. The scaled poisoned local model updates are then sent to the server.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: called data poisoning attacks aim to pollute the training data to corrupt the learnt model.
