      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Group Robustness in the presence of Partial Group Labels\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDistributionally robust optimization    has been studied as a way to train robust ML models across multiple groups and environments. Group Robust Optimization. Methods in the literature handling robustness to extraneous attributes can be broadly categorized into two classes. The first class, domain generalization methods  3 6, aim at learning representations invariant to a predefined set of extraneous attributes or groups. The goal is to be able to generalize to unseen domains or environments in the testing phase. On the other hand, the second class of methods, called as the group robust methods 8 [ref]35 1, seek to improve the worst-off or the minority group performance within the set of pre-defined groups. Here the training and testing phases share the same set of groups. Our approach falls into the second class of methods. Robust Optimization with Demographics. When group information is known at train time, Group DRO [ref]15 9 [ref]35 5 5 or Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM)  could be employed to improve the performance over multiple groups. Specifically, Group DRO proceeds by minimizing the loss of the group with the largest loss, while IRM enforces a shared predictor across multiple environments to be optimal in the form of a Lagrangian multiplier. Robust Optimization without Demographics. As the group information may not be always available reliably, several studies have been focusing on developing methods that remove or reduce their dependence on the group information.  has developed a method based on the distributionally robust optimization that minimizes the loss of the samples with losses larger than a certain threshold.  has proposed to reweight the samples in an adversarial way so that the high loss sample could receive more weight over the course of training. Moreover, 1 has proposed a simple yet effective two-stage approach called Just-Train-Twice (JTT) that trains a model by upweighting samples with high losses from the initial ERM model. Two-stage methods.\n\nRecent methods, like JTT 1 and EIIL , which do not require group or demographic information adopt a two-stage pipeline for training. While the two-stage methods may attain better accuracy measures, they bear a few drawbacks in relation to a single-stage method. Firstly, two-stage methods introduce additional set of hyper-parameters that need to be tuned. For example, it’s crucial for JTT to tune for the number of epochs to convergence in its first (identification) stage. Similarly, EIIL requires a pre-trained reference model and optimization of the EI objective that introduce several hyper-parameters. While certain parameters like learning rate, weight-decay and architecture could be shared across stages, such choice still need to be empirically verified on every new dataset. Secondly, in a two-stage model, a failed first stage leads to an unsuccessful second stage as errors from the first stage are propagated to the later stages. A first stage model could fail due to the model overfitting to the training data in the JTT method 1, and similarly in EIIL inaccurate group inference may block second-stage invariant learning besides raising ethical issues on pseudo-label misuse. In summary, efforts to reduce a two-stage model to a single-stage method are beneficial and, as we shall see shortly, our proposal benefits from being a single stage method.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: or groups.
