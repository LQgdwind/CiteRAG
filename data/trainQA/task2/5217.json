      "content": "Paper Title: Objects as Spatio-Temporal 2.5D points\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTable 1 shows the object tracking performance on KITTI tracking dataset. In the validation set, we marginally outperform [ref]47, one of the recent state-of-the-art methods for object tracking. The results in Table 1 highlight that using depth along with 2D bounding boxes improves tracking accuracy, resulting in considerably lower ID switches between objects, and also improved MOTA & MOTP in comparison to the baseline. While both [ref]47 and the proposed method have similar computational times with DLA34, using MobileNetV2 [ref]31 the computational times are significantly lower, and our method additionally regresses a high-resolution dense depth map of the whole scene. The depth prediction accuracy of the method is tabulated in Table 2. The first 4 columns represents the error (where the lower the better) and the last 3 columns show the accuracy (vice versa). Our models have been trained on KITTI tracking dataset (with 50:50 train/val split) out of which 4009 images are used for training and reported evaluation on the other half (since our network requires both LiDAR point clouds and 2D object annotations for training) as opposed to other methods which are trained on full KITTI dataset with over 85K images and tested on Eigen split [ref]5\nHowever, for fair comparison, we have also reported our experiments using AdaBins  trained and evaluated on the same kitti tracking split that we use for our experiments. Although our performance falls short of the state-of-the-art, it has to be noted that these SOTA architectures are not suitable for real time applications, as our networks runs at between 32 - 54 fps, one of the SOTA (AdaBins) runs at 2.5 fps, far slower than our networks, on the same (2080Ti) hardware. Table 3 (rows 1-2) shows that the depth prediction accuracy drops for object regions (object bounding boxes, irrespective of object classes) in comparison to depth prediction estimated for the whole image (background + object bounding boxes). This is contrary to the prevalent assumption that objects (like pedestrians and vehicles) are easier to learn and model than backgrounds and thus object scale (or predicted distances) are expected to be just as if not more accurate than background. But our experiments point to contrary, proving that learning object scale is more challenging to model than most literature accounts for. The scale ambiguity is also evident from our experiments on depth prediction accuracy wrt. varying distances (rows 3-5 of Table 3 where the squared errors are high for objects that are far away (≥\\geq 20m), the absolute errors are low, implying that proportionately more pixels are inaccurate for nearby objects whereas the errors appear amplified when objects are far away. Figure 5 shows the interactions between ego vehicle and an actor. The ego vehicle’s position is available as GPS coordinates, where the actor’s position is computed relative to the ego using the regressed depth and object detection. One of the weaknesses that we identified with our proposed method is its lack of ability to recover when encountered occlusion. Our method relies on the depth prediction to obtain the z of the object, which often corresponds to depth value at the object’s 2D center. While we have an outlier removal algorithm that handles minor occlusions, the 3D estimates of objects can be affected if the object of interest is severely occluded. Such instances have been observed to have a fluctuating pattern in the z-estimates.\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: Table 1 shows the object tracking performance on KITTI tracking dataset.
