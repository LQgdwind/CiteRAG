Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Self-supervised Graph Learning for Occasional Group Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe select the following baselines: MoSAN  adopts sub-attention mechanism to model the group-item interactions. AGREE  adopts attention mechanism for jointly modelling user-item and group-item interactions. SIGR  further incorporates social relationships of groups and users to model the attentive group and user representations. GroupIM [ref]27 further regularizes group and user representations by maximizing the mutual information between the group and its members. GAME 4 performs graph convolution only based on the first-order neighbors from the group-group, group-user and group-item graphs for group recommendation. GCMC [ref]40 uses the classical GCN  model to perform graph convolution, and learn the node embeddings. NGCF  adds second-order interactions upon the neural passing based GNN model . LightGCN  devises the light graph convolution upon NGCF. HHGR  designs coarse- and fine-grained node dropout strategies upon the hypergraph for group recommendation. We discard potential baselines like Popularity , COM , and CrowdRec , since previous works    [ref]27 4 have validated the superiority over the compared ones.\nFor the GNN model GCMC, NGCF and LightGCN, we extend it to address group recommendation as proposed in Section 2.2; Besides, notation GNN* denotes the corresponding proposed model SGGSGG{\\rm SGG}. We further evaluate two variants of SGGSGG{\\rm SGG}, named Basic-GNN and Meta-GNN, which are equipped with basic embedding reconstruction with GNNs (Section 3.1) and embedding enhancer (Section 3.2), respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: for jointly modelling user-item and group-item interactions.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
