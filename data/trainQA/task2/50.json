      "content": "Paper Title: Bayesian Neural Architecture Search using A Training-Free Performance Metric\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the advent of deep learning, deep neural networks (DNNs) have gained popularity, and they have been applied to a wide variety of problems  [ref]29.\nWhen it comes to sequence modeling and prediction, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have proved to be the most suitable ones [ref]29.\nEssentially, RNNs are feedforward networks with feedback connections. This feature allows them to capture long-term dependencies among the input variables.\nDespite their good performance, they are very sensitive to their hyperparameter configuration and hard to train   5 7. Finding an appropriate hyperparameter setting has always been a difficult task. The conventional approach to tackle this problem is to do a trial/error exploration based on expert knowledge. In other words, a human expert defines an architecture, sets up a training method (usually a gradient descent-based algorithm), and performs the training of the network until some criterion is met. Lately, automatic methods based on optimization algorithms, e.g., grid search, evolutionary algorithms or Bayesian optimization (BO), have been proposed to replace the human expert. However, due to the immense size and complexity of the search space, and the high computational cost of training a DNN, hyperparameter optimization still poses an open problem  5. Different approaches have been proposed for improving the performance of hyperparameter optimization, ranging from evolutionary approaches (a.k.a. neuroevolution) 5, to techniques to speed up the evaluation of a DNN [ref]7 .\nAmong these approaches, the Mean Absolute Error Random Sampling (MRS) [ref]7 poses a promising “low-cost, training-free, rule of thumb” alternative to evaluate the performance of an RNN, which drastically reduces the evaluation time. In this study, we propose to tackle the architecture optimization problem with a hybrid approach. Specifically, we combine BO  3 for optimizing the architecture, MRS [ref]7 for evaluating the performance of candidate architectures, and ADAM  (a gradient descent-based algorithm) truncated through time for training the final architecture on a given problem. We benchmark our proposal on three problems (the sine wave, the filling level of 217 recycling bins in a metropolitan area, and the load demand forecast of an electricity company in Slovakia) and compare our results against the state-of-the-art. Therefore, the main contributions of this study are: We define a method to optimize the architecture of an RNN based on BO and MRS that significantly reduces the time without compromising the performance (error), We introduce multiple alternatives to cope with the variable-length solution problem. Specifically, we study three encoding schemes and two penalty approaches (i.e., the infeasible representation and the constraint handling), and We propose a strategy to improve the performance of the surrogate model of BO for variable-length solutions based on the augmentation of the initial set of solutions, i.e., the warm-start. The remainder of this article is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly reviews some of the most relevant works related to our proposal. Section 3 introduces our proposed approach. Section 4 presents the experimental study, and Section 5 provides conclusions and future work.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: With the advent of deep learning, deep neural networks (DNNs) have gained popularity, and they have been applied to a wide variety of problems  [ref]29.\nWhen it comes to sequence modeling and prediction, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have proved to be the most suitable ones [ref]29.\nEssentially, RNNs are feedforward networks with feedback\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
