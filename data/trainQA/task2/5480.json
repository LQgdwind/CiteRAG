If none, delete this.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe field of scene text recognition has gained a lot of progress throughout the years and many solutions model the task with a sequence prediction objective function.\nGraves et. al.  have approached this task by handcrafted geometrical features such as mean gray value and gradient of pixel intensity. Su and Lu  achieve the feature extraction using HOG features obtained from the cropped images of the words. Most later works have turned towards deep learning to replace hand-crafted feature extraction.\nShi et. al.  were the first to utilize a combination of CNNs and RNNs to tackle the task of text recognition (CRNN). The CNN was used to extract a set of feature maps from the input image. The feature map was then broken down into one-pixel-wide columns of pixels and the it‚Äãhsuperscriptùëñùë°‚Ñéi^{t}h pixel columns of each feature map were concatenated to form the feature vectors which were then fed into an RNN. They further improved on this by swapping the RNN for a Bidirectional LSTM which showed better performance. This setup proved to be highly compact and efficient due to the removal of fully connected layers.\nShi et. al.  use a CTC layer [ref]17 to define the conditional probability of the sequence of labels. However, the computationally suboptimal nature of the CTC loss makes the model training highly volatile and time-consuming. To address this issue, Xie et. al. [ref]18 introduced the Aggregation Cross-Entropy loss which was highly efficient.\nIn [ref]19, Baek et. al. introduce a four-stage STR framework that most STR models fit into. Of these, the first stage is defined to be the irregular/curved text image to regular text image transformation. In the case of irregular text, the transformation stage is a significant necessity to ease the processing for subsequent stages. However, in this paper, we will build on tasks where the model receives regular text as input.\nThe task of transformation is handled by different models using various methods. Shi et. al.  address the case of oriented text detection using the SegLink model which detects individual characters, their orientations, and the links between characters of the same word. BoundaryE2E  detects the boundary points around the text and uses them to warp the image to horizontal text. A similar mechanism is used by Qiao et. al. , where the text boundaries and corners are detected using semantic segmentation, prior to the boundary point detection. Liu et. al.  designed ABCNet to predict Bezier curves that would fit the text on the image. This was followed by the BezierAlign module which aligned the text as required.\nZhang et. al.  achieve both chromatic and geometric rectification using the SPIN network. As noted in , this network can work in complement with other transformation models or with a standalone recognition model such as the one proposed in this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: the RNN for a Bidirectional LSTM which showed better performance. This setup proved to be highly compact and efficient due to the removal of fully connected layers.\nShi et. al.  use a CTC layer [ref]17 to define the conditional probability of the sequence of labels. However, the computationally suboptimal nature of the CTC loss makes the model training highly volatile and time-consuming.
