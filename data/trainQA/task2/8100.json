      "content": "Paper Title: Hypercontractivity on HDX II: Symmetrization and 𝑞-Norms\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur work fits into a long line of boolean analysis (and in particular hypercontractive inequalities) beyond the cube (see e.g. [ref]9  [ref]30            among many others). Our results are most closely related to the line of work on product spaces and high dimensional expanders    . In particular, we rely heavily on generalizing ideas of Gur, Lifshitz, and Liu , who introduced the approximate Efron-Stein Decomposition for γ𝛾\\gamma-products, and proved a similar hypercontractive inequality roughly of the form As discussed in the previous section, Equation 2 is restrictive in two senses. First, due to the ∥f∥∞subscriptdelimited-∥∥𝑓\\left\\lVert f\\right\\rVert_{\\infty} scaling in the error term, the bound is only meaningful when max|S|≤i,xS⁡{∥f|xS∥22}≥2O​(d)​γ​∥f∥∞2subscript𝑆𝑖subscript𝑥𝑆superscriptsubscriptdelimited-∥∥evaluated-at𝑓subscript𝑥𝑆22superscript2𝑂𝑑𝛾superscriptsubscriptdelimited-∥∥𝑓2\\max_{|S|\\leq i,x_{S}}\\{\\left\\lVert f|_{x_{S}}\\right\\rVert_{2}^{2}\\}\\geq 2^{O(d)}\\gamma\\left\\lVert f\\right\\rVert_{\\infty}^{2}. This means that on any fixed complex, the bound is not meaningful for all ranges of global functions (in particular the error term dominates for strongly global functions). By leveraging connections with (4,γ)4𝛾(4,\\gamma)-products, Theorem 1.2 removes this limitation. Second, the leading iO​(i)superscript𝑖𝑂𝑖i^{O(i)}-dependence in Equation 2 does not scale appropriately with the eigenvalues of corresponding noise operators. This scaling is often critical in application, where the dependence must cancel the corresponding eigenvalues of relevant operators. Similar improvements for the Grassmann and Bilinear Scheme  [ref]27 were used in recent breakthrough progress in PCP theory . On two-sided local-spectral expanders, Bafna, Hopkins, Kaufman, and Lovett  prove a version of Equation 2 with the correct 2O​(i)superscript2𝑂𝑖2^{O(i)} scaling on the main term, but similarly suffering from dependence in ∥f∥∞subscriptdelimited-∥∥𝑓\\left\\lVert f\\right\\rVert_{\\infty} in the error term. Because two-sided HDX can be embed into a partite one-sided HDX with a corresponding Fourier decomposition, our result also improves the state of the art for the two-sided case. Finally, it is worth highlighting that due to its use of symmetrization (and more generally the methods of ), the proof of Theorem 1.2 is substantially simpler than prior proofs of hypercontractivity for HDX  . The proof of hypercontractivity on other extended spaces such as the Grassmann   [ref]27 or Lie groups , despite recent simplifications to the former, still remains prohibitively complicated to extend to related objects such as higher rank tensors. Our result is the first to extend the simple symmetrization technique beyond products—could such a method also simplify and extend modern ‘group-based’ hypercontractive inequalities?\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: Our work fits into a long line of boolean analysis (and in particular hypercontractive inequalities) beyond the cube (see e.g. [ref]9  [ref]30            among many others).
