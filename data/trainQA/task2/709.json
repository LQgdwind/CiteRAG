      "content": "Paper Title: A parallel structured divide-and-conquer algorithm for symmetric tridiagonal eigenvalue problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMatrix-matrix multiplication is a very important computational kernel of\nmany scientific applications.\nIn this subsection, we briefly introduce some parallel matrix multiplication\nalgorithms, which compute C=A√óBùê∂ùê¥ùêµC=A\\times B. Cannon algorithm¬† was the first efficient\nalgorithm for parallel matrix multiplication providing\ntheoretically optimal communication cost.\nHowever it requires the process grid to be square, which\nlimits its practical usage.\nFox algorithm proposed in¬† has\nthe same problem.\nThe PUMMA algorithm¬† is a generalized\nFox algorithm, and it works for a general P√óQùëÉùëÑP\\times Q processor grid.\nPUMMA was designed for ScaLAPACK and used the BCDD form. The current version of ScaLAPACK implements SUMMA¬†, which was proposed\nin the mid-1990s and designed for a general processor grid.\nIt also uses the block-cyclic data distribution form.\nIt implements the outer product form of matrix multiplication, and\nallows to pipeline them.\nPUMMA implements the inner product form, and requires the largest possible matrices\nfor computations and communications.\nSome more efficient matrix multiplication algorithms have been proposed recently,\nlike 2.5D algorithm¬†, CARMA¬†,\nCTF¬†[ref]34,\nand COSMA¬†, and many others.\nSince they are not quite related to this current work,\nwe do not attempt to give a complete literature review. PUMMA is more appropriate for the rank-structured matrices than SUMMA, since\nthe large off-diagonal blocks can be compressed by low-rank approximations.\nSo are Cannon and Fox algorithms.\nIt is not obvious for SUMMA to exploit the rank-structured property of the\ninput matrices. In this paper, we propose a parallel structured matrix multiplication algorithm,\nwhich is called PSMMA for short.\nWe assume at least one of the two matrices is a structured matrix.\nBy ‚Äôstructured matrices‚Äô we mean those matrices which can be expressed using O‚Äã(n)ùëÇùëõO(n) parameters where\nnùëõn is the dimension of matrix, e.g. Cauchy-like, Toeplitz, Hankel, and Vandermonde matrices¬†.\nPSMMA can be based on the BCDD structure like PUMMA and ScaLAPACK,\nand it can also be based on the BDD structure like Cannon or Fox algorithms.\nAs shown later, the second approach is more efficient to exploit the off-diagonal low-rank structure.\nIts drawback is that it requires to redistribute the matrix from the BCDD form to BDD form, since\nthe matrices are initially stored in BCDD form in ScaLAPACK routines.\nThe PSMMA in BCDD form fits well with ScaLAPACK routines and\ndoes not need any data redistribution. By exploiting the special structure of matrix, PSMMA can reduce\nboth the computation and communication costs.\nTo the best of the authors‚Äô knowledge, this work is the first one\nproposing a reduction of the communication cost\nof matrix multiplication algorithms by exploiting the structures of matrices.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: and requires the largest possible matrices\nfor computations and communications.\nSome more efficient matrix multiplication algorithms have been proposed recently,\nlike 2.5D algorithm¬†, CARMA¬†,\nCTF¬†[ref]34,\nand COSMA¬†, and many others.\nSince they are not quite related to this current work,\nwe do not attempt to give a complete literature review.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
