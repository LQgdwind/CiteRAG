      "content": "Paper Title: Perceptual Loss for Robust Unsupervised Homography Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur implementation achieves much lower MACE on S-COCO than originally reported by DeTone et al.  and Nguyen et al.[ref]27: 1.961.961.96 and 2.072.072.07 against 9.209.209.20 and 12.9112.9112.91, respectively. This is because we employ a modern CNN architecture – ResNet34 [ref]14 instead of originally used VGG-like structure . Having the same backbone, Zeng’s et al.3 model is only about 13%percent1313\\% better than DeTone’s et al. model – instead of 564%percent564564\\% improvement reported in their paper. As shown in the Figure 1, our architecture gives the best performance compared to all other unsupervised methods. Specifically, using our biHomE loss with the same HEN as Zhang et al.4 demonstrates the beneficial effect of disentangling the homography estimation learning from feature representation learning. Moreover, our biHomE loss achieves comparable (Zeng et al.3) or better (DeTone et al.) homography estimation performance than supervised methods on S-COCO. Homography estimation on PDS-COCO presents a bigger challenge, because of additional photometric distortions on the images. Supervised approaches perform much worse in terms of MACE and neither Nguyen’s [ref]27 nor Zhang’s 4 methods can converge. Our biHomE loss is the only method trained in an unsupervised manner that can converge on PDS-COCO. Similar to S-COCO, our biHomE loss achieves comparable or better performance compared to supervised methods.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: Our implementation achieves much lower MACE on S-COCO than originally reported by DeTone et al.  and Nguyen et al.[ref]27: 1.961.961.96 and 2.072.072.07 against 9.209.209.20 and 12.9112.9112.91, respectively.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
