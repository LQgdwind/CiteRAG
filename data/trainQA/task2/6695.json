      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-Source Domain Adaptation through Dataset Dictionary Learning in Wasserstein Space\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are mainly two methodologies in DA. The first, shallow DA, leverages pre-existing feature extractors and performs adaptation either by re-weighting or transforming source domain data to resemble target domain data. The second, deep DA, uses source and target domain data during the training of a Deep Neural Net (DNN), so that learned features are independent of distributional shift. There are at least 3 classes of shallow DA methods: (i) importance re-weighting strategies , which give importance to source samples similar to the target domain, (ii) projection-based methods [ref]11, which seek a sub-space where distributions share common characteristics, and (iii) OT-based methods [ref]1, which use OT for matching, or calculating distances between distributions. For deep DA, methods penalize encoder parameters that map source and target distributions to different locations in the latent space. As a consequence, deep DA is more complex than shallow DA, since encoder parameters are free. Examples of deep DA methods include [ref]12, who uses an adversarial loss, and  , who use OT as a loss function between distributions of latent representations. For MSDA, some works generalize previous single-source baselines. For instance,  proposes a moment-matching strategy across the different domains.  proposes weighting source domains linearly, then applying the Joint Distribution Optimal Transport (JDOT) strategy of . This approach combines notions of importance weighting and OT-based DA.   generalize the approach of [ref]1, by first calculating a Wasserstein barycenter of the different source domains, then transporting the barycenter to the target domain. In parallel, DiL is a representation learning technique, that was previously used in DA by . However, classic DiL lacks a probabilistic interpretation. In this context, OT offers a probabilistic foreground for DiL, when data is represented through histograms. This is done by either using the Sinkhorn divergence  as the objective function , or by aggregating atoms in a Wasserstein space . Nonetheless, in the context of DA it is computationally intractable to bin the feature space, which is commonly high-dimensional. This issue hinders the applicability of previous DiL approaches for DA. In contrast, we propose a new OT-inspired DiL framework for point clouds, which makes it suitable for MSDA.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: There are at least 3 classes of shallow DA methods: (i) importance re-weighting strategies , which give importance to source samples similar to the target domain, (ii) projection-based methods [ref]11, which seek a sub-space where distributions share common characteristics, and (iii) OT-based methods [ref]1, which use OT for matching, or calculating distances between distributions.
