This technology then quickly adapted to the application for scene understanding or perception in intelligent vehicle [ref]53 [ref]55. Recently, semantic segmentation has offered an essential role in the perception area of the intelligent vehicle because of the complete information it offers. It can also support the development of local mapping in the intelligent vehicle by detecting static features such as lane boundaries, road markings, traffic signs, and moving objects such as vehicles. These targets can be recognized with a relatively high IOU (Intersection over Union). IOU is a commonly used measure for determining how accurate a proposed image segmentation is when compared to a ground-truth segmentation. The idea is to assign semantic labels to each pixel, and with the development of deep learning, neural networks can achieve a very good performance in semantic segmentation tasks.  proposed the fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) for the first time, which realized the end-to-end image segmentation. *Note: All of these evaluations are done using KITTISemantic  datasets. There are three types of architecture in the backbone framework of the image segmentation network, dilation network, encoder-decoder network, and multi-branch network as shown in Fig. 5. Dilation network omits the downsampling operations and keep the upsampling operation which maintains the feature representation in high-resolution   . Encoder-decoder network provides the recovery of the high-resolution feature representation in the decoder part after the compression process in the encoder part   . These architectures are designed specifically to provide the best semantic segmentation solution with no regard for computational cost and inference speed. When the researcher tries to apply these networks in real-life applications, these become a problem. Therefore, more and more people have started to modify this architecture to simplify the calculation process to accelerate the computational time. Starting from restricting the input data [ref]65) and pruning the channels in the early stage of the calculation to directly improve the inference speed   ). DFANet  recycles the features to simplify and improve the feature representation process. Although these methods can satisfy the real-time requirement for image segmentation tasks, the reduction in size and channels create a large deterioration in the accuracy. Recently, researchers have adopted a new approach by using two/multi-branch architecture. ICNet [ref]65 was the first to propose a multi-branch architecture with three branches of different depths to process various resolution inputs to achieve real-time semantic segmentation. Fast-SCNN  follows suit with two branch of architecture philosophy. It learns to down-sample the input and processes it afterward. BiSeNet   proposed Bilateral Segmentation Network where it has two branches, a detailed branch, and a semantic branch as shown in Fig. 5. Detail branches are designed to capture spatial details with wide channels and shallow layers. On the other hand, the semantic branch has smaller channels with deeper layers to capture the semantic context.\n is the first to propose a deep high-resolution representation into real-time semantic segmentation rich in context information. It consists of residual and bottleneck blocks that provide a speed-to-accuracy trade-off when the depth and width are scaled.  created a bridge between PID controllers designed for controllers to the image segmentation task, which inspired the additional branch. They can achieve state-of-the-art results in real-time semantic segmentation tasks by utilizing boundary prediction to ensure precise annotation around the semantic context.\nReaders who are interested in the most recent survey about deep learning algorithms in this subject can refer to .\n\nReference markers found: [53]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]53: networks (CNN) as a significant breakthrough in machine learning in general .
