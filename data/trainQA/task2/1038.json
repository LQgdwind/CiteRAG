      "content": "Paper Title: MESA: Boost Ensemble Imbalanced Learning with MEta-SAmpler\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSetup Details.\nIn order to verify the effectiveness of Mesa in practical applications, we extend the experiments to real-world imbalanced classification tasks from the UCI repository¬†[ref]10 and KDD CUP 2004.\nTo ensure a thorough assessment, these datasets vary widely in their properties, with the imbalance ratio (IR) ranging from 9.1:1 to 111:1, dataset sizes ranging from 531 to 145,751, and number of features ranging from 6 to 617\n(Please see Table¬†7 in Section¬†B for detailed information).\nFor each dataset, we keep-out the 20% validation set and report the result of 4-fold stratified cross-validation (i.e., 60%/20%/20% training/validation/test split).\nThe performance is evaluated using the area under the precision-recall curve (AUCPRC)333All results are averaged over 10 independent runs., which is an unbiased and more comprehensive metric for class-imbalanced tasks compared to other metrics such as F-score, ROC, and accuracy¬†. Comparison with Resampling Imbalanced Learning (IL) Methods.\nWe first compare Mesa with resampling techniques, which have been widely used in practice for preprocessing imbalanced data¬†.\nWe select 12 representative methods from 4 major branches of resampling-based IL, i.e, under/over/cleaning-sampling and over-sampling with cleaning-sampling post-process.\nWe test all methods on the challenging highly-imbalanced (IR=111) Protein Homo. task to check their efficiency and effectiveness.\nFive different classifiers, i.e., K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes (GNB), decision tree (DT), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), and gradient boosting machine (GBM), were used to collaborate with different resampling approaches.\nWe also record the number of samples used for model training and the time used to perform resampling. Table¬†2 details the experiment results.\nWe show that by learning an adaptive resampling strategy, Mesa outperforms other traditional data resampling methods by a large margin while only using a small number of training instances.\nIn such a highly imbalanced dataset, the minority class is poorly represented and lacks a clear structure.\nThus over-sampling methods that rely on relations between minority objects (like Smote) may deteriorate the classification performance, even though they generate and use a huge number of synthetic samples for training.\nOn the other hand, under-sampling methods drop most of the samples according to their rules and results in significant information loss and poor performance.\nCleaning-sampling methods aim to remove noise from the dataset, but the resampling time is considerably high and the improvement is trivial. Comparison with Ensemble Imbalanced Learning (EIL) Methods.\nWe further compare Mesa with 7 representative EIL methods on four real-world imbalanced classification tasks.\nThe baselines include 4 under-sampling based EIL methods, i.e., RusBoost¬†[ref]39, UnderBagging¬†, SPE¬†, Cascade¬†, and 3 over-sampling-based EIL methods, i.e., SmoteBoost¬†, SmoteBagging¬† and RamoBoost¬†.\nWe use the decision tree as the base learner for all EIL methods following the settings of most of the previous works¬†. We report the AUCPRC score of various USB-EIL methods with different ensemble sizes (kùëòk=5, 10, 20) in Table¬†3.\nThe results show that Mesa achieves competitive performance on various real-world tasks.\nFor the baseline methods, we can observe that RusBoost and UnderBagging suffer from information loss as random under-sampling may discard samples with important information, and such effect is more apparent on highly imbalanced task.\nIn comparison, the improved sampling strategies of SPE and Cascade enable them to achieve relatively better performance but still underperform Mesa.\nMoreover, as Mesa provides an adaptive resampler that makes the ensemble training converge faster and better, its advantage is particularly evident when using small ensemble in the highly-imbalanced task.\nOn the Mammography dataset (IR=42), compared with the second-best score, Mesa achieved 24.70%/12.00%/5.22% performance gain when kùëòk=5/10/20, respectively. We further compare Mesa with 3 OSB-EIL methods.\nAs summarized in Table¬†1, OSB-EIL methods typically use much more (1-2√ó\\timesIR times) data to train each base learner than their under-sampling-based competitors, including Mesa.\nThus it is unfair to directly compare Mesa with over-sampling-based baselines with the same ensemble size.\nTherefore, we plot the performance curve with regard to the number of instances used in ensemble training, as shown in Fig.¬†4. It can be observed that our method Mesa consistently outperforms over-sampling-based methods, especially on highly imbalanced/high-dimensional tasks (e.g., ISOLET with 617 features, Mammo. with IR=42).\nMesa also shows high sample efficiency and faster convergence speed. Compared with the baselines, it only requires a few training instances to converge to a strong ensemble classifier.\nMesa also has a more stable training process.\nThe OSB-EIL methods perform resampling by analyzing and reinforcing the structure of minority class data.\nWhen the dataset is small or highly-imbalanced, the minority class is usually under-represented and lacks a clear structure.\nThe performance of these OSB-EIL methods thus becomes unstable under such circumstances. Cross-task Transferability of the Meta-sampler.\n\nOne important feature of Mesa is its cross-task transferability.\nAs the meta-sampler is trained on task-agnostic meta-data, it is not task-bounded and is directly applicable to new tasks.\nThis provides Mesa with better scalability as one can directly use a pre-trained meta-sampler in new tasks thus greatly reduce the meta-training cost.\nTo validate this, we use Mammography and Protein Homo. as two larger and highly-imbalanced meta-test tasks, then consider five meta-training tasks including the original task (baseline), two sub-tasks with 50%/10% of the original training set, and two small tasks Optical Digits and Spectrometer. Table¬†4 reports the detailed results.\nWe can observe that the transferred meta-samplers generalize well on meta-test tasks.\nScaling down the number of meta-training instances has a minor effect on the obtained meta-sampler, especially when the original task has a sufficient number of training samples (e.g., for Protein Homo., reducing the meta-training set to 10% subset only results in -0.10%/-0.34% ŒîŒî\\Delta when kùëòk=10/20).\nMoreover, the meta-sampler that trained on a small task also demonstrates noticeably satisfactory performance (superior to other baselines) on new, larger, and even heterogeneous tasks, which validates the generality of the proposed Mesa framework.\nPlease refer to Section¬†A for a comprehensive cross/sub-task transferability test and other additional experimental results.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: Setup Details.\nIn order to verify the effectiveness of Mesa in practical applications, we extend the experiments to real-world imbalanced classification tasks from the UCI repository¬†[ref]10 and KDD CUP 2004.\nTo ensure a thorough assessment, these datasets vary widely in their properties, with the imbalance ratio (IR) ranging from 9.1:1 to 111:1, dataset sizes ranging from 531 to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
