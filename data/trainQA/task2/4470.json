We first validate our implementations on synthetic datasets and on softmax predictions from unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) source models. We further showcase the usefulness across the two real-world tasks One-Shot learning and UDA road segmentation, in which our method is used as a plug-in on top of output predictions from a black-box deep learning model. We also highlight the effect of each component of the proposed framework along ablation studies. Compared methods. We compare several state-of-the-art clustering methods. Specifically, comparative experiments include KL k-means   and HSC , two methods that are specifically designed to deal with probability simplex vectors. We additionally compare in this study generic clustering methods k-means, GMM , k-medians , k-medoids , k-modes [ref]21. Both k-means and KL k-means use mean centroids, but respectively euclidean and Kullback-Leibler distorsions. k-medians, extensively studied in , uses median centroids and the Manhattan distance. k-medoids uses the euclidean distance and it estimates its medoid centroids with the standard PAM algorithm . k-modes [ref]21 uses euclidean distance as well, and its mode centroids are estimated using the Meanshift algorithm  with the window size 0.050.050.05. k-Dirs. We also implemented a simplex clustering strategy consisting of estimating multivariate densities per cluster with Dirichlet density function. We use the iterative parameters estimation previously proposed in . This algorithm, referred to as k-Dirs, represents a baseline on the artificial datasets composed of Dirichlet distributions.

Our clustering algorithm uses the density function fs‚ÄãB‚Äãe‚Äãt‚Äãa‚Äãssubscriptùëìùë†ùêµùëíùë°ùëéùë†f_{sBetas} and the method of moments (MoM) detailed in Sec. 4.3.1 for parameters estimation. We empirically consolidate this choice in the ablation study section 5.3. k-Betas corresponds to the un-scaled variant of k-sBetas when we set Œ¥=0ùõø0\\delta=0. Details and hyper-parameters. Across all experiments, we set the scaling hyper-parameter Œ¥ùõø\\delta used in k-sBetas to the same value 0.150.150.15. We set œÑ‚àí=1superscriptùúè1\\tau^{-}=1 and œÑ+=165superscriptùúè165\\tau^{+}=165 for parameters constraints. The maximum number of clustering iterations is set to 252525 for all compared clustering algorithms. Finally, for each method, we use the proposed vertices parameters initialization, and leverage the Hungarian algorithm to obtain optimal hard-label assignments. We provide comparisons and justifications for our design choices in the ablation studies in Sec. 5.3. Methods reproducibility.

We use the standard Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) on each dataset to evaluate the clustering task, and the classification Accuracy (Acc) or Intersection over Union (IoU) respectively on balanced and imbalanced datasets to evaluate prediction scores for the class assignment task.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: , two methods that are specifically designed to deal with probability simplex vectors.
