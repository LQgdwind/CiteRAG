      "content": "Paper Title: A Bayesian Federated Learning Framework with Online Laplace Approximation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we first introduce some mathematical foundations to provide strong theoretical support for our model aggregation and local training strategies. Based on Bayesian theory,   introduce a practical Laplace approximation method to approximate the posterior probability using a Gaussian distribution θ∼𝒩​(θ∗,H¯−1)similar-to𝜃𝒩superscript𝜃superscript¯𝐻1\\theta\\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left(\\theta^{*},\\bar{H}^{-1}\\right).\nGenerally, the expectation is set to the optimal parameter θ∗superscript𝜃\\theta^{*}, and the positive semi-definite (PSD) diagonal precision is set to the inverse of the average Hessian matrix.\nSpecifically, if (x,y)𝑥𝑦(x,y) is a sample pair with input x𝑥x and target y𝑦y, the average Hessian matrix can be calculated by H¯=−1|𝒟|​∑(x,y)∈𝒟Hln⁡p​(y∣x,θ)¯𝐻1𝒟subscript𝑥𝑦𝒟subscript𝐻𝑝conditional𝑦𝑥𝜃\\bar{H}=-\\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{D}|}\\sum_{(x,y)\\in\\mathcal{D}}H_{\\ln p(y\\mid x,\\theta)}, where\nHln⁡p​(y∣x,θ)subscript𝐻𝑝conditional𝑦𝑥𝜃H_{\\ln p(y\\mid x,\\theta)} is the Hessian of the log posterior ln⁡p​(y∣x,θ)𝑝conditional𝑦𝑥𝜃\\ln p(y\\mid x,\\theta) for each sample pair (x,y)∈𝒟𝑥𝑦𝒟(x,y)\\in\\mathcal{D}.\nHowever, both the time and space complexities of directly computing H¯¯𝐻\\bar{H} are O​(d2)𝑂superscript𝑑2O(d^{2}), where d=|θ|𝑑𝜃d=|\\theta| is the number of parameters, making the above approximation difficult to implement. In order to reduce the computational overhead, some methods   use a generalized Gauss-Newton (GGN) matrix GG\\mathrm{G} calculated by the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in O​(d)𝑂𝑑O(d) to approximate H¯¯𝐻\\bar{H}.\nThe matrix G𝐺G is defined as G=1|𝒟|​∑(x,y)∈𝒟Jf⊤​HL​Jf𝐺1𝒟subscript𝑥𝑦𝒟superscriptsubscript𝐽𝑓topsubscript𝐻𝐿subscript𝐽𝑓G=\\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{D}|}\\sum_{(x,y)\\in\\mathcal{D}}J_{f}^{\\top}H_{{L}}J_{f}, where HLsubscript𝐻𝐿H_{{L}} is the Hessian of the loss L​(y,z)𝐿𝑦𝑧{L}(y,z) evaluated on the output z=f​(x,θ)𝑧𝑓𝑥𝜃z=f(x,\\theta), and Jfsubscript𝐽𝑓J_{f} is the Jacobian of f​(x,θ)𝑓𝑥𝜃f(x,\\theta) w.r.t. the parameters θ𝜃\\theta.\nIn  , a quadratic form of the Fisher information matrix F=𝔼p​(y∣x,θ)​[∇log⁡p​(y∣x,θ)​∇log⁡p​(y∣x,θ)⊤]𝐹subscript𝔼𝑝conditional𝑦𝑥𝜃delimited-[]∇𝑝conditional𝑦𝑥𝜃∇𝑝superscriptconditional𝑦𝑥𝜃topF=\\mathbb{E}_{p(y\\mid x,\\theta)}\\left[\\nabla\\log p(y\\mid x,\\theta)\\nabla\\log p(y\\mid x,\\theta)^{\\top}\\right]\nis provided.\nThus, the negative expected Hessian of the log likelihood is equal to the Fisher information matrix −𝔼p​(y∣x,θ)​[Hln⁡p​(y∣x,θ)]=Fsubscript𝔼𝑝conditional𝑦𝑥𝜃delimited-[]subscript𝐻𝑝conditional𝑦𝑥𝜃𝐹-\\mathbb{E}_{p(y\\mid x,\\theta)}\\left[H_{\\ln p(y\\mid x,\\theta)}\\right]=F, so the matrix F𝐹F can be used to approximate H¯¯𝐻\\bar{H}.\nSome works   show that the GGN and Fisher matrix are equivalent to each other for several common loss functions, such as the cross-entropy loss and squared loss. Additionally, the method in  selects an empirical Fisher information matrix calculated by F¯=1|𝒟|​∑(x,y)∈𝒟∇log⁡p​(y∣x,θ)​∇log⁡p​(y∣x,θ)⊤¯𝐹1𝒟subscript𝑥𝑦𝒟∇𝑝conditional𝑦𝑥𝜃∇𝑝superscriptconditional𝑦𝑥𝜃top\\bar{F}=\\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{D}|}\\sum_{(x,y)\\in\\mathcal{D}}\\nabla\\log p(y\\mid x,\\theta)\\nabla\\log p(y\\mid x,\\theta)^{\\top}, which is a crude and biased approximation of F𝐹F.\nAs mentioned in , F¯¯𝐹\\bar{F} is low-rank so its diagonal can be computed by d​i​a​g​(F¯)=1|𝒟|​∑(x,y)∈𝒟s​q​(∇log⁡p​(y∣x,θ))𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑔¯𝐹1𝒟subscript𝑥𝑦𝒟𝑠𝑞∇𝑝conditional𝑦𝑥𝜃diag(\\bar{F})=\\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{D}|}\\sum_{(x,y)\\in\\mathcal{D}}sq(\\nabla\\log p(y\\mid x,\\theta)), where s​q​(⋅)𝑠𝑞⋅sq(\\cdot) denotes the coordinate-wise square function.\nIf we assume F¯¯𝐹\\bar{F} is diagonal, both the time and space complexity of calculating d​i​a​g​(F¯)𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑔¯𝐹diag(\\bar{F}) are O​(d)𝑂𝑑O(d), making the Laplace approximation method easy to implement.\nIn 6   8, the inverse of the diagonal of the empirical Fisher information matrix and the Laplace approximation are combined to approximate the expectation and covariance of the posterior probability, which works well for their target tasks.\nMoreover, in 8, a derivation of ordinary differential equations for optimization is used to prove that the accumulation of gradient squares multiplied by the learning rate of the optimization steps is equivalent to the diagonal of the Hessian matrix. Besides, a multivariate normal mixture method  illustrates that, by using a ridge line manifold that contains all critical points, the topography or density of mixing multiple Gaussian distributions can be analyzed rigorously in lower dimensions.\nFurther, all critical points (modes, antimodes and saddlepoints) of N𝑁N-component multivariate normal densitiy are shown to be the points in an N−1𝑁1N-1 dimensional hypersurface {θ|θ=(∑n=1Nπn​Σn−1)−1​(∑n=1Nπn​Σn−1​μn),α∈[ref]0 ,∑n=1Nπn=1}conditional-set𝜃formulae-sequence𝜃superscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝑛1𝑁subscript𝜋𝑛superscriptsubscriptΣ𝑛11superscriptsubscript𝑛1𝑁subscript𝜋𝑛superscriptsubscriptΣ𝑛1subscript𝜇𝑛formulae-sequence𝛼01superscriptsubscript𝑛1𝑁subscript𝜋𝑛1\\{\\theta|\\theta=(\\sum_{n=1}^{N}\\pi_{n}\\Sigma_{n}^{-1})^{-1}(\\sum_{n=1}^{N}\\pi_{n}\\Sigma_{n}^{-1}\\mu_{n}),\\alpha\\in[ref]0 ,\\sum_{n=1}^{N}\\pi_{n}=1\\}, where μnsubscript𝜇𝑛\\mu_{n} and ΣnsubscriptΣ𝑛\\Sigma_{n} are the expectation and covariance of a multivariate Gaussian distribution.\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: points (modes, antimodes and saddlepoints) of N𝑁N-component multivariate normal densitiy are shown to be the points in an N−1𝑁1N-1 dimensional hypersurface {θ|θ=(∑n=1Nπn​Σn−1)−1​(∑n=1Nπn​Σn−1​μn),α∈[ref]0\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
