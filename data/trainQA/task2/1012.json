      "content": "Paper Title: Streaming enumeration on nested documents\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStreaming query evaluation¬†  is the task of processing queries over data streams in one pass and with a limited amount of resources. This approach is especially useful on the web, where servers share data, and they have to extract the relevant content as they receive it. For structuring the data, the de facto structure on the web are nested documents, like XML or JSON. For querying, servers use languages designed for these purposes, like XPath, XQuery, or JSON query languages.\nAs an illustrative example, suppose our data server (e.g. Web API) is continuously receiving XML documents of the form: <doc> <a> <b/> <c/> <b/> </a> <c> <b/> <b/> </c> </doc> ... and for each document it has to evaluate the query Q=//a/b\\pazocal{Q}=//a/b (i.e., to extract all bùëèb-tags that are surrounded by an aùëéa-tag). The streaming query evaluation problem consists on reading these documents and finding all bùëèb-tags without storing the entire document on memory, i.e., by making one pass over the data and spending constant time per tag. In our example, we need to retrieve the 3rd and 5th tag as soon as the last tag </doc> is received. One could consider here that the server has to read an infinite stream and perform the query evaluation continuously, where it must enumerate partial outputs as one of the XML documents ends. Researchers have studied the streaming query evaluation problem in the past, focusing on reducing the processing time or memory usage (see, e.g. ). Hence, they spent less effort on understanding the enumeration time of such a problem, regarding delay guarantees between outputs.\nConstant-delay enumeration is a new notion of efficiency for retrieving outputs¬† .\nGiven an instance of the problem, an algorithm with constant-delay enumeration performs a preprocessing phase over the instance to build some indices and then continues with an enumeration phase. It retrieves each output, one-by-one, taking a delay that is constant between any two consecutive outcomes. These algorithms provide a strong guarantee of efficiency since a user knows that, after the preprocessing phase, she will access the output as if the algorithm had already computed it. These techniques have attracted researchers‚Äô attention, finding sophisticated solutions to several query evaluation problems¬†     . In this work, we investigate the streaming query evaluation problem over nested documents by including enumeration guarantees, like constant-delay. We study the evaluation of queries given by Visibly Pushdown Transducers (VPT) over nested documents. These machines are the natural ‚Äúoutput extension‚Äù of visibly pushdown automata, and have the same expressive power as MSO over nested documents.\nIn particular, VPT can define queries like QQ\\pazocal{Q} above or any fragment of query languages for XML or JSON included in MSO.\nTherefore, VPT allow considering the streaming query evaluation from a more general perspective, without getting married to a specific language (e.g., XPath). We study the evaluation of over a nested document in a streaming fashion. Specifically, we want to find a streaming algorithm that reads the document sequentially and spends constant time per input symbol.\nFurthermore, whenever needed, the algorithm can enumerate all outputs with output-linear delay. The main contribution of the paper is an algorithm with such characteristics for the class of I/O-unambiguous VPT. We can extend this algorithm by determinization to all VPT (i.e., in data complexity).\nRegarding memory consumption, we bound the amount of memory used in terms of the nesting of the document and the output weight. We show that our algorithm is worst-case optimal in the sense that there are instances where the maximum amount of memory required by any streaming algorithm is at least one of these two measures. Our main result applies to the streaming evaluation of XML and JSON query languages.\nIn the appendix, we also show an application in the context of document spanners¬†. Related work. The problem of streaming query evaluation has been extensively studied in the last decades. Some work considered streaming verification, like schema validation¬† or type-checking¬†, where the output is true or false. Other proposals¬†  [ref]40 5  provided streaming algorithms for XPath or XQuery‚Äôs fragments; however, extending them for reaching constant-delay enumeration seems unlikely. Furthermore, most of these works¬† 4 3 assumed outputs of fixed size (i.e., tuples). People have also considered other aspects of streaming evaluation with outputs like earliest query answering¬†3 or bounded delay¬†2 (i.e., given the first visit of a node, find the earliest event that permits its selection). These aspects are orthogonal to the problem studied here.\nAnother line of research is¬† , which presents space lower bounds for evaluating fragments of XPath or XQuery over streams. These works do not consider restrictions on the delay to give outputs. Visibly pushdown automata¬† are a model usually used for streaming evaluation of boolean queries¬†. In¬† [ref]4, authors studied the evaluation of in a streaming fashion, but none of them saw enumeration problems. Other extensions¬†1 for streaming evaluation have been analyzed but restricted to fixed-size outputs, and constant-delay was not included. Constant-delay algorithms have been studied for several classes of query languages and structures¬†, as we already discussed. In¬† , researchers considered query evaluation over trees (i.e., a different representation for nested documents), but their algorithms are for offline evaluation and it is not clear how to extend this algorithm for the online setting.\nThis research is extended with updates in¬†, which can encode streams by inserting new data items to the left. However, their update-time is logarithmic, and our proposal can do it with constant time¬†(i.e., in data complexity).\nFurthermore, to the best of our knowledge it is unclear how to modify the work in¬† to get constant update-time in our scenario.\nStreaming evaluation with constant-delay enumeration was included in the context of dynamic query evaluation¬†8    or complex event processing¬†7 6. In both cases, the input cannot encode nested documents, and their results do not apply.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: has been extensively studied in the last decades.
