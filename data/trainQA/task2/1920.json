      "content": "Paper Title: Joint Detection and Localization of Stealth False Data Injection Attacks in Smart Grids using Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDue to their graph-based topology, graph structural data such as social networks, traffic networks, and electric grid networks cannot be modeled efficiently in the Euclidean space and require graph-type architectures .\nProcessing (filtering) an image having 30 pixels and a power grid having 30 buses are demonstrated in Fig.¬†1. Since nodes are ordered and have the same number of neighbors for image data, it can be processed in a 2D Euclidean space.\nFor example a sliding kernel can easily capture the spatial correlations of pixels in this Euclidean space.\nConversely, neighborhood relationships are unordered and vary from node to node in a graph signal .\nTherefore, graph signals need to be processed in non-Euclidean spaces determined by the topology of the graph.\nIn fact, as a highly complex graph structural data, smart grid signals require graph type architectures such as GSP or GNN to exploit the spatial correlations of the grid. GSP has emerged in the past few years to deal with the data in non-Euclidean spaces .\nA few researchers designed GFs to detect and localize the FDIA   using GSP.\nHowever, manual tailoring of the filters and detection thresholds substantially limits the applicability and efficiency of GSP.\nConversely, GNN, as a data-driven counterpart of the GSP, eliminates the custom design steps and provides an end-to-end design that exploits the spatial locality dictated by the historical data.\nSimilar to the classical signal processing, a graph signal is first converted into the spectral domain by GFT, then its Fourier coefficients are multiplied with those filter weights and finally the signal transformed back into the vertex domain by the inverse GFT .\nTo circumvent this spectral decomposition and domain transformation, polynomial GFs are proposed in [ref]20 in which localized filters are learned directly in the vertex domain .\nFor a polynomial GF, the output of each vertex vùë£v is only dependent on the KùêæK-hop neighborhood of vùë£v and its spectral response is a KùêæK-order polynomial.\nPolynomial GFs, which are also referred to as finite impulse response (FIR) GFs due to the local information sharing, perform a weighted moving average (MA) filtering [ref]22 [ref]23.\nHowever, FIR GFs may require a high degree polynomial to capture the global structure of the graph. In fact, interpolation and extrapolation performance of high degree polynomials are unsatisfactory [ref]22, and they are not ‚Äúflexible‚Äù enough to adapt to sudden changes in the spectral domain .\nTo overcome this limitation, infinite impulse response (IIR) type GFs performing Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) are proposed in [ref]22.\nContrary to FIR GFs, IIR GFs have rational type spectral responses.\nTherefore, IIR GFs can implement more complex responses with a low degree of polynomials both in the numerator and denominator since rational functions have better performance compared to polynomial ones in terms of interpolation and extrapolation capabilities [ref]22 . Detection and localization of FDIA can be a challenging task if an intruder has ‚Äòenough‚Äô information about the grid to create a stealth attack .\nS/he can hide an attack vector into an honest sample if the topology of the grid is ignored.\nMoreover, s/he can design an attack vector so that a malicious sample can be indistinguishable from an honest one if the spatial correlations of grid data are not well captured or the designed GFs do not satisfy the required spectral response.\nThus, we design an GNN based model by utilizing ARMA GFs to be able to fit sharp changes in the spectral domain of the grid.\nFilter weights are learned automatically during training by an end-to-end data-driven approach.\nTo compare our results with the existing data-driven techniques, we utilized several models to jointly detect and localize the FDIA.\nMoreover, for a fair comparison, the Bayesian hyper-parameter optimization technique is employed to all models for tuning the models‚Äô hyperparameters such as number of layers, neurons, etc.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: filter weights and finally the signal transformed back into the vertex domain by the inverse GFT .\nTo circumvent this spectral decomposition and domain transformation, polynomial GFs are proposed in [ref]20 in which localized filters are learned directly in the vertex domain .\nFor a polynomial GF, the output of each vertex vùë£v is only dependent on the KùêæK-hop neighborhood of vùë£v and its spectral\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
