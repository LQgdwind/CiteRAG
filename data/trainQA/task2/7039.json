      "content": "Paper Title: Decentralized Online Learning in Task Assignment Games for Mobile Crowdsensing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn contrast to either MU-centric MCS , or MCSP-centric MCS [ref]27, we consider the perspective of both, the selfish MUs and the selfish MCSP.\nContrary to  and [ref]27, we do not formulate a global objective function for the performance of the task assignment.\nInstead, we consider all MUs and the MCSP to be rational decision makers with their individual preferences and decision making capabilities.\nTherefore, we use game theory, specifically matching theory , to analyze the task assignment problem.\nThe main goal of matching theory is to obtain a stable matching, i.e., reaching a situation in which MUs and MCSP cannot simultaneously improve by changing the task assignment.\nThis corresponds to selfishly-deciding MUs and an MCSP that individually try to obtain their best task assignment.\nA stable matching outcome is apropos for the presented MCS problem because it allows the maximization of satisfaction for both the MUs and the MCSPs, with regard to their individual preferences. The matching game is a model for a two-sided market in which the MUs provide their sensing resources and the MCSP requires sensing resources.\nThese demands come in the form of indivisible sensing tasks, which the MUs execute in exchange of a payment .\nThe payment function Peffortsuperscript𝑃effortP^{\\mathrm{effort}} and the MUs’ cost function Ckeffortsuperscriptsubscript𝐶𝑘effortC_{k}^{\\mathrm{effort}} are given functions which depend on the task assignment .\nThe proposed, matching-based task assignment game 𝒢tsubscript𝒢𝑡\\mathcal{G}_{t} in time slot t𝑡t is formally described by a tuple 𝒢t=(𝒦,𝒜t,⪰kMU,⪰zMCSP)subscript𝒢𝑡𝒦subscript𝒜𝑡subscriptsuperscriptsucceeds-or-equalsMU𝑘subscriptsuperscriptsucceeds-or-equalsMCSP𝑧\\mathcal{G}_{t}=(\\mathcal{K},\\mathcal{A}_{t},\\succeq^{\\mathrm{MU}}_{k},\\succeq^{\\mathrm{MCSP}}_{z}) containing the set 𝒦𝒦\\mathcal{K} of MUs, the set 𝒜tsubscript𝒜𝑡\\mathcal{A}_{t} of available tasks, the MUs’ preference ordering ⪰kMUsubscriptsuperscriptsucceeds-or-equalsMU𝑘\\succeq^{\\mathrm{MU}}_{k}, and the MCSP’s preference ordering ⪰zMCSPsubscriptsuperscriptsucceeds-or-equalsMCSP𝑧\\succeq^{\\mathrm{MCSP}}_{z}. The MUs’ preference ordering ⪰kMUsubscriptsuperscriptsucceeds-or-equalsMU𝑘\\succeq^{\\mathrm{MU}}_{k} ranks task types according to the expected utility associated with the task type z𝑧z, i.e., In other words, MU​kMU𝑘\\text{MU}~{}k prefers task type z𝑧z over z′superscript𝑧′z^{\\prime} if the MU’s expected utility (6) of performing tasks of type z𝑧z is higher than of tasks of type z′superscript𝑧′z^{\\prime}.\nThe preference orderings ⪰kMUsubscriptsuperscriptsucceeds-or-equalsMU𝑘\\succeq^{\\mathrm{MU}}_{k} can only be correctly determined with the MU-side information ℐkMUsubscriptsuperscriptℐMU𝑘\\mathcal{I}^{\\mathrm{MU}}_{k}. The MCSP prefers MUs which yield the highest expected utility for each task type z𝑧z, i.e., The expression in (10) implies that when performing task type z𝑧z, the MSCP prefers MU​kMU𝑘\\text{MU}~{}k because it provides a higher utility compared to MU​lMU𝑙\\text{MU}~{}l.\nThis preference ranking can only be correctly determined with the MCSP-side information ℐMCSPsuperscriptℐMCSP\\mathcal{I}^{\\mathrm{MCSP}}. MU​kMU𝑘\\text{MU}~{}k signals its willingness to participate in any task of the type z𝑧z by sending a sensing offer Ok,tsubscript𝑂𝑘𝑡O_{k,t} as shown in Fig. 1b.\nBased on the received offers, the MSCP performs the assignment according to its preference ordering ⪰zMCSPsubscriptsuperscriptsucceeds-or-equalsMCSP𝑧\\succeq^{\\mathrm{MCSP}}_{z}{} as depicted in Fig.1c.\nWe denote the task assignment by the binary variable xk,n,tsubscript𝑥𝑘𝑛𝑡x_{{}_{k,n,t}}.\nWhen xk,n,t=1subscript𝑥𝑘𝑛𝑡1x_{{}_{k,n,t}}=1, MU​kMU𝑘\\text{MU}~{}k is assigned to task an,tsubscript𝑎𝑛𝑡{a}_{n,t}. Otherwise, xk,n,t=0subscript𝑥𝑘𝑛𝑡0x_{{}_{k,n,t}}=0.\nThe variables xk,n,tsubscript𝑥𝑘𝑛𝑡x_{{}_{k,n,t}} associated to all MUs and tasks in time slot t𝑡t are collected in the matrix 𝑿tsubscript𝑿𝑡\\bm{X}_{t}. A task assignment 𝐗tsubscript𝐗𝑡\\bm{X}_{t} is unstable if there are two MUs, MU​kMU𝑘\\text{MU}~{}k and MU​lMU𝑙\\text{MU}~{}l, and two tasks, an,tsubscript𝑎𝑛𝑡{a}_{n,t} and am,tsubscript𝑎𝑚𝑡{a}_{m,t}, such that:\n(i) xk,n,t=1subscript𝑥𝑘𝑛𝑡1x_{k,n,t}=1, i.e. MU​kMU𝑘\\text{MU}~{}k is assigned to task an,t∈𝒜z,tsubscript𝑎𝑛𝑡subscript𝒜𝑧𝑡{a}_{n,t}\\in\\mathcal{A}_{{z},t}.\n(ii) xl,m,t=1subscript𝑥𝑙𝑚𝑡1x_{l,m,t}=1, i.e. MU​lMU𝑙\\text{MU}~{}l is assigned to task am,t∈𝒜z′,tsubscript𝑎𝑚𝑡subscript𝒜superscript𝑧′𝑡{a}_{m,t}\\in\\mathcal{A}_{{z^{\\prime}},t}.\n(iii)\nz′≻kMUzsubscriptsuperscriptsucceedsMU𝑘superscript𝑧′𝑧z^{\\prime}\\succ^{\\mathrm{MU}}_{k}z and MU​k⪰z′MCSPMU​lsubscriptsuperscriptsucceeds-or-equalsMCSPsuperscript𝑧′MU𝑘MU𝑙\\text{MU}~{}k\\succeq^{\\mathrm{MCSP}}_{z^{\\prime}}\\text{MU}~{}l, i.e., MU​kMU𝑘\\text{MU}~{}k strictly prefers the task with type z′superscript𝑧′z^{\\prime} over its current matched task of type z𝑧z, and the MCSP would profit more if the task of type z′superscript𝑧′z^{\\prime} is performed by MU​kMU𝑘\\text{MU}~{}k instead of its current matched MU​lMU𝑙\\text{MU}~{}l. The pair (MU​k,z′)MU𝑘superscript𝑧′(\\text{MU}~{}k,z^{\\prime}) is called a blocking pair , because both the MU​kMU𝑘\\text{MU}~{}k and the MCSP are unsatisfied with the current assignment.\nThe existence of the blocking pair (MU​k,z′)MU𝑘superscript𝑧′(\\text{MU}~{}k,z^{\\prime}) causes the matching 𝑿tsubscript𝑿𝑡\\bm{X}_{t} to be unstable because MU​kMU𝑘\\text{MU}~{}k could switch to am,t∈𝒜z′,tsubscript𝑎𝑚𝑡subscript𝒜superscript𝑧′𝑡{a}_{m,t}\\in\\mathcal{A}_{{z^{\\prime}},t} and both, the MU​kMU𝑘\\text{MU}~{}k and the task am,tsubscript𝑎𝑚𝑡{a}_{m,t} would obtain a more efficient matching and therefore a higher expected utility. The assignment 𝑿tsubscript𝑿𝑡\\bm{X}_{t} is said to be stable if no blocking pairs exist .\nIn such cases, no MU or task could change the assignment and improve their expected utilities.\nIn MCS, this means that each MU is assigned to its most preferred task while the MCSP selects its most preferred MU for each task.\nNote that the stable matching may not be unique. There are, in fact, potentially multiple solutions.\nWe denote the set of stable solutions as 𝒳stablesuperscript𝒳stable\\mathcal{X}^{\\mathrm{stable}} and\ndefine akstablesubscriptsuperscript𝑎stable𝑘a^{\\mathrm{stable}}_{k} as a stable task for MU k𝑘k.
