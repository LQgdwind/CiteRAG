      "content": "Paper Title: Automated Speaker Independent Visual Speech Recognition: A Comprehensive Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn 2011, Damien et al.  proposed a novel approach to visual speech recognition which involves introducing a consonant-vowel detector and utilizing two classifiers: an HMM-based classifier for the recognition of the ”consonant part” of the phoneme and a classifier for the ”vowel part”. This approach offers several benefits, such as reducing the number of hidden states and the number of HMMs. The proposed method was tested on a limited set of words in the Modern Classic Arabic language, and a recognition rate of 81.7% was achieved. Additionally, the proposed model is speaker-independent and uses visemes as the basic units, making it applicable to any set of words with varying content or size. Shaik et al.  presented a novel lip-reading technique that can identify visemes using visual data only, without relying on the corresponding acoustic signals. The approach is based on analyzing the vertical components of the optical flow (OF), which are classified using support vector machines (SVM). To achieve automatic temporal segmentation of the utterances, the pair-wise pixel comparison method is used to evaluate the differences in intensity of corresponding pixels in two successive frames. The OF is decomposed into non-overlapping fixed scale blocks, and the statistical features of each block are computed for successive video frames of an utterance. The experiments were conducted on a database of 14 visemes taken from seven subjects, and the accuracy was tested using five and ten-fold cross-validation for binary and multiclass SVMs, respectively, to determine the impact of subject variations. With an accuracy of 85%, the results indicate that the proposed method is more robust to inter-subject variations compared to other systems in the literature, with high sensitivity and specificity for 12 out of 14 visemes. In 2012, P. Sujatha et al.  tested eight different feature extraction techniques for speech recognition, and the 16-point Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) method achieved the highest accuracy rate of 93.5 percent. The feature vectors obtained from the 16-point DCT method were given as input to the HMM, which was trained and tested on a dataset consisting of 10 speakers uttering 35 different words, and a test accuracy of 97.5% is obtained. In 2013, Salah W et al. [ref]130 proposed an Automatic Lip-reading Feature Extraction (ALiFE) prototype for recognizing the vowels uttered by multiple speakers. The ALiFE system has three phases. In the first phase, the lip contour is identified and tracked, and a set of Points of Interest (POIs) is identified. In the second phase, the lip features are extracted, and the extracted visual data is categorized to identify the vowel sound. One of the challenges in visual-only speech recognition is controlling aspects such as lighting, identity, motion, emotion, and expression, but some aspects, such as video resolution, can be controlled. The experiments were conducted on a customized dataset whose nature of corpus is vowels, and a training accuracy of 73.33% and a testing accuracy of 72.73% was obtained. In 2014, A study by Helen et al.  addressed the impact of resolution on speech recognition using a novel dataset called Rosetta Raven. The study employed the Active Appearance Models (AAMs) method for feature extraction, and the results suggested that resolution is not essential for automatic lip-reading. In their study, Helen et al. analyzed the impact of video resolution on automatic lip-reading using the Rosetta Raven dataset. The results of the study suggest that resolution may not be a crucial factor in speech recognition and that feature extraction methods such as AAMs can be employed to extract relevant features from low-resolution video data. Overall, these studies provide valuable insights into the challenges of visual-only speech recognition and propose effective solutions to address them. In 2016, Amit et al.  proposed several techniques for predicting words and phrases from videos without any audio. The first approach involved combining a specific number of images from a video sequence to create a single image, which was then used as input to a CNN architecture, VGG Net. The VGG Net is a CNN architecture that was introduced in 2014 by the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) at the University of Oxford [ref]133   . It is a widely used CNN architecture for image classification tasks due to its simplicity and high accuracy. The VGG Net consists of 16 convolutional layers followed by 3 fully connected layers. Each convolutional layer has a fixed 3x3 filter size with a stride of 1 and padding of 1, and the max-pooling layer with a 2x2 filter size with a stride of 2 is applied after every two convolutional layers. The VGG Net architecture is characterized by its depth and uniformity, meaning that all the convolutional layers have the same filter size, and the number of filters is doubled after every pooling layer. The VGG Net was pre-trained on faces and served as a set of weights. The second method was similar to the first, but it expanded and normalized the number of images per sequence using nearest-neighbor interpolation. In the third approach, a single image was fed into the VGGNet to extract features, which were then passed into the LSTM layers [ref]137. The proposed methodology achieved a training accuracy of 66.15% and a testing accuracy of 44.5% on the MIRACL-VC1 phrases corpus, thus making it one of the pioneering works experimented on the same. The combination of CNNs and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks has proven to be highly effective in this field, as depicted in Figure 9. Chung et al.  proposed a primary methodology that uses Watch, Listen, Attend, and Spell (WLAS) architecture to translate recordings of mouth action into words. They developed a mechanism that handles audio and video input separately and together. Their work emphasized a curriculum-driven approach to increase training and minimize the issue of excessive variance. They trained the Weighted-Average Least Squares (WALS) model on the LRS dataset, which contains more than 10,000 sentences. Additionally, the WLAS architecture has been employed to translate mouth action recordings into words, which serves as a promising approach for speech recognition. Assael et al.  proposed an end-to-end sentence-level VSR that converts sequences of picture frames of a speaker’s mouth to complete sentences using spatiotemporal convolutional neural networks (STCNNs)    tested on the GRID corpus dataset. Spatiotemporal Convolutional Neural Networks (STCNNs) are deep learning models used for analyzing and classifying spatiotemporal data, such as video data. These models are an extension of the popular CNNs, which have proven to be highly effective in image recognition tasks. The key difference between STCNNs and traditional CNNs is that STCNNs can capture both spatial and temporal information from the data. This is achieved by using 3D convolutional layers, which convolve the input data along three dimensions (width, height, and time). The 3D convolutional layers are typically followed by pooling layers, which reduce the spatial resolution of the data, and recurrent layers, such as LSTMs or Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) , which capture temporal dependencies between the frames in the video sequence. STCNNs have several advantages over traditional CNNs for video analysis tasks. Firstly, they can capture both spatial and temporal features simultaneously, allowing for more accurate and robust classification. Secondly, they can handle variable-length video sequences by using recurrent layers, which can process inputs of varying lengths. Finally, STCNNs can be trained end-to-end, meaning that the entire network can be optimized using backpropagation, which simplifies the training process. The core idea of an STCNN can be depicted in Fig. 10. A methodology is built to eliminate the requirement of dividing the visuals into words before predicting the phrase. Experimentations were conducted on the LRS-Sentences corpus, and a testing accuracy of 95.2% was achieved. This methodology was compared with hard-of-hearing people’s ability to perform the task of VSR and significantly improved accuracy. Numerous research studies have utilized Deep Complementary Bottleneck Features     from audio for speech recognition. However, the application of these features to video data is currently limited. To address this issue, Stavros et al.  proposed a study utilizing deep encoders to build DBNFs. These deep encoders were trained with a bottleneck layer to reduce the image’s dimensionality. Additionally, during training, DCT features were added to the bottleneck layer to make the bottleneck features complementary to the DCT features. The proposed method was evaluated on two well-known datasets, OuluVS and AVLetters, using an LSTM model, and the accuracy achieved was 81.8% for the letters corpus and 58.1% for the sentence corpus. In 2017, Philip et al.  presented a novel method for liveness evaluation based on VSR. Their approach involved a combined system consisting of DNN and HMM models for speech recognition. The XM2VTS dataset was utilized for training and testing the model and the dataset achieved a testing accuracy of 86.3%. To estimate liveness, the system used model VSR and calculated the Levenshtein Distance  between a randomly generated challenge phrase and the hypothesis utterances from the visual speech recognizer. Eric et al.  proposed a system that combines a camera with an ultrasound imaging system to monitor the subject’s lips and tongue movement. In this work, CNNs were employed to extract visual features from the original ultrasound and video images. The authors suggested a multimodal architecture that simultaneously processed two visual perceptions and developed various methods for using CNNs as a feature extractor combined with an HMM-GMM decoder. The proposed methodology was evaluated on a customized dataset, and a testing accuracy of 80.4% was achieved. AlexNet is a deep CNN that won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) in 2012, marking a breakthrough in computer vision research. The network architecture consists of five convolutional layers, followed by three fully connected layers, and uses the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function to avoid the vanishing gradient problem. AlexNet also incorporates techniques such as overlapping pooling, data augmentation, and dropout regularization to prevent overfitting  . The network was trained on over 1 million images from 1000 different classes and achieved a top-5 error rate of 15.3%, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. The success of AlexNet paved the way for further research and development in deep learning and its applications in computer vision. Similarly, Inception V3 is a CNN architecture that utilizes inception modules   . These modules use parallel convolutional layers of different sizes to capture features at different scales. Inception V3 also incorporates batch normalization, factorized 7x7 convolutions, and auxiliary classifiers to improve training and regularization. The network has a deep architecture with 48 layers, including stem layers, inception modules, and fully connected layers. In a study by P. Sindhura et al.  in 2018, AlexNet was thoroughly evaluated alongside Inception V3 for lip reading. Both models were trained using the MIRACL-VC1 dataset and were analyzed from both speaker-dependent and speaker-independent perspectives. The authors extracted each word’s lip region individually and combined them into a single image, which was used to train the algorithm. The experimentation was conducted on the MIRACL-VC1 words dataset, and an accuracy of 37.1% was illustrated. H. Gupta et al.  proposed a lip-reading model using CNN batch normalization for audio-less video data. The Haar Cascade algorithm is employed to extract the lip region from each individual frontal facial image in the video sequence and combine them into a single image. Haar Cascade is an object detection algorithm that is widely used in computer vision. It is based on the Haar wavelet technique and uses machine learning to detect objects in images or videos. The algorithm works by first extracting features from the input image using Haar-like features. These features are then used to train a classifier, such as the AdaBoost algorithm. The trained classifier is then used to detect objects in the input image. Haar Cascade has been successfully applied to face detection, pedestrian detection, and object recognition tasks. The algorithm is widely used in real-world applications and is known for its accuracy and speed. Furthermore, for extracting the visual features, a 12-layer CNN with two layers of batch normalization is used for training the model. The proposed model was trained using the MIRACL-VC1 dataset. The methodology depicted a high training accuracy of 96.5%, but, however, a low testing accuracy of 52.9%. In 2019, M. A. Abrar et al.  developed a CNN model for predicting words from videos without any acoustic features. The videos are categorized into frames and are reduced to equivalent lengths, and the ROI is cropped from the videos. A pre-trained VGGNet architecture is trained on the MIRACL-VC1 dataset. This methodology, too, achieved a high training accuracy (94.86%) and a low testing accuracy (60%), implying the concept of overfitting. To operate the framework in real-time, an application has been developed to support the hearing impaired in their day-to-day activities. D.Parekh et al.  proposed the use of convolutional auto encoders for extracting the feature vectors from the video frames, and these feature vectors are given as input to the LSTM model. Three separate standard datasets: BBC’s LRW, MIRACL-VC1, and the GRID dataset, are used to test the proposed approach. The model achieved an accuracy of 98% and 63.22% for speaker dependent and speaker independent on the MIRACL-VC1 dataset and an accuracy of 84.8% on the GRID dataset. CNN is used as a baseline model for extracting the features. Then the performance of the proposed model is compared with the baseline model. Y. Lu et al.  suggested three-step procedures for automatic lip-reading recognition. The first step is to extract the frames from the created custom dataset (Pronunciation of 0-9 digits by three men and three women in the English language). The feature vectors have been extracted from the frames using VGG Net. Then, to identify lip-reading, an attention-based LSTM-CNN fusion model was developed. With a training accuracy of 88.2% and a testing accuracy of 84.9%, the results obtained from the fusion attention-based model have been compared with the general RNN-CNN model, and it has shown that the proposed model has achieved more accuracy on the test data. In 2020, Cheng Cheng Guan et al.  proposed a modern architecture fuzzy CNN model for lip image segmentation. This model integrates the deep CNN subnet and the fuzzy learning module. The integration of deep CNNs and fuzzy learning modules has been proposed as a way to improve the accuracy and interpretability of deep learning models. CNNs have been shown to be highly effective at feature extraction and pattern recognition tasks in many fields, including computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. However, CNNs can be difficult to interpret, and their decisions may not always be transparent. On the other hand, fuzzy logic systems are a form of artificial intelligence that can handle imprecise or uncertain data and provide transparent, interpretable results. By integrating a fuzzy learning module with a deep CNN subnet, it is possible to combine the feature extraction capabilities of the CNN with the interpretability of fuzzy logic. The deep convolutional subnet is used for the extraction of multiscale visual features, and the fuzzy learning module is used to extract high-level semantic features while considering ambiguities and non-linearities. Additionally, a training strategy was employed to identify the ideal parameters for the CNN subnet and fuzzy module. A customized dataset with more than 48,000 images was used to evaluate the lip segmentation using this model and a testing accuracy of 98.4% was depicted. Navin et al.  proposed a deep learning model for VSR to perform word-level classification. ResNet architecture is used along with 3D convolution layers and Gated recurrent units (GRU). The entire video sequence is used as input for the architecture. On the BBC data set, the architecture obtained an accuracy of 90%, and on the custom video dataset, it obtained an accuracy of 88%. The major drawback of this study is that it doesn’t perform well for subjects with facial hair. In 2021, Santos et al.  proposed a study in which transfer learning was utilized to train the Inception v3 CNN model, which already had pre-trained weights from IMAGENET, with the GRID corpus. The resulting speech recognition outcomes were deemed satisfactory, with a precision of 0.61, recall of 0.53, and F1-score of 0.51. The lip-reading model demonstrated the ability to learn relevant features automatically, as evidenced by visualization, and achieved speaker-independent outcomes that were comparable to those achieved by human lip readers on the GRID corpus. The researchers identified limitations that are consistent with those encountered by humans, which could limit deep learning performance in real-world scenarios. Soundarya et al.  proposed a methodology that involves utilizing a combination of convolutional neural networks and Hidden Markov models, known as CNN-HMM, for lip reading. CNNs are able to identify important features within input images, making it easier to distinguish differences among the images. The HMM is then applied to handle the dynamics of the image sequence. To implement this method, the incoming video is first converted into a series of images, and then selected images are used for further analysis. The use of HMM provides a robust approach to speech recognition, resulting in a highly reliable lip reading model. Yang et al.  have proposed a novel DNN for improving lipreading performance in the absence of a speaker. The proposed network comprises two components, namely the Speaker Confusion Block (SC-Block) and the transformer-based VSR Network (TVSR-Net). The TVSR-Net is designed for recognizing speech and extracting lip characteristics, while the SC-Block is intended to achieve speaker normalization by reducing the impact of different talking styles and habits. The proposed system also incorporates a multi-task learning (MTL) system for network optimization. Experimental results on the GRID dataset demonstrate that the proposed network achieves excellent speaker-independent recognition performance even with limited training data. In 2021, Qun Zhang et al.  proposed a method for enhancing the performance of VSR in the speaker-independent scenario by using disentangled feature representation and adversarial learning. The proposed disentanglement component effectively separates identity-irrelevant and content-related features from the lip image sequence to improve the VSR’s accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully separate identification and content characteristics, and the refined content features have a high level of discrimination in speech content recognition and are independent of different speaking styles. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using word error rate on two different datasets, GRID and VSA, which shows significant improvement over the state-of-the-art methods. In 2022, Ma et al.  suggested a VSR method that achieves state-of-the-art performance by carefully developing a model and using larger datasets. They also stressed hyperparameter tweaking, which may improve present designs, and time-masking, which makes the network focus more on context. The authors used six datasets and found that larger datasets improve performance, consistent with existing findings. The authors conducted an ablation study and have a word error rate of 29.5±0.4 on LR2 and 35.8±0.5 on the LR3 datasets. The proposed VSR algorithm surpasses all others trained on publicly available English, Spanish, and Mandarin datasets. Xue et al.  suggested a cross-modal Transformer framework for sentence-level lipreading that can generalize to unseen speakers by calibrating visual changes using landmarks as motion trajectories. Cross-attention to exhibit cross-modal fusion may help the model align features. Extensive experimentation was conducted on the CMLR dataset and the sentence level accuracy achieved was 57%. The approach generalizes to unseen speakers, according to considerable experimental evidence. The recommended solution outperforms five cutting-edge algorithms for unseen and overlapping speakers, including those of different ethnicities. Nemani et al.  pointed out that the current state of Video-based Speech Recognition (VSR) systems faces various challenges, such as insufficient training data, lack of holistic feature representation, and lower accuracy rates. To overcome these limitations, a novel and scalable VSR system is proposed in this study. The system uses the user’s videotape to determine the spoken word, and a customized 3-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) architecture is proposed for feature extraction and mapping prediction probabilities. To validate the concept of person independence, a customized dataset is created similar to the MIRACL-VC1 dataset. The proposed system is robust to various lighting conditions across multiple devices and achieves a training accuracy of 80.2% and testing accuracy of 77.9% in predicting the spoken word by the user. Also, the authors imply the presence of an end-to-end solution for isolated word-level VSR by the introduction of an edge device prototype to predict the word spoken by the user. The research conducted by Kim et al.  in 2023 presents findings on the impact of prompt adjustment in speaker-adaptive VSR models. In contrast to previous studies, the authors utilized target speaker adaptation data instead of model parameters, taking advantage of advancements in NLP. They explored various prompt adjustment methods, including the addition, padding, and concatenation of CNN Transformer VSR models. However, the Transformer variation architecture limited quick tweaking methods. The research revealed that even though the pre-trained VSR model should be developed with a large speaker variation, a small amount of adaptation data, such as less than 5 minutes, could improve the model’s performance on unknown speakers with quick tuning. The authors also conducted a comparison of prompt performance and parameters for fine-tuning. The study’s findings indicate that prompt adjustment using target speaker adaptation data can significantly improve unseen speaker performance in VSR models. These results have implications for the development of speaker-adaptive VSR models and could inform future research in the field.\n\nReference markers found: [130]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]130: were given as input to the HMM, which was trained and tested on a dataset consisting of 10 speakers uttering 35 different words, and a test accuracy of 97.5% is obtained.
