      "content": "Paper Title: Relative Timing Information and Orthology in Evolutionary Scenarios\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe have developed a complete characterization of graph 333-partition\n𝒢𝒢\\mathscr{G} on a species-colored set of vertices that can be explained by an\nrelaxed scenario 𝒮𝒮\\mathscr{S} (Thm. 10). We showed,\nfurthermore, that whenever such an explaining relaxed scenario exists, one\ncan also find explanations from a much more restricted class of scenarios\nthat are fully witnessed and satisfy certain natural constraints for\n“speciation events” (Thm. 13). The\nexistence of such scenarios can be tested in polynomial time, and in the\npositive case, both relaxed and restricted scenarios explaining the input\n333-partition can be constructed, again in polynomial time. If only the\ninformation of G=∈𝒢subscript𝐺𝒢G_{{}_{=}}\\in\\mathscr{G} is available, it can be tested in\npolynomial-time as whether G=subscript𝐺G_{{}_{=}} is an EDT graph in the HGT-free case\n(cf. Thm. 14), while the problem becomes NP-hard for\ngeneral relaxed scenarios (cf. Thm. 16). In contrast,\nPDT graphs can be recognized in polynomial-time\n(cf. Thm. 17). These approaches extend earlier work on\nLDT graphs, which serve as the basis for indirect methods for the inference\nof HGT events . If only the information of G<∈𝒢subscript𝐺𝒢G_{{}_{<}}\\in\\mathscr{G} is available, it can be tested whether G<subscript𝐺G_{{}_{<}} is an LDT graph and,\nin the affirmative case, a relaxed scenario that explains G<subscript𝐺G_{{}_{<}} can be\nconstructed in polynomial-time . Relaxed scenarios also can be used to formalize Walter Fitch’s concept of\nxenologous gene pairs  . Given a relaxed scenario\n𝒮=(T,S,σ,μ,τT,τS)𝒮𝑇𝑆𝜎𝜇subscript𝜏𝑇subscript𝜏𝑆\\mathscr{S}=(T,S,\\sigma,\\mu,\\tau_{T},\\tau_{S}), we define the xenology relation\nR𝑅R by setting (x,y)∈R𝑥𝑦𝑅(x,y)\\in R precisely if x,y∈L​(T)𝑥𝑦𝐿𝑇x,y\\in L(T) and the unique path\nconnecting x𝑥x and y𝑦y in T𝑇T contains an HGT edge. The resulting graph\nϝ⁡(𝒮)≔(L​(T),R)≔italic-ϝ𝒮𝐿𝑇𝑅\\operatorname{\\digamma}(\\mathscr{S})\\coloneqq(L(T),R) is known as symmetrized Fitch\ngraph 2 [ref]31 . It is always a\nproperly colored multipartite graph. Thm. 5 in  shows\nthat for every properly colored multipartite graph there is a relaxed\nscenario 𝒮𝒮\\mathscr{S} such that G<​(𝒮)=ϝ⁡(𝒮)subscript𝐺𝒮italic-ϝ𝒮G_{{}_{<}}(\\mathscr{S})=\\operatorname{\\digamma}(\\mathscr{S}). On the other\nhand, by [50, Thm. 4], the LDT graph G<​(𝒮)subscript𝐺𝒮G_{{}_{<}}(\\mathscr{S}) is always\na subgraph of ϝ⁡(𝒮)italic-ϝ𝒮\\operatorname{\\digamma}(\\mathscr{S}) for every relaxed scenario 𝒮𝒮\\mathscr{S}. Thus,\nfor every 𝒮𝒮\\mathscr{S} and every x​y∈G<​(𝒮)𝑥𝑦subscript𝐺𝒮xy\\in G_{{}_{<}}(\\mathscr{S}), the two genes x𝑥x and y𝑦y\nare separated by at least on HGT-event. There are examples of relaxed\nscenarios 𝒮𝒮\\mathscr{S} for which G<​(𝒮)≠ϝ⁡(𝒮)subscript𝐺𝒮italic-ϝ𝒮G_{{}_{<}}(\\mathscr{S})\\neq\\operatorname{\\digamma}(\\mathscr{S})\n(cf. [50, Fig. 7]). Whether G<​(𝒮)⊊ϝ⁡(𝒮)subscript𝐺𝒮italic-ϝ𝒮G_{{}_{<}}(\\mathscr{S})\\subsetneq\\operatorname{\\digamma}(\\mathscr{S}) or G<​(𝒮)=ϝ⁡(𝒮)subscript𝐺𝒮italic-ϝ𝒮G_{{}_{<}}(\\mathscr{S})=\\operatorname{\\digamma}(\\mathscr{S}) heavily depends on the\nparticular scenario 𝒮𝒮\\mathscr{S}. Given 𝒢=(G<,G=,G>,σ)𝒢subscript𝐺subscript𝐺subscript𝐺𝜎\\mathscr{G}=(G_{{}_{<}},G_{{}_{=}},G_{{}_{>}},\\sigma), which\nmay be estimated empirically from sequence similarity data, an explaining\nscenario 𝒮𝒮\\mathscr{S} is not uniquely determined in general. This begs the\nquestion whether there is a relaxed scenario 𝒮𝒮\\mathscr{S} that explains\n𝒢𝒢\\mathscr{G} and satisfies G<=ϝ⁡(𝒮)subscript𝐺italic-ϝ𝒮G_{{}_{<}}=\\operatorname{\\digamma}(\\mathscr{S}). To see that this is not the\ncase, consider 𝒢≔𝒢​(𝒮2)≔𝒢𝒢subscript𝒮2\\mathscr{G}\\coloneqq\\mathscr{G}(\\mathscr{S}_{2}), where 𝒮2subscript𝒮2\\mathscr{S}_{2} is the\nscenario as in Fig. 4. In this case, G<subscript𝐺G_{{}_{<}} is not a\ncomplete multipartite graph and thus, G<⊊ϝ⁡(𝒮)subscript𝐺italic-ϝ𝒮G_{{}_{<}}\\subsetneq\\operatorname{\\digamma}(\\mathscr{S}) for\nevery relaxed scenario 𝒮𝒮\\mathscr{S} that explains G<subscript𝐺G_{{}_{<}}. Consequently, the\ninformation on HGT-events is not always provided entirely by the knowledge\nof G<subscript𝐺G_{{}_{<}} alone. The graphs G=subscript𝐺G_{{}_{=}} and G>subscript𝐺G_{{}_{>}} thus may add additional\ninformation for the inference of HGT. It will therefore be an interesting\ntopic for future work to understand how to employ 𝒢=(G<,G=,G>,σ)𝒢subscript𝐺subscript𝐺subscript𝐺𝜎\\mathscr{G}=(G_{{}_{<}},G_{{}_{=}},G_{{}_{>}},\\sigma) to detect HGT-events and to which extend HGT-events\nare uniquely determined for a given 𝒢𝒢\\mathscr{G}. Relaxed scenarios provide a very general framework in which the concepts of\northology, paralogy, and xenology can be studied in a rigorous manner. In\nSection “Orthology and Quasi-Orthology”,\nwe compared different concepts of orthology\nthat have been proposed for situations with horizontal transfer. We obtained\nsimple results describing the mutual relationships of the corresponding\nvariants of “orthology graphs” on L​(T)𝐿𝑇L(T), and their relations with\nG=subscript𝐺G_{{}_{=}}. With the exception of the strict quasi-orthology graph\nΨw​(𝒮)superscriptΨ𝑤𝒮\\Psi^{w}(\\mathscr{S}), the alternative notions lead to colored cographs similar to\nthe HGT-free case, see . The latter connections are of\npractical importance since the EDT graph G=subscript𝐺G_{{}_{=}}, or the 3-partition graphs,\ncan be estimated from sequence similarities. It will be interesting,\ntherefore, to explore if techniques similar to those employed by\nSchaller et al. [ref]49 can be used to identify the edges on G=subscript𝐺G_{{}_{=}} that do not\ncorrespond to orthology-relationships. We found that, similar to LDT graphs, PDT graphs are also cographs. This is\nin general not the case for EDT graphs, although EDT graphs are perfect\n(Prop. 4). If both gene tree and species tree\nare binary, i.e., fully resolved, then the EDT graph is a cograph.\nHowever, not all proper vertex colorings of a cograph result in an EDT\ngraph (Fig. 8). It remains an interesting open problem to\ncharacterize the “EDT-colorings” of cographs in analogy to the\nhc-colorings of cograph that appear in the context of reciprocal best match\ngraphs  . Moreover, it is at least of\ntheoretical interest to ask how difficult it is to decide whether a\nsuitable coloring σ𝜎\\sigma exists such that (G<,G=,G>,σ)subscript𝐺subscript𝐺subscript𝐺𝜎(G_{{}_{<}},G_{{}_{=}},G_{{}_{>}},\\sigma) is\nexplained by a relaxed scenario. Finding such a coloring corresponds to\nassigning species to genes, a problem that arises in metagenomics. Indeed,\nwhen DNA is extracted from bulk samples taken from the environment, the\nspecies that contains each sequence is unknown since they belong to members\nof a diverse population (for instance, microbial or fungal). Popular\ntechniques to recover a species assignment include sequence similarity\nanalysis  and phylogenetic\nreconstructions . Since our approaches combine\nthese two ideas, it will be interesting to see whether EDT-colorings can be\nuseful in the context of metagenomics. The reconciliation of T𝑇T and S𝑆S implicitly determines what kind of\nevolutionary event corresponds to a vertex v∈V0​(T)𝑣superscript𝑉0𝑇v\\in V^{0}(T). Given a relaxed\nor restricted scenario 𝒮𝒮\\mathscr{S}, the assignment of an event label t​(v)∈Q𝑡𝑣𝑄t(v)\\in Q from some pre-defined set Q𝑄Q of event types is, of course, a matter of\nbiological interpretation of 𝒮𝒮\\mathscr{S}. The definitions of “DTL scenarios”\nas in    assign event labels\nto the inner vertices of T𝑇T that then must satisfy certain consistency\nconditions with the local behavior of the reconciliation map\nμ𝜇\\mu. Event labelings t:V0​(T)→Q:𝑡→superscript𝑉0𝑇𝑄t:V^{0}(T)\\to Q also play a key role in orthology\ndetection in duplication/loss scenarios\n   [ref]49. In relaxed\nscenarios, it is not always possible to assign event types that match with\nstraightforward biological interpretations in an unambiguous manner. For\nexample, from a biological perspective, speciation events are\nusually defined as “passing on the entire ancestral genome to each\noffspring lineage”. In Fig. 3, however, lcaT⁡(a,a′)subscriptlca𝑇𝑎superscript𝑎′\\operatorname{lca}_{T}(a,a^{\\prime})\ndescribes a gene duplication that occurs together with the speciation\nevent. As noted in [51, Fig.2], this issue already arises in\nthe setting of DL-scenarios with multifurcating trees even in HGT-free\nscenarios that satisfy the speciation constraint (S6), see also\n3. Some further pertinent results on event-based\nreconciliation in the presence of HGT were discussed by\nNøjgaard et al. . These point out subtle differences for non-binary\nspecies trees in the definition of event-based DTL-scenarios \nand suggest a natural notion of event-annotated relaxed scenarios. Because\nof these difficulties we have avoided to consider event types as a formal\nlevel in this contribution. Instead, these issues will be the focus of a\nforthcoming contribution. It is reassuring that a graph 333-partition 𝒢𝒢\\mathscr{G} that can be explained\nby a relaxed scenario can always also be explained by a restricted\nscenario. This begs the question, however, whether there is a simple, local\nediting algorithm that converts a “true” scenario in a restricted or at\nleast a fully witnessed one. In the case of HGT-free scenarios, there is a\nsimple rule to exclude “non-observable” vertices in T𝑇T: in this\nrestricted setting, it suffices to recursively remove all deleted genes and\nall inner vertices with a single child . The\nsituation seems to be much less obvious for relaxed scenarios, since these\nmodels are somewhat more general than “event-driven” scenarios. For\ninstance, relaxed scenarios allow multiple descendants from nodes v∈V​(T)𝑣𝑉𝑇v\\in V(T) with μ​(v)∈V​(S)𝜇𝑣𝑉𝑆\\mu(v)\\in V(S). As a consequence, is seems difficult to\ninterpret a vertex v𝑣v that is reconciled with a vertex in the species tree\nas a “speciation event” in the strict sense. The exact meaning of\n“events”, therefore, deserves a more detailed analysis in the setting of\nrelaxed scenarios.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: path\nconnecting x𝑥x and y𝑦y in T𝑇T contains an HGT edge.

It is always a\nproperly colored multipartite graph.
