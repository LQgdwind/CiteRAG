      "content": "Paper Title: Latent reweighting, an almost free improvement for GANs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGANs 0 are an effective way to learn complex and high-dimensional distributions, leading to state-of-the-art models for image synthesis in both unconditional 8 and conditional settings . However, it is well-known that a single generator with an unimodal latent variable cannot recover a distribution composed of disconnected sub-manifolds . This leads to a common problem for practitioners: the existence of very low-quality samples when covering different modes. This is formalized by  which refers to this area as the no GAN’s land and provides impossibility theorems on the learning of disconnected manifolds with standard formulations of GANs. Fitting a disconnected target distribution requires an additional mechanism inserting disconnectedness in the modeled distribution. A first solution is to add some expressivity to the model:  propose to train a mixture of generators, while  make use of a multi-modal latent distribution. A second line of research relies heavily on a variety of Monte-Carlo algorithms, such as Rejection Sampling [ref]3 or Metropolis-Hastings . Monte-Carlo methods aim at sampling from a target distribution, while having only access to samples generated from a proposal distribution. Using the previously learned generative distribution as a proposal distribution, this idea was successfully applied to GANs. However, one of the main drawbacks is that Monte-Carlo algorithms only guarantee to sample from the target distribution under strong assumptions. First, we need access to the density ratios between the proposal and target distributions or equivalently to a perfect discriminator [ref]3. Second, these methods are efficient only if the support of the proposal distribution fully covers the one of the target distribution. This is unlikely to be the case when dealing with high-dimensional datasets . To tackle this issue, we propose a novel method aiming at reducing the Wasserstein distance between the previously trained generative model and the target distribution. This is done via the adversarial training of a third network that learns importance weights in the latent space. Note that this network does not aim at increasing the support of the proposal distribution but at re-weighting the latent distribution, under a Wasserstein criterion. Thus, these importance weights define a new distribution in the latent space, from which we propose to sample with two complementary methods: latent rejection sampling (latentRS) and latent gradient ascent (latentGA). To better understand our approach, we illustrate its efficiency with simple examples. On the top of the Figure 1, we show samples coming from a pre-trained StyleGAN2 8 and their respective acceptance probability (latentRS). At the bottom, we exhibit a sequence of generated images while following a gradient ascent on the learned importance weights (latentGA). Our contributions are the following: We propose a novel approach that trains a neural network to directly modify the latent space of a GAN. This provides a principled way to reduce the Wasserstein distance to the target distribution. We show how to sample from this new generative model with different methods: latent Rejection Sampling (latentRS), latent Gradient Ascent (latentGA), and latentRS+GA, a method that leverages the complementarity between the two previous solutions. We run a large empirical comparison between our proposed methods and previous approaches on a variety of datasets and distributions. We empirically show that all of our proposed solutions significantly reduce the computational cost of inference. More interestingly, our solutions propose a wide span of performances ranging from latentRS, optimizing speed, that matches state-of-the-art almost for free (computational cost divided by 15) and latentRS+GA (computational cost divided by 3) that outperforms previous approaches. Notation. Before moving to the related work section, we shortly present the notation needed in the paper. The goal of the generator is to generate data points that are “similar” to samples collected from some target probability measure μ⋆subscript𝜇⋆\\mu_{\\star}. The measure μ⋆subscript𝜇⋆\\mu_{\\star} is defined on a potentially high-dimensional space ℝDsuperscriptℝ𝐷\\mathds{R}^{D}, equipped with the euclidean norm ∥⋅∥\\|\\cdot\\|. We call μnsubscript𝜇𝑛\\mu_{n} the empirical measure. To approach μ⋆subscript𝜇⋆\\mu_{\\star}, we use a parametric family of generative distribution, where each distribution is the push-forward measure of a latent distribution Z𝑍Z and a continuous function modeled by a neural network.\nIn most applications, the random variable Z𝑍Z defined on a low-dimensional space ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathds{R}^{d} is either a multivariate Gaussian distribution or uniform distribution. The generator is a parameterized class of functions from ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathds{R}^{d} to ℝDsuperscriptℝ𝐷\\mathds{R}^{D}, say 𝒢={Gθ:θ∈Θ}𝒢conditional-setsubscript𝐺𝜃𝜃Θ\\mathscr{G}=\\{G_{\\theta}:\\theta\\in\\Theta\\}, where Θ⊆ℝpΘsuperscriptℝ𝑝\\Theta\\subseteq\\mathds{R}^{p} is the set of parameters describing the model. Each function Gθsubscript𝐺𝜃G_{\\theta} takes input from Z𝑍Z and outputs “fake” observations with distribution μθ=Gθ​♯​Zsubscript𝜇𝜃subscript𝐺𝜃♯𝑍\\mu_{\\theta}=G_{\\theta}\\sharp Z. On the other hand, the discriminator is described by a family of functions from ℝDsuperscriptℝ𝐷\\mathds{R}^{D} to ℝℝ\\mathds{R}, say 𝒟={Dα:α∈Λ}𝒟conditional-setsubscript𝐷𝛼𝛼Λ\\mathscr{D}=\\{D_{\\alpha}:\\alpha\\in\\Lambda\\}, Λ⊆ℝQΛsuperscriptℝ𝑄\\Lambda\\subseteq\\mathds{R}^{Q}. Finally, for any given distribution μ𝜇\\mu, we note Sμsubscript𝑆𝜇S_{\\mu} its support.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: to train a mixture of generators, while  make use of a multi-modal latent distribution.
