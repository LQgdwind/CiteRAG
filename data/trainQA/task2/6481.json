      "content": "Paper Title: Principles and Guidelines for Evaluating Social Robot Navigation Algorithms\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nArenaBench \nis a downloadable, simulated social navigation benchmark designed to test how navigation algorithms perform under different tasks. Building on the 2D Flatland555https://flatland-simulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ and 3D Gazebo \nsimulators and the Pedsim \nimplementation of the Social Forces Model (SFM) , ArenaBench provides the ability to evaluate both classical and learning-based approaches in the ROS \nframework. In addition to providing tools for automatically and manually creating scenarios, ArenaBench supplies both the non-learned baselines MPC , DWA , TEB  and the learned baselines NAVREP , Gring [ref]121 as well as ArenaBench’s own trained ROSNAV approach.\nSupported robots include the Robois Turtlebot3,\nClearPath Jackal,\nand Festo Robotino 4.\nArenaBench provides a variety of navigation metrics including success rate, collision, time to goal, path length, velocity, acceleration, jerk, curvature, angle over length, roughness, and clearing distance. However, ArenaBench does not at this time support human evaluation of robot behavior. DynaBARN  is a downloadable, simulated social navigation benchmark designed to test how algorithms respond to a variety of different pedestrian models. Building on the barn navigation benchmark , DynaBARN provides 60 environments in the Gazebo simulator. DynaBARN evaluates algorithms against social behavior through crowds of cylindrical pedestrians controlled by motion trajectories specified by polynomials of different orders and different numbers of pedestrians. It is customizable to different robot platforms, with a Jackal provided. Only success rate (collision-free navigation reaching the goal) is provided as a metric, though the platform is extensible. DynaBARN provides several baselines including DWA , TEB , a behavior cloned (BC)  policy, and a TD3  RL policy. While DynaBARN does not support human evaluation of robot behavior, it includes a demonstration pipeline to collect human teleoperation baselines of navigation in dynamic environments. gym-collision-avoidance [ref]24 is a downloadable, simulated benchmark used to evaluate multi-agent collision avoidance. Created to evaluate the GA3C-CADRL algorithm [ref]24  against the baselines ORCA [ref]126, SA-CADRL , and DRLMACA , this benchmark provides a variety of multi-agent scenarios involving cylinders in simplified synthetic environments and measures Success Rate, Collisions, Stuck and Time-to-Goal metrics. However, it focuses on policy-controlled agents interacting with each other and does not support human evaluation of robot behavior. HuNavSim  is a downloadable, simulated benchmark focused on improving the development of social navigation systems around a variety of human behaviors. HuNavSim combines Behavior Trees (BT)  and the Social Forces Model (SFM)  to provide a variety of human behaviors ranging from indifferent, surprised, curious, fearful and aggressive. HuNavSim is implemented as a framework that can work with various simulators, and provides a plugin to work with ROS2 and Gazebo. HuNavSim provides a variety of metrics comparable those used in the SEAN simulator  and other benchmarks, but does not provide baseline policies or a way to evaluate robot behavior with human ratings. SocNavBench  is a downloadable, simulated benchmark used to evaluate social navigation algorithms against prerecorded episodes of human pedestrian behavior drawn from the ucy  and eth  datasets. SocNavBench provides visually realistic pedestrians and environments, as well as baselines based on the Social Forces Model (SFM) , ORCA [ref]126, and SA-CADRL  as well as a pedestrian-unaware policy. SocNavBench provides a wide variety of metrics in areas such as path quality, motion quality, robot-pedestrian interaction, and episode statistics. However, SocNavBench’s purpose is to automatically generate scores, so it makes the design decision to focus on automatically generated metrics which approximate human ratings instead.\n\nReference markers found: [121]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]121: In addition to providing tools for automatically and manually creating scenarios, ArenaBench supplies both the non-learned baselines MPC , DWA , TEB  and the learned baselines NAVREP , Gring [ref]121 as well as ArenaBench’s own trained ROSNAV approach.\nSupported robots include the Robois Turtlebot3,\nClearPath Jackal,\nand Festo Robotino 4.\nArenaBench provides a variety of navigation\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
