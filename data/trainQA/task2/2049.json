      "content": "Paper Title: Gradient-based Data Subversion Attack Against Binary Classifiers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStudies on the label contamination attacks have been more focused on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and are not generalized to other classifiers  [ref]6 [ref]39. The attack strategy by Biggio et al in  flips the labels of the data points that are non-support vectors and decreases the probability of contaminating the labels of support vectors. Also, they demonstrated that a random label flip of 40% of data samples in a synthetic dataset can deteriorate the performance of SVMs by reducing their accuracy (≈\\approx25%). They further crafted inputs using a gradient ascent method and inserted them into the training sets and degraded the performance of the classifier [ref]6. Xiao et al  proposed the attacks on feature selection algorithms and investigated their robustness. Xiao et al [ref]39 proposed the approach ALFA for finding the near-optimal label flips and compared it with uniform random flip, nearest-first flip (minimum distance to the decision boundary) and furthest-first flip (maximum distance to the decision boundary) strategies. Moreover, they assumed that the attacker has full knowledge of the victim’s learning model. This assumption considered as the starting point for understanding the attack strategies [ref]27. Paudice et al  used a heuristic approach which aims to find the required number of instances that maximizes the error function of the model on a validation set. Further, the authors proposed a defense strategy that re-labels the points that are suspicious to be malicious based on the nearest neighbor approach. Mei et al [ref]27 formalized the training set attack as a bilevel optimization framework. Their objective was to modify the training data such that the distance between the learner’s learned model and the original model is minimum, in addition to satisfying the attacker’s objectives using the least number of manipulations. They demonstrated their strategy on the SVM, Logistic and Linear Regressions. Zhao et al  studied the label contamination attack as a mixed integer bilevel optimal problem and proposed Projected Gradient Ascent (PGA) algorithm to solve it. Their approach was more realistic compared to prior-arts as they considered attackers with arbitrary objectives in a black-box setting. Also, they studied the transferability of poisoning attacks. Transferability of data poisoning attacks has been studied in prior works   . Muñoz-González et al developed a data poisoning attack for deep networks  and demonstrated the transferability of their attack across different learning algorithms. Demontis et al   studied the transferability of evasion and poisoning attacks in their recent work. These studies shed some insights on the factors that can influence the attack transfer. In our work, we show the transferability of our attack in various learning algorithms. The existing label contamination attack strategies analyze all the training instances for finding a set of near-optimal data instances to flip. They solve a bilevel optimization problem [ref]39  [ref]27  which is complex in terms of solving two optimization problems within each iteration. The attack strategy PGA  trains a linear classifier in each iteration which is more efficient than the former. However, they consider the dual form of the classifiers that increases the number of computations when the training set is large. Koh et al  efficiently approximated influence functions which formalize the impact of a training point on a machine learning model. They computed the influence by forming a quadratic approximation to the empirical risk around model parameters and taking a single newton step. Since we compute the label flip attack on a given dataset, we filter the points based on the gradients of the loss function with respect to the predicted label. Recent studies have developed data poisoning attacks and defenses for online learning   . In this setting, attacker has to consider the online nature of the problem where data is sequential in nature and the classifier is a more complex function of the data stream. Moreover, the order of the data influences the attack. Further, the knowledge about the future data point is limited for the attacker. All of these together makes the online learning attack more challenging. We consider the offline setting in this work and propose an algorithm to find the candidate set by filtering the points from the training instances. We evaluate our approach in multiple datasets. Further, the transferability of the proposed algorithm on various machine learning models is studied.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: Studies on the label contamination attacks have been more focused on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and are not generalized to other classifiers  [ref]6 [ref]39.
