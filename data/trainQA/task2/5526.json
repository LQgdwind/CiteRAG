Deep networks are remarkable to learn feature representation of transferability . Currently, combining the theories of domain adaptation  to feature representation in deep network is the main research direction for domain adaptation. Various algorithms have been proposed for domain adaptation in natural language process[ref]22. Based on the techniques used in domain adaptation, these methods, in general, achieved in three different ways:(1)Discrepancy-based domain adaptation use Maximum Mean Discrepancy(MMD) criterion to reduces the shift between the two domains; (2)Adversarial-based method refers to introduce adversarial technology inspired by the Generative adversarial nets(GAN) to find transferable representations that is applicable to both the source domain and the target domain[ref]26 or (3) Pixel-level domain adaptation method refers to translate the source images to target images . Recently, adversarial-based methods are remarkable based on works to improve the domain discriminator or the procedure of adversarial learning. ADDA design two feature representation for source domain and target domain respectively [ref]26. With the same feature representation for two domains, CDAN use the feature representation and the classier prediction to condition domain discriminator . Applied the more effect of the divergence of with two hypothesis , Saito et al.  proposed the adversarial domain adaptation with two classifiers. GPDA follows the procedure of the adversarial domain adaptation of two classifiers with a deep max-margin Gaussian processes . However, these methods are based on exacted match of label spaces for two domains or the data distribution of the source domain is balanced.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: The aim of domain adaptation [ref]17 is to transfer knowledge between two domains by reducing domain shift.
