Maximizing the quality of discrete representations of Pareto sets was studied with hypervolume measure\nin the Hypervolume Subset Selection (HSS) problem  .\nThe HSS problem, maximizing representativeness of k𝑘k solutions among a PF of size n𝑛n, is 𝒩​𝒫𝒩𝒫\\mathcal{N}\\mathcal{P}-hard in 3D (and higher dimensions) .\nAn exact algorithm in nO​(k)superscript𝑛𝑂𝑘n^{O(\\sqrt{k})} in 3D and a polynomial-time approximation scheme for any constant dimension d𝑑d were also provided .\n2D PF instances are solvable in polynomial time, a DP algorithm running\nin O​(k​n2)𝑂𝑘superscript𝑛2O(kn^{2}) time and using O​(k​n)𝑂𝑘𝑛O(kn) space was firstly provided in .\nThe time complexity was improved in O​(k​n+n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑘𝑛𝑛𝑛O(kn+n\\log n) by  and in O​(k​(n−k)+n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑘𝑛𝑘𝑛𝑛O(k(n-k)+n\\log n) by 4.\nSome similar results exist also for clustering problems.\nThe k𝑘k-median and k𝑘k-medoid problems are 𝒩​𝒫𝒩𝒫\\mathcal{N}\\mathcal{P} hard in 2D since .\nThe 2D PF cases are solvable in O​(n3)𝑂superscript𝑛3O(n^{3}) time with DP algorithms  .\nThe 1D cases are solvable in O​(n​k)𝑂𝑛𝑘O(nk) time 1.\nMin Sum of Square Clustering (MSSC), also denoted k𝑘k-means problem,\nis also 𝒩​𝒫𝒩𝒫\\mathcal{N}\\mathcal{P}-hard for 2D cases 8.\nThe 1D cases of k𝑘k-means are also solvable by a DP algorithm,\nwith a complexity in O​(k​n)𝑂𝑘𝑛O(kn) using memory space in O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) [ref]28. Similar results are available for variants of p𝑝p-center problems.\nThe p𝑝p-center problems minimize the radius of a ball, to cover all the points with p𝑝p such identical balls.\nContrary to the continuous version, discrete p𝑝p-center variant consider the additional constraint to have a discrete set of points as candidates for ball centers. It makes sense to consider the original points as such candidates for centers, as in [ref]16.\nThe dual of a Max-min p𝑝p-dispersion is similar to a min-max optimization as in p𝑝p-center problems.\nDuality relations hold between p𝑝p-dispersion-Mm and p𝑝p-center problems\nin 1D and in tree structures: p𝑝p-dispersion-Mm is the dual of the continuous (p−1)𝑝1(p-1)-center for such cases .\nMax-min p𝑝p-dispersion and p𝑝p-center problems have similar complexity results.\nThe discrete and continuous p𝑝p-center problems are 𝒩​𝒫𝒩𝒫\\mathcal{N}\\mathcal{P}-hard in general,\nthe discrete p𝑝p-center problem in ℝ2superscriptℝ2{\\mathbb{R}}^{2} with a Euclidean distance is also 𝒩​𝒫𝒩𝒫\\mathcal{N}\\mathcal{P}-hard .\nThe 1D and 2D PF sub-cases of p𝑝p-center problems are polynomially solvable with DP algorithms.\nThe 1D continuous p𝑝p-center is solvable in O​(n​log3⁡n)𝑂𝑛superscript3𝑛O(n\\log^{3}n) time ,\nwhereas the time complexity in a 2D PF is in O​(p​n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑝𝑛𝑛O(pn\\log n)  [ref]16.\nThe discrete p𝑝p-center problem in a 2D PF is solvable in O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n) time and O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) space ,\nwhereas it is solvable in O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) time in 1D .\nThe Min-sum p𝑝p-radii problems, denoted also min-sum-diameter, are p𝑝p-center variants, where the covering balls may not be identical. It is a min-Sum-Max optimization, that we can compare to the\nMax-Sum-min optimization with p𝑝p-dispersion-MSm.\nMin-sum p𝑝p-radii is 𝒩​𝒫𝒩𝒫\\mathcal{N}\\mathcal{P}-hard in the general case and polynomial within a tree structure .\nThe 𝒩​𝒫𝒩𝒫\\mathcal{N}\\mathcal{P}-hardness is also proven even in metrics induced by weighted planar graphs\n.\nIn a 2D PF, Min-sum p𝑝p-radii is solvable in O​(p​n2)𝑂𝑝superscript𝑛2O(pn^{2}) time with a DP algorithm [ref]16.\nIn 1D, a specific algorithm runs in O​(n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝑛O(n\\log n) time [ref]16. Lastly, partial variants were studied for p𝑝p-center problems and variants in a 2D PF,\nallowing that m𝑚m points are not covered. These points can be outliers to remove or isolated points that are wished to be detected in the context of EAs [ref]16.\nDP algorithms for 2D PF can be extended allowing to uncover m>0𝑚0m>0 points. The time and space complexity of DP algorithms are\nthen multiplied by a factor m𝑚m [ref]16.\nIn particular, partial p𝑝p-center problems in a 2D PF are solvable in O​(m​p​n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑚𝑝𝑛𝑛O(mpn\\log n) time and O​(m​n)𝑂𝑚𝑛O(mn) space [ref]16.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: also 𝒩​𝒫𝒩𝒫\\mathcal{N}\\mathcal{P}-hard for 2D cases 8.\nThe 1D cases of k𝑘k-means are also solvable by a DP algorithm,\nwith a complexity in O​(k​n)𝑂𝑘𝑛O(kn) using memory space in O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) [ref]28. Similar results are available for variants of p𝑝p-center problems.\nThe p𝑝p-center problems minimize the radius of a ball, to cover all the points with p𝑝p such identical balls.\nContrary to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
