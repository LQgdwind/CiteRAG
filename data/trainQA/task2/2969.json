With slight abuse of notation, denote Vcπ​(ρ):=𝔼s∼ρ​[Vcπ​(s)]assignsubscriptsuperscript𝑉𝜋𝑐𝜌subscript𝔼similar-to𝑠𝜌delimited-[]subscriptsuperscript𝑉𝜋𝑐𝑠V^{\\pi}_{c}(\\rho):=\\mathbb{E}_{s\\sim\\rho}[V^{\\pi}_{c}(s)]. For any policy π𝜋\\pi and any (s,a)∈𝒮×𝒜𝑠𝑎𝒮𝒜(s,a)\\in\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}, we define the discounted state-action visitation distribution as dρπ​(s,a):=(1−γ)​𝔼s0∼ρ​[∑t=0∞γt​ℙ​(st=s,at=a|s0)]assignsuperscriptsubscript𝑑𝜌𝜋𝑠𝑎1𝛾subscript𝔼similar-tosubscript𝑠0𝜌delimited-[]superscriptsubscript𝑡0superscript𝛾𝑡ℙformulae-sequencesubscript𝑠𝑡𝑠subscript𝑎𝑡conditional𝑎subscript𝑠0d_{\\rho}^{\\pi}(s,a):=(1-\\gamma)\\mathbb{E}_{s_{0}\\sim\\rho}[\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\gamma^{t}\\mathbb{P}(s_{t}=s,a_{t}=a|s_{0})]. It then follows that Vcπ​(ρ)=11−γ​⟨dρπ,c⟩subscriptsuperscript𝑉𝜋𝑐𝜌11𝛾superscriptsubscript𝑑𝜌𝜋𝑐V^{\\pi}_{c}(\\rho)=\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}\\langle d_{\\rho}^{\\pi},c\\rangle by viewing dρπsubscriptsuperscript𝑑𝜋𝜌d^{\\pi}_{\\rho} and c𝑐c as |𝒮|​|𝒜|𝒮𝒜|\\mathcal{S}||\\mathcal{A}|-dimensional vectors indexed by (s,a)∈𝒮×𝒜𝑠𝑎𝒮𝒜(s,a)\\in\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}. When it is clear from the context, with slight abuse of notation, we also denote the discounted state visitation distribution with respect to (w.r.t.) the initial state distribution ρ𝜌\\rho and policy π𝜋\\pi by dρπ​(s):=(1−γ)​𝔼s0∼ρ​[∑t=0∞γt​ℙ​(st=s|s0)],∀s∈𝒮formulae-sequenceassignsuperscriptsubscript𝑑𝜌𝜋𝑠1𝛾subscript𝔼similar-tosubscript𝑠0𝜌delimited-[]superscriptsubscript𝑡0superscript𝛾𝑡ℙsubscript𝑠𝑡conditional𝑠subscript𝑠0for-all𝑠𝒮d_{\\rho}^{\\pi}(s):=(1-\\gamma)\\mathbb{E}_{s_{0}\\sim\\rho}[\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\gamma^{t}\\mathbb{P}(s_{t}=s|s_{0})],\\ \\forall s\\in\\mathcal{S}.

For any two policies π,π′𝜋superscript𝜋′\\pi,\\pi^{\\prime} and for any discounted state visitation distribution d𝑑d, the expected KL divergence between π𝜋\\pi and π′superscript𝜋′\\pi^{\\prime} is defined as Dd(π||π′):=∑s∈𝒮d(s)D(π(⋅|s)||π′(⋅|s))D_{d}(\\pi||\\pi^{\\prime}):=\\sum_{s\\in\\mathcal{S}}d(s)D\\left(\\pi(\\cdot|s)||\\pi^{\\prime}(\\cdot|s)\\right). Given a CMDP M𝑀M, the goal is to solve the constrained optimization problem: Let π∗superscript𝜋\\pi^{*} be the optimal policy of the CMDP problem in (1). It is well-known that in general the optimal policy π∗superscript𝜋\\pi^{*} is randomized and the Bellman equation may not hold [ref]4. We assume strict feasibility of (1), which naturally implies the existence of the optimal policy. There exists ξ>0𝜉0\\xi>0 and π¯¯𝜋\\overline{\\pi} such that Vciπ¯​(ρ)≤−ξsuperscriptsubscript𝑉subscript𝑐𝑖¯𝜋𝜌𝜉V_{c_{i}}^{\\overline{\\pi}}(\\rho)\\leq-\\xi, ∀i∈[m]for-all𝑖delimited-[]𝑚\\forall i\\in[m]. This assumption is quite standard in the optimization literature for analyzing primal-dual algorithms . In particular, many related works in the CMDP literature (see, e.g.,    [ref]21) make the same strict feasibility assumption. Note that unlike previous primal-dual algorithms   for CMDPs, where ξ𝜉\\xi is required to be known a priori for the projection of dual variables, our proposed algorithm does not require the knowledge of ξ𝜉\\xi, and this assumption is made only for the analysis. The constrained optimization problem in (1) can be reparameterized by using the discounted state-action visitation distribution as decision variables, as follows [ref]4: where 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} is the domain of visitation distributions defined as 𝒟:={d∈Δ​(𝒮×𝒜):γ​∑s′,a′P​(s|s′,a′)​d​(s′,a′)+(1−γ)​ρ​(s)=∑ad​(s,a),∀s∈𝒮}assign𝒟conditional-set𝑑Δ𝒮𝒜formulae-sequence𝛾subscriptsuperscript𝑠′superscript𝑎′𝑃conditional𝑠superscript𝑠′superscript𝑎′𝑑superscript𝑠′superscript𝑎′1𝛾𝜌𝑠subscript𝑎𝑑𝑠𝑎for-all𝑠𝒮\\mathcal{D}:=\\{d\\in\\Delta(\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}):\\gamma\\sum_{s^{\\prime},a^{\\prime}}P(s|s^{\\prime},a^{\\prime})d(s^{\\prime},a^{\\prime})+(1-\\gamma)\\rho(s)=\\sum_{a}d(s,a),~{}\\forall s\\in\\mathcal{S}\\}. It is straight forward to notice that 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D} is a compact convex set, and the linear programming (LP) formulation of the CMDP problem in (2) satisfies strong duality. The LP approach can be computationally expensive for CMDPs with a large number of states and actions. Moreover, the LP approach requires explicit knowledge of the transition kernel P𝑃P, which makes it not amenable to model-free RL algorithms. In this work, we focus on a policy gradient-based approach for solving the CMDP problem.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: π∗superscript𝜋\\pi^{*} be the optimal policy of the CMDP problem in (1).
