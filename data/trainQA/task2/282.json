Several methods have been proposed to improve the robustness of DNN models against adversarial attacks.\nTwo of the most successful defense frameworks against adversarial attacks are adversarial training and randomized smoothing.\nThe adversarial training mechanism trains a model using adversarial examples of a specific ‚Ñìpsubscript‚Ñìùëù\\ell_{p} perturbation type to achieve robustness for that perturbation type  .\nThis training process is expensive as it requires the generation of adversarial examples at each training iteration.\nTram√®r and Boneh (2019)  demonstrates that adversarial training can achieve robustness for multiple perturbation types only by incorporating different types of adversaries for training.\nHowever, this raises the question of how many perturbation types one should include for training? Randomized smoothing technique introduces run-time randomization that evaluates multiple noisy copies of a test image and returns the most probable class as their final prediction  .\nThis framework provides certified robustness for minor-‚Ñì2subscript‚Ñì2\\ell_{2} perturbation.\nHowever, it offers no guarantee for other perturbation types. In contrast, manifold-based defenses incorporate a generative network to project an input image into the clean data manifold and have the potential to achieve robustness for multiple perturbation types\n  [ref]13.\nHowever, due to the limited capacities of existing generative models, they often fail to capture the complete data manifold for complex image domains and project the adversarial images into the clean data manifold.\nTo date, Schott et al. (2019) [ref]13 provide the only effective manifold-based defense to achieve robustness for MNIST.\nEven then, they cannot train a single robust classifier for all ‚Ñìp‚â•1subscript‚Ñìùëù1\\ell_{p\\geq 1} perturbation types. In this work, we propose a novel manifold-based defense framework for image classification that can scale to complex data manifold and achieve robustness against any minor for ‚Ñìp‚â•1subscript‚Ñìùëù1\\ell_{p\\geq 1} perturbation.\nGiven an image, ùíôùíô\\bm{x} and some perturbation bound œµpsubscriptitalic-œµùëù\\epsilon_{p}, for all p‚â•1ùëù1p\\geq 1,\nthe goal is to build a classifier ‚Ñ±‚Ñ±\\mathcal{F} such that the prediction remains unchanged, that is, To this end, we devise an approximate manifold defense mechanism called RBF-CNN that can achieve robustness for any minor ‚Ñìp‚â•1subscript‚Ñìùëù1\\ell_{p\\geq 1} perturbation.\nOur RBF-CNN models consist of a radial basis function (RBF) layer and a reconstruction layer followed by a convolutional neural network (CNN) image classifier.\nAn RBF layer consists of RBF filters and is utilized as a generative structure to capture the density of small image patches, instead of the distribution of full-sized training images .\nEach RBF filter acts as a template matching function by producing similar match scores for two similar patterns in any ‚Ñìp‚â•1subscript‚Ñìùëù1\\ell_{p\\geq 1}-norms [ref]2.\nWe show that our reconstruction layer utilizes this property to mitigate any minor perturbation in any ‚Ñìp‚â•1subscript‚Ñìùëù1\\ell_{p\\geq 1}-norm.\nFurther, incorporating the reconstruction process for training allows us to improve the adversarial robustness of our RBF-CNN models. Experimental results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that our RBF-CNN models achieve robustness against all ‚Ñì1subscript‚Ñì1\\ell_{1}, ‚Ñì2subscript‚Ñì2\\ell_{2} and ‚Ñì‚àûsubscript‚Ñì\\ell_{\\infty} bounded adversarial attacks and provide certified robustness for ‚Ñì2subscript‚Ñì2\\ell_{2} bounded perturbations.\nThe saliency maps produced by RBF-CNN models conform to human interpretation and thereby ensure that our RBF and reconstruction layers do not cause gradient obfuscation .\nTherefore, our framework does not provide a false sense of robustness by resisting attackers to generate optimal adversarial examples .\nFurther, these interpretable saliency maps provide visual evidence of robustness against adversarial attacks .\nTo the best of our knowledge, RBF-CNN is the first manifold based defense framework to achieve robustness for any ‚Ñìp‚â•1subscript‚Ñìùëù1\\ell_{p\\geq 1} perturbations and provides a desirable trade-off between robustness vs. accuracy at run-time.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Despite the impeccable success of deep neural network (DNN)-based models in various applications, there is a growing awareness of their vulnerability against adversarial attacks [ref]1 [ref]2.\nAn adversary deliberately introduces minor perturbations that mislead the networks to produce wrong predictions for the perceptually identical inputs.\nThe adversarial vulnerability of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
