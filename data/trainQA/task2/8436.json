      "content": "Paper Title: Code Generation and Runtime Techniques for Enabling Data-Efficient Deep Learning Training on GPUs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe use a machine with two A100 PCIe GPUs and seven Intel P5800X SSDs, as Table 5.3 specifies. The SSDs are organized into two RAID0 arrays: one with three SSDs and the other with four SSDs. Each array is the dedicated offloading target of one of the A100 GPUs. We measured the memory usage of the A100 with four SSDs during the evaluation. For consistent performance, the GPUs are locked at base frequency. The latest Megatron-DeepSpeed [ref]163 is installed, incorporating DeepSpeed techniques into Megatron and ensuring interoperability. We measure the system pretraining performance on three models: BERT [ref]43 as an encoder-only model, GPT  as a decoder-only model, and T5 [ref]45 as an encoder-decoder model.\nWe use the OSCAR corpus   as the dataset. Before we further explain the model setup, we clarify the batch taxonomy. Like other deep learning models, LLM model training typically uses mini-batches, smaller subsets of the training data. Before Section 5.4, we use the terms “mini-batch” and “batch” interchangeably. However, the introduction of data parallelism complicates this terminology: Now, the samples processed in each training step are partitioned into several groups, and each group is assigned to a data-parallel rank. To avoid confusion, in cases where data parallelism is enabled, we refer to all the samples in each training step as a global batch, and we refer to the samples assigned to one data-parallel rank a mini-batch. Such cases where data parallelism is enabled are only in Section 5.4.4. Micro-batch is at the lowest level of the batch taxonomy. When gradient accumulation is enabled, a global batch or a mini-batch is further divided into smaller groups for concurrent processing. Similarly, when pipeline parallelism is enabled, such a phenomenon may occur. Each group of samples is called a micro-batch. In particular, micro-batch refers to the samples processed in one operator kernel launch. We use the two A100 GPUs for tensor parallelism. The number of micro-batches per step is fixed at one because without pipeline parallelism, in each training iteration, Megatron-DeepSpeed will not start a new micro-batch before both forward propagation and backward propagation of the previous micro-batch are done. A micro-batch number larger than one only brings in gradient accumulation and does not affect the activation offloading pattern. In other words, unless stated otherwise, the micro-batch size is equivalent to global batch size throughout Section 5.4.\nThroughout Section 5.4, no ZeRO technique is used. Besides, the optimizer states, i.e., what stage-1 ZeRO shards only, may be shared across other dimensions than across the data-parallel ranks: In Megatron or Megatron-DeepSpeed, this is enabled by the --use-distributed-optimizer argument, which we also do not enable in experiments across Section 5.4.\nIn our experiments, the hidden dimension is from 8,192 to 16,384, and we use typical hyper-parameters [ref]43  [ref]45 for hidden dimensions within this range. The attention head dimension is 128. The text sequence length is 1,024. For T5, the number of decoders is half the number of layers, rounded down. FlashAttention-2  is used with or without SSDTrain for optimized attention computation. As each A100 has only 40 GB of device memory, to explore the design space closer to that in real-world training systems with A100 80 GB and later GPUs  , we make several mitigations. First, we use FP16 instead of mixed precision, eliminating the FP32 weight copy. Second, we use SGD instead of Adam as the optimizer to reduce the memory use by optimizer states. The two measures only affect accumulation operations and weight updates, thus imposing a constant bias in the training step time and memory usage in execution with or without SSDTrain.\n\nReference markers found: [163]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]163: one of the A100 GPUs.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
