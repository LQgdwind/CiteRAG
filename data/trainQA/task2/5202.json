      "content": "Paper Title: Distribution Fitting for Combating Mode Collapse in Generative Adversarial Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAdding constraints is another simple and effective way to suppress mode collapse. Arjovsky et al. [ref]1 first proposed to clip the gradient to satisfy Lipschitz continuity. This idea brought lots of related research. Then Gulrajani et al. [ref]15 improved the method by introducing gradient penalty, which is more stable. Kodali et al.  also proposed to introduce the penalty to limit the gradient around some real data points. Miyato et al. [ref]32 proposed to constrain the spectral norm of each network layer to control the Lipschitz constant. Liu et al.  found an issue of spectral collapse and proposed a method to alleviate the issue. Mescheder et al.  analyzed the regularization strategies and proved local convergence for simplified gradient penalties. Ge et al.  introduced the clustering regularization term in the network to avoid mode collapse. The aim of these methods is to limit the gradient because the gradient will be sharp when mode collapse occurs . In addition to limiting gradients, other constraints were also applied. Tran et al.  proposed a distance constraint to enforce compatibility between the latent sample distances and the corresponding data sample distances. Mao et al.  proposed maximizing the distance ratio between generated images. Eghbal-zadeh et al.  encouraged the discriminator to form clusters, which will lead the generator to discover different modes. Compared to limiting gradients, these methods explicitly specify the generated diversity. In this work, we propose a new constraint from a novel perspective. The parameters of the real and generated distributions are constrained to be almost the same. Thus, to maintain the consistency of parameters, the data modes cannot be missed.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Adding constraints is another simple and effective way to suppress mode collapse.
