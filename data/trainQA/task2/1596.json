      "content": "Paper Title: Bounded Memory Active Learning through Enriched Queries\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe main focus of our work lies in understanding not only when active learning can achieve exponential improvement over passive learning, but when this can be done by a learner with limited memory. Previous works studying active learning with enriched queries mostly focus on the pool-based model, where the learner receives a large batch of unlabeled samples rather than access to a sampling oracle. In this case, the implicit assumption is that the learner may query any subset of samples from the pool, but this requires the learner to use a large amount of storage. Adapting definitions from the passive learning literature [ref]25  [ref]3, we define a new, more realistic model for active learning with enriched queries in which the learner may only store some finite number of points from a stream of samples. At any given step, we restrict the learner to querying only points it currently remembers. More formally, we consider learners equipped with two tapes, the query and work tapes, and two counters, the sample and query counters. The query tape stores points in the instance space XùëãX that the learner has saved and may wish to query. The work tape, on the other hand, stores bits which provide any extra information about these points needed for computation‚Äîtypically this entails query responses, but we will see cases where other types of information are useful as well. The sample and query counters, true to name, track the total number of unlabeled samples drawn and queries made by the algorithm at any given step. We note that the complexity of the query tape is measured in the number of points stored there at any given time, rather than in the total number of bits required to represent it. This matches early works on bounded-memory learning in the passive regime [ref]25  [ref]3 and is necessary due to the fact that we are interested mainly in working over infinite instance spaces like the reals (where representing even a single point may take infinite bits). It is also worth noting that this avoids the fact that different representations of data may have different bit complexities‚Äîgiven a certain representation of the data (say with finite bit-complexity), it is easy to convert our memory bounds if desired to a model counting only bits. We now discuss our model in greater depth. Given the query and work tapes, the learner may choose at each step from the following options: Sample a point and add it to the query tape. Remove a point from the query tape. Query any subset of points on the query tape, writing the results on the work tape. Write or remove a bit from the work tape. Further, as in previous work [ref]3, we allow the action taken by the algorithm at any step to depend on the contents of the query and sample counters. This can be formalized in one of two ways. The first, considered implicitly by Ameur et al.¬†[ref]3, is to think of the algorithm as governed by a non-uniform transition function that may depend on the entire content of the sample and query counters. We will generally take this view throughout the paper since it is simpler, but if one wishes to use a uniform model of computation, another method is to allow the algorithm to run ‚Äúsimple‚Äù randomized procedures that only take about loglog space in the size of the counter. Since in general our algorithms use at most n=poly‚Äã(Œµ‚àí1,log‚Å°(1/Œ¥))ùëõpolysuperscriptùúÄ11ùõøn=\\text{poly}(\\varepsilon^{-1},\\log(1/\\delta)) samples, the latter view essentially allocates a special block of O‚Äã(log‚Å°log‚Å°(1/Œµ)+log‚Å°log‚Å°(1/Œ¥))ùëÇ1ùúÄ1ùõøO(\\log\\log(1/\\varepsilon)+\\log\\log(1/\\delta)) memory555In a bit more detail, we can use approximate counting to probabilistically estimate the counter up to a small constant factor with probability at least 1‚àíŒ¥1ùõø1-\\delta in space O‚Äã(log‚Å°(log‚Å°(n))+log‚Å°(log‚Å°(1/Œ¥)))ùëÇùëõ1ùõøO(\\log(\\log(n))+\\log(\\log(1/\\delta))) , which explains the discrepancy in dependence on Œ¥ùõø\\delta in these two equations. to deal with the counter. We note that because we allow this procedure to be randomized, this version of the model requires expected rather than worst-case bounds on query and computational complexity. With this in mind, we say that a hypothesis class is RPU-learnable with bounded memory if there exists an RPU-learner for the class whose query and work tapes never exceed some constant M‚Äã(X,H)ùëÄùëãùêªM(X,H) length independent of the learning parameters ŒµùúÄ\\varepsilon and Œ¥ùõø\\delta. At a finer grain level, we say that such a class is learnable with memory M‚Äã(X,H)ùëÄùëãùêªM(X,H). We emphasize that as in [ref]3, we do not measure the memory usage of the counter. Indeed, it is not hard to see that some sort of counter or memory scaling with ŒµùúÄ\\varepsilon and Œ¥ùõø\\delta is necessary to give a stopping condition for the learner. Finally, we note that while previous techniques such as the inference dimension algorithm of  can certainly be modified to fit into the above framework, they do not result in bounded memory learners, requiring storage that scales with ŒµùúÄ\\varepsilon and Œ¥ùõø\\delta in both the query and work tapes.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: is that the learner may query any subset of samples from the pool, but this requires the learner to use a large amount of storage.
