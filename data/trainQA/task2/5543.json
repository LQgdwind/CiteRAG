      "content": "Paper Title: Robot path planning using deep reinforcement learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn mapless navigation systems, there isn’t an available representation of the environment; the robot perceives the environment as it navigates and must be able to recognise objects, landmarks or any similar type of information that allows it to infer knowledge about where its goal is located. Most of these systems use visual information, primarily the first-person-view image, and perform some reactive behaviour as they process the incoming data [ref]12. Optical Flow methods use a sequence of images to estimate the motion of objects and features. Velocities perceived are used for the robot’s decision-making, always preferring to move in the direction of less change. This is also the main disadvantage of these methods . Appearance-based methods store and memorise images of the environment and associate them with certain relative localisation to the goal, allowing the robot to perform the correct motion control. However, labelling the desired images and developing the appropriate criteria may be difficult and time-consuming . Feature tracking-based methods rely on detecting features and motion from the elements in the environment and, based on that information, estimate the robot’s trajectory and motion [ref]5. Object recognition is more symbolic and can detect features rather than memorising precise objects or positions. Deep learning approaches are very similar in the sense that neural networks are trained with many images to identify features of the objects in the environment . All the aforementioned methods are limited to one task except the DL-based. All of them require the use of labelled images that indicate the desired motion at a specific place or the landmark it represents, which can be very costly to produce. On the contrary, RL agents can be trained for different tasks and allow simulated environments to safely and efficiently train an agent before transferring it to a real-life robot, reducing the computational load needed to learn the task. Finally, technological advances allow the recreation of more realistic and complex scenarios and accelerate learning. Choices of DRL algorithms in robotics include different variations of DQN, and policy search methods, such as Proximal Policy Optimization  (PPO), Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic  (A3C) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients  (DDPG). In the case of mobile robots, different tasks have been accomplished using DRL methods, the most common being obstacle avoidance and navigation. However, more complex tasks can be performed depending on the information provided to the agent. A summary of the related works can be seen in Table 1. For the obstacle avoidance task, Lei Tai and Ming Liu  implemented a DQN agent trained to explore indoor environments by using depth images as the states and a CNN pre-trained with real-world samples. Linhai Xie et al.  combined a CNN trained to predict depth images with a D3QN agent to propose an approach that uses only monocular RGB vision as input. They also showed that the D3QN model outperformed a vanilla DQN model on both training speed and performance. Patrick Wenzel et al.  also used a NN to predict depth images based on RGB images and implemented three different agents to solve obstacle avoidance in circuit-like environments: a PPO agent with a discrete action set, a PPO agent with a continuous action set and a DQN agent. They concluded that the PPO agent with discrete actions outperformed the other two agents and that depth images yielded better results than RGB and grayscale images. For the goal-oriented navigation task, Xiagang Ruan et al. implemented a D3QN agent that successfully navigates autonomously by using depth images and the distance to the goal as a state. Changan Chen et al.  presented an LSTM network that models Human-Robot and Human-Human interactions, using the DRL framework, for navigation towards a goal in a crowded environment. Yuke Zhu et al.  trained an A3C agent in a self-developed physics engine, which could generalise across targets and scenes. Two RGB images were used for the state representation, one from the agent’s perspective and another that shows the target, and were embedded by a CNN before being passed to the agent. Liulong Ma et al.  compared two DRL agents, DQN for a discrete action space and PPO for a continuous action space, to perform a mapless navigation task by using a Variational Autoencoder to encode RGB images and appending them with target related information. The PPO model outperformed the DQN model in both performance and training time and also got better results in its environment than the benchmark. Cimus Reinis et al.  proposed a DDPG agent that combined a stack of depth images with the polar coordinates between the robot and the goal as the state and with a reward based on the robot’s velocity. They performed successful experiments on simulated environments as well as real-world scenarios. However, other works involve different navigation-related tasks, such as Pararth Shah et al., which combined a DQN agent with a Recurrent Neural Network to map natural language instructions, and visual and depth inputs to actions. Wenhan Luo et al.  developed an A3C agent for a mobile robot, combined with a ConvLSTM NN, that takes RGB frames as inputs and produces both camera control and motion control signals as outputs. Their agent could resume tracking after losing the target and was successfully transferred to real-world scenarios. Placed and Castellanos  developed a D3QN agent capable of performing active SLAM with less intensive computation by using laser measurements and designing the reward function based on a formulation of the active SLAM problem. While most studies specialise in a task and propose a specific reward function and state representation to fulfil it, the work presented analyses the challenge involved in going from a simpler task to a more complex one, as well as the effects the reward function can have on the robot’s behaviour and performance. Also, the popular D3QN algorithm is compared with a more recent variant of the DQN family of methods, the Rainbow algorithm. For a more in-depth review of DRL algorithms and applications in navigation, the surveys of Zhu et al. [ref]52 or Ye et al.  can be consulted. It is noteworthy, as also studied by Zhu et al. in [ref]52, that more often than not DRL applications in navigation require lightweight navigation solutions to be a complete navigation system. As previously discussed, the most common approach to solve the navigation problem is by using a SLAM technique in a map-building-based robotic system. In this work, two different approaches to incorporating a DRL agent in a navigation system are explored. The first one is as an obstacle avoidance agent, which can explore an environment with different obstacles and navigate in circuit-like environments. The second is an agent capable of steering towards a goal when given reference information.\nThe D3QN and Rainbow DQN algorithms are compared to evaluate the difference in results between an algorithm commonly used and its successor. And finally, different reward functions will be implemented in each method to analyse the difference in results and the actions the agents take.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: knowledge about where its goal is located.
