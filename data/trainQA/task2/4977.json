      "content": "Paper Title: Edge Grasp Network: A Graph-Based SE(3)-invariant Approach to Grasp Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGrasp detection [ref]1 [ref]2  is a critical robotic skill. The robot first observes a scene containing objects in the form of images, voxels, or point clouds, and detects a set of viable grasp poses from which an object may be grasped stably. There are two general approaches to grasp detection: SE​(2)SE2\\mathrm{SE}(2) methods where the model reasons in terms of a top-down image of the scene (e.g.     ), and SE​(3)SE3\\mathrm{SE}(3) methods where the model reasons in terms of a point cloud or voxel grid (e.g. [ref]1   [ref]10). SE​(3)SE3\\mathrm{SE}(3) methods have a distinct advantage over SE​(2)SE2\\mathrm{SE}(2) methods because they can find side grasps more easily and they are easier to apply in general robotics settings where only a point cloud is available. Unfortunately, SE​(3)SE3\\mathrm{SE}(3) methods are generally much more complex, so SE​(2)SE2\\mathrm{SE}(2) models are often preferred. This paper tackles the problem of SE​(3)SE3\\mathrm{SE}(3) grasping with a novel grasp detection model that we call the Edge Grasp Network. The model is based on a novel representation of a 6-DoF grasp that uses a pair of vertices in a graph.\nGiven a single approach point (a position the hand will approach), we define a KNN graph that contains all the points in the point cloud that are within a fixed radius of the approach point. Each point in this KNN graph corresponds to an orientation of the gripper and, when paired with the approach point, defines a distinct 6-DOF grasp pose. We infer the quality of all such grasps simultaneously using a graph neural network to compute point features. These are used to compute features on the edges connecting point pairs and ultimately evaluate the probability of grasp success for each grasp candidate associated with the approach point. In order to evaluate the qualities of grasps defined with respect to several approach points in a single forward pass through the model, we can simply form a batch comprised of several individual KNN graphs. This approach is novel relative to the literature in three ways: 1) First, our method of defining unique grasp candidates in terms of a pair of vertices in a graph is new; 2) Second, our inference model using a graph neural network defined with respect to a single approach point is novel; 3) Third, our model is the first SE​(3)SE3\\mathrm{SE}(3) grasp method that incorporates SO​(3)SO3\\mathrm{SO}(3) equivariance. Our approach has several advantages over prior work. First, and perhaps most importantly from a practical perspective, our method works well with single-view point clouds of a scene taken from arbitrary directions. The ability to use a single arbitrary direction is especially relevant because many methods like VGN  or GIGA  are trained specifically for multiple camera views or a particular viewpoint direction\nand do not generalize well to point clouds generated from a novel viewing direction.\nThe consequence is that it is difficult to apply these methods out of the box to practical problems. Another key advantage of our method is that we can easily provide the approximate position of a desired grasp as an input to the model. If we want to grasp a tool by its handle, for example, this is easily achieved by only considering approach positions and contact locations on the handle. Finally, this work goes to great lengths to perform fair comparisons with other grasp detection methods in the literature, both in simulation and on physical systems. The results indicate that our method has better grasp success rates than several strong baselines including VGN , VPN [ref]10, GIGA , and the method of Zhu et al. .\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Grasp detection [ref]1 [ref]2  is a critical robotic skill.
