      "content": "Paper Title: Hypergraph-based Multi-Robot Task and Motion Planning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe use of autonomous robotic systems is rapidly increasing.\nThis can be seen in warehouse management, manufacturing, household chores, health care, etc..\nIn many of these settings, multi-robot systems are leveraged to complete tasks single robots cannot through inter-robot cooperation and increase throughput by working in parallel.\nThese improvements in effectiveness often require complex coordination for both task and motion planning. Unfortunately, the planning space for these problems is very large.\nEven for a single robot, it is intractable in the general case to represent explicitly  , and it grows exponentially for the composite space of multi-robot systems.\nTask and motion planning adds additional dimensions for the tasks present. For simpler problems, decoupling the planning space into individual robot state spaces results in faster planning times.\nHowever, decoupled approaches cannot handle problems which require high levels of coordination.\nThus, existing multi-robot task and motion planning approaches primarily plan in the composite space and cannot efficiently plan for large complex multi-robot systems. Some problems, such as payload transportation, model tasks abstractly and often ignore the physical dimensions of the tasks during planning   .\nOther problems, especially those involving object manipulation, must consider physical constraints   [ref]8 [ref]9 0.\nHere the coordination required limits the use of decoupled methods, and the planning space grows too large to apply composite methods. Hybrid search techniques that balance the strengths and weaknesses of coupled and decoupled approaches have shown promise in recent multi-robot motion planning methods 1 2.\nHowever, before our work, hybrid search techniques were not used for problems requiring more complex coordination such as multi-robot task and motion planning. In this paper, we present the Decomposable State Space Hypergraph (DaSH) method, a general multi-robot planning framework based on a hypergraph representation that can both incorporate existing composite and decoupled multi-robot methods and enable new hybrid methods.\nWe present a novel hybrid search technique based on the DaSH representation which captures the coordination and complexity in multi-robot task and motion planning problems while scaling to larger numbers of robots and tasks.\nAdditionally, our method successfully plans for higher ratios of tasks to robots (10:1) which existing methods such as 0 struggle with. Our approach supports varying levels of (de)coupling of the planning space at different problem stages.\nThe degree of coupling should be tailored to the problem and its corresponding planning space and can change to fit different problem stages.\nWe support this with hybrid composition representations for several planning spaces which capture varying degrees of (de)coupled spaces depending on the coordination required. Take, for example, a multi-manipulator problem involving a handoff between two robots as depicted in Figure 1.\nDifferent levels of coordination are required at different stages of planning.\nRobots operate mostly independently in their individual state spaces.\nThe joint space of a single robot and an object is important while picking/placing the object or while carrying the object,\nand the joint space of both robots and an object is important while planning a handoff between the two robots. These decoupled and hybrid composition representations often remain sparse as the number of robots and tasks (or objects) increase.\nIn contrast, the size of pure composite representations scale exponentially with both the number of robots and tasks.\nA small illustration of the size difference is shown in Fig. 2.\nAs a result, existing methods which plan in the composite space are forced to use implicit representations of the composite space and engineer heuristics which make assumptions about the underlying problem structure.\nOur decoupled and hybrid representations can be explicitly constructed and leveraged into powerful heuristics informed directly by the representation leading to significant performance gains.\n Additionally, prior multi-manipulator methods such as 0 struggle as the number of tasks (or objects) increases relative to the number of robots.\nOur proposed representation flips the scaling paradigm where tasks (or objects) are no longer the limiting factor.\nAs a result, DaSH supports higher ratios of objects to robots which is appropriate for manipulation tasks where a few robots should handle many objects. We demonstrate the ability of the DaSH method to generalize to many multi-robot task and motion planning problems including multi-robot motion planning and multi-manipulator rearrangement.\nFor the rearrangement planning problem, we illustrate how the number of vertices in the hypergraph scales linearly with both the number of robots and objects, while the number of hyperarcs scales quadratically with the number of robots and linearly with the number of objects (Fig. 2) and demonstrate improved planning times on both physical (Fig. 1) and virtual multi-robot systems (Fig. 13a). In summary, our contribution is: A generalized definition of the multi-robot planning space which generalizes composite, decoupled, and hybrid approaches. A novel hypergraph representation for varying coupled/decoupled spaces in multi-robot planning problems. A general planning algorithm that exploits this hypergraph representation. The application of this approach to (i) the multi-robot motion planning space (MRMP-DaSH) and to (ii) the multi-manipulator planning space (MM-DaSH). A theoretical analysis of the size of the proposed hypergraph representation compared to traditional graph representations for multi-manipulator rearrangement problems. An experimental evaluation of the planning algorithm applied to the multi-manipulator rearrangement problem.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: model tasks abstractly and often ignore the physical dimensions of the tasks during planning   .\nOther problems, especially those involving object manipulation, must consider physical constraints   [ref]8 [ref]9 0.\nHere the coordination required limits the use of decoupled methods, and the planning space grows too large to apply composite methods.
