      "content": "Paper Title: HasTEE+: Confidential Cloud Computing and Analytics with Haskell\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConfidential computing  is an emerging security paradigm that ensures the isolation of sensitive computations and data during processing, shielding them from potential threats within the underlying infrastructure.\nIt accomplishes this by employing specialised hardware isolation units known as Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs).\nA TEE unit, such as the Intel SGX  or ARM TrustZone , provides a disjoint region of code and data memory that allows for the physical isolation of a program’s execution and state from the underlying operating system, hypervisor, I/O peripherals, BIOS and other firmware. TEEs further allow a remote party to establish trust by providing a measurement of the sensitive code and data, composing a signed attestation report that can be verified.\nAs such, TEEs have been heralded as a leading contender to enforce a strong notion of trust within cloud computing infrastructure  , particularly in regulated industries such as healthcare, law and finance 2. However, an obstacle in the wide-scale adoption of confidential computing has been the awkward programming model of TEEs 7.\nTEEs, such as Intel SGX, involve partitioning the state of the program into a trusted project linked with Intel-supplied restricted C standard library 9 and an untrusted project that communicates with the trusted project using custom data copying protocols 8.\nThe complexity is compounded for distributed, multi-tiered cloud applications due to the semantic friction in adhering to various data formats and protocols across multiple projects , resulting in increased developer effort . Furthermore, a well-known class of security vulnerabilities  [ref]39 arise from the memory-unsafety of the TEE projects.\nGiven the security-critical nature of TEE applications, efforts have been made to introduce Rust-based 8 and Golang-based SDKs 3 aimed at mitigating memory unsafety vulnerabilities.\nHowever, the same applications remain vulnerable to unintended information leaks . Consider the following trusted function hosted within a TEE: In the above program, at least five attack vectors are present - (1) the inputsize parameter can be abused to cause a buffer-overflow attack, (2) the userinput parameter can be tampered by a malicious operating system to force an incorrect branching, (3) even with the correct inputsize and userInput, the attacker can observe stdout to learn which branch was taken, (4) the trusted library function - computeIdx - could intentionally (if written by a malicious party) or accidentally leak secret, and (5) finally the attacker can use timing-based side channels to learn the branching information or even the secret . Our contribution through this work is – HasTEE+ – a Domain Specific Language (DSL) embedded in Haskell and targeted towards confidential computing.\nHasTEE+ is designed to mitigate at least four of the five attack vectors mentioned above. Additionally, it offers a tierless programming model, thereby simplifying the development of distributed, multi-tiered cloud applications. HasTEE+ builds on the HasTEE  project, which crucially provides a Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) runtime  capable of running Haskell on Intel SGX machines.\nWhile using a memory-safe language like Haskell or Rust mitigates attack vector (1), all the other attack vectors remain open in the HasTEE project.\nHasTEE+ notably adds support for a general one-time-effort remote-attestation infrastructure that helps mitigate the attack vector (2).\nWhile the underlying protocol employs Intel’s RA-TLS , HasTEE+ ensures that programmers are not required to create custom attestation code for capturing and sending measurements or conducting integrity checks . For attack vectors (3) and (4), HasTEE+ adds support for a dynamic information flow control (IFC) mechanism based on the Labeled IO Monad (LIO) 3.\nAccordingly, we adopt a floating-label approach from OSes such as HiStar , enabling HasTEE+ to relax some of the impractical I/O restrictions in the original HasTEE project.\nSide-channel attacks (attack vector (5)) remain outside the scope of HasTEE+. Concerning the complex programming model, modern TEE incarnations like AMD SEV-SNP  and Intel TDX  introduce a virtualization-based solution, opting to virtualize the entire project instead of partitioning it into trusted and untrusted components.\nAt the cost of an increased trusted code base, this approach simplifies the TEE project layout. Nevertheless, it remains vulnerable to the complexities of a multi-tiered cloud application, as well as all five of the aforementioned attack vectors. The tierless programming model of HasTEE+ expresses multi-client-server projects as a single program and uses the Haskell type system to distinguish individual clients.\nA separate monadic type, such as Client \"client1\" a, demarcates each individual client, while HasTEE’s multi-compilation tactic partitions the program.\nThis programming model, evaluated on Intel SGX, remains applicable on newer Intel TDX machines. Contributions. We summarize the key contributions of HasTEE+ here: HasTEE+ introduces a tierless DSL (Section 3.1), capable of expressing multi-tiered confidential computing applications as a single program, increasing an application’s comprehensibility and reducing developer effort. HasTEE+ incorporates a remote attestation design (Section 3.2) that relieves programmers from crafting custom integrity checks and attestation setups. HasTEE+ integrates dynamic information flow control mechanisms (Section 3.3) to prevent explicit and implicit information leaks from applications. We use HasTEE+’s IFC mechanism and cryptography in a data clean room case study (Section 4), showing a general data sharing pattern for conducting analytics on confidential data among mutually distrustful participants.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: semantic friction in adhering to various data formats and protocols across multiple projects , resulting in increased developer effort .
