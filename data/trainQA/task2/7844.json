      "content": "Paper Title: Optimizing Foundation Model Inference on a Many-tiny-core Open-source RISC-V Platform\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile GPUs are still the most commonly used hardware platforms for AI workloads   [ref]34, various companies have designed their specialized accelerators in the last few years    .\nTable I presents an overview of some of the most recent platforms specifically designed for AI training and inference, often focusing on LLMs and FMs. A common denominator of those architectures is the replication of a base compute cluster combining multiple processing elements (PEs) with an L1 cache or SPM via a low-latency interconnect.\nThe replicated clusters are interconnected by a latency-tolerant global Network-on-Chip (NoC) and rely either entirely on external main memory or on some distributed on-chip cluster memories. For example, Nvidia’s A100  groups multiple Texture Processing Clusters with 108 streaming multiprocessors (SMs) into GPU Processing Clusters.\nEach SM combines four warps with an L1-data cache and a shared memory of 164 kBtimes164kilobyte164\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{kB}, whereas each warp combines a tensor core, 16 INT32 and FP32 cores, and eight FP64 cores with a shared 64 kBtimes64kilobyte64\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{kB} register file.\nThe tensor core supports FP16, BF16, FP32, FP64, INT8, INT4, and binary formats, and its 32-thread granularity enables 256 FP16/FP32 fused multiply-accumulate (FMA) operations per cycle, corresponding to the computation of an 8×\\times4×\\times8 mixed-precision matrix multiplication. The H100  GPU doubles the HBM memory of the A100 and increases the number of total cores from 6912 to 16896, and introduces support for FP8FP8\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{8}. Further, it includes a Transformer Engine (TE) optimized for handling multi-trillion parameter models, significantly enhancing performance for FMs. The engine supports Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP), which dynamically adjusts the precision of computations during training and inference. Additionally, the TE supports fused operations, combining multiple computational steps into a single kernel. The architecture of the TE is designed to scale efficiently across multiple GPUs, allowing for parallel training and inference of large models, further reducing training times. This scalability is complemented by an advanced software stack optimized for transformer workloads, including libraries like NVIDIA CUDA, cuBLAS, and cuDNN. SambaNova DataScale SN30  uses second-generation Reconfigurable Dataflow Units (RDU) as PEs. It uses a 7 nmtimes7nanometer7\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{nm} process node and supports BF16BF16\\mathrm{B}\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{1}\\mathrm{6} and FP32FP32\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{3}\\mathrm{2} data formats.\nCerebras has scaled its accelerator architecture to a wafer-sized chip called wafer-scale engine (WSE) .\nThe second generation, WSE-2, with 46 000 mm2times46000millimeter246\\,000\\text{\\,}{\\mathrm{mm}}^{2}, is the largest processor ever built and combines 850k AI cores with a wafer-scale high-bandwidth, low-latency fabric arranged in a 2D mesh.\nEach general-purpose core combines four 16-bit fused multiply-accumulate (FMAC) units, 8×\\times 6 kBtimes6kilobyte6\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{kB} static random-access memory (SRAM) banks (total 48 kBtimes48kilobyte48\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{kB}), and 256 Btimes256byte256\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{B} of software-managed cache for often accessed data structures such as accumulators. GROQ’s Language Processing Unit (LPU) architecture , taped out in 14 nmtimes14nanometer14\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{nm}, employs a linear array of tensor streaming processing elements (TSPEs) interleaved with memory units. It is designed for deterministic performance and elimitates control flow variability to maximize data throughput. The LPU supports FP32FP32\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{3}\\mathrm{2}, FP16FP16\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{1}\\mathrm{6}, and INT8. Each LPU comprises 220 MBtimes220megabyte220\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{MB} of on-chip SRAM, divided across superlanes, enabling high performance without the need for external DRAM. The LPU can compute more than 400000 integer multiply–accumulate (MAC) operations per cycle, achieving up to 1000 TOPS. By having the compiler explicitly control all aspects of program execution, including instruction scheduling, data movement, and resource management, runtime variability is eliminated. The Habana Gaudi2  processor features\ntwo Matrix Multiplication Engines (MME), 24 Tensor Processor Cores (TPCs), and 96 GBtimes96gigabyte96\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{GB} of HBM, providing a robust platform for efficient scale training. It supports FP8FP8\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{8}, FP16FP16\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{1}\\mathrm{6}, and FP32FP32\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{3}\\mathrm{2} data formats.\nLastly, the AMD MI250 [ref]34 utilizes a 6 nmtimes6nanometer6\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{nm} process with 128 GBtimes128gigabyte128\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{GB} of HBM2e, focused on high bandwidth and large buffer capacities essential for handling large datasets efficiently. It supports FP16FP16\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{1}\\mathrm{6}, FP32FP32\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{3}\\mathrm{2}, and FP64FP64\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{6}\\mathrm{4}, together with low-precision integer formats, aligning with the needs of diverse AI training and inference workloads. In contrast to large industrial products, academic research has focused on smaller-scale hardware and models, investigating specific optimizations.\nFor instance, AccelTran  focuses on sparse transformers, using a dynamic inference scheme to prune activations at runtime.\nIn most academic works     , the authors primarily focus on specific hardware optimizations to support different integer quantization schemes that can limit the applicability to high-accurate LLMs.\nAdditionally, they propose architectures tailored to specific models, such as fusions between Transformers and DNNs or Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) .\nTambe et al.  are the only ones employing floating point data types. However, the authors combine floating-point with a series of other software optimizations that could limit the utilization of their work for huge LLMs. These optimizations include token entropy-based early exit, Mixed-Precision (MP) (FP4/FP8) prediction, and sparsity.\nUntil now, no open-source general-purpose academic hardware platforms have demonstrated end-to-end execution of widespread foundation models like GPT and ViT. To fill this gap, in this work, we explore an open-source, scalable architecture comprising a hierarchical grouping of four RISC-V multi-core Snitch compute clusters , achieving an inter-cluster bandwidth of 64B/cycle while sharing 64B/cycle bandwidth to another hierarchy stage of cluster grouping. We exploit on-chip interconnect to enable flexible cluster-to-cluster direct communication without passing through main memory. This capability is not fully supported even in the most advanced commercial platforms, where direct on-chip communication is either restricted to a very rigid dataflow (e.g., Groq ) or limited to an expensive shuffle (e.g., in NVIDIA H100 [ref]12).\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: While GPUs are still the most commonly used hardware platforms for AI workloads   [ref]34, various companies have designed their specialized accelerators in the last few years    .\nTable I presents an overview of some of the most recent platforms specifically designed for AI\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
