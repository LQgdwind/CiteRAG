      "content": "Paper Title: YaRN: Efficient Context Window Extension of Large Language Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo evaluate the long sequence language modeling performances, we use the GovReport¬† and Proof-pile¬†[ref]4 datasets both of which contain many long sequence samples.\nFor all evaluations, the test splits of both datasets were used exclusively.\nAll perplexity evaluations were calculated using the sliding window method from¬†Press et¬†al.  with S=256ùëÜ256S=256. Firstly, we evaluated how the model performed as the context window increased. We selected 10 random samples from Proof-pile with at least 128k tokens each and evaluated the perplexity of each of these samples when truncated at 2k steps from a sequence length of 2k tokens through 128k tokens. Table¬†1 shows a side-by-side comparison of Llama-2 model extended from 409640964096 to 819281928192 context length via PI (LLongMA-2 7b222LLongMA-2 7b¬†[ref]28 is fine-tuned from Llama-2 7b, trained at 8k context length with PI using the RedPajama dataset¬†[ref]12. ), \"NTK-aware\" and YaRN. Note that PI and \"NTK-aware\" models were trained using the methodology in¬†Chen et¬†al. , while YaRN used the same methodology but 2.5x less training steps and data, as described in¬†4. We further evaluated YaRN at the scale factor s=16,32ùë†1632s=16,32 and compared them against a few open-source models fine-tuned from Llama-2 and extended to more than 32k context window such as Together.ai¬† and \"NTK-aware\" Code Llama¬†.\nThe results are summarized in Table¬†2 (with a more detailed plot in Figure¬†1). We observe that the model exhibits strong performance across the entire targeted context size, with YaRN interpolation being the first method to successfully extend the effective context size of Llama 2 to 128k.\nOf particular note are the YaRN (s=32ùë†32s=32) models, which show continued declining perplexity through 128k, despite the fine-tuning data being limited to 64k tokens in length, demonstrating that the model is able to generalize to unseen context lengths. Furthermore, in Appendix¬†B.1, we show the results of the average perplexity on 50 untruncated GovReport documents with at least 16k tokens per sample evaluated on the setting of 32k maximal context window without Dynamic Scaling in Table¬†4. Similar to the Proof-pile results, the GovReport results show that fine-tuning with YaRN achieves good performance on long sequences.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: To evaluate the long sequence language modeling performances, we use the GovReport¬† and Proof-pile¬†[ref]4 datasets both of which contain many long sequence samples.\nFor all evaluations, the test splits of both datasets were used exclusively.\nAll perplexity evaluations were calculated using the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
