      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-fold Correlation Attention Network for Predicting Traffic Speeds with Heterogeneous Frequency\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDifferent taxonomies have been utilized to review the existing methods, i.e., parametric approach and nonparametric approach ; statistically based methods, machine learning methods, and hybrid methods .\nSince most of the recent works rely on deep learning-based methods (including our work), in this paper, we divided related works into two categories [ref]14: traditional shallow prediction models and deep learning-based prediction models. 1) Traditional shallow prediction models indicate traditional methods that are relatively simple and shallow in the model structure.\nReported methods in this category include Time Series Analysis (e.g. Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) [ref]15), Kalman Filters (KF) , K-nearest neighbor (KNN) based methods  , Support Vector Machine (SVM) , Markov models 8, Tensor decomposition based methods , Gaussian Processe (GP) approaches , Random Forest (RF) methods , and shallow neural network (NN) 9. The above methods are often considered shallow prediction methods, as their model structures are simple and typically requires the developer to have some prior knowledge regarding the data distribution (e.g., ARIMA, KF, KNN, Markov, GP) or to design effective features for training the prediction models (e.g., SVM, GP, RF, shallow NN). This is in contrast to the deep learning methods, where one can supply fairly raw formats of data into the learning system, and the system can automatically learn feature representations regarding local and global relationships or structures in the data.\nIn addition, existing works have shown that the traffic speed series have inherent temporal patterns (e.g., daily and weekly periodicity)  and spatial dependencies (i.e., traffic states in nearby regions are correlated with each other) . However, the traditional shallow methods have difficulty in incorporating such temporal and/or spatial correlations, which are critical for producing prominent performance.\nAs such, the existing shallow prediction methods typically failed to produce satisfying results for the challenging short-term traffic prediction. 2) Deep learning-based methods provide a promising way to capture nonlinear temporal and spatial correlations for traffic prediction.\nTraffic speed typically repeats periodically 7, meaning that the traffic speed at a certain period is similar to the same time period of the previous day or previous week (i.e., temporal correlation).\nAs such, many existing works relied on recurrent neural networks (e.g., LSTM)  to incorporate the effect of temporal correlation.\nIn fact, severe fluctuations were observed from the daily and weekly repeatability patterns due to dynamic traffic situations and uncertainties.\nA periodically shifted attention mechanism is developed in [ref]46 to handle the long-term periodic temporal shifting.\nIn addition, some works also adopted the core idea of multi-fold temporal correlations for traffic prediction problems. For example, the daily and weekly periodicity are jointly considered for traffic prediction on grid network [ref]46, and multi-resolution temporal correlations are adopted for traffic prediction on graph network .\nHowever, these works incorporate multiple temporal correlations but fail to simultaneously model the multi-fold spatial correlations of traffic data. To take into account the spatial correlations, many Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based methods   have been developed for traffic prediction problems by aggregating correlated neighborhood information (nearby road segments or regions).\nHowever, the methods are restricted to grid networks or ring road networks where each road segment has a fixed number of upstream and downstream road segments.\nAs graph structure provides a natural representation of the traffic network, graph embedding techniques were developed to capture local-spatial correlations by aggregating the neighborhood information of nearby regions .\nGraph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) 5 is an appealing choice for modeling spatial correlation among graph-structured traffic data and has been proven to be very efficient for short-term traffic prediction .\nEarlier studies \non traffic prediction with GCNN typically consider only static spatial dependencies, and the dynamic spatial dependencies were considered in the subsequent works to take into account gradual structural evolution of the road network .\nSpectral-based GCNN methods explore an analogical convolution operator over non-Euclidean domains on the basis of the spectral graph theory ,\nwhile the spatial-based GCNN methods always analogize the convolutional strategy based on the local spatial filtering\n. The existing methods typically considered a single type of spatial correlation and neglect the fact that the spatial correlations among the locations/roadways are diverse depending on their geographic attributes and traffic patterns. The core idea of multi-fold spatial correlations bears some similarity with the concept of multi-view spatial correlations  or diverse spatial correlations 6.\nThe work in  proposed a spatiotemporal multi-graph convolution network (ST-MGCN) for ride-hailing demand forecasting.\nST-MGCN considered multi-view spatial correlations including\nnot only the correlations among spatially adjacent regions but also the pair-wise correlations among distant regions using multi-graph convolution.\nThe work in 6 proposed a deep-meta-learning-based model (entitled ST-MetaNet) for predicting traffic conditions at all locations of an urban area.\nST-MetaNet incorporated diverse types of spatiotemporal correlations by considering two types of geo-graph attributes 1) node attributes: the surrounding environment of a location, namely, nearby points of interests (POIs) and the density of road networks (RNs); 2) edge attributes: the relationship between two nodes, such as the connectivity of roads and the distance between them.\nAlthough the above works considered multiple types of spatial correlations, our multi-fold spatial correlations are inherently different from the existing ones.\nSpecifically, the existing works considered the correlations between the target roadway/location and multiple geographic components (e.g., location, region, points of interest (POIs), roadways, etc.), which are of different types. The correlation strength between two geographic components is characterized using a single measurement (e.g., traffic speed, network connectivity, etc.).\nBased on the dynamic situations, their prediction models selectively pay different attention to different correlations, which correspond to different geographic components.\nIn this paper, we observe that the correlation between two roadway segments can be characterized by multiple measurements (e.g., traffic speed, speed changing trend, etc.), entitled as multi-fold correlations.\nThe correlations based on different measurements have different patterns, and alternatively show the strongest correlation scores across various traffic situations. This means that, incorporating the multi-fold correlations relying on multiple measurements can better characterize the relationship between two roadways.\nMore detailed discussion regarding the multi-fold spatial correlations will be presented in Section 4.2. In addition, the existing traffic prediction methods have largely neglected the heterogeneous frequencies over the temporal dimension of traffic data.\nThe work in  is the first one that considered data recorded at irregular time intervals, which would allow transportation management systems to be able to predict traffic speed based on intermittent data sources. The study adapted 3 existing parametric prediction methods (i.e., Naive Method, Simple Exponential Smoothing Method, and Wright’s Modification of Holt’s Method) to enable them to process irregular data through some transformations (i.e., treating a exponentially smoothing as exponentially weighting process and eliminating the weights corresponding to missing data interval).\nHowever, this method needs to customize the transformation operations for dealing with irregular time intervals for each of the three prediction models separately.\nAlso, it failed to incorporate spatial and temporal correlations among roadways, which are critical for prediction performance.\nAnother work 7 also considered heterogeneous frequency in traffic flow prediction, by dynamically filtering the inputs through Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) on traffic flow data.\nWith the filtered tensors, a 3D convolutional network is designed to extract the spatiotemporal features automatically, and several kernels with various sizes on the temporal dimension are employed to model the temporal correlations with multi-scale frequencies.\nHowever, this method is limited to apply to grid-based traffic data and is only evaluated for coarse-grained data in both spatial (e.g., 1km ×\\times 1km) and temporal (15 minutes to 1 hour) dimensions.\nDifferent from the existing works, in this paper, we aim to develop an efficient method to process heterogeneous time-frequency traffic data on fine-grained urban transport network while sufficiently incorporating spatiotemporal correlations.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: machine learning methods, and hybrid methods .\nSince most of the recent works rely on deep learning-based methods (including our work), in this paper, we divided related works into two categories [ref]14: traditional shallow prediction models and deep learning-based prediction models. 1) Traditional shallow prediction models indicate traditional methods that are relatively simple and shallow\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
