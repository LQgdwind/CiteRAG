      "content": "Paper Title: Meta-Learning Adversarial Bandit Algorithms\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile we are the first to consider meta-learning under adversarial bandit feedback, many have studied meta-learning in various stochastic bandit settings   7      0.\nThe latter three study stochastic bandits under various task-generation assumptions, e.g. Azizi et al. 0 is in a batch-within-online setting where the optimal arms are adversarial.\nIn contrast, we make no distributional assumptions either within or without.\nApart from this difference, the results of Azizi et al. 0 are the ones our MAB results are most easily compared to, which we do in detail in Section 3.\nNotably, they assume that only s≪dmuch-less-than𝑠𝑑s\\ll d of the d𝑑d arms are ever optimal across T𝑇T tasks and show (roughly speaking) 𝒪~​(s​m)~𝒪𝑠𝑚\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{sm}) asymptotic regret;\nwe instead focus on an entropic notion of task-similarity that achieves the same asymptotic regret when specialized to their s≪dmuch-less-than𝑠𝑑s\\ll d.\nHowever, avoiding their explicit assumption has certain advantages, e.g. robustness in the presence of o​(T)𝑜𝑇o(T) outlier tasks (c.f. Section 3.3). A setting that bears some similarity to online-within-online bandits is that of switching bandits , and more generally online learning with dynamic comparators     .\nIn such problems, instead of using a static best arm as the comparator we use a piecewise constant sequence of arms, with a limited number of arm switches.\nThe key difference between such work and ours is our assumption that task-boundaries are known;\nthis makes the other setting more general.\nHowever, while e.g. Exp3.S  can indeed be applied to online meta-learning, guarantees derived from switching costs cannot improve upon just running Tsallis-INF on each task [39, Table 1].\nFurthermore, these approaches usually quantify difficulty by the number of switches, whereas we focus on task-similarity.\nWhile there exists stochastic-setting work that measures difficulty using a notion of average change in distribution across rounds , it does not lead to improved performance if this average change is Ω​(T)Ω𝑇\\Omega(T), as is the case in e.g. the s𝑠s-sparse setting discussed above. There has been a variety of work on full-information online-within-online meta-learning  , including tuning OMD [ref]31 .\nDoing so for bandit algorithms has many additional challenges, including (1) their inherent and high-variance stochasticity, (2) the use of non-Lipschitz and even unbounded regularizers, and (3) the lack of access to task-optima in order to adapt to deterministic, algorithm-independent task-similarity measures.\nTheoretically our analysis draws on the average regret-upper-bound analysis (ARUBA) framework [ref]31, which observes that OMD can be tuned by targeting its upper bounds, which are affine functions of Bregman divergences, and provide online learning tools for doing so.\nOur core structural result shows that the distance generating functions ψθsubscript𝜓𝜃\\psi_{\\theta} of these Bregman divergences can be tuned without interfering with meta-learning the initialization and step-size;\ntuning θ𝜃\\theta is critical for adapting to settings such as that of a small set of optimal arms in MAB.\nDoing so depends on several refinements of the original approach, including bounding the task-averaged-regret via the spectral norm of ∇2ψθsuperscript∇2subscript𝜓𝜃\\nabla^{2}\\psi_{\\theta} and expressing the loss of the meta-comparator using only ψθsubscript𝜓𝜃\\psi_{\\theta}, rather than via its Bregman divergence as in prior work.\nFinally, applying our structural result requires setting-specific analysis, e.g. to show regularity w.r.t. θ𝜃\\theta or to obtain MAB guarantees in terms of the entropy of the true optimal arms.\nThe latter is especially difficult, as Khodak et al. [ref]31 define task-similarity via full information upper bounds, and involves applying tools from the best-arm-identification literature  to show that a constrained variant of Exp3 finds the optimal arm w.h.p.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: is Ω​(T)Ω𝑇\\Omega(T), as is the case in e.g. the s𝑠s-sparse setting discussed above.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
