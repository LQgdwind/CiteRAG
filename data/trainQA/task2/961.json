      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Sampling from Feasible Sets of SDPs and Volume Approximation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSampling convex sets via random walks has attracted a lot of interest in the last\ndecades. Most of the works assume that the convex sets are polytopes;\n provides an overview of the state-of-the-art. Random walks on\nspectrahedra are studied in¬† , where\nthey exploit the W-HnR¬†and the computation of the intersection of the\nwalk with the boundary reduces to a generalized eigenvalue¬†problem. The W-Billard¬† is a general way of\nsampling in convex or non-convex shapes from the uniform distribution. A\nmathematical billiard consists of a domain ùíüùíü\\mathcal{D} and a\npoint-mass, moving freely in ùíüùíü\\mathcal{D}\n. When this point-mass hits the\nboundary, it performs a specular reflection, albeit without losing\nvelocity. An application of billiards is the study of optical\nproperties of conics [52, Section¬†4]. If the trajectory is not a line, but rather a parametric curve,\nthen the intersection operation reduces to solving a polynomial eigenvalue problem (PEP);\nW-HMC-r¬†requires this operation.\nPEP is a well-studied problem in computational mathematics, e.g.,\n[ref]54, and it appears in many applications.\nThere are important results both for the perturbation analysis of PEP\n[ref]54  ,\nas well as for the\ncondition-based analysis of algorithms for the real and complex versions of PEP,\nif we assume random inputs\n . For the closely related problem of volume computation, there is also an\nextensive bibliography¬†. The bulk of the theoretical\nstudies are either for general convex bodies¬†0  or polytopes¬†5.\nPractical algorithms and implementations exist only for polytopes¬†1 .\nNevertheless, there are notable exceptions that consider algorithms\nfor computing the volume of compact (basic) semi-algebraic sets. For\nexample, in 1 they exploit the periods of rational\nintegrals. In the same setting,\n0 6 introduce numerical\napproximation schemes for volume computations, which rely on the\nmoment-based algorithms and semi-definite programming. Finally, sampling from a multivariate distribution is a central\nproblem in numerous applications. For example, it is useful in robust\ncontrol analysis  [ref]11  to overcome\nthe worst case hardness as well as in integration¬†9 and\nconvex optimization\n 7.\n\nReference markers found: [54]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]54: curve,\nthen the intersection operation reduces to solving a polynomial eigenvalue problem (PEP);\nW-HMC-r¬†requires this operation.\nPEP is a well-studied problem in computational mathematics, e.g.,\n[ref]54, and it appears in many applications.\nThere are important results both for the perturbation analysis of PEP\n[ref]54  ,\nas well as for the\ncondition-based analysis of algorithms for the real\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
