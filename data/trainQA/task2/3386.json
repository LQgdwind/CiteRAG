Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Grad2Task: Improved Few-shot Text Classification Using Gradients for Task Representation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe use datasets for training and testing that have different input domains and different numbers of labels. Each dataset appears during either training or testing ‚Äì not both.\nFollowing¬†, we use tasks from the GLUE benchmark¬†2 for training. Specifically, we use WNLI (m/mm), SST-2, QQP, RTE, MRPC, QNLI, and the SNLI dataset¬†[ref]10, to which we refer as our ‚Äòmeta-training datasets‚Äô. The validation set of each dataset is used for hyperparameter searching and model selection.\nWe train our model and other meta-learning models by sampling episodes from the meta-training tasks. The sampling process first selects a dataset and then randomly selects kùëòk-shot examples for each class as the support set and another kùëòk-shot as the query set. As with¬†Bansal et¬†al. , the probability of a task being selected is proportional to the square root of its dataset size. We use the same test datasets as¬†Bansal et¬†al. , but also add several new datasets to increase task diversity, namely the Yelp¬†[ref]1 dataset to predict review stars, the SNIPS dataset¬† for intent detection, and the HuffPost¬† dataset for news headline classification. We refer to this set of tasks as our ‚Äòmeta-testing datasets‚Äô.\nFor each test task and a specific number of shot kùëòk, ten kùëòk-shot datasets are randomly sampled. Each time one of the ten datasets is given for model training or fine-tuning, the model is then tested on the full test dataset of the corresponding task.\nThis is in line with real world applications where models built on a small training set are tested on the full test set. Several test datasets used by¬†Bansal et¬†al.  contain very long sentences, but they limited the maximal sequence length to 128 tokens in their experiments. Truncating long sequences beyond the maximal length might lose important information for text classification, leading to noise in the test results.\nIn order to ensure the results can truly reflect text classification, we discard a few datasets used by¬†Bansal et¬†al.  that contain many very long sentences. See Appendix¬†C for more details about the datasets we use. See Appendix¬†G.1 for the results on all datasets used by¬†Bansal et¬†al. .\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: during either training or testing ‚Äì not both.\nFollowing¬†, we use tasks from the GLUE benchmark¬†2 for training. Specifically, we use WNLI (m/mm), SST-2, QQP, RTE, MRPC, QNLI, and the SNLI dataset¬†[ref]10, to which we refer as our ‚Äòmeta-training datasets‚Äô.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
