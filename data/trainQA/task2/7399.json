A label correlation-aware feature extraction method for MLL is proposed in . A graph neural network for MLL is proposed in [ref]29. Several other approaches for MLL have been documented in . However, these approaches assume the availability of a fixed set of samples and labels. Hence, these may not be suitable for learning from a data stream. Continual learning from multi-class data has been extensively studied in the literature. The methods are usually categorized into three types - memory-based, regularization-based, and architecture-based [ref]1. Memory-based methods avoid catastrophic forgetting by replaying samples stored from previous tasks [ref]30. Regularization-based methods penalize the updates of different parameters differently based on their importance to the current task . Architecture-based methods grow the model size to fit new tasks or assign task-wise parameters using masks . More details are provided in [ref]1. Multi-label datasets usually have more imbalance, and it is possible to find samples with no labels and particular label combinations with no associated samples  . As most memory-based methods rely on sampling the old task data, they might not capture these scenarios applicable to CMLL. Hence, architecture and regularization-based methods must be developed for CMLL. Recent studies have emphasized CMLL, showcasing methods like deep streaming label learning (DSLL)  and continual interactive feature distillation (CIFDM) . CIFDM learns from a stream of samples with continuously emerging labels  closely resembling real-world scenarios than DSLL, which maps a fixed set of samples to multiple evolving labels. The CMLL setting presented in CIFDM contains samples with all positive or negative labels, hindering model learning. A bipolar network architecture is proposed in  to address this issue. However, the loss functions proposed therein do not distinguish between samples based on the model‚Äôs ability to classify them. Incorporating classification confidence-based measures into the loss function improves the model‚Äôs robustness to data imbalance . Such loss functions are not yet available for bipolar architectures. This work fills this gap by proposing an imbalance-sensitive loss function (‚Ñíf‚Äãm‚Äãmsubscript‚Ñíùëìùëöùëö\\mathcal{L}_{fmm}) for improved continual multi-label classification with DOSA.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: label correlations to improve the multi-label classification performance  .
