      "content": "Paper Title: \"A\"²⁢\"CiD\"²: Accelerating Asynchronous Communication in Decentralized Deep Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTwo paradigms allow to maintain high-parallelization. On one side, model-parallelism  , which splits a neural network on independent machines, allowing to use local learning methods  . On the other hand data-parallelism, which accelerates learning by making use of larger mini-batch splitted across multiple nodes 8 to maximally use GPU capacities. This parallelization entailing the use of larger batch-sizes, it requires an important process of adapting hyper-parameters [ref]16, and in particular the learning rate scheduler. Developed for this setting, methods such as [ref]16 6 allow to stabilize training while maintaining good generalization performances. However, they have been introduced in the context of centralized synchronous training using All-Reduce schemes for communication, which still is the default setting of many approaches to data parallelism. The pioneer work  is one of the first study to suggest the potential superiority of synchronous decentralized training strategies in practice. In terms of implementation in the cluster setting, decentralized frameworks have been shown to achieve higher throughput than optimized All-Reduce strategies 5 8. From the theoretical side,  propose a framework covering many settings of synchronous decentralized learning. However, as it consistently relies on using a global discrete iterations count, the notion of time is more difficult to exploit, which reveals crucial in our setting. Furthermore, no communication acceleration is incorporated in these algorithms.  provides a comprehensive methodology to relate the consensus distance, i.e. the average distance of the local parameters to the global average, to a necessary communication rate to avoid degrading performance and could be easily applied to our method.  is a method focusing on improving performance via a discrete momentum modification, which indicates momentum variables are key to decentralized DL. There exist many attempts to incorporate asynchrony in decentralized training 8   8 , which typically aim at removing lock barriers of synchronous decentralized algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, none of them introduce communication acceleration, yet they could be simply combined with our approach. Although recent approaches such as  8 perform peer-to-peer averaging of parameters instead of gradients, thus allowing to communicate in parallel of computing (as there is no need to wait for the gradients before communicating), they are still coupled: parameter updates resulting from computations and communications are scheduled in a specific order, limiting their speed. Furthermore, in practice, both those works only implement a periodic averaging on the exponential graph (more favorable, see 3) instead of investigating the influence of the graph’s topology on the convergence of a randomized gossip method, as we do. In fact, AD-PSGD 8, the baseline algorithm in asynchronous decentralized DL, comes with a major caveat to avoid deadlocks in practice: they require a bipartite graph and schedule p2p communications in a pseudo-random manner instead of basing the decision on worker’s current availability, hindering the advantage given by asynchronous methods in the mitigation of stragglers. Contrary to them, our implementation allows to pair workers in real time based on their availability, minimizing idle time for communications. Reducing communication overhead is an important topic for scalability 6. For instance,  0 allow to use of compression factor in limited bandwidth setting, and the local SGD communication schedule of 0 is shown to be beneficial. Those methods could be independently and simply combined with ours to potentially benefit from an additional communication acceleration. By leveraging key properties of the resistance of the communication network ,  showed that standard asynchronous gossip  can be accelerated, even to give efficient primal algorithms in the convex setting 4. However, this acceleration has never been deployed in the DL context, until now. RelaySum 1 is an approach which allow to average exactly parameters produced by different time steps and thus potentially delayed. However, it requires either to use a tree graph topology, either to build ad-hoc spanning trees and has inherent synchronous locks as it averages neighbor messages in a specific order.
