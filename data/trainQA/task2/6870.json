      "content": "Paper Title: BaDExpert: Extracting Backdoor Functionality for Accurate Backdoor Input Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA prominent security concern of deep neural networks (DNNs) is the threat of backdoor attacks  , wherein an adversary embeds hidden behaviors (backdoors) into a model through techniques such as data poisoning [ref]3 or weights tampering . During inference, such a backdoor remains dormant when processing benign inputs but can be activated by trigger-planted backdoor samples devised by attackers. Upon activation, the compromised model produces anomalous outputs, which could lead to severe security breaches. The existing literature has extensively explored defensive strategies against backdoor attacks, with a significant focus on development-stage defenses [ref]5 [ref]6  . These defenses are operated before and during the model training process, primarily targeting data-poisoning-based attacks [ref]3. In this work, we rather focus on post-development defenses that operate after the model development  0 1 2. Given an arbitrary model that may potentially be backdoored, post-development defenses tackle the challenge of secure deployment head-on, without knowing how the model was generated. Implementing such defenses faces non-trivial technical challenges. From a methodological point of view, these defenses do not have access to the training dataset or information about training dynamics (such as gradient updates or loss information) and thus forfeit rich information that could aid in system defense. For example, approaches that directly analyze poisoned datasets [ref]5  or the backdoor training dynamics [ref]6  cannot be applied. One recognized paradigm 3  4 for addressing post-development defenses aim to infer backdoor trigger patterns through the direct reverse-engineering of the compromised model without requiring knowledge about how the model was generated, and then neutralize the backdoor with the reconstructed triggers.\nHowever, these methods usually require strong assumptions on the trigger types to formulate the trigger-space optimization problem.\nAnd in cases where the trigger is based on global transformation 5 6, these methods frequently fail due to the mismatch of the assumed trigger pattern and the actual underlying trigger in practice.\nOur work advocates an alternative perspective by extracting the backdoor functionality (Fig 1) instead of the backdoor trigger pattern and, therefore, avoids the imposition of inductive biases on trigger types.\nOur key contributions can be summarized as: We introduce a novel approach that directly extracts the backdoor functionality to a backdoor expert model (Fig 1), as opposed to extracting backdoor triggers.\nOur approach relies on a remarkably straightforward technique: a gentle finetuning on a small set of deliberately mislabeled clean samples.\nThe reasoning behind this technique lies in an intriguing characteristic of backdoored models (Fig 3): finetuning a backdoored model on mislabeled clean samples causes the model to lose its normal functionality (low clean accuracy), but remarkably, its backdoor functionality remains intact (high attack success rate).\nWe also show this observation is pervasive across attacks, datasets and model architectures (Fig 8). We show that the resultant backdoor expert model can be subsequently utilized to shield the original model from backdoor attacks. Particularly, we demonstrate that it is feasible to devise a highly accurate backdoor input filter using the extracted backdoor expert model, of which the high-level intuition is illustrated in Fig 2.\nIn practice, the efficacy of this approach is further amplified by a more fine-grained design with an ensembling strategy (see Sec 3). We design a comprehensive defense pipeline, backdoor input detection with backdoor expert (dubbed BaDExpert), capable of mitigating a diverse set of existing backdoor attacks (12 types), at the cost of only negligible clean accuracy drop.\nBaDExpert also shows better performance (higher AUROC) compared to other backdoor input detectors. Our extensive experiments on both small-scale (CIFAR10, GTSRB) and large-scale (ImageNet) datasets with different model architecture choices (ResNet, VGG, MobileNet and Vision Transformer) validate the consistent effectiveness of BaDExpert.\nIn addition, BaDExpert demonstrates considerable resilience against 7 types of adaptive attacks.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: security concern of deep neural networks (DNNs) is the threat of backdoor attacks  , wherein an adversary embeds hidden behaviors (backdoors) into a model through techniques such as data poisoning [ref]3 or weights tampering .
