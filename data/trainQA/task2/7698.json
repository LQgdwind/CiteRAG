      "content": "Paper Title: Geometric planted matchings beyond the Gaussian model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe study the geometric planted matching model introduced by D. Kunisky and J. Niles-Weed in . Given n,d∈ℕ𝑛𝑑ℕn,d\\in\\mathbb{N}, we generate a sequence X1,…,Xnsubscript𝑋1…subscript𝑋𝑛X_{1},\\dots,X_{n} of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random positions in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d} and independently a sequence of i.i.d. random perturbations Z1,…,Znsubscript𝑍1…subscript𝑍𝑛Z_{1},\\dots,Z_{n}, from which we derive, a sequence of perturbed versions of the original points with the label information hidden by an unknown random permutation π⋆∼Unif​(Sn)similar-tosuperscript𝜋⋆Unifsubscript𝑆𝑛\\pi^{\\star}\\sim\\text{Unif}(S_{n}).\nThe goal is to recover π⋆superscript𝜋⋆\\pi^{\\star} given direct observation of X1,…,Xnsubscript𝑋1…subscript𝑋𝑛X_{1},\\dots,X_{n} and Y1,…,Ynsubscript𝑌1…subscript𝑌𝑛Y_{1},\\dots,Y_{n}. We can interpret {X1,…,Xn}subscript𝑋1…subscript𝑋𝑛\\{X_{1},\\dots,X_{n}\\} and {Y1,…,Yn}subscript𝑌1…subscript𝑌𝑛\\{Y_{1},\\dots,Y_{n}\\} as being snapshots at different times of the positions of n𝑛n particles performing some form of random motion in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}. Based on these snapshots we would like to track each particle’s trajectory. This is a natural problem that arises in the life sciences    in the context of analyzing single-cell dynamics, and in the physical sciences [ref]12 in problems involving fluid dynamics. This model also makes sense for growing d𝑑d. For instance, if we imagine that the Xisubscript𝑋𝑖X_{i}’s are high-dimensional feature vectors, and the Yisubscript𝑌𝑖Y_{i}’s are noisy versions of the Xisubscript𝑋𝑖X_{i}’s, then estimating π∗superscript𝜋\\pi^{*} is a toy model for entity resolution or deduplication . Under the assumption that Xi∼𝒩​(0,Id)similar-tosubscript𝑋𝑖𝒩0subscript𝐼𝑑X_{i}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,I_{d}) and Zi∼𝒩​(0,σ2​Id)similar-tosubscript𝑍𝑖𝒩0superscript𝜎2subscript𝐼𝑑Z_{i}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^{2}I_{d}),  established sufficient and necessary conditions on σ2superscript𝜎2\\sigma^{2} for the number of mistakes made by the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) to be 00 or o​(n)𝑜𝑛o(n) with high-probability for different regimes of d𝑑d. Under the same Gaussian model,  showed that some of these conditions are information theoretical optimal. In  and  information-theoretical limits were also established under different models for database matching with Gaussian assumptions. Another line of research, tracing back to , considers the problem of recovering planted matchings in weighted bipartite graphs without a latent geometric structure. In that case, more general results are available   . In this work we consider the geometric planted matching problem following (1.1) for broader classes of distributions for Xisubscript𝑋𝑖X_{i} and Zisubscript𝑍𝑖Z_{i}. In this more general setting, we obtain a general lower bound on the expected number of mistakes made by any estimator. Our proof is based on a simple argument involving matchings in random geometric graphs. The same strategy can also be used to establish negative results similar to the ones in  and . We showcase some consequences for the regime when d=Θ​(1)𝑑Θ1d=\\Theta(1) and d=o​(log⁡n)𝑑𝑜𝑛d=o(\\log n) providing natural scenarios where it gives optimal results up to constant factors in the first regime, and up to no​(1)superscript𝑛𝑜1n^{o(1)} factors in the latter one. We also obtain results in high-dimensional settings when both the initial positions and noise vectors have anisotropic sub-Gaussian distributions. This is motivated by the connection with data deduplication, where non-isotropy seems natural. Our main finding is that there seems to be natural “effective dimension”  and “effective SNR”  parameters that govern the matching problem in this setting, much like the true dimension determines the error rate for isotropic Gaussians .\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: we would like to track each particle’s trajectory.
