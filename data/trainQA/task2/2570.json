      "content": "Paper Title: Attribute-based Explanation of Non-Linear Embeddings of High-Dimensional Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNon-linear dimensionality reduction techniques are widely used for data exploration . Much of the work centers around finding better projections, controlling and communicating error, and automatic detection and visualization of features.\nA critical aspect that receives far less support is the interpretation of projected data. Common techniques are (i) direct enrichment, (ii) cluster-based enrichment, and (iii) spatially-structured enrichment .\nDirect techniques augment the embedding for example with attribute-based color and text labels to provide additional information . A variety of techniques is presented by Aupetit  using color-coding on the glyphs 3   2, (hex)bin visualizations for local densities and values , and multivariate glyph-based approaches.\nAll these techniques have in common that they can represent per pixel only attribute values of a single data point. However, most multidimensional projections (linear and non-linear alike) suffer from projection ambiguity, i.e., data points with different attribute values are projected onto the same 2D coordinate, which needs to be communicated.\nThe methods closest to our approach are classified as spatially-structured enrichment, which first partition the space using techniques such as Voronoi diagrams or treemaps and afterwards enrich these regions  . Most of these applications, however, aim at a non-overlapping partitioning, which we specifically want to integrate to correctly reflect the nature of the data. Several techniques aim at the reconstruction of a continuous scalarfield that can be directly visualized using field visualization techniques, e.g., ProbingProjection  or DataContextMap . These spatial techniques directly avoid overplotting and group coherent regions 7, but need special strategies to cope with projection ambiguity as will be discussed in more detail in Sect. 3.1. The third line of research that also follows the concept of a continuous field\ntries to recover the non-linear axes or illustrate regions of maximal attribute values. The DataContextMap  enriches the embedding with additional data points that locate regions of high attribute values and augment the visualization with additional attribute-based contours on the reconstructed scalar field .\nDimReader  augments the embedding with non-linear grid lines and prolines [ref]11 display the non-linear axes. The t-viSNE system  presents an analytics tool to explore t-SNE projections  using for enrichment color-coded glyphs augmented with interactive exploration. An excellent overview of interaction with dimensionality reduction is given by Sacha et al. . The techniques in this third category are complimentary to our approach and can be combined with the here proposed rangesets.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: attribute values and augment the visualization with additional attribute-based contours on the reconstructed scalar field .\nDimReader  augments the embedding with non-linear grid lines and prolines [ref]11 display the non-linear axes.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
