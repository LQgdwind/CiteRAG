      "content": "Paper Title: OSCAR-Net: Object-centric Scene Graph Attention for Image Attribution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDesign Component Ablation. We study the contribution of each design component in OSCAR-Net in Tab. 3. We begin with a minimal design where 𝒩𝒩\\mathcal{N} contains only the object features visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} and OSCAR-Net has only 1 encoder stream ℱOsubscriptℱ𝑂\\mathcal{F}_{O} (exp.A). We then add additional components including the pretrained fvsuperscript𝑓𝑣f^{v} (exp.B), geometry features gisubscript𝑔𝑖g_{i} (exp.C), shape feature sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i} (exp.D), the second encoder stream ℱRsubscriptℱ𝑅\\mathcal{F}_{R} with edge features ei​jsubscript𝑒𝑖𝑗e_{ij} (exp.E) to the full model (exp.J). We also remove important components from the full model or test alternative designs (exp.G-I). Pretraining the CNN module fvsuperscript𝑓𝑣f^{v} is essential as it helps double performance (exp.B vs. A). The geometry features gisubscript𝑔𝑖g_{i} play an important role (exp.C) while the shape sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i} and edge ei​jsubscript𝑒𝑖𝑗e_{ij} features steadily improve performance (exp.D-E). Integrating the global CNN branch ℱGsubscriptℱ𝐺\\mathcal{F}_{G} to our object-centric network also boosts performance especially on benchmark I (exp.J), although the single CNN alone does not perform well (exp.F). Exp.G and H show the complementary effects of the transformer ℋO,Rsubscriptℋ𝑂𝑅\\mathcal{H}_{O,R} and self-attention PO,Rsubscript𝑃𝑂𝑅P_{O,R} (eq. 7) modules in our network design. We implemented exp.G by removing the self-attention layer and used the feature of the first element in the output sequence as the embedding (similar to ), resulting in a performance drop by 8.1% and 1.2% on the two benchmarks. Exp.H is the GNN architecture described earlier in sec. 4.3, causing 3% and 1.1% drop in performance respectively. Additionally, we experimented with a non-fully connected graph in exp.I where two objects are considered as connected only if their relative distance and intersection are within a given threshold, similar to  . Non-connected objects are masked out during the attention computation in ℋOsubscriptℋ𝑂\\mathcal{H}_{O} and their pairwise relations are removed from the edge features ℰℰ\\mathcal{E}. Exp.I reports 0.9% performance drop in benchmark I and 0.5% on benchmark II. This demonstrates our OSCAR-Net capability in learning the connection weights within a fully connected graph. Content Loss Ablation. Tab. 2 (top) shows how alternative content loss functions affect performance on the two benchmarks. Standard pairwise contrastive loss  fails to discriminate subtle differences in manipulated images. Standard SimCLR  lags behind by 4% and 1.5% on the two benchmarks but still outperforms standard triplet loss [ref]46 despite being a self-supervised method. We modified triplet loss by: (i) randomly sampling negative images from other image instances instead of just manipulated images, (ii) randomly feeding the anchor branch with manipulated images and the negative branch with originals, and (iii) adding another L2 term to explicitly push the negatives from the originals. This improved version, named Triplet+, has the closest performance to SimCLR+ but requires a more complex sampling strategy. Hash Loss Ablation. Tab. 2 (bottom) reports on alternative hash functions. We experimented with tanh​()tanh\\mathrm{tanh}() as a continuous relaxation method [ref]8. We also implemented the bit balancing strategy that regularize the number of 0 and 1 bits, as suggested by  to improve the hash discrimination. Performance on the 256-D continuous space i.e. no hash is reported as an upper-bound reference. Additionally, we compare online hashing with an offline method using Product Quantization (PQ) [ref]27 via FAISS . Offline hash with PQ had the lowest performance (8.6% and 0.8% behind our proposed method on the two benchmarks). For online hashing, optimizing directly on the discrete space (sign​()sign\\mathrm{sign}()) outperforms the relaxation method (tanh​()tanh\\mathrm{tanh}()). Also, we find that bit balancing offers only minor improvement for the online approximation method and hinders unnecessary constraints on the proposed direct optimization method. Overall the use of hashing for image matching enables retrieval speeds of 380ms on average (an indicative speed for 1M images on single-core, i7 CPU) for a 64-bit hash, versus an average of 1.5s for the same using a 256-D real-valued embedding (128x larger footprint). The corresponding difference in accuracy (for our proposed, best case: discrete space optimization) is 13.1% on benchmark I and 3.4% on benchmark II justifying the approach.\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: contrastive loss  fails to discriminate subtle differences in manipulated images.
