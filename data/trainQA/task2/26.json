      "content": "Paper Title: A Common Semantic Space for Monolingual and Cross-Lingual Meta-Embeddings\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPrevious research in word embedding learning methods have shown that word embeddings learnt using different methods and resources present significant variation in quality. For instance, Hill et al.  show that word embeddings trained from monolingual or bilingual corpora capture different nearest neighbours. The term meta-embedding was coined by Yin and Sch√ºtze . They showed how to combine five different pre-trained word embeddings using a small neural network for improving the accuracy of cross-domain part-of-speech (POS) tagging. Following this research line, Bollegala et al. [ref]9 propose an unsupervised locally linear method for learning meta-embeddings from a given set of pre-trained source embeddings while Bollegala and Bao  proposed three types of autoencoders for the purpose of learning meta-embeddings. Although word embeddings are mainly constructed by exploiting information from text corpora only  [ref]34 , some research tries to combine it with the knowledge encoded in lexical resources such as WordNet   , PPDB  or ConceptNet 0.\nGoikoetxea et al.  show that simply concatenating word embeddings derived from text and WordNet outperform alternative methods such as retrofitting  at the cost of increasing the dimensionality of the meta-embeddings. Coates and Bollegala  prove that averaging is in some cases better than concatenation, with the additional benefit of a reduced dimensionality.\nThe most popular approach to address the dimensionality problem is to apply dimensionality reduction algorithms such as SVD , PC  or DRA . In this line of work, Numberbatch 0 claims to be the best meta-embedding model so far. Numberbatch combines the knowledge encoded in ConcepNet, word2vec, GloVe and OpenSubtitles corpus using concatenation, dimensionality reduction and a variation on retrofitting. Cross-lingual word embeddings also combine the knowledge from different languages and can be created using parallel corpora  or some sort of bilingual signal. An alternative approach is to train the embeddings for each language independently on monolingual corpora, and then map them to a shared common space based on a bilingual dictionary . This requires minimal bilingual supervision compared to other approaches, while still leveraging large amounts of monolingual corpora with very competitive results  . The work from Doval et al.  is the most similar to ours.\nHowever, instead of creating monolingual and cross-lingual meta-embeddings, their goal is to improve the multilingual mappings from VecMap  and MUSE  by averaging the two source embeddings once they are mapped into a common vector space. After the mapping, they use a linear mapping to predict the averages for OOV words. Their method is evaluated in word similarity, bilingual dictionary induction and cross-lingual hypernym discovery. Our approach differs in three significant ways: First, using our method we can combine any number of monolingual and cross-lingual source embeddings in any language. Second, we propose a new algorithm to generate representations for those words missing in some of the source embeddings. This new algorithm is compatible with the generation of both mono- and cross-lingual meta-embeddings thereby allowing us to improve the cross-lingual mapping and the quality of the final meta-embeddings. This means that we can apply transfer learning to exploit pre-trained source embeddings from a resource-rich language in order to improve the word representations for an less-resourced language. Finally, we also carried out extensive intrinsic (multilingual and cross-lingual word similarity) and extrinsic evaluations (multilingual Semantic Textual Similarity and multilingual POS tagging).\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: five different pre-trained word embeddings using a small neural network for improving the accuracy of cross-domain part-of-speech (POS) tagging.
