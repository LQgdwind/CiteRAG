Note that in the remaining of the paper, we focus on GnnExplainer; however, the proposed methods can be also applied to other explanation methods and detailed results can be found in the Section 5.3. Next, we first introduce key notations and concepts used in this work. Graph Neural Networks. Formally, let G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) denote a graph where V={v1,…,vn}𝑉subscript𝑣1…subscript𝑣𝑛V=\\{v_{1},...,v_{n}\\} is the set of n𝑛n nodes and E={e1,…,ek}𝐸subscript𝑒1…subscript𝑒𝑘E=\\{e_{1},...,e_{k}\\} is the edge set. We use 𝐀∈{0,1}n×n𝐀superscript01𝑛𝑛\\mathbf{A}\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n\\times n} to indicate the adjacency matrix of G𝐺G, where the i,j𝑖𝑗i,j-th element Ai​jsubscript𝐴𝑖𝑗{A}_{ij} is 1 if node visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} and node vjsubscript𝑣𝑗v_{j} are connected in G𝐺G, and 0 otherwise. We also use 𝐗=[𝐱1,𝐱2,…,𝐱n]∈ℝn×d𝐗subscript𝐱1subscript𝐱2…subscript𝐱𝑛superscriptℝ𝑛𝑑\\mathbf{X}=[\\mathbf{x}_{1},\\mathbf{x}_{2},...,\\mathbf{x}_{n}]\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d} to represent the node feature matrix, where 𝐱isubscript𝐱𝑖\\mathbf{x}_{i} is the d𝑑d-dimensional feature vector of the node visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i}. Here we use G=(𝐀,𝐗)𝐺𝐀𝐗G=(\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{X}) to represent the graph data. Without loss of generality, given a graph G=(𝐀,𝐗)𝐺𝐀𝐗G=(\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{X}), we consider the problem of node classification for GNNs to learn a function fθ:VL→YL:subscript𝑓𝜃→subscript𝑉𝐿subscript𝑌𝐿f_{\\theta}:V_{L}\\rightarrow Y_{L}, that maps a part of nodes VL={v1,v2,…,vl}subscript𝑉𝐿subscript𝑣1subscript𝑣2…subscript𝑣𝑙V_{L}=\\left\\{v_{1},v_{2},...,v_{l}\\right\\} to their corresponding labels YL={y1,y2,…,yl}subscript𝑌𝐿subscript𝑦1subscript𝑦2…subscript𝑦𝑙Y_{L}=\\left\\{y_{1},y_{2},...,y_{l}\\right\\} .\nThe objective function of GNNs can be defined as: where θ𝜃\\theta is the parameters of a GNN model fθsubscript𝑓𝜃f_{\\theta}.\nfθ​(𝐀,𝐗)vicsubscript𝑓𝜃superscriptsubscript𝐀𝐗subscript𝑣𝑖𝑐f_{\\theta}({\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{X}})_{v_{i}}^{c} denotes the c𝑐c-th softmax output of node visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} and C𝐶C is the number of class. yisubscript𝑦𝑖y_{i} is the true label of node visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} and ℓ​(⋅,⋅)ℓ⋅⋅\\ell(\\cdot,\\cdot) is the cross-entropy loss function.\nIn this work, we adopt a two-layer GCN model  with θ=(𝐖1,𝐖2)𝜃subscript𝐖1subscript𝐖2\\theta=(\\mathbf{W}_{1},\\mathbf{W}_{2}) as:\nfθ​(𝐀,𝐗)=softmax⁡(𝐀~​σ​(𝐀~​𝐗​𝐖1)​𝐖2)subscript𝑓𝜃𝐀𝐗softmax~𝐀𝜎~𝐀𝐗subscript𝐖1subscript𝐖2f_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{X})=\\operatorname{softmax}(\\tilde{\\mathbf{A}}\\thinspace\\sigma(\\tilde{\\mathbf{A}}\\thinspace\\mathbf{X}\\thinspace\\mathbf{W}_{1})\\thinspace\\mathbf{W}_{2}),\nwhere 𝐀~=𝐃~−1/2​(𝐀+𝐈)​𝐃~−1/2~𝐀superscript~𝐃12𝐀𝐈superscript~𝐃12\\tilde{\\bf A}=\\tilde{\\bf D}^{-1/2}({\\bf A}+{\\bf I})\\tilde{\\bf D}^{-1/2} and 𝐃~~𝐃\\tilde{\\bf D} is the diagonal matrix of 𝐀+𝐈𝐀𝐈{\\bf A}+{\\bf I} with 𝐃~i​i=1+∑j𝐀i​jsubscript~𝐃𝑖𝑖1subscript𝑗subscript𝐀𝑖𝑗\\tilde{\\bf D}_{ii}=1+\\sum_{j}{\\bf A}_{ij}. σ𝜎\\operatorname{\\sigma} is the activation function such as ReLU. GnnExplainer. In order to explain why a GNN model fθsubscript𝑓𝜃f_{\\theta} predicts a given node visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i}’s label as Y𝑌Y, the GnnExplainer acts to provide a local interpretation GS=(𝐀S,𝐗S)subscript𝐺𝑆subscript𝐀𝑆subscript𝐗𝑆G_{S}=(\\mathbf{A}_{S},\\mathbf{X}_{S}) by highlighting the relevant features 𝐗Ssubscript𝐗𝑆\\mathbf{X}_{S} and the relevant subgraph structure 𝐀Ssubscript𝐀𝑆\\mathbf{A}_{S} for its prediction [ref]20 . To achieve this goal, it formalizes the problem as an optimization task to find the optimal explanation (GSsubscript𝐺𝑆G_{S}), which has the maximum Mutual Information (MI) with the GNN’s prediction Y𝑌Y: M​I​(Y,(𝐀S,𝐗S)):=H​(Y)−H​(Y|𝐀=𝐀S,𝐗=𝐗S)assign𝑀𝐼𝑌subscript𝐀𝑆subscript𝐗𝑆𝐻𝑌𝐻formulae-sequenceconditional𝑌𝐀subscript𝐀𝑆𝐗subscript𝐗𝑆MI\\left(Y,(\\mathbf{A}_{S},\\mathbf{X}_{S})\\right):=H(Y)-H(Y|\\mathbf{A}=\\mathbf{A}_{S},\\mathbf{X}=\\mathbf{X}_{S}).\nAs the GNN model fθsubscript𝑓𝜃f_{\\theta} is fixed, the entropy term H​(Y)𝐻𝑌H(Y) is also fixed.\nIn other words, the explanation for visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i}’s prediction y^isubscript^𝑦𝑖\\hat{y}_{i} is a subgraph 𝐀Ssubscript𝐀𝑆\\mathbf{A}_{S} and associated features 𝐗Ssubscript𝐗𝑆\\mathbf{X}_{S} that minimize the uncertainty of the GNN fθsubscript𝑓𝜃f_{\\theta} when the neural message-passing is limited to GSsubscript𝐺𝑆G_{S} as:\nmax(𝐀S,𝐗S)⁡M​I​(Y,(𝐀S,𝐗S))≈min(𝐀S,𝐗S)−∑c=1C𝕀​[y^i=c]​ln⁡fθ​(𝐀S,𝐗S)vic.subscriptsubscript𝐀𝑆subscript𝐗𝑆𝑀𝐼𝑌subscript𝐀𝑆subscript𝐗𝑆subscriptsubscript𝐀𝑆subscript𝐗𝑆superscriptsubscript𝑐1𝐶𝕀delimited-[]subscript^𝑦𝑖𝑐subscript𝑓𝜃superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝐀𝑆subscript𝐗𝑆subscript𝑣𝑖𝑐\\max_{(\\mathbf{A}_{S},\\mathbf{X}_{S})}MI\\left(Y,(\\mathbf{A}_{S},\\mathbf{X}_{S})\\right)\\approx\\min_{(\\mathbf{A}_{S},\\mathbf{X}_{S})}-\\sum_{c=1}^{C}\\mathbb{I}[\\hat{y}_{i}=c]\\ln f_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{A}_{S},\\mathbf{X}_{S})_{v_{i}}^{c}. Experimentally, the objective function of GnnExplainer can be optimized to learn adjacency mask matrix 𝐌Asubscript𝐌𝐴\\mathbf{M}_{A} and feature selection mask matrix 𝐌Fsubscript𝐌𝐹\\mathbf{M}_{F} in the following manner [ref]20 : where ⊙direct-product\\odot denotes element-wise multiplication, and σ𝜎\\sigma is the sigmoid function that maps the mask to [ref]0 n×nsuperscript01𝑛𝑛[ref]0 ^{{}^{n\\times n}}.\nAfter the optimal mask 𝐌Asubscript𝐌𝐴\\mathbf{M}_{A} is obtained, we can compute 𝐀S=𝐀⊙σ​(𝐌A)subscript𝐀𝑆direct-product𝐀𝜎subscript𝐌𝐴\\mathbf{A}_{S}=\\mathbf{A}\\odot\\sigma(\\mathbf{M}_{A}) and use a threshold to remove low values.\nFinally, top-L𝐿L edges with the largest values can provide an explanation 𝐀Ssubscript𝐀𝑆\\mathbf{A}_{S} for GNN’s prediction at node visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i}. The same operation 𝐗S=𝐗⊙σ​(𝐌F)subscript𝐗𝑆direct-product𝐗𝜎subscript𝐌𝐹\\mathbf{X}_{S}=\\mathbf{X}\\odot\\sigma(\\mathbf{M}_{F}) can be used to produce explanations by considering the feature information. GnnExplainer as Adversarial Inspector. In our work, we first hypothesize that if a model gives a wrong prediction to a test node visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} because of some adversarially inserted fake edges, these “adversarial edges” should make a great contribution to the model’s prediction outcome. Therefore, if a GnnExplainer  can understand this wrong prediction outcome by figuring out the most influential edges, we are highly likely to find and locate the adversarial edges and finally exclude them from data.\nIn particular, GnnExplainer can reduce search space by generating a subgraph, and then domain experts can efficiently inspect the anomaly in the subgraph.\nFor example, in a GNN based system for credit card fraud detection, when the system predicts a high-risk transaction for a consumer, financial experts can adopt a GnnExplainer to generate a small subgraph with some influential nodes (factors/features) from millions of features for this transaction. Then, financial experts use their professional knowledge to effectively inspect the anomaly in the generated subgraph. In this subsection, we first dispatch empirical studies to validate the above mentioned hypothesis.\nNote that in this work we concentrate on GNN’s explanation on graph structural adversarial perturbations (for graph feature perturbations are similar, we leave it for future work).\nThus, the objective function of GnnExplainer for adversarial edges detection can be defined as: where we find an optimal adjacency mask matrix MAsubscriptM𝐴\\textbf{M}_{A}, namely the influential subgraph for visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i}’s prediction.\nTo check the inspection performance and verify our hypothesis, we check whether\nthe influential subgraph generated by GnnExplainer can help detect the adversarially inserted fake edges. Inspection Performance. We conduct preliminary experiments on two real-world datasets (i.e., CITESEER and CORA). \nThe details of experimental settings can be found in Section 5.1.\nIn these experiments, we choose the state-of-the-art graph attack method for GNN model, Nettack 3, to perturb the graph data by adding adversarial edges only111Removing edges or modifying nodes’ features is much expensive and harder than adding fake connections among nodes in real-world social networks such as Facebook and Twitter  6..\nFor each different node’s degree, we randomly choose 40 target (victim) nodes to validate whether the adversarial edges can be found by GnnExplainer for them. To extract the subgraph (GSsubscript𝐺𝑆G_{S}) for explanation, GnnExplainer first computes the important weights on edges via masked adjacency (𝐌Asubscript𝐌𝐴\\mathbf{M}_{A}), and then uses a threshold to remove the edges with low values. Finally, top L𝐿L edges provide the explanation (GSsubscript𝐺𝑆G_{S}) for the GNN’s prediction at target node [ref]20. In other words, adversarial edges with higher important weights are more likely to present at top ranks and be easily detected by people (such as system inspectors or designers).\nHere, we adopt the F1 and NDCG to evaluate the detection rate on adversarial edges, where higher values of F1 and NDCG indicate that the adversarial edges are more likely to be detected and noticeable.\nAs shown in Figures 2 and 3, the Nettack attacker can perform effective attacks for nodes with different degrees, achieving around 95% attack success rate (ASR). Meanwhile, we can observe that the detection performance via GnnExplainer on these datasets are quite high, especially for the nodes with low degree achieving around 0.4 under the NDCG metric. It means that the adversarial edges are highly likely to be ranked top among all edges which contribute to the model’s prediction.\nIn other words, GnnExplainer can generate a small subgraph (with some influential nodes) to reduce search space from millions of edges, and adversarial edges ranked top among all edges in the subgraph are likely to be inspected by domain experts. Thus, these observations indicate that GnnExplainer has the potential to mark the adversarial edges in corrupted graph data for GNNs. Note that similar observations on another representative explainer (PGExplainer ) can be found in Figure 7 (Refer to Appendix Section). Problem Statement. Given the node classification task, the attacker aims to attack a specific target node vi∈Vtsubscript𝑣𝑖subscript𝑉𝑡v_{i}\\in{V}_{t} by performing small perturbations on the graph G=(𝐀,𝐗)𝐺𝐀𝐗G=(\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{X}) and obtains the corrupted graph G^=(𝐀^,𝐗^)^𝐺^𝐀^𝐗{\\hat{G}}=(\\mathbf{\\hat{A}},\\mathbf{\\hat{X}}), such that the predicted label of the target node visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} can be manipulated 3 7. There are two main types of adversarial perturbations on the graph, including structure attacks to modify the adjacency matrix 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{A} and feature attacks to modify the feature matrix 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X}.\nFor s​i​m​p​l​i​c​i​t​y1𝑠𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑡superscript𝑦1{simplicity}^{\\ref{footnode:adding_edges}}, we focus on the structure attacks, where attackers only add fake edges to connect the target nodes with others under certain perturbation budget ΔΔ\\Delta.\nNote that a fixed perturbation budget ΔΔ\\Delta can be constrained as: ‖𝐄′‖=‖𝐀^−𝐀‖0≤Δnormsuperscript𝐄′subscriptnorm^𝐀𝐀0Δ\\|\\mathbf{E}^{\\prime}\\|=\\|\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}-{\\mathbf{A}}\\|_{0}\\leq\\Delta, where 𝐄′superscript𝐄′\\mathbf{E}^{\\prime} denotes the added adversarial edges by the attackers. In our work, in order to jointly attack a GNN model and its explanations, we design a new attacking method which is designed to achieve: (1) misleading the GNN model fθsubscript𝑓𝜃f_{\\theta} to give a wrong prediction y^isubscript^𝑦𝑖\\hat{y}_{i} on node visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i}; and (2) misleading the explanations of the GNN model such that the added fake edges do not appear in the output subgraph ASsubscriptA𝑆\\textbf{A}_{S} given by the GnnExplainer [ref]20.\nMore formally, we state our attacking objective as: Problem: Given G=(𝐀,𝐗)𝐺𝐀𝐗G=(\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{X}), target (victim) nodes vi⊆Vtsubscript𝑣𝑖subscript𝑉𝑡v_{i}\\subseteq{V}_{t} and specific target label y^isubscript^𝑦𝑖\\hat{y}_{i}, the attacker aims to select adversarial edges to composite a new graph 𝐀^^𝐀\\hat{\\mathbf{A}} which fulfills the following two goals: (1) The added adversarial edges can change the GNN’s prediction to a specific target label: y^i=arg​maxc⁡fθ​(𝐀^,𝐗)vicsubscript^𝑦𝑖subscriptargmax𝑐subscript𝑓𝜃superscriptsubscript^𝐀𝐗subscript𝑣𝑖𝑐\\hat{y}_{i}=\\operatornamewithlimits{arg\\,max}_{c}f_{\\theta}(\\hat{\\mathbf{A}},\\mathbf{X})_{v_{i}}^{c}; and\n(2) The added adversarial edges will not be included in the subgraph generated by explainer: 𝐀^−𝐀∉𝐀S^𝐀𝐀subscript𝐀𝑆\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}-\\mathbf{A}\\notin{\\mathbf{A}_{S}}.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: In this section, we investigate the potential of GnnExplainer [ref]20 to detect adversarial attacks through empirical study.
