      "content": "Paper Title: Effectiveness Assessment of Recent Large Vision-Language Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe emergence of large language models (LLMs)   has sparked a revolution in the realm of natural language processing, owing to their promising generalization and reasoning capabilities. Motivated by this progress, researchers have pioneered the development of powerful large vision-language models (LVLMs)  [ref]4 [ref]5, leveraging the impressive capabilities of LLMs to enhance the comprehension of visual semantics. This advancement notably elevates model performance in complex vision-language tasks [ref]4 [ref]6 , signifying a significant step towards the realization of artificial general intelligence (AGI). In general, the capabilities of LVLMs can be broadly categorized into two groups: general capabilities [ref]4 [ref]5, which encompass tasks of a more universal nature, and specialized capabilities  , which pertain to tasks with domain-specific expertise. Both specialized and general capabilities are integral components on the path towards achieving AGI. Specialized capabilities are imperative for making strides in specific domains, while general capabilities serve as the bedrock of knowledge and understanding, facilitating progress across diverse domains.\nRecently, numerous studies have extensively assessed and investigated the general and specialized capabilities of LVLMs. However, a majority of these studies primarily focus on the application of models within a single professional domain 0 1   or assess their general abilities  [ref]6.\nIn this article, we embark on comprehensive assessment of various recent open-source LVLMs, spanning a diverse array of challenging specialized tasks and generic tasks. (§ 4)(§ 2)(§ 3) Our evaluation platform is illustrated in Fig. 1.\nTo assess the proficiency of LVLMs in specialized tasks, we select three recent open-source LVLMs (MiniGPT-v2 [ref]4, LLaVA-1.5 2, and Shikra 3) and conduct comprehensive assessment using a tailored testbed. This testbed comprises six challenging specialized tasks distributed across three diverse scenarios (natural, healthcare, and industrial).\nIn natural scenes, we focus on salient object detection (SOD) 5, transparent object detection (TOD) 6, and camouflaged object detection (COD) 7 8, considering the target objects ranging from frequently occurring ones to those more infrequent and challenging ones.\nIn the field of healthcare, the aimed objects span from skin lesions 9 that exhibit prominent visual characteristics and therefore are easier to detect, to increasingly intricate and specialized polyps 0.\nBesides, we incorporate anomaly detection (AD) 1, a task vital in industrial scenarios, to assess the performance of LVLMs.\nThese six commonly encountered computer vision tasks, which come with specialized datasets, cover a broad spectrum of specialized domains and enable comprehensive validation of the specialized capabilities inherent in LVLMs.\nAs illustrated in Fig. 1, given inherent challenges posed by these tasks in terms of recognizing and localizing objects with specific attributes, we employ tailored prompts featuring specific attributes of objects to assess the recognition (§ 2) and localization (§ 3) capabilities of the models.\nFurthermore, we conduct empirical investigations on a universal dataset (COCO 4) that is devoid of domain-specific expertise. We abstain from specifying particular attributes in prompts, aiming to explore multi-modal understanding capabilities (§ 4) of the above-mentioned models and widely-recognized GPT-4V in general tasks (i.e., object counting, absurd question answering, affordance reasoning, attribute recognition, and spatial relation reasoning). Our investigations reveal that while these models exhibit strong potential for specialized tasks when directly applied without fine-tuning and training, they still demonstrate suboptimal performance and limited cognitive abilities. This reveals their inadequate generalization capacity in this particular context.\nPerformance issues are further magnified by typical weaknesses of LVLMs such as object hallucination, text-to-image interference, and decreased robustness in complex problems. In addition to shortcomings exposed in specialized tasks, these models also show significant room to improve in general tasks, particularly in object counting, spatial reasoning, and absurd question answering.\nIn summary, in this study, we assess the proficiency of three open-source LVLMs on six challenging specialized tasks and four LVLMs on several general tasks. We anticipate that our study will provide valuable insights for the future development of LVLMs, encompassing both general and specialized capabilities.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: owing to their promising generalization and reasoning capabilities.
