Unintentional activities sometimes occur due to negligence or a lack of understanding of security policies. Although insider threat analysis has been studied for many years, the emergence of new approaches is limited due to a lack of real-world data and difficulty finding an effective solution. Nowadays insider threat analysis attracts wider attention due to the increase in frequency of attacks and the advent of promising data analysis techniques. Existing works helped to understand the exhaustive range of methods applied from various perspectives. To list a few, it includes statistical metric based solutions , machine learning [ref]10, image-based analysis ,\nblockchain-based analysis ,\nnatural language processing (NLP) approaches\nand dealing with the insider attack in several critical application areas like health care  and Internet of Things [ref]15. There is an upward trend towards using machine learning and deep learning based solutions for insider threat analysis. In the survey , Homoliak et al. presented a classification of insider threat research publications and promising study directions. The authors identify the use of GAN for adversarial classification for enhanced threat detection and data augmentation while recommending possible research directions. Existing works use various data generation and augmentation strategies in insider threat detection. The method followed in  based on the email communications create a new set of data, Enron+, followed by anomaly detection using Isolation Forest algorithm. The scenario-based classification in the work  considered the problem as three different binary classification problems and used Random Over Sampling (ROS) for data augmentation under various sampling ratios. The method gave good results for Scenario 2 on Random Forest whereas it could not perform satisfactorily on Scenarios 1 and 3. Spread subsample, a method that selects the random samples to fit in the memory by balancing the skewed class distributions is mentioned in the paper . An ensemble strategy combined with data adjusted XGBoost model for insider threat detection proposed in  gave promising results. All these works performed supervised binary classification for insider detection. In the paper , the authors considered class labels also in the data generation process which helped in generating more meaningful data.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: techniques.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
