      "content": "Paper Title: RvS: What is Essential for Offline RL via Supervised Learning?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo provide a comprehensive empirical study of RvS methods, we selected a broad range of tasks; the state-based tasks in prior work on various types of RvS or conditional imitation methods typically include only a subset of the domains we consider 6 [ref]18 .\nOur goal will be to include: (1) domains and datasets that are appropriate for different types of conditioning, including goals and rewards; (2) datasets that include different proportions of near-optimal data, ranging from near-expert datasets to ones with very few or no optimal trajectories at all; (3) datasets that run the gamut in terms of task dimensionality; (4) domains that have been studied by prior value-based offline RL methods. GCSL is a suite of goal-conditioned environments used by Ghosh et al. [ref]18 to evaluate GCSL, a goal-conditioned RvS method with online data collection. We adapt these tasks for offline RL by using a random policy to collect training data, which results in suboptimal trajectories. The tasks include 2D navigation with obstacles (FourRooms, Eysenbach et al. ); two end-effector controlled Sawyer robotic arm tasks (Door and Pusher, Nair et al. ); the Lunar Lander video game, which requires controlling thrusters to land a simulated Lunar Excursion Module (Lander); and a manipulation task that requires rotating a valve with a robotic claw (Claw, Ahn et al. ). Gym Locomotion v2 tasks consist of the HalfCheetah, Hopper, and Walker datasets from the D4RL offline RL benchmark [ref]12. We use the random, medium, medium-expert, and medium-replay datasets in our evaluations, which consist of (a mixture of different) policies with varying levels of optimality. This requires learning from mixed and suboptimal data, and we will see that TD learning methods perform comparatively well on the random data. Franka Kitchen v0 is a 9-DoF robotic manipulation task paired with datasets of human demonstrations. This task originates from Gupta et al.  and was formalized as an offline RL task in D4RL [ref]12. Solving this task requires composing multi-step behaviors (e.g., open the microwave, then flip a switch) from component skills. This task includes three datasets: complete, where all trajectories solve all tasks in sequence; partial, where only a subset of trajectories perform the desired tasks in sequence; and mixed, which contains various subtasks but never all in sequence, requiring generalization and temporal composition. AntMaze v2 involves controlling an 8-DoF quadruped to navigate to a particular goal state. This benchmark task, from D4RL [ref]12, uses a non-Markovian demonstrator policy and was intended to test an agent’s ability to learn temporal compositionality by combining subtrajectories of different demonstrations. There are three mazes of increasing size: umaze, medium, and large, and there are two datasets types: diverse and play. The D4RL paper [ref]12 claims that “diverse” data navigates from random start locations to random goal locations while “play” navigates between hand-picked start-goal pairs.\nPrior work has proposed that, for tasks requiring temporal compositionality, dynamic programming with value-based methods should be particularly important [ref]12. However, we find in AntMaze that RvS outperforms all the dynamic programming methods we consider. When applying RvS learning methods, one must choose a type of outcome, such as rewards or goals.\nIn Kitchen and AntMaze, the reward function is implemented in terms of goals. The kitchen reward is for completing multiple subtasks, so we condition RvS-G on a state in which all the subtasks have been achieved. For AntMaze, we condition RvS-G on the goal location in the maze. This choice makes the additional assumption that we know how the reward function is defined, rather than just receiving samples from the reward function. Because GCSL is inherently a multitask, goal-conditioned setup, we omit reward conditioning and only report RvS-G. Conversely, because there is no clear way to define performance in Gym w.r.t. a goal, we omit goal conditioning and only report RvS-R.\nFor all tasks, we report scores in the range   . For GCSL, the score corresponds to the percentage of episodes in which the agent achieves the goal. In the other environments, we follow Fu et al. [ref]12 and normalize the score according to 100⋅return−randomexpert−random⋅100returnrandomexpertrandom100\\cdot\\frac{\\text{return}-\\text{random}}{\\text{expert}-\\text{random}}.
