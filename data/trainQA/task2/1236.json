      "content": "Paper Title: CM-Net: Concentric Mask based Arbitrary-Shaped Text Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nText detection has become increasingly important and popular, which provides fundamental information for intelligent devices to understand scenes. Recent progresses made in object detection¬†[ref]1  , semantic segmentation¬†  , and instance segmentation¬†   improve the development of text detection significantly. Recent research focus has shifted from multi-oriented text detection¬†[ref]10   or arbitrary-shaped text detection¬†   to more challenging real-time arbitrary-shaped text detection¬†[ref]16 . Benefiting from the advantages of shrink masks¬†[ref]10, existing real-time text detection methods can represent text instances in a more efficient way, which brings significant improvements for detection speed. For example, Wang e‚Äãt‚Äãa‚Äãl.ùëíùë°ùëéùëôet~{}al.¬†[ref]16 modeled text instances by shrink masks, text masks, and similar vectors. They obtained the final text region by extending shrink masks to text masks based on similar vectors. Liao e‚Äãt‚Äãa‚Äãl.ùëíùë°ùëéùëôet~{}al.¬† extended shrink mask contours outward by fixed shrink distances to rebuild text contours. As for detection speed, these methods have fewer prediction headers and post-processing steps compared with previous works¬†  0, which speeds up the inference process. For detection accuracy, since they detect text instances based on shrink masks, the detection accuracy greatly relies on the recognition of shrink masks. However, the shrink mask is insensitive to text instance shapes, which leads to failure fitting for some irregular-shaped text contours and further influences the model performance. Moreover, three disadvantages exist in shrink masks based real-time arbitrary-shaped text detection methods, which heavily hamper them to recognize shrink masks accurately: (1) The deficient recognition of text contour features. Since the shrink mask is generated through moving text contours inward by a specific shrink distance, there is a strong correlation between text contours and the shrink mask contours. Therefore, the lack of recognition ability of text contours is adverse to recognizing shrink masks. (2) The patch-level text local features are neglected. It makes the model may suffer from the failure of discriminating text instances from the background. Specifically, these methods mainly learn the shrink mask features by training the networks by pixel-level classification tasks. It leads to small receptive fields for the model and further may result in false detection in some background regions that texture is similar to text instances. (3) The ambiguous definition of the gap region features between text contours and shrink mask contours, which hinders the recognition of shrink mask regions from text regions. Since both the gap regions and shrink masks are parts of text instances and they have similar texture features and semantic information, it is important for recognizing shrink masks to distinguish gap regions and shrink masks. But these methods do not explicitly define the difference between gap regions and shrink masks in the training stage, which makes the learned shrink mask features less discriminative. Considering the aforementioned limitations, we propose a novel real-time text detector, namely CM-Net. Firstly, to fit arbitrary-shaped text contours more effectively, we propose a concentric mask (CM) to replace the shrink mask to represent text instances. Since the shrink distance of the CM considers text instance shapes, CM can fit text contours in an effective and robust manner. Secondly, as we mentioned before, the recognition of text border features, patch-level local features, and gap region features are helpful for the recognition of CM. Based on this finding, a multi-perspective feature (MPF) module is designed to extract these CM-related features, which brings significant improvement for recognizing CM (as shown in Fig.¬†1), and no extra computational cost to the inference process. At last, a multi-factor constraints loss is proposed to optimize the CM-Net. Benefiting from the aforementioned advantages, CM-Net further simplifies the framework and becomes the most effective and efficient text detection pipeline compared with existing state-of-the-art real-time arbitrary-shaped text detection methods (as shown in Fig.¬†2). The main contributions are as follows: A novel text representation model, Concentric mask (CM), is proposed to represent text instances in a more effective manner. Benefiting from its advantages, text detectors can more accurately fit some irregular-shaped text contours compared with the shrink mask¬†[ref]10. A multi-perspective feature (MPF) module is proposed to recognize CM accurately. It encourages the network to recognize CM from contour features, patch-level local features and gap features of text instances, and brings no extra computational cost to the inference process. A novel fast and accurate text detector is designed based on CM and MPF. In the inference stage, the network only needs to predict one CM to rebuild text contours. In the training process, MPF is helpful for the detector to predict CM more accurately. To the best of our knowledge, it is the most efficient framework among existing real-time arbitrary-shaped text detectors. A multi-factor constraints loss is introduced to optimize the proposed detector for effectively recognizing CM. It balances multiple loss weights to focus on predicting CM. Moreover, it is insensitive to text scales, which improves the model robustness for various scales texts compared with existing loss such as the smooth-l1subscriptùëô1l_{1} loss. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Related works about text detection are shown in Section II. The details of our method are presented in Section III. The ablation experiments in Section IV to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. In addition, we compared the CM-Net with its counterparts in Section V. Moreover, the detection results are visualized and detection speed is analyzed in Section VI. Finally, the conclusion of this paper is given in Section VII.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Text detection has become increasingly important and popular, which provides fundamental information for intelligent devices to understand scenes.
