XAI research has traditionally focused on static learning environments, where models are trained on fixed data sets and ought to be stationary.\nHowever, machine learning models are increasingly applied in different dynamic learning environments such as incremental learning [ref]32 from data streams or continual lifelong learning .\nFor instance, predictive maintenance models are often fitted on a constant stream of sensor information 2 or financial services providers benefit from online credit scoring models 1.\nSuch application scenarios often require incremental models to be updated efficiently one by one sequentially.\nOnline models learn continuously from an ever-evolving stream of information where the learning task or the environment may change over time.\nShifts in the data distributions, called concept drift, may arise from failing sensors or irregular readings in predictive maintenance applications 2, or because of pandemic-induced lockdowns in energy forecasting systems  or hospital admission criteria 4. Similar to the static batch learning setting, high-stakes online learning applications require XAI approaches to enable the use of high-performance black-box models.\nHowever, in dynamic environments with ever-changing models, more than static explanations are required.\nTo properly explain dynamic models at any point in time, special XAI approaches are required that are, like the incremental models, updated over time one by one 8 [ref]39.\nIn this work, we are interested in the well-established PDP to explain the dependencies of features in the model.\nThe PDP is able to uncover changes in the model, which may remain undiscovered by measures based on changes in accuracy [ref]39 or global feature importance 8 .\nWe, thus, provide an incremental variant of PDP, referred to as iPDP, that efficiently computes a stream of PDPs over time.\nThis stream can be viewed as an explanation stream or interpretability stream, which summarizes the data and the model efficiently at any point in time.\nIn our experiments, we construct a synthetic data stream to highlight the benefits of iPDP over simple feature importance based methods.\nWe further provide an example application that shows how this explanation stream of iPDP can be used to reliably detect changes in a real-world data stream setting.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: models are trained on fixed data sets and ought to be stationary.\nHowever, machine learning models are increasingly applied in different dynamic learning environments such as incremental learning [ref]32 from data streams or continual lifelong learning .\nFor instance, predictive maintenance models are often fitted on a constant stream of sensor information 2 or financial services providers\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
