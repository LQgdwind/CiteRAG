      "content": "Paper Title: Minimizing the Accumulated Trajectory Error to Improve Dataset Distillation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe follow up the conventional procedure used in the literature on dataset distillation. Every experiment involves two phases‚Äîdistillation and evaluation. First, we synthesize a small synthetic set (e.g., 101010 images per class) from a given large real training set. We investigate three settings ipc=1,10,50ipc11050\\texttt{ipc}=1,10,50, which means that the distilled set contains 111, 101010 or 505050 images per class respectively. Second, in the evaluation phase on the synthetic data, we utilize the learnt synthetic set to train randomly initialized neural networks and test their performance on the real test set. For each synthetic set, we use it to train five networks with random initializations and report the mean accuracy and its standard deviation for 100010001000 iterations with a standard training procedure. Datasets. We evaluate our method on various resolution datasets. We consider the CIFAR10 and CIFAR100¬† datasets which consist of tiny colored natural images with the resolution of 32√ó32323232\\times 32 from 10 and 100 categories, respectively. We conduct experiments on the Tiny ImageNet¬† dataset with the resolution of 64√ó64646464\\times 64. We also evaluate our proposed FTD on the ImageNet subsets with the resolution of 128√ó128128128128\\times 128. These subsets are selected 10 categories by Cazenavette et al.¬†[ref]1 from the ImageNet dataset¬†. Baselines and Models.\nWe compare our method to a series of baselines including Dataset Condensation¬† (DC), Differentiable Siamese Augmentation¬†8 (DSA), and gradient-matching methods Distribution Matching¬†9 (DM), Aligning Features¬†4 (CAFE), Parameter Pruning¬† (PP), and trajectory matching method¬†[ref]1 (MTT). Following the settings of Cazenavette et al.¬†[ref]1, we distill and evaluate the synthetic set corresponding to CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using 333-layer convolutional networks (ConvNet-3) while we move up to a depth-444 ConvNet for the images with a higher resolution (64√ó64646464\\times 64) for the Tiny ImageNet dataset and a depth-555 ConvNet for the ImageNet subsets (128√ó128128128128\\times 128). We evaluate the cross-architecture classification performance of distilled images on four standard deep network architectures: ConvNet (333-layer)¬†, ResNet¬†, VGG¬†0 and AlexNet¬†. Implementation Details. We use œÅ=0.01,Œ±=1formulae-sequenceùúå0.01ùõº1\\rho=0.01,\\alpha=1 as the default values while implementing FTD. The same suite of differentiable augmentations¬†8 has been implemented as in previous studies¬†[ref]1 9. We use the Exponential Moving Average (EMA)¬†6 for faster convergence in the distillation phase for the synthetic image optimization procedure. The details of the hyperparameters used in buffer phase, distillation phase of each setting (real epochs per iteration, synthetic updates per iteration, image learning rate, etc.) are reported in Appendix¬†A.3.3. Our experiments were run on two RTX3090 and four Tesla V100 GPUs.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: of 64√ó64646464\\times 64. We also evaluate our proposed FTD on the ImageNet subsets with the resolution of 128√ó128128128128\\times 128. These subsets are selected 10 categories by Cazenavette et al.¬†[ref]1 from the ImageNet dataset¬†.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
