      "content": "Paper Title: Matryoshka: Non-Exclusive Memory Tiering via Transactional Page Migration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCaching and tiering are two traditional software approaches to manage a memory, or storage hierarchy, consisting of various types of storage media (e.g., CPU caches, DRAM, and hard disks) differing in performance, capacity, and cost. Without loss of generality, we consider a two-layer memory hierarchy with 1) a performance layer (i.e., fast tier), backed with smaller, faster, but more expensive storage media; and 2) a capacity layer (i.e., slow tier) with larger, slower, and cheaper storage media. For caching, data is stored in the capacity layer, and copies of frequently accessed or “hot” data are strategically replicated to the performance layer. For tiering, frequently accessed data is allocated to the performance layer, while less accessed data is relegated to the capacity layer. At any moment, a unique data copy is maintained exclusively. Caching and tiering share the same goal – to ensure most accesses occur at the performance layer. But, they differ in how they manage data, in the form of pages within an OS. Caching relies on page replacement algorithms to detect hot (or cold) pages and accordingly populate (or evict from) the performance layer while tiering migrates pages between the performance/capacity layers based on the observed page access pattern (hot or cold). Essentially, caching operates in an inclusive page placement mode and retains pages in its original location, merely storing a copy in the performance layer temporarily for fast access. Conversely, tiering operates in an exclusive mode, actively relocating pages across various memory/storage mediums. Diverse memory/storage devices, such as high bandwidth memory (HBM) [ref]4, CXL-based memory , persistent memory (PM) , and fast, byte-addressable NVMe SSDs , have emerged recently. While they still make a tradeoff between speed, size, and cost, the distinction between them narrows.\nFor example, Intel Optane DC persistent memory (PM), available in a DIMM package on the memory bus enabling programs to directly access data in non-volatile memory from the CPU using load and store instructions, provides an order of magnitude higher capacity than DRAM (e.g., 8x) and offers performance within an order of magnitude of DRAM, e.g., write latency as low as 80 ns and read latency around 170 ns . More recently, CXL, an open, industry-supported interconnect based on PCI Express (PCIe) interface , offers a general interface for disaggregating various types of storage devices (e.g., DRAM, PM, and PCIe devices) to the CPU with memory-like, byte-addressable interface (i.e., via the CXL.mem protocol); it allows cache-line granularity access to the connected devices and maintains data coherency and consistency by the underlying hardware. Real-world CXL-based memory offers comparable memory access latency (<2x) and throughput (∼similar-to\\sim50%) to local DRAM . CXL memory (or PM), with high throughput and low latency, is often treated as an extension of local DRAM, similar to multi-socket Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) nodes. Hence, a tiering based approach is commonly used to manage such a memory hierarchy. Indeed, state-of-the-art tiered memory systems, such as TPP , Memtis [ref]34, Nimble [ref]51, and AutoTiering, unanimously adopt tiering to exclusively manage data on different memory tiers, i.e., via dynamically migrating pages between fast/slow tiers to ensure efficient access to faster local DRAM. However, CXL-based tiered memory has its unique characteristics.\nCXL memory dramatically increases the capacity of local DRAM, accommodating a broader array of applications with data distributed across both fast and slow memory tiers. As data temperature changes over time , more frequent data migrations would occur in CXL-based memory tiers. It is especially true when the fast-tier memory is under pressure and incapable of holding all hot data. A high frequency of data migration can cause memory thrashing, hurting overall system performance.\nAs depicted in Figure 1, the involvement of TPP  in page migration (i.e., TPP in progress) has a significant, negative impact on the performance of a memory-intensive workload. In comparison, when most of the hot data have been moved to the fast tier (i.e., TPP stable with the 10GB WSS), the workload achieves higher performance than the case without TPP (i.e., No migration). However, if the hot data is larger than the size of the fast tier (the 24GB WSS case), memory thrashing happens, leading to extremely poor performance (i.e., TPP stable with the 24GB WSS).\nFurthermore, given that CXL-based lower-tier memory can substantially exceed the size of local DRAM , the advantage of storing data exclusively for the sake of efficient memory usage becomes less compelling. Instead, more focus should be placed on reducing the overhead when frequent page migration occurs. Insight 1: In tiered memory systems, adopting an exclusive, NUMA-like approach for data management can be less effective, particularly when the fast-tier memory cannot accommodate all the hot data.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: fast access.
