      "content": "Paper Title: Tracking the Persistence of Harmonic Chains: Barcode and Stability\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are two primary tasks in topological data analysis (TDA)   : reconstruction and inference.\nIn a typical TDA pipeline, the data is given as a point cloud in ℝNsuperscriptℝ𝑁{\\mathbb{R}}^{N}.\nA “geometric shape” K𝐾K in ℝNsuperscriptℝ𝑁{\\mathbb{R}}^{N} is reconstructed from the point cloud, usually as a simplicial complex, and K𝐾K is taken to represent the (unknown) space X𝑋X from which the data is sampled.\nX𝑋X is then studied using K𝐾K as a surrogate for properties that are invariant under invertible mappings (technically, homeomorphisms).\nThe deduced “topological shape” is not specific to the complex K𝐾K or the space X𝑋X, but is a feature of the homeomorphism type of K𝐾K or X𝑋X.\nFor example, a standard round circle has the same topological shape as any closed loop such as a knot in the Euclidean space.\nAlthough topological properties of X𝑋X alone are not sufficient to reconstruct X𝑋X exactly, they are among a few global features of X𝑋X that can be inferred from the data sampled from X𝑋X. An (ordinary) persistence barcode  [ref]31 (or equivalently, a persistence diagram   ) captures the evolution of homological features in a filtration constructed from a simplicial complex K𝐾K.\nIt consists of a multi-set of intervals in the extended real line, where the start and end points of an interval (i.e., a bar) are the birth and death times of a homological feature in the filtration.\nEquivalently, a persistence diagram is a multi-set of points in the extended plane, where a point in the persistence diagram encodes the birth and death time of a homological feature. A main drawback of ordinary persistent homology is that it does not provide canonical choices of geometric representatives for each bar in the barcode.\nSpecifically, there are two levels of choices in assigning representatives for bars in a persistence barcode: first, we choose a basis for persistent homology in a consistent way across the filtration; second, we choose a cycle representative inside each homology class in the basis. Both levels of choices involve choosing among significantly distinct geometric features of data to represent the same bar in the barcode. Since such choices are not canonical, it can be challenging to interpret their underlying geometric meaning. In addition, while existing works  [ref]25  compute optimal representatives for ordinary persistence, the optimality would rely on a choice of weights for the simplices and on the optimality criterion, leading to different shapes. Moreover, computing the optimal representatives is NP-hard in many interesting situations    [ref]12   [ref]25. As our first contribution, we introduce a new type of barcode called harmonic chain barcode. This barcode is obtained by tracking the birth and death of harmonic chains in an increasing filtration.\nSince there is always a unique harmonic chain in a homology class, the harmonic representatives in our harmonic chain barcode immediately remove the second level of choices in a natural way. The main idea is to take the harmonic chain groups along an increasing filtration, and to observe that the groups grow or shrink due to the birth and death of harmonic chains, resulting in a zigzag module with inclusion maps.\nLike any zigzag module , the module of harmonic chain groups decomposes into interval modules, which then form the harmonic chain barcode.\nMoreover, since the maps in this zigzag module are essentially inclusions,\neach representative for a bar in our harmonic chain barcode consists of a single harmonic chain which is alive over the entire bar. We emphasize that our harmonic chain barcode is distinct from the ordinary persistence barcode; see for example Figs. 1 and 2. The ordinary persistence barcode is shown to be stable , which is crucial for applications. The stability means that small changes in the data imply only small changes in the barcode. For our second contribution, we show that our harmonic chain barcode is also stable in the same sense as the stability of persistence barcode . Finally, we present an algorithm for computing\nthe harmonic chain barcode in O​(m3)𝑂superscript𝑚3O(m^{3}) time for a filtration of size m𝑚m,\nmatching the complexity of practical algorithms for ordinary persistence. The interpretation of homological features is crucial for applications such as extracting hierarchical structures of amorphous solids  and quantifying the growing branching architectures of plants .\nSuch an interpretation is closely related to the existence of canonical chain representatives for a barcode.\nIn our harmonic chain barcode, using orthogonality, each bar enjoys a canonical choice of representative (within a homology class) which lives exactly at the time-interval of the bar. This arguably promises a more interpretable data feature. Therefore, we expect our harmonic chain barcodes to enrich the family of topological descriptors in applications where ordinary persistence barcode is used, such as feature vectorization and machine learning. Note that just from the fact that our barcode is different from the ordinary persistence one cannot argue in favor or against our suggested barcode. Such a comparison is only meaningful in a specific domain of application and when performed using experimental evaluations. We refer to  for an interesting pipeline of data analysis using extra properties of harmonic chains.  also contains a method of propagating the information from harmonic chains back to original data points which we find also relevant to our harmonic representatives.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: of X𝑋X alone are not sufficient to reconstruct X𝑋X exactly, they are among a few global features of X𝑋X that can be inferred from the data sampled from X𝑋X.
