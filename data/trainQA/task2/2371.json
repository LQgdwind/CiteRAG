      "content": "Paper Title: Hierarchical Neural Dynamic Policies\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConsider the tasks such as pouring liquid or scooping beans as shown in Figure 1. These tasks are dynamic in nature, i.e., they require the robot to continuously apply the right forces and accelerations to act in a reactive manner to changes in the environment. Unlike quasi-static tasks, e.g. pushing or 2D grasping, where it can take arbitrarily long in between each action, the robot needs to reason at the whole trajectory level to execute a swift motion to perform dynamic tasks. For instance, if the robot scoops the beans too slowly they will fall back into the bowl, or if scooped too quickly the beans will be thrown out of the bowl. A common way to address this trajectory-level reasoning is to encode robot movements using nonlinear dynamical systems, like the ones that govern the flow of heat or the movement of planets. This idea is encapsulated by a family of methods known as Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs)  [ref]12, which can compactly represent basic building block trajectories that are then stitched together to perform complex tasks. DMPs restrict the space of permissible robot movements by constraining the robot’s goal and trajectory shape to obey a parametric nonlinear differential equation, consistent with the robot’s kinematics and dynamics. This allows DMPs to effectively reason in the space of entire trajectories, rather than at the level of individual actions. Consequently, these approaches have led to impressive demos such as pancake flipping , dart throwing  or playing table tennis 3. However, this class of approaches suffers from two drawbacks – (a) Generalization: Because of the constraints they impose on trajectories, DMPs do not have the power to represent general movements, and limit the controller to small variations in the initial or goal states. (b) Image-Observations: DMPs have mostly been built on estimating state vectors and struggle with high-dimension input, such as raw images. These shortcomings are in contrast to the flexibility allowed by deep learning methods in terms of generalization to unseen scenarios and scalability to high-dimensional image inputs   1 . However, most of the real robot results using deep learning methods are still limited to pick and place-style quasi-static tasks, as compared to the dynamic tasks achieved by DMP-based methods. In this paper, our goal is to address the following question: can we build generalizable robot policies for dynamic tasks by combining the ability of DMPs to reason in the space of trajectory distributions, with the ability of modern deep robot learning methods to learn from unstructured image data? Recent works  5 address this via Neural Dynamic Policies (NDPs)  by embedding structure of a nonlinear dynamical system as a differentiable layer within the policy network and training end-to-end. However, similar to DMPs, these methods still struggle to generalize to unseen state configurations. Why is that? Consider the examples in Figure 1 where we see a large diversity in the location and pose of objects. Depending on the initial state of the robot and the location of the containers, the joint trajectories will need to be diverse enough in terms of reachability and dynamics, to successfully perform the task of pouring or scooping. Hence, a direct attempt to fit a single policy to all these trajectories poses a big practical challenge in optimization which is further aggravated when the input is a high-dimensional image – which we argue is the case in most interesting real-world robotic problems. Our solution is to harness the individual strengths of both dynamical systems for movement representations and deep network policies.\nInstead of directly fitting a single policy on diverse scenarios, we fit dynamical system-based policies first in local regions of the task space and then distill them together into a global one. Our system consists of a library of local NDPs  and a single global NDP. Each local NDP exploits the strengths of DMPs: (a) overfit to operate in small regions of the task space and ensure task success at all times; (b) operate on privileged low-level state information as input. The global NDP is meant to operate on the entire space and only receives raw sensory data as input, e.g., raw images. This global policy is trained to not only maximize the task performance but also to imitate the behavior of the local policies. The key here is that both local and global policies have different objectives: local policies place importance on task success in their local regions, and the global policy places importance on learning from images in a generalizable manner. Owing to this local-to-global structure, we call our framework Hierarchical Neural Dynamic Policies (H-NDPs). Training H-NDPs for real-world robot learning comes with a practical challenge: there is no guarantee that the local trajectories distilled by the global NDP will indeed be successful when tried even on the same local locations as training unless it is completely overfitting in which case it will not generalize to new locations. Instead of hoping it to just work, we perform multiple iterations of this local-to-global procedure by re-training local NDPs by solving local tasks while being faithful to the global NDPs and then distilling the refined local ones into a new global NDP until convergence, as shown in Figure 2. Such an iterative process is standard practice in general   3 to prevent the distilled network from diverging. However, the added advantage of H-NDPs is that the embedded dynamical system enhances both safety, convergence, and overall performance, as we show in the results section later. One of the big contributions of this paper is an exhaustive experimental evaluation of H-NDPs and several other baselines on real-world tasks of writing, scooping, and pouring with a robot. Our real-world experiments are conducted in realistic settings with raw high-dimensional images as inputs, with large variations in object positions and goal locations, involving several hundred hours of robot interaction. Finally, we also evaluate complex simulated tasks like throwing, catching, and picking. We show that H-NDPs achieve state-of-the-art performance across all the tasks in reinforcement as well as imitation learning settings.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: nonlinear dynamical systems, like the ones that govern the flow of heat or the movement of planets.
