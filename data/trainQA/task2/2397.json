      "content": "Paper Title: Intersectional Bias in Causal Language Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLanguage models are an important class of the neural networks that underpin Artificial Intelligence applications and services. They are responsible for automated linguistic capabilities such as sentiment analysis, question answering, translation, text-to-speech, speech recognition and auto-completion. Compared to rule-based and statistical methods, they exhibit superior performance in many of these tasks . As a consequence language models power a growing number of everyday digital services, from search (Google Search, Microsoft Bing) to smart assistants (Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri) and email auto-completion (Microsoft Outlook, Gmail). Such models utilise prior context to suggest likely successor terms in a language generation task. Generalised pre-trained models, such as the GPT class of models [ref]20   developed by OpenAI111https://openai.com/, have been shown to excel at predictive tasks. The release of GPT-2 models of increased size over the course of 2019  brought transformer-based language models and their capabilities to greater media and public attention (e.g. ). As the size, performance, capabilities and applications of such models grow, so too have concerns about prediction bias  [ref]26  and its social impacts  3. ‘Bias’ itself has varied meanings in the machine learning literature, and as discussed further below, here we limit discussion to measurable, systemic (non-random) and undesired differences in model predictions produced by input changes to one or more markers of social categories. Although a subject of considerable research in NLP and deep learning fields, bias remains a trenchant model characteristic, proving difficult to mitigate. Even when trained on large corpora and when comprising more than a hundred billion parameters, causal models continue to exhibit gender [ref]26, religion  and disability  bias. Despite acknowledging its importance   , scholars have paid less attention to intersectional bias in language models . One non-exclusive method for identifying intersectional bias involves detecting differences, through a metric such as sentiment or toxicity, between outputs involving multiple social category markers from outputs produced by any one of those markers alone. While the presence of differences in language models is unlikely to mirror precisely the diverse experiences of intersectional bias in social life, it is also unlikely that such differences exhibit obvious or consistent relationships (e.g. additive, multiplicative, single category maximum). As intersectionality theorists have suggested, prejudice does more than simply accumulate over each category of social difference or disadvantage. Rather the combination of categories can result both in different intensifications of negative bias and sentiment, and in qualitatively new forms of marginalization and stigmatization  . Measurement does not therefore exhaust intersectional bias identification, but can support future mitigation efforts. In addition, similar to  we aim to extend analysis of single-category bias to less studied categories such as disability. In examining disability as a single category and intersectionality, we consider how bias can manifest differently across and within impairment groups, including what the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities  terms “physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments”.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: (Microsoft Outlook, Gmail).
