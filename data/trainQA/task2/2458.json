      "content": "Paper Title: Fine-Grained Emotion Prediction by Modeling Emotion Definitions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEmotion recognition is an actively researched problem, with experts working on it from different fronts in artificial intelligence and cognitive science communities . The text-based challenge in emotion recognition has gained popularity in view of its practical and extensive applications.  evaluated customer satisfaction by comparing the linguistic characteristics of emotional expressions of positive and negative attitudes.  use Twitter data to predict mortality from Atherosclerotic Heart Disease (AHD). There has also been research on the use of emotions to predict personality traits  . There has been extensive research on representing emotions. These broadly fall into two categories: continuous values and discrete labels. The former is derived from the circumplex model proposed by [ref]34; the model states that the space of emotions is continuous, and the emotion experienced can be represented in three dimensions: valence, arousal, and dominance. Based on the circumplex model, various datasets have been created and annotated with three-dimensional continuous values, e.g., EmoBank  and fb-valence-arousal . There is no single agreed set of discrete emotion labels, giving rise to various emotion label sets. The most common ones are Ekman’s six emotions (anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise)  and Plutchik’s eight emotions (joy, trust, fear, surprise, sadness, disgust, anger, and anticipation) . Recent developments have shown that emotions in other modalities may be more fine-grained such as 24 in brief vocalization , 28 in facial expression , 12 in speech prosody . A similar fine-grained emotion label set (27 emotions and neutral) for text has been proposed by . The authors have created the largest manually annotated dataset (referred to as GoEmotions) of emotions in English (details in Section III). In this work, we propose new models for emotion recognition based on the GoEmotions dataset.  have proposed a Unified Dataset for recognizing emotions in text; they combine different emotion datasets into one with a common annotation schema. Transformers have dominated recent progress in the NLP community. [ref]18 introduced attention-based transformer architecture for machine translation which was later adapted to build powerful NLP models independently/jointly using encoder or/and decoder components of the proposed architecture. [ref]19 presented BERT, which outperformed existing baselines on eleven NLP tasks. The BERT model is based on the encoder component of transformers. It was pretrained on English Wikipedia, and BooksCorpus  using next sentence prediction (NSP) and masked language modeling (MLM) tasks. It was later fine-tuned with additional layers as needed to obtain state-of-the-art results on downstream NLP tasks. In recent years, there have been various attempts in emotion prediction that have used BERT as the base model or in ensemble with some other approach.  investigated the problem of emotion classification in code-switched documents using BERT. The task of emotion classification and constructing emotion lexicon was combined by  that improved emotion classification results on the Twitter dataset. The top three models at the recent EmotionX 2019  challenge for emotion recognition in text are BERT-based models. The baseline on GoEmotions is also on a BERT model with an added classifier layer fine-tuned on the dataset. In the general text classification task using a transformer-based model, an additional layer of a classifier is added to the model, and it is fine-tuned for the task at hand. Here, the semantics of the individual class and its relation with others is not leveraged. There have been some efforts made in this direction lately.  formalized the task of sentence classification as a question answering task where the description of category label and text were concatenated as input for a binary output of yes or no depending on whether the description was correct. This process required the presence of descriptions, and thus, hard attention was used, even during inference.  included four kinds of semantic knowledge (word embeddings, class descriptions, class hierarchy, and a general knowledge graph) in their framework to facilitate zero-shot text classification.  explicitly modeled label embeddings and their mutual correlations in emotion inference for ROC stories . Related to emotion recognition is the task of Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) which entails the identification of opinion polarity towards a specific aspect in a given comment.  transformed this into a sentence pair classification task with the concatenation of instance text to an auxiliary sentence constructed with respect to aspect.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: There has been extensive research on representing emotions.
