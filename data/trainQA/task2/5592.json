      "content": "Paper Title: Ultra-low Precision Multiplication-free Training for Deep Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in many AI applications. However, this success comes at the cost of training the models, which consumes substantial energy. For example, training a BERTbase model demands energy consumption of 948 k​w⋅h⋅𝑘𝑤ℎkw\\cdot h, which is more than the global average household electricity consumption per capita per year (731 k​w⋅h⋅𝑘𝑤ℎkw\\cdot h)   .\nFurthermore, the immense energy consumption of DNN training significantly increases carbon emissions, leading to a negative impact on the global climate  2 . Thus, reducing the energy consumption of training for DNNs is desperately required. In DNN training, the linear layers (including convolutional and fully-connected layers) consume the most energy because of the intense use of FP32 energy-consuming multiplication in multiply–accumulate (MAC).\nThe FP32 multiplication is energy-consuming partly because of its high precision.\nFor example, the energy consumption of an FP32 multiplication is approximately 4x higher than that of FP16 multiplication.\nThus, to obtain energy-efficient DNNs, there are many quantization methods replacing the full-precision multiplications with low-precision multiplications by quantization techniques. Some quantization methods start with the full-precision (FP32) pre-trained model  7, hence they cannot reduce the energy consumption of training. The other methods train models from scratch by quantizing the weights (W𝑊W), activations (A𝐴A), and activation gradients (G𝐺G) to 16-bit  0 or 8-bit 4  9 . Besides, the multiplication itself has significantly higher energy consumption than energy-efficient operations such as addition and bitwise shift. For example, the energy consumption of an INT32 multiplication is approximately 22x higher than that of an INT32 addition. Thus, there are multiplication-less methods that directly replace the multiplication with energy-efficient operations such as addition and bitwise shift\n 8 4  [ref]13  7 .\nMost of these works, such as INQ 8, ShiftCNN , and LogNN 4 also start with the FP32 pre-trained models rather than training from scratch so they cannot reduce the energy consumption of training.\nAmong the methods that can train from scratch  [ref]13 , AdderNet  replaces all of the FP32 multiplications in the linear layer with FP32 additions whose energy consumption is still higher than the fixed point operations.\nThe other works [ref]13  apply low-precision Power-of-Two (PoT) numbers, whose value is zero or power of 2, to replace a part of the multiplications in training with bitwise shifts and sign flip operations.\nHowever, they cannot replace all of the multiplications during forward or backward propagation. For example, DeepShift [ref]13 only converts W𝑊W to 5-bit PoT numbers because only the value range of W𝑊W can be limited to the representation range of their 5-bit PoT numbers. Similarly, LUQ  only converts G𝐺G to PoT numbers because their method cannot approximate distributions of W𝑊W and A𝐴A well. These methods cannot use one data format to represent each of W𝑊W, A𝐴A, and G𝐺G whose data ranges and distributions vary widely from each other, so they keep one-third of the multiplications in training. In summary, the existing quantization methods and multiplication-less methods cannot replace all of the FP32 multiplications during both forward and backward propagation with low-precision energy-efficient operations. Thus the training energy consumption savings of all these works are limited, as shown in Figure 1. In this work, we propose a Multiplication-Free MAC (MF-MAC) to replace the FP32 multiplication with an INT4 addition and a 1-bit XOR operation, which are significantly more energy-efficient than the existing methods. To support the MF-MAC, we propose an Adaptive Layer-wise Scaling PoT Quantization (ALS-PoTQ) method that accommodates all the data range of W𝑊W, A𝐴A, and G𝐺G to convert them to unified 5-bit PoT numbers. It is also important to note that the proposed ALS-PoTQ method does not introduce extra multiplications while the exiting methods 4  9   introduce multiplications when quantizing data. Thus, all of the operations in the proposed MF-MAC and ALS-PoTQ are energy-efficient. In addition, to keep training stable and improve accuracy, we propose a Weight Bias Correction (WBC) technique to correct the bias of W𝑊W, and a Parameterized Ratio Clipping (PRC) technique to avoid the rigid resolution problem of A𝐴A. These two techniques also do not introduce extra multiplications. Finally, by combing all of the above techniques, the complete multiplication-free training scheme replaces all of the multiplications during forward and backward propagation with unified energy-efficient operations, which the existing methods cannot achieve. Applying our multiplication-free training scheme, we conduct experiments for AlexNet 1, ResNet18 , ResNet50  models on ImageNet  and Transformer model on the WMT En-De task, achieving an accuracy degradation of less than 1%.\nCompared with FP32 training, we reduce up to 95.8% of the energy consumption in linear layers during training with negligible accuracy degradation.\nTo sum up, our method significantly outperforms the existing methods for both energy efficiency and accuracy, as shown in Figure 1.\nTo the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to replace all of the multiplications with low-precision additions during both forward and backward propagation in DNN training. Our contributions can be listed as follows: We propose a Multiplication-free MAC (MF-MAC) with an Adaptive Layer-wise Scaling PoT Quantization (ALS-POTQ) method to replace the FP32 multiplication in MAC with an INT4 addition and an XOR operation. We propose two multiplication-free techniques, Weight Bias Correction (WBC) and Parameterized Ratio Clipping (PRC), that can keep training stable and improve accuracy. Our method reduces up to 95.8% of the energy consumption in linear layers during training compared with FP32 training with an accuracy degradation of less than 1%. It significantly outperforms other methods for both energy -efficiency and accuracy results.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: higher than that of an INT32 addition.
