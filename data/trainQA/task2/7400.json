      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Improved Imbalance Robustness in Continual Multi-Label Learning with Dual Output Spiking Architecture (DOSA)\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUnlike typical scenarios considered in the supervised learning literature, data arrives as a stream of samples in the real world. Continual Learning (CL) algorithms are designed to learn from such data streams [ref]1. Generally, CL algorithms are trained on data associated with a single task at a time. Most existing CL algorithms use task identity information for training and inference [ref]2 . In the real world, a single sample can get associated with several labels over time. For instance, an image shared on social media may receive diverse annotations from various users over time. As a result, a sample may acquire new labels in subsequent tasks while retaining its original labels , making it challenging to predict a sample‚Äôs label set based only on task identity. Further, it is impractical to store all the past samples for replay. Such cases involve more imbalance than their multi-class counterparts , making the existing continual learning methods unsuitable for learning from multi-label data streams. Thus, there is a need for models equipped with task-agnostic learning and inference mechanisms, particularly in the context of continual multi-label learning. Ideally, these models should not rely on samples stored from previous tasks for replay. The fields of continual learning (CL) and multi-label learning (MLL) have been well-studied in the literature [ref]1 . Continual multi-label learning (CMLL) is a more recent research area  . These ANN-based approaches tend to be computationally heavy. At the same time, effectively handling imbalance and learning from samples with no currently available labels continue to be major challenges in CMLL. Although the latter issue has been addressed to some extent in [ref]8, CMLL performance can be further improved by addressing data imbalance. One way of doing it is to incorporate measures of the model‚Äôs classification confidence into the loss function . The loss functions proposed in [ref]8 lack this property. On the other hand, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have recently emerged as an energy-efficient  alternative to ANNs. Their energy efficiency is attributed to the use of sparse binary events called spikes. Learning algorithms currently available in the literature for training SNNs are inspired by Spike Time Dependent Plasticity (STDP)    to gradient-based spikeprop   . Several CL algorithms have also been proposed for SNNs  . However, accurate multi-labeled classification and task-agnostic CMLL with SNNs is still an open research problem. To address the above-mentioned research gaps, this work proposes a dual output SNN architecture (DOSA) empowered with an imbalance-aware loss function for improved MLL and task-agnostic CMLL. DOSA also addresses accurate multi-labeled output prediction with SNNs. The proposed loss function (‚Ñíf‚Äãm‚Äãmsubscript‚Ñíùëìùëöùëö\\mathcal{L}_{fmm}) incorporates the model‚Äôs classification confidence to improve robustness towards imbalance. ‚Ñíf‚Äãm‚Äãmsubscript‚Ñíùëìùëöùëö\\mathcal{L}_{fmm} trains DOSA in a maximum margin framework while learning a margin value for each class. This trainable margin adapts to the data imbalance, possibly preventing the model from making overly confident predictions. A modified F1 score (inverse-weighted averaged F1 score Fi‚Äãwsubscriptùêπùëñùë§F_{iw}) is developed to evaluate model performance on imbalanced data. The effectiveness of ‚Ñíf‚Äãm‚Äãmsubscript‚Ñíùëìùëöùëö\\mathcal{L}_{fmm} in handling data imbalance is first established by MLL experiments on several benchmark multi-label datasets. The Yeast and the Flags datasets yield the maximum improvements on the micro, and the macro averaged F1 scores, respectively. The Yeast dataset also obtains the maximum improvement on the inverse-weighted averaged F1 score. DOSA attains better CMLL performance with ‚Ñíf‚Äãm‚Äãmsubscript‚Ñíùëìùëöùëö\\mathcal{L}_{fmm} on the Flags, Virus, Scene, Human, and Eukaryote datasets than CIFDM .\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: scenarios considered in the supervised learning literature, data arrives as a stream of samples in the real world.
