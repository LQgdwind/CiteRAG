The skeleton-based video anomaly detection can be classified into supervised 1 and unsupervised learning approaches 2 6.\nThe latter approaches 2 6 identify the abnormal actions under the assumption that normal actions can be observed regularly, and such data can be gathered easily.\nThese methods do not require manual labeling of the training dataset.\nComparing the observed and reconstructed human skeleton sequences during the inference phase allows them to identify abnormal behavior.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: the pixel change  or the optical flow .\nDue to the DNNs’ recent advancements, 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are now being used to extract spatio-temporal features in a data-driven fashion [ref]37  .\nOn the other hand, the skeleton-based approaches 2 6 1 concentrate on the DNN architecture, such as recurrent neural networks 2 1 or GNNs 6, to model the motion features from input human\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
