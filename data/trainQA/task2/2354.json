      "content": "Paper Title: A Simple Reward-free Approach to Constrained Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn a wide range of modern reinforcement learning (RL) applications, it is not sufficient for the learning agents to only maximize a scalar reward. More importantly, they must satisfy various constraints. For instance, such constraints can be the physical limit of power consumption or torque in motors for robotics tasks ; the budget for computation and the frequency of actions for real-time strategy games [ref]28; and the requirement for safety, fuel efficiency and human comfort for autonomous drive [ref]16. In addition, constraints are also crucial in tasks such as dynamic pricing with limited supply  , scheduling of resources on a computer cluster , imitation learning [ref]26  , as well as reinforcement learning with fairness . These huge demand in practice gives rise to a subfield—constrained RL, which focuses on designing efficient algorithms to find near-optimal policies for RL problems under linear or general convex constraints. Most constrained RL works directly combine the existing techniques such as value iteration and optimism from unconstrained literature, with new techniques specifically designed to deal with linear constraints    or general convex constraints  . The end product is a single new complex algorithm which is tasked to solve all the challenges of learning dynamics, exploration, planning as well as constraints satisfaction simultaneously. Consequently, these algorithms need to be re-analyzed from scratch, and it is highly nontrivial to translate the progress made in the unconstrained RL to the constrained setting. On the other hand, reward-free RL—proposed in —is a framework for the unconstrained setting, which learns the transition dynamics without using the reward. The framework has two phases: in the exploration phase, the agent first collects trajectories from a Markov decision process (MDP) and learns the dynamics without a pre-specified reward function. After exploration, the agent is tasked with computing near-optimal policies under the MDP for a collection of given reward functions. This framework is particularly suitable when there are multiple reward functions of interest, and has been developed recently to attack various settings including tabular MDPs  , linear MDPs  , and tabular Markov games . In this paper, we propose a simple approach to solve constrained RL problems by bridging the reward-free RL literature and constrained RL literature. Our approach isolates the challenges of constraint satisfaction, and leaves the remaining RL challenges such as learning dynamics and exploration to reward-free RL. This allows us to design a new algorithm which purely focuses on addressing the constraints. Formally, we design a meta-algorithm for RL problems with general convex constraints.\nOur meta-algorithm takes a reward-free RL solver, and can be used to directly solve the approachability problem, as well as the constrained MDP problems using very small amount of samples in addition to what is required for reward-free RL. Our framework enables direct translation of any progress in reward-free RL to constrained RL. Leveraging recent advances in reward-free RL, our meta-algorithm directly implies sample-efficient guarantees of constrained RL in the settings of tabular MDP, linear MDP, as well as tabular two-player Markov games. In particular, Tabular setting: Our work achieves sample complexity of 𝒪~​(min⁡{d,S}​H4​S​A/ϵ2)~𝒪𝑑𝑆superscript𝐻4𝑆𝐴superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\min\\{d,S\\}H^{4}SA/\\epsilon^{2}) for all three tasks of reward-free RL for Vector-valued MDPs (VMDP), approachability, and RL with general convex constraints. Here d𝑑d is the dimension of VMDP or the number of constraints, S,A𝑆𝐴S,A are the number of states and actions, H𝐻H is the horizon, and ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon is the error tolerance. It matches the best existing results up to a factor of H𝐻H. Linear setting: Our work provides new sample complexity of 𝒪~​(dlin3​H6/ϵ2)~𝒪superscriptsubscript𝑑lin3superscript𝐻6superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d_{\\text{lin}}^{3}H^{6}/\\epsilon^{2}) for all three tasks above for linear MDPs. There has been no prior sample-efficient result in this setting. Two-player setting: Our work extends to the setting of tabular two-player vector-valued Markov games and achieves\nlow regret of α​(T)=𝒪​(ϵ/2+H2​ι/T)𝛼𝑇𝒪italic-ϵ2superscript𝐻2𝜄𝑇\\alpha(T)=\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon/2+\\sqrt{H^{2}\\iota/T}) at the cost of this 𝒪​(ϵ)𝒪italic-ϵ\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon) bias in regret as well as additional samples for preprocessing.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: such constraints can be the physical limit of power consumption or torque in motors for robotics tasks ; the budget for computation and the frequency of actions for real-time strategy games [ref]28; and the requirement for safety, fuel efficiency and human comfort for autonomous drive [ref]16.
