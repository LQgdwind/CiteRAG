      "content": "Paper Title: Hyperparameter Sensitivity in Deep Outlier Detection Analysis and a Scalable Hyper-Ensemble Solution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUnsupervised Outlier Detection (OD). \nThere exists a large pool of what-is-now-called traditional, i.e. not deep learning based, OD methods  0. These methods work with the original features or subspaces thereof, and typically exhibit just one or two hyperparameters (HPs).\\@footnotemark\nWith recent advances in deep learning, there has been a boom in deep OD models, as those can learn new task-dependent feature representations and directly optimize an OD objective. Despite their short history, multiple surveys have been published that aim to cover this fast-growing literature   6.\nWhile deep OD models have been shown to outperform their traditional counterparts, they exhibit a much longer list of (typically 4-8) HPs (e.g. depth, width, dropout, weight decay, learning rate, epochs, etc. besides other model-specific HPs) that makes them very challenging to tune in unsupervised settings. Model Selection in Unsupervised OD: Prior (Black) Art. \nAt large, unsupervised outlier model selection remains to be a vastly understudied,\nyet extremely important area.\nVarious evaluation studies have reported traditional detectors to be quite\nsensitive to their HP choices\n [ref]8 7, raising concern for the fair evaluation and comparison of different models.\nEarlier work on automatically selecting HPs are limited to one-class models 4  .\nMore recently, general-purpose internal (i.e., unsupervised) model evaluation heuristics have been proposed 5 9 ,\nwhich solely rely on the input data (without labels) and the output (i.e., outlier scores). MetaOD  employs meta-learning to transfer information from similar historical tasks to a new task for model selection, which has only been tested on traditional OD models.\nDifferent from those that aim to select a single model, ensemble models have also been employed for OD , including those that combine models from the same family 6 as well as heterogeneous\ndetectors from different families 3. Regarding deep OD methods,\nwe have surveyed a large collection of recent papers and their experimental testbed and HP settings, a summary of which is given in Appx. A.1 Table 8.\nTo our surprise, we found hardly any discussion on model selection, with only a few work presenting sensitivity analysis with respect to not all but some, model-specific HPs.\nWhile some work reserve labeled validation/hold-out data to tune a subset of the HPs  8 3,\nmajority of them fix the HP values and call them “recommended”/default settings [ref]5 1 7 8  .\nMoreover, a non-negligible number of existing work choose some critical HPs empirically on test data (!) to yield optimum results  5 8 (See Table 8, last column).\nSome work that builds on previous models (e.g., deep SVDD-based methods 5 vs. multi-sphere extension 3, transformation-based methods\n6 for images\nvs. their extension to vector data\n[ref]5, AnoGAN 7 and the follow-up EGBAD ) use the same architecture and HP settings as the prior work for consistent/“fair” comparison. However it is unlikely that the same HP values would work comparably for different models. Admittedly, it is challenging to tune (a long list of) HPs in the absence of labels, yet, the opacity in the deep OD literature warrants careful investigation on the stability of model performance under varying HP settings, and ultimately on the fair comparison between these and traditional OD methods.\n Deep Model Ensembles.  Recently, deep NN predictions have been found to be often poorly calibrated 0. As Bayesian learning does not offer straightforward training, deep ensemble models have been proposed as a simple alternative 5 to improve predictive uncertainty, as well as efficient ways of training deep NN ensembles 9 2.\nIn this work, we leverage ensemble modeling toward a different goal: to improve the stability and robustness of unsupervised OD models to HP settings, combining predictions from models with different HPs into an OD\nhyper-ensemble.\nThe closest to our work is Wenzel et al.’s deep hyper-ensemble\n3, which, different from ours, considers supervised problems, to further foster diversity in the ensemble and thereby achieve better uncertainty estimation.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: outlier model selection remains to be a vastly understudied,\nyet extremely important area.\nVarious evaluation studies have reported traditional detectors to be quite\nsensitive to their HP choices\n [ref]8 7, raising concern for the fair evaluation and comparison of different models.\nEarlier work on automatically selecting HPs are limited to one-class models 4  .\nMore recently, general-purpose\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
