      "content": "Paper Title: Affordance Transfer Learning for Human-Object Interaction Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHICO-DET  dataset consists of 38,118 images in the training set and 9,658 test images over 600 types of interactions (80 object categories in COCO dataset and 117 unique verbs) with over 90,000 HOI instances. HOI-COCO is built from the V-COCO dataset [ref]13, which contains 10,346 images with 16,199 person instances. Each annotated person in V-COCO has binary labels for 26 different actions. V-COCO mainly focuses\non verb recognition, and has limited object categories (only\ntwo). Thus we construct a new benchmark HOI-COCO for the evaluation of verb-object pairs as follows. We use 21 actions from all 26 actions in V-COCO (\\ie, five non-interaction actions, “walk”, “run, “smile”, “stand” and “point ”, are removed). As a result, we build HOI-COCO benchmark with 222 HOI categories over 21 verbs and 80 objects. Meanwhile, we use the same train/val split in V-COCO for HOI-COCO. Similar to HICO-DET , we evaluate the performance on HOI-COCO under three different settings: Full (222 types), Rare (97 types), and NonRare (115 types). The HOI type in Rare category contains less than 10 training instances, and the distribution of HOI categories is long-tailed. COCO  dataset is a widely-used benchmark for common object detection with 80 different object classes. Considering that both HICO-DET  and HOI-COCO consist of the same object label sets to COCO, we thus directly incorporate the COCO dataset as the additional object dataset in our experiments. Object365 1 is a recently proposed large-scale common object detection dataset with 365 object categories. The domain of Object365 is different from COCO . In detail, we select objects that are labeled as COCO classes from Object365 validation dataset to evaluate the affordance recognition of objects on new domain. Meanwhile, we choose 12 new types of objects and label manually the affordance of those objects according to the HICO-DET and HOI-COCO, respectively. Those objects are used to evaluate affordance recognition on new types of objects. See more details in supplementary materials. Evaluation Metrics.\nWe follow the standard evaluation metric  9 and report mean average precision for HICO-DET dataset  and HOI-COCO. A prediction is a true positive only when the detected human and object bounding boxes have IoUs larger than 0.5 with reference to ground truth, and the HOI category is accurately predicted. Object affordance recognition is a multiple label classification problem (\\iean object usually has multiple affordances). Thus, we compare Precision, Recall and F1-Score for evaluating object affordance recognition.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: set and 9,658 test images over 600 types of interactions (80 object categories in COCO dataset and 117 unique verbs) with over 90,000 HOI instances.
