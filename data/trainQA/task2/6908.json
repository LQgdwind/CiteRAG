      "content": "Paper Title: FedCiR: Client-Invariant Representation Learning for Federated Non-IID Features\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFL under data heterogeneity:\nFL was originally proposed by McMahan et al. [ref]1 as a distributed training paradigm to train a global model without disclosing local private data.\nHowever, the statistical heterogeneity, which adversely affects the convergence and accuracy performance  , quickly emerged as a major obstacle in FL.\nTo address this issue, many works added proximal terms to regularize local objective functions with the global knowledge [ref]23   [ref]25.\nFor instance, FedProx [ref]25 included a regularizer into local training to force the local updates to get close to the global model.\nFedDyn [ref]23 proposed a dynamic regularizer for each client to ensure the consistency between the stationary points of local and global empirical loss.\nIn addition, MOON  utilized contrastive learning to reduce the distance between representations output by the global and local models to correct the local training.\nThese methods, however, cannot fundamentally eliminate the data heterogeneity and may encounter the performance bottleneck in extreme cases with highly heterogeneous data distributions . Moreover, instead of pushing local parameters to trace the global parameters, some methods    attempted to align the intermediate features between clients through the global prototypes, which are computed by averaging the features for each class locally and aggregating them among clients at the server.\nHowever, the local prototypes suffer from overfitting problems with data heterogeneity, and naively aggregating them leads to imprecise global prototypes.\nIn contrast, this work aims to align the representation distributions of clients with a global representation distribution, which is approximated by maximizing the consensus among local classifiers due to its absence in FL, thus improving training stability and efficiency. Another research line for data heterogeneity relies on data augmentation  .\nMany studies attempted to generate and share synthetic data using a generative model    or a mixup mechanism .\nNevertheless, recklessly sharing synthetic samples raises extra privacy concerns.\nTo mitigate potential privacy leakage, recent approaches have developed data-free knowledge distillation mechanisms to generate auxiliary data with a generative model at the server, which can be used for global model calibration  and local model updating  .\nThese methods, however, required clients to upload the training data distributions to the server to optimize the feature generator, which is excessively vulnerable to gradient inversion attacks . Different from them, we utilize the ensemble predictions of local classifiers to train the feature generator without extra local information leakage.\nMore importantly, we further utilize the generator to estimate the global representation distribution for client-invariant representation extraction, which benefits solving the feature shift problem. Domain-invariant representation learning:\n\nDomain-invariant representation learning has been proven effective for domain adaptation and generalization by reducing the discrepancy between source and target domains .\nAdversarial learning is a widely used mechanism to learn the domain-invariant features by gradually disentangling the irrelevant and domain-specific features via additional discriminators   .\nThe adversarial networks are able to push representation distributions of different domains to be the same, thereby enabling domain-invariant representation learning.\nFedADA  and FedADG  adopted this technique to effectively solve domain adaptation and domain generalization problems, respectively, in FL.\nHowever, due to the limited domains of data in each device, they demanded to train additional generators to generate the lacking domains of data for adversarial training, which aggravates the computation burden for devices. Another stream of methods for domain-invariant representation learning is explicit feature distribution alignment   , which can be achieved by minimizing the distance between source and target distributions   .\nHowever, these methods require the access to all the domains of data during the training process and thus are incompatible with FL.\nA recent work FedSR  used probabilistic networks to approximate feature distributions for clients and aligned them via iterative local updating and global aggregation.\nNevertheless, FedSR is sensitive to the client number and suffers from the local overfitting problem due to the distinct divergence of deterministic networks between clients caused by the non-IID data.\nInstead, this work approximates the global representation distribution with the ensemble predictions of local models at the server, thus improving the stability and effectiveness of feature distribution alignment.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: FL under data heterogeneity:\nFL was originally proposed by McMahan et al.
