      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to Scale Multilingual Representations for Vision-Language Tasks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets.\nSMALR is evaluated on bidirectional retrieval with Multi30K [ref]6 4  and MSCOCO   . The Multi30K dataset is built off of Flickr30K , which originally contained 31,783 images and five English descriptions per image. [ref]6 4  obtained annotations in German, French, and Czech, resulting in a four-language dataset. Multi30K contains five descriptions per image in English and German, but only one per image in French and Czech; the latter two were collected as human-generated translations of the English annotations. We use the 29K/1K/1K train/test/val splits from the original dataset . MSCOCO is approximately four times the size of Multi30K, with 123,287 images. There are five human-generated captions per image in English, but significantly fewer in Chinese and Japanese. YJ Captions  introduced Japanese annotations for MSCOCO, but only provides five captions per image for a subset of about 26K images.  extended MSCOCO with a total of 22,218 Chinese captions for 20,341 images. We use train/test/validation splits as defined in 3. We augment both datasets with machine translations so every image contains at least five sentences for ten languages: English, German, Czech, French, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Afrikaans, Korean, and Russian. All models we compare to are trained using this augmented training set. For languages with no human-generated sentences, we use machine translations at test time as well. We found using translations at test time did not affect the relative performance of different methods in our experiments. See the supplementary for details. Visual Features.\nWe use ResNet-152  features trained on ImageNet  as input to the Embedding Network (EmbN) . As done in 3, we average visual features over ten 448x448 image crops. This generates an image embedding of size 2048, which is then passed through a pair of fully connected layers. The resulting 512-D embedding can be used in the shared image-sentence embedding space. The learning rate was set to 1​e−31superscript𝑒31e^{-3} for the HEM and LA models; remaining hyperparameters are consistent with those in 3. Note that all LIWE  experiments use bottom-up Faster R-CNN  visual features trained on Visual Genome . This represents a significant increase in the annotation cost compared to our approach, which doesn’t use these annotations. Visual Genome also contains MSCOCO  images, which means that there is train/test contamination, as LIWE’s features are extracted using the pretrained, publicly available model from . Metrics.\nFor our results, we report the mean Recall (mR) across Recall@K𝐾K, with K∈  0𝐾1510K\\in  0, for both the image-sentence and sentence-image directions per language. All recall values can be found in the supplementary. We also provide an average mR across all languages to serve as a global performance metric: “A” in Tables 1 and 2. The human average, “HA,” refers to the average mR over the languages which have human-generated annotations (i.e. English, Chinese, and Japanese for MSCOCO, and English, German, French, and Czech for Multi30K). Comparative Evaluation. We compare the following methods: Frequency Thresholding: We drop words that occur fewer than t𝑡t times in the training set. Results are reported in Figure 3. PCA Reduction: We use PCA  to reduce the size of the initial 300-D FastText word embeddings. Results are reported in Figure 3. Dictionary Mapping: We map words that occur fewer than t𝑡t times in non-English languages to English using dictionaries 1. By mapping rare words in other languages to English, some information may be lost, but the token will still exist indirectly in the vocabulary. Results are reported in Figure 3. Language-Agnostic (LA): We compare to only using a latent vocabulary as described in Section 3.1 with 40K tokens, i.e. not using any language specific features. Results are in Tables 1 and 2. HEM: We evaluate our full hybrid embedding model (Section 3.1), which uses a mix of language-agnostic and language-specific representations. This baseline does not include MCLM nor CLC. Results are in Tables 1 and 2. SMALR: Our base SMALR is composed of the HEM (Section 3.1) and MCLM (Section 3.2) components of our model. We compare to our complete SMALR which makes use of CLC variants (CLC-A and CLC-C, described in Section 3.4). Results are in Tables 1 and 2. Note that the first line of Tables 1 and 2, Trans To En, refers to using machine translation on non-English sentences, and then using an English-only trained Embedding Network , providing a strong baseline method to compare to.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: Datasets.\nSMALR is evaluated on bidirectional retrieval with Multi30K [ref]6 4  and MSCOCO   .
