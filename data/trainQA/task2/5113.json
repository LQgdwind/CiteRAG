      "content": "Paper Title: VectorFusion: Text-to-SVG by Abstracting Pixel-Based Diffusion Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA few works have used pretrained vision-language models to guide vector graphic generation. VectorAscent [ref]11 and CLIPDraw  optimize CLIP’s image-text similarity metric  to generate vector graphics from text prompts, with a procedure similar to DeepDream  and CLIP feature visualization . StyleCLIPDraw  extends CLIPDraw to condition on images with an auxiliary style loss with a pretrained VGG16  model. Arnheim  parameterizes SVG paths with a neural network, and CLIP-CLOP  uses an evolutionary approach to create image collages. Though we also use pretrained vision-language models, we use a generative model, Stable Diffusion 1 rather than a discriminative model. Recent work has shown the success of text-to-image generation. DALL-E 2  learns an image diffusion model conditioned on CLIP’s text embeddings. Our work uses Stable Diffusion 1 (SD), a text-to-image latent diffusion model. While these models produce high-fidelity images, they cannot be directly transformed into vector graphics. A number of works generate vector graphics from input images. We extend the work of Layer-wise Image Vectorization (LIVE) , which iteratively optimizes closed Bézier paths with a differentiable rasterizer, DiffVG . We also take inspiration from inverse graphics with diffusion models. Diffusion models have been used in zero-shot for image-to-image tasks like inpainting . DDPM-PnP  uses diffusion models as priors for conditional image generation, segmentation, and more. DreamFusion [ref]26 uses 2D diffusion as an image prior for text-to-3D synthesis with a more efficient and high-fidelity loss than DDPM-PnP, discussed in Section 3.3. Following [ref]26, we use diffusion models as transferable priors for vector graphics. Concurrent work  also adapts the SDS loss for latent-space diffusion models.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: A few works have used pretrained vision-language models to guide vector graphic generation.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
