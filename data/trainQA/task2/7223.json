Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Introducing New Node Prediction in Graph Mining: Predicting All Links from Isolated Nodes with Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe model333Code is available at https://github.com/damianozanardini/nodePrediction/ to allow the interested researcher to use and extend our work. has been implemented by using PyTorch 2.0.1 and PyTorch Geometric 2.4.0.\nExperiments have been carried out on a ‚ÄúPay As You Go‚Äù subscription to Google Colab [ref]4, using the A100 GPU. A variety of standard GNN architectures have been used, namely GCN , ClusterGCN , GAT , and SAGE [ref]11. It is not possible to report on all the choices for the hyper-parameters. We only show the results of some significant experiments that can provide some insight into how the algorithm performs under different conditions.\nGNN architectures have been defined with five layers, and they compute node embeddings with dimensionality 128, which seems to be enough for the size of the graphs that we take into account (experiments have been carried out with different embedding sizes, with no significant improvements).\nData are fed to the Graph Neural Networks in batches of predefined size, proportional to the size of the graph; in turn, the number of nodes in the graph determines the number of positive and negative examples in the dataset. Unless otherwise specified, the maximum number of epochs is 50; early stopping is performed (with a default value for patience of 8 epochs) in a validation set that is 10% of the train set.\nThat is, if the loss in the validation set at epoch iùëñi is better than the loss at epochs i+1,‚Ä¶,i+8ùëñ1‚Ä¶ùëñ8i{+}1,...,i{+}8, then training is aborted, and the parameter values at iùëñi are kept instead of the newer ones. The following tables in Section 4.3 report on the experimental results. The meaning of each column is as follows: #nodes is |V|ùëâ|V|, i.e., the number of nodes in the graph; GNN is the GNN architecture (GCN, ClusterGCN, GAT, SAGE); train purity and test purity is the purity of train and test examples, respectively; in most examples, intermediate values for purity are used, namely,   [ref]10 for both train and test examples; however, see Section 4.3.5 for a discussion on how these values affect the precision of the model; lr is the learning rate (unless differently specified, lr=0.001lr0.001\\texttt{lr}=0.001) of the torch.optim.Adam optimizer ; train time is the training time in seconds; this does not include the time for generating positive and negative examples, that is, however, much smaller than the proper training time; accuracy, or acc., is the percentage of examples that are classified correctly at test time (mean of five executions of the test phase on different, randomly-generated sets of test examples); hits@k: the Hits@k metric for different values of kùëòk (mean of five executions of the test phase); the number of negative examples among which each positive example is ranked is given in each table; MRR is the mean reciprocal rank (mean of five executions of the test phase).\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: researcher to use and extend our work. has been implemented by using PyTorch 2.0.1 and PyTorch Geometric 2.4.0.\nExperiments have been carried out on a ‚ÄúPay As You Go‚Äù subscription to Google Colab [ref]4, using the A100 GPU.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
