      "content": "Paper Title: Hybrid-S2S: Video Object Segmentation with Recurrent Networks and Correspondence Matching\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we explain our hybrid architecture for VOS.\nWe build on top of the S2S model¬†, which is an RNN-based architecture and employ a dual mask propagation strategy that utilizes the spatio-temporal features from the RNN as well as correspondence matching to propagate the mask from time step t‚àí1ùë°1t-1 to tùë°t.\nMoreover, we integrate the features from the first frame as a reference throughout the sequence. The S2S model is composed of an encoder-decoder architecture with a memory module in the bottleneck to memorize the target object and obtain temporal consistency in the predicted segmentation masks.\nThe overall design of this method is illustrated in Figure¬†3.\nIn this model, the object masks are computed as in¬†: where xùë•x and yùë¶y refer to the RGB input image and the binary mask of the target object in the first frame. One of the main limitations of RNN-based models, such as S2S, is the fixed-sized memory, which can be insufficient to capture the whole sequence and long-term dependencies¬†[ref]2.\nTherefore, as the sequence length grows, access to information from earlier time steps decreases.\nThis issue, together with the vanishing gradient problem, adversely impacts the segmentation quality in longer sequences.\nThis problem is especially critical in sequences with occlusion, where the object of interest can be absent for an extended period. Another obstacle with this category of approaches is drift and error propagation.\nDue to the recurrent connection, the model output is fed back to the network;\nas a result, the prediction error propagates to the future, and erroneous model predictions affect the performance for future time steps.\nThis issue is another contributing factor to the performance drop in later frames. Hybrid Mask Propagation.\nBased on the challenges in the RNN-based models, we propose a hybrid architecture, combining the RNN output with information derived from correspondence matching.\nIn our model, the segmentation mask is predicted using the location prior obtained from the RNN, as well as similarity matching between the video frames at t‚àí1ùë°1t-1 and tùë°t.\nOur intuition is that the merits of using the spatio-temporal model from RNN-based models and the matching-based methods are complementary.\nIn situations where multiple similar objects are present in the scene, the matching-based approaches struggle to distinguish between the different instances.\nHence, the location prior provided by the spatio-temporal features from the RNN can resolve this ambiguity.\nMoreover, the information obtained from similarity matching provides a reliable measurement for propagating the segmentation mask to the next time step (as investigated in¬†[ref]43 for zero-shot VOS). Using this additional data helps the model reduce the prediction error, improving the drift problem, and obtaining better segmentation quality for longer sequences. To encode the frame at t‚àí1ùë°1t-1, we redefine the initializer network‚Äôs task in S2S to a reference encoder (as shown in Figure¬†3), initializing the hidden states of the RNN module with z‚Äãe‚Äãr‚Äão‚Äãsùëßùëíùëüùëúùë†zeros.\nIn our experiments, we observed that the initializer network does not play a crucial role, and it is possible to replace it with zero-initialization with little change in the performance. To perform the similarity matching between the RNN hidden state (htsubscript‚Ñéùë°h_{t}) and the reference encoder‚Äôs output features, one can use different techniques such as using the cosine distance between the feature vectors.\nHere, we follow the design in¬†[ref]39 and use a Global Convolution¬† to accomplish the task¬†(merge layer in Figure¬†3).\nGlobal Convolution¬†(GC) approximates a large kernel convolution layer efficiently with less number of parameters.\nThe large kernel size is essential to model both the local connections (as required for localization) and the dense global connections required for accurate classification (foreground, background).\nThis way, the model directly accesses the features from time steps 00 and t‚àí1ùë°1t-1.\nWe note that this operation can also be interpreted as self-attention; as,\nthe features at the current time step, which share a higher similarity to the object features from the reference frames, get a higher weight via the convolution operation in the merge layer. As shown in Figure¬†3, we do not use weight sharing between the Reference Encoder and the Encoder, as we observed a considerable performance drop in doing so.\nWe believe the underlying reason is that the functions approximated by these two modules are different;\nthe inputs to the Reference Encoder are aligned in time while the inputs to the Encoder are not.\nWe highlight that compared to S2S¬†, the only added element is the light-weight Merge Layer¬†(Figure¬†3).\nThe rest of the components remain unchanged, by modifying the task of the Initializer Network to Reference Encoder. Attention to the First Frame.\nAs suggested in¬† for the Video Prediction task, the first frame of the sequence is of significant importance as it contains the reference information which can be utilized for recovering from occlusion.\nWe note that by definition, the target object is present in the first frame.\nBy computing the correspondences between the object appearance after occlusion and in the first frame, the model is able to re-detect the target.\nAdditionally, [ref]43 [ref]39 demonstrate the effectiveness of using the first frame as an anchor or reference frame.\nIn¬†[ref]39, the authors propose a Siamese architecture that learns to segment the object of interest by finding the feature correspondences between the target object in the first frame and the current frame.\nAlthough this model‚Äôs performance suffers in scenarios with drastic appearance change, it reveals the importance of rigorously using the data in the first frame.\nWe use the same reference encoder and merge layer for integrating the first frame features.\nWe hypothesize that this modification can be considered as an attention mechanism¬†[ref]2, where the attention span is limited to the first frame.\nUsing attention is a standard solution to address this finite memory in the RNNs, by providing additional context to the memory module.\nThe context vector is usually generated from a weighted combination of the embeddings from all the time steps.\nHowever, in high-dimensional data such as video, it would be computationally demanding to store the features and compute all the frames‚Äô attention weights. The resulting architecture is shown in¬†Figure¬†3 and can be formulated as: where x and y are the RGB image and the binary segmentation mask, and ùüé‚ààRd0superscriptùëÖùëë\\bm{0}\\in R^{d} with dùëëd as the feature dimension.\nHere the merge layer is considered as part of the decoder. Training Objective.\nFor the loss function, we utilize a linear combination of the balanced Binary Cross-Entropy¬†(BCE) loss and an auxiliary loss¬†: The auxiliary task employed here is border classification.\nFor this task, a border class is assigned to each pixel based on its location with respect to the object boundary, where the boundary target classes are assigned based on a distance transform¬†2.\nThis term provides fine-grained location information for each pixel resulting in improved boundary detection FùêπF-score.\nFor more details, please refer to¬†. The balanced BCE loss is computed as in¬† : with XùëãX as input, W as the model parameters, Y+subscriptùëåY_{+} and Y‚àísubscriptùëåY_{-} standing for the foreground and background groundtruth labels, Œ≤=|Y‚àí|/|Y|ùõΩsubscriptùëåùëå\\beta=|Y_{-}|/|Y|, and |Y|=|Y‚àí|+|Y+|ùëåsubscriptùëåsubscriptùëå|Y|=|Y_{-}|+|Y_{+}|.\nThis loss addresses the data imbalance between the foreground and the background classes by the weighting factors Œ≤ùõΩ\\beta.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: object in the first frame.
