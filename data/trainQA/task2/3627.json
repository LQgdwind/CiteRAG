      "content": "Paper Title: Transfer Dynamics in Emergent Evolutionary Curricula\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA popular paradigm in machine learning is transfer learning, which rather than training from a randomly initialized model on the target task, instead first pre-trains the model on one or more source tasks. The idea is that shared problem structure between the source and target tasks is captured in what the model learns during training on the source tasks (e.g., captured in artificial neural networks’ (ANN) weights or Gaussian mixture models’ parameters ). Transfer learning exploits this shared structure to increase performance or decrease training time on the target task [ref]10[ref]11. The hope is that the pre-training search identifies a point on the surface of the optimization landscape that is close to points of high performance with respect to the target task [ref]13. While sub-fields of machine learning describe versions of transfer learning particular to the paradigm, the base components are a task ψisubscript𝜓𝑖\\psi_{i} and model θisubscript𝜃𝑖\\theta_{i}. Transfer learning for control problems often defines the task ψisubscript𝜓𝑖\\psi_{i} as a MDP Misubscript𝑀𝑖M_{i}. This MDP is defined by the tuple of functions that parameterize States, Actions, Transitions, Rewards, and the discount factor (𝒮isubscript𝒮𝑖\\mathcal{S}_{i}, 𝒜isubscript𝒜𝑖\\mathcal{A}_{i}, 𝒯isubscript𝒯𝑖\\mathcal{T}_{i}, ℛisubscriptℛ𝑖\\mathcal{R}_{i}, γisubscript𝛾𝑖\\gamma_{i}) . Typically an MDP Misubscript𝑀𝑖M_{i} is solved when a policy, πθi​(a|s)subscript𝜋subscript𝜃𝑖conditional𝑎𝑠\\pi_{\\theta_{i}}(a|s) – a learnable model with parameterization θisubscript𝜃𝑖\\theta_{i} mapping states to actions – maximizes the long-term discounted sum of rewards ∑k=t+1Tγk−t−1​rksuperscriptsubscript𝑘𝑡1𝑇superscript𝛾𝑘𝑡1subscript𝑟𝑘\\sum_{k=t+1}^{T}\\gamma^{k-t-1}r_{k} . An example of fine-tuning to task ψjsubscript𝜓𝑗\\psi_{j} from task ψisubscript𝜓𝑖\\psi_{i} is solving Mjsubscript𝑀𝑗M_{j} with πθisubscript𝜋subscript𝜃𝑖\\pi_{\\theta_{i}}. ψisubscript𝜓𝑖\\psi_{i} and ψjsubscript𝜓𝑗\\psi_{j} can differ in one or more of the five components of an MDP. Due to the larger definition of an MDP as a task, many different types of knowledge can be learned and transferred between tasks.\nWhen used in RL, Q-functions (often but not always represented as ANNs) provide information on how valuable an action is in a given state and can be transferred to untrained RL agents to speed up agent training [ref]13. Transferring knowledge (stored in DQNs) between various scenarios in 3D environments has proven helpful for generalizing agents to traverse unknown maps with unknown backgrounds in the VizDoom environment . If the laws that govern a system (e.g. physical laws like gravity) are consistent, then a learned dynamics model would conserve such knowledge even if objectives were to change . A policy indicates which actions are potentially useful, therefore one might transplant effective policies between tasks . Alternatively, transfer learning has been used in multi-agent settings to transfer policies between multiple agents in a shared simulation, e.g. StarCraft II . Transferring a policy into a new task/environment for additional fine-tuning is POET’s form of transfer learning; after POET creates a new agent-environment pair (thereby successively altering 𝒮isubscript𝒮𝑖\\mathcal{S}_{i} in the definition of an MDP), the agent will receive additional inner-loop optimization to adapt its policy to the new environment from the starting point of the parent’s behavioral policy. Continually complexifying various aspects of an initial simple MDP, thereby creating a regimen of tasks for the purpose of scaffolding agent skill acquisition, is known as curriculum learning. Specifically, Narvekar et al. define curriculum learning (in RL) as learning a directed acyclic graph of a set of MDPs  where the goal is to find the correct sequencing of experience/tasks such that policy πθi​(a|s)subscript𝜋subscript𝜃𝑖conditional𝑎𝑠\\pi_{\\theta_{i}}(a|s) can solve difficult tasks. This set of MDPs is often defined a priori, or, as in POET, generated on the fly. In POET, the generated MDP coevolves with respect to the agent performance.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: neural networks’ (ANN) weights or Gaussian mixture models’ parameters ). Transfer learning exploits this shared structure to increase performance or decrease training time on the target task [ref]10[ref]11.
