      "content": "Paper Title: Masked Spatio-Temporal Structure Prediction for Self-supervised Learning on Point Cloud Videos\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn physics, motion is the phenomenon in which position changes over time.\nBecause point clouds provide precise position information, i.e., 3D coordinates, point cloud videos, which evolve over time, can accurately describe the 3D motion in the real world.\nEffectively understanding point cloud videos can significantly improve intelligent agents on the interaction with environments.\nTherefore, the community has developed a few effective methods for point cloud video understanding, including video classification       and semantic segmentation    .\nHowever, most of these methods are based on supervised learning and that requires much effort to carefully annotate massive amounts of labels.\nMoreover, learning via only classification or segmentation may make deep neural networks take too much emphasis on the task itself but largely ignore the subtle details of the instinct spatio-temporal structure in point cloud videos.\nTo alleviate those problems, we propose a self-supervised learning method on point cloud videos. Self-supervised learning uses supervisory signals from the data itself and enables deep neural networks to learn from massive data without human annotations. This is important to recognize more subtle patterns in data.\nNetworks pre-trained with self-supervised learning usually yield higher performance than when solely trained in a supervised manner  [ref]15  .\nAlthough self-supervised learning has been applied to images [ref]15, videos [ref]13  and static point clouds  [ref]47, it has not been promoted on 4D signals, such as point cloud videos.\nVisual signals in point cloud videos can be divided into appearance and motion.\nWhile appearance specifies which objects are in videos, motion describes their dynamics.\nTherefore, self-supervised learning on point cloud videos should carefully make the most of the appearance and motion structure. In this paper, we propose a Masked Spatio-Temporal Structure Prediction (MaST-Pre) method for self-supervised learning on point cloud videos (Fig. 1).\nMaST-Pre is based on a masking strategy, which has been proven effective in a range of applications.\nFor example, because of the canonical structure, images can be easily segmented into multiple patches for masking  [ref]15, which in the case of video are extended to patch tubes [ref]13 .\nFor unstructured static point clouds, spherical support domain masking can be used for masked autoencoder  [ref]47.\nHowever, the spatial irregularity and temporal regularity make point cloud videos require a more elaborate masking strategy.\nOur method is based on a masked point tube mechanism, where a point tube is a local area expanding over a short time . Based on point-tube masking, our MaST-Pre employs two self-supervised tasks to capture the appearance and motion structure, respectively.\nFirst, to learn the appearance structure, MaST-Pre is asked to predict the invisible parts of the input from unmasked points.\nSecond, to capture the dynamics in point tubes, we propose the temporal cardinality difference, which can be calculated online from inputs without additional parameters.\nCardinality can reflect basic structures (e.g., line, edge, and plane) of static point clouds .\nIn this paper, we extend it to a temporal version so that it can model the dynamics of point cloud videos.\nIntuitively, the temporal cardinality difference characterizes the flow of points within a short time.\nTherefore, inferring the temporal cardinality difference of masked point tubes facilitates MaST-Pre to learn motion-informative representations. Our contributions are summarized as follows: We design a 4D scheme of masked prediction for self-supervised learning on point cloud videos, termed as MaST-Pre.\nOur MaST-Pre jointly learns the appearance and motion structure of point cloud videos. We propose the temporal cardinality difference, a simple and effective motion feature directly captured from raw input points. It explicitly guides MaST-Pre to learn motion-informative representations. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on several benchmark datasets validate that our MaST-Pre learns rich representations of point cloud videos.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: This is important to recognize more subtle patterns in data.\nNetworks pre-trained with self-supervised learning usually yield higher performance than when solely trained in a supervised manner  [ref]15  .\nAlthough self-supervised learning has been applied to images [ref]15, videos [ref]13  and static point clouds  [ref]47, it has not been promoted on 4D signals, such as point cloud\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
