      "content": "Paper Title: Image Manipulation Detection by Multi-View Multi-Scale Supervision\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis paper is inspired by a number of recent works that made novel attempts to learn semantic-agnostic features for image manipulation detection, see Table 1. In what follows, we describe in brief how these attempts are implemented and explain our novelties accordingly. We focus on deep learning approaches to copy-move / splicing / inpainting detection. For the detection of low-level manipulations such as Gaussian Blur and JPEG compression, we refer to . In order to suppress the content information, Li and Huang [ref]16 propose to implement an FCN’s first convolutional layer with trainable high-pass filters and apply their HP-FCN for inpainting detection. Yang et al. use BayarConv as the initial convolution layer of their CR-CNN 7. Although such constrained convolutional layers are helpful for extracting noise information, using them alone brings in the risk of losing other useful information in the original RGB input. Hence, we see an increasing number of works on exploiting information from both the RGB view and the noise view  6 . Zhou et al.  develop a two-stream Faster R-CNN, coined RGB-N, which takes as input the RGB image and its noise counterpart generated by the SRM filter . Wu et al. 6 and Hu et al.  use both BayarConv and SRM. Given features from distinct views, the need for feature fusion is on. Feature concatenation at an early stage is adopted by 6 . Our MVSS-Net is more close to RGB-N as both perform feature fusion at the late stage. However, different from the non-trainable bilinear pooling used in RGB-N, Dual Attention used in MVSS-Net is trainable and is thus more selective. As manipulating a specific region in a given image inevitably leaves traces between the tampered region and its surrounding, how to exploit such edge artifact also matters for manipulation detection. Salloum et al. develop a multi-task FCN to symmetrically predict a tampered area and its boundary 1. In a more recent work 9, Zhou et al. introduce an edge detection and refinement branch which takes as input features at different levels. Given that region segmentation and edge detection are intrinsically two distinct tasks, the challenge lies in how to strike a proper balance between the two. Directly using deeper features for edge detection as done in 1 has the risk of affecting the main task of manipulation segmentation, while putting all features together as used in 9 may let the deeper features be ignored by the edge branch. Our MVSS-Net has an edge-supervised branch that effectively resolves these issues. Last but not least, we observe that the specificity of an image manipulation detector, i.e. how it responses to authentic images, is seldom reported. In fact, the mainstream solutions are developed within an image semantic segmentation network. Naturally, they are trained and also evaluated on manipulated images in the context of manipulation segmentation 9. The absence of authentic images both in the training and test stages naturally raises concerns regarding the specificity of the detector. In this paper we make a novel attempt to include authentic images for training and test, an important step towards real-world deployment.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: / splicing / inpainting detection.
