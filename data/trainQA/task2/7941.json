      "content": "Paper Title: Fast-OverlaPIM: A Fast Overlap-driven Mapping Framework for Processing In-Memory Neural Network Acceleration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPIM has been widely used for memory-intensive and compute-intensive applications because of its extensive bandwidth for computing and ability to minimize data movement. Various PIM-based architectures have been introduced to support parallel operations inside memory with different memory technologies, such as SRAM, DRAM[ref]32   , ReRAM  , spintronics-based magnetic memories . This work focuses on the digital PIM paradigm, which stores the conventional digital representation (i.e., one binary bit per cell) in memory. A common underlying foundation for digital PIM is row-parallel bit-serial operations , which make use of the common bit-line circuits shared in memory blocks to process all columns in selected operand rows in a single step. Supported with universal bit-wise operations (e.g. AND, NOR, majority operation, etc.), PIM memory enables general computations for DNN   . Our baseline system is the bit-serial row-parallel PIM architecture  based on HBM2 DRAM , which supports universal bit-wise operations in the DRAM banks with activate-activate-precharge  and performs majority-based addition (MAJ) . In addition to the baseline DRAM system, Fast-OverlaPIM can be aligned with other digital PIM-based architectures through minimal modifications for the performance model and customized architecture configurations as inputs. In Section IV-B and Section IV-C, we will furtherdiscuss the possibility of extending Fast-OverlaPIM to support analog PIM, which represents fixed operands (i.e., neural network weights) in memory cells and process computation by applying analog signals (i.e., current) as other operands and sensing the result signals  .\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: and ability to minimize data movement.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
