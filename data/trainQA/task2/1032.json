      "content": "Paper Title: A Unified Model for Recommendation with Selective Neighborhood Modeling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe baselines employed for performance comparison are list as follows, SLIM  generates top-N recommendations by aggregating from user purchase/rating profiles. NeuMF combines generalized Matrix Factorization (MF) and Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) for modeling user-item latent structures. SVD++ is a hybrid model that encodes latent factor model and neighborhood similarity into a unified framework for recommendation. GATE  exploits neighboring relations to help infer users’ preferences. SAMN [ref]20 models aspect and friend-level influences in an hierarchical manner. CMN  identifies similar neighboring users with an attention mechanism based on the specific user-item pair, and jointly exploits the neighborhood state and user-item interactions to derive recommendation. DELF[ref]35 proposes an attention mechanism to aggregate an additional embedding for each user/item, and then further introduce a neural network architecture to incorporate dual embeddings for recommendation. The baselines are selected for the consideration that most of them exploit neighborhood information to alleviate the problem of data sparsity, hence they are comparable to the proposed model. The difference among those models is the way that they leverage the neighborhood compatibility. Specifically, SVD++ equally aggregates neighbors and hybrid it with the latent factor model. CMN proposes an attention mechanism to place higher weights on users in the neighborhood given the specific target item. DEFL also employs an attention mechanism to aggregate neighbors on both user and item side. For fair comparison, some baselines are modified in this paper. For example, the content-ware component in GATE is excluded, as textual information is not available in our case. As for SAMN, user-user friendships are created based on common ratings.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: a hybrid model that encodes latent factor model and neighborhood similarity into a unified framework for recommendation.
