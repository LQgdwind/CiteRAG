      "content": "Paper Title: Training Subset Selection for Weak Supervision\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHaving established that the cut statistic can effectively select\nweakly-labeled training subsets that are higher-quality than\nthe original training set, we now turn to a wider empirical study to see whether\nthis approach actually improves the performance of end models in practice. Datasets and Models.\nWe evaluate our approach on the WRENCH benchmark\n for weak supervision.\nWe compare the status-quo of full coverage (ﾎｲ=1.0撥ｽ1.0\\beta=1.0) to\nﾎｲ撥ｽ\\beta chosen from {0.1,0.2,窶ｦ,1.0}0.10.2窶ｦ1.0\\{0.1,0.2,\\ldots,1.0\\}.\nWe evaluate our approach with five different label models: Majority Vote (MV), the\noriginal Snorkel/Data Programming (DP), [ref]31,\nDawid-Skene (DS) [ref]8, FlyingSquid\n(FS) [ref]10, and MeTaL .\nFollowing Zhang etﾂal. , we use pretrained\nroberta-base and bert-base-cased222We refer to pretrained models by their names on the HuggingFace Datasets Hub. All model weights were downloaded from the hub: https://huggingface.co/datasets as the end model representation for text data, and hand-specified representations for tabular data. We performed all model training on NVIDIA A100 GPUs.\nWe primarily evaluate on seven textual datasets from the WRENCH benchmark: IMDb (sentiment analysis),\nYelp (sentiment analysis), Youtube (spam classification),\nTREC (question classification), SemEval (relation extraction),\nChemProt (relation extraction), and AGNews (text classification).\nFull details for the datasets and the weak label sources are available in\n Table 5 and reproduced here in Appendix\nB.1.\nWe explore other several other datasets and data modalities in Sections 4.2-4.3. Cut statistic.\nFor the representation ﾏ品talic-ﾏ表\phi, for text datasets we used the [CLS] token representation of a large pretrained model such as BERT or RoBERTa.\nFor relation extraction tasks, we followed  and used the concatenation of the [CLS] token and the average contextual representation of the tokens in each entity span.\nIn Section 4.3, for the tabular Census dataset we use the raw data features for ﾏ品talic-ﾏ表\phi.\nUnless otherwise specified, we used the same representation for ﾏ品talic-ﾏ表\phi and for the initial end model.\nFor example, when training bert-base-cased as the end model, we used bert-base-cased as ﾏ品talic-ﾏ表\phi for the cut statistic.\nWe explore several alternatives to this choice in Sectionﾂ4.2. Hyperparameter tuning.\nOur subset selection approach introduces a new\nhyperparameter, ﾎｲ撥ｽ\\beta窶杯he fraction of covered data to retain for training\nthe classifier.\nTo keep the hyperparameter tuning burden low, we first tune all other\nhyperparameters identically to Zhang etﾂal.  holding ﾎｲ撥ｽ\\beta fixed at\n1.0.\nWe then use the optimal hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, weight\ndecay, etc.) from ﾎｲ=1.0撥ｽ1.0\\beta=1.0 for a grid search over values of ﾎｲ竏{0.1,0.2,窶ｦ,1.0}撥ｽ0.10.2窶ｦ1.0\\beta\\in\\{0.1,0.2,\\ldots,1.0\\}, choosing the value with the best (ground-truth) validation performance.\nBetter results could be achieved by tuning all the hyperparameters together, but\nthis approach limits the number of possible combinations, and it matches the\nsetting where an existing, tuned weak supervision pipeline (with ﾎｲ=1.0撥ｽ1.0\\beta=1.0) is\nadapted to use subset selection.\nIn all of our experiments, we used K=20攝ｾ20K=20 nearest neighbors to compute the cut\nstatistic and performed no tuning on this value.\nAppendix B contains an ablation showing that performance is\nnot sensitive to this choice.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: to\nﾎｲ撥ｽ\\beta chosen from {0.1,0.2,窶ｦ,1.0}0.10.2窶ｦ1.0\\{0.1,0.2,\\ldots,1.0\\}.\nWe evaluate our approach with five different label models: Majority Vote (MV), the\noriginal Snorkel/Data Programming (DP), [ref]31,\nDawid-Skene (DS) [ref]8, FlyingSquid\n(FS) [ref]10, and MeTaL .\nFollowing Zhang etﾂal. , we use pretrained\nroberta-base and bert-base-cased222We refer to pretrained models by their names on\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
