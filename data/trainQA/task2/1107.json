      "content": "Paper Title: Low-Variance Policy Gradient Estimation with World Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown impressive results in learning complex behaviours in high-dimensional high-entropy environments (; ; ). DRL approaches are characterized by the use of neural networks to represent policy, value or other components of the MDP solution. While the end results are impressive, they are often achieved by training that takes days to complete. As such, sample efficiency is an important concern for DRL research. One of the approaches taken by the community is labeled ‚Äôworld models‚Äô (WMs). In this approach, the agent learns a policy-agnostic representation of the environment, often built by the state, transition and reward networks (; [ref]9; ; [ref]6). WMs were used to achieve control through planning (; ), but also gradient-based policy search, where policy rollouts are imagined by the WM (; and [ref]9). Besides sample-efficient learning, WMs were shown to facilitate generalization  and exploration . Alternatively, better sample efficiency can be achieved by building desirable properties of the estimators used for learning. In the context of the gradient-based policy search, variance of the gradient approximator can be reduced either by advantage  or by increasing the amount of samples, often with parallelization (; ; 8). However, the variance reduction as a result of increasing the amount of samples in Monte Carlo (MC) approximation is rapidly diminishing. This is especially true for low entropy policies, where drawing additional independent samples might yield redundant results. To this end, (; 8) consider approximating the policy gradient by sampling without replacement. The experiments shown promising results, but the requirement of the agent executing multiple trajectories until termination from many states is not scalable to real-world applications. In this paper, we propose WMPG - a method for approximating low-variance policy gradient. WMPG uses environment interactions to learn a WM in an online fashion. The learned WM allows the policy gradient to be estimated without replacement, with Q-values calculated by finite-horizon forward-looking TD(ŒªùúÜ\\lambda). Two approximation techniques yield a policy gradient with a favourable bias/variance trade-off, while the use of WM makes the method scalable to real-world problems. We compare the proposed method to AC and MAC on three environments of increasing complexity: CartPole; LunarLander and Pong. We show that the proposed method can achieve better sample efficiency as compared to the benchmark algorithms. The main contribution of this paper is unifying no-replacement policy gradient approximation with world model framework. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose: 1) using world models to calculate the policy gradient with a without-replacement expectation estimator; 2) using variable number of without-replacement sampled actions per state. We make our code available at: https://github.com/WMPG-paper/WMPG. The paper is organized as follows. We firstly provide background for the problem that this paper addresses (policy gradient approximation) and the method that this paper uses (WMs). Next, we introduce the proposed approach, by listing the components of WMPG and explaining how WMPG calculates the policy gradient approximator. Finally, we discuss related work and the experiments performed for this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: by the community is labeled ‚Äôworld models‚Äô (WMs).
