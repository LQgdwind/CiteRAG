      "content": "Paper Title: Select2Col: Leveraging Spatial-Temporal Importance of Semantic Information for Efficient Collaborative Perception\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPerception plays a crucial role in various tasks of IoV (especially AVs), such as 3D object detection [ref]23, multiple object tracking, semantic segmentation , and depth estimation . In particular, 3D object detection, which aims to accurately identify predefined object categories by providing classification and regression information [ref]27, is considered as one of the fundamental perception tasks within the field of computer vision. Given commonly utilized perception sensors in autonomous vehicles, methods for 3D target detection can be categorized into camera-based and LiDAR-based methods . Meanwhile, LiDAR-based detection methods are particularly favored due to the inherent 3D information of LiDAR point clouds, which maintain excellent performance even under challenging weather and lighting conditions [ref]27. However, LiDAR point clouds often suffer from sparsity and disorderliness, which pose challenges for the direct processing of individual points . To address this limitation, it commonly turns point clouds into alternative structures, such as voxel  or pillar , to improve the processing efficiency. Notably, compared to voxels, pillar structures offer advantages in terms of reduced computational and memory resources[ref]32. For example, PointPillars , a widely adopted technique for object detection in point clouds, organizes point clouds into vertical columns and operates on pillars instead of voxels. Consequently, all critical operations can be performed efficiently using 2D convolutions, thus eliminating the need for manual tuning of vertical direction binning. Given the requirement for real-time inference in detection models for autonomous vehicles, many state-of-the-art collaborative perception methods, such as V2VNet, V2X-Vit, and Where2comm, integrate the backbone of PointPillars in their respective models. Consistent with these works, we primarily consider LiDAR-based 3D object detection as our perception task and focus on how to enhance the performance of collaborative perception, given the inherent limitations of single-agent perception [ref]32.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: Perception plays a crucial role in various tasks of IoV (especially AVs), such as 3D object detection [ref]23, multiple object tracking, semantic segmentation , and depth estimation .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
