      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Spatiotemporal Frequency-Transformer for Low-Quality Video Super-Resolution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo evaluate FTVSR on the compressed videos, we test FTVSR and make the comparison with other SOTA approaches on the REDS [ref]33 dataset and Vid4 [ref]34 dataset, respectively.\nSame as the settings of compression in COMISR , compressed videos in several compression rates (CRF15, CRF25, CRF35) with the same compression algorithms (CRF) are generated. We evaluate FTVSR on these compressed videos and report PSNR and SSIM.\nTo evaluate the generalization ability of FTVSR on other compression algorithms, we also compare FTVSR with other methods on the compressed videos generated by CQP and CBR compression modes. Different Compression Rates:\nThe evaluation results of FTVSR on compressed videos from REDS [ref]33 dataset are shown in Table II. For the compression results, we cite the number of other approaches from .\nFor a fair comparison, IconVSR and BasicVSR are finetuned with the same compression training process in .\nDespite the remarkable results achieved on uncompressed videos, BasicVSR obtains 25.93dB and 23.22dB in PSNR on compressed videos of CRF25 and CRF35, respectively.\nIconVSR only reaches 25.93dB and 23.22dB in PSNR on compressed videos of CRF25 and CRF35, which is the same as BasicVSR, despite outperforming it on uncompressed videos, where IconVSR performs better than BasicVSR.\nThese results show that the compression problems can not be solved by increasing the model capacity. To alleviates the compression problem, COMISR  designs a special compression-aware module, but it brings limited gains of 26.47 and 23.56dB in PSNR on the compressed videos of CRF25 and CRF35, respectively.\nHowever, our FTVSR obtains PSNR values of 30.55, 28.13dB, and 24.87dB on compressed videos of CRF15, CRF25, and CRF35, respectively. The fact that FTVSR outperforms COMISR by 1.6 dB on compressed videos of CRF25 indicates that our FTVSR is more capable of dealing with the issue of video compression. The results on compressed videos of Vid4 [ref]34 dataset are shown in Table III. Similar to the settings on the REDS dataset, we finetune BasicVSR and IconVSR on the compressed videos of the Vimeo-90K dataset as .\nOn compressed videos of CRF 15, 25, and 35, FTVSR achieves 27.40dB, 25.38dB, and 22.61dB in PSNR, respectively. Additionally, FTVSR performs better than competing approaches and achieves new SOTA results, highlighting its enormous potential for overcoming the video compression dilemma. The visualization results of FTVSR and other approaches on compressed videos are shown in Figure 6. FTVSR shows better visual quality on compressed videos. Especially on the compressed video of CRF25 and CRF35, FTVSR has superior visual quality than other methods.\nCompared with the evaluations on compressed videos and uncompressed videos, COMISR  performs better than BasicVSR  and IconVSR  on compressed videos, while performs poorly on uncompressed videos. In contrast, as shown in Figure 6, FTVSR not only performs better on compressed videos but also performs well on uncompressed videos. Typically, BasicVSR, IconVSR, and COMISR fail to recover the texture on the compressed cases of CRF35, while our FTVSR still shows better visual quality in these cases. It profits from the frequency attention in FTVSR, which enables the generation of high-frequency textures with the guidance of low-frequency information. 28.13/0.778 28.77/0.793 31.08/0.865 Different Compression Algorithms:\nWe compare FTVSR with other methods [ref]6     on compressed videos generated by three different compression algorithms (CRF25, CQP25, and CBR1500k). The results are shown in Table IV.\nIn Table IV, the results of other methods are obtained by finetuning their models on the compressed videos of REDS dataset.\nFor the widely-used VSR methods (EDVR [ref]6, BasicVSR , IconVSR , BasicVSR++ , and TTVSR ), which have no designs for compression problem and perform worse on the compressed videos.\nRealBasicVSR  is designed for the real-world VSR, which adds a cleaning module to remove artifacts before applying the VSR model. But RealBasicVSR just outperforms other VSR approaches on compressed videos in CRF25, while remains the gaps of 1.2dB and 3.1dB in PSNR on the compressed videos in CQP25 and CBR1500k, respectively. This is because the clean module cannot remove the artifacts caused by compression. Moreover, This phenomenon shows that the pipeline of cleaning first and applying the VSR model later has the limitation of generalization. However, FTVSR achieves 28.05, 28.77, and 31.08dB in PSNR on the compressed videos with three different compression algorithms, respectively. These results show that FTVSR has a superior ability on handling compression problems in VSR. The visualization of compressed videos generated by different compression algorithms is shown in Figure 7. Compared with other VSR methods   , FTVSR shows better visualization results since the frequency attention mechanism. 32.42/0.907 37.81/0.949 30.48/0.852\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: To evaluate FTVSR on the compressed videos, we test FTVSR and make the comparison with other SOTA approaches on the REDS [ref]33 dataset and Vid4 [ref]34 dataset, respectively.\nSame as the settings of compression in COMISR , compressed videos in several compression rates (CRF15, CRF25, CRF35) with the same compression\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
