      "content": "Paper Title: On the Compression of Neural Networks Using ℓ₀-Norm Regularization and Weight Pruning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe importance of neural networks in the machine learning and engineering contexts has been growing substantially over the last decades   .\nFactors contributing to this growth include notable improvements in the training algorithms and the increasing availability of high-capacity computational platforms, which have allowed the deployment of neural networks having larger numbers of internal layers. Such networks, termed deep neural networks (DNNs), have been successfully applied to a number of complex problems, such as the stock market prediction   , sentiment analysis  [ref]8, natural language processing  0, speech recognition 1 2 3, and image processing 4 5 6. Despite the aforementioned increasing computational power availability, computational costs still pose an important challenge for the use of DNNs in real-world applications.\nThis point is due to the fact that many effective DNNs deal with a huge number of parameters (weights).\nOne particular example is AlexNet (winner of the 2012 Imagenet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge) 6, which comprises more than 60 million learnable weights. The training of networks with so many parameters, in spite of being computationally costly and time consuming, is a more tractable problem since it is typically an offline process. In contrast, deployment costs tend to be more critical and often prohibitive for large networks, especially in applications involving real-time processing and/or embedded systems.\nAiming to address this hindrance, a wide range of research works have been dedicated to the development of network compression techniques. Some of these techniques are based on using matrix decompositions to find suitable network approximations with reduced computational complexity 7 8 9 0. Other techniques exploit hardware implementation characteristics to achieve computational cost reductions 1 2 3. Moreover, neuron- or weight-pruning approaches have also been considered for developing network compression techniques 4 5 6 7 8 9. Beyond this list of examples, the reader can refer to one of the recent survey papers to obtain a more comprehensive perspective on the field of neural network compression 0 1. Specifically in the context of network compression via pruning approaches, strategies that combine norm-penalization-based regularization with pruning have been gaining significant attention 2 3 4 5. This aspect is due to the fact that such regularization techniques tend to induce network sparseness, which potentially increases the effectiveness of a subsequent weight and/or neuron pruning.\nIn 2, for instance, the association of ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}-norm regularization with weight pruning has achieved up to 12 times reductions on the number of network weights without affecting its performance.\nMoreover, in 5, 38 times reductions have been obtained at the cost of small performance losses using a combination of ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-norm regularization and weight pruning. When neuron pruning is desired, group-based regularization techniques have led to promising results 5 4. Moreover, as shown in 3, it is possible to combine neuron and weight penalization to increase the network compression. The focus of the present research work is on the development of a new strategy for neural network compression based on norm regularization and weight pruning. The idea here is to use the ℓ0subscriptℓ0\\ell_{0} norm instead of the commonly used ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1} or ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2} norms, since ℓ0subscriptℓ0\\ell_{0}-norm penalization typically has a stronger sparseness-inducing effect, as discussed in 6.\nOther types of ℓ0subscriptℓ0\\ell_{0}-norm regularizations have also been applied to network compression in 4 7 8 9 0. Each of these works adopts a different approach to deal with the difficulties arising from the use of the non-differentiable ℓ0subscriptℓ0\\ell_{0}-norm function. In 4, for instance, a general framework for using surrogate ℓ0subscriptℓ0\\ell_{0} functions for regularization is introduced together with an ℓ0subscriptℓ0\\ell_{0}-norm approximation, which is termed hard-concrete.\nThe strategy introduced in 7 is built on top of the framework given in 4, replacing the hard-concrete-based gradient estimator by the so-called augment-reinforce-merge (ARM) estimator, which has allowed obtaining improved results. The focus in both 4 and 7 is mostly on exploiting group sparseness aiming at carrying out neuron pruning. In 8, the weight pruning is formulated as a constrained nonconvex optimization problem having a constraint on the cardinality of the weights (i.e., on the ℓ0subscriptℓ0\\ell_{0} norm of the weight vector). The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is used for systematically solving such a problem and the weight pruning is then carried out by removing the weights that are close to zero 8. In 9, the weight pruning problem is formulated in two different forms: as a constrained optimization (with a ℓ0subscriptℓ0\\ell_{0}-norm constraint, similar to 8) and also as an optimization problem with a penalized objective function. Alternating optimization approaches are used to solve the problems obtained in the two proposed forms, leading to two-step algorithms for network training with weight pruning 9. Moreover, in 0, the approach introduced in 9 is used for combining the ℓ0subscriptℓ0\\ell_{0} and ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2} norms as constraints/penalizations, leading to improved results. Contributing to this research topic, a new weight pruning approach that uses ℓ0subscriptℓ0\\ell_{0}-norm regularization is introduced in the present work. The proposed approach is based on defining an optimization problem with an ℓ0subscriptℓ0\\ell_{0}-norm-based penalization on the objective function, bearing some similarity the traditional ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2} and ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1} norm regularizations used for overfitting mitigation and also with the approach from 9. To make such a problem more tractable, we rely on the exponential approximation of the ℓ0subscriptℓ0\\ell_{0} norm discussed in 1. In doing so, a gradient-descent-based strategy can be used for obtaining an effective network training algorithm, avoiding the use of more complex optimization approaches such as the ones based on alternating optimization. We also analyze the zero-attracting effect provided by the obtained training algorithm, showing that, for small weights, this effect is stronger than that obtained using ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}- and ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}-norm regularizations. However, for larger weights, such a zero-attracting effect tends to zero, making the proposed training algorithm not effective for avoiding model overfitting. To circumvent this problem, we propose a combined ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}-ℓ0subscriptℓ0\\ell_{0}-norm regularization in which the ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}-norm penalization is responsible to avoid overfitting, whereas the ℓ0subscriptℓ0\\ell_{0}-norm one targets smaller weights aiming at sparseness induction. This approach differs from the one in 0, where the ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}-norm regularization aims at increasing the zero-attracting effect. The proposed combined ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}-ℓ0subscriptℓ0\\ell_{0}-norm regularization in association with weight pruning gives rise to the network compression scheme proposed in this paper. A set of experimental results are presented aiming to show the effectiveness of the proposed compression scheme as well as to make comparisons with other competing strategies. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a review of classic regularization techniques based on vector norms. The proposed approach is discussed in Section 3. Finally, Sections 4 and 5 are dedicated to present, respectively, experimental results and concluding remarks.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: of internal layers.
