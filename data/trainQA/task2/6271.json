      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Optimal Transport: A Practical Algorithm for Photo-realistic Image Restoration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMany image restoration algorithms aim to recover a clean source image from its degraded version.\nThe performance of such algorithms is often evaluated in terms of their average distortion, which measures the discrepancy between restored images and their corresponding clean sources, as well as perceptual quality, which refers to the extent to which restored images resemble natural images.\nThe work in [ref]2 exposed a fundamental trade-off between distortion and perceptual quality, where the latter is measured using a perceptual index that quantifies the statistical divergence between the distribution of restored images and the distribution of natural images.\nThe trade-off curve reveals the predictor that achieves the lowest possible distortion, denoted as 𝐃𝐦𝐚𝐱subscript𝐃𝐦𝐚𝐱\\mathbf{D_{max}}, while maintaining perfect perceptual quality (refer to fig. 1). Following the methodology introduced by [ref]2, it has become common practice to compare restoration methods on the perception-distortion (PD) plane, with many methods aiming to reach the elusive 𝐃𝐦𝐚𝐱subscript𝐃𝐦𝐚𝐱\\mathbf{D_{max}} point.\nIn this paper, we present a practical approach to approximate the 𝐃𝐦𝐚𝐱subscript𝐃𝐦𝐚𝐱\\mathbf{D_{max}} predictor where distortion is measured using the MSE and perceptual quality is measured by the Wasserstein-2 distance (𝒲2subscript𝒲2\\mathcal{W}_{2}\\ ) between the distributions of restored and real images.\nOur approach is based on the recent work\n[ref]1 which demonstrated that the 𝐃𝐦𝐚𝐱subscript𝐃𝐦𝐚𝐱\\mathbf{D_{max}} predictor can be obtained using optimal transport (OT) from the output distribution of the MMSE predictor to the distribution of natural images.\nBy applying an optimal transport plan to an MMSE restoration resulting from a degraded image, we can produce 𝐃𝐦𝐚𝐱subscript𝐃𝐦𝐚𝐱\\mathbf{D_{max}} estimations by transporting the MMSE restored estimate. Although progress has been made in finding OT plans between image distributions  [ref]5 , it remains challenging task, particularly for high-dimensional distributions.\nTherefore, we propose an approximation method for the 𝐃𝐦𝐚𝐱subscript𝐃𝐦𝐚𝐱\\mathbf{D_{max}} estimator by performing transportation in the latent space of a pre-trained auto-encoder.\nA similar strategy was successfully employed in the context of image generation in , showing effectiveness in reducing complexity and preserving details. Inspired by the style transfer literature   , we assume that the latent representations follow a Multivariate Gaussian (MVG) distribution.\nThus, by considering the first and second-order statistics of the embedded MMSE estimates and embedded natural images, we can compute the well-known closed form solution of the OT operator between two Gaussians.\nTo further reduce complexity, we make additional assumptions about the structure of the latent covariance matrices, enabling the computation of the OT operator with as few as 10 unpaired MMSE restored and clean samples.\nThis approach leads to a few-shot algorithm that significantly enhances visual quality. Interestingly, our method can even improve the visual quality of generative models that were trained to achieve high perceptual quality in the first place (see fig. 2).\nFurthermore, by adjusting a single interpolation parameter, we can trade off perception for distortion, resulting in marginal improvements in the distortion performance of some regression models that were trained to prioritize source fidelity.\nWe demonstrate the improved photo-realism of our approach on a variety of tasks and models, including GAN and diffusion-based methods, using high-resolution (e.g., 5122superscript5122512^{2} px) general-content images with arbitrary aspect ratios. 111Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/theoad/dot-dmax.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: the discrepancy between restored images and their corresponding clean sources, as well as perceptual quality, which refers to the extent to which restored images resemble natural images.\nThe work in [ref]2 exposed a fundamental trade-off between distortion and perceptual quality, where the latter is measured using a perceptual index that quantifies the statistical divergence between the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
