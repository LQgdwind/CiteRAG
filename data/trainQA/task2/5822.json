      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Learning and Explaining Indirect Causal Effects in Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNeural network (NN) models enriched with causal knowledge have demonstrated their ability to achieve robustness , invariance  , and provide interpretable explanations for human understanding  [ref]26 [ref]17. In training such NN models imbued with causal knowledge, two primary tasks emerge: (1) acquiring a comprehension of causal relationships between input and output neurons   [ref]17, and (2) validating and explaining the acquired causal relationships  [ref]16 [ref]26. Previous studies have tended to address these two tasks separately, despite their close interconnectedness. This separation of dependent tasks also makes it challenging to study and model more nuanced aspects such as the indirect causal effects of input neurons on the output of an NN. To address this limitation, in this work, we propose an Ante-Hoc Causal Explanations (AHCE) approach that simultaneously performs both these tasks. Task 1 - Learning Causal Effects in NNs: A common practice in learning causal effects in NN models involves considering the NN as a Structural Causal Model (SCM), representing the parametric causal relationships between the features   [ref]16. Given our focus on input-output causal relationships in an NN, following   [ref]17, we marginalize the hidden layers and view the output as a function of inputs as shown in Fig 1 (a) (the motivating example in the next paragraph describes the variables). It becomes evident that the SCM embodied by a conventional feedforward NN model lacks causal relationships among input features (neurons in the first layer, we use input features and input neurons interchangeably in this work). Consequently, the causal effects that are learned and quantified are restricted solely to direct causal effects (viz. causal effects that do not propagate through other input features – see Appendix §A for preliminaries). Hence, there is currently no feasible approach for explaining indirect causal effects (viz. causal effects that propagate through other input features). We extend the basic architecture of an NN by adding feedforward connections among input neurons (see Fig 1(b)) based on domain knowledge of how features interact in the real-world, thus enabling the learning and explaining of indirect causal effects. To motivate the need for the study of indirect causal effects in NN models, consider the task of predicting an individual’s income (I𝐼I) using the features: education (E𝐸E), socioeconomic status (S𝑆S), and job role (R𝑅R). In the real world, S𝑆S causes E𝐸E and R𝑅R; E𝐸E causes R𝑅R; S,E,𝑆𝐸S,E, and R𝑅R cause I𝐼I (see Fig 1(b)). However, in an NN model, the relationships among input features S,E,R𝑆𝐸𝑅S,E,R are not modeled (see Fig 1(a)). As a result, for feature S𝑆S, an NN model can only learn and explain direct causal effects while neglecting the indirect causal effects on I𝐼I propagating via E𝐸E and R𝑅R. From a fairness standpoint, S𝑆S should have no direct causal effect on I𝐼I but can exhibit a non-zero indirect causal effect on I𝐼I through E𝐸E and R𝑅R.\nIf a model learns a non-zero direct causal effect of S𝑆S on I𝐼I, the corresponding model explanations may not align with the real-world and can indicate unacceptable learned causal effects. Thus, learning indirect effects can also find application in identifying and comprehending model biases. We provide the ability to differentiate between direct and indirect causal effects in an NN model by introducing feedforward connections among input features (see Appendix §H for another motivating example). Task 2 - Explaining Causal Effects in NNs: Explainability methods for NN models have encompassed a wide range of techniques ranging from various gradient-based methods to Shapley values. Recently, there has been increased attention towards causal explanations due to their enhanced reliability  , as well as their potential for aiding in debugging  and improving NN model performance  [ref]17. We refer to explanations such as gradients and Shapley values as effects and causal explanations as causal effects to separate the non-causal explanations from causal explanations. Most explanation methods provide direct effects, such as gradients and marginal Shapley values . Causal Shapley values (CSHAP)  account for indirect effects mediated through other features. However, they are not equal to the causal effects obtained through backdoor adjustment 0 (see Appendix §B for details). Except for causal regularization using domain priors (CREDO) [ref]17, all existing efforts in causal explanations are post-hoc approaches, quantifying the causal effects of input features on the output for a pre-trained NN model. These post-hoc explanation methods, though causal, only capture direct effects, and assign zero indirect causal effects to all features. This may not accurately represent the true underlying indirect causal effects among input features in the real world [ref]16. Although [ref]17 adopts an ante-hoc approach, it does not model indirect causal effects. See Tab 1 for a comparison of related explanation methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that that provides an ante-hoc approach to explain indirect causal effects. Our key contributions are summarized below. We propose a novel ante-hoc training algorithm to capture indirect causal effects in NN models. Our approach aligns with the demand for intrinsically interpretable techniques rather than post-hoc explanations 4. We propose an algorithm to quantify the learned indirect causal effects in NNs using the lateral connections among input neurons. We also present effective implementation strategies to scale causal explanation methods to high-dimensional data w.r.t. time and space complexity. We present a wide range of empirical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets to showcase the usefulness of the proposed method.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: Neural network (NN) models enriched with causal knowledge have demonstrated their ability to achieve robustness , invariance  , and provide interpretable explanations for human understanding  [ref]26 [ref]17.
