      "content": "Paper Title: Guiding Word Equation Solving using Graph Neural Networks (Extended Technical Report)\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are many techniques within solvers supporting word equations, as well as in stand-alone word equation solvers.\nFor instance, the SMT solvers Norn  and TRAU  introduce several improvements on the inference rules , including length-guided splitting of equalities and a more efficient way to handle disequalities.\nThe stand-alone word equation solver Woorpje  reformulates the word equation problem as a reachability problem for nondeterministic finite automata, then encodes it as a propositional satisfiability problem which can be handled by SAT solvers.\nIn , the authors propose a transformation system that extends the Nielsen transformation  to work with linear length constraints.\nThis transformation system can be integrated into existing string solvers such as Z3STR3 , Z3SEQ , and CVC4 , thereby advancing the efficiency of word equation resolution. GNNs excel at analyzing the graph-like structures of logic formulae, offering a complementary approach to formal verification.\nFormulaNet 0 is an early study guiding the premise selection for Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs). It uses MP-GNNs [ref]24 to process the graph representation of the formulae in the proof trace extracted from HOL Light . With more studies  1  exploring this path, this trend quickly expands to related fields.\nFor instance, for SAT solvers 2 , NeuroSAT 5 6 predicts the probability of variables appearing in unsat cores to guide the variable branching decisions for Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) .\nMoreover, GNNs have been combined with various formal verification techniques, such as scheduling SMT solvers , loop invariant reasoning 7 8, or guiding Constraint Horn Clause (CHC) solvers   . They provide the empirical foundations for designing the learning task in Section 4, such as the graph representation of word equations and forming the learning task in split points.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: of logic formulae, offering a complementary approach to formal verification.\nFormulaNet 0 is an early study guiding the premise selection for Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs). It uses MP-GNNs [ref]24 to process the graph representation of the formulae in the proof trace extracted from HOL Light . With more studies  1  exploring this path, this trend quickly expands to related fields.\nFor\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
