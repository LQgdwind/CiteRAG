Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: The Potential of Machine Learning and NLP for Handling Students’ Feedback – A Short Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSemantics has been widely used in the education domain, for instance, a document level review can be enriched with semantics  using background knowledge provided by an ontology  and through the acquisition of its relevant terminology . Further objective metrics  could be exploited for sentiment analysis. It is used to enrich existing concepts in domain ontologies for describing and organizing multimedia documents . Semantics can be represented as word embeddings, that are one of the key breakthroughs in the NLP. Word Embeddings are d-dimensional space representations of words’ distributed. As represented in Figure 3 word embeddings are the first step in DL architecture after the pre-processing step. The output of the word embedding step used as input for the DL architecture for either extracting the aspect or classification of sentiment.\nFollowing pre-trained word embedding Word2Vec  which have developed by Google in 2013, other word embedding methods such as GloVe [ref]36 and fastText [ref]37 developed by Stanford University and Facebook respectively. In 2018 Devlin et al.  developed Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). Word2Vec    , GloVe    [ref]39,\nFastText   are the most used word embedding in student feedback SA. Estrada et al.  and Sangeetha et al.  used BERT and Contextualized word vector for embedding respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: for either extracting the aspect or classification of sentiment.\nFollowing pre-trained word embedding Word2Vec  which have developed by Google in 2013, other word embedding methods such as GloVe [ref]36 and fastText [ref]37 developed by Stanford University and Facebook respectively.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
