      "content": "Paper Title: NASOA: Towards Faster Task-oriented Online Fine-tuning with a Zoo of Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDuring the NAS, we directly search on the ImageNet dataset.\nWe first search for a group of efficient block structure, then use\nthose block candidates to conduct the macro-level search. We use a\nshort training setting to evaluate each architecture. It takes about\n1 hour on average for evaluating one architecture for the block-level\nsearch and 6 hours for the macro-level search. Paralleled on GPUs,\nit takes about one week on a 64-GPU cluster to conduct the whole search\n(5K+1K arch). Implementation details and intermediate results can\nbe found in the Appendix. Faster Fine-tuning Model Zoo (ET-NAS). After identifying\nthe ùíúi‚àósuperscriptsubscriptùíúùëñ\\mathcal{A}_{i}^{*} from our search, we fully train those models\non ImageNet following common practice. Note that all the models including\nET-NAS-L can be easily pretrained on a regular 8-card GPU node since\nour model is training-efficient. We have released our models\nfor the public to reproduce our results from scratch and let the public\nto save their energy/CO2/cost. Due to the length of the paper, we\nput the detailed encoding and architectures of the final searched\nmodels in the Appendix. Surprisingly, we found that smaller models\nshould use simpler structures of blocks while bigger models prefer\ncomplex blocks as shown in Figure 3.\nComparing our searched backbone to the conventional ResNet/ResNeXt,\nwe find that early stages in our models are very short which is more\nefficient since feature maps in an early stage are very large and\nthe computational cost is comparably large. This also verified our\nfindings in preliminary experiments. Comparison with the state-of-the-art ImageNet models. We\ncompare the training/inference efficiency of our searched ET-NAS with\nthe SOTA ImageNet models such as MobileNetV3 [ref]23,\nRegNet series [ref]40, and EfficientNet series\n[ref]51 as shown in Table 2\nand Figure 4. Overall, our searched\nmodels outperform other SOTA ImageNet models in terms of training\naccuracy and training speed from Figure 4\n(left). Specifically, ET-NAS-G is about 6x training faster than RegNetY-16GF,\nand ET-NAS-I is about 1.5x training faster than EfficientNetB3. Our\nmodels are also better than mobile setting models such as MobileNetV2/V3[ref]23\nand RegNetY-200MF. Although our model is optimized for fast training,\nwe also compare the inference speed in Figure 4(right).\nOur models still have a very strong performance in terms of inference\nspeed, outperforming RegNet series and achieving comparable performance\nwith EfficientNet. Comparison with the NAS models. We also compare our method\nwith state-of-the-art NAS methods: AmoebaNet,\nOFA, Darts, PCDarts,\nEfficientNet[ref]51, RegNet[ref]40\nand so on. In Figure 5, it can be found that\nour searched models are more training efficient than other NAS results,\ne.g., some evolution-based NAS methods such as AmoebaNet, OFANet,\nand some weight sharing methods such as Darts and AmoebaNet. This\nis because of our flexible and effective search space, which considers\nboth macro and micro-level structure. What makes our network training efficient? To answer this,\nwe define an efficiency score and conduct a statistical analysis\nof different factors for efficient-training (The analysis can be found\nin Appendix). We have the following conclusions: a) By observing optimal\nùíúi‚àósuperscriptsubscriptùíúùëñ\\mathcal{A}_{i}^{*}, smaller models should use simpler blocks while\nbigger models prefer complex blocks. Using the same block structure\nfor all sizes of models [ref]51 [ref]40 may\nnot be optimal. b) Adding redundant skip-connections which have great\nmemory access cost will decrease the training efficiency of the model\nthus existing topological cell-level search space such as DARTS ,\nAmoebaNet , and NASBench101 \nis not efficient. c) The computation allocation on different stages\nis crucially important. Simply increasing depth/width to expand the\nmodel as [ref]51 may not be optimal will downgrade the performance.\nTo conclude our novel joint search space contributes most to the training\nefficiency.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: preliminary experiments. Comparison with the state-of-the-art ImageNet models. We\ncompare the training/inference efficiency of our searched ET-NAS with\nthe SOTA ImageNet models such as MobileNetV3 [ref]23,\nRegNet series [ref]40, and EfficientNet series\n[ref]51 as shown in Table 2\nand Figure 4. Overall, our searched\nmodels outperform other SOTA ImageNet models in terms of training\naccuracy and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
