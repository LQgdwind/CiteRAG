Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: An Evaluation and Comparison of GPU Hardware and Solver Libraries for Accelerating the OPM Flow Reservoir Simulator\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOther reservoir simulators include: BOAST[ref]21: Black Oil Applied Simulation Tool is a free simulator from the U.S Department of Energy. It uses IMPES (finite difference, implicit pressure, explicit saturation). The last release was in 1998. MRST[ref]23: Matlab Reservoir Simulation Toolbox is developed by SINTEF Applied Mathematics, who also contributed to OPM. It also includes third-party modules from developers from many different research institutes. ECLIPSE[ref]15: Originally developed by ECL (Exploration Consultants Limited), now owned and developed by Schlumberger. Eclipse is an industry-reference simulator. The in- and output files of OPM are compatible with Eclipse software. INTERSECT: Also from Schlumberger, it has similar features as Eclipse. Intersect has more support for massive parallel execution, with a GPU accelerated linear solver, and faster linearization of equations. ECHELON: Echelon is the only reservoir simulator that is fully GPU accelerated. It uses a GMRES solver with a CPR preconditioner. A maximum of 12 million active cells can be simulated on a single GPU. TeraPOWERS: TeraPOWERS is an in-house simulator by Aramco. It boasts world’s first trillion cell simulation, performed on 150000 cores of the Shaheen II supercomputer. GEOSX: An open source simulator, specifically for modeling carbon storage. It does not appear to have a three-phase black oil simulation. There is a possibility to use CUDA, but it is unclear which parts are accelerated exactly. tNavigator: A black oil, compositional and thermal reservoir simulator. Allows the linear solver part to run on a GPU, as well as some other parts. PFLOTRAN: An open source simulator that uses PETSc[petsc] for domain decomposition to achieve parallelism. Not accelerated on GPU, but is able to scale easily on CPUs. Numerous libraries that support blocked sparse linear algebra on GPU exist, including cusparse, magma, viennacl, ginkgo, amgcl, rocalution and rocsparse.\nOf these, only cusparse does not support AMG GPUs at all, others might need the HIP module from the ROCm framework.\nRocalution actually uses many functions from rocsparse underneath.\nTable 3 shows the different libraries, and what functions they support.\nThe Chow Patel ILU0 indicates an iterative, highly parallel decomposition and application.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: Other reservoir simulators include: BOAST[ref]21: Black Oil Applied Simulation Tool is a free simulator from the U.S Department of Energy.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
