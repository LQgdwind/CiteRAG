      "content": "Paper Title: Assessor-Guided Learning for Continual Environments\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nContinual learning problem aims to build a learning model throughout the life span of the model in use and gain its improved intelligence as the increase of learning tasks. Unlike conventional learning algorithms limited to only a single task, a continual learner is exposed to streaming tasks where each task possesses varying characteristics, i.e., different data distributions, different target classes, or combinations between distributional changes and class changes. A continual learner has to adapt quickly to new environments without losing its relevance to old tasks. This problem is not trivial for a deep neural network because of the catastrophic interference problem where old parameters are overwritten when learning a new task thereby losing its generalization power to the old tasks. Because of uncertain and possibly infinite problem sizes, a retraining process from scratch is undesired. In other words, the learning process occurs without complete accesses of old data samples. The continual learning problem goes one step toward human-like intelligence where the continual learner must be capable of accumulating knowledge from already seen experiences. As a result, this area has picked up substantial research attention. Existing works are categorized into three groups, regularization-based approach [ref]1, structure-based approach [ref]2 and memory-based approach . The regularization-based approach introduces an extra regularization term preventing important parameters of old tasks from deviations. This approach is simple to implement and computationally light. These approaches, however, do not scale well for large-scale problems because an overlapping region of all tasks is difficult to find with the regularization-based approach. The structure-based approach increases network capacity to deal with new tasks while isolating old network parameters to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem. This approach is, however, computationally expensive and usually involves complex learning procedures. The memory-based approach takes another route where a small subset of old data samples are stored in the memory and interleaved with current samples when learning a new task. Conventional experience replay mechanism requires hundreds of samples to be stored in the memory thus incurring expensive memory footprints. There also exists the class imbalanced problem because old samples are often lower in quantity than new samples. The assessor-guided learning approach is put forward here to address these drawbacks where an assessor controls the learning process of the base learner via a soft-weighting mechanism of loss functions for every sample. Memory augmentation is applied in our method to address the class-imbalance problem between the current task and the previous tasks. The compensated over-sampling mechanism is integrated where self-corrections while over-sampling is performed to avoid the out-of-distribution cases. Assessor-Guided Learning Approach (AGLA) is proposed here where a sequence-aware assessor is integrated to navigate the learning process of a base model to attain an improved learning performance. The assessor is trained with a meta-objective to boost the generalization power of the base model via a soft-weighting mechanism of loss functions for every sample. A high-quality sample is assigned with a high weight whereas a low weight is assigned to poor samples. High-quality samples are those leading to positive forward and backward transfers whereas poor samples are those imposing high losses associated with catastrophic forgetting. Two data subsets, training subset and validation subset, are created for each task to simulate the training-testing procedure  where both subsets represent current and old concepts. The concept of random transformation [ref]5 is integrated to craft the validation subset. The training procedure follows the meta-learning principle where the training subset is used to train the base model in the outer loop while the assessor utilizes the validation subset for its updates in the inner loop. The assessor produces a set of weights, cross-entropy weight, dark experience replay (DER) weight and distillation weight controlling the interaction of loss functions and in turn the influence of every sample. This is made possible by formulating the loss function as a meta-weighted combination of the cross entropy loss function, the DER loss function  and the knowledge distillation loss function . The cross entropy loss focuses on current samples and past samples of the memory while the DER loss and the knowledge distillation loss targets past samples of the memory to maintain previous knowledge. In other words, the assessor steers a base model to address the stability- plasticity dillemma. It determines how much a base model should learn from the current condition and the past condition in respect to every sample. Note that both DER and knowledge distillation targets previous experiences because the number of previous tasks are larger than the current task but underrepresented in the training process, i.e., memory samples are much smaller than current samples. This aspect confirms the importance of meta-weighting mechanism regulating the influence of multi-objective functions seamlessly. The class imbalanced problem due to disproportionate proportions of memory samples and currents samples is tackled using the compensated over-sampling (COS) strategy where compensations are performed while over-sampling via well-known data augmentation protocols to protect against out-of-distribution augmented samples undermining model’s generalization. A lemma analyzing such compensation w.r.t the bias-variance decomposition is provided as well as a theorem demonstrating reductions of MSEs as a result of the compensations is demonstrated. This paper conveys five major contributions: it puts forward the concept of assessor-guided continual learning where the sequence-aware assessor is deployed to guide the learning process of the base learner balancing the issue of stability and plasticity; the compensated over-sampling (COS) strategy is proposed to deal with the class imbalanced problem underpinned with theoretical analyses; a meta-training strategy via a bi-level optimization is put forward to train the assessor where the concept of random transformation is implemented to craft the validation subset; a meta-weighted combination of three loss functions are proposed to train a base learner where each loss function is associated with either current or past conditions. This design offers an intuition of learning strategies for every sample, i.e, whether to focus on the current or previous contexts; the source codes of AGLA and other supporting data are made public in https://github.com/anwarmaxsum/AGLA to enable further study. The advantage of AGLA over existing approaches has been numerically validated under the class-incremental and task-incremental learning configurations. It is demonstrated that AGLA delivers improvements compared to recently published algorithms in realm of average accuracy while each learning component contributes positively to the performance. AGLA achieves comparable average forgetting indexes where it mostly attains the second place and maintains decent performances with various memory sizes compared to baseline algorithms.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: knowledge from already seen experiences.
