      "content": "Paper Title: ATM-R: An Adaptive Tradeoff Model with Reference Points for Constrained Multiobjective Evolutionary Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA feasibility-driven CMOEA is driven by feasibility information, in which feasible solutions are considered to be better than infeasible ones. Some feasibility-driven CMOEAs use the constrained dominance principle (CDP) to compare two solutions¬†. In the CDP, a solution ùê±usubscriptùê±ùë¢\\mathbf{x}_{u} is said to be better than another solution ùê±vsubscriptùê±ùë£\\mathbf{x}_{v}, if one of the following conditions is met: both ùê±usubscriptùê±ùë¢\\mathbf{x}_{u} and ùê±vsubscriptùê±ùë£\\mathbf{x}_{v} are infeasible, and G‚Äã(ùê±u)<G‚Äã(ùê±v)ùê∫subscriptùê±ùë¢ùê∫subscriptùê±ùë£G(\\mathbf{x}_{u})<G(\\mathbf{x}_{v}); ùê±usubscriptùê±ùë¢\\mathbf{x}_{u} is feasible and ùê±vsubscriptùê±ùë£\\mathbf{x}_{v} is infeasible; both ùê±usubscriptùê±ùë¢\\mathbf{x}_{u} and ùê±vsubscriptùê±ùë£\\mathbf{x}_{v} are feasible, and ùê±u‚â∫ùê±vprecedessubscriptùê±ùë¢subscriptùê±ùë£\\mathbf{x}_{u}\\prec\\mathbf{x}_{v}. Due to its preference for feasible solutions, the CDP can motivate the population toward feasible regions quickly. It has been widely integrated with different kinds of MOEAs¬†  and used in a spectrum of engineering optimization prob-lems¬† . Liu et al.¬† combined an angle-based selection strategy, the shift-based density estimation strategy, and the CDP for constrained many-objective optimization. Jain and Deb¬† proposed a reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, which is integrated with the CDP for constrained many-objective optimization. Jan and Khanum¬† embedded the CDP into the framework of MOEA/D and compared its performance with that of the stochastic ranking¬†[ref]11. CDP-based CMOEAs are often used as the baseline algorithms when evaluating the performance of a CMOEA¬†  . The feasibility rule, which is widely used for constrained single-objective optimization, has been extended to solve CMOPs. Liu et al.¬† combined the feasibility rule with an indicator-based MOEA and compared its performance with that of some other kinds of CMOEAs. Fan et al.¬† carried out a comparison study on MOEA/D for constrained multiobjective optimization. Different constraint-handling techniques including the feasibility rule are embedded into the framework of MOEA/D. Some CMOEAs put emphasis on constraints when the population contains no feasible solutions. Woldesenbet and Yen¬† presented a self-adaptive penalty method to solve CMOPs, in which an adaptive penalty function and a distance measure are combined for constraint-handling. In fact, when the population is entirely infeasible, the self-adaptive penalty method compares two solutions based on constraints regardless of objectives. Liu and Wang¬† presented a two-phase CMOEA to solve CMOPs. When the population is entirely infeasible, all objectives are combined together and the feasibility rule is used to tackle constraints. Due to the superior capability of its search algorithm, the two-phase CMOEA can handle complex constraints in the decision space. Jimenez et al.¬† designed a CMOEA for constrained multiobjective optimization, in which the min-max formulation is used to tackle constraints. In addition, the feasibility rule is used to compare two solutions when an offspring is inserted into the new population. Miyakawa et al. ¬† developed a two-stage nondominated sorting method to solve CMOPs. The population is divided into several fronts by the nondominated sorting according to constraints. The obtained fronts are further partitioned by the nondominated sorting based on objectives. In this manner, constraints are prior to objectives in environmental selection.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: is integrated with the CDP for constrained many-objective optimization.
