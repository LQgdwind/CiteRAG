      "content": "Paper Title: Clustering by Maximizing Mutual Information Across Views\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTraditional clustering algorithms such as K-means or Gaussian Mixture\nModel (GMM) are mainly designed for low-dimensional vector-like data,\nhence, do not perform well on high-dimensional structural data like\nimages. Deep clustering methods address this limitation by leveraging\nthe representation power of deep neural networks (e.g., CNNs, RNNs)\nto effectively transform data into low-dimensional feature vectors\nwhich are then used as inputs for a clustering objective. For example,\nDCN [ref]46 applies K-means to the latent representations\nproduced by an auto-encoder. The reconstruction loss and the K-means\nclustering loss are minimized simultaneously. DEC [ref]43,\nby contrast, uses only an encoder rather than a full autoencoder like\nDCN to compute latent representations. This encoder and the cluster\ncentroids are learned together via a clustering loss proposed by the\nauthors. JULE  uses a RNN to implement agglomerative\nclustering on top of the representations outputted by a CNN and trains\nthe two networks in an end-to-end manner. VaDE \nregards clustering as an inference problem and learns the cluster-assignment\nprobabilities of data using a variational framework .\nMeanwhile, DAC [ref]7 treats clustering as a binary\nclassification problem: ‚ÄúWhether a pair of samples belong to the\nsame cluster or not?‚Äù. To obtain a pseudo label for a pair, the\ncosine similarity between the cluster-assignment probabilities of\nthe two samples in that pair is compared with an adaptive threshold.\nIIC  learns cluster assignments via maximizing\nthe mutual information between clusters under two different data augmentations.\nPICA , instead, minimizes the contrastive loss\nderived from the the mutual information in IIC. While the cluster\ncontrastive loss in PICA is cluster-oriented and can have at most\nCùê∂C negative pairs (Cùê∂C is the number of clusters). Our probability\ncontrastive loss, by contrast, is sample-oriented and can have as\nmany negative pairs as the number of training data. Thus, in theory,\nour proposed model can capture more information than PICA. In real\nimplementation, in order to gain more information from data, PICA\nhas to make use of the ‚Äúover-clustering‚Äù trick .\nIt alternates between minimizing ‚ÑíPICAsubscript‚ÑíPICA\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{PICA}} for Cùê∂C clusters\nand minimizing ‚ÑíPICAsubscript‚ÑíPICA\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{PICA}} for k‚ÄãCùëòùê∂kC clusters (k>1ùëò1k>1 denotes\nthe ‚Äúover-clustering‚Äù coefficient). DRC \nand CC  enhances PICA by combining clustering\nwith contrastive representation learning, which follows the same paradigm\nas our proposed CRLC. However, like PICA, DRC and CC uses cluster-oriented\nrepresentations rather than sample-oriented representations. In addition to end-to-end deep clustering methods, some multi-stage\nclustering methods have been proposed recently  .\nThe most notable one is SCAN . This method uses\nrepresentations learned via contrastive learning during the first\nstage to find nearest neighbors for every sample in the training set.\nIn the second stage, neighboring samples are forced to have similar\ncluster-assignment probabilities. Our probability contrastive loss\ncan easily be extended to handle neighboring samples (see Section¬†5.1.2).\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: power of deep neural networks (e.g., CNNs, RNNs)\nto effectively transform data into low-dimensional feature vectors\nwhich are then used as inputs for a clustering objective.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
