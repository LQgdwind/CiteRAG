      "content": "Paper Title: Projected distances for multi-parameter persistence modules\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe theory of persistence appeared in the 2000s as an algebraic framework for studying the presence of topological features in data. Its main objects of interest are n𝑛n-parameters persistence modules that are functors from the poset category (ℝn,≤)superscriptℝ𝑛(\\mathbb{R}^{n},\\leq) to the category Mod⁡(𝐤)Mod𝐤\\operatorname{Mod}({\\mathbf{k}}) of 𝐤𝐤{\\mathbf{k}}-vector spaces over a fixed field 𝐤𝐤{\\mathbf{k}}, that can be compared in a meaningful way using a distance defined algebraically: the interleaving distance dIsubscript𝑑𝐼d_{I}. When n=1𝑛1n=1, the theory is well-understood. One-parameter persistence modules are entirely determined by a discrete summary called barcode, which can be efficiently computed. The interleaving distance can also be computed from the barcodes, thanks to the bottleneck distance dBsubscript𝑑𝐵d_{B}. We refer to   for general introductions to n𝑛n-parameter persistence. One-parameter persistence is often restrictive, in particular in applications where there is no canonical choice of filtering function on the data. Furthermore, there are many situations in which being able to perform machine learning on multi-parameters persistence modules is anticipated to be fruitful  . Nevertheless, the theory of n𝑛n-parameters persistence modules when n≥2𝑛2n\\geq 2, is far more intricate. Indeed, it has been proven that there cannot exist, in a precise sense, an analogue of barcodes in this situation , and that the interleaving distance is NP-hard to compute [ref]4. In this paper, relying on microlocal sheaf theory, we introduce new invariants and distances for multi-parameter persistence modules, prove that they enjoy several stability properties and are efficiently computable, which are essential requirements for such notions to be useful in practice. So far, the main invariant that has been developed for multi-parameter persistent modules, efficiently implemented, and which enjoys the desired stability properties, is the fibered barcode  (which is equivalent to the rank-invariant ). Roughly speaking, the fibered barcode of a n𝑛n-parameters persistence module M𝑀M corresponds to the collection of barcodes obtained by restricting M𝑀M along each affine line of positive slope in ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}. One can compare fibered barcodes by taking the supremum over all lines of positive slopes of the line-wise bottleneck distance (corrected by a specific coefficient) between barcodes of the restrictions of the persistence modules. This distance is called the matching distance, usually denoted dMsubscript𝑑𝑀d_{M}. The matching distance between the fibered barcodes associated with two n𝑛n-parameter persistence modules is bounded above by their interleaving distance , hence ensuring stability. Moreover, the fibered barcode of 2-parameters persistence modules originating from point-cloud data can be computed and visualized by the software RIVET . Nevertheless, there are several bottlenecks to the fibered barcode approach. First, it is easy to exhibit two persistence modules at matching distance zero but having arbitrarily large interleaving distance (see section 5.1). Second, computing and storing an entire n𝑛n-parameters persistence module is time and memory costly. RIVET can currently only handle 222-parameter persistence modules. Moreover, it cannot deal with persistence modules originating from sublevel sets filtrations of functions (such as images or PL maps on simplicial complexes). In this paper, we approach the study of multi-parameter persistence modules through the lens of derived, and microlocal sheaf theory of Masaki Kashiwara and Pierre Schapira  as initiated in . In this setting, building upon , the authors have proved, in a previous work [ref]3, that a multi-parameter persistence module can be identified isometrically to a γ𝛾\\gamma-sheaf (see equation (3.2)). Therefore, this allows us to tackle the study of multi-parameter persistence modules via microlocal techniques without leaving apart computational considerations. On of the key aspects of sheaf theory is that any continuous map f:Y⟶X:𝑓⟶𝑌𝑋f:Y\\longrightarrow X between topological spaces induces a pair of adjoint functors (f−1,R​f∗)superscript𝑓1Rsubscript𝑓(f^{-1},\\mathrm{R}{f}_{*}) (inverse image and derived pushforward) between the associated derived categories of sheaves. In this language, the restriction of a persistence module M𝑀M to a line of positive slope ℒ⊂ℝnℒsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathcal{L}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{n} is the persistence module iℒ−1​Msuperscriptsubscript𝑖ℒ1𝑀i_{\\mathcal{L}}^{-1}M obtained by applying the inverse image functor of the inclusion of ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} into ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n} to M𝑀M. Therefore, the fibered barcode construction can be understood as a dimension reduction technique obtained by using inverse image functors along inclusion of one-dimensional sub-spaces. A natural question follows: what can we say about derived direct images of n𝑛n-parameters persistence modules (or, more generally, of constructible sheaves) along projections onto one-dimensional spaces? Indeed, the pushforward operation does not have an easy description in the language of persistence modules, though it is natural in the sheaf setting. In this work, we provide a detailed study of the pushforward operation on sheaves and persistence modules, both from a theoretical and computational perspective. Following the same strategy of reducing the study of multi-parameter persistence modules to the study of families of one-dimensional persistence modules, we introduce the notions of 𝔉𝔉\\mathfrak{F}-projected barcodes and 𝔉𝔉\\mathfrak{F}-integral sheaf metric (see equations (6.1) and (6.2)). The distance between two sheaves is the supremum of the distances between the pushforwards of the sheaves by morphisms belonging to a family 𝔉𝔉\\mathfrak{F}. Again, in a similar spirit, we introduce sliced convolution distances (see equations (6.6) and (7.3)). Implementing such an approach requires relating precisely the classical theory of persistence modules and sheaf theory. This has largely been achieved thanks to several works: [ref]1  [ref]3   1. Heuristically, this correspondence goes as follows. On our way, we prove several results and provide examples that may be of independent interest to the TDA community. In particular, we show that increasing the number of parameters of two filtrations of topological spaces can only increase the interleaving/convolution distance between their associated persistence modules/sheaves. In particular, this partially invalidates the classical saying that \"multi-parameter persistence is more robust to outliers than one-parameter persistence.\"\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: 2, is far more intricate.
