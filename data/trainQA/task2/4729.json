      "content": "Paper Title: 3D Scene Flow Estimation on Pseudo-LiDAR: Bridging the Gap on Estimating Point Motion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSome works study the estimation of dense scene flow from images of consecutive frames. Mono-SF  proposes ProbDepthNet to estimate the pixel depth distribution of the single image. Geometric information from multiple views and depth distribution information from a single view are used to jointly estimate the scene flow. Hur et al.  introduce a multi-frame temporal constraint to the scene flow estimation network. Chen et al.  develop a coarse-grained software framework for scene-flow methods and realize real-time cross-platform embedded scene flow algorithms. In addition, Rishav et al. 8 fuse LiDAR and images to estimate dense scene flow. But they still perform feature fusion in image space. These methods rely on 2D representations and cannot learn geometric motion from explicit 3D coordinates. The pseudo-LiDAR is the bridge between the 2D signal and the 3D signal, which provides the basis for directly learning the 3D scene flow from the 2D data. The original geometric information is preserved in the 3D point cloud, which is the preferred representation for many scene understanding applications in self-driving and robotics. Some researchers [ref]7 estimate 3D scene flow from LiDAR point clouds by using the classical method. Dewan et al. [ref]7 introduce local geometric constancy during the motion and introduce a triangular grid to determine the relationship of the points. Benefiting from the point cloud deep learning, some recent works [ref]8 [ref]9 0 1 propose to learn 3D scene flow from raw point clouds. FlowNet3D [ref]8 firstly proposes the flow embedding layer which finds point correspondence and implicitly represents the 3D scene flow. FLOT 0 studies lightweight structures for optimizing scene flow estimation using optimal transport modules. PointPWC-Net [ref]9 proposes novel learnable cost volume layers to learn 3D scene flow in a coarse-to-fine approach, and introduces three self-supervised losses to learn the 3D scene flow without accessing the ground truth. Mittal et al. 1 propose two new self-supervised loss.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: The original geometric information is preserved in the 3D point cloud, which is the preferred representation for many scene understanding applications in self-driving and robotics.
