      "content": "Paper Title: EKILA: Synthetic Media Provenance and Attribution for Generative Art\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDiffusion models underpin recent advances in GenAI 4   : DALL-E 2 , Imagen , and Stable Diffusion  require hundreds of millions of images to train and improve recent large GAN models  in terms of quality and diversity. Diffusion models typically condition generation upon a text-based prompt e.g., encoded via CLIP  often with additional modalities for fine-grained control of visual attributes   4. Recent studies have shown that duplication in training data can lead to content [ref]10 or style memorization  in diffusion models. Inversion attacks seek to hallucinate representative examples for given classes or prompts  4 often resembling training data. The problem of determining training set membership for diffusion models   has also been studied. Our work is closest to visual attribution approaches using CLIP   that measure the semantic similarity between generated and training whole images. However, we match on style and ``patchified\" local structure proposing a new model for this purpose which we show to outperform semantic  and RGB patch correlations [ref]10. Content Attribution has been explored from two perspectives: 1) detecting manipulation (e.g. deep fakes     ); 2) content attribution. Attribution is the focus of cross-industry coalitions (e.g., CAI , Origin ) and the emerging C2PA standard , which we leverage. C2PA communicates provenance information e.g. describing how an image was captured and what has been done to it, to aid users' trust decisions. This is achieved by embedding `manifests' – data packets – within the image metadata. The manifest encodes a signed graph structure of provenance records describing the content's capture and manipulation. If the manifest is stripped from the asset, it may be recovered using a perceptual hash  3 , or watermark   9 via look-up in a distributed database. Recently, visual fingerprinting has been used to detect and attribute images to the GenAI models that made them 1. Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) (colloquially, `blockchain') enables multiple independent parties to share an append-only data structure (ledger) without a centralized point of trust . Beyond crypto-currencies, DLT has been used to track ownership of creative works via the ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token (NFT) standard . NFTs are digital representations of assets, such as images, which may be openly traded on DLT, creating a history (provenance trail) of ownership.\nHowever, while owning an NFT grants the right to sell or dispose of that asset, it is undefined what else one has the right to do with the asset. EKILA adds a tokenized form of rights and leverages those smart contracts to mediate the payment of royalties to creators when those rights are exercised. Existing NFT royalty earning schemes are proprietary and limited to within-market sales, defeating the promise of NFT in creating decentralized markets for assets e.g. EIP-2981  seeks to standardize royalty earning contracts for asset re-sales only. NFTs derive their value from scarcity but contain no counter-measures against copy-minting. We combine NFT with a creation provenance standard (C2PA) to mitigate this threat.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: prompt e.g., encoded via CLIP  often with additional modalities for fine-grained control of visual attributes   4.
