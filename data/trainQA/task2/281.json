      "content": "Paper Title: Approximate Manifold Defense Against Multiple Adversarial Perturbations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe robust accuracy of a defense model is defined by their performance against the strongest adversarial attack within a specified ℓpsubscriptℓ𝑝\\ell_{p} boundary .\nFor RBF-CNN, we reconstruct images by drawing samples from the RBF filters.\nNoise is injected to the images during this sampling process using an isotropic Gaussian distribution (see Eqn. 4).\nThe RBF filters and the reconstruction step are otherwise differentiable. We apply the following wide range of adversarial attacks to evaluate the robustness of our models: Static Attacks.\nAdversarial examples are generated by removing the non-differentiable noise injection step from the reconstruction layer, i.e 𝒛𝒋=𝝁𝒋subscript𝒛𝒋subscript𝝁𝒋\\bm{z_{j}=\\mu_{j}} in Eqn. 4.\nHere, we consider single-step attack FGSM [ref]2, iterative attacks such as PGD [ref]6, MI-FGSM , CW [ref]38, DAA , EAD . Adaptive Attacks.\nAn adaptive attack is constructed after the defense model has been completely specified, such that the adversary can find the optimal adversarial perturbations within the specified perturbation boundaries . For our RBF-CNN models, we design the adaptive attack as a combination of BPDA and EoT (Expectation of Transformations) , as follows.\nIn the forward propagation, we do not change anything in the network.\nIn the backward propagation, we choose a differentiable approximation for the reconstruction layer, by considering 𝒛𝒋=𝝁𝒋subscript𝒛𝒋subscript𝝁𝒋\\bm{z_{j}=\\mu_{j}} in Eqn. 4 to efficiently compute the gradients.\nSince the RBF filters are already differentiable, we do not need any approximation for the RBF layer.\nWe compute the expected loss using a Monte-Carlo method with 505050 simulations to find the strongest adversarial examples. Black-box Attacks. We also evaluate against gradient-free SPSA attack  to ensure that our framework is not giving any false sense of robustness using gradient-masking .\nWe apply black-box transfer attacks where the adversarial examples are generated by attacking a standard CNN classifier with no defense. ℓ∞subscriptℓ\\ell_{\\infty} Bounded Attacks.\nTable I presents the performance of our r​C​N​N𝑟𝐶𝑁𝑁rCNN and r​C​N​N+𝑟𝐶𝑁subscript𝑁rCNN_{+} models against ℓ∞subscriptℓ\\ell_{\\infty} bounded attacks.\nWe choose the perturbation boundaries of 0.30.30.3 and 0.0310.0310.031 for MNIST and CIFAR-10 respectively.\nWe observe that for both MNIST and CIFAR-10, r​C​N​N+𝑟𝐶𝑁subscript𝑁rCNN_{+} achieves high robustness under ℓ∞subscriptℓ\\ell_{\\infty} perturbations bounds of 0.30.30.3 and 0.0310.0310.031 respectively. One main advantage of RBF-CNN compared to the adversarial training frameworks is that it significantly reduces the training time required.\nHere, we compare the training times of our RBF-CNN models with Madry’s models, that achieved robustness only for ℓ∞subscriptℓ\\ell_{\\infty} perturbations [ref]6. Table II shows the training times when executed on a GTX 1080Ti GPU.\nWe observe that the training time of r​C​N​N+𝑟𝐶𝑁subscript𝑁rCNN_{+} models are more than 4.5×4.5\\times and 7×7\\times faster than the Madry models for MNIST and CIFAR-10 respectively.\nEven as our proposed approach significantly reduces the training time required, our RBF-CNN models are still able to achieve similar performances as Madry’s models for ℓ∞subscriptℓ\\ell_{\\infty} perturbations in both MNIST and CIFAR-10 as shown in Table III.\nAlso, our best RBF-CNN model for MNIST significantly outperforms the only successful manifold defense model by Schott et al. (2019) .\nWe also compare with other input transformation  and network randomization  techniques to show that unlike these defenses, our RBF-CNN models remain robust against all type of attacks. Another limitation of adversarial training models is that they provide robustness only within a pre-specified boundary from where the adversarial examples were produced for their training, and offer no robustness guarantee slightly beyond these boundaries.\nTable IV shows that [ref]6 achieve high robust accuracies within their specified ℓ∞subscriptℓ\\ell_{\\infty} bounds of 0.30.30.3 and 0.0310.0310.031 for MNIST and CIFAR-10 respectively.\nHowever, their robust accuracies drastically drop beyond those bounds when tested against PGD attack with ℓ∞≤0.35subscriptℓ0.35\\ell_{\\infty}\\leq 0.35 for MNIST and at ℓ∞≤0.05subscriptℓ0.05\\ell_{\\infty}\\leq 0.05 for CIFAR-10.\nIn contrast, RBF-CNN models achieve significantly high accuracies at these ℓ∞subscriptℓ\\ell_{\\infty} boundaries. ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1} and ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2} Bounded Attacks. \nFor our experiments on ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1} and ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2} bounded attacks, we choose ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}=15 and ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}=2 for MNIST and ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1}=20 and ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}=1 for CIFAR-10.\nFor MNIST, we see that the perception of the adversarial images is changing around these bounds (see Fig. 4).\nNote that, such behavior cannot be observed when attacking a non-robust classifier . Table V presents the performance of RBF-CNNs against different ℓ1subscriptℓ1\\ell_{1} and ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2} bounded attacks.\nWe observe that RBF-CNN models significantly outperform Madry’s models, that are trained to provide robustness for ℓ∞subscriptℓ\\ell_{\\infty} perturbations. Certification for ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}-perturbations. \nCertification provides a lower bound guarantee of robust accuracy.\nSince the reconstruction process of our RBF-CNN models mitigate any minor perturbations, it also improves the classification performance against random Gaussian perturbed images.\nWe apply the existing certification technique of randomized smoothing defenses  to further demonstrate that our RBF-CNN models also improve the certified robustness for ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2} perturbations compared to the baseline models with no defense. For each input 𝒙𝒙{\\bm{x}}, we sample 50,0005000050,000 noisy samples from an isotropic Gaussian distribution ϵ∼𝒩​(0,τ2​I)similar-tobold-italic-ϵ𝒩0superscript𝜏2𝐼{\\bm{\\epsilon}}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\tau^{2}I).\nFor MNIST, we set τ𝜏\\tau to 0.20.20.2 for the baseline and r​C​N​N𝑟𝐶𝑁𝑁rCNN and 0.30.30.3 for r​C​N​N+𝑟𝐶𝑁subscript𝑁rCNN_{+}.\nFor CIFAR-10, we set τ=0.1𝜏0.1\\tau=0.1 for all the models.\nTable VI shows the certified robust accuracies.\nWe see that for CIFAR-10, the robustness of the CNN classifier is improved by adding RBF and reconstruction layers.\nThe results for r​C​N​N+𝑟𝐶𝑁subscript𝑁rCNN_{+} suggests that the certified robustness of our models are further improved by augmenting minor noises the images for training.\nTo summarize, our RBF-CNN models improves the empirical robustness against any minor ℓp≥1subscriptℓ𝑝1\\ell_{p\\geq 1} perturbations as well as certified robustness for ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2} perturbations.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: by removing the non-differentiable noise injection step from the reconstruction layer, i.e 𝒛𝒋=𝝁𝒋subscript𝒛𝒋subscript𝝁𝒋\\bm{z_{j}=\\mu_{j}} in Eqn. 4.\nHere, we consider single-step attack FGSM [ref]2, iterative attacks such as PGD [ref]6, MI-FGSM , CW [ref]38, DAA , EAD .
