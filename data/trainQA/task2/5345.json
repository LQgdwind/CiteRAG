      "content": "Paper Title: Universal Detection of Backdoor Attacks via Density-based Clustering and Centroids Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this paragraph, we describe the Density-based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise (DBSCAN) [ref]29 algorithm used by CCA-UD.\nDBSCAN splits a set of points into K𝐾K clusters and possibly few outliers, where K𝐾K is automatically determined by counting the areas with high sample density. Specifically, given a point ‘A’ of the set, DBSCAN counts the number of neighbours (including ‘A’ itself) within a distance ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon from ‘A’. If the number of neighbours is larger than or equal to a threshold m​i​n​P​t​s𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑃𝑡𝑠minPts, ‘A’ is defined to be a core point and all points in its ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-neighbourhood are said to be directly reachable from ‘A’. If a point, say ‘B’, of the reachable set is again a core point, all the points in its ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-neighbours are also reachable from ‘A’.\nReachable non-core points are said to be border points, while the points which are not reachable from any core point are considered to be outliers. To define a cluster, DBSCAN also introduces the notion of density-connectedness. We say that two points ‘A’ and ‘B’ are density-connected if there is a point ‘C’, from which both ‘A’ and ‘B’ are reachable (hence ‘C’ must be a core point).\nA clusters is defined as a group of points satisfying the following two properties:\ni) the points within a cluster are mutually density-connected; ii) any point directly-reachable from some point of the cluster, it is part of the cluster.\nThe intuition behind DBSCAN is to define the clusters as dense regions separated by border points.\nThe number of dense regions found in the set automatically determines the number of clusters K𝐾K. More information about the exact way the clusters are found and the (in-)dependence of DBSCAN on the initial point ‘A’ used to start the definition of core and reachable points, are given in the original paper [ref]29. The performance of DBSCAN is determined by the choice of the parameters involved in its definition, that is m​i​n​P​t​s𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑃𝑡𝑠minPts and ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon, whose setting depends on the problem at hand.\nThe setting of these parameters in CCA-UD is discussed in Section IV-C, while their impact of the performance on CCA-UD is evaluated in the ablation study reported in the supplementary material.\n\n We choose to adopt a density-based clustering method as the backbone of CCA-UD, since density-based clustering is known to work well also in the presence of clusters with unbalanced size , and because it provides an automatic way to determine the number of clusters222DBSCAN is one of most popular density-based clustering algorithms, other choices, like OPTICS  and HDBSCAN [ref]34) would work as well..\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: In this paragraph, we describe the Density-based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise (DBSCAN) [ref]29 algorithm used by CCA-UD.\nDBSCAN splits a set of points into K𝐾K clusters and possibly few outliers, where K𝐾K is automatically determined by counting the areas with high sample density.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
