      "content": "Paper Title: The Scattering Compositional Learner: Discovering Objects, Attributes, Relationships in Analogical Reasoning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere has been an old debate over the limits of connectionism for compositional generalization. In a set of influential and\ncontroversial papers, Jerry Fodor and other researchers criticized neural networks for failing to model the intricacy of mind because they cannot capture systematic compositionality    . These issues have received less attention since deep learning revolutionized various domains.\nHowever, there have been a few papers recently bringing up these issues again, after observing non-robustness in the systematic generalization of neural networks [ref]26 [ref]28   . Our work is an attempt to address the issues of systematic generalization with an architectural bias that respects compositions. We advocate for the same principle as those methods in the past that add modularity for better generalization, such as Neural Module Networks(NMN) , NTPT 3, MAC , Neural Symbolic Concept Learner , CRL . Our work is differentiated from the past work, in that our architecture is specifically designed for learning compositions of a sequence of neural modules, whereas the past work relied on symbolic information (e.g., language in NMN, NSCL, MAC; source code in NTPT), or non-differentiable search (e.g., NSCL, CRL) to compose neural modules in task-specific layout. A more detailed comparison of these approaches is provided in Appendix D. SCL also shares some similarities with the group convolution architecture  and its followup work such as ResNeXt 8. Similarly, they perform the “split” operation, dividing the computation into multiple groups. However, the transformations in these architectures do not share parameters among groups, whereas “share” is a key component in our architecture (see Scattering Transformation in Section 3). We present ablation studies to show that our model without parameter sharing could not learn at all (in Appendix E), demonstrating the importance of this distinction. Raven’s Progressive Matrices 2 (RPM) are studied extensively in cognitive science [ref]7. It is considered as a diagnostic of human’s abstract and structural reasoning ability [ref]7, and characterizes a central feature of high-level intelligence, namely fluid intelligence .\nIn the machine learning community, following on the work by Wang and Su 7, Santoro et al. 4 introduced the Procedurally Generating Matrices (PGM) dataset of RPM-like problems. They proposed an advanced version of Relational Network 3, Wild Relational Network (WReN), and studied its generalization on this dataset. Followup work 6 showed the importance of candidate sets in learning analogies. Zhang et al. 9 extended PGM and created the dataset RAVEN, with a larger number of relationships in each problem, a task that is considered to be harder than PGM in symbolic reasoning. Several methods have been proposed since then to solve these tasks, including 1, 0 and 6. However, recently, Hu et al. 9 pointed out a short-cut solution in RAVEN which exploited artifacts in the candidate generation procedure. They then created an unbiased version called Balanced-RAVEN which eliminated these artifacts; this is the dataset we have conducted most of our experiments on. Lastly, copycat 8 is a cognitive architecture designed to discover insightful analogies, a classical AI approach for analogical reasoning. Its followup Phaeaco 2 was able to demonstrate limited successes in a problem similar to RPM – the Bongard problems . These systems use hand-crafted features and patterns detectors, hence they require heavy engineering efforts to scale to challenging analogical reasoning tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: revolutionized various domains.\nHowever, there have been a few papers recently bringing up these issues again, after observing non-robustness in the systematic generalization of neural networks [ref]26 [ref]28   .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
