      "content": "Paper Title: Torch-Points3D: A Modular Multi-Task Framework for Reproducible Deep Learning on 3D Point Clouds\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, the field of automated analysis of 3D data has been transformed by the development of new dedicated neural network architectures.\nThis sudden spur in methodological advancements is reminiscent of the revolution undergone by image analysis in the early 2010s, initiated by AlexNet .\nThe number of methods and papers dedicated to 3D data presented at major vision conferences is now on par with images, and keeps growing each year. The young field of deep learning for 3D has greatly pushed forward the state-of-the-art performance of automated analysis of point clouds for numerous tasks. For example, the top performance on the indoor dataset S3DIS  (6-fold) have gone from 41.741.741.7% mIoU points (mean Intersection over Union) in 2017 [ref]33, to 62.1%percent62.162.1\\% only a year later 5, and up to 70.670.670.6% in 2019 .\nWhile this rapid methodological development is of course beneficial to the community, its fast pace comes with several shortcomings: Adding new datasets, tasks, or neural architectures to existing approaches requires a substantial commitment, often tantamount to a complete re-implementation. This limits the use of new networks, and prevents exhaustive comparisons. Handling large 3D datasets efficiently requires a significant time investment, and overcoming many implementation pitfalls. This creates soft barriers to entry, restraining the diffusion of new ideas. There is no standard approach for inference scheme and metrics in research papers. This makes assessing the intrinsic performance of new algorithms difficult, and their reproducibility not always straightforward. In this paper, we introduce Torch-Points3D, a flexible and powerful development framework aiming to address these issues. In short, the purpose of our framework is to become for 3D point clouds what torchvision [ref]31 or pytorch-geometric 3 have become for images and graphs respectively. More generally, our goal is to address the growing technical debt pervasive to machine learning research codes. This is particularly crucial for 3D data, for which many steps require special care in order to not invalidate investigations, from data loading and preprocessing to the computation of performance metrics. By proposing tried and tested implementations, which only get more robust as the user community grows, we aim to further increase the rigor of 3D deep learning. Torch-Points3D is intended for novices as much as experts. It provides intuitive interfaces with most open-access 3D datasets, re-implementations of many of the top-performing networks, classic data augmentation schemes and validated performance metric. This allows researchers to focus on the development of core algorithms and test them on all available datasets with minimal effort. The different components of Torch-Points3D are highly customizable and can be plugged into one another with a unified system of configuration files. Users can then easily swap backbone networks for a given task, leading to the efficient selection of the best-suited algorithms, as well as facilitating comparison with new approaches. On this front, our framework makes it easy to standardize experimental protocols, ensuring both reproducibility and that models’ performances are evaluated on equal footing. Finally, we propose a multitude of quality-of-life features such as open logs with Weight and Biases , versatile model configuration handling with Hydra , and bespoke visualization functions as illustrated in Figure 1. To illustrate the capabilities of Torch-Points3D, we propose several numerical experiments: We evaluated the performance of different backbone networks in a recent object detection method. We benchmark different methods over several datasets with a unified protocol, aiming to assess their inherent performance. We quantify the benefit of implemented test-time enhancers, such as voting schemes. We present our point clouds registration implementation within our framework, combining recent papers and reaching state-of-the-art performance. We share key findings about speed enhancing procedures that can be leveraged on any model supported by the framework.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: analysis of point clouds for numerous tasks.
