      "content": "Paper Title: Dual ResGCN for Balanced Scene Graph Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVisual scene graph generation (SGG) aims to identify the classes of objects and their relations in a given image, which is a challenging vision task.\nDifferent from other tasks such as object detection [ref]1 [ref]2, object classification   and semantic segmentation  , scene understanding goes beyond the whereabouts of objects, but more importantly establishes a scene graph among objects through the transfer and mutual understanding of relations.\nSuch a scene graph provides a structured representation of an image that can support a wide range of high-level visual tasks, including image captioning , visual question answering  , image retrieval  , and image generation . In existing works, there are two categories of methods\nfor scene graph generation. Methods in the first category jointly predict the classes of objects and their relations based on the object and relation proposals    . Methods in the second category detect the objects first and then predict the relations of object pairs     [ref]21.\nAmong these methods, the chain graph [ref]21 and the fully connected graphs      are two prevalent types of structures to model the relations among objects, which have made great progress for scene graph generation. However, these methods are developed without the explicit consideration of the class imbalance problem in the existing databases of scene graph generation.\nAs revealed in , some relations such as ‘on’ occupy a large portion in the databases, referred to as frequent relations, while some other relations such as ‘parked on’ and ‘walking in’ occupy a small portion, referred to as infrequent relations. If a model is directly trained on a database whose class distribution is seriously skewed, it tends to predict a relation to be a frequent relation rather than an infrequent relation.\nFor example, the bottom row of Fig. 1 shows the scene graph generated by a state-of-the-art model .\nAll the predicted relations are frequent relations, i.e., ‘on’ or ‘near’, but the infrequent relations such as ‘parked on’ and ‘in front of’ are more accurate and provide more fine-grained understanding for complicate interactions among objects. In terms of quantitative performance, learning a model without explicitly considering the class imbalance will lead to a good score in Recall, but a poor score in mean Recall.\nBecause when a model tends to predict the frequent relations, the recall would be high for these frequent relations, but the recall could be low for infrequent ones. As frequent relations dominate the portion of the whole database, the total Recall is high, but the mean Recall is poor because of the poor performance of infrequent relations.\nHence, both Recall and mean Recall are important and necessary evaluation metrics when the database is seriously skewed, especially the mean recall. To alleviate the influence of the class imbalance on the prediction of infrequent relations, we propose a novel network, i.e., dual ResGCN, which consists of an object residual graph convolutional network (Object ResGCN) and a relation residual graph convolutional network (Relation ResGCN). They are complementary to each other.\nThe former takes object features as nodes and aggregates object-level context information. Different previous methods which utilize the popular first-order linear model,\nwe adopt a novel cross-attention model to produce attention\nmaps that guide feature aggregation.\nBesides, we stack multiple contextual coefficients to help alleviate the imbalance issue and enrich the prediction diversity.\nThe latter treats relation features as nodes and aggregates relation-level context information among relations. It explicitly models the connections among relations to help alleviate the class imbalance issue.\nAs revealed in , the second-order features in graph (i.e., the edge features) are more informative and discriminative.\nIt captures higher-level information and outputs more discriminative features.\nIf using only the Object ResGCN, the prediction of the relation depends on the information from the mounted objects.\nIt tends to predict the frequent relation according to the co-occurrence of two mounted objects.\nOn the contrary, when cooperating with the complementary Relation ResGCN, the prediction of the relation depends on not only the information from the associated objects but also the information from other relation nodes.\nMoreover, the inputs of the Relation ResGCN consist of the features of the objects as well as the visual features of their union region.\nThe union region contains the contextual information of the interacted objects, which provides some cues to help alleviate the influence of the class imbalance. Besides the novel network, we propose to incorporate prior knowledge about relation pairs into the graph to alleviate the class imbalance issue.\nThey are exploited in the context aggregation process for the Relation ResGCN.\nGood context prior ( e.g., man wearing shirt rather than riding) can effectively regularize the distribution of possible relations of object pairs and thus makes prediction less ambiguous , while the undesirable long-tailed prior makes the relation prediction collapse (e.g., parked on, sitting on collapsed to on).\nTo take advantage of the good prior and avoid the long-tailed prior, we count the co-occurrence probability of all relations.\nTo alleviate the side effects of the long-tailed bias, we count a type of relation only once in an image, i.e., if a relation occurs multiple times in an image, we count it only once.\nCombining the learnable graph with the prior graph can effectively regularize the graph structure, leading to more balanced predictions.\nPlease note that using the class distribution to weigh the losses in the objective is a common strategy to tackle the class imbalance.\nHowever, this strategy introduces a set of hyperparameters to tune.\nDifferently, we incorporate the prior into the structure without additional hyperparameters. The main contributions of this work are two-fold. We propose a novel and effective complementary network, dubbed dual ResGCN, which alleviates the class imbalance issue by capturing the relation-level and object-level contexts, as well as the co-occurrence prior of relation. We perform extensive experiments and ablation studies of three tasks (SGDet, SGCls, and PredCls) on the large-scale dataset VG to demonstrate the superiority of our method.\nOur absolute improvement of infrequent relations over state-of-the-art methods is up to 17.74%.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: scene graph generation (SGG) aims to identify the classes of objects and their relations in a given image, which is a challenging vision task.\nDifferent from other tasks such as object detection [ref]1 [ref]2, object classification   and semantic segmentation  , scene understanding goes beyond the whereabouts of objects, but more importantly establishes a scene graph among objects through\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
