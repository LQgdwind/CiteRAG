      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Video Prediction from a Single Frame by Estimating 3D Dynamic Scene Structure\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe evaluate our model on two challenging datasets of real-world videos.\nWaymo Open Perception [ref]42 (waymo) contains 1150 videos of length 20s at 10FPS, filmed by an autonomous car’s sensor suite333This dataset is licensed for research use and available at https://waymo.com/open/.\nWe use the main front-facing camera only, and the official train/validation/test splits.\nAs this dataset is relatively small, for final evaluation on the test split, we train on the union of the train and val splits, keeping the hyperparameters fixed.\nWe downsample the frames to 384×256384256384\\times 256 to use as input for our model, and use 6-frame clips.\nRealEstate10K  (re10k) contains approximately 79000 videos of varying duration, typically a few seconds444This dataset is available at https://google.github.io/realestate10k/, with no license specified.\nFor testing, we use the first 250 videos from the validation split, as there is no test set released.\nThe original dataset has a frame-rate of 30FPS; we subsample it to 10FPS, which makes the task more challenging as there is more movement from frame to frame.\nWe downsample then center-crop the frames to 384×256384256384\\times 256, and use 12-frame clips.\nFor both datasets, we use the provided camera intrinsics (i.e. focal length and principal point).\nDuring training we sample clips randomly from within each video; we also apply data augmentation: random horizontal flipping, and random perturbations to contrast and color (see Appendix D for details).\nDuring testing we take just one clip per video, starting at the first frame.\nWe emphasize that the chosen datasets have significant camera motion and perspective effects, in contrast to datasets often used to evaluate video prediction that have a static camera and background [ref]40 8 . input            t=0.1​s𝑡0.1𝑠t=0.1s          t=0.2​s𝑡0.2𝑠t=0.2s          t=0.3​s𝑡0.3𝑠t=0.3s          t=0.4​s𝑡0.4𝑠t=0.4s          t=0.5​s𝑡0.5𝑠t=0.5s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n We name our model ViPL4S, short for Video Prediction with Latent 4D Scenes.\nOn waymo, we compare three variants of our model.\nViPL4Sgm uses the general camera motion model (2), allowing arbitrary motion.\nViPL4Sveh uses the more-specialized vehicle motion model, with fewer degrees of freedom in the motion parametrization.\nViPL4S6-cpt uses six motion components, instead of four for the previous variants. Thus, the model can separate the scene into more independently-moving regions, which may be beneficial in scenes with a large number of vehicles moving at different velocities.\nOn re10k, we only use the general motion parametrization (ViPL4Sgm), as the videos are shot using handheld cameras and drones.\nWe also do not experiment with more motion components, as moving objects are exceedingly rare in this dataset.\nWe implemented our model in TensorFlow ; the code will be made public soon.\nHyperparameters were set by incremental searches over groups of related parameters; we did not perform an exhaustive search due to computational constraints.\nThe values used for our experiments are given in Appendix E.\nAs a baseline, we use the state-of-the-art stochastic video prediction model SRVP 3.\nWe adapted their publicly-available implementation555The code is Apache licensed and available at https://github.com/edouardelasalles/srvp slightly to our setting, increasing the encoder and decoder depth, and re-tuned the hyperparameters on our datasets.\nEach model was trained on four Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti GPUs (or two for SRVP) on a local compute cluster, until validation-set convergence or for a maximum of five days (whichever was sooner). We evaluate performance using five metrics.\nPSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS  are standard image-similarity metrics; to evaluate stochastic video generation, we follow the common protocol   3 of drawing 100 samples from our model for each input, evaluating the metrics on each sample, and taking the best.\nThese three metrics therefore measure how similar is the closest sample from a model to the ground-truth clip.\nFréchet video distance (FVD)  and kernel video distance (KVD)   measure how close a distribution of generated videos is to the ground-truth distribution; they both operate by passing sets of ground-truth and generated videos through the action-recognition network of , then measuring divergences of the resulting distributions of features.\nThese two metrics therefore measure the realism and diversity of outputs from a model, without considering whether the true future frames are predicted for each clip.\nFor a fair comparison with 3, we sample images at 128×128128128128\\times 128 resolution for the quantitative evaluation—the same as for their model.\nFor all results, we report the mean and standard deviation over three runs with different random seeds. input            t=0.2​s𝑡0.2𝑠t=0.2s          t=0.4​s𝑡0.4𝑠t=0.4s          t=0.6​s𝑡0.6𝑠t=0.6s          t=0.8​s𝑡0.8𝑠t=0.8s          t=1.2​s𝑡1.2𝑠t=1.2s\n\n\\begin{overpic}[width=433.62pt]{images/24237800_ckpt-10_0016_00_frames.png}\\put(5.0,0.8){{\\color[rgb]{1,1,1}\\scriptsize predicted depth}}\\end{overpic}\n\n\n\\begin{overpic}[width=433.62pt]{images/24237800_ckpt-10_0022_00_frames.png}\\put(5.0,0.8){{\\color[rgb]{1,1,1}\\scriptsize predicted depth}}\\end{overpic}\n\n\n\\begin{overpic}[width=433.62pt]{images/24237800_ckpt-10_0024_00_frames.png}\\put(5.0,0.8){{\\color[rgb]{1,1,1}\\scriptsize predicted depth}}\\end{overpic}\n Quantitative results from our method and the baseline are given in Table 1.\nOn both datasets, our general model ViPL4Sgm outperforms SRVP 3 across all metrics.\nIn particular, higher PSNR and SSIM, and lower LPIPS, indicate that the closest samples from our model to the true frames for each clip, are significantly more similar than the closest samples from SRVP.\nThe difference is significantly smaller for PSNR, likely because this is less sensitive to small-scale and textural details, which we found SRVP predicts poorly.\nFVD and KVD are substantially lower for our method, indicating that the distribution of clips generated is also closer to the ground-truth distribution than those generated by SRVP.\nOverall, PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS are worse for re10k than waymo; this may be due to larger areas of the image being textured than waymo, which has extensive, smooth sky and road regions (note that FVD and KVD are not directly comparable across datasets, due to the nature of the metrics ). The two additional variants of our model tested on waymo, ViPL4Sveh and ViPL4S6-cpt also perform better than SRVP.\nHowever, the 6-component variant is slightly worse than the standard (4-component) variant, despite having strictly greater expressive power.\nWe hypothesize this is due to optimization difficulties, as we observed for example that the model may reach local optima where several components are used to model different parts of the static background, when one would suffice.\nIn contrast, the variant with a camera motion parametrization specialized to vehicles performs slightly better than that with a general motion model.\nWhile the differences are within error bars for some metrics, this still provides some support for the hypothesis that incorporating extra prior knowledge helps the generative model learn efficiently. In Figure 2, we show examples of the 3D structure and motion segmentations predicted by our model ViPL4Sveh for clips from waymo.\nFor each input frame, the model samples diverse but plausible motion segmentations.\nIn particular, it has discovered without supervision that cars are sometimes (but not always) in motion, as are pedestrians.\nIn Figure 3 we show examples of clips sampled from the same model, and from SRVP 3.\nOur ability to segment moving cars results in sequences where we can observe relative motion between camera, cars and background, including significant variation between samples for the same input frame.\nThe corresponding samples from SRVP typically do not exhibit coherent motion, in contrast to those from our model. Finally, we show sampled clips and 3D structure for re10k in Figure 4, for both ViPL4S and SRVP.\nHere we model longer (12-frame) sequences, but only show every second frame.\nThe depth-maps are typically accurate around edges, but poor in untextured regions, due to the lack of learning signal here from the reconstruction loss.\nStill, the reconstructed clips are plausible; the model has successfully learnt how the camera moves in the training data (e.g. it does not pass through walls).\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: We evaluate our model on two challenging datasets of real-world videos.\nWaymo Open Perception [ref]42 (waymo) contains 1150 videos of length 20s at 10FPS, filmed by an autonomous car’s sensor suite333This dataset is licensed for research use and available at https://waymo.com/open/.\nWe use\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
