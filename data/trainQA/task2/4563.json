      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Practical Single-shot Phase Retrieval with Physics-Driven Deep Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPhase retrieval (PR) intends to reconstruct a complex-valued signal only from its Fourier intensity measurements. It is a key problem in crystallography  , optical imaging , astronomical imaging , diffraction imaging , etc. PR is also a crucial component of holographic imaging . The investigation of PR methods was initiated in the 1970s. Numerous reconstruction approaches were developed by the optics research community   . Recently, the developments in modern optimization theories  [ref]9 0 and computational imaging 1 2 provided further understanding of the problem. From the mathematical perspective, the PR problem can be expressed as follows [ref]9: where ùê±‚àà‚ÑÇNùê±superscript‚ÑÇùëÅ\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{N} is the complex-valued signal of interest; ùìßùìß\\bm{\\mathcal{X}} denotes the Fourier intensity measurements; ‚àò\\circ and ‚Ñ±‚Ñ±\\mathcal{F} stand for elementwise multiplication and Fourier transform, respectively. The pre-determined optical masks ùê°ùê°\\mathbf{h} are optional; they are for providing the constraints to lessen the problem‚Äôs ill-posedness. There are various methods for the implementation of the masks. For example, early PR approaches considered the non-zero signal support as the optical masks . However, these traditional methods cannot ensure globally optimal solutions (uniqueness condition) nor the convergence of the optimization procedure. In recent years, random masks were employed as powerful constraints for the optimization process  3. They can be implemented using a digital micromirror device (DMD) or spatial light modulator (SLM) 4 5. Although the use of random masks can improve the reconstruction performance, the high cost and inaccuracy of the DMD and SLM devices deter the general application of the method. Besides, it is empirically shown in [ref]9  that around 4‚àí6464-6 measurements are needed for accurate reconstruction with random binary masks. It increases the data acquisition time and is thus undesirable for dynamic applications. For solving (1), different iterative optimization methods, such as ADMM 6, Wirtinger Flow , etc., are generally used. These approaches are extremely time-consuming. Thus, the resulting PR methods are not suitable for any real-time applications. In the last three decades, deep neural networks (DNN) have been widely studied and successfully applied to different applications 7. They were also used in the PR problems 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7. Different from the traditional optimization-based approaches, the deep learning-based PR methods can work with only a single Fourier intensity measurement. These methods can fit in some feedforward DNN structures to achieve real-time performance when processing with GPU. Nevertheless, the accuracy of these methods still has much room to improve. It is still a challenge to directly infer a complex-valued signal from its Fourier intensity due to the enormous discrepancy between a signal in the Fourier and spatial domains. To improve the accuracy, researchers also suggested the physics-driven method 2 in which the intensity measurement was used to inform a plug-and-play optimization process. However, the method is iterative and as time-consuming as the traditional optimization-based methods. Besides using the plug-and-play structure, researchers also introduced the physics information to the PR process by directly plugging in the HIO algorithm  running alternately with a DNN in an iterative procedure 7. These physics-driven approaches have a common characteristic that they apply the physics information to a traditional optimization method and let it work iteratively with a network model. However, in this case, the system cannot be end-to-end trained. The estimation error of the optimization algorithm may have a special distribution that is unknown to the network model. The iterative process can thus be trapped at a local minimum and fails to give the best solution. One common problem of these deep learning-based PR methods is that most of them are trained and tested with simulation data. Except for noises, they often ignored the other artifacts in practical Fourier intensity measurements. It makes their reported results unreliable. Most PR applications involve structured images, which have energy concentrated at low frequencies (in particular, the d.c.). The dynamic range of the data in an intensity measurement is thus extremely large. Most general imaging devices nowadays have only a 121212 to 161616 bits dynamic range. It makes the low-frequency part of the intensity image severely saturated. As we have shown in Section IV-A, the saturation problem can significantly affect the performance of PR methods. To rectify the abovementioned problems, we propose in this paper a novel physics-driven deep learning-based PR method dubbed PPRNet. Similar to other deep learning-based PR methods, PPRNet requires only one Fourier intensity measurement for each PR reconstruction. It, however, gives a much higher accuracy by using a physics-driven method that guides the network to follow the Fourier intensity measurement at different scales to reconstruct the images. The resulting network structure is still of feedforward type. Thus, it is much faster than the iterative physics-driven approaches. The whole network can be end-to-end trained to give the best result. PPRNet is enabled by a novel Hybrid Unwinding Block (HUB) embedded in a multi-scale convolutional neural network (CNN) structure. It directs the input feature map into two paths such that the global and local information of the feature map at different scales are separately processed with physics informed. The data are then combined with a channel attention method so that the significant features are collected for reconstructing the images. To evaluate the generality of the proposed PPRNet, we have conducted a series of simulations with 222 different datasets that contain complex-valued images with linearly correlated and uncorrelated magnitude and phase. All data in the intensity image were capped to be represented by 121212-bit integers to simulate the saturation problem with quantization errors. We then adopted the defocusing method 8 to mitigate the saturation problem in the intensity images. As shown in the simulation results, the proposed PPRNet significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning-based PR methods. To understand the performance of the proposed PPRNet in practical applications, we constructed an optical setup for generating the intensity measurements of phase-only images obtained from 333 datasets. Naturally, all intensity measurements had a serious saturation problem in their low-frequency data. We again used the defocusing method to mitigate the effect of the problem. They were then used for the training and testing of the proposed PPRNet. Based on these experimental data, we compared the proposed PPRNet with the state-of-the-art deep learning-based PR methods. A significant improvement in the accuracy is noted. It also has lower complexity than other physics-driven PR methods. To summarize, the contribution of this work is three-folded: 1. A physics-driven deep learning-based PR method, namely PPRNet, is developed. It requires only a single Fourier intensity measurement for each PR reconstruction without the need for any additional masking scheme to impose constraints on the measurement. It allows the Fourier intensity measurement to inform the training and inferencing processes so that the model is guided to give the right solution. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach and the improvement it brings over the traditional deep learning-based PR methods. PPRNet has a non-iterative feedforward structure and is end-to-end trained. It has lower complexity than the existing physics-driven approaches while having higher accuracy. 2. A novel Hybrid Unwinding Block (HUB) is proposed. While the proposed PPRNet has a multi-scale structure, HUBs are embedded at different scales of the network to facilitate the utilization of the physics information to guide the training and inferencing of the network. It separately processes the global and local information of the feature maps with the aid of the Fourier intensity measurement and combines them with a channel attention method. Our ablation study has shown the importance of HUB in PPRNet. 3. Different from the traditional deep learning-based PR approaches that are trained and tested with simulation data, we construct an optical platform to evaluate the proposed PPRNet and compare it with the state-of-the-art approaches. The results are thus more reliable to reflect the true performances in practical applications. This paper is organized as follows. Section II provides a comprehensive review of the traditional optimization-based algorithms and deep learning-based PR approaches. Section III introduces the proposed PPRNet. The simulation results and ablation studies are shown in Section IV. The experiment results and comparisons with the existing methods are shown in Section V, followed by the conclusion in Section VI.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: of PR methods was initiated in the 1970s.
