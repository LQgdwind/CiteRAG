      "content": "Paper Title: SpOctA: A 3D Sparse Convolution Accelerator with Octree-Encoding-Based Map Search and Inherent Sparsity-Aware Processing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFig. 10(a) presents the detailed implementation results of SpOctA.\nSpOctA achieves 200GOPS at 400MHz while dissipating 83.7mW at 1V and occupying 1.06mm2.\nFig. 10(c) breaks down the hardware consumption.\nIt can be noticed that DRAM accesses consume only 23% energy benefiting from the effective management strategies, and OCTENT core only covers 20% area overhead with 17% on-chip SRAM. Comparisons with state-of-the-art point-cloud accelerators are depicted in Fig. 10(a) as well, where [ref]29 focuses on PointNet-based algorithm[ref]30 and    are for SpConv-based networks.\nAlthough our benchmark Seg(i) applies 2.5×\\times larger dataset (50k points per frame in ScanNet) and 5.8×\\times deeper network, comparable energy efficiency and framerates (84fps normalized to 600GOPS) with [ref]29 are also attained on indoor segmentation task.\nMeanwhile, SpOctA provides complete support of promissing sparse convolution operators instead of PointNet-based network , which is inefficient and impractical for large-scale point cloud processing, such as urban autonomous driving scenes[ref]15 . Compared to the related SpConv-based works   , our work achieves 1.5-3.1×\\times energy efficiency improvement with 1.1-6.9×\\times acceleration because of tactics evaluated in Section VI-B.\nThe detailed speedup is exhibited in Fig. 10(b), which is normalized with the peak throughputs for a fair comparison.\n reuses the PE array for map search to save area and power overhead, but it limits the possibility of pipeline processing.\nFine-grained pipeline between search and computing makes our work outperform  on Seg(i) benchmark despite testing on a heavier workload  than SUN RGB-D.\n unifies all kinds of point cloud convolution into ranking-based computation to accomplish excellent compatibility, involving redundant operations for SpConv inevitably.\nSpOctA focuses on SpConv operators and simplifies the map search through OCTENT methodology so that 6.9×\\times speedup is achieved compared to  on Seg(o) test.\nFor object detection benchmarks Det(k)&Det(n), the work in  adopts parallel search engine with smart multi-core scheduling to improve the throughput significantly, but the framerates that are less than 20fps are still insufficient at urban autonomous driving scenes.\nOur work introduces sparsity-aware computing strategy to reduce massive computation cost and processing latency, boosting the framerates by 2.3-4.0×\\times for a more satisfactory real-time performance.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: management strategies, and OCTENT core only covers 20% area overhead with 17% on-chip SRAM.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
