CAMs compute a weighted sum of feature maps to generate explanations, which are often more computationally efficient.\nCAM  is the pioneering method in this type, which requires a global average pooling layer in the CNN architecture.\nGradCAM  and a series of its variations, such as Grad-CAM++  and SmoothGrad , address this structural restriction by using gradients as weights, hence applicable to a broader variety of CNN families.\nHowever, gradients knowingly suffer from vanishing issues and introduce noise to the saliency map .\nTo fix the gradient issues, Score-CAM 7 and Group-CAM 6 weight feature maps by their corresponding input features’ contribution to the output, which matches the S perspective of causal semantics and is implicitly consistent with the ideas of perturbation-based methods. Causal Importance Evaluations.\n\nBased on the HP causality   introduced by Halpern and Pearl, recent research for causal importance quantification involves two main genres, causal effect and responsibility.\nThe average causal effect  measures the expected outcome difference when the values of selected causes are changed, which regards the set of causes as a whole.\nAn individual cause can thus affect the outcome very differently, i.e., receive completely different effect quantification, when being analyzed with different sets of interacting causes 4.\nThe second genre, the degree of responsibility , quantifies the minimal set of causes whose removal leads to a satisfactory outcome change, which overlooks the actual value of the outcome  .\nBesides, current causal effect and responsibility both focus on the N perspective, i.e., the change of causes, and the other S perspective needs to be fulfilled for a thorough explanation  2  9.\nMore recent works such as 9 and  address this deficiency by measuring the causal importance from both N and S.\nHowever, their proposed quantification focuses on the probability of the outcome change when causes are changed (N) or unchanged (S), which also misses the actual outcome value. Causal Explanations for CNNs.\nGiven recent works on CNN causal explanations, two main groups exist according to the type of the hypothesized causes – the model’s input features or inner filters.\nAs for the first group,  and  estimate the average causal effect of input features.\nThe Shapley value-inspired methods 4   5  also implicitly analyze the causality of input features from the S perspective. However, these methods are too computationally intensive or only provide a hazy outline of salient regions.\nTwo CAM-based methods, Score-CAM 7 and Group-CAM 6, as discussed before, can be regarded as partially causal-grounded by analyzing the sufficiency of input features.\nOn the other side, the perturbation-based methods    [ref]28 analyze input features’ necessity. The second group of methods interprets CNN through the model filter intervention.\nFor example,  explores CNN’s inner workings by ranking filters from a layer according to their counterfactual (CF) influence.\nHowever, without any visualizations, this causal explanation of CNN is less intuitive than saliency maps.\nCexCNN  provides visualizations with the help of CAMs and uses responsibility to quantify the CNN’s filter importance, which means only the N aspect has been analyzed.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: visual explanation is a key tool for CNN interpretation by highlighting important regions corresponding to a model’s particular prediction.\nTwo widely-adopted types are perturbation-based methods   [ref]28 and CAMs     7 6.\nPerturbation-based methods such as RISE [ref]28 are inspired by a human-understandable concept of measuring the output when the inputs are perturbed, which is in line with\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
