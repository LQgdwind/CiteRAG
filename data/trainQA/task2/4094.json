      "content": "Paper Title: What Should AI See? Using the Public’s Opinion to Determine the Perception of an AI\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe subject of our survey was particularly complex and challenging. Even though automated driving is an issue of high current relevance, it still appears as a black box for most people and is surrounded by uncertainty. This uncertainty is associated with every innovation and results from a lack of knowledge about the functionality and use of the new technology, see e.g. . For AI technology, this is especially true because its underlying highly complex algorithms make it impossible to entirely see through and comprehend the AI’s decision making processes, even for experts, see e.g. . Due to the limited capacity of human working memory , at any point in time, only a certain amount of information can be processed simultaneously, so that some information decays. The intransparency of how an AI operates, however, counteracts the development of trust in the technology. Particularly in the field of automated driving, trust in AI’s decision making is vital for acceptance and adoption of this technology in society, see e.g. [ref]35.\nAccordingly, there is an urgent need for increasing transparency of the underlying models in automated vehicles and, consequently, moving towards an explainable AI . Yet, increased transparency ought not to come at the expense of AI’s decision accuracy. To ensure a high level of decision accuracy, AI technology inevitably requires the processing of large amounts of data far beyond the scope of human comprehension. Thus, there is a fundamental tension between the functioning of the AI being based on a vast amount of data and sophisticated algorithmic models on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the constraints of human cognition, which is usually not able to decode such complex data and models. This causes a dilemma when asking people to partly empathize with an AI, as it was the case in our survey. When designing our survey, we had to find a balance between addressing participants in a way they could still comprehend and, at the same time, not obscuring, but sufficiently capturing the complexity inherent in the topic to obtain meaningful input to feed back into the AI. Thus, despite our best efforts, the survey inevitably involved a certain degree of complexity that might have caused a high cognitive intrinsic load . Specifically, participants in our study had to make responsible decisions when assessing the level of fatality of confusion between objects in the given traffic scenarios. For every scenario, they had to consider a vast number of aspects and possible consequences for each of the five confusion cases. Hence, participants in our study may not have been able to recognize and process all relevant information sufficiently at a given point in time. Some participants reported this high level of complexity along with substantial uncertainty and problematized it as part of their feedback. gray “There are many aspects that must be taken into account. It would be particularly fatal if a person is not recognized as a person and therefore the car does not swerve or brake. With different static or dynamic objects a confusion is less serious in my opinion, because the car should be programmed to swerve in any case. Nevertheless, the issue is very difficult, because it is not possible to consider every aspect and the topic itself is very complex. It is also likely that in retrospect you will notice criteria that you spontaneously did not consider when answering the questions.” gray “I struggled to empathize with an AI. What information does it gain from dynamic objects? […]” gray “too many details go into a decision […]” Besides the challenging task and content, the special design and technical features of our survey may have caused an increased extraneous cognitive load that is mental load produced by the layout and design of the material . For example, some participants reported that they had issues determining the weighting of fatality using the sliders and unfamiliar units of value (1-1000000 times more fatal than the confusion car with bus). We chose this scale as it is coherent with the specific design of the used AI model and explicitly intended not concealing the actually used confusion costs, like it is the case in the standard Bayes decision rule, cf. Eq. 5. gray “For me, it was difficult to determine exactly which slider how to move so that it matched in relation to the other classes. […]” gray “School grades or grading from 1-10 would be easier. As a non-specialist it is very complicated to understand the evaluation criteria…” gray “The reference values are difficult to assess and the wording of questions is rather complicated” To sum up, especially due to the complex characteristics of the topic and task, as well as some design features of our survey, some participants presumably experienced increased intrinsic and extrinsic cognitive load while completing our survey. Consequently, if extraneous and intrinsic cognitive loads were too high, this may have exceeded the limited working memory capacity, so that sufficient cognitive resources that would have been necessary to master the task may not have been available . In other words, some participants may have been more concerned with understanding the complex scenario and task as well as with becoming familiar with the interface and features of the survey, than with collecting, combining and, weighting relevant information to finally make a sound decision of how fatal they judge the confusion between classes. As a consequence, to save cognitive resources, participants who experienced such cognitive overload may have used less elaborate judgment heuristics, which could risk resulting in poor decision making . The extent to which the potentially challenging aforementioned features of the survey may have affected participants’ responses might be mediated by personal characteristics.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: the development of trust in the technology.
