      "content": "Paper Title: Untangling Dense Non-Planar Knots by Learning Manipulation Features and Recovery Policies\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSeveral perception-focused techniques have proven effective in multi-step robotic manipulation of cables and other deformable objects such as cloth and bags. One approach performs state estimation and leverages the learned state representation for downstream planning. For instance, Lui and Saxena [ref]19 and Chi and Berenson  propose using classical visual feature extraction to estimate the state of deformable rope and cloth, respectively, subject to partial occlusion. Sundaresan et al.  investigate object representation learning via dense object descriptors   for rope knot-tying and arrangement, and Ganapathi et al.  extend this methodology to 2D fabric smoothing and folding. Alternative perception-driven approaches explore learning latent state spaces 4 for cloth manipulation, or using semantic keypoint perception  3 for rope tracking. However, robust state estimation remains challenging for heavily self-occluded configurations, as are encountered in densely knotted cables. This work builds upon prior work on keypoint prediction for cable untangling, but unlike previous work, we couple perception with robust learned control policies for grasping and failure recovery. Other methods learn visuomotor policies end-to-end. Imitation learning , video prediction models [ref]10, model-free reinforcement learning (RL) , and model-based RL  have successfully been applied to goal-conditioned fabric manipulation. In other end-to-end approaches, Nair et al.  learn a dynamics model for performing template shape matching and knot-tying with rope. Zhang et al. 5 learn to directly regress robotic configurations in joint space for robotic vaulting of cables over obstacles. While these approaches are broadly general and can flexibly apply to many tasks, they can lack precision and do not leverage geometric structure in the problem, making them difficult to apply to dexterous manipulation tasks such as cable untangling, in which geometric reasoning and fine-grained manipulation are critical. Several recent works have also explored learning robot policies for deformable manipulation entirely in simulation and transferring them to the real world via domain randomization [ref]26  4  [ref]10 [ref]26 5. By contrast, we train perception systems using a combination of data from simulation and the physical world. Crucially, we observe that physical data is critical for tasks that require global reasoning, as it is difficult to simulate the full distribution of configurations encountered during an untangling sequence. However, for tasks that only require local reasoning within specific knots, simulated data can provide sufficient information for robust perception.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: and other deformable objects such as cloth and bags.
