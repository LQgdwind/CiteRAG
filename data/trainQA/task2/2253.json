      "content": "Paper Title: SITTA: Single Image Texture Translation for Data Augmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe refer to the experimental setup of TuiGAN [ref]24 that randomly selects 8 unpaired images, and generate 8 translated images for 4 unpaired image to image translation tasks including Horse↔↔\\leftrightarrowZebra, Apple↔↔\\leftrightarrow Orange,\nMilk ↔↔\\leftrightarrow BubbleMilk, and VanillaCake↔↔\\leftrightarrowChocolateCake. We train and test with a single source image and target texture image. We compare our results with various popular or most recent image synthesis methods with their official code and setting: ArtStyle , CycleGAN , SinGAN  222We first train a SinGAN model and then apply it to Paint to Image., FUNIT [ref]25 and TuiGAN [ref]24. For evaluation, we use three of most popular metrics: Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) [ref]15, Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS)  and VGG Loss (perceptual loss) . FID aims to capture the similarity of generated images to real ones, LPIPS is used to estimate how likely the outputs are to belong to the target domain, VGG Loss (with VGG19) is used to estimate how much the outputs preserve the structural information in the inputs. We randomly select 32 images and run the experiments for 3 times with a single source and target image, we report the average score in Table 1. We could notice that SITTA could achieve comparatively better scores. In Fig 5, we show some of the corresponding qualitative comparison results of VanillaCake ↔↔\\leftrightarrow ChocolateCake and Milk ↔↔\\leftrightarrow BubbleMilk. We could observe that SITTA enables clear and reasonable output.\nHowever, ArtStyle fails to learn the bubble or cake patterns, CycleGAN works better while losing detailed structural or textural information, FUNIT generates unnatural images, SinGAN doesn’t change the textures appropriately and TuiGAN fails to generate reasonable samples based on multiple scales, leading to unreasonable or distorted outputs. Instead, SITTA doesn’t depend on multi-scale training, which is more robust for random inputs of different resolutions. We also display other qualitative comparison in Appendix Section D.1. Ablation Study.\nGiven that SITTA aims to learn a texture mapping between source image and target image but preserve general content, we utilize Positional Norm to extract structural information and re-inject them into intermediate layers of decoder. To evaluate the impact of this operation, we compare our results with or without Positional Norm re-injection. In Fig. 6, we show comparisons of similar structural modes and different structural modes that two inputs share similar or different structures. It could be noticed that Positional Norm re-injection effectively regularizes the model to preserve its original content and avoid obvious unclear regions, color distortion and weird spots for an reasonable output. Running Time.\nSITTA is a lightweight yet efficient network. Here we show the comparison of average training and testing time per iteration in an epoch using the same single Geforce GTX 1080 Ti GPU without acceleration in Table 2. For testing, we report the time of forward operation. For training, we report the time of forward, backward and optimizer, scheduler update operations. We report the number of training iterations (iters) needed for each method.333Note: We utilize the official code or the widely used github code. For CycleGAN, we train it for the same number of epochs of SITTA to make fair comparisons. For FUNIT, we test the one-shot translation using the offical pre-trained model that has been trained for 100,000 iterations, so the ‘training time’ is ‘-’, ‘training iters’ is ‘pre-train’. We report the training time of SinGAN and TuiGAN at Scale=0, which costs less time than other scales. For output type, we report whether the model generates a pair of outputs (‘pair’) or a single output (‘single’). The implementation of various methods are based on Pytorch . We set image size as 288×288288288288\\times 288 in all code for fair comparison. We could notice that SITTA achieves fastest testing with an obvious edge. Though ArtStyle could be trained very fast, it cannot achieve texture translation very well. While SITTA shows its superior advantage considering training iterations, training time (seconds/iter) as well as model performance.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: We refer to the experimental setup of TuiGAN [ref]24 that randomly selects 8 unpaired images, and generate 8 translated images for 4 unpaired image to image translation tasks including Horse↔↔\\leftrightarrowZebra, Apple↔↔\\leftrightarrow\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
