We first consider the popular particle-based belief representation and then propose a region-based belief representation to overcome the problem of requiring many particles to converge in the particle-based representation . Particle-based beliefs.\nParticle-based representations have been widely used in applications from computer vision [ref]35, robotics [ref]36 [ref]8 to machine learning . They can approximate arbitrary beliefs (given sufficient particles), handle nonlinear and non-Gaussian systems, and allow efficient computations. A belief (sA,bE)∈SBsubscript𝑠𝐴subscript𝑏𝐸subscript𝑆𝐵(s_{A},b_{E})\\in S_{B} is represented by a weighted particle set {(sEi,wi)}i=1Nbsuperscriptsubscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝑠𝐸𝑖subscript𝑤𝑖𝑖1subscript𝑁𝑏\\{(s_{E}^{i},w_{i})\\}_{i=1}^{N_{b}} with normalized weights if where wi>0subscript𝑤𝑖0w_{i}>0, sEi∈SEsuperscriptsubscript𝑠𝐸𝑖subscript𝑆𝐸s_{E}^{i}\\in S_{E} for all 1≤i≤Nb1𝑖subscript𝑁𝑏1\\leq i\\leq N_{b} and D​(sE−sEi)𝐷subscript𝑠𝐸superscriptsubscript𝑠𝐸𝑖D(s_{E}-s_{E}^{i}) is a Dirac delta function centered at 00. Let B​(sE)𝐵subscript𝑠𝐸B(s_{E}) be a small neighborhood of sEsubscript𝑠𝐸s_{E}, and P​(sE;bE)=∫sE′∈B​(sE)bE​(sE′)​d​sE′𝑃subscript𝑠𝐸subscript𝑏𝐸subscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝑠𝐸′𝐵subscript𝑠𝐸subscript𝑏𝐸superscriptsubscript𝑠𝐸′dsuperscriptsubscript𝑠𝐸′P(s_{E};b_{E})=\\int_{s_{E}^{\\prime}\\in B(s_{E})}b_{E}(s_{E}^{\\prime})\\textup{d}s_{E}^{\\prime} be the probability of particle sEsubscript𝑠𝐸s_{E} under bEsubscript𝑏𝐸b_{E}. Given an initial particle-based belief (sA𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡,bE𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡)superscriptsubscript𝑠𝐴𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑏𝐸𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡(s_{A}^{\\mathit{init}},b_{E}^{\\mathit{init}}), the number of states reachable in any finite number of steps is finite, and therefore standard methods for finite-state POMDPs can be used to solve the resulting finite-state game tree, similarly to  under fully-observable strategies. However, the size of the game tree can increase exponentially as the number of steps increases, particularly given that the reachable states are likely to be distinct due to the continuous-state space. To implement NS-HSVI given in Algorithm 3 using particle-based beliefs, we must demonstrate that V𝐿𝐵Γsuperscriptsubscript𝑉𝐿𝐵ΓV_{\\mathit{LB}}^{\\Gamma} and V𝑈𝐵Υsuperscriptsubscript𝑉𝑈𝐵ΥV_{\\mathit{UB}}^{\\Upsilon} are eligible representations [ref]8 for particle-based beliefs, that is, there are closed forms for the quantities of interest. For a particle-based belief (sA,bE)subscript𝑠𝐴subscript𝑏𝐸(s_{A},b_{E}) with weighted particle set {(sEi,wi)}i=1Nbsuperscriptsubscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝑠𝐸𝑖subscript𝑤𝑖𝑖1subscript𝑁𝑏\\{(s_{E}^{i},w_{i})\\}_{i=1}^{N_{b}}, it follows from (4) that for belief bEsA,a,sA′superscriptsubscript𝑏𝐸subscript𝑠𝐴𝑎superscriptsubscript𝑠𝐴′b_{E}^{s_{A},a,s_{A}^{\\prime}} we have, for any sE′∈SEsuperscriptsubscript𝑠𝐸′subscript𝑆𝐸s_{E}^{\\prime}\\in S_{E}, bEsA,a,sA′​(sE′)superscriptsubscript𝑏𝐸subscript𝑠𝐴𝑎superscriptsubscript𝑠𝐴′superscriptsubscript𝑠𝐸′b_{E}^{s_{A},a,s_{A}^{\\prime}}(s_{E}^{\\prime}) equals: Similarly, we can compute ⟨α,(sA,bE)⟩𝛼subscript𝑠𝐴subscript𝑏𝐸\\langle\\alpha,(s_{A},b_{E})\\rangle, ⟨Ra,(sA,bE)⟩subscript𝑅𝑎subscript𝑠𝐴subscript𝑏𝐸\\langle R_{a},(s_{A},b_{E})\\rangle and P​(sA′∣(sA,bE),a)𝑃conditionalsuperscriptsubscript𝑠𝐴′subscript𝑠𝐴subscript𝑏𝐸𝑎P(s_{A}^{\\prime}\\mid(s_{A},b_{E}),a) as simple summations. It remains to compute V𝑈𝐵Υsuperscriptsubscript𝑉𝑈𝐵ΥV_{\\mathit{UB}}^{\\Upsilon} in (9), which we achieve by designing a function K𝑈𝐵subscript𝐾𝑈𝐵K_{\\mathit{UB}} that measures belief differences that satisfy (10). However, (10) is hard to check as, for beliefs bEsubscript𝑏𝐸b_{E} and bE′superscriptsubscript𝑏𝐸′b_{E}^{\\prime}, calculating K​(bE,bE′)𝐾subscript𝑏𝐸superscriptsubscript𝑏𝐸′K(b_{E},b_{E}^{\\prime}) involves the integral over the region SEbE>bE′superscriptsubscript𝑆𝐸subscript𝑏𝐸superscriptsubscript𝑏𝐸′\\smash{S_{E}^{b_{E}>b_{E}^{\\prime}}}. For particle-based beliefs, we propose the function K𝑈𝐵subscript𝐾𝑈𝐵K_{\\mathit{UB}} where: where Nbsubscript𝑁𝑏N_{b} is the number of particles in bEsubscript𝑏𝐸b_{E}, which is shown to satisfy (10) and given Υ={((sAi,bEi),yi)∣i∈I}Υconditional-setsuperscriptsubscript𝑠𝐴𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑏𝐸𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖𝑖𝐼\\Upsilon=\\{((s_{A}^{i},b_{E}^{i}),y_{i})\\mid i\\in I\\}, the upper bound can be computed by solving a linear program (LP) as demonstrated by the following lemma. The function K𝑈𝐵subscript𝐾𝑈𝐵K_{\\mathit{UB}} from (17) satisfies (10), and for particle-based belief (sA,bE)subscript𝑠𝐴subscript𝑏𝐸(s_{A},b_{E}) represented by {(sEi,wi)}i=1Nbsuperscriptsubscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝑠𝐸𝑖subscript𝑤𝑖𝑖1subscript𝑁𝑏\\{(s_{E}^{i},w_{i})\\}_{i=1}^{N_{b}}, we have that V𝑈𝐵Υ​(sA,bE)superscriptsubscript𝑉𝑈𝐵Υsubscript𝑠𝐴subscript𝑏𝐸V_{\\mathit{UB}}^{\\Upsilon}(s_{A},b_{E}) is the optimal value of the LP: Since all quantities of interest in Algorithm 3 are computed exactly, the convergence guarantee in Theorem 3 holds for any initial particle-based belief. Region-based beliefs. Particle filter approaches [ref]35 are required to approximate the updated belief of particle-based representations if the current belief has zero weight at the true state due to partial observations and random perturbations. However, for NS-POMDPs the usual sampling importance re-sampling (SIR) approach  requires many particles, which can be computationally expensive. Therefore, we propose a new belief representation using regions of the continuous state space and show that it performs well empirically in handling the uncertainties. For any connected subset (region) ϕE⊆SEsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝐸subscript𝑆𝐸\\phi_{E}\\subseteq S_{E}, let vol​(ϕE)=∫sE∈ϕEd​sEvolsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝐸subscriptsubscript𝑠𝐸subscriptitalic-ϕ𝐸dsubscript𝑠𝐸\\textup{vol}(\\phi_{E})=\\int_{s_{E}\\in\\phi_{E}}\\textup{d}s_{E}. A belief (sA,bE)∈SBsubscript𝑠𝐴subscript𝑏𝐸subscript𝑆𝐵(s_{A},b_{E})\\in S_{B} is represented by a weighted region set {(ϕEi,wi)}i=1Nbsuperscriptsubscriptsuperscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝐸𝑖subscript𝑤𝑖𝑖1subscript𝑁𝑏\\{(\\phi_{E}^{i},w_{i})\\}_{i=1}^{N_{b}} if\nbE​(sE)=∑i=1Nb​χϕEi​(sE)​wisubscript𝑏𝐸subscript𝑠𝐸superscriptsubscript𝑖1subscript𝑁𝑏subscript𝜒superscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝐸𝑖subscript𝑠𝐸subscript𝑤𝑖b_{E}(s_{E})=\\mbox{$\\sum\\nolimits_{i=1}^{N_{b}}$}\\chi_{\\phi_{E}^{i}}(s_{E})w_{i}\nwhere wi>0subscript𝑤𝑖0w_{i}>0, ϕEisuperscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝐸𝑖\\phi_{E}^{i} is a region of SEsAsuperscriptsubscript𝑆𝐸subscript𝑠𝐴S_{E}^{s_{A}} and χϕEi:SE→ℝ:subscript𝜒superscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝐸𝑖→subscript𝑆𝐸ℝ\\chi_{\\phi_{E}^{i}}:S_{E}\\to\\mathbb{R} is such that χϕEi​(sE)=1subscript𝜒superscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝐸𝑖subscript𝑠𝐸1\\chi_{\\phi_{E}^{i}}(s_{E})=1 if sE∈ϕEisubscript𝑠𝐸superscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝐸𝑖s_{E}\\in\\phi_{E}^{i} and 00 otherwise for 1≤i≤Nb1𝑖subscript𝑁𝑏1\\leq i\\leq N_{b}, and ∑i=1Nbwi​vol​(ϕEi)=1superscriptsubscript𝑖1subscript𝑁𝑏subscript𝑤𝑖volsuperscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝐸𝑖1\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{b}}w_{i}\\textup{vol}(\\phi_{E}^{i})=1. In the case of region-based beliefs, finite-state POMDPs are not applicable even when approximating by finding all reachable states up to some finite depth, as from an initial (region-based) belief this would yield infinitely many reachable states.\nRegion-based beliefs assume a uniform distribution over each region and allow the regions to overlap. Ensuring that belief updates of region-based beliefs result in region-based beliefs is difficult , as even simple transitions of variables with simple distributions can lead to complex distributions. Assumption 1 only ensures a finite partitioning of the state space for the transitions, but not that the updated belief places a uniform distribution over each region. We now provide conditions on the deterministic continuous components δEisuperscriptsubscript𝛿𝐸𝑖\\delta_{E}^{i}, see Assumption 1, of the environment transition function, under which region-based beliefs are closed. If δEi​(⋅,a):SE→δEi​(SE,a):superscriptsubscript𝛿𝐸𝑖⋅𝑎→subscript𝑆𝐸superscriptsubscript𝛿𝐸𝑖subscript𝑆𝐸𝑎\\delta_{E}^{i}(\\cdot,a):S_{E}\\rightarrow\\delta_{E}^{i}(S_{E},a) is piecewise differentiable and invertible and the Jacobian determinant of the inverse function is PWC for any a∈𝐴𝑐𝑡𝑎𝐴𝑐𝑡a\\in\\mathit{Act} and 1≤i≤Ne1𝑖subscript𝑁𝑒1\\leq i\\leq N_{e}, then region-based beliefs are closed under belief updates. We next present an implementation of NS-HSVI using region-based beliefs for environment transition functions satisfying Lemma 6. For a region-based belief (sA,bE)subscript𝑠𝐴subscript𝑏𝐸(s_{A},b_{E}), Algorithm 4 computes the belief update as the image of each region, dividing the images by perception functions into regions of SEsubscript𝑆𝐸S_{E}, updating weights and selecting the regions with desired observations. The region-based belief update and expected values are summarised in Lemma 7.
