      "content": "Paper Title: On the Complexity of Recoverable Robust Optimization in the Polynomial Hierarchy\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nReal-world decision makers are faced with a large degree of uncertainty when making important decisions in economics, planning, and operations research.\nThe successful area of Robust optimization    has been developed as one possible way to deal with these uncertainties.\nHowever, sometimes the classical robust optimization approach has turned out to be too conservative. For this reason, Recoverable robust optimization was introduced by Liebchen, L√ºbbecke, M√∂hring and Stiller .\nInitially motivated by train scheduling problems, it has since then found wide-spread application in practice and in the analysis of standard optimization problems.\nFor instance, it has been successfully applied to combinatorial problems such as\ns-t-path  5 6,\nmatching ,\nscheduling ,\nspanning tree 3 4,\nknapsack    , and\nTSP  .\nRecoverable robust optimization follows a two-step robust optimization approach.\nIn contrast to classic robust optimization, where a first-stage solution cannot be changed,\nin recoverable robust optimization the decision maker is allowed to incorporate a limited recovery action after the underlying uncertainty is revealed.\nMathematically, this is described by the expression Here, S1subscriptùëÜ1S_{1} denotes the first-stage solution, S2subscriptùëÜ2S_{2} denotes the second-stage solution, Cùê∂C denotes the set of uncertain scenarios, and dist is some distance function.\nA more formal definition will be given later. In this paper, we make the standard assumption that the underlying uncertainty for the robust problem is given as a discrete budgeted uncertainty set, also denoted as discrete ŒìŒì\\Gamma-uncertainty . The study of Œ£3psubscriptsuperscriptŒ£ùëù3\\Sigma^{p}_{3}-complete problems.\nRecoverable robust problems are described by min-max-min formulations.\nFrom a complexity-theoretic point of view, such min-max-min problems are often even harder than NP-complete,\nnamely they are often complete for the third stage of the so-called polynomial hierarchy 7.\nA problem complete for the kùëòk-th stage of the hierarchy is called Œ£kpsubscriptsuperscriptŒ£ùëùùëò\\Sigma^{p}_{k}-complete. (In this paper, we are concerned mostly with the case of k=3ùëò3k=3).\nThe theoretical study of Œ£kpsubscriptsuperscriptŒ£ùëùùëò\\Sigma^{p}_{k}-complete problems is important:\nIf a problem is found to be Œ£3psubscriptsuperscriptŒ£ùëù3\\Sigma^{p}_{3}-complete, it means that, under some basic complexity-theoretic assumptions111More specifically, we assume here that Œ£3p‚â†NPsubscriptsuperscriptŒ£ùëù3NP\\Sigma^{p}_{3}\\neq\\text{NP}.\nThis is a similar assumption to the famous P‚â†NPPNP\\text{P}\\neq\\text{NP} assumption, and it is believed to be similarly unlikely.\nHowever, the true status of the conjecture is not known.\nMore details can be found in 8.,\nit is not possible to find a integer programming formulation of the problem of polynomial size 8 (also called a compact model).\nThis means that no matter how cleverly a decision maker tries to design their integer programming model,\nit must inherently have a huge number of constraints and/or variables, and may be much harder to solve than even NP-complete problems. Even though this fact makes the study of Œ£3psubscriptsuperscriptŒ£ùëù3\\Sigma^{p}_{3}-complete problems compelling, surprisingly few results relevant to the area of min-max-min combinatorial optimization were known until recently.\nWhile the usual approach to prove Œ£kpsubscriptsuperscriptŒ£ùëùùëò\\Sigma^{p}_{k}-completeness (or NP-completeness) is to formulate a new proof for each single problem,\na recent paper by Gr√ºne & Wulf 1, extending earlier ideas by Johannes 8 breaks with this approach.\nInstead, it is shown that there exists a large ‚Äôbase list‚Äô of problems (called SSP-NP-complete problems in 1), including many classic problems like independent set, vertex cover, knapsack, TSP, etc.\nGr√ºne and Wulf show that for each problem from the base list, some corresponding min-max version is Œ£2psubscriptsuperscriptŒ£ùëù2\\Sigma^{p}_{2}-complete, and some corresponding min-max-min version is Œ£3psubscriptsuperscriptŒ£ùëù3\\Sigma^{p}_{3}-complete.\nThis approach has three main advantages:\nA1.) It uncovers a large number of previously unknown Œ£kpsubscriptsuperscriptŒ£ùëùùëò\\Sigma^{p}_{k}-complete problems.\nA2.) It reveals the theoretically interesting insight, that for all these problems the Œ£kpsubscriptsuperscriptŒ£ùëùùëò\\Sigma^{p}_{k}-completeness follows from essentially the same argument.\nA3.) It can simplify future proofs, since heuristically it seems to be true that for a new problem it is often easier to show that the nominal problem belongs to the list of SSP-NP-complete problems, than to find a Œ£kpsubscriptsuperscriptŒ£ùëùùëò\\Sigma^{p}_{k}-completeness proof from scratch. The main goal of the current paper is to extend the framework of Gr√ºne & Wulf 1 also to the setting of recoverable optimization,\nsince this setting was not considered in the original paper.\nIt turns out that compared to 1 more complicated assumptions are needed. We introduce a set of sufficient conditions for some nominal problem, which imply that the recoverable robust version of that problem is Œ£3psubscriptsuperscriptŒ£ùëù3\\Sigma^{p}_{3}-complete. Our results.\nWe consider recoverable robust optimization for the following nominal problems: Sat, 3Sat, vertex cover, dominating set, set cover, hitting set, feedback vertex set, feedback arc set, uncapacitated facility location, pùëùp-center, pùëùp-median, independent set, clique, subset sum, knapsack, partition, scheduling, Hamiltonian path/cycle (directed/undirected), TSP, kùëòk-disjoint path (k‚â•2ùëò2k\\geq 2), and Steiner tree.\nIn addition we consider the three most popular distance measures dist used in recoverable robust optimization: The Œ∫ùúÖ\\kappa-addition distance, the Œ∫ùúÖ\\kappa-deletion distance, and the Hamming distance. (A formal definition of these distance measures is given in Section¬†4.1) We show that for every combination of the above problems with any of the three distance measures, the recoverable robust problem (with discrete budgeted uncertainty) is Œ£3psubscriptsuperscriptŒ£ùëù3\\Sigma^{p}_{3}-complete.\nMore generally, we identify an abstract property of all our studied problems, and prove that this abstract property already implies that the recoverable robust problem becomes Œ£3psubscriptsuperscriptŒ£ùëù3\\Sigma^{p}_{3}-complete. This answers a question asked by Goerigk, Lendl and Wulf [ref]19. As a consequence, the advantages A1‚ÄìA3 as explained above also apply to recoverable robust problems.\nWe remark that Œ£3psubscriptsuperscriptŒ£ùëù3\\Sigma^{p}_{3}-completeness was already known in the case of clique/independent set, TSP or shortest path combined with the Hamming distance [ref]19. It was also already known for shortest path in combination with all three distance measures 5 and for several optimization problems 0 for so-called xor-dependencies and ŒìŒì\\Gamma-set scenarios.\nHence our work is an extension of these results.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: that this abstract property already implies that the recoverable robust problem becomes Œ£3psubscriptsuperscriptŒ£ùëù3\\Sigma^{p}_{3}-complete.
