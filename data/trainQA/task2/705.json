      "content": "Paper Title: Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning through Adversarial Loss\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning has achieved enormous success on a variety of challenging domains, ranging from computer vision¬†, natural language processing¬† to reinforcement learning (RL)¬† . Nevertheless, the existence of adversarial examples  indicates that deep neural networks (DNNs) are not as robust and trustworthy as we would expect, as small and often imperceptible perturbations can result in misclassifications of state-of-the-art DNNs. Unfortunately, adversarial attacks have also been shown possible in deep reinforcement learning, where adversarial perturbations in the observation space and/or action space can cause arbitrarily bad performance of deep RL agents¬†  [ref]8. As deep RL agents are deployed in many safety critical applications such as self-driving cars and robotics, it is of crucial importance to develop robust training algorithms (a.k.a. defense algorithms) such that the resulting trained agents are robust against adversarial (and non-adversarial) perturbation. Many heuristic defenses have been proposed to improve robustness of DNNs against adversarial attacks for image classification tasks, but they often fail against stronger adversarial attack algorithms. For example,  showed that 13 such defense methods (recently published at prestigious conferences) can all be broken by more advanced attacks. One emerging alternative to heuristic defenses is defense algorithms\n111We don‚Äôt use the naming convention in this field to call this type of defense as certified defense because we think it is misleading as such defense methodology cannot provide any certificates on unseen data. \nbased on robustness verification or certification bounds¬†0 1 2 3. These algorithms produce robustness certificates such that for any perturbations within the specified ‚Ñìpsubscript‚Ñìùëù\\ell_{p}-norm distance œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon, the trained DNN will produce consistent classification results on given data points. Representative works along this line include¬†1 and 4, where the learned models can have much higher certified accuracies by including the robustness verification bounds in the loss function with proper training schedule, even if the verifier produces loose robustness certificates¬†4 for models without robust training (a.k.a. nominal models). Here, the certified accuracy is calculated as the percentage of the test images that are guaranteed to be classified correctly under a given perturbation magnitude œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon. However, most of the defense algorithms are developed for classification tasks. Few defense algorithms have been designed for deep RL agents perhaps due to the additional challenges in RL that are not present in classification tasks, including credit assignment and lack of a stationary training set. To bridge this gap, in this paper we present the RADIAL(Robust ADversarIAl Loss)-RL framework to train robust deep RL agents. We show that RADIAL can improve the robustness of deep RL agents by using carefully designed adversarial loss functions based on robustness verification bounds. Our contributions are listed below: We propose a novel robust deep RL framework, RADIAL-RL, which can be applied to different types of deep RL algorithms. We demonstrate RADIAL on three popular RL algorithms, DQN¬†, A3C¬†5 and PPO¬†6. We demonstrate the superior performance of RADIAL agents on both Atari games and continuous control tasks in MuJoCo: our agents are 2‚àí10√ó2-10\\times more computationally efficient to train than¬†7 and can resist up to 5√ó5\\times stronger adversarial perturbations better than existing works¬†8 7. We also evaluate the effects of robust training on the ability of agents to generalize to new levels using the ProcGen benchmark, and show that our training also increases robustness on unseen levels, reaching high rewards even against œµ=5/255italic-œµ5255\\epsilon=5/255 PGD-attacks. We propose a new evaluation method, Greedy Worst-Case Reward (GWC), for efficiently (in linear time) evaluating RL agent performance under attack of strongest adversaries (i.e. worst-case perturbation) on discrete action environments.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: have also been shown possible in deep reinforcement learning, where adversarial perturbations in the observation space and/or action space can cause arbitrarily bad performance of deep RL agents¬†  [ref]8.
