Most companies today seem to be implementing them into their product offerings. In this section, we explore the underlying technical architecture of LLMs. We also clarify several of the most notable LLMs and the differences among them. The concept of the LLMs was presented in [ref]4 that proposed the original Transformer neural network. Prior to this point, tasks where the sequence of information was critical, such as translating or summarising information, relied heavily upon Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The drawback with these models was that they were challenging to train and performed poorly when dealing with long-range text dependencies. However, the new Transformer neural network was proved to be a far superior model for conducting sequence-based tasks. There are several reasons behind the improved performance of the Transformer neural network: Firstly, the RNNs and CNNs need to be passed information sequentially, while Transformers can be passed simultaneously. Hence it is faster to train them. Secondly, the Transformers have an attention mechanism (discussed below) that lets it capture long-distance sequential relationships far better than existing models. Additionally, a notable benefit of these differences, among a few others, is that transformers scale incredibly well with large data sets. Figure 2 shows a specific architecture of Transformers that consists of two main components, i.e., the Encoder and the Decoder. To give a high-level overview of how the Encoder and Decoder work, we will take a sample task and show how the Transformer would work its way through it. Let us take an an hypothetical task where someone has asked the Transformer to summarise a piece of text: The main job of the Encoder is to convert the natural language text we are trying to summarise into a series of vectors that capture all related information and context. It does this through positional embedding, a self-attention process, and finally, a feed-forward neural network. It is important to note that the Encoder does not process information sequentially, i.e., each token of information can be processed to capture its relationships with tokens behind and in front of it. The Decoder works differently. Based on the output of the Encoder and the information it has already processed (such as the first half of the summary it completed), it sequentially generates new information. To produce each part of the new information, the Decoder uses a softmax function to find what is probably the next most correct word. The BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a modified application of the Transformer model [ref]5, which consists of only the Encoder. The main reason is that the Encoder exhibits the bi-directional capabilities of that portion of the Transformer architecture. The original Transformer produces its output sequentially due to constraints of the Decoder; BERT is able to do it in a bi-directional way, i.e., for any location in a sentence that BERT is processing, it is able to imbue context from before and after the location. Similarly, BERT can be fine-tuned efficiently and effectively. Adding an output layer allows the model to be tailored to specific content without significant work needed. A close variant to BERT is RoBERTa [ref]6, a version of BERT trained on more data and optimised hyperparameters. There are a few other differences regarding learning rates and task specialisation. Similar to BERT, RoBERTa can specialise in additional content through fine-tuning. Examples of BERT or RoBERTa model fine-tuning, which we either mention or utilise later in this paper, include MentalBERT , a BERT model fine-tuned on mental health data for detection, as well as a RoBERTa model fine-tuned on emotion data  to classify emotions. While BERT implemented only the Encoder part of the Transformer, the Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) utilises only the Decoder portion, which significantly impacts this task specialisation. GPT is excellent at tasks that predict proceeding works based on what has already passed. The models like GPT3, trained on vast amounts of information, perform competitively at ’Few Shot Learning’ . This refers to conducting a new task with just a few examples. This ability is unlikely to be seen in models like BERT. In addition, this is due to the GPT self-attention architecture, which enables efficient training that provides the ability to train the GPT models on large amounts of data with many parameters. The most recent version of the LLM is Llama 2 , which was released by Meta and developed in conjunction with Microsoft to provide an alternative to GPT. An important difference between Llama 2 and GPT is that Llama 2 is fully open-source, which can be used for commercial and research purposes. In addition, it is worth mentioning that the most significant model of Llama 2 has 70B parameters, and the smallest has 7B parameters. It is mentioned that the latest GPT, GPT4, has over 1 trillion parameters . Due to Llama 2’s licensing, it is predicted that Llama will become increasingly prevalent in the innovation ecosystem. Mistral is an AI startup which at the time of writing, has raised over $400M . It is an EU counterpart to some of the large LLM model providers. Its models, such as Mistral 7B, boost superior performance over Llama models . This is due to technical advancements they have implemented through its Sliding Window Attention and Rolling Buffer Cache. This innovation has helped them reach reduced inference costs with improved inference speed.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: In this section, we explore the underlying technical architecture of LLMs. We also clarify several of the most notable LLMs and the differences among them.
