      "content": "Paper Title: Deployment Challenges of Industrial Intrusion Detection Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe examine four IIDSs designed for industrial use cases, which were published at top security conferences.\nWhen evaluating these IIDSs, we make use of available open-source implementations or validated re-implementations within the IPAL IIDS framework .\nIn the following, we briefly lay out the detection idea of each approach, but for further details, we refer the reader to the respective publications or IPAL’s public implementation . MinMax.\nThe first IIDS, MinMax, learning the minimum and maximum bounds of a sensors’ normal values (cf. Sec. 2), serves as a representative for a class of lightweight IIDSs that aim to implement straightforward detection methodologies that do not require complex configuration, technical understanding, or computational resources [ref]30.\nAny violation against the learned minimum and maximum values is indicated as an alert to the ICS operators. Invariant.\nThe Invariant IIDS  leverages data mining techniques to find mathematical equations that must be fulfilled at all times.\nE.g., if the inlet valve of a water tank is opened, its water level is expected to rise.\nSince these invariants are fulfilled all the time during normal behavior, any violation of such a rule is then reported as an alert. TABOR.\nThis IIDS fuses three detection approaches based on timed automata, Bayesian networks, and out-of-bounds checks .\nThe timed automata component considers a single sensor value and learns a model of its behavior.\nE.g., the water levels of a tank usually rise for 30 minutes and then decrease over several hours.\nTogether with the Bayesian network, unknown process states can be determined, such as the inlet valve being still opened despite the water level rising for more than 30 minutes.\nTo complement their method, an alert is also raised with an out-of-bounds check working similarly to the MinMax IIDS. Seq2SeqNN.\nLastly, Seq2SeqNN [ref]18 trains a neuronal network on GPUs to understand the ICS’s behavior and perform predictions for the future.\nGiven a recent history of physical values, the neuronal network is able to perform a prediction for the near future.\nIf these predictions deviate too much from the observed behavior, an alarm is raised. These four IIDSs, which also feature vastly different numbers of hyperparameters for their configuration (cf. Tab. 1), build the foundation for our analysis.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: for a class of lightweight IIDSs that aim to implement straightforward detection methodologies that do not require complex configuration, technical understanding, or computational resources [ref]30.\nAny violation against the learned minimum and maximum values is indicated as an alert to the ICS operators.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
