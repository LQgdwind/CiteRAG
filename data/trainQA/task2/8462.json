Specifically, the authors of  maximized EE in an SF-RIS-aided NOMA network and proved that the SF-RIS can greatly improve the EE performance. Then, the authors of [ref]19 proposed an SF-RIS-enhanced simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system built on an electromagnetic-compliant framework, where the EE was maximized under the impedance parameters of SF-RIS elements constraint. Additionally, in , the EE maximization problem in a wireless network with distributed SF-RISs was investigated by optimizing RIS on-off status, which revealed that the multi-RIS scheme obtained a higher EE performance than the single-RIS scheme.\nFurthermore, since the STAR-RIS supports full-space coverage to serve users, the authors of [ref]21 investigated the energy-efficient resource allocation scheme to maximize EE in a STAR-RIS-aided MIMO-NOMA network, which revealed that NOMA can achieve superior EE performance than orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme. Besides, in , the system EE was maximized by exploiting a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based algorithm in STAR-RIS-aided NOMA networks.\nIn addition, to alleviate the double-fading attenuation issue, the active RIS has been extensively studied recently. For instance,\nthe EE comparison between active RISs and passive RISs was provided in , which revealed that whether active RISs or passive RISs is more energy efficient depends on the energy consumption of each active RIS element.\nTo proceed, the authors of  maximized EE in an active RIS-aided multiuser system, and illustrated that the active RIS outperforms half/full duplex relays under the same power budgets. Additionally, in , the global EE (GEE) was optimized in active RIS-aided systems with global reflection constraints, which revealed that active RISs provide a higher GEE than nearly-passive RISs only if the additional power consumption is not larger than the hardware power consumption of nearly-passive RISs. These studies demonstrated that the RIS has great potential in improving system EE performance.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: Due to the nearly-passive feature, various research activities have been devoted in RIS-empowered networks for EE improvement  [ref]19  [ref]21    .
