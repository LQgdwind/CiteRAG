      "content": "Paper Title: Contrastive Learning and Self-Training for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe goal in semantic image segmentation is to assign the correct class label to each pixel. This makes it suitable for complex image-based scene analysis that is required in applications like automated driving. However, in order to generate a labeled training dataset, pixel-level annotation must first be performed by humans. Since detailed manual labeling can take 90 minutes per image , it is associated with high costs. A potential workaround would be to generate the images and corresponding segmentation maps synthetically using computer game environments like Grand Theft Auto V (GTA5) . However, even current segmentation models    do not generalize well to data from a different domain. In fact, their segmentation performance decreases drastically when there is a discrepancy between the training and test distribution as in a synthetic-to-real scenario. The research field of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) studies how to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. The aim is to achieve the best possible results in the target domain, whereas the performance in the source domain is not considered. Current methods for UDA address the problem by minimizing the distribution discrepancy between the domains while doing a supervised training on source data. The distribution alignment can take place in the pixel space 5 3  [ref]44, feature space 6 7  [ref]45, output space  [ref]40   4, or even in several spaces in parallel. While adversarial training (AT) 0 is commonly used to minimize the distribution discrepancy between domains, it can fail to align the correct semantic categories. This is because adversarial training minimizes the mismatch between global distributions rather than class-specific ones, which can negatively affect the results . This is also true for discrepancy measures such as the maximum mean discrepancy , which can be minimized without aligning the correct class distributions across domains 9. To address the problem of misaligned classes across domains, we rely on contrastive learning (CL) 2. The basic idea of CL is to encourage positive data pairs to be similar and negative data pairs to be apart. To perform domain adaptation and match the features of the correct semantic categories, positive pairs consist of features from the same class but different domains while negative pairs are from different classes and possibly from different domains 9 7. Due to the lack of labels in the target domain, the class of each target feature must be determined based on the predictions of the model. However, since different class prior probabilities can bias the final segmentation layer towards the source domain, we extend our approach with self-training (ST), i.e. using target predictions as pseudo-labels. We start from the observation that target pixels are predicted with high uncertainty [ref]40. Moreover, these uncertain predictions may also vary between different classes during training and are therefore usually not considered for self-training. By using a memory-efficient temporal ensemble that combines the predictions of a single network over time 1, we obtain the predictive tendency of the model. This allows us to create robust pseudo-labels even for the uncertain predictions that have high information content. The temporal ensemble has the additional advantage that pseudo-labels are updated directly during training, which reduces the computational complexity compared to a separate stage-wise recalculation [ref]45 6 2  [ref]44. We summarize our contributions as follows: First, we extend contrastive learning and self-training using a memory-efficient temporal ensemble to UDA for semantic segmentation. Second, we empirically show that both approaches are able to transfer knowledge between domains. Furthermore, we show that combining our contrastive learning and self-training (CLST) approach leads to a symbiotic setup that yields competitive and superior state-of-the-art results for GTA5 →→\\rightarrow Cityscapes and SYNTHIA →→\\rightarrow Cityscapes, respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: address the problem by minimizing the distribution discrepancy between the domains while doing a supervised training on source data.
