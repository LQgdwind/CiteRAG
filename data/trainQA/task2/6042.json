      "content": "Paper Title: Disagreement amongst counterfactual explanations: How transparency can be deceptive\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHowever, these ethical issues can only arise if there actually is ambiguity. The first one to measure the disagreement problem in XAI is . They compare LIME, Integrated Gradients, DeepLIFT, Grad-SHAP, Deep-SHAP, and attention-based explanations with a rank correlation (Kendall‚Äôs œÑùúè\\tau) metric. They conclude there is only low agreement in the explanations of these methods. [ref]20 expand the previous study by comparing LIME, KernelSHAP, Vanilla Gradient, Gradient Input, Integrated Gradients, and SmoothGrad, once again finding disagreement amongst explanation of different methods, especially when the model complexity increases. Instead of only using a rank correlation metric, they use a feature agreement, (signed) rank agreement, sign agreement, and rank correlation. Depending on the type of data (tabular, text or image data), they use different of the above-mentioned evaluation metrics. Next to a quantitative comparison, the authors also perform a qualitative study on how practitioners handle the disagreement problem. 84% of practitioners interviewed by [ref]20 mentioned encountering the disagreement problem on a day-to-day basis. They report there is no principle evaluation method to decide on which explanations to use, therefore, they simply choose to generate explanations with the XAI method they are most familiar with.\n extend the study of [ref]20 to investigate why the disagreement problem exists for these methods. They conclude that different XAI methods approximate a black-box model over different neighborhoods by applying other loss functions. If two explanations are trained to predict different sets of perturbations, then the explanations are each accurate in their own domain and may disagree.\nA more focused disagreement problem study can be found in [ref]38 where the explanations of LIME and SHAP are investigated for one single defect prediction model. They calculate the feature, rank, and sign agreement also proposed by [ref]20. They conclude that LIME and SHAP disagree more on the ranking of important features compared to the sign of their importance. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\nNb. of\nType of\nNb. of\nNb. of XAI\nXAI\n\n\n\n\ndatasets\ndatasets\nmodels\nmethods\n\n\n\n5\nText\n2\n6\nLIME, Integrated Gradients, DeepLIFT,\n\n\nGrad-SHAP, Deep-SHAP, and attention-based explanations\n\n[ref]20\n4\nTabular, Text and Image\n8\n6\nLIME, Kernel SHAP and Integrated Gradients\n\n[ref]38\n4\nTabular\n1\n2\nLIME, SHAP\n\nThis work\n40\nTabular\n2\n12\nSHAP, Counterfactuals and Anchor\n\n\n\n Table¬†1 gives an overview of the scarce literature on the quantitative evaluation of disagreement between XAI methods relative to our work. To the best of our knowledge, the disagreement problem has not yet been quantified for counterfactual XAI methods. This is remarkable because recently there has been a boom in the number of such algorithms. [ref]13 identify 60 unique counterfactual algorithms in their recent survey. In this manuscript, we study the disagreement problem between counterfactual explanations for tabular data. We investigate disagreement between 10 selected counterfactual algorithms but also the disagreement with different post-hoc explanation methods such as SHAP  and Anchors . Moreover, we extend the size of our study to 40 datasets (instead of 4-5) in order to confidently make more general conclusions. It should be noted that morally the disagreement problem for counterfactual explanations is similar to the Rashomon effect, introduced by . This effect concerns the diversity in multiple counterfactual explanations generated by the same counterfactual algorithm for the same instance and classifier. One explanation might say to change feature A (e.g., wait 5 years in order to get a loan), while another might say to change feature B while not adapting A (e.g., make sure your income increases with $500 in order to get a loan immediately). This initially seems like a contradiction as well. For example, the DiCE algorithm is focused on generating multiple explanations . In contrast to the Rashomon effect, the disagreement problem investigates diversity amongst different counterfactual explanation algorithms for the same instance and classifier. However, at the heart of the matter, the Rashomon effect and the disagreement problem face the same ethical issues and moral hazards: who chooses which explanation will be used?\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: DeepLIFT, Grad-SHAP, Deep-SHAP, and attention-based explanations with a rank correlation (Kendall‚Äôs œÑùúè\\tau) metric.
