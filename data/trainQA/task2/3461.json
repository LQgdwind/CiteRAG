      "content": "Paper Title: Do Lessons from Metric Learning Generalize to Image-Caption Retrieval?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn representation learning it was found that NT-Xent loss outperforms the Triplet loss and Triplet loss SH [ref]7. For both the image retrieval and representation learning task, results show that SmoothAP outperforms both the Triplet loss SH and the NT-Xent loss  .\nWe examine whether these findings generalize to ICR. Experimental setup.\nWe focus on two benchmark datasets for the ICR task: the Flickr30k¬† and MS-COCO¬† datasets.\nSimilar to 2 [ref]24, we use the split provided by Karpathy and Fei-Fei 7 for MS-COCO and the Flickr30k.\nFor details of the specific implementations of VSE++ 2222https://github.com/fartashf/vsepp and https://github.com/KunpengLi1994/VSRN we refer to the papers and online implementations.\nEach method is trained for 30 epochs with a batch size of 128. We start with a learning rate of 0.0002 and after 15 epochs we lower the learning rate to 0.00002. For VSE++, we do not apply additional fine-tuning of the image encoder after 30 epochs.\nOur main goal is to have a fair comparison across methods, datasets, and loss functions, not to have the highest overall evaluation scores.\nFor VSE++, we use ResNet50 5 as image-encoder instead of ResNet152 5 or VGG .\nResNet50 is faster to optimize and the performance differences between ResNet50 and ResNet152 are relatively small. The VSRN method comes with an additional caption decoder, to decode the original input caption from the latent image representation, this to add additional supervision to the optimization process. We remove the additional image-captioning module, so as to exclude performance gains on the retrieval tasks due to this extra supervision.\nIn [ref]24, the similarity score for a query candidate pair, during evaluation, is based on averaging the predicted similarity scores of (an ensemble of) two trained models.\nWe only take the predicted relevance score of one model.\nThe reason for this is that the evaluation score improvements are marginal when using the scores of two models (instead of one) but optimizing the methods takes twice as long.\nTherefore, our results are lower than the results published in [ref]24.\nFor all the remaining details, we refer to our repository.444https://github.com/MauritsBleeker/ecir-2022-reproducibility-bleeker\nWhen optimizing with SmoothAP, we take all the kùëòk captions into account when sampling a batch, instead of one positive candidate. For this reason, we have to increase the amount of training epochs kùëòk times as well to have a fair comparison.\nFor each loss function, we select the best performing hyper-parameter according to its original work. Experiments.\nWe evaluate each loss function we described in Section¬†2 given a dataset and method.\nFor ease of reference, we refer to each individual evaluation with an experiment number (#) (see Table¬†¬†1).\nTo reduce the variance in the results we run each experiment five times and report the average score and standard deviation.\nSimilar to 2 [ref]24, we evaluate using Recall@k with k={1,5,10}ùëò1510k=\\{1,5,10\\}, for both the  image-to text (i2t) and  text-to-image (t2i) task.\nWe also report the sum of all the recall scores (rsum) and the average recall value.\nFor the i2t task, we also report the mean average precision at 555 (mAP@5) due to the fact we have kùëòk positive captions per image query. Results.\nBased on the scores reported in Table 1, we have the following observations: Given a fixed method and default hyper-parameters for each loss function, the Triplet loss SH results in the best evaluation scores, regardless of dataset, method or task. Similar to 2, we find that the Triplet loss SH consistently outperforms the general Triplet loss, which takes all the negative triplets in the batch into account that violate the margin constraint. The NT-Xent loss consistently underperforms compared to the Triplet loss SH. This is in contrast with findings in [ref]7, where the NT-Xent loss results in better down-stream evaluation performance on a (augmented image-to-image) representation learning task than the Triplet loss SH.\nAlthough the ICR task has different (input) data modalities, the underlying learning object is the same for ICR and augmented image-to-image representation learning (i.e., contrasting positive and negative pairs). Only for the VSE++ method on the i2t task, SmoothAP performs similar to the Triplet-loss SH. SmoothAP does not outperform the Triplet loss SH. This is in contrast with the findings in , where SmoothAP does outperform Triplet-loss SH and other metric learning functions. The method with the best Recall@k score also has the highest mAP@k score. Upshot.\nBased on our observations concerning Table¬†1, we conclude the following:\n\n\n(1) The Triplet loss SH should still be the de facto choice for optimizing ICR methods.\n\n(2) The promising results from the representation learning field that were obtained by using the NT-Xent loss [ref]7, do not generalize to the ICR task.\n\n(3) Optimizing an ICR method with a smooth approximation of a ranking metric (SmoothAP) does not result in better Recall@k scores.\n\n(4) Optimizing an ICR method by using a pair-wise distance loss between the positive triplet and a semi-hard negative triplet still yields the best evaluation performance. For both methods VSE++ and VSRN, i2t and t2i and for both datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: In representation learning it was found that NT-Xent loss outperforms the Triplet loss and Triplet loss SH [ref]7. For both the image retrieval and representation learning task, results show that SmoothAP outperforms both the Triplet loss SH and the NT-Xent loss  .\nWe examine whether these findings\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
