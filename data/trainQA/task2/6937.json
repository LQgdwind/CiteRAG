      "content": "Paper Title: Cognition-Mode Aware Variational Representation Learning Framework for Knowledge Tracing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe Knowledge Tracing (KT) task plays a crucial role in personalized learning, and its purpose is to predict student responses based on their historical practice behavior sequence. However, the KT task suffers from data sparsity, which makes it challenging to learn robust representations for students with few practice records and increases the risk of model overfitting. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Cognition-Mode Aware Variational Representation Learning Framework (CMVF) that can be directly applied to existing KT methods. Our framework uses a probabilistic model to generate a distribution for each student, accounting for uncertainty in those with limited practice records, and estimate the student’s distribution via variational inference (VI). In addition, we also introduce a cognition-mode aware multinomial distribution as prior knowledge that constrains the posterior student distributions learning, so as to ensure that students with similar cognition modes have similar distributions, avoiding overwhelming personalization for students with few practice records. At last, extensive experimental results confirm that CMVF can effectively aid existing KT methods in learning more robust student representations. Our code is available at https://github.com/zmy-9/CMVF. In recent decades, numerous computer-assisted learning platforms have emerged to assist students in acquiring knowledge. Recommending suitable problems to students is a crucial function of online platforms, as it prevents students from wasting time practicing questions they already mastered  . As a result, the Knowledge Tracing (KT) [ref]4 [ref]16 task has received significant attention in recent years, aiming to predict the probability of students answering the target question correctly based on their historical practice sequences. As a popular data mining application field, KT has produced many excellent models that enhance model prediction accuracy through improving model structures and introducing rich features. The current state-of-the-art KT models basically adopt an Input →→\\rightarrow Embedding →→\\rightarrow Neural Network →→\\rightarrow Prediction paradigm, in which the Embedding module maps input factors to dense representation vectors, playing a critical role in this paradigm. Thus, exploring how to reasonable representation vectors of input factors, including questions and students, is an active research direction in the KT field. For example, PEBG  and MF-DAKT  construct question graphs with question difficulty and relationship information to pre-train question representations, while RKT [ref]22 and HGKT  introduce question texts to enrich question representations. However, the aforementioned methods focus primarily on question representations, with few works focusing on student representation learning, especially for Infrequent Students (students with few practice records). Infrequent students have limited practice records, causing them to have large uncertainties, which lead to low confidence in the model’s scoring and makes the existing KT models prone to overfitting. To address student representation overfitting due to data sparsity, KTM  previously proposed to introduce rich student attribute features. However, these attribute features are often shared by frequent and infrequent students. In the model training stage, due to the influence of data imbalance, that is, frequent student records are significantly more than infrequent student records, attribute features will better reflect the characteristics of frequent students, leading to the individualization of infrequent students being overwhelmed. Later, CL4KT  proposed to apply data augmentation methods, such as clipping or reordering historical practice behaviors, to improve the robustness of student representations. However, since infrequent learners have limited historical practice, clipping or reordering may lead to information diversity and result in limited information gain or even introduce noise. Furthermore, the above two methods both use point estimation to learn student representations, that is, try to learn a reliable single point for each student in the embedding space, and fail to consider the uncertainty of students, as shown in Figure 1(a). This results in the model having lower confidence in the prediction scores (i.e., overfitting). Therefore, to effectively model the uncertainty of infrequent students, we propose a general framework called Cognition-Mode Aware Variational Representation Learning Framework (CMVF) to generate robust representations for students. To improve modeling of student uncertainty, we propose to replace point estimate in KT models with distributional estimate, shown in Figure 1(b). Specifically, we introduce a probabilistic model that learns a distribution for each student to model their uncertainty, calculating the expected value of the distribution as the final prediction score, thereby reducing uncertainty more efficiently. To avoid the computational difficulty of distribution estimate, we propose to use a variational inference-based (VI) approach to build a probabilistic latent variable model , which enables us to use the reparameterization trick to generate different distributions for each student, thereby facilitating integration with existing deep KT models. Meanwhile, VI commonly sets a uniform prior distribution for all student distributions, limiting the model’s ability to personalize infrequent students. Generally speaking, students with similar characteristics should have similar prior distributions to enable the model to learn similar posterior distributions for them, facilitating sharing of global characteristic information while retaining individuality of infrequent students. Previous KT research shows each student has unique learning characteristics reflected in their practice sequences  , such as different students may acquire knowledge at different speeds in practice, we refer to this characteristic as cognition mode. As a result, students with similar cognition modes should have similar representation distributions. To extract students’ cognition modes, we propose to utilize the dynamic routing algorithm  to model their practice sequences, with different capsules representing different cognition modes. Based on extracted cognition modes, we design a cognition-mode aware multinomial distribution as a prior during Bayesian inference, constraining the model’s learning of posterior student distributions by ensuring students with similar cognition modes have similar prior distributions. Additionally, to further avoid overfitting, we also use the standard normal distribution as a kind of prior knowledge to constrain model training. At last, extensive experimental results confirm that CMVF can effectively aid existing KT methods in learning more robust student representations, especially for infrequent students. The contributions of our paper can be summarized as follows: To the best of our knowledge, we are the first KT study to learn robust student representations by building a probabilistic model that generates a distribution for each student. We novelly design a cognition-mode aware prior multinomial distribution to constrain the model to generate similar posterior distributions for students with similar cognition modes which are extracted from their historical practice sequences using a dynamic routing algorithm. CMVF is a general framework that can be incorporated into existing KT methods. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority and compatibility of the CMVF framework.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: problems to students is a crucial function of online platforms, as it prevents students from wasting time practicing questions they already mastered  .
