      "content": "Paper Title: Elephants and Algorithms: A Review of the Current and Future Role of AI in Elephant Monitoring\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMachine learning-based behavioural analysis methods have successfully expedited the automated annotation of video data in behavioural assays    and social interactions   , used to discover the structure and dynamics of expressed behaviour    and reveal previously undescribed movement phenotypes in neurodevelopmental models  . Collective behaviour analysis has also been applied to many animal species to understand how decisions are made in a group . This is an active area of research in the fields of neuroscience and behavioural biology, and we refer readers to Anderson et al. , Valletta et al. , Datta et al.  and Couzin et al.  for more pedagogical introductions, comprehensive overviews, and nuanced reviews of the field. We consider the field of automatic behavioural analysis methods for elephant monitoring in terms of supervised approaches, sometimes referred to automatic behaviour detection or action recognition, and unsupervised approaches, sometimes referred to as deep behavioural phenotyping.\nWhen the detection or study of well-defined behaviours is required, researchers can curate a labelled subset of video frames during which the behaviours of interest is exhibited, and use supervised approaches    .\nSuch studies have demonstrated human-level accuracy in detecting whole-body behaviours in mice such as floating, rearing, nose-to-nose in paired individuals, and more localised behaviours such as head dipping, grooming, and scratching  .\nApplying these methods in order to automatically detect heightened attentiveness behaviours in elephants, such as fence touching, ear flapping, and swaying, and quantifying the number of occurrences and duration would be useful in evaluating and sustaining the effectiveness of boundary deterrents such as beehive fences  .\nAutomatic behavioural detection methods may also be useful in evaluating proxies of elephant psychological state, such as relaxed versus perceived threat, at key locations such as water sources or wildlife crossings. When a more extensive set of behaviours, patterns or open-ended ethological questions are of interest, unsupervised deep phenotyping       provides a means to identify behavioural sequences from the statistics of the individual and group postural data alone. The consistency of discovered sequences with ethologically-relevant behaviour have been experimentally validated via optogenetic stimulation [ref]74 and pharmaceutical induction , and demonstrated high enough sensitivity to identify previously undescribed pausing and head-bobbing behavioural phenotypes in genetically-modified mice . Deep phenotyping could be used to study the differences in the type and structure of social behaviour between orphaned elephants versus elephants from intact families   , or translocated versus resident elephants  , in order to improve re-introduction and social integration efforts. We note that, when studying behaviour in natural settings, preference should be given to ABA methods that operate on postural representations, which were previously introduced, rather than single-stage methods that operate directly on pixels.\nSingle-stage methods, such as   , directly infer behaviour from changes in pixel values and provide a streamlined machine learning pipeline. These methods work well in controlled imaging environments with simple, consistent backgrounds such as laboratory settings, where the changes in pixel values are almost entirely attributable to a behaving animal. However, these methods will suffer when changes in pixel values are due to non-behavioural variables, such as imaging conditions, changing backgrounds, and visual appearance. These challenges are faced even in laboratory settings [ref]74 . On the other hand, if videos are cropped to tightly bound the relevant subjects in order to reduce image-based variability, a few studies have demonstrated high performance using single-stage behavioural inference in more controlled but still complex settings, such as in an enriched, multi-level home cage of group-housed rhesus macaques  and in a natural forest clearing of a resident wild chimpanzees’ home range using handheld video recorders . These demonstrations suggest that single-stage behavioural inference may still find application when fine-tuned for specific camera views and imaging conditions. To the best of our knowledge, automated vision-based behavioural analysis has not yet been conducted in free-ranging elephants, and only minimally in other wild free-ranging mammals (: wild chimpanzees, detecting nut cracking and passing food to mouth, : wild felines, standing, ambling, and galloping gait detections). A handful of papers have applied automated pose estimation to ground- and aerial-based videos (: wild apes,: ungulates), but have not explicitly conducted behavioural analyses.\nThis may be reflective of the challenge of translating automated behavioural analyses from the lab into the wild, as previously mentioned.\nAfter constraining the variability of ABA inputs, be it pose or pixels, to just behavioural variability, challenges and limitations of existing methods still remain.\nAutomated behaviour detection faces the standard challenges associated with supervised learning approaches, such as data labelling time, annotator inconsistency, and sampling and temporal bias. The ethological-relevance of the behavioural sequence classes discovered by deep phenotyping require manual human validation and semantic assignment in practice. These also produce more sequence classes than can be distinguishable by eye, and these are typically agglomerated by using a model variant that explicitly accounts for additional sources of behavioural variability, such as speed , or post-hoc via manual curation . Additional challenges in modelling individual and group elephant behaviour arise simply because of its complexity and species-specificity, and the development of behavioural methods to capture these nuances has not yet been motivated. For example, elephant interactions can be indirect and take place over the timescale of tens of minutes which laboratory-motivated methods, that are focused on sub-second behavioural precision, are generally not designed to perform inference at these timescales nor have the representational capacity to study these interactions. Moreover, elephants have complex, non-visual modes of signalling, to be explored in future sections, that are still just being understood and which may complicate the inference of indirect interactions within a group. The unprecedented group-level behaviour observations with individual behavioural resolution requires translation of theories from movement ecology   in order to better understand the group decision-making processes underlying socially hierarchical elephants. The application of these techniques to behavior patterns relevant to conservation is gradually being realised with advances in machine vision and laboratory-based ABA.\nFor example, quantifying the ”personality” of individual elephants to assess their likelihood of engaging in crop raiding    would allow the efficient allocation of GPS collars and other resources to monitor high-risk individuals. Remote evaluation of elephant behaviour could draw from studies demonstrated for humans, such as through gait tracking [ref]121 , and action patterns, such as driving patterns , to inform wildlife managers about elephant health, wellness, intrinsic states, and evolved behavioural strategies.\nDedicated work by AI/ML practitioners will be required to robustly translate the latest AI and ML methods to continuous, variable observations of elephants in their natural settings, scientific and field experts are needed to guide the behavioural questions and metrics of highest conservation priority, and dedicated investments from interdisciplinary researchers will be necessary to develop novel methods for studying elephant-specific, evolved and emergent behavioural strategies.\n\nReference markers found: [74]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]74: of the individual and group postural data alone.
