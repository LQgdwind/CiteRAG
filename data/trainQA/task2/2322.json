      "content": "Paper Title: Depth-Aware Multi-Grid Deep Homography Estimation with Contextual Correlation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA homography is an invertible mapping from one image plane to another with 8-DOF, including 2 for translation, 2 for rotation, 2 for scale, and 2 for lines at infinity. It has been widely served as an essential component of various computer vision applications, such as image stitching , video stabilization [ref]4 , camera calibration, and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Traditional algorithms estimate the homography in two ways. Pixel-based approaches update the homography parameters by optimizing the pixel-level alignment error between two images in an iterative way , often failing to deal with scenes with low overlap rates. Feature-based approaches search for the optimal homography model based on sparse feature correspondences using different feature extractors 0 1 2 and different robust estimation strategies3 4 5. However, they heavily depend on the number and distribution of feature correspondences, leading to poor robustness in low-texture scenes. Contrast to traditional algorithms, learning-based solutions 6 7 8 9 0 are proposed to handle the challenging low-texture scenes for their robust deep feature extraction.\nHowever, it is not efficient to explore the matching relationship between the deep feature maps by simply stacking convolutional layers.\nTherefore, deep learning solutions often demonstrate unsatisfying performance in scenes with low overlap rates. As shown in Fig. 1 (a), noticeable misalignments can be found in the result of the existing deep homography solution 0 when the overlap rate is low. In addition, with a single estimated homography, neither traditional solutions nor deep learning ones can perfectly align images with parallax caused by different depth planes and different baselines. To address this limitation, non-linear multi-homography estimation algorithms  1 2 3 are proposed to handle the challenging parallax. Usually, these methods partition an image into dense grids, and a distinct homography can be estimated for each grid using sparse feature correspondences. However, these multi-grid methods have higher requirements on the quantity and distribution of feature correspondences. They tend to show worse performance than single homography models in low-texture or low-resolution scenes. As shown in Fig. 1 (b), the existing traditional solution  fails in a low-texture indoor case. To simultaneously overcome the problems of poor robustness for traditional algorithms in low-texture scenes and failures for deep learning algorithms in low overlap rate cases, we design a contextual correlation layer (CCL) to explicitly capture the matching relationship between deep feature maps. The proposed layer is a flexible module that can be easily embedded in other matching-related networks, making a deep learning framework robust in both low-texture and low overlap rate scenarios. Compared with the cost volume 4 5, the proposed CCL has advantages of higher accuracy, faster speed, and lower memory consumption in the field of deep homography. Besides, to break the limitation that a single homography can not align images with parallax, we propose a multi-grid deep homography network to estimate multi-grid homography from global to local in an end-to-end framework. Specifically, the proposed network predicts a global homography first to align images coarsely and obtain the original shape of a mesh. Then the residual mesh deformation is estimated to enable our network to align images with parallax. The proposed framework can be easily trained in an unsupervised manner using a pixel-level content alignment loss. However, a content constraint alone tends to cause unnatural deformations to the mesh, such as self-intersection. Existing methods 6 7 handle this problem by adding a shape-preserved constraint, encouraging all grids in the mesh to be rectangular and adjacent grids to have similar shapes. Nevertheless, this measure is essentially a trade-off between content alignment and the natural mesh shape.\nIn this paper, we rethink this trade-off from the perspective of parallax. A depth-aware shape-preserved loss is proposed to promote the content alignment and the natural mesh shape simultaneously.\nFormally, we assign different depth levels to all grids, and only grids at the same depth level will be enforced to keep the shape consistent. As for the grids at different depth levels, there will be no shape constraint, encouraging the content alignment as much as possible. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our algorithm surpasses the state-of-the-art homography estimation methods in both the synthetic benchmark dataset and the real-world dataset. Moreover, a comprehensive comparison between the proposed CCL and the cost volume is provided to support our superiority. To sum up, we conclude our contributions as follows: We design a novel contextual correlation layer (CCL) to explicitly explore the long-range feature correlation. It outperforms the traditional cost volume in the accuracy, the number of parameters, and the speed in the field of deep homography. We propose an end-to-end multi-grid homography estimation network, enabling our network to align images with parallax. To avoid the trade-off between the alignment and the shape, a depth-aware shape-preserved loss is presented to improve the content alignment and the natural mesh shape simultaneously.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: 2 for rotation, 2 for scale, and 2 for lines at infinity.
