      "content": "Paper Title: IQ-Learn: Inverse soft-Q Learning for Imitation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImitation of an expert has long been recognized as a powerful approach for\nsequential decision-making¬† [ref]1, with applications as diverse as healthcare¬†[ref]39, autonomous driving¬†, and playing complex strategic games¬†.\nIn the imitation learning (IL) setting, we are given a set of expert trajectories, with the goal of learning a policy which induces behavior similar to the expert‚Äôs.\nThe learner has no access to the reward, and no explicit knowledge of the dynamics. The simple behavioural cloning¬† approach simply maximizes the probability of the expert‚Äôs actions under the learned policy, approaching the IL problem as a supervised learning problem.\nWhile this can work well in simple environments and with large quantities of data, it ignores the sequential nature of the decision-making problem, and small errors can quickly compound when the learned policy departs from the states observed under the expert. A natural way of introducing the environment dynamics is by framing the IL problem as an Inverse RL (IRL) problem, aiming to learn a reward function under which the expert‚Äôs trajectory is optimal, and from which the learned imitation policy can be trained¬†[ref]1.\nThis framing has inspired several approaches which use rewards either explicitly or implicitly to incorporate dynamics while learning an imitation policy¬†   [ref]22.\nHowever, these dynamics-aware methods are typically hard to put into practice due to unstable learning which can be sensitive to hyperparameter choice or minor implementation details¬†. In this work, we introduce a dynamics-aware imitation learning method which has stable, non-adversarial training, allowing us to achieve state-of-the-art performance on imitation learning benchmarks.\nOur key insight is that much of the difficulty with previous IL methods arises from the IRL-motivated representation of the IL problem as a min-max problem over reward and policy¬† [ref]1. This introduces a requirement to separately model the reward and policy, and train these two functions jointly, often in an adversarial fashion.\nDrawing on connections between RL and energy-based models¬† , we propose learning a single model for the QùëÑQ-value.\nThe QùëÑQ-value then implicitly defines both a reward and policy function. This turns a difficult min-max problem over policy and reward functions into a simpler minimization problem over a single function, the QùëÑQ-value.\nSince our problem has a one-to-one correspondence with the min-max problem studied in adversarial IL , we\nmaintain the generality and guarantees of these previous approaches, resulting in a meaningful reward that may be used for inverse reinforcement learning. Furthermore, our method may be used to minimize a variety of statistical divergences between the expert and learned policy.\nWe show that we recover several previously-described approaches as special cases of particular divergences, such as the regularized behavioural cloning of¬†, and the conservative Q-learning of¬†. In our experiments, we find that our method is performant even with very sparse data - surpassing prior methods using one expert demonstration in the completely offline setting - and can scale to complex image-based tasks like Atari reaching expert performance. Moreover, our learnt rewards are highly predictive of the original environment rewards.\nFinally, our method is robust to distribution shifts in the environment showing great generalization performance to never seen goals and an ability to act as a meta-learner. Concretely, our contributions are as follows: We present a modified QùëÑQ-learning update rule for imitation learning that can be implemented on top of soft-Q learning or soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithms in fewer than 15 lines of code. We introduce a simple framework to minimize a wide range of statistical distances: Integral Probability Metrics (IPMs) and f-divergences, between the expert and learned distributions. We empirically show state-of-art results in a variety of imitation learning settings: online and offline IL. On the complex Atari suite, we outperform prior methods by 3-7x while requiring 3x less environment steps. We characterize our learnt rewards and show a high positive correlation with the ground-truth rewards, justifying the use of our method for Inverse Reinforcement Learning. \n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\n\n\nReference\n\n\n\nDynamics ¬†¬†Aware\n\n\n\nNon-Adversarial ¬†¬†Training\n\n\n\nConvergence ‚ÄÖGuarantees\n\n\n\nNon-restrictive ¬†¬†Reward\n\n\n\nDirect ¬†¬†Optimization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline\n\n\n\n\nMax Margin IRL\n\n\n\n [ref]1\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n√ó\\times\n\n\n\n√ó\\times\n\n\n\n\nMax Entropy IRL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n√ó\\times\n\n\n\n√ó\\times\n\n\n\n\nGAIL/AIRL\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n√ó\\times\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n√ó\\times\n\n\n\n\n\nASAF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n√ó\\times\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n\n\nSQIL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n√ó\\times\n\n\n\n√ó\\times\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n\n\nOurs (Online)\n\n\n\n‚Äì\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffline\n\n\n\n\nMax Margin IRL\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n√ó\\times\n\n\n\n√ó\\times\n\n\n\n\nMax Likelihood IRL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n√ó\\times\n\n\n\n√ó\\times\n\n\n\n\nMax Entropy IRL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n√ó\\times\n\n\n\n√ó\\times\n\n\n\n\n\nValueDICE\n\n\n\n[ref]22\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n√ó\\times\n\n\n\n√ó\\times\n\n\n\n√ó\\times\n\n\n\n√ó\\times\n\n\n\n\n\nBehavioral Cloning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n√ó\\times\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n√ó\\times\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n\n\nRegularized BC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n√ó\\times\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n\n\nEDM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n√ó\\times\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n\n\nOurs (Offline)\n\n\n\n‚Äì\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\n\n\n‚úì\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Imitation of an expert has long been recognized as a powerful approach for\nsequential decision-making¬† [ref]1, with applications as diverse as healthcare¬†[ref]39, autonomous driving¬†, and playing complex strategic games¬†.\nIn the imitation learning (IL) setting, we are given a set of expert\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
