      "content": "Paper Title: Mitigating Task Interference in Multi-Task Learning via Explicit Task Routing with Non-Learnable Primitives\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe briefly review prior work on non-learnable primitives and mitigating task interference for multi-task learning (MTL), from which our work draws inspiration. Due to space constraints, we refer the readers to the supplementary material for more discussion of related work. We also encourage readers to refer to multiple excellent reviews    for a comprehensive overview of MTL. Non-Learnable Primitives (NLPs): The notion of NLP for feature extraction was explored for single-task learning motivated either by scientific curiosity or in the quest for computational efficiency [ref]15 7 4  . Xu et al. used non-learnable sparse binary convolutional filters referred to as LBConv [ref]15. Wu et al. proposed randomly adjusting the spatial alignments of data, referred to as shift 4. Xu et al. applied non-learnable additive noises sampled from a uniform distribution to data, referred to as perturbation 7. Yu et al. replaced the attention-based token mixer with a non-parametric pooling primitive in vision transformers 8. As a common practice, a follow-up 1×1111\\times 1 convolution was used to learn a weighted linear combination of features extracted by non-learnable primitives. These methods generally perform as well as those with standard learnable layers but with much fewer parameters required to optimize. However, the utility of NLPs for MTL is yet to be explored. The NLP-based feature extraction proposed in this work is notably different in three key respects: (i) We expand the scope of NLP from single-task image classification to MTL, including image-level and pixel-level prediction tasks. (ii) We consider multiple types of NLPs (i.e., pooling, shift, perturbation, convolution without learnable weights) and demonstrate that a single type of NLP does not benefit MTL. (iii) We design an MTL-specific NLP by exploring various combinations of NLPs under a diverse set of hyperparameters (e.g., pooling/kernel size, sparsity, perturbation strength, real, binary, depth-wise separable weights, etc.). Task Interference in MTL: The success of MTL in computer vision has led to many solutions for mitigating task interference in MTL. The approaches fall into three main categories, (i) loss/gradient balancing    4 , (ii) parameter partitioning 7  8 0, and (iii) architectural design   9 (supplementary materials). A brief overview is provided below. –Loss/Gradient balancing:\nKendall et al.  utilized homoscedastic uncertainty as task-dependent weights to balance the losses of various tasks. Chen et al.  adaptively balanced the training of deep MTL models by dynamically adjusting the magnitudes of gradients computed w.r.t different tasks. Liu et al.  proposed task-specific loss functions to maintain balance among tasks. Finally, Sener and Koltun 4 applied multi-objective optimization to find Pareto-optimal gradients for multiple tasks. The primary goal of this class of methods is to control the contribution of the loss/gradient of each task to the overall loss/gradient, which in turn implicitly helps mitigate task interference. –Parameter partitioning: Attention mechanisms have been widely used to allow networks to focus on different regions of the feature maps adaptively 3. Attention mechanisms have been employed  for MTL at the filter level, allowing each task to select a subset of parameters (i.e., partition) at each layer. Maninis et al. 8 used a task-specific squeeze-and-excitation module (i.e., channel attention) for soft parameter partitioning. Strezoski et al. 7 introduced a task routing module as a hard parameter partitioning strategy to alleviate interference among tasks by randomly assigning a sub-network to each task. Once assigned, the parameter partitioning remained unchanged. Maximum roaming improved task routing by adaptively updating the parameter partition assignments during training 0. In contrast to the overlapped parameter partitioning in the aforementioned work, our task routing strategy explicitly reserves a task-specific branch of parameters exclusive for each task, leading to more precise control over the partitioning of parameters among the tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: Non-Learnable Primitives (NLPs): The notion of NLP for feature extraction was explored for single-task learning motivated either by scientific curiosity or in the quest for computational efficiency [ref]15 7 4  .
