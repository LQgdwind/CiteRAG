      "content": "Paper Title: 2PS: High-Quality Edge Partitioning with Two-Phase Streaming\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph partitioning is a problem with a long history in research . It has numerous applications in solving optimization problems, e.g., in VLSI design  and operator placement in stream processing systems . In this paper, we focus on the edge partitioning problem. In particular, edge partitioning has gained a lot of attention as a preprocessing step for distributed graph processing systems, e.g., PowerGraph  and Spark/GraphX . Random-access partitioners    require full information about the graph structure, i.e., the complete graph is loaded into memory of either a single machine  or a cluster of multiple machines   before partitioning is performed. The major shortcoming of such partitioners is that they consume a lot of memory. However, memory is a scarce and expensive resource. While a single machine may not have sufficient memory capacities to keep a large graph, employing a cluster of machines to perform graph partitioning induces a higher monetary cost. Streaming edge partitioning is a common approach to reduce the memory overhead of edge partitioning. There are a number of approaches to streaming edge partitioning. Besides stateless partitioning based on hashing (e.g., DBH ), stateful partitioners have received growing attention. The basic idea is that by gathering state about past assignment decisions, future edges in the stream can be partitioned with a lower replication degree. In this regard, the main differentiation between streaming partitioners so far has been in the formulation of the scoring function. Different such functions have been proposed, e.g., Greedy  and HDRF . However, all of these approaches suffer from the uninformed assignment problem. An earlier approach to overcome this problem has been proposed in ADWISE , which allows for dynamically re-ordering the edge stream such that the assignment of uninformed edges can be delayed. This way, locality in the edge stream can be exploited. However, the gains in replication factor depend on the window size, and a larger window imposes a larger run-time. Opposed to that, 2PS can reduce both replication factor and run-time compared to stateful streaming partitioning because the pre-partitioning based on vertex clustering is extremely lightweight and does not involve the computation of a scoring function. Stanton and Kliot  proposed a streaming model for vertex partitioning; the difference to streaming edge partitioning is that in streaming vertex partitioning, adjacency lists of vertices are ingested and vertices are assigned to partitions. FENNEL  is a more recent partitioner that follows the vertex partitioning model. Bourse et al.  describe a method to transform vertex partitioning into edge partitioning. However, it requires significant preprocessing to create adjacency lists from an input edge list, as well as significant postprocessing to transform vertex partitioning into edge partitioning. These costs are avoided when the edge partitioning problem is solved directly, as we do in 2PS. Some graph processing systems employ special execution models that require a specific style of graph partitioning different from edge partitioning or vertex partitioning. PowerLyra  is a hybrid distributed graph processing system that uses a combination of vertex-centric and edge-centric processing. Therefore, it also employs its own hybrid partitioning strategy that combines vertex partitioning and edge partitioning. Out-of-core graph processing systems like GraphChi , GridGraph  and Mosaic  employ different graph preprocessing methods that involve specific graph partitioning problems. A related problem is the partitioning of hypergraphs. In hypergraphs, an edge (sometimes called hyperedge) can connect more than only two vertices. This way, group relationships can be modeled. The problem of partitioning hypergraphs into multiple components while minimizing the cut size has also been tackled by streaming [ref]3 as well as random-access algorithms    .\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: only two vertices. This way, group relationships can be modeled.
