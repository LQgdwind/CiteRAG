      "content": "Paper Title: Scalable & Efficient Training of Large Convolutional Neural Networks with Differential Privacy\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep convolutional neural networks (CNN)  [ref]31 are the backbone in vision-related tasks, including image classification , object detection [ref]38, image generation [ref]20, video recognition , and audio classification . A closer look at the dominating success of deep CNNs reveals its basis on two factors. The first factor is the strong capacity of the convolutional neural networks, usually characterized by the enormous model size. Recent state-of-the-art progresses usually result from very large models, with millions to billions of trainable parameters. For example, ImageNet  accuracy grows when larger VGGs  (increasing 11 to 19 layers‚üπ‚üπ\\Longrightarrow69% to 74% accuracy) or ResNets  (increasing 18 to 152 layers‚üπ‚üπ\\Longrightarrow70% to 78% accuracy) are used . Consequently, the eager to use larger models for better accuracy naturally draws people‚Äôs attention to the scalability and efficiency of training. The second factor is the availability of big data, which oftentimes contain private and sensitive information. The usage of such data demands rigorous protection against potential privacy attacks. In fact, one standard approach to guarantee the protection is by differentially private (DP)   training of the models. Since , CNNs have achieved promising results under strong DP guarantee: CIFAR10 achieves 92.4% accuracy in  and ImageNet achieves 81.1% accuracy in 0. Unifying the two driving factors of CNNs leads to the DP training of large CNNs. However, the following challenges are hindering our application of large and private CNNs in practice. Challenge 1: Time and space efficiency in DP training.\nDP training can be extremely inefficient in memory and speed. For example, a straightforward implementation in Tensorflow Privacy library shows that DP training can be 1000√ó1000\\times slower than the non-DP training, even on a small RNN ; other standard DP libraries, Opacus 0 and JAX  , which trade off memory for speed, could not fit a single datapoint into GPU on GPT2-large ; addtionally, 3‚àº9√ó3\\sim 9\\times slowdown of DP training has been reported in  0  using JAX. The computational bottleneck comes from the per-sample gradient clipping at each iteration (see (2.1)), a necessary step in DP deep learning. I.e., denoting the loss as ‚àëi‚Ñíisubscriptùëñsubscript‚Ñíùëñ\\sum_{i}\\mathcal{L}_{i}, we need to clip the per-sample gradient {‚àÇ‚Ñíi‚àÇùêñ}isubscriptsubscript‚Ñíùëñùêñùëñ\\{\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}_{i}}{\\partial\\mathbf{W}}\\}_{i} individually. This computational issue is even more severe when we apply a large batch size, which is necessary to achieve high accuracy of DP neural networks. In   , it is shown that the optimal batch size for DP training is significantly larger than for regular training. For instance, DP ResNet18 achieves best performance on ImageNet when batch size is 64*1024 ; and DP ResNet152 and ViT-Large use a batch size 220superscript2202^{20} in . As a result, an efficient implementation of per-sample gradient clipping is much-needed to fully leverage the benefit of large batch training. Challenge 2: Do large DP vision models necessarily harm accuracy?\nAn upsetting observation in DP vision models is that, over certain relatively small model size, larger DP CNNs seem to underperform smaller ones. This is observed in models that are either pre-trained or trained from scratch  . As an example of the pre-trained cases, previously state-of-the-art CIFAR10 is obtained from a small DP linear model , and the fine-tuned DP ResNet50 underperforms DP ResNet18 on ImageNet . On the contrary, the empirical evidence in DP language models shows that larger models can consistently achieve better accuracy . Interestingly, we empirically demonstrate that this trend can possibly hold in vision models as well.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN)  [ref]31 are the backbone in vision-related tasks, including image classification , object detection [ref]38, image generation [ref]20, video recognition , and audio classification .
