      "content": "Paper Title: Comprehensive Evaluation of RSB and Spectre Vulnerability on Modern Processors\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn order to maximize the required speculative execution window for the leaked data to be mapped into the cache, the access time for the original return address must be increased. This avoids the speculatively executed instructions to be determined as a mistakenly taken branch, immaturely  [ref]11 . To achieve this, we must evict the stack pointer from the cache  . Not limited to the stack pointer, in different experiments and attack scenarios, it is required to evict different data from the cache. These experiments are introduced and explained in detail in Section 5. Unlike Intel processors, which provide the user with the unprivileged clflush instruction to flush arbitrary data from the cache , no such unprivileged mechanism is incorporated in ARM processors . In this work, after obtaining proof of concept for cache eviction on ARM processors through native instructions, we implemented the solution proposed by Lipp et al.,  to evict data from the cache in unprivileged mode. As each processor model in the ARM family incorporates a different microarchitectural design, we test different eviction strategy on each ARM processor. Table I shows eviction variables, calculated in our work for each processor, based on the approach introduced in . These variables determine the loop parameters to successfully evict data from the cache.\nWe should point out that we could not find an effective eviction strategy for ARM Cortex-A8 CPU.\nThis is because Cortex-A8 appears to follow different cache address-bit mapping from the standard one. Therefore, to effectively evict the target address from the Cortex-A8 cache in the user mode, we access a large structure that is 3×\\times of cache size . However, this approach has some downside compared to the ARMagedon approach, which is requiring more time to complete. Moreover, to obtain our proof of concept implementations, we have used privileged cache eviction instructions, provided by ARM.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: into the cache, the access time for the original return address must be increased.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
