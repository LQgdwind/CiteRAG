Following [ref]9 , we use three widely used evaluation tasks: node classification, node clustering, and link prediction. DBLP 222https://dblp.uni-trier.de/:\nWe adopt a subset of DBLP extracted by .\nThe authors are divided into four areas.\nDBLP is used for node classification and node clustering with data partition of 400 (9.86%), 400 (9.86%), and 3257 (80.28%) for training, validation, and testing. IMDb 333https://www.imdb.com/:\nWe adopt a subset of IMDb extracted by .\nEach movie is labeled as one of three classes.\nIMDb is used for both node classification and node clustering with data partition of 400 (9.35%), 400 (9.35%), and 3478 (81.30%) nodes for training, validation, and testing, respectively. Last.fm 444https://www.last.fm/:\nWe adopt a subset of Last.fm released by .\nNo label or features are included.\nLast.fm dataset is used for the link prediction task.\nAll links are divided into training, validation, and testing set with data partition of 18567 (20%), 9283 (10%), and 64984 (70%), respectively. Baselines.\nWe compare MV-HetGNN with the following baselines: Metapath2vec  uses metapath-guided random walks and skip-gram model [ref]49 to generates node embeddings.\nWe test Metapath2vec++  on all metapaths separately and report the best results. HERec [ref]50 applies DeepWalk  on multiple metapath-based homogeneous graphs, and proposes an fusion algorithm for rating prediction.\nFor node classification/clustering, we report the best result of all metapaths. GCN  performs convolutional operations in the graph Fourier domain. GAT  conducts convolutional operations in the spatial domain with the attention mechanism.\nWe test GCN and GAT on metapath-based homogeneous graphs and report the best results. HAN [ref]9 learns node embeddings from different metapath-based homogeneous graphs and leverages the attention mechanism to combine them into one vector for each node. HGT  designs node- and edge-type dependent parameters to characterize the heterogeneous attention over each edge to model heterogeneity. MAGNN  uses intra-metapath aggregation and inter-metapath aggregation to encode metapath instances, and learn the importance of different metapaths by an attention mechanism. The above baselines can be divided into four categories.\nMetapath2vec and HERec are the shallow heterogeneous graphs embedding models.\nGCN and GAT are conventional GNNs designed for homogeneous graphs.\nHGT is the first category of heterogeneous graph neural networks (as described in Section 2.2).\nHAN and MAGNN are the second category of heterogeneous graph neural networks. Implementation.\nFor Metapath2vec and HERec, we set the window size to 5, walk length to 100, walks per node to 40, and the number of negative samples to 5.\nFor all GNNs, we set the dropout rate to 0.5 as default.\nFor HAN, MAGNN, and HGT, we follow the original setting reported in these papers.\nFor MV-HetGNN, we employ the Adam optimizer,\nand set the learning rate to 0.005, 0.001, 0.001 for DBLP and IMDb and Last.fm dataset, respectively.\nWe set the number of layers of view-specific auto encoder M𝑀M as 2.\n\nFor the dimension hyper-parameters\nd′superscript𝑑′d^{\\prime} (output feature dimension of node feature transformation),\ndM2superscript𝑑𝑀2d^{\\frac{M}{2}} (the output dimension of the encoder of view-specific autoencoder) and\nd𝑑d (the dimension of multi-view representations),\nwe set d′=2​dM2=2​dsuperscript𝑑′2superscript𝑑𝑀22𝑑d^{\\prime}=2d^{\\frac{M}{2}}=2d for DBLP,\nand d′=dM2=dsuperscript𝑑′superscript𝑑𝑀2𝑑d^{\\prime}=d^{\\frac{M}{2}}=d for IMDb and\nd′=dM2=dsuperscript𝑑′superscript𝑑𝑀2𝑑d^{\\prime}=d^{\\frac{M}{2}}=d for Last.fm datasets, respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: Dataset.\nAs shown in Table II, three heterogeneous graph datasets from different domains are used to evaluate the performance of MV-HetGNN.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
