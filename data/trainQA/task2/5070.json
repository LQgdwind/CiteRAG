      "content": "Paper Title: Interacting Hand-Object Pose Estimation via Dense Mutual Attention\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nComparison with State-of-the-Arts. In Table 1, we evaluate our model on the HO3D v2 testing set and compare the results with state-of-the-art methods [ref]12 [ref]13 [ref]26 . All results under hand metrics are collected from the official HO3D v2 CodaLab Challenge outcomes. From the table, we observe that our method achieves superior results across all hand, object, and interaction metrics. In particular, our method not only produces more accurate hand and object poses, but also generates physically realistic hand-object grasping in higher quality as we observe a lower penetration and a higher contact rate than [ref]13. Meanwhile, our method leverages an efficient feed-forward pipeline from a single image input and does not require computationally-expensive optical flows as temporal clues [ref]12 or iterative optimization process [ref]13. Furthermore, our method does not rely on sophisticated contact losses as in [ref]12 [ref]13, showing the superiority of our method in modeling hand-object interaction. Compared to [ref]26, our model is trained with remarkably less augmented data, yet achieves improved results without introducing much complexity. Finally, thanks to the dense mutual attention, our method improves the performance by a large margin than the sparse keypoints-based method . To further justify the effectiveness of the model, we also evaluate our model on the recently released DexYCB dataset and compare the results with  [ref]13  in Table 2. Note that while [ref]13 has the same setting with us,   do not assume known object CAD models, therefore tackle a more challenging task and can perform worse in estimating accurate object meshes. Hence we only compare with them in the hand metric. The results show that our method consistently outperforms baseline methods in all comparable metrics. Qualitative Results. We show qualitative results on the HO3D and DexYCB testing sets in Figure 3. We render the estimated hand and object meshes under the camera view along with three randomly rotated views. It can be seen that our method produces accurate hand-object poses that align well with the given image input, and the estimated poses satisfy physical constraints, i.e. a valid grasping can be observed. More results can be found in the supplementary material.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: Comparison with State-of-the-Arts. In Table 1, we evaluate our model on the HO3D v2 testing set and compare the results with state-of-the-art methods [ref]12 [ref]13 [ref]26 . All results under hand metrics are collected from the official HO3D v2 CodaLab Challenge outcomes. From the table, we observe that our method achieves superior results\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
