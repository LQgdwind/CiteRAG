      "content": "Paper Title: QREChem: Quantum Resource Estimation Software for Chemistry Applications\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nQuantum chemistry is often quoted as a potential “killer app” for quantum computers, with grand targets such as solving nitrogen fixation [ref]1. While there\nis much promise for quantum computers in quantum chemistry, due to a potential for an exponential speed up in eigenvalue estimation in quantum chemistry via the quantum phase\nestimation (QPE) algorithm  , realistic resource estimates,\nboth at the logical and physical level, point to extremely large numbers of quantum gates and qubits necessary for even small systems [ref]1 . Alternate algorithms,\nmore suited to near-term, noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ)  devices, such as the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) , provide a potential reduction\nin gate depth, but add additional complexity in optimization  and still require substantial gate depth for more interesting, classically intractable\nsystems.\nWith fault-tolerant, error-corrected quantum computers capable of the required gate depth and numbers of qubits still potentially years away, accurate resource estimates will\nplay a key role in understanding the progress of quantum algorithms and the trade-offs of various architectural choices. There already exists several tools for estimating\nresources to varying degrees of precision. For example, TFermion [ref]8 provides estimates of a wide variety of quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry\nbut relies on strict error bounds, sometimes greatly overestimating the resources for certain algorithms, while OpenFermion provides estimates of certain specific quantum chemistry methods and\nalso provides some tools for estimating surface code overhead [ref]9. Microsoft has released a ‘full-stack’ resource estimation\nframework and tool , which allows for a more general resource estimation, including many potential hardware overheads. Here, we detail QREChem, which provides accurate logical\nresource estimates with a specific focus on quantum chemistry. Within QREChem we have implemented a detailed resource estimation of\nthe Trotter algorithm  , using heuristic, rather than worst-case, estimates for various algorithmic overheads.\nWe have also included minimal implementations of error correction\nand hardware overheads. To benchmark our method, we compare our resource estimates to both TFermion [ref]8 and OpenFermion [ref]9 by estimating\nthe total number of logical T gates for various small molecules and for the larger FeMoco molecule [ref]1. QREChem was developed in mind as a tool for providing realistic estimations of resources to simulate ab initio quantum chemistry calculations on various quantum\ncomputers, both existing and future ones. It serves multiple purposes, with a primary goal of eventual co-design of future quantum computers and development of\nnew quantum algorithms. For example, given a molecule, QREChem will be able to predict the resources (the number of qubits, gates, fidelities, sampling rate) required\nto accurately estimate the ground state energy. Or another way around given quantum hardware and molecule, QREChem could calculate a potential success rate. The current version\nof QREChem focuses on the algorithmic implementations; further development will involve adding more detailed implementations for the hardware and error correction overheads\nto provide more precise estimates.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Quantum chemistry is often quoted as a potential “killer app” for quantum computers, with grand targets such as solving nitrogen fixation [ref]1.
