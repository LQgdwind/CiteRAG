      "content": "Paper Title: Tiny Adversarial Multi-Objective Oneshot Neural Architecture Search\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe aim to explore the influence of network architecture on its robustness against adversarial attacks. So we focus on white box adversarial attacks bounded by l∞subscript𝑙l_{\\infty}. As we all know, PGD [ref]3 adversarial training is computationally expensive and hard to converge. We follow  [ref]17 and adopt the TRADES-YOPO-m-n algorithm [ref]17 to speed up our adversarial training. This work adopts the loss function in , which is described as below: where ℒ(.,.)\\mathcal{L}\\left(.,.\\right) denotes the cross-entropy loss function; fθ​(x)subscript𝑓𝜃𝑥f_{\\theta}(x) denotes the output vector of the neural network, which is parameterized by θ𝜃\\theta. y𝑦y is the label-indicator vector; η𝜂\\eta denotes the image noise (perturbation); λ𝜆\\lambda is a balancing hyperparameter. fθ​(x+η)subscript𝑓𝜃𝑥𝜂f_{\\theta}(x+\\eta) denotes the output vector of the neural network where the perturbation η𝜂\\eta are added into the input. The aim of this loss function is to reduce the gap between adversarial examples and non-adversarial examples when the model undertakes the classification task, i.e. making the classification boundary more smooth. TRADES-YOPO-m-n borrows the idea from Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle  to approximate the back-propogation. One assumption of TRADES-YOPO-m-n is that the adversarial perturbation is only coupled with the weights of the first layer. TRADES-YOPO-m-n performs n times gradient descent to update the weights of the first layer and iteratively runs m times for each data point. Zhang et al. [ref]17 state that m×n𝑚𝑛m\\times n should be a little larger than the number of attack iterations so that TRADES-YOPO-m-n could achieve a competitive result. In our experimental setting, the number of outer-loops m is set to 5 and the number of inner loop n is set to 3 if we desire to attack the models in 10 iterations by PGD [ref]3. The training time for each epoch is 2.5 minutes running on a single GPU V100.
