      "content": "Paper Title: Larger Corner-Free Sets from Combinatorial Degenerations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur second result is a strong limitation of current tensor methods to effectively upper bound the Shannon capacity of hypergraphs. This limitation is caused by induced matchings and applies to various combinatorial problems including the corner problem. We use a method of Strassen to show that these limitations are indeed very strong for the corner problem. In order to elaborate on these results let us first give an overview of upper bound methods.\nThe general question of upper bounds on the Shannon capacity of hypergraphs is particularly well-studied in the special setting of undirected graphs, from which the name “Shannon capacity” comes: it in fact corresponds to the zero-error capacity of a channel .\nEven for undirected graphs, it is not clear how to compute the Shannon capacity in general, but some methods were developed to give upper bounds.\nThe difficulty is to find a good upper bound on the largest independent set that behaves well under the product ⊠⊠\\boxtimes.\nFor undirected graphs, the best known methods are the Lovász theta function  and the Haemers bound which is based on the matrix rank . For hypergraphs, we only know of algebraic methods that are based on various notions of tensor rank, and in particular the slice rank  (which was used and studied extensively in combinatorics, in the context of cap sets  ,\nsunflowers  and right-corners ), and similar notions like the analytic rank   , the geometric rank [ref]32, and the G-stable rank . Even though the slice rank is not multiplicative under ⊠⊠\\boxtimes it is possible to give good upper bounds on the asymptotic slice rank via an asymptotic analysis , which is closely related to the Strassen support functionals  or the more recent quantum functionals . Most of the rank-based bounds actually give upper bounds on the size of induced matchings and not only on the size of independent sets. It is simple and instructive to see this argument in the setting of undirected graphs.\nFor a given graph H=(V,E)𝐻𝑉𝐸H=(V,E), let A𝐴A be the adjacency matrix in which we set all the diagonal coefficients to 111.\nThen for any independent set I⊆V𝐼𝑉I\\subseteq V, the submatrix (Ai,j)i,j∈Isubscriptsubscript𝐴𝑖𝑗𝑖𝑗𝐼(A_{i,j})_{i,j\\in I} of A𝐴A is the identity matrix and as a result |I|≤rank⁡(A)𝐼rank𝐴|I|\\leq\\operatorname{rank}(A).\nAs the matrix rank is multiplicative under tensor product, we get Θ​(H)≤rank⁡(A)Θ𝐻rank𝐴\\Theta(H)\\leq\\operatorname{rank}(A).\nObserve that this argument works equally well if we consider an induced matching instead of an independent set.\nAn induced matching of size s𝑠s of the graph H=(V,E)𝐻𝑉𝐸H=(V,E) can be defined by two lists of vertices I1​(1),…,I1​(s)subscript𝐼11…subscript𝐼1𝑠I_{1}(1),\\dots,I_{1}(s) and I2​(1),…,I2​(s)subscript𝐼21…subscript𝐼2𝑠I_{2}(1),\\dots,I_{2}(s) of size s𝑠s such that for any α,β∈{1,…,s}𝛼𝛽1…𝑠\\alpha,\\beta\\in\\{1,\\dots,s\\} we have In other words, the submatrix (Ai,j)i∈I1,j∈I2subscriptsubscript𝐴𝑖𝑗formulae-sequence𝑖subscript𝐼1𝑗subscript𝐼2(A_{i,j})_{i\\in I_{1},j\\in I_{2}} is an identity matrix, which also implies that s≤rank⁡(A)𝑠rank𝐴s\\leq\\operatorname{rank}(A). As such, the matrix rank is an upper bound on the asymptotic maximum induced matching.\nTensor rank methods such as the subrank, slice rank, analytic rank, geometric rank and G-stable rank also provide upper bounds on the asymptotic maximum induced matching. Using a result of Strassen , we show that there is an induced matching of the n𝑛n-th power of H𝐻H of size 4n−o​(1)superscript4𝑛𝑜14^{n-o(1)}. This establishes a barrier on many existing tensor methods (such as slice rank, subrank, analytic rank, etc.) to make progress on Problem 1.1. In fact, this result holds more generally for any abelian group G𝐺G: For any abelian group G𝐺G, the hypergraph H⊠nsuperscript𝐻⊠absent𝑛H^{\\boxtimes n} has an induced matching of size |G|2​n−o​(n)superscript𝐺2𝑛𝑜𝑛|G|^{2n-o(n)}.\nIn other words, for any n≥1𝑛1n\\geq 1, there exist lists I1,I2,I3⊆Gn×Gnsubscript𝐼1subscript𝐼2subscript𝐼3superscript𝐺𝑛superscript𝐺𝑛I_{1},I_{2},I_{3}\\subseteq G^{n}\\times G^{n} of size s​(n)=|G|2​n−o​(n)𝑠𝑛superscript𝐺2𝑛𝑜𝑛s(n)=|G|^{2n-o(n)} such that the following holds. For any α,β,γ∈{1,…,s​(n)}𝛼𝛽𝛾1…𝑠𝑛\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma\\in\\{1,\\dots,s(n)\\} We prove this result by establishing in Theorem 3.6 that the adjacency tensor of the hypergraph H𝐻H is tight (see Definition 3.4). Strassen showed in  that for tight sets, the asymptotic induced matching number is characterized by the support functionals. By computing the support functionals for the relevant tensors, we establish the claimed result in Corollary 3.8. Note that if we could ensure that I1=I2=I3subscript𝐼1subscript𝐼2subscript𝐼3I_{1}=I_{2}=I_{3}, this would solve Problem 1.1. We computed the maximum independent set and maximum induced matching for H⊠nsuperscript𝐻⊠absent𝑛H^{\\boxtimes n} for small powers n=1,2,3𝑛123n=1,2,3 (see Table 1) and we found that the maximum independent set is strictly smaller than the maximum induced matching for n=2𝑛2n=2 and n=3𝑛3n=3. This motivates the search for methods that go beyond the maximum induced matching barrier. For comparison, we also give the analogous numbers for the cap set hypergraph Hcapsubscript𝐻capH_{\\mathrm{cap}} (which is an undirected hypergraph), where, interestingly, the maximum independent set and the maximum induced matching are equal.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: slice rank  (which was used and studied extensively in combinatorics, in the context of cap sets  ,\nsunflowers  and right-corners ), and similar notions like the analytic rank   , the geometric rank [ref]32, and the G-stable rank .
