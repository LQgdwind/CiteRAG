Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: Transformer Based Deliberation for Two-Pass Speech Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe use the multidomain datasets described in [ref]29 for large-scale training. The English utterances are sampled from multiple domains such as general Google traffic, far-field environments, telephony conversations, and YouTube. These utterances are anonymized and hand-transcribed except for YouTube whose transcripts are extracted in a semi-supervised way . We augment the clean training utterances by artificially corrupting them by using a room simulator, varying degrees of noise, and reverberation such that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is between 0dB and 30dB . We also use mixed-bandwidth utterances at 8kHz or 16 kHz for training [ref]38. For the feature extraction front-end, we divide and window a speech waveform using 32-ms hanning windows at a rate of 10 ms, and then compute 128-dimensional log-Mel spectra. Each log-spectrum is stacked with three previous frames to form a 512-dimensional vector, and then downsampled to a 30-ms frame rate. Our models are trained in Tensorflow  using the Lingvo framework  on 8×\\times8 TPU slices with a global batch size of 4,096. As in , we use constant learning rate for training and maintain an exponential moving average  of the trained model parameters for evaluation.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: We use the multidomain datasets described in [ref]29 for large-scale training.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
