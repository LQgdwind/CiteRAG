      "content": "Paper Title: DN-DETR: Accelerate DETR Training by Introducing Query DeNoising\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCarion et al.¬† proposed an end-to-end object detector based on Transformers ¬† named DETR (DEtection TRansformer) without using anchors. While DETR achieves comparable results with Faster-RCNN 8, its training suffers severely from the slow convergence problem ‚Äî it needs 500500500 epochs of training to obtain a good performance. Many recent works have attempted to speed up the training process of DETR. Some find the cross attention of Transformer decoders in DETR inefficient and make improvements in different ways. For example, Dai et al.¬†[Dai_2021_ICCV] designed a dynamic decoder that can focus on regions of interest in a coarse-to-fine manner and lower the learning difficulty. Sun et al.¬†9 discarded the Transformer decoder and proposed an encoder-only DETR. Another series of works make improvements in decoder queries. Zhu et al.¬† designed an attention module that only attends to some sampling points around a reference point. Meng et al.¬†5 decoupled each decoder query into a content part and a position part and only utilized the content-to-content and position-to-position terms in the cross-attention formulation. Yao et al.¬† utilized a Region Proposal Network (RPN) to propose top-KùêæK anchor points. DAB-DETR ¬†4 uses 444-D box coordinates as queries and updates boxes layer by layer in a cascade manner. Despite all the progress, none of them treats bipartite graph matching used in the Hungarian loss as the main reason for slow convergence. Sun et al.¬†9 analyzed the impact of Hungarian loss by using a pre-trained DETR as a teacher to provide the GT label assignment for a student model and train the student model. They found that the label assignment only helps the convergence in the early stage of training but does not influence the final performance significantly. Therefore, they concluded that the Hungarian loss is not the main reason for the slow convergence. In this work, we give a different analysis with an effective solution that leads to a different conclusion. We adopt DAB-DETR as the basic detection architecture to evaluate our training method, where the label embedding appended with an indicator is used to replace the decoder embedding part to support label denoising. The difference between our method and other methods is mainly in the training method. In addition to the Hungarian loss, we add a denoising loss as an easier auxiliary task that can accelerate training and boost performance significantly. Chen et al.¬† augments their sequence with synthetic noise objects, but is totally different from our method. They set the targets of noise objects to the ‚Äùnoise‚Äù class (not belonging to any ground-truth classes) so that they can delay the End-of-Sentence (EOS) token and improve the recall. In contrast to their method, we set the target of noised boxes to the original boxes, and the motivation is to bypass bipartite graph matching and directly learn to approximate ground-truth boxes. We are pleased to see that many very recent detection models adopt our proposed denoising training to accelerate convergence for detection and segmentation models, such as DINO [ref]24, Mask DINO 1, Group DETR , and SAM-DETR++ . DINO [ref]24 further develops our denoising training by feeding hard-negative samples and training the model to reject them. Therefore, the proposed Contrastive Denoising (CDN) further improves the performance. Mask DINO 1 extends denoising to three image segmentation tasks (instance, panoptic, and semantic) by reconstructing masks from noised boxes. Group DETR  and SAM-DETR+++ also adopt denoising training in their model to achieve better performance. These models demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capabilities of our methods.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: ground-truth boxes.
