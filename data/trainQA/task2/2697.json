      "content": "Paper Title: The Accuracy and Efficiency of Posit Arithmetic\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPosit Implementations in Hardware. The closest work to ours is PERI, a\nposit-enabled RISC-V core presented in a preprint¬†.\nSimilar to our work, PERI implements a posit unit capable of executing RISC-V F\nextension instructions, presents a similar way to run existing floating-point\nprograms on the posit-enabled processor, and evaluates the processor on an Arty\nA7-100T FPGA. However, we implement our project in the Chisel language to\nintegrate it with the Rocket Chip core, while PERI uses Bluespec System Verilog\nand integrates the unit into the SHAKTI core¬†[ref]15.\nPERI uses two posit formats at the same time. Both are 32-bit in size, with one\nhaving e‚Äãs=2ùëíùë†2es=2 and the other e‚Äãs=3ùëíùë†3es=3. To switch between these two formats,\nPERI introduces a new instruction, F‚ÄãC‚ÄãV‚ÄãT.E‚ÄãSformulae-sequenceùêπùê∂ùëâùëáùê∏ùëÜFCVT.ES. In contrast, our POSAR supports\nmultiple bit-sized posits but uses only one size at a time to keep full\ncompatibility with existing software. We evaluate 8- and 16-bit posits in\naddition to 32-bit posits in this paper. In terms of benchmarking, both PERI and\nwe use k-means, along with the computation of s‚Äãi‚Äãn‚Äã(x)ùë†ùëñùëõùë•sin(x) and eùëíe. We evaluate p‚Äãiùëùùëñpi\ncomputation, matrix multiplication, k nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, and\nsupport vector machine, while PERI is evaluated on JPEG image processing and\nfast Fourier transform. Other works propose incomplete posit arithmetic\nunits¬†    [ref]24.\nSpecifically,  presents a hardware generator\nthat can produce posit adders and multipliers,  presents an\nadder/subtractor,  presents an adder, subtractor, and multiplier,\nwhile  implements conversion of IEEE 754 to/from posit, adder,\nsubtractor, and multiplier. Compared to , [ref]24 also\nimplements a divider. Similar to us,  show\nthat posit unit operating on the same size (e.g. 32 bits) as an IEEE\n754-compliant unit needs slightly more hardware resources. In contrast,\n observes that posit takes significantly more FPGA resources than\nIEEE 754. Posit in Machine Learning. Some works analyze the suitability of using\nposits in ML applications¬†   .  and \npresent Deep Positron, an Deep Neural Network (DNN) accelerator that can run on\nFPGAs, and claim that 8-bit posits can achieve better inference accuracy than\n8-bit floats and integers, while being close to the accuracy of 32-bit IEEE 754\nfloats. In contrast, we find that 8-bit posits almost always produce inaccurate\nresults when compared to both 32-bit posits and IEEE 754 floats. However, we\nacknowledge that we use Cifar-10 dataset for the ML application, whereas Deep\nPositron uses medical low-dimensionality datasets. Johnson¬†\nevaluates multiple numeric formats, including posit, to replace IEEE 754 floats\nin DNNs. Among others, the author shows that 8-bit posits with 1-bit exponents\ncan achieve similar Top-1 accuracy on a Resnet50 model compared to classic\n32-bit floats. In , posits are used to store ML parameters in\nmemory, being converted to classic IEEE 754 floats when computations are\nperformed. The authors claim that posits of smaller size can represent the\nparameters compared to bigger sized IEEE 754 floats, and hence, save up to 36%\nof memory space while less than 1% accuracy loss is exhibited. In contrast, we\nshow that frequent conversions between posit and IEEE 754 formats can lead to\nsignificant accuracy degradation and discuss this in detail in\nSection¬†IV-B. Posit in Scientific Computing. In , the authors\nevaluate the impact of posit on NPB benchmarks using software emulation. As\nexpected, the emulation leads to a much higher execution time of the program\nusing posit compared to the IEEE 754 format running natively on the hardware.\nHowever, the accuracy of 32-bit posit is higher compared to FP32. In\n, the authors show using high-level emulation that\n32-bit posit can achieve better accuracy and (potentially) faster execution\ncompared to the IEEE 754 format on the LINPACK benchmark. In contrast, we use a\nhardware-based approach to better understand the impact of posit on\ncycle-efficiency, not only on accuracy.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: FPGA.
