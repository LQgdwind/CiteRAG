      "content": "Paper Title: Effect of Pre-Training Scale on Intra- and Inter-Domain Full and Few-Shot Transfer Learning for Natural and Medical X-Ray Chest Images\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRe-using models obtained by pre-training on available source datasets to improve learning performance on upcoming target datasets is core idea behind transfer learning. It has a long history in machine learning field   [ref]2 and was also employed already at the very early rise of deep neural networks in the vision domain [ref]3 . Different architectures like AlexNet , OverFeat , and VGG  were pre-trained on supervised tasks using ImageNet-1k, a publicly available natural image dataset that contains about 1.4 Million images and 1000 classes [ref]8 . After pre-training, the resulting models were taken as off-the-shelf generic features reservoirs and re-used by re-training, or fine-tuning, on various downstream target datasets and tasks, including classification, object detection, and segmentation [ref]3 . Importantly, the transfer approach allowed to improve performance on target datasets when compared to training from scratch with randomly initialized weights 0 1. Further, it enabled to train models of good quality also on comparatively small amounts of data, in contrast to large amounts usually required for learning high-quality models when training a deep neural network from scratch. Recent line of work on scaling laws in language modeling 2 and vision demonstrated strong improvement for model’s ability to generalize on unseen test data when increasing model, data, and compute budget scale during the training. In language modeling, very large Transformer networks pre-trained on very large text data have also shown very strong transfer performance on a broad range of novel tasks, compared to pre-trained models of smaller scale 3. In the same line, experimental studies on large-scale pre-training and transfer in image domain found evidence that increasing network model and data size during pre-training results in transfer performance benefits 4 5. The majority of the studies looking at the effect of pre-training scale on transfer deal with the intra-domain scenario scenario, where source and target data are close to each other, often originating from the same domain, being for instance natural images. This raises the question whether the observed positive effect of larger scale will also uphold in the inter-domain transfer scenario when using different types of source and target data that are not so closely related. To address this, we conduct a series of large-scale pre-training and transfer experiments where we vary not only ResNet model 6 4 and dataset size during pre-training, but also the domain of the source and the target datasets, being either natural or medical X-Ray chest images, which allows us to study effect of scale on both intra- and inter-domain transfer. To vary source data scale in natural domain, we take either large ImageNet-1k or much larger ImageNet-21k [ref]8. To vary pre-training data scale for medical X-Ray domain, we combine here, for the first time, large openly available medical X-Ray chest imaging datasets (CheXpert 7, MIMIC-CXR 8, PadChest 9, NIH Chest X-ray14 ) into supersets, with the largest scale comparable to ImageNet-1k. We then transfer to either natural or X-Ray image datasets as target. For transfer, we also vary the operation in either full or few-shot regime, where only few examples per class are shown to the pre-trained models during fine-tuning on a target dataset. As large-scale pre-training requires heavy computational resources, we make use of a state-of-the art supercomputer (JUWELS Booster ) tailored for distributed training to conduct our experiments. The results we obtain show that both intra- and inter-domain transfer benefit from larger pre-training scale. They also reveal a differentiated picture suggesting that effect of larger scale on transfer is expressed differently in intra- and inter-domain scenario and for full shot and few-shot regime. Remarkably, and also of high relevance for practice, we observe that large networks pre-trained on very large generic natural ImageNet-21k are as good or better than networks pre-trained on largest available medical domain-specific X-Ray superset data when performing full shot transfer to large X-Ray targets. This indicates that high quality models for domain specific medical X-Ray targets can be obtained by increasing scale of the network and of the generic natural image data in the pre-training, without relying on large amount of domain-specific data that is often not available in practice. In contrast to previous studies that dealt with smaller scales , we conclude that inter-domain transfer from natural to medical images benefits from substantially larger pre-training scales.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: by pre-training on available source datasets to improve learning performance on upcoming target datasets is core idea behind transfer learning.
