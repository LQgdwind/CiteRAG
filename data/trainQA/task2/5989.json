      "content": "Paper Title: The Metaverse: Survey, Trends, Novel Pipeline Ecosystem & Future Directions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe study in this section the list of enabling technologies that support Hardware development and growth in the market of the virtual world as part of the Metaverse pipeline.\n AI. With the rise of AI applications, its subdomains such as machine and deep learning (ML & DL) have found their way to also being used inside hardware equipment pertaining to Metaverse-related applications such as HMDs. It is worth mentioning that several of the points discussed and highlighted in this section are used in conjunction with each other. For example, when Federated Learning (FL) is used with Metaverse-related hardware, privacy is also applied alongside computing factors. Thus, we can say that many of these criteria are intermingled and work together to provide common goals to the users. For instance, these devices are in need of access control and authentication. Works such as  and [ref]99 use DL techniques for authentication and access control purposes. In , the authors make use of DL to provide better authentication mechanisms for the distorted iris regions in HMDs, while in [ref]99 the authors also make use of different DL techniques for iris recognition. The authors of  leverage the advantages of Neural Networks (NN) and propose a lightweight framework, dubbed as SurgeonAssist-Net, which provides virtual assistance for a predefined set of surgical tasks. The proposed framework can be used on commercially available HMDs such as Microsoft’s Hololens. The authors of , also make use of NNs in HMDs, however, this time, in the domain of speech and sound feedback, especially for the deaf and people with listening difficulties. Their approach relies on Convolutional Neural Nets and is called ’HoloSound’ which utilizes deep learning for classifying and visualizing the identity of the sound and its location alongside providing speech transcription for the users.\n\n User interface and interaction.\nGiven the wearable nature of these devices, the way they are designed and the way the users will interact with them make all the difference in these devices’ usability and adaptability. For example, hardware might be compact in size and have small form factors. To achieve this, the internal components of these devices should be smaller. This is becoming easier to be achieved because semiconductors are also becoming smaller. Furthermore, smaller micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) and compact batteries which have longer-lasting capabilities are also a requirement for designing more user-friendly Metaverse gear . The effects of user interfaces with HMDs are highlighted in , where the authors discuss the impact of various interfaces in the realm of interactive narratives on AR-related hardware such as HMDs. There are several types of interfaces that can be used in AR, such as Natural User Interfaces (NUI), Tangible User\nInterface (TUI), and Graphical User Interfaces (GUI). Providing users with enjoyable interfaces for AR/VR hardware has been the goal of several research works. For example, the authors of  propose an asymmetric interface for HMD (direct interaction) and non-HMD (multi-viewpoint interaction) users that provide a better experience with respect to their virtual reality environment. The authors of  propose a novel collaboration-based interaction method between users wearing HMDs in virtual reality environments. This is achieved through a communication interface that allows the users to exchange information and feedback with their hands and feet. \n Computing & Power. Given HMDs aim to provide more immersive experiences, they render and contain multiple views per instance as opposed to 2D imaging. Accordingly, this requires more computing power from the HMD. The authors of [ref]106 compare the power consumption of HMDs that offer 3D rendered views to traditional 2D views and provide statistical analysis as to which modules of the HMD consume more power and provide a couple of power-saving mechanisms. Since HMDs are getting smaller in size, their components are also becoming smaller in size. Several attempts to ease the burden on the internal components of the HMDs (i.e., CPU, GPU) in terms of computing and rendering are being moved to software-based techniques. For example, the authors of  use foveated rendering which is a method that reduces the rendering computation of the GPU inside a HMD. Besides, the authors of  try to overcome the problem of optical distortions on the level of GPU in real-time using a software-based approach where a distortion map is built to fix the distortion and fix the quality of the images. Finally, in , the authors convert the process of asynchronous time warping (ATW) that reduces the motion-to-photon latency in HMDs into a programmatic one by proposing a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) based approach which handles the temporal quality compensation without the need for any ATWs. \n Security. Just like any network-oriented component, HMDs, and other Metaverse-related hardware and equipment are vulnerable to several security risks. These real-time devices create and capture large amounts of input that can be sensitive. For example, hackers can change the perceived reality and inject poisonous data that can have a detrimental effect on the usability of the AR or VR application, such as the driver’s focus on a road. Other attacks can include displaying falsified information and causing cybersickness . Another important security aspect in Metaverse-related hardware is the issue of authentication. Recently, biometric authentication has come to the surface given its little memory load .\nThe authors of  propose a novel method of authentication for HMDs called ’Oculock’ which is a human visual system (HVS) based approach. The proposal works through an electro-oculography (EOG) driven human visual system sensing framework and fast authenticating scheme in which different physiological and behavioral features, which are extracted to assist in the authentication. In , the authors present a different authentication approach called ’LookUnlock’, which uses passwords made from spatial and virtual targets from the environment. This approach can circumvent shoulder-surfing attacks and provide an additional layer of security for HMD users. Finally, the authors of  use iris and periocular recognition to authenticate users through the HMDs, which capture the eye image. By using score-level fusion for the iris and the periocular regions, the authentication performance is improved. \n Privacy. As these wearables become more ubiquitous and easily affordable commercially, users are more concerned about their privacy during their usage. On the hardware level, unlike other attacks such as the one targeting the application layer, the concern is to keep the low-level code that makes the hardware run safe, secure, and easily available for patches in case of a compromise. Attackers can use hardware-level attacks to take over a device, and later work their way into other layers of the hardware and siphon information. Furthermore, the amount of data captured by these devices makes them interesting platforms to perform different types of learning (i.e., ML, DL). However, these models would entail access to private data. Several works have tried to tackle this issue by proposing the usage of FL  with HMDs. For example, in , the authors propose a new framework that preserves the user’s privacy and uses FL in online viewport prediction in 360-degree streaming. Unlike other learning scenarios, collected and captured data does not leave the HMD towards 3rd party storage for analysis, rather the learning takes place on the HMD. In , the authors also use FL coupled with RL to solve the multi-user AR output strategy problem. In their approach, the RL model gets trained on individual AR devices to produce an output strategy, which is aggregated on federated servers.\n Ethics and Sociopsychology. Various literature efforts have studied the ethical implications of this hardware as they directly interact and intersect with different social, behavioral, and cognitive aspects of humans in general. For example, the authors of  supply an overview of various ethical principles in research especially pertaining to child development. The authors of , also discuss and explore the ethical as well as safety effects of using existing hardware in low-income high schools, especially in information technology and science classes. Moreover, immersive experiences through various AR/VR glasses and HMDs have had social and psychological impacts. For example, the authors of  provide a systematic review regarding the use of HMDs in the education of autistic individuals. Moreover, the authors of , highlight the benefits of performing a virtual field trip using HMDs, against showing parts of the trip in regular 2D videos. The reviews reveal that using immersive experiences via the HMDs has more positive effects in terms of self-efficacy and interest near the students even after a couple of weeks from the experiment. The authors of  examine the effects of VR in the domain of sport psychology practice. Their work discusses some of the practicalities of using VR technologies through HMDs and provides recommendations to stakeholders that work in the domain of sports psychology as to how they can use it in their practice.\n\nReference markers found: [99]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]99: that many of these criteria are intermingled and work together to provide common goals to the users.
