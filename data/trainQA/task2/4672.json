      "content": "Paper Title: Scheduling Algorithms for Federated Learning with Minimal Energy Consumption\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhen FL was originally proposed by McMahan et al. , no special attention was paid to the training time or to the energy consumption of the mobile devices.\nIt is only natural then that no mechanism to control the workload distribution (i.e., how much local data each device should use) was proposed at the time. Wang, Wei, and Zhou [ref]24 propose Fed-LBAP and Fed-MinAvg as mechanisms to control the workload distribution in order to minimize the computation time and accuracy loss when training FL models.\nThey identified the computation time as the main bottleneck for FL.\nThis argument has also been emphasized by others that postulate a decrease on the impact of communication during training with the rise of 5G technologies [ref]4 [ref]20.\nWang, Yang, and Zhou  have later presented an algorithm named MinCost for this same optimization problem.\nWe have previously proposed OLAR  as an optimal greedy solution for minimizing the computation time of FL.\nNonetheless, all of these algorithms help minimize the maximum cost (execution time, in this case), while our energy consumption problem requires the minimization of the total cost (its sum). Outside FL, Khaleghzadeh, Manumachu, and Lastovetsky  introduce a branch-and-bound solution to minimize the computation time when the cost function of each resource (how much time it takes to process a given amount of data) is arbitrary — in other words, they do not follow any specific behavior like being monotonically increasing.\nTheir algorithm has its worst-case complexity in O​(n3​T3)𝑂superscript𝑛3superscript𝑇3O(n^{3}T^{3}) for n𝑛n heterogeneous resources and a workload of size T𝑇T.\nLater, Khaleghzadeh et al.  have adapted this algorithm to optimize both execution time and energy consumption (i.e., find the Pareto front).\nTheir new solution has its time complexity in O​(n3​T3​log⁡(n​T))𝑂superscript𝑛3superscript𝑇3𝑛𝑇O(n^{3}T^{3}\\log(nT)).\nMeanwhile, our focus lies only on energy consumption.\nAs we will show later, our solution for arbitrary cost functions has a time complexity in O​(T2​n)𝑂superscript𝑇2𝑛O(T^{2}n), while the solutions for specific scenarios vary between O​(T​n2)𝑂𝑇superscript𝑛2O(Tn^{2}) and Θ​(n)Θ𝑛\\Theta(n). A constraint in our workload distribution comes in the form of lower and upper limits on the amount of work to be given to each device.\nThese limits play an important role in our problem.\nFor FL, workload is translated into the number of data samples (mini-batches) to be used for training during a round.\nLower limits can be used to enforce device participation at minimum levels (providing different data sources), which could also help with fairness .\nThey also help reduce the time a scheduling algorithm takes to achieve its decisions .\nMeanwhile, upper limits avoid data over-representation from better-performing or more energy-efficient devices .\nThey can be naturally found by considering the amount of data available in a device 8.\nFinally, they can also be used to set contracts with participants and help incentivise their participation in training 9.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: of the mobile devices.\nIt is only natural then that no mechanism to control the workload distribution (i.e., how much local data each device should use) was proposed at the time.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
