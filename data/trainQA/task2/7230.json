      "content": "Paper Title: Autocompletion of Chief Complaints in the Electronic Health Records using Large Language Models This work is funded by Northwestern Mutual Data Science Institute (NMDSI), Milwaukee, WI, USA.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA chief complaint (CC) is a brief statement that explains why a patient is seeing a doctor. It is usually the second thing asked during a medical history after identifying the patient's demographic information . When a patient seeks medical care, their CC is recorded several times. First, when they register at a clinic or emergency department (ED), triage nurses and clerks create a record. Then, clinicians also document the CC in various notes throughout the patient's care, including daily progress notes, discharge notes, transfer notes, and patient acceptance summary notes . The limited time and information available during triage can sometimes result in an oversimplified or inaccurate CC, which may not fully capture the patient's symptoms or concerns. This can potentially impact the diagnostic process, as the treating clinician may not have a complete understanding of the patient's condition and may not order appropriate tests or treatments . In addition, errors in CC's can also occur due to misspelled words, incorrect punctuation, or inaccurate symptom descriptions . The goal of this study is to employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to create an autocompletion tool for CC's in ED settings. A state-of-the-art (SOTA) NLP model may help triage nurses generate accurate CC's more efficiently. This study aims to Explore the potential of NLP techniques for autocompleting CC's in ED settings. This study will involve developing an NLP model capable of generating CC's. This generated CC will not only suggest accurate and well-formatted notes but also provide ideas to improve their notes. Assess the impact of an autocompletion tool on the efficiency and accuracy of triage in ED settings. This study will compare the accuracy of CC's generated with the NLP model to those entered manually by triage healthcare providers. Autocompletion provides word, phrase, or sentence suggestions as a user types. The primary objective of this system is to improve efficiency by reducing the number of keystrokes required, while also elevating the quality of the content by minimizing typographical errors, promoting the adoption of standardized terminology, and facilitating the exploration of a wider range of vocabulary . This process works by analyzing previously entered words to make educated guesses about a subsequent word, phrase, or sentence. To complete a CC automatically, text generation techniques are employed which is one of the primary tasks in Natural Language Generation (NLG). NLG is a specialized area within the discipline of NLP that focuses on the development of systems with the ability to generate both coherent and easily understandable text. NLG is often regarded as a comprehensive term that incorporates a diverse array of tasks involving the transformation of input data into a textual sequence as output. These tasks include generating answers for users in a chatbot, translating languages, suggesting story ideas, or summarizing data analysis. Clinical documents provide distinct issues in comparison to general-domain text due to the extensive utilization of acronyms and non-standard clinical terminology by healthcare professionals, as well as the irregular structure and arrangement of these documents . Although Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPT) models  [ref]8  demonstrate proficiency in generating coherent text for broad subject areas, their effectiveness may diminish when confronted with the complexities inherent in clinical documentation. CC's are free text that consists of one or more improper sentences and medical acronyms 0. General-purpose language models may not be able to capture the context and fail to show exemplary results on CC's. GPT-2 [ref]8 has recently adapted to the bio-medical domain. Biomedical Generative Pretrained Transformers (BioGPT) is such an adaptation that has been trained on a very large corpus of biomedical literature and has shown to work well on many tasks, including text generation 1. Hence, we propose to employ BioGPT for autocompletion of the CC.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: and non-standard clinical terminology by healthcare professionals, as well as the irregular structure and arrangement of these documents .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
