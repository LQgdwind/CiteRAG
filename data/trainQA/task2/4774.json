      "content": "Paper Title: On the Robustness of Deep Clustering Models: Adversarial Attacks and Defenses\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep Clustering. To leverage clustering algorithms on high-dimensional data, early work on deep clustering [ref]7 [ref]6, aimed to learn a latent low-dimensional cluster-friendly representation that could then be clustered on. This task was achieved using AutoEncoders (AEs) [ref]7  , Variational AEs  , or GANs   . More recently, current SOTA deep clustering models employ self-supervised and contrastive learning instead of the earlier AE/GAN based approaches to perform clustering   [ref]9. We consider these in the paper due to their superlative performance. Training-time Adversarial Attacks Against Clustering. Recently, a few works have proposed blackbox adversarial attacks against clustering  . These seek to poison a small number of samples in the input data, so that when clustering is undertaken on the poisoned dataset, other unperturbed samples change cluster memberships. This problem is significantly different from ours– the traditional clustering algorithm retrains on the poisoned input data constituting an attack at training time. For deep clustering, the model does not train again once deployed, so we have to generate adversarial images that the model misclusters at test time. There have also been whitebox attacks proposed for traditional clustering, but these can only be employed for the specific traditional clustering algorithm considered   . Attacks/Defenses in Supervised Learning. The closest attacks to ours in supervised learning are score-based blackbox attacks where the adversary has access to the softmax probabilities outputted by the model . A number of such attacks have been proposed: NES , SPSA , among others. These cannot be applied in their original formulation as the attack optimization expects ground truth reference labels. Even with simple modifications to the loss (such as using predicted labels as ground truth) these attacks do not work as successfully as our proposed GAN attack (refer to Appendix On the Robustness of Deep Clustering Models: Adversarial Attacks and Defenses for a detailed discussion and Appendix On the Robustness of Deep Clustering Models: Adversarial Attacks and Defenses for empirical justification). Similar issues make supervised defenses inapplicable for our setting– defense strategies need to be truly unsupervised to work in the clustering context, and outputs of deep clustering models might not possess a one-to-one mapping with ground truth labels, causing further problems. We provide a more detailed discussion on the inapplicability of these defense methods in Appendix On the Robustness of Deep Clustering Models: Adversarial Attacks and Defenses. Robust Deep Clustering. A natural in-processing defense approach to preventing adversarial attacks on deep neural networks is to utilize some form of adversarial retraining which seeks to jointly optimize an adversarial objective along with the original loss function used to train the network. This technique has been shown to vastly improve the adversarial robustness of traditional deep neural networks  . In the context of deep clustering, to the best of our knowledge, there are two works that aim to make models robust to adversarial noise in this manner555   refer to ”robustness” in their work but their definition is not the traditional notion of adversarial robustness and they do not incorporate adversarial retraining.: RUC [ref]9 and ALRDC . Moreover, RUC is considered to be the SOTA robust deep clustering model. Even in terms of performance metrics (NMI, ACC, ARI) it is second only to the SOTA model SPICE .\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Deep Clustering.
