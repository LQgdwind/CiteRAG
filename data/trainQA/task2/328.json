J. Gibson, 1977 [ref]243 The idea to incorporate functionality and affordance into computer vision and AI can be dated back to the second International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) in 1971, where Freeman and Newell  argued that available structures should be described in terms of functions provided and functions performed. The concept of affordance was later coined by Gibson [ref]243. Based on the classic geometry-based “arch-learning” program , Winston et al.  discussed the use of function-based descriptions of object categories. They pointed out that it is possible to use a single functional description to represent all possible cups, despite there being an infinite number of individual physical descriptions of cups or many other objects. In their “mechanic’s mate” system , Connell and Brady  proposed semantic net descriptions based on 2D shapes together with a generalized structural description. “Chair” and “tool,” exemplary categories researchers used for studies in functionality and affordance, were first systematically discussed alongside a computational method by Ho  and DiManzo et al. , respectively. Inspired by the functional aspect of the “chair” category in Minsky’s book , the first work that uses a purely functional-based definition of an object category (i.e., no explicit geometric or structural model) was proposed by Stark and Bowyer . These early ideas of integrating functionality and affordance with computer vision and AI systems have been modernized in the past decade; below, we review some representative topics. “Tool” is of particular interest in computer vision and robotics, partly due to its nature as an object for changing other objects’ status. Motivated by the studies of tool use in animal cognition, Zhu et al.  cast the tool understanding problem as a task-oriented object-recognition problem, the core of which is understanding an object’s underlying functions, physics, and causality. As shown in Fig. 22 , a tool is a physical object (e.g., a hammer or a shovel) that is used through action to achieve a task. From this new perspective, any object can be viewed as a hammer or a shovel. This generative representation allows computer vision and AI algorithms to reason about the underlying mechanisms of various tasks and generalize object recognition across novel functions and situations. This perspective goes beyond memorizing examples for each object category, which tends to prevail among traditional appearance-based approaches in the literature. Combining both physical and geometric aspects, Liu et al.  took the decomposition of physical primitives for tool recognition and tower stability further. “Container” is ubiquitous in daily life and is considered a half-tool . The study of containers can be traced back to a series of studies by Inhelder and Piaget in 1958 , in which they showed six-year-old children could still be confused by the complex phenomenon of pouring liquid into containers. Container and containment relationships are of particular interest in AI, computer vision, and psychology due to the fact that it is one of the earliest spatial relationships to be learned, preceding other common ones e.g., occlusions  and support relationships ). As early as two and a half months old, infants can already understand containers and containment   . In the AI community, researchers have been adopting commonsense reasoning    and qualitative representation   for reasoning about container and containment relationships, mostly focusing on ontology, topology, first-order logic, and knowledge base. More recently, physical cues and signals have been demonstrated to strongly facilitate reasoning about functionality and affordance in container and containment relationships. For example, Liang et al.  demonstrated that a physics-based simulation is robust and transferable for identifying containers in response to three questions: “What is a container?”, “Will an object contain another?”, and “How many objects will a container hold?” Liang’s approach performed better than approaches using features extracted from appearance and geometry for the same problem. This line of research aligns with the recent findings of intuitive physics in psychology      , and enabled a few interesting new directions and applications in computer vision, including reasoning about liquid transfer  , container and containment relationships , and object tracking by utilizing containment constraints . “Chair” is an exemplar class for affordance; the latest studies on object affordance include reasoning about both geometry and function, thereby achieving better generalizations for unseen instances than conventional, appearance-based, or geometry-based machine learning approaches. In particular, Grabner et al.  designed an “affordance detector” for chairs by fitting typical human sitting poses onto 3D objects. Going beyond visible geometric compatibility, through physics-based simulation, Zhu et al.  inferred the forces/pressures applied to various body parts while sitting on different chairs; see Fig. 23  for more information. Their system is able to “feel,” in numerical terms, discomfort when the forces/pressures on body parts exceed certain comfort intervals. “Human” context has proven to be a critical component in modeling the constraints on possible usage of objects in a scene. In approaching this kind of problem, all methods imagine different potential human positioning relative to objects to help parse and understand the visible elements of the scene. The fundamental reason for this approach is that human-made scenes are functional spaces that serve human activities, whose objects exist primarily to assist human actions [ref]243. Working at the object level, Jiang et al. proposed methods that use human context to learn object arrangement  and object labeling . At the scene level, Zhao and Zhu  modeled functionality in 3D scenes through the compositional and contextual relationships among objects within them. To further explore the hidden human context pervading 3D scenes, Huang et al.  proposed a stochastic method to parse and reconstruct scenes with a  holistic scene grammar (HSG). HSG describes a functional, task-centered representation of scenes. As shown in Fig. 24 , the descriptor was composed of functional scene categories, task-centered activity groups, and individual objects. In a reversal of the process of parsing scenes using human context, scene functionality could also be used to synthesize new scenes with humanlike object arrangements: Qi et al.  and Jiang et al.  proposed using human-centric representations to synthesize 3D scenes with a simulation engine. As illustrated in Fig. 25  , they integrated human activities with functional grouping/support relationships to build natural and fitting activity spaces.\n\nReference markers found: [243]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]243: and label things in order to perceive what they afford …It is never necessary to distinguish all the features of an object and, in fact, it would be impossible to do so.” — J.
