      "content": "Paper Title: Chiplet-Gym: Optimizing Chiplet-based AI Accelerator Design with Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs Large Language Models (LLMs), such as chatGPT, GPT-4, LLaMA , etc.,\ngain widespread use, there is a growing demand for energy-efficient hardware that can deliver high throughput. To support hundreds of trillions of operations and hundreds of Giga Bytes of data movement, the high-performance and energy-efficient\nhardware demands more silicon area, accommodating more\ncompute cores and memory capacity. Training any state-of-the-art AI or Deep Learning (DL) model with a single GPU or accelerator is nearly impossible due to extreme computing and memory demands. The data centers are equipped with clusters of powerful computers and GPUs connected via PCIe, NVLink, etc..\nEven though these supercomputers can deal with large workloads, they consume a significant amount of energy  and involve longer latency. Because off-board communications consume at least one order of magnitude more power and time than any on-package communications [ref]4. The ideal\nscenario would be a hardware capable of housing the\nentire model parameters and intermediate activations on-chip[ref]5, promising optimal performance and energy efficiency. Unfortunately, this is not feasible due to the stagnation of Moore’s law and Dennerd’s scaling, die size reaching the reticle limit, and the prohibitive manufacturing cost and yield limitations. Consequently, researchers endeavor to replicate this ‘hypothetical ideal’ hardware concept by integrating multiple smaller chiplets at the package level, allowing near-ideal performance while minimizing costs and energy consumption. With the advent of advanced packaging technologies, the chiplet-based heterogeneous integration has opened up a new dimension of chip design, More-than-Moore . In chiplet-based system, multiple chiplets (i.e., SoCs) of diverse functionalities (e.g., logic dies, memories, analog IPs, accelerators etc.) and tech nodes (e.g., 7nm or beyond) from different foundries are interconnected in package level using the advanced packaging technologies, such as CoWoS, EMIB,\netc. . The value proposition of chiplet-based architectures is manifold. Compared to multiple monolithic SoCs interconnected via off-package or off-board links such as PCIe, NVLink, CXL etc. , package-level integration of multiple monolithic SoCs via 2.5D or 3D has accelerated performance and lower energy consumption alleviating off-package communications. Chiplet-based systems offer lower RE (Recurrent Engineering) cost by providing higher yield and lower NRE (Non-Recurrent Engineering) by enabling IP reuse and shortening IC design cycle . The commercial chiplet-based general purpose products  [ref]8 are designed and developed at vertically integrated companies without exposing much knowledge about the chiplet-based architectures’ design space. Unlike these general purpose products, chiplet-based AI accelerators demand extensive design space exploration to hit the target Power, Performance, Area, and Cost (PPAC) budget. From architectural perspective, designers must consider the resource allocation, mapping and dataflow of the DNN workloads. From communication and integration perspective, chiplet placement, routing protocols, stacking/packaging technologies, interconnect types, and finally from application perspective, system requirement, such as reliability, scalibility etc., should be considered all at the same time while optimizing for PPAC . The existing works often focus either on the architectural or integration aspects as a separate design flow: explore routing and packaging given chiplets 012\nor explore chiplets architecture given the packaging [ref]534 5.\nAn isolated approach, addressing individual aspects independently, may result in sub-optimal designs due to the inter-dependency among these factors. For instance, varying resource allocation impacts communication demands, influencing the choice of packaging and its configuration, consequently leading to cost variations. Currently, many flavors of packaging technologies, both from 2.5D and 3D, are available from the industry leaders, which makes it difficult for system designers and integrators to choose the optimum set of configurations from the vast design space based on the system requirements . The various packaging technologies differ in fabrication cost and complexity, performance, and underlying integration technologies . As a result, no single package technology can be marked as superior to others. Each of the other domains, such as resource allocation, chiplet granularity, placement, Network on Package (NoP), and interconnect architectures, to name a few, also has an extensive design space. A proper co-optimization across all these domains based on the system and application requirements at the available cost is necessary for a successful chiplet based system design.\nOptimizing all possible domains results in a combinatorial explosion where brute force search is not an option and random search might not result in the optimum point. The expensive simulation environment of chip design exacerbates this problem. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we make the following contributions bridging the gap between the system requirements and design aggregation, planning, and optimization for chiplet-based architecture. We develop a co-design methodology for chiplet-based AI accelerators. The co-design task contemplates resource allocation, such as the number of AI chiplets, memory capacity, and bandwidth; partitioning and placement of chiplets such as aspect ratio of the accelerator chiplet arrays, and logical placement of accelerator and memory chiplet; different packaging technologies (i.e., CoWoS, EMIB, SoIC, and FOVEROS ) and their attributes such as bandwidth, bump pitch density, cost and complexity, to optimize the system-level Power, Performance, Area, and Cost (PPAC) of the chiplet-based AI accelerators. We formulate an analytical cost model for assessing the chiplet-based architectures. This analytical model enables us to assess the chiplet-based AI accelerator in a time-and-resource-constrained environment. To optimize throughput, energy efficiency, and cost, we identify the inter-dependency of the design space parameters and formulate the optimization problem as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem. We also explore non-RL based optimization approaches, such as simulated annealing, and combine these two approaches to ensure the robustness of the optimizer. Finally, we validate our methodology by comparing the performance of our optimized design against state-of-the-art monolithic GPU on MLPerf benchmark and justify the performance improvement. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the background. Section 3 describes the analytical modeling and design space exploration. The optimization framework is presented in section 4 followed by experiments and results in Section 5, related works in Section 6, limitations and future works in Section 7 and conclusion in Section 8.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: consume a significant amount of energy  and involve longer latency.
