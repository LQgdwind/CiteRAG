Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

As the agent improves, the level generator must also improve to generate more complex and harder levels [ref]36 . Most of these methods, however, focus on simple games (such as mazes  or 2D terrains ), making it unclear how to generalise them to more complex games.\nFurthermore, the focus is often on obtaining robust and high-performing artificial agents  instead of generating video game levels to be played and enjoyed by humans. Prioritising the former could lead to overly difficult levels.\nThese levels may also have different characteristics compared to human-designed ones , complicating their use as a substitute for manual content creation.\nLastly, treating the generation process as one large problem may limit the ability of the generator to create levels with enough complexity to challenge the machine learning agent.\nInstead, having multiple generators that solve simpler problems at different levels of abstraction could enable the generation of more complex and larger-scale structures .\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: Recently, PCG has also been used to generate a large number of diverse levels on which machine learning agents can be trained, leading to these agents becoming more robust [ref]34 [ref]35.\nLevel generators and game-playing agents can often work in tandem, where the generator generates levels that challenge the agent.
