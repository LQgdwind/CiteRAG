      "content": "Paper Title: Conditional Generators for Limit Order Book Environments: Explainability, Challenges, and Robustness\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nConditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs) were introduced\nin Mirza and\nOsindero , where they were demonstrated and evaluated\nusing the MNIST dataset of images of handwritten digits.\nIn general, GANs and CGANs have mainly and most prominently been used the\ncontext of image generation tasks, but they have also been explored for\ngenerating a wide variety of other types of data, including tabular\ndata  and time series data .\nImportant early works on GANs include Arjovsky et al.  (who\nintroduced the Wasserstein GAN used by Stock-GAN  and\nLOBGAN ) and Gulrajani et al. 3, who made\nfundamental contributions to improving Wasserstain-GAN training such as gradient\npenalties (used in the training of LOBGAN).\nWhile conditional generators for LOBs have so far used CGANs, other\nimportant types of generative model exist.\nWe briefly mention Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs), which have been\nused to for generating lower-frequency financial data (such as hourly or daily\ndata as opposed to LOB data), e.g., Bühler et al. .\nOther generative model approaches that have been applied to time series include\nnormalizing flows [ref]43 and denoising diffusion\nmodels 5 [ref]42.\nIt is an interesting direction to explore what these other approaches can offer\nfor LOB simulation, although the feature exploitation demonstrated in\nthis paper would likely apply to any conditional model if explicit care to avoid\nit is not taken. We discuss denoising diffusion models further in\nSection 9. Adversarial Reinforcement Learning.\nIn “Robust Adversarial Reinforcement Learning” (RARL), during the training of\nan agent in an RL environment, a second adversarial agent is introduced into the\nenvironment system with opposite rewards, and this adversary is given (limited)\ncontrol over (e.g., the transitions of) the environment  [ref]49.\nThis is closely related to what we propose in Section 9,\nnamely introducing trading agents during CGAN training. Learning to simulate.\nThere are existing works that use RL in order to learn a simulator, such\nas Ruiz et al. .\nHowever, these works tend to look at settings where there is a downstream task\nthat the simulator will be used for, such as image classification, where\naccuracy in that task can be used as a reward function.\nIn our setting, part of the challenge is that our desiderata for our simulator\nare complex and multi-faceted, and to apply RL a key challenge would be design\nof the reward function, and dealing with the fact that it would be a\nmulti-objective problem. For a long time, agent-based models (ABMs) have offered the promise of reactive\nfinancial and economic market simulation.\nHowever, due to a combination of the lack of agent-level historical data, and\nthe intrinsic difficulty of calibrating ABMs, they are not currently a viable\noption for realistic strategy evaluation. ABMs in principle offer reactivity, similar to conditional generative models,\nand in contrast to backtesting (market replay).\nIn real markets the number of agents is\nhuge, and their individual historical actions are not explicit in the historical data, which is anonymous.\nThus, modelling and calibrating agent-based models (not just in finance, but actually in general) is\na serious challenge (see, e.g., Bai et al. , Platt , Lamperti et al. , Platt and Gebbie , Coletta et al. ).\nWhile ABMs have been shown to be useful for investigating structural properties\nof financial markets , they are difficult to use in\npractice for testing trading strategies where a high precision of calibration is\nrequired.\nWe do note that a combination of approaches is possible, for example, where a\nconditional generative model is combined with distinct agents – in this paper we\ninvestigate the case of various single trading agents operating within a CGAN\nenvironment, but one could include more agents in such an environment\nsimultaneously.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: financial data (such as hourly or daily\ndata as opposed to LOB data), e.g., Bühler et al. .\nOther generative model approaches that have been applied to time series include\nnormalizing flows [ref]43 and denoising diffusion\nmodels 5 [ref]42.\nIt is an interesting direction to explore what these other approaches can offer\nfor LOB simulation, although the feature exploitation demonstrated\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
