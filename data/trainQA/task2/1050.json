      "content": "Paper Title: Synthesizing the Unseen for Zero-shot Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets: We extensively evaluate our proposed ZSD method on three popular object detection datasets: MSCOCO 2014 6, ILSVRC Detection 2017  and PASCAL VOC 2007/2012 . For MSCOCO, we use 65/15 seen/unseen split proposed in [ref]19. As argued in [ref]19, this split exhibits rarity and diverseness of the unseen classes in comparison to another 48/17 split proposed in [ref]3.\nWe use 62,300 images for training set and 10,098 images from the validation set for testing ZSD and GZSD. For ILSVRC Detection 2017, we follow the 177/23 seen/unseen split proposed in  that provides 315,731 training images and 19,008 images for testing. For PASCAL VOC 2007/2012, we follow the 16/4 seen/unseen split proposed in  that uses a total of 5,981 images from the train set of 2007 and 2012 and 1,402 images for testing from val+test set of PASCAL VOC 2007. To test the seen detection results, it uses 4,836 images from the test+val set of 2007. For all these datasets, the testing set for ZSD contains at least one unseen object per image. Implementation details: We rescale each image to have the smaller side of 600, 800 and 600 pixels respectively for PASCAL VOC, MSCOCO and ILSVRC Detection datasets. For training our generative module, we consider different anchor bounding boxes with an IoU ‚â•0.7absent0.7\\geq 0.7 as foregrounds, whereas IoU ‚â§0.3absent0.3\\leq 0.3 boxes are considered as background. We ignore other bounding-boxes with an IoU between 0.3 and 0.7, since a more accurate bounding box helps GAN in learning discriminative features. We first train our Faster-RCNN model on seen data for 12 epochs using standard procedure as in 9. Our category classifier œïclssubscriptitalic-œïcls\\phi_{\\texttt{cls}}, and bounding-box regressor œïregsubscriptitalic-œïreg\\phi_{\\texttt{reg}} both have a single fully-connected layer. The trained model is then used to extract visual features corresponding to bounding-boxes of ground-truth seen objects. We then train our generative model to learn the underlying data distribution of the extracted seen visual features. The generator ùêÜùêÜ\\mathbf{G} and discriminator ùêÉùêÉ\\mathbf{D} of our GAN model are simple single-layered neural networks with 4096 hidden units. Through out our experiments, the loss re-weighting hyper-parameters in Eq.¬†1 are set as, Œ±1=1.0,Œ±2=0.1,Œ±3=0.1,Œ±4=1.0formulae-sequencesubscriptùõº11.0formulae-sequencesubscriptùõº20.1formulae-sequencesubscriptùõº30.1subscriptùõº41.0\\alpha_{1}=1.0,\\alpha_{2}=0.1,\\alpha_{3}=0.1,\\alpha_{4}=1.0, using a small held-out validation set. The noise vector ùê≥ùê≥\\mathbf{z} has the same dimensions as the class-semantics vector ùê∞‚àà‚Ñùdùê∞superscript‚Ñùùëë\\mathbf{w}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d} and is drawn from a unit Gaussian distribution with zero mean. We use Œª=10ùúÜ10\\lambda=10 as in 3. For training of our cWGAN model, we use Adam optimizer with learning rate 10‚àí4superscript10410^{-4}, Œ≤1=0.5,Œ≤2=0.999formulae-sequencesubscriptùõΩ10.5subscriptùõΩ20.999\\beta_{1}=0.5,\\beta_{2}=0.999. The loss term ‚ÑíCusubscript‚Ñísubscriptùê∂ùë¢\\mathcal{L}_{C_{u}} is included after first 555 epochs, when the generator ùêÜùêÜ\\mathbf{G} has started to synthesize meaningful features. Once the generative module is trained, we synthesize 300 features for each unseen class, conditioned upon their class-semantics, and use them to train œïclssubscriptitalic-œïcls\\phi_{\\texttt{cls}} for 30 epochs using Adam optimizer. To encode class-labels, unless mentioned otherwise, we use the FastText  embedding vectors learnt on large corpus of non-annotated text. The implementation of the proposed method in Pytorch is available at https://github.com/nasir6/zero_shot_detection Evaluation metrics: Following previous works [ref]19 [ref]3, we report recall@100 (RE) and mean average precision (mAP) with IoU=0.5. We also report per-class average prevision (AP) to study category-wise performance. For GZSD, we report Harmonic Mean (HM) of performances for seen and unseen classes.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: evaluate our proposed ZSD method on three popular object detection datasets: MSCOCO 2014 6, ILSVRC Detection 2017  and PASCAL VOC 2007/2012 .
