      "content": "Paper Title: Enhanced Performance of Pre-Trained Networks by Matched Augmentation Distributions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBoosting the performance of established deep networks is an active research area where methods including custom training [ref]2, employing additional training sets [ref]3, ensemble teacher-student paradigms [ref]4 , architecture modifications, complex learning schedules and data augmentation     strategies have been investigated. However re-training or fine-tuning an existing model with custom settings is not always a possible or preferred solution. This paper’s approach improves performance using a pre-trained network by addressing the discrepancies that exist between training and inference of deep neural networks. For example, during training data augmentation with random crops are generated from the images on which the loss is minimized, whereas, during inference it is conventional to resize an image to a fixed resolution maintaining aspect ratio and then take the central crop to forward pass it through the trained network. In most cases the central crop provides a reasonable coverage of the image and underlying object of interest. However in some cases centrally cropping an image may discard the discriminatory information essential for a good recognition. Fig 1 shows several examples from ILSVRC-2012  validation set where a central crop may result into insufficient coverage of the resized image and especially of the object of interest. One can easily identify two types of categories of images which are at disadvantage due to central cropping: (i) images where the captured object of interest is not in the center of the frame, and (ii) images where longer dimension is significantly larger than the shorter one (more than 2x). In first category, since the object of interest is already at a non-central location, cropping centrally further removes or reduces the discriminatory information essential for the recognition. For example in Fig 1, non-centrally captured objects of interest [row3: mushroom, kangaroo] are either partially covered by the central crop or fully cropped off in more severe cases [row1: roaster, row3: daisy]. In second category, the object of interest is generally laid out along the longer dimension of the image, central copping only captures part of the object and may discard important discriminatory information. For example the heads and tails of the animals imaged in row1 (right) and row2 of Fig 1 are discarded as a result of center cropping and characteristics of these parts could be the discriminatory features that the deep network learned during training. To enhance the coverage of the underlying object of interest, some networks used multiple fixed crops at inference time 0 1, e.g., the original AlexNet 2, used 5 fixed crops (center and 4 corners), plus their horizontal mirrored version for 10 crops at inference. While AlexNet did use multiple crops at inference, it still has a significant difference between training, which has 2048 random variations, and test time which has 5 fixed crop locations. Through an ablation study we demonstrate that while AlexNet’s 5/10 crop strategy may be sufficient for most images, it can still benefit when more random or mirrored random crops are additionally added. Recent work such as FixRes [ref]2, show that a performance gain can be obtained by adjusting resolution so the distribution of object sizes is better matched between training and inference. They accomplish this size-distribution gap by retraining the network. In this paper we content that the size mismatch is only part of the distributional mismatch problem, and that object coverage via crops is also an issue. To remedy the recognition performance, we propose Matched Inference Distributions (MID) which approximates the distribution of training sampling at inference time, and show this improves performance without the need for any retraining. In training, over the multiple epochs the system effectively averages the different sample augmentations. Hence MID combines results by averaging from several augmentations instead of forward passing a single central crop per image. The benefit of using random crops is three fold: (i) it better aligns with augmentation employed during the training of deep networks, (ii) provides good coverage of underlying object of interest, and (iii) it addresses some of the resolution issues identified in FixRes [ref]2. The representations generated for several random crops of an image can be combined at different levels of a deep network. To this end we explore averaging at the levels of deep features, logits and the softmax layer. We found that averaging after deep features and logits results in identical performance whereas averaging at softmax layers results in the best performance. We have investigated our averaging of random crops approach for various modern network families including ResNet 3, EfficientNet 4, and NFNet 5 with up to 2.0% boost in ImageNet-2012 Top-1 validation accuracy. We should note that the performance gain is achieved without requiring any custom training, re-training or fine-tuning of the networks. Since methods focusing on better training strategies  [ref]4 [ref]3 [ref]2 still run inference using a single central crop, they can further benefit from proposed averaging strategy. We should note that batch processing is common in modern deep learning platforms and forward passing multiple crops can by achieved without any significant overhead. For a non-batched processing, forward passing multiple crops directly results in enhanced computations. To address this we suggest an adaptive strategy where the number of random crops are pre-determined as function of input resolution as center cropping may still be sufficient for majority of the test images. Our Contributions Demonstrating that central or simple fixed crops at inference are sub-optimal and that our novel Matched Inference Distribution (MID) approach which uses the same sampling process for data augmentation in both training and inference, results in better performance. Thorough evaluation of several families of modern deep networks to quantify their achievable best performance without any custom training or fine-tuning.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Boosting the performance of established deep networks is an active research area where methods including custom training [ref]2, employing additional training sets [ref]3, ensemble teacher-student paradigms [ref]4 , architecture modifications, complex learning schedules and data augmentation     strategies have been\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
