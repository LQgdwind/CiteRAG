      "content": "Paper Title: Locality Sensitive Hashing for Efficient Similar Polygon Retrieval\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis paper focuses on similarity search between polygons, where we aim to efficiently retrieve polygons with a shape resembling the query polygon. Large image databases are used in many multimedia applications in fields such as computer vision, pattern matching, content-based image retrieval, medical diagnosis and geographical information systems. Retrieving images by their content in an efficient and effective manner has therefore become an important task, which is of rising interest in recent years. When designing content-based image retrieval systems for large databases, the following properties are typically desired: Efficiency: Since the database is very large, iterating over all objects is not feasible, so an efficient indexing data structure is necessary. Human perception: The retrieved objects should be perceptually similar to the query. Invariance to transformations: The retrieval probability of an object should be invariant to translating, scaling, and rotating the object. Moreover, since shapes are typically defined by a time signal describing their boundary, we desire invariance also to the initial point of the boundary parametrization. There are two general methods to define how much two images are similar (or distant): intensity-based (color and texture) and geometry-based (shape).\nThe latter method is arguably more intuitive  but more difficult since capturing the shape is a more complex task than representing color and texture features.\nShape matching has been approached in several other ways, including tree pruning , the generalized Hough transform , geometric hashing  and Fourier descriptors . For an extensive survey on shape matching metrics see Veltkamp and Hagedoorn . A noteworthy distance function between shapes is that of Arkin et al. , which represents a curve using a cumulative angle function.\nApplied to polygons, the turning function (as used by Arkin et al. ) tPsubscript𝑡𝑃t_{P} of a polygon P𝑃P returns the cumulative angle between the polygon’s counterclockwise tangent at the point and the x𝑥x-axis, as a function of the fraction x𝑥x of the perimeter (scaled to be of length 1) that we have traversed in a counterclockwise fashion. The turning function is a step function that changes at the vertices of the polygon, and either increases with left turns, or decreases with right turns (see Figure 2). Clearly, this function is invariant under translation and scale of the polygon. To find similar polygons based on their turning functions, we define the distance Lp​(P,Q)subscript𝐿𝑝𝑃𝑄L_{p}(P,Q) between polygons P𝑃P and Q𝑄Q to be the Lpsubscript𝐿𝑝L_{p} distance between their turning functions tP​(x)subscript𝑡𝑃𝑥t_{P}(x) and tQ​(x)subscript𝑡𝑄𝑥t_{Q}(x). That is The turning function tP​(x)subscript𝑡𝑃𝑥t_{P}(x) depends on the rotation of P𝑃P, and the (starting) point of P𝑃P where we start accumulating the angle. If the polygon is rotated by an angle α𝛼\\alpha, then the turning function tP​(x)subscript𝑡𝑃𝑥t_{P}(x) becomes tP​(x)+αsubscript𝑡𝑃𝑥𝛼t_{P}(x)+\\alpha. Therefore, we define the (rotation invariant) distance Dp↕​(P,Q)subscriptsuperscript𝐷↕𝑝𝑃𝑄D^{\\updownarrow}_{p}(P,Q) between polygons P𝑃P and Q𝑄Q to be the Dp↕subscriptsuperscript𝐷↕𝑝D^{\\updownarrow}_{p} distance between their turning functions tPsubscript𝑡𝑃t_{P} and tQsubscript𝑡𝑄t_{Q}, which is defined as follows If the starting point of P𝑃P is clockwise shifted along the boundary by t𝑡t, the turning function tP​(x)subscript𝑡𝑃𝑥t_{P}(x) becomes tP​(x+t)subscript𝑡𝑃𝑥𝑡t_{P}(x+t). Thus, we define the distance Dp​(P,Q)subscript𝐷𝑝𝑃𝑄D_{p}(P,Q) between polygons P𝑃P and Q𝑄Q to be the Dpsubscript𝐷𝑝D_{p} distance between their turning functions tPsubscript𝑡𝑃t_{P} and tQsubscript𝑡𝑄t_{Q} which is defined as follows The distance Dp​(f,g)subscript𝐷𝑝𝑓𝑔D_{p}(f,g) between two functions f𝑓f and g𝑔g extends f𝑓f to the domain [ref]0 2[ref]0  by defining tP​(x+1)=tP​(x)+2​πsubscript𝑡𝑃𝑥1subscript𝑡𝑃𝑥2𝜋t_{P}(x+1)=t_{P}(x)+2\\pi. The distance metric Dpsubscript𝐷𝑝D_{p} is invariant under translation, rotation, scaling and the selection of the starting point.\nA comprehensive presentation of these distances, as well as a proof that they indeed satisfy the\nmetric axioms appears in . We develop efficient nearest neighbor data structures for functions under these distances and then specialize them to functions which are turning functions of polygons. Since a major application of polygon similarity is content-based image retrieval from large databases (see Arkin et al. ), the efficiency of the retrieval is a critical metric.\nTraditionally, efficient retrieval schemes used tree-based indexing mechanisms, which are known to work well for prevalent distances (such as the Euclidean distance) and in low dimensions. Unfortunately such methods do not scale well to higher dimensions and do not support more general and computationally intensive metrics. To cope with this phenomenon (known as the “curse of dimensionality”), Indyk and Motwani   introduced Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), a framework based on hash functions for which the probability of hash collision is higher for near points than for far points. Using such hash functions, one can determine near neighbors by hashing the query point and retrieving the data points stored in its bucket. Typically, we concatenate hash functions to reduce false positives, and use several hash functions to reduce false negatives. This gives rise to a data structure which satisfies the following property: for any query point q𝑞q, if there exists a neighbor of distance at most r𝑟r to q𝑞q in the database, it retrieves (with constant probability) a neighbor of distance at most c​r𝑐𝑟cr to q𝑞q for some constant c>1𝑐1c>1. This data structure is parameterized by the parameter ρ=log⁡(p1)log⁡(p2)<1𝜌subscript𝑝1subscript𝑝21\\rho=\\frac{\\log(p_{1})}{\\log(p_{2})}<1, where p1subscript𝑝1p_{1} is the minimal collision probability for any two points of distance at most r𝑟r, and p2subscript𝑝2p_{2} is the maximal collision probability for any two points of distance at least c​r𝑐𝑟cr.\nThe data structure can be built in time and space O​(n1+ρ)𝑂superscript𝑛1𝜌O(n^{1+\\rho}), and its query time is O​(nρ​log1/p2⁡(n))𝑂superscript𝑛𝜌subscript1subscript𝑝2𝑛O(n^{\\rho}\\log_{1/p_{2}}(n)) where n𝑛n is the size of the data set.111To ease on the reader, in this paper we suppress the term 1/p11subscript𝑝11/p_{1} in the structure efficiency, and the time it takes to compute a hash and distances between two polygons/functions. For example for polygons with at most m𝑚m vertices (which we call m𝑚m-gons), all our hash computations take O​(m)𝑂𝑚O(m) time, and using Arkin et al.  we may compute distances in O​(m2​log⁡(m))𝑂superscript𝑚2𝑚O(m^{2}\\log(m)) time. The trivial retrieval algorithm based on the turning function distance of Arkin et al. , is to directly compute the distance D2​(P,Q)subscript𝐷2𝑃𝑄D_{2}(P,Q) (or D1​(P,Q)subscript𝐷1𝑃𝑄D_{1}(P,Q)) between the query Q𝑄Q and all the polygons P𝑃P in the database. This solution is invariant to transformations but not efficient (i.e., linear in the size of the database). In this paper, we rely on the turning function distance of Arkin et al.  for p=1,2𝑝12p=1,2, and create the first retrieval algorithm with respect to the turning function distance which is sub-linear in the size of the dataset. To do so, we design and analyze LSH retrieval structures for function distance, and feed the turning functions of the polygons to them.\nOur results give rise to a shape-based content retrieval (a near neighbor polygon) scheme which is efficient, invariant to transformations, and returns perceptually similar results.\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: their turning functions tPsubscript𝑡𝑃t_{P} and tQsubscript𝑡𝑄t_{Q} which is defined as follows The distance Dp​(f,g)subscript𝐷𝑝𝑓𝑔D_{p}(f,g) between two functions f𝑓f and g𝑔g extends f𝑓f to the domain [ref]0 2[ref]0  by defining tP​(x+1)=tP​(x)+2​πsubscript𝑡𝑃𝑥1subscript𝑡𝑃𝑥2𝜋t_{P}(x+1)=t_{P}(x)+2\\pi.
