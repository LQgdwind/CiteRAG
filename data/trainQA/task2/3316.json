      "content": "Paper Title: Solving Dynamic Graph Problems with Multi-Attention Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFigure 1 depicts the temporal encoder architecture. First, input X∈𝐑T×N×D𝑋superscript𝐑𝑇𝑁𝐷X\\in\\mathbf{R}^{T\\times N\\times D} is transformed by a linear transformation to H(0)∈𝐑T×N×Dhsuperscript𝐻0superscript𝐑𝑇𝑁superscript𝐷ℎH^{(0)}\\in\\mathbf{R}^{T\\times N\\times D^{h}}, at fully connected layer 1. Dhsuperscript𝐷ℎD^{h} refers to the hidden dimension of fully connected layer 1. The output from fully connected layer 1 is given to the temporal enoder. The temporal encoder contains a spatial attention, a temporal attention and a fully-connected layer in parallel. H(0)superscript𝐻0H^{(0)} is given as an input to these three layers and the outputs from these layers (HS(1),HT(1),HF(1)superscriptsubscript𝐻𝑆1superscriptsubscript𝐻𝑇1superscriptsubscript𝐻𝐹1H_{S}^{(1)},H_{T}^{(1)},H_{F}^{(1)}) are combined through an integration layer. For simplicity, we only show the first encoding layer in Figure 1, however, several temporal encoders can be stacked by taking the output of first temporal layer H(1)superscript𝐻1H^{(1)} as the input to the second layer, and so on. We denote H(l)superscript𝐻𝑙H^{(l)} as the input to the lt​hsuperscript𝑙𝑡ℎl^{th} temporal encoding layer and H(l+1)superscript𝐻𝑙1H^{(l+1)} as the output from that layer. We denote hi,t(l)superscriptsubscriptℎ𝑖𝑡𝑙h_{i,t}^{(l)} as the hidden representation of node i𝑖i at time t𝑡t in layer l𝑙l. Even though the embedding information along a temporal axis has not been investigated in the field of learning heuristics for combinatorial optimization, this idea has recently emerged in other prediction tasks  [ref]30 . Zheng et. al  uses a neural architecture named STAtt Block which consists of two attention mechanisms and a fixed graph embedding for traffic prediction, while Gangopadhyay et al. [ref]30, and Pareja et al  use an LSTM-based mechanism. Compared to LSTM, attention-based methods are more computationally efficient and have the ability to handle graph based information . Therefore, our proposed temporal encoder, whilst motivated by STAtt Block, differs in several key aspects. First, in our temporal encoder we do not use the fixed graph embedding. This is because in traffic prediction tasks learning happens for a single road network topology, whereas in combinatorial optimizations the input graph topology changes for every training instance. Thus, it is infeasible to learn a separate embedding for every new training instance. Second, in dynamic combinatorial problems, there can be some nodes in X𝑋X whose attributes do not change over time. On the contrary, in traffic prediction attributes such as traffic load or congestion of every node change over time. In the temporal encoder, we introduce the fully connected layer 2 in parallel to temporal attention layer, to handle nodes whose attributes do not change over time. Next, we detail each sub-element in the temporal encoder. Spatial Attention Layer: In a given graph instance, there are dependencies between nodes, and the spatial attention layer is used to encode those dependencies. The spatial attention layer uses the self-attention mechanism introduced by Vaswani et al.. The spatial attention layer considers a list of node features at a given time step as a sequence: HS,t(l)={h1,t(l),h2,t(l),…​hN,t(l)}∈ℝN×Dhsuperscriptsubscript𝐻𝑆𝑡𝑙superscriptsubscriptℎ1𝑡𝑙superscriptsubscriptℎ2𝑡𝑙…superscriptsubscriptℎ𝑁𝑡𝑙superscriptℝ𝑁superscript𝐷ℎH_{S,t}^{(l)}=\\{h_{1,t}^{(l)},h_{2,t}^{(l)},...h_{N,t}^{(l)}\\}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times D^{h}}. The spatial attention uses the same standard parameters named query (w​Sq(l)∈ℝDh×Dk𝑤superscriptsubscript𝑆𝑞𝑙superscriptℝsuperscript𝐷ℎsuperscript𝐷𝑘wS_{q}^{(l)}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D^{h}\\times D^{k}}), key (w​Sq(l)∈ℝDh×Dk𝑤superscriptsubscript𝑆𝑞𝑙superscriptℝsuperscript𝐷ℎsuperscript𝐷𝑘wS_{q}^{(l)}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D^{h}\\times D^{k}}) and value (w​Sq(l)∈ℝDh×Dv𝑤superscriptsubscript𝑆𝑞𝑙superscriptℝsuperscript𝐷ℎsuperscript𝐷𝑣wS_{q}^{(l)}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D^{h}\\times D^{v}}). In this setup, we set Dksuperscript𝐷𝑘D^{k} and Dvsuperscript𝐷𝑣D^{v} to the same dimension as Dhsuperscript𝐷ℎD^{h}. However, the derivations of the paper can be applied even when these values are different. First, we compute the following three projections as below. Then, we compute the scaled dot product between the query and the key projections and use a softmax layer as in Vaswani et al.. Here, αt,i,j∈αtsubscript𝛼𝑡𝑖𝑗subscript𝛼𝑡\\alpha_{t,i,j}\\in\\alpha_{t}, represents the relevance of node j𝑗j to node i𝑖i at time t𝑡t. In a non-complete graph, we can set −∞-\\infty to non-adjacent nodes before computing the softmax value. Finally, we can output the spatial attention for each node with their relevance to others as: By stacking HS,t(l+1)superscriptsubscript𝐻𝑆𝑡𝑙1H_{S,t}^{(l+1)} over the time axis, we get the HS(l+1)superscriptsubscript𝐻𝑆𝑙1H_{S}^{(l+1)} as below. Temporal Attention Layer with fully Connected Layer: In dynamic combinatorial problems, in addition to the dependency between nodes, there is a dependency between node features across different time steps for the same node. To encode such dependencies, the temporal attention layer is introduced. We also note that in some dynamic combinatorial problems, apart from nodes that change over time, there can be some nodes that are not changing over time as well. For example, in Vehicle Routing Problem defined in Section 5.1, the features of the depot node (vehicle starting/loading node) may be fixed while customer node features change over time. Feeding such fixed nodes’ information into the same temporal attention layer will reduce the effectiveness of the learning of dependencies of nodes that are changing over time. To resolve this issue, we introduce a separate fully connected layer. First, we note that there can be U𝑈U number of such fixed nodes and these nodes are represented by the set 𝕌𝕌\\mathbb{U}. Then, from input H(l)superscript𝐻𝑙H^{(l)}, we take HF(l)∈ℝT,U,Dhsuperscriptsubscript𝐻𝐹𝑙superscriptℝ𝑇𝑈superscript𝐷ℎH_{F}^{(l)}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{T,U,D^{h}} which only contains the nodes with fixed features. In the fully connected layer, we apply a linear transformation for HF(l)superscriptsubscript𝐻𝐹𝑙H_{F}^{(l)} to get HF(l+1)superscriptsubscript𝐻𝐹𝑙1H_{F}^{(l+1)}. Then, in the temporal attention layer, we select the nodes that are changing over time and represent them as HT(l)∈ℝT×N−U×Dhsuperscriptsubscript𝐻𝑇𝑙superscriptℝ𝑇𝑁𝑈superscript𝐷ℎH_{T}^{(l)}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{T\\times N-U\\times D^{h}}. Similar to the spatial attention layer, we consider a sequence, but now in temporal dimension for each node i𝑖i as HT,i(l)={hi,1(l),hi,2(l),…​hi,T(l)}∈ℝT×Dhsuperscriptsubscript𝐻𝑇𝑖𝑙superscriptsubscriptℎ𝑖1𝑙superscriptsubscriptℎ𝑖2𝑙…superscriptsubscriptℎ𝑖𝑇𝑙superscriptℝ𝑇superscript𝐷ℎH_{T,i}^{(l)}=\\{h_{i,1}^{(l)},h_{i,2}^{(l)},...h_{i,T}^{(l)}\\}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{T\\times D^{h}}, where node i∉𝕌𝑖𝕌i\\notin\\mathbb{U}. The temporal attention uses the same standard parameters named query (w​Tq(l)∈ℝDh×Dh𝑤superscriptsubscript𝑇𝑞𝑙superscriptℝsuperscript𝐷ℎsuperscript𝐷ℎwT_{q}^{(l)}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D^{h}\\times D^{h}}), key (w​Tq(l)∈ℝDh×Dh𝑤superscriptsubscript𝑇𝑞𝑙superscriptℝsuperscript𝐷ℎsuperscript𝐷ℎwT_{q}^{(l)}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D^{h}\\times D^{h}}) and value (w​Tq(l)∈ℝDh×Dh𝑤superscriptsubscript𝑇𝑞𝑙superscriptℝsuperscript𝐷ℎsuperscript𝐷ℎwT_{q}^{(l)}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D^{h}\\times D^{h}}). First, we compute the following three projections as below: Then, we compute the scaled dot product between the query and the key projections like in the spatial attention layer. Here, βi,ta,tb∈βisubscript𝛽𝑖subscript𝑡𝑎subscript𝑡𝑏subscript𝛽𝑖\\beta_{i,t_{a},t_{b}}\\in\\beta_{i}, represents the relevance of the node features at time tbsubscript𝑡𝑏t_{b} to the node features at tasubscript𝑡𝑎t_{a} for node i𝑖i. In contrast to the spatial attention, we do not use the masking and assume all time steps are connected. The temporal attention layer outputs HT,i(l+1)superscriptsubscript𝐻𝑇𝑖𝑙1H_{T,i}^{(l+1)}, for each node as below. By stacking HT,i(l+1)superscriptsubscript𝐻𝑇𝑖𝑙1H_{T,i}^{(l+1)} for nodes that are changing over time, we compute HT(l+1)superscriptsubscript𝐻𝑇𝑙1H_{T}^{(l+1)} as below. Finally, the outputs from the temporal attention layer and the fully connected layer are concatenated to get the final temporal embedding representation. Remark: The factorization of the temporal attention layer with the fully connected layer can be extended to multiple parallel layers as well. Suppose one knows how the nodes evolve over time according to some underlying distributions, then more than one temporal attention layer and more than one fully connected layer can be applied. Of course, how one may gain such knowledge on the existence of different distributions and the decision on the number of layers is beyond the scope of this paper and may be investigated in future research. Multi-head Attention: As suggested by Vaswani et al., using more than one attention head (a.k.a. multi-head attention) improves the stabilization of the learning process. In multi-head attention, Dksuperscript𝐷𝑘D^{k} and Dvsuperscript𝐷𝑣D^{v} defined above will be equal to Dh/Msuperscript𝐷ℎ𝑀D^{h}/M, where M𝑀M is the number of attention heads. The final output will contain M𝑀M number of embeddings with a dimension of ℝN×Dh/Msuperscriptℝ𝑁superscript𝐷ℎ𝑀\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times D^{h}/M} and these M𝑀M embeddings can be concatenated or projected through another weight vector to get a representation of shape ℝN×Dhsuperscriptℝ𝑁superscript𝐷ℎ\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times D^{h}}.\nBoth the temporal and spatial attention layers use the multi-head attention mechanism. Integration Layer: Once we learned the spatial representation (HS(l+1)superscriptsubscript𝐻𝑆𝑙1H_{S}^{(l+1)}) and the temporal representation (HT​F(l+1)superscriptsubscript𝐻𝑇𝐹𝑙1H_{TF}^{(l+1)}), we need to learn how to combine these two representations. First, we concatenate both HS(l+1)superscriptsubscript𝐻𝑆𝑙1H_{S}^{(l+1)} and transposed HT​F(l+1)superscriptsubscript𝐻𝑇𝐹𝑙1H_{TF}^{(l+1)} which results in a shape of ℝT×N×2∗Dhsuperscriptℝ𝑇𝑁2superscript𝐷ℎ\\mathbb{R}^{T\\times N\\times 2*D^{h}}. Then, we use a linear transformation with a weight vector w​I∈ℝDh×2∗Dh𝑤𝐼superscriptℝsuperscript𝐷ℎ2superscript𝐷ℎwI\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D^{h}\\times 2*D^{h}} and use a sigmoid activation layer. Finally, H(l+1)superscript𝐻𝑙1H^{(l+1)} is given to the next layer l+1𝑙1l+1 in the temporal encoder. Our integration layer is much simpler compared to the layer proposed in STAtt Block , but yields similar performance. The integration layer output is designed in a way that for a given node i𝑖i at time t𝑡t, integration layer accounts for both the impact from surrounding nodes as well the previous and the future time variants of node i𝑖i.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: embedding information along a temporal axis has not been investigated in the field of learning heuristics for combinatorial optimization, this idea has recently emerged in other prediction tasks  [ref]30 .
