      "content": "Paper Title: Tight Approximation Algorithms for Two-dimensional Guillotine Strip Packing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTwo-dimensional packing problems form a fundamental research area\nin combinatorial optimization, computational geometry, and approximation\nalgorithms. They find numerous practical applications in logistics\n, cutting stock , VLSI\ndesign , smart-grids [ref]21, etc. The\nStrip Packing problem (SP), a generalization of the classical\nBin Packing problem and also the makespan minimization problem\non identical machines, is one of the central problems in this\narea. We are given an axis-aligned vertical half-strip [0,W]×[0,∞)0𝑊0[0,W]\\times[0,\\infty)\nand a set of n𝑛n axis-aligned rectangles (also called items)\nI:={1,2,…,n}assign𝐼12…𝑛I:=\\{1,2,\\dots,n\\}, where for each rectangle i𝑖i we are given an integral width 0​p​ti≤W0𝑝subscript𝑡𝑖𝑊0pt_{i}\\leq W,\nand an integral height hisubscriptℎ𝑖h_{i}; we assume the rectangles\nto be open sets. The goal is to pack all items such that the maximum\nheight of the top edge of a packed item is minimized. The packing needs to be\nnon-overlapping, i.e., such a packing into a strip of height\nH𝐻H maps each rectangle i∈I𝑖𝐼i\\in I to a new translated open rectangle\nR​(i):=(l​e​f​t​(i),r​i​g​h​t​(i))×(b​o​t​t​o​m​(i),t​o​p​(i))assign𝑅𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑖𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑖𝑡𝑜𝑝𝑖R(i):=(left(i),right(i))\\times(bottom(i),top(i)) where\nr​i​g​h​t​(i)=l​e​f​t​(i)+0​p​ti𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑖0𝑝subscript𝑡𝑖right(i)=left(i)+0pt_{i}, t​o​p​(i)=b​o​t​t​o​m​(i)+hi𝑡𝑜𝑝𝑖𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑖subscriptℎ𝑖top(i)=bottom(i)+h_{i}, l​e​f​t​(i)≥0𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑖0left(i)\\geq 0, b​o​t​t​o​m​(i)≥0𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑖0bottom(i)\\geq 0, r​i​g​h​t​(i)≤W𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖𝑊right(i)\\leq W, t​o​p​(i)≤H𝑡𝑜𝑝𝑖𝐻top(i)\\leq H\nand for any i,j∈I𝑖𝑗𝐼i,j\\in I, we must have R​(i)∩R​(j)=∅𝑅𝑖𝑅𝑗R(i)\\cap R(j)=\\emptyset.\nWe assume that items are not allowed to be rotated. The best known polynomial time approximation algorithm for SP has\nan approximation ratio of (5/3+ε53𝜀5/3+\\varepsilon) for any constant ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0 \nand a straight-forward reduction from Partition shows that\nit is 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hard to approximate the problem with a ratio\nof (3/2−ε)32𝜀(3/2-\\varepsilon) for any ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0. Maybe surprisingly, one can\napproximate SP better in pseudo-polynomial time: there is a pseudo-polynomial\ntime (5/4+ε)54𝜀(5/4+\\varepsilon)-approximation algorithm  and it\nis 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hard to obtain a (5/4−ε)54𝜀(5/4-\\varepsilon)-approximation algorithm\nwith this running time . Hence, it remains open\nto close the gap between (5/3+ε)53𝜀(5/3+\\varepsilon) and (3/2−ε)32𝜀(3/2-\\varepsilon) for polynomial\ntime algorithms, and even in pseudo-polynomial time, there can be no\n(1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-approximation for the problem for arbitrarily small ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0. SP is particularly motivated from applications in which we want\nto cut out rectangular pieces of a sheet or stock unit of raw material,\ni.e., metal, glass, wood, or, cloth, and we want to minimize the amount\nof wasted material. For cutting out these pieces in practice, axis-parallel\nend-to-end cuts, called guillotine cuts, are popular due\nto their simplicity of operation . In this context, we look for solutions to cut out the\nindividual objects by a recursive application of guillotine cuts that\ndo not intersect any item of the solution.\nApplications of guillotine cutting are found in crepe-rubber mills , glass industry , paper cutting [ref]36, etc.\nIn particular, this motivates studying geometric packing problems\nwith the additional constraint that the placed objects need to be\nseparable by a sequence of guillotine cuts (see Figure 1). Starting from the classical work by Christofides et al.  in 1970s, settings with such guillotine\ncuts are widely studied in the literature        .\nIn fact, many heuristics for guillotine packing have been developed to efficiently solve benchmark instances, based on tree-search, branch-and-bound, dynamic optimization, tabu search, genetic algorithms, etc. Khan et al. [ref]33 mentions “a staggering number of recent experimental papers” on guillotine packing and lists several such recent experimental papers. A related notion is k𝑘k-stage packing, originally introduced by Gilmore and Gomory .\nHere, each stage consists of either vertical or horizontal guillotine cuts (but not both). In\neach stage, each of the pieces obtained in the previous stage is considered separately\nand can be cut again by using either horizontal or vertical guillotine cuts. In k𝑘k-stage packing,\nthe number of cuts to obtain each rectangle from the initial packing is at most k𝑘k, plus an\nadditional cut to trim (i.e., separate the rectangles itself from a waste area). Intuitively, this\nmeans that in the cutting process we change the orientation of the cuts k−1𝑘1k-1 times. Therefore, in this paper, we study the Guillotine Strip Packing\nproblem (GSP). The input is the same as for SP, but we require\nadditionally that the items in the solution can be separated by a\nsequence of guillotine cuts, and we say then that they are guillotine\nseparable. Like general SP without requiring the items to be guillotine\nseparable, GSP generalizes Bin Packing (when all items\nhave the same height) and makespan minimization on identical machines\n(when all items have the same width). Thus, it is strongly 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hard,\nand the same reduction from Partition mentioned above yields\na lower bound of (3/2−ε)32𝜀(3/2-\\varepsilon) for polynomial time algorithms (see Appendix E for more details).\nFor asymptotic approximation, GSP is well understood.\nKenyon and Rémila  gave an asymptotic polynomial time approximation scheme (APTAS)\nfor (general) SP. Their algorithm produces a 5-stage packing (hence, guillotine\nseparable), and thus yields an APTAS for GSP as well.\nLater, Seiden et al.  settled the asymptotic approximation status of GSP under k𝑘k-stage packing.\nThey gave an APTAS for GSP using 4-stage guillotine cuts, and showed\nk=2𝑘2k=2 stages cannot guarantee any bounded asymptotic performance ratio, and k=3𝑘3k=3 stages lead to\nasymptotic performance ratios close to 1.6911.6911.691.\nHowever, in the non-asymptotic setting, approximation ratio of GSP is not yet settled.\nSteinberg’s algorithm  yields a 2-approximation algorithm\nfor GSP and this is the best known polynomial time approximation algorithm for the problem. In this paper we present approximation algorithms for GSP which\nhave strictly better approximation ratios than the best known algorithms\nfor SP, and in the setting of pseudo-polynomial time algorithms\nwe even beat the lower bound that holds for SP. Moreover, we show\nthat all our approximation ratios are essentially the best possible.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: research area\nin combinatorial optimization, computational geometry, and approximation\nalgorithms.
