      "content": "Paper Title: CiFlow: Dataflow Analysis and Optimization of Key Switching for Homomorphic Encryption\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we briefly introduce the CKKS HE scheme , including its key parameters and operations, using terminology from ARK and Castro [ref]19 when applicable. Unlike prior HE schemes, BGV  and BFV , CKKS operates on vectors of real or complex numbers, rather than integers. To perform these operations, a vector message, 𝐦𝐦\\mathbf{m}, is first encoded into a plaintext polynomial RQ=ℤQ​[X]/(XN+1)subscript𝑅𝑄subscriptℤ𝑄delimited-[]𝑋superscript𝑋𝑁1R_{Q}=\\mathbb{Z}_{Q}[X]/(X^{N}+1), represented as [𝙿]delimited-[]𝙿[\\mathtt{P}]. In essence, this is another vector of length N𝑁N, with each element being an integer no larger than Q. Depending on a problem’s complexity, the value of N𝑁N typically ranges from 211superscript2112^{11} to 217superscript2172^{17}, while Q𝑄Q can range from hundreds to thousands of bits. For a polynomial with N𝑁N coefficients, a vector message must be of length n≤N/2𝑛𝑁2n\\leq\\nicefrac{{N}}{{2}}. A ciphertext, [[𝐦]]delimited-[]delimited-[]𝐦[\\![\\mathbf{m}]\\!], consists of a pair of polynomials, (C0,C1)subscript𝐶0subscript𝐶1(C_{0},C_{1}), where one polynomial contains the message with a small amount of random noise added to it to ensure the security of the RWLE scheme. For efficiency, ciphertexts are decomposed into an equivalent RNS representation 1 consisting of many smaller, machine-word size moduli, qisubscript𝑞𝑖q_{i}, such that Rq0×Rq1×…×Rqℓ=RQsubscript𝑅subscript𝑞0subscript𝑅subscript𝑞1…subscript𝑅subscript𝑞ℓsubscript𝑅𝑄R_{q_{0}}\\times R_{q_{1}}\\times\\ldots\\times R_{q_{\\ell}}=R_{Q}. Each small moduli typically ranges from 363636 to 646464 bits 2, with larger moduli being more robust to accumulated noise. We can think of the RNS representation as an N×ℓ𝑁ℓN\\times\\ell matrix, with ℓℓ\\ell being the number of levels or towers in the current ciphertext. CKKS supports several arithmetic operations like addition and multiplications between plaintext polynomials or ciphertexts. Additions and multiplications are simple point-wise operations between coefficients and therefore require the same number of levels in both operands. CKKS also supports rotations that cyclically rotates elements within the vector message by a specified amount, r𝑟r. Notably, indexing vector elements is not efficiently supported and therefore ciphertext rotations are the primary way of computing fully connected layers and convolutions in neural networks. Rotations and multiplications transform the ciphertext so that it cannot be decrypted by the original secret key, s𝑠s. As a result, an auxiliary process known as “key-switching” is required, which is described in detail in the following section. This operation involves many NTTs, which are analogous to FFTs. A naive key-switching implementation can have poor operational intensity and bottleneck many practical applications. For example, recent work shows nearly 70% of execution time is spent performing key-switching operations for ResNet-20 [ref]18.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: In this section, we briefly introduce the CKKS HE scheme , including its key parameters and operations, using terminology from ARK and Castro [ref]19 when applicable.

To perform these operations, a vector message,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
