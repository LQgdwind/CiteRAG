      "content": "Paper Title: Compromising the Intelligence of Modern DNNs: On the Effectiveness of Targeted RowPress\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe adopt a standard practical threat model similar to prior works leveraging remote side-channel attacks to compromise DNN performance  [ref]40 [ref]8  [ref]9   . We assume that DNN model inference takes place in a resource-sharing environment as in the Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS)  setting. The attacker can run user-level un-privileged processes remotely on the same machine where the victim DNN model is deployed. The attacker can map the virtual addresses to physical addresses using several techniques such as leveraging huge page support, hardware-based side-channel attack , and memory messaging . The attacker requires knowledge of the DRAM memory addressing scheme, which can be obtained via reverse-engineering . We assume the attacker can engender targeted bit-flips at desired locations using fast and precise multi-bit-flip techniques  that ensure the correct hammering patterns for RowHammer or keep a targeted row open for RowPress. Nevertheless, we assume the kernel and operating system are trusted and well-protected . Also following standard practices, we assume ECC does not protect the commercial DRAM and cannot protect large-scale deep learning models against RowHammer  [ref]40, i.e., the attacker can bypass the tracking algorithm and prevent the triggering of refresh operations. Finally, we assume a white-box attacker for deep learning models, following earlier works on adversarial weight attacks [ref]9 [ref]8   . Recent remote side-channel attacks have made this white-box threat model assumption practical, as attackers can now effectively obtain critical information such as the number of layers, layer sizes, weight bit sizes, and parameter values through remote side-channel methods    [ref]40. However, the attacker does not have access to training information such as datasets, hyperparameters, etc.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: We adopt a standard practical threat model similar to prior works leveraging remote side-channel attacks to compromise DNN performance  [ref]40 [ref]8  [ref]9   .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
