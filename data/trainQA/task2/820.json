      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Unbiased Representations via Rényi Minimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn order to assess this fairness definition in the continuous case, it is essential to look at the concepts and measures of statistical dependence. Simple ways of measuring dependence are Pearson’s rho, Kendall’s tau or Spearman’s rank. Those types of measure have already been used in fairness, with the example of mitigating the conditional covariance for categorical variables . However, the major problem with these measures is that they only capture a limited class of association patterns, like linear or monotonically increasing functions. For example, a random variable with standard normal distribution and its cosine (non-linear) transformation are not correlated in the sense of Pearson. Over the last few years, many non-linear dependence measures have been introduced like the Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (KCCA) [ref]21, the Distance or Brownian Correlation (dCor) , the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC and CHSIC)  [ref]37 or the Hirschfeld-Gebelein-Rényi (HGR) [ref]39. Comparing those non-linear dependence measures , the HGR coefficient seems to be an interesting choice: it is a normalized measure which is capable of correctly measuring linear and non-linear relationships, it can handle multi-dimensional random variables and it is invariant with respect to changes in marginal distributions.\n For two jointly distributed random variables U∈𝒰𝑈𝒰U\\in\\mathcal{U} and V∈𝒱𝑉𝒱V\\in\\mathcal{V}, the Hirschfeld-Gebelein-Rényi maximal correlation is\ndefined as: where ρ𝜌\\rho is the Pearson linear correlation coefficient 111A link to our python code is available here: https://github.com/fairness-adversarial/unbiased_representations_renyi.ρ​(U,V)𝜌𝑈𝑉\\rho(U,V) := C​o​v​(U;V)σU​σV𝐶𝑜𝑣𝑈𝑉subscript𝜎𝑈subscript𝜎𝑉\\frac{Cov(U;V)}{\\sigma_{U}\\sigma_{V}}, where C​o​v​(U;V)𝐶𝑜𝑣𝑈𝑉Cov(U;V), σUsubscript𝜎𝑈\\sigma_{U} and σVsubscript𝜎𝑉\\sigma_{V} are the covariance between U𝑈U and V𝑉V, the standard deviation of U𝑈U and the standard deviation of V𝑉V, respectively. with some measurable functions f𝑓f and g𝑔g with positive and finite variance. The HGR coefficient is equal to 0 if the two random variables are independent. If they are strictly dependent the value is 1. The spaces for the functions f𝑓f and g𝑔g are infinite-dimensional. This property is the reason why the HGR coefficient proved difficult to compute. Several approaches rely on Witsenhausen’s linear algebra characterization   to compute the HGR coefficient. For discrete features, this characterization can be combined with Monte-Carlo estimation of probabilities  , or with kernel density estimation (KDE)  to compute the HGR coefficient. We will refer to this second metric, in our experiments, as HGR_KDE. Note that this metric can be extended to the continuous case by discretizing the density computation.\nAnother way to approximate this coefficient, Randomized Dependence Coefficient (RDC) , is to require that f𝑓f and g𝑔g belong to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) and take the largest canonical correlation between two sets of copula random projections. We will make use of this approximated metric as HGR_RDC. Recently a new approach  proposes to estimate the HGR by deep neural network. The main idea is to use two inter-connected neural networks to approximate the optimal transformation functions f𝑓f and g𝑔g from 1. The H​G​RΘ​(U,V)𝐻𝐺subscript𝑅Θ𝑈𝑉HGR_{\\Theta}(U,V) estimator is computed by considering the expectation of the products of standardized outputs of both networks (f^wfsubscript^𝑓subscript𝑤𝑓\\hat{f}_{w_{f}} and g^wgsubscript^𝑔subscript𝑤𝑔\\hat{g}_{w_{g}}). The respective parameters wfsubscript𝑤𝑓w_{f} and wgsubscript𝑤𝑔w_{g} are updated by gradient ascent on the objective function to maximize: J​(wf,wg)=E​[f^wf​(U)​g^wg​(V)]𝐽subscript𝑤𝑓subscript𝑤𝑔𝐸delimited-[]subscript^𝑓subscript𝑤𝑓𝑈subscript^𝑔subscript𝑤𝑔𝑉J(w_{f},w_{g})=E[\\hat{f}_{w_{f}}(U)\\hat{g}_{w_{g}}(V)]. This estimation has the advantage of being estimated by backpropagation, the same authors therefore present a bias mitigation via a min-max game with an adversarial neural network architecture. However, this attenuation is performed on the predictor output only. Several recent papers   have shown that performing the attenuation on a representation tends to give better results in terms of prediction accuracy while remaining fair in complex real-world scenarios. In this work, we are interested in learning fair representations via this Renyi estimator.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: transformation are not correlated in the sense of Pearson.
