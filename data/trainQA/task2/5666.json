      "content": "Paper Title: LaSER: Language-Specific Event Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEvent and entity recommendation are critical tasks facilitating vital applications such as web navigation and exploratory research of a topic of user interest . Finding relevant events is an increasingly difficult task in the global digital world, where event relevance is highly dependent on the language context of the users and their information needs. However, state-of-the-art event and entity recommendation approaches typically neglect this relevance dimension and provide results that do not adequately consider event-specific properties and language context. Table 1 provides examples of events particularly relevant to the Coronavirus pandemic from the perspective of the German, Italian, and Spanish-speaking audience on Wikipedia. This example is created based on the number of clicks in the Wikipedia Clickstream dataset [ref]2 that provides the click-through rates for the Wikipedia articles in the respective Wikipedia language edition.\nAs we can observe, according to the clickstream, German Wikipedia users are mainly interested in the Coronavirus outbreaks in the German-speaking countries and the recession caused by the pandemic. Italian users are mainly interested in the pandemic in Italy and the SARS outbreak, a similar event in 2002, followed by the development in the US. The Spanish Wikipedia reflects user interests in several Spanish-speaking countries, such as Argentine, the US, and Colombia. These observations illustrate how event relevance varies based on the language-specific user context. In this article, we present the new task of language-specific event recommendation.\nThis task adds two critical dimensions to entity recommendation: (i) recommendation of events of societal importance, including political elections, military conflicts and sports events and (ii) the language-specific context of these events.\nThese dimensions are essential in various application scenarios, including event recommendation in information retrieval, event analytics to understand cultural viewpoints  and perception of events in different cultures [ref]4. Language-specific event recommendations open up new web navigation and exploratory search opportunities and can assist users in researching events relevant to a topic in specific languages. Examples include historians researching the Second World War in different countries and journalists exploring the perception of the Coronavirus pandemic in different language communities. Language-specific event recommendations\ncan help address such information needs and provide recommendations that better fit users’ interests and linguistic backgrounds. The most relevant task addressed in the literature in the context of this article is entity recommendation, typically defined as the problem of suggesting entities relevant in a particular context, mostly provided as an entity of interest . Entity recommendation has been tackled from different perspectives, including time-aware entity recommendation  and personalized recommendation of social events . Focusing on the language-specific event recommendation, we add novel dimensions to this task. We go beyond existing approaches that do not consider language-specific aspects and mainly optimize for entity popularity in general. Furthermore, in contrast to existing work, we train our model on publicly available data instead of relying on proprietary click or search logs typically used in the literature (e.g., , ), enhancing the reproducibility of our results. In this article, we present LaSER – a new method for Language-Specific Event Recommendation. Given a query entity of user interest (e.g., a person like Winston Churchill, an event like Coronavirus pandemic, or a concept like Film Festival) and a language of interest, LaSER returns a list of events relevant to the query entity and the language community. With LaSER, we tackle two key challenges of the language-specific event recommendation: The creation of methods for language-specific event recommendation requires consideration of the language context,\nincluding latent properties of events and their relations in this context, along with the spatial and temporal dimensions.\nTo the best of our knowledge, language-specific context has not been considered in state-of-the-art entity recommendations. Training and evaluation of the models for language-specific event recommendation require corpora reflecting events users consider relevant in the specific language context. However, existing corpora do not contain information regarding language-specific user needs. Furthermore, datasets used for training recommendation models are often proprietary (e.g., the Yahoo! search logs  and Baidu Web search engine logs ). Recommendation methods based on such proprietary corpora are barely reproducible. To tackle these challenges in LaSER, we derive and utilize event-specific and language-specific characteristics and include them in a language-specific recommendation model (C1), use freely available datasets, and collect high-quality user relevance judgments (C2).\nLaSER is based on language-specific latent representations (embeddings) of entities and events in a language-specific knowledge graph representing the relevance of entity and event relations in different language contexts.\nWe combine these latent representations with spatio-temporal event features and utilize them for training a learning to rank (LTR) model. Given a language of interest and a query entity, this model generates a ranked list of relevant events. We train the model using the publicly available Wikipedia Clickstream. We evaluate the effectiveness of LaSER in two different setups. First, we evaluate the LaSER ability to predict language-specific clicks between entities and events in the Wikipedia Clickstream.\nThe results demonstrate that our model outperforms link-based, embedding-based and graph attention network based ranking baselines by over 888 (nDCG@10) and 171717 (MAP@10) percentage points on average.\nSecond, we conduct a user study to evaluate the relevance of recommended events and analyze different relevance criteria. The results confirm that LaSER outperforms the baselines by up to 333333 percentage points in MAP@5 concerning the language-specific relevance. We make our source code and data publicly available to facilitate reproducibility of the results and their reuse by the research community111Code: https://github.com/saraabdollahi/LaSER, \nData: https://zenodo.org/record/5735580. Contributions. In summary, our contributions presented in this article are as follows: We define the new task of language-specific event recommendation.\nThis task is different from the existing recommendation tasks that focus on the individual user preferences, provide language-independent recommendations, and do not focus on the language-specific relevance and event characteristics. We represent the language-specific context through a set of novel features, including spatio-temporal event information, language-specific link data, and publicly available clickstream data that serve as target labels.\nWe blend these features into an architecture for language-specific event recommendations. This architecture relies on the language-specific entity and event embeddings for candidate retrieval and an established learning to rank model. We propose novel language-specific embeddings where latent entity representations reflect their neighborhoods and relations in a language-specific knowledge graph and demonstrate that they are beneficial for the candidate generation. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world data and a user study and demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation methods. The remainder of this article is structured as follows: First, we define the task of language-specific event recommendation in Section 2. We present our proposed approach in Section 3 and introduce datasets used as background knowledge in Section 4.\nFollowing that, in Section 5 we describe our evaluation aims and setup.\nSections 6, 7 and 8 present the results of the ranking evaluation and a user study and discuss anecdotal results and application scenarios.\nSection 9 provides an overview of related work. Finally, we provide a conclusion in Section 10.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: pandemic from the perspective of the German, Italian, and Spanish-speaking audience on Wikipedia.
