Instead we have chosen to highlight a modicum of references directly relevant to our work. The major impetus for this work was Kantian optimization. It was developed in  , developing early ideas of Laffont . The current status of the theory is consolidated in the recent book . A recent special issue of the Erasmus Journal of Economics is devoted to discussing and situating Roemer’s contribution. Particularly valuable articles in this collection include  . The other strand of ideas relevant to our work concerns the concept of program equilibria, defined in  and further investigated in       . There are several other related (and relevant) models, such as the translucent player model of  , or mediated equilibria . The two other paradigms leading to the same concept for two-player symmetric coordination games, superrationality and (especially) team reasoning are, of course, relevant to our approach. Superrationality is rather different, though, and we only reiterate recommendations of [ref]39 . The main reference for team reasoning is still . We also recommend papers 5  . Notions of symmetry in games have been insufficiently investigated, and they play an important role in defining Kantian programs. We refer to  8 for such studies. Finally, an impressive amount of work on behaviorally relevant game-theoretic notions related to moral behavior is summarized in . While it is by no means comprehensive (especially with respect to the computer science literature), it is an excellent starting point.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: coordination games, superrationality and (especially) team reasoning are, of course, relevant to our approach.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
