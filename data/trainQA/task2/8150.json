      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring the Performance-Reproducibility Trade-off in Quality-Diversity\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMany problems, such as decision-making and content generation, benefit greatly from a variety of solutions and options.\nThis provides a range of choices of high-performing solutions to the final user  or constitutes reservoirs of alternative solutions in unexpected situations .\nQuality-Diversity (QD) algorithms    have attracted attention in recent years as a method to find such collections of diverse and high-performing solutions.\nQD has been applied to a range of problems; finding diverse gaits in robotics , creating innovative designs [ref]6, or generating content for video games .\nWhile uncovering diversity remains the primary usage of these algorithms, they have also proven promising in helping to solve deceptive tasks  , as they discover stepping stones toward more promising solutions that can hardly be found with directed search 0. However, in uncertain domains, where environment dynamics are stochastic or sensors are noisy, QD algorithms struggle to fulfil their objectives 1 2 3.\nDue to their inherent elitism, they tend to favour solutions that are lucky and appear more promising than they truly are 1.\nThis setting, where vanilla QD approaches are limited due to uncertainty, is referred to as Uncertain QD (UQD) 1.\nNew QD algorithms have been proposed to handle the UQD setting 1 4 5 6 7.\nSome of these methods have highlighted the importance of not only dealing with lucky solutions but also prioritising solutions that perform consistently under the uncertainty distribution.\nFor example, consider the robotic locomotion task illustrated in Figure 1, it is undesirable to find a solution that runs fast if it only manages to run 70%percent7070\\% of the time but falls or collides with obstacles the remaining 30%percent3030\\%.\nInstead, when finding a set of solutions that can move to different target positions, we want solutions that consistently reach their target position all or most of the time.\nThis consistency in the behaviour is referred to as reproducibility 1.\nEnsuring reproducibility of solutions is critical for the use of QD in real-world applications (Figure 1). Prior work in UQD has treated optimising performance and reproducibility as a single goal 1 7 5.\nHowever, these two objectives may not be aligned.\nFor example, in robotic control environments, fast-moving solutions may be intrinsically more brittle than more conservative, slower solutions.\nPrior work takes the approach of first finding solutions that are high-performing and then, if possible, make these solutions more reproducible 1 7 5.\nImplicitly, these algorithms assume that there are solutions that are both high-performing and reproducible.\nOn the contrary, we argue that it could be impossible to find solutions that are high-performing and reproducible across every niche.\nThus, there exists a trade-off between performance and reproducibility of solutions that has been largely underappreciated in previous work. A key consideration of the performance-reproducibility trade-off is that there is no “best” solution.\nFor example, in a robotic control task, one solution could achieve 100%percent100100\\% maximum velocity, but a reproducibility score of 80%percent8080\\% while another achieves 80%percent8080\\% maximum velocity and 100%percent100100\\% reproducibility score.\nThe “better” solution depends on the user’s preference between performance and reproducibility.\nHence, we argue that UQD algorithms cannot “solve” the performance-reproducibility trade-off problem.\nThey should instead aim to find the trade-off which satisfies the performance vs. reproducibility preferences specified by a user or a task.\nIf such a preference is unknown, they should return a variety of solutions which provide different trade-offs, such that the user can choose retrospectively. The UQD literature usually considers two main problems 1: the performance estimation problem (i.e. how to best estimate the true quality and diversity of a solution), that we label UQD-Problem 111, and the reproducibility problem (i.e. how to prefer reproducible solutions), that we label UQD-Problem 222. We propose an additional, third problem: the performance-reproducibility problem, UQD-Problem 333, which focuses on enforcing a specified performance-reproducibility trade-off.\nOur contributions are as follows: We propose a systematic way to formulate performance-reproducibility preferences: the δ𝛿\\delta-parametrisation. We develop 444 new UQD approaches when preferences are available a-priori.\nInterestingly, one of them constitutes the general case of the previously proposed ME-LS 5. We propose a multi-objective UQD approach that aims to return a set of Pareto-optimal trade-offs in each niche when preferences are only available a-posteriori. We extend the existing UQD Benchmark 8 with 444 new tasks for the performance-reproducibility problem. Finally, we conduct a rigorous experimental study across 666 benchmark tasks and 333 robotic tasks used in previous UQD works and against a wide variety of baselines. Our results show that our proposed approaches succeed in solving the performance-reproducibility problem in UQD.\nHowever, despite not being designed to produce better archives than existing UQD methods, our results indicate that our approaches perform generally better (i.e. higher QD-Score).\nSpecifically, our approaches, which were only designed to address UQD-Problem 333 (enforcing preferred performance-reproducibility trade-offs), outperform UQD baselines on UQD-Problem 111 (performance-estimation) and UQD-Problem 222 (reproducibility-maximisation).\nThis result indicates that accounting for the performance-reproducibility trade-off is key to future QD approaches in uncertain domains.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: years as a method to find such collections of diverse and high-performing solutions.\nQD has been applied to a range of problems; finding diverse gaits in robotics , creating innovative designs [ref]6, or generating content for video games .\nWhile uncovering diversity remains the primary usage of these algorithms, they have also proven promising in helping to solve deceptive tasks  , as\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
