      "content": "Paper Title: R2L: Distilling Neural Radiance Field to Neural Light Field for Efficient Novel View Synthesis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEfficient neural scene representation and rendering.\nSince the debut of NeRF [ref]34, many follow-up works have been improving its efficiency. One major direction is to skip the empty space and sample more wisely along a camera ray.\nNSVF  defines a set of voxel-bounded implicit fields organized in a sparse voxel octree structure, which enables skipping empty space in novel view synthesis. AutoInt  improves the rendering efficiency by reducing the number of evaluations along a ray through learned partial integrals.\nDeRF  spatially decomposes the scene into Voronoi diagrams, each learned by a small network. They achieve 3 times rendering speedup over NeRF with similar quality.\nSimilarly, KiloNeRF  also spatially decomposes the scene, but into thousands of regular grids. Each of them is tackled by a tiny MLP network. Their work is similar to ours as a pre-trained NeRF model is also used to generate pseudo samples for training. Differently, KiloNeRF is still a NeRF-based method while ours is NeLF. Point sampling is still needed in KiloNeRF while our method roots out this problem. Besides, KiloNeRF results in thousands of small networks, making parallelism more challenging and requiring customized parallelism implementation, while our single network can get significant speedup simply using the vanilla PyTorch .\nDONeRF  is proposed recently to reduce sampling through a depth oracle network learned with the ground-truth depth as supervision. It decimates the sampled points from hundreds (i.e., 256256256 in NeRF [ref]34) to only 444 to 161616 while maintaining comparable or even better quality. However, the depth oracle network is learned with ground-truth depth as target, which is typically unavailable in practice. Our method does not demand it.\nAnother direction for faster NeRF rendering is to pre-compute and cache the representations per the idea of trading memory\nfor computational efficiency. FastNeRF  employs a factorized architecture to independently cache the position-dependent and ray direction-dependent outputs and achieves 3000 times faster than the original NeRF at rendering. Baking  precomputes and stores NeRF as sparse neural radiance grid that enables real-time rendering on commodity hardware. We consider this line of works orthogonal to ours. Neural light field (NeLF). Light fields enjoy a long history as a scene representation in computer vision and graphics  . Levoy et al. 6 and Gortler et al. 3 introduced light fields in computer graphics as 4D scene representation for fast image-based rendering. With them, novel view synthesis can be realized by simply extracting 2D slices in the 4D light field, yet with two major drawbacks. First, they tend to cause considerable storage costs. Second, it is hard to achieve a full 360∘ representation without concatenating multiple light fields. In the era of deep learning, neural light fields based on convolutional networks have been proposed  2 . One recent neural light field paper is Sitzmann et al. . They employ Plücker coordinates to parameterize 360∘superscript360360^{\\circ} light fields. In order to ensure multi-view consistency, they propose to learn a prior over the 4D light fields in a meta-learning framework. Despite intriguing ideas, their method is only evaluated on toy datasets, not as comparable to NeRF [ref]34 in representing complex real-world scenes. Another recent NeLF work is RSEN . To tackle the insufficient training data issue, they propose to learn a voxel grid of subdivided local light fields instead of the global light field. In their experiments, they also employ a pre-trained NeRF teacher for regularization.\nA very recent work 8 proposes a two-stage transformer-based model that can represent view-dependent effects accurately. A concurrent work NeuLF 9 employs a two-plane parameterization of the light field and uses a vanilla MLP network to learn the NeLF mapping.\nOur NeLF network is different from these in that, (1) methodologically, we propose a deep residual MLP (888888 layers) to learn the light field, while these NeLF works still employ the NeRF-like shallow MLP networks (e.g., 666 layers in , 8 layers in ); (2) we propose to leverage a NeRF model to synthesize extra data for training, making our method a bridge from radiance field to light field; (3) thanks to the abundant capacity, our R2L network can achieve better rendering quality (e.g., our method can represent complex real-world scenes against ), or can achieve better efficiency while maintaining the rendering quality (e.g.,  achieves merely around 5×\\times speedup vs. our 30×\\times speedup over the baseline NeRF method). Knowledge distillation (KD). The general idea of knowledge distillation is to guide the training of a student model through a larger pre-trained teacher model. Pioneered by Buciluǎ et al.  and later refined by Hinton et al. 8 for image classification, knowledge distillation has seen extensive application in vision and language tasks  0 [ref]54 . Many variants have been proposed regarding the central question in knowledge distillation – how to define the knowledge that is supposed to be transferred from the teacher to the student, examples including output distance [ref]5 8, internal feature distance 4 [ref]54, feature map attention , feature distribution , activation boundary 7, inter-sample distance relationship   0 , and mutual information . The distillation method in this work is to regress the output of the NeRF model with extra data labeled by the teacher (akin to [ref]5 ), which is the most straightforward way of distillation for the numerical target. Yet we will show this simple scheme can work powerfully to train a deep neural light field network.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: Efficient neural scene representation and rendering.\nSince the debut of NeRF [ref]34, many follow-up works have been improving its efficiency.
