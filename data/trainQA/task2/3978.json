      "content": "Paper Title: Mutual Information Divergence: A Unified Metric for Multimodal Generative Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImplementation details.\nWithout an explicit mention, we use the CLIP (ViT-L/14) to extract image and text embedding vectors. Note that it is crucial to use double-precision for numerical stability. Generated Likert-scale judgments.\nTo carefully assess the text-image alignment, we consider the four-scale alignment using the real and fake images from the COCO dataset [ref]2.\nWe regard the real images as a four-point set, the fake images generated by the ground-truth captions as a three-point set, the fake images generated by the foiled captions 111For the details, please refer to the object hallucination section in Section 7 and Figure 11 in Appendix. [ref]39 as a two-point set, and the randomly sampled (misaligned) fake images as one-point set.\nWe assume that the fake images generated by the foiled captions should be inferior compared with the fake images generated by the ground-truth captions because the model cannot exploit the critical information to generate key objects.\nThe current state-of-the-art LAFITE  pre-trained on the COCO 222https://github.com/drboog/Lafite is used for our text-to-image generation model.\nNotice that when we evaluate the metrics, the ground-truth captions are used to measure the text-image alignment of the generated images.\nWe believe this generated benchmark can be a proxy to human judgments with a careful manipulation of the fake images using the foiled captions. We randomly sample 30K captions from the FOIL dataset [ref]39 to build 120K judgments. We report the Kendall’s τ𝜏\\tau coefficient [ref]41 to measure the rank correlation, a variant of τcsubscript𝜏𝑐\\tau_{c} or τbsubscript𝜏𝑏\\tau_{b} accounting for ties.\nIn Table 1, our method consistently outperforms competing methods.\nInfoNCE denotes the negative InfoNCE loss  calculating the softmax function over the 30K captions. Remind that the InfoNCE maximizes a lower bound on mutual information . Since this is estimated using a smaller batch size when optimizing, it shows a limited capability as a metric for the text-image alignment.\nPlease refer to Table 8 and Figure 8 in Appendix for the VQ-Diffusion  benchmark. Figure 2 (top left) shows the histogram of the frequencies of PMI showing the four categories. Fake samples have generally lower values than Real’s. Foiled Fake has lower values than Real and Fake having a long tail. We observe that foiled caption broadly impacts the text-image alignment as we expected.\nThe negative PMI is often observed for the fake images, which are deviated from the distribution of real images.\nWhereas, the histogram of CLIP-S 333The CLIP-S  is defined as 2.5×cos⁡(𝐱,𝐲)2.5𝐱𝐲2.5\\times\\cos(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}) which is the scaled cosine similarity of the CLIP features. (bottom right) and InfoNCE (bottom left) show Fake samples where its scores are higher than Real’s, while the overlapping areas of Fake and Foiled Fake (62.2% and 61.6% for CLIP-S and InfoNCE, respectively) are greater than PMI’s (55.2%), making it difficult to differentiate the degree of text-image alignment.\nFor the caption generation method , we exploit the current state-of-the-art image captioning model of the OFA-Large  pre-trained on a huge mixture of publicly available datasets to generate captions for the generated images. Then, CLIP-S  is used to assess the quality of image captioning.\nNotice that CLIP-S outperforms traditional image captioning metrics as shown in Section 4.2. Visual reasoning accuracy using the foiled caption trick. Inspired by the foiled caption trick, we extend to four visual reasoning skills for object, count, color, and spatial relationship. For each category, we define a set of tokens, and we foiled those tokens in the caption by randomly swapping to the other token. We build three sets of images, the real images, the fake images, and the foiled fake images. We measure the accuracy that getting one point for the foiled fake images having the lowest score, or zero for the other cases.\nTable 3 shows that our method achieved the best performance across all categories. The runner-up was InfoNCE, while SOA was ineffective to differentiate among the two fake images and the real image.\nAlthough DALL-Eval  proposed to use a detector and its dedicated heads for the count, color, and spatial relationship tasks, this was limited to the 3D-generated images with their near-perfect detection ability.\nRemind that the accuracy of random guessing is 33.3%, where MID requires a powerful feature extractor of the CLIP ViT-L/14 to get meaningful performances on the count, color, and spatial relationship tasks.\nFor the detail, please refer to the text in Appendix C. Human Likert-scale judgment.\n\nWe collect 10K one-to-four Likert-scale human judgments for 2K fake images using the LAFITE and VQ-Diffusion from the Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) for the fine-grained comparison with the competing metrics. For each image, we collect five annotations from unique workers taking its median for a reliable correlation measurement. Table 2 shows the consistent results with our generated judgment correlation benchmark.\nSince this benchmark aims for the fine-grained judgment among only fake images, overall scores are relatively lower than the generated benchmark. All correlation results are significant having the p-value < 0.001.\nFor the details of the collection procedure and data statistics, please refer to Appendix D, where\nFigure 10 shows the visualization of some examples comparing with human judgment scores.\nWe also report the comp-t2i benchmark  results for the compositional evaluation of the CUB and Flower datasets in aspects of color and shape in Appendix F.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: for numerical stability. Generated Likert-scale judgments.\nTo carefully assess the text-image alignment, we consider the four-scale alignment using the real and fake images from the COCO dataset [ref]2.\nWe regard the real images as a four-point set, the fake images generated by the ground-truth captions as a three-point set, the fake images generated by the foiled captions 111For the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
