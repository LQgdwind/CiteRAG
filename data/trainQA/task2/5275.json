      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Subgrid-Scale Models with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe training data is generated by using the ERK4 scheme and (8) with a timestep size of △​t=0.005△𝑡0.005{\\triangle t}=0.005. The simulation is warmed up for t=3𝑡3t=3 by using a randomly generated initial condition X∈ℝK𝑋superscriptℝ𝐾X\\in{\\mathbb{R}}^{K} and Y∈ℝJ​K𝑌superscriptℝ𝐽𝐾Y\\in{\\mathbb{R}}^{JK}.\nAfter spinup, we set t=0𝑡0t=0 and integrate for t∈ 𝑡010t\\in .\nThis process is repeated 300300300 times. We take this generated data to be the ground truth solution. Next, we train the neural network source term in (9a) using the training dataset, which is obtained by choosing random starting points in the truth dataset and integrating for five timesteps with a timestep size of △​t△𝑡{\\triangle t}.\nWe use the Adam optimizer [ref]40 with 2,00020002,000 epochs and 100100100 batches along with the loss function defined in (10). We plot the trained neural network source term Sθsubscript𝑆𝜃S_{\\theta} and true coupling term S𝑆S in Figure 2. The neural network source term differs from the true coupling source term by less than 5%percent55\\%. In comparison with the true coupling term, the neural network source generally exhibits smoother profiles, as expected. Next we forecast the slow variables using the learned neural network source.\nWe randomly choose an initial profile\nand integrate the model (9a)\nwith 10​△​t10△𝑡10{\\triangle t}.\n111\nThe prediction timestep size 10​△​t10△𝑡10{\\triangle t} was ten times larger than the training timestep size △​t△𝑡{\\triangle t}.\n\nThe true value X𝑋X (top) and the prediction X^^𝑋\\hat{X} (middle) for the slow variables are shown in the Hovmöller diagram in Figure 3.\nThe difference between the two simulations of X𝑋X and X^^𝑋{\\hat{X}} is shown in the bottom panel.\nThe prediction with the neural network source term is close to the true values up to t=2𝑡2t=2, which exceeds the reported Lyapunov time of the slow variables of the uncoupled model (h=0ℎ0h=0) that is 0.720.720.72 . For this specific initial condition, the augmenting neural network source model’s predictability is about 222 time units. We also plot the Hovmöller diagram with another initial condition in Figure\n4.\nWe advance the trained model (9a) with the different timestep sizes of\n{1,2,5,10}×△​t12510△𝑡\\left\\{1,2,5,10\\right\\}\\times{\\triangle t}. All the predictions show good agreement up to around t=3𝑡3t=3.\nAs anticipated, the proposed method is not sensitive to the timestep sizes used for prediction because of the continuous aspect of the trajectory obtained by using a neural network source operator.\nIn this example, the neural network source term enables the prediction of the slow variables with a step size that is 101010 times larger than the true model (8a), without interacting with the fast variables.\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: training dataset, which is obtained by choosing random starting points in the truth dataset and integrating for five timesteps with a timestep size of △​t△𝑡{\\triangle t}.\nWe use the Adam optimizer [ref]40 with 2,00020002,000 epochs and 100100100 batches along with the loss function defined in (10). We plot the trained neural network source term Sθsubscript𝑆𝜃S_{\\theta} and true coupling term\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1.
