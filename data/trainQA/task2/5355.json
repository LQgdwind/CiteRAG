      "content": "Paper Title: HiFlash: Communication-Efficient Hierarchical Federated Learning with Adaptive Staleness Control and Heterogeneity-aware Client-Edge Association\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn order to gauge the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, we conduct extensive evaluations in a simulated environment with 100 clients, 10 edge nodes and a cloud server. We consider image classification as the FL task and evaluate the performance of HiFL and HiFlash with three real-world datasets: MNIST [ref]21, CIFAR10  and FEMNIST . As FEMNIST is a federated version of Extended MNIST dataset  whith 805,263 samples from 3,550 writers, we randomly select 100 writers as the clients to participate the model training of in our experiments. For the 10-class hand-written digit classification dataset MNIST, we use LeNet  as the model trained on the clients. For the CIFAR10 dataset, a standard ResNet-18  model is adopted. For the 62-class hand-written digit classification dataset FEMNIST, we design a convolutional neural network (CNN) with 214,590 learning parameters as the learning model. The datasets and the corresponding models are summarized in Table II. All the experiments are conducted on one Tesla P100 12GB GPU and the algorithms are implemented by Pytorch version 1.10.0. For the local computation of the training on each client, we employ mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a batch size of 60 for MNIST and FEMNIST, and 50 for CIFAR10, respectively. The initial learning rates are 0.01 for MNIST and FEMNIST, and 0.1 for CIFAR10 as in , both of which decay exponentially at a rate of 0.99 every 100 epochs. The number of local updates cùëêc for each client in one client-edge communication round is set to be 3 and the number of client-edge aggregations before pushing the edge model to the cloud server is set as H‚àà{1,2,3}ùêª123H\\in\\{1,2,3\\}.333The values of cùëêc and HùêªH depend on the computation budgets of the devices in practice. Due to the computing resource limitation of our research lab, we set small values for both cùëêc and HùêªH, but it is sufficient to evaluate the effectiveness of HiFlash. The hyperparameters Œ±ùõº\\alpha and œÖùúê\\upsilon in coefficient Œ±œÑsubscriptùõºùúè\\alpha_{\\tau} can be determined by grid search in practice. For DRL training, we set different threshold bounds (œÑm‚Äãa‚Äãx=16subscriptùúèùëöùëéùë•16\\tau_{max}=16 for MNIST and FEMNIST datasets, and œÑm‚Äãa‚Äãx=4subscriptùúèùëöùëéùë•4\\tau_{max}=4 for CIFAR10 dataset) for the three datasets as a bigger staleness threshold will result in much longer training time for the complicated CIFAR10 dataset. Hence, according to different action size, the DDQN model in the DRL agent, which is implemented by two two-layer multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks, has 4,607 and 4,235 trainable parameters for MNIST (and FEMNIST), and CIFAR10 datasets, respectively. The output of the MLP network passing through a softmax layer becomes the probability of selecting a staleness threshold. The DDQN is lightweighted and each training iteration takes seconds on GPU. Data Heterogeneity.\nFor MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, to simulate the data heterogeneity of clients in real world, we generate three kinds of data distributions for clients as below: IID: Each client is randomly assigned a uniform data distribution over 10 classes. Non-IID(1): Each client possesses only one random class of images. Non-IID(2): The samples in each client are assigned from two randomly selected classes. While the FEMNIST dataset naturally falls in the following three data heterogeneity cases: Label distribution skew: The label distributions are totally different among the writers. Feature distribution skew: There is a natural feature distribution skew among different writers due to their different character features (e.g., stroke width, slant). Quantity skew: The samples in each client are ranging from   . The data distribution on an edge node can be obtained by calculating the weighted average of the data distributions of its associated clients. We can use JS divergence to measure the data heterogeneity of the edge nodes. Resource Heterogeneity.\nThe highly heterogeneous hardware resources (CPU, network connection) among clients can be reflected by the computing latency Cc‚Äão‚Äãm‚Äãpi,ksuperscriptsubscriptùê∂ùëêùëúùëöùëùùëñùëòC_{comp}^{i,k} and communication latency Cc‚Äão‚Äãm‚Äãmi,m,ksuperscriptsubscriptùê∂ùëêùëúùëöùëöùëñùëöùëòC_{comm}^{i,m,k}. For the computation ability of each client kùëòk, we assume fk‚àà[ref]1 [ref]2subscriptùëìùëò12f_{k}\\in[ref]1 [ref]2 GHz as the CPU cycle frequency and Œ∂k=20subscriptùúÅùëò20\\zeta_{k}=20 cycles/bit as the number of CPU cycles to execute one bit. For the communication ability, the bandwidth Bk,msubscriptùêµùëòùëöB_{k,m} is ranging from 1‚Äã¬†MHz1¬†MHz1\\text{ MHz} to 10‚Äã¬†MHz10¬†MHz10\\text{ MHz} when associated with different edge node mùëöm.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: environment with 100 clients, 10 edge nodes and a cloud server.
