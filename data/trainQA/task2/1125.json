      "content": "Paper Title: Quasiconformal Model with CNN Features for Large Deformation Image Registration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe first test our method on a synthetic example with the source image containing a letter ‘Z’ (Fig. 4(a)) and the target image containing a tilted number ‘2’ (Fig. 4(b)). Two major difficulties of this example are the large displacement between the ‘Z’ and the ‘2’ and the shape difference between them involving certain sharp angle changes. Although one may use an affine map to roughly align them, the boundary of the two images will be largely mismatched. As shown in Fig. 4(c), our proposed registration method effectively morphs the ‘Z’ image to match the ‘2’ image. One can also visualize the registration via the deformed underlying grid as shown in Fig. 4(d), from which it can be observed that the mapping is smooth and bijective. As shown in Fig. 4(e), the energy decreases rapidly throughout the iterations. For comparison, we apply DDemons  (Fig. 4(f)), LDDMM  (Fig. 4(g)), Elastix  (Fig. 4(h)), and DROP [ref]18 (Fig. 4(i)) for registering the images. It can be observed that all these methods fail to register the ‘Z’ and the ‘2’ shape due to the large displacement and shape change. We then consider another synthetic example with the source image being an eagle (Fig. 5(a)). For the target image (Fig. 5(b)), we manually deform the eagle shape such that the wings are expanded wider. We apply our proposed method to obtain a registration between the two images (see Fig. 5(c) for the warped image and Fig. 5(d) for the warped image with the deformed underlying grid). Under the registration, the difference between the two images is significantly reduced, and the energy plot in Fig. 5(e) again shows that our method is highly effective. On the contrary, it can be observed that LDDMM  does not produce an accurate registration of the wings (Fig. 5(f) and Fig. 5(g)). While the registration result by Elastix  looks satisfactory (Fig. 5(h)), there are multiple overlaps in the deformed underlying grid (Fig. 5(i)). Overall, our method gives the best registration result with a more natural positional correspondence between different parts as shown by the deformation of the underlying grid and with bijectivity ensured. In the next example, the source image is a rabbit (Fig. 6(a)), and the target image is the same rabbit with its ears bent (Fig. 6(b)). Our method successfully morphs the ears to the desired position as shown in Fig. 6(c). From the deformed underlying grid in Fig. 6(d), we can see that the mapping is smooth and bijective. Also, the energy plot in Fig. 6(e) shows that our method effectively reduces the energy within a small number of iterations. On the contrary, LDDMM  fails to match the bent ears (Fig. 6(f) and Fig. 6(g)). While Elastix  is able to deform the ears, the overall image shape is largely distorted (Fig. 6(h) and Fig. 6(i)).\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: smooth and bijective. As shown in Fig. 4(e), the energy decreases rapidly throughout the iterations. For comparison, we apply DDemons  (Fig. 4(f)), LDDMM  (Fig. 4(g)), Elastix  (Fig. 4(h)), and DROP [ref]18 (Fig. 4(i)) for registering the images. It can be observed that all these methods fail to register the ‘Z’ and the ‘2’ shape due to the large displacement and shape change.
