In Yang et al. , a text encoder is used to obtain text features, which are then processed by a non-autoregressive decoder to generate spectrogram tokens. These tokens are fed to a vector quantized VAE (VQ-VAE) to generate mel spectrograms that are used by a vocoder to generate audio. The non-autoregressive decoder is a probabilistic diffusion model. In addition, Yang et al.  introduced a novel data augmentation technique called the mask-based text generation strategy (MBTG), which masks out portions of input text that do not represent any event, such as those indicating temporality. The aim of MBTG is to learn augmented text descriptions from audio during training. Although this approach seems promising, its fundamental limitation is the lack of diversity in the generated data, as it fails to mix different audio samples. Later, Kreuk et al. [ref]17 proposed a correction to this method, mixing audio signals according to random signal-to-noise ratios and concatenating the corresponding textual descriptions. This approach allows for the generation of new (text, audio) pairs and mitigates the limitations of Yang et al. . Unlike Yang et al. , the architecture proposed in Kreuk et al. [ref]17 uses a transformer encoder and decoder network to autoregressively generate audio tokens from text input. Recently, Liu et al. [ref]18 proposed AudioLDM, which translates the Latent Diffusion Model of text-to-visual to text-to-audio generation. They pre-trained VAE-based encoder-decoder networks to learn a compressed latent representation of audio, which was then used to guide a diffusion model to generate audio tokens from text input. They found that using audio embeddings instead of text embeddings during the backward diffusion process improved conditional audio generation. During inference time, they used text embeddings for text-to-audio generation. Audio and text embeddings were obtained using pre-trained CLAP, which is the audio counterpart of CLIP embeddings used in the original LDM model.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: The field of text-to-audio generation has received limited attention until recently [ref]17 .
