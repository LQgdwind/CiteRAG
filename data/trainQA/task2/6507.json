      "content": "Paper Title: DSTCGCN: Learning Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Cross Dependencies for Traffic Forecasting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGNNs have shown superior performance in many applications due to their ability to model non-Euclidean dependencies [ref]10. In particular, for traffic forecasting, STGNNs have shown the state-of-the-art performance, as they can learn spatial dependencies and temporal dependencies more effectively compared with other deep learning works . Many STGNNs [ref]10 integrate GNNs to capture spatial dependencies with RNNs, CNNs, or Attentions to model temporal dependencies. For example, STGCN  deploys GCN and 1-D convolution to capture spatial and temporal dependencies, respectively. ASTGCN  improves STGCN by introducing spatial and temporal attention mechanisms into the model to capture the dynamics of traffic data. ASTGNN  develops a GCN to model the spatial dependencies and a temporal trend-aware multi-head self-attention to capture the temporal dependencies. Since these STGNNs mainly use pre-defined graphs, e.g., geometric distance, functional similarity, and transportation connectivity , they might miss some implicit spatial dependencies. To address this problem, some graph learning works have been proposed to construct graph structures from observed data end-to-end. Graph WaveNet  learns a self-adaptive adjacency matrix to capture spatial dependencies by multiplying two learnable node embeddings. AGCRN [ref]13 constructs an adjacency matrix directly by multiplying one learnable node embedding and its transpose. MTGNN [ref]23 learns a uni-directional adjacency matrix using two node embeddings. RGSL  further regulates the learned graphs by Gumbel-softmax. Although these learned graphs can alleviate the limitation of pre-defined graphs, they still model static spatial dependencies, which neglect the changing nature of the spatial dependencies within road networks. There have been some explorations of modeling dynamic spatial dependencies. For example, SLCNN  learns dynamic structures by a function of the current samples. DGCRN  constructs dynamic adjacency matrices by integrating dynamic features (time stamps and speeds). DSTAGNN  and D2STGNN  obtain dynamic adjacency matrices using attention mechanisms. However, these works only focus on the dynamics of spatial dependencies, which ignores time-varying dependencies crossing spatial and temporal dimensions.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: GNNs have shown superior performance in many applications due to their ability to model non-Euclidean dependencies [ref]10.
