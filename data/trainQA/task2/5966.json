      "content": "Paper Title: CiPR: An Efficient Framework with Cross-instance Positive Relations for Generalized Category Discovery\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAfter training on large-scale datasets with human annotations, existing machine learning models can achieve superb performance (e.g.,¬†[ref]23). However, the success of these models heavily relies on the fact that they are only tasked to recognize images from the same set of classes with large-scale human annotations on which they are trained. This limits their application in the real open world where we will encounter data without annotations and from unseen categories. Indeed, more and more efforts have been devoted to dealing with more realistic settings. For example, semi-supervised learning (SSL)¬† aims at training a robust model using both labelled and unlabelled data from the same set of classes; few-shot learning¬† tries to learn models that can generalize to new classes with few annotated samples; open-set recognition (OSR)¬† learns to tell whether or not an unlabelled image belongs to one of the classes on which the model is trained. More recently, the problem of novel category discovery (NCD)¬†[ref]15   has been introduced, which learns models to automatically partition unlabelled data from unseen categories by transferring knowledge from seen categories. One assumption in early NCD methods is that unlabelled images are all from unseen categories only. NCD has been recently extended to a more generalized setting, called generalized category discovery (GCD)¬†[ref]34, by relaxing the assumption to reflect the real world better, i.e., unlabelled images are from both seen and unseen categories. The diagram of GCD problem is shown in¬†Fig.¬†4. In this paper, we tackle the problem of GCD by drawing inspiration from the baseline method¬†[ref]34. In¬†[ref]34, a vision transformer model was first trained for representation learning using supervised contrastive learning on labelled data and self-supervised contrastive learning on both labelled and unlabelled data. With the learned representation, semi-supervised kùëòk-means¬†[ref]15 was then adopted for label assignment across all instances. In addition, based on semi-supervised kùëòk-means, [ref]34 also introduced an algorithm to estimate the unknown category number for the unlabelled data by examining possible category numbers in a given range. However, this approach has several limitations. First, during representation learning, the method considers labelled and unlabelled data independently, and uses a stronger training signal for the labelled data which might compromise the representation of the unlabelled data. Second, the method requires a known category number for performing label assignment. Third, the category number estimation method is slow as it needs to run the clustering algorithm multiple times to test different category numbers. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a new approach for GCD which does not require a known unseen category number and considers Cross-instance Positive Relations in unlabelled data for better representation learning (CiPR). At the core of our approach is our novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering algorithm with selective neighbor, named as selective neighbor clustering (SNC), that takes inspiration from the parameter-free hierarchical clustering method FINCH¬†. SNC can not only generate reliable pseudo labels for cross-instance positive relations, but also estimate unseen category numbers without the need for repeated runs of the clustering algorithm.\nSNC builds a graph indicating all subtly selected neighbor relations constrained by the labelled instances, and produces clusters directly from the connected components in the graph. SNC iteratively constructs a hierarchy of partitions with different granularity, while satisfying the constraints imposed by the labelled instances. With a one-by-one merging strategy, SNC can quickly estimate a reliable class number without repeated runs of the algorithm, which makes it significantly faster than¬†[ref]34. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: (1) we propose a new GCD framework, named CiPR, exploiting more cross-instance positive relations in the partially labelled set to strengthen the connections among all instances, fostering the representation learning for better category discovery; (2) we introduce a semi-supervised hierarchical clustering algorithm, named SNC, that can be adopted for reliable pseudo label generation during training and label assignment during testing; (3) we further leverage SNC for class number estimation by exploring intrinsic and extrinsic clustering quality based on a joint reference score considering both labelled and unlabelled data; (4) we comprehensively evaluate our framework on both generic image recognition datasets and challenging fine-grained datasets, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across the board.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: After training on large-scale datasets with human annotations, existing machine learning models can achieve superb performance (e.g.,¬†[ref]23).
