      "content": "Paper Title: On Understanding and Mitigating the Dimensional Collapse of Graph Contrastive Learning: a Non-Maximum Removal Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph Representation Learning (GRL) has become increasingly popular for the ubiquitous graph-structured data across domains, including traffic [ref]45, social network , and knowledge graph [ref]31.\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs)   are utilized as backbones of GRL to learn low-dimensional embeddings of nodes or graphs while maintaining structure and attribute information.\nMost GNN models are trained in the (semi-)supervised learning setting requiring abundant manually-annotated labels.\nIn case of insufficient data labels, recent Contrastive Learning (CL) based on Information Maximization (InfoMax) principle  has shown promising performance for self-supervised learning with success across fields including computer vision [ref]6  and natural language processing  .\nThese CL methods maximize the Mutual Information (MI) between different augmented views of the same instance while minimizing the MI between those of the different instances. Inspired by the above CL models, Deep Graph InfoMax (DGI)  applies the InfoMax principle to graph representation learning, which relies on maximizing the mutual information between one graph’s patch-level and global-level representations.\nFollowing SimCLR [ref]6, a series of graph contrastive learning methods   enforce the embedding of positive pair (i.e., augmented views of the same graph) to be close and the embedding of negative pair (i.e., augmented views of different graphs) to be distant in the Euclidean space.\nGCC  referring to MoCo  contrasts graph-level embedding with momentum encoder and maintain the queue of data samples. However, graph contrastive learning suffers from the dimensional collapse problem, i.e., the space spanned by embedding vectors is only a subspace of the entire space as shown in Fig. 1(b).\nThe concentration of information on part of dimensions weakens the distinguishability of embeddings in downstream classification tasks.\nWe analyze two reasons for the dimensional collapse in GCL:\n(1) The smoothing effect of graph pooling layer makes initially untrained embeddings of positive pairs highly similar in pattern.\nThe alignment between positive pair embeddings lead part of dimensions to collapse.\n(2) The implicit regularization of graph convolution layers where the product of learnable weight matrices tend to be low-rank subsequently cause the rank deficiency of embedding space. In this paper, we propose a novel Non-Maximum Removal Graph Contrastive Learning (nmrGCL) approach for self-supervised graph representation learning.\nThe key idea of nmrGCL is to learn complementary embeddings of augmented graphs, inspired by non-maximum suppression (NSM) which is widely used in visual object detection  .\nSpecifically, for positive pairs, the embedding of the first augmented view identifies the prominent dimensions and then removes these dimensions in the embedding of the second in pre-train process.\nWe conduct experiments on bioinformatics and social networks datasets to show the effectiveness. The contributions of this paper are as follows: ∙∙\\bullet    We formally point out and theoretically analyze the so-called dimensional collapse in graph contrastive learning, which has not been discussed in graph learning literature to our best knowledge.\nIt limits the expressiveness of embeddings in downstream tasks e.g. node/graph classification.\nWe reveal the two reasons for the dimensional collapse in GCL: i) smoothing effect of permutation-invariant graph pooling and ii) tendency to be low-rank of multi-layer graph convolution. ∙∙\\bullet    We propose a novel non-maximum removal graph contrastive learning approach (nmrGCL) for self-supervised graph classification tasks and extension to node classification task.\nOur model effectively encourages the encoder to learn complementary representation in pretext tasks using non-maximum removal operation. ∙∙\\bullet    Experiments on multiple datasets show that nmrGCL outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods on graph classification tasks and achieves competitive performance on node classification tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: Graph Representation Learning (GRL) has become increasingly popular for the ubiquitous graph-structured data across domains, including traffic [ref]45, social network , and knowledge graph [ref]31.\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs)   are utilized as backbones of GRL to learn low-dimensional embeddings of nodes or graphs while maintaining\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
