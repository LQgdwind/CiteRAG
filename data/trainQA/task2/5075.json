It constructs a prediction set that possibly contains the true label.\nHere, we consider conformal prediction under various assumptions on data distributions. No shift.\nThe original conformal prediction assumes exchangeability on data\n(where a special case of exchangeability is the independent and identical distribution (i.i.d.) assumption on data).\nThis mainly assumes that in prediction, the conformal predictor observes the data\nwhich are drawn from the same distribution as in training.\nUnder this assumption,\na marginal coverage guarantee   and\na conditional coverage guarantee (i.e.,¬†probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantee)  [ref]34  can be achievable\nfor the correctness of constructed prediction sets.\nHowever, this strong assumption on no distribution shift can be broken in practice. Covariate or label shift.\nTo address the no shift assumption,\nthe conformal prediction approach can be extended to handle\ncovariate shift ,\nwhere the covariate distribution p‚Äã(x)ùëùùë•p(x) can be shifted in prediction, while\nthe labeling distribution p‚Äã(y|x)ùëùconditionalùë¶ùë•p(y|x) is unchanged,\nor label shift 6,\nwhere the label distribution p‚Äã(y)ùëùùë¶p(y) can be shifted in prediction, while\nthe conditional covariate distribution p‚Äã(x|y)ùëùconditionalùë•ùë¶p(x|y) is not changing.\nIn particular, weighted conformal prediction can achieve a desired marginal coverage rate\ngiven true importance weights ;\nsimilarly, PAC prediction sets, also called training-conditional inductive conformal prediction,\nachieves a desired PAC guarantee under a smoothness assumption on distributions .\nThe conformal prediction can achieve the marginal coverage guarantee under label shift by exploiting\ntrue importance weights . Meta learning.\nCovariate and label shift setups involve two distributions, while\nin meta learning multiple distributions for each data sources are considered,\nassuming a distribution of each data source is drawn from the same distribution.\nUnder this setup, conformal prediction tailored to meta learning can attain\na desired coverage guarantee ,\na conditional guarantee ,\nand\na fully-conditional guarantee . Adaptive conformal prediction.\nThe previous conformal prediction methods consider the non-sequential data, assuming\nshift among a discrete set of distributions.\nIn sequential data, the data shift is continuous,\nwhere the online learning of conformal prediction sets is considered.\nIn particular,\nadaptive conformal inference 0 updates a desired marginal coverage of conformal prediction for every time step to have a prediction set that satisfies a desired marginal coverage rate on any data from an arbitrarily shifted distribution.\nMulti-valid prediction  constructs a prediction set at each time that achieves\nthreshold-calibrated validity as well as a desired marginal coverage.\nAdaptive conformal prediction methods consider a single data source,\nwhere the data distribution can be arbitrarily shifted (also by adversaries).\nIn this paper, we consider the consensus over base conformal prediction sets based on any adaptive conformal prediction methods for multiple data sources. Ensemble conformal prediction.\n\nUnder no shift assumption (more precisely the exchangeable assumption),\nensemble approaches in combining conformal predictors have been explored.\nExisting work [ref]3 0  5 mainly assumes batch learning setups with the exchangeability assumption on samples from each source,\nwhich implies that a data distribution is not changing.\nIn particular,\n[ref]3 0 consider combining p-values from data sources with the exchangeable assumption and\n5 combines non-conformity scores, constructed using data from different data sources with the exchangeable assumption.\nThe most closely related work is ; this approach\ncomputes consensus sets, similar to ours, over conformal prediction sets, which are constructed under\nthe exchangeable assumption.\nContrast to these, we consider an online learning setup where data distributions of sources are shifted over time and data from some sources are maliciously manipulated.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: drawn from the same distribution as in training.\nUnder this assumption,\na marginal coverage guarantee   and\na conditional coverage guarantee (i.e.,¬†probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantee)  [ref]34  can be achievable\nfor the correctness of constructed prediction sets.\nHowever, this strong assumption on no distribution shift can be broken in practice.
