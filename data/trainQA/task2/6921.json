      "content": "Paper Title: Test-Time Adaptation for Point Cloud Upsampling Using Meta-Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPoint cloud is one of the most popular representations of the 3D information in robotic applications. Point clouds can be obtained from readily available 3D scanning devices, such as LiDARs and RGB-D cameras. They play a vital role in a variety of applications, such as autonomous driving , augmented reality , and robotics . However, the point clouds obtained from affordable 3D scanners are usually sparse and non-uniform. Therefore, these sparse point clouds need to be effectively upsampled to produce denser point clouds in order to be used in many downstream applications. Given an input sparse point cloud, our goal is to generate a high-resolution uniform point cloud that adequately represents the underlying surface. Many traditional optimization-based methods     [ref]8 have been proposed for point cloud upsampling. Recently, DNN-based upsampling methods have emerged and achieved impressive results, including MPU , PUGAN 0, PUGCN 1, Dis-PU 2, and PU-Dense 3. These methods can learn complex structures of point clouds and outperform traditional approaches. However, most learning-based methods have followed a fully supervised learning paradigm for point cloud upsampling. They assume that the training and test data are sampled from the same data distribution. This is unrealistic for real-world scenarios due to the fact that the data captured by different 3D sensors have large discrepancies. It is challenging for the training data to cover all the variations that can happen during testing. Consequently, trained models usually experience a drastic drop in performance when they are evaluated on unknown test distributions. This is known as the domain shift problem. To address the distribution shift issue and the resulting performance drop, recent work has proposed domain adaptation approaches for point clouds to minimize the gap between training and test distributions, e.g. using adversarial learning 4 5 6 7 or self-supervised learning 8 9 0 1. However, these approaches have some limitations. First, they assume having access to unlabeled samples of the target test distribution during training. This may not be feasible in real-world settings where the information from test distribution is not available in advance. In addition, they do not fully utilize the useful internal information available within the test instance, since the trained model parameters are fixed during inference time for all unseen test instances. Recently, Zhou et al. 2 have adopted ZSSR 3 for point cloud upsampling. They have proposed a Zero-Shot Point Cloud Upsampling (ZSPU) 2 approach that can capture the internal information provided by a given point cloud at test time. This method trains the network from scratch at test time using augmented pairs of sparse-dense point clouds extracted from the test point cloud. Although ZSPU 2 can successfully exploit the internal features of the test instances, it requires a high inference time due to self-training at test time. In addition, it fails to utilize the useful information learned from the external dataset. In this work, we address the above limitations by introducing a test-time adaptation approach that leverages the internal and external information of point clouds. Concretely, we first conduct large-scale training using pairs of sparse-dense point clouds to utilize the external dataset. Then, we adapt the model parameters in an instance-specific manner during inference and obtain a different set of network parameters for each different instance. This allows our model to better capture the uniqueness of each test sample and thus generalize better to unseen data. We have found that a simple fine-tuning of the pre-trained network is not optimal, since it takes a huge number of gradient updates for adaptation. Therefore, we propose to use meta-learning for a fast and effective adaptation of the model at test time. Meta-learning has shown great success in learning new tasks quickly with few training samples. In particular, Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) 4 has been widely employed for various domain adaptation tasks 5 6 7 8. MAML 4 is an optimization-based method that aims to learn the model parameters in a way that facilitates fast adaptation at test time within a few gradient updates. We adopt MAML 4 for training the point cloud upsampling networks. During meta-training, each input point cloud is downsampled by a predefined scaling factor and the MAML 4 task is the reconstruction of the input point cloud. At test time, the model is updated by a few gradient updates based on a self-supervised learning procedure that exploits the internal information of the test point cloud. The updated model is then used for the final prediction. Our key contributions are summarized as follows: We propose a test-time adaptation approach for point cloud upsampling. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that exploits the complementary advantages of both internal and external learning for point cloud upsampling. We propose to employ meta-learning to provide the model with the ability of fast and effective adaptation at inference time to improve the model generalization. We introduce a novel model-agnostic framework that can be applied on any point cloud upsampling network to boost its performance.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: Given an input sparse point cloud, our goal is to generate a high-resolution uniform point cloud that adequately represents the underlying surface.
