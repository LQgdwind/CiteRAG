      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Deep Video Compression by Resolution-adaptive Flow Coding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe experimental results on different datasets are provided in Figure 7.\nIn DVC , the hyperprior entropy model  is used to compress the flow maps. However, other advanced methods like the auto-regressive entropy model  can be readily used to compress the flow maps. To this end, we report two results for our RaFC framework, which are denoted as “Ours” and “Ours*”. In “Ours”, the hyperprior entropy model  is incorporated in our RaFC framework in order to fairly compare our RaFC framework with DVC. In “Ours*”, the auto-regressive entropy model  is incorporated in our RaFC framework to further improve the video compression performance.\nWe use the traditional compression methods H.264 [ref]32, H.265  and the state-of-the-art learning-based compression methods, including DVC , AD_ICCV [ref]9, AH_ICCV  and CW_ECCV [ref]33 for performance comparison.\nIt is noted that CW_ECCV [ref]33 and AD_ICCV [ref]9 are B-frame based compression methods, while the others are P-frame based compression methods.\nFor H.264 and H.265, we follow the setting in DVC  and use FFmpeg with the default mode.\nWe use the image compression method  to reconstruct the I-frame. As shown in Figure 7, our method using the hyperprior entropy model (i.e., “Ours”) outperforms the baseline method DVC on all datasets, which demonstrates it is beneficial to use our newly proposed framework RaFC to compress the optical flow maps.\nIn other words, it is necessary to choose the optimal resolutions for the optical flow maps and the corresponding motion features in video compression.\nWhen compared with our method using the hyperprior entropy model (i.e., “Ours”), our method using the auto-regressive entropy model (i.e., “Ours*”) further improves the results, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the auto-regressive entropy model for flow compression.\nOur method using the auto-regressive entropy model  achieves the best results on all datasets. Specifically, our method (i.e.,“Ours*”) has about 0.5dB gain over DVC at 0.1bpp on the UVG dataset.\nOn the MCL-JCV dataset, our approach (i.e.,“Ours*”) outperforms the interpolation based video compression method AD_ICCV in terms of both PSNR and MS-SSIM. In addition, it also achieves about 0.4dB improvement at 0.2bpp over AD_ICCV on the VTL dataset in terms of PSNR.\nAlthough our method is designed for P-frame compression, we can still achieve better compression performance than the B-frame compression methods AD_ICCV and CW_ECCV, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: with DVC. In “Ours*”, the auto-regressive entropy model  is incorporated in our RaFC framework to further improve the video compression performance.\nWe use the traditional compression methods H.264 [ref]32, H.265  and the state-of-the-art learning-based compression methods, including DVC , AD_ICCV [ref]9, AH_ICCV  and CW_ECCV [ref]33 for performance comparison.\nIt is noted that CW_ECCV [ref]33\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
