      "content": "Paper Title: A Formal Language Approach to Explaining RNNsThe source code is available at https://github.com/bishwamittra/LEXR\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we evaluate the explanatory capabilities of LEXR and compare it to the current state-of-the-art explanation method of Mayr and Yovine , which produces explanations in terms of DFAs.\nTo this end, we have implemented a Python prototype based on the LTL learning algorithm by Neider and Gavran [ref]26.\nMoreover, we have modified Mayr and Yovine’s method such that it can handle queries.\nTo simplify the implementation of the verifier, we did not use the dynamic programming solution described in Section 4.1 but a similar technique based on a translation of LTL into DFAs .\nBoth implementations use the same verifier (though Mayr and Yovine’s method also asks for the classification of individual test inputs). Since assessing the quality of an explanation is difficult (as we do not know one), we use a statistical test that computes the accuracy of an explanation on a separate test set T⊂Σ∗𝑇superscriptΣ∗T\\subset\\Sigma^{\\ast}.\nSlightly deviating from the standard definition, we define accuracy as the fraction of words u∈T𝑢𝑇u\\in T that satisfy u∈L​(φ)𝑢𝐿𝜑u\\in L(\\varphi) if and only if u∈L​(ℛ)∩L​(ψ)𝑢𝐿ℛ𝐿𝜓u\\in L(\\mathcal{R})\\cap L(\\psi) (i.e., φ𝜑\\varphi and ℛℛ\\mathcal{R} agree).\nTo determine whether an LTL formula is easier or harder to interpret as a DFA, we compare their sizes (i.e., number of sub-formulas and states), following the principle “smaller is easier to interpret“ typically used in the literature    [ref]26 . We have conducted experiments with six different RNN acceptors, three RNN acceptors for synthetic languages and three RNN acceptors for real-word problems (valid email addresses , an alternating bit protocol , and words of balanced parentheses ).\nWe here report summaries of our experiments on two RNN acceptors for synthetic languages and one for the language of balanced parentheses. Details for all experiments can be found in the Appendix. We have conducted our experiments on an Intel Xeon E7-8857 v2 CPU with 48 cores and 1.51.51.5 TB of RAM running on a 64bit Linux distribution based on Debian.\nWe have set ε𝜀\\varepsilon and δ𝛿\\delta to 0.050.050.05 and the timeout to 400400400 s.\nSince the verifier implements a probabilistic algorithm, we have repeated each experiment 250250250 times and report an average of all numerical quantities.222\nAlthough we assume the RNN acceptors to be black-boxes, we briefly provide information about their training.\nAll RNNs were LSTM networks with 333 layers and 101010 hidden units, while the linear classifier was a linear threshold function with threshold 0.50.50.5.\nFor each synthetic (real-world) problem, we have generated 6,00060006,000 (20,0002000020,000) random words and split them into training and test sets with an 8:2:828:2 ratio.\nWe used the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0010.0010.001 and a stopping threshold of 0.0050.0050.005 to train the networks.\nOn the test set, the RNN acceptors have achieved more than 99.9%percent99.999.9\\% accuracy.\n Synthetic Benchmarks  \nWe have trained two RNN acceptors for the languages 𝖥⁡(a)𝖥𝑎\\operatorname{\\mathsf{F}}(a) and 𝖥⁡(a∧𝖷⁡b)𝖥𝑎𝖷𝑏\\operatorname{\\mathsf{F}}(a\\land\\operatorname{\\mathsf{X}}b) over the alphabet Σ={a,b,c}Σ𝑎𝑏𝑐\\Sigma=\\{a,b,c\\}, respectively.\nFor each problem, we have considered four simple queries, as shown in Table 1.\nThis table also shows the averaged results of LEXR as well as one explanation that has an accuracy close to the average accuracy of all 250250250 repetitions.\nFor explanations in form of DFAs, we report the average results as well. If the query is true (⊤top\\top), the explanation has to describe the language of the RNN acceptor.\nIn contrast, when the query is false (⊥bottom\\bot), the explanation should be false as well.\nIn all synthetic benchmarks, we have found the LTL explanations to be 100%percent100100\\% accurate for these two queries.\nIn fact, we observe that LEXR produced an explanation with 100%percent100100\\% accuracy for all but one query.\nThe average accuracy, size of explanations, and running times are slightly in favor of LEXR.\nHowever, there is one case where the DFA explanation has a higher average accuracy than the LTL explanation: for the language 𝖥⁡(a∧𝖷⁡(b))𝖥𝑎𝖷𝑏\\operatorname{\\mathsf{F}}(a\\wedge\\operatorname{\\mathsf{X}}(b)) and the query 𝖥⁡(c)𝖥𝑐\\operatorname{\\mathsf{F}}(c), the DFA has on average 43.743.743.7 states with 99%percent9999\\% accuracy, whereas the LTL explanation has on average a size of 6.96.96.9 with 56.9%percent56.956.9\\% accuracy. Let us now analyze one query in detail.\nFor the language 𝖥⁡a𝖥𝑎\\operatorname{\\mathsf{F}}a and the query 𝖥⁡(b)𝖥𝑏\\operatorname{\\mathsf{F}}(b), the learned (and expected) LTL explanation is 𝖥⁡(a)∧𝖥⁡(b)𝖥𝑎𝖥𝑏\\operatorname{\\mathsf{F}}(a)\\wedge\\operatorname{\\mathsf{F}}(b).\nThe average size of this explanation is 555 and its accuracy is 100%percent100100\\%.\nLEXR has on average taken around 13.513.513.5 s for this explanation (11.111.111.1 s for the learner and 2.42.42.4 s for the verifier), and the verifier has generated a total of around 1,40014001,400 random words before it certifies the PAC-guarantee.\nIn contrast, Mayr and Yovine’s method takes on average 218218218 s and generates a DFA with 27.327.327.3 states with 98.5%percent98.598.5\\% accuracy. Balanced Parentheses  \nFor this benchmark, the RNN acceptor is trained to predict whether a word has balanced parentheses or not.\nWe have used the alphabet Σ={l,r,a}Σ𝑙𝑟𝑎\\Sigma=\\{l,r,a\\} where l𝑙l and r𝑟r are placeholders for the left parenthesis “(” and the right parenthesis “)”, respectively, and a𝑎a stands for non-parenthesis symbols.\nFor our evaluation, we have considered twelve queries, which define different valid and invalid properties of balanced parentheses: The results of LEXR and Mayr and Yovine’s method are shown in Figure 2.\nAs can be seen from the bar plot on the left, LEXR produces explanation with 100%percent100100\\% accuracy in nine out of twelve cases—in the remaining three, the average accuracy is still greater than 50%percent5050\\%.\nMoreover, for nine queries, the average accuracy of the LTL explanations was greater than the one of the DFAs.\nMayr and Yovine’s method, on the other hand, was able to learn more accurate DFAs for three of the twelve queries. The bar plot in the center of Figure 2 shows the size of the generated explanations.\nLEXR’s LTL explanations were relatively small.\nThe largest explanation was of size 888.\nOn the other hand, the DFA explanations of Mayr and Yovine’s method were comparatively large.\nIn fact, all DFAs had an average of 444444 or more states, making them arguably challenging to interpret. Finally, the running times of both methods are shown in the right bar plot of Figure 2.\nFor three queries, LEXR always times out and produces explanations with an average accuracy of 54%percent5454\\%.\nFor the remaining nine queries, however, LEXR is on average significantly faster than Mayr and Yovine’s method (note the logarithmic axis) and produces explanations with 100%percent100100\\% accuracy. Summary  \nOur experimental results show a similar pattern for all other RNNs (discussed in the Appendix).\nIn total, we observed that LEXR is able to generate human-interpretable explanations for a variety of different RNN acceptors and queries.\nIts explanations are comparable to the explanations of Mayr and Yovine’s method in terms of average accuracy.\nHowever, LEXR’s explanations are on average much smaller and, hence, easier to interpret.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: explanation method of Mayr and Yovine , which produces explanations in terms of DFAs.\nTo this end, we have implemented a Python prototype based on the LTL learning algorithm by Neider and Gavran [ref]26.\nMoreover, we have modified Mayr and Yovine’s method such that it can handle queries.\nTo simplify the implementation of the verifier, we did not use the dynamic programming solution described\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
