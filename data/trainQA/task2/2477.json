      "content": "Paper Title: Greedy Gradient Ensemble for Robust Visual Question Answering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVisual Question Answering (VQA) is a challenging task that requires both language-aware reasoning and image understanding. With advances in deep learning, neural networks         that model the correlations between vision and language have shown remarkable results on large-scale benchmark datasets  [ref]15  . However, recent studies have demonstrated that most VQA methods tend to rely on existing idiosyncratic biases in the datasets [ref]15  .\nThey often leverage superficial correlations between questions and answers to train the model without considering exact vision information. For example, a model may blindly answer “tennis” for the question “What sports …” just based on the most common textual QA pairs in the train set. Unfortunately, models exploiting statistical shortcuts\nduring training often show poor generalization ability to out-of-domain data, and hardly provide proper visual evidence for a certain answer. Currently, the prevailing solutions for this problem can be categorized into ensemble-based 9 [ref]7 , grounding-based [ref]44   and counterfactual-based . Similar to re-weighting and re-sampling strategies in traditional long-tailed classification    2, ensemble-based methods re-weight the samples by the question-only branch. Grounding-based models stress a better use of image information according to human-annotated visual explanation  . Newly proposed counterfactual-based methods  4 further combine these two lines of work and achieve better performance. Nevertheless, it has been shown that existing methods have not fully leveraged both vision and language information.\nFor example, Shrestha et al.  argue that improved accuracy in grounding-based methods [ref]44  does not actually emerge from proper visual grounding but some unknown regularization effects.\nSimilar to , we further analyse all the three categories of existing work by control experiments in Section 3.2.\nWe found that language bias in VQA is actually two-fold: (a) the statistical distribution gap between train and test, i.e., distribution bias shown in Figure 1(a), and (b) the semantic correlation between specific QA pairs, i.e., shortcut bias shown in Figure 1(b).\nAlthough long-tailed distribution in train set is usually considered to be one of the factors that increase shortcut bias, we experimentally demonstrate that they are actually two aspects of the language bias. Grounding supervision in [ref]44 or ensemble regularization in [ref]7  does not necessarily force the model to focus on visual information as expected. To encourage the model to pay attention to the images, we need to explicitly model bothbiases and reduce them step by step. Inspired by our empirical findings, we propose Greedy Gradient Ensemble (GGE), a model-agnostic debias framework that ensembles biased models and the base model like gradient descent in functional space. The key idea of our method is to make use of the over-fitting phenomenon in deep learning. The biased part of data is greedily over-fitted by biased features, as a result, the expected base model can be learned with more ideal data distribution and focus on examples that are hard to solve with biased models. In the experiments, variants of GGE models are provided in ablation study, which demonstrates the generalization ability of our method and further supports our claim that distribution bias and shortcut bias are complementary in VQA. To verify if a model can really use visual information for the answer decision, we further study the language bias in VQA from a visual modelling perspective. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that GGE can provide better visual evidence accompanied with predictions. The major contributions are: We provide analysis for the language bias in VQA task and decompose the language bias into distribution bias and shortcut bias. We propose a new model-agnostic de-bias framework Greedy Gradient Ensemble (GGE), which sequentially ensembles biased models for robust VQA. On VQA-CP, our method makes better use of visual information and achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 17.34%percent17.3417.34\\% gain against simple UpDn baseline without extra annotations.
