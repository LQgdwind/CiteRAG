      "content": "Paper Title: pNNCLR: Stochastic Pseudo Neighborhoods for Contrastive Learning based Unsupervised Representation Learning Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAlthough, pretext based methods achieved good representations, however, Misra et al. showed that they all followed a covariant style of modeling . Misra et al. advocated the superiority of an invariant style of modeling over a covariant. Their work sits between non-contrastive and contrastive SSL methods. The main contribution is the noise contrastive estimation formulation which involves the generation of positive and negative pairs using the Jigsaw objective [ref]12. Contrastive SSL methods differ in their approach by including the pretext task in the model architecture itself in the form of augmentations. Additionally, the model objective changes from equivariance (where the model tries to adjust itself according to the variation in input) to invariance (where the model ignores the changes in the input in order to become agnostic to those transformations). To be specific, the SSL supervision signal is derived by enforcing the equivalence of multiple views of the same input image [ref]10.\nOne such initial work by Oord et al. proposed Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) for unsupervised representation learning 4. They applied noise contrastive loss (NCL) over future predictions in latent space of auto-regressive models for speech, text, and images. An important aspect of their NCL formulation was inclusion of negative samples.\nLater it was picked up and improved by Chen et al. [ref]10. They proposed a simple contrastive learning approach in which they emphasized on compositions in data augmentation, role of non-linear transformations in top layers, and larger batch size.\nHe et al. proposed the idea of dictionary look-up by maintaining a dictionary of encoded keys as negatives for contrastive learning . This allowed keeping a larger set than the batch size as negatives. Similar to He et al., Girll et al. proposed online and target network based contrastive learning where the target network avoids direct gradient flow and takes updates from the online network . They also showed that the setup does not require negative samples for training the network.\nTo reduce the overall computation in contrastive SSL methods, Caron et al. proposed to avoid pairwise comparisons by employing online clustering of the representations and by enforcing consistency in cluster assignments of representations corresponding to different views of the same sample .\nChen et al. refined the contrastive SSL aspects of previous works . They trained a Siamese network with contrastive loss but without negative sample pairs and without large batch sizes. They avoided trivial solutions and attained competitive performance by avoiding gradient propagation in one of the branches of the Siamese network.\nCaron et al. proposed a self-supervised knowledge distillation approach called DINO . They showed that vision transformers learn better semantic segmentation and k-NN features than CNNs.\nGoyal et al. validated the contemporary contrastive SSL approaches in the wild by training with one billion random images .\nYeh et al. proposed decoupling the positive samples from the denominator of the InfoNCE contrastive loss to remove the negative-positive-coupling effect in contrastive SSL methods .\nZhang et al. introduced query patches for contrasting in addition to global contrasting .\nNearest neighbor based methods like   emphasized increasing semantic variation by sampling the nearest neighbors in the latent space. The proposed work is similar in spirit to the nearest neighbor sampling based works.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: and contrastive SSL methods.
