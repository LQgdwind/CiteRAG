      "content": "Paper Title: A Graph-based Methodology for the Sensorless Estimation of Road Traffic Profiles\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOne of the main goals of traffic management is to provide a safe traffic infrastructure, where most of the potential traffic congestion scenarios and car collisions are avoided. This issue can be addressed by modeling the traffic behavior of the road network and by developing predictive methods that allow forecasting metrics that characterize traffic, such as flow, speed, or travel time . This process enables the implementation of operational measures for decision making (e.g., redirecting traffic flow to other alternative routes). These traffic forecasting models are usually built from past traffic observations. However, in practice traffic data acquisition systems cannot be deployed over every link of a road, mainly due to the high costs of deployment and maintenance of such sensing equipment. On many occasions this issue has been addressed by deploying temporal sensors that provide measurements for certain locations of interest during a limited period of time. Nevertheless, a proper characterization of the traffic behavior under a variety of circumstances (e.g., events or holidays) requires real traffic measurements over more dilated periods [ref]2. Thus, real traffic data are not available for every road link, nor are they collected for the time needed for a thorough characterization. Indeed, in some cases placing a sensor is not feasible due to manifold reasons. If possible, another concern arises from the long latency needed to collect sufficient data for the subsequent model training. Since the performance of traffic forecasting models is constrained to both data quality and quantity, data availability is arguably the practical bottleneck for a successful traffic network characterization. For those scenarios where data are available, a glance at the state-of-the-art reveals that the community is close to the upper bound in terms of model-based improvements, whereas data quality is acknowledged to be the key for more accurate predictions [ref]3. In the context of traffic modeling, data quality  can be regarded in the form of anomaly absence. Some of the most widely observed anomalies include missing traffic records, or data aggregation failures that produce outliers shaped as spikes over the traffic time series. These anomalies are strongly influenced by the sensing technique in use. On one hand, Roadside Car Data (RCD) is obtained by deploying sensors at particular locations of the traffic network, such as inductive loops or traffic cameras. These sensors continuously capture the traffic flow or mean speed at the point where they are deployed. On the other hand, Floating Car Data (FCD) refers to traffic measurements of individually tracked vehicles, via devices with positioning sensors (e.g., GPS). This type of data can provide more precise traffic measurements. However, the processing pipeline needed for modeling them effectively poses several challenges, such as i) the segmentation of distinct travel modes, as subjects often mix them over the same trip; ii) human-induced mistakes during the data annotation process; and iii) intrinsic precision errors of the positioning sensor. The deployment and maintenance costs of RCD, together with the concerns associated to FCD, restrict the number of public traffic datasets that ensure an acceptable level of data quality and enough time span to cover traffic profiles occurring along the year. As a result, the community often resorts to a reduced collection of datasets (with above-average data quality and time coverage) for research and industrial purposes [ref]3. Examples of these popular data repositories are the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) data source , the Beijing Q-Traffic dataset [ref]6, or the Los Angeles County highway (METR-LA) data source . Unfortunately, building predictive models from a limited collection of datasets is a trend that leads to scarce insights beyond those that have already been given in the prior literature. When it comes to model benchmarks where the goal is to design a top-leading traffic predictive method (in the form of a new model architecture or data preprocessing technique ), the selection of well-known datasets eases the reproducibility of the results, ensures the transparency of the reported performance scores, and stimulate follow-up studies departing therefrom. However, from a practical point of view there are no better traffic datasets than those collected over the same traffic network where the forecasting system is aimed to. Thus, generative methods and simulators can provide synthetic traffic datasets tailored for the same context as the target location. In summary, the nature of RCD and FCD limits the disposal of traffic data at every point of a traffic network. In turn, simulators are hard to adjust, and without a precise configuration real-world factors that influence traffic can not be modeled. Nevertheless, synthetic data can be used by traffic managers to extract insights from locations of the traffic network where no sensors can be deployed, nor simulations can be performed.\n Partly inspired by the findings of , in this work we present a novel method that allows to find a road segment with a similar traffic behavior in relation to a non-sensed road segment. In this context, no traffic data is available at the target road, so the only information that can be used to make the selection has to be extracted from the design of the traffic network and other circumstantial information that can be extracted from its context. Under the concept of road feature embedding, we design a set of features that attempt to characterize each road segment, based on the topology and context of the area and the domain-specific knowledge about the behavior of traffic flows in similar urban areas to the ones under study. Our hypothesis is that locations with similar topological and contextual features (and thus, road feature embeddings) are more likely to share traffic patterns. It can be expected that a secondary road has a higher traffic flow than a residential avenue (and vice versa). The design of the traffic map itself determines the capacity of each road and influences how drivers behave when driving therethrough. However, the number of lanes and road type are not the unique traits that affect the traffic profile of a certain road segment: the location and connections to other road segments can also bias its traffic profile. Intuitively two avenues sharing the same road type, number of lanes and other topological characteristics (e.g., lane width) might display different traffic flow measurements depending on which other roads they are connected to. They can receive traffic from main arterial roads, but also residential areas. Two equally designed parallel roads can exhibit opposite traffic profiles, where one presents congestion during the morning commute to work, and so does the other road in the afternoon. Human intuition and experts in traffic management can produce estimates of the traffic behavior to a point where a person can produce its own congestion predictions towards selecting the best route during a city trip. In essence, the main goal of this work is to translate this knowledge into a numeric vector (namely, a road feature embedding), so road segments of similar traffic profiles can be found without comparing traffic measurements, but the aforementioned expert knowledge-driven features instead. Our analysis is supported by a collection of 55 Automatic Traffic Readers (ATR) deployed at the city of Madrid, Spain, providing traffic patterns of distinct shape and scale. However, while delving into the process of finding road segments with analogous daily traffic profiles, a research question arises: if the chosen dataset already has a similar traffic profile, is a generative approach really needed? Real traffic flow recordings can be extracted from the selected data source, and employed as if it was measured at the target location. On this premise, we conduct a study to analyze the benefits and downsides of using generative data methods against directly using the traffic recordings from the selected datasets as estimations for the target location. Finally, we examine the limitations of the presented road feature embedding selection method. The main contributions of our work can be summarized as follows:\n We design a set of graph-based features that characterize road segments, based on their topological and contextual characteristics. This road feature embedding allows spotting roads that are expected to have similar traffic patterns, without any need for traffic data collected in the location of interest. The definition of such road feature embeddings heavily relies on intuition and domain-specific knowledge about the behavior of traffic flows under different circumstances. This clear match between knowledge and features contributes to the trustworthiness and actionability of traffic estimates predicted therefrom, which are essential in real-world traffic management decision making processes. We experimentally compare the performance of a similarity-based traffic estimation method relying on the aforementioned embeddings to that of a naïve selection based on geographical proximity, where the nearest road segment with collected traffic data is used for estimation. Remarkably, the algorithmic transparency of the traffic estimation process using similarities computed over the aforementioned road embeddings adds to the overall reliability and trustworthiness of the methodology and produced estimates by traffic managers. We explore and comparatively evaluate different options to synthesize traffic data for the location of interest: 1) training a generative adversarial network (GAN) that models the multiple distributions of the selected traffic dataset; 2) clustering traffic samples according to certain criteria and provide as the output a representative traffic pattern; and 3) taking as estimation the real traffic data from the selected road segment. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II reviews those works that analyze the topological and contextual influence on the traffic profile and delve into the capabilities of graph embedding methods for representing traffic networks. Section III defines the features that conform the road feature embedding, how these embeddings are compared, the distinct generative approaches and the techniques employed for result assessment. The experiments to be conducted are described in Section IV. Here, the results steamed from such analyses are exposed and commented. To finish, Section V summarizes obtained insights and outlines future research paths stemming from this work.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: of time.
