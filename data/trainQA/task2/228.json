      "content": "Paper Title: Heavy-tailed Representations, Text Polarity Classification & Data Augmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRepresenting the meaning of natural language in a mathematically grounded way is a scientific challenge that has received increasing attention with the explosion of digital content and text data in the last decade. Relying on the richness of contents, several embeddings have been proposed  [ref]46 9 with demonstrated efficiency for the considered tasks when learnt on massive datasets. However, none of these embeddings take into account the fact that word frequency distributions are heavy tailed   , so that extremes are naturally present in texts (see also Fig. 6(a) and 6(b) in the supplementary material). Similarly,  shows that, contrary to image taxonomies, the underlying distributions for words and documents in large scale textual taxonomies are also heavy tailed. Exploiting this information, several studies, as  9, were able to improve text mining applications by accurately modeling the tails of textual elements. \nIn this work, we rely on the framework of multivariate extreme value analysis, based on extreme value theory (EVT) which focuses on the distributional tails.\nEVT is valid under a regularity assumption which amounts to a homogeneity property above large thresholds: the tail behavior of the considered variables must be well approximated by a power law, see Section 2 for a rigorous statement. The tail region (where samples are considered as extreme) of the input variable x∈ℝd𝑥superscriptℝ𝑑x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d} is of the kind {‖x‖≥t}norm𝑥𝑡\\{\\|x\\|\\geq t\\}, for a large threshold t𝑡t. The latter is typically chosen such that a small but non negligible proportion of the data is considered as extreme, namely 25%percent2525\\% in our experiments.\nA major advantage of this framework in the case of labeled data 1 is that classification on the tail regions\nmay be performed using the angle Θ​(x)=‖x‖−1​xΘ𝑥superscriptnorm𝑥1𝑥\\Theta(x)=\\|x\\|^{-1}x only, see Figure 1. The main idea behind the present paper is to take advantage of the scale invariance for two tasks regarding sentiment analysis of text data: (i) Improved classification of extreme inputs, (ii) Label preserving data augmentation, as the most probable label of an input x𝑥x is unchanged by multiplying x𝑥x by λ>1𝜆1\\lambda>1. EVT in a machine learning framework has received increasing attention in the past few years. Learning tasks considered so far include anomaly detection    4 , anomaly clustering , unsupervised learning 3, online learning  , dimension reduction and support identification 5  0 0. The present paper builds upon the methodological framework proposed by Jalalzai et al. 1 for classification in extreme regions.\nThe goal of Jalalzai et al. 1 is to improve the performance of classifiers g^​(x)^𝑔𝑥\\widehat{g}(x) issued from Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) on the tail regions {‖x‖>t}norm𝑥𝑡\\{\\|x\\|>t\\} Indeed, they argue that for very large t𝑡t, there is no guarantee that g^^𝑔\\widehat{g} would perform well conditionally to {‖X‖>t}norm𝑋𝑡\\{\\|X\\|>t\\}, precisely because of the scarcity of such examples in the training set. They thus propose to train a specific classifier dedicated to extremes leveraging the probabilistic structure of the tails. Jalalzai et al. 1 demonstrate the usefulness of their framework with simulated and some real world datasets. However, there is no reason to assume that the previously mentioned text embeddings satisfy the required regularity assumptions.\nThe aim of the present work is to extend 1’s methodology to datasets which do not satisfy their assumptions, in particular to text datasets embedded by state of the art techniques. This is achieved by the algorithm Learning a Heavy Tailed Representation (in short LHTR) which learns a transformation mapping the input data X𝑋X onto a random vector Z𝑍Z which does satisfy the aforementioned assumptions.\nThe transformation is learnt by an adversarial strategy 7. In Appendix C we propose an interpretation of the extreme nature of an input in both LHTR and BERT representations. In a word, these sequences are longer and are more difficult to handle (for next token prediction and classification tasks) than non extreme ones. Our second contribution is a novel data augmentation mechanism GENELIEX  which takes advantage of the scale invariance properties of Z𝑍Z to generate synthetic sequences that keep invariant the attribute of the original sequence. Label preserving data augmentation is an effective solution to the data scarcity problem and is an efficient pre-processing step for moderate dimensional datasets\n . Adapting these methods to NLP problems remains a challenging issue. The problem consists in constructing a transformation hℎh such that for any sample x𝑥x with label y​(x)𝑦𝑥y(x), the generated sample h​(x)ℎ𝑥h(x) would remain label consistent:\ny​(h​(x))=y​(x)𝑦ℎ𝑥𝑦𝑥~{}y\\big{(}h(x)\\big{)}=y(x) .\nThe dominant approaches for text data augmentation rely on word level transformations such as synonym replacement, slot filling, swap deletion  using external resources such as wordnet . Linguistic based approaches can also be combined with vectorial representations provided by language models 3. However, to the best of our knowledge, building a vectorial transformation without using any external linguistic resources remains an open problem.\nIn this work, as the label y​(h​(x))𝑦ℎ𝑥y\\big{(}h(x)\\big{)}\nis unknown as soon as h​(x)ℎ𝑥h(x) does not belong to the training set, we address this issue by learning\nboth an embedding φ𝜑\\varphi and a classifier g𝑔g satisfying a relaxed version of the problem above mentioned, namely ∀λ≥1for-all𝜆1\\forall\\lambda\\geq 1 For mathematical reasons which will appear clearly in Section 2.2, hλsubscriptℎ𝜆h_{\\lambda} is chosen as the homothety with scale factor λ𝜆\\lambda, hλ​(x)=λ​xsubscriptℎ𝜆𝑥𝜆𝑥h_{\\lambda}(x)=\\lambda x.\nIn this paper, we work with output vectors issued by BERT 9.\nBERT and its variants are currently the most widely used language model but we emphasize that the proposed methodology could equally be applied using any other representation as input.\nBERT embedding does not satisfy the regularity properties required by EVT (see the results from statistical tests performed in Appendix B.5) Besides, there is no reason why a classifier g𝑔g trained on such embedding would be scale invariant, i.e. would satisfy for a given sequence u𝑢u, embedded as x𝑥x, g​(hλ​(x))=g​(x)𝑔subscriptℎ𝜆𝑥𝑔𝑥g(h_{\\lambda}(x))=g(x) ∀λ≥1for-all𝜆1\\forall\\lambda\\geq 1.\nOn the classification task, we demonstrate on two datasets of sentiment analysis that the embedding learnt by LHTR on top of BERT is indeed following a heavy-tailed distribution. Besides, a classifier trained on the embedding learnt by LHTR outperforms the same classifier trained on BERT. On the dataset augmentation task, quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the ability of GENELIEX  to generate new sequences while preserving labels. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the necessary background in multivariate extremes. The methodology we propose is detailed at length in Section 3. Illustrative numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data are gathered in sections 4\nand 5.
