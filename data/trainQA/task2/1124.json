      "content": "Paper Title: Quasiconformal Model with CNN Features for Large Deformation Image Registration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOver the past several decades, image registration has been extensively studied (see [ref]7 [ref]38   for detailed surveys). In , Horn and Schunck presented a method for registering images using optical flow. In , Johnson and Christensen proposed a method for consistent landmark and intensity-based image registration using thin-plate spline (TPS) . In , Beg et al. proposed the large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) algorithm for image warping. Joshi and Miller  used large deformation diffeomorphisms for matching landmarks. Other publicly available image registration tools include Elastix , deformable image registration using discrete optimization (DROP) [ref]18, flexible algorithms for image registration (FAIR)  etc. Diffeomorphic Demons (DDemons), developed by Vercauteren et al. , is a well-known non-parametric diffeomorphic image registration method stemming from the work of Thirion . By combining DDemons and quasiconformal theory, Lam and Lui  proposed the quasiconformal hybrid registration (QCHR) method that reduces the local geometric distortion of the registration map. The QCHR method has been successfully applied to different registration and shape analysis tasks 0 . However, in case manual landmark labeling is not available and the main features in the input images do not overlap, these methods may not work well. More specifically, if there is little or no overlap of the features in the source image and the target image, these methods will only shrink the features and yield a meaningless registration map. Therefore, these methods can only handle large deformation image registration with the presence of prescribed landmarks.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Over the past several decades, image registration has been extensively studied (see [ref]7 [ref]38   for detailed surveys).

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
