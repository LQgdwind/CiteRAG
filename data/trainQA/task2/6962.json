      "content": "Paper Title: Graph Self-Contrast Representation Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAccording to the contrast mode,\ngraph contrastive learning can be mainly divided into three categories:\nnode-node contrast,\nnode-graph contrast and graph-graph contrast. For\nnode-node contrast,\nthe representative model GRACE  first generates two contrastive views of a graph via graph augmentation, and then pulls close the representations of samples in positive pairs while pushing away that of samples in inter-view and intra-view negative pairs.\nGCA [ref]29 further introduces\nan adaptive augmentation by incorporating various priors for topological and semantic aspects of the graph, which results in a more competitive performance. GCC  utilizes random walk\nas augmentations to extract the contextual information.\nBGRL  maximizes the MI between node representations from online and target networks. There also exist methods [ref]2 2    that are based on node-graph contrast.\nFor example,\nDGI [ref]2\nlearns both local and global semantic information in graphs by\ncontrasting node-level embeddings with the graph-level representation.\nAfter that,\nGIC 2 seeks to\nadditionally capture cluster-level information\nby first\nclustering nodes\nbased on their embeddings,\nand then maximizing the MI between nodes in the same cluster.\nMVGRL  first generates two graph views via graph diffusion\nand subgraph sampling.\nThen it trains graph encoders\nby\ncontrasting node embeddings in a view and the graph-level representation in another view.\nFurther,\nSUBG-CON \nuses\ntriplet loss as objective function.\nFor each node,\nit first extracts\nthe top-k most informative neighbors\nto form a subgraph.\nThen it pulls close the distance\nbetween\nthe representations of\nthe node and the subgraph,\nand pushes away that between the representations of the node and a randomly selected subgraph. The third type of methods are\nbased on\ngraph-graph contrast.\nThe early model\nGraphCL \ndesigns four types of graph augmentation\n(node dropping, edge perturbation, attribute masking and subgraph extraction),\nand then\nadopts\nthe NT-Xent loss to\nlearn the graph-level representation.\nFurther,\nJOAO 5 proposes a unified bi-level optimization framework to automatically select data augmentations.\nAD-GCL 6 uses adversarial graph augmentation strategies that enables GNNs to avoid capturing redundant information during training.\nInspired by\nInvariant Rationale Discovery (IRD),\nRGCL  puts forward rationale-aware augmentations for graph contrastive learning to preserve the critical information in the graph.\nThere are also methods that do not need data augmentations.\nFor example,\nSimGRACE  feeds the original graph into a GNN encoder and achieves data augmentation through perturbation of the encoder.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: views of a graph via graph augmentation, and then pulls close the representations of samples in positive pairs while pushing away that of samples in inter-view and intra-view negative pairs.\nGCA [ref]29 further introduces\nan adaptive augmentation by incorporating various priors for topological and semantic aspects of the graph, which results in a more competitive performance.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
