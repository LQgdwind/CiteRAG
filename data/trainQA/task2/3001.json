Here, comparisons\nrefer to testing the signs of constant-degree polynomial functions on a constant\nnumber of the input real numbers. It was observed  that for\nHopcroft’s problem, improved (nonuniform) decision tree bounds would automatically imply improved (uniform) time bounds,\nbecause after\na constant number of levels of Matoušek’s recursion , the\ninput size can be made so tiny (e.g., o​(log⁡log⁡log⁡n)𝑜𝑛o(\\log\\log\\log n)) that we can afford\nto precompute the entire decision tree for such tiny inputs.\n(In the algorithms literature, there are other examples of problems for which time complexity\nhas been shown to be equivalent to decision tree complexity, such as matrix searching  and\nminimum spanning trees . There are also examples of problems\nfor which polylogarithmic speedups of algorithms were obtained by first\nconsidering the decision tree complexity, such as\nall-pairs shortest paths ,\n3SUM , and\nat least one other problem in computational geometry [ref]17.) In a seminal work, Fredman  showed that M𝑀M\nvalues can be sorted using just O​(M)𝑂𝑀O(M) comparisons instead of O​(M​log⁡M)𝑂𝑀𝑀O(M\\log M), under certain scenarios when the values\n“originate from” a smaller set of numbers. For example, the x𝑥x-coordinates\nof the O​(n2)𝑂superscript𝑛2O(n^{2}) intersections of a set of n𝑛n lines can be sorted using\nO​(n2)𝑂superscript𝑛2O(n^{2}) comparisons , since these O​(n2)𝑂superscript𝑛2O(n^{2}) values come from O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) real numbers.\n(Another example from Fredman’s original paper is the well-known X+Y𝑋𝑌X+Y sorting problem, although for the decision tree complexity of that particular problem, simpler  and better  methods were later found.)\nWe show that this type of result is not limited to the sorting problem alone,\nand that logarithmic-factor shavings in the decision tree setting are actually\nnot difficult to obtain for many other problems,\nincluding point location of multiple query points in multiple subdivisions,\nassuming that\nthe query points and subdivision vertices originate from O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) real numbers.\nThe improvement for Hopcroft’s problem then follows.\nThe technique works beyond 2D and is more general than fractional cascading\n(which requires the subdivisions to be organized in the form of a bounded-degree\ntree or dag). In Appendix 7, we mention applications of our framework to the decision tree complexities of other problems, although for these problems, we do not get improvements in time\ncomplexities.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: speedups of algorithms were obtained by first\nconsidering the decision tree complexity, such as\nall-pairs shortest paths ,\n3SUM , and\nat least one other problem in computational geometry [ref]17.)
