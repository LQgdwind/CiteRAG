      "content": "Paper Title: Structure and Independence in Hyperbolic Uniform Disk Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe can directly use our clique-based separator to compute independent sets and prove Corollary 1 via a simple divide-and conquer algorithm as in Corollary 2.4 of [ref]3. In our case, we use the trivial bound of n𝑛n on the size of the cliques in Theorem 1, which means that the weight of each clique in the separator is at most log⁡(n+1)𝑛1\\log(n+1). Consequently, the separator’s weight is at most 𝒪​((1+1/r)​log2⁡n)𝒪11𝑟superscript2𝑛\\mathcal{O}((1+1/r)\\log^{2}n). The proof of Corollary 1 now follows that of Corollary 2.4 of [ref]3, we merely replace the separator weight 𝒪​(n1−1/d)𝒪superscript𝑛11𝑑\\mathcal{O}(n^{1-1/d}) with 𝒪​((1+1/r)​log2⁡n)𝒪11𝑟superscript2𝑛\\mathcal{O}((1+1/r)\\log^{2}n). We give the proof for completeness. See 1 The algorithm works as follows: First, we find a balanced separator according to Theorem 1 in 𝒪​(n​log⁡n)𝒪𝑛𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n\\log n) time. We can then iterate over all possible intersections X𝑋X between a fixed optimum independent set and the separator. For every clique we can pick one of at most n𝑛n vertices, or nothing, so there are (n+1)𝒪​(1+1/r)​log⁡n=2𝒪​(1+1/r)​log2⁡nsuperscript𝑛1𝒪11𝑟𝑛superscript2𝒪11𝑟superscript2𝑛(n+1)^{\\mathcal{O}(1+1/r)\\log n}=2^{\\mathcal{O}(1+1/r)\\log^{2}n} options. For each of these possible intersections, we remove all disks intersecting X𝑋X, and recurse on both sides of the separator. The running time follows the recursion T​(n)=2𝒪​(1+1/r)​log2⁡n​T​(23​n)+n𝒪​(1)𝑇𝑛superscript2𝒪11𝑟superscript2𝑛𝑇23𝑛superscript𝑛𝒪1T(n)=2^{\\mathcal{O}(1+1/r)\\log^{2}n}T(\\frac{2}{3}n)+n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}. Denoting 2xsuperscript2𝑥2^{x} by exp2⁡(x)subscript2𝑥\\exp_{2}(x), we can unroll this as follows: This concludes the proof.\n∎ We note that the recursion added an extra logarithmic factor, which can be avoided via 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P}-flattened treewidth. We do not optimize this running time as the resulting algorithm would still be slower than that of Theorem 3. However, we do need to bound the 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P}-flattened treewidth for Corollary 1. Consider a graph G∈HUDG​(r)𝐺HUDG𝑟G\\in\\mathrm{HUDG}(r) where r∈𝒪​(1)𝑟𝒪1r\\in\\mathcal{O}(1), let C𝐶C be any clique of G𝐺G, and let s𝑠s be the center of some disk of C𝐶C. Then all other disk centers from C𝐶C are contained in a disk of radius 2​r2𝑟2r around s𝑠s. Since r∈𝒪​(1)𝑟𝒪1r\\in\\mathcal{O}(1), a disk of radius r𝑟r has area Θ​(r2)Θsuperscript𝑟2\\Theta(r^{2}), and the above argument shows that the union of the disks in C𝐶C occupy area Θ​(r2)Θsuperscript𝑟2\\Theta(r^{2}). We will now decompose ℍ2superscriptℍ2\\mathbb{H}^{2} into regions of diameter at most 2​r2𝑟2r such that each region has an inscribed disk of radius at least Ω​(r)Ω𝑟\\Omega(r). The following can be derived from Lemma 2.1 (ii) of [ref]28 and from Theorem 6 of . [see [ref]28 ]\n\nFor any δ∈𝒪​(1)𝛿𝒪1\\delta\\in\\mathcal{O}(1) there exists a subdivision of the hyperbolic plane into connected regions with the following properties: Each region has diameter less than δ𝛿\\delta and thus area 𝒪​(δ2)𝒪superscript𝛿2\\mathcal{O}(\\delta^{2}). Each region has an inscribed disk of radius Ω​(δ)Ω𝛿\\Omega(\\delta), and thus area Ω​(δ2)Ωsuperscript𝛿2\\Omega(\\delta^{2}), Moreover, the regions containing some given set of n𝑛n points can be computed in 𝒪​(n)𝒪𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n) time. We are now ready to prove Corollary 1. The proof merely needs to establish a clique partition 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} with a corresponding weighted treewidth bound, and the property that the graph G𝒫subscript𝐺𝒫G_{\\mathcal{P}} has maximum constant degree, that is, each clique of 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} has at most constantly many neighboring cliques. Then the machinery of [ref]3 yields the desired algorithms automatically. See 1 Use the subdivision of Lemma 7 with δ=2​r𝛿2𝑟\\delta=2r. We can define a clique-partition 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} of G𝐺G by putting disks in the same partition class whenever their centers fall in the same region of the subdivision. Clearly each created class induces a clique in G𝐺G as the disk centers have pairwise distance less or equal to the diameter of the region, which is at most 2​r2𝑟2r. Fix such a clique partition 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P}, and consider now a separator from Theorem 1. If X𝑋X is one of the cliques in the separator, then let pxsubscript𝑝𝑥p_{x} be the center of some disk of X𝑋X. If C∈𝒫𝐶𝒫C\\in\\mathcal{P} and X𝑋X contain disks that intersect each other, then the graph distance of any pair of disks in C𝐶C and X𝑋X is at most 333. Consequently, all disk centers in C∪X𝐶𝑋C\\cup X are covered by a disk D𝐷D of radius 3⋅2​r=6​r⋅32𝑟6𝑟3\\cdot 2r=6r around pxsubscript𝑝𝑥p_{x}. Since each region of 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} has area Ω​(r2)Ωsuperscript𝑟2\\Omega(r^{2}), there can be at most 𝒪​(1)𝒪1\\mathcal{O}(1) regions of the subdivision contained inside D𝐷D. In particular, X𝑋X can intersect at most 𝒪​(1)𝒪1\\mathcal{O}(1) cliques from 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P}. Consider all cliques from 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} that are intersected by the separator cliques of Theorem 1: they clearly form a separator, and the above argument shows that there are 𝒪​((1+1/r)​log⁡n)𝒪11𝑟𝑛\\mathcal{O}((1+1/r)\\log n) such cliques in 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P}. Since each clique of 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} has weight at most 1+log⁡n1𝑛1+\\log n, we get a separator of weight 𝒪​((1+1/r)​log2⁡n)𝒪11𝑟superscript2𝑛\\mathcal{O}((1+1/r)\\log^{2}n) over 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P}. Now [ref]3 (see also [ref]28) implies that the 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P}-flattened treewidth of G𝐺G is 𝒪​((1+1/r)​log2⁡n)𝒪11𝑟superscript2𝑛\\mathcal{O}((1+1/r)\\log^{2}n). Since 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} is a clique-partition with the additional property that each partition class is neighboring to 𝒪​(1)𝒪1\\mathcal{O}(1) other cliques, we can apply the entire machinery of [ref]3 and derive the required algorithms.\n∎\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: We can directly use our clique-based separator to compute independent sets and prove Corollary 1 via a simple divide-and conquer algorithm as in Corollary 2.4 of [ref]3.
