In particular, when taking a picture of a display, the moir√© pattern is caused by the misalignment between the grid of the display and the camera filter. Moir√© patterns that are not present in the original image can seriously degrade the image quality because of the shape that looks like a ripple, ribbon, or stripe and the color change. To restore the original image without moir√© pattern, previous literature¬† 3 4 [ref]5 5 6 [ref]2 7 1 delicately designed neural networks. DMCNN¬† is the first convolution neural network that uses hierarchical stages in order to remove various size moir√© patterns and releases a benchmark dataset for image demoir√©. MopNet¬†3 utilizes the properties of moir√© patterns such as scale, color, and shape. FDNet¬†5 predicts a clean image given image pairs, degraded by moir√© pattern and defocused moir√© free image. However, these two methods require additional input except for noisy image and clean image pairs.\nWDNet¬†[ref]5 and MBCNN¬†[ref]2 utilize frequency prior with wavelet transform and implicit Discrete Cosine Transform¬†(DCT)¬†8.\nHowever, these methods are still difficult to remove moir√© patterns clearly because they do not sufficiently leverage property of moir√© patterns in fourier domain.\nMRGAN¬†7 is an unsupervised method using Generative Adversarial Network¬†9 for removing this type of pattern. But, their model may not be able to restore the color of the original image or remove the artifacts because they did not use moir√© and clean image pairs during training.\nFHDe2superscriptùëí2e^{2}Net¬†4, ESDNet¬† are responsible for high-resolution image demoir√©. These two methods use multi-scale features for handling large-scale images and release high-resolution datasets.\nAnother explored research problem, video demoir√©¬†1, is the first work for restoring video using relation-based consistency loss.\nSince the moir√© patterns desaturate not only the color of the entire image but also make the shape of objects difficult to recognize, this method fails to completely recover the original color and fine-grained details. In this paper, we concentrate on the video demoir√© that is less explored in the former literature.\nOur proposed methods are the first works in demoir√© task to remove moir√© texture and recover the original color in the frequency domain using amplitude and phase. In addition, we design Post Align Module¬†(PAM) to leverage the neighboring frames as auxiliary information without disruption.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: degrade the image quality because of the shape that looks like a ripple, ribbon, or stripe and the color change.
