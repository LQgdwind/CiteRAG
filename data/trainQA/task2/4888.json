      "content": "Paper Title: Brand New K-FACs: Speeding up K-FAC with Online Decomposition Updates\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBy exploiting the EA construction paradigm of the K-factors, we proposed an online inverse-update to speed-up k-fac ([ref]1) for FC layers. If we use the update exclusively, we obtian the K-factor inverse representation in linear time scaling w.r.t.¬†layer size (as opposed to quadratic for r-kfacs [ref]3, and cubic for standard k-fac [ref]1, [ref]2). This update relied on Brand‚Äôs algorithm (), and we called it the ‚Äúb-update‚Äù (of K-factors inverses). We saw the update is useful only when dM>nM+rsubscriptùëëùëÄsubscriptùëõùëÄùëüd_{M}>n_{M}+r, which typically holds for FC layers. In these cases, we saw the b-update is exact, but only remains cheap if we constrain our approximate K-Factors representation to be (very) low-rank - which we practically achieved through an SVD-optimal rank-rùëür truncation just before each b-update. We argued that based on results presented in [ref]3, (EA) K-Factors typically have significant eigenspectrum decay, and thus a very low-rank approximation for them would actually have low error. We also saw that whenever we can apply the B-update, our inverse application technique can be improved to reduce time scaling from quadratic262626Or cubic for standard k-fac. in layer size (as for rs-kfac) down to linear. We did not implement this inverse application methodology in this paper however (this is future work). The b-update, together with the truncation, and the proposed inverse application technique gave b-kfac. The algorithm (b-kfac) is an approximate k-fac implementation for which the preconditioning part scales (over-all) linearly in layer size. Notably however, ‚Äúpure‚Äù b-kfac is only applicable to some layers (and we have to use rs-kfac for the others). Compared to quadratic scaling in layer size for rs-kfac () or cubic for k-fac ([ref]1, [ref]2), the improvement proposed here is a substantial improvement. Though there is no error guarantee bounding the b-kfac preconditioning error, we saw with numerical case-studies which revealed the b-kfac error was acceptable. We saw that the b-update, other than being used alone to give b-kfac, can also be combined with updates like rs-kfac updates (rsvd updates) to give different algorithms with different empirical properties. By comparing b-kfac with r-kfac (rs-kfac in [ref]3), we noted that we may be able to increase the K-Factor representation accuracy of b-kfac by adding in periodic rsvd ‚Äúoverwritings‚Äù, which gave the b-r-kfac algorithm. We saw that the b-r-kfac can also be seen as an r-kfac algorithm to which we introduce b-updates at times when no rsvd would have been performed, with the aim of better controlling the K-factor representation error, at minimal cost. We also noted we may change the rsvd-overwriting with a cheaper but less accurate ‚Äúcorrection‚Äù, in order to obtain customizable time-accuracy trade-offs, giving b-kfac-c. Numerical results concerning K-Factors errors show that our all our proposed algorithms (b-kfac, b-r-kfac, and b-kfac-c) had errors comparable to k-fac ([ref]1) while offering an ‚âà3√ó\\approx 3\\times speed-up per epoch. W.r.t.¬†the more competitive r-kfac ([ref]3), our proposed algorithms offered similar metrics but more trade-offs to choose from. Notably, b-r-kfac was significantly better than r-kfac - across all investigated error metrics at minimal computational overhead. Numerical results concerning optimization performance show b-kfac and b-kfac-c consistently outperform r-kfac (the best k-fac benchmark; [ref]3) by a moderate amount, while b-r-kfac only does so for relatively large target test accuracy. All our b-(‚ãÖ)‚ãÖ(\\cdot) algorithms outperform seng (the state of art; ) for low target test accuracy. Future work involves implementing the proposed inverse application methodology and re-running numerical experiments.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: By exploiting the EA construction paradigm of the K-factors, we proposed an online inverse-update to speed-up k-fac ([ref]1) for FC layers.
