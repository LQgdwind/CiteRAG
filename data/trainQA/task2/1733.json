Levine [ref]94 introduced a binary optimality variable that indicates whether the state and action at each time in the MDP are optimal and formulated the reward function as the probability for the optimality variable to take one (Fig. 5).\nIn the CaI framework, we can derive the entropy regularized expected reward objective by performing variational inference for the optimality variable at all times, from which we can derive the soft actor-critic (SAC) . In addition, we can derive an iterative planning method based on the inference of the plan, that is, a series of actions, instead of policy optimization, as in the SAC.  Okada and Taniguchi  demonstrated that the difference between various planning methods can be generalized as the choice of the posterior distribution in the inference of optimality variables.\nThis idea was extended to POMDP settings as well . In the cerebral cortex, while the posterior half is mostly involved in sensory inference, the anterior half is mostly involved in control and planning. Thereby, the CaI framework can provide an answer to the basic question of why common circuit architectures can be used for both inference and control .\nAn important difference between the sensory cortex and the motor or frontal cortex, in addition to the thickness of different layers, is that the latter receives inputs from the cerebellum and the basal ganglia through the thalamus.\nFurther, while probabilistic dynamic models and value computation are realized in the cortical circuit, these subcortical circuits may provide useful shortcuts.\nThe cerebellum has been proposed to provide deterministic forward models learned by supervised learning  , which can supplement probabilistic models in the cortex.\nAdditionally, the basal ganglia can provide learned value functions   to complement online computations of value functions.\nThe network linking the cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum is involved in motor learning  and action planning , and their exact roles are a topic of active research.\n\nReference markers found: [77]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]77: model-based optimal control is dynamic programming based on the Bellman equation .\nThe similarity between the equations for optimal state inference and optimal control is known as the Kalman duality [ref]77, which indicate the similarity between the computation of the log posterior in dynamic Bayesian inference and the state value function in optimal control  [ref]94 .\nThe framework is\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
