      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Graph Self-Supervised Learning with Contrastive Adjusted Zooming\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph representation learning (GRL) has become a pivotal strategy for analyzing semi-structured graph data in recent years. GRL aims to distill the high-dimensional structural and attributive information from graphs to generate low-dimensional embeddings for nodes or graphs. These learned embeddings can then be used in various downstream tasks such as node classification [ref]1 , graph classification  and link predictionÂ [ref]4. It has been applied to many real-world graph datasets from different domains  such as social networks [ref]1, geoscience , anomaly detection   and molecules . Recently, existing successful GRL approaches are mainly powered by Graph Neural Networks (GNN) [ref]1  , which learn low-dimensional node embeddings via iterative message passing to aggregate topological representations of neighbors. However, most of these methods adopt supervised learning and rely extensively on labeling information, which is both laborious and expensive to collect in the real world. To address this issue, some self-supervised GRL methods based on contrastive learning emerged, e.g., Deep Graph Infomax (DGI) [ref]12, Graph Contrastive Representation Learning (GRACE)  and Graphical Mutual Information (GMI) . The basic idea of these approaches is to set up pretext tasks without using\nlabeling information to train a GNN encoder for node embeddings generation. While DGI [ref]12 focuses on maximizing the Mutual Information (MI) between\nnode- and graph-level representations, GRACE  and GMI  extend this MI maximization scheme to contrast node-level representations in two different graph views or enlarge the MI between the hidden representation of nodes and the raw node features of their one-hop neighbors. Though these methods have achieved promising results, they adopt\nmonotonous contrastive learning on graphs, which only inspects graph-structured data from a single fixed perspective. For example, DGI and MVGRL only conduct contrasting between patch and global representations,\ni.e., contrasting from a global viewpoint.\nWithout considering the contrastiveness from a macro perspective, other methods such as GRACE, SubG-Con , and GMI only emphasize the local structure of target nodes by maximizing agreement between patch representations in two augmented views, or between\nnodes and representations of their neighbors.\nHowever, contrasting across different scales benefits the node representation learning by injecting richer contextual information into the discrimination . While global contextual information can be extracted by discriminating the node-level embeddings with the graph-level representations, node- and neighboring-level contrastiveness emphasize encoding the local contextual information. Thus,\nthe aforementioned contrastive learning schemes either neglect rich global information or localized information reflected by different viewpoints of graphs.\nAs a result, these methods may fail to obtain high-quality node representations and suffer from poor performance on downstream tasks due to their monotonous contrastive schemes.  In this paper, to overcome the aforementioned problems, we propose a novel graph self-supervised representation learning algorithm with a novel Graph Contrastive Adjusted Zooming mechanism, named G-Zoom.\nTo present this scheme, we have made an analogous explanation between the image scaling and our proposed graph adjusted zooming, as illustrated in Figure 1. Similar to the vision domain, graphs can also be inspected from\nthree different perspectives: micro, meso, and macro.\nFrom the macro perspective, the broadest zooming scale in our method allows us to examine the entire image or graph. In contrast, from the micro viewpoint, we can inspect the finest detail of a selected area of the data, i.e., a pixel for an image or a node for a graph. Standing between the micro and the macro perspective, inspection from the meso perspective allows us to choose a specific area, i.e., (a customized degree of zooming level) to exploit the valuable information embodied in this viewpoint. For instance, for the dog image presented in Figure 1,\nwe can select a specific part (e.g., head of the dog) and then zooming to an extent where we can see the object clearly (e.g., dog head). Similarly, in a graph, we can choose a target node and then decide the scope of its contextual information we want to examine. In general, it is straightforward to find that different perspectives offer different scenes and contextual information. While from the macro perspective, we zoom out\nobserving the entire picture and ignore the detailed information, from the micro perspective, we concentrate on the microscopic element of the data regardless of the broader view.\nDifferent from other two perspectives,\nthe meso perspective offers a more flexible viewpoint, enabling us to inspect a specific area with the desired scale. This perspective forces the model to explore the fine-grained information embodied in this scale, which can easily be neglected from the macro-level viewpoint. As such, it complements the macro perspective with overlooked detailed information in the semi-global context. Therefore, it is necessary to include various perspectives on multiple scales when conducting graph contrastive learning. In G-Zoom, we propose to formulate three different contrastive paths on various scales progressively: node-, neighboring-, and subgraph-level. Inspired by GRACE and MVGRL, we establish node- and subgraph-level contrastiveness to facilitate discrimination from the micro and macro perspective. Then, with our proposed adjusted zooming scheme, we design the neighboring-level discrimination path, which provides a tailored view of contrastiveness.\nSpecifically, two graph views are firstly sampled with different graph augmentations (e.g., graph sampling and diffusion). Then, we input two augmented views into a GNN encoder to get node representations in sampled graphs. At this stage, we can readout the subgraph-level representations via the graph pooling and obtain neighboring-level representations by aggregating the top-kðk neighborhood representations of selected central nodes. Finally, we formulate our training loss\nby summing up the contrastive losses on three different contrasting levels to train the graph encoder for the node embedding calculation. Compared with prior arts, G-Zoom not only facilitates multi-scale contrasting to provide learnable clues from multiple perspectives for model training but also can be extended to handle large-sized graphs. Experimental results on a variety of datasets have shown the superiority of G-Zoom compared with several state-of-the-art baselines. The main contributions of our work are listed as below:\n We propose a novel algorithm, namely G-Zoom, to learn graph representation in an unsupervised manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to conduct graph contrastive learning on multiple scales that crossed three different graph topological levels. We propose the graph adjusted zooming mechanism, which aims to facilitate the multi-scale graph contrastive learning from various perspectives to enrich the self-supervision signals and overcome the limitations of existing works.\n We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The results show that our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: and attributive information from graphs to generate low-dimensional embeddings for nodes or graphs.
