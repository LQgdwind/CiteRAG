      "content": "Paper Title: Bicriteria approximation for minimum dilation graph augmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLet G𝐺G be a graph embedded in a metric space M𝑀M. Let V​(G)𝑉𝐺V(G), E​(G)𝐸𝐺E(G) be the vertices and edges of G𝐺G. For vertices u,v∈V​(G)𝑢𝑣𝑉𝐺u,v\\in V(G), define dM​(u,v)subscript𝑑𝑀𝑢𝑣d_{M}(u,v) to be the metric distance between points u,v∈M𝑢𝑣𝑀u,v\\in M, and define dG​(u,v)subscript𝑑𝐺𝑢𝑣d_{G}(u,v) to be the shortest path distance between vertices u,v∈G𝑢𝑣𝐺u,v\\in G. The dilation or stretch of G𝐺G is the minimum t∈ℝ𝑡ℝt\\in\\mathbb{R} so that for all u,v∈V​(G)𝑢𝑣𝑉𝐺u,v\\in V(G), we have dG​(u,v)≤t⋅dM​(u,v)subscript𝑑𝐺𝑢𝑣⋅𝑡subscript𝑑𝑀𝑢𝑣d_{G}(u,v)\\leq t\\cdot d_{M}(u,v). Dilation measures the quality of a network in applications such as transportation, energy, and communication. For now, we restrict our attention to the special case of low dilation trees. Given a set of n𝑛n points V𝑉V embedded in a metric space M𝑀M, compute a spanning tree of V𝑉V with minimum dilation. Problem 1 is known across the theory community, as either the minimum dilation spanning tree problem   , the tree spanner problem    or the minimum maximum-stretch spanning tree problem   . The problem is NP-hard even if M𝑀M is an unweighted graph metric  or the Euclidean plane . Problem 1 is closely related to tree embeddings of general metrics [ref]5, and has applications to communication networks and distributed systems . The approximability of Problem 1 is an open problem stated in several surveys and papers   , and is a major obstacle towards constructing low dilation graphs with few edges  . The minimum spanning tree is an O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n)-approximation  for Problem 1, but no better result is known. Only in the special case where M𝑀M is an unweighted graph is there an O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n)-approximation . Is there an O​(n1−ε)𝑂superscript𝑛1𝜀O(n^{1-\\varepsilon})-approximation algorithm for Problem 1, for any ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0? If we no longer restrict ourselves to trees, we can shift our attention to spanners, which are low dilation sparse graphs. An advantage of spanners over minimum dilation trees is that spanners are not affected by Obstacle 2. Spanners obtain significantly better dilation guarantees, at the cost of adding slightly more edges. The trade-off between sparsity and dilation in spanners has been studied extensively   3 . For an overview of the rich history and multitude of applications of spanners, see the survey on graph spanners  and the textbook on geometric spanners . Spanner constructions focus on the initial design of the network. However, networks tend to improve over time. In this paper, we focus on the improvement step. Given a graph and a budget k𝑘k, which k𝑘k edges do we add to the graph to minimise its dilation? Given a positive integer k𝑘k and a metric graph G𝐺G, compute a set S𝑆S of k𝑘k edges so that the dilation of the graph G′=(V​(G),E​(G)∪S)superscript𝐺′𝑉𝐺𝐸𝐺𝑆G^{\\prime}=(V(G),E(G)\\cup S) is minimised. Note that S⊆V​(G)×V​(G)𝑆𝑉𝐺𝑉𝐺S\\subseteq V(G)\\times V(G). Narasimham and Smid  stated Problem 3 as one of twelve open problems in the final chapter of their reference textbook. For over a decade, the only positive results for Problem 3 were for the special case where k=1𝑘1k=1  1 6 4. In 2021, Gudmundsson and Wong  showed the first positive result for k≥2𝑘2k\\geq 2, by providing an O​(k)𝑂𝑘O(k)-approximation algorithm that runs in O​(n3​log⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑛3𝑛O(n^{3}\\log n) time. A downside of  is that their approximation factor is linear in k𝑘k. However, since Problem 1 is a special case of Problem 3, Obstacle 2 applies to Problem 3 as well. One cannot obtain an O​(k1−ε)𝑂superscript𝑘1𝜀O(k^{1-\\varepsilon})-approximation algorithm for Problem 3 for any ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, without first resolving Obstacle 2. One way to circumvent Obstacle 4 is to consider a bicriteria approximation. An advantage of a bicriteria approximation is that we can obtain significantly better dilation guarantees, at the cost of adding slightly more edges. The goal of our bicriteria problem is to investigate the trade-off between sparsity and dilation. We define the sparsity parameter f𝑓f to be the number of edges added by our algorithm divided by k𝑘k. We define the dilation parameter g𝑔g to be the dilation of our algorithm (which adds f​k𝑓𝑘fk edges) divided by the dilation of the optimal solution (which adds k𝑘k edges). Given a positive integer k𝑘k, a metric graph G𝐺G, sparsity f∈ℝ𝑓ℝf\\in\\mathbb{R} and dilation g∈ℝ𝑔ℝg\\in\\mathbb{R}, construct a set S𝑆S of f​k𝑓𝑘fk edges so that the dilation of the graph G′=(V​(G),E​(G)∪S)superscript𝐺′𝑉𝐺𝐸𝐺𝑆G^{\\prime}=(V(G),E(G)\\cup S) is at most g​t∗𝑔superscript𝑡gt^{*}, where t∗superscript𝑡t^{*} is the minimum dilation in Problem 3. Note that S⊆V​(G)×V​(G)𝑆𝑉𝐺𝑉𝐺S\\subseteq V(G)\\times V(G). We define an (f,g)𝑓𝑔(f,g)-bicriteria approximation to be an algorithm for Problem 5 that achieves sparsity f𝑓f and dilation g𝑔g.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: spanning tree problem   .
