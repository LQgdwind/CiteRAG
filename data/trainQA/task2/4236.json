      "content": "Paper Title: Spectrum Sharing Among Multiple-Seller and Multiple-Buyer Operators of A Mobile Network: A Stochastic Geometry Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe rising demand for various mobile services with different quality of services (QoS) results in an increasing need for spectrum resources in 5G and beyond . However, the scarcity of the frequency spectrum and access to particular sub-bands respecting the license rights of different mobile network operators (MNOs) are the main challenges to meet these demands. Accordingly, pervasive sharing of the frequency spectrum is an efficient approach that leads to enhanced utilization of spectrum resources and meets the growing needs of spectrum resources. Sharing of the frequency spectrum has been considered in several schemes, including dynamic spectrum access  and cognitive radio , . Nonetheless, most of these techniques are designed for sharing at a secondary level. In other words, a primary user with an exclusive right to a sub-band allows secondary users to use the same sub-band with a condition (i.e., when the primary user is idle or the received signal at the secondary users is under an accepted interference level of the primary user). Although such sharing enhances spectrum utilization, utilizing the spectrum depends on the decisions made between the primary and secondary users. In recent years, there have been attempts to implement the spectrum sharing at the primary level by using a cognitive approach, with the focus on spectrum sharing among MNOs, e.g., co-primary [ref]6, interoperator , and multioperator  sharing. Such spectrum sharing helps MNOs access more available frequency bands at a relatively small price and enhance spectrum utilization  –. Further, it can be used to significantly improve the end users’ QoS. Worldwide, MNOs, such as AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon, have cooperated in spectrum sharing at the primary level . However, spectrum sharing would cause additional costs to the MNOs in terms of direct utilization costs and potential performance degradation from an increase in interference levels . Thus, the spectrum sharing scheme is efficient for all MNOs if the licensed bands are well harmonized to support their users’ desired QoS, and the costs are kept reasonable . To achieve this, all MNOs must be careful to make correct choices of borrowing/leasing licensed bands. Because of the importance of guaranteeing QoS and effective utilization of the licensed spectrum, spectrum sharing is a significant trend in 5G and beyond; this is the focus of this paper. Different approaches for the improvement of spectrum utilization have been presented in the literature. For instance, the spectrum sharing approaches proposed in , ,  –, 0 –3 are based on sharing the same spectrum among multiple MNOs. In contrast, in [ref]16 –, MNOs with a shortage of allocated spectrum can lease spectrum from other MNOs that have underutilized spectrum. For convenience, MNOs with a lack of allocated spectrum (underutilization spectrum) and their users are called buyer (seller) MNOs and buyer (seller) users, respectively. Furthermore, frequency bands may be shared either orthogonally or nonorthogonally among MNOs . In orthogonal sharing, only one MNO is allowed to use a frequency band at any time. However, in nonorthogonal sharing, multiple MNOs are permitted to transmit simultaneously on the same frequency band. In , ,  –, 0 –3, the same spectrum is shared among multiple MNOs. More specifically, the licensed frequency bands are shared orthogonally among MNOs in  and , whereas they are shared nonorthogonally in  and 0. In , the problem of maximizing the weighted sum-rate for two MNOs is formally stated as a Nash bargaining game considering a dynamic network. According to Lyapunov optimization, both centralized and distributed dynamic algorithms are proposed in  to address the problem. In , a decentralized approach is developed based on Gibbs sampling to allocate a fraction of the shared spectrum to each base station of MNOs while the long-term fairness is guaranteed. In  and 0, the authors first apply a stochastic geometry approach to analyze the long-term expected rate considering a large-scale network in which all base stations (BSs) are distributed based on the Poisson Point Process (PPP). After that, in 0, a many-to-one stable matching game framework is adopted to model the problem of maximizing the social welfare of the MNOs. In contrast, in , a noncooperative game for interoperator device-to-device communications is established to maximize a constraint-based utility problem. Owing to the scarcity of the licensed spectrum and cost reduction, MNOs are also allowed to access the unlicensed frequency spectrum in , , 1 –3. The problem of maximizing the total utility based on a game-theoretical framework is formally stated in  and 1 –3. In , the problem is modeled as a repeated game respecting time-varying traffic. In 1, the authors employ a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game in which MNOs first set prices on each sub-band, and then, each user decides on them by applying a matching algorithm. In 2, a spectrum sharing scheme is proposed to maximize the quality of experience (measured in mean opinion score) of the users. A cooperative Nash bargaining game and a matching game are proposed to solve the problem under the users’ QoS constraint in 3. In , a network slicing game based on the overlapping coalition formation game is used to maximize the social welfare of MNOs so that the licensed and unlicensed spectrum resources are jointly distributed among MNOs according to the service demands and requirements of their users. Moreover, the spectrum sharing approach among seller and buyer MNOs is investigated as a solution in [ref]16 –. According to the spectrum price and the blocking probability, the authors of [ref]16 formulate the problem of maximizing the profit of the buyer MNOs based on a stochastic optimization framework. In [ref]17 –, first, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) coverage probability and the expected rate are analyzed by employing a stochastic geometry approach. In [ref]17, multiple seller MNOs lease their licensed sub-bands nonorthogonally to a single buyer MNO in indoor small cell networks. Further, a greedy algorithm is proposed to find the number of required licensed sub-bands for the buyer MNO under the QoS constraint in [ref]17. The authors of  consider a system model consisting of one seller and one buyer MNO where the seller MNO shares its licensed band nonorthogonally with the buyer MNO regarding a limitation on the maximum interference that the seller MNO’s users can tolerate. In addition, a revenue model is presented for both MNOs based on this limitation. None of the aforementioned works consider the problem of maximizing the expected profit for all seller and buyer MNOs as a multiobjective optimization problem (MOOP). In this paper, the goal of the modeled multiobjective optimization problem (MOOP) is to derive a trade-off between maximizing the expected profit of the seller MNOs and maximizing the expected profit of the buyer MNOs. Furthermore, we employ a combination of the ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-constraint and weighted sum methods to obtain a Pareto optimal front that satisfies the predefined conditions of Pareto optimality. Although the profit function is taken into account in , , 1 –3, these works consider a spectrum sharing scheme in which MNOs are in collaboration. In [ref]16, the problem of maximizing the profit function only for buyer MNOs is considered. In  and 0, the SINR coverage probability and the expected rate are analyzed by applying stochastic geometry in a co-primary system, while these performance metrics are investigated in a system with a single buyer MNO in [ref]17 –. In [ref]17 –, the interoperator interference is limited to seller MNOs and one buyer MNO. Thus, the impact of sharing spectrum for a BS of a buyer MNO on the neighboring ones of other buyer MNOs is not studied. In , ,  –[ref]17, there is no power control over the downlink transmit power of the buyer MNOs. Consequently, the interference imposed on the seller users is unpredictable, resulting in a reduction in the performance of the seller networks. In this paper, by employing a stochastic geometry approach, we analyze the expected rate of users considering a large-scale cellular network with multiple seller and multiple buyer MNOs in which each MNO owns its BSs and users. Additionally, we assume that the downlink transmit power of the buyer MNOs, channel gains, and the number and location of users and BSs are random parameters. Moreover, inspired by 4, we limit the interference imposed on seller MNOs’ users and adopt a distribution function for the downlink transmit power of buyer MNOs so that the interference imposed on seller MNOs’ users does not violate a tolerable interference threshold. After that, we formally state the joint problem of power control and licensed sub-band sharing as a multiobjective optimization problem (MOOP) to maximize the expected profit of all MNOs so that the QoS requirement of the MNOs’ users and the nonnegative return on investment of buyer MNOs are met. Although the stochastic analysis is more realistic, finding closed-form expressions for the objective function and constraints may be unfeasible. Therefore, designing an algorithm to solve the MOOP is challenging. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no previous studies have addressed the problem of maximizing the expected profit for both seller and buyer MNOs as a MOOP by a joint power control and licensed sub-band sharing in a stochastic environment by considering a maximum interference threshold on seller MNOs’ users. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: In this paper, we extend the contributions of [ref]17 by proposing a more general framework containing several seller and buyer MNOs to study the impact of sharing sub-bands between seller and buyer MNOs. By employing stochastic geometry, we analytically obtain the expected rate of users and the expected profit of MNOs as performance metrics under random parameters, such as channel gains, the location of UEs and BSs, and the transmit power of buyer BSs. To achieve this, we introduce a power control strategy to justify the transmit power of buyer MNOs’ BSs on the licensed sub-bands of the seller MNOs to ensure that the interference imposed on all users of each seller MNO is below the maximum interference threshold. By computing the expected rate of users and the expected profit of MNOs, we obtain an optimal solution for the stated joint power control and sub-band sharing problem. It is worth noting that we consider the joint problem of power control and sub-band sharing as a MOOP where we aim to maximize the expected profit of all MNOs under the QoS requirement of the MNOs’ users and the nonnegative return on investment of the buyer MNOs. To address the stated MOOP, it is transformed into a single objective optimization problem by using a combination of the ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-constraint and weighted sum methods. However, the binary sub-band sharing variables produce a disjoint feasible solution set that is an obstacle to solve the problem. To tackle this difficulty, we convert the binary variables into continuous ones by adding a penalty function to the objective function. Because of the presence of nonconvex expected rate functions in the objective function and the constraints, the transformed problem is still nonconvex. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithm based on the constrained stochastic successive convex approximation method by constructing a sequence of convex optimization problems that can be solved by using off-the-shelf software packages, such as CVX. We theoretically prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm to a stationary point, demonstrated by extensive numerical results. Additionally, numerical results show the performance of the proposed algorithm versus different varying parameters, such as the maximum interference threshold, the maximum transmit power of seller MNOs’ BSs, the minimum data rate requirement of users, the number of sub-bands for seller MNOs, and the number of buyer MNOs. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II introduces the system model and our assumptions. By employing stochastic geometry, we obtain the performance metrics in Section III. Specifically, we compute the expected rate of the seller and buyer users and the expected profit for the seller and buyer MNOs. In Section IV, we formally state the problem of maximizing the expected profit of all MNOs as a MOOP. Then, we describe the proposed algorithm for solving the problem stated in Section V. The numerical results and conclusions are presented in Section VI and Section VII, respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: users.
