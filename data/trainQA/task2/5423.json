      "content": "Paper Title: BSSAD: Towards A Novel Bayesian State-Space Approach for Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are many different anomaly detection algorithms available in the literature. Typically, anomaly detection algorithms are classified as supervised or unsupervised. Some researchers have proposed other classification techniques for anomaly detection methods. In [ref]7, anomaly detection algorithms were classified as residual-error based and density based. Residual-error based methods predict the next value and find the difference between the predicted and actual values. Density-based methods find the distribution of the data and data is flagged as an anomaly if it is not part of the distribution. In , the anomaly detection algorithms were classified as statistics-based, classification-based, vocabulary-based, and reconstruction-based. Statistics-based methods are similar in definition to density-based algorithms. The data is assumed to follow a normal distribution and a variable is classified as normal if it is within the 3‚ÄãœÉ3ùúé3\\sigma range. Classification is usually done using labeled data with high accuracy. However, labeled data is hard to obtain, thus the use of unlabeled methods is more common. Vocabulary-based methods aim to find patterns in time-series data and data deviating from these patterns is classified as an anomaly. Finally, reconstruction-based methods are similar to residual-error based methods. Most work found in the literature aims at using reconstruction or residual-error based methods. One of the most common methods that have served as a benchmark for many other methods is the Isolation Forest . The isolation forest is based on a tree-based architecture to identify anomalies but it is not made for multivariate time-series data. Neural networks, more specifically recurrent neural networks (RNN) and autoencoders or a combination of both, have recently become very popular as a method to detect anomalies. An extensive review of the application of deep learning techniques in anomaly detection can be found in [ref]2 , and . Recently, transformers have also been proposed for detecting anomalies [ref]24. They renovate transformers for anomaly detection by adding an anomaly-attention mechanism. Most works have focused on implementing long-short term memory (LSTM), a type of RNN, for reconstruction  . One example of using autoencoders for anomaly detection was USAD   . Methods combining both LSTM and autoencoders to detect anomalies include     and 0. Generative adversarial networks (GAN) have also been proposed for anomaly detection 1 2. All these methods are classified as residual-error or reconstruction-based anomaly detection. Algorithms that can be classified as density or statistical-based anomaly detection include 3 and Omnianomaly 4. These methods use generative models to predict the distribution of the data. Bayesian state-space methods are also examples of density-based algorithms. Even though these methods have mainly been applied for next state estimation   5, there have been some works that have applied Bayesian state-space estimation for anomaly detection. However, most of the work has been restricted to fault detection 6 or anomaly detection in videos 7 and 8. Ensemble Kalman filters have not been used for anomaly detection and have only been implemented for state estimation in weather or medical domains . In , hierarchical variational autoencoders combined with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is used to learn temporal and inter-sensor correlation. A data point is flagged as an anomaly if it does not follow the temporal or inter-sensor correlation. A relevant work that has implemented Bayesian state-space algorithms was called Neural System Identification and Bayesian Filtering [ref]7. In [ref]7 the AE and LSTM methods are improved further by adding a unscented Kalman Transform (UKF). UKF is able to learn the temporal and inter-sensor relationship and is able to approximate the distribution of the next state.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: the literature.
