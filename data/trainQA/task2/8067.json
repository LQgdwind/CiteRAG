      "content": "Paper Title: GeneticPrism: Multifaceted Visualization of Scientific Impact Evolutions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMultilayer network visualization represents systems where entities interact across multiple contexts or dimensions [ref]15. Nodes can belong to multiple layers, with edges existing within or spanning across layers. This kind of method benefits fields like biology, sociology, and digital humanities. Recent surveys [ref]36  highlight the need for advanced visualization techniques to handle the complexity and volume of multilayer network data. Several innovative approaches have been developed. MuxViz  provides a platform for analyzing and visualizing multilayer networks using techniques like adjacency matrices and node-link diagrams. Detangler  offers coordinated views to explore inter-layer relationships. Multilayer Graph Edge Bundling  addresses edge clutter by grouping edges with common paths. Refinery  supports cross-layer connectivity tasks through associative browsing. HybridVis [ref]33 integrates multiple visualization techniques for large multivariate networks, providing a flexible approach to visualize different data aspects. NetworkAnalyst  uses chord diagrams for inter-layer relationships in gene expression data. Dynamic Communities  visualizes the evolution of community structures within multilayer networks. g-Miner  offers interactive techniques for exploring and manipulating graph data, including creating and refining groupings within layers. Shirato et al.  enhance the understanding of complex temporal relationships in multivariate time series through advanced visualization techniques across multiple dimensions. GraphDice  extends ScatterDice  for multivariate networks, providing a consistent interface for visualizing node and edge attributes. Similar to GeneticPrism, GraphDice supports exploring complex multilayer networks through filtering and partitioning based on various attributes but focuses more on interactive exploration of network dimensions and does not present the influence among groups. The survey by McGee et al. [ref]36 categorizes tasks into cross-layer connectivity, cross-layer entity comparison, layer manipulation, and layer comparison. However, tasks addressing inter-relationships between layers, such as cross-layer flows, are rarely explored. GeneticPrism addresses this gap by visualizing inter-layer relationships through a suite of novel visualization designs. Furthermore, GeneticPrism supports overlapping topic visualization that simultaneously displays nodes appearing in multiple network layers.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: Multilayer network visualization represents systems where entities interact across multiple contexts or dimensions [ref]15.

Recent\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
