In this section, we focus on current practice in the field for pedestrians and transit/emergency vehicles. When balancing the needs of different road user classes in RL-based signal controllers, stakeholders’ requirements should be taken into account; in the US, for instance, agencies’ opinions differ on whether preemption for trains should take priority over pedestrians . For pedestrians, the simplest option is for the pedestrian signal to be activated in the direction of the through movement, as is implicitly assumed by many works in RL and made explicit in some (e.g., ). However, doing so may cause pedestrians to impede the flow of left-turning and right-turning traffic, which creates safety hazards. In practice, leading pedestrian intervals (LePIs) mitigate this risk by allowing pedestrians to start crossing before cars are permitted to make turns [ref]14. Alternative phase sequence designs add lagging pedestrian intervals (after turning phases) or phases exclusively for pedestrians.  developed a benefit-cost model to assess the safety-delay tradeoffs for LePIs at individual intersections. Beyond safety, additional work has tried to minimize the delay of pedestrians so that they are treated equitably compared to drivers, as codified by regulations in Germany, the UK, and China . For the deployed SURTRAC system,  adaptively set pedestrian walk intervals based on predicted phase lengths to avoid cutting them short, while  considered using vehicular volumes and pedestrian actuation frequencies to switch between controller modes. We are unaware of any work in RL that has explicitly included LePIs as part of the action space formulation. As for handling transit and emergency vehicles, typical strategies include the prioritization and preemption of signals. Prioritization handles requests made by vehicles through vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, and may or may not result in adjustments to signalling plans. Meanwhile, preemption (often used for firetrucks or trains) deterministically replaces the signal plan with a predefined routine that favours the preempting vehicle. Typically, signal controllers need multiple cycles after preemption to recover from the interruption [ref]14. The adaptive SCATS controller natively implements both prioritization and preemption; compared to prior practice,  found that SCATS’ performance improvements were robust to prioritization, and  found that it could reduce recovery time from preemption. These results suggest the potential of implementing prioritization and preemption with RL-based methods; in particular, explicit modelling of recovery from preemption may further improve recovery times. In addition to interactions at intersections, RL-based signal controllers should also consider the effects of transit and emergency vehicles on traffic between intersections. For instance, when buses are stopped on roads, they may block other traffic from passing. As initial steps towards implementing bus prioritization in the SURTRAC system,  delayed the allocation of green time in intersections located downstream from stopped buses, and  predicted bus dwelling times at stops by leveraging V2I communications.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: of adjustments to signalling plans to accommodate different classes of road users other than regular passenger vehicles, including pedestrians, cyclists, transit vehicles, and emergency vehicles [ref]14.
