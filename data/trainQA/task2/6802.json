      "content": "Paper Title: Exploiting Point-Wise Attention in 6D Object Pose Estimation Based on Bidirectional Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInstead of explicitly utilizing the generated images from the CAD model, another pipeline requires the network to implicitly learn the correlation between the observation and the model.\nWith the recent advancements in deep learning, several methods [ref]24[ref]25[ref]26 have attempted to\ndetect box corners in the RGB image for 3D bounding box estimation.\nPVNet , employs farthest point sampling to vote for key points on the target object, predicting the direction vector pointing from each pixel to the projection point using a RANSAC voting strategy to locate the projection point. Some subsequent methods attempt to enhance the precision of correspondence prediction or the robustness of geometric solver .\nRecently, some approaches have attempted to include model prior information\nto provide geometric constraints.\n proposes a graph neural network to learn implicit neural representations of the 3D model and presents a dense correspondence matching scheme for visible points.\nBiCo-Net adds an extra branch to predict the correspondence from model points to scene points, achieving higher robustness against occlusion. But they rely on the network to predict the correspondence correctly, ignoring the correlations between each point pair. While we further propose a global attention mechanism to leverage the difference among predicted correspondences. Besides solving the registration problem from predicted correspondence, many other methods attempt to implicitly utilize the CAD model through direct regression approach .\nDenseFusion  deploys a dense fusion strategy to fuse color features and geometry features point-wisely, then directly regresses pose from the fused feature.\nFFB6D  adds a bidirectional fusion module to fuse the two kinds of features on each encoding layer, bringing more local and global features.\nGCCN\napplies a co-attention module to compute the correlations between scene points and model points. But they\napply the attention map with other features to directly regress the pose, reducing the influence of geometric properties. We show in the experiment section that our design of the pseudo-siamese network and geometric solver enhance the capability of the attention mechanism.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: from the CAD model, another pipeline requires the network to implicitly learn the correlation between the observation and the model.\nWith the recent advancements in deep learning, several methods [ref]24[ref]25[ref]26 have attempted to\ndetect box corners in the RGB image for 3D bounding box estimation.\nPVNet , employs farthest point sampling to vote for key points on the target object,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
