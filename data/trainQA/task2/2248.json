      "content": "Paper Title: The complexity of quantified constraints: collapsibility, switchability and the algebraic formulation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur use of infinite languages (i.e. signatures, since we work on a finite domain) is a controversial part of our discourse and merits special discussion. We wish to argue that a necessary corollary of the algebraic approach to (Q)CSP is a reconciliation with infinite languages. The traditional approach to consider arbitrary finite subsets of Inv(ùî∏)ùî∏(\\mathbb{A}) is unsatisfactory in the sense that choosing this way to escape the ‚Äì naturally infinite ‚Äì set Inv(ùî∏)ùî∏(\\mathbb{A}) is as arbitrary as the choice of encoding required for infinite languages. However, the difficulty in that choice is of course the reason why this route is often eschewed. The first possibility that comes to mind for encoding a relation in Inv(ùî∏)ùî∏(\\mathbb{A}) is probably to list its tuples, while the second is likely to be to describe the relation in some kind of ‚Äúsimple‚Äù logic. Both these possibilities are discussed in , for the Boolean domain, where the ‚Äúsimple‚Äù logic is the propositional calculus. For larger domains, this would be equivalent to quantifier-free propositions over equality with constants. Both Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) and Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) representations are considered in  and a similar discussion in  exposes the advantages of the DNF encoding. The point here is that testing non-emptiness of a relation encoded in CNF may already be NP-hard, while for DNF this will be tractable. Since DNF has some benign properties, we might consider it a ‚Äúnice, simple‚Äù logic while for ‚Äúsimple‚Äù logic we encompass all quantifier-free sentences, that include DNF and CNF as special cases. The reason we describe this as ‚Äúsimple‚Äù logic is to compare against something stronger, say all first-order sentences over equality with constants. Here recognising non-emptiness becomes Pspace-hard and since QCSPs already sit in Pspace, this complexity is unreasonable. For the QCSP over infinite languages Inv(ùî∏)ùî∏(\\mathbb{A}), Chen and Mayr [ref]16 have declared for our first, tuple-listing, encoding. In this paper we will choose the ‚Äúsimple‚Äù logic encoding, occasionally giving more refined results for its ‚Äúnice, simple‚Äù restriction to DNF. Our choice of the ‚Äúsimple‚Äù logic encoding over the tuple-listing encoding will ultimately be justified by the (Revised) Chen Conjecture holding for ‚Äúsimple‚Äù logic yet failing for tuple-listings. Since the original Chen Conjecture is known now to be false , our result becomes more remarkable. However, there are some surprising consequences, it follows from  that there exists a finite and 3-element ‚Ñ¨‚Ñ¨\\mathcal{B} with constants, so that QCSP(Inv‚Äã(Pol‚Äã(‚Ñ¨)))InvPol‚Ñ¨(\\mathrm{Inv}(\\mathrm{Pol}(\\mathcal{B}))), under our encoding, and QCSP(‚Ñ¨)‚Ñ¨(\\mathcal{B}) have different complexities: the former being co-NP-hard while the latter is in P. The Feder-Vardi Conjecture is known to hold for infinite languages [ref]17 but the proofs are based on the tuple-listing encoding. We can not say whether the polynomial cases are preserved under the DNF encoding. Let us consider examples of our encodings. For the domain {1,2,3}123\\{1,2,3\\}, we may give a binary relation either by the tuples {(1,2),(2,1),(2,3),(3,2),(1,3),(3,1),(1,1)}12212332133111\\{(1,2),(2,1),(2,3),(3,2),(1,3),(3,1),(1,1)\\} or by the ‚Äúsimple‚Äù logic formula (x‚â†y‚à®x=1)ùë•ùë¶ùë•1(x\\neq y\\vee x=1). For the domain {0,1}01\\{0,1\\}, we may give the ternary (not-all-equal) relation by the tuples {(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1),(1,1,0),(1,0,1),(1,1,0)}100010001110101110\\{(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1),(1,1,0),(1,0,1),(1,1,0)\\} or by the ‚Äúsimple‚Äù logic formula (x‚â†y‚à®y‚â†z)ùë•ùë¶ùë¶ùëß(x\\neq y\\vee y\\neq z). In both of these examples, the simple formula is also in DNF. Nota Bene. The results of this paper apply for the ‚Äúsimple‚Äù logic encoding as well as the ‚Äúnice, simple‚Äù encoding in DNF except where specifically stated otherwise. These exceptions are Proposition¬†39 and Corollary¬†40 (which uses the ‚Äúnice, simple‚Äù DNF) and Proposition¬†42 (which uses the tuple-listing encoding).\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: Here recognising non-emptiness becomes Pspace-hard and since QCSPs already sit in Pspace, this complexity is unreasonable.
