Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Introduced in June 2021, GitHub’s Copilot [ref]5 is an in-IDE recommender system that leverages OpenAI’s Codex neural language model (NLM) [ref]6 which uses a GPT-3 model . This model comprises ≈\\approx13 billion parameters consuming hundreds of petaflop days to compute on Azure cloud platform [ref]6 and is then fine-tuned on code from GitHub to generate code suggestions that are uncannily effective and can perform above human average on programming contest problems .\nWhile many other research projects have attempted to do something similar   , Copilot’s availability and smooth integration with GitHub’s backup have unavoidably generated a “hype” in the tech community, with many developers either already using it through its technical preview or started using it after its recent public launch as a paid subscription [ref]5. Currently, Copilot provides three key functionalities: autofill for repetitious code, suggest tests based on the implementation of code, and comment to code conversion [ref]5. We focus on the feature of turning comments into code when a user adds a remark describing the logic they want to utilise [ref]5.\nAlthough Copilot code suggestion can be triggered by adding a comment in natural language, it is advised that users add comments and meaningful names for function parameters to receive useful recommendations [ref]5.\nThe human input we used to trigger code suggestions from Copilot concatenates the natural language comment, function name, and function parameters. Vaithilingam et al.  conducted an exploratory study of how developers use Copilot, finding that Copilot did not solve tasks more quickly but did save time in searching for solutions.\nMore importantly, Copilot solved the writer’s block problem of not knowing how to get started. This notion of seeding an initial, if incorrect, solution is often how design proceeds in software. Recent work shows initial investigations on how large language models for code can add architecture tactics by using program synthesis   and structure learning .\nThis paper complements these earlier approaches by focusing on moving beyond code completion, where most research effort is currently concentrated.\nTo provide deeper insights into the overall effectiveness of the instrument, it is crucial to evaluate the quality of Copilot’s suggestions and understand its limitations.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: In-IDE code completion tools have improved a lot in recent years, from suggesting variables or method calls from user code bases [ref]15 to suggesting entire code blocks .\nLarge language model based approaches like Copilot and AlphaCode have done remarkably well on improving the state of the art in code completion, solving\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
