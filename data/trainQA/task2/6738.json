The primary objective is to discover underlying similar patterns and structures within data without relying on explicit labels or annotations. Traditional clustering algorithms such as flat clustering  , hierarchical clustering  and spectral clustering  essentially employ handcrafted feature extractors to group samples with similar characteristics together. However, these methods often exhibit limited performance when applied to time series data due to the complex and high-dimensional structures inherited therein. Simple distance-based metrics in traditional clustering struggle to effectively represent these intricate structures. Additionally, manually extracted features usually lack quality guarantees and the process is not automated. Deep neural networks have the ability to learn complex and hierarchical representations of data, making them well-suited for capturing the intricate nature of time series data. In this case, the integration of traditional clustering techniques with deep learning, known as deep clustering, has garnered significant attention from researchers. Deep clustering methods break down the barriers between clustering and representation learning, allowing for the iterative optimization of the clustering-oriented objective to learn mappings from the input space to a new latent space  . The iterative optimization approaches such as DeepCluster [ref]67 and ODC  enable the neural network and the clustering algorithm to mutually reinforce each other through interactive learning, leading to improved performance and more meaningful representations. CRLI , DTCR [ref]77 and DEC [ref]78 employ auto-encoder architectures as backbones and jointly optimize the reconstruction loss and clustering loss. In addition to the widely used K-Means clustering, spectral clustering is also explored by IDFD  to learn clustering-friendly representations. It is worth noting that clustering assignments can serve as self-supervised signals, thereby facilitating the self-learning process. Particularly, state-of-the-art contrastive learning highlights the importance of the alignment property that encourages the samples with similar features or semantic categories to be close in the low-dimensional space, which is also essential for deep clustering . In this case, recent studies that leverage clustering-based contrastive learning to acquire highly effective representations with higher-level semantic information have emerged       , which will be discussed in Section V-C2. More details of deep clustering methods for unsupervised representation learning are listed as follows.\n\nReference markers found: [67]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]67: allowing for the iterative optimization of the clustering-oriented objective to learn mappings from the input space to a new latent space  .
