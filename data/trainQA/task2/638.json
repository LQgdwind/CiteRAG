      "content": "Paper Title: Meta-Gradient Reinforcement Learning with an Objective Discovered Online\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe idea of learning to learn by gradient descent has a long history. In supervised learning, IDBD and SMD   used a meta-gradient approach to adapt the learning rate online so as to optimise future performance. ‚ÄúLearning by gradient descent to learn by gradient descent\"¬† used meta-gradients, offline and over multiple lifetimes, to learn a gradient-based optimiser, parameterised by a ‚Äúblack-box‚Äù neural network. MAML 1 and REPTILE 3 also use meta-gradients, offline and over multiple lifetimes, to learn initial parameters that can be optimised more efficiently. In reinforcement learning, methods such as meta reinforcement learning [ref]39 and RL2 [ref]9 allow a recurrent network to jointly represent, in its activations, both the agent‚Äôs representation of state and also its internal parameters. Xu et al  introduced metagradients as a general but efficient approach for optimising the meta-parameters of gradient-based RL agents. This approach has since been applied to many different meta-parameters of RL algorithms, such as the discount Œ≥ùõæ\\gamma and bootstrapping parameter ŒªùúÜ\\lambda , intrinsic rewards  , auxiliary tasks , off-policy corrections , and to parameterise returns as a linear combination of rewards  (without any bootstrapping). The metagradient approach has also been applied, offline and over multiple lifetimes, to black-box parameterisations, via deep neural networks, of the entire RL algorithm  9 and 4 (contemporaneous work); evolutionary approaches have also been applied 6. No prior work has addressed the most ambitious combination: a black-box approach that can parameterise the RL algorithm, meta-learned online, during the course of a single agent lifetime. The table below catalogs related work on meta-gradient RL. We differentiate methods by several key properties. First, whether they are single lifetime (i.e. they learn online to improve performance by interacting with an environment), or require multiple lifetimes (i.e. they improve performance across repeated agent ‚Äúlifetimes\", each of which faces a different environment sampled from a suitable distribution). Second, whether they are white-box methods (i.e. they meta-learn the hyper-parameters of an existing RL update rule) or black-box methods (i.e. they meta-learn a general-purpose neural network encoding an RL update rule). Third, whether they compute meta-gradients by forward-mode or backward-mode differentiation (or do not use meta-gradients at all). Finally, what is meta-learned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgorithm\nAlgorithm properties\nWhat is meta-learned?\n\nIDBD, SMD  \n‚ò•\n‚ñ°‚ñ°\\square\n‚Üí‚Üí\\rightarrow\nlearning rate\n\nSGD2 \n‚ò•‚ò•‚ò•\n‚ñ†‚ñ†\\blacksquare\n‚Üê‚Üê\\leftarrow\noptimiser\n\nRL2, Meta-RL [ref]9 [ref]39\n‚ò•‚ò•‚ò•\n‚ñ†‚ñ†\\blacksquare\nX\nrecurrent network\n\nMAML, REPTILE 1 3\n‚ò•‚ò•‚ò•\n‚ñ°‚ñ°\\square\n‚Üê‚Üê\\leftarrow\ninitial params\n\nMeta-Gradient  \n‚ò•\n‚ñ°‚ñ°\\square\n‚Üí‚Üí\\rightarrow\nŒ≥ùõæ\\gamma, ŒªùúÜ\\lambda, reward\n\nMeta-Gradient   \n‚ò•\n‚ñ°‚ñ°\\square\n‚Üê‚Üê\\leftarrow\nauxiliary tasks, hyperparams, reward weights\n\nML3, MetaGenRL  9\n‚ò•‚ò•‚ò•\n‚ñ†‚ñ†\\blacksquare\n‚Üê‚Üê\\leftarrow\nloss function\n\nEvolved PG 6\n‚ò•‚ò•‚ò•\n‚ñ†‚ñ†\\blacksquare\nX\nloss function\n\nOh et al. 2020 4\n‚ò•‚ò•‚ò•\n‚ñ†‚ñ†\\blacksquare\n‚Üê‚Üê\\leftarrow\ntarget vector\n\nThis paper\n‚ò•\n‚ñ†‚ñ†\\blacksquare\n‚Üê‚Üê\\leftarrow\ntarget\n\n\n‚ñ°‚ñ°\\square white box, ‚ñ†‚ñ†\\blacksquare black box, ‚ò•¬†single lifetime, ‚ò•‚ò•‚ò•¬†multi-lifetime\n\n\n‚Üê‚Üê\\leftarrow backward mode, ‚Üí‚Üí\\rightarrow forward mode, X no meta-gradient\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: use meta-gradients, offline and over multiple lifetimes, to learn initial parameters that can be optimised more efficiently.
