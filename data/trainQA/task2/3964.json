Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: Injecting Domain Adaptation with Learning-to-hash for Effective and Efficient Zero-shot Dense Retrieval\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn our work, we evaluate four different categories of vector compression baselines: (1) original (without compression), (2) floating point, (3) dimension reduction, and (4) quantization. For all baselines, we use the already finetuned TAS-B [ref]9 model as the backbone and evaluate them in a zero-shot retrieval setup across 18 diverse datasets from the BEIR benchmark [ref]19. Original: We evaluate two dense retriever baselines: (1) ‚Äúzero-shot‚Äù baseline with TAS-B from Thakur et¬†al. [ref]19 and (2) ‚Äúupper-baseline‚Äù of TAS-B + GPL from Wang et¬†al. . Floating point: We reduce the floating-point precision of the zero-shot TAS-B model from the default 32 bits [ref]19 to 16 bits (fp16fp16\\mathrm{fp16}) and 8 bits (fp8fp8\\mathrm{fp8}) respectively. Dimensional reduction: We fit (1) principle component analysis (PCA) transformation across all embeddings produced by TAS-B for each test dataset in BEIR. We reduce the dimension of the passage embedding from 768 to 128 dimensions. (2) We apply the identical approach for evaluating TLDR by Kalantidis et¬†al. [ref]27. Quantization: We decompose in (1) product quantization (PQ)  the original dùëëd dimensional vector into kùëòk centroids, quantized and stored with nùëõn bits.\nWe apply product quantization with the zero-shot TAS-B model. (2) We evaluate the TAS-B model with GPL across each dataset in BEIR and apply product quantization (PQ+GPL).\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: of vector compression baselines: (1) original (without compression), (2) floating point, (3) dimension reduction, and (4) quantization.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
