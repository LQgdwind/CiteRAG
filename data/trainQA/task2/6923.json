      "content": "Paper Title: Test-Time Adaptation for Point Cloud Upsampling Using Meta-Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEarly work has proposed optimization-based methods     for densifying point clouds. Alexa et al.  generate dense points by inserting points at the Voronoi diagram’s vertices. Lipman et al.  introduce a locally optimal projection operator for resampling point clouds based on L1 norm. Later, an improved weighted version of the local optimal projection operator was proposed in . However, these methods usually do not work well around sharp edges. Huang et al.  propose an edge-aware resampling algorithm that progressively transfers generated points towards the edge singularities to preserve edge sharpness. Ever since the emergence of deep learning, recent work has shifted to upsampling point clouds using deep neural networks. PU-Net [ref]29 is the first to apply deep learning in point cloud upsampling. It uses Point-Net++ [ref]30 for feature extraction and expands point features using multi-branch convolutions in feature space. EC-Net [ref]31 proposes an edge-aware point cloud upsampling by directly minimizing distances from points to edges. MPU  proposes a patch-based network that learns different levels of point cloud features by progressively upsampling the points in multiple steps. PU-GAN  adopts a generative adversarial network to generate high-quality upsampled points. PU-GCN  proposes a graph convolutional network for point cloud upsampling. PUGeo-Net  incorporates differential geometry to improve point cloud upsampling performance by learning the local geometry of point clouds. Dis-PU  introduces disentangled refinement units for point upsampling using two sub-networks, including a dense point generator and a point spatial refiner. PU-Dense  proposes a novel feature extraction unit for extracting 3D multiscale features and adopts U-Net architecture based on sparse convolutions for computationally efficient processing of point clouds.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: points towards the edge singularities to preserve edge sharpness.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1.
