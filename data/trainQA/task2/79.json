In view of the increasing volume of real-life data, distributed MF methods that can process large-scale datasets\nhave gained significant interests in the last decade [ref]4. However, recent emphasis on user privacy has called for new distributed schemes that can realize these MF based applications without revealing the users’ private data. Specific examples include processing distributed patient medical records stored in multiple hospitals [ref]5 and daily personal data of mobile users . As an emerging distributed learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) has been introduced by Google to enable collaborative model learning over distributed data owned by massive clients (e.g., mobile devices or institutions). The FL runs under the orchestration of a central server without the need of knowing the clients’ raw private data. Compared with traditional distributed learning schemes , FL faces new challenges.\nThis includes dealing with massively distributed clients in heterogeneous networks which have unbalanced and non-i.i.d. data distribution, and limited communication resource for message exchanges between the server and clients . To train a model under the challenging FL setting, serveral FL algorithms have been proposed   0 1 2, mostly based on the classical stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method. In particular,  proposed a model averaging algorithm, called FedAvg, where the server coordinates the training by iteratively averaging the local models learned by the clients via SGD. A salient feature of FedAvg over the classical gradient sharing approach is local SGD, where the clients are allowed to perform multiple epochs of SGD locally before sending the local model to the server for averaging. Local SGD has been proven an effective strategy to reduce the required number of communication rounds for producing a good model  1 2.\nThe second feature of FedAvg is partial client participation (PCP), where only a small number of clients are sampled and communicate with the server in each communication round. Partial participation can greatly alleviate the network congestion problem especially when the number of clients is large and communication bandwidth is limited.\nIt also models that a client might become offline randomly due to poor link quality.\nWe notice that, while many successful efforts have been made for supervised FL tasks, few works have been done for the MF model (1) and its applications.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: used in many applications.
