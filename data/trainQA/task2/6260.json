      "content": "Paper Title: Discreteness of asymptotic tensor ranks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur proof of Theorem 1.8 relies (among other ingredients) on the notion of the max-rank of matrix subspaces, and the relation between max-ranks of matrix subspaces obtained by slicing a tensor in the three possible directions. For any matrix subspace 𝒜⊆𝔽n1⊗𝔽n2𝒜tensor-productsuperscript𝔽subscript𝑛1superscript𝔽subscript𝑛2\\mathcal{A}\\subseteq\\mathbb{F}^{n_{1}}\\otimes\\mathbb{F}^{n_{2}}, we let max-rank​(𝒜)max-rank𝒜\\textnormal{max-rank}(\\mathcal{A}) denote the largest matrix rank of any element of 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}.\nTo any tensor T∈𝔽n1⊗𝔽n2⊗𝔽n3𝑇tensor-productsuperscript𝔽subscript𝑛1superscript𝔽subscript𝑛2superscript𝔽subscript𝑛3T\\in\\mathbb{F}^{n_{1}}\\otimes\\mathbb{F}^{n_{2}}\\otimes\\mathbb{F}^{n_{3}} we may associate three matrix subspaces 𝒜1⊆𝔽n2⊗𝔽n3subscript𝒜1tensor-productsuperscript𝔽subscript𝑛2superscript𝔽subscript𝑛3\\mathcal{A}_{1}\\subseteq\\mathbb{F}^{n_{2}}\\otimes\\mathbb{F}^{n_{3}}, 𝒜2⊆𝔽n2⊗𝔽n3subscript𝒜2tensor-productsuperscript𝔽subscript𝑛2superscript𝔽subscript𝑛3\\mathcal{A}_{2}\\subseteq\\mathbb{F}^{n_{2}}\\otimes\\mathbb{F}^{n_{3}} and 𝒜3⊆𝔽n2⊗𝔽n3subscript𝒜3tensor-productsuperscript𝔽subscript𝑛2superscript𝔽subscript𝑛3\\mathcal{A}_{3}\\subseteq\\mathbb{F}^{n_{2}}\\otimes\\mathbb{F}^{n_{3}}, obtained by taking the span of the slices of T𝑇T in each of the three possible directions. We denote the max-ranks of these spaces by Qi⁡(T)=max-rank​(𝒜i)subscriptQ𝑖𝑇max-ranksubscript𝒜𝑖\\operatorname{Q}_{i}(T)=\\textnormal{max-rank}(\\mathcal{A}_{i}), for i∈[ref]3𝑖delimited-[]3i\\in[ref]3. We prove that for a concise tensor T𝑇T the max-ranks Qi⁡(T)subscriptQ𝑖𝑇\\operatorname{Q}_{i}(T) cannot all be small, in the following sense. Let T∈𝔽n1⊗𝔽n2⊗𝔽n3𝑇tensor-productsuperscript𝔽subscript𝑛1superscript𝔽subscript𝑛2superscript𝔽subscript𝑛3T\\in\\mathbb{F}^{n_{1}}\\otimes\\mathbb{F}^{n_{2}}\\otimes\\mathbb{F}^{n_{3}} be concise. Let i,j,k∈[ref]3𝑖𝑗𝑘delimited-[]3i,j,k\\in[ref]3 be distinct. Suppose that |𝔽|>nk𝔽subscript𝑛𝑘|\\mathbb{F}|>n_{k}. Then\nQi⁡(T)​Qj⁡(T)≥nk.subscriptQ𝑖𝑇subscriptQ𝑗𝑇subscript𝑛𝑘\\operatorname{Q}_{i}(T)\\operatorname{Q}_{j}(T)\\geq n_{k}. We have explicit examples of families of tensors (provided later) that show how Theorem 1.13 is essentially optimal: For every n𝑛n that is a square,\nthere is a concise tensor T∈𝔽n⊗𝔽n⊗𝔽n𝑇tensor-productsuperscript𝔽𝑛superscript𝔽𝑛superscript𝔽𝑛T\\in\\mathbb{F}^{n}\\otimes\\mathbb{F}^{n}\\otimes\\mathbb{F}^{n} such that for all i𝑖i we have\nn≤Qi⁡(T)≤2​n𝑛subscriptQ𝑖𝑇2𝑛\\sqrt{n}\\leq\\operatorname{Q}_{i}(T)\\leq 2\\sqrt{n} (2.8). In particular, for all i≠j𝑖𝑗i\\neq j we have n≤Qi⁡(T)​Qj⁡(T)≤4​n𝑛subscriptQ𝑖𝑇subscriptQ𝑗𝑇4𝑛n\\leq\\operatorname{Q}_{i}(T)\\operatorname{Q}_{j}(T)\\leq 4n. For every n𝑛n, there is a concise tensor T∈𝔽n⊗𝔽n⊗𝔽n𝑇tensor-productsuperscript𝔽𝑛superscript𝔽𝑛superscript𝔽𝑛T\\in\\mathbb{F}^{n}\\otimes\\mathbb{F}^{n}\\otimes\\mathbb{F}^{n} such that Q1⁡(T)=Q3⁡(T)=nsubscriptQ1𝑇subscriptQ3𝑇𝑛\\operatorname{Q}_{1}(T)=\\operatorname{Q}_{3}(T)=n and Q2⁡(T)=2subscriptQ2𝑇2\\operatorname{Q}_{2}(T)=2, so that Q2⁡(T)​Q3⁡(T)=2​nsubscriptQ2𝑇subscriptQ3𝑇2𝑛\\operatorname{Q}_{2}(T)\\operatorname{Q}_{3}(T)=2n (2.6). For every c𝑐c and for every n𝑛n that is a multiple of c𝑐c,\nthere is a concise tensor T∈𝔽n⊗𝔽n⊗𝔽n𝑇tensor-productsuperscript𝔽𝑛superscript𝔽𝑛superscript𝔽𝑛T\\in\\mathbb{F}^{n}\\otimes\\mathbb{F}^{n}\\otimes\\mathbb{F}^{n} such that\nQ1⁡(T)=nsubscriptQ1𝑇𝑛\\operatorname{Q}_{1}(T)=n, Q2⁡(T)≤c+1subscriptQ2𝑇𝑐1\\operatorname{Q}_{2}(T)\\leq c+1 and Q3⁡(T)≤n/c+1subscriptQ3𝑇𝑛𝑐1\\operatorname{Q}_{3}(T)\\leq n/c+1 (2.7).\nIn particular,\nQ2⁡(T)​Q3⁡(T)≤(c+1)c​n+c+1subscriptQ2𝑇subscriptQ3𝑇𝑐1𝑐𝑛𝑐1\\operatorname{Q}_{2}(T)\\operatorname{Q}_{3}(T)\\leq\\tfrac{(c+1)}{c}n+c+1. It follows from Theorem 1.13 (by a straightforward argument) that Qi⁡(T)subscriptQ𝑖𝑇\\operatorname{Q}_{i}(T) must be large for at least two directions i𝑖i, in the following sense: Let T∈𝔽n1⊗𝔽n2⊗𝔽n3𝑇tensor-productsuperscript𝔽subscript𝑛1superscript𝔽subscript𝑛2superscript𝔽subscript𝑛3T\\in\\mathbb{F}^{n_{1}}\\otimes\\mathbb{F}^{n_{2}}\\otimes\\mathbb{F}^{n_{3}} be concise.\nThere are distinct ℓ1,ℓ2∈{1,2,3}subscriptℓ1subscriptℓ2123\\ell_{1},\\ell_{2}\\in\\{1,2,3\\} such that Qℓ1⁡(T)≥(maxi⁡ni)1/2subscriptQsubscriptℓ1𝑇superscriptsubscript𝑖subscript𝑛𝑖12\\operatorname{Q}_{\\ell_{1}}(T)\\geq(\\max_{i}n_{i})^{1/2} and Qℓ2⁡(T)≥(mini⁡ni)1/2subscriptQsubscriptℓ2𝑇superscriptsubscript𝑖subscript𝑛𝑖12\\operatorname{Q}_{\\ell_{2}}(T)\\geq(\\min_{i}n_{i})^{1/2}. From 1.14 we can prove a preliminary asymptotic subrank lower bound Q~⁡(T)≥(mini⁡ni)1/4~Q𝑇superscriptsubscript𝑖subscript𝑛𝑖14\\operatorname{\\underaccent{\\wtilde}{Q}}(T)\\geq(\\min_{i}n_{i})^{1/4}, using the (easy to prove) fact that Q~(T)2≥Qi(T)Qj(T)\\operatorname{\\underaccent{\\wtilde}{Q}}(T)^{2}\\geq\\operatorname{Q}_{i}(T)\\operatorname{Q}_{j}(T) for any distinct i,j∈[ref]3𝑖𝑗delimited-[]3i,j\\in[ref]3. Proving our stronger cube-root lower bound Q~⁡(T)≥(mini⁡ni)1/3~Q𝑇superscriptsubscript𝑖subscript𝑛𝑖13\\operatorname{\\underaccent{\\wtilde}{Q}}(T)\\geq(\\min_{i}n_{i})^{1/3} of Theorem 1.8 requires slightly more work. Work on max-rank (and its relation to dimension) goes back to Dieudonné [Die49], Meshulam [Mes85] and [Fla62]. Another relevant line of work here is on commutative and non-commutative rank, which has established strong connections between max-rank and non-commutative rank [Coh95, FR04, DM18].\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: of the three possible directions. We denote the max-ranks of these spaces by Qi⁡(T)=max-rank​(𝒜i)subscriptQ𝑖𝑇max-ranksubscript𝒜𝑖\\operatorname{Q}_{i}(T)=\\textnormal{max-rank}(\\mathcal{A}_{i}), for i∈[ref]3𝑖delimited-[]3i\\in[ref]3. We prove that for a concise tensor T𝑇T the max-ranks Qi⁡(T)subscriptQ𝑖𝑇\\operatorname{Q}_{i}(T) cannot all be small, in the following sense.
