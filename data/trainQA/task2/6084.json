      "content": "Paper Title: Questions and Concerns About Google’s Quantum Supremacy Claim\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA general model for the samples can be described as follows: The term ϕ​𝐏Citalic-ϕsubscript𝐏𝐶\\phi{\\bf P}_{C} is the ideal distribution described by the circuit C𝐶C multiplied by the fidelity, and this is the “primary signal” we want to detect in the data.\nThe term 𝐍r​osubscript𝐍𝑟𝑜{\\bf N}_{ro} represents the effect of readout errors conditioned on no gate errors. ϕgsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑔\\phi_{g} denotes the probability of not having any gate errors and ϕr​o=:ϕg−ϕ\\phi_{ro}=:\\phi_{g}-\\phi. 𝐍gsubscript𝐍𝑔{\\bf N}_{g} denotes the effect of both gate and readout errors when there are gate errors.\nThe term 𝐍T​(x)subscript𝐍𝑇𝑥{\\bf N}_{T}(x) corresponds to an additional substantial but poorly understood form of noise. (It can be regarded as some large fluctuation (with zero expectation) of the first three terms.)\nIt is reasonable to assume that 𝐍Tsubscript𝐍𝑇{\\bf N}_{T} is uncorrelated with 𝐏Csubscript𝐏𝐶{\\bf P}_{C} and\nthe other terms. The statistical estimators for the parameter ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi under\nthe Google noise model (1) continues to apply under a more detailed model of the form (9) (and this is already emphasized in ).\nIn  (Section 6) we proposed two models for the readout errors and corresponding estimators for the overall effect of readout errors based on the assumption that the effect of gate errors is statistically independent of the effect of readout errors. In a subsequent work in progress  we develop Fourier tools that allow quick computation of these estimators, and we also refine the fidelity estimators according to the Fourier levels.555For earlier studies of Fourier–Walsh expansion in the context of random circuit sampling see Boixo et al. , Gao and Duan [ref]10, and Kalai . See also Kalai and Kindler [ref]19 for an earlier related work on boson sampling. Aharonov et al.  is a recent relevant paper.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: and we also refine the fidelity estimators according to the Fourier levels.555For earlier studies of Fourier–Walsh expansion in the context of random circuit sampling see Boixo et al. , Gao and Duan [ref]10, and Kalai . See also Kalai and Kindler [ref]19 for an earlier related work on boson sampling. Aharonov et al.  is a recent relevant paper.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
