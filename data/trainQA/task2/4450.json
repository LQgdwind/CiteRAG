Chae was with Dongguk University.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBesides using pre-trained models, studies using graph-based models were proposed [ref]12.  suggested the Neural State Machine based on a probabilistic graph for reasoning on VQA.  introduced a video scene graph and caption generation method, and applied them for reasoning on video-QA task. [ref]12 studied a heterogeneous graph alignment network considering inter-and intra-modality for video-QA.  proposed a method to create graphs from visual, linguistic, and numeric features and suggested an aggregator that combines the features. However, because the study focuses on the contents of the image, the method has a limitation in answering a question that requires additional knowledge.  suggested graph-based VQA for capturing the interrelationship between objects and entities of external knowledge by combining concept graph and scene graph. However, the scene graph relation is limited because only locational information is considered, and in the OK-VQA dataset, the extraction method for location-based scene graphs does not show significant performance improvements. Moreover, studies using a pre-trained model and graph-based model have been suggested [ref]15[ref]4. [ref]15 introduced multi-modal graph networks for compositional generalization in VQA, but the method is evaluated with the VQA task that only requires object detection or recognition in answering questions for the object shape and the number of objects. [ref]4 proposed a Knowledge Graph Augmented model using a pre-trained object detection model and graph-based method. However, the knowledge subgraph is generated by using the image object labels and the words of the question without considering the image-question context.  proposed to integrate image-text representation from the BERT-based model and graph information based on the concept of image objects and questions. However, when there are conflicts between the graph and the pre-trained model representation, use of knowledge can hinder the question answering, as described above. This study proposes a new approach that measures semantic inconsistencies between KB and the given problem, and moderates the use of knowledge based on the measurement.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: Besides using pre-trained models, studies using graph-based models were proposed [ref]12.  suggested the Neural State Machine based on a probabilistic graph for reasoning on VQA.  introduced a video scene graph and caption generation method, and applied them for reasoning on\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
