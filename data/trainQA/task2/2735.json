      "content": "Paper Title: Estimation Error Correction in Deep Reinforcement Learning for Deterministic Actor-Critic Methods\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, utilization of deep approaches to approximate the policies of reinforcement learning (RL) agents achieved numerous successes in wide range of applications such as playing Atari games [ref]1, autonomous driving [ref]2, path planning , playing board games like chess, shogi , go  and even beating human players on StarCraft  . Nevertheless, there are several issues regarding the function approximation in the deep reinforcement learning setting . One of the problems resulting from the function approximation is the systematic estimation bias that prevents the learning agent from reaching the maximum performance and deep methods to be applied to the real-world problems [ref]9, . The estimation bias on value estimates in value-based RL algorithms has been studied for discrete action spaces     . Furthermore, similar work in the continuous control domain for actor-critic methods is done for a subcategory of estimation bias, that is, overestimation bias . This paper shows that in deterministic actor-critic methods that aim to overcome the accumulated overestimation bias and high variance, there exists an underestimation bias on the value estimates , . Our work addresses this issue from a probabilistic point of view and improves the current state-of-the-art performance on several continuous control RL tasks. The estimation bias on the action value estimates in value-based deep reinforcement learning is usually studied in two categories: underestimation and overestimation. Overestimation bias, resulting from the maximization of noisy estimates in the standard Q-learning, induces an accumulated error through the learning stage . In a function approximation setting, such an estimation noise is unavoidable as deep neural networks represent the action-value functions . This inaccuracy in the action values is further exaggerated due to the temporal difference learning [ref]9. On the other hand, underestimation bias is an outcome of Q-learning variants that aim to eliminate the accumulated overestimation bias and high variance on the value estimates , . Even though the standard deep Q-learning modifications are shown to overcome the overestimation bias and high variance build-up, the existence of underestimated state-action values can still degrade the performance of an RL agent by assigning low values to “good” state-action pairs, causing suboptimal and divergent behavior. We begin by establishing that this underestimation phenomenon is present in delayed policy gradient that utilizes a pair of critics, namely, Clipped Double Q-learning , in the continuous actor-critic settings. During training, the minimum of the estimates by two critics is used to construct the target Q-value in the temporal difference learning [ref]9. Unfortunately, taking the minimum of Q-values in learning the targets produces a consistent underestimation of Q-value estimates despite the decoupled actor and critics. To address this problem, we first show that variance of the reinforcement signals that the agent encounters during the learning phase increases the underestimation bias. Then, to overcome underestimation bias and improve the performance of the deterministic actor-critic methods, we introduce a deep Q-learning variant that combines the ideas behind Clipped Double Q-learning , and Maxmin Q-learning , Triplet Critic Update. Our approach leverages the notion that along with two value estimators, the value estimate of an additional estimator can be used to construct an approximate upper and lower bound to the value estimate. We build our modification on the state-of-the-art deterministic actor-critic algorithm, Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) , and introduce the Triplet Critic Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TCD3) algorithm. Our deterministic actor-critic algorithm reduces the underestimation bias to a negligible margin and prevents the accumulated overestimation bias and high variance. We evaluate our algorithm on 12 continuous control tasks from OpenAI Gym , where we show that Triplet Critic Update significantly improves the performance of TD3 . For the reproducibility concerns, we run our experiments across a large set of seeds for the sake of a fair evaluation procedure.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: In recent years, utilization of deep approaches to approximate the policies of reinforcement learning (RL) agents achieved numerous successes in wide range of applications such as playing Atari games [ref]1, autonomous driving [ref]2, path planning , playing board games like chess, shogi , go  and even beating human players on StarCraft  .
