      "content": "Paper Title: A Framework to Implement 1+N Multi-task Fine-tuning Pattern in LLMs Using The CGC-LoRA Algorithm\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLarge language models (LLMs) have made great progress recent two years  [ref]2  and numerous versions of LLMs, namely, ChatGPT  , LlaMa [ref]6, ERNIE , and ChatGLM , sprung up. Worldwide high-tech companies and non-profit research institutes are paying significant attention to the evolution of LLMs since they have already shown typically impressive performance on varied applications. For example, Wang and Thai in  0 demonstrate that LLMs get outstanding achievements on document-level machine translation and meanwhile LLMs is proved by 1 2 to be equipped with dramatic multilingual learning capability. Besides, LLMs present remarkable talent on multi-modal operation, such as precisely producing websites from handwritten text and determining humorous components within images 3. As for recommendation system, LLMs also indicates a non-negligible potential on a variety of tasks, including sequential recommendation, rating prediction, explanation generation, review summary, direct recommendation 4 5 6. Lastly but even more incredibly, Wei and Huang in 7 8 announce that the reasoning ability of LLMs can even be elicited by a chain-of-thought (CoT) algorithm. The majority of LLMs, especially for those extraodinarily authoritative ones like ChatGPT and LlaMa, are pre-trained on general purposes using universal data   [ref]6. Although the few-shot learning and even zero-shot learning capability of LLMs can be stimulated via in-context learning 9  , the adaptation to a specific territory by fine-tuning is consistently favourable  . For instance, Wang in  determines that fine-tuned large language model, named after Hua Tuo, outperforms the original LlaMa on Chinese medical knowledge. Additionally, CodeT5+ , a follow-on version of T5 fine-tuned on coding-related data, can achieve new SoTA results on the HumanEval, a specialized dataset on coding-related tasks , against other fundamental pre-trained LLMs including the basic version of T5 model. Therefore, in this work, we engage in the open-source LLMs and fine-tune them with task-specific datasets. To a great extent, two inevitable dilemmas will occur when applying fine-tuning process to pre-trained LLMs. Firstly, a certain field, in most situations, involves a large numbers of heterogeneous tasks and consequently, a general fine-tuned LLMs cannot cover all tasks completely, called Various Task Impact [ref]2 . Considering the real-world advertisement recommendation area, it encompasses a wide range of assignments, like sequential recommendation, rating prediction, explanation generation, review summary, direct recommendation, etc., and these diverse sub-tasks usually have objectives of similarity at different levels and even of conflict 4 6. To overcome this challenge, two feasible solutions are presented: (i) Multiple Independent Models: Fine-tuning an independent model for each particular task is practical, however, this strategy appeals considerable professional knowledge and a mass of labor. Also, information is precisely isolated and they cannot be shared across each task smoothly  . What is more important, full parameters of a few fine-tuned LLMs for different tasks need to be saved that is unreasonable and even absurd, especially considering applications on mobile device due to the memory limitation. (ii) An Integrated Model: Fine-tuning an integrated model using samples from all tasks simultaneously can solve the information isolation and memory limitation problems mentioned above. As for this strategy, although knowledge is not segregated, at least in theory, the seesawing problem is frequently reported and it signifies that the enhancement of one task leads to the degradation of others  . Secondly, High Computing Cost is another challenge. Since the LLMs having billions of parameters dominate nearly all areas, fine-tuning full parameters becomes extremely costly and utopian  . Even if any companies or institutes can afford such astronomical computing cost, a limited amount of available data will ultimately cause over-fitting . As a result, to have LLMs work excellently on applications of a wide variety, these two problems are urgently to be solved preferably. Considering the Various Task Impact, different kinds of multi-task learning (MTL) models have been proposed  0, among which hard-parameter-sharing structure is designed primarily 1. Although it, to some degree, promotes knowledge circulation among each task, negative transfer problem is exposed as parameters are straightforwardly and even wildly shared. To solve this issue, cross-stitch network 2 and sluice network 3 are announced by Misra and Ruder12, separately. Both networks can merge information from various tasks selectively as the combination is controlled linearly by a set of weights. Nonetheless, since weights stay the same for all samples, the seesawing phenomenon cannot be completely addressed. Next, the gate structure and both cross- and self-attention mechanisms are demonstrated to further solved the seesawing issue. Additionally, mixture-of-expert (MOE) related models 4  first proposes to combine task-common experts by fusing the gate module and the attention module. In particular, both expert and attention modules are shared among all tasks while no task-specific module is scheduled. In contrast, Tang in  releases a customized gate control (CGC) module, which separates task-common and task-specific experts explicitly to keep clear of parameter disagreement caused by complicated correlation among tasks. Such an explicit design in virtue of professional prior knowledge is conducive to determine the convergence direction more accurately in practice 5. Besides the Various Task Impact problem, the High Computing Cost is another roadblock when MTL frameworks are applied to fine-tune LLMs since current frameworks are principally appropriate to full-parameter fine-tuning algorithms. Fortunately, a class of fine-tuning methods called parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), which freeze parameters of pre-trained LLMs and instead only tune a delimited quantity of additional parameters, are explored to solve the high computing cost issue 6 7. Among proposed PEFT approaches, low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a typical one and it suggests to just train a set of paired low-rank matrices to provide LLMs with adaptation capacity6. However, making PEFT methods be compatible with MTL frameworks is still an open question . To solve the issues of Various Task Impact and High Computing Cost simultaneously by integrating MTL and PEFT, we proposed a universal framework to implement 1+N1𝑁1+N multi-task fine-tuning pattern in LLMs. Specifically, a large range of tasks are divided into multiple clusters based on the professional prior knowledge or Inter-Task Affinity proposed by 8 and for a certain cluster, a central LLM is fine-tuned to adjust to these tasks by LoRA of a multi-task edition. This central LLM with sets of plug-in LoRA modules serves as the ultimate model that can handle diverse tasks from different fields with ease. As an essential component of the whole framework, we further propose an innovative unified LoRA and CGC structure, name after CGC-LoRA, inspired by MOE-LoRA  and it provides the framework with an effective and efficient fine-tuning performance in MTL situations. In detail, thanks to the explicit separation of task-common and task-specific experts, CGC is proved to have a practically preferred convergence behavior  and we demonstrate that such a valuable character can be smoothly transferred to the CGC-LoRA architecture. As the supplement to the basic edition of LoRA where a singular set of paired low-rank matrices are fine-tuned, CGC-LoRA incorporates multiple sets of paired low-rank matrices that stand for task-common and task-shared experts. Moreover, to keep the counts of trainable parameters the same, the summation of rank of task-common and task-specific matrices is equal to the rank of the original LoRA scheme. Furthermore, to advance the fusion capacity of experts, a task motivated gate function is proposed to adaptively determine the contribution of those two types of experts to each task only based on the task ID of the input sample. Eventually, the contributions of this work are summarized as follows: We announce a framework to implement 1+N1𝑁1+N multi-task fine-tuning pattern in LLMs, which can equip general pre-trained LLMs with adaptation to a large range of unseen tasks. It is worthy noting that this is a universal framework and it can be compatible with LoRA of any multi-task editions (e.g., MOE-LoRA , LoRAHub 9, and proposed CGC-LoRA). We associate the power of both CGC structure and LoRA scheme by designing an ingenious unified MTL PEFT architecture. Besides, to lubricate the cooperation between task-common and task-specific experts, a task motivated gate function is proposed to regulate the weights of all experts and completely, determine the distinct contributions of experts to each task. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two public multi-task datasets: (i) the Prompt Chinese Biomedical Language Understanding Evaluation (PromptCBLUE) dataset 0 1; (ii) the Firefly dataset 2. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework over other long-tested baselines. To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first effort to evaluate the dominance of the framework equipped with a MTL-PEFT-unified structure for LLM-driven models on vast of applications using multiple public datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Large language models (LLMs) have made great progress recent two years  [ref]2  and numerous versions of LLMs, namely, ChatGPT  , LlaMa [ref]6, ERNIE , and ChatGLM , sprung up.
