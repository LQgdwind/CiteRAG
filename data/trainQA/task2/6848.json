      "content": "Paper Title: LFS-GAN: Lifelong Few-Shot Image Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning has achieved remarkable success in recent years, particularly in a single task learning on a large dataset such as ImageNet [ref]9 or FFHQ 4.\nHowever, obtaining a large amount of refined data for real-world applications is prohibitively expensive, and there are many domains where only limited data can be collected, such as the artistic domain.\nAdditionally, when faced with long sequences of tasks over time, it is inevitable to train a new model for each target task. In this context, many studies have recently highlighted the importance of lifelong few-shot learning.\nLifelong few-shot learning combines two challenging settings: lifelong learning and few-shot learning.\nIt seeks to overcome catastrophic forgetting    when learning a sequence of tasks over time, while learning from limited data without any overfitting problem.\nBy integrating the concepts of lifelong and few-shot learning, lifelong few-shot learning holds great potential for real-world applications where data is limited or costly to obtain, and where learning a new model for each task is not practical. Previous studies on lifelong few-shot learning have primarily focused on discriminative tasks   1   .\nHowever, lifelong few-shot learning on generative tasks is unexplored before.\nLifelong few-shot image generation task involves training a model to generate realistic and diverse images from handful training images, while continually learning new tasks and preserving the ability to generate images from the previous domains (see Figure 1).\nThere are two key challenges in this setting.\nFirst, since the model learns tasks sequentially, it easily forgets the ability to generate samples of the previous tasks.\nSecond, since the model learns from a biased and sparse distribution, it suffers from the mode collapse problem , i.e., it is prone to re-generate the same training samples or produce similar images regardless of the noises provided.\nAddressing these challenges is critical to enable the successful application of lifelong few-shot image generation in the real-world, where data is limited or costly to obtain. To alleviate catastrophic forgetting, recent studies in the field of lifelong image generation have proposed a weight modulator inspired by the affine transformation 0, which enables generative models to learn task-specific information in lifelong setting    .\nHowever, conventional generative models 2 4 5 3 consist of convolutional layers with high-dimensional weights, resulting in a significant increase of the number of parameters required to modulate them.\nAs the number of tasks increases, the memory required to store these parameters becomes a significant burden.\nFurthermore, since lifelong generative models are designed to synthesize decent images from sufficient data, they suffer from mode collapse with handful training images.\nIn the realm of few-shot image generation task, many works propose regularization-based methods to maintain the rich diversity of source models 9   .\nHowever, they are prone to forget how to generate the previous tasks when learning a new task, since they fine-tune the models to learn the new task.\nA recent study  has introduced a modulation-based approach. This method divides the weights into be modulated and fine-tuned parts, based on their significance. Although this work adopts a modulation technique, it suffers from catastrophic forgetting due to its fine-tuning part. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework Lifelong Few-Shot Generative Adversarial Network (LFS-GAN).\nOur LFS-GAN learns a new task via a powerful weight modulation technique called the Learnable Factorized Tensor (LeFT) that captures task-specific knowledge with low memory costs while freezing learned weights from the source task.\nOur proposed LeFT reduces the memory burden by decomposing the weight tensor and restoring it during the forward operation to modulate the weight.\nThis method enables the efficient and effective generation of high-quality images.\nFurthermore, we propose a cluster-wise mode seeking loss to improve the diversity of generated images.\nThe mode seeking loss  has shown its effect to diversify the generated images of GANs.\nHowever, in a low-data circumstance, a simple application of mode seeking loss shows less effect because the generated images tend to be similar to the training images.\nThus, we alter the mode seeking loss to be effective in our task and achieve greater diversity.\nLastly, we find that the intra-cluster LPIPS cannot capture the imbalanced generation with respect to training images. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel diversity measure called Balanced Inter- and Intra-cluster LPIPS (B-LPIPS) to accurately evaluate generation diversity in our task. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows: To the best of our knowledge, we formulate and tackle a challenging lifelong few-shot image generation task for the first time. We introduce a novel weight modulation technique, called Learnable Factorized Tensor (LeFT), which enables the generative model to learn new tasks without forgetting and significant parameter growth. To enhance diversity in the generated images, we propose a cluster-wise mode seeking loss that maximizes the relative distances of intermediate latent codes, feature maps, and images. Extensive experiments, including our novel metric B-LPIPS, demonstrate that LFS-GAN outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods on generating high-quality and diverse images not only in lifelong few-shot image generation task but also in few-shot image generation task.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in recent years, particularly in a single task learning on a large dataset such as ImageNet [ref]9 or FFHQ 4.\nHowever, obtaining a large amount of refined data for real-world applications is prohibitively expensive, and there are many domains where only limited data can be collected, such\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
