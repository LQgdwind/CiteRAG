      "content": "Paper Title: Neighborhood Contrastive Learning for Novel Class Discovery\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLearning from labeled data has been a widely studied topic in the field of machine learning, and more recently in deep learning [ref]15  .\nDespite tremendous success, supervised learning techniques largely rely on the availability of massive amounts of annotated data .\nTo get rid of the difficulty and expensive cost of annotating,\nthe machine learning community has shifted the attention to techniques that can learn with limited or completely non-annotated data. To this end, many semi-supervised   and unsupervised learning   [ref]14  methods have been proposed, which achieve promising results compared to supervised learning methods. Nonetheless, not much effort has been made to exploit prior knowledge from existing labeled datasets and use it to discover unknown classes that are not present in the labeled data. In this paper, we address one such relevant problem, called Novel Class Discovery (NCD)  [ref]13, where we are given a labeled dataset and an unlabeled dataset, differing in class label space.\nThe goal of NCD is to learn a model that can cluster the unlabeled data by exploiting the latent commonalities from the labeled data (see the top half of Fig. 1). Importantly, the availability of labeled data does not guarantee transferability because the patterns learned from the labeled data with off-the-shelf models might not be useful for the unlabeled data. This poses NCD apart from semi-supervised learning paradigm, where the label space is shared between labeled and unlabeled data, and also makes it more challenging. The NCD task finds relevance in many real-world scenarios where the volume of unlabeled data keeps growing (e.g., multimedia). It is desirable to leverage the existing annotated data (collected from known classes) to explore the new unlabeled data from novel classes, rather than in a completely unsupervised fashion from scratch. With that goal in mind, this work proposes a holistic learning framework that uses contrastive loss [ref]14  formulation to learn discriminative features from both the labeled and unlabelled data, which is absent in most NCD methods  [ref]13  .\nSubsequently, we introduce two key ideas in the paper. The first idea is to exploit the fact that the local neighborhood of a sample (query) in the embedding space will contain samples which most likely belong to the same semantic category of the query, and can be considered as pseudo-positives. Note that this is specific to the NCD setting, where we can pre-train a feature extractor with supervision. We exploit this observation in the context of contrastive learning to bring the query closer to its pseudo-positives, which is termed as Neighborhood Contrastive Learning (NCL) (see the bottom half of Fig. 1). These numerous positives allow us to obtain a much stronger learning signal when compared to the traditional contrastive formulation realized with only two views  [ref]14. Our second idea is to address the better selection of negatives to further improve the contrastive learning. Peculiar to the NCD task where we are given labeled samples of the known classes (a.k.a true negatives of any unlabeled instance), we exploit them, together with the unlabeled samples, to generate synthetic samples in the feature space using a mixing strategy and treat them as hard negatives (see Fig. 1). This circumvents the problem of falsely treating the true positives as negatives [ref]14 . We call this process as Hard Negative Generation (HNG), which is effective and can produce a boost in performance when employed together with NCL. To summarize, our contributions are threefold: We propose Neighborhood Contrastive Learning (NCL) for NCD, which exploits the local neighborhood in the embedding space of a given query. Our NCL recruits more positive samples for the contrastive loss formulation, significantly improving the clustering accuracy. We propose to aid the contrastive learning by leveraging the labeled samples to generate hard negative samples through feature mixing. With labeled data from various classes, the proposed Hard Negative Generation (HNG) can obtain consistent improvement. Extensive experiments on three NCD benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and show that we advance the state-of-the-art approaches by large margins (\\eg, clustering accuracy +13% on CIFAR-100 and +8% on ImageNet).\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: Learning from labeled data has been a widely studied topic in the field of machine learning, and more recently in deep learning [ref]15  .\nDespite tremendous success, supervised learning techniques largely rely on the availability of massive amounts of annotated data .\nTo get rid of the difficulty and expensive cost of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
