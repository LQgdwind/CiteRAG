      "content": "Paper Title: SplineGen: a generative model for B-spline approximation of unorganized points\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nParametrization methods.\nBecause of the importance of parameterization in B-spline approximation, many research studies on this topic have been carried out. Recently, Scholz and Jüttler provided an informative summary on the classification and development of those methods in their paper . Basically, heuristic methods are the dominant means of parameterization, e.g., uniform , chord length , centripetal , universal [ref]34, and Foley-Nielson , among many others.\nSuch basic versions have also been used as an initial guess for the parameterization and then optimized to achieve better approximation results, e.g., . Typically, this leads to a highly non-linear constrained optimization problem. One line of relevant research studies focuses on the solving algorithms for this optimization problem, e.g., particle swarm optimizers  , and global optimizers . The other line designs various error metrics to control the “goodness” of the final parameterization, e.g., squared distance errors  and angular speed uniformness . Knot placement methods. Existing knot placement methods may be classified into two types: knot assignment that computes the whole knot vectors simultaneously; and knot refinement that iteratively modifies initial knots until an error threshold is met. To reflect the distribution of data points and guarantee that every knot span includes at least one parameter, there are knot assignment methods like AVG (averaging technique) (for point number m𝑚m = control point number n𝑛n) and KTP (knot placement technique) (for point number m>𝑚absentm> control point number n𝑛n) . Because KTP will have stability issues when m𝑚m is slightly greater than n𝑛n. Piegl and Tiller  proposed a stability-enhanced version (NKTP) of KTP by using an averaging method. Like in parameterization, these methods have also been used as initial guesses and then optimized by iterative knot insertion  . The essential task here is to determine when and where to insert the new knots. Several heuristics have been developed, such as angle variations , curvatures , and minimum knot size . Evolutionary optimization algorithms   and neural network-based optimization  have also been used to determine the knot insertion position. The methods discussed above have proven effective in many applications, but due to their heuristic nature, they cannot provide acceptable results in all of the potential cases. This motivates the recent use of machine learning methods to carry out parameterization and knot placement, in an end-to-end manner.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: the classification and development of those methods in their paper .
