      "content": "Paper Title: On the pathwidth of hyperbolic 3-manifoldsThis paper is based on previously unpublished parts of the author‚Äôs PhD thesis [24].\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAlgorithms in computational 3-manifold topology typically take a triangulation as input and return topological information about the underlying manifold. The difficulty of extracting the desired information, however, might greatly depend on the choice of the input triangulation. In recent years, several computationally hard problems about triangulated 3-manifolds were shown to admit algorithmic solutions that are fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) in the treewidth111The treewidth is a structural graph parameter measuring the ‚Äútree-likeness‚Äù of a graph, cf.¬†Section 3. of the dual graph of the input triangulation  [ref]13   .222For related work on FPT-algorithms in knot theory, see  and  and the references therein. These algorithms still require exponential time to terminate in the worst case. However, for triangulations with dual graph of bounded treewidth they run in polynomial time.333The running times are measured in terms of the number of tetrahedra in the input triangulation.,444Some of these algorithms   have been implemented in the topology software Regina  [ref]11. In the light of these algorithms, it is compelling to consider the treewidth tw‚Å°(‚Ñ≥)tw‚Ñ≥\\operatorname{tw}(\\mathcal{M}) of a compact 333-manifold ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\\mathcal{M}, defined as the smallest treewidth of the dual graph of any triangulation thereof. Over the last few years, the quantitative relationship between the treewidth and other properties of 3-manifolds has been studied in various settings.555See  for related work in knot theory concerning a different notion of treewidth for knot diagrams. The author together with Spreer showed, for instance, that the Heegaard genus always gives an upper bound on the treewidth (even on the pathwidth) , and together with Wagner they established that, for certain families of 3-manifolds the treewidth can be arbitrary large .666For the precise statements of these results cf.¬†the inequalities (10) and (11) in Section 3. For further results and a detailed discussion we refer to the author‚Äôs PhD thesis [ref]24. Recently, Maria and Purcell have shown that, in the realm of hyperbolic 3-manifolds another important invariant, the volume, yields an upper bound on the treewidth . They proved the existence of a universal constant C>0ùê∂0C>0, such that, for every closed hyperbolic 3-manifold ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\\mathcal{M} with treewidth tw‚Å°(‚Ñ≥)tw‚Ñ≥\\operatorname{tw}(\\mathcal{M}) and volume vol‚Å°(‚Ñ≥)vol‚Ñ≥\\operatorname{vol}(\\mathcal{M}) the following inequality holds: In this article we improve upon (1) by showing that the volume provides a linear upper bound even on the pathwidth of a hyperbolic 3-manifold‚Äîa quantity closely related to, but potentially much larger than the treewidth. More precisely, we prove the following theorem. There exists a universal constant C‚Ä≤>0superscriptùê∂‚Ä≤0C^{\\prime}>0 such that, for any closed, orientable and hyperbolic 333-manifold ‚Ñ≥‚Ñ≥\\mathcal{M} with pathwidth pw‚Å°(‚Ñ≥)pw‚Ñ≥\\operatorname{pw}(\\mathcal{M}) and volume vol‚Å°(‚Ñ≥)vol‚Ñ≥\\operatorname{vol}(\\mathcal{M}), we have\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: tractable (FPT) in the treewidth111The treewidth is a structural graph parameter measuring the ‚Äútree-likeness‚Äù of a graph, cf.¬†Section 3. of the dual graph of the input triangulation  [ref]13   .222For related work on FPT-algorithms in knot theory, see  and  and the references therein.
