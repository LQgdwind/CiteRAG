      "content": "Paper Title: SuperGaussians: Enhancing Gaussian Splatting Using Primitives with Spatially Varying Colors\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, 3DGS  achieves impressive visual quality and real-time novel-view synthesis by using 3D Gaussians for scene representation, interleaved optimization of anisotropic covariance, and a fast visibility-aware rendering algorithm, demonstrating superior results on several established datasets. Due to the excellent explicit expression ability of 3DGS , many methods based on Gaussian splatting have been proposed.\nScaffold-GS  uses anchor points to distribute local 3D Gaussians and dynamically predicts their attributes based on viewing direction and distance, reducing redundant Gaussians and improving scene coverage, thereby enhancing rendering quality.\nMip-splatting  introduces a 3D smoothing filter to constrain the size of 3D Gaussian primitives and a 2D Mip filter to mitigate aliasing and dilation issues, demonstrating effectiveness across multiple scales.\nGES [ref]10 improves 3D scene representation efficiency and accuracy over Gaussian Splatting by using fewer particles and a frequency-modulated loss, significantly reducing memory footprint and increasing rendering speed.\n3D-HGS  addresses the limitations of 3DGS  in representing discontinuous functions, demonstrating improved performance and rendering quality without compromising speed.\nPixelSplat [ref]6 introduces a feed-forward model that reconstructs 3D radiance fields from image pairs using 3D Gaussian primitives, achieving significantly faster 3D reconstruction on novel view synthesis.\nFollowing 3DGS , 2DGS  and Gaussian Surfels  was proposed by compressing the ellipsoid into a Gaussian surfel by defining the shortest axis of the ellipsoid as the normal vector, achieving high-quality geometric reconstruction while retaining the ability to reconstruct from novel views.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: introduces a 3D smoothing filter to constrain the size of 3D Gaussian primitives and a 2D Mip filter to mitigate aliasing and dilation issues, demonstrating effectiveness across multiple scales.\nGES [ref]10 improves 3D scene representation efficiency and accuracy over Gaussian Splatting by using fewer particles and a frequency-modulated loss, significantly reducing memory footprint and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
