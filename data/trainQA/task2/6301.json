      "content": "Paper Title: A Review on Knowledge Graphs for Healthcare: Resources, Applications, and Promises\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA knowledge graph (KG) is a data structure that captures the relationships between different entities and their attributes [ref]1 . KG models and integrates data from various sources, including structured and unstructured data, and has been studied to support a wide range of applications such as search engines , recommendation systems  [ref]5, and question answering [ref]6   . Healthcare Knowledge Graph (HKG) facilitates an interpretable representation of medical concepts, e.g., drugs and disease, as well as the relations among those medical concepts. This data structure enables the connection of contexts and enhances clinical research and decision-making  . On the data side, HKG is usually built on complex medical systems such as electronic health records, medical literature, clinical guidelines, and patient-generated data  . However, these data resources are often heterogeneous and distributed, which makes it challenging to integrate and analyze them effectively . This data heterogeneity can also lead to incomplete or inconsistent data representations, limiting their usefulness for downstream healthcare tasks . Additionally, the current use of domain-specific knowledge graphs may result in limited coverage and granularity of the knowledge captured across different levels. This hinders identifying correlations and relationships between medical concepts from multiple domains. These challenges highlight the need for continued research on HKGs to realize their full potential. On the modeling side, the construction of HKGs can be done either from scratch or by integrating existing dataset resources. Many crucial steps, such as entity and relation extraction, can be optimized with natural language processing tools and algorithms.\nRecently, there have been significant advancements in general domain knowledge extraction, thanks to pre-trained large language models (LLMs) such as BERT , GPT Series , and others.\nThese models revolutionize the field and make it possible to integrate heterogeneous medical data from various sources effectively. The use of pre-trained models has also led to the development of more accurate and comprehensive medical ontologies and taxonomies   0 1 2. This allows for the evaluation of generated contents from LLMs and reduces LLM hallucination. A comprehensive healthcare knowledge graph has the potential to contribute to health research across various levels 3  4. At the micro-scientific level, HKGs can help researchers identify new phenotypic and genotypic correlations and understand the underlying mechanisms of disease 5, leading to more targeted and effective treatments 6 . At the clinical care level, HKGs can be used to develop clinical decision support systems that provide clinicians with relevant information, improving clinical workflows and patient outcomes 7 8. Therefore, a thorough review of existing literature on HKGs becomes an essential roadmap and invaluable resource to drive transformative advancements in the field. This review is the first comprehensive overview of HKGs, covering contents shown in Figure 1.\nSpecifically, in Section 2, we delve into the construction pipelines of HKGs, including both building from scratch and integration approaches, and highlight the key techniques employed in HKG construction. Additionally, we explore two standard utilization methods of HKGs, namely model-free and model-based approaches. In Section 3, we compile a comprehensive summary of existing HKG resources with their scopes and applications. Furthermore, Section 4 investigates the literature on mainstream health applications, offering an in-depth overview of the diverse use cases of HKGs in healthcare.\nFinally, we address promising research opportunities in the era of LLMs in Section 5.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: A knowledge graph (KG) is a data structure that captures the relationships between different entities and their attributes [ref]1 .

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
