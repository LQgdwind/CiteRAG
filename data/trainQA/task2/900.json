      "content": "Paper Title: Fine-grained complexity of the list homomorphism problem: feedback vertex set and cutwidthThis work is supported by Polish National Science Centre grant no. 2018/31/D/ST6/00062.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA rich family of graph problems that generalize k𝑘k-Coloring comes from considering graph homomorphisms.\nA homomorphism from a graph G𝐺G to a graph H𝐻H (called target) is an edge-preserving mapping from V​(G)𝑉𝐺V(G) to V​(H)𝑉𝐻V(H). In the Hom(H𝐻H) problem we ask if the input graph G𝐺G admits a homomorphism to H𝐻H, which is usually treated as a fixed graph.\nObserve that if H𝐻H is Kksubscript𝐾𝑘K_{k}, i.e., a complete graph on k𝑘k vertices, then Hom(H𝐻H) is equivalent to k𝑘k-Coloring.\nThe complexity classification of Hom(H𝐻H) was provided by the seminal paper by Hell and Nešetřil : the problem is polynomial-time solvable if H𝐻H is bipartite or has a vertex with a loop, and NP-complete otherwise.\nThis problem can also be considered in a list setting, where every vertex v𝑣v of G𝐺G is equipped with a list L​(v)⊆V​(H)𝐿𝑣𝑉𝐻L(v)\\subseteq V(H), and we ask for a homomorphism from G𝐺G to H𝐻H, which additionally respects lists L𝐿L. The corresponding computational problem is denoted by LHom(H𝐻H). The complexity dichotomy for LHom(H𝐻H) was proven in three steps: first, for reflexive graphs H𝐻H (i.e., where every vertex has a loops) by Feder and Hell , then for irreflexive graphs H𝐻H (i.e., with no loops) by Feder, Hell, and Huang , and finally, for all graphs H𝐻H, again by Feder, Hell, and Huang .\nThe problem appears to be polynomial-time solvable if H𝐻H is a so-called bi-arc graph. We will now skip the definition of this class and return to it in section 2. Let us also mention a special case if H𝐻H is irreflexive and bipartite: then the LHom(H𝐻H) problem is in P if the complement of H𝐻H is a circular-arc graphs, and otherwise the problem is NP-complete. This special case will play a prominent role in our paper. Let us point out that despite the obvious similarity of Hom(H𝐻H) and LHom(H𝐻H), the methods used to prove lower bounds are very different.\nIn case of the Hom(H𝐻H), all hardness results use some algebraic tools, which allow us to capture the structure of the whole graph H𝐻H at once.\nOn the other hand, hardness proofs for LHom(H𝐻H) are purely combinatorial and are based on the analysis of some small subgraphs of H𝐻H. The study of the complexity of Hom(H𝐻H), LHom(H𝐻H), and their variants led to many interesting algorithms and lower bounds       . Let us mention few of them, that are most relevant to our results. For more information about the combinatorics and complexity of graph homomorphisms, we refer the reader to the comprehensive monograph by Hell and Nešetřil . A brute-force approach to solving Hom(H𝐻H) (and LHom(H𝐻H)) has complexity |V​(H)|n⋅n𝒪​(1)⋅superscript𝑉𝐻𝑛superscript𝑛𝒪1|V(H)|^{n}\\cdot n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}.\nThis can be improved if H𝐻H has some special structure: several algorithms with running time f​(H)n⋅n𝒪​(1)⋅𝑓superscript𝐻𝑛superscript𝑛𝒪1f(H)^{n}\\cdot n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)} were obtained, where f𝑓f is a function of some structural parameter of H𝐻H. Among possible choices of this parameter we can find the maximum degree (folklore), treewidth , clique-width , or bandwidth of the complement . A natural open question was whether one can obtain a cnsuperscript𝑐𝑛c^{n} algorithm, where c𝑐c is a constant that does not depend on H𝐻H .\nThis question was finally answered in the negative by Cygan et al. , who proved that the brute force algorithm is essentially optimal under the ETH. If we are interested in the complexity, parameterized by the treewidth of G𝐺G, then both Hom(H𝐻H) and LHom(H𝐻H) can be solved in time |V​(H)|tw⁡(G)⋅n𝒪​(1)⋅superscript𝑉𝐻tw𝐺superscript𝑛𝒪1|V(H)|^{{\\operatorname{tw}(G)}}\\cdot n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)} by a naive dynamic programming (again, provided that G𝐺G is given with a tree decomposition).\nThe fine-grained complexity of the Hom(H𝐻H) problem, parameterized by the treewidth of G𝐺G, was studied recently by Okrasa and Rzążewski . Using mostly algebraic tools, they were able obtain tight bounds, conditioned on two conjectures from algebraic graph theory from early 2000s. The analogous question for the LHom(H𝐻H) problem was first investigated by Egri, Marx, and Rzążewski  for reflexive graphs H𝐻H, and then by Okrasa, Piecyk, and Rzążewski   for the general case.\nThe authors defined a new graph invariant i∗​(H)superscript𝑖𝐻i^{*}(H), and proved the following, tight bounds (recall that always tw⁡(G)⩽pw⁡(G)tw𝐺pw𝐺{\\operatorname{tw}(G)}\\leqslant{\\operatorname{pw}(G)}). Let H𝐻H be a connected, non-bi-arc graph. Even if H𝐻H is given in the input, every instance (G,L)𝐺𝐿(G,L) of LHom​(H)LHom𝐻\\textsc{LHom}(H) can be solved in time i∗​(H)tw⁡(G)⋅(|V​(G)|⋅|V​(H)|)𝒪​(1)⋅superscript𝑖superscript𝐻tw𝐺superscript⋅𝑉𝐺𝑉𝐻𝒪1i^{*}(H)^{{\\operatorname{tw}(G)}}\\cdot(|V(G)|\\cdot|V(H)|)^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}, provided that G𝐺G is given along with a tree decomposition of width tw⁡(G)tw𝐺{\\operatorname{tw}(G)}. Even if H𝐻H is fixed, there is no algorithm that solves every instance (G,L)𝐺𝐿(G,L) of LHom​(H)LHom𝐻\\textsc{LHom}(H) in time (i∗​(H)−ε)pw⁡(G)⋅|V​(G)|𝒪​(1)⋅superscriptsuperscript𝑖𝐻𝜀pw𝐺superscript𝑉𝐺𝒪1(i^{*}(H)-\\varepsilon)^{{\\operatorname{pw}(G)}}\\cdot|V(G)|^{\\mathcal{O}(1)} for any ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, unless the SETH fails. To the best of our knowledge, the complexity depending on other structural parameters of G𝐺G was not investigated.\nIn this paper, we make some progress to fill this gap. In particular, our main motivation is the following question by Jansen [ref]37, repeated by Okrasa, Piecyk, Rzążewski  . Is there a universal constant c𝑐c, such that for every H𝐻H, every instance G𝐺G of the Hom(H𝐻H) problem can be solved in time cctw⁡(G)⋅|V​(G)|𝒪​(1)⋅superscript𝑐ctw𝐺superscript𝑉𝐺𝒪1c^{{\\operatorname{ctw}(G)}}\\cdot|V(G)|^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}?\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: depending on other structural parameters of G𝐺G was not investigated.\nIn this paper, we make some progress to fill this gap.
