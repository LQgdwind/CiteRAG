      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Volumetric Object Selection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nObject selection is an important task in an artist’s workflow. With the growth of 3D photography, there is a need to support a suite of editing operations, such as object selection, that are readily available for 2D photographs. In this work, we consider object selection in neural volumetric 3D representations. Neural volumetric 3D representations—explicitly via Multi-plane Images (MPI)  or implicitly via Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) —recover a remarkably accurate 3D representation of a scene from a given set of multi-view images. These representations have been shown to be particularly useful for novel-view synthesis     [ref]24 [ref]52, as this is the task that they are trained for. However, beyond just visualizing the same scene from a novel viewpoint, often we want to create a 3D reconstruction of an object so that we can extract it, and place it in a different context. There is, of course, substantial research in automatic object segmentation. However, user-driven methods, e.g., Photoshop, remain the most common means, as which object to select is fundamentally a high-level decision. Similar user-driven methods for 3D object segmentation are particularly important for augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) applications, e.g., if one wants to composite a selected object into a new scene, apply a filter to a selected object, remove a selected object, or share a real-world object with friends in an AR/VR environment. While user-driven segmentation for 2D images has been studied for decades 1   , very little is known about how segmentation would work in those novel 3D scene representations. Specifically, for image segmentation, early works focus on energy minimization with graph cuts , different forms of user interactions  7  , and ways to obtain better object priors 5 4. More recently, research has focused on encoding object priors with deep nets 9    . Naively applying these techniques to the set of images that are used to capture neural volumetric 3D representations is sub-optimal.\nFor example, simply transferring user interactions like scribbles from one image to another using a known camera transformation may fail to cover the intended object because of occlusions. Similarly, transferring an appearance model learned on one image to all remaining images is challenging because of appearance and lighting changes. Asking a user to interact with all images requires an interface that may not be intuitive or require excessive work, and furthermore may produce a segmentation that is not view-consistent. For those reasons, novel user-driven 3D segmentation techniques are warranted. We propose a novel voxel feature embedding that incorporates discretized features from the neural volumetric 3D representation and image features from all input views. Formally, we first project user interactions in the form of 2D scribbles from a reference image to sparse 3D locations using the reconstructed scene. We then learn a 3D object representation model that incorporates image features from all views via a developed multi-view feature embedding. We use these features to directly segment the object in the volumetric 3D scene representation and apply a post-processing step to remove outliers. The extracted 3D object can subsequently be viewed from different directions, as visualized in Fig. 1. We evaluate the proposed method on real world samples from the LLFF , Shiny , and NeRF-real360  data. As shown in Fig. 1, despite very few scribbles on a single reference image, the proposed method recovers an accurate 3D model of the object of interest and retains fine details (e.g., the ribs of the dinosaur in row 1). To study quantitatively, we obtained annotations using a professional service. Our method out-performs 2D and 3D interactive segmentation baselines by a margin on all benchmarks. In summary, we present the first method for user-driven 3D object selection targeting recent neural volumetric reconstruction.\nWe show that a pre-trained network to embed multi-view features produces a more robust selection method than applying existing interactive 3D segmentation methods. For evaluation, we contribute a set of high-quality ground-truth annotations on three real-world datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: (NeRF) —recover a remarkably accurate 3D representation of a scene from a given set of multi-view images.
