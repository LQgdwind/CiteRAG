      "content": "Paper Title: SITTA: Single Image Texture Translation for Data Augmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe Forms are not limited to geometry. For any conceivable thing or property there is a corresponding Form, a perfect example of that thing or property. The list is almost inexhaustible. ‚ÄîPlato ‚ÄúTheory of Forms‚Äù Recent years have witnessed a breakthrough in deep learning based image synthesis such as image translation¬†[ref]9   that manipulates or synthesizes images using neural networks rather than hand-crafted techniques, such as guided filtering¬†[ref]13 or image quilting¬†. However, few of them study the potential use of semantic image synthesis methods as an effective data augmentation tool for recognition tasks. The progress is primarily limited by two bottlenecks: the validity of synthetic data for target labels and the running time. With regard to data validity, many works such as Stylized-ImageNet¬† propose to apply style transfer to the original dataset for pre-training to improve the model‚Äôs robustness, but the synthetic images lack the natural appearance of the original images. Also, since it deconstructs texture and content, it will hurt the recognition performance if trained with the augmented data, and needs to be fine-tuned using only the original dataset to obtain a benefit. Though many approaches¬†[ref]31   have proposed advanced algorithms to translate style and texture, most of them still focus on a subjective evaluation. With regard to running time, current techniques¬†  usually need to train for at least several hours. This seriously hinders its use for data augmentation in real applications. While in the domain of data augmentation, current methods mainly focus on pixel-level or geometric operations such as blur or crop¬†. The potential of augmenting data into different domains, however, is relatively unexplored. In light of this, we propose to explore, design and study an efficient Single Image Texture Translation for data Augmentation (SITTA) in image recognition tasks. It enables texture translation or swapping trained with one-shot texture source input. We believe an ideal image synthesis method for data augmentation should yield visually appealing results, improved recognition performance as well as time efficiency. SITTA is the first of few methods that explore this problem and try to balance all these factors. Our model is lightweight and permits fast training (<< 5 min) and testing (9 ms) on a 288√ó288288288288\\times 288 image using a single Geforce GTX 1080 Ti GPU.\nIn Figure¬†2, we illustrate an example of generated ‚Äòbubble milk‚Äô images by translating the texture of bubble milk to milk images.\nWe visualize the image distribution using t-SNE¬†. We collect 100 natural milk images and 100 natural bubble milk images from the Web, shown on the left.\nOn the right, we can see that the SITTA ‚Äòbubble milk‚Äô images align well with the original bubble milk images, which hints the efficacy of SITTA for semantic data augmentation.\nThe intuition of replacing texture is conceptually similar to the arithmetic properties of word embeddings¬†, e.g., M‚Äãi‚Äãl‚Äãk‚Üí‚àítexture‚Äã(M‚Äãi‚Äãl‚Äãk)‚Üí+texture‚Äã(B‚Äãu‚Äãb‚Äãb‚Äãl‚Äãe‚ÄãM‚Äãi‚Äãl‚Äãk)‚Üí=B‚Äãu‚Äãb‚Äãb‚Äãl‚Äãe‚ÄãM‚Äãi‚Äãl‚Äãk‚Üí‚ÜíùëÄùëñùëôùëò‚ÜítextureùëÄùëñùëôùëò‚Üítextureùêµùë¢ùëèùëèùëôùëíùëÄùëñùëôùëò‚Üíùêµùë¢ùëèùëèùëôùëíùëÄùëñùëôùëò\\overrightarrow{Milk}-\\overrightarrow{\\text{texture}(Milk)}+\\overrightarrow{\\text{texture}(BubbleMilk)}=\\overrightarrow{BubbleMilk}. Our key contributions in this work are as follows. We introduce a new lightweight single image texture translation method for data augmentation (SITTA) that translates textures from a single image to another. We explore the use of SITTA for augmenting data towards the target texture domain. As an example, we translate texture from rare diseased leaves to abundant healthy leaves to augment training data and improve image classification results in the plant pathology challenge dataset¬†. We dig deeper into the use of SITTA for augmenting data and demonstrate its effectiveness in several image recognition tasks (e.g, improving the performance of ResNet-18 by 1.4% for 5-shot classification on CUB-200-2011), which sheds light on the potential direction of image synthesis for data augmentation in the wild.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: of that thing or property.
