      "content": "Paper Title: Intriguing Properties of Vision Transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGeirhos et al. [ref]9 study shape vs. texture hypothesis and propose a training framework to enhance shape-bias in CNNs.\nWe first carry out similar analysis and show that ViT models preform with a shape-bias much stronger than that of a CNN, and comparably to the ability of human visual system in recognizing shapes.\nHowever, this approach results in a significant drop in accuracy on the natural images.\nTo address this issue, we introduce a shape token into the transformer architecture that learns to focus on shapes, thereby modeling both shape and texture related features within the same architecture using a distinct set of tokens.\nAs such, we distill the shape information from a pretrained CNN model with high shape-bias [ref]9.\nOur distillation approach makes a balanced trade-off between high classification accuracy and strong shape-bias compared to the original ViT model. We outline both approaches below.\nNote that the measure introduced in [ref]9 is used to quantify shape-bias within ViT models and compare against their CNN counterparts. Training without Local Texture:\nIn this approach, we first remove local texture cues from the training data by creating a stylized version of ImageNet [ref]9 named SIN.\nWe then train tiny and small DeiT models  on this dataset.\nTypically, ViTs use heavy data augmentations during training .\nHowever, learning with SIN is a difficult task due to less texture details and applying further augmentations on stylized samples distorts shape information and makes the training unstable.\nThus, we train models on SIN without applying any augmentation, label smoothing or mixup. We note that ViTs trained on ImageNet exhibit higher shape-bias in comparison to similar capacity CNN models e.g., DeiT-S (22-Million params) performs better than ResNet50 (23-Million params) (Fig. 7, right plot).\nIn contrast, the SIN trained ViTs consistently perform better than CNNs.\nInterestingly, DeiT-S  reaches human-level performance when trained on a SIN (Fig. 7, left plot). Shape Distillation:\nKnowledge distillation allows to compress large teacher models into smaller student models 0 as the teacher provides guidance to the student through soft labels.\nWe introduce a new shape token and adapt attentive distillation  to distill shape knowledge from a CNN trained on the SIN dataset (ResNet50-SIN [ref]9).\nWe observe that ViT features are dynamic in nature and can be controlled by auxiliary tokens to focus on the desired characteristics.\nThis means that a single ViT model can exhibit both high shape and texture bias at the same time with separate tokens (Table 2).\nWe achieve more balanced performance for classification as well as shape-bias measure when the shape token is introduced (Fig. 8).\nTo demonstrate that these distinct tokens (for classification and shape) indeed model unique features, we compute cosine similarity (averaged over ImageNet val. set) between class and shape tokens of our distilled models, DeiT-T-SIN and DeiT-S-SIN, which turns out to be 0.35 and 0.68, respectively.\nThis is significantly lower than the similarity between class and distillation tokens ; 0.96 and 0.94 for DeiT-T and Deit-S, respectively.\nThis confirms our hypothesis on modeling distinct features with separate tokens within ViTs, a unique capability that cannot be straightforwardly achieved with CNNs.\nFurther, it offers other benefits as we explain next. Shape-biased ViT Offers Automated Object Segmentation: Interestingly, training without local texture or with shape distillation allows a ViT to concentrate on foreground objects in the scene and ignore the background (Table 3, Fig. 10).\nThis offers an automated semantic segmentation for an image although the model is never shown pixel-wise object labels.\nThat is, shape-bias can be used as self-supervision signals for the ViT model to learn distinct shape-related features that help localize the right foreground object. We note that a ViT trained without emphasis on shape does not perform well (Table 3). The above results show that properly trained ViT models offer shape-bias nearly as high as the human’s ability to recognize shapes.\nThis leads us to question if positional encoding is the key that helps ViTs achieve high performance under severe occlusions (as it can potentially allow later layers to recover the missing information with just a few image patches given their spatial ordering).\nThis possibility is examined next.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: Geirhos et al.
