      "content": "Paper Title: Evolving Neural Architecture Using One Shot Model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAutomated Neural Architecture Search is an alternative to the hand-crafted architectures where the\nmachine designs the best suited architecture for a specific problem. Several search methods have\nbeen proposed to explore the space of neural architectures, such as evolutionary algorithm (EA)\n[ref]21[ref]22,\nreinforcement learning (RL) ,\nrandom search and gradient-based methods\n[ref]2.\nThese can be grouped into two groups: gradient-based methods and non-gradient based\nmethods. Gradient Based Methods: In these methods, the neural architecture is directly optimized\nusing the gradient information based on the performance on the validation data. In\n, the discrete architecture search space is\nrelaxed to a continuous search space by using a one shot model and the performance of the\nmodel on the validation data is used for updating the architecture using gradients. This method\nreduces the search time significantly but suffers from the overfitting problem wherein the searched\narchitecture performs very well on the validation data but exhibits poor performance on the test\ndata. This is mainly attributed to the preference of parameter-less operations during the search\nprocess as it leads to a rapid gradient descent [ref]2. Many regularizations\nhave been introduced to tackle the problem such as early stopping ,\nsearch space regularization [ref]2 and architecture refinement\n[ref]2. Contrary to the gradient based methods, the proposed method does not\nsuffer from the overfitting problem because of the stochastic nature introduced by the mutation\noperation. Non-Gradient Based Methods: These methods include reinforcement learning (RL) and evolutionary algorithm (EA). In RL methods, an agent is trained to generate a neural architecture\nthrough its action in order to maximize the expected accuracy on the validation data. In\n, a recurrent neural network (RNN) is used as an agent\nwhich samples neural architectures which are then trained to convergence in order to obtain their\naccuracies on the validation data. These accuracies are then used to update the weights of RNN by\nusing policy gradient methods. Both of these methods suffered from huge computational requirements.\nThis was improved upon in , where all the sampled architectures were forced\nto share weights by using a single directed acyclic graph (DAG) resulting in the reduction of\ncomputational resources. Early approaches based on EA such as\n optimized both the neural architectures and\nthe weights of the network which limited their usage to relatively smaller networks. Then, methods\nsuch as [ref]21 used evolution to search for the\narchitecture and gradient descent for optimizing the weights of each architecture which made it\npossible to search for relatively large networks. However, this resulted in huge computational\nrequirements. To speed up the training of each individual architecture, weight inheritance\nwas introduced in [ref]22 wherein a child network inherits the parent networks’\nweights. In this work, we used both weight inheritance and weight sharing among the architectures\nto speed up the search process.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: the\nmachine designs the best suited architecture for a specific problem. Several search methods have\nbeen proposed to explore the space of neural architectures, such as evolutionary algorithm (EA)\n[ref]21[ref]22,\nreinforcement learning (RL) ,\nrandom search and gradient-based methods\n[ref]2.\nThese can be grouped into two groups: gradient-based methods and non-gradient based\nmethods.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
