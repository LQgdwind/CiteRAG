      "content": "Paper Title: Cycle-Consistent Counterfactuals by Latent Transformations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMNIST and Fashion-MNIST.\nWe evaluate the C3LT method against CF explanation baselines, namely, Contrastive Explanation Method (CEM) [ref]7, Counterfactual Visual Explanation (CVE) [ref]11, and ExplainGAN (ExpGAN) [ref]39 on the MNIST  and Fashion-MNIST  datasets by both qualitative inspection and an extensive set of quantitative metrics. Due to the similarities in CF explanation and adversarial attacks, we also generate adversarial examples on the query images using the PGD attack (denoted as Adv. Attack)  with the CF class as the target. Images from both datasets have 28×28282828\\times 28 resolutions and 10 classes. We use the standard train/test split. The C3LT and [ref]39 use the examples from the query and CF classes in the train set (∼similar-to\\sim6,000 samples/class) for the purpose of training and the examples from the query/CF class in the test set (∼similar-to\\sim1,000 samples/class) for evaluation. While we used official implementations for [ref]7 [ref]11, we could not find any available implementations for [ref]39 and implemented it ourselves. [ref]7 [ref]11 directly evaluate on the test set since they solve optimization problems for individual samples without any training. In addition, given an input 𝒙𝒙{\\bm{x}} from class c𝑐c, [ref]7 [ref]11 do not take user-specified CF class c′superscript𝑐′c^{\\prime} as the target and just aim to change the classifier’s output to the maximum-non-query class arg​maxi≠c⁡f​(𝒙)subscriptargmax𝑖𝑐𝑓𝒙\\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{i\\neq c}f({\\bm{x}}). To have a fair comparison across all baselines, however, we slightly modify their objective and instead select the CF class c′superscript𝑐′c^{\\prime} as the target. Similar to [ref]39, for the MNIST dataset, we use query and CF class pairs (3, 8), (4, 9), and (5, 6). For Fashion-MNIST, we use (coat, shirt), (t-shirt, pullover), and (sneaker, boot). Unlike C3LT and [ref]39, [ref]7 [ref]11 do not guarantee a solution, and we found their optimizations occasionally do not converge hence would not be able to find any CF explanations. For a fair comparison, we only consider the samples that all methods successfully generated CF explanation for. The reported numbers in the following sections are averaged over all samples and pairs for each dataset. Across all methods, we use the same classifier f𝑓f for explaining. The architecture of the classifier used is the same for both datasets where it obtains 99.4%percent99.499.4\\% and 91.5%percent91.591.5\\% test set accuracy on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, respectively. Regarding C3LT, we train an encoder E𝐸E to map the input images to the corresponding code in the latent space of the generator. For the choice of the generator G𝐺G, we used a pre-trained DC-GAN  and PGAN  for MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, respectively. We use similar discriminators as used by DCGAN method. Moreover, we used a simple 2-layer fully-connected neural network with ReLU activation for the choice of transformations g𝑔g and hℎh. ImageNet from BigGAN.\nTo showcase the capability of our framework in generating CFs on high-resolution real-world data, we use C3LT on ImageNet -trained BigGAN, a conditional GAN that generates high-fidelity and high-quality images. To the best of our knowledge, the C3LT is the first CF explanation method to generate CFs that explain classifiers for high-resolution natural images such as ImageNet. This is possible due to the flexibility of our framework and its modular nature. Here, we sample 𝒙xsubscript𝒙𝑥{\\bm{x}}_{x} directly from the latent space distribution 𝒛x∼𝒩​(0,I)similar-tosubscript𝒛𝑥𝒩0𝐼{\\bm{z}}_{x}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,I) with truncation 0.40.40.4 and an encoder E𝐸E is not required. We opt to use pre-trained BigGAN-deep at 256×256256256256\\times 256 resolution. We use the (leopard, tiger), (Egyptian cat, Persian cat), (rooster, hen), (husky, wolf), and (pembroke corgi, cardigan corgi) class pairs. The experiments on BigGAN are limited to C3LT (our method) as baselines are incompetent in generating meaningful CFs and we do not quantitatively compare against them.
