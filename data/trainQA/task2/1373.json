      "content": "Paper Title: Binomial Tails for Community Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAutomated discovery of candidate communities in networks finds a\nvariety of applications in physical and social sciences (biological and\nbiochemical networks, physical and virtual human networks)\n . Given a graph representing binary\nrelations among nodes, informally and intuitively, a community\ncorresponds to a subgraph, i.e. a subset of nodes, with relatively high\nedge density among the community members (nodes of the subgraph), and\ncomparatively lower density of edges going outside the community.\nDefining communities more precisely and what overall community\nstructure may be in various domains, and design of efficient robust\nalgorithms for uncovering such in networks has been the subject of much research\n [ref]3. In our use-case, we are interested in the automated discovery and\neffective presentation of candidate communities comprised of computers\n(hosts) in an enterprise network. In particular this effort is a\ncomponent of a tool that provides a user, such as a security\nadministrator of an organization, visibility into their complex\nnetwork, and importantly helps the user partition the network into\ngroups corresponding to geographic partitions, different departments,\nand hosts running different applications in the organization. This\npartitioning and naming of the groups is a necessary step in defining\nand maintaining network security policies, aka network\nsegmentation: hosts in different groups (segments) can only\ncommunicate on a few well-defined and restricted channels. Such policy\nenforcement severely limits penetration and spread of malware and\nhackers. This step of grouping hosts and assigning meaningful\nnames/labels to the groups, with the human in the loop, is also highly\nuseful in generating insights, for example in uncovering broad\npatterns of communications with applications not just for security but\nalso for network optimization. Given the graph of communications among hosts, we find that while many\nof the candidate groups generated, based on community detection,\ncorrespond well to natural groupings (such as different departments,\nemployee groups, or applications), effective ranking and confidence\nassignment to groups, along with other contextual information, is\ncrucial for the user to make sense of the output, as there are\nnumerous groups of varying quality and size generated.111Along\nwith significant preprocessing of the graph, we use standard\nalgorithms such as Louvain for community detection . \nIn addition to better focusing the attention of the user, effective\nranking and labeling of the groups is critical for improved user\nexperience and bolstering user confidence in the tool. In particular,\nin our application, users are primarily interested in midsize and larger\ngroups, i.e. preferably groups comprising 100s of members (hosts) and\nbeyond. In the published literature, we find that there exist simple efficient\nscores, such as conductance and triangle participation ratio\n, but we observed that these were prone to rank\nwell-separated but rather small groups high. Other techniques such as\nstability analysis can provide more robust results, but suffer from\nseveral drawbacks: the problem of relatively small groups may still\nsurface, the methods can be expensive as they often require multiple\nruns, and they depend on a choice of parameter settings and the\ndiscovery algorithm and/or the graph perturbation specifics, which can\nbe hard to tune and explain to the user. We explored a statistical approach based on binomial modeling, as a\nprincipled approach to incorporating a ’natural bias’ for larger\nsizes, motivated by the intuition that larger groups tend to provide more\nevidence and may therefore attain higher significance. Two of our key findings\ncan be summarized as: The tail of the binomial is a natural fit to the task. There exists an adequate efficient approximation to the tail  . The analyses, of the tail formula and the bounds, together with our\nempirical findings show that original motivation is met well: binomial\nscoring favors larger groups compared to other measures such as\nconductance.\nThe score is equivalent to statistical significance (p𝑝p-values),\nwhich makes it convenient to (color) label the discovered groups (e.g. from ’Very High Significance’ to ’Weak’ and ’No Significance’), and to\nfilter groups when significance is too low. Furthermore, we observe that the scores are not blunt (or too coarse):\nranking using the tail is quite competitive in various synthetic\nsettings, beating other inexpensive methods. It is also competitive on\na variety of real-world graphs we test on, including email graphs,\nco-authorship, document similarity (for text clustering), and so on\n(Section 3). The binomial modeling space is rich, and we\nexplore a few variants and extensions, and discuss several properties\nas well as potential limitations of the approach (such as coverage,\nand significance vs. intensity of the community property). Community\nanalysis is a complex multi criteria task, and we expect that binomial\nmodeling will be a useful complement to existing measures, such as the\nsimpler scores based on raw counts and simple ratios, and those based\non stability and graph perturbation. We emphasize that binomial tail modeling is versatile and we\npresent two related applications in community analysis: 1) to assess\nthe strength of a node’s membership, or node centrality with respect\nto a discovered community  [ref]8, we devise a\nbinomial score, which in turn yields additional methods for\ngroup-scoring, and 2) we develop a binomial score for significance of\nedges (interactions) among communities. In all these cases, we spot a\npattern: a progression from using plain ’degree’, such as a node or\ngroup degree (a simple count), to a ratio (e.g. conductance), to\nbinomial modeling (yields a probability and confidence). Broadly, we\nexpect that the binomial tail is useful in other applications in\ndomains such as information retrieval. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we\ndescribe the binomial score, the efficient approximation to the tail,\nand present an analysis of the growth of the score and the quality of\nthe approximation, and explore variants of the score. We also describe\nand discuss the other scoring techniques we compare against,\nincluding, in addition to conductance, the triangle participation\nratio, and the group-wise component of the Modularity objective (which\nalso favors group size)  . Section\n3 describes the evaluation methodology, and reports on\nour extensive experiments, both in synthetic (planted partition)\nsettings as well as on real-world data. Section 4\npresents related work, and Section 5\nconcludes. Appendices contain further experiments on additional\nsynthetic settings and the different variants of the score, present a modularity\nscore based on number of nodes, and describe the two additional\napplications of binomial tails for network analysis: evidence of\nmembership and significance of edges in the community-induced graph.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: more precisely and what overall community\nstructure may be in various domains, and design of efficient robust\nalgorithms for uncovering such in networks has been the subject of much research\n [ref]3.
