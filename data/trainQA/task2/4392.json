      "content": "Paper Title: DC-BENCH: Dataset Condensation Benchmark\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDataset plays a central role in the performance of machine learning models.\nWith advanced data collection and labeling tools, it becomes easier than ever to construct large scale datasets.\nThe rapidly growing size of contemporary datasets not only posts challenges to data storage and preprocessing, but also makes it increasingly expensive to train machine learning models and design new methods, such as architecture, hyperparameter, and loss function    .\nAs a result, data condensation emerges as a promising direction that aims at compressing the original large scale dataset into a small subset of information-rich examples. In this work, we focus on the newly emerging techniques where the condensed dataset comprises of a set of synthesized samples, learned to matching some statistics to the original dataset or maximizing some utility.\nIn particular,  proposed a dataset distillation algorithm to learn the synthesized dataset via bi-level optimization, showing outstanding performance than existing data selection methods under lower compression ratio222compression ratio = compressed dataset size / full dataset size.\nAfter that, many data condensation methods have been proposed to construct synthesized datasets based on various objectives, such as matching gradients 5 3, embeddings 4, model parameters [ref]4, and kernel ridge regression  .\nIt has been reported that all these data-synthesis methods significantly outperform classical data-selection methods. Despite recent efforts in improving dataset condensation, evaluating and comparing different methods is non-trivial and still remains an open issue to date.\nPrevious works 5 4 3 [ref]4 mainly evaluate condensation methods by training a randomly initialized model on the condensed dataset and report its test accuracy.\nDuring this process, many factors could come into play on the resulting performance, such as data augmentation and architecture.\nThese factors are orthogonal to the condensation algorithms, but might significantly alter their performance.\nHowever, there does not exist a unified evaluation protocol among prior works that aligns them.\nMoreover, the relative performance of condensation methods on real-world downstream applications are also rarely discussed.\nThe lack of a systematic way of evaluation prevents us from establishing fair and thorough comparisons of condensation methods, thereby hinders our understanding of existing algorithms and discourages their practical applications.\n This work aims to provide the first benchmark to systematically evaluate data condensation methods through the lens of the condensed dataset.\nWe start by asking the following question: What attributes should a high-quality condensed dataset possess?\nWe identify three main criteria:\n1). Models trained on the condensed dataset should achieve good performance across different training protocols, such as different data augmentations and architectures.\n2). The condensed dataset should achieve higher performance above naive baseline (random subset of full dataset) across various compression ratios.\n3). The condensed dataset should be able to benefit downstream tasks, such as accelerating Neural Architecture Search (NAS).\nInspired by these criteria, we propose to measure the strength of condensation algorithms from the following four aspects:\n1). Performance under different augmentation\n2). Transferability to different architectures\n3). Performance under different compression ratio\n4). Performance on NAS task.\nThese evaluations constitute the core of our benchmark library. Leveraging the proposed benchmark, we conduct a large-scale comprehensive empirical analysis of state-of-the-art condensation methods.\nThe collection of methods in our library covers four representative dataset condensation methods: Dataset Condensation with Gradient Matching (DC) 5, Differentiable Siamese Augmentation (DSA) 3, Distribution Matching (DM) 5, and Training Trajectory Matching (TM) [ref]4.\nWe further include two data-selection methods in our comparisons: random selection and K-Center - a simple algorithm with strong performance.\nThe experimental results reveal insightful findings on the behavior of condensed dataset, such as: Among all existing methods in our comparison, TM demonstrates better performance on the proposed evaluation protocols, followed by DSA which often performs the second best, showing promising progressions in the field. However, TM is not scalable to larger datasets and compression ratio. Adding data augmentation to the evaluation of condensed dataset alone can significantly boost the performance of all methods. Condensation methods are most effective under extremely low compression ratios. As the ratio increases (e.g., CIFAR-10 with 400 images per class), all condensation methods perform similarly to the random selection baseline. Despite promising results on training a single model, current condensation methods perform poorly on large-scale real-world tasks, such as Neural Architecture Search and training deep networks beyond the pre-specified architecture. All existing methods encounter similar transferability to the simple K-Center baseline on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Using better data-selection methods (e.g., K-Center) as initialization can drastically improve the convergence speed and performance of condensation methods. We hope our work could shed lights on deeper understanding of dataset condensation algorithms, designing more comprehensive evaluation, and stimulating future research in advancing the state-of-the-art methods.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: size.\nAfter that, many data condensation methods have been proposed to construct synthesized datasets based on various objectives, such as matching gradients 5 3, embeddings 4, model parameters [ref]4, and kernel ridge regression  .\nIt has been reported that all these data-synthesis methods significantly outperform classical data-selection methods.
