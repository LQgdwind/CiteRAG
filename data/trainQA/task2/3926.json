Among the literature,\nTraffic flow prediction has become the hottest topic in transportation. Traffic flow owns the characteristics of highly nonlinear time correlation and uncertainty  , which brought huge challenges to traffic flow prediction. The basic assumption is to consider the traffic flow prediction as a time series problem. Among them, the auto-regressive moving average model (ARMA)  as the fundamental time series prediction model has been widely used in traffic flow. The variant methods based on the wavelet neural network  and difference integration  have been proposed. However, these kinds of models lack the necessary modeling of spatial dependence [ref]1. To both consider the spatial and temporal factors, the deep learning model is first proposed 7 by combining the convolutional neural network (CNN) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The time series concepts of the hour, day, and week patterns are further defined [ref]1 and the residual network (ResNet)  is used to process them respectively. A multitask adversarial ST-network is later proposed to infer the\nin-out flows and origin-destination (OD) simultaneously . A deep irregular convolutional residual LSTM\nnetwork is proposed  to model the challenges, such as, hybrid transportation lines, mixed traffic, transfer stations,\nand some extreme weathers.\nMultiple architectures have been designed to improve the performance based on the framework [ref]1, such as using ConvGRU , Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [ref]15, ConvLSTM  instead of CNN.\nAlthough these models achieved good performances, the criticisms are mainly focused on their lack of considering the discrimination of the flow patterns and try to use a single model to monitor them all. In this paper, we model the flow prediction problem from\na new perspective and intend to design a set of experts specialized in different kinds of flow patterns.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: flow. The variant methods based on the wavelet neural network  and difference integration  have been proposed. However, these kinds of models lack the necessary modeling of spatial dependence [ref]1.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
