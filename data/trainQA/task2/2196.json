      "content": "Paper Title: A Max-Min Entropy Framework for Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn Section 6.2, we compared the performance of MME/DE-MME with various recent exploration methods on the considered sparse-rewarded Mujoco tasks. For comparison, we considered two types of exploration methods: action-based exploration that modifies the policy distribution itself to enhance exploration, and state-based exploration that finds rare states for better exploration. We first describe the detailed explanation and implementation for the considered recent exploration methods. For action-based exploration methods, we considered 1) SAC with divergence regularization  (SAC-Div), which adds a single diversity term αdD(π||q)\\alpha_{d}D(\\pi||q) to the SAC objective for some divergence D𝐷D between the policy π𝜋\\pi and the sample action distribution q𝑞q to choose actions away from the actions in the buffer and 2) diversity actor-critic [ref]25 (DAC), which regularizes sample-aware entropy α​ℋ​(β​π+(1−β)​q),β∈(0,1)𝛼ℋ𝛽𝜋1𝛽𝑞𝛽01\\alpha\\mathcal{H}(\\beta\\pi+(1-\\beta)q),~{}\\beta\\in(0,1) instead of the policy entropy α​ℋ​(π)𝛼ℋ𝜋\\alpha\\mathcal{H}(\\pi) of SAC to enhance the policy entropy while the policy chooses actions to avoid the previously sampled actions in the buffer.\nFor SAC-Div, we considered the KL divergence for D𝐷D and the adaptive scaling of αdsubscript𝛼𝑑\\alpha_{d} with scaling parameter δd=0.2subscript𝛿𝑑0.2\\delta_{d}=0.2, as suggested in . For DAC, we used the same α𝛼\\alpha with the SAC baseline, and β=0.5𝛽0.5\\beta=0.5 for SparseMujoco tasks and the adaptive β𝛽\\beta with control hyperparameter cadapt=−2.0​dim​(𝒜)subscript𝑐adapt2.0dim𝒜c_{\\mathrm{adapt}}=-2.0\\mathrm{dim}(\\mathcal{A}) for DelayedMujoco tasks, as suggested in [ref]25. For state-based exploration methods, we considered 1) random network distillation  (RND), which uses the model prediction error ‖f​(st+1)−ft​(st+1)‖2superscriptnorm𝑓subscript𝑠𝑡1subscript𝑓𝑡subscript𝑠𝑡12||f(s_{t+1})-f_{t}(s_{t+1})||^{2} as an intrinsic reward ri​n​t,tsubscript𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑡r_{int,t} to search for rare states, where fssubscript𝑓𝑠f_{s} is a predictor network and ftsubscript𝑓𝑡f_{t} is a randomly fixed target network, and 2) MaxEnt(State) [ref]26 which maximizes the entropy of state mixture distribution ℋ​(dπm​i​x)ℋsuperscript𝑑subscript𝜋𝑚𝑖𝑥\\mathcal{H}(d^{\\pi_{mix}}) for maximizing ℋ​(dπ)ℋsuperscript𝑑𝜋\\mathcal{H}(d^{\\pi}) to visit states uniformly, where dπsuperscript𝑑𝜋d^{\\pi} is the state distribution induced by the policy π𝜋\\pi.\nMaxEnt(State) is 0riginally proposed for pure exploration, but we used the reward of MaxEnt(State) −log⁡(dπm​i​x​(s)+cs)superscript𝑑subscript𝜋𝑚𝑖𝑥𝑠subscript𝑐𝑠-\\log(d^{\\pi_{mix}}(s)+c_{s}) as an intrinsic reward to search for rare states as the RND case for comparison on sparse-rewarded tasks, where cssubscript𝑐𝑠c_{s} is the smoothing constant in [ref]26.\nThen, the reward becomes rt=re​x​t,t+ci​n​t​ri​n​t,tsubscript𝑟𝑡subscript𝑟𝑒𝑥𝑡𝑡subscript𝑐𝑖𝑛𝑡subscript𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑡r_{t}=r_{ext,t}+c_{int}r_{int,t}, where re​x​t,tsubscript𝑟𝑒𝑥𝑡𝑡r_{ext,t} is the external reward from the environment and ci​n​t>0subscript𝑐𝑖𝑛𝑡0c_{int}>0 is the intrinsic reward coefficient. For RND, we used MLP with 2 ReLU hidden layers of size 256256256 and linear output layer of size 202020 for both predictor and target networks, and the intrinsic reward coefficient ci​n​t=5subscript𝑐𝑖𝑛𝑡5c_{int}=5 for sparse-rewarded Ant/HalfCheetah tasks and ci​n​t=10subscript𝑐𝑖𝑛𝑡10c_{int}=10 for sparse-rewarded Hopper/Walker tasks, properly chosen from {1,2,5,10}12510\\{1,2,5,10\\}. For MaxEnt, we computed dπm​i​xsuperscript𝑑subscript𝜋𝑚𝑖𝑥d^{\\pi_{mix}} based on projection/Kernel density estimation with Epanechnikov kernel using 100k previous states stored in the buffer, and used the intrinsic reward coefficient ci​n​t=0.01subscript𝑐𝑖𝑛𝑡0.01c_{int}=0.01 for sparse-rewarded Ant/HalfCheetah tasks and ci​n​t=0.02subscript𝑐𝑖𝑛𝑡0.02c_{int}=0.02 for sparse-rewarded Hopper/Walker tasks, properly chosen from {0.01,0.02,0.05,0.1}0.010.020.050.1\\{0.01,0.02,0.05,0.1\\}. For state-based exploration methods, we used the Gaussian policy with fixed standard deviation σ=0.3𝜎0.3\\sigma=0.3, and the other implementation setup was the same with the SAC baseline to make fair comparison between action-based and state-based exploration methods. Fig. C.1 shows the corresponding average return performance on SparseMujoco tasks and DelayedMujoco tasks. It is seen that proposed MME and DE-MME perform best in most of the considered tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: to the SAC objective for some divergence D𝐷D between the policy π𝜋\\pi and the sample action distribution q𝑞q to choose actions away from the actions in the buffer and 2) diversity actor-critic [ref]25 (DAC), which regularizes sample-aware entropy α​ℋ​(β​π+(1−β)​q),β∈(0,1)𝛼ℋ𝛽𝜋1𝛽𝑞𝛽01\\alpha\\mathcal{H}(\\beta\\pi+(1-\\beta)q),~{}\\beta\\in(0,1) instead of the policy entropy\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
