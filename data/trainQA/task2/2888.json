      "content": "Paper Title: An Unconstrained Convex Formulation of Compliant Contact\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile previous work on convex approximations model rigid contact\n  or use regularization as a means of\nconstraint stabilization , our work is novel in that we\nincorporate physical compliance. This allows us not only to model compliant\npoint contact, but also to incorporate sophisticated models of surfaces patches.\nWe incorporate the pressure field model \nimplemented as part of Drake‚Äôs [ref]24 hydroelastic contact\nmodel. We use the discrete approximation introduced in\n to approximate each face of the contact\nsurface as a compliant contact point at its centroid. To demonstrate this capability, we reproduce the test in\n that models a Soft-bubble gripper\n; a parallel jaw WSG 50 Schunk gripper outfitted\nwith air filled compliant surfaces (Fig. 16). The aforementioned gripper is simulated\nanchored to the world holding a spatula by the handle horizontally. We use\nŒ¥‚Äãt=5√ó10‚àí3‚Äã¬†sùõøùë°5superscript103¬†s\\delta t=5\\times 10^{-3}\\text{ s}. The grasp force is commanded to vary\nbetween 1 N and 16 N with square wave having a 6 second period and a 75% duty\ncycle (see Fig.¬†17, left). This\nresults in a periodic transition from a secure grip to a loose grip allowing the\nspatula to pitch in a controlled manner within grasp (see\nFig.¬†17 and the accompanying video). These contact\nmode transitions are resolved by our model. We observe that stiction during the\nsecure grip is properly resolved with the tight bounds for the slip due to\nregularization discussed in Section V-B.\nWhile this case only has 8 degrees of freedom, it generates about 60 contact\nconstraints during the slip phase and about 160 contact constraints during the\nstiction phase. We compare the performance of SAP against both Gurobi and Geodesic IPM, see\nSection VI-A. For SAP we use a relative tolerance\nŒµr=10‚àí3subscriptùúÄùëüsuperscript103\\varepsilon_{r}=10^{-3}, see Section IV-E. For Gurobi we\nset its tolerance parameter BarQCPConvTol to 10‚àí8superscript10810^{-8}. For Geodesic IPM,\nwe set its complementary slackness tolerance to 10‚àí6superscript10610^{-6}; larger values lead to\nfailure for this task. SAP bounds the momentum error, exhibiting a maximum value\nof of 9.99√ó10‚àí2%9.99percentsuperscript1029.99\\times 10^{-2}\\,\\%. Even with such a tight tolerance, Gurobi\nexhibits 2.6%percent2.62.6\\,\\% maximum error. Geodesic IPM‚Äôs errors are significantly\nsmaller, below 2√ó10‚àí4%2percentsuperscript1042\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\%. However its robustness is very sensitive\nto the specified tolerance. Even though SAP‚Äôs solutions are significantly more accurate than those from\nGurobi, it performs 92 times faster than Gurobi. SAP is 20 times faster than\nGeodesic IPM and significantly more robust to solver tolerances. In terms of\nsolver iterations, SAP only performs 0.62 iterations on average, showcasing how\neffectively it warm-starts. Geodesic IPM performs 5.6 iterations per step on\naverage and Gurobi performs 10.1 iterations on average.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: This allows us not only to model compliant\npoint contact, but also to incorporate sophisticated models of surfaces patches.\nWe incorporate the pressure field model \nimplemented as part of Drake‚Äôs [ref]24 hydroelastic contact\nmodel.
