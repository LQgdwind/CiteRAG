      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Generating Real-World Time Series Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur work falls in the realm of time series data generation. Mogren [ref]11 first proposed the C-RNN-GAN method, using RNNs for both the generator and the discriminator to generate sequential data from random vector sequences. Using a similar architecture, RCGAN [ref]6 was then proposed to generate real-valued, labeled, medical data. However, traditional framework and loss function of GAN are not sufficient for multivariate time series generation because we need to capture not only the multidimensional feature distribution at each time point but also the temporal dependencies. Lin  also identified these key challenges and designed a custom workflow called DoppelGANger. COT-GAN [ref]7 introduced a new adversarial objective based on optimal transport theories. But this method is unable to handle time series with variable lengths. Autoencoders (AE) have also been exploited along with GANs,\nwhich has shown success in computer vision  and natural language processing  . For time series generation, TimeGAN  generates data from a learned embedding space which is optimized by binary adversarial feedback and stepwise supervised loss.\nThe dimension of their embedding space is proportional to the sequence length because it still generates a sequence from a sequence of random vectors.\nBy contrast, we aim to generate a sequence from a latent space whose dimension is invariant of sequence length. In this respect, the proposed method is similar to RNN-based variational autoencoders (VAE)  . However, the assumption that the latent distribution is Gaussian is not always realistic and restricts the generation performance because real-world data may follow a much more complex distribution. Since we aim to generate time series with missing values, this work is also related to missing data analysis.\nChe et al.  first introduced trainable decays to utilize missing patterns by incorporating masking and time intervals into a deep model and achieved better classification results. Efforts were later devoted to forecasting   and imputation    for further exploiting informative missing values. Despite their success, these tasks are different from time series generation. Imputation aims to impute missing values for downstream analysis, and forecasting predicts feature values according to the past observations. Our goal is to generate time series with missing values which is more in line with real data.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: Our work falls in the realm of time series data generation.

Using a similar architecture,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
