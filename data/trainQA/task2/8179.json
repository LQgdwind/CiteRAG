      "content": "Paper Title: A Quantum Unique Games Conjecture\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are many open problems concerning the quantum value of CSPs and the conjectures we have proposed regarding Unique-Label-Cover: Quantizing Classical Reductions:  The works of O‚ÄôDonnell and Yuen¬†, as well as this paper, establish straightforward translations of some of the most well-known classical inapproximability results to the quantum setting. Could this indicate a more general phenomenon? More precisely, can any classical gap-preserving reduction from Label-Cover (or its variants like Unique-Label-Cover or Smooth-Label-Cover) be extended to a reduction for the quantum value? UGC versus qUGC:  What is the relationship between the classical UGC and the quantum UGC? If UGC is proven via a reduction from Label-Cover, can this reduction be ‚Äúquantized‚Äù to prove qUGC? A positive answer to the previous question would also resolve this one affirmatively. Variants of qUGC:  In the classical setting, several formulations of UGC have been shown to be equivalent (see Section 3 in¬† and references therein). Could similar equivalences hold for the quantum variants discussed in this paper? See Section 3.2 for further discussion of these qUGC variants. Noncommutative CSPs:  This work focuses primarily on the quantum value of CSPs. Could variants of qUGC help resolve hardness of approximation questions for the noncommutative value? The noncommutative value, which also plays an important role in quantum information, exhibits some intriguing behavior. As shown in Figure 7, unlike the classical or quantum value, the noncommutative value of MaxCut can be computed in polynomial time. However, it is known that the noncommutative value of Max-333-Cut is undecidable  [ref]16.  provides a 0.8640.8640.864-approximation algorithm for the noncommutative value of Max-333-Cut. We suspect that a variant of qUGC could prove useful in establishing the optimality of this algorithm. Weaker Version of ùêåùêàùêè‚àó=ùêëùêÑsuperscriptùêåùêàùêèùêëùêÑ\\mathbf{MIP^{*}=RE}: Is there a direct way to prove the hardness of approximating the quantum value of Label-Cover without relying on MIP‚àó=REsuperscriptMIPRE\\mathrm{MIP}^{*}=\\mathrm{RE}? One potential approach is to quantize Dinur‚Äôs proof of the classical PCP theorem¬†   [ref]48. The commutation relations in LCqsubscriptLCùëû\\mathrm{LC}_{q} could make this quantization feasible. Could this weaker result also have some of the implications of MIP‚àó=REsuperscriptMIPRE\\mathrm{MIP}^{*}=\\mathrm{RE} such as the resolution of the Connes Embedding Problem? Integrality Gap Instances for MaxCut: What is the smallest ratio between the classical and quantum values across all MaxCut instances? Assuming quantum UGC, we show this ratio is the Goemans-Williamson constant Œ±gw‚âà0.878subscriptùõºgw0.878\\alpha_{\\mathrm{gw}}\\approx 0.878 (Theorem 35). Can we construct an instance attaining this ratio? Label-Cover for QMA:  Approximating the classical value of Label-Cover is NPNP\\mathrm{NP}-complete (PCP theorem). Similarly, approximating the noncommutative and quantum values of Label-Cover is RERE\\mathrm{RE}-complete (MIP‚àó=REsuperscriptMIPRE\\mathrm{MIP}^{*}=\\mathrm{RE} theorem). What version of Label-Cover or Unique-Label-Cover naturally captures QMAQMA\\mathrm{QMA}? Could further constraints on the variations of Label-Cover and Unique-Label-Cover explored in this paper lead to suitable candidates? A positive resolution to this problem would answer the Quantum Games PCP Conjecture¬†. Hardness of Approximation in Hamiltonian Complexity:  In quantum information theory, quantum MaxCut often refers to the anti-ferromagnetic Heisenberg model, a special case of the local Hamiltonian problem. Although¬† attempts to prove UGC hardness for the anti-ferromagnetic Heisenberg model, reductions from UGC only establish NPNP\\mathrm{NP}-hardness. Could variations of qUGC yield stronger results? While the inapproximability of the anti-ferromagnetic Heisenberg model is one of our motivations for proposing the quantum UGC, our current methods do not yet apply to the inapproximability of local Hamiltonian problems. Gadget Reductions:  In classical complexity theory, gadgets¬†  are widely used to demonstrate hardness of approximation. Can this method be ‚Äúquantized‚Äù?¬†  are examples of gadget reductions in the quantum setting.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: 7, unlike the classical or quantum value, the noncommutative value of MaxCut can be computed in polynomial time.
