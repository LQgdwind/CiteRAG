      "content": "Paper Title: StyleLipSync: Style-based Personalized Lip-sync Video Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nReconstruction Results. We compare the other state-of-the-art methods in the lip-sync (Wav2Lip [ref]28) and talking face generation (ATVG [ref]5, MakeItTalk , and PC-AVS [ref]45) on reconstruction results of Voxceleb2 test dataset. Table 1 shows that StyleLipSync outperforms all metrics except the LSE-C score. Wav2Lip [ref]28 achieves the highest LSE-C score, however, it achieves low image quality metrics since it generates 96×96969696\\times 96 low-resolution videos. PC-AVS [ref]45 achieves comparable lip-sync scores with StyleLipSync, however, achieves low image quality metrics than our model since it highly relies on its specific pre-processing and fails to generate in many cases. We also illustrate the qualitative results in Figure 5(a). Wav2Lip [ref]28 produces a lip-synchronized video with considerable visual artifacts since it cannot adapt to the video of dynamic head pose. MakeItTalk  generates low lip-sync video since it uses sparse facial landmarks. PC-AVS [ref]45 generates an accurate lip-synchronized video following the input head pose. However, it struggles to preserve the unseen identity involving visual artifacts. StyleLipSync generates the natural lip motion with high fidelity and preserves the input identity, which is comparable to the ground truth video. Cross Identity Results. To evaluate lip-sync generalization, we conduct cross-id experiments settings using unseen videos and audio. We randomly sample 10 videos of different identities and 150 audio without duplication from HDTF . We use the first 10 seconds of videos and audio. For each video, we generate 15 lip-synced videos from 15 different audios, where those face-audio pairs are not from the same source. In Table 2, we report the LSE-D and LSE-C for lip-sync quality and the CSIM for face similarity. Wav2Lip [ref]28 achieves a higher LSE-C score than StyleLipSync, however, it achieves a low CSIM score since it produces a low-resolution video with visual artifacts. MakeItTalk  achieves the best CSIM score, while the lip-sync quality is the worst since it uses sparse facial landmarks. PC-AVS [ref]45 outperforms LSE-C while achieving the lowest CSIM since it can’t preserve an unseen face’s identity. StyleLipSync achieves the best LSE-D score and comparable CSIM score to MakeItTalk . We show qualitative results of cross-id experiments with target lip references in Figure 5(b). PC-AVS [ref]45 can generate accurate lip-synchronizing video compared to the target lip, while it fails to preserve facial details of the unseen face. MakeItTalk  produces a high-resolution and identity-preserving video, however, it is out-of-sync compared to the target. StyleLipSync generates a high-resolution lip synchronizing video compared to the target lip, without any visual artifacts.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: Reconstruction Results.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
