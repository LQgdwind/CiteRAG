Garbuz is funded by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement No. 101077862).\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCompetition complexity.\nSince the work of Bulow and Klemperer [ref]8 that introduced the competition complexity measure focusing on the single-item case, it has been extended through several dimensions of complexity.\nEden et al.  and Beyhaghi and Weinberg  studied the multi-item setting under additive valuations over independent items, and analyzed the additional amount of bidders necessary for the VCG mechanism to achieve at least the same revenue as the optimal (prior-dependent, computationally unbounded) mechanism as a function of the number of items, and the number of agents. Eden et al.  devised a lower bound of log⁡(m)𝑚\\log(m) and an upper bound of n+2​m−2𝑛2𝑚2n+2m-2 where n𝑛n is the number of bidders in the original instance, and m𝑚m is the number of items. Beyhaghi and Weinberg  improved the upper bound to min⁡{n​(ln⁡(1+m/n)+2),9​n​m}𝑛1𝑚𝑛29𝑛𝑚\\min\\{n(\\ln(1+\\nicefrac{{m}}{{n}})+2),9\\sqrt{nm}\\}.\nDerakhshan et al.  settled the competition complexity for the case where the number of items is smaller than the number of bidders, proving that the competition complexity is Θ​(n​m)Θ𝑛𝑚\\Theta(\\sqrt{nm}).\nFeldman et al.  initiated the study of combining the competition complexity measure with approximation algorithms, showing that near-optimal revenue can be achieved with simple mechanisms (either selling separately, or selling all items as a single bundle) for several settings with a logarithmic or constant multiplicative factor of additional bidders.\nCai and Saxena  improved the result of Feldman et al.  showing that an O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) additional number of bidders is always suffice for obtaining a near-optimal revenue for additive valuations over independent items. Fu et al.  demonstrated that for obtaining a constant approximation of the optimal revenue, it is suffice to add only a single bidder from one of the distributions of the original instance and apply the VCG mechanism. Liu and Psomas 7 studied the competition complexity in dynamic settings, finding that at most 3​n3𝑛3n additional bidders are required to achieve revenue comparable to the optimal dynamic auction. For two-sided markets, Babaioff et al.  developed a budget-balanced, truthful, and prior-independent mechanism that approximates the optimal welfare by adding additional buyers under stochastic dominance assumptions. Lastly, for the competition complexity of the prophet inequality framework, beyond the works of Brustle et al.   that were mentioned earlier, Ezra and Garbuz  extended this framework to instances with correlations between rewards in the block and adversarial arrival models, where different copies of rewards are independent. Prophet secretary.\nThe prophet secretary problem has been studied extensively since the work of Esfandiari et al.  that initiated it. Correa et al.  developed a (1−1/e)11𝑒(1-\\nicefrac{{1}}{{e}})-competitive algorithm using personalized thresholds in a non-adaptive mechanism.\nEhsani et al.  showed that the approximation of 1−1/e11𝑒1-\\nicefrac{{1}}{{e}} can be achieved with a single-threshold, and also considered the multi-choice case under matroid feasibility constraints, and combinatorial auctions for which they provide the same guarantee of 1−1/e11𝑒1-\\nicefrac{{1}}{{e}}.\nAzar et al.  were the first to surpass the 1−1/e11𝑒1-\\nicefrac{{1}}{{e}} barrier with a refined case analysis, developing three time-based threshold algorithms, where the best of the three algorithms achieves a competitive-ratio of 0.63460.63460.6346.\nCorrea et al. 3 introduced the sub-class of time-based threshold algorithms which they termed blind algorithms, that use a non-increasing sequence of thresholds based on the distribution of the maximum, and used this class to devise a 0.6690.6690.669-competitive algorithm. Harb 5 improved the competitive-ratio to 0.67240.67240.6724 using a blind algorithm. Recently, Chen et al.  introduced the class of activation-based algorithms and used it to obtain a 0.6880.6880.688-competitive algorithm surpassing the 0.6750.6750.675 upper bound for the class of blind algorithms shown by Correa et al. 3. In terms of upper bounds, Bubna and Chiplunkar  showed a separation of the competitive-ratios achievable for the prophet secretary problem, and the free-order prophet inequality (where the decision-maker can choose the order of arrival). The best known upper bound on the competitive-ratio for the prophet secretary problem is 0.72350.72350.7235 4. Beyond the single-choice case, Arnosti and Ma \nfocused on settings where the algorithm (and the prophet) are allowed to select at most k𝑘k rewards, and provided a tight constant guarantee for the class of single-threshold algorithms of γk≈1−12​π​ksubscript𝛾𝑘112𝜋𝑘\\gamma_{k}\\approx 1-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi k}}.\nLee and Singla 6 introduced random order contention resolution schemes (RCRS) which is a type of rounding schemes for online algorithms in random arrival models. They used this type of algorithms to provide a (1−1/e)11𝑒(1-\\nicefrac{{1}}{{e}})-approximation algorithm for the prophet secretary problem under matroid feasibility constraints.\nFu et al. 3 developed a 815815\\frac{8}{15}-approximation algorithm for the prophet secretary problem for random vertex arrival through the RCRS approach, which was improved by\nMacRury et al. 8 to a 0.5350.5350.535-approximation for general graphs, and to a tight 0.5670.5670.567-approximation for bipartite graphs. Beyond competitive analysis (when comparing to the prophet), Dütting et al. 6 developed a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) that approximate the optimal online algorithm (that is not bounded computationally).\nLastly, Cristi and Ziliotto 4 considered the sample complexity of the prophet inequality framework. They showed that a constant number of samples per distribution suffices to achieve near optimal competitive-ratios for different variants of the prophet inequality problem, including prophet secretary.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: Competition complexity.\nSince the work of Bulow and Klemperer [ref]8 that introduced the competition complexity measure focusing on the single-item case, it has been extended through several dimensions of complexity.\nEden et al.  and Beyhaghi and Weinberg\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
