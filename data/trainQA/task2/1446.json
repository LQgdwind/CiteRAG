      "content": "Paper Title: Dynamic Preference Logic meets Iterated Belief Change: Representation Results and Postulates Characterization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo our knowledge, the work of Segerberg  is the first to propose the integration of belief revision operations within an epistemic logic, with his proposal of Dynamic Doxastic Logic (DDL). This integration is important because it allows one to analyse the effects of introspection, and other related phenomena, in the logic of belief change. A famous example of such interaction is the analysis of Moore sentences in the logic of belief change, which shows that AGM’s postulates are incompatible in the face of introspection . In this work, Segerberg provides a set of axioms , which corresponds to encodings within his logic of AGM’s postulates for belief change. Our work is linked to that approach by investigating these correspondences for dynamic belief change, based on iterated belief change postulates, instead of AGM belief change, as pursued by Segerberg. In the context of DDL, Cantwell  defines some iterated belief revision operators as change operations in hypertheories  and he shows how these operations can be axiomatically characterised in DDL. Our work differs from his in that we analyse how some well known-postulates can be characterised in our logic and not how to encode specific constructions. Our logic also has the advantage of being more expressive because it can encode some notion of degrees of belief , which cannot be expressed in DDL. Another trend of research on using modal logics to study (and axiomatise) iterated belief change operators or policies is the work on Dynamic Epistemic Logics. Inspired by Rott , Van Benthem  proposed the codification of some iterated belief revision operators within a Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL). This work was further extended by Girard , Liu , and Souza et al.  who studied the use of DPL to encode several (relational) belief revision policies. Similarly, Baltag and Smets  used a logic similar to DPL to encode different notions for knowledge and belief, based on Board’s work . These authors show how different iterated belief revision operators can be simulated using DEL action models and product update. Further,\nGirard and Rott  propose a DPL for studying belief revision.\nThe authors encode several iterated belief revision policies using General Dynamic Dynamic Logic \nand show that reduction axioms can be obtained for them in the same fashion as . In the related literature, all these works following the DEL tradition define operations semantically in their logic and either provide axiomatisations by means of crafting the axioms or by encoding these operations using a variation of dynamic logic to obtain reduction axioms. These works are informed by well-known results in the area of belief change to choose appropriate operations and then encode these operations in their logics. On the other hand, our work investigates how DPL can be used to characterise properties of dynamic belief change operators, instead of applying the characterisation in Belief Change theory to construct a logic. To our knowledge, our work is the first to do so for dynamic belief change operators. While other work, such as that of Darwiche and Pearl’s  and of Jin and Thielscher  and others, have investigated semantic characterisation of iterated belief change postulates, these characterisations have been pursued in an extra-logical framework, i.e., outside of the object language used to the specify the agent’s beliefs. As discussed before, these move to specifying belief change has important consequences on the expressiveness of the theory. Our work is also connected to that of Souza et al. [ref]46 [ref]47 that uses the connection between preference models and Liu’s priority graphs  to belief change postulates as structural properties on transformations in priority graphs. However, These authors show that transformations on priority graphs are a limited representation for changes of dynamic operators and some of the well-known postulates of the area cannot be encoded using them. How our generalisations can be connected to that work is still an open topic of research. It seems doubtful that we can establish significant connections between our axiomatic characterisations and the structural constraints imposed by postulates in the realisation of dynamic operators as transformations in priority graphs. As far as we know, the only work that investigates the encoding of postulates from Belief Change as axioms of a logic is the work of Segerberg   on DDL. In , the author axiomatizes the logic DDL and proves the completeness of the logic in regards to an SOS-based semantics, showing thus that their axioms are accurate representations of AGM’s postulates within their logic. While Segerberg’s work is very similar to ours in intent, the authors do not consider iterated belief change postulates and their representation in the logic - the main focus of our work. Notice that, while DDL could, in principle, be used as a foundation for our study, this logic is less expressive than DPL. Also, by choosing to employ DPL instead of DDL as a foundational logic, our work can be connected to the work representing different mental attitudes in this logic 4  [ref]20 allowing the application of theoretically founded dynamic operators to dynamic phenomena for different mental attitudes.\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: the agent’s beliefs.
