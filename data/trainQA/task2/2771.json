      "content": "Paper Title: Offline Reinforcement Learning with Reverse Model-based Imagination\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOffline RL. In the literature, offline RL methods can be primarily divided into model-free and model-based algorithms. Prior model-free offline RL methods constrain their policy search in the offline dataset. They can realize their bias by either estimating uncertainty quantification to the value function   [ref]10 , using importance sampling based algorithms       , explicitly constraining the learning policy to be close to the dataset  , learning the conservative value function , and using KL divergence    or MMD [ref]10. On the other hand, prior model-based offline RL methods [ref]12  [ref]14        have studied in model-uncertainty quantification [ref]12  , representation learning [ref]14, constraining the policy to imitate the behavioral policy , and using conservative estimation of value function . Different from these works, we propose ROMI to investigate a new direction in the model-based offline RL, which will provide natural conservatism bias with maintaining superior model-based generalization benefits. Reverse model-based RL. The idea of learning a reverse dynamics model to imagine reversal samples from goal states first emerges in the literature of online RL algorithms     , and shows the potential of speeding up learning and improving sample efficiency by aimed exploration. Similar backward model shows benefit in planning for credit assignment   and robustness . Lai et al. (2020)  utilizes a backward model to reduce the reliance on accuracy in forward model predictions. In contrast to the backward model in online RL, we show that reverse imagination inherently incorporates the conservatism into rollout trajectories in the offline RL, which can lead rollouts towards target states in dataset. To our best knowledge, ROMI is the first offline RL method with reverse model-based imagination to induce conservatism bias with data augmentation.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: Prior model-free offline RL methods constrain their policy search in the offline dataset.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
