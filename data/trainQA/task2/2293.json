      "content": "Paper Title: Abstract\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDuring the 1st half of the last century, G. K. Zipf carried out a vast investigation of statistical regularities of languages   , that lead to the formulation of linguistic laws . Among them, a subset has received very little attention:\nlaws that relate the frequency of a word with its number of meanings in two ways. On the one hand, the law of meaning distribution, that relates the frequency rank of a word with its number of meanings (the most frequent word has rank 1, the 2nd most frequent word has rank 2,…). On the other hand, the meaning-frequency law, that relates the frequency of words to their number of meanings. Both Zipfian laws of meaning indicate the more frequent words tend to have more meanings and their mathematical definition takes the form of a power law   . The relationship between the number of meanings of a word, μ𝜇\\mu, and word frequency, f𝑓f, Zipf’s meaning-frequency law, follows approximately where δ≈1/2𝛿12\\delta\\approx 1/2   .\nThe law of meaning distribution that relates the meanings μ𝜇\\mu of a word with its frequency rank i𝑖i as where γ≈1/2𝛾12\\gamma\\approx 1/2  . Interestingly, G. K. Zipf never investigated the meaning-frequency law empirically but deduced it from the law of meaning distribution   and the popular rank-frequency law, relating f𝑓f (the frequency of a word) with i𝑖i (its frequency rank) approximately as  [ref]11 Zipf deduced Eq. 1 with δ=1/2𝛿12\\delta=1/2 from α=1𝛼1\\alpha=1 (for Zipf’s rank-frequency law), and γ=1/2𝛾12\\gamma=1/2 (for the law of meaning distribution)  . Recently, it has been shown that the three exponents of the power laws are related by   It should be noted that a weak version of Zipf’s meaning-frequency law simply indicates that there is a positive correlation between word frequency (f𝑓f) and the number of meanings (μ𝜇\\mu) what has been connected with a family of Zipfian optimization models of communication .\nTo date, experimental evidence has been accumulating for Zipf’s law of meaning distribution, either fitting a power law function or computing the correlation between word frequency and meaning  [ref]13   . Thus, there is new empirical evidence for the weak version of Zipf’s law\nof meaning distribution on eight languages from\ndifferent language families (Indo-European,\nJaponic, Sino-Tibetan and Austronesian), also retrieving exponents of Zipf’s law of meaning distribution (γ𝛾\\gamma) between 0.210.210.21 and 0.510.510.51 depending on the language (see [ref]13 for details).\nThe results of Bond et al (2019) [ref]13 are consistent with previous works that they review and that have verified the correlation between the frequency of words and their meanings   even in child language and language-directed speech  . In fact, Bond et al (2019) already noted the influence of both binning size and Zipf’s law deviations on the predictive power of the Zipfian laws for the meaning although without considering Eq. 4.\nEq. 4 actually involves assuming the validity of Zipf’s rank-frequency law, which has previously been seen not always happen, either due to the appearance of more than one regime in the distribution of words    or because the data fits better with other mathematical functions  0 1. This work is the first empirical study of Zipf’s laws of meaning in Catalan and also the first one that considers two sources of different modality for word frequency: an speech corpus and a written one. Our study consists of investigating the exponents of Zipf’s meaning-frequency law (Eq. 1) and meaning distribution (Eq. 2) and then to test the validity of the relationship between the exponents (Eq. 4) previously proposed  . As far as we know this is the first time that the three Zipfian laws have been analyzed together empirically in one language: Catalan.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: law empirically but deduced it from the law of meaning distribution   and the popular rank-frequency law, relating f𝑓f (the frequency of a word) with i𝑖i (its frequency rank) approximately as  [ref]11 Zipf deduced Eq. 1 with δ=1/2𝛿12\\delta=1/2 from α=1𝛼1\\alpha=1 (for Zipf’s rank-frequency law), and γ=1/2𝛾12\\gamma=1/2 (for the law of meaning distribution)  .
