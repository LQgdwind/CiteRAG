      "content": "Paper Title: Video action recognition for lane-change classification and prediction of surrounding vehicles\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOne of the closest and most plausible scenarios in the adoption of the autonomous vehicles is autonomous navigation at SAE L3 (chauffeur) or L4 (autopilot) on highways, both for passenger and freight transport. This is mainly due to the maturity of one of the first driver assistance technologies: Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems. They were introduced in the early 1990s and are present in a wide range of passenger vehicles today . ACC systems focus on maintaining a desired speed selected by the driver or maintaining the distance between the car in front and the ego car. Newer versions introduced Stop & Go functionality. But the steering wheel must be controlled manually (L1). The next step in automation were the Traffic Jam Assist (TJA) and the Traffic Jam Chauffeur (TJC) that combines the ACC Stop & Go and Lane Keeping Assist functions to control the steering wheel, speed, acceleration and braking of the vehicle in traffic jams up to speeds typically below 60 km/h. TJA is usually considered as L2 and TJC as L3 . Finally, the most advanced automation systems to date are the Highway Chauffeur (HC) and the Highway Autopilot (HA), which includes the management of complex maneuvers such as deciding to change lanes to overtake, enter a slower lane or even exit the highway. HC is mostly considered as L3 and HA as L4. In all previous systems, from the simple ACC to the most sophisticated HA, the most critical, and challenging, highway scenarios are the cut-in and cut-out ones, specially for high speeds. In the cut-in scenario, a car from one of the adjacent lanes merges into the lane just in front of the ego car. In the cut-out scenario, a car in front leaves the lane abruptly to avoid a slower vehicle, or even stopped, ahead. Since 2018, the performance of these assistance or chauffeur commercial systems operating under these two critical traffic scenarios is being tested by Euro NCAP . Although there are abnormal behaviors that can also lead to critical situations on highways, and that are of interest to driving automation systems, such as sudden stops, abnormal trajectories or collisions, the amount of data available is still very limited to develop, validate and certify potential approaches. An alert driver will typically anticipate cut-in and cut-out maneuvers, even over long distances, using only visual cues, reduce speed accordingly, or even change lanes through the use of the steering wheel. An automated system must also be able to anticipate these situations at an early stage. To do so, it is necessary to endow new automated systems with the ability of predicting the motions of surrounding vehicles, such as lane-keeping and lane-change, and thus improving driving performance significantly in terms of safety, comfort, and even environmental sustainability , . The first Lane Departure Warning (L0) or Lane Change/Lane Keeping Assist systems (L1) were designed to detect, or even predict, lane departure of the ego vehicle by combining visual cues (lane markings and lane texture) and vehicle-state information (CAN bus) . Although there is some ambiguity in the available literature, ego-vehicle lane change detection systems differ considerably from surrounding vehicle lane change detection systems. The requirements for sensors are very different, as are the applicable methodologies. For example, the pixel resolution available to detect the position of vehicles relative to their lane is much lower. Solutions require vehicle detection and tracking. Relative distance and speed measurements require radar or LiDAR type range sensors, and yet, uncertainty of the measurements is much more relevant. Vehicle-state information (e.g., accelerations), can only be accurately obtained via V2V communications [ref]7. To deal with lane-change prediction of surrounding vehicles, in this paper we pose the problem as an action recognition problem using visual information from cameras. The idea behind our proposal is to use the same source of information (visual cues) and the same type of approach (action recognition) that drivers use to anticipate these maneuvers. By using a spatio-temporal model based on image sequences (i.e., continuous visual cues) our approach implicitly includes positional, contextual, and symbolic information, such as turn or brake indicators. Although there are some drivers who do not use them (i.e., a system based solely on their detection would not be effective), in general they are a very valuable source of visual information. Significant progress has been made in video-based human action recognition and prediction during the last years . Action recognition and prediction involves managing spatial and temporal information (sequence of images). Among the different methodologies, we focus our efforts in the following two-stream-based approaches (see Figure 1): Two-Stream Convolutional Networks [ref]9: a classical architecture that contains a spatial network and a temporal network (two streams), which are used for modeling static information in still frames and motion information in optical flow images, respectively. Two-Stream Inflated 3D Convolutional Networks (I3D) 0: an extension of the classical two-stream architecture which expand filters and pooling kernels into 3D, leading to very deep, naturally spatiotemporal classifiers. Spatiotemporal Multiplier Networks 1: a two-stream architecture that combines appearance and motion pathways and allows interaction between them by injecting cross-stream residual connections. SlowFast Networks 2: a two-stream architecture involving a slow pathway that operates at low frame rate to capture spatial semantics and a fast pathway that operates at high frame rate to capture motion at fine temporal resolution. Although there are other works focused on learning spatiotemporal features for video activity recognition, the selected approaches are a good example of the evolution of the two-stream-based systems, including the first successful proposal [ref]9 and the one ranked first 2 in the AVA Challenge 2019 3.\nBeyond our previous preliminary work 4, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first proposal using video action recognition approaches to deal with lane-change recognition and prediction of surrounding vehicles for automated vehicles. To validate these approaches in this context, we make use of The PREVENTION dataset 5 which provides a large number of accurate and detailed annotations of vehicles categories, trajectories and events (including left/right lane changes, among others). More than 356 minutes, 4M vehicle detections and 3K trajectories are available, with data collected from LIDAR, radar and camera sensors, from surrounding vehicles up to a range of 80 meters. Contours and bounding boxes are available as raw output detections, as well as a temporary integration of the detections. The aforementioned architectures are adapted to deal with lane change action recognition and prediction. An extensive evaluation is performed in this paper. The amount of context information needed to model the interactions between different vehicles and other features implicitly included in the appearance, such as the number of lanes or the road curvature, is studied using different sizes for the regions of interest. The ability of the networks to perform action recognition and prediction is assessed using different time horizons and training strategies. The obtained results clearly validate the use of these type of approaches to solve the lane-change prediction problem of surrounding vehicles. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the related work is presented, whereas Section III is an overview of the problem formulation. In Section IV the implementation of the action recognition approaches is described. In Section V the evaluation metrics, and the performance of the different approaches are assessed. The final conclusions and future work are given in Section VI.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: or LiDAR type range sensors, and yet, uncertainty of the measurements is much more relevant.
