      "content": "Paper Title: Relational Data Synthesis using Generative Adversarial Networks: A Design Space Exploration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe provide a categorization of design solutions for each component in our framework, as summarized in Figure 3. Data transformation.\nWe examine how to encode categorical attributes to numerical values, and normalize numerical attributes to appropriate ranges that fit neural networks. We consider widely-used encoding schemes for categorical attributes, i.e., ordinal or one-hot encoding, and normalization schemes for numerical attributes, i.e., simple normalization or normalization using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). We will take exploration of more sophisticated transformation schemes as a future work.\nMoreover, as different neural networks have different requirements for the input, sample 𝒕𝒕\\bm{t} can be in the form of either matrix or vector. More details of data transformation are in Section 4. Neural networks.\nExisting works for relational data synthesis consider three representative neural networks.\n(1) Inspired by the success of image synthesis, some apply DCGAN , and use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for G𝐺G and D𝐷D, in which G𝐺G is a deconvolution process and D𝐷D is a convolution process  .\n(2) Following the original GAN , some studies   use multilayer perceptron (MLP) consisting of multiple fully-connected layers.\n(3) Some approaches utilize a sequence generation mechanism that generates attributes separately in sequential time-steps , and use recurrent neural networks, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) networks  for G𝐺G.\nNote that different neural networks have different forms of input: CNN takes matrix-formed samples, while MLP and LSTM uses vector-formed samples. This paper focuses on comparing the aforementioned representative neural networks under the same framework. We will take an exploration of more sophisticated models, such as Bidirectional LSTM , as a future work. More details can be referred to Section 5.1. Training algorithm.\nMinibatch-based stochastic gradient descent (SGD) strategy is applied for GAN training.\nThis paper focuses on investigating mode collapse  [ref]42, a well-recognized challenge in GAN training.\nTo this end, we evaluate different training algorithms with various loss functions and variants of SGD optimizer, such as 𝙰𝚍𝚊𝚖𝙰𝚍𝚊𝚖{\\tt Adam} and 𝚁𝙼𝚂𝙿𝚛𝚘𝚙𝚁𝙼𝚂𝙿𝚛𝚘𝚙{\\tt RMSProp}. This paper investigates two alternatives to train GAN: (1) the vanilla training algorithm  with an improved loss function and (2) Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) training .\nSee Section 5.2 for more details of these algorithms. Conditional GAN.\nThe imbalanced label distribution in real-world data may result in insufficient training for records with minority labels . Thus, some studies  apply conditional GAN  to data synthesis. We examine the adoption of conditional GAN that encodes a label as a condition vector 𝒄𝒄\\bm{c} to guide G𝐺G (D𝐷D) to generate (discriminate) samples with the label. We evaluate the performance of GAN with/without label as a condition. Moreover, we also investigate different sampling strategies (i.e., Sampler in Figure 2): random sampling as commonly used in GAN training, and label-aware sampling that gives fair opportunity for samples with different labels. See Section 5.3 for more details. Differential privacy.\nWe consider differential privacy [ref]23, a well-adopted formalization of data privacy, to evaluate whether GAN can still be effective to preserve data utility while providing provable privacy protection.\nIntuitively, although G𝐺G does not access the real data 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} (only D𝐷D accesses 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} via Sampler), G𝐺G may still implicitly disclose privacy information as the gradients for optimizing G𝐺G is computed based on D𝐷D. Thus, we adopt the DPGAN model  in the GAN training process, as elaborated in Section 5.4.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: details can be referred to Section 5.1.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
