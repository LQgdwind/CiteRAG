Surprisingly, large language models (LLMs) trained on sufficient data exhibit ICL, even though they are trained only with the objective of next token prediction  [ref]2. A good deal of the ongoing excitement surrounding LLMs arises from this unexpected capacity, since it dramatically enlarges their set of potential applications. Attempts to understand this capability are ongoing and take a variety of forms, including higher-level normative accounts using Bayesian inference , and mechanistic explanations involving implicit gradient descent  or induction heads . Despite this, the mechanisms that underlie ICL in LLMs remain somewhat mysterious. In this paper, we take an alternative approach. We reveal the conditions that drive ICL in a different sequence learning model called a clone-structured causal graph (CSCG) [ref]6 [ref]7. Using a combination of new and standard datasets, we show how a CSCG assigns non-zero probabilities to sequences never seen during training in a way that, thanks to the model’s causal graph structure, is open to explicit and mechanistic interpretation. We hypothesize that similar mechanisms will exist in transformer-based LLMs, and show how this could be the case. Specifically, we show that ICL in CSCGs can be explained as a combination of (a) learning template circuits for pattern completion, (b) retrieving relevant templates in a context-sensitive manner, and (c) rebinding of novel tokens to appropriate slots in templates . Unlike n-gram models, CSCGs allow transitive generalization in the latent space, which assigns non-zero probabilities to sequences never seen during training in a semantically sensible way, ensuring that the contexts (prompts) used for retrieval are not pure memorizations. In addition, the binding of novel tokens to slots in learned templates allows the same structural knowledge to be applied to entirely novel inputs. By elucidating the principles that underpin the mechanics of ICL, we hope to pave the way for the design of novel architectures for abstraction and generalization, while the building blocks we identify guide the search for mechanistically interpretable  and editable 0 circuits in transformers 1.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: (the prompt) at inference time.
