The SAGE values are defined as We refer to the interventional and observational SAGE values, if fintsuperscript𝑓intf^{\\text{int}} and fobssuperscript𝑓obsf^{\\text{obs}} are used for f𝑓f in ν𝜈\\nu, respectively. Due to the exponential complexity of the Shapley value, the SAGE estimator uses a Monte-Carlo approximation 1 based on the representation where 𝔖Dsubscript𝔖𝐷\\mathfrak{S}_{D} is the set of permutations over D𝐷D and ui+​(π)superscriptsubscript𝑢𝑖𝜋u_{i}^{+}(\\pi) and ui−​(π)superscriptsubscript𝑢𝑖𝜋u_{i}^{-}(\\pi) refer to the set of indices preceding feature i𝑖i in π𝜋\\pi, in- and exclusively i𝑖i.\nPlugging in the definition of ν𝜈\\nu and using Monte-Carlo estimation, the SAGE estimator is constructed. Given data points (xn,yn)n=1,…,Nsubscriptsubscript𝑥𝑛subscript𝑦𝑛𝑛1…𝑁(x_{n},y_{n})_{n=1,\\dots,N} and permutations (π)n=1,…,N∼unif​(𝔖D)similar-tosubscript𝜋𝑛1…𝑁unifsubscript𝔖𝐷(\\pi)_{n=1,\\dots,N}\\sim\\text{unif}(\\mathfrak{S}_{D}) the SAGE estimator is defined as with f^​(x,∅):=1N​∑n=1Nf​(xn)assign^𝑓𝑥1𝑁superscriptsubscript𝑛1𝑁𝑓subscript𝑥𝑛\\hat{f}(x,\\emptyset):=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n=1}^{N}f(x_{n}) and f^​(x,S):=1M​∑m=1Mf​(x(S),x~m(S¯))assign^𝑓𝑥𝑆1𝑀superscriptsubscript𝑚1𝑀𝑓superscript𝑥𝑆superscriptsubscript~𝑥𝑚¯𝑆\\hat{f}(x,S):=\\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{m=1}^{M}f(x^{(S)},\\tilde{x}_{m}^{(\\bar{S})}) for ∅≠S⊂D𝑆𝐷\\emptyset\\neq S\\subset D with x~msubscript~𝑥𝑚\\tilde{x}_{m} sampled uniformly from x1,…,xNsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑁x_{1},\\dots,x_{N}. The mean prediction f^​(x,∅)^𝑓𝑥\\hat{f}(x,\\emptyset) thereby differs to ensure that the SAGE values sum to the improvement in loss.\nFor each permutation πnsubscript𝜋𝑛\\pi_{n} and observation (xn,yn)subscript𝑥𝑛subscript𝑦𝑛(x_{n},y_{n}), the SAGE estimator can be efficiently computed by iterating through the permutation and evaluating ν𝜈\\nu on the preceding elements 1 4.\nThe permutation sampling approach ensures that the efficiency condition of the Shapley value is maintained and thus the SAGE estimates sum approximately to ν​(D)𝜈𝐷\\nu(D).\nIn contrast to other global FI measures, where interpretation of the scores are unintuitive, SAGE yields a meaningful axiomatic interpretation.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: S, x(S¯)superscript𝑥¯𝑆x^{(\\bar{S})}.\nTo randomize the features in S¯¯𝑆\\bar{S}, we introduce the notation f​(x,S)𝑓𝑥𝑆f(x,S) with a set S⊂D𝑆𝐷S\\subset D and the observational approach [ref]39 4 and the interventional approach   The essential difference between the two approaches is that fintsuperscript𝑓intf^{\\text{int}} breaks the dependence between the features in S𝑆S and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
