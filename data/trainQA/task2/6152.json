      "content": "Paper Title: DNN-Defender: An in-DRAM Deep Neural Network Defense Mechanism for Adversarial Weight Attack\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare the DNN-Defender’s hardware overhead with the latest RH mitigation mechanisms in the literature in Table III. From a hardware utilization perspective, these efforts can be classified into three groups:\n1) frameworks that utilize CAM, SRAM, or both along with one counter;\n2) frameworks that rely exclusively on DRAM resources and employ many counters; and\n3) frameworks that rely on DRAM and SRAM resources and employ swap operations.\nFor this experiment, our strategy is to consider the same 32GB: 16-bank of DDR4 DRAM for all frameworks and normalize the capacity overhead and area overhead across different frameworks. In Table III,\ni) the involved memory indicates the type of memory used by the framework for RH protection. As discussed, certain frameworks rely on a counter to monitor intrusions and store tracking information in the system using CAM/SRAM. Nonetheless, because of the considerably higher cost of CAM and SRAM in comparison to DRAM, selecting a framework with such supplementary resources may be controversial. For example, Table III shows that only Graphene  and TWiCE  occupy two fast storage resources simultaneously.\nAt the same time, Hydra , SRS , and RRS  rely on SRAM in addition to DRAM.\nii) Capacity overhead refers to the memory resources utilized by RH in a framework. Such resources are dedicated solely to RH and not for other purposes. Take Graphene  as an example, it requires storing counting tables in SRAM (1.12 MB), and the space occupied by these tables can no longer be used as a shared storage space to store data. Graphene also requires 0.53 MB CAM to track vulnerable rows. Take SHADOW [ref]36 as an example, 0.16 MB capacity of DRAM is dedicated to enabling RH mitigation.\nOur framework stands out from others as it does not utilize any additional memory resources for RH mitigation. Unlike Graphene , TWiCE , SRS , and RRS , DNN-Defender does not require any fast-read memory. Furthermore, in contrast to SHADOW [ref]36 and P-PIM [ref]47, DNN-Defender does not even sacrifice DRAM resources, where all rows can be used for storing data in the same way as ordinary rows. iii) Some frameworks not only require storage device resources but also additional components for RH mitigation. We listed the additional hardware components required by various frameworks in the area overhead column. We can find that DNN-Defender offers one of the most area-efficient solutions compared to other frameworks. Among DRAM-only frameworks, the best counter-based approach , that optimizes the number of counters per row to reduce both DRAM usage and the total count significantly, still imposes over 1000 counters. Besides, SHADOW [ref]36 and P-PIM [ref]47 require modifying the DRAM circuitry, where they indicate 0.6% and 0.34% overheads. Our framework only requires ∼similar-to\\sim0.02% area to support the new ISA and controller with the RNG unit.
