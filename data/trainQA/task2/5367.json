Criteria The problem of allocating roles in a homogeneous robotic team has been thoroughly investigated in the literature.\nCombinatorial optimization methods, such as Constraint Programming and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)  , can scale up problems of different sizes easily and account for different schedule dependencies, such as temporal constraints and limited resources. However, a solution to the MATA problem for large-scale industrial tasks in mixed human-robot teams remains NP-hard with exponential complexity .\nExamples of such formulation, which take inspiration from real-time processor scheduling techniques   , aim to minimize the overall task completion time.\nNevertheless, in human-populated environments, optimally assigning tasks using only task duration as a metric is not sufficient, and often it is necessary to deviate from the original plan. For these reasons, other indicators have been proposed to dynamically modify the plan. For instance, human preferences can be included and updated during task execution .\nIn , a two-level feedforward optimization is introduced. In the first offline phase, all the possible feasible allocations are computed. Then, in the online phase, the task is rescheduled according to the trust measurement between the agents.\nSimilarly, Li et al.  solve the role allocation problem of a disassembly task through a genetic metaheuristic algorithm that searches for the optimal or near-optimal solution in the feasible solution space by minimizing the total disassembly time. Again, an online strategy is employed to switch team members according to human fatigue. In both cases, the experimental results highlight the importance of allocation algorithms to be able to re-plan according to online measured features during task execution. However, the computation time of such algorithms remains reasonably low only for small-sized problems. To speed up the search and simplify the problem size, researchers began to employ different task models that could decompose the task into subtasks of smaller size.\nIn [ref]18 the task is represented by a directed acyclic graph. The graph models the dependency relationship between subtasks by connecting subtasks in a layered structure. Some of them could be independent of each other, so no path goes from one subtask to the next. The graph is then rearranged so that all parallel tasks are grouped into several sets (levels). The allocation is solved through a MILP that considers the levels in his formulation.\nAnother extensively used method to model industrial assembly (and disassembly) tasks is represented by AND/OR graphs. They allow a compact representation of complex assembly tasks and a complete graph search to generate feasible assembly sequences. Recently, AND/OR graphs were extended to the multi-agent scenario in human-robot collaborative processes   [ref]28 . For instance, by including different costs in the AND/OR graph hyperarcs, it is possible to represent the execution by different agents, including also agents characteristics . The optimal assembly/agent sequence can be obtained offline  or online  through best-first search algorithms such as AO*. To reduce the search complexity, Darvish et al.  introduced a hierarchy of assemblies that are pre-computed offline and integrated with the first-order logic task description. Nevertheless, AND/OR graphs cannot efficiently model the subassembly’s temporal constraints, such as parallelism. All assemblies are planned only in sequential order. Therefore, to achieve simultaneous executions, a dedicated task scheduler is required.\nOther well-known graph-based task models are represented by Petri Nets  , Hierarchical Task Networks  , Hierarchical Finite State Machines  , and Behavior Trees[ref]33. In  a generalized stochastic Petri Net models all the possible actions required during the assembly task in single-human, multi-robot assembly cells. Casalino et al. , instead, capitalizes on a partially controllable time Petri Net to model the unpredictability of human actions in human-robot collaboration. Behavior Trees (BTs) instead represent a planning method capable of modeling complex behaviors of autonomous agents. Due to their characteristics in terms of abstraction, modularity, and usability , they have been used in industrial settings to create and monitor task plans for industrial robots [ref]33. Despite the high potential of the formalism, in its current state, it does not provide the flexibility to adapt to human behavioral variability. Similarly to AND/OR graphs, Hierarchical Task Networks and Hierarchical Finite State Machines are planning methods based on action decomposition. In  the Hierarchical Task Network models a structured cooperative task and reacts to unexpected events and behaviors. In addition, allocation methods based on decision-making processes have the advantage of being able to integrate multiple criteria and quickly obtain the desired allocation. For these reasons, such methods are particularly suitable in the context of dynamic role allocation with re-planning capability. Similar approaches are presented in  , where the task is represented through a Hierarchical Finite State Machine, while the allocation is done through a decision-making process that considers agent features such as availability, capability, workload, and performance. The re-scheduling capability of the latter is presented in , where the multi-criteria decision-making framework computes offline task allocation and online reschedules when unexpected events occur. Ergonomic aspects are introduced by El Makrini et al. . While these methods assume that the team is composed only of a single human and a single robot in synchronized processes, in  tasks can be assigned to both agents at the same time, allowing proper collaborative roles to be assigned. Yet, the generalization of such methods to a team of arbitrary size is nontrivial.\nA schematic comparison of the literature review is available in Table I222N/D in the table entries stands for no data..\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: only for small-sized problems.
