      "content": "Paper Title: Information Design in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn parallel to the setting at hand, mechanism design222In the literature, the term mechanism design sometimes refers to a border definition that includes direct influence methods (e.g. providing tangible goods and information), and indirect methods (e.g. building reputations systems and infrastructure systems). addresses situations in which agents possess distinct and private preferences   .\nThe crux of this approach entails devising regulations that incentivize agents to candidly disclose their preferences in their own self-interest, culminating in a collectively optimal outcome.\nThe community has extensively investigated the analytical paradigm of mechanism design.\nHowever, this paradigm is constrained by several factors such as linear agent cost and planner incentive functions , finite single-stage games [ref]34, and state-based potential games .\nConsequently, these simplifications restrict its applicability in nonlinear, temporally-extended environments . To overcome these limitations, recent works adopt the agent-based simulation  and utilize SOTA agent learning methods such as MARL for mechanism design.\nWhile this approach sacrifices analytical tractability, it offers greater flexibility and applicability in complex environments .\nAs a method of mechanism design, providing rewards has been applied to MARL.\nFor example, LIO allows the RL agents to send rewards directly to others, which can be used to solve first-order social dilemmas (e.g. iterated prisoner’s dilemma and tragedy of the commons) and improve social welfare 7 .\nThe other perspective of influencing by rewards is taxation.\nBy adopting RL, the AI economist improves utilitarian social welfare in one-step co-adaptive learning scenarios . Besides, to elicit the desired social choice (the aggregation of the preferences of all the agents), the method of mechanism design is not necessarily to be providing rewards, but also more general mechanisms, such as distribution rules of public goods.\nFor applications,  proposed a method that designs mechanisms by RL for voting. Their designed mechanisms successfully won the majority vote at the human level in a public goods social dilemma. Information design has recently been extended to sequential scenarios .\nTo model the coupling decision processes of the sender and the receiver, Markov persuasion processes (MPPs) are proposed in , and Although both works name their models as MPPs, they are different models.\nIn , the sender’s informational advantage is separated from the states and has no impact on the state transitions. In 6, a new myopic receiver interacts with the sender every timestep. Both are different from our model..\n proved that persuading a far-sighted receiver in MPPs is NP-hard, and 6 proposed a learning method for persuading a bunch of one-shot myopic receivers in MPPs.\nOn the other hand,  proposed a learning method for a sender to persuade a far-sighted receiver without knowing the prior belief.\nBesides,  proposed a variant of obedience constraints for persuading multiple receivers in sequential interactions.\nThe studies above have provided a solid theoretical foundation.\nHowever, all current discussions on this topic still rely on the commitment assumption and the revelation principle and need more algorithms that work in practical scenarios. Compared to applying mechanism design to reinforcement learning, applying information design approaches to reinforcement learning presents a more challenging task.\nThis is because the signals directly influence the agents’ interactions, not only in their update phase but also in the generation of trajectory data.\nIn contrast, the reward in mechanism design only affects the agent’s update phase since it is solely used during updates.\nTherefore, the existing mechanism design in MARL methods cannot be directly applied to the case of information design, and alternative analyses are required. Reference games are usually cooperative tasks (e.g. Lewis signaling games ). The core of these tasks is how the sender efficiently conveys its information to the receiver, enabling the receiver to take a specific action desired by both the sender and receiver. The crucial aspect lies in how the sender conveys information to enable the receiver to understand the intended semantics. Therefore, the sender aims to transmit as much of its available information as possible.\nWhile information design focuses on mixed-motive communication tasks. The receiver’s action will determine the payoffs for both parties, but there may not be a specific action that is desired by both. In fact, the self-interested sender’s goal is not to maximize the transmission of its known information, but to leverage its informational advantage to confuse the self-interested receiver, so as to maximize its own payoffs. The sender aims to persuade the receiver to take actions that are advantageous to the sender. In fact, senders typically learn deceptive strategies. Another domain closely related to our work is emergent communication    5. A close connection is found in , as they mention a negotiation environment which is indeed a mixed-motive task.\nThe communication protocol we study employs the linguistic channel they mentioned, satisfying two primary characteristics: (1) Non-bindingness: Messages conveyed through this channel don’t bind the sender to any action or state, given the sender’s empty action space, rendering the communication as purely cheap talk; (2) Unverifiability: The absence of an intrinsic connection between the linguistic expression and the actual state of affairs implies a potential for deceit by the sender.\nContrary to their methodology where self-interested agents fall short in achieving favorable outcomes via a linguistic channel, our approach facilitates good performance in Markov signaling games.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: the analytical paradigm of mechanism design.\nHowever, this paradigm is constrained by several factors such as linear agent cost and planner incentive functions , finite single-stage games [ref]34, and state-based potential games .\nConsequently, these simplifications restrict its applicability in nonlinear, temporally-extended environments .
