      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Codebook Design for Network Beam Management\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we define the hierarchical beam training operation for a multi-cell scenario. Although beam training is standardized in 5G, we explicitly define each step of the beam-based operations because the multi-cell beam management process is integrated into the gradient updates of the learning algorithm in Section IV. We consider a region that is served by C=3𝐶3C=3 base stations (BS) or cells with overlapping coverage regions. Exterior cells are not simulated in this investigation, although extending the model and algorithm to include more BSs is straightforward. Each BS is equipped with a planar array of size NTRF=2​NXRF×NYRFsubscriptsuperscript𝑁RFT2subscriptsuperscript𝑁RFXsubscriptsuperscript𝑁RFYN^{\\text{RF}}_{\\text{T}}=2N^{\\text{RF}}_{\\text{X}}\\times N^{\\text{RF}}_{\\text{Y}} with 2 horizontal elements of perpendicular polarization being colocated in the array. The antenna elements are connected in a fully connected hybrid format with bphasesubscript𝑏phaseb_{\\text{phase}} bit phase shifters connecting to the 2​NX×NY2subscript𝑁Xsubscript𝑁Y2N_{\\text{X}}\\times N_{\\text{Y}} digital ports . We assume there are U𝑈U UEs in the scene where U𝑈U is a random variable that is not known to the network. Each UE is equipped with an NRsubscript𝑁RN_{\\text{R}} element fully digital uniform linear array enabling elevation beamforming. We assume a multi-cell MU-MIMO OFDM channels between each antenna pair as The specific channel model is not critical as underlying distributions of the channel are learned from channel samples. For a realized channel, we can define a received signal model for a user u𝑢u at time-frequency resource t,k𝑡𝑘t,k with receiver combiner 𝐖u,t,k∗subscriptsuperscript𝐖𝑢𝑡𝑘{\\mathbf{W}^{*}_{u\\color[rgb]{0,0,0},t,k}} and hybrid precoders 𝐅c,t,ksubscript𝐅𝑐𝑡𝑘\\mathbf{F}_{c,t,k}, 𝐅c,tRFsubscriptsuperscript𝐅RF𝑐𝑡\\mathbf{F}^{\\text{RF}}_{c,t}. We will assume timing and frequency synchronization can be performed using standardized reference signals. We also assume all users can be associated with a BS so that the U users can be partitioned U=∑cUc𝑈subscript𝑐subscript𝑈𝑐U=\\sum_{c}U_{c} for ease of notation, although the user assignment may not be known prior to initial access or shared between cells. We define the received signals as The noise 𝐍u,t,ksubscript𝐍𝑢𝑡𝑘{\\mathbf{N}_{u\\color[rgb]{0,0,0},t,k}} is modeled as independent Gaussian random values and accounts for thermal noise and hardware noise figures. Note that 𝐃u,t,ksubscript𝐃𝑢𝑡𝑘{\\mathbf{D}_{u\\color[rgb]{0,0,0},t,k}} contains the desired signal for a given user and the inter-cell interference from streams of data for other users, while the intra-cell interference is given by (3). The digital precoders 𝐅c,t,k∈ℂNT×NRsubscript𝐅𝑐𝑡𝑘superscriptℂsubscript𝑁Tsubscript𝑁R\\mathbf{F}_{c,t,k}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{N_{\\text{T}}\\times N_{\\text{R}}} are block diagonal where a subset of the digital array is used to serve and mitigate interference for each user u∈Uc𝑢subscript𝑈𝑐u\\in U_{c} [ref]7. The analog precoders 𝐅c,tRF∈ℂNTRF×NTsubscriptsuperscript𝐅RF𝑐𝑡superscriptℂsubscriptsuperscript𝑁RFTsubscript𝑁T\\mathbf{F}^{\\text{RF}}_{c,t}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{N^{\\text{RF}}_{\\text{T}}\\times N_{\\text{T}}} are a matrix of frequency-flat beamformers used to direct the data streams. The task of determining analog and digital precorders that maximize the network-wide spectral efficiency (SE) is challenging in the face of limited CSI and coordination. Beam management is one strategy that involves multiple stages of beam training and feedback to obtain CSI and configure the precoders. In particular, the beam training stages are used to obtain coarse and refined beamformers that make up the analog beamforming, while user feedback is used to configure the digital precoding [ref]6 [ref]7. The focus of our work here is on optimizing network performance by dynamically generating new beamforming codebooks. For the duration of our paper, we assume a working knowledge of the beam management stages and will only briefly highlight the key equations. Readers are encouraged to review   [ref]6 [ref]7 for an in-depth review of these processes in 5G. Given the focus on beam management for 6G , we will assume the same three phases (SSB, CSI-RS, and feedback) as in 5G. We also assume UEs operate similarly to sub-6GHz 5G implementations, although such assumptions are just a simplification to focus on the BS operation. Much of the beam training and hybrid operations are not specified in the standards, so we will assume a formulation similar to classical hybrid implementations found in literature i.e.  1 2 and following the unified hybrid beam management system model from our prior work [ref]7. One important difference is the multi-cell formulation, where we will assume the nearby cells operate over the same bands and perform beam training on the same time-frequency resources. This assumption is a worst-case scenario as nearby base stations could employ different bands for SSB and CSI-RS to mitigate multi-cell interference.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: N_{\\text{R}}} are block diagonal where a subset of the digital array is used to serve and mitigate interference for each user u∈Uc𝑢subscript𝑈𝑐u\\in U_{c} [ref]7.
