      "content": "Paper Title: A Sparse Multicover Bifiltration of Linear Size\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis paper aims to approximate the multicover bifiltration of a finite subset\nX𝑋X of ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}. The k𝑘k-cover Covr,ksubscriptCov𝑟𝑘\\textrm{Cov}_{r,k} for a scale r≥0𝑟0r\\geq 0 is\ngiven by all those points covered by at least k𝑘k balls of radius r𝑟r around the\npoints of X𝑋X: For any r≤r′𝑟superscript𝑟′r\\leq r^{\\prime} and k≥k′𝑘superscript𝑘′k\\geq k^{\\prime}, we have that\nCovr,k⊂Covr′,k′subscriptCov𝑟𝑘subscriptCovsuperscript𝑟′superscript𝑘′\\textrm{Cov}_{r,k}\\subset\\textrm{Cov}_{r^{\\prime},k^{\\prime}} and as such the Covr,ksubscriptCov𝑟𝑘\\textrm{Cov}_{r,k} assemble into a\nbifiltration known as the multicover bifiltration,\nsee Fig. 1. The multicover bifiltration offers a view into the\ntopology of the point cloud X𝑋X across multiple scales, in a way that is robust\nto outliers, which can be made\nprecise [ref]6. However, computing the multicover bifiltration remains a challenge. Current\nexact combinatorial (simplicial or polyhedral)\nmethods  \nare expensive, of size O​(|X|d+1)𝑂superscript𝑋𝑑1O(\\lvert X\\rvert^{d+1}), and previous approximate methods,\nalthough linear on |X|𝑋\\lvert X\\rvert, have an exponential dependency on\nk𝑘k . For general metric spaces, instead of subsets of ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}, an analogue of the\nmulticover is the subdivision Rips\nbifiltration . It has also received\nattention recently, both in its\ntheoretical [ref]6 and computational\naspects [ref]37  .\nStill, its computation faces similar challenges as the multicover. Previous\napproximation schemes are at least polynomial in\nsize [ref]39 [ref]6 [ref]37  ,\nsee the related work below. In this paper, we define a simplicial bifiltration, the sparse subdivision\nbifiltration (Definition 4.2), that\n(1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-approximates the multicover and that is of linear size\nO​(|X|)𝑂𝑋O(\\lvert X\\rvert), independently of k𝑘k and for fixed ε𝜀\\varepsilon and d𝑑d. It can be\ncomputed in time O​(|X|​log⁡Δ)𝑂𝑋ΔO(\\lvert X\\rvert\\log\\Delta), where ΔΔ\\Delta is the spread of\nX𝑋X, the ratio between the longest and shortest distances between points in X𝑋X.\nIn addition, the methods extend to obtain analogous results for the subdivision\nRips bifiltration for metric spaces of bounded doubling\ndimension (Section 8). The sparse subdivision bifiltration is (homotopy) equivalent to the sparse\nmulticover bifiltration SCov (Definition 3.5), a\nbifiltration of subsets of ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d}. It is via SCov that the sparse\nsubdivision bifiltration (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-approximates the multicover, by which we\nmean that as in Theorem 3.7. In other words, the sparse subdivision\nbifiltration and the multicover are (multiplicatively)\n(1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon)-homotopy-interleaved . Instead of balls of radius r𝑟r, the sparse multicover bifiltration is based on\nsparse balls (Definition 3.1), understood as balls with a\nlifetime of three phases: on the first phase they grow normally (at scale r𝑟r\nthey have radius r𝑟r), and then they are slowed down (they keep growing but at\nscale r𝑟r they have radius less than r𝑟r), before eventually disappearing. We\nguarantee that when a sparse ball disappears it is approximately covered by\nanother present sparse ball, and we keep track of which present sparse balls\ncovers which disappeared sparse ball via a covering\nmap (Definition 3.3). A sparse ball “counts as” as many sparse\nballs it approximately covers according to the covering map—the sparse\nk𝑘k-cover SCovr,ksubscriptSCov𝑟𝑘\\textrm{SCov}_{r,k} consists of those points covered by sparse balls that\nat least “count as” k𝑘k balls.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: bifiltration,\nsee Fig. 1.
