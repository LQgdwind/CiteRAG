      "content": "Paper Title: DOMINO: Visual Causal Reasoning with Time-Dependent Phenomena\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe began by conducting a comprehensive literature review on causality theories, especially logic-based causality, and their applications. Based on this study, we identified 4 high-level analytical tasks and a 4-phase practical workflow to guide the development of our interactive visual interface. T1. Generating causal propositions and hypotheses is often the first step in causality analysis. Most current works on temporal causality achieve this either by manually grouping relevant values and then assigning them semantic meanings   , or by conducting an exhaustive search after evenly partitioning the time series data into a large amount of sections each considered an event  . Both of these approaches are limited in efficiency and flexibility. Since in logic-based causality a causal relation is defined over a time lagged conditional distribution , analysts should be given direct access to such information by allowing them to generate causal propositions and hypotheses with visual support. Also, since an effect can have multiple causes, an overview of the values and boolean labels of each time series in a synchronized fashion will help the understanding of the compound relations. T2. Identifying significant causes under a specified time delay is the most common task when investigating causality within time series. Examples are found in temporal causal analysis of the stock market , biomedical data [ref]17  , social activities , and terrorist activities . While the significance threshold determining the truthfulness of causes may often need to be decided empirically, a visual system should effectively externalize the identified causes and their levels of significance under the specified time delay, supporting the analyst’s decision-making process. T3. Analyzing the change of causal influences over time is another important task as the significance and influence of a cause toward the effect could differ over settings of time delay. Interactive operations can reveal the time span of a causal relation, as well as a proper window of time delay for identifying other causes. The latter, however, has been mostly assigned empirically with a limited set of values in the related work so far  [ref]17 . When this knowledge is incomplete, a visual system should support analysts in these tasks by visualizing the causal influences toward the effect associated with all possible time delays under consideration. T4. Interactive analysis. As mentioned, causality analysis is often associated with a number of meta parameters to be determined by analysts empirically, e.g., the numerical constraints in the causal propositions and the threshold in the significance tests. Determining these parameters is an essential task in causality analysis and often requires interaction, as illustrated in other projects 0  . To support interactive analysis, an effective system should provide visual feedback along with each of the user’s parameter updates. Users should also be able to save the discoveries in an overview for later re-examination. To guide the design of a dedicated visual system that can support temporal causality analysis as an interactive process of generating and testing causal hypotheses under time windows, we devised an analytical workflow comprising the following four phases (see Fig. 3): P1. Causal hypothesis generation is the first step of the pipeline where a user specifies the target effect and then locates its hypothetical causes (T1). This can be done either in an interactive approach (T4) or with auto estimation algorithms (e.g., Algorithm 1). Either way, the window of time delay is adjustable (T3). P2. Testing the hypothesis under its statistical significance is the next step after identifying a set of potential causes (T2). Besides measuring the inferred causal relations under different thresholds (T4), users will also visually examine the time sequences looking for direct evidences under different settings of delay (T3). P3. Iterative analysis is an often required step where a user shifts between adjusting the time delay to evaluate the change of impact of current causes on the effect (T3), and adjusting the causes regarding their constraints looking for alternatives under the current setting (T2). P4. Overview and memorization is typically the final step where a user saves his/her discoveries for later access or integrates them into an evolving causal network (T4).\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: causes under a specified time delay is the most common task when investigating causality within time series.
