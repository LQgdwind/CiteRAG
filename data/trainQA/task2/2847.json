      "content": "Paper Title: Planning from Pixels in Environments with Combinatorially Hard Search Spaces\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe purpose of the experimental section is to empirically verify the following claims: (i) PPGS is able to solve challenging environments with an underlying combinatorial structure and (ii) PPGS is able to generalize to unseen variations of the environments, even when trained on few levels. We aim to demonstrate that forming complex plans in these simple-looking environments is beyond the reach of the best suited state-of-the-art methods. Our approach, on the other hand, achieves non-trivial performance. With this in mind, we did not insist on perfect fairness of all comparisons, as the different methods have different type of access to the data and the environment. However, the largest disadvantage is arguably given to our own method. While visual goals could be drawn from a distribution p‚Äã(g)ùëùùëîp(g), we evaluate a single goal for each test level matching the environment solution (or the only state that would give a positive reward in a sparse reinforcement working framework).\nThis represents a very challenging task with respect to common visual goal achievement benchmarks [ref]34, while also allowing comparisons with reward-based approaches such as PPO [ref]39.\nWe mainly evaluate the success rate, which is computed as the proportion of solved levels in a set of 100 unseen levels.\nA level is considered to be solved when the agent achieves the visual goal (or receives a non-zero reward) within 256 steps. Our method learns to achieve visual goals by planning with a world model learned on a distribution of levels. To the best of our knowledge, no other method in the literature shares these exact settings.\nFor this reason, we select three diverse and strong baselines and we make our best efforts for a fair comparison within our computational limits. PPO [ref]39 is a strong and scalable policy optimization method that has been applied in procedurally generated environments [ref]13.\nWhile PPGS requires a visual goal to be given, PPO relies on a (sparse) reward signal specializing on a unique goal per level.\nDreamerV2  is a model-based RL approach that also relies on a reward signal, while GLAMOR [ref]34 is more aligned with PPGS as it is also designed to reach visual goals in absence of a reward. While we restrict PPGS to only access an offline dataset of low-quality random trajectories, all baselines are allowed to collect data on policy for a much larger number of environment steps.\nMore considerations on these baselines and on the fairness of our comparison can be found in Suppl.¬†B.\nFurthermore, we also consider a non-learning naive search algorithm (GS on Images) thoroughly described in C.3. A comprehensive ablation study of PPGS can be found in Section A of the Appendix.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: (or the only state that would give a positive reward in a sparse reinforcement working framework).\nThis represents a very challenging task with respect to common visual goal achievement benchmarks [ref]34, while also allowing comparisons with reward-based approaches such as PPO [ref]39.\nWe mainly evaluate the success rate, which is computed as the proportion of solved levels in a set of 100\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
