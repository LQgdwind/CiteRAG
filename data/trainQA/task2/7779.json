      "content": "Paper Title: Solvable Initial Value Problems Ruled by Discontinuous Ordinary Differential Equations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe have explored the characteristics of initial value problems (IVPs) involving discontinuous ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that have a unique solution. Through our research, we‚Äôve delineated a particular class of these systems, which we have termed solvable. For such systems, the solution can always be obtained analytically through a transfinite recursion process, with a countable number of steps. We have presented various instances of these systems and described a methodology for constructing increasingly complex examples. We have shown that even basic configurations of these solvable systems, such as a simple set of discontinuity points, can produce noncomputable values and address the halting problem. Our approach bears similarities to Denjoy‚Äôs method for tackling the challenge of antidifferentiation, and in consideration of the results and methodologies discussed in studies like  and , we believe we have laid the groundwork for a more detailed analysis of these systems. This could potentially lead to establishing a classification and hierarchy within this robust class of solvable systems. More precisely:\nthe integrability rank that inspired the modus operandi of our ranking is the Denjoy rank. Now: An analysis has been done for the Denjoy rank: an unpublished theorem from Ajtai, whose proof is included in , demonstrates that once a code for a derivative fùëìf is given as a computable sequence of computable functions converging pointwise to fùëìf, then the antiderivative FùêπF of fùëìf is Œ†11superscriptsubscriptŒ†11\\Pi_{1}^{1} relative to fùëìf. This fact has direct implications related to the hierarchy of hyperarithmetical reals (also called Œî11superscriptsubscriptŒî11\\Delta_{1}^{1} reals) expressed formally by a Theorem from , which proves that the hyperarithmetical reals are exactly those reals xùë•x such that x=‚à´01fùë•superscriptsubscript01ùëìx=\\int_{0}^{1}f for some derivative fùëìf of which we know the code of. An alternative computability theoretic analysis of Denjoy‚Äôs rank has been done in , relating levels of the hierarchy to levels of the arithmetical hierarchy in some precise manner, using a slightly alternative setting, on the way objects are encoded. We posit that applying a similar analytical approach to the framework of solvable systems could lead to refined statements regarding the ranking and ordinals involved, tailored to specific classes of functions or dynamics. This analytical perspective, in conjunction with research detailed in papers like  and [ref]6, which explore the simulation of discrete computational models through analog models based on ODE systems, suggests the potential of solvable IVPs as an analog framework for simulating transfinite computations or offering an alternative method for presenting such computations. Moreover, our discussions have highlighted categories of ordinary differential equations that exhibit complexities not commonly covered in traditional texts on ODEs, along with numerous existing counterexamples in the literature. In line with arguments from , our findings indicate that the complete set of countable ordinals is essential in any constructive process for solving ODEs in general. Furthermore, for each countable ordinal, we can construct a solvable ODE with corresponding complexity. This underscores the depth and novelty our research contributes to the field of differential equations.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: statements regarding the ranking and ordinals involved, tailored to specific classes of functions or dynamics.
