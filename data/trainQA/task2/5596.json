      "content": "Paper Title: Can We Use Diffusion Probabilistic Models for 3D Motion Prediction?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEstimating how a human would move in the near future is an essential task for various applications such as surveillance  , autonomous driving  , and human-robot/computer-interaction .\nMany approaches have been proposed to solve this problem, often based on the motion capture datasets such as Human3.6M  or SMPL [ref]7-based datasets such as AMASS .\nIn this paper, we concern with a task whose goal is to predict a sequence of 3D pose skeletons in Human3.6M and HumanEva-I  datasets, when a previously observed 3D pose sequence is given as an input. Existing works on 3D skeleton motion prediction can be categorized as follows.\nOne line of research focuses on models for deterministic motion prediction 0 1 2 3 4 5.\nThese works aim at predicting a single motion that is most likely to be observed in the future.\nTherefore, their performance is usually evaluated based on an L‚Äã2ùêø2L2-distance between a prediction and a ground truth.\nAnother line of research focuses on generative models for stochastic motion prediction 6 7 8 9.\nTheir performance is evaluated based on the metrics for likelihood and diversity.\nAfter generating a fixed number of prediction samples from a single observation,\nthe likelihood is measured based on the minimum distance between the prediction samples and ground truth, and the diversity is measured based on the average distance between all pairs of prediction samples. However, we cannot judge which approach is always better than the other, since the efficiency would depend on the target application values.\nFor instance, when one needs only the most precise sample with low latency, deterministic approaches would be better.\nIf we say that both approaches are necessary, our next question would be whether we can propose an efficient model for both types of prediction.\nTo answer the question, we study the possibility of using diffusion probabilistic models 0 1 for both deterministic and stochastic 3D motion prediction tasks. If we propose a diffusion probabilistic model 0 1 as a solution, one might ask us whether this is because we are fascinated by its performance in image generation 2 3.\nFrankly speaking, yes, we initiated this study out of our curiosity ‚Äì can we use diffusion probabilistic models for 3D motion prediction?\nUnfortunately, our experimental results show that the diffusion model cannot perfectly replace existing state-of-the-arts for both deterministic and stochastic motion prediction tasks.\nHowever, we found a glimpse of hope in diffusion models, due to their effectiveness in both prediction types after a single training procedure, and their ability to properly balance the trade-off between diversity and likelihood. Figure¬†1 shows the example results when the diffusion models are used for both deterministic and generative motion prediction tasks.\nAlthough a diffusion model is essentially a generative model, we found that the deterministic sample with a fair performance can be obtained from the diffusion model when all randomness is excluded from its denoising process.\nIn addition, we found out that the diffusion models can fix the flaws of several generative methods 8, which highlight the diversity of generated samples. Existing works as 8 claim that the likelihood of predicted samples is high when the minimum distance between samples and ground truth is low. Because of this, 8 can often generate the motions that are out-of-context as 4 pointed out. Compared to this, our diffusion models can generate prediction samples that are more likely to occur, so the generated motion does not diverge too much to be called out-of-context. The remaining paper is constructed as follows.\nAfter representing our literature survey in Section¬†II,\nSection¬†III will explain how general diffusion models work as well as how we design ours to solve 3D motion prediction tasks.\nSection¬†IV will show both qualitative and quantitative experiment results, and a related discussion will be also presented. Finally, this paper will end in Section¬†V by mentioning limitations and future works.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: , autonomous driving  , and human-robot/computer-interaction .\nMany approaches have been proposed to solve this problem, often based on the motion capture datasets such as Human3.6M  or SMPL [ref]7-based datasets such as AMASS .\nIn this paper, we concern with a task whose goal is to predict a sequence of 3D pose skeletons in Human3.6M and HumanEva-I  datasets, when a previously observed\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
