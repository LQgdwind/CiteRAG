      "content": "Paper Title: SLCA: Slow Learner with Classifier Alignment for Continual Learning on a Pre-trained Model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImplementation of Slow Learner: However, we argue that the performance of traditional baselines reported in [ref]46  is severely limited by using a uniform learning rate (e.g., 0.005) for both θr​p​ssubscript𝜃𝑟𝑝𝑠\\theta_{rps} and θc​l​ssubscript𝜃𝑐𝑙𝑠\\theta_{cls}. Through extensive experiments,\nwe observe that using a much smaller learning rate (0.0001) for θr​p​ssubscript𝜃𝑟𝑝𝑠\\theta_{rps} and a slightly larger learning rate (0.01) for θc​l​ssubscript𝜃𝑐𝑙𝑠\\theta_{cls} can greatly enhance the performance of traditional baselines (Fig. 2).111A comprehensive analysis of the effect of learning rate can be found in the appendix. The reported performance of sequential fine-tuning (Seq FT) is improved by more than 40% for challenging continual learning benchmarks such as Split CIFAR-100 and Split ImageNet-R, respectively, thus clearly outperforming the prompt-based approaches such as L2P [ref]46 and DualPrompt .222Please note that the prompt-based approaches [ref]46  use a fixed representation layer, so our proposal is not applicable for them.\nWe call this simple but surprisingly effective strategy “Slow Learner (SL)”, corresponding to slowing down the updating speed of the representation layer.\nIn contrast to previous works of using different learning rates for transfer learning   , the benefit of our proposal is specific to continual learning, as the upper bound performance (i.e., joint training) is only marginally improved by the SL while the performance gap between continual learning and joint training is greatly filled (e.g., only 4.36% on Split CIFAR-100 and 7.80% on Split ImageNet-R for Seq FT w/ SL). Effect of Pre-training Paradigm: We then evaluate the effect of pre-training paradigms (i.e., supervised or self-supervised) on downstream continual learning.\nHere we focus on ImageNet-1K as the pre-training dataset, since most self-supervised methods only release checkpoints on it.\nConsidering architectural consistency with previous works of CLPM [ref]46 , we select representative self-supervised methods (i.e., MoCo v3 [ref]4, MAE [ref]13 and BEiT ) that release checkpoints on ViT-B/16 in our comparisons. We further compare DeiT , a strong supervised method for (pre-)training vision transformer.\nAs shown in Fig. 3, self-supervised pre-training, while more realistic regarding labeling requirements and upstream continual learning, typically results in a larger performance gap between Seq FT and joint training than supervised pre-training.\nSimilarly, the use of SL can effectively reduce this gap.\nInterestingly, the performance of Seq FT w/ SL for MoCo v3 [ref]4 far exceeds that of the more recent MAE [ref]13, although their joint training performance is comparable. This is possibly because the pre-trained representations of MoCo v3 [ref]4 require remarkably smaller updates to learn all tasks well (Fig. 4, left Y-axis), thus alleviating the progressive overfitting problem. Meanwhile, the use of SL allows MoCo v3 [ref]4 to learn representations much closer to that of the joint training (Fig. 4, right Y-axis).\nThe above results suggest a new direction for the design of self-supervised paradigms, i.e., how to effectively perform downstream continual learning and combine the advantages of SL. Evaluation of Representation: So, why is the Slow Learner such effective, and what accounts for the remaining performance gap? We perform a linear probing experiment [ref]13 to evaluate the performance of the representation layer. Specifically, after learning each incremental task (e.g., 10 classes per task for 10 tasks in Split CIFAR-100) via Seq FT w/ SL, we fix the representation layer and employ an extra classification layer, called a linear probe, to learn all classes of the corresponding benchmark dataset (e.g., a total of 100 classes in CIFAR-100 dataset). The performance of these linear probes is presented in Fig. 5, which tends to grow with learning more tasks, indicating that the representation layer is accumulating knowledge for better adaptation. After learning all incremental tasks, it can be clearly seen that using the continually-learned representation layer to jointly train an extra classifier for all classes can almost reach the joint training performance of the entire model, and far outperform its counterpart with a continually-learned classifier (i.e., Seq FT w/ SL in Fig. 5). Therefore, the proposed SL can almost address the problem of the representation layer, yet the classification layer remains sub-optimal. In particular, the problem of classification layer becomes more severe for fine-grained continual learning benchmarks such as Split CUB-200 and Split Cars-196.\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: Implementation of Slow Learner: However, we argue that the performance of traditional baselines reported in [ref]46  is severely limited by using a uniform learning rate (e.g., 0.005) for both θr​p​ssubscript𝜃𝑟𝑝𝑠\\theta_{rps} and θc​l​ssubscript𝜃𝑐𝑙𝑠\\theta_{cls}.
