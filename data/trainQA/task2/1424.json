      "content": "Paper Title: Energy-constrained Self-training for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSelf-training for UDA is an iterative loss minimization framework , which regards pseudo-labels as learnable latent variables. The optimization objective for unlabeled target example is the cross-entropy with one-hot  or smoothed  pseudo-label. Therefore, a straightforward solution for adapting EBM to UDA is to incorporate Eq. 1 as a regularization term. For the target sample, it not only needs to achieve a good prediction of pseudo-label, but also minimize the energy of E𝐰​(𝐱t)subscript𝐸𝐰subscript𝐱𝑡E_{\\mathbf{w}}(\\mathbf{x}_{t}). Therefore, our energy-constraint is essentially depended on 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} and 𝐰𝐰\\mathbf{w}, which is more flexible than pre-defined label smoothing or entropy regularization . Considering that the pseudo-label is usually noisy, the latter objective is expected to be even more important than the setting of supervised learning. Following the formulation in our CRST , the self-training with EBM regularization (R-EBM) for target sample, i.e., E𝐰​(𝐱t)subscript𝐸𝐰subscript𝐱𝑡E_{\\mathbf{w}}(\\mathbf{x}_{t}), can be formulated as For each class k𝑘k, λksubscript𝜆𝑘\\lambda_{k} is determined by the confidence value selecting the most confident p𝑝p portion of class k𝑘k predictions in the entire target set . If a sample’s predication is relatively confident with p𝐰​(k∗|𝐱t)>λk∗subscript𝑝𝐰conditionalsuperscript𝑘subscript𝐱𝑡subscript𝜆superscript𝑘p_{\\mathbf{w}}(k^{*}|\\mathbf{x}_{t})>\\lambda_{k^{*}}, it is selected and labeled as class k∗=argmaxk​{p𝐰​(k|𝐱t)λk}superscript𝑘subscriptargmax𝑘subscript𝑝𝐰conditional𝑘subscript𝐱𝑡subscript𝜆𝑘k^{*}=\\text{argmax}_{k}\\{\\frac{p_{\\mathbf{w}}(k|{\\mathbf{x}_{t}})}{\\lambda_{k}}\\}. The less confident ones with p𝐰​(k∗|𝐱t)≤λk∗subscript𝑝𝐰conditionalsuperscript𝑘subscript𝐱𝑡subscript𝜆superscript𝑘p_{\\mathbf{w}}(k^{*}|\\mathbf{x}_{t})\\leq\\lambda_{k^{*}} are not selected. The same class-balanced λksubscript𝜆𝑘\\lambda_{k} strategy introduced in  is adopted for all self-training methods in this work. The feasible set is the union of {𝟎}0\\{\\mathbf{0}\\} and a probability simplex ΔK−1superscriptΔ𝐾1\\Delta^{K-1} . α𝛼\\alpha is a balancing hyper-parameter of the regularization term, which does not directly relate to the label y^tsubscript^𝑦𝑡\\hat{y}_{t}. The self-training can be solved by an alternating optimization scheme. Step 1) Pseudo-label generation    Fix 𝐰𝐰\\mathbf{w} and solve: For solving step 1), there is a global optimizer for arbitrary 𝐲^t=(y^t(1),…,y^t(K))subscript^𝐲𝑡superscriptsubscript^𝑦𝑡1…superscriptsubscript^𝑦𝑡𝐾\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}_{t}=(\\hat{y}_{t}^{(1)},...,\\hat{y}_{t}^{(K)}) as : Despite a long period of little development, there has been recent work   using the sampler based on SGLD to train the large-scale EBMs on high-dimensional data, parameterized by deep neural networks. Given that the goal of our work is to incorporate EBM training into the standard classification setting, the classification part is the same as , and we only change the regularizer. Therefore, we can follow [ref]15 to train the network with both cross-entropy loss and SGLD to ensure this distribution is being optimized with an unbiased objective. Similar to  we also adopt the contrastive divergence to estimate the expectation of derivative of the log-likelihood for a single example 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} with respect to 𝐰𝐰\\mathbf{w}. Since it gives an order of magnitude savings in computation compared to seeding new chains at each iteration as in . Step 2) Network retraining    Fix 𝐘^Tsubscript^𝐘𝑇\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}_{T} and minimize w.r.t. 𝐰𝐰\\mathbf{w}. Carrying out step 1) and 2) for one time is defined as one round in self-training.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: the goal of our work is to incorporate EBM training into the standard classification setting, the classification part is the same as , and we only change the regularizer.
