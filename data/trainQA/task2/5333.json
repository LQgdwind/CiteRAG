      "content": "Paper Title: Learning a Generic Value-Selection Heuristic Inside a Constraint Programming Solver\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCombinatorial optimization has countless industrial applications, such as scheduling, routing, or finance. Unfortunately, most of these problems are NP-hard and, thereby, challenging to solve efficiently. It is why finding good solutions has motivated intense research efforts for many years. Traditional methods for tackling them are somehow based on a search procedure: A clever enumeration of the solution space is performed to find a feasible and possibly optimal solution. Among these methods, constraint programming (CP) is an exact procedure. It constitutes a popular approach as it offers the possibility to find the optimal solution or good feasible approximations by stopping the search early. An additional asset is its declarative paradigm in modeling, which makes the technology easier for the end-user to grasp. Introducing solver-agnostic modeling languages, such as MiniZinc  has greatly facilitated this aspect. Aligned with this goal, the propagation engine inside a CP solver is mostly hidden from the end-user. However, ensuring a generic search procedure is trickier as non-trivial heuristics must be designed to make the solving process efficient for an arbitrary problem. That being said, generic variable-selection and value-selection heuristics have been successfully designed. Notable examples are impact-based search [ref]37 or activity-based search , but they require computationally intensive initialization and yield poor performance at the beginning of the search. This makes these methods not always appropriate for general use. As a concrete example, the current version of MiniZinc111https://www.minizinc.org/doc-2.7.0/en does not propose generic value-selection heuristics, except in(out)domain or impact-based search. In practice, heuristics are often designed thanks to problem-specific expert knowledge, which is often out of reach for end-users that do not have a solid background in artificial intelligence. In another context, machine learning (ML) has been recently considered for automating the design of branching heuristics, both in constraint programming , mixed-integer programming  , or SAT solving .\nSpecifically, reinforcement learning (RL)  or imitation learning  approaches, often combined with deep learning , have gained special attention.\nAlthough this idea seems appealing, this is not an easy task to achieve in practice as several technical considerations must be taken into account in\norder to ensure both the efficiency and the genericity of the approach.\nIn constraint programming, we identified three questions to resolve when learning a generic branching heuristic inside a solver. They are as follows: How to train the machine learning model? An intuitive way is to leverage an RL agent that would explore the tree search by making branching decisions and rewarding it based on the quality of the solution found on a terminal node.\nThis would typically be done with a depth-first search traversal of the tree for getting a certificate of optimality.\nHowever, as pointed out by several authors  , the backtracking operations inside a solver raise difficulties when formalizing the task as a Markov decision process and may require redefining it.\nBesides, this training scheme intensifies the credit assignment problem , ubiquitous in reinforcement learning. How to evaluate the quality of a value selection? A core component of an RL environment is the reward function, which gives a score to each decision performed. The end goal for the agent is to perform a sequence of decisions leading to the best-accumulated sum of rewards. In our case, an intuitive solution would be to reward the agent according to the quality of the solution found.\nHowever, this information is only available at terminal nodes, and only a zero reward is provided in branching nodes. This is related to the sparse reward problematic, which is known to complicate the training process. How to learn from a CP model? This question relates to the type of architecture that can obtain a value-selection heuristic from a search node (i.e., a partially solved CP model). A promising direction has been proposed by Gasse et al.  for binary mixed-integer programs. They introduced a bipartite graph linking variables and constraints (i.e., the two types of nodes) when a variable is involved in a given constraint. The subsequent architecture is a heterogeneous graph neural network. However, this encoding is not directly applicable in constraint programming, as a CP model generally involves non-binary variables and combinatorial constraints.\nThis has been partially addressed by Chalumeau et al. , who introduced a tripartite graph where variables, values, and constraints are specific types of nodes. However, this approach lacks genericity as the method requires retraining when the number of variables changes. To our knowledge, answering such questions is still an open challenge in the research community. This paper proposes to progress in this direction. It introduces a generic learning procedure that can be used to obtain a value-selection heuristic from a constraint programming model given as input.\nThe approach has been designed to be generic in that it can be used for any CP model given as input. In practice, a specific way to extract features from a constraint should be designed for any available constraint, but this has to be done only once per constraint type. In this proof of concept, we limit our experiments to three combinatorial optimization problems, namely graph coloring, maximum independent set, and maximum cut.\nSpecifically, we propose three main contributions, each dedicated to addressing one of the aforementioned difficulties.\nThey are as follows: (1) a learning procedure, based on restarts, for training a reinforcement learning agent directly inside a CP solver,\n(2) a reward function able to assign non-zero intermediate rewards based on the propagation that has been carried out on the node,\nand (3) a neural architecture based on a tripartite graph representation and a heterogeneous graph neural network.\nExperimental results show that combining these three ideas enables the search to find good solutions without requiring many backtracks and competes with the well-known impact-based and activity-based search heuristics. The paper is structured as follows. The next section presents other approaches related to our contribution.\nThen, Section 3 introduces succinctly technical background on reinforcement learning and graph neural networks.\nThe core contributions are then presented in Section 4.\nFinally, Section 5 provides experimental results and closes with a discussion of the results.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: process efficient for an arbitrary problem.
