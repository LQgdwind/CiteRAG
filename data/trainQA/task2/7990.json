      "content": "Paper Title: iMIV: in-Memory Integrity Verification for NVM\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNVM’s byte-level persistence enables developing recoverable programs where computation can be resumed after a system crash or power failure   .\nHowever, the data retention across power cycles renders NVM’s contents susceptible to various data remanence attacks, while such attacks are not possible in DRAM. Typically, counter-mode encryption (CME) is used for its efficiency, where a counter is incremented every time the data is written from trusted processor boundaries (SoC) to the NVM.\nWhile encryption protects confidentiality, it cannot guarantee data integrity, i.e., the user will be unable to determine if the data was tampered with or not.\nTo detect tampering, a hash called the Stateful Message Authentication Code (SMAC) is generated and stored along with the ciphertext.\nAfter retrieving the ciphertext from the untrusted NVM storage media, the hash is recalculated and checked against the SMAC. A mismatch indicates data integrity failure. An attacker, however, can still replay older responses by snooping on the bus.\nAn integrity tree, such as the Bonsai Merkel Tree (BMT), is computed over the per-block counters used in CME to guarantee freshness of counters, and thus, detect replay attacks.\nBMT root is persisted in the trusted SoC. When a counter block is retrieved from the NVM storage media, BMT is computed, and the root value is compared to the value on the SoC to ensure counter freshness.\nThe most recent counter value for a data block, along with SMAC, guarantees data freshness.\nPersisting the counter and SMAC, along with the ciphertext and updating the BMT root, guarantees the confidentiality and integrity of data. While it is not strictly necessary to persist intermediate BMT nodes for integrity verification, failing to do so has two major drawbacks as follows.\n\\textbf{\\small{1}}⃝ If integrity check fails due to mismatch with the BMT root, then without intermediate BMT nodes it is impossible to find which data block was tampered.\nEven a single tampered byte renders the entire content of many terabytes of NVM unreliable.\n\\textbf{\\small{2}}⃝ Upon boot after a crash or power cycle, the entire BMT must be reconstructed for integrity verification of NVM contents which can take hours on systems\nwith terabytes of aggregate NVM capacity . Therefore, all intermediate nodes from the leaf to the root of a BMT should be persisted for each write to enable fine-grain verifiability.\nUnfortunately, most prior works on secure NVM     avoid persisting intermediate BMT nodes due to high overheads.\nAlso, the height of BMT increases with aggregate NVM capacity on the system.\nFor instance, processors can accommodate several terabytes of aggregate NVM capacity , resulting in a BMT with 10 or more levels.\nTriad-NVM  trade-offs performance for better verifiability and shorter recovery time by partially persisting the BMT nodes, but\nit can still result in gigabytes of unverifiable region in case of a BMT root mismatch. We aim to design a secure NVM that provides fine-grained data integrity verification and confidentiality at low-performance overheads and fast recovery times.\nThis necessitates computing and persisting all the intermediate BMT nodes, in addition to SMAC and counters, on every write to NVM with minimal overhead. Toward this, we first analyze the overheads of fine-grained data integrity verification.\nUnlike prior works, we find a more realistic estimate of the overheads by assessing NVM-aware applications that only persist the data needed for the correct recovery.\nConsequently, only a fraction of stores persist to NVMs .\nIn contrast, prior works      assumed all data remains in NVM (NVM-agnostic application) that may overestimate the overheads of secure NVM (22.1×22.1\\times slowdown, on average).\nHowever, even with NVM-aware applications, the securing NVM contents can slow down applications by 3×3\\times, on average, and by up to 22×22\\times for memory-intensive workloads. Next, we identified that prior studies on secure NVM did not\nconsider the limited bandwidth of NVMs.\nFor example, the write bandwidth of a single Intel Optane NVDIMM is only 2.32.32.3GB/sec [ref]42.\nPrior solutions such as Triad-NVM , ProMT , and BMF  that execute all security operations in the memory controller cause substantial additional off-chip traffic and bandwidth contention (e.g., 9×9\\times) to access and persist security metadata.\nWe find that persisting BMT nodes alone account for up to 71%percent7171\\% of the off-chip traffic to NVM. Driven by these observations, we propose to divide the responsibility of securing NVM contents between the on-chip memory controller and the NVDIMM.\nSpecifically, we move the memory-intensive integrity verification to the NVDIMM to avoid off-chip traffic for updates to BMT nodes while retaining the compute-intensive encryption engine at the memory controller.\nOur design, named in-Memory Integrity Verification (iMIV), eliminates the off-chip traffic for updating BMT nodes while conforming to the rigorous threat model §III-A through several novel techniques. . An obvious question is whether iMIV is expanding the trusted computing base (TCB) beyond what is the norm today by relying on the logic in NVDIMM for integrity verification.\nHowever, contrary to typical assumptions in research articles, real commercial incarnation of NVDIMM does not consist solely of storage media.\nFor example, the top part of Figure 1 shows the internals of commercial Intel Optane NVDIMM 5.\nAn NVDIMM hosts the logic for remapping physical addresses to media addresses and, more critically, an inbuilt encryption engine, besides the NVM media itself 5.\nThe bottom diagram illustrates how commercial NVDIMMs feature distinct storage media and logic chips.\nSuch a design where the NVMDMM host a significant logic circuitry is not unique to Optane.\nFor example, Samsung’s new CXL-based memory module Hybrid (CMM-H) that supports NVM functionality also sports compute logic that helps in enforcing memory management polices 9. Further, on boot, the processor exchanges a secret passphrase with each NVDIMM for authentication 4.\nUnlike storage media, logic circuitry does not retain states across power cycles that an attacker can exploit.\nHence, the logic chip on NVDIMM, e.g., in Optane, is trusted, but storage media is not.\nConsequently, iMIV does not extend the TCB beyond what it exits today.\nSection III-A details our threat model. Another key advantage of iMIV is that it scales with the per-DIMM capacity rather than the aggregate NVM capacity in a system.\nSince the height of BMT is proportional to the amount of data it protects, as NVM capacity increases, so does BMT’s height, resulting in increased overheads.\nIn iMIV, each NVDIMM maintains a separate (sub-)BMT whose height is determined solely by that DIMM’s capacity and is independent of the aggregate NVM capacity in the system. Furthermore, iMIV employs a novel split BMT cache that uses the fact that BMT nodes near the root (upper-level BMT nodes) are updated more frequently than those further down (lower-level nodes).\nWe, thus, partition a typical BMT cache into two.\nOne component is dedicated to buffering only the upper-level nodes.\nWith only a few upper-level nodes, a 72-entry buffer is adequate to avoid replacements. On a power-down event, the contents of this buffer is persisted.\nThe second part is the usual BMT cache that caches only the lower-level nodes and is non-persistent.\nThis reduces writes to NVM media with limited write endurance. We evaluated iMIV with 10 workloads, each with two versions: NVM-aware and NVM-agnostic.\nWe demonstrated that for NVM-aware workloads, iMIV enables strong security guarantees with fine-grain verifiability at a performance overhead of only 55%percent5555\\% over a system with no security guarantees.\nWe quantitatively compare iMIV it against many prior works – Triad-NVM , PLP , ProMT , SBMF .\nOur results for NVM-aware applications show that iMIV achieves average speedup of 2×2\\times, 1.78×1.78\\times, 1.68×1.68\\times, 1.59×1.59\\times and 1.38×1.38\\times over a baseline with all security guarantees but no optimizations, PLP, Triad, ProMT, and SBMF, respectively. In summary, we make the following contributions: We quantitatively demonstrate that under realistic off-chip NVM bandwidth, persisting BMT nodes emerges as the key bottleneck for secure NVM with fine-grain verifiability. We designed iMIV, that leverages in-memory computing on NVMDIMM for integrity verification of persistent data. We show that, in comparison to prior techniques, iMIV provides strong security guarantees at lower overheads (§VII).\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: Next, we identified that prior studies on secure NVM did not\nconsider the limited bandwidth of NVMs.\nFor example, the write bandwidth of a single Intel Optane NVDIMM is only 2.32.32.3GB/sec [ref]42.\nPrior solutions such as Triad-NVM , ProMT , and BMF  that execute all security operations in the memory controller cause substantial additional off-chip traffic and bandwidth contention\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
