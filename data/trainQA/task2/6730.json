For instance, the problem of slow convergence of MARL policy is addressed in , where, to tackle the slow learning, the authors propose central knowledge transfer units for the participating agents.\nSimilarly, to mitigate the curse of dimensionality in conventional ES-driven MARL platforms, several novel MARL algorithms based on mixed Q-networks , simultaneous learning 0 , and differential advising\n  have been developed. Specifically,  reduces the number of inter-agent communications by (1) limiting the students to seek advice from the teachers only when their confidence is low for a given state, and (2) limiting the teachers to respond only when they believe they have much knowledge for that state. Nonetheless,  overlooks the possibility of adversarial manipulation and inference, which may impede the success of ES processes in real-life MARL applications. An alternative approach to simultaneous learning, the iteration-based Q-learning is proposed in 0, where a centralized aggregator forms a swarm matrix containing the extremes of Q-values from all agents. Nonetheless, centralized aggregation may possess various drawbacks (e.g., single-point-of-failure) despite its fast convergence. Intuitively, a decentralized mechanism is more effective in an environment with resource-constrained edge devices\nthan a centralized mechanism. Moreover, decentralization alleviates the single-point-of-failure problem. Considering this, 9 introduces a decentralized and heuristic Q-value advising method called PSAF that addresses when to ask for the advice, when to give the advice, and how to use the advice in a teacher-student framework. However, decentralization may create opportunities for the Byzantine and inference attackers 5.\nField research and experience of MARL application’s post-deployment   show that any malicious agent, in general, may conduct eavesdropping, inference attacks, Byzantine attacks, etc., creating significant security and privacy challenges for multiagent systems (MAS). Researchers partially solve the false advising in MARL . They design the adviser selection problem as a Multi-armed bandit and solve it using the DP technique. However, their assumption of eliminating probabilistic false advice by malicious agents through direct DP integration does not hold in the presence of any strategic attacker. The extension of their work involves accommodating the advice from a slightly different state . Yet, they adopt the DP mechanism for learning performance improvement only, but not to protect the privacy and security of the agents. Privacy and security concerns in MAS are addressed in  [ref]27. From the privacy perspective, [ref]27 emphasizes preserving agents’ privacy against inference attackers by proposing a DP-MAS framework. From the security perspective,  shows that an adversary can mislead honest agents to attain its malicious objectives in a consensus-based MARL platform. However, both  [ref]27 are limited to centralized environments, and thus, cannot apply to decentralized MARL applications. We summarize major contrasting points between literature and this work in Table I.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: state .
