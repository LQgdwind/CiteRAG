      "content": "Paper Title: Promise Constraint Satisfaction and Width1footnote 11footnote 1Work partially supported by Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación (MICIN) through project PID2019-109137GB-C22 (PROOFS).\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe input to the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is a set of\nvariables, each ranging over a specified domain of values, as well as\na set of constraints, each binding a finite set of variables to take\nvalues in a relation from a specified set of relations. The problem\nasks to find an assignment of values to the variables in such a way\nthat all the constraints are satisfied. It was first pointed out by\nFeder and Vardi  that the CSP can be modelled as\nthe homomorphism problem for relational structures. In this view, the\ninput to the CSP is a pair of relational structures, the\ninstance 𝐈𝐈\\operatorname{{\\bf I}} and the constraint language 𝐒𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}, and we\nare asked to find a homomorphism from 𝐈𝐈\\operatorname{{\\bf I}} to 𝐒𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}; i.e., a map from\nthe domain of 𝐈𝐈\\operatorname{{\\bf I}} to the domain of 𝐒𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf S}} in such a way that all the\nrelations are preserved. In the fixed-template variant of the\nproblem, the constraint language is fixed and part of the definition\nof the problem, and the instance is the only input. The fixed-template\nCSP with template 𝐒𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf S}} is denoted by CSP⁡(𝐒)CSP𝐒\\operatorname{CSP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}). As confirmed in retrospect, one of the most important problems raised\nby the seminal work of Feder and Vardi was that of characterizing the\nclass of fixed-template CSPs of bounded width. In short, these\nare the fixed-template CSPs whose instances are always correctly\nsolved by the so-called consistency algorithm with a fixed bound on\nits width. This class of CSPs was later studied in depth in the\nwork of Kolaitis and\nVardi  , where it was shown\nto constitute a robust fragment of the class of polynomial-time\nsolvable CSPs that admits several equivalent reformulations. After two decades of work in the area, the question of fully\ncharacterizing the CSPs of bounded-width was eventually answered in\nthe work of Barto and Kozik . Besides resolving one of\nthe key problems in , the Barto-Kozik Theorem\nproduced many important new insights for the theory of CSPs\nitself. This line of work eventually led to the\nproof of the celebrated Feder-Vardi Dichotomy Conjecture, due to\nZhuk  and, independently,\nBulatov . This completed the program started by\nFeder and Vardi , Jeavons, Cohen, and\nGyssens , and Bulatov, Jeavons and\nKrokhin , that aimed to characterize\nthe class of all polynomial-time solvable fixed-template CSPs by the\nalgebraic closure properties of their templates. By today, it is fair\nto say that almost all important questions raised by the early work of\nFeder and Vardi for the fixed-template CSP seem to have been resolved. Recently, Brakensiek and Guruswami 2 have put\nforward a generalization of the fixed-template CSP as a natural next\nstep in the development of the theory. In the Fixed Template\nPromise Constraint Satisfaction Problem (PCSP) the template is a\nfixed pair (𝐒,𝐓)𝐒𝐓(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}) of relational structures such that there is a\nhomomorphism from 𝐒𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf S}} to 𝐓𝐓\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}. The problem has two variants: Search variant of PCSP⁡(𝐒,𝐓)PCSP𝐒𝐓\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}): The instance is a relational\nstructure 𝐈𝐈\\operatorname{{\\bf I}} with the promise that there is a homomorphism\nfrom 𝐈𝐈\\operatorname{{\\bf I}} to 𝐒𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}\nand we are asked to find a homomorphism from 𝐈𝐈\\operatorname{{\\bf I}} to 𝐓𝐓\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}. Decision variant of PCSP⁡(𝐒,𝐓)PCSP𝐒𝐓\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}): The instance is a\nrelational structure 𝐈𝐈\\operatorname{{\\bf I}} and we are asked to distinguish the\ncase in which there is a homomorphism from 𝐈𝐈\\operatorname{{\\bf I}} to 𝐒𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf S}} from the\ncase in which there is not even a homomorphism from 𝐈𝐈\\operatorname{{\\bf I}}\nto 𝐓𝐓\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}. For this variant the promise is that 𝐈𝐈\\operatorname{{\\bf I}} fullfils one\nof these two conditions. To motivate the generalization, it is useful to look at some special\ncases. First, it is obvious that PCSP⁡(𝐒,𝐒)PCSP𝐒𝐒\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}},\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}) is just the same\nproblem as CSP⁡(𝐒)CSP𝐒\\operatorname{CSP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}), hence any fixed-template CSP is a\nfixed-template PCSP. Second, consider the following graph-coloring\nproblem. We are given a graph 𝐆𝐆\\operatorname{\\mathbf{G}} with the promise that it has an\nunknown proper p𝑝p-coloring for a certain number of colors p𝑝p, and we\nare asked to find a proper q𝑞q-coloring for a fixed put potentially\nlarger target number of colors q𝑞q. By viewing the\nproper q𝑞q-colorings of 𝐆𝐆\\operatorname{\\mathbf{G}} as the homomorphisms into the complete\ngraph 𝐊qsubscript𝐊𝑞\\operatorname{{\\bf K}}_{q} with q𝑞q vertices, PCSP⁡(𝐊p,𝐊q)PCSPsubscript𝐊𝑝subscript𝐊𝑞\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf K}}_{p},\\operatorname{{\\bf K}}_{q}) models the\nproblem of approximating the chromatic number of a graph. We refer to\nthis as the Approximate Graph Coloring Problem with parameters p𝑝p\nand q𝑞q. The special case with p=q𝑝𝑞p=q is exactly the same\nas CSP⁡(𝐊q)CSPsubscript𝐊𝑞\\operatorname{CSP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf K}}_{q}), the standard Graph q𝑞q-Coloring Problem for\nundirected graphs, which, for q≥3𝑞3q\\geq 3, is one of the twenty-one\nNP-complete problems of Karp . The problem\nof 4-coloring 3-colorable graphs, PCSP⁡(𝐊3,𝐊4)PCSPsubscript𝐊3subscript𝐊4\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf K}}_{3},\\operatorname{{\\bf K}}_{4}), was shown\nNP-hard in the early 1990’s, using the theory of probabilistically\ncheckable proofs (PCP) . Not until two decades later\nhas it been shown that the problem of 5-coloring 3-colorable graphs is\nNP-hard, and, more generally, that PCSP⁡(𝐊p,𝐊2​p−1)PCSPsubscript𝐊𝑝subscript𝐊2𝑝1\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf K}}_{p},\\operatorname{{\\bf K}}_{2p-1}) is\nNP-hard for any p≥3𝑝3p\\geq 3 . The problem of exactly\nidentifying the pairs (p,q)𝑝𝑞(p,q) with p≤q𝑝𝑞p\\leq q for\nwhich PCSP⁡(𝐊p,𝐊q)PCSPsubscript𝐊𝑝subscript𝐊𝑞\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf K}}_{p},\\operatorname{{\\bf K}}_{q}) is NP-hard is one of the leading open\nproblems in the area, with deep connections with the theories of PCPs\nand hardness of approximation , and the notorious Unique\nGames Conjecture . The theory of Promise PCSP has been further developped (see\n[ref]6          \nfor example) and applied to other problems beyond graph coloring. The\ngoal of this paper is to initiate a study of the power of the\nconsistency algorithm for the fixed-template PCSP. Following\n, in this new context, the consistency algorithm can be\nthought of in the following terms. Fix a PCSP template (𝐒,𝐓)𝐒𝐓(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}})\nand an integer k≥1𝑘1k\\geq 1. We say that PCSP⁡(𝐒,𝐓)PCSP𝐒𝐓\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}) is\nsolvable in width k𝑘k if, for every instance 𝐈𝐈\\operatorname{{\\bf I}}, it holds\nthat if 𝐈𝐈\\operatorname{{\\bf I}} is k𝑘k-consistent with respect to the\nleft-template 𝐒𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}, then there is a homomorphism from 𝐈𝐈\\operatorname{{\\bf I}} to the\nright-template 𝐓𝐓\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}. Here, as in the standard consistency algorithm\nfor the standard CSP, an instance 𝐈𝐈\\operatorname{{\\bf I}} is said to\nbe k𝑘k-consistent with respect to 𝐒𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf S}} if the algorithm that\nchecks if the set of all subinstances of 𝐈𝐈\\operatorname{{\\bf I}} with at most k𝑘k\nelements admits a system of compatible homomorphisms into 𝐒𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf S}} does\nnot find a blatant contradiction. For each fixed integer k𝑘k, this\nalgorithm runs in polynomial time. When PCSP⁡(𝐒,𝐓)PCSP𝐒𝐓\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}) is solvable\nin width k𝑘k we also say that the template (𝐒,𝐓)𝐒𝐓(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}) has\nwidth k𝑘k. A key insight from the theory of CSPs is that the computational\ncomplexity of a fixed-template CSP is governed by the algebraic\nstructure of the polymorphisms of its\ntemplate . This phenomenon led to the so-called\nalgebraic approach to CSPs, of which the aforementioned\nBarto-Kozik, Zhuk, and Bulatov Theorems are prime examples. Indeed,\nthe governing power of polymorphisms is so general that the phenomenon\nhas been observed to hold for other ways of measuring the complexity\nof the problem. In particular, it applies to the analysis of bounded\nwidth , to the more general settings of descriptive\ncomplexity  and propositional proof\ncomplexity [ref]3, and even to different variants of\nthe CSP itself. For PCSPs, a suitable definition of polymorphisms has\nbeen put forward to show that the computational and width complexity\nof a PCSP is, again, governed by the polymorphisms of its\ntemplate . A natural question at this point is whether the analogue of the\nBarto-Kozik Theorem holds for PCSPs. In the language of polymorphisms,\nthe Barto-Kozik Theorem for CSPs can be stated as the equivalence of\nthe following two statements: CSP⁡(𝐒)CSP𝐒\\operatorname{CSP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}) is solvable in some bounded width, CSP⁡(𝐒)CSP𝐒\\operatorname{CSP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}) admits weak near unanimity (WNU) polymorphisms of all large arities. In definition, this last condition means that, for any large enough\ninteger m𝑚m, there exists a homomorphism f:𝐒m→𝐒:𝑓→superscript𝐒𝑚𝐒f:\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}^{m}\\to\\operatorname{{\\bf S}} from\nthe m𝑚m-power 𝐒msuperscript𝐒𝑚\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}^{m} into 𝐒𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf S}} that satisfies the weak near\nunanimity (WNU) identities: for all choices of x𝑥x and y𝑦y in the domain of 𝐒𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}. Turning to PCSP, for a fixed template (𝐒,𝐓)𝐒𝐓(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}), consider the\nfollowing statements: PCSP⁡(𝐒,𝐓)PCSP𝐒𝐓\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}) is solvable in some bounded width, PCSP⁡(𝐒,𝐓)PCSP𝐒𝐓\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}) admits WNU polymorphisms of all large arities. Following , a WNU polymorphism of PCSP⁡(𝐒,𝐓)PCSP𝐒𝐓\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}) is a\nhomomorphism f:𝐒m→𝐓:𝑓→superscript𝐒𝑚𝐓f:\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}^{m}\\to\\operatorname{{\\bf T}} from the m𝑚m-power 𝐒msuperscript𝐒𝑚\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}^{m} of the\nleft-template 𝐒𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf S}} into the right-template 𝐓𝐓\\operatorname{{\\bf T}} that satisfies\nEquation (1) for all x𝑥x and y𝑦y in the domain of 𝐒𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}. The first technically novel result of this paper is that (b’) is a\nnecessary but not sufficient condition for (a’): Main Result: (a’)⟹⟹\\Longrightarrow (b’) ⟹̸⟹̸\\not\\Longrightarrow (a’). To prove that (a’) ⟹⟹\\Longrightarrow (b’) we first establish a\nstructural result about the template that may be of independent\ninterest. We show that any template (𝐒,𝐓)𝐒𝐓(\\operatorname{{\\bf S}},\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}) whose PCSP is solvable\nin some bounded width satisfies the following property: either a\nproper subset of S×S𝑆𝑆S\\times S can be obtained by composing two binary\nprojections of the relations in 𝐒𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}, where S𝑆S is the domain\nof 𝐒𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}, or else the problem is trivial because 𝐓𝐓\\operatorname{{\\bf T}} contains a\nreflexive tuple and then any instance admits a homomorphism\nto 𝐓𝐓\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}. In its proof we need to resort to a probabilistic\nconstruction of a large instance 𝐈𝐈\\operatorname{{\\bf I}} that is sparse enough to\nbe k𝑘k-consistent with respect to 𝐒𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf S}}, for any fixed k𝑘k, but\ndense enough to not admit a homomomorphisms into 𝐓𝐓\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}. The reasoning that goes into the analysis of the probabilistic\nconstruction of this instance is reminiscent of the methods for\nproving lower bounds for Resolution in propositional proof complexity,\ngoing back to the influential work of Chvátal and\nSzeméredi  and posterior follow-ups\n(particularly, 0\nand ). Indeed, as in these related works,\nour analysis shows that the random instance 𝐈𝐈\\operatorname{{\\bf I}} is k𝑘k-consistent\nwith respect to 𝐒𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf S}} for k𝑘k as large as ϵ​nitalic-ϵ𝑛\\epsilon n, where n𝑛n is\nthe number of elements in 𝐈𝐈\\operatorname{{\\bf I}}, and ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon is a fixed positive\nconstant that depends only on 𝐒𝐒\\operatorname{{\\bf S}} and 𝐓𝐓\\operatorname{{\\bf T}}. This means that the\nnecessary condition (b’) applies also to all PCSPs that are solvable\nin sublinear width; i.e., in width k=k​(n)=o​(n)𝑘𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑛k=k(n)=o(n), where n𝑛n\nis the number of elements in the instance. It should be pointed out\nthat, for standard CSPs, it was already known that the Barto-Kozik\nTheorem can also be strengthened to show that a fixed-template CSP is\nsolvable in bounded width if and only if it is solvable in sublinear\nwidth (see, e.g., [ref]3). To prove that (b’) ⟹̸⟹̸\\not\\Longrightarrow (a’), we analyze the\npolymorphisms of a specific Boolean PCSP template, i.e., one\nwith a two-element domain {0,1}01\\{0,1\\},\nnamely (2​-​IN​-​4​-​SAT,4​-​NAE​-​SAT)2-IN-4-SAT4-NAE-SAT(2\\mathrm{\\text{-}\\mathrm{IN}\\text{-}}4\\mathrm{\\text{-}}\\mathrm{SAT},4\\mathrm{\\text{-}\\mathrm{NAE}\\text{-}\\mathrm{SAT}}). We first show that this template\nadmits WNU polymorphisms of all large arities, and then apply the\nstructural result of the previous paragraph to conclude that it is not\nsolvable in bounded width. This analysis also led us to conclude that,\nfor any two integers s𝑠s and r𝑟r such that 0<s<r0𝑠𝑟0<s<r and r>2𝑟2r>2,\nthe Boolean PCSP⁡(s​-​IN​-​r​-​SAT,r​-​NAE​-​SAT)PCSP𝑠-IN-𝑟-SAT𝑟-NAE-SAT\\operatorname{PCSP}(s\\mathrm{\\text{-}\\mathrm{IN}\\text{-}}r\\mathrm{\\text{-}}\\mathrm{SAT},r\\mathrm{\\text{-}\\mathrm{NAE}\\text{-}\\mathrm{SAT}}) is not solvable in bounded\nwidth, but is solvable in the second level of the Sherali-Adams\nhierarchy applied to its basic linear programming relaxation. This is\nin sharp constrast with the status for standard CSPs for which, as is\nknown, the fixed-template CSPs that are solvable in bounded-width and\nthose that are solvable in some fixed-level of the Sherali-Adams\nhierarchy coincide (this follows, e.g., from the Barto-Kozik Theorem\ncombined with the results in \nand ). To show that PCSP⁡(s​-​IN​-​r​-​SAT,r​-​NAE​-​SAT)PCSP𝑠-IN-𝑟-SAT𝑟-NAE-SAT\\operatorname{PCSP}(s\\mathrm{\\text{-}\\mathrm{IN}\\text{-}}r\\mathrm{\\text{-}}\\mathrm{SAT},r\\mathrm{\\text{-}\\mathrm{NAE}\\text{-}\\mathrm{SAT}})\ncan be solved in the second level of the Sherali-Adams hierarchy we\nbuild on the recent results on Boolean PCSPs from\n2. As a corollary to the aforementioned structural result we obtain a\ncomplete classification of the Approximate Graph Coloring Problems\nthat are solvable in bounded width. We show that PCSP⁡(𝐊p,𝐊q)PCSPsubscript𝐊𝑝subscript𝐊𝑞\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf K}}_{p},\\operatorname{{\\bf K}}_{q})\nis not solvable in bounded width for any two constants p𝑝p\nand q𝑞q, such that p≤q𝑝𝑞p\\leq q, unless p=1𝑝1p=1 or p=2𝑝2p=2. For any two integers p𝑝p and q𝑞q such\nthat 1≤p≤q1𝑝𝑞1\\leq p\\leq q, the following statements are equivalent: PCSP⁡(𝐊p,𝐊q)PCSPsubscript𝐊𝑝subscript𝐊𝑞\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf K}}_{p},\\operatorname{{\\bf K}}_{q}) is solvable by the consistency algorithm in width 333, PCSP⁡(𝐊p,𝐊q)PCSPsubscript𝐊𝑝subscript𝐊𝑞\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf K}}_{p},\\operatorname{{\\bf K}}_{q}) is solvable by the consistency algorithm in bounded width, PCSP⁡(𝐊p,𝐊q)PCSPsubscript𝐊𝑝subscript𝐊𝑞\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\operatorname{{\\bf K}}_{p},\\operatorname{{\\bf K}}_{q}) is solvable by the consistency algorithm in sublinear width, p=1𝑝1p=1 or p=2𝑝2p=2. We note that this classification agrees with the one\npredicted by the NP-hardness results that would follow from certain\nvariants of the Unique Games Conjecture , but ours is\nunconditional. Turning to upper bounds for the Approximate Graph Coloring Problem, we\nobserve that the well-known algorithm due to Wigderson\n that properly colors any 3-colorable graph\nwith n𝑛n vertices with O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(\\sqrt{n}) colors is implementable in\nwidth 444. We generalize Wigderson’s algorithm to show that, for any\nfixed real ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon in the interval (0,1/2)012(0,1/2), the problem of\ndistinguishing 333-colorable from non-O​(nϵ)𝑂superscript𝑛italic-ϵO(n^{\\epsilon})-colorable graphs\nwith n𝑛n vertices can be solved in width n1−2​ϵsuperscript𝑛12italic-ϵn^{1-2\\epsilon}. This leads\nto a simple algorithm that properly colors any 333-colorable graph\nwith O​(nϵ)𝑂superscript𝑛italic-ϵO(n^{\\epsilon}) colors in\ntime 2Θ​(n1−2​ϵ​log⁡(n))superscript2Θsuperscript𝑛12italic-ϵ𝑛2^{\\Theta(n^{1-2\\epsilon}\\log(n))}. Asymptotically, this beats\nthe straightforward 2Θ​(n1−ϵ)superscript2Θsuperscript𝑛1italic-ϵ2^{\\Theta(n^{1-\\epsilon})} time-bound that\nfollows from partitioning the graph into O​(nϵ)𝑂superscript𝑛italic-ϵO(n^{\\epsilon}) many\nindependent parts each of size O​(n1−ϵ)𝑂superscript𝑛1italic-ϵO(n^{1-\\epsilon}). As a nearly\nmatching lower bound, we show that the same problem cannot be solved\nin width less than n1−3​ϵsuperscript𝑛13italic-ϵn^{1-3\\epsilon}. The problem of closing the gap\nbetween the 1−3​ϵ13italic-ϵ1-3\\epsilon in the lower bound and the 1−2​ϵ12italic-ϵ1-2\\epsilon in\nthe upper bound is left as an intriguing open problem.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: in the area, with deep connections with the theories of PCPs\nand hardness of approximation , and the notorious Unique\nGames Conjecture .
