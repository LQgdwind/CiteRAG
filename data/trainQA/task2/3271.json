      "content": "Paper Title: Polyline Simplification under the Local Fréchet Distance Has Almost-Quadratic Runtime in 2D\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe present an algorithm for polyline simplification under the local Fréchet distance\nin two dimensions and for several Lp norms with a (near-)quadratic running time;\nsee Section 3. Our algorithm heavily builds upon the Melkman–O’Rourke algorithm .\nThey exploit the geometric properties of the local Hausdorff distance using cone-shaped wedges and a wavefront to accelerate the shortcut graph construction.\nWe adapt both of these concepts to the local Fréchet distance.\nWe carefully study the properties of the resulting wavefront\nand explain how to maintain and efficiently update a wavefront data structure\nwhich at its core is a simple balanced binary search tree.\nAs our main result,\nwe prove that the asymptotic running time of the Melkman–O’Rourke algorithm does not increase with our modifications;\nsee Section 4. A two-dimensional n𝑛n-vertex polyline can be simplified optimally\nunder the local Fréchet distance in the L2 norm (the Euclidean norm)\nin 𝒪​(n2​log⁡n)𝒪superscript𝑛2𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n^{2}\\log n) time and 𝒪​(n)𝒪𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n) space. This is a large improvement compared to the cubic running time\nby Imai and Iri and by Godau and also to the best currently claimed\nrunning time bound of 𝒪​(n5/2+ε)𝒪superscript𝑛52𝜀\\mathcal{O}(n^{5/2+\\varepsilon}) ,\ncompared to which it is also simpler.\nIt is also faster than the 𝒪​(n2​log2⁡n)𝒪superscript𝑛2superscript2𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n^{2}\\log^{2}n) running time of\nthe weak simplification algorithm by Guibas et al. ([ref]19, Theorem 14) by a logarithmic factor.\nHowever, we remark that parts of their algorithm\n(Def. 4, Theorem 7, Lemma 8, Lemma 9) can be used\nto obtain the same result as described in their article\nand we partially re-use their techniques.\nYet, their procedure is more complicated since it maintains\nmore geometric information only needed for weak simplifications.\nOur algorithm is hence more straight-forward for the setting of\npolyline simplification under the local Fréchet distance,\nwhich makes it conceptually easier to understand. Furthermore, we show that under the L1 and L∞ norm,\nthe wavefront has constant complexity which improves the running time to 𝒪​(n2)𝒪superscript𝑛2\\mathcal{O}(n^{2}).\nWe argue that for\na natural class of polylines, a quadratic running time can be achieved as well.\nTo this end, we introduce the concept of ν𝜈\\nu-light polylines;\nsee Section 5. A two-dimensional n𝑛n-vertex polyline can be simplified optimally under the\nlocal Fréchet distance in the L1 and L∞ norm in 𝒪​(n2)𝒪superscript𝑛2\\mathcal{O}(n^{2}) time and 𝒪​(n)𝒪𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n) space. Besides this new application for the local Fréchet distance, investigating\nthe structure and implementation of wedges and wavefronts is of independent interest\nand may also help to understand better the work\nby Melkman and O’Rourke  from 1988\nand the algorithm by Guibas et al. [ref]19,\nwho both employ these data structures but give little detail\non its structural properties and on how to perform operations with the wavefront.\nTo this end, we have an extensive appendix with detailed proofs,\nwhich we have separated from the main part to keep the algorithm\ndescription more compact and understandable on its own,\nwhile the interested reader can find the additional content in the appendix.\nStatements whose proofs can be found\nin the appendix are marked with “⋆⋆\\star”.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: to which it is also simpler.\nIt is also faster than the 𝒪​(n2​log2⁡n)𝒪superscript𝑛2superscript2𝑛\\mathcal{O}(n^{2}\\log^{2}n) running time of\nthe weak simplification algorithm by Guibas et al. ([ref]19, Theorem 14) by a logarithmic factor.\nHowever, we remark that parts of their algorithm\n(Def. 4, Theorem 7, Lemma 8, Lemma 9) can be used\nto obtain the same result as described in their\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
