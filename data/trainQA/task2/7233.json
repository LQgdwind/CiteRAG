      "content": "Paper Title: MTAD: Tools and Benchmarks for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAnomaly detection on time series has been a hot topic and is widely studied.\nKey performance indicators (KPIs) used to monitor the runtime status of a system are one of the classic types of time series.\nIn the literature, there are two categories of scenarios. One scenario needs to conduct anomaly detection for individual KPI, which can be solved by univariate time series models efficiently .\nAnother scenario needs to consider the dependency among multiple KPIs to detect the anomalous status of the unified unit. Implicitly Modeling. The major challenge of multivariate anomaly detection comes from the effective modeling of complex temporal dependence and stochasticity of Multivariate KPIs.\nHundman et al. [ref]7 leveraged LSTM without expert-labeled telemetry anomaly data to detect anomalies in multivariate time-series metrics of spacecraft based on prediction errors.\nMalhotra et al.  proposed an LSTM-based encoder-decoder network to reconstruct the “normal” time series with high probabilities.\nAnother way to model normal patterns is to learn the distribution of input data like deep generative models [ref]36 and deep Bayesian network .\nDonut [ref]13 employed Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) to generate the normal hidden state of seasonal KPIs without expert-labeled data.\nDonut successfully detects anomalies in seasonal KPIs with various patterns and data quality, but enjoys high time complexity in the training phase.\nTo reduce the training complexity, DAGMM  simplifies the hidden state as a combination of several Gaussian distributions.\nUSAD  improves the autoencoder framework by incorporating adversarial samples to speed up the training phase.\nOmniAnomaly  employs a stochastic recurrent neural network to captures the normal patterns of multivariate time-series by simulating normal data distribution through stochastic latent variables.\nSimilar to Hundman et al. [ref]7’s approach, OmniAnomaly provides interpretations based on the reconstruction probabilities of its constituent univariate KPI.\nHowever, the generalization capability of these generative approaches with implicitly modeling is degraded when they encounter severe noise in temporal KPIs, which is very common in industrial production systems. Explicitly Modeling. To reduce the negative effect of noisy data in multivariate KPIs, the temporal dependencies such as the inter-correlations between different parts of KPIs should be captured in an explicit way.\nZhang et al.  proposed a convolutional recurrent encoder-decoder framework called MSCRED to characterize multiple levels of the normal states in different steps of KPIs.\nMSCRED utilizes a convolutional encoder and convolutional LSTM network to capture the KPI interactions and temporal patterns, respectively.\nZhao et al.  considered each univariate KPI as an individual feature to capture the complex dependencies of multivariate KPIs from temporal and feature perspective.\nTheir proposed method incorporates feature-oriented and time-oriented graph attention mechanisms to obtain mixed hidden representation from a combination of forecasting-based and reconstruction-based frameworks.\nHowever, the high time complexity in the overall framework and the carefully selected thresholds about the anomaly persist barriers of demanding industrial requirements for quick response and adjustment.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Implicitly Modeling. The major challenge of multivariate anomaly detection comes from the effective modeling of complex temporal dependence and stochasticity of Multivariate KPIs.\nHundman et al. [ref]7 leveraged LSTM without expert-labeled telemetry anomaly data to detect anomalies in multivariate time-series metrics of spacecraft based on prediction errors.\nMalhotra et al.  proposed an\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
