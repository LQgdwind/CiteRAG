To formalize, the propensity probability is well-calibrated if the propensity probability equals the correctness ratio of the available ratings .\nFor example, if the model predicts the propensity be 0.950.950.95, the ground-truth is expected to have 95%percent9595\\% of the ratings been available.\nThen, the miscalibration can be measured by the expected calibration error (ECE), the expectation of the coverage probability difference of the prediction intervals. In practice, we partition the range of the cumulative probability into n𝑛n bins with the same space and sum up the value of every bin via: where ξ𝜉\\xi and ξ^^𝜉\\hat{\\xi} are the expected confidence and the probability that the intervals covers the true data samples. As for the methodology, one effective way is Bayesian generative modeling and the representative models includes Bayesian neural networks, deep Gaussian processes, etc [ref]41 .\nThe Bayesian neural networks are generally computational expensive for training and some approximate methods are developed, such as MC-Dropout  and deep ensembles .\nAlternatively, the uncertainties can also be obtained from the calibration of the inaccurate uncertainties.\nSome methods uses the scaling and binning methods for calibration of both classification and regression methods   [ref]8 .\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: performance in various domains , such as computer vision, natural language processing, recommendation, etc, the predictions of deep learning models are revealed to be overconfident and miscalibrated [ref]8.\nOverconfident predictions may do harm to the accuracy, robustness and reliability of the deep learning model.\nTherefore, it is imperative to characterize the uncertainty of the deep learning\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
