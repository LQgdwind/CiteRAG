      "content": "Paper Title: Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde: The Strange Case of Off-Policy Policy Updates\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we study, under A1, the convergence properties of the sequence of value functions (qt)subscript𝑞𝑡(q_{t}) induced by the update rule defined in Eq. (3). We note that U​(θ,d)𝑈𝜃𝑑U(\\theta,d) is not a gradient in general. Our first theoretical result is the monotonicity of the value function sequence (qt)subscript𝑞𝑡(q_{t}). Under A1, the sequence of value functions qt≐qπtapproaches-limitsubscript𝑞𝑡subscript𝑞subscript𝜋𝑡q_{t}\\doteq q_{\\pi_{t}} and vt≐vπtapproaches-limitsubscript𝑣𝑡subscript𝑣subscript𝜋𝑡v_{t}\\doteq v_{\\pi_{t}} are monotonously increasing. By the monotonous convergence theorem, Thm. 1 directly implies the convergence of (qt)subscript𝑞𝑡(q_{t}): Under A1, the sequence of value functions qtsubscript𝑞𝑡q_{t} uniformly converges: q∞≐limt→∞qtapproaches-limitsubscript𝑞subscript→𝑡subscript𝑞𝑡q_{\\infty}\\doteq\\lim_{t\\to\\infty}q_{t}. In order to go further and prove convergence to a global optimal value, we need to enforce an additional condition. Indeed, the update U𝑈U relies multiplicatively on dtsubscript𝑑𝑡d_{t} which could be equal (or tend very fast) to 0 in some states, compromising the policy’s ability to reach the optimal value. This argument is not only theoretical, it has been observed by many that policy gradient can get stuck in suboptimal policies, even with entropy regularization. We designed our chain domain to exhibit such behaviour (see Section 4.1). Next, we show that (qt)subscript𝑞𝑡(q_{t}) converges to the optimal value function under some necessary and sufficient condition. Under A1, the following condition: C4. Each state s𝑠s is updated with weights that sum to infinity over time: ∑t=0∞ηt​dt​(s)=∞superscriptsubscript𝑡0subscript𝜂𝑡subscript𝑑𝑡𝑠\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\eta_{t}d_{t}(s)=\\infty, is necessary and sufficient to guarantee that the sequence of value functions (qt)subscript𝑞𝑡(q_{t}) converges to optimality: q∞=q⋆≐maxπ∈Π⁡qπsubscript𝑞subscript𝑞⋆approaches-limitsubscript𝜋Πsubscript𝑞𝜋q_{\\infty}=q_{\\star}\\doteq\\max_{\\pi\\in\\Pi}q_{\\pi}. In both direct and softmax parametrizations, we assume there exists a state-action pair (s,a)𝑠𝑎(s,a) advantageous with respect to the state value limits q∞subscript𝑞q_{\\infty} and v∞≐limt→∞vtapproaches-limitsubscript𝑣subscript→𝑡subscript𝑣𝑡v_{\\infty}\\doteq\\lim_{t\\to\\infty}v_{t}, that is: adv∞​(s,a)≐q∞​(s,a)−v∞​(s)>0approaches-limitsubscriptadv𝑠𝑎subscript𝑞𝑠𝑎subscript𝑣𝑠0\\text{adv}_{\\infty}(s,a)\\doteq q_{\\infty}(s,a)-v_{\\infty}(s)>0. We then prove that in this state s𝑠s, the policy improvement yielded by the update is lower bounded by a linear function of the update weight ηt​dt​(s)subscript𝜂𝑡subscript𝑑𝑡𝑠\\eta_{t}d_{t}(s). Both parametrizations require different proof techniques and are dealt with in different theorems. Summing over t𝑡t, we notice that this lower bounding sum diverges to infinity, which contradicts Corollary 1. We therefore infer that there cannot exist such a state-action pair, which allows us to conclude that no policy improvement is possible, and thus that the values are optimal: q∞=maxπ∈Π⁡qπsubscript𝑞subscript𝜋Πsubscript𝑞𝜋q_{\\infty}=\\max_{\\pi\\in\\Pi}q_{\\pi}. For the necessity of C4, we show that the parameter update is upper bounded in both parametrizations by a term linear in the action gap. By choosing the reward function adversarially, we may set it sufficiently small so that the sum of all the gradient steps is insufficient to reach optimality.\n∎ Thm. 2 is impactful along five dimensions. Practice of on-policy undiscounted updates:\\contourwhitePractice of on-policy undiscounted updates: As Thm. 2 is applicable to any distribution sequence, it allows us in particular to consider the practice of using on-policy undiscounted updates: dt≐dπt,1approaches-limitsubscript𝑑𝑡subscript𝑑subscript𝜋𝑡1d_{t}\\doteq d_{\\pi_{t},1}. Thus, it resolves a longstanding gap between the policy gradient theory and the actor-critic algorithm implementations 1  [ref]48 6  8 . This mismatch and its lack of theoretical grounding were identified in . Later,  proved that the practitioners’ undiscounted updates are not the gradient of any function and may be strongly biased under state aliasing. Recently,  studied the practical advantage of the undiscounted updates from a representation learning perspective. C4 encompasses both standard policy gradient and the undiscounted update rule: convergence to optimality of both is guaranteed as long as C4 is verified. Our analysis thus shows that the convergence properties of policy gradient and undiscounted updates require the same set of assumptions and conditions. Conversely, it is possible to prove convergence to sub-optimal policies of either when C4 is violated. In other words, Thm. 2 allows to reduce the study of specific algorithms to whether they verify C4. Experience replay and off-policy updates:\\contourwhiteExperience replay and off-policy updates: It also justifies the use of an experience replay for the actor, a trick also widely used in the literature to distributed the training over several agents    3 . Furthermore, while widely overlooked in the literature, we prove that off-policy updates have an even higher impact, since they are necessary to guarantee the convergence to optimality222Other papers proving convergence to optimality of policy gradient rely on A2, which implies C4.. We leverage this discovery to introduce new design principles and a novel algorithm in Section 3. Policy gradient theory:\\contourwhitePolicy gradient theory: Next, Thm. 2 generalizes previous optimality convergence results along two axes. The initial state distribution p0subscript𝑝0p_{0} is not required to cover the state space anymore (aka A2). A2 is unrealistic in most applications and cannot be enforced by an algorithm. Relaxing it is an important open problem , we disprove it in the full class of MDP. However, it might be possible to find a class of MDPs larger than the one verifying A2 where policy gradient also converges. Additionally, the condition on our learning rates is also much more flexible than C3. Density vs. policy regularization:\\contourwhiteDensity vs. policy regularization: In contrast, C4 can be controlled by a dedicated algorithm. This theoretical result promotes the principle of density-based regularization 0 , at the expense of policy-based regularization that cannot guarantee that C4 is satisfied and sometimes fails to plan over the whole state space (our chain domain experiments in Section 4 illustrate it well). Towards a generalized policy iteration theorem:\\contourwhiteTowards a generalized policy iteration theorem: Finally, by combining Thm. 2, which analyzes policy improvement, with a thorough theoretical analysis of the policy evaluation step (discussed in Section 3.1), we see a path towards results describing conditions on both components of generalized policy iteration that guarantee convergence to optimality. Furthermore, Thm. 2 gives sufficient conditions on the policy improvement step. The generalized policy iteration theorem was conjectured in  but never proved.\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: d_{\\pi_{t},1}.
