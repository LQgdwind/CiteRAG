      "content": "Paper Title: Black Box Model Explanations and the Human Interpretability Expectations - An Analysis in the Context of Homicide Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, technology has increasingly evolved and allowed intelligent algorithms to be present in our daily lives through solutions to the most diverse types of problems, thus further requiring that machine learning models solve increasingly complex problems requiring characteristics that justify their decision-making capabilities . Computational models based on bagging and boosting algorithms, because they provide high performance and high generalization capacity, are commonly used in computing to solve regression and classification problems based on tabular data. However, these models are not considered transparent algorithms111Transparent Algorithms: Algorithms that generate explanations for how a given output was produced. Examples: Decision Tree, Logistic Regression and K-nearest Neighbors [ref]7., being considered black box algorithms222Black Box Algorithms: Machine learning algorithms that have classification or regression decisions that are hidden from the user . and, therefore, are less used in problems related to sensitive contexts, such as health and safety [ref]58 . By observing the most recent literature on Explainable Artificial Intelligence - XAI , the use of black box algorithms in sensitive real-world contexts requires confidence (on the part of the human user) to be gained in the predictions of this type of algorithm. In this sense, different strategies have been developed on two knowledge fronts, namely: one aimed at generating greater explainability of the model itself; the other front with analyses concerning the interpretability of the explanations produced (interpretations made by a human user) [ref]7  . Black box model explanations are created through Model Agnostic analyses 333Model-Agnostic: meaning that it does not depend on the type of model to be explained ., also referred to as Model Inductions  or even Post-hoc Analysis [ref]7, since in this type of technique only the training data, test data, the model itself and its outputs are used for creating explanations. The limited understanding of black box models requires the search for methods and tools that can provide information about local explanations — aiming at predicting around an instance through various methods to obtain a local attribute importance ranking  — and global explanations — when it is possible to understand the rationale of all instances of the model by generating a global attribute importance ranking  — as a means of making interpretable, and thus more reliable, decisions . Efforts have been made in the Explainable Artificial Intelligence - XAI area regarding the development of different measures to explain black box models, even after their training and testing process [ref]7. Thus, measures such as Ciu , Dalex, Eli5, Lofo, Shap, and Skater have emerged to provide the creation of model-agnostic explanations. Each of these tools is capable of generating explanations using different techniques, but a fact they have in common is that they all generate global attribute importance rankings related to the explanation of a model. The explicabilities generated by each of the above-mentioned XAI measures, as seen in [ref]48, are ranks that can have greater similarity to one another, even if they stem from different XAI measures, in cases where the complexity of the model (dataset and algorithm) is lower; however, for models with higher complexities, these ranks can exhibit greater differences from one another, as seen in [ref]48, factors that undermine the confidence gain of the model’s end users. Seeking to minimize the problems presented so far, besides the development of XAI measures and studies on human interpretability, another initiative that has stood out and provided an interesting confidence gain in black box models is the inclusion of human interactions during the process of creating the explanations of the models    , as this secures the control of explanations as well as a greater scope thereof linked to interpretations of the context based on human and machine analysis. By that, given the context of homicide prediction and the various research fronts involving explainability, interpretability and human interactions in the black box opening process444Black box opening: Set of measures, strategies and processes used to make black box models explainable , the following questions arise: “Do the different XAI measures generate similar explanations for the proposed problem?”, “Are the interpretability expectations generated among different human experts similar?”,“Do the explanations generated by XAI measures meet the interpretability expectations of human experts?” and “Can Explanations and Expectations of Interpretability work together?”. By seeking to answer these questions, an experiment was developed that uses the machine learning model of homicide prediction advocated in , and from this, the 6 explicability rankings were generated by means of XAI metrics, as in [ref]48, and 6 ranks of interpretability expectations generated by different human experts. Then, comparisons and identification of existing relationships between all pairs and sets of ranks created were performed to find the desired answers. Finally, the generated ranks were combined into a single overall rank by means of a technique proposed hereby based on the results of the explanations of the XAI measures and interpretability expectations that were found. The main contributions of this research are as follows: To shed light on the discussion regarding the similarity of explanations generated by XAI measures and their interpretability, focusing on the specifics of the context-sensitive problem - predicting homicides - in order to measure whether the XAI measures explain the model as expected by human experts, even if to this end some of the results cannot be easily replicated for other regions and other contexts, given the level of the analyzed specificities of the context concerned. To propose the concept of Interpretability Expectation, which in general terms is the interpretability expected by an expert of a real-world problem based on their knowledge of the problem and the working principle of the machine learning model being analyzed, thus allowing this concept to be used and replicated by the XAI community in other contexts/problems. To describe how the results of the Interpretability Expectation can be combined with results of XAI measures, which are based on global attribute importance rankings, in order to build a Collaborative Explanation of the model using human expert knowledge and different XAI measures, i.e. human and machine. This technique may well be used in other contexts/problems. To show the overall methodology developed by this study as a deliverable, as it promotes data used, code developed, results collected, and the repositories created, in accordance with the Fair Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: transparent algorithms111Transparent Algorithms: Algorithms that generate explanations for how a given output was produced.
