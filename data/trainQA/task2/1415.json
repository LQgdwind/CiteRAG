      "content": "Paper Title: Skeleton-DML: Deep Metric Learning for Skeleton-Based One-Shot Action Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe encode skeleton sequences into an image representation. Fig. 2 shows the skeleton as contained in the NTU RGB+D 120 dataset. On a robotic system, these skeletons can be either directly extracted from the RGB-D camera  or from a camera image stream using a human-pose estimation approach .\nThe input in our case is a skeleton sequence matrix S∈ℝN×M⁣×⁣×3𝑆superscriptℝ𝑁𝑀absent3\\mathit{S}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times M\\times\\times 3} where each row vector represents a discrete joint sequence (for N𝑁N joints) and each column vector represents a sample of all joint positions at one specific time step of a sequence length M𝑀M. The matrix is transformed to an RGB image I∈{0,…,255}H×W×3𝐼superscript0…255𝐻𝑊3\\mathit{I}\\in\\{0,\\ldots,255\\}^{H\\times W\\times 3}. Note, in contrast to [ref]18 [ref]3 the joint space is not projected to the color channels but unfolded per axis separately like depicted in Fig. 3, and Fig. 4.\nThis results in a dataset 𝒟={(Ii,yi)}i=1K𝒟superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝐼𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖𝑖1𝐾\\mathcal{D}=\\{(\\mathit{I}_{i},y_{i})\\}_{i=1}^{K} of K𝐾K training images I1,…,Ksubscript𝐼1…𝐾\\mathit{I}_{1,\\dots,K} with labels yi∈{1,…,C}subscript𝑦𝑖1…𝐶y_{i}\\in\\{1,\\dots,C\\}.\nIn contrast to the representations used for multimodal action recognition  or skeleton based action recognition 8  the proposed representation is more compact. In comparison to [ref]3 [ref]18 our representation separates the joint values for all axes as blocks over the width, keeping all joint values grouped locally together per axis.\nIn [ref]18 the color channels are used to unfold the joint values. As the skeleton-sequence is represented as an image, the model needs to be applied only to a single image for inference.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: one specific time step of a sequence length M𝑀M.

Note, in contrast to [ref]18 [ref]3 the joint space is not projected to the color channels but unfolded per axis separately like depicted in Fig. 3, and Fig. 4.\nThis results in a dataset\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
