      "content": "Paper Title: Optimizing Explanations by Network Canonization and Hyperparameter Search\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nXAI methods can broadly be categorized into local and global explanations.\nWhile local explainers focus on explaining the model decisions on specific inputs, global explanation methods aim to explain the model behavior in general, e.g., by visualizing learned representations.\nFor image classification tasks, local XAI methods assign relevance scores to each input unit, expressing how influential that unit (e.g., an input pixel) has been for the inference process.\nMany XAI methods are (modified) backpropagation approaches.\nTo compute the importance of features in the detection of a certain class\n, they start from the output of the network, backpropagating importance values layer by layer, depending on the parameters and/or hidden activations of each layer.\nSaliency maps [ref]39 [ref]6 [ref]29\nare generated by computing the gradient ∂f​(x)∂x𝑓xx\\frac{\\partial f(\\textbf{x})}{\\partial\\textbf{x}}, where f​(x)𝑓xf(\\textbf{x}) is the model’s prediction for an input sample x. This yields a feature map where each value indicates the model’s sensitivity towards the corresponding feature.\nGuided Backpropagation  also uses the gradients, but applies the ReLU function to computed gradients in ReLU activation layers in the backpropagation pass.\nThis filters out the flow of negative information, allowing to focus on the parts of the image where the desired class is detected.\nIntegrated Gradients  accumulates the activation gradients on a straight path in the input space, starting from a baseline image x′superscriptx′\\textbf{x}^{\\prime} selected beforehand, to the datapoint of interest. Formally, the attribution to the ithsuperscript𝑖thi^{\\text{th}} feature is given by (xi−xi′)​∫ρ=01∂f​(x+ρ​(x′−x))∂xi​𝑑ρsubscript𝑥𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝑥′𝑖superscriptsubscript𝜌01𝑓x𝜌superscriptx′xsubscript𝑥𝑖differential-d𝜌(x_{i}-x^{\\prime}_{i})\\int_{\\rho=0}^{1}\\frac{\\partial f(\\textbf{x}+\\rho(\\textbf{x}^{\\prime}-\\textbf{x}))}{\\partial x_{i}}d\\rho.\nSmoothGrad  aims to reduce the noise in saliency maps by sampling datapoints in the neighborhood of the original datapoint, and taking the average saliency map.\nSince these XAI methods rely only on the gradients of the total function computed by the network, they are implementation invariant, meaning they produce the same explanations for different implementations of the same function. LRP  operates by redistributing the relevance scores of neurons backwards up to the input features.\nMore precisely, LRP distributes the activation of the output neuron of interest to the previous layers in a way that preserves relevance across layers.\nSeveral rules have been defined (e.g., LRP-ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon, LRP-γ𝛾\\gamma, LRP-α​β𝛼𝛽\\alpha\\beta), which can be combined in meaningful configurations according to the types and positions of layers in the neural network.\nExcitation Backprop 0 is a backpropagation method that is equivalent to LRP-α​1​β​0𝛼1𝛽0\\alpha 1\\beta 0 , which has a probabilistic interpretation. DeepLIFT  is another rule-based method, where a reference image (e.g., the mean over the training population) is selected in addition. Using the associated rules, the differences in the activations of neurons on the reference image and the target image are backpropagated to the input.\nIn addition to backpropagation-based XAI methods there are also other approaches.\nProminent examples are SHAP , which uses the game theoretic concept of Shapley values to find the contribution of each input feature to the model output, and LIME , which fits an interpretable model to the original model output around the given input.\nBoth methods treat the model as a black box, only using outputs for certain inputs. As such, they are also implementation independent.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: of a certain class\n, they start from the output of the network, backpropagating importance values layer by layer, depending on the parameters and/or hidden activations of each layer.\nSaliency maps [ref]39 [ref]6 [ref]29\nare generated by computing the gradient ∂f​(x)∂x𝑓xx\\frac{\\partial f(\\textbf{x})}{\\partial\\textbf{x}}, where f​(x)𝑓xf(\\textbf{x}) is the model’s prediction for an input sample\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
