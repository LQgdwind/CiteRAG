      "content": "Paper Title: Hierarchical Video-Moment Retrieval and Step-Captioning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEncouraged by the easy access to smartphones, recording software, and video hosting platforms, people are increasingly accumulating videos of all kinds.\nTo fuel the subsequent growing interest in using machine learning systems to extract and summarize important information\nfrom these large video corpora based on text queries,\nprogress has been made in\nvideo retrieval¬†[ref]41 [ref]42 [ref]17  ,\nmoment retrieval¬† [ref]17 ,\nvideo summarization¬†   4, and\nvideo captioning¬†[ref]41 [ref]42  0.\nPrevious works have generally focused on solving these tasks independently; however, all these tasks share the common goal of retrieving information from a video corpus, at different levels of scales and via different modalities.\nHence, in this work, we introduce a new hierarchical benchmark that combines all four tasks to enable novel and useful real-world applications.\nFor example,\na text-based search service that finds a relevant video from a large video corpus, extracts the most relevant moment from that video, segments the moment into important steps, and captions them for easy indexing and retrieval.\nTo support this, we introduce HiREST, a hierarchical instructional video dataset for a holistic benchmark of information retrieval from a video corpus\n(see Sec.¬†3).\nHiREST consists of four annotations:\n1) 3.4‚ÄãK3.4ùêæ3.4K pairs of text query about open-domain instructions (e.g., ‚Äòhow to make glow in the dark slime‚Äô) and videos,\n2) relevant moment timestamps inside the 1.1‚ÄãK1.1ùêæ1.1K videos, where only a part of the video (<75%absentpercent75<75\\%) is relevant to the text query,\n3) moment breakdown in several instructional steps with timestamps (7.67.67.6 steps per video, total 8.6‚ÄãK8.6ùêæ8.6K steps),\nand,\n4) an manually curated English caption for each step (e.g. ‚Äòpour shampoo in container‚Äô).\nWe collect fine-grained step-wise annotations of HiREST in a two-step annotation process with online crowdworkers on instructional text-video pairs from the HowTo100M¬†3 dataset (see Sec.¬†3.1).\nThe instructional videos often come with clear step-by-step instructions, allowing fine-grained segmentation of the videos into short steps.\nWhile there are existing video datasets with step annotations, they are based on a small number of predefined task names¬†  (thus step captions are not diverse), or are limited to a single topic (e.g. cooking¬†).\nHiREST covers various domains and provides diverse step captions with timestamps written by human annotators (see Table¬†1), presenting new challenging and realistic benchmarks for hierarchical video information retrieval. Using the HiREST dataset, we benchmark four tasks:\n1) video retrieval,\n2) moment retrieval,\n3) moment segmentation,\nand\n4) step captioning (see Fig.¬†1 and Sec.¬†3.3).\nIn the video retrieval task, models have to identify a video that is most relevant to a given text query.\nIn the moment retrieval task, models have to select the relevant span of the video, by trimming the parts irrelevant to the text query (blue boundary in Fig.¬†1).\nIn the moment segmentation task, models have to break down the relevant portion into several instructional steps and identify the start-end boundaries of each step\n(green boundaries in Fig.¬†1).\nFinally, in the step captioning task, models have to generate step captions (e.g. ‚Äòspray the warm water on carpet‚Äô) of the instructional steps.\nTo provide good starting points to the community for our new task hierarchy, we show the performance of recent baseline models on HiREST. For baselines, we use strong models including\nCLIP¬†7,\nEVA-CLIP¬†,\nFrozen-in-Time,\nBMT¬†, and SwinBERT¬†0.\nOn all four tasks, we find that finetuning models on HiREST improve performance; however, there exists a large room to improve performance. We summarize our contributions in this paper:\n1) We present HiREST dataset and propose a new benchmark that covers hierarchy in information retrieval and visual/textual summarization from an instructional video corpus.\n2) Unlike existing video datasets with step captions based on predefined task names or limited to a single topic, our HiREST provides diverse, high-quality step captions with timestamps written by human annotators.\n3) We provide a joint baseline model that can perform moment retrieval,\nmoment segmentation,\nand\nstep captioning with a single architecture.\n4) We provide comprehensive dataset analyses and show experiments with baseline models for each task, where there is a large room to improve model performance.\nWe hope that HiREST can foster future work on end-to-end systems for holistic information retrieval and summarization on large video corpus.\nIn addition,\nour manually annotated step captions can also be a good source for training and testing the step-by-step reasoning of large multimodal language models¬† .\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: growing interest in using machine learning systems to extract and summarize important information\nfrom these large video corpora based on text queries,\nprogress has been made in\nvideo retrieval¬†[ref]41 [ref]42 [ref]17  ,\nmoment retrieval¬† [ref]17 ,\nvideo summarization¬†   4, and\nvideo captioning¬†[ref]41 [ref]42  0.\nPrevious works have generally focused on solving these tasks independently;\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
