      "content": "Paper Title: Quantum algorithms to simulate quadratic classical Hamiltonians and optimal control\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we present our quantum algorithms to solve the problem of preparing the final state after classical evolution and also to estimate the kinetic energy as described in Problem 1. In this approach, we essentially solve the differential equation coming from Hamilton’s canonical equations in (2.45), namely an equation of the type using the quantum ODE solver recently developed in [ref]25. Specifically, we have the following result. There exists a quantum algorithm that solves Problem 1 of preparing a quantum state given oracle access to M𝑀M, V𝑉V, R𝑅R and an oracle to prepare a normalized version of f𝑓f. Let d𝑑d be the dimension of these matrices and s𝑠s be the sparsity. Let The query complexity of this algorithm is given by and gate complexity TGsubscript𝑇𝐺T_{G} is greater by a factor of at most where where x​(t)𝑥𝑡x(t) is the solution at time t𝑡t, T𝑇T is the final time and The query complexity of estimating the kinetic energy is with the gate complexity greater by a fraction of at most poly⁡(log⁡1/ϵ,log⁡T​‖A‖,k)poly1italic-ϵ𝑇norm𝐴𝑘\\operatorname{poly}(\\log 1/\\epsilon,\\log T\\|A\\|,k). Using the result from [ref]25, we can obtain a quantum state |ψ⟩ket𝜓\\ket{\\psi} that is close to the solution of the equation such that ‖|ψ⟩−x​(T)/‖x​(T)‖‖≤ϵnormket𝜓𝑥𝑇norm𝑥𝑇italic-ϵ\\|\\ket{\\psi}-x(T)/\\|x(T)\\|\\|\\leq\\epsilon. To do so, we need a block encoding of A𝐴A and an oracle to prepare the normalized version of b𝑏b and the normalized initial state. A block-encoding of A𝐴A can implemented by first block-encoding the sparse matrices and then adding the two block-encoded unitaries. The initial state x​(0)𝑥0x(0) in this basis can be prepared easily using oracles to prepare q​(0)𝑞0q(0) and q˙​(0)˙𝑞0\\dot{q}(0) as normalized states similar to the description in [ref]25. The oracle to prepare b𝑏b can be done using the method described in . Recall that The method in  which uses inequality testing from  can construct an oracle for b𝑏b with error ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon with O​(‖M−1‖​polylog⁡(d,1/ϵ))𝑂normsuperscript𝑀1polylog𝑑1italic-ϵO(\\sqrt{\\|M^{-1}\\|}\\operatorname{polylog}(d,1/\\epsilon)) queries to the oracle for f𝑓f. Using this, the final state |ψ⟩ket𝜓\\ket{\\psi} can be obtained with query complexity where and Next, we estimate C​(A)𝐶𝐴C(A) in terms of the norms of M𝑀M, R𝑅R, V𝑉V and f𝑓f. First, as a special case, we consider the case when R=0𝑅0R=0. In this case, for the classical mechanical system, we have from (2.29) that The complexity of the algorithm depends on C​(A)𝐶𝐴C(A), which we now estimate. We have where Therefore, we have This means Taking norms and using the fact that Q​J​Q𝑄𝐽𝑄\\sqrt{Q}J\\sqrt{Q} is an anti-Hermitian operator (as discussed in Section 2.2), we get where in the above equation, we used the fact that the exponential of Q​J​Q𝑄𝐽𝑄\\sqrt{Q}J\\sqrt{Q} has unit norm and where κ​(Q​IM)𝜅𝑄subscript𝐼𝑀\\kappa(\\sqrt{Q}I_{M}) is the condition number of Q​IM𝑄subscript𝐼𝑀\\sqrt{Q}I_{M}. Finally, we have In this case, we have that To bound C​(A)𝐶𝐴C(A) in this case, first we split A𝐴A as follows The first term inside the square brackets is just J​Q𝐽𝑄JQ and let us denote the second term A2subscript𝐴2A_{2}. Suppose we conjugate A2subscript𝐴2A_{2} by Q1/2superscript𝑄12Q^{1/2}, we get Let and similarly conjugating J​Q𝐽𝑄JQ, we get Using this, we can see that Therefore Hence Now a result from  states that for any matrix B𝐵B Letting B=AR+AI𝐵subscript𝐴𝑅subscript𝐴𝐼B=A_{R}+A_{I}, we get (B+B†)/2=AR𝐵superscript𝐵†2subscript𝐴𝑅(B+B^{\\dagger})/2=A_{R} (because AIsubscript𝐴𝐼A_{I} is anti-Hermitian). Therefore, we have Since we assume that R𝑅R is a positive matrix, we have M−1​R​M−1superscript𝑀1𝑅superscript𝑀1M^{-1}RM^{-1} is positive and hence ARsubscript𝐴𝑅A_{R} is negative. This means ‖exp⁡(AR​t)‖≤1normsubscript𝐴𝑅𝑡1\\|\\exp(A_{R}t)\\|\\leq 1. Therefore, From the block structure of A𝐴A, we can bound ‖A‖norm𝐴\\|A\\| as follows. We have We can assume block structure for v𝑣v as v=(v1,v2)T𝑣superscriptsubscript𝑣1subscript𝑣2𝑇v=(v_{1},v_{2})^{T} such that ‖v1‖2+‖v2‖2=1superscriptnormsubscript𝑣12superscriptnormsubscript𝑣221\\|v_{1}\\|^{2}+\\|v_{2}\\|^{2}=1. We now have We also have ‖v1+v2‖2≤2​(‖v1‖2+‖v2‖2)superscriptnormsubscript𝑣1subscript𝑣222superscriptnormsubscript𝑣12superscriptnormsubscript𝑣22\\|v_{1}+v_{2}\\|^{2}\\leq 2(\\|v_{1}\\|^{2}+\\|v_{2}\\|^{2}). Using this, we can see that The kinetic energy of the system at a given time is defined as To estimate the kinetic energy of the final state, we need to use the so called history state which is the quantum state produced by the algorithm (from which we can get the normalized solution state by measuring the time register). Here we will not measure the time register, but perform a Hadamard test on the history state. This state can be written as where Nψsubscript𝑁𝜓N_{\\psi} is the normalization and m=T​‖A‖𝑚𝑇norm𝐴m=T\\|A\\| denotes the number of time steps needed to obtain an accurate solution (to within an additive error). Using Theorem 2, we can estimate the norm of the above state to some multiplicative error γ𝛾\\gamma i.e., there exists a quantum algorithm that produces N^ψsubscript^𝑁𝜓\\hat{N}_{\\psi} such that We can now measure the state |ψ⟩ket𝜓\\ket{\\psi} using the following procedure. We first block-encode as UMsubscript𝑈𝑀U_{M}, the matrix Then we need to estimate the inner product by estimating the inner product where q˙^^˙𝑞\\hat{\\dot{q}} is the velocity obtained from the numerical solution and ‖M‖norm𝑀\\|M\\| is the sub-normalization in the block-encoding. In other words, the inner product is a scaled version of the kinetic energy. We can now use the estimate of the norm to get the kinetic energy K^=‖M‖​N^ψ2​⟨ψ|​UM​|ψ⟩^𝐾norm𝑀superscriptsubscript^𝑁𝜓2bra𝜓subscript𝑈𝑀ket𝜓\\hat{K}=\\|M\\|\\hat{N}_{\\psi}^{2}\\bra{\\psi}U_{M}\\ket{\\psi}. The total error in this estimate is This can be written as Using (4.40), we have N^ψ≤(1+γ)​Nψsubscript^𝑁𝜓1𝛾subscript𝑁𝜓\\hat{N}_{\\psi}\\leq(1+\\gamma)N_{\\psi} and this means Therefore, Now let us focus on the difference of inner products in the first term. This can be written as where mmaxsubscript𝑚m_{\\max} is the maximum value of the diagonal matrix of masses M𝑀M. Using Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, we can write this as where ∥⋅∥\\|\\cdot\\| is the ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2} norm. Using the fact that for some ϵ1subscriptitalic-ϵ1\\epsilon_{1} we get Putting it together and choosing γ𝛾\\gamma such that γ=ϵ1=ϵ/8𝛾subscriptitalic-ϵ1italic-ϵ8\\gamma=\\epsilon_{1}=\\epsilon/8, we get where The gate complexity of kinetic energy estimation follows from the complexity of preparation of the state |ψ⟩ket𝜓\\ket{\\psi}, norm estimation of Nψsubscript𝑁𝜓N_{\\psi}, block encoding UMsubscript𝑈𝑀U_{M} and the Hadamard test.\n∎ The run-time for the case with zero damping i.e., when R=0𝑅0R=0, depends on the condition number of the matrix Q𝑄\\sqrt{Q}. The fact that for the encoding used here, the run-time scales as the inverse of the smallest eigenvalue is already pointed out in , where it was argued that it is at least linear. Here we show that it is no more than linear (up to log factors). It is interesting to note that the problem shown to be 𝖡𝖰𝖯𝖡𝖰𝖯{\\mathsf{BQP}} complete in  also has a constant condition number for Q𝑄\\sqrt{Q} and hence the above algorithm and encoding would be efficient for this case. It is also worth noting that the run-time of the quantum algorithm from [ref]25 for the linear differential equation (4.9) is dependent on the norm of the exponential of A𝐴A (denoted C​(A)𝐶𝐴C(A) here) and does not require A𝐴A to have a negative log-norm. Next we give a result that improves the above kinetic energy estimation by giving a multiplicative or relative approximation to the kinetic energy if there is no source term i.e., b=0𝑏0b=0. If b=0𝑏0b=0 in (4.9), then there exists a quantum algorithm that outputs an estimate K^^𝐾\\hat{K} for the kinetic energy such that where K𝐾K is the actual kinetic energy. From (4.47) in the proof of the b≠0𝑏0b\\neq 0 case, we have that the estimate K^^𝐾\\hat{K} satisfies We show in Lemma 13 in Appendix A that for any i𝑖i for some constant ϵ1subscriptitalic-ϵ1\\epsilon_{1}. Using this, we get which gives By choosing γ=ϵ1=ϵ/16𝛾subscriptitalic-ϵ1italic-ϵ16\\gamma=\\epsilon_{1}=\\epsilon/16, we get ∎\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: this approach, we essentially solve the differential equation coming from Hamilton’s canonical equations in (2.45), namely an equation of the type using the quantum ODE solver recently developed in [ref]25.
