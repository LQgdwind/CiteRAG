CL poses several challenges for both theory and practice, such as how to measure and mitigate forgetting, how to transfer and generalize knowledge across tasks, and how to balance stability and plasticity of the learning system. A common approach of CL is to use regularization techniques that constrain the model parameters to prevent catastrophic forgetting, such as elastic weight consolidation (EWC) [ref]24, synaptic intelligence (SI) , or learning without forgetting (LwF) . Another approach is to use replay techniques that augment the current data with previous tasks. Most notable method is class incremental learner iCaRL . iCaRL stores a subset of exemplars per class, selected to best approximate the class means in the learned feature space. Gradient episodic memory (GEM)  proposes to project the gradient direction of the current task on the feasible region outlined by previous tasks. Thus, the new task updates do not interfere with previous tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: Continual Learning (CL) [ref]34, also called life-long learning [ref]35 or incremental learning , is a learning technique that aims to enable a machine learning model to learn from a stream of data without forgetting the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
