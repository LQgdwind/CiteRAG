A preliminary version of this paper will appear in Proceedings of the 37th International Symposium on Computational Geometry (SoCG 2021).\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLet u​v¯¯𝑢𝑣\\overline{uv} be the edge of π​(s′,r′)𝜋superscript𝑠′superscript𝑟′\\pi(s^{\\prime},r^{\\prime}) containing c𝑐c such that d​(s,u)<d​(s,v)𝑑𝑠𝑢𝑑𝑠𝑣d(s,u)<d(s,v). It possible that u𝑢u is s𝑠s or/and v𝑣v is t𝑡t. We first assume that both u𝑢u and v𝑣v are polygon vertices; we will show later the other case can be reduced to this case.\nOur algorithm relies on the following lemma (e.g., see Fig. 5). α𝛼\\alpha must be in the geodesic triangle △​(s,r,β​(s,t))△𝑠𝑟𝛽𝑠𝑡\\triangle(s,r,\\beta(s,t)). The apexes of △​(s,r,β​(s,t))△𝑠𝑟𝛽𝑠𝑡\\triangle(s,r,\\beta(s,t)) are u′superscript𝑢′u^{\\prime}, v′superscript𝑣′v^{\\prime}, and β​(s,t)𝛽𝑠𝑡\\beta(s,t), where u′superscript𝑢′u^{\\prime} (resp., v′superscript𝑣′v^{\\prime}) is the junction vertex of and π​(s,r)𝜋𝑠𝑟\\pi(s,r) and π​(s,β​(s,t))𝜋𝑠𝛽𝑠𝑡\\pi(s,\\beta(s,t)) (resp., π​(r,β​(s,t))𝜋𝑟𝛽𝑠𝑡\\pi(r,\\beta(s,t))) (in Fig. 5, u′=usuperscript𝑢′𝑢u^{\\prime}=u and v′=vsuperscript𝑣′𝑣v^{\\prime}=v). pssubscript𝑝𝑠p_{s} must be on the pseudo-convex chain π​(u′,β​(s,t))∪π​(u′,v′)𝜋superscript𝑢′𝛽𝑠𝑡𝜋superscript𝑢′superscript𝑣′\\pi(u^{\\prime},\\beta(s,t))\\cup\\pi(u^{\\prime},v^{\\prime}) and α​ps¯¯𝛼subscript𝑝𝑠\\overline{\\alpha p_{s}} is\ntangent to the chain. prsubscript𝑝𝑟p_{r} must be on the pseudo-convex chain π​(v′,β​(s,t))∪π​(v′,u′)𝜋superscript𝑣′𝛽𝑠𝑡𝜋superscript𝑣′superscript𝑢′\\pi(v^{\\prime},\\beta(s,t))\\cup\\pi(v^{\\prime},u^{\\prime}) and α​pr¯¯𝛼subscript𝑝𝑟\\overline{\\alpha p_{r}} is tangent to the chain. ptsubscript𝑝𝑡p_{t} must be on the pseudo-convex chain π​(tu​v,u)∪π​(tu​v,v)𝜋subscript𝑡𝑢𝑣𝑢𝜋subscript𝑡𝑢𝑣𝑣\\pi(t_{uv},u)\\cup\\pi(t_{uv},v) and α​pt¯¯𝛼subscript𝑝𝑡\\overline{\\alpha p_{t}} is\ntangent to the chain, where tu​vsubscript𝑡𝑢𝑣t_{uv} is the junction vertex of π​(t,u)𝜋𝑡𝑢\\pi(t,u) and π​(t,v)𝜋𝑡𝑣\\pi(t,v). α​pt¯¯𝛼subscript𝑝𝑡\\overline{\\alpha p_{t}} intersects u​v¯¯𝑢𝑣\\overline{uv}. Proof:\nAs both u𝑢u and v𝑣v are polygon vertices, u​v¯¯𝑢𝑣\\overline{uv} divides P𝑃P into two sub-polygons; one of them, denoted by P1subscript𝑃1P_{1}, does not contain t𝑡t and we use P2subscript𝑃2P_{2} to denote the other one. Oh and Ahn  claimed without proof (in the proof of Lemma 3.6 ) that α𝛼\\alpha is in P1subscript𝑃1P_{1}. We provide a brief proof below. Assume to the contrary that α𝛼\\alpha is not in P1subscript𝑃1P_{1}. Then, α∈P2𝛼subscript𝑃2\\alpha\\in P_{2}. Since B​(s,r)𝐵𝑠𝑟B(s,r) intersects π​(s,r)𝜋𝑠𝑟\\pi(s,r) only once at c∈u​v¯⊆π​(s,r)𝑐¯𝑢𝑣𝜋𝑠𝑟c\\in\\overline{uv}\\subseteq\\pi(s,r), B​(s,r)𝐵𝑠𝑟B(s,r) is partitioned into two portions by c𝑐c, one in P1subscript𝑃1P_{1} and the other in P2subscript𝑃2P_{2}; let B2​(s,r)subscript𝐵2𝑠𝑟B_{2}(s,r) denote the portion in P2subscript𝑃2P_{2}, which has c𝑐c as one of its endpoint. As α𝛼\\alpha is equidistant from s𝑠s, t𝑡t, and r𝑟r, α𝛼\\alpha is on B​(s,t)𝐵𝑠𝑡B(s,t). Since α∈P2𝛼subscript𝑃2\\alpha\\in P_{2}, we obtain that α∈B2​(s,r)𝛼subscript𝐵2𝑠𝑟\\alpha\\in B_{2}(s,r). As α𝛼\\alpha is not c𝑐c, which is the geodesic center of s𝑠s, t𝑡t, and r𝑟r, α𝛼\\alpha cannot be in the geodesic triangle △​(s,t,r)△𝑠𝑡𝑟\\triangle(s,t,r). Therefore, if we move on B2​(s,r)subscript𝐵2𝑠𝑟B_{2}(s,r) from c𝑐c to its other endpoint, we will first enter △​(s,t,r)△𝑠𝑡𝑟\\triangle(s,t,r) and then encounter either π​(s′,t′)𝜋superscript𝑠′superscript𝑡′\\pi(s^{\\prime},t^{\\prime}) or π​(t′,r′)𝜋superscript𝑡′superscript𝑟′\\pi(t^{\\prime},r^{\\prime}) before we encounter α𝛼\\alpha. Without loss of generality, we assume that we encounter π​(s′,t′)𝜋superscript𝑠′superscript𝑡′\\pi(s^{\\prime},t^{\\prime}). We assume that s𝑠s, t𝑡t, r𝑟r are ordered counterclockwise around the boundary of their geodesic hull (e.g., see Fig. 5).\nConsider the farthest Voronoi diagram F​V​D​(s,t,r)𝐹𝑉𝐷𝑠𝑡𝑟\\mbox{$F\\!V\\!D$}(s,t,r) of the three sites s,t,r𝑠𝑡𝑟s,t,r only (without considering other sites of S𝑆S). Let C​(p)𝐶𝑝C(p) be the cell of p∈{s,t,r}𝑝𝑠𝑡𝑟p\\in\\{s,t,r\\} in the diagram.\nAs d​(c,s)=d​(c,r)>d​(c,t)𝑑𝑐𝑠𝑑𝑐𝑟𝑑𝑐𝑡d(c,s)=d(c,r)>d(c,t), c𝑐c belongs to the common boundary of C​(s)𝐶𝑠C(s) and C​(r)𝐶𝑟C(r), i.e., c𝑐c is on an edge of F​V​D​(s,t,r)𝐹𝑉𝐷𝑠𝑡𝑟\\mbox{$F\\!V\\!D$}(s,t,r). The point α𝛼\\alpha divides B​(s,r)𝐵𝑠𝑟B(s,r) into two portions, one of which contains c𝑐c. The above implies that the portion of B​(s,r)𝐵𝑠𝑟B(s,r) containing c𝑐c is an edge of F​V​D​(s,t,r)𝐹𝑉𝐷𝑠𝑡𝑟\\mbox{$F\\!V\\!D$}(s,t,r) (e.g., see Fig. 6). That edge partitions △​(s,t,r)△𝑠𝑡𝑟\\triangle(s,t,r) into two sides; one side contains s′superscript𝑠′s^{\\prime} and the other contains r′superscript𝑟′r^{\\prime}. It is not difficult to see that the side containing s′superscript𝑠′s^{\\prime} belongs to C​(r)𝐶𝑟C(r) while the other side belongs to C​(s)𝐶𝑠C(s).\nThen, one can verify that the three cells C​(s)𝐶𝑠C(s), C​(t)𝐶𝑡C(t), and C​(r)𝐶𝑟C(r) in F​V​D​(s,t,r)𝐹𝑉𝐷𝑠𝑡𝑟\\mbox{$F\\!V\\!D$}(s,t,r) are ordered clockwise along the boundary of P𝑃P (e.g., see Fig. 6). According to Aronov , s𝑠s, t𝑡t, and r𝑟r should also be ordered clockwise around the boundary of their geodesic hull. But this contradicts with the fact that s𝑠s, t𝑡t, and r𝑟r are ordered counterclockwise around the boundary of their geodesic hull. The above proves that α𝛼\\alpha is in P1subscript𝑃1P_{1}. Oh and Ahn  showed that\nα​pt¯¯𝛼subscript𝑝𝑡\\overline{\\alpha p_{t}} intersects u​v¯¯𝑢𝑣\\overline{uv}. The main proof idea is that if this were not the case, then a vertex of P𝑃P would be on a bisector of two of the three sites s𝑠s, t𝑡t, and r𝑟r, contradicting with the general position assumption (see the proof of Lemma 3.6  for the detailed analysis). This leads to the lemma statement (6), which further implies the lemma statement (5). To simplify the notation, let q=β​(s,t)𝑞𝛽𝑠𝑡q=\\beta(s,t). By definition, q𝑞q is on the bisector B​(s,t)𝐵𝑠𝑡B(s,t). As α𝛼\\alpha is equidistant from s𝑠s, t𝑡t, and r𝑟r, α𝛼\\alpha is also on B​(s,t)𝐵𝑠𝑡B(s,t). Let ps​tsubscript𝑝𝑠𝑡p_{st} be the middle point of π​(s,t)𝜋𝑠𝑡\\pi(s,t). Hence, ps​t∈B​(s,t)subscript𝑝𝑠𝑡𝐵𝑠𝑡p_{st}\\in B(s,t). We claim that α𝛼\\alpha must be on B​(s,t)𝐵𝑠𝑡B(s,t) between ps​tsubscript𝑝𝑠𝑡p_{st} and q𝑞q (e.g., see Fig. 7). Indeed, notice that ps​tsubscript𝑝𝑠𝑡p_{st} is the point on B​(s,t)𝐵𝑠𝑡B(s,t) closest to t𝑡t and if we move a point p𝑝p from one end of B​(s,t)𝐵𝑠𝑡B(s,t) to the other end, d​(t,p)𝑑𝑡𝑝d(t,p) will first monotonically decrease until ps​tsubscript𝑝𝑠𝑡p_{st} and then monotonically increase. By Observation 2, if we move a point p𝑝p along B​(s,t)𝐵𝑠𝑡B(s,t) from q𝑞q to α𝛼\\alpha, d​(t,p)𝑑𝑡𝑝d(t,p) will monotonically decrease. As such, α𝛼\\alpha must be on B​(s,t)𝐵𝑠𝑡B(s,t) between ps​tsubscript𝑝𝑠𝑡p_{st} and q𝑞q. We next argue that q∈P1𝑞subscript𝑃1q\\in P_{1}. Depending on whether B​(s,t)𝐵𝑠𝑡B(s,t) intersects u​v¯¯𝑢𝑣\\overline{uv}, there are two cases.\nIf B​(s,t)𝐵𝑠𝑡B(s,t) does not intersect u​v¯¯𝑢𝑣\\overline{uv}, then as α∈B​(s,t)𝛼𝐵𝑠𝑡\\alpha\\in B(s,t) and α∈P1𝛼subscript𝑃1\\alpha\\in P_{1}, B​(s,t)𝐵𝑠𝑡B(s,t) is in P1subscript𝑃1P_{1}. Since q∈B​(s,t)𝑞𝐵𝑠𝑡q\\in B(s,t), q∈P1𝑞subscript𝑃1q\\in P_{1} holds.\nIf B​(s,t)𝐵𝑠𝑡B(s,t) intersects u​v¯¯𝑢𝑣\\overline{uv}, then since u​v¯⊆π​(s,r)¯𝑢𝑣𝜋𝑠𝑟\\overline{uv}\\subseteq\\pi(s,r), by Observation 3, B​(s,t)𝐵𝑠𝑡B(s,t) intersects u​v¯¯𝑢𝑣\\overline{uv} at a single point, denoted by qs​tsubscript𝑞𝑠𝑡q_{st} (e.g., see Fig. 7). To prove q∈P1𝑞subscript𝑃1q\\in P_{1}, since α∈P1𝛼subscript𝑃1\\alpha\\in P_{1} and α𝛼\\alpha is on B​(s,t)𝐵𝑠𝑡B(s,t) between q𝑞q and ps​tsubscript𝑝𝑠𝑡p_{st}, it suffices to show that ps​t∈P2subscript𝑝𝑠𝑡subscript𝑃2p_{st}\\in P_{2}. Indeed, since B​(s,t)𝐵𝑠𝑡B(s,t) intersects u​v¯¯𝑢𝑣\\overline{uv} at qs​tsubscript𝑞𝑠𝑡q_{st} and u​v¯⊆π​(s,r)¯𝑢𝑣𝜋𝑠𝑟\\overline{uv}\\subseteq\\pi(s,r), by Observation 3, B​(s,t)𝐵𝑠𝑡B(s,t) does not intersect any other point of π​(s,r)𝜋𝑠𝑟\\pi(s,r). Hence, B​(s,t)𝐵𝑠𝑡B(s,t) does not intersect π​(s,s′)∖{s′}𝜋𝑠superscript𝑠′superscript𝑠′\\pi(s,s^{\\prime})\\setminus\\{s^{\\prime}\\}, which is a subpath of π​(s,r)𝜋𝑠𝑟\\pi(s,r) and does not contain any point of u​v¯¯𝑢𝑣\\overline{uv}. This implies that ps​tsubscript𝑝𝑠𝑡p_{st} cannot be on π​(s,s′)∖{s′}𝜋𝑠superscript𝑠′superscript𝑠′\\pi(s,s^{\\prime})\\setminus\\{s^{\\prime}\\} and thus is on π​(s′,t)𝜋superscript𝑠′𝑡\\pi(s^{\\prime},t). Note that s′superscript𝑠′s^{\\prime} is in P2subscript𝑃2P_{2}. Since both s′superscript𝑠′s^{\\prime} and t𝑡t are in P2subscript𝑃2P_{2}, π​(s′,t)𝜋superscript𝑠′𝑡\\pi(s^{\\prime},t) is in P2subscript𝑃2P_{2}. As such, ps​t∈P2subscript𝑝𝑠𝑡subscript𝑃2p_{st}\\in P_{2}. The above proves that q∈P1𝑞subscript𝑃1q\\in P_{1} and α𝛼\\alpha is on B​(s,t)𝐵𝑠𝑡B(s,t) between q𝑞q and ps​tsubscript𝑝𝑠𝑡p_{st}. In the following, we proceed to prove that α∈△​(s,r,q)𝛼△𝑠𝑟𝑞\\alpha\\in\\triangle(s,r,q). As α𝛼\\alpha is on B​(s,t)𝐵𝑠𝑡B(s,t) between q𝑞q and ps​tsubscript𝑝𝑠𝑡p_{st}, α𝛼\\alpha must be in the geodesic triangle △​(s,t,q)△𝑠𝑡𝑞\\triangle(s,t,q). Since q∈B​(s,t)𝑞𝐵𝑠𝑡q\\in B(s,t), due to the general position assumption, the incident edges of q𝑞q in π​(q,s)𝜋𝑞𝑠\\pi(q,s) and π​(q,t)𝜋𝑞𝑡\\pi(q,t) cannot be coincident . This means that q𝑞q is the junction vertex of π​(q,s)𝜋𝑞𝑠\\pi(q,s) and π​(q,t)𝜋𝑞𝑡\\pi(q,t), and thus q𝑞q is an apex of △​(s,t,q)△𝑠𝑡𝑞\\triangle(s,t,q).\nSince t∈P2𝑡subscript𝑃2t\\in P_{2} and q∈P1𝑞subscript𝑃1q\\in P_{1}, π​(q,t)𝜋𝑞𝑡\\pi(q,t) must cross u​v¯¯𝑢𝑣\\overline{uv} at a point p𝑝p; e.g., see Fig. 5.\nSince both α𝛼\\alpha and q𝑞q are in P1subscript𝑃1P_{1}, α𝛼\\alpha is also in the geodesic triangle △​(s,p,q)△𝑠𝑝𝑞\\triangle(s,p,q) and q𝑞q is an apex of △​(s,p,q)△𝑠𝑝𝑞\\triangle(s,p,q). Further, since p∈u​v¯⊆π​(s,r)𝑝¯𝑢𝑣𝜋𝑠𝑟p\\in\\overline{uv}\\subseteq\\pi(s,r), △​(s,p,q)△𝑠𝑝𝑞\\triangle(s,p,q) is a subset of △​(s,r,q)△𝑠𝑟𝑞\\triangle(s,r,q) and q𝑞q is also an apex of △​(s,r,q)△𝑠𝑟𝑞\\triangle(s,r,q). As such, we obtain that α∈△​(s,r,q)𝛼△𝑠𝑟𝑞\\alpha\\in\\triangle(s,r,q). This proves the lemma statement (1). The above also proves that q𝑞q is an apex of △​(s,r,q)△𝑠𝑟𝑞\\triangle(s,r,q). By definition, u′superscript𝑢′u^{\\prime} and v′superscript𝑣′v^{\\prime} are other two apexes of △​(s,r,q)△𝑠𝑟𝑞\\triangle(s,r,q). This proves the lemma statement (2). Since α∈△​(s,r,q)𝛼△𝑠𝑟𝑞\\alpha\\in\\triangle(s,r,q), the lemma statements (3) and (4) obviously hold.\n □□\\Box In light of Lemma 5,\nwe can apply the tentative prune-and-search technique [ref]15 on the three pseudo-convex chains specified in the lemma in a similar way as before to compute α𝛼\\alpha in O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) time. We summarize our algorithm for this case. First, we compute the\nedge u​v¯¯𝑢𝑣\\overline{uv}, which can be done in O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) time using the\nGH data structure by Lemma 2. Second, we compute the\njunction vertex tu​vsubscript𝑡𝑢𝑣t_{uv} of π​(t,u)𝜋𝑡𝑢\\pi(t,u) and π​(t,v)𝜋𝑡𝑣\\pi(t,v) in O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n)\ntime by the GH data structure . Third, we apply the tentative\nprune-and-search technique on the three pseudo-convex chains as specified in\nLemma 5, along with the binary search scheme in\nLemma 2 on the chains, to compute α𝛼\\alpha in O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) time. Recall that the above algorithm is based on the assumption that\nα𝛼\\alpha is a Voronoi vertex of F​V​D​(S)𝐹𝑉𝐷𝑆\\mbox{$F\\!V\\!D$}(S). However, when we invoke the procedure\nduring the geodesic sweeping algorithm\nwe do not know whether the assumption is true. Therefore, as a\nfinal step, we add a validation procedure as follows. Suppose α𝛼\\alpha\nis\nthe point returned by the algorithm. First, we check whether\nd​(s,α)=d​(t,α)=d​(r,α)𝑑𝑠𝛼𝑑𝑡𝛼𝑑𝑟𝛼d(s,\\alpha)=d(t,\\alpha)=d(r,\\alpha). If not, we return null.\nOtherwise, we further check whether d​(c∗,α)≤min⁡{d​(c∗,β​(s,t)),d​(c∗,β​(t,r))}𝑑superscript𝑐𝛼𝑑superscript𝑐𝛽𝑠𝑡𝑑superscript𝑐𝛽𝑡𝑟d(c^{*},\\alpha)\\leq\\min\\{d(c^{*},\\beta(s,t)),d(c^{*},\\beta(t,r))\\}. This is because the Voronoi\nvertex α𝛼\\alpha is only useful if it is inside the current sweeping circle\nC𝐶C, whose geodesic distance to c∗superscript𝑐c^{*} is at most\nmin⁡{d​(c∗,β​(s,t)),d​(c∗,β​(t,r))}𝑑superscript𝑐𝛽𝑠𝑡𝑑superscript𝑐𝛽𝑡𝑟\\min\\{d(c^{*},\\beta(s,t)),d(c^{*},\\beta(t,r))\\} (because neither\nβ​(s,t)𝛽𝑠𝑡\\beta(s,t) nor β​(t,r)𝛽𝑡𝑟\\beta(t,r) is in the interior of C𝐶C). Hence, if d​(c∗,α)≤min⁡{d​(c∗,β​(s,t)),d​(c∗,β​(t,r))}𝑑superscript𝑐𝛼𝑑superscript𝑐𝛽𝑠𝑡𝑑superscript𝑐𝛽𝑡𝑟d(c^{*},\\alpha)\\leq\\min\\{d(c^{*},\\beta(s,t)),d(c^{*},\\beta(t,r))\\}, then we return α𝛼\\alpha;\notherwise, we return null. This validation step\ntakes O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) time by the GH data structure. The above discusses the case where both u𝑢u and v𝑣v are polygon vertices. In the following, we consider the other case where at least one of them is not a polygon vertex, i.e., u=s𝑢𝑠u=s or/and v=r𝑣𝑟v=r (because all vertices of π​(s,r)𝜋𝑠𝑟\\pi(s,r) except s𝑠s and r𝑟r are polygon vertices). In fact, this case is missed from the algorithm of Oh and Ahn  (see the proof of Lemma 3.6 ). It turns out that Lemma 5 still holds for this case and thus we can apply exactly the same algorithm as above. We prove the lemma below by reducing this case to the previous case where u𝑢u and v𝑣v are polygon vertices. Lemma 5 still holds when u=s𝑢𝑠u=s or/and v=r𝑣𝑟v=r. Proof:\nWithout loss of generality, we assume that v𝑣v is not a polygon vertex\nand thus v=r=r′𝑣𝑟superscript𝑟′v=r=r^{\\prime}. We extend\nu​v¯¯𝑢𝑣\\overline{uv} in the direction from u𝑢u to v𝑣v until ∂P𝑃\\partial P at\na point v′superscript𝑣′v^{\\prime} (e.g., see Fig. 8).\nIf u𝑢u is also not a polygon vertex, then u=s=s′𝑢𝑠superscript𝑠′u=s=s^{\\prime} and we extend\nu​v¯¯𝑢𝑣\\overline{uv} in the direction from v𝑣v to u𝑢u until ∂P𝑃\\partial P at\na point u′superscript𝑢′u^{\\prime}. If u𝑢u is a polygon vertex, we let u′=usuperscript𝑢′𝑢u^{\\prime}=u. Let P′superscript𝑃′P^{\\prime} be the polygon obtained by adding v​v′¯¯𝑣superscript𝑣′\\overline{vv^{\\prime}} and\nu​u′¯¯𝑢superscript𝑢′\\overline{uu^{\\prime}} to P𝑃P. So P′superscript𝑃′P^{\\prime} is a (weakly) simple polygon with u𝑢u\nand v𝑣v as two vertices. We claim that B​(s,t)𝐵𝑠𝑡B(s,t), B​(s,r)𝐵𝑠𝑟B(s,r), and\nB​(t,r)𝐵𝑡𝑟B(t,r) are still the bisectors of s𝑠s, t𝑡t, and r𝑟r in P′superscript𝑃′P^{\\prime}. Before proving the claim, we proceed to prove the lemma with help of the claim. Due to the claim, since u𝑢u and v𝑣v are now both polygon vertices of P′superscript𝑃′P^{\\prime}, we can apply literally the same argument as in the previous case. Indeed, the argument only relies on the properties of the three bisectors, e.g., α𝛼\\alpha is their common intersection. Now that the three bisectors do not change from P𝑃P to P′superscript𝑃′P^{\\prime}, the same argument still works. Thus, the lemma follows. In the following, we prove the above claim. It is sufficient to show the following four properties: (1)\nv​v′¯∖{v}∪u​u′¯∖{u}¯𝑣superscript𝑣′𝑣¯𝑢superscript𝑢′𝑢\\overline{vv^{\\prime}}\\setminus\\{v\\}\\cup\\overline{uu^{\\prime}}\\setminus\\{u\\} does not intersect any of the three bisectors B​(s,t)𝐵𝑠𝑡B(s,t), B​(t,r)𝐵𝑡𝑟B(t,r), and\nB​(s,r)𝐵𝑠𝑟B(s,r); (2) v​v′¯∖{v}∪u​u′¯∖{u}¯𝑣superscript𝑣′𝑣¯𝑢superscript𝑢′𝑢\\overline{vv^{\\prime}}\\setminus\\{v\\}\\cup\\overline{uu^{\\prime}}\\setminus\\{u\\} does not intersect π​(s,p)𝜋𝑠𝑝\\pi(s,p) for any point p∈B​(s,t)∪B​(s,r)𝑝𝐵𝑠𝑡𝐵𝑠𝑟p\\in B(s,t)\\cup B(s,r); (3) v​v′¯∖{v}∪u​u′¯∖{u}¯𝑣superscript𝑣′𝑣¯𝑢superscript𝑢′𝑢\\overline{vv^{\\prime}}\\setminus\\{v\\}\\cup\\overline{uu^{\\prime}}\\setminus\\{u\\} does not intersect π​(t,p)𝜋𝑡𝑝\\pi(t,p) for any point p∈B​(s,t)∪B​(t,r)𝑝𝐵𝑠𝑡𝐵𝑡𝑟p\\in B(s,t)\\cup B(t,r);\n(4) v​v′¯∖{v}∪u​u′¯∖{u}¯𝑣superscript𝑣′𝑣¯𝑢superscript𝑢′𝑢\\overline{vv^{\\prime}}\\setminus\\{v\\}\\cup\\overline{uu^{\\prime}}\\setminus\\{u\\} does not intersect π​(r,p)𝜋𝑟𝑝\\pi(r,p) for any point p∈B​(s,r)∪B​(t,r)𝑝𝐵𝑠𝑟𝐵𝑡𝑟p\\in B(s,r)\\cup B(t,r). Below we will prove the above four properties only for v​v′¯∖{v}¯𝑣superscript𝑣′𝑣\\overline{vv^{\\prime}}\\setminus\\{v\\}, as the proof for u​u′¯∖{u}¯𝑢superscript𝑢′𝑢\\overline{uu^{\\prime}}\\setminus\\{u\\} is similar.\nWe prove these properties in order. First of all, since v′superscript𝑣′v^{\\prime} is an extension of u​v¯¯𝑢𝑣\\overline{uv}, it holds that π​(s,v′)=π​(s,v)∪v​v′¯𝜋𝑠superscript𝑣′𝜋𝑠𝑣¯𝑣superscript𝑣′\\pi(s,v^{\\prime})=\\pi(s,v)\\cup\\overline{vv^{\\prime}}. Recall that d​(s,c)=d​(c,r)>d​(t,c)𝑑𝑠𝑐𝑑𝑐𝑟𝑑𝑡𝑐d(s,c)=d(c,r)>d(t,c) and c∈u​v¯𝑐¯𝑢𝑣c\\in\\overline{uv}.\nAssume to the contrary that v​v′¯¯𝑣superscript𝑣′\\overline{vv^{\\prime}} intersects B​(s,t)𝐵𝑠𝑡B(s,t), say, at a point z𝑧z. Then, d​(s,z)=d​(s,c)+|c​z¯|𝑑𝑠𝑧𝑑𝑠𝑐¯𝑐𝑧d(s,z)=d(s,c)+|\\overline{cz}|. On the other hand, by triangle inequality, d​(t,z)≤d​(t,c)+|c​z¯|𝑑𝑡𝑧𝑑𝑡𝑐¯𝑐𝑧d(t,z)\\leq d(t,c)+|\\overline{cz}|. Hence, we obtain d​(s,z)=d​(s,c)+|c​z¯|>d​(t,c)+|c​z¯|≥d​(t,z)𝑑𝑠𝑧𝑑𝑠𝑐¯𝑐𝑧𝑑𝑡𝑐¯𝑐𝑧𝑑𝑡𝑧d(s,z)=d(s,c)+|\\overline{cz}|>d(t,c)+|\\overline{cz}|\\geq d(t,z). However, since z∈B​(s,t)𝑧𝐵𝑠𝑡z\\in B(s,t), d​(s,z)=d​(t,z)𝑑𝑠𝑧𝑑𝑡𝑧d(s,z)=d(t,z), and thus contradiction occurs. This proves that v​v′¯¯𝑣superscript𝑣′\\overline{vv^{\\prime}} does not intersect B​(s,t)𝐵𝑠𝑡B(s,t). Because π​(s,v′)𝜋𝑠superscript𝑣′\\pi(s,v^{\\prime}) contains r​v′¯¯𝑟superscript𝑣′\\overline{rv^{\\prime}}, d​(s,p)>d​(r,p)𝑑𝑠𝑝𝑑𝑟𝑝d(s,p)>d(r,p) for any point p∈v​v′¯𝑝¯𝑣superscript𝑣′p\\in\\overline{vv^{\\prime}}. Therefore, v​v′¯∖{v}¯𝑣superscript𝑣′𝑣\\overline{vv^{\\prime}}\\setminus\\{v\\} cannot intersect B​(s,r)𝐵𝑠𝑟B(s,r). Next we prove the case for B​(t,r)𝐵𝑡𝑟B(t,r).\nLet a𝑎a be the anchor of r𝑟r in π​(t,r)𝜋𝑡𝑟\\pi(t,r). Since d​(t,c)<d​(r,c)=|c​r¯|𝑑𝑡𝑐𝑑𝑟𝑐¯𝑐𝑟d(t,c)<d(r,c)=|\\overline{cr}|, the angle ∠​(a,r,c)∠𝑎𝑟𝑐\\angle(a,r,c) must be smaller than π/2𝜋2\\pi/2, and thus the angle ∠​(v′,r,a)∠superscript𝑣′𝑟𝑎\\angle(v^{\\prime},r,a) is larger than π/2𝜋2\\pi/2. Notice that r𝑟r is the junction vertex of π​(r,t)𝜋𝑟𝑡\\pi(r,t) and π​(r,p)=r​p¯𝜋𝑟𝑝¯𝑟𝑝\\pi(r,p)=\\overline{rp} for any p∈v​v′¯∖{v}𝑝¯𝑣superscript𝑣′𝑣p\\in\\overline{vv^{\\prime}}\\setminus\\{v\\}. Since the angle ∠​(p,r,a)=∠​(v′,r,a)∠𝑝𝑟𝑎∠superscript𝑣′𝑟𝑎\\angle(p,r,a)=\\angle(v^{\\prime},r,a) is larger than π/2𝜋2\\pi/2, it must hold that d​(t,p)>d​(r,p)𝑑𝑡𝑝𝑑𝑟𝑝d(t,p)>d(r,p)  (see Corollary 2). This implies that p𝑝p cannot be on B​(t,r)𝐵𝑡𝑟B(t,r). Thus, v​v′¯∖{v}¯𝑣superscript𝑣′𝑣\\overline{vv^{\\prime}}\\setminus\\{v\\} does not intersect B​(t,r)𝐵𝑡𝑟B(t,r). This prove property (1). We now prove property (2). Let p𝑝p be any point in B​(s,t)∪B​(s,r)𝐵𝑠𝑡𝐵𝑠𝑟B(s,t)\\cup B(s,r). Assume to the contrary that π​(s,p)𝜋𝑠𝑝\\pi(s,p) contains a point p′∈v​v′¯∖vsuperscript𝑝′¯𝑣superscript𝑣′𝑣p^{\\prime}\\in\\overline{vv^{\\prime}}\\setminus{v}. Then, since π​(s,p′)𝜋𝑠superscript𝑝′\\pi(s,p^{\\prime}) contains π​(s,r)𝜋𝑠𝑟\\pi(s,r), π​(s,p)𝜋𝑠𝑝\\pi(s,p) contains π​(s,r)𝜋𝑠𝑟\\pi(s,r) and thus contains r𝑟r. If p∈B​(s,r)𝑝𝐵𝑠𝑟p\\in B(s,r), then we immediately obtain contradiction as π​(s,p)𝜋𝑠𝑝\\pi(s,p) cannot contain r𝑟r. Now consider the case p∈B​(s,t)𝑝𝐵𝑠𝑡p\\in B(s,t). Since d​(s,c)>d​(t,c)𝑑𝑠𝑐𝑑𝑡𝑐d(s,c)>d(t,c), there must be a point p′′∈π​(s,c)superscript𝑝′′𝜋𝑠𝑐p^{\\prime\\prime}\\in\\pi(s,c) such that d​(s,p′′)=d​(t,p′′)𝑑𝑠superscript𝑝′′𝑑𝑡superscript𝑝′′d(s,p^{\\prime\\prime})=d(t,p^{\\prime\\prime}), i.e., p′′∈B​(s,t)superscript𝑝′′𝐵𝑠𝑡p^{\\prime\\prime}\\in B(s,t). Since π​(s,p′′)⊆π​(s,c)𝜋𝑠superscript𝑝′′𝜋𝑠𝑐\\pi(s,p^{\\prime\\prime})\\subseteq\\pi(s,c) and c≠r𝑐𝑟c\\neq r, π​(s,p′′)𝜋𝑠superscript𝑝′′\\pi(s,p^{\\prime\\prime}) does not contain r𝑟r. If p=p′′𝑝superscript𝑝′′p=p^{\\prime\\prime}, we obtain that π​(s,p)𝜋𝑠𝑝\\pi(s,p) does not contain r𝑟r, which incurs contradiction. Hence, p≠p′′𝑝superscript𝑝′′p\\neq p^{\\prime\\prime}. Thus, π​(s,p)𝜋𝑠𝑝\\pi(s,p) intersects B​(s,t)𝐵𝑠𝑡B(s,t) at two different points p𝑝p and p′′superscript𝑝′′p^{\\prime\\prime}. But this is not possible due to Observation 3. This proves property (2). For property (3), let p𝑝p be any point in B​(s,t)∪B​(t,r)𝐵𝑠𝑡𝐵𝑡𝑟B(s,t)\\cup B(t,r). Assume to the contrary that π​(t,p)𝜋𝑡𝑝\\pi(t,p) contains a point p′∈v​v′¯∖{v}superscript𝑝′¯𝑣superscript𝑣′𝑣p^{\\prime}\\in\\overline{vv^{\\prime}}\\setminus\\{v\\}. We first discuss the case p∈B​(s,t)𝑝𝐵𝑠𝑡p\\in B(s,t). Consider the geodesic\ntriangle △​(s,t,p)△𝑠𝑡𝑝\\triangle(s,t,p); e.g., see Fig. 9. Since p∈B​(s,t)𝑝𝐵𝑠𝑡p\\in B(s,t), p𝑝p must be an apex\nof △​(s,t,p)△𝑠𝑡𝑝\\triangle(s,t,p). Let a𝑎a be the junction vertex of π​(s,p)𝜋𝑠𝑝\\pi(s,p)\nand π​(s,t)𝜋𝑠𝑡\\pi(s,t) and let b𝑏b the junction vertex of π​(t,s)𝜋𝑡𝑠\\pi(t,s) and\nπ​(t,p)𝜋𝑡𝑝\\pi(t,p). Hence, a𝑎a and b𝑏b are two apexes of △​(s,t,p)△𝑠𝑡𝑝\\triangle(s,t,p).\nBy a similar argument as Observation 1, the middle point\nps​tsubscript𝑝𝑠𝑡p_{st} of π​(s,t)𝜋𝑠𝑡\\pi(s,t) must be on π​(a,b)𝜋𝑎𝑏\\pi(a,b), i.e., the side of\n△​(s,t,p)△𝑠𝑡𝑝\\triangle(s,t,p) opposite to p𝑝p. Hence, the portion of B​(s,t)𝐵𝑠𝑡B(s,t)\nbetween p𝑝p and ps​tsubscript𝑝𝑠𝑡p_{st}, denoted by B𝐵B, separates △​(s,t,p)△𝑠𝑡𝑝\\triangle(s,t,p)\ninto two parts. As π​(t,p)=π​(t,b)∪π​(b,p)𝜋𝑡𝑝𝜋𝑡𝑏𝜋𝑏𝑝\\pi(t,p)=\\pi(t,b)\\cup\\pi(b,p), p′superscript𝑝′p^{\\prime} is either in\nπ​(t,b)𝜋𝑡𝑏\\pi(t,b) or in π​(b,p)𝜋𝑏𝑝\\pi(b,p). If p′superscript𝑝′p^{\\prime} is in π​(t,b)𝜋𝑡𝑏\\pi(t,b), then p′superscript𝑝′p^{\\prime} is in π​(s,t)𝜋𝑠𝑡\\pi(s,t) as π​(t,b)𝜋𝑡𝑏\\pi(t,b) is a subpath of π​(s,t)𝜋𝑠𝑡\\pi(s,t). Therefore, π​(s,p′)𝜋𝑠superscript𝑝′\\pi(s,p^{\\prime}) is a subpath of π​(s,t)𝜋𝑠𝑡\\pi(s,t). Recall that π​(s,r)⊆π​(s,p′)𝜋𝑠𝑟𝜋𝑠superscript𝑝′\\pi(s,r)\\subseteq\\pi(s,p^{\\prime}). We thus obtain that π​(s,r)𝜋𝑠𝑟\\pi(s,r) is a subpath of π​(s,t)𝜋𝑠𝑡\\pi(s,t). Since c∈π​(s,r)𝑐𝜋𝑠𝑟c\\in\\pi(s,r), we obtain that s𝑠s, c𝑐c, r𝑟r, and t𝑡t are all on π​(s,t)𝜋𝑠𝑡\\pi(s,t) in this order. Hence, d​(c,r)≤d​(c,t)𝑑𝑐𝑟𝑑𝑐𝑡d(c,r)\\leq d(c,t), which incurs contradiction as d​(c,r)>d​(c,t)𝑑𝑐𝑟𝑑𝑐𝑡d(c,r)>d(c,t). If p′superscript𝑝′p^{\\prime} is in π​(b,p)𝜋𝑏𝑝\\pi(b,p), then π​(s,p′)𝜋𝑠superscript𝑝′\\pi(s,p^{\\prime}) must intersect B𝐵B, say, at a point z𝑧z (e.g., see Fig. 9). By Lemma 7, it holds that d​(s,z)≥d​(z,p′)𝑑𝑠𝑧𝑑𝑧superscript𝑝′d(s,z)\\geq d(z,p^{\\prime}), and thus d​(s,z)≥d​(s,p′)/2𝑑𝑠𝑧𝑑𝑠superscript𝑝′2d(s,z)\\geq d(s,p^{\\prime})/2. Since r∈π​(s,p′)𝑟𝜋𝑠superscript𝑝′r\\in\\pi(s,p^{\\prime}), we have d​(s,z)≥d​(s,r)/2=d​(s,c)𝑑𝑠𝑧𝑑𝑠𝑟2𝑑𝑠𝑐d(s,z)\\geq d(s,r)/2=d(s,c). This implies that c∈π​(s,z)𝑐𝜋𝑠𝑧c\\in\\pi(s,z). Because z∈B𝑧𝐵z\\in B, we have d​(s,c)≤d​(t,c)𝑑𝑠𝑐𝑑𝑡𝑐d(s,c)\\leq d(t,c). But this contradicts with the fact d​(s,c)>d​(t,c)𝑑𝑠𝑐𝑑𝑡𝑐d(s,c)>d(t,c). The above obtains contradiction for the case p∈B​(s,t)𝑝𝐵𝑠𝑡p\\in B(s,t). We next discuss the case p∈B​(t,r)𝑝𝐵𝑡𝑟p\\in B(t,r). The bisector B​(t,r)𝐵𝑡𝑟B(t,r) divides\nP𝑃P into two subpolygons; let Ptsubscript𝑃𝑡P_{t} be the one containing t𝑡t and let Prsubscript𝑃𝑟P_{r} denote the one containing r𝑟r. We\nassume that neither Pssubscript𝑃𝑠P_{s} nor Prsubscript𝑃𝑟P_{r} contains B​(t,r)𝐵𝑡𝑟B(t,r). As\np∈B​(t,r)𝑝𝐵𝑡𝑟p\\in B(t,r), the entire path π​(t,p)𝜋𝑡𝑝\\pi(t,p) is in Pt∪B​(s,t)subscript𝑃𝑡𝐵𝑠𝑡P_{t}\\cup B(s,t).\nSince p′∈v​v′¯∖{v′}superscript𝑝′¯𝑣superscript𝑣′superscript𝑣′p^{\\prime}\\in\\overline{vv^{\\prime}}\\setminus\\{v^{\\prime}\\}, by a similar argument using the angle at r𝑟r as that\nfor property (1), we can show that d​(t,p′)>d​(r,p′)𝑑𝑡superscript𝑝′𝑑𝑟superscript𝑝′d(t,p^{\\prime})>d(r,p^{\\prime}). This implies\nthat p′superscript𝑝′p^{\\prime} is in Pssubscript𝑃𝑠P_{s}. Therefore, p′superscript𝑝′p^{\\prime} cannot be in π​(s,p)𝜋𝑠𝑝\\pi(s,p), a\ncontradiction. This proves property (3). For property (4), assume to the contrary that π​(r,p)𝜋𝑟𝑝\\pi(r,p)\ncontains a point p′∈v​v′¯∖{v}superscript𝑝′¯𝑣superscript𝑣′𝑣p^{\\prime}\\in\\overline{vv^{\\prime}}\\setminus\\{v\\}. We first discuss the case p∈B​(t,r)𝑝𝐵𝑡𝑟p\\in B(t,r). Let a𝑎a be the anchor of r𝑟r in π​(t,r)𝜋𝑡𝑟\\pi(t,r). Recall that we have shown before that the angle ∠​(a,r,v′)∠𝑎𝑟superscript𝑣′\\angle(a,r,v^{\\prime}) is larger than π/2𝜋2\\pi/2. Consider the geodesic triangle △​(t,r,p)△𝑡𝑟𝑝\\triangle(t,r,p). If r𝑟r is not an apex of △​(t,r,p)△𝑡𝑟𝑝\\triangle(t,r,p), then r​a¯∈π​(r,t)∩π​(r,p)¯𝑟𝑎𝜋𝑟𝑡𝜋𝑟𝑝\\overline{ra}\\in\\pi(r,t)\\cap\\pi(r,p). Since p′∈π​(r,p)superscript𝑝′𝜋𝑟𝑝p^{\\prime}\\in\\pi(r,p) and p′∉r​a¯superscript𝑝′¯𝑟𝑎p^{\\prime}\\not\\in\\overline{ra}, we obtain that π​(r,p′)𝜋𝑟superscript𝑝′\\pi(r,p^{\\prime}) contains a𝑎a. However, since ∠​(a,r,v′)>π/2∠𝑎𝑟superscript𝑣′𝜋2\\angle(a,r,v^{\\prime})>\\pi/2 and p′∈r​v′¯superscript𝑝′¯𝑟superscript𝑣′p^{\\prime}\\in\\overline{rv^{\\prime}}, π​(r,p′)=r​p′¯𝜋𝑟superscript𝑝′¯𝑟superscript𝑝′\\pi(r,p^{\\prime})=\\overline{rp^{\\prime}} does not contain a𝑎a, a contradiction. If r𝑟r is an apex of △​(t,r,p)△𝑡𝑟𝑝\\triangle(t,r,p), then since p∈B​(t,r)𝑝𝐵𝑡𝑟p\\in B(t,r), the angle ∠​(a,r,b)∠𝑎𝑟𝑏\\angle(a,r,b) must be smaller than π/2𝜋2\\pi/2, where b𝑏b is the anchor of r𝑟r in π​(p,r)𝜋𝑝𝑟\\pi(p,r). As p′∈π​(r,p)superscript𝑝′𝜋𝑟𝑝p^{\\prime}\\in\\pi(r,p) and π​(r,p′)=r​p′¯𝜋𝑟superscript𝑝′¯𝑟superscript𝑝′\\pi(r,p^{\\prime})=\\overline{rp^{\\prime}}, we obtain that p′∈r​b¯superscript𝑝′¯𝑟𝑏p^{\\prime}\\in\\overline{rb} and thus ∠​(a,r,b)=∠​(a,r,p′)∠𝑎𝑟𝑏∠𝑎𝑟superscript𝑝′\\angle(a,r,b)=\\angle(a,r,p^{\\prime}).\nHence, ∠​(a,r,p′)∠𝑎𝑟superscript𝑝′\\angle(a,r,p^{\\prime}) is smaller than π/2𝜋2\\pi/2. However,\n∠​(a,r,p′)=∠​(a,r,v′)∠𝑎𝑟superscript𝑝′∠𝑎𝑟superscript𝑣′\\angle(a,r,p^{\\prime})=\\angle(a,r,v^{\\prime}), which is larger than π/2𝜋2\\pi/2. Thus we obtain contradiction. We then discuss the case p∈B​(s,r)𝑝𝐵𝑠𝑟p\\in B(s,r). Note that u𝑢u is the anchor of r𝑟r in π​(s,r)𝜋𝑠𝑟\\pi(s,r). Hence, the angle ∠​(u,r,v′)∠𝑢𝑟superscript𝑣′\\angle(u,r,v^{\\prime}) is equal to π𝜋\\pi, which is larger than π/2𝜋2\\pi/2. Consequently, we can follow the same analysis as above to obtain contradiction. This proves property (4). The lemma thus follows.\n □□\\Box We finally prove the following technical lemma, which is needed in the proof of Lemma 6. The lemma, which establishes a very basic property of shortest paths in simple polygons, may be interesting in its own right. Let s𝑠s and t𝑡t be any two points in P𝑃P such that B​(s,t)𝐵𝑠𝑡B(s,t) does not contain any vertex of P𝑃P.\nSuppose p𝑝p is a point in B​(s,t)𝐵𝑠𝑡B(s,t) and p′superscript𝑝′p^{\\prime} is a point in π​(t,p)𝜋𝑡𝑝\\pi(t,p).\nThen, π​(s,p′)𝜋𝑠superscript𝑝′\\pi(s,p^{\\prime}) intersects B​(s,t)𝐵𝑠𝑡B(s,t) at a single point z𝑧z and d​(s,z)≥d​(z,p′)𝑑𝑠𝑧𝑑𝑧superscript𝑝′d(s,z)\\geq d(z,p^{\\prime}) (in particular, d​(s,z)>d​(z,p′)𝑑𝑠𝑧𝑑𝑧superscript𝑝′d(s,z)>d(z,p^{\\prime}) if p′≠tsuperscript𝑝′𝑡p^{\\prime}\\neq t); e.g., see Fig. 9. Proof:\nWe first consider a special case where p𝑝p is the middle point ps​tsubscript𝑝𝑠𝑡p_{st} of π​(s,t)𝜋𝑠𝑡\\pi(s,t). Note that ps​t∈B​(s,t)subscript𝑝𝑠𝑡𝐵𝑠𝑡p_{st}\\in B(s,t). In this case, z=ps​t𝑧subscript𝑝𝑠𝑡z=p_{st} and π​(s,t)=π​(s,z)∪π​(z,t)𝜋𝑠𝑡𝜋𝑠𝑧𝜋𝑧𝑡\\pi(s,t)=\\pi(s,z)\\cup\\pi(z,t). Hence,\nπ​(s,p′)=π​(s,z)∪π​(z,p′)𝜋𝑠superscript𝑝′𝜋𝑠𝑧𝜋𝑧superscript𝑝′\\pi(s,p^{\\prime})=\\pi(s,z)\\cup\\pi(z,p^{\\prime}) and d​(s,z)=d​(z,t)≥d​(z,p′)𝑑𝑠𝑧𝑑𝑧𝑡𝑑𝑧superscript𝑝′d(s,z)=d(z,t)\\geq d(z,p^{\\prime}) (and d​(s,z)=d​(s,t)>d​(z,p′)𝑑𝑠𝑧𝑑𝑠𝑡𝑑𝑧superscript𝑝′d(s,z)=d(s,t)>d(z,p^{\\prime}) if p′≠tsuperscript𝑝′𝑡p^{\\prime}\\neq t). In the following we assume p≠ps​t𝑝subscript𝑝𝑠𝑡p\\neq p_{st}.\nConsider the geodesic triangle △​(s,t,p)△𝑠𝑡𝑝\\triangle(s,t,p). Since p∈B​(s,t)𝑝𝐵𝑠𝑡p\\in B(s,t), p𝑝p is an apex of △​(s,t,p)△𝑠𝑡𝑝\\triangle(s,t,p). Let a𝑎a be the junction vertex of π​(s,t)𝜋𝑠𝑡\\pi(s,t) and π​(s,p)𝜋𝑠𝑝\\pi(s,p) and b𝑏b be the junction vertex of π​(t,s)𝜋𝑡𝑠\\pi(t,s) and π​(t,p)𝜋𝑡𝑝\\pi(t,p) (e.g., see Fig. 9). Hence, a,b,p𝑎𝑏𝑝a,b,p are the three apexes of △​(s,t,p)△𝑠𝑡𝑝\\triangle(s,t,p). In the following discussion we will use △​(a,b,p)△𝑎𝑏𝑝\\triangle(a,b,p) instead. By a similar argument as Observation 1, ps​tsubscript𝑝𝑠𝑡p_{st} is in π​(a,b)𝜋𝑎𝑏\\pi(a,b). The bisector B​(s,t)𝐵𝑠𝑡B(s,t) partitions P𝑃P into two connected subpolygons Pssubscript𝑃𝑠P_{s} and Ptsubscript𝑃𝑡P_{t} such that Pssubscript𝑃𝑠P_{s} contains s𝑠s and Ptsubscript𝑃𝑡P_{t} contains t𝑡t . We assume that neither Pssubscript𝑃𝑠P_{s} nor Ptsubscript𝑃𝑡P_{t} contains B​(s,t)𝐵𝑠𝑡B(s,t).\nSince p∈B​(s,t)𝑝𝐵𝑠𝑡p\\in B(s,t), π​(s,p)∖{p}⊆Ps𝜋𝑠𝑝𝑝subscript𝑃𝑠\\pi(s,p)\\setminus\\{p\\}\\subseteq P_{s} and π​(t,p)∖{p}⊆Pt𝜋𝑡𝑝𝑝subscript𝑃𝑡\\pi(t,p)\\setminus\\{p\\}\\subseteq P_{t} . This implies that π​(s,p′)𝜋𝑠superscript𝑝′\\pi(s,p^{\\prime}) intersects B​(s,t)𝐵𝑠𝑡B(s,t) at a single point z𝑧z because s∈Ps𝑠subscript𝑃𝑠s\\in P_{s} and p′∉Pssuperscript𝑝′subscript𝑃𝑠p^{\\prime}\\not\\in P_{s}. Since p′∈π​(t,p)superscript𝑝′𝜋𝑡𝑝p^{\\prime}\\in\\pi(t,p), p′superscript𝑝′p^{\\prime} is either in π​(t,b)𝜋𝑡𝑏\\pi(t,b) or in π​(b,p)∖{b}𝜋𝑏𝑝𝑏\\pi(b,p)\\setminus\\{b\\}. In the former case, π​(s,b)⊆π​(s,p′)⊆π​(s,t)𝜋𝑠𝑏𝜋𝑠superscript𝑝′𝜋𝑠𝑡\\pi(s,b)\\subseteq\\pi(s,p^{\\prime})\\subseteq\\pi(s,t) and thus z=ps​t𝑧subscript𝑝𝑠𝑡z=p_{st}. Hence, d​(s,z)=d​(s,t)/2𝑑𝑠𝑧𝑑𝑠𝑡2d(s,z)=d(s,t)/2. On the other hand, π​(z,p′)⊆π​(z,t)𝜋𝑧superscript𝑝′𝜋𝑧𝑡\\pi(z,p^{\\prime})\\subseteq\\pi(z,t) and thus d​(z,p′)≤d​(z,t)=d​(s,t)/2𝑑𝑧superscript𝑝′𝑑𝑧𝑡𝑑𝑠𝑡2d(z,p^{\\prime})\\leq d(z,t)=d(s,t)/2 (and d​(z,p′)<d​(z,t)𝑑𝑧superscript𝑝′𝑑𝑧𝑡d(z,p^{\\prime})<d(z,t) if p′≠tsuperscript𝑝′𝑡p^{\\prime}\\neq t). Therefore, we obtain that d​(s,z)≥d​(z,p′)𝑑𝑠𝑧𝑑𝑧superscript𝑝′d(s,z)\\geq d(z,p^{\\prime}) (and d​(s,z)>d​(z,p′)𝑑𝑠𝑧𝑑𝑧superscript𝑝′d(s,z)>d(z,p^{\\prime}) if p′≠tsuperscript𝑝′𝑡p^{\\prime}\\neq t). It remains to discuss the case p′∈π​(b,p)∖{b}superscript𝑝′𝜋𝑏𝑝𝑏p^{\\prime}\\in\\pi(b,p)\\setminus\\{b\\}. In this case, p′superscript𝑝′p^{\\prime} is a point on the boundary of △​(a,b,p)△𝑎𝑏𝑝\\triangle(a,b,p). Let q𝑞q be the anchor of p′superscript𝑝′p^{\\prime} in π​(s,p′)𝜋𝑠superscript𝑝′\\pi(s,p^{\\prime}). Because p′superscript𝑝′p^{\\prime} is on the boundary of △​(a,b,p)△𝑎𝑏𝑝\\triangle(a,b,p), π​(s,a)⊆π​(s,p′)𝜋𝑠𝑎𝜋𝑠superscript𝑝′\\pi(s,a)\\subseteq\\pi(s,p^{\\prime}) and q𝑞q is on the boundary of △​(a,b,p)△𝑎𝑏𝑝\\triangle(a,b,p). Since p′superscript𝑝′p^{\\prime} is in π​(b,p)𝜋𝑏𝑝\\pi(b,p), which is the opposite side of the apex a𝑎a, q𝑞q cannot be on π​(b,p)𝜋𝑏𝑝\\pi(b,p) and thus must be on π​(a,p)∪π​(a,b)𝜋𝑎𝑝𝜋𝑎𝑏\\pi(a,p)\\cup\\pi(a,b). Note that π​(a,b)=π​(a,ps​t)∪π​(ps​t,b)𝜋𝑎𝑏𝜋𝑎subscript𝑝𝑠𝑡𝜋subscript𝑝𝑠𝑡𝑏\\pi(a,b)=\\pi(a,p_{st})\\cup\\pi(p_{st},b). Our goal is to prove d​(s,z)>d​(z,p′)𝑑𝑠𝑧𝑑𝑧superscript𝑝′d(s,z)>d(z,p^{\\prime}).\nAssume to the contrary that d​(s,z)≤d​(z,p′)𝑑𝑠𝑧𝑑𝑧superscript𝑝′d(s,z)\\leq d(z,p^{\\prime}). In the following we will obtain d​(s,p)>d​(t,p)𝑑𝑠𝑝𝑑𝑡𝑝d(s,p)>d(t,p), which incurs contradiction as p∈B​(s,t)𝑝𝐵𝑠𝑡p\\in B(s,t).\nDepending on whether q𝑞q is in π​(a,p)∪π​(a,ps​t)𝜋𝑎𝑝𝜋𝑎subscript𝑝𝑠𝑡\\pi(a,p)\\cup\\pi(a,p_{st}) and π​(ps​t,b)∖{ps​t}𝜋subscript𝑝𝑠𝑡𝑏subscript𝑝𝑠𝑡\\pi(p_{st},b)\\setminus\\{p_{st}\\}, there are two cases. We first show that the latter case can be reduced to the former case. If q∈π​(ps​t,b)∖{ps​t}𝑞𝜋subscript𝑝𝑠𝑡𝑏subscript𝑝𝑠𝑡q\\in\\pi(p_{st},b)\\setminus\\{p_{st}\\}, then z=ps​t𝑧subscript𝑝𝑠𝑡z=p_{st}; e.g., see Fig. 10. Hence, d​(z,b)≤d​(t,z)=d​(s,z)≤d​(z,p′)𝑑𝑧𝑏𝑑𝑡𝑧𝑑𝑠𝑧𝑑𝑧superscript𝑝′d(z,b)\\leq d(t,z)=d(s,z)\\leq d(z,p^{\\prime}).\nIf we move a point x𝑥x on π​(b,p)𝜋𝑏𝑝\\pi(b,p) from b𝑏b to p𝑝p, then d​(s,x)𝑑𝑠𝑥d(s,x) is strictly convex  (see the proof of Lemma 1), and more precisely, d​(s,x)𝑑𝑠𝑥d(s,x) first strictly decreases until a point x∗superscript𝑥x^{*} and then strictly increases. We claim that x∗∈π​(b,p′)superscript𝑥𝜋𝑏superscript𝑝′x^{*}\\in\\pi(b,p^{\\prime}). Indeed, assume to the contrary that x∗∈π​(p′,p)superscript𝑥𝜋superscript𝑝′𝑝x^{*}\\in\\pi(p^{\\prime},p). Then, we can obtain d​(s,p′)<d​(s,b)𝑑𝑠superscript𝑝′𝑑𝑠𝑏d(s,p^{\\prime})<d(s,b). Because both π​(s,p′)𝜋𝑠superscript𝑝′\\pi(s,p^{\\prime}) and π​(s,b)𝜋𝑠𝑏\\pi(s,b) contain z𝑧z, we derive that d​(z,p′)<d​(z,b)𝑑𝑧superscript𝑝′𝑑𝑧𝑏d(z,p^{\\prime})<d(z,b), which contradicts with d​(z,p′)≥d​(z,b)𝑑𝑧superscript𝑝′𝑑𝑧𝑏d(z,p^{\\prime})\\geq d(z,b). Due to the above claim, as we move x𝑥x from p′superscript𝑝′p^{\\prime} to p𝑝p along π​(p′,p)𝜋superscript𝑝′𝑝\\pi(p^{\\prime},p), π​(s,x)𝜋𝑠𝑥\\pi(s,x) will strictly increase. We stop moving x𝑥x when x​x′¯¯𝑥superscript𝑥′\\overline{xx^{\\prime}} contains ps​tsubscript𝑝𝑠𝑡p_{st} (e.g., see Fig. 10), where x′superscript𝑥′x^{\\prime} is the anchor of x𝑥x in π​(s,x)𝜋𝑠𝑥\\pi(s,x). Note that such a moment must exist as π​(s,p)𝜋𝑠𝑝\\pi(s,p) does not contain ps​tsubscript𝑝𝑠𝑡p_{st}. As ps​t∈π​(s,p′)subscript𝑝𝑠𝑡𝜋𝑠superscript𝑝′p_{st}\\in\\pi(s,p^{\\prime}), z𝑧z is still ps​tsubscript𝑝𝑠𝑡p_{st}. Since d​(s,x)>d​(s,p′)𝑑𝑠𝑥𝑑𝑠superscript𝑝′d(s,x)>d(s,p^{\\prime}) and both π​(s,x)𝜋𝑠𝑥\\pi(s,x) and π​(s,p′)𝜋𝑠superscript𝑝′\\pi(s,p^{\\prime}) contain z𝑧z, we can obtain that d​(z,p′)<d​(z,x)𝑑𝑧superscript𝑝′𝑑𝑧𝑥d(z,p^{\\prime})<d(z,x). As d​(s,z)≤d​(z,p′)𝑑𝑠𝑧𝑑𝑧superscript𝑝′d(s,z)\\leq d(z,p^{\\prime}), we deduce that d​(s,z)≤d​(z,x)𝑑𝑠𝑧𝑑𝑧𝑥d(s,z)\\leq d(z,x). Now we obtain an instance of the first case (i.e., q∈π​(a,p)∪π​(a,ps​t)𝑞𝜋𝑎𝑝𝜋𝑎subscript𝑝𝑠𝑡q\\in\\pi(a,p)\\cup\\pi(a,p_{st})) because x′∈π​(a,ps​t)superscript𝑥′𝜋𝑎subscript𝑝𝑠𝑡x^{\\prime}\\in\\pi(a,p_{st}), i.e., we can consider x𝑥x as a new point p′superscript𝑝′p^{\\prime} and obtain contradiction by using the analysis given below for the first case. In the following we consider the case where q∈π​(a,p)∪π​(a,ps​t)𝑞𝜋𝑎𝑝𝜋𝑎subscript𝑝𝑠𝑡q\\in\\pi(a,p)\\cup\\pi(a,p_{st}); e.g., see Fig. 11. In this case, q​p′¯¯𝑞superscript𝑝′\\overline{qp^{\\prime}} intersects B​(s,t)𝐵𝑠𝑡B(s,t) at z𝑧z and thus d​(z,p′)=z​p′¯𝑑𝑧superscript𝑝′¯𝑧superscript𝑝′d(z,p^{\\prime})=\\overline{zp^{\\prime}}. There are two subcases depending on whether q∈π​(a,p)𝑞𝜋𝑎𝑝q\\in\\pi(a,p) or q∈π​(a,ps​t)𝑞𝜋𝑎subscript𝑝𝑠𝑡q\\in\\pi(a,p_{st}). For each case, we will construct a geodesic triangle △​(a′,b′,p)△superscript𝑎′superscript𝑏′𝑝\\triangle(a^{\\prime},b^{\\prime},p) (which may not be in P𝑃P) with the following properties: (1) a′superscript𝑎′a^{\\prime}, b′superscript𝑏′b^{\\prime}, and p𝑝p are its three apexes; (2) the length of the side of △​(a′,b′,p)△superscript𝑎′superscript𝑏′𝑝\\triangle(a^{\\prime},b^{\\prime},p) connecting a′superscript𝑎′a^{\\prime} and p𝑝p, denoted by l​(a′,p)𝑙superscript𝑎′𝑝l(a^{\\prime},p), is at most d​(s,p)𝑑𝑠𝑝d(s,p); (3) the length of the side of △​(a′,b′,p)△superscript𝑎′superscript𝑏′𝑝\\triangle(a^{\\prime},b^{\\prime},p) connecting b′superscript𝑏′b^{\\prime} and p𝑝p, denoted by l​(b′,p)𝑙superscript𝑏′𝑝l(b^{\\prime},p), is equal to d​(b,p)𝑑𝑏𝑝d(b,p); (4) the angle at b′superscript𝑏′b^{\\prime} formed by its two incident edges of △​(a′,b′,p)△superscript𝑎′superscript𝑏′𝑝\\triangle(a^{\\prime},b^{\\prime},p) is at least π/2𝜋2\\pi/2. These properties together lead to d​(s,p)>d​(t,p)𝑑𝑠𝑝𝑑𝑡𝑝d(s,p)>d(t,p). Indeed, due to property (4), it holds that l​(b′,p)<l​(a′,p)𝑙superscript𝑏′𝑝𝑙superscript𝑎′𝑝l(b^{\\prime},p)<l(a^{\\prime},p)  (see Corollary 2). Combining with properties (2) and (3), we have d​(t,p)=l​(b′,p)<l​(a′,p)≤d​(s,p)𝑑𝑡𝑝𝑙superscript𝑏′𝑝𝑙superscript𝑎′𝑝𝑑𝑠𝑝d(t,p)=l(b^{\\prime},p)<l(a^{\\prime},p)\\leq d(s,p). This incurs contradiction since d​(t,p)=d​(s,p)𝑑𝑡𝑝𝑑𝑠𝑝d(t,p)=d(s,p). We begin with the subcase q∈π​(a,p)𝑞𝜋𝑎𝑝q\\in\\pi(a,p); e.g., see Fig. 11(a). We extend p′​q¯¯superscript𝑝′𝑞\\overline{p^{\\prime}q} along the direction from p′superscript𝑝′p^{\\prime} to q𝑞q until a point a′superscript𝑎′a^{\\prime} such that |q​a′¯|=d​(s,q)¯𝑞superscript𝑎′𝑑𝑠𝑞|\\overline{qa^{\\prime}}|=d(s,q); note that q​a′¯¯𝑞superscript𝑎′\\overline{qa^{\\prime}} may not be in P𝑃P. Refer to Fig. 12. Note that π​(p,q)∪q​a′¯𝜋𝑝𝑞¯𝑞superscript𝑎′\\pi(p,q)\\cup\\overline{qa^{\\prime}} is still a convex chain and its length l​(a′,p)𝑙superscript𝑎′𝑝l(a^{\\prime},p) is equal to |q​a′¯|+d​(q,p)=d​(s,q)+d​(q,p)=d​(s,p)¯𝑞superscript𝑎′𝑑𝑞𝑝𝑑𝑠𝑞𝑑𝑞𝑝𝑑𝑠𝑝|\\overline{qa^{\\prime}}|+d(q,p)=d(s,q)+d(q,p)=d(s,p). Let p′′superscript𝑝′′p^{\\prime\\prime} be the vertex of π​(p′,p)𝜋superscript𝑝′𝑝\\pi(p^{\\prime},p) incident to p′superscript𝑝′p^{\\prime}. We extend p′′​p′¯¯superscript𝑝′′superscript𝑝′\\overline{p^{\\prime\\prime}p^{\\prime}} along the direction from p′′superscript𝑝′′p^{\\prime\\prime} to p′superscript𝑝′p^{\\prime} until a point b′superscript𝑏′b^{\\prime} such that |p′​b′¯|=d​(t,p′)¯superscript𝑝′superscript𝑏′𝑑𝑡superscript𝑝′|\\overline{p^{\\prime}b^{\\prime}}|=d(t,p^{\\prime}). Note that π​(p,p′)∪p′​b′¯𝜋𝑝superscript𝑝′¯superscript𝑝′superscript𝑏′\\pi(p,p^{\\prime})\\cup\\overline{p^{\\prime}b^{\\prime}} is still a convex chain and its length l​(b′,p)𝑙superscript𝑏′𝑝l(b^{\\prime},p) is equal to |p′​b′¯|+d​(p′,p)=d​(t,p′)+d​(p′,p)=d​(t,p)¯superscript𝑝′superscript𝑏′𝑑superscript𝑝′𝑝𝑑𝑡superscript𝑝′𝑑superscript𝑝′𝑝𝑑𝑡𝑝|\\overline{p^{\\prime}b^{\\prime}}|+d(p^{\\prime},p)=d(t,p^{\\prime})+d(p^{\\prime},p)=d(t,p). In the following we show that the angle ∠​(p′,b′,a′)∠superscript𝑝′superscript𝑏′superscript𝑎′\\angle(p^{\\prime},b^{\\prime},a^{\\prime}) is at least π/2𝜋2\\pi/2; this will prove all four properties described above for the geodesic triangle △​(a′,b′,p)△superscript𝑎′superscript𝑏′𝑝\\triangle(a^{\\prime},b^{\\prime},p). We claim that |z​b′¯|≤d​(z,t)¯𝑧superscript𝑏′𝑑𝑧𝑡|\\overline{zb^{\\prime}}|\\leq d(z,t). Before proving the claim, we first show ∠​(p′,b′,a′)≥π/2∠superscript𝑝′superscript𝑏′superscript𝑎′𝜋2\\angle(p^{\\prime},b^{\\prime},a^{\\prime})\\geq\\pi/2 by using the claim. Indeed, notice that |z​a′¯|=|z​q¯|+|q​a′¯|=|z​q¯|+d​(s,q)=d​(s,z)¯𝑧superscript𝑎′¯𝑧𝑞¯𝑞superscript𝑎′¯𝑧𝑞𝑑𝑠𝑞𝑑𝑠𝑧|\\overline{za^{\\prime}}|=|\\overline{zq}|+|\\overline{qa^{\\prime}}|=|\\overline{zq}|+d(s,q)=d(s,z). As z∈B​(s,t)𝑧𝐵𝑠𝑡z\\in B(s,t), d​(s,z)=d​(t,z)𝑑𝑠𝑧𝑑𝑡𝑧d(s,z)=d(t,z). Hence, |z​a′¯|≥|z​b′¯|¯𝑧superscript𝑎′¯𝑧superscript𝑏′|\\overline{za^{\\prime}}|\\geq|\\overline{zb^{\\prime}}|. Recall that d​(s,z)≤d​(z,p′)=|z​p′¯|𝑑𝑠𝑧𝑑𝑧superscript𝑝′¯𝑧superscript𝑝′d(s,z)\\leq d(z,p^{\\prime})=|\\overline{zp^{\\prime}}|. Therefore, we have |z​p′¯|≥|z​a′¯|≥|z​b′¯|¯𝑧superscript𝑝′¯𝑧superscript𝑎′¯𝑧superscript𝑏′|\\overline{zp^{\\prime}}|\\geq|\\overline{za^{\\prime}}|\\geq|\\overline{zb^{\\prime}}|. If we draw a circle centered at z𝑧z with radius equal to |z​a′¯|¯𝑧superscript𝑎′|\\overline{za^{\\prime}}|, then a′superscript𝑎′a^{\\prime} is on the circle, b′superscript𝑏′b^{\\prime} is inside or on the circle, and p′superscript𝑝′p^{\\prime} is outside or on the circle. Since a′​p′¯¯superscript𝑎′superscript𝑝′\\overline{a^{\\prime}p^{\\prime}} contains a diameter of the circle, we obtain that ∠​(p′,b′,a′)≥π/2∠superscript𝑝′superscript𝑏′superscript𝑎′𝜋2\\angle(p^{\\prime},b^{\\prime},a^{\\prime})\\geq\\pi/2. We proceed to prove the claim |z​b′¯|≤d​(z,t)¯𝑧superscript𝑏′𝑑𝑧𝑡|\\overline{zb^{\\prime}}|\\leq d(z,t).\nNotice that p′​b′¯¯superscript𝑝′superscript𝑏′\\overline{p^{\\prime}b^{\\prime}} must intersect π​(z,b)𝜋𝑧𝑏\\pi(z,b). Indeed, unless p′​b′¯¯superscript𝑝′superscript𝑏′\\overline{p^{\\prime}b^{\\prime}} contains b𝑏b (in which case it is vacuously true that p′​b′¯¯superscript𝑝′superscript𝑏′\\overline{p^{\\prime}b^{\\prime}} intersects π​(z,b)𝜋𝑧𝑏\\pi(z,b)), as p′​b′¯¯superscript𝑝′superscript𝑏′\\overline{p^{\\prime}b^{\\prime}} is tangent to π​(b,p)𝜋𝑏𝑝\\pi(b,p) at p′superscript𝑝′p^{\\prime}, if we move on p′​b′¯¯superscript𝑝′superscript𝑏′\\overline{p^{\\prime}b^{\\prime}} from p′superscript𝑝′p^{\\prime} towards b′superscript𝑏′b^{\\prime}, we will enter the interior of △​(a,b,p)△𝑎𝑏𝑝\\triangle(a,b,p) and let w𝑤w be the first point on the boundary of △​(a,b,p)△𝑎𝑏𝑝\\triangle(a,b,p) we meet during the above movement after p′superscript𝑝′p^{\\prime} (i.e., we will go outside △​(a,b,p)△𝑎𝑏𝑝\\triangle(a,b,p) after w𝑤w; e.g., see Fig. 12). Then, p′​w¯¯superscript𝑝′𝑤\\overline{p^{\\prime}w} separates z𝑧z and b𝑏b on its two sides, and thus p′​w¯¯superscript𝑝′𝑤\\overline{p^{\\prime}w} must intersect π​(z,b)𝜋𝑧𝑏\\pi(z,b), say, at a point z′superscript𝑧′z^{\\prime}.\nWe next prove |z′​b′¯|≤d​(z′,t)¯superscript𝑧′superscript𝑏′𝑑superscript𝑧′𝑡|\\overline{z^{\\prime}b^{\\prime}}|\\leq d(z^{\\prime},t). Indeed, d​(t,p′)=|p′​b′¯|=|p′​z′¯|+|z′​b′¯|𝑑𝑡superscript𝑝′¯superscript𝑝′superscript𝑏′¯superscript𝑝′superscript𝑧′¯superscript𝑧′superscript𝑏′d(t,p^{\\prime})=|\\overline{p^{\\prime}b^{\\prime}}|=|\\overline{p^{\\prime}z^{\\prime}}|+|\\overline{z^{\\prime}b^{\\prime}}|. On the other hand, by triangle inequality, d​(t,p′)≤|p′​z′¯|+d​(z′,t)𝑑𝑡superscript𝑝′¯superscript𝑝′superscript𝑧′𝑑superscript𝑧′𝑡d(t,p^{\\prime})\\leq|\\overline{p^{\\prime}z^{\\prime}}|+d(z^{\\prime},t). Hence, we obtain |z′​b′¯|≤d​(z′,t)¯superscript𝑧′superscript𝑏′𝑑superscript𝑧′𝑡|\\overline{z^{\\prime}b^{\\prime}}|\\leq d(z^{\\prime},t). Consequently, by triangle inequality, |z​b′¯|≤d​(z,z′)+|z′​b′¯|≤d​(z,z′)+d​(z′,t)=d​(z,t)¯𝑧superscript𝑏′𝑑𝑧superscript𝑧′¯superscript𝑧′superscript𝑏′𝑑𝑧superscript𝑧′𝑑superscript𝑧′𝑡𝑑𝑧𝑡|\\overline{zb^{\\prime}}|\\leq d(z,z^{\\prime})+|\\overline{z^{\\prime}b^{\\prime}}|\\leq d(z,z^{\\prime})+d(z^{\\prime},t)=d(z,t). This proves the claim. The above proves the first subcase q∈π​(a,p)𝑞𝜋𝑎𝑝q\\in\\pi(a,p). We next discuss the subcase q∈π​(a,ps​t)𝑞𝜋𝑎subscript𝑝𝑠𝑡q\\in\\pi(a,p_{st}); e.g., see Fig. 11(b). The analysis is somewhat similar. First of all, we define b′superscript𝑏′b^{\\prime} in the same way as above; by the same argument, we have: (1) π​(p,p′)∪p′​b′¯𝜋𝑝superscript𝑝′¯superscript𝑝′superscript𝑏′\\pi(p,p^{\\prime})\\cup\\overline{p^{\\prime}b^{\\prime}} is a convex chain and its length is equal to d​(p,b)𝑑𝑝𝑏d(p,b); (2) |z​b′¯|≤d​(z,t)¯𝑧superscript𝑏′𝑑𝑧𝑡|\\overline{zb^{\\prime}}|\\leq d(z,t). The point a′superscript𝑎′a^{\\prime} is now defined in a slightly different way. Refer to Fig. 13. We extend p′​q¯¯superscript𝑝′𝑞\\overline{p^{\\prime}q} from p′superscript𝑝′p^{\\prime} to q𝑞q until a point a′superscript𝑎′a^{\\prime} that satisfies the following two conditions: (1) |q​a′¯|≥d​(s,q)¯𝑞superscript𝑎′𝑑𝑠𝑞|\\overline{qa^{\\prime}}|\\geq d(s,q); (2) p′​a′¯¯superscript𝑝′superscript𝑎′\\overline{p^{\\prime}a^{\\prime}} intersects π​(a,p)𝜋𝑎𝑝\\pi(a,p), say, at a point q′superscript𝑞′q^{\\prime} (this is possible as p′​q¯¯superscript𝑝′𝑞\\overline{p^{\\prime}q} is tangent to π​(a,ps​t)𝜋𝑎subscript𝑝𝑠𝑡\\pi(a,p_{st}) at q𝑞q). Note that a′=q′superscript𝑎′superscript𝑞′a^{\\prime}=q^{\\prime} if and only if |q​q′¯|≥d​(s,q)¯𝑞superscript𝑞′𝑑𝑠𝑞|\\overline{qq^{\\prime}}|\\geq d(s,q). Also note that |q​a′¯|=d​(s,q)¯𝑞superscript𝑎′𝑑𝑠𝑞|\\overline{qa^{\\prime}}|=d(s,q) if a′≠q′superscript𝑎′superscript𝑞′a^{\\prime}\\neq q^{\\prime}. Next we prove the four properties of the geodesic triangle △​(a′,b′,p)△superscript𝑎′superscript𝑏′𝑝\\triangle(a^{\\prime},b^{\\prime},p). First of all, notice that |a′​z¯|=|a′​q¯|+|q​z¯|≥d​(s,q)+|q​z¯|=d​(s,z)¯superscript𝑎′𝑧¯superscript𝑎′𝑞¯𝑞𝑧𝑑𝑠𝑞¯𝑞𝑧𝑑𝑠𝑧|\\overline{a^{\\prime}z}|=|\\overline{a^{\\prime}q}|+|\\overline{qz}|\\geq d(s,q)+|\\overline{qz}|=d(s,z). Recall that |z​b′¯|≤d​(t,z)=d​(s,z)¯𝑧superscript𝑏′𝑑𝑡𝑧𝑑𝑠𝑧|\\overline{zb^{\\prime}}|\\leq d(t,z)=d(s,z) and d​(s,z)≤|z​p′¯|𝑑𝑠𝑧¯𝑧superscript𝑝′d(s,z)\\leq|\\overline{zp^{\\prime}}|. By a similar argument as before for the first subcase, the angle ∠​(a′,b′,p′)∠superscript𝑎′superscript𝑏′superscript𝑝′\\angle(a^{\\prime},b^{\\prime},p^{\\prime}) is at least π/2𝜋2\\pi/2. By the definitions of a′superscript𝑎′a^{\\prime} and q′superscript𝑞′q^{\\prime}, π​(p,q′)∪q′​a′¯𝜋𝑝superscript𝑞′¯superscript𝑞′superscript𝑎′\\pi(p,q^{\\prime})\\cup\\overline{q^{\\prime}a^{\\prime}} is a convex chain and we will show below that its length l​(a′,p)𝑙superscript𝑎′𝑝l(a^{\\prime},p) is at most d​(s,p)𝑑𝑠𝑝d(s,p), which will prove all four properties of △​(a′,b′,p)△superscript𝑎′superscript𝑏′𝑝\\triangle(a^{\\prime},b^{\\prime},p). To prove l​(a′,p)≤d​(s,p)𝑙superscript𝑎′𝑝𝑑𝑠𝑝l(a^{\\prime},p)\\leq d(s,p), as l​(a′,p)=|a′​q′¯|+d​(q′,p)𝑙superscript𝑎′𝑝¯superscript𝑎′superscript𝑞′𝑑superscript𝑞′𝑝l(a^{\\prime},p)=|\\overline{a^{\\prime}q^{\\prime}}|+d(q^{\\prime},p) and d​(s,p)=d​(s,q′)+d​(q′,p)𝑑𝑠𝑝𝑑𝑠superscript𝑞′𝑑superscript𝑞′𝑝d(s,p)=d(s,q^{\\prime})+d(q^{\\prime},p), it is sufficient to prove |a′​q′¯|≤d​(s,q′)¯superscript𝑎′superscript𝑞′𝑑𝑠superscript𝑞′|\\overline{a^{\\prime}q^{\\prime}}|\\leq d(s,q^{\\prime}). If a′=q′superscript𝑎′superscript𝑞′a^{\\prime}=q^{\\prime}, this is obviously true. We thus assume a′≠q′superscript𝑎′superscript𝑞′a^{\\prime}\\neq q^{\\prime}. Then, |q​q′¯|<|q​a′¯|=d​(s,q)¯𝑞superscript𝑞′¯𝑞superscript𝑎′𝑑𝑠𝑞|\\overline{qq^{\\prime}}|<|\\overline{qa^{\\prime}}|=d(s,q). Hence, d​(s,p′)=d​(s,q)+|q​p′¯|=|q​a′¯|+|q​p′¯|=|a′​p′¯|=|a′​q′¯|+|q′​p′¯|𝑑𝑠superscript𝑝′𝑑𝑠𝑞¯𝑞superscript𝑝′¯𝑞superscript𝑎′¯𝑞superscript𝑝′¯superscript𝑎′superscript𝑝′¯superscript𝑎′superscript𝑞′¯superscript𝑞′superscript𝑝′d(s,p^{\\prime})=d(s,q)+|\\overline{qp^{\\prime}}|=|\\overline{qa^{\\prime}}|+|\\overline{qp^{\\prime}}|=|\\overline{a^{\\prime}p^{\\prime}}|=|\\overline{a^{\\prime}q^{\\prime}}|+|\\overline{q^{\\prime}p^{\\prime}}|. On the other hand, by triangle inequality, d​(s,p′)≤d​(s,q′)+|q′​p′¯|𝑑𝑠superscript𝑝′𝑑𝑠superscript𝑞′¯superscript𝑞′superscript𝑝′d(s,p^{\\prime})\\leq d(s,q^{\\prime})+|\\overline{q^{\\prime}p^{\\prime}}|. Therefore, we obtain |a′​q′¯|≤d​(s,q′)¯superscript𝑎′superscript𝑞′𝑑𝑠superscript𝑞′|\\overline{a^{\\prime}q^{\\prime}}|\\leq d(s,q^{\\prime}). The above proves the second subcase q∈π​(a,ps​t)𝑞𝜋𝑎subscript𝑝𝑠𝑡q\\in\\pi(a,p_{st}).
