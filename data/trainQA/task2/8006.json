      "content": "Paper Title: X-Former: Unifying Contrastive and Reconstruction Learning for MLLMs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in diverse natural language tasks  4, prompting researchers to explore the integration of visual understanding capabilities into these models, leading to multimodal LLMs (MLLMs).\nMLLMs aim to leverage the vast knowledge contained within off-the-shelf LLMs and vision encoders to tackle complex visual understanding tasks, thereby opening up new possibilities in the domain of vision-language understanding.\nFlamingo¬† is one of the early MLLMs to align frozen visual encoders to LLMs, where it introduces a Perceiver Resampler module to extract a fixed set of features from image by optimizing image-to-text generation loss, in order to bridge the modality gap.\nImproving upon Flamingo, BLIP-2¬†6 proposed a Querying Transformer (Q-Former) that performs vision-language alignment through cross modality fusion by employing both discriminative (contrastive & classification) and generative (image-to-text generation) losses to extract a fixed set of most useful visual features for LLM.\nOther concurrent works¬†9 9 have explored different strategies to align visual representations with LLM input space for improving vision-language understanding. It is noteworthy that all aforementioned MLLMs employ CLIP-ViT  as the vision encoder, hence, inherit its limitations including: (i) poor fine-grained vision-language alignment , and (ii) spatially-invariant global representations¬†. As a consequence, these models struggle to encode detailed visual nuances, including object orientation, structural intricacies, spatial relationships, and multiple object instances¬†[ref]39, thereby hindering the ability of LLMs to comprehend local visual patterns.\nTo alleviate this issue, there has been growing interest to learn better visual representations for MLLMs.\nFor instance, Shikra¬† proposes to learn visual grounding for objects by adding spatial coordinates in natural language for LLM. However, this requires high-quality curated data with bounding box annotations referring to the objects in the image. GVT¬†1 on the other hand distills features from pre-trained CLIP  via L1subscriptùêø1L_{1} loss and uses the distilled model as the image encoder for extracting visual tokens. However, this approach relies on instruction tuning utilizing LLaVA-150k¬†9 dataset. Most recently, MMVP[ref]39 proposes to leverage self-supervised pre-trained vision encoder along with CLIP-ViT to learn Mixture of Features from multiple encoders in LLaVA framework with LLM fine-tuning. However, they do instruction tuning with LLaVA-150k¬†9 dataset. Therefore, its not clear whether such an approach can work on commonly available image-text data without relying on instruction tuning using curated datasets.\nAn additional avenue of exploration involves constructing a self-supervised vision encoder capable of capturing both global, semantically enriched, and local, detailed visual features. The central concept involves linearly combining the training objectives of CL  and MIM [ref]15. This is motivated by the fact that MIM can effectively capture local and high-frequency representations, complementing the global and low-frequency representations captured by CL. However, this hasn‚Äôt been explored for vision-laguage understanding and is also the focus of this work. In this paper, we present X-Former, a lightweight transformer module designed to achieve effective vision-language alignment from both a global and local perspective.\nParticularly, X-Former adopts a two-stage training approach. The first stage involves vision-language representation learning and multimodal-to-multimodal generative learning by leveraging two frozen image encoders. Specifically, X-Former utilizes learnable query vectors to extract visual features by utilizing both CLIP-ViT  and MAE-ViT [ref]15 encoders as well as employ a dual cross-attention module to dynamically fuse the extracted features. Aimed at image reconstruction and text generation, X-Former is incentivized to extract visual features covering both low frequency and high frequency. Our main technical contributions can be summarized as: We propose to leverage vision encoders from CL¬† and MIM¬†[ref]15 to capture both global and local visual representations from frozen image encoders to improve vision-language understanding. We introduce X-Former with dual cross-attention to bootstrap multimodal-to-multimodal generative learning using image-text pairs, entirely without the need for curated or visual instruction data. Empirical studies showcase the notable enhancement of our model in fine-grained visual perception tasks that demand a nuanced understanding of visual details. Specifically, in object counting tasks, X-Former demonstrates substantial improvement over BLIP-2 6 (39.64 vs. 34.3 on COCO and 27.24 vs. 18.9 on VCR). Further, we perform fine-grained analysis comparing the image-text queries of our model and BLIP-2 to demonstrate our approach learns more diverse queries over BLIP-2 indicating the ability to capture detailed visual features.\nIt‚Äôs worth noting that BLIP-2 is pre-trained on a dataset of 129 Million image-text pairs, approximately 10√ó10\\times larger than the dataset used for training X-Former (14 Million). This underscores the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: As a consequence, these models struggle to encode detailed visual nuances, including object orientation, structural intricacies, spatial relationships, and multiple object instances¬†[ref]39, thereby hindering the ability of LLMs to comprehend local visual patterns.\nTo alleviate this issue, there has been growing interest to learn better visual representations for MLLMs.\nFor\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
