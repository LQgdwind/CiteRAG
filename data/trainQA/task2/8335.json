      "content": "Paper Title: Impact-Aware Control using Time-Invariant Reference Spreading\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, a handful of dedicated control methods have been developed to tackle the execution of motions that include impacts while avoiding unwanted spikes in the control inputs. As an example,    defines the tracking error through a distance function that includes knowledge on the predicted velocity jump, removing the velocity tracking error peak caused by a mismatch between the planned and actual impact timing. Similarly,  performs tracking control of a bouncing ball using an additional mirrored reference to address a possible impact timing mismatch, in this case assuming a fully elastic impact.\nAn explicit transition phase is defined in  to perform tracking control during contact transitions with chattering caused by impacts.\nAlternatively,  projects the velocity tracking error onto a subspace that is invariant to the impact event, temporarily removing velocity feedback for the control objectives affected by the impact, but retaining full control over all remaining control objectives. The removal of unwanted input spikes caused by impacts has also been addressed by the framework of reference spreading (RS)   . RS, as introduced in  and expanded in     and references therein for single impact scenarios, is a hybrid tracking control approach that deals with impacts by defining ante- and post-impact references as a function of time that are coupled by an impact map at the nominal impact time, and overlap about this time.\nIt is ensured that the reference corresponds with the actual contact state of the robot by switching the reference based on impact detection, which avoids error peaking and related spikes in the control inputs. In , a strategy to deal with simultaneous impacts is proposed, defining an interim-impact mode that uses only feedforward signals as long as contact is only partially established. This framework is extended in  by also using position feedback during the interim mode to pursue persistent contact establishment without relying on velocity feedback.\nWhile  and  only included a numerical validation based on simulations, an experimental validation of RS for simultaneous impacts is provided in  using a dual-arm robotic setup targeted to perform a quick grabbing maneuver. Furthermore, the approaches in   are cast into the quadratic programming (QP) robot control framework  , similar to other impact-aware QP control approaches like  . This allows to include constraints ensuring for example collision avoidance and adherence to joint limits away from impacts, which are essential in real applications. While     use traditional time-based references, [ref]33 has introduced a time-invariant version of RS, which has been extended in  for dual-arm manipulation, and will be further extended in this work as highlighted in Section I-B. As opposed to time-based tracking, the time-invariant nature of this approach enjoys the positive features of path following , maneuver regulation  and dynamical systems  approaches, preventing the systems to unnecessarily accelerate or decelerate in the presence of disturbances and deviations caused by temporary collision avoidance or conflicting tasks.\nThe approach also suits a large range of initial conditions without requiring replanning of the reference due to the absence of a predefined path that is to be followed as with traditional tracking control.\nThe references in [ref]33  are prescribed by desired ante- and post-impact vector fields, which overlap in position around the surface where the impact is expected to occur, to make sure a reference corresponding to the contact state is also at hand when the impact occurs away from this expected surface. At this surface, the ante- and post-impact velocity fields are coupled by an impact map [ref]16 . In [ref]33 , the interim mode control developed in  is extended to the case of time-invariant reference vector fields, constructing a position feedback signal through time integration of the ante-impact velocity reference. To promote simultaneity between the impacts for dual-arm manipulation when using with time-invariant references,  also introduces a synchronization approach between the two arms, resulting in a near-simultaneous impact regardless of the initial condition of the robots.\nRecent approaches, like [ref]4 and , focusing on hitting and dual-arm grabbing of objects, respectively, also employ such a time-invariant approach in the context of impact-aware manipulation and originate from the well-known framework of dynamical systems-based robot control  . These approaches, however, focus on motion generation and not on control challenges such as the removal of impact-induced input peaks, and are thus complementary to the present work. While a numerical validation of time-invariant RS using simulations is provided in [ref]33 , no experimental validation has yet been performed. As mentioned before, both time-based and time-invariant RS rely on an impact map to ensure that the velocity jump embedded in the ante- and post-impact references matches that of the real system. This impact map can be determined in different ways. For systems involving only a few degrees of freedom and a few contact points, an analytical impact map can be determined, which forms a closed-form expression to determine the post-impact velocity as a function of the ante-impact configuration and velocity. This method has been used in      while developing and validating the RS approach. However, such an approach is not scalable to complex and realistic scenarios that could emerge in real applications. Alternatively,  extracts the impact map from physical experiments. This removes the need of computing the impact map, but is also not scalable to situations where impacts are expected to happen with previously unhandled objects or in different configurations, potentially unknown a priori. An approach to extract the impact map from a set of simulations was proposed in , using it for a time-invariant RS approach and validating the approach through a different set of simulations. The potential of using a physics engine based on nonsmooth mechanics to compute a rigid impact map has been confirmed in  by validating this computed impact map against a set of physical experiments. The validation in  showed only a 3.55% average mismatch between the predicted velocity jump and the experimentally identified velocity jump for a set of dual-arm grabbing and hit-and-push motions, which is deemed sufficiently low to be reliably applied within the RS framework. The experimental validation of time-invariant RS presented in this work will therefore use the simulation-based approach developed in  to compute the rigid impact map.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: constraints ensuring for example collision avoidance and adherence to joint limits away from impacts, which are essential in real applications.
