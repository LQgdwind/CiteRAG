      "content": "Paper Title: Geometric Multimodal Deep Learning with Multi-Scaled Graph Wavelet Convolutional Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe primary purpose of the proposed method is generalizing graph convolutional neural networks for multimodal problems. This experiment evaluates the effectiveness of the M-GWCN method for multimodal data. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conduct M-GWCN for the classification of multimodal implicit graph-based data on two categories of benchmark problems, including multimodal and multi-view datasets. These categories consist of two multimodal datasets, Caltech and NUS, and three multi-view datasets, Caltech101-7, Caltech101-20, and MNIST, as introduced in [ref]18. In these datasets, each modality is implicitly defined as a graph. In the first experiment, we evaluate M-GWCN on multimodal datasets in a more practical scenario, without any predefined knowledge among modalities. To ensure this property, we randomly shuffle the order of data samples in each modality, which makes the point-wise correspondences between the original modalities unknown. We compare the efficiency of M-GWCN with most state-of-the-art multimodal data modeling methods including CD (pos) , CD (pos+neg) , SCSMM , m-LSJD [ref]18, m2-LSJD [ref]18, and M2CPC-u . The first experiment conducts M-GWCN on multimodal datasets with the parameters in Table V. In this experiment, data in each modality is portioned to 50%percent5050\\% for training, 30%percent3030\\% for validation, and 20%percent2020\\% for testing. The maximum number of training epochs is 200002000020000, and the training phase will be terminated if the validation loss does not decrease for 100100100 consecutive epochs. Experimental results over 101010 randomly data splits are repeated in terms of mean accuracy and standard deviations. Parameters of other methods are chosen according to their respective paper. Table VI reports the performance of M-GWCN in terms of mean and standard deviation of accuracies, and compares it with baselines. Among these compared methods, M2CPC-u has the most similar experimental settings with M-GWCN because it lakes prior correspondence knowledge. Although other methods have been developed for multimodal datasets, they still are more or less dependent on prior knowledge about correspondences among modalities. In the respective papers of methods CD (pos), CD (pos+neg), m-LSJD, and m2-LSJD, the rate of dependency is defined based on the ratio of the number of given corresponding samples to the total number of samples (in percent). To get closer to a fair comparison, we consider the correspondence ratio as minimum as possible (10%percent1010\\%) in all mentioned methods. According to classification accuracies reported in Table VI, M-GWCN achieves a significant improvement and consistently outperforms other methods. These results indicate the superiority of the proposed graph convolutional network in effectively finding the cross-modal correlations in absence of given coupling/decoupling information between various modalities. The M-GWCN is able to represent feature vectors of each modality based on the correlated wavelet bases on other modalities. This capability enables it to be not only successfully applicable to the multimodal graph-based data, but also usable efficiently independent of initial correspondence information. Since in many multimodal methods, the correspondences among modalities are predetermined, for more experiments, we evaluate the performance of our proposed network on the multi-view datasets. Therefore, in the second experiment, we use MV-GWCN as a particular version of M-GWCN and conduct it on multi-view graph-based datasets, according to parameters listed in Table VII. The other settings are similar to the first experiment. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method on multi-view datasets, we compare the efficiency of MV-GWCN with some existing methods evaluated on mentioned multi-view datasets. The state-of-the-art methods used for comparison include MLDA , MLDA-m , MULDA , MULDA-m , MvMDA [ref]39, OGMA , OMLDA , OMvMDA , and M2CPC-p . Table VIII reports the classification accuracy obtained by the M-GWCN compared with different multimodal problems on three multi-view datasets. In this table, MV-GWCN-1 indicates the proposed method with only one and the first scale mentioned in Table VII. Similarly, MV-GWCN-2 is based on both scales. As can be seen from Table VIII, MV-GWCN consistently outperforms other methods. According to these results, although our proposed method achieves the best accuracy among all methods on all multi-view datasets, the differences between their accuracies are not as significant as multimodal datasets. The main reason is that on multi-view datasets, the knowledge of correspondence is predetermined and corresponded samples can be fused into a joint latent space for boosting the classification, which improvs accuracy without needing to explore the cross-modality correlations. When exploring the cross-modality correlations for discovering the correspondences among various modalities is a necessity, because of the lack of this type of prior knowledge, the superiority of our proposed method is proved to be more significant. In the last experiment, we develop new network architectures based on several conventional graph convolutional networks for applying to multi-view datasets. The architecture of these developed networks, that are named with a prefix ’M’ in Table IX to show this extension, is simple. Similar to MV-GWCN, each modality is represented through K layers using a specific graph convolutional network, and then embedded features in each modality are fused into a joint layer to have better representation based on all modalities. In this way, we evaluate the abilities of various graph convolutional networks in both feature mapping in each modality as well as cross-modal feature fusion, and then compare these networks with MV-GWCN, which takes advantage of graph wavelet bases abilities. The classification results of various graph convolutional networks on multi-view datasets are shown in Table IX. The results reported in this table demonstrate the superiority of applying wavelet bases on GNNs with similar modality fusion idea. These results confirm the effectiveness of applying wavelet bases in simultaneously representing each modality and utilizing correlation among all modalities efficiently.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: multimodal and multi-view datasets.
