      "content": "Paper Title: Improved Stock Price Movement Classification Using News Articles Based on Embeddings and Label Smoothing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStock price movement prediction has become an increasingly studied topic among the NLP researchers working to understand the volatile behavior of financial markets. With the recent development of natural language processing, automatic sentiment analysis has become highly accurate. Several studies have developed a number of techniques that tried to predict the stock price movement based on sentiment. For example, Bollen et al. utilized OpinionFinder  to find the positive and negative sentiment of tweets. They also used GPOMS to measure six different human moods from the same tweets in order to predict the closing values from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). While these type of features can be used to classify sentiment of a text, it is now possible to extract useful information from news articles and other text based content in the form of continuous vectors. More formally, these fixed-length vectors are called embeddings of the texts. These embedding vectors allow numerical computations as they usually contain rich semantic information extracted from the contexts . Word2Vec is an algorithm designed to create trained word embeddings. These embeddings help define the meanings of words by producing a mathematical representation of the word. This representation can then be used to capture relationships with other words using similarity functions like dot product, or cosine similarity. Word2Vec has been done in two algorithms, Skip-gram or Continous Bag of Words (CBOW) [ref]10. In the Skip-Gram model, it uses a set of sentences (corpus) to predict the neighbors (or contexts) of an input word. In the CBOW method, it predicts the word from the contexts words.\nThe introduction of Word2Vec enabled new NLP models to be developed for sequences like ELMo, an application of bi-directional LSTM, using recurrent neural networks (RNN) like Long Short-term memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). LSTM is a type of RNN that uses input and output gates to address the vanishing gradient problem . GRU is another type of RNN similar to LSTM but with only two gates, a reset gate and update gate, simplifying and speeding up the training [ref]13. With the recent introduction of transformers, many tasks that were considered challenging have become more feasible. For instance, within the last five years, NLP methods involving transformers have surpassed humans on the precision recall (F1), and exact matching (EM) aspects of reading comprehension questions in the Stanford SQuAD dataset. The majority of methods performing better than humans utilize a transformer system known as BERT. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)[ref]14, is a technique that uses transformer models  to classify an entire piece of text instead of word by word. This means that the vectors that are output from BERT have been encoded to represent the context of the sentence. Hence utilizing transformers allows for contextualized representations of sentencing meanings that allow models to learn easier. Du and Tanaka-Ishii built from Hu et al., one of the first works that applied the attention mechanism to news-driven stock price movement classification. By utilizing Word2Vec and BERT to create a dual representation of the headlines of articles, Du and Tanaka-Ishii classified the price of a stock in a bi-directional GRU and used a multilayer perceptron for the binary classification. However, they did not explore how deep learning techniques such as batch normalization and label smoothing can further improve generalization. Batch normalization reduces the internal covariance shift of the model through a normalization step that fixes the distribution of layer inputs, thus reducing the dependence of gradients on the scale of the parameters or their initial values . Label smoothing replaces one-hot encoded (0 or 1) targets with soft targets during calculation of the loss. These soft targets are a linear combination the original labels with a uniform distribution, and were first shown by Szegedy et al.  to significantly improve model generalization. We therefore seek to investigate how these popular and previously effective deep-learning techniques impact the work of Du et al.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: used to capture relationships with other words using similarity functions like dot product, or cosine similarity.
