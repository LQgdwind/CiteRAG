      "content": "Paper Title: EDoG: Adversarial Edge Detection For Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in many real-world tasks, such as drug screening  [ref]7, protein structure prediction , and social network analysis .\nHowever, recent studies show that GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, where carefully crafted instances are able to mislead machine learning models to make an arbitrarily incorrect prediction. Such vulnerabilities have raised great concerns when applying GNNs to security-critical applications. In particular, different types of attacks targeting on GNNs by adding/deleting a small amount of edges within a target graph have been proposed to fool the node classification or subgraph classification tasks  [ref]53 [ref]54. These attacks are shown to be possible in real world scenarios. For example, as shown in Figure 1, a malicious user can bypass the malicious access detection system by linking himself with other legitimate users . Detecting such adversarial attacks on GNNs involves several challenges.\nFirst, such adversarial attacks focus on local graph properties and aim to create “unnoticeable” perturbations. Therefore, the manipulation of a small number of local edges is not obvious enough to be detected by traditional Sybil detection methods .\nSecond, existing defense/detection methods against adversarial behaviors on machine learning models are not easy to be applied to detect malicious attacks on GNNs for several reasons.\nFor instance, Robust generative models are proposed to mitigate adversarial perturbation via denoising autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) respectively   4; however, subtle adversarial perturbation in graph-structured data is hard to remove directly through generative models due to the discrete nature of graph data.\nThird, the perturbations on a graph will show diverse behaviors due to different factors, which makes it impossible to learn unified rules to identify them, and in-depth understanding of such adversarial behaviors is required. For instance, adding adversarial edges to a node of higher degree will induce different adversarial patterns (adversarial edges in this case are more likely to be outliers) compared with adding them to a node of low degree. Given these challenges, in this paper\nwe propose a general detection pipeline EDoG as shown in Figure 2 to detect different unseen adversarial attacks in GNNs.\nIn particular, we propose several detection strategies as components of EDoG, including Link Prediction based method (LP), Graph Generation based method (GGD), and Outlier Detection based method (OD).\nHere we mainly consider four types of attacks: (1) adding only one adversarial edge ; (2) the number of added adversarial edges is allowed to be up to the degree of a chosen target node, while these adversarial edges are all directly connected to the target node [ref]53; (3) the number of added adversarial edges is allowed to be up to the degree of a chosen target node, while they are not directly connected to the target node [ref]53;(4) the number of added adversarial edges is allowed to be up to a certain percentage (e.g., 5%) of the number of the edges in the original graph [ref]54. We found that adversarial edges in the first type of attacks can be characterized by graph generative models which are trained with a large number of subsampled graphs. Therefore, we propose a novel graph generative model based detection method GGD to detect such adversarial edges. In particular, we first sample a number of subgraphs for training the generative model; and since the original graph contains a small number of adversarial edges, based on the union bound these sub-graphs will not contain malicious edges with high probability. Such generative models can learn useful patterns from subgraphs and detect malicious edges.\nIn addition, we propose to use link prediction models to filter out suspicious edges coarsely to ensure that the generative models are trained on “clean” edges. However, when a larger number of adversarial edges are allowed (i.e., the other three types of attacks), the sampled sub-graphs may contain more adversarial edges and therefore the trained graph generative model and link prediction model are not accurate enough to distinguish the added adversarial edges. In such scenarios, we found that the added adversarial edges are more likely to appear as “outliers,” while the single adversarial edge would not. As a result, we propose a list of intrinsic features that can be leveraged to perform outlier detection (OD), together with GGD and LP. By leveraging the intrinsic tradeoff between the stealthiness (hard to appear as “outliers”) and sparsity (hard to be sampled in subgraphs) of attacks, the proposed EDoG is able to effectively identify adversarial edges effectively based on at least one of these properties.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on three real-world graph datasets including one private transaction rule graph from a major company as well as two types of synthetic graphs (e.g., Erdos-Renyi and scale-free graphs) with controlled properties. We show that OD can achieve detection AUC above 0.9 for the cases when the target nodes have high degree (larger than 10), which means that if we have knowledge about the attack type it is possible to achieve nearly perfect detection rate.\nEven without the knowledge of attack types, our results show that the proposed general pipeline EDoG outperforms other state-of-the-art adversarial edge detection methods 1 3 significantly.\nIn addition, we also evaluate an adaptive attack in which the attacker has full knowledge of our detection pipeline and intentionally aims to bypass it during the attack. We show that the adaptive attack success rate remains very low given our detection pipeline.\nIn summary, we make the following contributions:\n We propose a general light-weighted adversarial edge detection pipeline EDoG on GNNs\nagainst the state-of-the-art GNNs based attacks. In particular, we evaluate EDoG to detect against four adversarial attacks on GNNs without requiring knowledge of the attack strategies. We propose a novel graph generative model and a filter-and-sample framework to train the graph generative model for adversarial edge detection purpose. Based on several interesting observations, we provide a set of effective features on graphs that can be leveraged to perform outlier detection against unseen adversarial attacks as preprocessing. We conduct extensive experiments on Cora, Citeseer, transaction rule graph, and synthetic data with controlled properties to detect the state-of-the-art attacks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline. The detection AUC of EDoG can reach 0.8 without any knowledge of attack types and over 0.85 when we know the attack type. In both scenarios, the proposed EDoG approach\noutperforms other baseline methods. We evaluate EDoG against a strong adaptive attack and show that it is difficult to bypass our detection pipeline.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in many real-world tasks, such as drug screening  [ref]7, protein structure prediction , and social network analysis .\nHowever, recent studies show that GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, where carefully crafted instances are able to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
