      "content": "Paper Title: \\system: Blockchain Fault Tolerance\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOne may think that blockchains¬† are fault tolerant. They are distributed systems replicated across nodes in geodistributed regions making it unlikely to be affected by a single natural disaster. Their nodes often run different implementations of the same protocol, which reduces the risk of having all nodes experiencing the same bug. In particular, blockchain appears as a promising solution to the recent global CrowdStrike outage¬†[ref]19. And finally, the owners of these nodes are typically incentivized through cryptoassets to make their node run actively¬†[ref]52. Blockchains however are often subject to outages. As an example, Solana experienced 9 outages between September 2021 and February 2023 for a cumulative total of 154.5 hours¬†. In terms of service level agreement (SLA) this translates into offering a service whose availability (<99%absentpercent99<99\\%) fails to reach two nines, whereas traditional cloud services offer three nines (‚â•99.9%absentpercent99.9\\geq 99.9\\%). This questions the ability for blockchain technologies to remain available despite faults.\nUnfortunately, previous empirical blockchain comparisons were typically conducted in the absence of failure¬†   . In this paper, we evaluate the fault tolerance of blockchain by\nintroducing a sensitivity metric and designing a tool, called \\system(\\systemlong), that measures the sensitivity of blockchains to dedicated failure patterns.\nFinally, we validate \\systemby\ncomparing the dependability of five modern blockchain systems:\nAlgorand¬†, Aptos¬†, Avalanche¬†, Redbelly¬† and Solana¬†. First, we introduce a new sensitivity metric to assess the fault tolerance of a blockchain.\nIntuitively, the larger the sensitivity score of a blockchain, the least fault tolerant this blockchain is.\nThe sensitivity of a blockchain is computed as the difference between the responsiveness of the blockchain in a baseline environment and in an altered environment.\nInspired by the super-cumulative distribution function (SDF) used in economics¬†, which results from the integral of a cumulative distribution function (CDF), we derive the sensitivity as the difference between two SDFs, the ones representing the response times of a blockchain in a baseline environment and in an adversarial environment. For example, consider Fig.¬†1 that depicts two empirical CDFs (eCDFs) of latencies of the Aptos blockchain\n(we detail the experimental settings in Section¬†3).\nThe first distribution illustrated with the blue curve was observed empirically in a baseline environment without failures. The other distribution illustrated with the light blue curve was observed in an altered environment with failures.\nThe sensitivity score represented as the light red area is the difference of the areas under the two CDFs, also called SDF. Second, equipped with this sensitivity metric, we compare for the first time the fault tolerance of different blockchains.\nThis comparison requires considering blockchains as blackboxes.\nTo this end, we selected five modern blockchain systems, Algorand, Aptos, Avalanche, Redbelly and Solana, for their ability to tolerate\narbitrary (i.e., Byzantine) failures¬†.\nGiven that consensus cannot be solved in the presence of at least n/3ùëõ3n/3 permanent failures in an open network where the bound on message delays is unknown¬†, we study the following properties, where t<n/3ùë°ùëõ3t<n/3, for each blockchain: Resilience: the insensitivity to f=tùëìùë°f=t definitive crash (or fail-stop) failures; Recoverability: the insensitivity to f>tùëìùë°f>t transient (or crash-recovery) failures; Partition tolerance: the insensitivity to a the partition of f>tùëìùë°f>t nodes; and Byzantine fault tolerance: the insensitivity to f=tùëìùë°f=t arbitrary (or Byzantine) failures. Our results demonstrate that fault tolerance varies greatly with the choice of blockchain system. First, we confirm that all of these blockchains, except Redbelly, are significantly affected by failures.\nSecond, we show that Avalanche and Solana cannot tolerate transient failures and stop working.\nFinally, we show how sending duplicated transactions to cope with Byzantine faults can reduce or improve the responsiveness of blockchain systems. The paper is organised as follows.\nSection¬†2 presents the background and related work.\nSection¬†3 presents our solution and details the experimental settings.\nSections¬†4, 5, 6 and 7 present respectively the resilience, the recoverability, the partition tolerance and the Byzantine fault tolerance of the blockchains.\nSection¬†8 discusses our results.\nFinally, Section¬†9 concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: of the same protocol, which reduces the risk of having all nodes experiencing the same bug.
