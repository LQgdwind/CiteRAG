      "content": "Paper Title: Real-Time Evaluation in Online Continual Learning: A New Hope\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated impressive success in solving complex tasks 0   when trained offline, for several passes, over large well-curated labeled datasets. However, in many real-world scenarios, data is only available in the form of a stream with a changing distribution. Due to this challenge, there has been a growing interest in the problem of learning from a time-varying stream, also known as Continual Learning (CL), which is a key challenge for DNNs due to a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting . In particular, when a DNN is trained with data from a new distribution, the DNN performance significantly drops on previously learned data. While mitigation efforts have been proposed, e.g. through regularizing the training   , replaying previously seen examples  3 , and many other approaches   , current evaluation approaches are still far from real-world scenarios. For example, the majority of literature is on Offline Continual Learning, under which methods are allowed unlimited budget, both time and computation. Furthermore, the majority of CL evaluations are conducted on small-scale datasets with well-defined temporal distribution boundaries in the form of learning a sequence of tasks. To that end, there has recently been a growing interest in the more realistic setting – Online Continual Learning (OCL). In such a setup  [ref]4 1 , CL methods are restricted to a single training pass over a shuffled split of existing offline CL benchmarks. This is certainly a step forward towards resolving some of the unrealistic assumptions of offline CL. However, current evaluations do not sufficiently address the challenges of real-time learning for high-throughput streams with rapid distribution changes. To illustrate this, consider the problem of continuously learning a Twitter stream where 350K tweets are uploaded per minute on various trending topics . Every uploaded tweet needs to be predicted with a DNN for misinformation and hate speech, among other things, while simultaneously learning and adapting to them. Given the scale at which data is being updated, there is an inherent key limitation on the time and computational budget affordable to learning incoming tweets, an aspect that is often overlooked in the prior art from the OCL literature.\nConsider an OCL method that is 10 times slower than the Twitter high throughput stream, i.e., it takes 10 minutes to train on one minute worth of tweets (350K tweets). This inefficiency results in an accumulation of ∼similar-to\\sim3.1 million new samples that need to be predicted and trained on. Since it is not acceptable to pause all tweets from appearing online until the method training is complete, predictions for all new samples will be performed with an older version of the model. This poses a key challenge where efficient learning from streams becomes necessary. This is because slow-training OCL methods can result in subpar performance, as they resort to predicting new stream data using an older model. This behavior worsens for streams that experience a faster change in distribution. In this paper, we propose a real-time evaluation protocol for OCL that factors in training computational complexity. Given a stream, consider an OCL method 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} that is as fast as the stream, i.e., 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} can train on every step of revealed data before the stream presents new samples. Then, if an OCL ℬℬ\\mathcal{B} is twice as expensive as 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}, then ℬℬ\\mathcal{B} will update the model for evaluation every other stream step, i.e., the model will be updated half the number of times compared to 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}. Figure 1 illustrates our proposed real-time evaluation. This is in contrast to all prior art [ref]4  [ref]6 that (1) unreasonably allows an unlimited computational budget to train on any given stream data, and (2) unfairly compares OCL methods despite having different training complexity levels. Using our real-time evaluation protocol, we benchmark many existing OCL methods against a simple and inexpensive baseline, which mitigates forgetting by simply storing and replaying recently seen samples. Contributions. We summarize our conclusions as follows: (1) We show that under our practical real-time evaluation, our simple baseline outperforms all the considered methods from the OCL literature, including recent SOTA approaches like ACE [ref]6. (2) We consider a complementary setup where the stream is as slow as the most training-expensive OCL method and compare that method against the compute-equivalent baseline. Under this computationally normalized setting, we find that the compute-equivalent baseline outperforms all existing methods. (3) Our experiments are consistent, holding for all the considered continual learning strategies, and extensive, amounting to more than 2 GPU-months. Our results highlight that the current progress in OCL needs to be rethought and a paradigm shift is needed.\nWe hope our work will lead to a new direction for continual learning that takes into account the computational cost of each method.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: boundaries in the form of learning a sequence of tasks.
