Garbuz is funded by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union‚Äôs Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement No. 101077862).\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOne of the most fundamental research directions in mechanism design is the tradeoff between simplicity and optimality of mechanisms. A canonical example of this tradeoff is the measure of competition complexity in auctions, originated by Bulow and Klemperer [ref]8 who asked the question of how many additional bidders are needed to achieve using a simple mechanism the same revenue as the optimal (complicated) auction. In particular, Bulow and Klemperer [ref]8 showed that when selling a single item to a set of bidders with values drawn i.i.d. from some regular222A distribution with density fùëìf and cumulative density FùêπF is regular if its virtual value function œï‚Äã(v):=v‚àí1‚àíF‚Äã(v)f‚Äã(v)assignitalic-œïùë£ùë£1ùêπùë£ùëìùë£\\phi(v):=v-\\frac{1-F(v)}{f(v)} is non-decreasing. distribution, the (simple) second price auction with an additional bidder achieves at least the same expected revenue as the optimal distribution-tailored mechanism (the Myerson auction ). This result asserts that recruiting one more bidder is more important (in terms of revenue) than learning the exact distribution of the values of the bidders and tailoring the auction according to this information. The work of Bulow and Klemperer [ref]8 inspired a line of work   [ref]27       [ref]6 that studied the competition complexity measure of more evolved scenarios such as auctions to bidders with independently but not identically distributed values, as well as auctions beyond single-item settings.\nIn particular, Feldman et¬†al.  introduced the combination of competition complexity with approximation algorithms, where instead of surpassing the revenue of the optimal auction, they aim to use as few as possible additional bidders in a simple auction to obtain (1‚àíœµ)1italic-œµ(1-\\epsilon)-approximation of the expected revenue of the optimal mechanism. Most of this line of work focused on two aspects of simple auctions. Namely, auctions that have less information on the priors (such as the result of Bulow and Klemperer [ref]8) or auctions that are easy to implement computationally (such as selling items separately, or the grand bundle in a second price auction).\nHowever, a key complexity aspect of implementing mechanisms is the requirement to coordinate the bidders to participate simultaneously. In this paper, we study the competition complexity measure in online auctions where bidders arrive sequentially and the seller needs to sell the item in an immediate and irrevocable fashion.\nSequential auctions are well-studied333Sequential auctions are also studied under the prophet inequality framework. The connection to prophet inequality was observed in Chawla et¬†al. , where they showed that implementing a prophet inequality algorithm on the virtual values leads to an approximation result against the expected revenue of the optimal Myerson‚Äôs auction. and are widely used in practice.\nMoreover, sequential auctions are likely to attract more participants as there is no need for coordination between the bidders, and each bidder faces a simple decision of whether to purchase the item at a take-it-or-leave-it price.\nBrustle et¬†al.  introduced the question of the competition complexity of dynamic pricing with i.i.d. bidders, and showed that in contrast to [ref]8, the exact competition complexity of online auctions is unbounded, and analyzed the asymptotic behavior of the additional amount of bidders needed to achieve (1‚àíœµ)1italic-œµ(1-\\epsilon)-approximation of the optimal offline auction.\nBrustle et¬†al. [ref]6 extended the result of  to the case of independent but not identical bidders that arrive according to the block arrival model (where they ask how many sequential copies of the original instance are needed to approximate the expectation of the optimal auction on a single instance).\nHowever, the assumption that participants arrive according to the block arrival model is very restrictive and captures only a few real-life scenarios. The research question of our paper is to analyze the competition complexity of independent but not identical bidders that arrive in the more natural arrival model of a random order.\nSequential auctions under random arrival order relate heavily to the prophet secretary framework introduced by Esfandiari et¬†al. , in which a decision-maker faces a series of random rewards V1,‚Ä¶,Vnsubscriptùëâ1‚Ä¶subscriptùëâùëõV_{1},\\ldots,V_{n} that arrive in a random order, and needs to select one of them in an immediate and irrevocable fashion.\nThe rewards are drawn independently from some known distributions F1,‚Ä¶,Fnsubscriptùêπ1‚Ä¶subscriptùêπùëõF_{1},\\ldots,F_{n}.\nThe performance of the decision-maker is measured against a ‚Äúprophet‚Äù who knows all the realizations of the rewards in advance, and thus always selects the maximum reward.\nWe model our research question using the prophet secretary framework and ask how many additional copies of the rewards are needed to approximate the maximum reward (without the additional copies).\nThis result implies competition complexity results for both approximating the social welfare, as well as approximating the expected revenue (under the usual regularity assumption) of the optimal offline mechanism (i.e., the second-price auction for social welfare, and the Myerson auction for revenue).\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: design is the tradeoff between simplicity and optimality of mechanisms.
