      "content": "Paper Title: Hyperparameter Sensitivity in Deep Outlier Detection Analysis and a Scalable Hyper-Ensemble Solution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFig. 1(left) provides the AUROC performances222We remark that although the methods are presented side-by-side, the goal here is not to compare them “head-to-head” but rather, to analyze each one’s performance variability by varying HPs on individual datasets.\n\nfor VanillaAE, RDA, DeepSVDD and GANomaly across all HP configurations (circles), for the Polluted setting (See Appx. A.3 Fig. 6 for Clean setting.) on MNIST-4 dataset where digit ‘4’ images are designated as inliers and the rest nine classes are down-sampled at 10% as outliers, as in the DeepSVDD paper . Horizontal bars mark the 1st, 2nd (i.e. median), and 3rd quartiles, square the mean AUROC across HPs, triangle the selected model by lowest loss, and star the AUROC of the hyper-ensemble. (Corresponding plots over 3 runs per method are in Appx. A.3 Fig. 7.)\nTable 2 provides summary statistics as well as the hyper-ensemble performance for comparison for\nboth the (left) Clean and (right)\nPolluted settings. First, in Fig. 1 we observe that all methods exhibit notable variability in performance across HPs, with many worse-than-average configurations; e.g. for GANomaly, as well as many better-than-average models; e.g. for RDA.\nMean performance is considerably lower than the best model’s, illustrating the opportunity or room for improvement.\nAs one would expect, the performances in Table 2 are lower in the Polluted setting as compared to Clean (less so for the robust RDA), while sensitivity (i.e. stdev) is comparable or only slightly higher; showing that HP choice is critical under both settings. We also find that selecting a model by the value of loss (▽▽\\triangledown), despite requiring to train and choose from all models, often is much worse than the mean, i.e. random picking a (single) model (□□\\square); proving this simple heuristic ineffective.\nOn the other hand, the hyper-ensemble (☆) outperforms the mean in all cases, with quite small standard deviation across runs (i.e. low sensitivity to initialization). The reported performance (0.949±0.008plus-or-minus0.9490.0080.949\\pm 0.008) of DeepSVDD on MNIST-4 (under Clean)  is similar yet somewhat optimistic over the mean value we obtain. MNIST-4 is an easy task for DeepSVDD since mean AUROC is already around 0.9240.9240.924. Thus, we set up MNIST-5 (with digit ‘5’ as inliers) with reported AUROC\n0.885±0.009plus-or-minus0.8850.0090.885\\pm 0.009, as well as CIFAR10-auto (with class ‘automobile’ as inliers) (in both cases rest of the classes are subsampled at 10% each as outliers) with reported AUROC\n0.659±0.021plus-or-minus0.6590.0210.659\\pm 0.021.\nWe run DeepSVDD on both datasets under all 864 configurations. As shown in Fig. 1 (right),\nour mean AUROCs are\n0.857±0.037plus-or-minus0.8570.0370.857\\pm 0.037 for MNIST-5, and\n0.605±0.024plus-or-minus0.6050.0240.605\\pm 0.024 for CIFAR10-auto. (See Appx. A.3 Fig. 8 for all 3 runs.)\nThe reported performances for the “recommended” HPs333Besides fixed values for various HPs, Ruff et al.  recommend HPs that differ by dataset; e.g. on MNIST they use 2 CNN modules w/ size 8 and 4 filters, on CIFAR10 they use 3 modules w/ size 32, 64, and 128 filters.  in DeepSVDD (dashed red lines) appear to be optimistic over the mean, i.e. what one would expect by random choice (in the absence of any labels or other strategies). The optimistic reporting trend holds for GANomaly and RandNet as well.\nFollowing their original paper , and different from , we set up MNIST-4out dataset to contain digit ‘4’ images this time as the outliers and the rest nine classes as inliers.\nGANomaly performances across 162 HP configs are shown in Fig. 1 (right), where the reported result (red line) in  of AUROC 0.7950.7950.795 appears notably higher than the mean 0.668±0.105plus-or-minus0.6680.1050.668\\pm 0.105 that we obtain. (See Appx. A.3 Fig. 9 for all 3 runs.) For RandNet, we first find and verify a third-party implementation, as the authors could not publicly share theirs, by replicating similar performances to those reported in [ref]11 using the author-recommended HP settings on all 8 datasets. Then for Cardio and Thyroid datasets, we train 192 RandNet ensembles with varying HPs under Polluted as in the original paper.\nResults from one run are shown in Fig. 1 (right). (See Appx. A.3 Fig. 10 for all 3 runs.)\nOn Cardio, AUROC mean is 0.894±0.045plus-or-minus0.8940.0450.894\\pm 0.045 vs. 0.9290.9290.929 (reported), and\nThyroid mean is 0.822±0.026plus-or-minus0.8220.0260.822\\pm 0.026 vs. 0.9040.9040.904 (reported). In summary, the take-aways from our analysis are as follows.\nFirst, it is clear that deep OD models are sensitive to their HP settings, showing that model/HP selection is inevitable. The mean/expected value (of random choice) can be quite away from the best model, motivating this line of research. Second, the recommended settings in recent deep OD papers are arguably optimistic; otherwise more transparency into their selection mechanism is warranted.\nFinally, hyper-ensemble performance is superior to the mean, possibly owing to different HPs implicitly imposing diversity among constituent models which helps improve detection. Besides performance improvement, hyper-ensembling\nobviates model selection by joining all models rather than choosing one and is not much sensitive to initialization – setting the stage for our proposed HP-robust OD method RobOD.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: Fig. 9 for all 3 runs.)
