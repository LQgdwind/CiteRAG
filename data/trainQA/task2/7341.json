      "content": "Paper Title: Diffusion model for relational inference\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe show the inference accuracy for the three simulated datasets in Tab. 1. We compared our DiffRI model with other state-of-the-art methods: NRI, NRI-MPM[ref]13, MI , and TE . Training settings are described in Appx. E.1. Model settings of baseline methods are described in Appx. C. In addition, we test DiffRI on scaled datasets. Results are shown in Appx. E.3. DiffRI shows high inference accuracy across three datasets. DiffRI achieves the best performance in 4 out of 5 data settings. Compared with information theory based methods MI and TE, we notice that TE gives better performance in the VAR dataset, where the system is linear. However, TE and MI fail in the Kuramoto and 2D Spring datasets generated from nonlinear systems. Under fair experimental conditions, DiffRI surpasses NRI and NRI-MPM in all five settings. To ensure fairness, we used the same dataset for evaluating the four baseline methods as for DiffRI (see Appx. D), which gives minimal data to represent node features. One may wonder why NRI performance is low in the Table compared to the original paper . We emphasize that the decrease in NRI performance is due to not using data augmentation techniques. To demonstrate this, we conducted similar experiments by including additional data, such as particle velocity or first derivative, into the input data as original papers  [ref]13. See Appx. E.2 for details. We also slightly increased the training dataset size. All the other dataset parameters remained consistent. The results are displayed in NRI (data-augmented) and NRI-MPM (data-augmented). After augmenting the data, inference accuracy improved.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: We show the inference accuracy for the three simulated datasets in Tab. 1.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
