Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

Following prior work CutLER¬†[ref]38, we resize the resolution of each image to 480√ó480480480480\\times 480, leading to 60√ó60606060\\times 60 patches as initial regions. The merging process stops at three thresholds Œ∏1merge=0.4,Œ∏2merge=0.2,Œ∏3merge=0.1formulae-sequencesuperscriptsubscriptùúÉ1merge0.4formulae-sequencesuperscriptsubscriptùúÉ2merge0.2superscriptsubscriptùúÉ3merge0.1\\theta_{1}^{\\text{merge}}=0.4,\\theta_{2}^{\\text{merge}}=0.2,\\theta_{3}^{\\text{merge}}=0.1, and results from these three thresholds are ensembled after post-processing. The post-processing steps include Conditional Random Field (CRF)¬† and filling the holes in each mask. We also filter out low-quality masks that 1) have an Intersection-over-Union (IoU) smaller than 0.5 before and after CRF, 2) are smaller than 100 pixels, or 3) contain more than two corners of the image (which are likely background). These post-processing steps are also used in prior work including CutLER¬†[ref]38. After ensembling results from the three thresholds {Œ∏imerge}i=13superscriptsubscriptsuperscriptsubscriptùúÉùëñmergeùëñ13\\{\\theta_{i}^{\\text{merge}}\\}_{i=1}^{3}, we identify the hierarchical levels of each object mask based on the coverage relation analysis. The coverage threshold is set to Œ∏cover%=90%percentsuperscriptùúÉcoverpercent90\\theta^{\\text{cover}}\\%=90\\%. In the detector training stage, we train a Cascade Mask R-CNN¬† with a ResNet-50¬† backbone on the same MS-COCO¬† images. The backbone is initialized from DINO¬†[ref]5 self-supervised pre-training. Our hyper-parameter setting for Mean Teacher mostly follows the practice of Unbiased Teacher¬†. The whole training process starts with a ‚Äúburn-in‚Äù stage, during which the student model is only trained on the initial pseudo-labels with a fixed learning rate 0.01 and fixed loss weights. After the burn-in stage, the teacher model is introduced, and we gradually adjust the learning rate from 0.01 to 0, the loss weight in the label-to-student branch from 1.0 to 0.0, and the loss weight in the teacher-to-student branch from 2.0 to 3.0, all following a cosine schedule. The whole training process spans 40,000 iterations with a batch size of 16 images. The training is performed on 4√ó4\\times NVIDIA A100 GPUs. Our code is developed based on PyTorch¬† and Detectron2¬†0.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: In the initial pseudo-label generation process, we use a frozen ViT-B/8 model¬† pre-trained on unlabeled ImageNet¬†[ref]7 by DINO¬†[ref]5, a self-supervised representation learning method, to extract visual features of train and unlabeled images in MS-COCO¬†.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
