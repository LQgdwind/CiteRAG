      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Robust Bisimulation Metric Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this work, we consider a discounted Markov Decision Process (MDP) given by a tuple, ⟨𝒮,𝒜,𝒫,R,ρ0⟩𝒮𝒜𝒫𝑅subscript𝜌0\\langle\\mathcal{S},\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{P},R,\\rho_{0}\\rangle. At the beginning of each episode, an initial state, 𝐬0∈𝒮subscript𝐬0𝒮\\mathbf{s}_{0}\\in\\mathcal{S}, is sampled from the initial-state distribution ρ0subscript𝜌0\\rho_{0} over the state space 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S}. Then, at each discrete time-step t≥0𝑡0t\\geq 0, an agent takes an action, 𝐚t∈𝒜subscript𝐚𝑡𝒜\\mathbf{a}_{t}\\in\\mathcal{A}, according to a policy π​(𝐚t|𝐬t)𝜋conditionalsubscript𝐚𝑡subscript𝐬𝑡\\pi(\\mathbf{a}_{t}|\\mathbf{s}_{t}). As a result, the MDP transitions to the next state according to a transition distribution 𝒫​(𝐬t+1|𝐬t,𝐚t)𝒫conditionalsubscript𝐬𝑡1subscript𝐬𝑡subscript𝐚𝑡\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbf{s}_{t+1}|\\mathbf{s}_{t},\\mathbf{a}_{t}). The agent collects a scalar reward, rt=R​(𝐬t,𝐚t)subscript𝑟𝑡𝑅subscript𝐬𝑡subscript𝐚𝑡r_{t}=R(\\mathbf{s}_{t},\\mathbf{a}_{t}), from the environment according to a bounded reward function, R:𝒮×𝒜→[Rmin,Rmax]:𝑅→𝒮𝒜subscript𝑅minsubscript𝑅maxR:\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow[R_{\\mathrm{min}},R_{\\mathrm{max}}]. In infinite- and long-horizon settings, a discount factor, γ∈[0,1)𝛾01\\gamma\\in[0,1), is used to calculate the agent’s discounted return in a given episode, G=∑t≥0γt​rt𝐺subscript𝑡0superscript𝛾𝑡subscript𝑟𝑡G=\\sum_{t\\geq 0}\\gamma^{t}r_{t}. RL algorithms aim to find an optimal policy, π∗≔arg⁡maxπ∈Π⁡𝔼​[G]≔superscript𝜋subscript𝜋Π𝔼delimited-[]𝐺\\pi^{*}\\coloneqq\\operatorname*{\\arg\\!\\max}_{\\pi\\in\\Pi}\\mathbb{E}[G], for a class of stationary policies ΠΠ\\Pi. In high-dimensional, continuous state (or observation) spaces, this learning problem is rendered tractable via a state encoder (e.g., a neural network), ϕ:𝒮→ℝn:italic-ϕ→𝒮superscriptℝ𝑛\\phi:\\mathcal{S}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{n},\nwhich is used to\nlearn a policy of the form π​(𝐚|ϕ​(𝐬))𝜋conditional𝐚italic-ϕ𝐬\\pi(\\mathbf{a}|\\phi(\\mathbf{s})). The following (pseudo222Pseudo-metrics are a generalization of metrics that allow distinct points to have zero distance. For simplicity, we broadly use the term ”metric” in the remainder of this paper at the cost of imprecision.)-metric, based on the Wasserstein metric (see Appendix A for a review), is of particular relevance to this work. Distances are assigned to state pairs, (𝐬i,𝐬j)∈𝒮×𝒮subscript𝐬𝑖subscript𝐬𝑗𝒮𝒮(\\mathbf{s}_{i},\\mathbf{s}_{j})\\in\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{S}, according to a pessimistic measure  of how much the rewards collected in each state and the respective transition distributions differ. A distance of zero for a pair implies state aggregation, or bisimilarity. The following metric exists and is unique, given R:𝒮×𝒜→[ref]0 [ref]1:𝑅→𝒮𝒜01R:\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow[ref]0 [ref]1 and c∈(0,1)𝑐01c\\in(0,1) for continuous MDPs: An earlier version of this metric for finite MDPs used separate weighting constants cR,cT≥0subscript𝑐𝑅subscript𝑐𝑇0c_{R},c_{T}\\geq 0 for the first and second terms respectively, and required that cR+cT≤1subscript𝑐𝑅subscript𝑐𝑇1c_{R}+c_{T}\\leq 1 . Here, when the weighting constant cTsubscript𝑐𝑇c_{T} of the W1​(d)subscript𝑊1𝑑W_{1}(d) term is in [0,1)01[0,1), the RHS is a contraction mapping, ℱ​(d):𝔪​𝔢​𝔱→𝔪​𝔢​𝔱:ℱ𝑑→𝔪𝔢𝔱𝔪𝔢𝔱\\mathcal{F}(d):\\mathfrak{met}\\rightarrow\\mathfrak{met}, in the space of metrics. Then, the Banach fixed-point theorem can be applied to ensure the existence of a unique metric, which also ensures convergence via fixed-point iteration for finite MDPs. For more details, we refer the reader to   and the proof of Remark 1 in Appendix B.\nNotice that c𝑐c (or cTsubscript𝑐𝑇c_{T}) determines a timescale for the bisimulation metric, weighting the importance of current versus future rewards, analogously to the discount factor γ𝛾\\gamma.\nMore recently, an on-policy bisimulation metric (also called π𝜋\\pi-bisimulation) was proposed to circumvent the intractibility introduced by taking the max\\max operation over high-dimensional action spaces (e.g., continuous control), as well as the inherent pessimism of the policy-independent form . Given a fixed policy π𝜋\\pi, the following on-policy bisimulation metric exists and is unique: where riπ≔𝔼𝐚∼π​[R​(𝐬i,𝐚)]≔superscriptsubscript𝑟𝑖𝜋subscript𝔼similar-to𝐚𝜋delimited-[]𝑅subscript𝐬𝑖𝐚r_{i}^{\\pi}\\coloneqq\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{a}\\sim\\pi}[R(\\mathbf{s}_{i},\\mathbf{a})] and 𝒫π(⋅|𝐬i)≔𝔼𝐚∼π[𝒫(⋅|𝐬i,𝐚)]\\mathcal{P}^{\\pi}(\\cdot|\\mathbf{s}_{i})\\coloneqq\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{a}\\sim\\pi}[\\mathcal{P}(\\cdot|\\mathbf{s}_{i},\\mathbf{a})]. Zhang et al. [ref]53 proposed to learn a similar on-policy bisimulation metric directly in the embedding space via an MSE objective. They proposed an algorithm for jointly learning a policy π​(𝐚|ϕ​(𝐬))𝜋conditional𝐚italic-ϕ𝐬\\pi(\\mathbf{a}|\\phi(\\mathbf{s})) with an on-policy bisimulation metric. Below, we define a generalized variant of their objective: where d^π,ϕ​(𝐬i,𝐬j)≔∥ϕ​(𝐬i)−ϕ​(𝐬j)∥q2≔subscript^𝑑𝜋italic-ϕsubscript𝐬𝑖subscript𝐬𝑗subscriptdelimited-∥∥italic-ϕsubscript𝐬𝑖italic-ϕsubscript𝐬𝑗subscript𝑞2\\widehat{d}_{\\pi,\\phi}(\\mathbf{s}_{i},\\mathbf{s}_{j})\\coloneqq\\lVert\\phi(\\mathbf{s}_{i})-\\phi(\\mathbf{s}_{j})\\rVert_{q_{2}} and they used (q1=2,q2=1)formulae-sequencesubscript𝑞12subscript𝑞21(q_{1}=2,q_{2}=1). Notice that the recursion induced by this objective is different from prior metrics in three ways; (i) a W2subscript𝑊2W_{2} metric was used instead of a W1subscript𝑊1W_{1} metric since W2subscript𝑊2W_{2} has a convenient closed form for Gaussian distributions when q1=2subscript𝑞12q_{1}=2, (ii) the distance function used for the bisimulation metric and the Wasserstein metric are different (L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} and L2subscript𝐿2L_{2} respectively), and (iii) a forward dynamics model is used instead of the ground truth dynamics. While they may introduce practical benefits, these differences violate the conditions under which the existence of a unique bisimulation metric has been proven    . Thus, we will (i) assume a unique metric exists for all Wasserstein metrics Wpsubscript𝑊𝑝W_{p} when necessary (see Assumption 1), (ii) study losses that use a matching metric, i.e., q1=q2=qsubscript𝑞1subscript𝑞2𝑞q_{1}=q_{2}=q, and (iii) introduce a constraint on forward models in Sec. 3.2.2. Next, we note that they recommend the use of stop gradients for the W2subscript𝑊2W_{2} term. The resulting gradient updates may be considered as approximate fixed-point iteration in the space of metrics: where αnsubscript𝛼𝑛\\alpha_{n} is a learning rate. However, in practice, π𝜋\\pi and 𝒫^^𝒫\\widehat{\\mathcal{P}} may also be updated in training, which is of particular relevance when they have form π​(𝐚|ϕ​(𝐬))𝜋conditional𝐚italic-ϕ𝐬\\pi(\\mathbf{a}|\\phi(\\mathbf{s})) and 𝒫^​(ϕ​(𝐬′)|ϕ​(𝐬),𝐚)^𝒫conditionalitalic-ϕsuperscript𝐬′italic-ϕ𝐬𝐚\\widehat{\\mathcal{P}}(\\phi(\\mathbf{s}^{\\prime})|\\phi(\\mathbf{s}),\\mathbf{a}) as in [ref]53. In the next section, we will discuss conditions under which joint updates to a policy π𝜋\\pi and a metric defined by state encodings ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi may or may not converge in practical settings: where dπ∗subscript𝑑superscript𝜋d_{\\pi^{*}} is the on-policy bisimulation metric for the optimal policy π∗superscript𝜋\\pi^{*}.\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: in each state and the respective transition distributions differ.
