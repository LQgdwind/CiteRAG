      "content": "Paper Title: Formalizing the Generalization-Forgetting Trade-Off in Continual Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe use the CL benchmark [ref]19 for our experiments and retain the experimental settings (hyperparameters) from [ref]19 [ref]42. For comparison, we use the split-MNIST, permuted-MNIST, and split-CiFAR100 data sets while considering three scenarios: incremental domain learning (IDL), incremental task learning (ITL), and incremental class learning (ICL). The splitting and permutation strategies when applied to the MNIST or CiFAR100 data set can generate task sequences for all three scenarios (illustrated in Figure 1 and Appendix: Figure 2 of [ref]19). For comparing our approach, we use three baseline strategies—standard neural network with Adam , Adagrad , and SG—and use L2subscript𝐿2L_{2}-regularization and naive rehearsal (which is similar to experience replay). For CL approaches, we use EWC , online EWC , SI , LwF , DGR , RtF [ref]42, MAS , MER [ref]36, and GEM . We utilize data preprocessing as provided by [ref]19. Additional details on experiments can be found in Appendix B and [ref]19 [ref]42. All experiments are conducted in Python 3.4 using the pytorch 1.7.11.7.11.7.1 library with the NVIDIA-A100 GPU for our simulations. Comparison with the state of the art: The results for our method are summarized in Table 1 and 2. The efficiency for any method is calculated by observing the average accuracy (retained accuracy (RA) [ref]36) at the end of each repetition and then evaluating the mean and standard deviation of RA across different repetitions. For each method, we report the mean and standard deviation of RA over five repetitions of each experiment. In each column, we indicate the best-performing method in bold. For the split-MNIST data set, we obtain 99.52±0.07plus-or-minus99.520.0799.52\\pm 0.07 for ITL, 98.71±0.06plus-or-minus98.710.0698.71\\pm 0.06 for IDL, and 97.32±0.17plus-or-minus97.320.1797.32\\pm 0.17 for ICL. Similarly, with the permuted-MNIST data set, we obtain 97.41±0.01plus-or-minus97.410.0197.41\\pm 0.01 for ITL, 97.51±0.05plus-or-minus97.510.0597.51\\pm 0.05 for IDL, and 97.61±0.01plus-or-minus97.610.0197.61\\pm 0.01 for ICL. Furthermore, with the split-CiFAR100 data set, we obtain 81.82±0.17plus-or-minus81.820.1781.82\\pm 0.17 for ITL, 62.11±0.00plus-or-minus62.110.0062.11\\pm 0.00 for IDL, and 69.27±0.03plus-or-minus69.270.0369.27\\pm 0.03 for ICL. BCL is the best-performing methodology for all cases (across both data sets) except RtF for ITL (0.14%percent0.140.14\\% drop) with the split-MNIST data set. Generally, ITL is the easiest learning scenario [ref]19, and all methods therefore perform well on ITL (the performance is close). For the ITL scenario with the split-MNIST data set, BCL is better than most methods; but several methods, such as naive rehearsal, naive rehearsal-C, RtF, and DGR, attain close RA values (less than 1%percent11\\% from BCL). Note that both DGR and RtF involve a generative model pretrained with data from all the tasks. In a sequential learning scenario, one cannot efficiently train generative models because data corresponding to all the tasks is not available beforehand. Although RtF provides improved performance for split-MNIST (ITL), the improvement is less than 1%percent11\\% (not significant). In fact, RtF performance is poorer for BCL in ICL by 4.76%percent4.764.76\\% (a significant drop in performance) and in IDL by 1.4%.percent1.41.4\\%. Two additional observations can be made about the split-MNIST data set. First, Adagrad, SGD, and L2 achieve better performance than does Adam. Therefore, in our analysis Adagrad appears more appropriate although Adam is popularly used for this task. Second, naive rehearsal (both naive rehearsal and naive rehearsal-C approaches) achieves performance equivalent to the state-of-the-art methods with similar memory overhead. Furthermore, naive rehearsal performs much better than online EWC and SI, especially in the ICL scenario. These limitations indicate that regularization-driven approaches are not much better than baseline models and in fact perform poorer than methods involving memory (naive rehearsals, MER, BCL, etc.). In 6, it was shown theoretically that memory-based approaches typically do better than regularization-driven approaches, as is empirically observed in this paper, too. Another interesting observation is that EWC and online EWC require significant hyperparameter tuning, which would be difficult to do in real-world scenarios. Other regularization-based methods, such as SI and MAS, also suffer from the same issue. The observations from the split-MNIST carry forward to the permuted-MNIST data set. Moreover, RA values for the permutation MNIST data set are better for the split-MNIST data set across the board, indicating that the permutation MNIST data set presents an easier learning problem. Similar to the observations made with the split-MNIST data set, BCL is better than all methods for the permuted-MNIST dataset, with naive rehearsal and RtF providing RA values that are close (less than 1%percent11\\%). The only methodology in the literature that attempts to model the balance between forgetting and generalization is MER, an extension of GEM. From our results, we observe that BCL is better than MER in all cases (Split-MNIST–2.4%percent2.42.4\\% improvement for ITL, 6.55%percent6.556.55\\% improvement for IDL, 4.12%percent4.124.12\\% improvement for ICL and Permuted-MNIST–0.26%percent0.260.26\\% improvement for ITL, 1.4%percent1.41.4\\% improvement for IDL and 5.9%percent5.95.9\\% improvement for ICL). The substantial improvements obtained by BCL are more evident in Table 2 where the results on the split-CiFAR100 data set are summarized. BCL is clearly the best-performing method. The next best-performing method is naive rehearsal-C, where BCL improves performance by 3.41%percent3.413.41\\% for ITL, 10.3%percent10.310.3\\% for IDL, and 17.99%percent17.9917.99\\% for ICL. Other observations about the regularization methods and the rest of the baseline methods carry forward from Table 1. However, one key difference is that while AdaGrad is observed to be better than Adam for the MNIST data set, Adam is comparable to SGD and Adagrad for split-CiFAR100. In summary, BCL is comparable to or better than the state of the art in the literature for both the MNIST and CiFAR100 data sets. Do we need a game to achieve this performance? To provide additional insights into the benefits of the game, we compare RA values with and without the game. In our setup, Δ​𝒙k(i)Δsubscriptsuperscript𝒙𝑖𝑘\\Delta\\boldsymbol{x}^{(i)}_{k} aims at increasing the cost, and 𝜽k(i)subscriptsuperscript𝜽𝑖𝑘\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(i)}_{k} aims at reducing the cost. If we hold the play for Δ​𝒙k(i)Δsubscriptsuperscript𝒙𝑖𝑘\\Delta\\boldsymbol{x}^{(i)}_{k}, then the dynamics required to play the game do not exist, thus providing a method that can perform CL without the game. Therefore, we induce the absence of a game by fixing Δ​𝒙k(i)Δsubscriptsuperscript𝒙𝑖𝑘\\Delta\\boldsymbol{x}^{(i)}_{k} and perform each of the nine experiments for five repetitions (ICL, IDL, and ITL for split-MNIST, permuted-MNIST, and split-CiFAR100). We summarize these results in the last two rows of Tables 1 and 2. Consequently, we make two observations. First: even without the game, we achieve RA values comparable to the state of the art. This is true for both the MNIST and CiFAR100 data sets. Second, with the introduction of the game, we observe improved RA values across the board (at least by 1%percent11\\% with MNIST). The difference is clearer with the CiFAR100 data set where we observe a substantial improvement in RA values (at least 10%percent1010\\%). Does the theory appropriately model the continual learning problem? In Fig. 3(a) we plot the progression of Jk​(𝜽k)+⟨∇𝒙kVk(∗),Δ​𝒙k⟩subscript𝐽𝑘subscript𝜽𝑘subscript∇subscript𝒙𝑘superscriptsubscript𝑉𝑘Δsubscript𝒙𝑘J_{k}({\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{k})+\\langle\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{x}_{k}}V_{k}^{(*)},\\Delta\\boldsymbol{x}_{k}\\rangle (blue curve), ⟨∇𝜽kVk(∗),Δ​𝜽k⟩subscript∇subscript𝜽𝑘superscriptsubscript𝑉𝑘Δsubscript𝜽𝑘\\langle\\nabla_{{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{k}}V_{k}^{(*)},\\Delta{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{k}\\rangle (red curve), and the sum, namely, Δ​Vk(∗)Δsubscriptsuperscript𝑉𝑘\\Delta V^{(*)}_{k} (green curve). A total of six tasks, sampled from the permutation MNIST data set within the ICL setting, are illustrated in Fig. 3(a). These tasks are introduced every 300 update steps. From Fig. 3(a) we make two important observations. First, as soon as tasks 1, 3, 4, and 6 are introduced, all three curves (red, blue, and green) indicate a bump. Second, when tasks 2 and 5 are introduced, there is no change. On a closer look at task 3 in Fig. 3(b), we observe that when the task 3 is introduced, the blue curve exhibits a large positive bump (the introduction of the new tasks increases the first and the third terms in Eq. (2)). The increase implies that task 3 forced the model to generalize and increased forgetting on tasks 1 and 2 (observed by the increase in the green curve). To compensate for this increase, we require the model 𝜽ksubscript𝜽𝑘\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{k} to behave adversarially and introduce a large enough negative value in ⟨∇𝜽kVk(∗),Δ​𝜽k⟩subscript∇subscript𝜽𝑘superscriptsubscript𝑉𝑘Δsubscript𝜽𝑘\\langle\\nabla_{{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{k}}V_{k}^{(*)},\\Delta{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{k}\\rangle (red curve) to cancel out the increase in the blue curve. In Fig. 3(b) the red curve demonstrates a large negative value (expected behavior) and eventually (as i𝑖i increases) forces the blue curve (by consequence, green: the sum of red and blue) to move toward zero (the model compensates for the increase in forgetting). As observed, the blue and the red curves behave opposite to each other and introduce a push-pull behavior that stops only when the two cancel each other and the sum (green) is zero. Once the sum has reached zero, there is no incentive for the red and green to be nonzero, and therefore they remain at zero; thus, all three curves (green, red, and blue) remain at zero once converged until a task 4 is introduced (when there is another bump, as seen in Fig. 3(a)). However, this increase in the blue curve is not observed when tasks 2 and 5 are introduced. When new tasks are similar to the older tasks, it is expected that Δ​Vk(∗)=0,Δsubscriptsuperscript𝑉𝑘0\\Delta V^{(*)}_{k}=0, as is observed in Fig. 3(a). All of these observations are fully explained by Eq. 2, which illustrates that the solution to the CL problem is obtained optimally only when Δ​Vk(∗)=0Δsubscriptsuperscript𝑉𝑘0\\Delta V^{(*)}_{k}=0 (observed in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)). The term Δ​Vk(∗)Δsubscriptsuperscript𝑉𝑘\\Delta V^{(*)}_{k} is quantified by Jk​(𝜽k),⟨∇𝜽kVk(∗),Δ​𝜽k⟩subscript𝐽𝑘subscript𝜽𝑘subscript∇subscript𝜽𝑘superscriptsubscript𝑉𝑘Δsubscript𝜽𝑘J_{k}({\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{k}),\\langle\\nabla_{{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{k}}V_{k}^{(*)},\\Delta{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{k}\\rangle and ⟨∇𝒙kVk(∗),Δ​𝒙k⟩subscript∇subscript𝒙𝑘superscriptsubscript𝑉𝑘Δsubscript𝒙𝑘\\langle\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{x}_{k}}V_{k}^{(*)},\\Delta\\boldsymbol{x}_{k}\\rangle. Our theory suggests that there exists an inherent trade-off between different terms in Eq. 2. Therefore every time a new task is observed, it is expected that Jk​(𝜽k)+⟨∇𝒙kVk(∗),Δ​𝒙k⟩subscript𝐽𝑘subscript𝜽𝑘subscript∇subscript𝒙𝑘superscriptsubscript𝑉𝑘Δsubscript𝒙𝑘J_{k}({\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{k})+\\langle\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{x}_{k}}V_{k}^{(*)},\\Delta\\boldsymbol{x}_{k}\\rangle increases (increase in blue curve when tasks 1, 3, 4, and 6 are introduced) and ⟨∇𝜽kVk(∗),Δ​𝜽k⟩subscript∇subscript𝜽𝑘superscriptsubscript𝑉𝑘Δsubscript𝜽𝑘\\langle\\nabla_{{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{k}}V_{k}^{(*)},\\Delta{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{k}\\rangle compensates to cancel this increase (red curve exhibits a negative jump). In Theorems 1 and 2 we demonstrate the existence of this balance point (for each task, as i𝑖i increases, Δ​Vk(∗)Δsubscriptsuperscript𝑉𝑘\\Delta V^{(*)}_{k} tends to zero, as observed in Fig. 3(b)) and Δ​Vk(∗)Δsubscriptsuperscript𝑉𝑘\\Delta V^{(*)}_{k} remains zero (the balance point is stable, proved in Theorem 2) until a new task increases forgetting. Furthermore, our theory claims the existence of a solution with respect to each task. This is also observed in Fig. 3(a) as, for each task, there is an increase in cost, and BCL quickly facilitates convergence. These observations indicate that our dynamical system in Eq. 2\naccurately describes the dynamics of the continual learning problem. Furthermore, the assumptions under which the theory is developed are practical and are satisfied by performing continual learning on the permuted MNIST problem.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: We use the CL benchmark [ref]19 for our experiments and retain the experimental settings (hyperparameters) from [ref]19 [ref]42.
