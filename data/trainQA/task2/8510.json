Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

To ensure a fair comparison, we additionally implement FreeNoise [ref]33 on the CogVideoX backbone as an enhanced baseline. As shown in Fig. 6, our proposed method demonstrates superior performance across three critical aspects: text-to-video alignment, temporal coherence, and motion quality. While Kling [ref]3 exhibits impressive capabilities in high-quality video generation, it is limited to simultaneous multi-semantic blending rather than sequential semantic transitions, highlighting the significance of our work in achieving temporally evolving content across multiple prompts. Our comparative analysis reveals distinct characteristics and limitations of existing approaches. Gen-L-Video  suffers from severe temporal jittering and occasional subject disappearance, compromising overall video quality. Video-Infinity [ref]38 and FreeNoise [ref]33 both demonstrate successful scene-level semantic changes but lack physically plausible motion - for instance, in Fig. 6, vehicles appear to be in motion while remaining spatially fixed, which is a limitation inherent to their UNet-based abilities. In contrast, FreeNoise+DiT leverages the DiT architecture’s abilities to achieve more realistic object motion but struggles with semantic transitions, resulting in noticeable discontinuities between segments.\nOur proposed DiTCtrl method preserves the inherent capabilities of the pre-trained DiT model while addressing these limitations, enabling smooth semantic transitions and maintaining motion coherence throughout the video sequence.\nFor a more comprehensive evaluation, we provide additional frame-level and video-level comparisons with extensive qualitative examples in the supp.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: We conduct comprehensive qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art multi-prompt video generation methods [ref]33  [ref]38 and leading commercial solutions [ref]3.

As shown in\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
