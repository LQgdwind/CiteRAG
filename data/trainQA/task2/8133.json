      "content": "Paper Title: High Definition Map Mapping and Update: A General Overview and Future Directions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImage semantic segmentation is very critical in the map update process. However, the sensors’ limitations to record data in poor lighting conditions, lack of depth information, and limited scan areas make it difficult to rely entirely on vision-based sensors as the only source of perception information. In contrast, Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) sensors can provide a reliable source of depth information regardless of the lighting conditions with a high-frequency flow of data which gives itself an edge by comparison.\nHowever,  also elaborates the limitation from LIDAR sensor caused by low point density and coarseness at the time of measurement due to insufficient light irradiation. There are a lot of research have been done on this space with the introduction of the public dataset such as KITTISemantic [ref]69, RELLIS-3D , and TheSemanticKITTI [ref]96 LIDAR data often comes in an unstructured format and varying in sparsity according to the object distance relative to the sensors. These characteristics pose the main challenge of fully utilizing the sensor data as the primary sensor to provide semantic segmentation results. However, more and more research has been done to address these problems. The earliest works in this space rely on the projection of the detected object from the images to the 3D point cloud space to achieve 3D object detection, and this method is also referred to as 2D semantic segmentation for LIDAR sensor . This method is based on an encoder-decoder network based on a fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) layer. Then, they further refine the method in  and  to improve the loss function and batch normalization model. RangeNet++  derived from DarkNet backbone of YOLOv3 to provide an efficient way of predicting segmentation results by fast K-nearest neighborhood (KNN) algorithm on the point cloud. PolarNet  introduces a new approach of using a polar bird eye view (BEV). This polar grid provides data-driven features using PointNet [ref]100 rather than manually designed features. Then, SalsaNet  uses ResNet blocks as the encoder part and upsamples the features in the decoder part. They also use the BEV approach in their method, and it is extended in SalsaNext  by proposing a new, improved encoder-decoder to achieve state-of-the-art results in 2D semantic segmentation*. Then, it develops into a direct feed of point clouds into the 3D convolutional network where voxel representation is used to perform 3D convolutions  . PointNet [ref]100 and PointNet++  introduces sampling of different point cloud scales to extract features. This method is particularly slow when processing a large point cloud data. RandLA-Net  downsamples features randomly to accelerate the calculation process and at the same time introduce a local feature aggregation module to increase the receptive field for each 3D point. KPConv  introduced a new way to process the point without any pre-processing step directly. Then, MinkNet  introduces a novel 4D convolution with an open-source code to differentiate sparse tensors automatically. This method can achieve state-of-the-art results compared to other 3D semantic segmentation methods*. Finally, the hybrid methods where voxel-based, image-lidar projection, and/or point-wise based operations are utilized to process the point cloud. This method is not standard in the past because of memory limitations. However, with the development of a memory-efficient algorithm, this method can provide a meaningful result. FusionNet  uses voxel-based mini-PointNet, which directly projects features from neighborhood voxel to the target voxel, which results in an efficient calculation to process extensive scale point cloud data. Then 3D-MiniNet  uses a projection method based on a learning algorithm to extract features from 3D data then feeds it to 2D FCNN to predict semantic segmentation results. SPVNAS  derived from MinkNet library  can propose a hybrid 4D sparse convolution and point-wise based operations to achieve a tremendous semantic segmentation result. Finally, (AF)2-S3Net  which also built upon MinkNet  model can be converted into an end-to-end encoder-decoder with the addition of attention layers to achieve state-of-the-art results when compared to other hybrid methods*. In the latest development,  can achieve a comparable result in some areas such as road and sidewalk detection with fewer parameters which speeds up the processing time by 2.17 times.\n ables to boost the performance of LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation by leveraging an auxiliary modal fusion which is rich in semantic and structural information and knowledge distillation.\nReaders who are interested in the most recent survey about LIDAR semantic segmentation dataset and methods refer to .\n\nReference markers found: [69]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]69: at the time of measurement due to insufficient light irradiation.
