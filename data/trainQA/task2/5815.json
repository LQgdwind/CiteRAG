      "content": "Paper Title: Sparsifiner: Learning Sparse Instance-Dependent Attention for Efficient Vision Transformers\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEfficient Attention —\nDeveloping an efficient attention mechanism for high resolution image encoding is the focus of this work.\nEfficient attention mechanisms have been widely studied in NLP tasks to model long sequences.\nThey can be categorized as follows:\nLow-rank methods such as Linformer [ref]37 use a low-rank projection to linearize the multi-head attention operation.\nLinformer [ref]37 replaces the scaled dot product with linear attention that approximates the attention with a low-rank matrix.\nKernelization, including Performer ,\nLinear Transformers , and Random Feature\nAttention  use kernels to avoid explicitly computing the attention matrix.\nSparse attention with fixed attention patterns   3  .\nThis type of technique sparsifies the attention matrix by limiting the field of view to predefined patterns such as local and strided windows.\nSimilarity and clustering-based methods including Routing Transformer , Reformer , and Sinkhorn Transformer .\nThese models measure token relevance by sorting or clustering and then assign tokens to buckets for within-bucket attention.\nNeural memory mechanisms such as Set Transformer , Compressive Transformer , and Longformer [ref]1.\nThese use extra global tokens that gather long-range information as a model memory. Vision Transformers — Recent progress has demonstrated that variants of Transformers  can also be competitive alternatives to CNNs and achieve promising results on different vision tasks.\nIn addition to image classification, Transformers have also been applied to various vision tasks, including object detection   4 6,\nimage generation  3, and video processing 2 5.\nVision Transformer (ViT)  splits images as small patches and treats the patches as the input word tokens.\nViT shows better performance than CNN-type models with sufficient extensive training data.\nDeiT  incorporates knowledge distillation techniques into ViT training so that we can train a competitive Transformer using only ImageNet-1k .\nLV-ViT  further improves the performance of ViT by introducing a new training objective named token labelling.\nMost of these methods have quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to the input image size. Efficient Vision Transformers — There is a thrust to model long sequences of image patches at much higher resolutions.\nRecent works such as Pyramid Vision Transformer (PVT) , Swin-Transformer , T2T-ViT ,\nand Vision Longformer (ViL) 3 apply transformer layers on different resolution scales by stacking a pyramid of ViTs to form a multi-scale architecture.\nTo achieve linear complexity, Swin-Transformer  uses shifted local window attention.\nVision Longformer 3 adapts the local attention pattern with the global memory tokens from Longformer [ref]1.\nTimeSformer  applies multiple attentions, each along a single axis of the input video. Those methods all leverage fixed, predefined attention patterns to reduce the quadratic cost.\nIn contrast, our method generates sparse dynamic attention patterns based on the input content.\nAnother group of works reduce the number of tokens by pruning  7 , or merging tokens 8  1.\nRecent work, DynamicViT 7 and EViT  study unstructured token sparsification by gradually dropping tokens in the inference of ViTs .\nHowever, quadratic attention cost remains in early layers where input tokens cannot be largely sparsified.\nOur method instead prunes connectivities at every layer, allowing complexity savings at early layers.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: is the focus of this work.\nEfficient attention mechanisms have been widely studied in NLP tasks to model long sequences.\nThey can be categorized as follows:\nLow-rank methods such as Linformer [ref]37 use a low-rank projection to linearize the multi-head attention operation.\nLinformer [ref]37 replaces the scaled dot product with linear attention that approximates the attention with a\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
