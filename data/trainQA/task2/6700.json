      "content": "Paper Title: Multiple Instance Learning Framework with Masked Hard Instance Mining for Whole Slide Image Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHistopathological image analysis plays a crucial role in modern medicine, particularly in the treatment of cancer, where it serves as the gold standard for diagnosis¬†[ref]29   .\nDigitalizating pathological images into Whole Slide Images (WSIs) through digital slide scanner has opened new avenues for computer-aided analysis¬†1 .\nDue to the huge size of a WSI and the lack of pixel-level annotations, histopathological image analysis is commonly formulated as a multiple instance learning (MIL) task¬†  .\nIn MIL, each WSI (or slide) is a bag containing thousands of unlabeled instances (patches) cropped from the slide. With at least one instance being disease positive, the bag is deemed positive, otherwise negative. However, the number of slides is limited and each slide contains a mass of instances with a low positive proportion. This imbalance would hinder the inference of bag labels¬† .\nTo alleviate this issue, several WSI classification methods¬† 1    employ an attention mechanism to aggregate salient instance features into a bag-level feature for WSI classification.\nFurthermore, some MIL frameworks¬†   [ref]46 focus on the more salient instances in the bag and leverage them to facilitate WSI classification.\nFor instance, existing frameworks¬† [ref]46 propose to only select the instances that correspond to the top KùêæK highest or lowest attention scores¬†[ref]46  or patch probabilities¬† for yielding high-quality bag embedding for both training and testing. These salient instances are actually ‚Äúeasy-to-classify‚Äù instances, which are not optimal for training a discriminative WSI classification model.\nIn conventional machine learning, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM)¬†, samples near the category distribution boundary are more challenging to classify, but are more useful for depicting the classification boundary, as illustrated in Figure¬†1.\nMoreover, other deep learning works¬†    also reveal that mining hard samples for training can improve the generalization abilities of models.\nBy applying such an idea at the instance level, we can better highlight the ‚Äúhard-to-classify‚Äù instances that facilitate MIL model training, and benefit the final WSI classification.\nHowever, the lack of instance labels poses a challenge to the direct application of traditional hard sample mining strategies at the instance level. To address this issue,\nwe present a novel MIL framework based on masked hard instance mining strategies (MHIM) named MHIM-MIL.\nThe main idea of MHIM is to mask out the instances with high attention scores to highlight the hard instances for model training.\nBased on this, we incorporate two other instance masking strategies to enhance training efficiency and mitigate the over-fitting risk.\nAnother key design of MHIM-MIL is an instance attention generator based on a Siamese structure (Teacher-Student)¬† .\nIn MHIM-MIL, the MIL-based WSI classification model is the student network, which aggregates hard instances mined by a momentum teacher with different instance masking strategies. The momentum teacher is updated using an exponential moving average (EMA) of the student model.\nMoreover, the framework is optimized by inducing a consistency constraint that explores more supervised information beyond the limited slide label.\nUnlike the conventional MIL frameworks¬† [ref]46, which adopt complex cascade gradient-updating structures, our method is more simple and does not require additional parameters. It not only improves efficiency but also provides improved performance stability.\nThe contribution of this paper is summarized as follows, We propose a simple and efficient MIL framework with masked hard instance mining named MHIM-MIL. It implicitly mines hard instances with instance attention for training a more discriminative MIL model. Extensive experiments on two WSI datasets validate that MHIM boosts different MIL models and outperforms other latest methods in terms of performance and training cost. We propose several hybrid instance masking strategies for indirectly mining hard instances in MIL. These strategies not only address the reliance problem of conventional methods on instance-level supervision but also enhance the training efficiency of the model and mitigate the over-fitting risk. With the Siamese structure, we introduce a parameter-free momentum teacher to obtain instance attention scores more efficiently and stably.\nMoreover, we employ a consistency-based iterative optimization to improve the discriminability of both models progressively.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: Histopathological image analysis plays a crucial role in modern medicine, particularly in the treatment of cancer, where it serves as the gold standard for diagnosis¬†[ref]29   .\nDigitalizating pathological images into Whole Slide Images (WSIs) through digital slide scanner has opened new avenues for computer-aided analysis¬†1 .\nDue to the huge size of a WSI and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
