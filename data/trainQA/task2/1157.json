      "content": "Paper Title: Quantum Random Access Codes for Boolean Functions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis paper focuses on generalizing the classical, quantum and entanglement-assisted random access codes. Instead of recovering a single bit from the initial string x∈{−1,1}n𝑥superscript11𝑛x\\in\\{-1,1\\}^{n}, we are interested in evaluating a Boolean function f:{−1,1}k→{−1,1}:𝑓→superscript11𝑘11f:\\{-1,1\\}^{k}\\to\\{-1,1\\} on any sequence of k𝑘k bits from x𝑥x. We generically call them f𝑓f-random access codes. Let 𝒮nk={(Si)i=1k∈{1,…,n}k|Si≠Sj​∀i,j}superscriptsubscript𝒮𝑛𝑘conditional-setsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑆𝑖𝑖1𝑘superscript1…𝑛𝑘subscript𝑆𝑖subscript𝑆𝑗for-all𝑖𝑗\\mathcal{S}_{n}^{k}=\\{(S_{i})_{i=1}^{k}\\in\\{1,\\dots,n\\}^{k}\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ |\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ S_{i}\\neq S_{j}\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ \\forall i,j\\} be the set of sequences of different elements from {1,…,n}1…𝑛\\{1,\\dots,n\\} with length k𝑘k and let xS∈{−1,1}ksubscript𝑥𝑆superscript11𝑘x_{S}\\in\\{-1,1\\}^{k} denote the substring of x∈{−1,1}n𝑥superscript11𝑛x\\in\\{-1,1\\}^{n} specified by S∈𝒮nk𝑆superscriptsubscript𝒮𝑛𝑘S\\in\\mathcal{S}_{n}^{k}. Alice gets x∈{−1,1}n𝑥superscript11𝑛x\\in\\{-1,1\\}^{n} and she needs to encode her data and send it to Bob, so that he can decode f​(xS)𝑓subscript𝑥𝑆f(x_{S}) for any S∈𝒮nk𝑆superscriptsubscript𝒮𝑛𝑘S\\in\\mathcal{S}_{n}^{k} with probability p>1/2𝑝12p>1/2. Such problem was already considered by Sherstov in a two-way communication complexity setting  and later used in his pattern matrix method  in order to prove other communication complexity lower bounds. Even though our results are expressed in a random access code language, they can also be seen as in a one-way communication complexity setting. If two-way communication is allowed, Bob can send the identity of his sequence to Alice with O​(k​log⁡n)𝑂𝑘𝑛O(k\\log n) bits of communication, whereas (as we will see) significantly more communication may be required in the one-way scenario. In the following, ΠΠ\\Pi will refer to a sample space with some probability distribution. As before, PR and SR stand for private and shared randomness, respectively. Moreover, since we require the success probability to always be greater than 1/2121/2, given that one can always guess the correct result with probability 1/2121/2, from now on it will be convenient to use the bias ε𝜀\\varepsilon of the prediction, defined as ε=2​p−1𝜀2𝑝1\\varepsilon=2p-1, instead of its success probability p𝑝p. We start with n​↦𝜀​m𝑛𝜀maps-to𝑚n\\overset{\\varepsilon}{\\mapsto}m f𝑓f-RAC, the f𝑓f-classical random access code on m𝑚m bits with bias ε𝜀\\varepsilon. An n​↦𝜀​m𝑛𝜀maps-to𝑚n\\overset{\\varepsilon}{\\mapsto}m f𝑓f-RAC with PR is an encoding map E:{−1,1}n×ΠA→{−1,1}m:𝐸→superscript11𝑛subscriptΠ𝐴superscript11𝑚E:\\{-1,1\\}^{n}\\times\\Pi_{A}\\to\\{-1,1\\}^{m} satisfying the following: for every S∈𝒮nk𝑆superscriptsubscript𝒮𝑛𝑘S\\in\\mathcal{S}_{n}^{k} there is a decoding map DS:{−1,1}m×ΠB→{−1,1}:subscript𝐷𝑆→superscript11𝑚subscriptΠ𝐵11D_{S}:\\{-1,1\\}^{m}\\times\\Pi_{B}\\to\\{-1,1\\} such that PrrA,rB⁡[DS​(E​(x,rA),rB)=f​(xS)]≥12+12​εsubscriptPrsubscript𝑟𝐴subscript𝑟𝐵subscript𝐷𝑆𝐸𝑥subscript𝑟𝐴subscript𝑟𝐵𝑓subscript𝑥𝑆1212𝜀\\operatorname{Pr}_{r_{A},r_{B}}[D_{S}(E(x,r_{A}),r_{B})=f(x_{S})]\\geq\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}\\varepsilon for all x∈{−1,1}n𝑥superscript11𝑛x\\in\\{-1,1\\}^{n}. An n​↦𝜀​m𝑛𝜀maps-to𝑚n\\overset{\\varepsilon}{\\mapsto}m f𝑓f-RAC with SR is an encoding map E:{−1,1}n×Π→{−1,1}m:𝐸→superscript11𝑛Πsuperscript11𝑚E:\\{-1,1\\}^{n}\\times\\Pi\\to\\{-1,1\\}^{m} satisfying the following: for every S∈𝒮nk𝑆superscriptsubscript𝒮𝑛𝑘S\\in\\mathcal{S}_{n}^{k} there is a decoding map DS:{−1,1}m×Π→{−1,1}:subscript𝐷𝑆→superscript11𝑚Π11D_{S}:\\{-1,1\\}^{m}\\times\\Pi\\to\\{-1,1\\} such that Prr⁡[DS​(E​(x,r),r)=f​(xS)]≥12+12​εsubscriptPr𝑟subscript𝐷𝑆𝐸𝑥𝑟𝑟𝑓subscript𝑥𝑆1212𝜀\\operatorname{Pr}_{r}[D_{S}(E(x,r),r)=f(x_{S})]\\geq\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}\\varepsilon for all x∈{−1,1}n𝑥superscript11𝑛x\\in\\{-1,1\\}^{n}. We define n​↦𝜀​m𝑛𝜀maps-to𝑚n\\overset{\\varepsilon}{\\mapsto}m f𝑓f-QRAC, the f𝑓f-quantum random access code on m𝑚m qubits with bias ε𝜀\\varepsilon. An n​↦𝜀​m𝑛𝜀maps-to𝑚n\\overset{\\varepsilon}{\\mapsto}m f𝑓f-QRAC with PR is an encoding map E:{−1,1}n→ℂ2m×2m:𝐸→superscript11𝑛superscriptℂsuperscript2𝑚superscript2𝑚E:\\{-1,1\\}^{n}\\to\\mathbb{C}^{2^{m}\\times 2^{m}} that assigns an m𝑚m-qubit density matrix to every x∈{−1,1}n𝑥superscript11𝑛x\\in\\{-1,1\\}^{n} and satisfies the following: for every S∈𝒮nk𝑆superscriptsubscript𝒮𝑛𝑘S\\in\\mathcal{S}_{n}^{k} there is a POVM MS={M−1S,M1S}superscript𝑀𝑆subscriptsuperscript𝑀𝑆1subscriptsuperscript𝑀𝑆1M^{S}=\\{M^{S}_{-1},M^{S}_{1}\\} such that Tr⁡(Mf​(xS)S⋅E​(x))≥12+12​εTr⋅subscriptsuperscript𝑀𝑆𝑓subscript𝑥𝑆𝐸𝑥1212𝜀\\operatorname{Tr}(M^{S}_{f(x_{S})}\\cdot E(x))\\geq\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}\\varepsilon for all x∈{−1,1}n𝑥superscript11𝑛x\\in\\{-1,1\\}^{n}. An n​↦𝜀​m𝑛𝜀maps-to𝑚n\\overset{\\varepsilon}{\\mapsto}m f𝑓f-QRAC with SR is an encoding map E:{−1,1}n×Π→ℂ2m:𝐸→superscript11𝑛Πsuperscriptℂsuperscript2𝑚E:\\{-1,1\\}^{n}\\times\\Pi\\to\\mathbb{C}^{2^{m}} that assigns an m𝑚m-qubit pure state to every x∈{−1,1}n𝑥superscript11𝑛x\\in\\{-1,1\\}^{n} and satisfies the following: for every S∈𝒮nk𝑆superscriptsubscript𝒮𝑛𝑘S\\in\\mathcal{S}_{n}^{k} there is a set of POVMs {MrS}r∈Πsubscriptsubscriptsuperscript𝑀𝑆𝑟𝑟Π\\{M^{S}_{r}\\}_{r\\in\\Pi}, with MrS={M−1,rS,M1,rS}subscriptsuperscript𝑀𝑆𝑟subscriptsuperscript𝑀𝑆1𝑟subscriptsuperscript𝑀𝑆1𝑟M^{S}_{r}=\\{M^{S}_{-1,r},M^{S}_{1,r}\\}, such that 𝔼r​[E​(x,r)†​Mf​(xS),rS​E​(x,r)]≥12+12​εsubscript𝔼𝑟delimited-[]𝐸superscript𝑥𝑟†subscriptsuperscript𝑀𝑆𝑓subscript𝑥𝑆𝑟𝐸𝑥𝑟1212𝜀\\mathbb{E}_{r}[E(x,r)^{\\dagger}M^{S}_{f(x_{S}),r}E(x,r)]\\geq\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}\\varepsilon for all x∈{−1,1}n𝑥superscript11𝑛x\\in\\{-1,1\\}^{n}. Similarly, we define n​↦𝜀​m𝑛𝜀maps-to𝑚n\\overset{\\varepsilon}{\\mapsto}m f𝑓f-EARAC, the f𝑓f-entanglement-assisted random access code on m𝑚m bits with bias ε𝜀\\varepsilon. An n​↦𝜀​m𝑛𝜀maps-to𝑚n\\overset{\\varepsilon}{\\mapsto}m f𝑓f-EARAC is an n​↦𝜀​m𝑛𝜀maps-to𝑚n\\overset{\\varepsilon}{\\mapsto}m f𝑓f-RAC with SR where the encoding and decoding parties share an unlimited amount of entangled quantum states. Due to shared entanglement being a source of SR, we already include SR in f𝑓f-EARACs. We note that  focused on EARACs without SR. Finally, we define n​↦𝜀​m𝑛𝜀maps-to𝑚n\\overset{\\varepsilon}{\\mapsto}m f𝑓f-PRRAC, the f𝑓f-Popescu-Rohrlich random access code on m𝑚m bits with bias ε𝜀\\varepsilon. A Popescu-Rohrlich box  is a bipartite system shared by two parties with two inputs x,y∈{0,1}𝑥𝑦01x,y\\in\\{0,1\\} and two outputs a,b∈{0,1}𝑎𝑏01a,b\\in\\{0,1\\} and is defined by the joint probability distribution An n​↦𝜀​m𝑛𝜀maps-to𝑚n\\overset{\\varepsilon}{\\mapsto}m f𝑓f-PRRAC is an n​↦𝜀​m𝑛𝜀maps-to𝑚n\\overset{\\varepsilon}{\\mapsto}m f𝑓f-RAC with SR where the encoding and decoding parties share an unlimited amount of Popescu-Rohrlich boxes. In Section 3 we devise encoding-decoding strategies for all the f𝑓f-random access codes just defined, thus deriving lower bounds on their biases given the encoding/decoding parameters n,m𝑛𝑚n,m and k𝑘k. These f𝑓f-random access codes are built based on previous ideas from [ref]5  . The Boolean function f:{−1,1}k→{−1,1}:𝑓→superscript11𝑘11f:\\{-1,1\\}^{k}\\to\\{-1,1\\} that needs to be evaluated directly influences the final bias and such influence in our results is captured by the single quantity called noise stability  5. Informally it is a measure of how resilient to noise a Boolean function is. Given a uniformly random input x∈{−1,1}n𝑥superscript11𝑛x\\in\\{-1,1\\}^{n}, one might imagine a process that flips each bit of x𝑥x independently with some probability 12−12​q1212𝑞\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2}q, where q∈[−1,1]𝑞11q\\in[-1,1], which leads to some final string y∈{−1,1}n𝑦superscript11𝑛y\\in\\{-1,1\\}^{n}. The noise stability Stabq⁡[f]subscriptStab𝑞𝑓\\operatorname{Stab}_{q}[f] of f𝑓f with parameter q𝑞q is the correlation between f​(x)𝑓𝑥f(x) and f​(y)𝑓𝑦f(y) (see Section 2 for a formal definition). Our positive results can be summarized by the following theorem. Let f:{−1,1}k→{−1,1}:𝑓→superscript11𝑘11f:\\{-1,1\\}^{k}\\to\\{-1,1\\} be a Boolean function and Stabq⁡[f]subscriptStab𝑞𝑓\\operatorname{Stab}_{q}[f] its noise stability with parameter q𝑞q. Let ℓ∈ℕℓℕ\\ell\\in\\mathbb{N}. If m=Ω​(ℓ​log⁡n)𝑚Ωℓ𝑛m=\\Omega(\\ell\\log{n}) and k=o​(ℓ)𝑘𝑜ℓk=o(\\sqrt{\\ell}), there is an n​↦𝜀​m𝑛𝜀maps-to𝑚n\\overset{\\varepsilon}{\\mapsto}m f𝑓f-RAC with PR and bias ε≥(1−on​(1))​Stabq⁡[f]𝜀1subscript𝑜𝑛1subscriptStab𝑞𝑓\\varepsilon\\geq(1-o_{n}(1))\\operatorname{Stab}_{q}[f] with q≥mn−5​log2⁡(n/ℓ)n/ℓ𝑞𝑚𝑛5subscript2𝑛ℓ𝑛ℓq\\geq\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{n}-\\frac{5\\log_{2}{(n/\\ell)}}{n/\\ell}}. If k=o​(m)𝑘𝑜𝑚k=o(\\sqrt{m}), there is an n​↦𝜀​m𝑛𝜀maps-to𝑚n\\overset{\\varepsilon}{\\mapsto}m f𝑓f-RAC with SR and ε≥(1−on​(1))​Stabq⁡[f]𝜀1subscript𝑜𝑛1subscriptStab𝑞𝑓\\varepsilon\\geq(1-o_{n}(1))\\operatorname{Stab}_{q}[f] with q≥m2​n𝑞𝑚2𝑛q\\geq\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{2n}}. If k=o​(m)𝑘𝑜𝑚k=o(\\sqrt{m}), there is an n​↦𝜀​m𝑛𝜀maps-to𝑚n\\overset{\\varepsilon}{\\mapsto}m f𝑓f-QRAC with SR and ε≥(1−on​(1))​Stabq⁡[f]𝜀1subscript𝑜𝑛1subscriptStab𝑞𝑓\\varepsilon\\geq(1-o_{n}(1))\\operatorname{Stab}_{q}[f] with q≥8​m3​π​n𝑞8𝑚3𝜋𝑛q\\geq\\sqrt{\\frac{8m}{3\\pi n}}. If k=o​(m)𝑘𝑜𝑚k=o(\\sqrt{m}), there is an n​↦𝜀​m𝑛𝜀maps-to𝑚n\\overset{\\varepsilon}{\\mapsto}m f𝑓f-EARAC with ε≥(1−on​(1))​Stabq⁡[f]𝜀1subscript𝑜𝑛1subscriptStab𝑞𝑓\\varepsilon\\geq(1-o_{n}(1))\\operatorname{Stab}_{q}[f] and q=mn𝑞𝑚𝑛q=\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{n}}. For any n∈ℕ𝑛ℕn\\in\\mathbb{N}, there is an n​↦1​1𝑛1maps-to1n\\overset{1}{\\mapsto}1 f𝑓f-PRRAC. Results (a), (b), (c) and (d) use an encoding scheme reminiscent of the concatenation idea from 9   (and suggested to us by Ronald de Wolf). The underlying idea is to randomly break the initial string x∈{−1,1}n𝑥superscript11𝑛x\\in\\{-1,1\\}^{n} into different ‘blocks’ and encode them via a standard RAC/QRAC/EARAC. Result (a) breaks x𝑥x into ℓℓ\\ell blocks and employs the n/ℓ↦m/ℓmaps-to𝑛ℓ𝑚ℓn/\\ell\\mapsto m/\\ell RAC from Theorem 2 on every block, each with n/ℓ𝑛ℓn/\\ell elements, while in results (b)/(c)/(d) we employ the n/m↦1maps-to𝑛𝑚1n/m\\mapsto 1 RAC/QRAC/EARAC from Theorems 1/3/5 in order to encode m𝑚m blocks, each with n/m𝑛𝑚n/m elements, into a single (qu)bit each, resulting in m𝑚m encoded (qu)bits. With high probability all the bits from the needed string xS∈{−1,1}ksubscript𝑥𝑆superscript11𝑘x_{S}\\in\\{-1,1\\}^{k} will be encoded into different blocks and therefore can be decoded and f𝑓f evaluated. The decoded string y∈{−1,1}k𝑦superscript11𝑘y\\in\\{-1,1\\}^{k} can be viewed as a ‘noisy’ xSsubscript𝑥𝑆x_{S}, to which the noise stability framework can be applied. The bias of the base RAC/QRAC/EARAC thus becomes the parameter q𝑞q in the noise stability of the corresponding f𝑓f-random access code. As a quick remark, since we opted to lower-bound the parameters q𝑞q in Theorem 12, in result (b) q𝑞q does not exactly equal the bias from Theorem 1. One could write, though, q≈2​mπ​n𝑞2𝑚𝜋𝑛q\\approx\\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\pi n}}. Result (a) is our strongest bound, since it also applies to all other f𝑓f-random access codes. Moreover, there is some freedom in setting the number of blocks ℓℓ\\ell, since the number of encoded bits in Theorem 2 is not fixed to a single number (as opposed to Theorems 1, 3 and 5). The result is a trade-off between the number of bits k𝑘k of the Boolean function and the number of encoded bits m𝑚m. However, the number of encoded bits in result (a) is limited to m=Ω​(log⁡n)𝑚Ω𝑛m=\\Omega(\\log{n}), a characteristic inherited from the RAC in Theorem 2. It is possible to go below this limit by using SR, as demonstrated by results (b), (c) and (d). The above results show that quantum resources offer a modest advantage over the classical f𝑓f-random access code. On the other hand, result (e) demonstrates that stronger-than-quantum resources like Popescu-Rohrlich boxes can lead to extremely powerful f𝑓f-random access codes. This is a consequence of violating Information Causality 9, since one bit transfer allows the access to any bit in a database via Popescu-Rohrlich boxes. From x∈{−1,1}n𝑥superscript11𝑛x\\in\\{-1,1\\}^{n} a long bit-string xf∈{−1,1}tsubscript𝑥𝑓superscript11𝑡x_{f}\\in\\{-1,1\\}^{t}, where t=|𝒮nk|𝑡superscriptsubscript𝒮𝑛𝑘t=|\\mathcal{S}_{n}^{k}|, can be constructed with the values f​(xS)𝑓subscript𝑥𝑆f(x_{S}) for all S∈𝒮nk𝑆superscriptsubscript𝒮𝑛𝑘S\\in\\mathcal{S}_{n}^{k}. All bits from xfsubscript𝑥𝑓x_{f} are readable with the aid of Popescu-Rohrlich boxes, with non-signaling constraining the readout to just one bit. The protocol for f𝑓f-PRRACs is taken from 9 and uses a pyramid of Popescu-Rohrlich boxes and nests a van Dam’s protocol . In Section 4 we prove an upper bound on the bias of any f𝑓f-QRAC with SR (and f𝑓f-RAC) using the same method of the hypercontractive inequality for matrix-valued functions from . Let f:{−1,1}k→{−1,1}:𝑓→superscript11𝑘11f:\\{-1,1\\}^{k}\\to\\{-1,1\\} be a Boolean function. For any n​↦𝜀​m𝑛𝜀maps-to𝑚n\\overset{\\varepsilon}{\\mapsto}m f𝑓f-QRAC with SR and k=o​(n)𝑘𝑜𝑛k=o(n) the following holds: for any η>2​ln⁡2𝜂22\\eta>2\\ln{2} there is a constant Cηsubscript𝐶𝜂C_{\\eta} such that where L1,ℓ​(f)=∑T⊆[k]|T|=ℓ|f^​(T)|subscript𝐿1ℓ𝑓subscript𝑇delimited-[]𝑘𝑇ℓ^𝑓𝑇L_{1,\\ell}(f)=\\sum_{\\begin{subarray}{c}T\\subseteq[k]\\\\\n|T|=\\ell\\end{subarray}}\\big{|}\\widehat{f}(T)\\big{|} is the 111-norm of the ℓℓ\\ell-th level of the Fourier transform of f𝑓f. One can see that the above result is a generalization of Theorem 4. Indeed, for Parity on k𝑘k bits, L1,ℓ​(XORk)=1subscript𝐿1ℓsubscriptXOR𝑘1L_{1,\\ell}(\\operatorname{XOR}_{k})=1 iff ℓ=kℓ𝑘\\ell=k, and so Eq. (1) is recovered. The following corollary from Theorem 13 helps to compare the bias upper bound to the bias lower bounds from Theorem 12. Let f:{−1,1}k→{−1,1}:𝑓→superscript11𝑘11f:\\{-1,1\\}^{k}\\to\\{-1,1\\} be a Boolean function. For any n​↦𝜀​m𝑛𝜀maps-to𝑚n\\overset{\\varepsilon}{\\mapsto}m f𝑓f-QRAC with SR and k=o​(n)𝑘𝑜𝑛k=o(n) the following holds: for any η>2​ln⁡2𝜂22\\eta>2\\ln{2} there is a constant Cηsubscript𝐶𝜂C_{\\eta} such that where deg⁡(f)=max⁡{|S|:f^​(S)≠0}deg𝑓:𝑆^𝑓𝑆0\\operatorname{deg}(f)=\\max\\{|S|:\\widehat{f}(S)\\neq 0\\} is the degree of f𝑓f and q=η​mn𝑞𝜂𝑚𝑛q=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\eta m}{n}}. Taking deg⁡(f)deg𝑓\\operatorname{deg}(f) to be upper-bounded by a constant (for example, if k=O​(1)𝑘𝑂1k=O(1)), our bias upper bound matches our bias lower bounds for f𝑓f-RAC/QRAC with SR up to a global multiplicative constant and a multiplicative constant η𝜂\\sqrt{\\eta} in the parameter q𝑞q. We conjecture that the parameter q𝑞q can be improved to mn𝑚𝑛\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{n}}, which might require a stronger version of the hypercontractive inequality.\nOther corollaries from Theorem 13 are derived in Section 4 and compared to our bias lower bounds. Upper bound (2) does not apply to f𝑓f-EARACs. Previously, it was known that for the special case of standard EARACs (m=1𝑚1m=1), the bias ε𝜀\\varepsilon is upper-bounded by 1/n1𝑛1/\\sqrt{n} (Theorem 5). This upper bound can generalised to EARACs with m>1𝑚1m>1 assuming an independence condition (Section 3.4). The resulting bound is ε≤m/n𝜀𝑚𝑛\\varepsilon\\leq\\sqrt{m/n}. We view this as evidence that the bias lower bound for the general case of f𝑓f-EARACs given in Theorem 12 should actually be tight. Regarding the quantity Stabq⁡[f]subscriptStab𝑞𝑓\\operatorname{Stab}_{q}[f] itself, it can be nicely related to the Fourier coefficients of f𝑓f (see Theorem 17 in the next section). We briefly mention the noise stability for a few functions. For Parity (XORksubscriptXOR𝑘\\operatorname{XOR}_{k}), Stabq⁡[XORk]=qksubscriptStab𝑞subscriptXOR𝑘superscript𝑞𝑘\\operatorname{Stab}_{q}[\\operatorname{XOR}_{k}]=q^{k}, and, more generally, for any function χS​(x)=∏i∈Sxisubscript𝜒𝑆𝑥subscriptproduct𝑖𝑆subscript𝑥𝑖\\chi_{S}(x)=\\prod_{i\\in S}x_{i}, Stabq⁡[χS]=q|S|subscriptStab𝑞subscript𝜒𝑆superscript𝑞𝑆\\operatorname{Stab}_{q}[\\chi_{S}]=q^{|S|}. As for the Majority function (MAJksubscriptMAJ𝑘\\operatorname{MAJ}_{k}), one can show that [46, Theorem 5.18] 2π​arcsin⁡q≤Stabq⁡[MAJk]≤2π​arcsin⁡q+O​(11−q2​k)2𝜋𝑞subscriptStab𝑞subscriptMAJ𝑘2𝜋𝑞𝑂11superscript𝑞2𝑘\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\arcsin{q}\\leq\\operatorname{Stab}_{q}[\\operatorname{MAJ}_{k}]\\leq\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\arcsin{q}+O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-q^{2}}\\sqrt{k}}\\right). Other examples can be found in 1. Moreover, a randomized algorithm for approximating the noise stability of monotone Boolean functions up to relative error was proposed in .

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object. Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. Generate exactly 40 titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning."
