      "content": "Paper Title: Self-Training Vision Language BERTs with a Unified Conditional Model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLarge scale pretraining has become the dominating approach in various natural language processing tasks. The success of large scale pretraining is due to a large amount of language training data available everywhere and the self-training algorithm. Unlike language pretraining, vision language pretraining requires paired image and language data, which restricts the scale of vision language BERTs’ pretraining. In this paper, we propose a self-training approach that allows to pretrain VL-BERTs using unlabeled image data. Self-training is usually done by iterating the following three steps: 1) training with labeled data, 2) generating pseudo labels for unlabeled data, 3) mixing the labeled data and unlabeled data with pseudo labels to retrain the network. However, the self-training of vision language BERTs is nontrivial due to the following reasons. First, although auto-encoding models (e.g., BERTs  ) perform well on the natural language understanding and image language understanding tasks, they cannot be directly applied to the generation task without finetuning . In practice, it is difficult to generate pseudo labels for unlabeled data using pretrained BERTs in the zero-shot setting. Although these models can be finetuned to perform generation tasks, the zero-shot generation of pseudo labels is important since it saves the time of extra finetuning and avoids adding additional bias from the finetuning datasets. Second, current common practice in vision language BERT pretraining uses various image descriptions to train, such as image captions, dense captions and questions. Those image descriptions have significant differences, making it difficult for an unconditional model to learn to generate adequate pseudo captions for unlabeled images. Hence, although self-training has shown its effectiveness in various tasks [ref]4 [ref]5, how to use it effectively in training vision language BERTs is not yet studied. To this end, we propose the Unified Conditional Model (UCM) and a set of vision language BERT self-training methods to tackle the above issues. Compared with previous methods, our model has the following advantages: First, our method combines auto-encoding training   and auto-regressive training [ref]6 in a unified framework, which enables our method to perform well on natural language understanding tasks and at the same time effectively generate pseudo labels. Second, we propose a novel conditional training method that enables our model to conditional generate various types of captions, including COCO style captions, VG style dense captions and questions. Unified Conditional Model (UCM). Compared with traditional vision language BERTs, our proposed UCM has two unique properties. First, the model is able to generate different contents based on a condition flag input, such as image captions, dense captions, and questions. Second, the condition flag can be used as an identifier to help down-stream finetuning. The proposed UCM shares similar model structures with existing 2-stream vision language BERT models  . Specifically, it contains one image encoder, two language encoders with shared weights, and several layers of cross attention layers. In training, different data types are assigned to their condition signals. The model is trained with both bi-directional prediction masks and one-directional prediction masks in parallel. For bi-directional prediction masks, the model performs conditional masked language modeling prediction, masked object prediction, image-text matching, and an auxiliary question answering loss. For one-directional prediction masks, the model performs one-directional masked conditional language modeling and masked object prediction tasks. When the model is used to generate pseudo labels for unlabeled images, the model will run forward propagation with one-directional prediction masks only. The condition signal enables the model to generate diverse descriptions for pictures. Fig. 1 shows an example of generated image descriptions using different condition flags. When the model is used for finetuning image language understanding tasks, only the bi-directional mask is used. During finetuning, we use the condition flag as prior knowledge for finetuning. For example, when finetuning VQA tasks, the input is given an additional condition flag to show the input is a question. Results show that the presence of condition flags improves down-stream finetuning performance. Vision Language BERT Self-Training. The self-training method is used in the pretraining stage to further enlarge the scale of data that can be used in pretraining. Our self-training approach follows the self-training pipeline with extra optimization for vision language BERTs. Generally, the self-training process is done in three steps. First, we use the labeled image data to train a teacher model and then use the trained model to generate pseudo labels on unlabeled image data. We then combine the labeled data and pseudo labeled data to train a student model. Finally, the process is iterated by putting the student model as a new teacher. In our task, the pseudo labels are generated COCO style image captions and VG style dense captions by UCM. In order to generate high quality and diverse pseudo labels, we propose three methods. First, we randomly mask object regions when generating captions. This method makes sure the model can focus on different visual areas when describing the images. Second, we randomly sample a word from the top-K predictions in each prediction step, such that even for the same image, the model could generate various outputs. Finally, we use the condition flag to control the contents generated.\nWe show both qualitative and quantitative comparisons in experiments section. Experimental-wise, besides the commonly used COCO and VG datasets, we train our model with only 300k extra unlabeled data from Conceptual Caption  by removing the provided captions. The original Conceptual Caption dataset provides machine-generated captions. They are noisy  and often used as out-of-domain training data 0. The model could out-perform the model trained with the whole three million extra data in various down-stream finetuning tasks. Also, we provide comprehensive ablation studies of the training settings. To summarize our contributions: We propose the first Unified Conditional BERT model that could perform zero-shot conditional image-based language generation. Traditional bi-directional vision language models are unable to be used to generate languages directly and they are not conditional, such that the users can’t control the generation styles. We propose a self-training method for using unlabeled images in vision language pretraining. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work using self-training in vision language pretraining. With only 300k extra image data, we achieve competitive or better performances within models with similar model size trained with 3 million extra data.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: making it difficult for an unconditional model to learn to generate adequate pseudo captions for unlabeled images.
