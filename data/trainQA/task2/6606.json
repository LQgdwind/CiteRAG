      "content": "Paper Title: Prefender: A Prefetching Defender against Cache Side Channel Attacks as A Pretender\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCache side channel attack is one of the most powerful micro-architectural side channel attacks, where the attacker can directly detect the cache states and obtain accurate timing information for inferring the secrets. Many researchers have studied various types of effective attack methods. Kosher  firstly mentioned that the timing difference in the cache can be exploited to extract cryptographic secrets. Osvik  proposed Evict+Time and Prime+Probe methods to attack the AES algorithm .\nIn 2014, Yarom  proposed a more powerful and more fine-grained method, called Flush+Reload. This method utilizes the flush instruction supported by some architectures, for example, clflush in x86. Moreover, since it is based on shared memory, it has much lower noise and finer granularity, e.g., a single cacheline. The Flush+Reload has more variants, one of which is Evict+Reload . The Evict+Reload is applicable to devices that do not support a flush instruction because it replaces the flush behavior with the cache eviction. Research on cache side channel attacks continues to spring up, especially after Spectre  and Meltdown [ref]4 attacks were reported. These attacks exploit one of the most important microarchitectural optimizations, speculation, to get sensitive data. They and their variants show that many critical microarchitectural components, including Branch Target Buffer (BTB) , Return Stack Buffer (RSB) 4, Floating Point Unit (FPU) 5, Page-table Entry , Intel SGX enclave 6, may inadvertently leak their internal states, including potential secrets while running. However, even if these attacks are based on different hardware components, most of them still leave the secrets in the cache and use cache side channel attacks such as Flush+Reload, Evict+Reload, Prime+Probe, etc., as mentioned before, to extract the information. Therefore, Prefender has a broad defense scale because it is able to defend against the cache side channel attacks that exploit the timing difference of cache access latency, including both traditional and transient execution based ones.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: not support a flush instruction because it replaces the flush behavior with the cache eviction.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
