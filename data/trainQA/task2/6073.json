Dashti et al. ; \n  flammable limits upper for organic compounds (FlmUO) by S. Yuan et al. ; \n  flammable limits lower for gas (FlmLG) and \n  flammable limits upper for gas (FlmUG) by S. Kondo et al. [ref]34;\nand \n  energy of highest occupied molecular orbital (Homo), \n  energy of lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (Lumo), \n  the energy difference between Homo and Lumo (Gap) and \n  electric dipole moment (mu) provided by MoleculeNet ,\nwhere all these from Homo\n  to mu are based on a common data set QM9. The data set QM9 contains more than 130,000 compounds.\nIn our experiment, we use a set of 1,000 compounds randomly selected from the data set.\nWe do not exclude any polymer from the original data set as outliers for these properties. Setting Data Sets\nFor each property π𝜋\\pi,\nwe first select a set ΛΛ\\Lambda of chemical elements\nand then collect a data set 𝒞πsubscript𝒞𝜋\\mathcal{C}_{\\pi} on chemical graphs\nover the set ΛΛ\\Lambda of chemical elements.\nTo construct the data set 𝒞πsubscript𝒞𝜋\\mathcal{C}_{\\pi},\nwe eliminated chemical compounds that do not satisfy\none of the following: the graph is connected,\nthe number of carbon atoms is at least four,\nand the number of non-hydrogen neighbors of each atom is\nat most 4. We set a branch-parameter ρ𝜌{\\rho} to be 2,\nintroduce linear descriptors defined by the two-layered graph\nin the chemical model without suppressing hydrogen\nand use the sets Dπ(1)superscriptsubscript𝐷𝜋1D_{\\pi}^{(1)} and Dπ(2)superscriptsubscript𝐷𝜋2D_{\\pi}^{(2)}\nof linear and quadratic descriptors\n(see Appendix A for the details). For properties π∈{\\pi\\in\\{BHL, FlmL, FlmLG, FlmU, FlmUO, FlmUG, OdrL, OdrU, Vp}}\\},\nwe take the logarithmic measurement of observed values a​(ℂ),ℂ∈𝒟π𝑎ℂℂsubscript𝒟𝜋a(\\mathbb{C}),\\mathbb{C}\\in\\mathcal{D}_{\\pi}, where\nlog⁡(a​(ℂ)+c)𝑎ℂ𝑐\\log(a(\\mathbb{C})+c) (c=10−8𝑐superscript108c=10^{-8} if π=𝜋absent\\pi=Vp and c=0𝑐0c=0 otherwise)\nis used as the observed value in our experiments. We normalize the range of each linear descriptor and\nthe range of observed values a​(ℂ),ℂ∈𝒞π𝑎ℂℂsubscript𝒞𝜋a(\\mathbb{C}),\\mathbb{C}\\in\\mathcal{C}_{\\pi}. We conducted an experiment of comparing the following five methods of constructing a prediction function. LLR: use Lasso linear regression on the set Dπ(1)superscriptsubscript𝐷𝜋1D_{\\pi}^{(1)} of linear descriptors\n(see  for the detail of the implementation); ANN: use ANN on the set Dπ(1)superscriptsubscript𝐷𝜋1D_{\\pi}^{(1)} of linear descriptors\n(see  for the detail of the implementation); ALR: use adjustive linear regression on the set Dπ(1)superscriptsubscript𝐷𝜋1D_{\\pi}^{(1)} of linear descriptors\n(see  for the detail of the implementation); RLR: the learning method proposed by Zhu et al. \nthat chooses a set of descriptors from\nthe set Dπ(1)∪Dπ(2)superscriptsubscript𝐷𝜋1superscriptsubscript𝐷𝜋2D_{\\pi}^{(1)}\\cup D_{\\pi}^{(2)} of linear and quadratic descriptors and\nthen constructs a prediction function by applying MLR (multidimensional linear regression)\nto the resulting set of descriptors; and HPS:\nour method of computing a hyperplane to split a given data set\ninto two subsets\nand constructing a prediction function to each subset independently.\nBy conducting a preliminary experiment,\nwe predetermine a threshold θ𝜃\\theta and a hyperplane (w,b),w∈ℝ|Dπ(1)|𝑤𝑏𝑤superscriptℝsuperscriptsubscript𝐷𝜋1(w,b),w\\in\\mathbb{R}^{|D_{\\pi}^{(1)}|} and b∈ℝ𝑏ℝb\\in\\mathbb{R}\nin the feature space of linear descriptors.\nIn a cross-validation, we split a training data set 𝒞^π⊆𝒞πsubscript^𝒞𝜋subscript𝒞𝜋\\widehat{\\mathcal{C}}_{\\pi}\\subseteq\\mathcal{C}_{\\pi}\ninto two subsets 𝒞^π(j),j=1,2formulae-sequencesuperscriptsubscript^𝒞𝜋𝑗𝑗12\\widehat{\\mathcal{C}}_{\\pi}^{(j)},j=1,2 and construct\na prediction function ψjsubscript𝜓𝑗\\psi_{j} to each subset 𝒞^π(j)superscriptsubscript^𝒞𝜋𝑗\\widehat{\\mathcal{C}}_{\\pi}^{(j)}\nby applying one of the above four methods (i)-(iv). Table 1 shows the size and range of data sets that\nwe prepared for each chemical property to construct a prediction function,\nwhere we denote the following: π𝜋\\pi: the name of a chemical property used in the experiment.

Constructing Prediction Functions\nFor each chemical property π𝜋\\pi, we construct a prediction function\nby one of the four methods (i)-(iv). For methods (i)-(iv), we used the same implementation\ndue to Zhu et al.   \nand omit the details. Tables 2 shows\nthe results on constructing prediction functions,\nwhere we denote the following: π,Λ𝜋Λ\\pi,\\Lambda: an instance with a chemical property π𝜋\\pi\nand a set ΛΛ\\Lambda of chemical elements selected from the data set 𝒞πsubscript𝒞𝜋\\mathcal{C}_{\\pi}.

HPS:\nthe median of test R2superscriptR2\\mathrm{R}^{2}\nin ten 5-fold cross-validations for the prediction function obtained\nby HPS, where a prediction function is obtained by combining\nthe prediction functions constructed for the first and second subsets. the score of LLR, ANN, ALR, RLR or HPS marked with “*” indicates\nthe best performance among the five methods for the property π𝜋\\pi; θ𝜃\\theta: the threshold used in HPS to split the data set 𝒞πsubscript𝒞𝜋\\mathcal{C}_{\\pi}. amax(1),amin(2)subscriptsuperscript𝑎1subscriptsuperscript𝑎2a^{(1)}_{\\max},a^{(2)}_{\\min}:\nthe maximum observed value a​(ℂ)𝑎ℂa(\\mathbb{C}) of a compound ℂ∈𝒞(1)ℂsuperscript𝒞1\\mathbb{C}\\in\\mathcal{C}^{(1)} and\nthe minimum observed value a​(ℂ)𝑎ℂa(\\mathbb{C}) of a compound ℂ∈𝒞(2)ℂsuperscript𝒞2\\mathbb{C}\\in\\mathcal{C}^{(2)}\nin HPS: |𝒞(1)|,|𝒞(2)|superscript𝒞1superscript𝒞2|\\mathcal{C}^{(1)}|,|\\mathcal{C}^{(2)}|:\nthe sizes of the first subset 𝒞(1)superscript𝒞1\\mathcal{C}^{(1)} and the second subset 𝒞(2)superscript𝒞2\\mathcal{C}^{(2)}\nin HPS.

𝒞(2)superscript𝒞2\\mathcal{C}^{(2)}-R2:\nthe name of the method (one of (i)-(iv))\nused to construct a prediction function to the second subset in HPS and\nthe median of test R2superscriptR2\\mathrm{R}^{2}\nin ten 5-fold cross-validations for the prediction function over the second subset. The running time of constructing two prediction functions for subsets 𝒞(1)superscript𝒞1\\mathcal{C}^{(1)} and 𝒞(2)superscript𝒞2\\mathcal{C}^{(2)}\nin HPS was at most around 13 seconds.\nTo execute RLR, selecting a subset of linear and quadratic descriptors\nis the most time consuming part, which took from 1162 to 44356 seconds. In Table 2, HPS attains the best score of the median test R2\namong the five methods in most cases.\nEspecially the improvement over the methods (i)-(iv) is significant for properties\nAt, FlmL, FlmU, FlmUO, FlmUG, OdrL and OdrU.
