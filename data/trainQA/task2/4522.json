      "content": "Paper Title: A Linear Programming Approach for Resource-Aware Information-Theoretic Tree Abstractions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe identification and preservation of task-relevant information has long been considered central to the development of intelligent systems  .\nHowever, the design of task-relevant abstractions in autonomous systems has been traditionally handled by system engineers, who provide specific expert knowledge of the problem domain by specifying features that are important for the specific task at hand   .\nThe use of abstractions in autonomous systems is motivated by the need to systematically reduce the complexity of problem-solving, such as planning and decision-making, by removing details that are considered irrelevant for the specific task  .\nAs a result, the abstraction process allows autonomous agents to simplify the problem by focusing on aspects of the domain deemed to be task-relevant, while removing (or rather, ignoring) those details that are irrelevant  .\nDespite the fact that the ability to form task-relevant abstractions is considered central to the development of intelligent systems, many existing frameworks that leverage the power of hierarchical abstractions rely heavily on user-provided rules to form reduced representations of the problem domain . Consider, for example, the task of planning a collision-free path in an autonomous driving scenario.\nAssuming that a graph-based planning algorithm is employed to generate a path, such as A∗ or Dijkstra, an autonomous system must balance environment complexity (e.g., resolution) with the on-board resources available to execute the graph search in order to complete the task successfully in the presence of computational constraints.\nTo illustrate the trade-off between environment resolution and search complexity, consider the two environments shown in Fig. 1.\nFor each of the two abstractions shown in Fig. 1, one may construct a corresponding reduced graph whose vertices are the grid cell centers of the multi-resolution depiction and the corresponding edges encode cell connectivity.\nAs a result, executing graph search algorithms such as A∗ and Dijkstra on reduced graphs with fewer vertices, that is, those that correspond to lower-resolution representations, have better worst-case time complexity as compared with performing the graph-search on reduced graphs that are derived from higher-resolution depictions that contain a greater number of vertices .\nHowever, designing such abstractions is not trivial in that it requires the autonomous system to balance the model (environment) complexity with retaining as much information in regards to what is relevant to the task (in the example presented in Fig. 1 this may be the occupancy probability of the finest-resolution grid cells). Generating suitable compressed representations requires the formulation of a mathematical optimization problem that specifies which aspects of the problem are important (or, equivalently, relevant) and which can be neglected, or ignored, when forming a latent (e.g., compressed) representation of the problem.\nSuch a mathematical formulation requires the specification of two components.\nThe first component is a measure that captures the reduced model complexity, or rather, the degree of achieved compression compared to the original representation.\nThe second component is a measure that quantifies the quality of the abstract representation.\nThe terms driving compression and representation quality are in conflict with one another, in the sense that a higher-quality representation comes at the cost of a more complex abstract space, and vice-versa.\nThe design of abstractions is then formally posed as an optimization problem where the goal is to maximize compression subject to constraints on the reduced model quality. The construction of the abstract, or compressed, representations of the environment is then subject to the definition of the measures that capture model complexity and quality.\nBy changing the measures that capture these two quantities, we arrive at different abstraction frameworks.\nIt should be noted that the specification of measures that capture model complexity and quality are often not trivial for a given task, but are vital to the construction of a good abstract space, as they implicitly define what details should be retained, and which can be removed, when forming a compressed representation.\nTo illustrate this trade-off, consider the framework of rate-distortion theory, which was developed by information theorists in order to encode signals for transmission over noisy communication channels .\nRate-distortion theory formulates an optimization problem where the goal is to maximize compression subject to an upper bound on the expected distortion (i.e., bound the desired model quality).\nCompressed representations that achieve lower values of expected distortion are considered to be of higher quality.\nIn its formulation, the rate-distortion framework measures the model complexity by utilizing Shannon’s mutual information (MI) between the original and compressed signals, and quantifies the model quality through a non-negative distortion function.\nThe use of mutual information as a measure of the model complexity is rooted in its use in communication systems, where it quantifies the rate of codes required to describe a signal to a given level of detail .\nCrucially, however, rate-distortion theory does not specify the distortion measure, nor does it provide with any guidance how one should be constructed, assuming instead that the function is provided by the system designer .\nThe selection of the distortion function is crucial, as it defines what details of the original signal should be retained in order to achieve low values of expected distortion (high model quality).\nSpecifying a distortion function for a given clustering task is difficult and non-intuitive, as it may not be clear from the problem formulation which features of the data should be preserved to accomplish a desired objective . In order to combat some of the difficulties surrounding the specification of a distortion function, the work of  introduced the Information-Bottleneck (IB) method.\nIn contrast to the approach employed by classical rate-distortion theory, the IB method does not rely on the specification of a distortion function, and instead introduces a third variable, referred to as the relevant random variable, that contains task-relevant information we wish to retain through the process of abstraction.\nConsequently, the IB formulation replaces the distortion measure with the mutual information between the relevant variable and compressed representation.\nConsidering their similarities, it is unsurprising that the IB method has been informally viewed as a specific instance of the rate-distortion problem, where the distortion measure is taken to be that of the mutual information between the compressed and relevant random variables  [ref]8  .\nBy virtue of its formulation, the IB problem naturally captures the notion of designing abstractions that are maximally retentive regarding task-specific relevant information. In the autonomous systems community, abstractions have seen widespread use as a way to reduce the complexity of decision-making and path-planning problems 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7.\nFor example, in the works of 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7, the authors create coarse-grained, multi-resolution, representations of an environment for path-planning to reduce the computational complexity of executing graph-search algorithms.\nThe idea is that, by leveraging abstractions to create a reduced graph of the world containing fewer vertices than the full-resolution map, the execution time of off-the-shelf graph-search algorithms, such as A∗ and Dijkstra, can be improved at the cost of sub-optimal paths.\nIn designing the abstractions, the works of 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 consider the relevant information as the region nearest the autonomous agent, as autonomous agents do not generally need to represent environment information that is physically distant from the vehicle with high resolution, as it is not crucial for short-range obstacle avoidance and sensing.\nTo strike a balance between (path) optimality and environment complexity the planning frameworks in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 sequentially re-solve the planning problem as the agent traverses the world.\nCrucially, the definition of information relevance employed by these works is somewhat arbitrary, and their reliance on the specification of tuning parameters that characterize the properties of the abstractions is a notable drawback. Our goal in this chapter is to utilize the powerful approaches for signal compression to rigorously design task-relevant environment abstractions for autonomous systems by appealing to methods from information theory.\nWe aim to develop frameworks for the emergence of environment abstractions in autonomous systems that are task-driven and require minimal domain knowledge or interaction with the system designer.\nTo accomplish our goal, we propose to utilize concepts from information theory, specifically the IB principle, in order to formulate optimal encoder problems that give rise to task-relevant abstractions as a function of agent resource limitations.\nThe proposed method aims to afford agents the ability to design abstractions autonomously as a function of the task, while considering system-level resource constraints in a principled and rigorous manner.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: viewed as a specific instance of the rate-distortion problem, where the distortion measure is taken to be that of the mutual information between the compressed and relevant random variables  [ref]8  .\nBy virtue of its formulation, the IB problem naturally captures the notion of designing abstractions that are maximally retentive regarding task-specific relevant information.
