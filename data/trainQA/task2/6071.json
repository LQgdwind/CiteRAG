      "content": "Paper Title: StyleLipSync: Style-based Personalized Lip-sync Video Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStyle-based generators 8  7 demonstrate the power of their semantic latent spaces, namely ùí≤ùí≤\\mathcal{W}, in image generation, image editing  , and video generation . GAN-inversion    9  utilizes the pre-trained GANs to invert an image into corresponding latent code so one can manipulate the attributes of the image only within the latent space. Extended ùí≤+limit-fromùí≤\\mathcal{W}+ have been shown its much expressive power. For instance, pSp 9 adopts the feature pyramid networks (FPNs) 2 to use ùí≤+limit-fromùí≤\\mathcal{W}+, which follow the nature of the progressive generation 5 of StyleGAN 8 and achieves state-of-the-art performance in image-to-image translation (e.g., face in-painting). Similarly, we utilize ùí≤+limit-fromùí≤\\mathcal{W}+ for diverse and strong lip prior since we aim to build a lip-sync video generative model of arbitrary identity. Recent works [ref]42   not only adopt pre-trained GAN prior as their decoder but also introduce a skip-connection that concatenates the encoded and generated features, which helps the model preserve 2D spatial information. Specifically, GPEN [ref]42 uses skip-connection that concatenates the encoded and generated features and achieves state-of-the-art performance in blind face restoration. StyleSwap  adopts it to face swap and introduces the ToMask branch that predicts the target facial attribute regions for swapping in a supervised manner. In contrast to those methods, we use an additive skip connection more efficient than the concatenation, along with the unsupervised predicted masked sum, which helps the decoder distinguish the target lip region from the whole face and therefore increases the lip image fidelity.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: (e.g., face in-painting). Similarly, we utilize ùí≤+limit-fromùí≤\\mathcal{W}+ for diverse and strong lip prior since we aim to build a lip-sync video generative model of arbitrary identity.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
