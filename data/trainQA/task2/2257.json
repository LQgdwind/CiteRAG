      "content": "Paper Title: Explanatory Pluralism in Explainable AI\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere is no doubt that we should be exacting in our demand on explanations for the outputs, functioning, and employment of AI models, given that they are increasingly implicated in decision making that impact humans with potentially undesirable outcomes [ref]31. However, just what we mean by ‘explanations’ in the field of Explainable AI (XAI) is currently unclear  . What is clear is that many different stakeholders have different constraints on the explanations they want from the field . There is a pressing danger that what explains appropriately and sufficiently is lost in translation from stakeholders to practitioners, and vice versa. In other words, even if the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) strongly enforces111Whether a ‘right to explain’ exists has been debated on the basis of just what explanation is requested by the GDPR [ref]33 . This debate in the literature further highlights the urgency of the present discussion to prevent possible equivocation of the different types of explanation. that explanations be given when decisions are contested, it is a pyrrhic victory if there are no clear evaluative criteria on the explanations given or worse, that an inappropriate set of evaluative criteria is used to determine which explanation stands as an admissible one.\n Therefore, when explanations are requested from AI models, and when explanatory demand is placed on the field of Explainable AI, we should first ask some important questions. Why do we ask for ‘explanations’ rather than something else to fulfill the desired goal in posing such a request? What objective or purpose is the explanation supposed to serve in a given context? How should we judge whether a given ‘explanation’ satisfied those objectives or purposes?\n Without such clarificatory questions, we run the danger of talking past each other in developmental efforts in XAI and in stakeholder’s desiderata for the explanatory products of the field. As astutely noted by Mittelstadt, Russell and Wachter: “many different people …, are all prepared to agree on the importance of explainable AI. However, very few stop to check what they are agreeing to” . Langer et.al agree that more clarity is required: “Consistent terminology and conceptual clarity for the desiderata are pivotal and there is a need to explicate the various desiderata more precisely\" . Indeed, going forward, practitioners would benefit from clarity on the requirements for explanations, and stakeholders would benefit from clarity on the limits of explanatory methods produced by the field which would improve their choice of methods to employ.\n Much recent work in XAI investigates just what are the explanatory demands placed onto XAI by way of analyzing social-psychological constraints   [ref]28, how explanations function in the law  , identifying stakeholders and their desiderata , and philosophical treatments of explanatory methods  [ref]28. These reviews correctly identify that explanations have a distinct social dimension as a process rather than purely as a product or text   ; that explanations should be contrastive, selective, and non-statistical in their content  ; and that within a social context, explanations of model output do not suffice in isolation .\n However, talk of explanations in XAI have remained monolithic. In contrast, the stance I would like to present and defend in this paper is one of Explanatory Pluralism in XAI: the notion that there are many different types of explanation requested from the field for which have different effective treatment by means of methods (what we should produce) and different explanatory powers by range of application contexts (where we can use them). The primary contribution of this paper is a taxonomy, as illustrated in Figure 1, distinguishing the different types of explanation along a Mechanistic-Social axis and a Particular-General axis by identifying the different types of intervention they target. Furthermore, the paper will organize present methods with more specific language introduced using this taxonomy while avoiding the loaded term ‘explanation’.\n The idea that there are different explanations requested from XAI is not new  . However, organization of different explanatory methods have mostly been done in descriptive terms . In this paper, I present a taxonomy based on evaluative terms. XAI methods find membership in the proposed taxonomy by virtue of differences in evaluative criteria rather than differences in descriptive characteristics (when they are assessed – ex-ante/post-hoc, generality of application – agnostic/specific, output format, input data, or problem type ). By aligning XAI methods with what interventions they target, the success of each method can then be evaluated on the effectiveness of different interventions. The explanatory pluralistic view is also non-reductive, meaning that each category of explanation thus organized do not subsume other categories even though dependency relations may exist between them. I justify my organization of the taxonomy by appeal to recent work on the nature of scientific explanation in the Philosophy of Science, specifically Woodward’s manipulationist account of causation , Craver’s mechanistic account of scientific explanations , and causal relevance . This normative, philosophically grounded taxonomy serves to specify more clearly what the word ‘explanation’ means in different contexts.\n I begin by reviewing in Section 2 the diverse explanatory demands for explainability in AI, emphasizing what we are supposed to explain and what we think explanations will help us to achieve. Next in Section 3, I provide relevant contemporary philosophical background drawing from the rich literature in Philosophy of Scientific Explanations to motivate the organization in my proposed taxonomy. In Section 4, I derive and define the Mechanistic-Social, Particular-General taxonomy illustrated in Figure 1. Furthermore, in Section 5, I take a pragmatic interventionist stance and organize present methods in XAI into each of the four categories identified by the proposed taxonomy, showing how methods in each evaluative category fulfill different explanatory demands. Finally, I conclude with two recommendations and highlight that XAI is not merely a way of looking back and within our models but a way of looking forwards and outwards, a perspective ineliminably involved in the development of truly intelligent systems.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: on explanations for the outputs, functioning, and employment of AI models, given that they are increasingly implicated in decision making that impact humans with potentially undesirable outcomes [ref]31.
