      "content": "Paper Title: Applications of Random Algebraic Constructions to Hardness of Approximation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHere, we describe our conditional time lower bounds for the k𝑘k-𝖲𝖾𝗍𝖨𝗇𝗍𝖾𝗋𝗌𝖾𝖼𝗍𝗂𝗈𝗇𝖲𝖾𝗍𝖨𝗇𝗍𝖾𝗋𝗌𝖾𝖼𝗍𝗂𝗈𝗇\\mathsf{SetIntersection} problem. In order to set the context for the complexity of this problem, we briefly recall its complexity in the world of 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}. In the world of complexity, SetIntersection is well-known as a notorious problem to prove any kind of hardness of approximation result for; that said, there is a general belief that it is a hard problem as no non-trivial polynomial time approximation algorithms for this problem are known. However, to this date, even ruling out a PTAS under the standard 𝖯𝖯\\mathsf{P} ≠\\neq𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP} hypothesis remains open!777In contrast, it is fairly straightforward to show that the exact version of the problem is 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-hard . The best inapproximability result for this problem is based on assuming that 𝖲𝖠𝖳𝖲𝖠𝖳\\mathsf{SAT} problems of size n𝑛n cannot be solved by randomized algorithms in time 2nεsuperscript2superscript𝑛𝜀2^{n^{\\varepsilon}}, under which Xavier  shows that there is no polynomial time algorithm which can approximate SetIntersection up to polynomial factor. It is worth noting that to prove this inapproximability result, the author indirectly relies on the highly non-trivial and celebrated quasi-random PCP construction of Khot [ref]45. Given this context, it was truly a breakthrough when Lin , introducing some novel techniques, proved the total 𝖥𝖯𝖳𝖥𝖯𝖳\\mathsf{FPT} inapproximability of k𝑘k-𝖲𝖾𝗍𝖨𝗇𝗍𝖾𝗋𝗌𝖾𝖼𝗍𝗂𝗈𝗇𝖲𝖾𝗍𝖨𝗇𝗍𝖾𝗋𝗌𝖾𝖼𝗍𝗂𝗈𝗇\\mathsf{SetIntersection} (under 𝖶​≠𝖥𝖯𝖳𝖶delimited-[]1𝖥𝖯𝖳\\mathsf{W}\\neq\\mathsf{FPT} hypothesis). Of course, using our construction of threshold graphs (Theorem 1.4), we now have a very short proof of this powerful result (see footnote 6). Lin  further refined his inapproximability result and showed, assuming 𝖤𝖳𝖧𝖤𝖳𝖧\\mathsf{ETH}, that for sufficiently large k∈ℕ𝑘ℕk\\in\\mathbb{N}, no randomized no​(k)superscript𝑛𝑜𝑘n^{o(\\sqrt{k})}-time algorithm can approximate k𝑘k-𝖲𝖾𝗍𝖨𝗇𝗍𝖾𝗋𝗌𝖾𝖼𝗍𝗂𝗈𝗇𝖲𝖾𝗍𝖨𝗇𝗍𝖾𝗋𝗌𝖾𝖼𝗍𝗂𝗈𝗇\\mathsf{SetIntersection} to a factor n1/Ω​(k)superscript𝑛1Ω𝑘n^{1/\\Omega(\\sqrt{k})}. Clearly, this result is stronger than ruling out F​(k)𝐹𝑘F(k) approximation algorithms (for some function F𝐹F), but the running time lower bound is far from tight. The following result, the first application of our constructions, shows that we can improve on Lin’s result and obtain tight running time lower bounds under 𝖤𝖳𝖧𝖤𝖳𝖧\\mathsf{ETH} (albeit for weaker approximation factors). Let F:ℕ→ℕ:𝐹→ℕℕF\\colon\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{N} be any computable function. Assuming (randomized) 𝖤𝖳𝖧𝖤𝖳𝖧\\mathsf{ETH}, for sufficiently large k∈ℕ𝑘ℕk\\in\\mathbb{N}, no randomized no​(k)superscript𝑛𝑜𝑘n^{o(k)}-time algorithm can approximate k𝑘k-𝖲𝖾𝗍𝖨𝗇𝗍𝖾𝗋𝗌𝖾𝖼𝗍𝗂𝗈𝗇𝖲𝖾𝗍𝖨𝗇𝗍𝖾𝗋𝗌𝖾𝖼𝗍𝗂𝗈𝗇\\mathsf{SetIntersection} to a factor F​(k)𝐹𝑘F(k). In the world of fine-grained complexity, it is also of interest to prove, under stronger assumptions than 𝖤𝖳𝖧𝖤𝖳𝖧\\mathsf{ETH}, even tighter running time lower bounds than the no​(k)superscript𝑛𝑜𝑘n^{o(k)} bound above. In particular, one would like to rule out nk−0.1superscript𝑛𝑘0.1n^{k-0.1}-time algorithms for k𝑘k-𝖲𝖾𝗍𝖨𝗇𝗍𝖾𝗋𝗌𝖾𝖼𝗍𝗂𝗈𝗇𝖲𝖾𝗍𝖨𝗇𝗍𝖾𝗋𝗌𝖾𝖼𝗍𝗂𝗈𝗇\\mathsf{SetIntersection} under 𝖲𝖤𝖳𝖧𝖲𝖤𝖳𝖧\\mathsf{SETH}, essentially showing that the naïve exhaustive search algorithm for k𝑘k-𝖲𝖾𝗍𝖨𝗇𝗍𝖾𝗋𝗌𝖾𝖼𝗍𝗂𝗈𝗇𝖲𝖾𝗍𝖨𝗇𝗍𝖾𝗋𝗌𝖾𝖼𝗍𝗂𝗈𝗇\\mathsf{SetIntersection} is optimal. To the best of our knowledge, it was not known earlier if one could even rule out exact algorithms for k𝑘k-𝖲𝖾𝗍𝖨𝗇𝗍𝖾𝗋𝗌𝖾𝖼𝗍𝗂𝗈𝗇𝖲𝖾𝗍𝖨𝗇𝗍𝖾𝗋𝗌𝖾𝖼𝗍𝗂𝗈𝗇\\mathsf{SetIntersection} running in nk−0.1superscript𝑛𝑘0.1n^{k-0.1}-time under 𝖲𝖤𝖳𝖧𝖲𝖤𝖳𝖧\\mathsf{SETH}. We remedy this situation; the following strong inapproximability result under 𝖲𝖤𝖳𝖧𝖲𝖤𝖳𝖧\\mathsf{SETH} is the second application of our constructions. Let F:ℕ→ℕ:𝐹→ℕℕF\\colon\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{N} be any computable function. Assuming (randomized) 𝖲𝖤𝖳𝖧𝖲𝖤𝖳𝖧\\mathsf{SETH}, for every ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0 and integer k>1𝑘1k>1, no randomized nk​(1−ε)superscript𝑛𝑘1𝜀n^{k(1-\\varepsilon)}-time algorithm can approximate k𝑘k-𝖲𝖾𝗍𝖨𝗇𝗍𝖾𝗋𝗌𝖾𝖼𝗍𝗂𝗈𝗇𝖲𝖾𝗍𝖨𝗇𝗍𝖾𝗋𝗌𝖾𝖼𝗍𝗂𝗈𝗇\\mathsf{SetIntersection} to a factor F​(k)𝐹𝑘F(k). Both of these results are crucially reliant on our construction of panchromatic graphs; a broad outline is given in Section 1.2.2. It is worth noting that for the coloured variant of k𝑘k-𝖲𝖾𝗍𝖨𝗇𝗍𝖾𝗋𝗌𝖾𝖼𝗍𝗂𝗈𝗇𝖲𝖾𝗍𝖨𝗇𝗍𝖾𝗋𝗌𝖾𝖼𝗍𝗂𝗈𝗇\\mathsf{SetIntersection}, one can easily show tight running time lower bounds under 𝖤𝖳𝖧𝖤𝖳𝖧\\mathsf{ETH} and 𝖲𝖤𝖳𝖧𝖲𝖤𝖳𝖧\\mathsf{SETH} against exact algorithms, and by using non-trivial gap creating techniques, these tight running time lower bounds were extended against near polynomial factor approximation algorithms for the coloured variant in [ref]46. The situation (for the coloured variant) is similar in the world of 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP} as well; see . Finally, we remark that by using the hardness of approximation results in [ref]46 under the k𝑘k-SUM hypothesis, we can use the 𝖯𝖦𝖢𝖯𝖦𝖢\\mathsf{PGC} framework to rule out randomized nk​(1/2−ε)superscript𝑛𝑘12𝜀n^{k(1/2-\\varepsilon)}-time F​(k)𝐹𝑘F(k)-factor approximation algorithms for k𝑘k-𝖲𝖾𝗍𝖨𝗇𝗍𝖾𝗋𝗌𝖾𝖼𝗍𝗂𝗈𝗇𝖲𝖾𝗍𝖨𝗇𝗍𝖾𝗋𝗌𝖾𝖼𝗍𝗂𝗈𝗇\\mathsf{SetIntersection} under the k𝑘k-SUM hypothesis.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: up to polynomial factor.
