      "content": "Paper Title: BEVTrack: A Simple and Strong Baseline for 3D Single Object Tracking in Bird’s-Eye View\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEarly 3D SOT approaches   predominantly utilize RGB-D data and often adapt 2D Siamese networks     by integrating depth maps. However, variations in illumination and appearance can adversely affect the performance of such RGB-D techniques. SC3D  is the first 3D Siamese tracker based on shape completion that generates a large number of candidates in the search area and compares them with the cropped template, taking the most similar candidate as the tracking result. The pipeline relies on heuristic sampling and does not learn end-to-end, which is very time-consuming. To address these issues, P2B  develops an end-to-end framework by employing a shared point-based backbone for feature extraction, followed by a point-wise appearance-matching technique for target cues propagation. Ultimately, a Region Proposal Network is used to derive 3D proposals, of which the one with the peak score is selected as the final output. P2B reaches a balance between performance and efficiency, and many works  [ref]32 [ref]8 [ref]15  follow the same paradigm. Drawing inspiration from the success of transformers , many studies have incorporated elaborate attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction and target-specific propagation. For instance, PTT [ref]32 introduces the Point Track Transformer to enhance point features. PTTR [ref]8 presents the Point Relation Transformer for target-specific propagation and a Prediction Refinement Module for precision localization. Similarly, ST-Net [ref]15 puts forth an iterative correlation network, and CXTrack  presents the Target Centric Transformer to harness contextual information from consecutive frames. Unlike the Siamese paradigm, M2-Track  proposes a motion-centric paradigm, explicitly modeling the target’s motion between two successive frames. Despite achieving promising results on popular datasets, these trackers necessitate elaborate designs and solving multiple subtasks, as they typically rely on point-wise representation that hinders the efficient utilization of spatial information. Albeit V2B  recommends converting the enhanced point features into dense BEV feature maps to generate high-quality target proposals, it retains using the point-wise representation for target cues propagation. In contrast, our method adopts the BEV representation that facilitates utilizing spatial information and inherently encodes the implicit motion relations of the target as well as distractors, thus achieving superior performance while only using a single regression loss with a plain convolutional architecture.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: Proposal Network is used to derive 3D proposals, of which the one with the peak score is selected as the final output.
