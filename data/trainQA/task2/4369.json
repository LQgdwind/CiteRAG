Chinese characters are hieroglyphs, which can be divided into radical level or stroke level. At the radical level, Chinese characters with similar structures often have similar meanings. As shown in Fig.4, the meaning of the Chinese character ’鸣’ is ’the chirping of birds’, and ’鸣’ can be split into two radicals: ’口’(month) and’鸟’(bird). Thus, Chinese characters are naturally informative datasets [ref]33. This abundant information is often used to enrich Chinese word embeddings in NLP tasks. Meanwhile, according to the Five Strokes input method, most Chinese characters can be divided into no more than four basic Chinese character structures. Based on the ’Five Strokes input method’, GlyphCRM[ref]7 provides a bidirectional encoding method for Chinese characters with the Glyph. As shown in Fig. 4, ’\n鸣’ also can be encoded as ’KQY’ using the ’Five Strokes input method’. At stroke level, Chinese characters can be divided into five basic categories of strokes: horizontal, vertical, left falling, right falling, and turning according to the Chinese national standard GB18030-2005, as shown in Fig. 3.\nCompared to radical level, the stroke-level based presentation has superiority of conciseness and consistency, while radical level is more complex with less space effectiveness.\nMoreover, Chinese characters have some general writing principles such as ”from left to right”, ”top to bottom”, ”inside to outside”. With this principle, ’鸣’ can be encoded by strokes as ‘25135451’, as illustrated in Fig. 4. This property reminds us that when the model learns the orders of strokes of some characters, it can naturally master how to write new characters, even if these characters have never appeared in the training set.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: the meaning of the Chinese character ’鸣’ is ’the chirping of birds’, and ’鸣’ can be split into two radicals: ’口’(month) and’鸟’(bird).

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
