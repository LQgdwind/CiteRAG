      "content": "Paper Title: Model Checking Recursive Probabilistic Programs with Conditioning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nProbabilistic programming languages (PPLs)  provide primitives\nto sample from probability distributions and to perform inference tasks (queries)\nbased on evidence of observed events (conditioning).\nProbabilistic programs implement randomized algorithms \nsuch as QuickSort , as well as security and privacy  protocols.\nThey found application, with growing popularity, in AI and machine learning \nfor implementing complex Bayesian models concisely .\nConditioning is a first-class citizen in most modern PPLs.\nAt the same time, just like ordinary programming languages,\nthey support invoking procedures in a nested and possibly even recursive fashion     .\nRecently, the expressive power of nested queries turned out to be\nappealing to model meta-reasoning and planning in multi-agent systems   [ref]43.\nVerifying formal properties on such programs is a very challenging task\nand, despite significant theoretical contributions    [ref]47,\nthere are not yet model checking approaches and tools directly addressing these constructs all together. Motivating Example.\nThe probabilistic program of Fig. 1, introduced in [ref]43,\nis an instance of a Schelling coordination game .\nTwo agents, Alice and Bob, agreed to meet today but have not yet picked a café.\nAlice tries to infer the location by reasoning as follows:\nshe samples according to her preferences (here simplified in a binary choice with bias 0.55),\nqueries Bob’s choice by simulating his behavior, and then conditions on the two choices being the same.\nBob’s procedure differs in that he decides probabilistically whether to further query Alice’s behavior.\nThe two behaviors are then mutually recursive, allowing for nested reasoning about each other’s reasoning, in a potentially infinite manner.\nA global variable p parameterizes Bob’s decision, thus controlling the depth of the recursion.\nThe overall program represents the posterior distribution of Alice’s choice, conditioned on her reasoning about Bob’s reasoning about Alice’s reasoning… We can model the behavior of this program with a  Probabilistic Pushdown Automaton (pPDA)  :\nprocedure calls and returns are modeled as transitions that resp. push and pop a stack symbol;\nqueries also push one stack symbol, and false observations pop all stack symbols until the first query symbol,\neffectively unwinding the stack, and then re-start the query in a loop (as in rejection sampling ).\nIf they are finite-domain, we can model program variables, parameters and return values\ninto states and stack symbols. We are interested in verification of temporal properties of this program.\nFor example, what is the probability that a query to Alice() with p ≥λabsent𝜆\\geq\\lambda (pre-condition) is interrupted by a non-satisfied observe() statement (post-condition)?\nTo answer it, we need to reason about only the observations that affect the outer query, and skip events inside inner queries.\nThus, we must express our specification in a formalism that can skip parts of execution traces depending on stack behavior. Linear Temporal Logic\n(LTL)   is not expressive enough for this because it only captures regular properties [ref]3.\nWe need a logic with context-free modalities, such as  Precedence Oriented Temporal Logic (POTL) ,\nwhich achieves this with the χFusuperscriptsubscript𝜒𝐹𝑢\\mathop{\\chi_{F}^{u}} operator.\nThe requirement above corresponds to this POTL formula:\n□(𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐥∧Alice∧p≥λ⟹¬χFu𝐨𝐛𝐬)□𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐥Alice𝑝𝜆superscriptsubscript𝜒𝐹𝑢𝐨𝐛𝐬\\mathop{\\square}\\,(\\mathbf{call}\\land\\text{Alice}\\land p\\geq\\lambda\\implies\\neg\\mathop{\\chi_{F}^{u}}\\mathbf{obs}) Our approach.\nWe study the problem of probabilistic model checking of a pPDA against a POTL specification.\nPOTL captures the first-order definable fragment of Operator Precedence Languages,\na subclass of context-free languages that retains closure w.r.t. Boolean operations.\nFor model checking to be decidable, we impose a restriction on labels of pPDA states,\nwhich yields a new class of pPDA whose traces are OPLs. We name them Probabilistic Operator Precedence Automata. POTL formulas can be translated to Operator Precedence Büchi Automata, the class of automata that accepts OPLs.\nModel checking an ω𝜔\\omegaOPBA boils down to cycle detection queries in the support graph ,\na finite graph in which single edges represent fragments of runs\nin between the transitions pushing and popping the same stack symbol.\nWe introduce the support chain as the probabilistic counterpart of the support graph:\nit is a finite Markov chain that encodes all runs of a pOPA and preserves its probability distribution. A pOPA 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} and an ω𝜔\\omegaOPBA ℬℬ\\mathcal{B} decide whether to make a push or a pop move depending on Precedence Relations\nbetween labels: if they agree on PRs, their stacks are synchronized,\nwhich allows us to define a synchronized product G𝐺G of the support chain of 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} and the support graph of ℬℬ\\mathcal{B}.\nG𝐺G comes naturally if ℬℬ\\mathcal{B} is deterministic,\nbut this is not the case with ω𝜔\\omegaOPBA obtained from POTL formulas.\nWe thus exploit a property called separation .\nIn a Büchi automaton, it means that the languages it accepts starting from different states are disjoint.\nThe Vardi-Wolper construction  for LTL yields exponential-size separated Büchi automata .\nModel checking Markov Chains  and Recursive Markov Chains \nagainst separated Büchi automata allows for checking LTL specifications\nin single exponential time in formula length, i.e., without the additional exponential blowup of determinization.\nIn this paper, we study for the first time separation for pushdown automata\nand define separated ω𝜔\\omegaOPBA.\nThen, building on results from ,\nwe develop a model checking algorithm based on studying the Strongly Connected Components of G𝐺G. Building the support chain requires computing certain termination probabilities of 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}.\nQueries about them can be encoded in the  Existential first-order Theory of Real numbers (ETR),\nwhich is decidable in PSPACE.\nThus, we obtain an overall algorithm that runs in space polynomial in the size of 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A},\nand time (resp. space) exponential in formula length for qualitative (resp. quantitative) model checking.\nA straightforward approach to implement it employs a SMT solver supporting ETR.\nAlternatively, we devise a more practical semi-algorithm based on some recent results on (non)termination certificates for pPDA  .\nWhile it can be inconclusive, it relies only on numerical methods and linear programming.\nWe implemented both of them and conducted an experimental evaluation and comparison,\nwhich shows the feasibility of verifying some interesting properties on non-trivial programs, including Fig. 1.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first model checking implementation for pPDA. Related Work.\nTermination and model checking of regular specifications for pPDA and the equivalent formalism of RMCs have been studied theoretically in  .\nModel checking against Visibly Pushdown specifications was proven decidable in  upon imposing a visiblity condition on pPDA,\nwhile a model checking algorithm for the CaRet [ref]3 temporal logic was introduced in [ref]47.\nVisibly Pushdown Languages are strictly less expressive than OPLs :\nthe visibility conditions imposed on pPDA in these works make them less expressive than pOPA,\nand the same can be said of specifications.\nVPLs cannot naturally model observations,\nand [ref]47 does not support conditioning.\nMoreover, [ref]47 proceeds by determinizing automata encoding CaRet formulas,\nthus obtaining a 2-EXPTIME (resp. 2-EXPSPACE) complexity of qualitative (resp. quantitative) model checking,\nas opposed to our EXPTIME (resp. EXPSPACE) bound.\nThe only tools for pPDA analysis we know are PReMo  and Pray ,\nwhich compute resp. lower and upper bounds on termination probabilities.\nPOTL  is a linear-time temporal logic that captures the first-order fragment  of OPLs , introduced for model checking procedural programs with exceptions .\nIts model checking is EXPTIME-complete , and\nit is strictly more expressive  than the logics based on nested words CaRet [ref]3 and NWTL . Our contribution.\nWe introduce (a) a class of pPDA whose traces are OPLs, to model recursive probabilistic programs with observe statements;\n(b) the class of separated ω𝜔\\omegaOPBA;\n(c) a singly exponential model checking algorithm for a fragment of POTL that can be encoded with separated ω𝜔\\omegaOPBA;\n(d) an implementation that leverages two approaches to compute termination probabilities (SMT-based/numerical);\n(e) an experimental evaluation on several case studies. Organization.\nWe give an overview of OPLs and POTL in Section 2,\nintroduce pOPA in Section 3,\nand describe our model checking algorithm in Section 4.\nWe present the experimental evaluation in Section 5,\nand conclude the paper in Section 6.\nMissing proofs and other technicalities are reported in the appendix.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: in a nested and possibly even recursive fashion     .\nRecently, the expressive power of nested queries turned out to be\nappealing to model meta-reasoning and planning in multi-agent systems   [ref]43.\nVerifying formal properties on such programs is a very challenging task\nand, despite significant theoretical contributions    [ref]47,\nthere are not yet model checking approaches and tools\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
