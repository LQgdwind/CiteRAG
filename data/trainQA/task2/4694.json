As shown in Table V,\nour butterfly accelerator achieves 25.6×25.6\\times speedup over the FPGA-based FTRANS [ref]19 while using nearly 10×10\\times fewer DSPs.\nAt the same time,\nwe achieve 62.3×62.3\\times higher energy efficiency than FTRANS.\nCompared with ASIC designs,\nour accelerator achieves 14.2∼23.2×14.2\\sim 23.2\\times speedup under the same computational capacity.\nAlthough our FPGA-based butterfly design consumes more power than ASIC designs,\nit yields 1.1∼4.3×1.1\\sim 4.3\\times higher energy efficiency than the other SOTA ASIC accelerators.\nWe expect further speedup and energy efficiency improvements when our design is implemented as an ASIC. We attribute the performance gain of our approach over ASIC designs to two main factors:\n1) the use of FFT and butterfly factorization which significantly reduces the computational complexity at the algorithmic level; 2) the adaptable butterfly design that adopts a single unified hardware engine to accelerate both FFT and butterfly linear transformation, which significantly improves the hardware efficiency; and 3) the co-design process which jointly optimizes both algorithm and hardware parameters.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: Table V compares our butterfly accelerator with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) accelerators in terms of speed and power consumption.\nInstead of comparing the effective throughput  [ref]15,\nwe use the end-to-end latency to represent the actual execution speed of the hardware.\nThe energy efficiency is represented by the number of predictions per Joule (Pred./J).\nFollowing the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
