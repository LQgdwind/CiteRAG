      "content": "Paper Title: LEIA: Linguistic Embeddings for the Identification of Affect\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAutomatic identification of emotion in text is a valuable tool to study affect through social media and other text digital traces .\nWord-based methods enabled the study of mood expressions on Twitter  in relation to daylight oscillations  and of collective emotions in social resilience\n[ref]4.\nRule-based methods allowed the quantification of emotion contagion on Twitter  and the dynamics of emotions after affect labeling on social media .\nMore advanced classification methods trained on labeled data in various languages have been used to test the effect of air pollution on happiness in Weibo posts , to study the expression of emotions on Twitter about Black Lives Matter , and to validate social media emotion macroscopes against survey data [ref]9 0.\nBeyond research, emotion detection from social media text has clinical potential to identify users at mental health risk 1 and can help platforms to detect abusive language 2. Despite its potential, the use of emotion detection from social media text faces important challenges. Dictionary methods applied to social media text provide user-level metrics that are weakly correlated with answers to affective questionnaires 3. Furthermore, dictionary-based emotion analysis methods have weak correlations with population-level emotion prevalence 4, but the same study shows that more advanced supervised methods bear promise to capture well-being. One of the sources of problems with the application of social media text to study emotions is the sensitivity of methods to particular domains. For example, 5 applied out-of-the-box sentiment analysis in a benchmark of different domains and found how methods are very sensitive to the medium and text source. This is part of a general problem in which language model performance degrades with distribution shifts 6, weakening the validity of emotion detection from text in out-of-domain (OOD) settings. A source of error in emotion detection in social media is the way in which training labels are produced. While the target of applications is often to infer a subjective emotional state of the author of a social media post, the labels of training data are frequently produced by readers and not the authors of the post. The use of crowdsourcing can contribute to this problem, which can be alleviated by gathering several annotations per text but always carrying the potential noise source of readers not understanding the emotional state of writers. For example, a comparison between reader and writer annotations shows that they disagree 25% of the time 7. To avoid this problem, experience sampling can be used to generate self-annotated emotion labels. For example, 8 gathered anxiety scores at the time when individuals posted tweets and compared self-reported anxiety with emotion text analysis. The results are correlations of at most 0.24, calling for studies that can leverage large datasets to identify emotional states more accurately. New platforms to share emotional experiences with other users offer the possibility to gather large-scale datasets with emotion self-annotations. Vent is an example that offers a particularly good source of self-annotated data, as the dataset available for researchers has millions of posts 9 and the design of the platform is precisely to share emotions rather than a smaller functionality as in other platforms. Recent research on Vent has shown the difficulty to predict Vent precise mood labels from text 0, but it is still left to explore how Vent can be used to infer more coarse emotion labels that can match discrete emotion classes from psychological research. In this work, we focus on a subset of Vent tags that can be mapped to standard emotional states, with the goal of training a better and more robust emotion detection model that can be applied to other text sources, especially from other social media. In the following, we present the design and development of LEIA, followed by an empirical analysis in a benchmark of in-domain and out-of-domain tests. We further analyze examples of classification errors and outputs of LEIA to understand its limitations and paths for improvement.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: media and other text digital traces .\nWord-based methods enabled the study of mood expressions on Twitter  in relation to daylight oscillations  and of collective emotions in social resilience\n[ref]4.\nRule-based methods allowed the quantification of emotion contagion on Twitter  and the dynamics of emotions after affect labeling on social media .\nMore advanced classification methods\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
