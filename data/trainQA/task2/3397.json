Some of the literature provides partial evidence for the validity of our indicators by relating BTC prices to a proxy for one of the monetary functions. For instance, Biais et al. (2018)  provide an overlapping generation equilibrium model and emphasize BTC’s role as a medium of exchange. By using a dynamic asset pricing model, Cong, Li, and Wang (2021)  derive the value of platform tokens by aggregating heterogeneous users’ demand for cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange. Alabi (2017, 2020)   and Wheatley et al. (2019) [ref]68 use Metcalfe’s law  to measure the fundamental value of Bitcoin. Metcalfe’s law stipulates that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of its active users. While this law captures the value of a given token as a medium of exchange by measuring the number of its active users, it ignores the relatively inactive users who hold cryptocurrencies as a store of value. Athey et al. (2016)  document how trading volume, another proxy for the medium of exchange, affects the token price. Their results also provide evidence that BTC is mostly used as a store of value, which underscores the necessity of considering stores of value in BTC valuations. Additionally, current literature has found other predictors of BTC prices, such as attractiveness and popularity on social media,333In exploring the impact of social media on bitcoin price, Mai et al. (2018)  and Georgoula et al. (2015) 2 find that bullish forum sentiment is positively correlated with the price of bitcoin futures, while Polasik et al. (2015)  find in an empirical study of Bitcoin’s payment and investment functions that bitcoin price is mainly driven by its popularity on social media. Ciaian, Rajcaniova, and Kancs (2015)  find that the main drivers of the bitcoin price are the market forces of the bitcoin supply and demand and the attractiveness of Bitcoin for investors and users. Liu and Tsyvinski (2021)  show that high investor attention, as indicated by factors such as increased Google searches, predicts high future returns over 1- to 2-week horizons for BTC. Borri (2019)  finds that cryptocurrencies are highly correlated with each other, but poorly correlated with other global assets, including gold. Blau (2017)  identifies that speculative trading does not contribute to the unprecedented rise and subsequent crash in BTC prices. which are not directly related to the fundamentals considered in our research.444Fantazzini et al. (2016) 6, Fry and Cheah (2016) 8, Corbet, Lucey, and Yarovaya (2018) 3, Fry (2018) 7, and references therein used methods developed for stock markets to test bubbles in the cryptocurrency market. The fundamentals used are a function of historical prices, which differs from our monetary theory approach.\n\nReference markers found: [68]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]68: Cong, Li, and Wang (2021)  derive the value of platform tokens by aggregating heterogeneous users’ demand for cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange.
