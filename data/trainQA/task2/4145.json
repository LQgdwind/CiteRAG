      "content": "Paper Title: Stability and Generalization of Stochastic Optimization with Nonconvex and Nonsmooth Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStochastic optimization has become the workhorse behind many successful applications of machine learning (ML) 1 . The basic idea is to introduce randomness into the design of optimization algorithms to speed up the learning process by using the sum structure of objective functions in ML. A representative algorithm is the stochastic gradient descent (SGD). As an iterative algorithm, SGD first randomly selects a single example from a training dataset to build a stochastic gradient, and then moves along the negative direction of this stochastic gradient to get the next iterate. Due to its cheap computation cost and simplicity, SGD is especially interesting to solve large-scale and complex learning problems. In the last decade, SGD has been improved in various directions from the viewpoint of Nesterov acceleration 5, variance reduction     and adaptive learning rates   . Motivated by the increasing popularity, researchers have studied the theoretical behavior of stochastic optimization. Depending on the property of objective functions, one can measure the progress of optimization in terms of different performance metrics. For strongly convex problems, one can use the distance between the output model and the best model as the performance measure since there is only a unique minimizer  . For convex problems, one can develop convergence rates in terms of functional suboptimality gap since there may exist several models with the same global function value 1. For nonconvex and smooth problems, one can measure the performance through the magnitude of gradients since an algorithm is only guaranteed to find a local minimum . The performance metric becomes more tricky for nonconvex and nonsmooth problems [ref]11 . For an objective function ψ𝜓\\psi, neither the functional suboptimality gap ψ​(𝐰t)−infψ​(𝐰)𝜓subscript𝐰𝑡infimum𝜓𝐰\\psi(\\mathbf{w}_{t})-\\inf\\psi(\\mathbf{w}), nor the stationarity measure, dist​(0,∂ψ​(𝐰t))dist0𝜓subscript𝐰𝑡\\text{dist}(0,\\partial\\psi(\\mathbf{w}_{t})), necessarily decay to zero along the optimization process [ref]11. Here 𝐰tsubscript𝐰𝑡\\mathbf{w}_{t} denotes an iterate of the algorithm, ∂ψ​(𝐰t)𝜓subscript𝐰𝑡\\partial\\psi(\\mathbf{w}_{t}) denotes the subdifferential and dist denotes the Euclidean distance function. Recently, Davis and Drusvyatskiy [ref]11 proposed to use the Moreau envelope ψλ​(𝐰)=inf𝐯{ψ​(𝐯)+12​λ‖𝐯−𝐰∥22}subscript𝜓𝜆𝐰subscriptinfimum𝐯conditional-set𝜓𝐯12𝜆𝐯evaluated-at𝐰22\\psi_{\\lambda}(\\mathbf{w})=\\inf_{\\mathbf{v}}\\big{\\{}\\psi(\\mathbf{v})+\\frac{1}{2\\lambda}\\|\\mathbf{v}-\\mathbf{w}\\|_{2}^{2}\\big{\\}} as a useful potential function to study stochastic optimization for weakly convex problems 111A function is weakly convex if eigenvalues of Hessian matrices are lower bounded by a negative value.. An intuitive understanding is that a small gradient ‖∇ψλ​(𝐰t)‖2subscriptnorm∇subscript𝜓𝜆subscript𝐰𝑡2\\|\\nabla\\psi_{\\lambda}(\\mathbf{w}_{t})\\|_{2} implies that 𝐰tsubscript𝐰𝑡\\mathbf{w}_{t} is near some point that is nearly stationary for the problem min𝐰⁡ψ​(𝐰)subscript𝐰𝜓𝐰\\min_{\\mathbf{w}}\\psi(\\mathbf{w}), which motivates the use of the performance measure ‖∇ψλ​(𝐰t)‖2subscriptnorm∇subscript𝜓𝜆subscript𝐰𝑡2\\|\\nabla\\psi_{\\lambda}(\\mathbf{w}_{t})\\|_{2} for weakly convex problems. Weakly convex problems form an importance class of nonconvex and nonsmooth problems, with instantiations in various application domains such as phase retrieval, robust principal component analysis, covariance matrix estimation and sparse dictionary learning [ref]11. Most of existing studies focus on the convergence behavior of stochastic optimization algorithms from the perspective of optimization, i.e., how the trained model would behave on training examples. However, in ML we are more interested in the prediction behavior from the perspective of learning 2, i.e., how these models would behave on testing examples, which is much less studied for stochastic optimization. The gap between training and testing is a central topic in statistical learning theory (SLT). There are two major approaches to study the generalization gap: a uniform convergence approach based on the complexity analysis of hypothesis spaces  and an algorithmic stability approach based on the sensitivity analysis of algorithms  (for simplicity we always mean algorithmic stability when mentioning stability). Uniform convergence analysis applies to nonconvex problems, which, however, often leads to a square-root dependency on the dimensionality and therefore unfavorable for high-dimensional learning problems . Stability analysis can yield dimension-free bounds, which, however, often requires strong assumptions on loss functions such as convexity or smoothness. For example, most of the algorithmic stability analysis of stochastic optimization requires a convexity and a smoothness assumption 3 9. The smoothness assumption is removed in the recent study  [ref]3. In particular, the paper [ref]3 develops matching lower bounds for convex and nonsmooth problems. For nonconvex problems, one typically requires a Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) condition to get nontrivial error bounds of SGD . In the general nonconvex case, the stability analysis of SGD requires very small step sizes to get meaningful stability bounds 3 9, for which one cannot get meaningful optimization error bounds within reasonable computations. The strong assumption restricts the application domain of stability analysis for nonconvex and nonsmooth problems, which are often encountered in practice. To our knowledge, there is no stability analysis of stochastic optimization for problems that are simultaneously nonconvex and nonsmooth without restrictive assumptions such as the PL condition. In this paper, we initialize the stability and generalization analysis of stochastic optimization for weakly convex problems, where the objective functions are nonconvex and nonsmooth. As a warm up, we first consider convex and nonsmooth problems, then nonconvex and smooth problems, and finally move onto weakly convex problems. As indicated before, we require to use different metrics to measure the generalization performance, which also asks for different stability measures as well as a different connection between stability and generalization. Our contributions are as follows. Comparisons between our results and existing results are given in Table 1 and Table 2. We introduce a stability measure called uniform stability in gradients, and establish its quantitative relationship to the generalization measured by gradients for smooth problems. In particular, we show that the gap between population and empirical gradients can be bounded by our stability measure plus O​(1/n)𝑂1𝑛O(1/\\sqrt{n}), where n𝑛n is the sample size. We consider a specific class of nonconvex and nonsmooth problems called weakly convex problems, for which we measure the performance of trained models by Moreau envelopes. We develop, to our best knowledge, the first connection between argument stability and the generalization gap measured by Moreau envelopes. We introduce the concept of sampling-determined algorithms, for which we establish stability bounds in terms of either function values, gradients or arguments. We apply our results to SGD and its adaptive variant. For nonconvex and smooth problems, we develop stability-based risk bounds without the PL condition. We also develop the first risk bounds in terms of Moreau envelops for weakly convex problems.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: the performance through the magnitude of gradients since an algorithm is only guaranteed to find a local minimum .
