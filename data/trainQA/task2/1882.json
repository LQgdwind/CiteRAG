      "content": "Paper Title: BERT2Code: Can Pretrained Language Models be Leveraged for Code Search?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur simple, and lightweight neural network based code search method largely depends on the embedding models’ capability to capture the semantic meanings of source codes and NL queries. We evaluate the code and the sentence embeddings by manually rating queries and source codes based on semantic similarity and then comparing these manual scores with the distances in embedding spaces. We perform this analysis on the DeepCom dataset [ref]20 to free ourselves from any bias from previous experiments. We generate embeddings with SBERT  and with Code2Vec [ref]2 (as it performed better than CodeBERT ) models for the 505,188 code-NL datapoints from DeepCom. We sample 150 pairs of datapoints that have low Euclidean distance code embedding space and another 150 pairs of datapoints that have low Euclidean distance in the NL embedding space. We then give a similarity score for the two source codes and another similarity score for the NL queries for each of the 300 pairs. The scores are integers ranging between 0 to 10. The scoring is done twice independently by two authors based on the their manual observation. Their ratings for the source codes and the NL queries have 0.8422 and 0.8760 Pearson’s correlation  respectively. The scores from the two authors are averaged to get our manual semantic similarity score. From Table 2, the code vectors have a lower correlation coefficient with the manual scores than NL vectors. We calculate the p-values for the similarity scores with the null hypotheses that the manual similarity scores do not correlate with the NL and the code embedding similarities. Both the p-values are less than 10−6superscript10610^{-6} which reject the null hypotheses and show that the correlations are statistically significant. This finding supports our assumption that embeddings can be used for learning complex relations between source codes and NL queries. However, the significantly low correlation for the code embeddings similarity indicates that better code embedding methods than Code2Vec [ref]2 and CodeBERT  are necessary to exploit the capability of our method fully.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: manually rating queries and source codes based on semantic similarity and then comparing these manual scores with the distances in embedding spaces.
