      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Recurrent Federated Learning for Edge Popularity Prediction in Privacy-Preserving Mobile Edge Computing Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe emerging industrial Internet of things (IIoT), also colloquially known as Industry 4.0, interconnects isolated industrial assets by leveraging the growing ubiquity of wireless communication technologies. By harvesting the rich supply of data from various networked embedded sensors, this new paradigm promises the opportunity to revolutionize production and manufacturing  . However, to process such an enormous amount of data and to handle the massive requests generated by ubiquitous wireless devices especially under the stringent requirements of reliability, latency, security and privacy, are incredibly challenging. Mobile edge computing (MEC), which co-locates storage and processing resources at the network edge, represents an effective framework to provision IIoT services  and to mitigate the surging traffic burden of the data centers  . Dense deployment of edge nodes (ENs), i.e., radio access points or micro base stations, allows proximal and immediate access to the IIoT services. In an information-centric networking, proactive edge caching (EC) is considered a cost-effective approach to address the backhaul bottleneck problem  and to reduce the content retrieval/handover latency . The explorations of optimal EC policies in MEC-enabled IIoT networks have been investigated in many previous studies  [ref]10  [ref]12  . However, many of relevant works, i.e.,  [ref]10 , assume that the content popularity can be a priori given and remains constant during the services, which is actually inconsistent with the reality. To be more realistic, some works [ref]12   have considered the unknown popularity and explored the end-to-end learning approach to learn the EC policy directly from the request data so as to avoid the popularity prediction. Although circumventing popularity prediction by introducing the end-to end machine learning is indeed a research direction of the EC policy optimization, the popularity reflects the inherent pattern of user interests and directly determines the generation of content requests and thus, plays the most direct and decisive role in the EC policy. Significant improvements of EC performance provided by the popularity prediction have been demonstrated in literatures  [ref]16 . Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the investigation of popularity prediction. Generally, content popularity depends on the user interest, which is complicated and spatiotemporal varying and, thus, is unavailable in advance no matter which caching policy is applied . When considering the spatiotemporal varying characteristic of content popularities in the real world, the performance of EC policies is largely determined by the selection mechanism of popular data that is worthwhile caching from a massive deluge of data traffic, which in turn relies on the accuracy of popularity prediction  [ref]16 . The potential of the popularity prediction has attracted the attentions of researchers and many progresses have been achieved in relevant works, e.g., 0–3. However, there are still open challenges for the popularity prediction. 1) Spatiotemporal variability: Due to the complex and changeable subjective attributes of end users/devices such as the subjective interests of human and the intrinsic task characteristics of devices, the content popularity is spatiotemporal varying and pose tough challenges to its prediction accuracy. 2) Privacy preservation: In many scenarios such as the healthcare and automotive-related industries, the terminal data is private and needs to be protected from external access. Thus, privacy requirements prevent the data sharing among devices and center servers, which leads to the data deficiency for the data-driven centralized popularity prediction methods. 3) Costly manual labeling: Caused by the unobservability of popularity in the realistic environment, labelling popularities in manual for the popularity prediction is costly and challenging, which brings a technical bottleneck to many prediction approaches based on supervised learning. 4) Not independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) behaviors: Due to the subjectivity of user interests, user behaviors are non-i.i.d., which can violate the assumption in machine learning that datas are independent and identically distributed and sequentially causes many issues, i.e., feature distribution skew, concept drift, quantity skew, etc., for learning-based prediction methods. In the light of the above observations, the objective of this study is to design a distributed deep learning algorithm to predict the dynamic content popularities in a MEC-enabled IIoT system while preserving the data privacy of end devices and circumventing the costly manual labeling. To explore the insightful relations between the local and global popularities is another important consideration in this paper. To this end, the mathematical derivation and simulation validation of the relations among the popularities in system are provided, and a novel unsupervised recurrent federated learning (URFL) algorithm with a novel federated loss-weighted averaging (FedLWA) parameter aggregation scheme are also proposed. The main technical contributions of this work are summarized as follows. We respectively introduce the time-varying local and global popularities in the local user and MEC server sides to make the MEC system more closely aligned with reality. Furthermore, we derive and validate the mathematical relationship between the local and global popularities, and reveal the fundamental difficulty in inferring the global popularity under the privacy-preserving constraint. We design the learning node architecture in the FL framework by embedding the AE module, which realizes unsupervised learning without costly manual labeling. To effectively extract the underlying temporal information in the historical requests, long short-term memory (LSTM) cells are adopted in the AE module. We propose a novel URFL algorithm on the basis of the FL architecture to perform offline training and online realtime prediction of the distributed popularities. The proposed URFL algorithm breaks the consistency requirement on model inputs between local and global sides in the typical FL framework and realizes the distributed training and prediction without any external access to the historical requests of local users except themselves, so as to better preserve user privacy. On the basis of the proposed URFL algorithm, we further design a FedLWA scheme for the parameter aggregation to alleviate the problem of non-i.i.d. user behaviors considered in the investigated scenario and, thereby, further reduce the prediction error of popularities. The rest of this paper is organized as follow. Section II reviews the related works. The system model is established in Section III. Then, Section IV introduces the problem formulation and the proposed scheme. In Section V, simulation results and discussions are provided.
