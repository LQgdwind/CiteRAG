In a supervised learning setting, given data D=(xi,yi)i=1N𝐷subscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖𝑁𝑖1D={(x_{i},y_{i})}^{N}_{i=1}, we aim to learn a function through the neural network y=fN​N​(x)𝑦subscript𝑓𝑁𝑁𝑥y=f_{NN}(x) that maps the inputs x𝑥x to y𝑦y. A point estimation of the model parameter set W∗superscript𝑊∗W^{{\\ast}} is obtained through a gradient based optimisation technique and with a respective cost function. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) [ref]30, alternatively, consider the probability of the distribution over the parameter set W𝑊W and introduce a prior over the neural network parameter set P​(W)𝑃𝑊P(W). The posterior probability distribution P​(W∣D)𝑃conditional𝑊𝐷P(W\\mid D) is learnt in a data-driven fashion through Bayesian inference. This grants us a distribution over the parameter set W𝑊W other than a static point estimation, which allows us to model uncertainty in the neural network prediction. In the prediction phase, we sample model parameters from the posterior distribution i.e. w∼P​(W∣D)similar-to𝑤𝑃conditional𝑊𝐷w\\sim P(W\\mid D) and predict results with fN​Nw​(x)superscriptsubscript𝑓𝑁𝑁𝑤𝑥f_{NN}^{w}(x) for the corresponding y𝑦y. We marginalise the w𝑤w samples and obtain an expected prediction. Due to the complexity and non-linearity of neural networks, an exact inference for BNNs is rarely possible, hence various approximation inference methods have been developed . The most widely adopted approximation method is the Monte Carlo Dropout , with applications in natural language processing, data analytics and computer vision [ref]22[ref]40. In this paper, we adopt the same idea and use Monte Carlo Dropout  to approximate the neural network as a BNN.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: point estimation of the model parameter set W∗superscript𝑊∗W^{{\\ast}} is obtained through a gradient based optimisation technique and with a respective cost function.
