      "content": "Paper Title: Diagnosing and Remedying Shot Sensitivity with Cosine Few-Shot Learners\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nModern ConvNets have achieved impressive performance 2   but rely on millions of labelled images   .\nIn many contexts this high level of data availability cannot be assumed.\nRare or fine-grained categories may require prohibitively expensive expert gatherers or annotators, respectively.\nHigh-stakes, open-world settings like robotics compound the issue: models will likely need to learn and adapt rapidly in deployment, without waiting for offline data collection or annotation. These issues have spawned interest in neural models that rapidly adapt to novel concepts using few labelled examples, or few-shot learning.\nIn the most highly-studied incarnation of this problem (few-shot image classification),\na classifier is pre-trained on a set of training classes, and then must adapt to a distinct set of unseen test classes, with only a few (typically 1 or 5) labelled images representing each novel class.\nMost approaches to few-shot training involve repeated simulations (episodes) of this test-time task: batches include 1 or 5 labelled images, which the network uses to make predictions.\nOptimizing over repeated trials, networks learn to generalize across classes, eventually including novel ones.\nThe episodic training scheme has proven overwhelmingly popular  [ref]26   4. Inherent to the episodic training scheme is the assumption that the number of images per class, or shot, is known in advance.\nModels for 5-shot problems are trained on 5-shot episodes; models for 1-shot problems use 1-shot episodes.\nClearly this is not realistic, as the practitioner cannot control or know in advance how available as yet unseen data will be in deployment.\nPrior work shows that this assumption does impact performance.\nPrototypical networks [ref]26 (ProtoNet), a simple, foundational, and enduringly popular approach to few-shot classification, overfit severely to training shot and suffer when test shot does not match .\nThis is because models trained with different shot numbers require different degrees of clustering to be effective.\nModels trained on low-shot episodes must learn tight class clusters, otherwise different training samples will shift decision boundaries greatly (Fig. 1, top).\nHigh shot models aggregate class statistics over many images, regressing nicely to the mean, and so learn diffuse clusters that are information-rich but susceptible to sample noise when shot is low . We propose a simple yet greatly overlooked solution to the problem of shot-sensitivity: simply replace Euclidean distance logits with the cosine distance.\nThe existence of cosine alternatives to Euclidean-based few-shot learners has long been known - the original ProtoNet paper even contains a discussion of this topic [ref]26 .\nHowever, when cosine and Euclidean alternatives are compared, they are always evaluated in the episodic setting without shot mismatch, and reported differences are generally small [ref]26 5.\nWe find that when train and test shot differ, these differences become dramatic: cosine models are much more robust to shot variation at test time.\nThis is because the cosine distance provides ample robustness to sample noise, by anchoring all decisions boundaries through the origin.\nThis makes decision boundaries more stable (Fig. 1, bottom), and by training in this stabilized regime, cosine models become effectively agnostic to shot. Motivated by this finding, we implement cosine alternatives to two popular few-shot classifiers (ProtoNet [ref]26 and FEAT 5), and derive a novel alternative for a recent state of the art (FRN 4).\nWe then conduct a systematic comparison across benchmarks and network backbones.\nWe find that: Similar to , overfitting to training shot is a consistent problem for metric few-shot learning. Contrary to , larger feature extractor backbones offer some degree of built-in shot robustness. Our cosine alternatives provide consistent and superior test time shot sensitivity reduction… …without sacrificing model accuracy in expectation, and in fact frequently yield substantial (up to double-digit) accuracy gains in the very-low-shot regime. These results suggest that the shot-overfitting problem, while ubiquitous to few-shot learning, also has a simple, elegant, and widely applicable solution.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: to make predictions.\nOptimizing over repeated trials, networks learn to generalize across classes, eventually including novel ones.\nThe episodic training scheme has proven overwhelmingly popular  [ref]26   4. Inherent to the episodic training scheme is the assumption that the number of images per class, or shot, is known in advance.\nModels for 5-shot problems are trained on 5-shot episodes;\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
