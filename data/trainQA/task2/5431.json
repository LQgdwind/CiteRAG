Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Mathematical Capabilities of ChatGPT\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGPT-4, launched on 1st March 2023, is the latest model of the GPT lineage , being the successor of various versions of ChatGPT, the first of which was launched on 30 November 2022 [ref]10.\nThese are all based on InstructGPT, which in turn is based on a trained GPT-3 [ref]25, and fine-tuned using reinforcement learning with human feedback . We note that already for models that predate (Chat)GPT, such as InstructGPT, where research articles and model cards  have been released, full reproducibility is not possible since the code and exact datasets have not been released. Furthermore, it was confirmed by OpenAI employees that for some of their models, launched prior to 30 November, a slight mismatch exists between the trained model that is accessible via the OpenAI web interface and the model referred to in the official paper . This indicates how essential it is to document carefully which model our analysis pertains to and how we have accessed it. In our dataset, we have accordingly included time stamps for each prompt in order to be able to track, based on information provided by OpenAI, any changes in (Chat)GPT’s version that have occurred. We have exclusively used the GUI web interface to carry out the evaluation. This was necessary for consistency reasons, since at the beginning of our evaluation, API access was not yet widely available. At the time of writing, API access to GPT-4 is still limited, and a waitlist is employed, which made the use of the GUI web interface a necessity for GPT-4 ). We note that there exist no official documents that link the GUI web interface to the different model versions and possible model settings from the API. The 9-January-2023 and 30-January-2023 ChatGPT versions we evaluated are likely to be earlier instances of the newer model gpt-3.5-turbo-0301. This model itself is a “snapshot of gpt-3.5-turbo from March 1st, 2023” that will not receive further updates . For GPT-4, at the time of writing, there exist four models gpt-4, gpt-4-0314, gpt-4-32k, gpt-4-32k-0314 that can be used for the chat completion API endpoint [ref]52. Additionally, for all models, there exist various settings when using the chat completion API endpoint, such as temperature or presence_penalty that influence the models’ output, which cannot be controlled via the GUI web interface. It is also not known which values of these settings are used for the GUI web version. The only version identifier in the GUI web version is a generic “model version” link at the bottom of the page that links to the release notes [ref]10. The 9-January-2023 and 30-January-2023 model versions that we evaluated are the ones presented in the release notes [ref]10 at the respective time.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: GPT-4, launched on 1st March 2023, is the latest model of the GPT lineage , being the successor of various versions of ChatGPT, the first of which was launched on 30 November 2022 [ref]10.\nThese are all based on InstructGPT, which in turn is based on a trained GPT-3 [ref]25, and fine-tuned using reinforcement learning with human feedback .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
