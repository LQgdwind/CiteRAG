      "content": "Paper Title: LitCQD: Multi-Hop Reasoning in Incomplete Knowledge Graphs with Numeric Literals\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the last decade, a plethora of knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models have been successfully applied to tackle various tasks, including link prediction, relation prediction, community detection, fact checking, and class expression learning    [ref]16.\nKGE research has mainly focused on learning embeddings for entities and relations tailored towards predicting missing entity/relation given a triple, i.e., tackling single-hop queries       [ref]33  .\nDespite their effectiveness in tackling single-hop queries, KGE models cannot be directly applied to answer multi-hop queries.\nThis is due to the fact that multi-hop query answering over KGs is a strict generalization of knowledge graph completion (i.e., single-hop query answering) .\nMoreover, most KGE do not incorporate literals (e.g. numeric attributes) in KGs.\nConsequently, embeddings for entities and relations are learned without incorporating knowledge encoded with literals (e.g., age of a person, height of a person or date of birth).\nTo alleviate this limitation, there has been a growing interest in designing KGE model incorporating literals in recent years.\nFor instance, Wu et al.  propose TransEA by extending the translation loss used in TransE  by adding the attribute loss as a weighted regularization term.\nGarcia-Duran and Niepert [ref]12 propose KBLRN that is based on relation features, numerical literals, and a KGE model.\nA predicted score of a triple is composed of relation feature values, predicted scores via a KGE model, and a numerical literal feature.\nA relation feature is a logical 2-hop formula (e.g. ∃x:𝑏𝑜𝑟𝑛𝐼𝑛​(a,x)∧𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑂𝑓​(x,b):𝑥𝑏𝑜𝑟𝑛𝐼𝑛𝑎𝑥𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑂𝑓𝑥𝑏\\exists x:\\mathit{bornIn}(a,x)\\land\\mathit{capitalOf}(x,b)) generated by AMIE+  that acts as a binary classifier and assigns 1 if there is a path from an entity a𝑎a to b𝑏b, otherwise 0.\nA literal feature is constructed by taking the difference between a numeric value of subject and object entities for a given relation.\nGarcía-Durán and Niepert [ref]12 show that the mean differences of birth years is 0.4 on Freebase between entities occurring with /people/marriage/spouse, whereas it is 32.4 for the relation /person/children.\nKristiadi et al.  propose LiteralE that applies a non-linear parameterized function to merge entity embeddings with numerical literals.\nBy this, LiteralE is computationally less demanding than KBLRN as it does not require any rule generation and is more expressive than TransE as TransE integrates the impact of literals linearly.\nLearning a parameterized function to enrich entity embeddings with their numerical literal information available in KGs improves the link prediction performance across benchmark datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: embedding (KGE) models have been successfully applied to tackle various tasks, including link prediction, relation prediction, community detection, fact checking, and class expression learning    [ref]16.\nKGE research has mainly focused on learning embeddings for entities and relations tailored towards predicting missing entity/relation given a triple, i.e., tackling single-hop queries\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
