      "content": "Paper Title: Hybrid Search for Efficient Planning with Completeness Guarantees\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCombining planning with deep learning has led to significant advances in many fields, such as automated theorem proving , classical board games , puzzles , Atari games , video compression [ref]24, robotics , and autonomous driving . However, deep learning-based methods often plan in terms of low-level actions, such as individual moves in chess or commands in Atari games, whereas humans tend to plan by decomposing problems into smaller subproblems 1. This observation has inspired a lot of recent research into methods that solve complex tasks by performing hierarchical planning and search. In the continuous setting, hierarchical planning has been applied to, for instance, robotic manipulation and navigation   2  5. Discrete hierarchical planning methods, when trained entirely on offline data, can solve complex problems with high combinatorial complexity. These methods are efficient at long-term planning thanks to the hierarchy reducing the effective planning horizon  8 5. Furthermore, they reduce the impact of noise on planning  and show promising generalization ability to out-of-distribution tasks 5. Training RL agents on diverse multi-task offline data has been shown to scale and generalize broadly to new tasks, and being compatible with training without any environment interaction can be seen as an additional strength of these methods   2. Despite their excellent performance, the discrete subgoal search methods share a weakness: neither AdaSubS 5, kSubS , nor HIPS 8 are guaranteed to find a solution even if it exists. All these methods rely on a learned subgoal generator that proposes new subgoals to be used with some classical search algorithms for planning. If the generator fails to perform adequately, the result can be a failure to discover solutions to solvable problems. We call this property the lack of completeness. The guarantee of the algorithm finding a solution is critical for both theoretical science and practical algorithms. In the context of subgoal search, completeness guarantees discovering the solution, even if the generative model is imperfect. Completeness allows extensions and new incremental algorithms that require building on top of exact solutions. One example of that could be curriculum learning. Furthermore, we show that completeness significantly improves the out-of-distribution generalization of subgoal search. Achieving completeness also makes applying high-level search as an alternative to low-level search possible in safety-critical real-world systems. Zawalski et¬†al. 5 mentioned that AdaSubS can be made complete by adding an exhaustive one-step subgoal generator that is only utilized when the search would otherwise fail, whereas Kujanp√§√§ et¬†al. 8 proposed combining high- and low-level actions to attain completeness of HIPS. However, to the best of our knowledge, this idea has not been formalized, analyzed, or evaluated in prior work. (a) low-level search (b) high-level search (c) high-level search (d) complete search We present a multi-level (hybrid) search method, complete subgoal search, that combines hierarchical planning and classical exhaustive low-level search. The idea is illustrated in Figure¬†1. We apply our complete search approach to HIPS 8 which 1)¬†has been shown to outperform several other subgoal search algorithms in challenging discrete problem domains, 2)¬†does not require training multiple subgoal generators in parallel to perform adaptive-length planning, and 3)¬†is particularly suited for being combined with low-level actions due to using Policy-guided Heuristic Search (PHS) as the main search algorithm 8 . We use the name HIPS-ŒµùúÄ\\varepsilon for the proposed enhancement of HIPS with complete subgoal search. We argue that the idea suggested in 5 can be seen as a specific case of our search method that works well in some environments but can be improved upon in others. We evaluate HIPS-ŒµùúÄ\\varepsilon on challenging, long-term discrete reasoning problems and show that it outperforms HIPS, other subgoal search methods, and strong offline reinforcement learning (RL) baselines. Not only does HIPS-ŒµùúÄ\\varepsilon attain completeness, but our complete subgoal search also demonstrates improved performance on problem instances that subgoal search alone was sufficient for solving.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: Combining planning with deep learning has led to significant advances in many fields, such as automated theorem proving , classical board games , puzzles , Atari games , video compression [ref]24, robotics , and autonomous driving .
