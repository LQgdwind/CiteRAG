      "content": "Paper Title: Improving Unsupervised Image Clustering With Robust Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUnsupervised clustering is a core task in computer vision that aims to identify each image‚Äôs class membership without using any labels. Here, a class represents the group membership of images that share similar visual characteristics. Many studies have proposed deep learning-based algorithms that utilize distance in a feature space as the similarity metric to assign data points into classes¬†[ref]11 [ref]44. Training without ground-truth guidance, however, is prone to finding trivial solutions that are learned from low-level visual traits like colors and textures¬†[ref]22. Several studies have introduced innovative ways to guide the model‚Äôs training indirectly by setting alternative objectives. For example, Hu¬†et al.¬† proposed to maximize the mutual information between input and its hidden representations, and Ji¬†et al.¬†[ref]22 proposed to learn invariant features against data augmentation. Entropy-based balancing has often been adopted to prevent degenerate solutions¬† [ref]22 . Nevertheless, these alternative objectives are bound to producing overconfident results, i.e., low-entropy predictions, due to the dense grouping among clusters. When uncertain samples are added to a wrong cluster at an early stage of training, the model gradually becomes overconfident in its later predictions as the noise from misclassification accumulates and degrades the overall performance. This paper introduces a novel robust learning training method, RUC (Robust learning for Unsupervised Clustering), that runs in conjunction with existing clustering models to alleviate the noise discussed above. Utilizing and treating the existing clustering model‚Äôs results as a noisy dataset that may include wrong labels, RUC updates the model‚Äôs misaligned knowledge. Bringing insights from the literature, we filter out unclean samples and apply loss correction as in Fig.¬†1. This process is assisted by label smoothing and co-training to reduce any wrong gradient signals from unclean labels. This retraining process with revised pseudo-labels further regularizes the model and prevents overconfident results. RUC comprises two key components: (1) extracting clean samples and (2) retraining with the refined dataset. We propose confidence-based, metric-based, and hybrid strategies to filter out misclassified pseudo-labels. The first strategy considers samples of high prediction confidence from the original clustering model as a clean set; it filters out low confidence samples. This strategy relies on the model‚Äôs calibration performance. The second strategy utilizes similarity metrics from unsupervised embedding models to detect clean samples with non-parametric classifiers by checking whether the given instance shares the same labels with top kùëòk-nearest samples. The third strategy combines the above two and selects samples that are credible according to both strategies. The next step is to retrain the clustering model with the sampled dataset. We use MixMatch¬†, a semi-supervised learning technique; which uses clean samples as labeled data and unclean samples as unlabeled data. We then adopt label smoothing to leverage strong denoising effects on the label noise¬† and block learning from overconfident samples¬†[ref]22 . Finally, a co-training architecture with two networks is used to mitigate noise accumulation from the unclean samples during training and increase performance. We evaluate RUC with rigorous experiments on datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-20, STL-10, and ImageNet-50. Combining RUC to an existing clustering model outperforms the state-of-the-art results with the accuracy of 90.3% in CIFAR-10, 54.3% in CIFAR-20, 86.7% in STL-10, and 78.5% in ImageNet-50 dataset. RUC also enhances the baseline model to be robust against adversarial noise. Our contributions are as follows: The proposed algorithm RUC aids existing unsupervised clustering models via retraining and avoiding overconfident predictions. The unique retraining process of RUC helps existing models boost performance. It achieves a 5.3pp increase for the STL-10 dataset when added to the state-of-the-art model (81.4% to 86.7%). The ablation study shows every component in RUC is critical, including the three proposed strategies (i.e., confidence-based, metric-based, and hybrid) that excel in extracting clean samples from noisy pseudo-labels. The proposed training process is robust against adversarial noise and can adjust the model confidence with better calibrations. Implementation details of the model and codes are available at https://github.com/deu30303/RUC.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: share similar visual characteristics.
