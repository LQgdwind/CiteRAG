      "content": "Paper Title: A Toolchain for Streaming Dataflow Accelerator Designs for Big Data Analytics\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile much research is focused on developing and accelerating algorithms for streaming data in both hardware  [ref]34 and software , many designs for low-level hardware still have to transfer streams over interfaces which are either custom or based on generic, bit- and/or byte-oriented specifications such as AXI4-Stream  and Avalon-ST . As a result, higher-level information about data structures and how streams of data are organized over transfers must be devised and implemented by designers, and are not reflected by the declaration of the interface in a traditional HDL. Some of this design effort can be alleviated through the use of high-level synthesis: tools such as Vivado HLS can be employed to leverage C, C++ or SystemC combined with IP-blocks using ap_fifo or AXI4-Stream to handle data streams , while synthesizing compilers such as Optimus  have been developed in the past to leverage StreamIt 2, a language specifically for streaming applications. At the same time, many researchers are working on improved hardware description languages and IRs, such as Chisel , FIRRTL  and LLHD 0. These are not suitable replacements for a higher-level interface specification, however: HLS tools either obfuscate the interfaces between low-level hardware and/or use proprietary IRs and tools to connect components, making reuse more difficult. While the HDLs and IRs mentioned are aimed at more general hardware designs, so still require custom interfaces for streaming data transfers. As such, the aim of this thesis is to develop a free, open-source IR for defining high-level streaming dataflow interfaces mapped onto hardware and for connecting these interfaces. This would complement existing HDLs and IRs which describe behavior, and enable components designed in higher-level front-end languages for HLS to propagate more type information to the resulting interfaces. Long-term, the Accelerated Big Data Systems group aims to develop a toolchain for streaming dataflow accelerator designs for big data analytics. The work done for this thesis is part of such a toolchain, providing a grammar and parser, query system for the IR, and a compiler to VHDL. At the same time, Yongding Tian has been working on a front-end language for his thesis and as another component of this toolchain, enabling designers to express behavior as well.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: While much research is focused on developing and accelerating algorithms for streaming data in both hardware  [ref]34 and software , many designs for low-level hardware still have to transfer streams over interfaces which are either custom or based on generic, bit- and/or byte-oriented specifications such as\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
