By applying this technique, dynamic power consumption can be reduced quadratically.\nVoltage underscaling is studied in a wide variety of computing systems and memory devices, such as CPUs   , GPUs 8 7  9, FPGAs  , DRAMs  4 , SRAMs   , HBMs 5, and NAND Flash memories        . In addition to power savings, voltage underscaling is used for software-based fault attacks, combined with frequency scaling   [ref]76  . In commercial devices, voltage underscaling can be performed safely to some extent without affecting the accuracy of systems. However, aggressive voltage underscaling without changing the operating frequency may cause timing faults due to the increasing circuit delay, called critical region . Further voltage underscaling below the minimum operating voltage systems stop operating    5.\n\nReference markers found: [76]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]76: FPGAs  , DRAMs  4 , SRAMs   , HBMs 5, and NAND Flash memories        .

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
