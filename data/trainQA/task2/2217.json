Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

We follow GestureGAN [ref]12 and adopt\nthe Creative Senz3D dataset  for the hand gesture-to-gesture translation task.\nThis dataset contains 11 different hand gestures performed by four people, each performing\ngesture is repeated 30 times, resulting in 4 subjects √ó\\times\n11 gestures √ó\\times 30 times = 1320 images in total.\nWe follow [ref]12 and select 12,800 and 135,504 pairs as testing and training data, respectively. Evaluation Metrics.\nWe follow [ref]12 and adopt Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio\n(PSNR) and FRD [ref]12 as evaluation metrics.\nPSNR measures the similarity between the real image and the generated image at a pixel level.\nFRD measures the distance between the real image and the fake image from a deep feature level.\nMoreover, we follow [ref]12 and conduct a user study to evaluate the generated image by different models. State-of-the-Art Comparisons.\nWe adopt the most related several works, i.e., PG2¬†[ref]10, DPIG¬†[ref]39, PoseGAN¬†, GestureGAN¬†[ref]12, SAMG¬†, Pix2pixSC , and CocosNet , as our baselines for the facial expression generation task.\nComparison results are shown in Table III.\nThe proposed method achieves very competitive results compared with the leading methods.\nSpecifically, the proposed C2GAN achieves significantly better results than PG2, SAMG, DPIG, Pix2pixSC, and CocosNet on all metrics.\nMoreover, PoseGAN obtains slightly better results than our C2GAN on both PSNR and FRD metrics, however, the proposed C2GAN achieves better AMT than PoseGAN.\nMoreover, the proposed C2GAN achieves visually better results than PoseGAN, as shown in Fig.¬†6.\nLastly, GestureGAN achieves better results than C2GAN on all metrics.\nThe reason is that GestureGAN is carefully tailored and designed for the specific hand gesture-to-gesture translation task, meaning that GestureGAN is fine-turned to this task with the network structure, loss objective, and hyper-parameter selection.\nHowever, the proposed C2GAN is a novel and unified GAN model, which can be used to handle all kinds of settings of guided image-to-image translation without modifying the network structure, the loss objective, and hyper-parameters.\nFurthermore, our C2GAN can generate both images and guidances, which is not considered in GestureGAN. Qualitative comparison results compared with PG2, DPIG, PoseGAN, GestureGAN, SAMG are shown in Fig.¬†6.\nThe proposed method generates much better images than PG2, DPIG, SAMG, and PoseGAN.\nMoreover, our results are very close to those generated by GestureGAN. Our C2GAN is a joint learning framework and it is not only able to generate the target images but is also able to produce the hand skeleton of the input image, which will benefit other computer vision tasks such as hand pose estimation.\nThe results of the generated hand skeletons are shown in Fig.¬†7.\nThe generated hand skeleton Lx‚Ä≤superscriptsubscriptùêøùë•‚Ä≤L_{x}^{{}^{\\prime}} is very similar to the real hand skeleton Lxsubscriptùêøùë•L_{x}, which verifies the effectiveness of the guidance generator¬†Ggsubscriptùê∫ùëîG_{g} and our joint learning strategy.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: Datasets.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
