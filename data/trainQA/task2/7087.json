      "content": "Paper Title: CiFlow: Dataflow Analysis and Optimization of Key Switching for Homomorphic Encryption\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHigh-Performance CPU Implementations:\nMany software libraries exist that support HE¬†   . Notably, Lattigo , OpenFHE , and HEAAN , support CKKS bootstrapping and FHE. However, due to limited computational power, some applications like deep neural network inference, remain impractical on pure CPU implementations. For instance, state-of-the-art ResNet models    can take upwards of one hour per inference, limiting their applicability to infrequent, low arrival rate applications  . Compilers and Dataflow: Recently, many works have focused on FHE compiler development, specifically in the context of private neural inference. Tools such as CHET  and EVA  automatically map and optimize common neural network layers for FHE and handle parameter selection and ciphertext management implicitly. Recently ùñÆùóãùóÇùóàùóáùñÆùóãùóÇùóàùóá\\mathsf{Orion}  makes use of double-hoisting  to further improve CPU latencies. Recent work in MAD  highlights how clever caching techniques and dataflow optimizations can still yield high performance bootstrapping implementations despite small on-chip memories (1 to 32 MB). While MAD¬† presents a dataflow similar to our DC dataflow,\nwe show our OC approach using 32 and 512MB of on-chip memory can further increase arithmetic intensity of key-switching by taking advantage of on-chip data reuse. GPU/FPGA Acceleration:\nGPUs offer promising opportunities for performance gain given their numerous parallel compute units and high off-chip bandwidth. Previous studies explore GPU acceleration of HE operations¬†   [ref]41  . Jung¬†[ref]41 was the first GPU implementation to support CKKS, suggesting optimizations like kernel fusing to reduce on-chip memory requirements. Still, the lack of native modular arithmetic support and limited on-chip memory yields subpar performance relative to modern ASIC solutions [ref]13 [ref]15  . An alternative approach is to employ the use of FPGAs¬†   . While FPGAs may not provide the same level of performance as ASIC solutions, their reprogrammability offers a significant advantage given that FHE algorithms continue to evolve at a rapid pace. Poseidon  was the first FPGA-based accelerator targeting FHE CKKS. Most recently, FAB  proposes several dataflow optimizations, alongside an FPGA implementation, geared towards increasing on-chip data reuse and minimizing unnecessary DRAM accesses.\n\nASIC Acceleration:\nCheetah¬† was the first to present a large-scale ASIC with custom logic and show that the overheads of HE could be overcome with hardware acceleration.\nùôµùü∑ùôµùü∑\\mathtt{F1}¬† presented a programmable ASIC accelerator for FHE, specifically tailored to small parameter sets with limited bootstrapping support, making it inefficient for deep neural network computations. Since then, many works [ref]13 [ref]15   proposed ASIC solutions targeting bootstrapping and FHE. CraterLake [ref]13 and BTS [ref]15 were the first ASIC accelerators supporting bootstrapping, but featured underutilized compute units despite allocating 1TB of off-chip bandwidth. Later, ARK  proposed a minimal key-switching strategy to address memory bottleneck, yet still required a large 512MB on-chip scratchpad. Recently, SHARP  characterized the effect of smaller moduli size on neural network accuracy, demonstrating the feasibility of using smaller 36-bit RNS moduli to reduce compute unit size, on-chip memory requirements, and off-chip bandwidth pressure.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: offer promising opportunities for performance gain given their numerous parallel compute units and high off-chip bandwidth.
