      "content": "Paper Title: Rethink Diversity in Deep Learning Testing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe use three recent diversity-based testing works as benchmarks: Boosting Diversity:¬†[ref]16 is our major benchmark. It is built upon the assumption that if the divergence between two executions is significant, then the inputs might be classified differently. More specifically, for the pair of executions, one extracts neuron activations from any hidden layer in the DNN, and then compute the distributional difference of them between the original input and the transformed input. Transformed inputs with a great difference should be prioritized.\nAs noted in¬†[ref]16, as one uses features extracted at the deeper layer of DNNs, the prioritization accuracy increases, but the execution time increases.\nTo find the balance between these two, the standard practice is to choose the layer in the middle of the target DNN.\nWe follow this guideline but also include a variant as a stronger benchmark; we use the logit layer as the representation layer, which, as the authors indicated, provided better prioritization estimation than the mid-intermediate layer. NC:¬† monitors and gauges the intermediate neuron activities covered by current executions at various granularity levels. They profile the range of neuron outputs into kùëòk-multisections of the major function region and corner-cases regions during the training, then identify the ratio of sections covered under test-time executions.\nIn¬†[ref]16, where NC is considered as one baseline of diversity measures, they adopt the original metric in¬† to compute the ratio of uncovered neurons given two executions; that is, the larger the value, the more diverse the two executions in terms of the NC patterns.\nWe follow this modified NC measure as one of our baselines. ATS:¬†[ref]21 is a recently proposed metric for input selection, i.e., choosing a small yet diverse subset of inputs from a large set. It computes a diversity metric from the normalized logit layer, similar to ours. It is not designed for our testing scenario, i.e., for every single input, choosing the best candidate among all transformed inputs. However, we adapt it to our scenario by feeding an input and its transformed mutants to the selection algorithm one at a time and then rank the inputs based on their metric. We include this variant as another benchmark. We will use the following abbreviations for the methods considered in the evaluation:\nFM stands for forward margin score¬†(Equation¬†2);\nFL stands for forward loss score¬†(Equation¬†3); BM stands for backward margin score¬†(Equation¬†4); BL stands for backward margin score¬†(Equation¬†5); MM stands for mixed margin score¬†(Equation¬†8); ML stands for mixed loss score¬†(Equation¬†9); BD stands for the standard tool from¬†[ref]16, BD-F stands for a variant that uses the logit layer to compute the divergence. NC stands for NC method using the layer in the middle of DNN architecture, ATS stands for the adapted tool from¬†[ref]21. To summarize, our metrics (FM, FL, BM, BL, MM, ML), ATS, and BD-F only utilize the logit layer, while BD and NC use the intermediate layer neuron activations.\nWe choose the same intermediate layer for both BD and NC.\nWe do not include evaluations of ATS on the CIFAR100 dataset since the fault pattern computation is cubic to the number of classes, which is too slow with 100 classes.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: We use three recent diversity-based testing works as benchmarks: Boosting Diversity:¬†[ref]16 is our major benchmark.
