This tradeoff was improved by\n for almost all tradeoff parameters (see also\n).\nWe mention in the passing that as direct consequence of Theorem 1.1,\nthe Subset Sum admits a time-space tradeoff using\n2n/𝒮0.5/0.249999superscript2𝑛superscript𝒮0.50.2499992^{n}/\\mathcal{S}^{0.5/0.249999} time and 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} space, for any\n𝒮≤𝒪⋆​(20.249999​n)𝒮superscript𝒪⋆superscript20.249999𝑛\\mathcal{S}\\leq\\mathcal{O}^{\\star}(2^{0.249999n}), but the obtained parameters are only better than the previous works for 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} chosen closely to its maximum. See Appendix A for a proof. In [ref]4, the authors considered Subset Sum parametrized by the parameter\nβ𝛽\\beta (which is defined as the largest number of subsets of the input integers\nthat yield the same sum) and obtained an algorithm running in time 𝒪⋆​(20.3399​n​β4)superscript𝒪⋆superscript20.3399𝑛superscript𝛽4\\mathcal{O}^{\\star}(2^{0.3399n}\\beta^{4}). Subsequently,\n showed that one can get a faster algorithm for Subset Sum than\nmeet-in-the-middle if β≤2(0.5−ε)​n𝛽superscript20.5𝜀𝑛\\beta\\leq 2^{(0.5-\\varepsilon)n} or β≥20.661​n𝛽superscript20.661𝑛\\beta\\geq 2^{0.661n}.\nRecently,  gave an algorithm for Subset Sum running in\n𝒪⋆​(20.86​n)superscript𝒪⋆superscript20.86𝑛\\mathcal{O}^{\\star}(2^{0.86n}) time and polynomial space, assuming random access to a random oracle.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
