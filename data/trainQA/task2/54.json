      "content": "Paper Title: Probabilistic Complexity Classes through Semantics\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the general setting, graphings can be defined in three different flavours: discrete, topological and measurable. In this paper, we will be working with measurable graphings, and will refer to them simply as graphings. Graphings act on a chosen space (hence here, on a measured space); the definition of graphings makes sense for any measured space 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X}, and under some mild assumptions on 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X} it provides a model of (at least) Multiplicative-Additive Linear Logic (MALL) [ref]28  [ref]27. We now fix the measure space of interest in this paper. We define the measure space 𝐗=𝐑× 𝐍×{⋆,0,1}𝐍𝐗𝐑superscript01𝐍superscript⋆01𝐍\\mathbf{X}=\\mathbf{R}\\times ^{\\mathbf{N}}\\times\\{\\star,0,1\\}^{\\mathbf{N}} where 𝐑× 𝐍𝐑superscript01𝐍\\mathbf{R}\\times ^{\\mathbf{N}} is considered with its usual Borel σ𝜎\\sigma-algebra and Lebesgue measure. The space {⋆,0,1}𝐍superscript⋆01𝐍\\{\\star,0,1\\}^{\\mathbf{N}} is endowed with the natural topology333I.e. the topology induced by basic cylindrical open sets V​(w)={f:𝐍→{0,1}∣∀i∈[lg​w],f​(i)=wi}𝑉𝑤conditional-set𝑓formulae-sequence→𝐍conditional01for-all𝑖delimited-[]lg𝑤𝑓𝑖subscript𝑤𝑖V(w)=\\{f:\\mathbf{N}\\rightarrow\\{0,1\\}\\mid\\forall i\\in[\\textnormal{lg}{w}],f(i)=w_{i}\\} where w𝑤w is a finite word on {0,1}01\\{0,1\\}., the corresponding Borel σ𝜎\\sigma-algebra and the natural measure given by μ​(V​(w))=3−lg​w𝜇𝑉𝑤superscript3lg𝑤\\mu(V(w))=3^{-\\textnormal{lg}{w}}. Borrowing the notation introduced in previous work [ref]27 , we denote by (x,𝐬,π)𝑥𝐬𝜋(x,\\mathbf{s},\\mathbf{\\pi}) the points in 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X}, where 𝐬𝐬\\mathbf{s} and π𝜋\\mathbf{\\pi} are sequences for which we allow a concatenation-based notation, e.g. we write (a,b)⋅𝐬⋅𝑎𝑏𝐬(a,b)\\cdot\\mathbf{s} for the sequences whose first two elements are a,b𝑎𝑏a,b (and we abusively write a⋅𝐬⋅𝑎𝐬a\\cdot\\mathbf{s} instead of (a)⋅𝐬⋅𝑎𝐬(a)\\cdot\\mathbf{s}). Given a permutation σ𝜎\\sigma over the natural numbers, we write σ​(𝐬)𝜎𝐬\\sigma(\\mathbf{s}) the result of its natural action on the 𝐍𝐍\\mathbf{N}-indexed list 𝐬𝐬\\mathbf{s}. Graphings are then defined as objects acting on the measured space 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X}. A parameter in the construction allows one to consider subsets of graphings based on how they act on the space. To do this, we fix a monoid of measurable maps that we call a microcosm. Again, while graphings can be defined in full generality, some conditions on the chosen microcosms are needed to construct models of MALL. The following microcosms, which are of of interest in this paper, do satisfy these additional requirements. For all integer i⩾1𝑖1i\\geqslant 1, we consider the translations for all integer z𝑧z, and the permutations for all bijection σ:𝐍→𝐍:𝜎→𝐍𝐍\\sigma:\\mathbf{N}\\rightarrow\\mathbf{N} such that σ​(k)=k𝜎𝑘𝑘\\sigma(k)=k for all k>i𝑘𝑖k>i.\nWe denote by 𝔪isubscript𝔪𝑖\\mathfrak{m}_{i} the monoid generated by those maps, and by 𝔪∞subscript𝔪\\mathfrak{m}_{\\infty} the union ∪i>1𝔪isubscript𝑖1subscript𝔪𝑖\\cup_{i>1}\\mathfrak{m}_{i}. We also consider the maps: We denote by 𝔫isubscript𝔫𝑖\\mathfrak{n}_{i} the monoid generated the microcosm 𝔪isubscript𝔪𝑖\\mathfrak{m}_{i} extended by those three maps, and by 𝔫∞subscript𝔫\\mathfrak{n}_{\\infty} the union ∪i>1𝔫isubscript𝑖1subscript𝔫𝑖\\cup_{i>1}\\mathfrak{n}_{i}. Finally, let us denote by a​+¯​b𝑎¯𝑏a\\bar{+}b the fractional part of the sum a+b𝑎𝑏a+b.\nWe also define the microcosms 𝔪¯isubscript¯𝔪𝑖\\bar{\\mathfrak{m}}_{i} (resp. 𝔫¯isubscript¯𝔫𝑖\\bar{\\mathfrak{n}}_{i}) as the smallest microcosms containing 𝔪isubscript𝔪𝑖\\mathfrak{m}_{i} (resp. 𝔫isubscript𝔫𝑖\\mathfrak{n}_{i}) and all translations 𝚝:λ(x,a⋅𝐬)↦(x,(a+¯λ)⋅𝐬)\\tt t\\rm{}_{\\lambda}:(x,a\\cdot\\mathbf{s})\\mapsto(x,(a\\bar{+}\\lambda)\\cdot\\mathbf{s}) for λ𝜆\\lambda in  01 . We are now able to define graphings. Those are formally defined as quotient of graph-like objects called graphing representatives444In earlier works [ref]28, the author did not introduce separate terminologies for graphings and graphing representatives. While this can be allowed since all operations considered on graphings are compatible with the quotient, we chose here a more pedagogical approach of introducing a clear distinction between those types of objects.. Graphing representatives are just (countable) families of weighted edges defined by a source – a measurable subset of 𝐗×D𝐗𝐷\\mathbf{X}\\times D where S𝑆S is a fixed set of states – and a realiser, i.e. a map in the considered microcosm and a new state in D𝐷D. As in previous work , we fix the monoid of weights of graphings ΩΩ\\Omega to be equal to  ×{0,1}0101 \\times\\{0,1\\} with usual multiplication on the unit interval and the product on {0,1}01\\{0,1\\}. To simplify notations, we write elements of the form (a,0)𝑎0(a,0) as a𝑎a and elements of the form (a,1)𝑎1(a,1) as a⋅𝟏⋅𝑎1a\\cdot\\mathbf{1}. On this set of weights, we will consider the fixed parameter map m​(x,y)=x​y𝑚𝑥𝑦𝑥𝑦m(x,y)=xy in the following (used in subsection 2.2. We fix a measure space 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X}, a microcosm 𝔪𝔪\\mathfrak{m}, a monoid ΩΩ\\Omega, a measurable subset VGsuperscript𝑉𝐺V^{G} of 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X}, and a finite set SGsuperscript𝑆𝐺S^{G}. A (ΩΩ\\Omega-weighted) 𝔪𝔪\\mathfrak{m}-graphing representative G𝐺G of support VGsuperscript𝑉𝐺V^{G} and stateset SGsuperscript𝑆𝐺S^{G} is a countable set where SeGsubscriptsuperscript𝑆𝐺𝑒S^{G}_{e} is a measurable subset555As DGsuperscript𝐷𝐺D^{G} is considered as a discrete measure space, a measurable subset of the product is simply a finite collection of measurable subset indexed by elements of DGsuperscript𝐷𝐺D^{G}. of VG×DGsuperscript𝑉𝐺superscript𝐷𝐺V^{G}\\times D^{G}, ϕeGsubscriptsuperscriptitalic-ϕ𝐺𝑒\\phi^{G}_{e} is an element of 𝔪𝔪\\mathfrak{m} such that ϕeG​(SeG)⊆VGsuperscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑒𝐺subscriptsuperscript𝑆𝐺𝑒superscript𝑉𝐺\\phi_{e}^{G}(S^{G}_{e})\\subseteq V^{G}, 𝚒,eG𝚘eG\\tt i\\rm{}^{G}_{e},\\tt o\\rm{}^{G}_{e} are elements of DGsuperscript𝐷𝐺D^{G}, and ωeG∈Ωsubscriptsuperscript𝜔𝐺𝑒Ω\\omega^{G}_{e}\\in\\Omega is a weight. We will refer to the indexing set EGsuperscript𝐸𝐺E^{G} as the set of edges. For each edge e∈EG𝑒superscript𝐸𝐺e\\in E^{G} the set SeG×{𝚒}eGS^{G}_{e}\\times\\{\\tt i\\rm{}^{G}_{e}\\} is called the source of e𝑒e, and we define the target of e𝑒e as the set TeG×{𝚘}eGT^{G}_{e}\\times\\{\\tt o\\rm{}^{G}_{e}\\} where TeG=ϕeG​(SeG)subscriptsuperscript𝑇𝐺𝑒subscriptsuperscriptitalic-ϕ𝐺𝑒subscriptsuperscript𝑆𝐺𝑒T^{G}_{e}=\\phi^{G}_{e}(S^{G}_{e}). The notion of graphing representatives captures more than just an action on a space. Indeed, consider a graphing representative G𝐺G with a single edge of source S⊎S′⊎𝑆superscript𝑆′S\\uplus S^{\\prime}, weight w𝑤w and realiser f𝑓f. Then the graphing representative H𝐻H having two edges of weight w𝑤w, realiser f𝑓f and respective sources S𝑆S and S′superscript𝑆′S^{\\prime} intuitively represent the same action on 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X} as G𝐺G. In other words, the notion of graphing representative captures both the notion of action and a notion of representation of this action. The auuthor therefore defines a notion of refinement which allows for the consideration of the equivalence G∼Hsimilar-to𝐺𝐻G\\sim H that captures the fact that G𝐺G and H𝐻H represent the same action. Let F,G𝐹𝐺F,G be graphing representatives. Then F𝐹F is a refinement of G𝐺G – written F⩽G𝐹𝐺F\\leqslant G – if there exists a partition666We allow the sets EeFsubscriptsuperscript𝐸𝐹𝑒E^{F}_{e} to be empty.

Then two graphing representatives are equivalent if and only if they possess a common refinement. The actual notion of graphing is then an equivalence class of the objects just defined w.r.t. this equivalence. A graphing is an equivalence class of graphing representatives w.r.t. the induced equivalence: Since all operations considered on graphings were shown to be compatible with this quotienting [ref]28, i.e. well defined on the equivalence classes, we will in general make no distinction between a graphing – as an equivalence class – and a graphing representative belonging to this equivalence class. Let F𝐹F and G𝐺G be graphings such that VF=V⊎Csuperscript𝑉𝐹⊎𝑉𝐶V^{F}=V\\uplus C and VG=C⊎Wsuperscript𝑉𝐺⊎𝐶𝑊V^{G}=C\\uplus W with V∩W𝑉𝑊V\\cap W of null measure.
