CommNet  attempts to leverage communications in cooperative MARL by using multiple continuous-valued transmissions at each time step to make decisions for all agents.\nEach agent broadcasts its message to every other agent, and the averaged message received by each agent forms part of the input.\nHowever, this solution lacks scalability as it depends on a centralized network by treating the problem as a single RL problem.\nSimilarly, BiCNet  utilizes recurrent neural networks to connect individual agent’s policy with a centralized controller aggregating the hidden states of each agent, acting as communication messages. The reliance of the aforementioned works on a broadcast channel to communicate with all the agents simultaneously may be infeasible or highly inefficient in practice.\nTo overcome this limitation, in , the authors propose an attentional communication model that learns when communication is needed and how to integrate shared information for cooperative decision making.\nIn , directional communication between agents is achieved with a signature-based soft attention mechanism, where each message is associated to the target recipient.\nThey also propose multi-stage communication, where multiple rounds of communication take place before an action is taken. It is important to note that, with the exception of , all of the prior works discussed above rely on error-free communication channels.\nMARL with noisy communications is considered in , where two agents placed on a grid world aim to coordinate to step on the goal square simultaneously.\nHowever, for the particular problem presented in , it can be shown that even if the agents are trained independently without any communication at all, the total discounted reward would still be higher than the average reward achieved by the scheme proposed in .\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: for multi-agent systems is not new .\nHowever, due to the success of deep neural networks (DNNs) for reinforcement learning (RL), this problem has received renewed interest in the context of DNNs [ref]24 and deep RL (DRL) [ref]18  [ref]36, where partially observable multi-agent problems are considered.\nIn each case, the agents, in addition to taking actions that impact the environment, can\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
