      "content": "Paper Title: Hierarchical Estimation for Effective and Efficient Sampling Graph Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph neural network (GNN) , [ref]2, , ,  has achieved great success in handling graph structure data. By aggregating the information of their neighbours and performing nonlinear feature transformation iteratively, the power of GNN’s capturing features has been proved to be impressive . Currently, various variants of GNN such as graph convolution network (GCN) , graphSAGE [ref]2 and graph attention network (GAT)  are widely used in numerous scenarios, e.g., traffic prediction , , , recommender systems 0, 1, 2. However, traditional multi-layer GNNs require the entire graph to be loaded into memory at once, and the neighbour size of each node expands exponentially as the number of layers increases. Such two challenges compel the traditional GNNs to lose the scalability confronted with large-scale graph data. Even if the method of mini-batch training  copes with these problems to a certain extent, the exponentially expansion of neighbours’ size still makes mini-batch based GNNs powerless to handle the huge computational and storage costs. Therefore, numerous researchers aim to design GNN models suitable for large-scale graphs 3, , 4, 5, 6. Among these studies, employing Bernoulli sampling to reduce the size of neighbours involved in the information aggregation for each node is one of the most prevalent methods [ref]2, 7, 8, 9, , , [ref]22, , , . Presently, most of the previous studies can be divided into three paradigms: node-wise sampling [ref]2, 7, , , , layer-wise sampling 8, 9, , and subgraph sampling , [ref]22. Specifically, node-wise sampling limits the size of the neighbours by sampling a fixed number of nodes for each node but this paradigm still faces exponentially increasing complexity. By comparison, layer-wise sampling and subgraph sampling breakthroughly limit the exponentially expanding neighbour’s size to linear growth with layer numbers. Layer-wise sampling fixes the total numbers of sampled nodes in each layer while subgraph sampling decomposes the original graph into small subgraphs and learns representation on each subgraph respectively to control the calculation cost. At the aspect of implementation, layer-wise sampling methods do sampling before each iteration while subgraph sampling only partition the original large-scale graph at the very beginning of the whole training process. This technical difference allows layer-wise sampling to take into account all the neighbours of each node as much as possible but reduces the training efficiency when the graph is giant, subgraph sampling stands in the opposite apparently. The above paradigms can effectively reduce the cost of training while they will inevitably bring bias and variance to the traditional full-batch information aggregation operator. Significantly, excessive bias and variance will seriously lead to the nodes’ representations learned by the model fluctuating on the computation graph sampled in different iteration, which hinders the effective training of graph neural networks. Several methods have successfully avoided bias to the greatest extent with the theoretically designed unbiased node samplers. However, it is difficult to reduce the variance of the node sampler on the basis of the unbiased estimation. Previous studies either ignore variance analysis such as ClusterGCN [ref]22 and GraphSAINT  node sampler, or design a variance analysis framework limited to one of the three sampling paradigms, e. g., VRGCN focuses on the node-wise sampling, FastGCN 8 and ASGCN  conduct variance analysis in layer-wise sampling. Taking into account the pros and cons of each sampling paradigm, a framework that can perform unified node sampling variance analysis for variance reduction on the three sampling paradigms is expected to be designed. So in our study, we design an unified node sampling variance analysis for three above sampling paradigms to derive the minimum variance node sampler firstly. Then we analyze the critical challenge for obtaining minimum variance node sampler named circular dependency and point out the shortcomings of previous methods from the perspective of circular dependency. Next, considering the remaining exponent explosion in node-wise sampling, we propose the Hierarchical Estimation based Sampling GNN (HE-SGNN) for layer-wise sampling and subgraph sampling respectively to combat the circular dependency. Note that the hierarchical estimation node sampler strategy is applicable for node-sampling. Finally, We evaluate the performance of our proposed method on multiple datasets to verify its effectiveness and efficiency. In the remainder of this section, we will introduce the unified node sampling variance analysis framework and our hierarchical estimation in more detail. Specifically, the unified node sampling variance analysis framework is obtained on the basis of unbiased estimator for vanilla GNN. We minimize the variance sum of the each node’s embeddings in each layer obtained by unbiased estimator and find out that the expected closed-form solution of minimum variance node sampler cannot be obtained due to the circular dependency shown in Fig. 1. The sampling probability of minimum variance node sampler is determined by 222-norm of the multiplication of the node embeddings and parameters. However, the node embeddings in ℋ​𝒲ℋ𝒲\\mathcal{HW} depends on the nodes sampled in the sampling process, which is not feasible without determining the sampling probability, resulting in circular dependency. Such dilemma also occurs in previous methods while is not well solved. For layer-wise sampling, previous methods utilize importance sampling ,  and heuristically approximate the ℋ​𝒲ℋ𝒲\\mathcal{HW} as shown in Fig. 1a, e.g., leveraging constant value in FastGCN 8 or the features of the node itself with external parameters in ASGCN . However, these studies all ignore neighbour-aggregation information to when calculating the sampling probability, resulting in variance not being effectively reduced. Furthermore, the external introduced parameters lead to a substantial increase in the sampling time cost which is hard to implement when layers goes deeper. For subgraph sampling, few studies have analyzed the attainment of the minimum variance node sampler. ClusterGCN [ref]22 applies clustering algorithm which brings in bias and variance and cost much time for large-scale graph. GraphSAINT  also ignores the variance analysis and lacks considering the neighbour-aggregation information ℋ​𝒲ℋ𝒲\\mathcal{HW} for their proposed node samplers. Overall, there still lacks a both efficient and effective variance reduction methods. Under such situation, it is critical to solve such dilemma and approximate the minimum variance node sampler. We propose hierarchical estimation based sampling GNN with firstly estimating the node embeddings and calculate sampling probability based on this estimations and secondly employing GNN operator to aggregate the information of the sampled computation graph to estimate the nodes’ representations on the entire graph for breaking circular dependency. In detail, we apply different skillful methods to design the hierarchical estimation in layer-wise sampling and subgraph sampling considering their technical difference. For layer-wise sampling, HE-SGNN establishes the sequence relationships among epochs and regards the historical information of the ℋ​𝒲ℋ𝒲\\mathcal{HW} as multiple time series simulations demonstrated in Fig. 1a to estimate the current ℋ​𝒲ℋ𝒲\\mathcal{HW}. To make each node can be sampled and then obtain a precise estimation, we employ optimistic initialization to increase the early exploration of this model. Note that this hierarchical estimation node sampler strategy is applicable for approximating the minimum variance sampler of node-wise sampling paradigm as well. For subgraph sampling, sampling is only done once before training, resulting in that no historical information is available for sampling to break circular dependency. So our proposed HE-SGNN firstly utilize the input node features to replace the neighbour-aggregation information of hidden layers for estimation, then aggregates information for estimating the node embeddings on the entire graph. However, there is no guarantee for the connection between the sampled nodes which causes inadequate neighbour-aggregation information for isolated nodes. Different form node sampler, edge sampler eliminates the the isolated nodes by conducting the partition by adding the two nodes connected with the sampled edge to the subgraph. Inspired by the edge sampler proposed in GraphSAINT, we innovatively induce an edge sampler from the node sampling probability which is acquired from our unified variance analysis framework. In conclusion, the main contributions of our study are as follows: (1) We unify the variance reduction analysis framework of three sampling paradigms and point out the critical challenge for obtaining the minimum variance sampler, i.e., circular dependency. (2) We propose the hierarchical estimation based layer-wise sampling GNN, which leverages time series sampling to estimate the ℋ​𝒲ℋ𝒲\\mathcal{HW} and calculates node sampling probability, then conducts sampling GNN. (3) We estimate the ℋ​𝒲ℋ𝒲\\mathcal{HW} with input node features to break circular dependency for further estimating node embeddings in GNN, i.e., hierarchical estimation based subgraph sampling GNN. Furthermore, we apply node sampling probability induced edge sampler based GNN to learn node representations. (4) We conduct experiments on seven authoritative datasets and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model over the powerful baselines.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Graph neural network (GNN) , [ref]2, , ,  has achieved great success in handling graph structure data.
