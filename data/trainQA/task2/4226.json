      "content": "Paper Title: Similarity-aware Positive Instance Sampling for Graph Contrastive Pre-training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPretraining Data Collection.\nWe conduct the pretraining on four datasets from various domains:\n1). academic and purchasing graphs: we collect four data sources from Deep Graph Library  and merge them into one pretraining dataset dubbed AP_NF. 2). social graphs: we construct two pretraining datasets termed SocS_NF and SocL_NF. SocS_NF contains five data sources, while SocL_NF contains 13 data sources collected from TUDataset . 3). molecular graphs: we use the same pretraining dataset with 2 million molecules in [ref]15 and denote it as MolD. The suffix NF indicates “no feature”. Since the data sources have different features, we remove all feature and only pretrain these datasets with HGC.\nThe details are presented in Appendix A.1. Downstream Tasks.\nWe mainly evaluate the peformance on two tasks, node classfication and graph classification.\nFor the node classification, we conduct the experiments on two datasets, US-Airport  and H-index  following the same splitting protocol in [ref]26. For the graph classification, we conduct the experiments on 11 datasets from molecular graph (7 datasets from [ref]39) and social graphs (4 datasets from ). Details of those datasets are deferred to Appendix A.1. Baselines. \nFor molecular graph classification, we comprehensively compare our pre-training strategies with recent 666 self-supervised learning strategies for graphs. Among them, Edge_Pred, Infomax, Attr_Mask, Context_Pred, are proposed in [ref]15, all of which are node-level pre-training strategies. GraphCL  and C_Subgraph [ref]26 are graph level contrastive pre-training strategies. For node classification and social network graph classification, we compare our model with the best result of GCC [ref]26 and several other models (i.e., ProNE , GraphWave , DGK , graph2vec , InfoGraph , DGCNN  and GIN ). Details for the implementation, pre-training and fine-tuning settings of baseline models will be discussed in the Appendix A.2 and A.3. Pre-training Settings.\nWe use Adam  for optimization with the learning rate of 0.0010.0010.001, β1=0.9,β2=0.999formulae-sequencesubscript𝛽10.9subscript𝛽20.999\\beta_{1}=0.9,\\beta_{2}=0.999 and weight decay of 00, learning rate warms up over the first 10%percent1010\\% steps and then decays linearly. Gradient norm clipping is applied with range [−1,1]11[-1,1]. The temperature τ𝜏\\tau is set to 0.070.070.07 in HGC pre-training stage. The batch size of MolD pre-training is 256256256. For SocL_NF and SocS_NF pre-training, the batch size is 323232. For the graph classification task, we use mean-pooling to get graph-level representations following [ref]15. More pre-training details, including backbones, hyper-parameters and training steps are deferred to Appendix A.2.2. Fine-tuning Settings.\nFor each fine-tuning task, we train models for 100100100 epochs. For graph classification tasks (whether social graphs or molecular graphs), we select the best model by their corresponding validation metrics, while the last model after 100100100 epochs training on downstream training sets are used for further evaluation on downstream evaluation sets, the same with [ref]26.\nWe adopt micro F1-score and ROC-AUC as the evaluation measures for different tasks. For molecular dataset, as suggested by [ref]39,\nwe apply three independent randomly initialized runs on each dataset and report the mean and standard deviation. More details are are deferred to Appendix A.2.2.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: SocL_NF. SocS_NF contains five data sources, while SocL_NF contains 13 data sources collected from TUDataset . 3). molecular graphs: we use the same pretraining dataset with 2 million molecules in [ref]15 and denote it as MolD. The suffix NF indicates “no feature”. Since the data sources have different features, we remove all feature and only pretrain these datasets with HGC.\nThe details are\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
