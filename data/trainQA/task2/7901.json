      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to Transfer for Evolutionary Multitasking\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the real world, complex optimization problems abound. Traditional numerical optimization algorithms often struggle to solve these problems efficiently due to their non-convexity and black-box properties. Against this backdrop, evolutionary computation (EC)  algorithms have been widely adopted to tackle such challenging optimization problems. However, these algorithms are typically designed to solve one task at a time, which can be computationally inefficient when dealing with a multitude of intertwined tasks that potentially share some similarities and commonalities. Recognizing this limitation, a more advanced search paradigm, known as evolutionary multitasking (EMT)  , has recently emerged. Unlike traditional EC algorithms, EMT does not handle each task in isolation. Instead, it seeks to solve multiple optimization tasks simultaneously by leveraging the inherent complementarities and sharing useful information between the tasks to improve search performance. The problem of solving multiple tasks concurrently is called the multitask optimization problem (MTOP) while the technique of sharing useful information is referred to as knowledge transfer (KT) . As the core of the EMT, the KT process plays a vital role in achieving satisfactory optimization performance. Typically, existing EMT algorithms can be classified into two categories according to the design of KT including the implicit EMT  and the explicit EMT . The implicit EMT algorithms employ the evolution operators for conducting implicit KT while explicit EMT algorithms involve an explicit learning and transformation process to perform knowledge extraction for KT. The implicit EMT is efficient and straightforward because it implements KT based on search operators with a small computational overhead. Therefore, implicit EMT has been successfully applied to solve various complex optimization problems  . Despite its promise, a proper design of the KT process in implicit EMT requires considering the issues of when to transfer and how to transfer to ensure transfer effectiveness. The “when to transfer” issue refers to dynamically adapting the implicit KT intensity while the “how to transfer” issue refers to the process of extracting knowledge by evolution operators such as crossover  from the source task. However, existing designs of KT intensity adaptation rely on limited information of the current evolution state such as the feedback of KT  and estimated inter-task similarity  based on manually defined heuristic rules. This insufficient use of evolution information can lead to suboptimal designs of KT. Moreover, most KT processes in implicit EMT rely on a single  or just a few [ref]9 evolution operators. The optimization tasks in practical MTOPs often display a wide array of unique characteristics, necessitating a diverse range of evolution operators for effective adaptation. This constrained use of evolution operators could hinder the ability of implicit KT to adapt to new and unseen MTOPs with varied task distributions. Therefore, the challenge lies in how to better adapt the KT intensity and the evolution operator within the KT process to suit the specific needs of MTOPs that have tasks originating from a particular distribution. Additionally, designing a suitable KT process is usually human expertise-driven and takes considerable trial-and-test efforts on the problem set of interest. This human-dependent design process hinders users from applying EMT to solve a wide range of real-world MTOPs. Given the above challenges discussed, it is apparent that a more adaptive and automatic KT process is needed. To this end, we take cues from the learning to optimize 0 in the meta-learning domain to address these challenges. Learning to optimize is a kind of technique aiming to automatically discover how to perform optimization from the optimization experience gained on a problem set by machine learning methods such as reinforcement learning (RL). In specific, we propose a novel Learning to Transfer (L2T) framework in this paper to address these challenges. First, we identify that the KT process along the implicit EMT process can be formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) to maximize the transfer quality and overall search performance. Based on this formulation, the KT process can be regarded as the sequential decisions on when and how to transfer made by an agent associated with certain parameters along the implicit EMT process. By parameterizing the agent as an actor-critic network, we proposed to learn well-performing implicit KT policy by proximal policy optimization (PPO) 1. Specifically, PPO serves to train the network parameters so that the agent can maximize the transfer quality and search efficiency. Finally, the learned agent can be seamlessly incorporated with different EC algorithms to solve both the seen and the unseen MTOP instances. To our knowledge, little research has been paid to improve the adaptability and automation of the KT process by jointly addressing when to transfer and how to transfer with the RL technique. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we introduce an L2T framework that refines the adaptability of the KT process within the implicit EMT process. This framework enhances the ability of implicit EMT to effectively address a broad spectrum of MTOPs, accommodating an array of task similarities and relationships. Second, we propose a test suite with diverse task distributions and function characteristics to evaluate the adaptability of the EMT algorithms and conduct comprehensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed L2T on this test suite. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II provides an overview of EMT, related works on KT for implicit EMT, and learning to optimize. Section III introduces the proposed L2T framework and its implementation in detail. Section IV presents the experimental studies to evaluate the performance and verify the effectiveness of the proposed L2T framework. Finally, the concluding remarks and future works are given in Section V.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: on manually defined heuristic rules.
