      "content": "Paper Title: Minimum-Error Triangulations for Sea Surface Reconstruction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nReconstructing the sea level for the past is of paramount importance for understanding the influences of climate change.\nTwo types of observational data are often used for this task: (1) data from tide gauge stations, which are usually located at the sea shore, and (2) gridded altimeter data acquired from satellites.\nThe tide gauge data is available from the 18th century from stations that are sparsely distributed globally\n(e.g., the RLR database given by the PSMSL contains 1 548 stations).\nThe gridded altimeter data, which has been acquired since 1993, admits much more accurate reconstructions of the sea surface for the last 29 years.\nWe build on the work by Nitzke et al. , who suggested an approach\nfor combining these two types of data using integer linear programming techniques.\nThe approach is to learn a plausible triangulation of the tide gauge stations for an epoch E𝐸E for which the altimeter data is available,\nand then use that triangulation to reconstruct the sea surface in another epoch, where gauge data is available, but no altimeter data.\nGiven the gauge and altimeter data for E𝐸E, the task is to compute a minimum-error triangulation of the gauge stations,\nthat is, a triangulation that minimizes the sum of squared differences between the reference (altimeter) data and the piecewise linear surface defined with the triangulation. For piecewise linear surfaces, Delaunay triangulations are often chosen, since they have many desirable properties.\nHowever, they are unique and so they do not have potential for optimization.\nOn the other hand, computing a minimum-error triangulation among the set of all triangulations can lead to badly shaped triangles,\nwhich can cause large interpolation errors for epochs other than the training epoch.\nTherefore, Nitzke et al.  suggested computing a triangulation of minimum error among all k𝑘k-order Delaunay (k𝑘k-OD) triangulations [ref]16.\nA k𝑘k-OD triangulation consists of triangles with up to k𝑘k points inside each triangle’s circumcircle (k=0𝑘0k=0 corresponds to Delaunay triangles).\nThis creates room for optimization while ensuring (reasonably) well-shaped triangles.\nMoreover, restricting the solution to the set of k𝑘k-order Delaunay triangulations has computational advantages. Nitzke et al.  modeled their approach as an integer linear program (ILP) and evaluated it on the North Sea dataset with up to 40 stations and k≤3𝑘3k\\leq 3, whose locations are projected on the plane; see Figure 1.\nThe evaluation showed that the k𝑘k-OD minimum-error triangulation is substantially more effective than the method based on the Delaunay triangulation suggested in  for Sea Surface Anomaly reconstructions of up to 19 years back in time. The aim of our work is to speed up the above approach using computational geometry in order to apply it to areas of global extent (instances with up to 800 tide gauge stations). We first show that\nthe minimum-error triangulation problem is NP-hard and that it is even NP-hard to approximate an optimal solution. We discuss an alternative optimization approach to the ILP-based one by Nitzke et al. . Our approach is based on the dynamic programming (DP) algorithm by Silveira and Van Krefeld . The runtime of the DP algorithm depends on the Delaunay order k𝑘k; since we are only interested in small orders, we are able to calculate minimum-error order-k𝑘k Delaunay triangulations for the datasets given by the sea surface reconstruction problem. The algorithm’s runtime depends on a subgraph of the Delaunay triangulation, which we call the order-k𝑘k fixed-edge graph.\nIt is known that for order 111 the fixed-edge graph is connected [ref]16. We investigate the fixed-edge graph for orders k=2,3𝑘23k=2,3. We show that for k=2𝑘2k=2 no vertex can be isolated and give an example where the fixed-edge graph is not connected. For k≥3𝑘3k\\geq 3 we give an example where ⌊n6⌋𝑛6\\lfloor\\frac{n}{6}\\rfloor connected components are inside a face of the fixed-edge graph, which implies exponential runtime for the algorithm. This complements the observations by Silveira et al. given in . We perform experiments with different projections of the tide gauge dataset to analyze the structure of the fixed-edge graphs for a real-world dataset. Our experiments confirm the assumption by Silveira and Van Krefeld  that the DP algorithm can be used to solve practical problems for medium-sized datasets, if the order is small (k≤7𝑘7k\\leq 7). Lastly, we perform the reconstruction task that was given in  for the global dataset. Our evaluation shows that on the used global dataset with up to 800 stations the quality improves with growing k𝑘k, which contrasts with the findings in  on the local North Sea dataset with about 40 stations, where k=2𝑘2k=2 consistently delivered the best reconstructions. The paper is organized as follows. First, we outline the formal definitions of the triangulation problem in Section 2. After that, we discuss related works in Section 3. In Section 4 we present our NP-hardness proof for the minimum-error triangulation problem. Section 5 presents the DP algorithm by Silveira et al.  and discusses our findings regarding the fixed-edge graphs. In Section 6 we provide the application of the DP algorithm to the sea surface reconstruction problem. Finally, we give our conclusion in Section 7.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: interpolation errors for epochs other than the training epoch.\nTherefore, Nitzke et al.  suggested computing a triangulation of minimum error among all k𝑘k-order Delaunay (k𝑘k-OD) triangulations [ref]16.\nA k𝑘k-OD triangulation consists of triangles with up to k𝑘k points inside each triangle’s circumcircle (k=0𝑘0k=0 corresponds to Delaunay triangles).\nThis creates room for optimization while\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
