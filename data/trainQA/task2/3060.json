      "content": "Paper Title: IV-GNN : Interval Valued Data Handling Using Graph Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nArtificial Neural Network (ANN) is a branch of the general Machine Learning literature, which is inspired by biological neural networks (Fig.1) [ref]1. It has proven to work well in several Machine Learning related tasks such as Recognition, Classification, Prediction, and so on . It has outperformed traditional Machine Learning techniques while solving problems in various fields like Image Processing, Computer Vision, Speech Recognition, Machine Translation, Bioinformatics, Natural Language Processing, and many others [ref]1. Traditional Neural Network deals with those data which belong to the Euclidean space [ref]3. However, most of the data from the real-life scenario do not have a Euclidean structure behind them and can be represented better as Non-Euclidean data such as graphs and manifolds. For instance, in the e-commerce system , the interactions between users and products can be represented as graphs. Additionally, bio-active molecules and their bio-activity [ref]5 can be modelled as graphical data. In citation networks , papers can be viewed as nodes of a graph, and the link between different papers via citation can be modelled as edges of that graph. One of the basic differences of Euclidean and Non-Euclidean space is, unlike Euclidean space, a straight line joining any two points in Non-Euclidean space is not necessarily the shortest path between them. Therefore, applying the Artificial Neural Network technique to solve different task on the Non-Euclidean domain is not that straight forward and has several challenges . Graph data are full of non-uniformity. Each graph consists of a different number of nodes, and each node in the graph has a variable number of neighbours. Hence, convolution type operations are not directly applicable here. Application of the existing Machine Learning algorithm is not always possible because instances are not independent here. In graphical data, the nodes share connections with other nodes via edges. So, to extract maximum information about the data while performing any specified task, it is necessary to capture this inter dependency among nodes. The purpose behind Graph Neural Network is to perform various types of prediction and analytical tasks on graphs using deep learning approaches, as it is known that deep learning approaches are computationally capable of approximating most of the practically valuable functions on graphs . The main idea behind Graph Neural networks is to find low-dimensional vector embedding of nodes in a large graph, which will capture the structural information of the graph as well as the feature information of the nodes. However, previous works on Graph Neural Network are focused on the graphs, where the input feature space is countable . There are several instances where it is difficult to allocate a precise value to some features. Assigning an interval of value to one extend manages to capture the uncertainty of the feature space . For example, rather than recording a person’s weekly expense for every week during a specific period, it can be summarized to an interval with the minimum and maximum weekly outlay. An interval of systolic and diastolic pressure describes the blood pressure of a person . The traditional approach to analyze the interval-valued data was to use the midpoint of the interval to a regression model .\nNevertheless, the Center Method (CM) does not consider the variations of the intervals. To overcome this drawback, Center-Range Method (CRM) uses two interval-valued regression models for mid-points and the ranges of the interval values . However, in general, the mid-points and half ranges are related, which is not taken into account by CRM . Bivariate Center and Range Method (BCRM) uses two regression models using mid-points and half-ranges of the intervals, which take care of the effects of intervals widths . \nAll these linear regression models can be used to analyze data with a linear pattern. Using Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs)  , a GNN model is proficient in overcoming this deficiency. Then an interesting question to be asked will be, why not use two end points of an interval as two separate features of a node and apply an existing GNN architecture accepting countable node feature of a graph. Answer to this question is although neural network has ability to capture relationship among different node features, interval is a quantitative measurement, where there is an order and the difference of two end points is meaningful. Our aim is to exploit this property of interval and develop an appropriate GNN architecture, where the model is capable enough to accept multiple intervals and output a single representation on its own. This will allow us to consider an interval as a unit through out the progress of the algorithm and perform the classification task as a function of the interval valued feature as well as the structure of the graph. Motivated by this situation, we introduce a new aggregation function of intervals, named as a​g​rn​e​w𝑎𝑔subscript𝑟𝑛𝑒𝑤agr_{new}.and develop a neural architecture Interval-valued Graph Neural Network (IV-GNN) to apply on interval-valued data using MLPs and the newly developed a​g​rn​e​w𝑎𝑔subscript𝑟𝑛𝑒𝑤agr_{new} as its basic building blocks. Now, we give a summary of our main contributions here: We introduce a new aggregation function a​g​rn​e​w𝑎𝑔subscript𝑟𝑛𝑒𝑤agr_{new} and precisely discuss its representational power. We identify interval structures that previously available interval aggregation schemes can not distinguish. We develop a neural-based architecture Interval-Valued Graph Neural Network (IV-GNN), that can deal with interval-valued features. We discuss the space and time complexities of our proposed algorithm and validate our theoretical findings through performing graph classification tasks on several datasets. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The related works on Graph Neural Network are reviewed in the Section 2. We have discussed about necessary basics of Graph Neural Network, Interval Mathematics and Aggregation Operator in the Section 3. The proposed framework for Interval-Valued Graph Neural Network (IV-GNN) is introduced in Section 5. The results of the experimental study are presented in Section 6, and finally, the concluding remarks are made in Section 7.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a branch of the general Machine Learning literature, which is inspired by biological neural networks (Fig.1) [ref]1.
