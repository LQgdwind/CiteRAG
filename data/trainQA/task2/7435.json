      "content": "Paper Title: On Computationally Efficient Multi-Class Calibration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we prove the following theorem showing an efficient kernel-based auditing algorithm for projected smooth calibration (Definition 2.5). There exists c>0𝑐0c>0 so that for any α,δ∈(0,1/2)𝛼𝛿012\\alpha,\\delta\\in(0,1/2) and m∈[2,k]𝑚2𝑘m\\in[2,k], there is an (α,1/mO​(1/α))𝛼1superscript𝑚𝑂1𝛼(\\alpha,1/m^{O(1/\\alpha)}) auditor for m𝑚m-projected smooth calibration (and hence also for m𝑚m-subset smooth calibration), with success probability at least 1−δ1𝛿1-\\delta, sample complexity n=O​(k​mO​(1/α)​log⁡(1/δ))𝑛𝑂𝑘superscript𝑚𝑂1𝛼1𝛿n=O(km^{O(1/\\alpha)}\\log(1/\\delta)), and running time poly⁡(n,k,1/α)poly𝑛𝑘1𝛼\\operatorname{poly}(n,k,1/\\alpha). Even when we consider subset calibration over arbitrary subsets, which corresponds to taking m=k𝑚𝑘m=k, the running time of the auditor is kO​(1/α)superscript𝑘𝑂1𝛼k^{O(1/\\alpha)}, which is polynomial in k𝑘k for every fixed α𝛼\\alpha. In the next section (Section 8), we show that this running time cannot be improved to poly⁡(k,1/α)poly𝑘1𝛼\\operatorname{poly}(k,1/\\alpha) under standard complexity-theoretic assumptions.\nAt the end of this section, we show that the dependence on α𝛼\\alpha can be improved if we consider sigmoid functions instead of all 111-Lipschitz functions. We prove Theorem 7.1 using Algorithm 2, together with polynomial approximations. Low degree polynomial approximations have been used successfully for agnostic learning, starting with the work of [KKMS08]. The important work of [SSS11] showed that one can improve the efficiency of such learning algorithms by kernelizing them. Using results from [GKKT17] and [She13], we will show the following bound on multivariate polynomials obtained by composing bounded univariate polynomials with innner products. Let p𝑝p be a univariate polynomial of degree d𝑑d so that |p​(u)|≤1𝑝𝑢1|p(u)|\\leq 1 for u∈[−1,1]𝑢11u\\in[-1,1]. Let p𝐚​(𝐯)=p​(𝐚⋅𝐯)subscript𝑝𝐚𝐯𝑝⋅𝐚𝐯p_{\\mathbf{a}}(\\mathbf{v})=p({\\mathbf{a}}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}) where 𝐚∈[−1,1]d𝐚superscript11𝑑{\\mathbf{a}}\\in[-1,1]^{d} and 𝐯∈Δk𝐯subscriptΔ𝑘\\mathbf{v}\\in\\Delta_{k}. Then p𝐚∈Γ​(d)subscript𝑝𝐚Γ𝑑p_{\\mathbf{a}}\\in\\Gamma(d) and We prove Lemma 7.2 using the following two lemmas from the literature: [GKKT17, Lemma 2.7]\nLet p=∑i=0dηi​ui𝑝superscriptsubscript𝑖0𝑑subscript𝜂𝑖superscript𝑢𝑖p=\\sum_{i=0}^{d}\\eta_{i}u^{i} be a univariate polynomial of degree d𝑑d and p𝐚​(𝐯)=p​(𝐚⋅𝐯)subscript𝑝𝐚𝐯𝑝⋅𝐚𝐯p_{\\mathbf{a}}(\\mathbf{v})=p({\\mathbf{a}}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}) for 𝐚∈[−1,1]k𝐚superscript11𝑘{\\mathbf{a}}\\in[-1,1]^{k} and 𝐯∈Δk𝐯subscriptΔ𝑘\\mathbf{v}\\in\\Delta_{k}. Then [She13, Lemma 4.1]\nFor a degree d𝑑d polynomial p​(u)=∑i=0dηi​ui𝑝𝑢superscriptsubscript𝑖0𝑑subscript𝜂𝑖superscript𝑢𝑖p(u)=\\sum_{i=0}^{d}\\eta_{i}u^{i} satisfying |p​(u)|≤1𝑝𝑢1|p(u)|\\leq 1 for u∈[−1,1]𝑢11u\\in[-1,1], it holds that ∑i=0d|ηi|≤4dsuperscriptsubscript𝑖0𝑑subscript𝜂𝑖superscript4𝑑\\sum_{i=0}^{d}|\\eta_{i}|\\leq 4^{d}. By Lemma 7.4, we can bound We plug this bound into Lemma 7.3 to get Let LipLip\\mathrm{Lip} denote the set of all bounded 111-Lipschitz functions ϕ: [ref]1→[−1,1]:italic-ϕ→0111\\phi: [ref]1\\to[-1,1].\n\nWe use an approximation result for arbitrary Lipschitz functions using Jackson’s theorem [Che66], together with a rescaling argument to ensure boundedness. A similar argument for the ReLU function appears in [GKKT17, Lemma 2.12]. There exists a constant c′>0superscript𝑐′0c^{\\prime}>0 such that for any ϕ∈Lipitalic-ϕLip\\phi\\in\\mathrm{Lip} and any ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, there exists a univariate polynomial p​(t)𝑝𝑡p(t) with deg⁡(p)≤c′/εdegree𝑝superscript𝑐′𝜀\\deg(p)\\leq c^{\\prime}/\\varepsilon such that for t∈[−1,1]𝑡11t\\in[-1,1], |ϕ​(t)−p​(t)|≤εitalic-ϕ𝑡𝑝𝑡𝜀\\left|\\phi(t)-p(t)\\right|\\leq\\varepsilon . p​(t)∈[−1,1]𝑝𝑡11p(t)\\in[-1,1]. By Jackson’s theorem [Che66], there exist a polynomial p​(t)𝑝𝑡p(t) so that\n|ϕ​(t)−p​(t)|≤ε/2italic-ϕ𝑡𝑝𝑡𝜀2\\left|\\phi(t)-p(t)\\right|\\leq\\varepsilon/2 for t∈[−1,1]𝑡11t\\in[-1,1] where deg⁡(p)≤O​(1/ϵ)degree𝑝𝑂1italic-ϵ\\deg(p)\\leq O(1/\\epsilon).\nSince |ϕ​(t)|≤1italic-ϕ𝑡1|\\phi(t)|\\leq 1, |p​(t)|≤1+ε/2𝑝𝑡1𝜀2|p(t)|\\leq 1+\\varepsilon/2. Now let pϕ​(t)=p​(t)/(1+ε/2)subscript𝑝italic-ϕ𝑡𝑝𝑡1𝜀2p_{\\phi}(t)=p(t)/(1+\\varepsilon/2) so that |pϕ​(t)|≤1subscript𝑝italic-ϕ𝑡1|p_{\\phi}(t)|\\leq 1. We then bound Combining Lemmas 7.5 and 7.2, we have the following corollary. For any ϕ∈Lipitalic-ϕLip\\phi\\in\\mathrm{Lip}, and ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, let p𝑝p be as in Lemma 7.5. For 𝐚∈[−1,1]k𝐚superscript11𝑘{\\mathbf{a}}\\in[-1,1]^{k}, let p𝐚​(𝐯)=p​(𝐚⋅𝐯)subscript𝑝𝐚𝐯𝑝⋅𝐚𝐯p_{{\\mathbf{a}}}(\\mathbf{v})=p({\\mathbf{a}}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}). Then p𝐚∈Γ​(d)subscript𝑝𝐚Γ𝑑p_{{\\mathbf{a}}}\\in\\Gamma(d) for d=O​(1/ε)𝑑𝑂1𝜀d=O(1/\\varepsilon) and |p𝐚​(𝐯)−ϕ​(𝐚⋅𝐯)|≤εsubscript𝑝𝐚𝐯italic-ϕ⋅𝐚𝐯𝜀\\Bigl{\\lvert}p_{{\\mathbf{a}}}(\\mathbf{v})-\\phi({\\mathbf{a}}\\cdot\\mathbf{v})\\Bigr{\\rvert}\\leq\\varepsilon,  for every v∈Δk𝑣subscriptΔ𝑘v\\in\\Delta_{k}. ∥p𝐚∥Γ​(d)≤c1max(1,∥𝐚∥2)c2/ε\\left\\lVert p_{{\\mathbf{a}}}\\right\\rVert_{\\Gamma(d)}\\leq c_{1}\\max(1,\\left\\lVert{\\mathbf{a}}\\right\\rVert_{2})^{c_{2}/\\varepsilon}. We now complete the proof of Theorem 7.1. We claim that if psCEm​(𝒟)≥αsubscriptpsCE𝑚𝒟𝛼\\mathrm{psCE}_{m}(\\mathcal{D})\\geq\\alpha, then 𝖢𝖤(ℬΓ​(d)​(r))k​(𝒟)≥α/2subscript𝖢𝖤superscriptsubscriptℬΓ𝑑𝑟𝑘𝒟𝛼2\\mathsf{CE}_{(\\mathcal{B}_{\\Gamma(d)}(r))^{k}}(\\mathcal{D})\\geq\\alpha/2 for some r=mO​(1/α)𝑟superscript𝑚𝑂1𝛼r=m^{O(1/\\alpha)}. To see this, take ψ∈pLipk𝜓superscriptpLip𝑘\\psi\\in\\mathrm{pLip}^{k} so that For every i=1,…,k𝑖1…𝑘i=1,\\ldots,k, there exists 𝐚i∈[−1,1]ksubscript𝐚𝑖superscript11𝑘{\\mathbf{a}}_{i}\\in[-1,1]^{k} and ϕ∈Lipitalic-ϕLip\\phi\\in\\mathrm{Lip} such that ψ(i)​(𝐯)=ϕ(i)​(⟨𝐚i,𝐯⟩)superscript𝜓𝑖𝐯superscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖subscript𝐚𝑖𝐯\\psi^{(i)}(\\mathbf{v})=\\phi^{(i)}(\\langle{\\mathbf{a}}_{i},\\mathbf{v}\\rangle) for i∈[k]𝑖delimited-[]𝑘i\\in[k] where ∥𝐚i∥2≤msubscriptdelimited-∥∥subscript𝐚𝑖2𝑚\\left\\lVert{\\mathbf{a}}_{i}\\right\\rVert_{2}\\leq\\sqrt{m}.\nBy Corollary 7.6, there exists p(i)∈Γ​(d)superscript𝑝𝑖Γ𝑑p^{(i)}\\in\\Gamma(d) where d=O​(1/α)𝑑𝑂1𝛼d=O(1/\\alpha) such that Hence p(i)∈ℬΓ​(d)​(r)superscript𝑝𝑖subscriptℬΓ𝑑𝑟p^{(i)}\\in\\mathcal{B}_{\\Gamma(d)}(r) for each i𝑖i for r=mO​(1/α)𝑟superscript𝑚𝑂1𝛼r=m^{O(1/\\alpha)}.

By the triangle inequality where we use ∥𝐲∗−𝐯∥1≤2subscriptdelimited-∥∥superscript𝐲𝐯12\\left\\lVert\\mathbf{y}^{*}-\\mathbf{v}\\right\\rVert_{1}\\leq 2.\nAs a result we have We now apply Lemma 6.4 with the weight functions (ℬΓ​(d)​(r))ksuperscriptsubscriptℬΓ𝑑𝑟𝑘(\\mathcal{B}_{\\Gamma(d)}(r))^{k} where d=O​(1/α),r=mO​(1/α)formulae-sequence𝑑𝑂1𝛼𝑟superscript𝑚𝑂1𝛼d=O(1/\\alpha),r=m^{O(1/\\alpha)}\nto get an (α/2,Ω​(α3/2/mc/α))𝛼2Ωsuperscript𝛼32superscript𝑚𝑐𝛼(\\alpha/2,\\Omega(\\alpha^{3/2}/m^{c/\\alpha}))-auditing algorithm.\n∎\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: 4^{d}.
