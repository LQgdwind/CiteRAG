      "content": "Paper Title: S-HR-VQVAE: Sequential Hierarchical Residual Learning Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder for Video Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this study, we assess the performance of state-of-the-art video prediction methods on the KTH Human Action and Moving-MNIST datasets, providing a comprehensive overview of the advancements in the field. In particular, Table II lists state-of-the-art methods from 2015 to 2023 in a chronologically ascending order, highlighting thereby the evolution of the techniques over the years. S-HR-VQVAE results are reported in the last two rows with disjoint and joint training, respectively.\nOn the KTH Human Action task, PSNR and SSIM are reported by all state-of-the-art techniques; whereas LPIPS is provided for only a few methods. On the Moving-MNIST task, SSIM and MSE are reported by most of the state-of-the-art techniques; whereas PSNR is provided by only a few of them. Referring to Table II, we can observe that the different metrics improve over the years.\nHowever, when trying to determine the best method, we observe that methods performing best in one metric are usually outperformed by other methods in other metrics.\nFor example, for KTH Human Action, R-ST-ConvLSTM [ref]21 attains the best PSNR but not the best SSIM which was obtained by Conv-TT-LSTM .\nSimilarly for LPIPS, PredRNN-V2  has the best performance, however, the method is outperformed by R-ST-ConvLSTM [ref]21 and, Conv-TT-LSTM  in PSNR and SSIM, respectively.\nSimilar observations can be made for the Moving-MNIST task.\nIt can be argued that starting from 2018, all methods are quite competitive with one another, and it is not actually possible to indicate a single technique that performs the best on the video prediction task across all metrics.\nIn order to compare our method to the state-of-the-art, we have therefore decided to consider results across all available metrics. We can see from Table II that the proposed S-HR-VQVAE, outperforms on the KTH Human Action task all methods up to fRNN  in all reported metrics.\nFor the methods proposed after fRNN , S-HR-VQVAE outperforms PredRNN++ [ref]17 on two metrics out of three (SSIM and LPIPS), E3D-LSTM  on all metrics, Conv-TT-LSTM  on two metrics out of three (PSNR and LPIPS), LMC-Memory  on two metrics out of three (SSIM and LPIPS), V-3D-ConvLSTM [ref]27 on all metrics, R-ST-ConvLSTM [ref]21 on one out of two metrics (SSIM), and finally PredRNN-V2  and VPTR  on two metrics out of three (PSNR and SSIM). On the Moving-MNIST task, our method outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on all metrics up to PredRNN++ [ref]17.\nFor the methods proposed after PredRNN++ [ref]17, S-HR-VQVAE outperforms E3D-LSTM  on one out of two metrics (SSIM), Conv-TT-LSTM  on one out of two metrics (MSE), V-3D-ConvLSTM [ref]27 on one out of two metrics (SSIM), R-ST-ConvLSTM [ref]21 on one out of two metrics (SSIM), and finally PredRNN-V2  and VPTR  on all metrics.\nFor the Moving-MNIST task, LMC-Memory  outperforms our method on both reported metrics. However, we do not know how this method would perform on PSNR. From this analysis, we can conclude that, although some of the state-of-the-art methods outperform our method on a single metric, our method seems to be more robust across all metrics for both of the considered tasks. For example, Conv-TT-LSTM  has the overall best SSIM both for KTH Human Action and Moving-MNIST, but we outperform it both on PSNR and LPIPS (KTH Human Action) and MSE (Moving-MNIST).\nR-ST-ConvLSTM [ref]21 has the overall best PSNR on KTH Human Action and Moving-MNIST, but we outperform it on SSIM (both on KTH Human Action and Moving-MNIST).\nV-3D-ConvLSTM [ref]27 has the overall best MSE on Moving-MNIST, but S-HR-VQVAE outperforms it on SSIM (Moving-MNIST) and on all reported metrics for KTH Human Action.\nFinally, PredRNN-V2  has the overall best LPIPS on KTH Human Action, but S-HR-VQVAE outperforms it on PSNR and SSIM for the KTH Human Action task and SSIM and MSE for the Moving-MNIST task. It is worth mentioning that these results are obtained with an S-HR-VQVAE model that owns a number of parameters lower, and in some cases orders of magnitude lower, than that of all of the competing models. Finally, from Table II we can also evince that the proposed joint training of HR-VQVAE and ST-PixelCNN has a positive effect on the results both for KTH Human Action and Moving-MNIST tasks.\nThe effectiveness of our approach can be further appreciated by considering the following qualitative analyses. In fact, objective metrics might not capture all aspects of the the actual quality of the predicted sequence.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: to determine the best method, we observe that methods performing best in one metric are usually outperformed by other methods in other metrics.\nFor example, for KTH Human Action, R-ST-ConvLSTM [ref]21 attains the best PSNR but not the best SSIM which was obtained by Conv-TT-LSTM .\nSimilarly for LPIPS, PredRNN-V2  has the best performance, however, the method is outperformed by\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
