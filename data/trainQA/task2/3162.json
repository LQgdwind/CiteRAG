      "content": "Paper Title: Phase Transition of the 3-Majority Dynamics with Uniform Communication Noise\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe consensus problem is a fundamental problem in distributed computing  in which we have a system of agents supporting some opinions that interact between each other by exchanging messages, with the goal of reaching an agreement on some valid opinion (i.e. an opinion initially present in the system). In particular, many research papers focus on the majority consensus problem where the goal is to converge towards the initial majority opinion. The numerous theoretical studies in this area are justified by many different application scenarios, ranging from social networks [ref]38 , swarm robotics , cloud computing, communication networks , and distributed databases , to biological systems 3 4. As for the latter, the goal of the majority consensus problem is to model some real-world scenarios where biological entities need to communicate and agree in order to pursue some collective task. Many biological entities in different real situations perform this type of process, e.g. molecules , bacteria , flock of birds [ref]9, school of fish 2, or social insects 5, such as honeybees 0. In such applicative scenarios, communication among agents is often affected by some form of noise. For this reason, one of the main goal in network information theory is to guarantee reliable communications in noisy networks 6.\nIn this context, error-correcting codes are very effective methods to reduce communication errors in computer systems  , and this is why many theoretical studies of the (majority) consensus problem assume that communication between entities occurs without error, and instead consider some adversarial behavior (e.g., byzantine fault ).\nDespite their effectiveness in computer applications, error-correcting codes are quite useless if we want to model consensus in biological systems.\nIndeed, they involve sending complicated codes through communication links, and it is reasonable to assume that biological type entities communicate between each other in a simpler way.\nFor this reason, in recent years many works have been focusing on the study of the (majority) consensus problem where the communication between entities is unreliable and subjected to uniform noise 3 4  . The first consensus dynamics that have been studied in the presence of noise communication are linear opinion dynamics, such as the Voter dynamics and the Averaging dynamics. In particular, they were studied in the presence of uniform noise communication  or in the presence of some communities of stubborn agents (i.e. agents that never change opinion)   6.\nIn these settings, only metastable forms of consensus can be achieved, where a large subset of the agents agree on some opinion while other opinions remain supported by smaller subsets of agents, and this setting lasts for a relatively-long time.\nHowever, the Voter model has a slow convergence time even in fully connected networks and a large initial bias towards some majority opinion 8, and the Averaging dynamics requires agents to perform non-trivial computation and, more importantly, to have large local memory. For these reasons, linear opinion dynamics struggle explaining the observed metastable consensus in multi-agent systems   2,\nand many research papers have begun to investigate new, more plausible, non-linear opinion dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, the Undecided-State dynamics is the first non-linear opinion dynamics analyzed in the presence of uniform communication noise . The aforementioned dynamics exhibits a phase-transition which depends on the noise parameter, and a metastable phase of almost-consensus is quickly reached and kept for long time when the noise isn’t too high. The Undecided-State dynamics turns out to be a fast, very resilient dynamics, and this may explain why this type of process is adopted in some biological systems 0. In this work, we consider the popular 3-Majority dynamics, which is based on majority update-rules, the latter being widely employed also in the biological research field 0 . In particular, we introduce in the system an uniform communication noise feature, following the definition of .\nIt has been proven that such dynamics, without communication noise, has a very similar behaviour to that of the Undecided-State dynamics . As we describe in the next section, the two dynamics behaves similarly (even if with crucial differences) even in presence of uniform noise, as both exhibit a phase transition. However, although 3-Majority dynamics makes use of more per-round communications, it turns out to be less resilient to noise than Undecided-State dynamics.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: where the goal is to converge towards the initial majority opinion.
