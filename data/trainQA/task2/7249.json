      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-task robot data for dual-arm fine manipulation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFine manipulation, which involves the precise control of delicate objects, is an important research topic because robots are expected to replace fine motor skills traditionally performed by humans in the near future. Deep imitation learning [ref]2 [ref]3, which learns state-action pairs from expert demonstration data via deep neural networks, is a promising approach for fine manipulation because it directly maps a robot’s sensory observation to an action, thereby eliminating the need for engineering features and manipulation skills by robot engineers and enabling learning even in cases that involve an unknown environment or object models. In recent studies on deep imitation learning, researchers have aimed for the generalization of robot manipulation skills by scaling up the dataset size  [ref]4 . These efforts have culminated in the release of , a comprehensive dataset which aggregates over one million episodes from these studies. This large-scale dataset helps efficient research in the robotics community by eliminating the need for individual, time-consuming data generation. However, in many of these studies, researchers primarily focused on the single-arm grasping and placing of objects (e.g.,  [ref]4), which lack fine manipulation skills. We released a robot manipulation dataset containing 224k demonstration episodes that includes fine manipulation and dual-arm skills. This dataset includes data for fine manipulation, such as dual-arm pencil case opening and manipulation of various deformable objects (e.g., thread, banana, and handkerchief), in addition to the manipulation of small and thin objects, such as small bolts, thin coins, and plastic cards. It also includes a human expert’s gaze coordinates measured using an eye tracker during demonstrations and dual-action labels to support learning fine manipulation. To learn fine manipulation, we used and improved the deep learning architecture by implementing Dual-Action and Attention (DAA), which was initially proposed in  and later enhanced in . In imitation learning, the attention mechanism contributes to a policy inference that is robust to covariate shift – a scenario in which training and test domain distributions are different  – by extracting manipulation-related information from the robot’s sensory inputs. Visual attention 0 is formed by learning human gaze information during demonstrations, creating object-centric high-resolution foveated vision, effectively filtering out task-unrelated features (background and other objects), and enabling the computationally efficient learning of fine manipulation using high-resolution object pixels because this approach excludes task-unrelated pixels from the computation. Somatosensory attention 1 uses a self-attention structure 2 for robust policy inference, thereby effectively addressing covariate shift in extended robot embodiment, such as dual-arms. Dual-action was inspired by physiological studies 3 that showed that humans separate approximate reaching and accurate homing in object manipulation. It models global-action for rough object reaching and local-action for precise object manipulation separately. Global-action is robust to compounding errors 4 and local-action allows for precise object manipulation, thus achieving robustness and fine manipulation skills simultaneously. This model enables the learning of fine manipulation tasks, such as needle-threading  and banana-peeling . DAA was previously demonstrated in fine manipulation tasks  . In this research, DAA shows that a variety of fine manipulation tasks are possible under various environmental conditions, thereby proving its generality. This model was validated using various tasks, such as opening pencil cases, moving large bowls with both hands, grasping various objects, picking up thin objects, such as coins, and folding towels. The contributions of this paper are as follows: First, we creat a multi-task imitation learning dataset that includes dual-arm, fine manipulation skills and gaze-based attention information, and make it publicly available. Second, we demonstrate that dual-action and attention mechanisms enable the multi-task dual-arm fine manipulation skills in the dataset to be performed.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: control of delicate objects, is an important research topic because robots are expected to replace fine motor skills traditionally performed by humans in the near future.
