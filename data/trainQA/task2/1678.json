To cope with the candidate generation tasks, collaborative filtering¬†(CF) is one of the most pervasive methods.\nIt captures users‚Äô interests from their historical interactions¬†(e.g., clicks and purchases).\nThrough the information it focuses on, it can broadly fall into three categories: item-based approaches¬†  , user-item (UI) approaches¬†  , and user-based approaches¬†  .\nItem-based approaches rely on item-item relations which are usually stable.\nThey compute the item similarity matrix in advance and then recommend items which are similar to what the users have interacted with.\nWhile promising, these methods compute item similarities in a user-irrelevant manner, thus restricting their performance.\nTo tackle this problem, UI methods takes more personalized information into account.\nThey project users and items into a shared latent space and then recommend items which are close to the user in the space. Despite the prevalence and effectiveness of UI approaches, we argue that they only capture the global structure of the item-item relations like item-based models¬†.\nThere could exist pairs of items whose similarities tend to be small but display a strong correlation in a specific subset of users.\nFor example, consumers usually do not buy beer and diapers together, while new parents tend to purchase them together.\nTherefore, though beer and diapers exhibit weak relations in a global aspect, they display strong relations in the new parents.\nHowever, item-based methods and UI approaches project these pairs towards average position according to the whole users‚Äô interactions.\nThis drawback restricts their performances. To address the above challenge, we attempt to model the local relations from a user-based aspect¬†   [ref]22 .\nFor each user, we identify a set of users who have similar historical interactions, and then recommend items those similar users ever interacted with.\nTraditional user-based methods, such as UserKNN¬†, identify similar users by computing user similarities directly from the original high-dimensional user interaction vectors.\nIt is not affordable with millions even billions of items.\nTo tackle this problem, some works factorize the user-item interaction matrix to reduce the dimension of user representations¬† .\nHowever, these methods can hardly be applied in real-world applications, since they usually fail to infer users‚Äô new preference in time. To illustrate the necessity of the real-time issue, we analyze the changes of users‚Äô interests on the Taobao platform.\nWe reflect this change by recording the proportion of categories that users click today and also clicked in the last two weeks.\nFor each user, we record the number of categories that she clicks today.\nAnd then, for each of these categories, we look for the day she first clicked this category in the last two weeks.\nThe results are visualizing in Figure¬†1.\nThe value of xùë•x-axis denotes the number of days before today.\nFor example, the bar of x=0ùë•0x=0 demonstrates those categories are only clicked today and they were not clicked in the last two weeks.\nThe bar of x=4ùë•4x=4 demonstrates those categories, which the user clicks today, are first clicked at 4 days before today.\nWe observe that most of the categories, around 50%, that users click today are new categories.\nTherefore, users‚Äô interests are sharply changing and we need to adapt to users‚Äô dynamic interests in real time to make better recommendations.\nHowever, when encountering with users‚Äô new interactions, these transductive models need to\nrefactorize the new user-item matrix to infer new user representations, which is not affordable in the real-world services. To tackle this challenge, we attempt to infer user representations in real time and then identify the similar users in real time.\nWith the recent advances of latent factor and deep learning techniques¬†  , it is easy to update user vectors with new interactions in real time.\nWith the dynamically inferred user representations,\nusers‚Äô neighborhood can be identified timely via efficient similarity search tools like Faiss¬†.\nSpecifically, we propose a general framework called Self-Complementary Collaborative Filtering (SCCF) which captures both global and local relations in real-time settings.\nThere are three components in SCCF.\nUI component derives user and item representations which encode complex global relations.\nThen without any auxiliary parameters, user-based component identifies each user‚Äôs appropriate neighborhood with the above representations, thus discovering the local patterns shared by her similar users.\nFinally, a neural network fuses the aforementioned results and derives the candidate list.\nHence, with the SCCF framework, we can complement the UI models with the local information hidden in user-user relations.\nIn addition, our SCCF framework can be regarded as a post-processing plugin to any inductive UI models whether shallow latent factor models or deep learning models, and whether sequential or non-sequential models. Our primary contributions can be summarized as follows: We revisit the user-based methods and reveal that it can enhance broadly used UI methods in a local aspect. Our framework addresses\nthe real-time recommendation issues of traditional user-based approaches. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address this problem in the literature. We propose a framework called Self-Complementary Collaborative Filtering (SCCF), which can be seamlessly incorporated into inductive UI models and capture both global and local information. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SCCF framework against state-of-the-art UI methods and user-based methods. We analyze the change of users‚Äô interests and also conduct an online A/B test on our e-commercial platform‚ÄîTaobao.\nThe results demonstrate the significance of capturing users‚Äô dynamic interests and verify the effectiveness of our SCCF framework. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.\nWe first list the relevant existing methods in section 2.\nThen, in section 3, we represent the details of SCCF framework and explain how to employ it to existing inductive UI models.\nWe provide the evaluation methodology, the datasets characteristics, and the experimental results on both public datasets and our online platform in secion 4 to support our claims.\nFinally, we provide some concluding remarks in section 5.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: select the top items based on the estimated scores.\nThis two-step procedure is widely adopted in the large scale industry recommender systems owing to its scalability and fast inference performance¬†[ref]1 [ref]2       .\nIn this paper, we focus on the candidate generation stage¬†, which is usually referred to as the top-NùëÅN recommendation¬† in the academic area.
