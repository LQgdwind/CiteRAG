      "content": "Paper Title: A Comprehensive Overview on 5G-and-Beyond Networks with UAVs: From Communications to Sensing and Intelligence\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAccording to International Mobile Telecommunications-2020 (IMT-2020), 5G networks are expected to support a diverse variety of use cases in three main pillar categories [ref]11: Enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) which aims to support data-intensive use cases such as virtual and augmented reality (V/AR), requiring high data rates across a wide coverage area . Ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) which aims to support mission-critical applications such as remote surgery, autonomous vehicles, and the Tactile Internet, requiring both ultra-high reliability and short delay  . Massive machine-type communications (mMTC) which aims to provide connectivity for massive numbers of power-limited devices with heterogenous traffic profiles such as in the industrial Internet-of-Things (IoT) . Although some of the above scenarios have been well studied for terrestrial wireless networks [ref]11, their techniques and results may not be directly applicable to future 3D wireless networks featuring both UAVs (either as aerial users or as communication platforms) and ground users, due to their significantly different operating environments. More importantly, the new degrees of freedom they introduce for system design have been unexplored previously but can help further enhance the communication performance. On the one hand, providing these services simultaneously for both UAVs and ground users imposes new technical challenges    . For example, since UAVs usually operate at much higher altitudes than conventional terrestrial users, exploiting the high beamforming gain via multiple antennas to provide eMBB service to UAVs requires ground BSs to have the capability of steering the beam not only in azimuth but also in the elevation plane. As such, the typical downtilted BS antennas need to be reconfigured, since currently they cater only to ground coverage as well as suppression of inter-cell interference in long-term evolution (LTE) systems. In addition, the line-of-sight (LoS) dominated air-ground channels inherent to UAVs at high altitudes lead to smaller path loss due to less severe shadowing and multi-path fading. As a result, leveraging spectrum sharing to simultaneously support both UAVs and ground users in mMTC scenarios will generate significant ground-air interference to UAVs in the downlink, while in the uplink, UAVs will cause stronger interference to a large number of ground users even if they are distributed in the network . Moreover, high UAV mobility generally results in more frequent handovers and time-varying wireless backhaul links between UAVs and ground BSs/users, which poses practical challenges in URLLC scenarios. As such, it is imperative to develop new techniques and/or new designs, e.g., efficient handover management and resource allocation, to tackle the above issues to guarantee seamless service provisioning in the 3D space. On the other hand, the emerging 3D wireless networks also introduce new design opportunities to better serve users in a cost-effective manner  [ref]20  . For example, by leveraging mobility to increase the operating altitude or bypass obstacles, UAV-BSs/users are able to intelligently reposition themselves to avoid signal blockage to ground nodes caused by e.g., high-rise buildings. This is practically appealing for millimeter wave (mmWave) communications that are expected to provide eMBB services. Furthermore, for IoT/sensor networks, a hybrid network architecture composed of high altitude UAV-BSs/relays and their ground counterparts is able to achieve wider ground coverage. In addition, UAV-enabled mobile data collectors can move close to IoT devices to collect data, such that their transmit energy is minimized. This is particularly beneficial in mMTC scenarios where connectivity and energy consumption are critical factors . Moreover, non-trivial tradeoffs may exist in leveraging these advantages [ref]20   [ref]26. For instance, although exploiting the high mobility of a UAV access point/data sink via trajectory design could improve the communication throughput, this comes at the cost of exceedingly long user access delays [ref]26 , which thus may not be appropriate for delay-sensitive URLLC applications. Furthermore, to reap the promised benefits of UAV-assisted cellular communications, there are still many important problems that need to be addressed, including more accurate air-ground channel modelling, traffic-adaptive UAV deployment and/or trajectory design, energy consumption modelling and energy-efficient design, and high-speed and reliable backhauling. Besides the requirement for high-performance wireless communications, the ability to support effective and efficient sensing is also essential for realizing the vision of integrating UAVs into 5G-and-beyond networks. On the one hand, sensing techniques are helpful in achieving safe UAV operation and intelligent air traffic management. On the other hand, UAVs can be leveraged as aerial sensing platforms to collect information in the sky. Recently, radio-based sensing technologies have received increasing attention due to their ability to achieve contactless and privacy-preserving object detection and environmental monitoring. Although the principles and objectives of radio-based sensing and radio-based communication systems are different, there have been significant research efforts to investigate their coexistence, cooperation, and joint design, thus leading to a new paradigm referred to as joint communication and sensing (JCAS)    . This is because the same wireless infrastructure, RF hardware, and spectrum can be shared by both systems, which avoids the high costs of building dedicated wide-area sensing infrastructure and also helps unleash the maximum potential of cellular networks. Despite these appealing advantages, the research on JCAS in UAV communication networks is still in an early stage and there are many interesting and important problems that are open and require careful investigation. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has been considered as another key enabling technology for 5G-and-beyond wireless networks integrated with UAVs  . This is mainly due to its great potential to efficiently address challenging problems involving large amounts of data in system design and optimization, which positions AI-based approaches as powerful tools to facilitate highly dynamic UAV communication networks. For example, traditional off-line and model-driven trajectory design approaches usually require accurate and tractable communication models with perfect global knowledge of all system parameters. This limits their applicability in practical scenarios with open operating environments and time- and spatial-varying traffic, especially when considering the real-time movement of UAVs and ground users in 3D space. Instead, by leveraging, e.g., deep reinforcement learning, UAVs can be endowed with the capability of predicting future network states in an online manner and thus adapt the communication resource allocation as well as the UAV trajectories based on the network dynamics. Furthermore, UAVs with AI-embedded systems are also helpful in emerging applications such as edge computing, where multiple UAVs could work collaboratively either as aerial edge servers or edge devices to achieve efficient data/computation offloading.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: According to International Mobile Telecommunications-2020 (IMT-2020), 5G networks are expected to support a diverse variety of use cases in three main pillar categories [ref]11: Enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) which aims to support data-intensive use cases such as virtual and augmented reality (V/AR), requiring high data rates across a wide coverage area .\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
