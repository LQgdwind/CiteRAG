      "content": "Paper Title: Exact and Approximate High-Multiplicity Scheduling on Identical Machines\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn their paper , Goemans and Rothvoss showed the following result: Given rational polyhedra P,Q⊂ℝNfragmentsP,QR𝑁P,Q\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{N} where P𝑃P is bounded, one can find a vector y∈int.cone(P∩ℤN)∩Qfragmentsyint.cone(PZ𝑁)Qy\\in\\text{int.cone}(P\\cap\\mathbb{Z}^{N})\\cap Q and a vector x∈ℤ≥0|P∩ℤN|fragmentsxZfragments0fragments|PZ𝑁|x\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 0}^{|P\\cap\\mathbb{Z}^{N}|} such that y=∑c∈P∩ℤNcxcfragmentsyfragmentscPZ𝑁cx𝑐y=\\sum_{c\\in P\\cap\\mathbb{Z}^{N}}cx_{c} in time ⟨P⟩2O(N)⟨Q⟩O(1)fragments⟨P⟩fragments2fragmentsO(N)⟨Q⟩fragmentsO(1)\\langle P\\rangle^{2^{O(N)}}\\langle Q\\rangle^{O(1)} or decide that no such y𝑦y exists. Here, ⟨P⟩fragments⟨P⟩\\langle P\\rangle and ⟨Q⟩fragments⟨Q⟩\\langle Q\\rangle are the encoding lengths of P𝑃P and Q𝑄Q, respectively. They then briefly showed how this can be used directly to solve various scheduling problems. For example, they get an algorithm with running time (log(Cmax))2O(d)⟨I⟩O(1)fragments((C))fragments2fragmentsO(d)⟨I⟩fragmentsO(1)(\\log(C_{\\max}))^{2^{O(d)}}\\langle I\\rangle^{O(1)} for P||CmaxfragmentsP||C{P||C_{\\max}}. The structural result has been generalized by Jansen and Klein: Given rational polyhedra P,Q⊂ℝNfragmentsP,QR𝑁P,Q\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{N} where P𝑃P is bounded, one can find a vector y∈int.cone(P∩ℤN)∩Qfragmentsyint.cone(PZ𝑁)Qy\\in\\text{int.cone}(P\\cap\\mathbb{Z}^{N})\\cap Q and a vector x∈ℤ≥0|P∩ℤN|fragmentsxZfragments0fragments|PZ𝑁|x\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 0}^{|P\\cap\\mathbb{Z}^{N}|} such that y=∑c∈P∩ℤNcxcfragmentsyfragmentscPZ𝑁cx𝑐y=\\sum_{c\\in P\\cap\\mathbb{Z}^{N}}cx_{c} in time |V|2O(N)⟨P⟩O(1)⟨Q⟩O(1)fragments|V|fragments2fragmentsO(N)⟨P⟩fragmentsO(1)⟨Q⟩fragmentsO(1)|V|^{2^{O(N)}}\\langle P\\rangle^{O(1)}\\langle Q\\rangle^{O(1)} or decide that no such y𝑦y exists. Here, ⟨P⟩fragments⟨P⟩\\langle P\\rangle and ⟨Q⟩fragments⟨Q⟩\\langle Q\\rangle are the encoding lengths of P𝑃P and Q𝑄Q, respectively and V𝑉V is the set of vertices of the integer hull of P𝑃P. Kowalik et al.  showed that the doubly-exponential dependency on N𝑁N is necessary, unless the ETH fails.\nKnop et al. [ref]30 gave a framework for solving configuration ILPs and depending on the objective, the algorithms have different running times. As part of their framework, they also generalize the algorithm by Goemans and Rothvoss  to multiple types of P-polytopes, which allows modelling uniform and unrelated machines quite efficiently. The right-hand-sides of the systems describing the polytopes (and hence such terms as the makespan or due dates) still appear in the running time in the same way as they do in the algorithm by Goemans and Rothvoss . Knop et al.  then show how this framework can be used to obtain parameterized algorithms for various scheduling problems. For identical machines however, their running time that is not parameterized by pmaxfragmentspp_{\\max} does not provide an improvement over the running time by Goemans and Rothvoss .\nWhen one considers pmaxfragmentspp_{\\max} a parameter, there are plenty of other algorithms, mostly using ILPs as a subroutine. Mnich and Wiese  use a balancing result in combination with solving an ILP in small dimension. Knop and Koutecký  use the normal assignment ILP and solve it with an n𝑛n-fold algorithm. The framework by Knop et al.  uses huge n𝑛n-fold ILPs and proximity; a similar approach was described by Koutecký and Zink . Govzmann et al.  bound the coefficients in the configurations and use an algorithm for ILPs with few constraints. As mentioned above, Koutecký and Zink  gave an algorithm for P||CmaxfragmentsP||C{P||C_{\\max}} with running time 22O(d)∥n∥1O(1)fragments2fragments2fragmentsO(d)∥n∥1fragmentsO(1)2^{2^{O(d)}}\\left\\lVert n\\right\\rVert_{1}^{O(1)}, brilliantly combining the algorithm by Goemans and Rothvoss  with the result by Frank and Tardos  to bound the coefficients in terms of ∥n∥1fragments∥n∥1\\left\\lVert n\\right\\rVert_{1} (the total number of jobs). Moreover, they stated in a footnote (without proof) that the result by Goemans and Rothvoss gives a (log(pmax))f(d)(log(∥n∥1))O(1)fragments((p))fragmentsf(d)((∥n∥1))fragmentsO(1)(\\log(p_{\\max}))^{f(d)}(\\log(\\left\\lVert n\\right\\rVert_{1}))^{O(1)}-time algorithm for P||CmaxfragmentsP||C{P||C_{\\max}}. The running time stated by Goemans and Rothvoss  is (log(max{Cmax,∥n∥1}))f(d)fragments(({C,∥n∥1}))fragmentsf(d)(\\log(\\max\\{C_{\\max},\\left\\lVert n\\right\\rVert_{1}\\}))^{f(d)} and it is clear that ∥n∥1fragments∥n∥1\\left\\lVert n\\right\\rVert_{1} does not have to be part of the basis, as ∥n∥1fragments∥n∥1\\left\\lVert n\\right\\rVert_{1} only appears in the encoding of Q𝑄Q, but it is not clear at all how the dependency on CmaxfragmentsCC_{\\max} can be avoided if one uses the algorithm by Goemans and Rothvoss. Using either of our three tools, however, yields a running time like the one claimed by Koutecký and Zink . As mentioned above, Mnich and van Bevern  stated the parameterized complexity of P||CmaxfragmentsP||C{P||C_{\\max}} in high-multiplicity encoding with parameter d𝑑d as an open problem.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: and Q𝑄Q, respectively and V𝑉V is the set of vertices of the integer hull of P𝑃P.
