      "content": "Paper Title: Boosting Synthetic Data Generation with Effective Nonlinear Causal Discovery\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we review existing proposals in the literature related to causal discovery and synthetic data generation. The discovery of causal relationships between a set of observed variables is a fundamental problem in science because it enables predictions of the consequences of actions .\nThus, the development of automatic and data-driven causal discovery methods constitutes an important research topic   .\nA standard approach for causal discovery is to estimate a Markov equivalence class of directed acyclic graphs from the data  .\nThe independence tests often adopt linear models with Gaussian noise .\nHowever,  shows that non-Gaussian noise in linear models can actually help in distinguishing the causal directions.\nIn  [ref]17  is shown that nonlinear models can play a role similar to that of non-Gaussianity.\nIndeed, when causal relationships are nonlinear it allows the identification of causal directions by breaking the symmetry between the variables.\nAlso,  shows that non-invertible functional relationships between the variables can provide clues to identify causal relationships.\nFor nonlinear models with additive noise almost any nonlinear relationship (invertible or not) typically suggests identifiable models.\nIn [ref]17 is presented a nonlinear causal discovery approach for high dimensional data based on the idea of mapping the observations to high dimensional space with a kernel such that the nonlinear relations become simple linear ones.\nA problem of the aforementioned nonlinear causal discovery approaches is that they can miss detecting indirect causal relationships, which are frequently encountered in practice and result from omitted intermediate causal variables.\nIn  is proposed a cascade nonlinear additive noise model to represent such causal influences in a way that each direct causal relation follows the nonlinear additive noise model only observing initial cause and final effect.\nDespite various advantages of the recent proposals, to the best of our knowledge, the nonlinear causal discovery described in  is the only one that allows managing not only binary relationships.\nFor this reason, we adopt it as starting point of our procedure.\nHowever, we highlight that our proposal is a framework that can exploit the preferred causal discovery method. The need to generate synthetic data derives from the first data imputation work to solve the problem of non-responses in statistical surveys .\nIn  is described one of the first multiple imputation techniques used to synthetically generate the values of a set of missing attributes for the records of the dataset.\nIn  are implemented and extend multiple imputation approaches for the specific case of synthetic data generation.\nIn machine learning, synthetic data are often used for handling the classification task in case of imbalanced data and for addressing the problem of outcome explanation of black-box classifiers.\nConcerning imbalanced learning, the smote algorithm  generates an arbitrary number of synthetic instances to shift the learning bias toward the minority class.\nThe adasyn approach  is based on the idea of adaptively generating minority data samples according to their distributions.\nIn practice, the method generates more synthetic samples for minority classes that are harder to learn compared to those minority samples that are easier to learn.\nIn  is introduced an alternative method to synthesize data through a non-parametric technique that uses classification and regression trees.\nIn  is proposed DataSynthesizer, a technique that captures the underlying correlation structure between different attributes by building a Bayesian network.\nAnother recent generator is the Synthetic Data Vault (sdv)  which uses the multivariate Gaussian copula (gcm) to calculate the covariances between the input columns.\nAfter that, the distributions and covariances are sampled to return synthetic data.\nIn addition, recently, many generative models have been developed based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and their extensions [ref]9 and autoencoders .\nTheir success is due to their high effectiveness and flexibility in generating and representing data.\nThese approaches are particularly employed for the generation of synthetic images and, in general, for unstructured data such as text or time series.\nHowever, recently, they are being effectively applied also for the generation of tabular data.\nIn  and  are proposed synthetic tabular data generators using GANs, Conditional GANs and Variational Autoencoders (VAE).\nUnfortunately, since they are based on deep learning procedures, they require a non-negligible amount of data and a considerable amount of time.\nFinally, in eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) , data generation approaches are used to learn interpretable models able to mimic black-box decision systems.\nlime  explains the local behavior of a black-box classifier by learning a linear model on synthetic data generated around the instance to explain using a normal distribution.\nlore 0 is another local explanation method that exploits a synthetic neighborhood generation based on a genetic algorithm to create a more compact dataset around the explained instance. Among wide literature concerning synthetic data generation and causality, integrated approaches are a recently challenging research area. In 1, authors\nimplement CauseMe, a platform to benchmark causal discovery methods acting on time series.\nIn 2021, Lawrence et al. 2 propose an easily parameterizable process that provides the capability to generate synthetic time series from vastly different scenarios.\nLastly, Wood-Doughty et al. 3 present a synthetic text generator to evaluate causal inference (not causal discovery) methods.\nThus, to the best of my knowledge, no state-of-the-art synthetic data generators explicitly allow for encoding causal relationships.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: data  .\nThe independence tests often adopt linear models with Gaussian noise .\nHowever,  shows that non-Gaussian noise in linear models can actually help in distinguishing the causal directions.\nIn  [ref]17  is shown that nonlinear models can play a role similar to that of non-Gaussianity.\nIndeed, when causal relationships are nonlinear it allows the identification of causal directions by\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
