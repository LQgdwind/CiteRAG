Linear trees and star trees are relevant to understand the variation of topological distance as we have seen above (equation 1)  and also to understand the limits of the variation of Dm​i​ntsuperscriptsubscript𝐷𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑡D_{min}^{t}  . Trivially   , Iordanskii found that , which was rediscovered later in equivalent forms  , e.g. Bistar trees (bistar) consist of two stars joined by the hub and include star trees\nas an extreme case when one of the stars has only one vertex (figures 2 (b-d))  . Here we are interested in two distinct representatives: quasistar trees (quasi), where one of the original stars has only two vertices (figure 2 (c)) and balanced bistar trees (b-bistar), where the two original stars have the same size or differ in one vertex (figure 2 (d)).\nQuasistar trees are important for the theory of edge crossings in linear arrangements [ref]24 [ref]29.\nIn this article, we will unveil that balanced bistar trees maximize Dm​a​xtsuperscriptsubscript𝐷𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑡D_{max}^{t} over trees of n𝑛n vertices.\nWe will also obtain formulae for Dm​i​nq​u​a​s​isuperscriptsubscript𝐷𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑠𝑖D_{min}^{quasi} and Dm​i​nb−b​i​s​t​a​rsuperscriptsubscript𝐷𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟D_{min}^{b-bistar}.
