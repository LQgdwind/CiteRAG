      "content": "Paper Title: AutoDO: Robust AutoAugment for Biased Data with Label Noise via Scalable Probabilistic Implicit Differentiation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDA has been widely used in computer vision from shallow convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for MNIST  to deep CNNs for large-scale ImageNet  recognition. Other applications such as segmentation  and object detection  benefit from DA as well. Recent Mixup 4 and CutMix 1 heuristically mix images to produce better regularization at the semantic level. However, all these methods require to handpick a set of hyperparameters. Naturally, the idea to estimate DA hyperparameters emerged in AutoAugment  (AA) by sequentially sampling policies and using validation accuracy as a reward to update the RL controller. However, AA requires thousands of GPU hours to achieve results superior to the baseline. To speed up policy search, Ho et al.  propose population-based training  that can be efficiently parallelized across distributed CPUs or GPUs. Unlike AA, this population-based augmentation (PBA) searches for DA policy schedules rather than individual augmentations. Recent Fast AutoAugment [ref]20 (FAA) further extends this idea by searching for policy schedules that maximize the match between distribution of augmented train data and unaugmented validation data. Inspired by Tran et al. , Bayesian optimization is adopted by FAA to achieve density matching. Though the methods in  [ref]20 substantially decrease the complexity of AA , gradient-based optimization can be scaled up to even larger models and datasets. Furthermore, it is directly supported by differentiable DNNs and ML frameworks. Zhang et al. 5 and Lin et al.  adopt the REINFORCE gradient estimator , which further decreases learning time. Authors use the same policy model of  [ref]20, but estimate DA hyperparameters online within the bilevel gradient optimization framework. In this framework, an inner objective minimizes conventional train loss, while an outer objective minimizes adversarial 5 or validation  loss. Similarly, Hataya et al. [ref]11 and Li et al.  employ the DARTS gradient estimator  inspired by its success in a neural architecture search. Lastly, RandAugment  and UniformAugment  propose to dramatically decrease policy search space by a reparameterization scheme and to manually select only few DA hyperparameters. These near search-free methods are almost as effective as the computationally expensive search-based methods  [ref]20. This observation raises questions on the applicability and optimality of the search-based methods. In this paper, we show that these DA methods with the same shared-policy model perform very similarly only on undistorted train datasets. At the same time, the search-based methods can be significantly more effective and robust in the case of biased datasets with label noise. However, prior search-based methods with the shared-policy model are ill-equipped to handle distorted datasets that is sketched in Figure 1. Motivated by this, we develop our AutoDO model with the following contributions: To control train dataset distribution more accurately, we introduce the AutoDO model that jointly optimizes per-point hyperparameters for DA, loss weights and soft-labels using implicit differentiation. We analytically show that implicit differentiation minimizes the distribution shift between validation and train data by maximizing Fisher information. We also show a connection to DARTS  used in [ref]11 . Our model outperforms prior methods in image classification by up to 9.3% when the task model is trained on class-imbalanced data with label noise. More importantly, we show that it improves accuracy of underrepresented classes: by up to 36.6% for SVHN.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: parallelized across distributed CPUs or GPUs.
