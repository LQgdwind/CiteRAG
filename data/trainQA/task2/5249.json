      "content": "Paper Title: Dissecting Distribution Inference\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMachine learning models are susceptible to several disclosure risks, including leaking sensitive information related to training data.\nDistribution inference considers what a model reveals about its entire underlying training data, in contrast with inference attacks that focus on individual records like membership inference and memorization attacks. Initial work focuses on inferring ratios of data with a particular attribute, referring to the attacks as “property inference”. Examples include inferring the accent of speakers in voice recognition models , targeting ratios of characteristics like gender labels , and estimating sentiment across email datasets [ref]24.\nMore recently, there have been attempts to extend these attacks to properties beyond ratios, such as predicting graph density 7, node/edge properties of groups within graphs , and direct regression over graph mean-degree [ref]31 with successful inference adversaries with just black-box access. State-of-the-art distribution inference attacks achieve non-trivial distinguishing accuracies  [ref]31 5 and thus pose a privacy risk, but the actual amount of leakage achieved is often minimal.\nLeakage varies significantly across different datasets, but for most settings the best current attacks leak no more information than what one or two samples from the distribution would reveal [ref]31. This is enough to have a significant advantage in distinguishing highly dissimilar distributions, but seems unlikely to pose a serious privacy risk in most cases. Contributions.\nWe advance the understanding of distribution inference risk on several fronts including an improved attack, analysis of risk, and development and evaluation of defenses. We introduce a new black-box attack, the KL Divergence Attack, that uses distributional similarity in predictions (Section II-B) and substantially outperform the current state-of-the-art (Section III), increasing previous estimates of inference leakage for various datasets in the literature. Surprisingly, we find that in most settings our black-box KL Divergence Attack is more effective than the best known white-box attack.\nWe also evaluate the black-box attacks in more realistic settings where the adversary does not have as much information as is typically assumed in inference experiments (Section IV). We evaluate the impact of different model architectures (Section IV-A), the lack of common feature extractors (Section IV-B), and relaxing the assumption of prediction probabilities to label-only access settings (Section IV-C).\nOur experiments find large variances in inference risk due to relaxing assumptions about model architectures and feature extractors, but demonstrate that attacks can be effective in label-only settings. Section V evaluates defenses, including both previously proposed ones and new ideas. Most privacy-related defenses for machine learning involve adding noise at some stage of the training; for instance, at the gradient-level in differentially private training , or at the data level with most implementations of adversarial training . Our experiments find that these noise-based defenses provide little mitigation against distribution inference (Section V-A).\nAt some level, this is unsurprising since these defenses are designed to protect individual training records, not distributional properties, and we show a connection between how well a model generalizes to the task distribution and its susceptibility for distribution inference leakage (Section V-B). We then develop a simple and inexpensive mitigation based on data re-sampling (Section V-C) which can protect against distribution inference in most cases where an adversary knows the statistical property to protect.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: inference”.
