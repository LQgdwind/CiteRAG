      "content": "Paper Title: An Empirical Analysis of Measure-Valued Derivatives for Policy Gradients\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nComplex robotics tasks, such as locomotion and manipulation, can be formulated as Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems in continuous state and action spaces¬†.\nThe RL objective is commonly an expectation dependent on a parameterized control policy, whose optimization is done by computing a gradient w.r.t.¬†the policy parameters to steadily move them in the gradient ascent direction¬† ‚Äì known as the policy gradient.\nIf the control policy is stochastic, this method can be viewed as computing the gradient of an expectation w.r.t.¬†a distribution containing the policy parameters, both in the actor-only version¬†, as well as in the actor-critic one¬†. If the gradient of the expectation of a function w.r.t.¬†the distribution parameters cannot be found analytically, there are three main approaches to obtain an unbiased estimate: the likelihood-ratio, also called Score-function (SF); the Pathwise Derivative, commonly known as the Reparametrization trick (Rep-trick); and the Measure-Valued Derivative (MVD)¬†[ref]5. In policy gradients, the gradient estimation problem has been solved extensively using the SF, which is known to produce high-variance estimates, particularly if used in trajectory-based formulations, since its variance grows linearly with the number of steps in the trajectory¬†.\nThus, many methods require a baseline for variance reduction¬†, and the optimal one needs to be computed for every single case¬†.\nFrequently used baseline heuristics are the mean of the returns or the state value function.\nREINFORCE is an example of a SF based method¬†. Generally, the Rep-trick¬† is a low variance gradient estimator that can be used in distributions of continuous and discrete random variables. For the latter, the Gumbel-softmax trick allows the backpropagation of gradients¬†0. Moreover, it requires the function we are optimizing to be differentiable, which excludes non-differentiable approximators, such as regression trees¬†1.\nAlthough the Rep-trick often produces low variance estimates, this property does not hold for all function classes, in particular those whose derivative has a high Lipschitz constant¬†2. An example of an algorithm using this estimator is the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)¬†3. MVD is another method to compute unbiased gradient estimates, which has close connections to Finite-difference (FD), and it is not used often in the Machine Learning (ML) community.\nSimilarly to the SF it applies to both discrete and continuous distributions, but it generally has low variance and avoids computing an extra baseline for variance reduction.\nContrary to the Rep-trick, it is not restricted to differentiable functions, which makes it applicable to more function classes.\nFew works have studied its application to RL¬†4 . In this paper, we analyze the properties of MVD in actor-critic policy gradient algorithms for on and off-policy RL.\nWe compare the estimation errors produced by the three different estimators in Linear-Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problems, for which we know the true value function and policy gradient.\nWe show that replacing the Rep-trick with MVD in an off-policy deep RL algorithm leads to similar performance results, even in complex environments with high-dimensional state and action spaces.\nTo argue that MVDs can be generally used with broader classes of critic approximators, where the Rep-trick is not available, we construct an example of an on-policy procedure that uses a QùëÑQ-function fitted with Extra-Trees¬†1 ‚Äì a non-differentiable model.\nThe results suggest that this type of estimator can be used to compute policy gradients in continuous state and action spaces.
