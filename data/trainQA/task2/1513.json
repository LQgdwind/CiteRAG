We thank Tim Quatman for implementing JSON-export of strategies in STORM and Pushpak Jagtap for his support with the SCOTS models.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA controller (also known as strategy, policy or scheduler) of a system assigns to each state of the system a set of actions that should be taken in order to achieve a certain goal. For example, one may want to satisfy a given specification of a robot’s behaviour or exhibit a concurrency bug appearing only in some interleaving.\nIt is desirable that the controllers possess several additional properties, besides achieving the goal, in order to be usable in practice.\nFirstly, controllers should be explainable.\nOnly then can they be understood, trusted and implemented by the engineers, certified by the authorities, or used in the debugging process [ref]10.\nSecondly, they should be small in size and efficient to run.\nOnly then they can be deployed on embedded devices with limited memory of a few kilobytes, while the automatically synthesized ones are orders of magnitude larger .\nThirdly, whenever the primary goal, e.g. functional correctness, is accompanied by a secondary criterion, e.g. energy efficiency, they should be performant with respect to this criterion. Automatic controller synthesis is able to provide controllers for a given goal in various domains, such as probabilistic systems  , hybrid systems     or reactive systems .\nIn some cases, even the performance can be reflected .\nHowever, despite recent interest in explainability in connection to AI-based controllers [ref]2 and despite typically small memories of embedded devices, automatic techniques for controller synthesis mostly fall short of producing small explainable results.\nA typical outcome is a controller in the form of a look-up table, listing the actions for each possible state, or a binary decision diagram (BDD)  representation thereof.\nWhile the latter reduces the size to some extent, none of the two representations is explainable: the former due to its size, the latter due to the bit-level representation with all high-level structure lost.\nInstead, learning representations in the form of decision trees (DT)   has been recently explored to this end  [ref]3.\nDTs turn out to be usually smaller than BDD but do not drown to the bit level and are generally well known for their interpretability and explainability due to their simple structure.\nHowever, despite showing significant potential, the state-of-the-art tool dtControl  uses predicates without natural interpretation, and moreover, the best size reductions are achieved using determinization, i.e. making the controller less permissive, which negatively affects performance . Consider the cruise control model of , where we want to control the speed of our car so that it never crashes into the car in front while, as a secondary performance objective, keeping the distance between the two cars small. A safe controller for the this model as returned by Uppaal Stratego, is a lookup table of size 418 MB with 300,000 lines.\nThe respective BDD has 1,448 nodes with all information bit-blasted.\nUsing adaptations of standard DT-construction algorithms, as implemented in dtControl, we can get a DT with 987 nodes, which is still too large to be explained.\nUsing determinization techniques, the controller can be compressed to 3 nodes!\nHowever, then the DT allows only to decelerate until the minimum velocity.\nThis is safe, as we cannot crash into the car in front, but it does not even attempt at getting close to the front car, and thus has a very bad performance. One can find a strategy with optimal performance, retaining the maximal permissiveness, not determinizing at all, which can be represented by a DT with 11 nodes.\nA picture of this DT as well as reasoning how to derive the predicates from the kinematic equations is in Appendix 0.A. However, exactly because the predicates are based on the domain knowledge, namely the kinematic equations, they take the form of algebraic predicates and not simply linear predicates, which are the only ones in dtControl and commonly in the machine-learning literature on DTs.  △△\\triangle This motivating example shows that using domain knowledge and algebraic predicates, available now in dtControl 2.0, one can get smaller representation than when using existing heuristics.\nFurther, it improves the performance of the DT, and it is easily explainable, as it is based on domain knowledge.\nIn fact, the discussed controller is so explainable that it allowed us to find a bug in the original model.\nIn general, using dtControl 2.0 a domain expert can try to compress the controller, thus gain more insight and validate that it is correct.\nAnother example of this has been reported from the use of dtControl in the manufacturing domain . While automatic synthesis of good predicates from the domain knowledge may seem as distant as automatic synthesis of program invariants or automatic theorem provers, we adopt the philosophy of those domains and offer semi-automatic techniques. Additionally, if not performance but only safety of a controller is relevant, we can still benefit from determinization without drawbacks.\nTo this end, we also provide a new determinization procedure that generalizes the extremely successful MaxFreq technique of  and is as good or better on all our examples. To incorporate the changes just discussed, namely algebraic predicates, semi-automatic approach, and better determinization, we have also reworked the tool and its interfaces. To begin with, the software architecture of dtControl 2.0 is now very modular and allows for easy further modifications, as well as adding support for new synthesis tools.\nIn fact, we have already added parsers for the tools STORM  and PRISM , and thus we support probabilistic models as well. Since these models also contain categorical (or enumeration-type) variables, e.g. protocol states, we have also added support for categorical predicates. Furthermore, we added a graphical user interface that not only is easier to use than the command-line interface, but also allows to inspect the DT, modify and retrain parts of it, and simulate runs of the model under its control, further increasing the possibilities to explain the DT and validate the controller. Summing up, the main improvements of dtControl 2.0 over the previous version  are the following: Support of algebraic predicates and categorical predicates Semi-automatic interface and GUI with several interactive modes New determinization procedure Interfaces for model checkers PRISM and Storm and experimental evidence of improvements on probabilistic models compared to BDD The paper is structured as follows.\nAfter recalling necessary background in Section 2, we give an overview of the improvements over the previous version of the tool from the global perspective in Section 3.\nWe detail on the algorithmic contribution in Sections 4 (predicate domains), 5 (predicate selection) and 6 (determinization).\nSection 7 provides experimental evaluation and Section 8 concludes.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: in practice.\nFirstly, controllers should be explainable.\nOnly then can they be understood, trusted and implemented by the engineers, certified by the authorities, or used in the debugging process [ref]10.\nSecondly, they should be small in size and efficient to run.\nOnly then they can be deployed on embedded devices with limited memory of a few kilobytes, while the automatically synthesized\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
