      "content": "Paper Title: Downlink Power Allocation in Massive MIMO via Deep Learning: Adversarial Attacks and Training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn   [ref]45, it has been shown that augmenting the training dataset with adversarial examples increases the robustness of DNNs to adversarial examples. In computer vision applications, much prior work has attempted adversarial training as a defense method against adversarial examples on classifier datasets such as MNIST , CIFAR10 , and ImageNet. Furthermore, in , the authors devised a regularization based defensive method against the adversarial attacks in a regression setting by inducing stability in learned functions. This method was proposed by considering the possibility that the adversarial perturbation could be caused due to instability in learned functions and the experiments were conducted on the regression datasets obtained from the UCI Machine Learning repository. The authors of  and [ref]30 obtained a significant improvement of robustness against adversarial examples generated by the FGSM and the PGDM-based approaches, respectively. Different from the previous works, we investigate adversarial training as a defensive technique for a regression problem in the context of a wireless application. We can define the adversarial training as an approach in which the model learns to minimize the worst-case\nloss within the given perturbation magnitude ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon. Mathematically, this can be formulated as an optimization problem  given by where ℒ​(𝜽,𝐱adv,𝝆j)ℒ𝜽subscript𝐱advsubscript𝝆𝑗{\\cal{L}}({\\boldsymbol{\\theta}},{\\bf{x}}_{\\text{adv}},{\\boldsymbol{\\rho}}_{j}) is the adversarial loss function (7) with adversarial examples 𝐱adv=𝐱+𝜼subscript𝐱adv𝐱𝜼{\\bf{x}}_{\\text{adv}}={\\bf{x}}+{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}} as the input, 𝝆jsubscript𝝆𝑗{\\boldsymbol{\\rho}}_{j} as the original (ground-truth) output of cell j𝑗j, and 𝜽𝜽{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} as the model f​(⋅)𝑓⋅f(\\cdot) parameters. The worst-case loss is constrained within L∞subscript𝐿L_{\\infty}-norm bounded perturbations of magnitude ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon. In (16), the objective of inner maximization is to determine the adversarial examples that is solved by the proposed adversarial attack methods in this paper such as FGSM or PGDM or MI-FGSM.\nThe objective of the outer minimization is to minimize the loss function by applying the standard training procedure.\nAlthough, the adversarial training have been extensively investigated on classification-based applications such as in computer vision and natural language processing, it is overlooked for wireless system based applications. In wireless systems, we encounter both classification-based (e.g., modulation classification [ref]11    )\nand regression-based (e.g., power allocation ) applications. In this paper, we consider the adversarial training on a more complex problem of a regression setting that is\nDNN based power allocation in a multicell massive MIMO network against adversarial attacks. Goodfellow et al.  proposed FGSM-based adversarial training to improve the robustness of a DNN by training it with both clean samples and adversarial samples crafted using FGSM. The experiments in  suggested that the DNN was robust to FGSM-crafted adversarial examples, i.e., with adversarial training, the error rate on adversarial examples significantly reduced. However, the model was found to be still vulnerable to multi-step iterative-variants of adversarial attacks. In our work, we benchmark the proposed L∞subscript𝐿L_{\\infty}-norm adversarial attacks (FGSM, PGDM, and MI-FGSM) and found that PGDM is the strongest attack having a high probability in fooling the DNN. Therefore, in our work, we consider the adversarial training with L∞subscript𝐿L_{\\infty}-norm PGDM-crafted adversarial examples. It has also been shown in the literature that PGDM attack as a universal ‘first-order L∞subscript𝐿L_{\\infty} adversary’  and the robustness against such a first-order adversary guarantees security across other first-order L∞subscript𝐿L_{\\infty}-norm attacks namely FGSM  and Carlini and Wagner  method. This was shown by training the DNNs on the classification datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR10. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work discussing adversarial training for creating robust DNN-based model for wireless systems.\nThe proposed procedure for cell-based adversarial training with L∞subscript𝐿L_{\\infty}-norm PGDM-based adversarial examples against DNN-based power allocation in a massive MIMO system is as follows: Train a DNN model fstd​(⋅)subscript𝑓std⋅f_{\\text{std}}(\\cdot) on the training dataset 𝐱∈𝒳𝐱𝒳{\\bf{x}}\\in{\\cal{X}} and 𝝆j∈𝒫subscript𝝆𝑗𝒫{\\boldsymbol{\\rho}}_{j}\\in{\\cal{P}} for each cell j𝑗j, where j=1,…,L𝑗1…𝐿j=1,\\ldots,L. We refer to this as standard\ntraining since the input to the DNN is the original clean UEs positions and the output is the optimal power coefficients of UEs that are obtained using traditional optimization techniques. Generate adversarial examples using model fstd​(⋅)subscript𝑓std⋅f_{\\text{std}}(\\cdot) for each {𝐱​(n),𝝆j​(n)}𝐱𝑛subscript𝝆𝑗𝑛\\{{\\bf{x}}(n),{\\boldsymbol{\\rho}}_{j}(n)\\}, n=1,…,N1𝑛1…subscript𝑁1n=1,\\ldots,N_{1} and j=1,…,L𝑗1…𝐿j=1,\\ldots,L, with the proposed L∞subscript𝐿L_{\\infty}-norm PGDM-based adversarial attack in Algorithm 222.\nThe generated adversarial examples dataset is denoted by {𝐱adv​(n),𝝆j​(n)}subscript𝐱adv𝑛subscript𝝆𝑗𝑛\\{{\\bf{x}}_{\\text{adv}}(n),{\\boldsymbol{\\rho}}_{j}(n)\\}. Train a DNN model fadv​(⋅)subscript𝑓adv⋅f_{\\text{adv}}(\\cdot) on the adversarial dataset 𝐱adv∈𝒳subscript𝐱adv𝒳{\\bf{x}}_{\\text{adv}}\\in{\\cal{X}} and 𝝆j∈𝒫subscript𝝆𝑗𝒫{\\boldsymbol{\\rho}}_{j}\\in{\\cal{P}} for each cell j𝑗j. We refer to this as adversarial training since the input to the DNN is the adversarial perturbed UEs positions and the output is the ground-truth power coefficients of UEs. In , it has been shown that overfitting for adversarial training could result in degraded performance for the test dataset. This implies that unlike in the standard training, overfitting in adversarially training of DNN has the property of increasing the robust test loss. Therefore, we employ validation-based early stopping which terminates learning after the validation loss of the adversarial validation dataset does not decrease for the specified number of epochs. In the final step, we consider the test dataset 𝐱tsubscript𝐱t{\\bf{x}}_{\\text{t}} (clean samples) different from the adversarial training and adversarial validation datasets to evaluate the robustness of the adversarially trained model fadv​(⋅)subscript𝑓adv⋅f_{\\text{adv}}(\\cdot) against the FGSM, PGDM, MI-FGSM, and random perturbation based attacks.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: In   [ref]45, it has been shown that augmenting the training dataset with adversarial examples increases the robustness of DNNs to adversarial examples.
