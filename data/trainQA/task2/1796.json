The goal itself would be too daunting if no constraint is imposed on the architecture differences. Just like general transfer learning, it is natural to hypothesize that two architectures must share some similarity so that their winning tickets may transfer: we stick to this assumption in this preliminary study. We focus our initial agenda on network architectures from the same design family (e.g., a series of models via repeating or expanding certain building blocks) but of different depths. For a winning ticket found on one network, we propose various strategies to “stretch” it into a winner ticket for a deeper network of the same family, or “squeeze” it for a shallower network. We then compare their performance with tickets directly found on those deeper or shallower networks. We conduct extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 with models from the ResNet and VGG families, and further extend to ImageNet. Our results seem to suggest an affirmative answer to our question in this specific setting. We formalize our observations by articulating the Elastic Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (E-LTH): by mindfully replicating (or dropping) and re-ordering layers for one network, its corresponding winning ticket could be stretched (or squeezed) into a subnetwork for another deeper (or shallower) network from the same family, whose performance is nearly the same as the latter’s winning ticket directly found by IMP. Those stretched or squeezed winning tickets largely outperform the sparse subnetworks found by pruning-at-initialization approaches [ref]27, and show competitive efficiency to state-of-the-art dynamic sparse training [ref]11. We also provide intuitive explanations for the preliminary success. Lastly, we stress that our method has a pilot-study nature, and is not assumption-free. The assumption that different architectures come from one design “family” might look restrictive. However, we point out many state-of-the-art deep models are designed in “families”, such as ResNets , MobileNets , EfficientNets , and Transformers . Hence, we see practicality in the current results, and we are also ready to extend them to more general notions - which we discuss in Section 5.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: the same as the latter’s winning ticket directly found by IMP.
