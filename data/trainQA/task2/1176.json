Further miniaturization can enhance the computing performance only marginally\nbut increases the issues due to approaching the limiting interaction speed, as discussed below. It is accepted that logical gates have an\noperating time, and to compensate for the different number of gates\non different paths, functionally not needed (such as invert-reinvert)\ngates are inserted on the path with fewer gates. The design comprises several clock domains, and some bigger parts of the design run with different synchronization.\nThese solutions can more or less compensate for the evident time difference.\nHowever, on one side,\ncomputing systems ”have a clock signal which is distributed in a tree-like fashion into every tiny part of the chip…Approximately 30 % of the total consumption of a modern microprocessor is solely used for the clock signal distribution.” \nIt was the case 10 years ago, so for today, we can assume 50% (and about the same amount of power is needed for cooling).\nOn the other side, the difference in the length of physical signal paths\ncauses a ”skew” of the signals, which became a major challenge\nin designing high-performance systems. It leads to additional performance loss (mainly due to the dispersion of the clock signal needed to synchronize the computing operations [ref]33).\nEven inside the die: the segregated processors have very low efficiency . Despite this, today, wafer (and even multi-wafer ) sized systems are also under design and in use. In complete systems, such as supercomputers running\nHPCG workload, only 0.3 % of the consumed energy goes for\ncomputing, and this proportion is getting much worse if\nconventional systems attempt to mimic biology, such as to run an ANN\nworkload.\nThe poor understanding of basic terms of computing resulted in that\nin supercomputing ”the top 10 systems [of TOP500] are unchanged from the previous list” , and that\n”Core progress in AI has stalled in some quite different fields” ; from brain simulation  to ANNs [ref]38; in general, the\nAI progress  as a whole.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: a major challenge\nin designing high-performance systems. It leads to additional performance loss (mainly due to the dispersion of the clock signal needed to synchronize the computing operations [ref]33).\nEven inside the die: the segregated processors have very low efficiency .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
