Weather elements forecasting can be cast into sequence prediction problem and hence it is closely linked to Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN) models such as Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) [ref]26. In addition due to the presence of spatial structure of the weather data, it is also linked to convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Therefore, recent years have witnessed the emergence of powerful deep learning architectures based on LSTM, CNN, and UNet for addressing challenging tasks in weather elements forecasting. For instance, the authors in  proposed the Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) model that better captures the underlying spatiotemporal correlations of the data and consistently outperforms normal LSTM. Continuing in the ConvLSTM research direction, the authors in [ref]28 proposed Convcast, an embedded convolutional LSTM-based architecture. The author in  introduced different CNN architectures including 1-D, 2-D and 3-D convolutions to accurately predict wind speed in the next 6 to 12 hours. The UNet architecture is used for precipitation nowcasting in . The SmaAt-UNet model, an extension of UNet model, which greatly reduces the UNet parameters without compromising its performance is introduced in . The authors in , introduced Broad-UNet by equipping the UNet model with asymmetric parallel convolutions as well as Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module. Despite its many advantages, UNet can still result in limited abilities when modeling long-range dependencies due to the intrinsic locality of the convolution based operations. On the other hand, Transformer model, which is initially developed for sequence-to-sequence prediction and uses the global self-attention mechanisms , has also limitations in localization abilities due to insufficient low-level details [ref]23. Subsequently, the authors in [ref]23 proposed TransUNet model that has the best of two UNet and Transformer models and they showed its successful application in medical image segmentation tasks. In this paper, we use TransUNet as the core model and extend it by incorporating Convolutional Block Attention Modules (CBAM) and employing the Depthwise-separable Convolutions (DSC) in the core model. CBAM is a lightweight and general attention module for feed-forward Convolutional Neural Networks. Given an intermediate feature map, CBAM infers attention maps in two dimensions (channel attention module and spatial attention module) sequentially . Depthwise (DW) convolution and Pointwise (PW) convolution are collectively called Depthwise-separable Convolution. This structure is similar to regular convolution operations and can be used to extract features, although its parameter sizes are substantially smaller than standard convolution operations .\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: among others.
