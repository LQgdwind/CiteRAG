      "content": "Paper Title: MTCAE-DFER: Multi-Task Cascaded Autoencoder for Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) is a crucial technology in human-computer interaction and affective computing, building on the foundations of Static Facial Expression Recognition (SFER) and further advancing its development. In SFER technology, most recognition models are static, serial, and context-free, such as DeepEmotion , FER-VT [ref]2, and PAtt-Lite . The preliminary stages of DFER development, many researchers used SFER techniques to perform frame-level processing of video stream data, but these methods often failed to meet the real-time and temporal correlations of human-computer interaction applications. Therefore, the feasibility of three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3DCNN) was considered, with examples like C3D , I3D , and SlowFast . However, these networks require significant computational power and still unable to meet real-time. With the emergence of sequence models such as RNN , GRU , and LSTM , combining convolutional neural network with recurrent neural network has become a common trend. For example, models like ResNet18 + LSTM 0 and C3D + LSTM 1 have been developed to construct DFER system. Moreover, since the introduction of the TimeSformer 2 architecture, it is known for strengthening spatiotemporal contextual relevance, while more suitable for dynamic data. Examples include Former-DFER 3, STT-DFER 4, LOGO-Former 5, and MAE-DFER 6. However, since this architecture emphasizes the effectiveness of global feature extraction, it tends to overlook the key task-specific features. In other words, most current DFER models focus on global feature extraction and inference but lack attention to local feature and global-local interaction feature. This can lead to the model paying too much attention to broad features during the learning process, while ignoring the local features for the specific task. To address the challenges mentioned above, although models like LOGO-Former 5 and MAE-DFER 6 have made some improvements, they still lack advanced technologies to further alleviate these shortcomings. Inspired by MTFormer 7 and MNC 8, we propose the multi-task cascaded learning approach to enhance the model robustness and the effectiveness of global-local feature interaction in DFER. As shown in Fig. 1, (a) is Autoencoder-Based Single-Task Learning (STL) network, where the Video Masked Autoencoder (VideoMAE) 9 encoder is obtained by self-supervised learning. It uses the Masked Autoencoder (MAE)  method, but this network structure has weak generalization ability. (b) is Autoencoder-Based Non-Fully Shared Multi-Task Learning (MTL) network. The VideoMAE 9 encoder is shared, while non-shared task-specific decoders are designed for different tasks, improving the modelâ€™s overall generalization ability through multiple tasks. (c) is Autoencoder-Based Fully Shared MTL network. It has a shared encoder-decoder pair and the task-specific decoder for each task, enhancing global feature interaction. (d) is Autoencoder-Based Multi-Task Cascaded Learning network. It employs the shared VideoMAE 9 encoder to obtain global representation information, and then uses the cascaded network to enable feature interaction across tasks, achieving global-local feature interaction of related tasks. Combined with the aforementioned solutions, our purpose is to explore the impact of dynamic face detection and dynamic face landmark on DFER within the MTL framework, as well as the effectiveness of global-local feature interaction between related face tasks in the cascaded network. Therefore, we will propose a new framework of Multi-Task Cascaded Autoencoders for Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition, named MTCAE-DFER. The contributions of this work are as follows: We build a multi-task cascaded autoencoder framework for DFER, extending the MTL branch based on the Transformer [ref]21. Furthermore, this framework can better play the parallel, dynamic and contextual of the DFER model, especially in human-computer interaction system, reducing the space-time complexity. We develop a plug-and-play cascaded decoder. To enable feature interaction between related tasks, the decoder is designed using the Transformer [ref]21 decoder concept and the Vision Transformer (ViT)  architecture to facilitate global-local feature interaction between cascaded tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on three public dynamic facial expression datasets (RAVDESS , CREMA-D , MEAD ) to verify the competitiveness of MTCAE-DFER. Through ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the generalization ability of the MTCAE-DFER model in DFER task and the effectiveness of global-local feature interaction between related tasks will be demonstrated.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: of Static Facial Expression Recognition (SFER) and further advancing its development.
