      "content": "Paper Title: Interpretable Visual Reasoning via Induced Symbolic Space\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur OCCAM network is shown in Figure 2 with phase 1 path.\nIt performs MAC-style reasoning, but over the object-level visual features generated by our proposed object-level feature extractor (Figure 3).\nFed with an image, the extractor produces a set of vectors v‚Äãsùë£ùë†vs, each encodes a single object‚Äôs unary visual features and its interactions with other objects. The module works as the following steps: (1) Following , we use Mask-RCNN [ref]13 to detect all objects in an image and output the bounding boxes for them.\nThe image is fed to a ResNet34 network  pretrained on ImageNet  to generate the feature maps. (2) On top of the ResNet34 feature maps, we apply a global average pooling to get a single global feature vector (the gray vector in the figure). We concatenate this global vector with the feature map at each location, followed by three convolution layers.\nThis global vector is crucial since it allows the visual features to encode the interaction among objects; and the three convolution layers fuse the local and global features into a single visual vector at each position.\n (3) Finally, to get object-level features from the above pixel-level fused features, we use RoI align [ref]13 to project the objects‚Äô bounding boxes onto the fused feature vectors to generate the RoI feature maps; and average pool these RoI maps for each object to produce the object-level v‚Äãsùë£ùë†vs. Our object feature extractor is jointly optimized with the reasoning module with Eqn (1) in the phase 1 training.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: a set of vectors v‚Äãsùë£ùë†vs, each encodes a single object‚Äôs unary visual features and its interactions with other objects.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
