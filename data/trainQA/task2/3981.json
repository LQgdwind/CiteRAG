      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Embedded Clustering with Distribution Consistency Preservation for Attributed Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep embedded clustering models gradually come into the field because they can jointly optimize node clustering and representations.\nAs a pioneer, the DEC method [ref]4 trains an autoencoder to learn representation vectors and defines a clustering loss based on them to obtain clusters. It provides a way to learn node representations and cluster assignments simultaneously with a shared encoder.\nIDEC  further extends the DEC method [ref]4 to integrate the reconstruction loss of AE and the clustering loss of DEC into a unified objective, training the model in an end-to-end framework.\nSubsequently, a number of approaches for deep spectral clustering and deep subspace clustering inspired by them also begin to emerge [ref]6 [ref]32 . However, the above methods cannot be used to process attributed networks directly since they ignore the link structures of data. To solve this limitation, a few methods which inherit the advantages of GCN-based models have been designed and used for DEC tasks for attributed networks. For example,\nDAEGC  employs GAT network  as the encoder to rank the importance of attributed nodes within a neighborhood and learn node representations.\nIt is able to supervise the process of clustering to get clusters in the means of self-training for attributed networks.  extends the encoder of DAEGC to GCN to further aggregate the neighbor information of nodes in the network.\nNEC  introduces a relaxed soft modularity that can be optimized with the reconstruction loss of GAE. Furthermore, it combines them with the KL divergence based clustering loss, thus improving cluster assignments and feature representations in a self-learning manner.\nThe model proposed in  incorporates a joint clustering model into the graph encoder. It fuses relaxed KùêæK-means and spectral clustering to get clusters, and the adjacency is shared by both GAE and joint clustering.\nBesides, SDCN  first combines GCN and DNN autoencoder with a delivery operator and then designs a dual self-supervised mechanism for clustering to get the final cluster assignments through joint training. However, it directly projects the representation vectors of GCN into cluster distributions by a subsequent GCN layer without the real clustering process, thus may lead to poor clustering performance.\nBased on SDCN, DFCN in  fuses two representation vectors learned from IGAE on an attributed graph and AE on node attributes, then applies triplet self-supervised clustering on the learned vectors to preserve the cluster structures in the embedding space. What‚Äôs more, after the learning process of DFCN, KùêæK-means clustering is used again on the final fused representation vectors to get the cluster assignments.\n combines a variational graph autoencoder for network embedding with a self-training mechanism into a unified framework, enabling the better clustering of networks.\nRecently, O2MAC  extends DEC models to multi-view attributed networks. It consists of one encoder and multiple decoders to learn the shared representations. Furthermore, a self-training clustering objective is also designed to optimize node embeddings and clusters simultaneously. In this study, we concentrate on this branch of research and intend to design a more powerful one-stage end-to-end model to learn node representations effectively and efficiently for the task of node clustering.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Deep embedded clustering models gradually come into the field because they can jointly optimize node clustering and representations.\nAs a pioneer, the DEC method [ref]4 trains an autoencoder to learn representation vectors and defines a clustering loss based on them to obtain clusters.
