      "content": "Paper Title: Exponentially Faster Shortest Paths in the Congested Clique\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this work we break the natural logarithmic barrier for distance computation in the Congested Clique model. We present missingp​o​l​y​(log⁡log⁡n)missing𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑦𝑛\\mathop{\\mathrm{missing}}{poly}(\\log\\log n) round approximation algorithms for the fundamental problems of MSSP and APSP. Our first contribution is the first sub-logarithmic algorithm for computing distances from up to O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(\\sqrt{n}) sources.333The statements in this section are slightly simpler and assume that ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon is constant just to simplify the presentation. The exact statements appear in Section 4. For every n𝑛n-vertex unweighted undirected graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E), a subset of O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(\\sqrt{n}) sources S⊂V𝑆𝑉S\\subset V and a constant ϵ∈(0,1)italic-ϵ01\\epsilon\\in(0,1), there is a randomized algorithm in the Congested Clique model that computes (1+ϵ)1italic-ϵ(1+\\epsilon)-approximation for the S×V𝑆𝑉S\\times V distances with high probability within O~​((log⁡log⁡n)2)~𝑂superscript𝑛2\\widetilde{O}((\\log\\log n)^{2}) rounds.444The term O~​(x)~𝑂𝑥\\widetilde{O}(x) hides factors that are poly-logarithmic in x𝑥x. We remark that even for computing (1+ϵ)1italic-ϵ(1+\\epsilon)-approximate distances from a single source, the fastest previous algorithms require poly-logarithmic time [ref]3 [ref]2.\nSimilarly to [ref]3, the barrier of handling at most O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(\\sqrt{n}) sources is rooted at the sparse matrix multiplication algorithm of [ref]3 .\nThe latter takes O​(1)𝑂1O(1) time as long as the density of the matrices is O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(\\sqrt{n}), for higher values the complexity is polynomial. Our next contribution is providing a (2+ϵ)2italic-ϵ(2+\\epsilon)-approximation for unweighted APSP in missingp​o​l​y​(log⁡log⁡n)missing𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑦𝑛\\mathop{\\mathrm{missing}}{poly}(\\log\\log n) time, improving upon the previous missingp​o​l​y​(log⁡n)missing𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑦𝑛\\mathop{\\mathrm{missing}}{poly}(\\log{n}) algorithm [ref]3. For every n𝑛n-vertex unweighted undirected graph G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E), and constant ϵ∈(0,1)italic-ϵ01\\epsilon\\in(0,1), there is a randomized algorithm in the Congested Clique model that computes (2+ϵ)2italic-ϵ(2+\\epsilon)-approximation for APSP w.h.p within O~​((log⁡log⁡n)2)~𝑂superscript𝑛2\\widetilde{O}((\\log\\log n)^{2}) rounds. It is worth noting that a (2+ϵ)2italic-ϵ(2+\\epsilon)-approximation is essentially the best we can hope for without improving the complexity of matrix multiplication in the Congested Clique model.\nAs noted in [ref]3, a reduction to matrix multiplication that appears in [ref]9  implies that one cannot compute a (2−ϵ)2italic-ϵ(2-\\epsilon) approximate APSP in sub-polynomial time, without obtaining sub-polynomial algorithms for matrix multiplication. Finally, we provide missingp​o​l​y​(log⁡log⁡n)missing𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑦𝑛\\mathop{\\mathrm{missing}}{poly}(\\log\\log n)-round algorithm for the (1+ϵ,β)1italic-ϵ𝛽(1+\\epsilon,\\beta)-approximation for APSP for β=O​(log⁡log⁡nϵ)log⁡log⁡n𝛽𝑂superscript𝑛italic-ϵ𝑛\\beta=O(\\frac{\\log{\\log{n}}}{\\epsilon})^{\\log{\\log{n}}}. For any constant ϵ∈(0,1)italic-ϵ01\\epsilon\\in(0,1), there exists a randomized algorithm in the Congested Clique model that w.h.p. computes a (1+ϵ,β)1italic-ϵ𝛽(1+\\epsilon,\\beta)-approximation for the APSP problem in undirected unweighted graphs in O~​((log⁡log⁡n)2)~𝑂superscript𝑛2\\widetilde{O}((\\log\\log n)^{2}) rounds, for β=O​(log⁡log⁡nϵ)log⁡log⁡n𝛽𝑂superscript𝑛italic-ϵ𝑛\\beta=O(\\frac{\\log{\\log{n}}}{\\epsilon})^{\\log{\\log{n}}}. For the best of our knowledge, this is the first sub-polynomial algorithm to the problem. A polynomial algorithm can be obtained either by the\nexact algorithm for unweighted APSP that takes O​(n0.158)𝑂superscript𝑛0.158O(n^{0.158}) time , or by building a sparse near-additive spanner or emulator and letting the vertices learn it. This takes O​(nρ)𝑂superscript𝑛𝜌O(n^{\\rho}) rounds where ρ𝜌\\rho is an arbitrary small constant, using the constructions in  . We remark that these constructions work also in the more general CONGEST model, where vertices can only send Θ​(log⁡n)Θ𝑛\\Theta(\\log{n}) bit messages to their neighbours. Note that while [ref]3 shows poly-logarithmic algorithms for multiplicative (2+ϵ)2italic-ϵ(2+\\epsilon)-approximation of APSP, prior to this work there was no nearly-additive approximation in sub-polynomial time. This nearly-additive approximation yields a near-exact (1+ϵ)1italic-ϵ(1+\\epsilon)-approximation for long distances (i.e., of distance Ω​(β/ϵ)Ω𝛽italic-ϵ\\Omega(\\beta/\\epsilon)), improving upon the existing (2+ϵ)2italic-ϵ(2+\\epsilon)-approximation. The randomized constructions presented above share a similar randomized core for which we devise a new derandomization algorithm. The current deterministic constructions of spanners and hopsets are mostly based on the derandomization of the hitting set problem   . In our context, the standard hitting set based arguments lead to a logarithmic overhead in the size of the emulator, and consequently also in the number of rounds to collect it. This is clearly too costly as we aim towards sub-logarithmic bounds.\nTo handle that, we isolate the key probabilistic argument that leads to the desired sparsity of our emulators.\nBy using the strong tool of pseudorandom generators for fooling DNF formulas , and extending the approach of , we show that this probabilistic argument can hold even when supplying all vertices a shared random seed of O~​(log⁡n)~𝑂𝑛\\widetilde{O}(\\log n) bits.\nAs we believe that this derandomization scheme might be useful in other contexts, we formalize the setting by defining the soft hitting set problem that captures our refined probabilistic arguments in a black-box manner, and show the following: The soft hitting set problem can be solved in O​((log⁡log⁡n)3)𝑂superscript𝑛3O((\\log\\log n)^{3}) rounds. This leads to O~​((log⁡log⁡n)4)~𝑂superscript𝑛4\\widetilde{O}((\\log\\log n)^{4}) deterministic solutions for Thm. 3, 4 and 5.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: are poly-logarithmic in x𝑥x.
