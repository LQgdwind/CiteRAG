      "content": "Paper Title: Novel Matrix Hit and Run for Sampling Polytopes and Its GPU Implementation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRandom sampling of convex bodies is employed in disciplines such as operations research, statistics, probability, and physics. Among random-sampling approaches, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is the fastest, most accurate, and easiest to use . MCMC is often implemented using polytope sampling algorithms, which are used in volume estimation [ref]2  , convex optimization [ref]5 , contingency tables , mixed integer programming , linear programming , hard-disk modeling 0, and decision analysis 1 2 3. Sampling methods start by defining a Markov chain whose stationary distribution converges to a desired target distribution. Then they draw a predetermined number of samples. These methods have two sources of computational complexity: mixing-time, which is the number of samples needed to lose the “dependency” between each draw; and cost per iteration, which is the number of operations required to obtain a single sample. Sampling algorithms aim for efficient mixing-times, so that they can produce independent samples without dropping (also called ”burning”) too many of them, and a low cost per iteration in order to draw samples fast 4.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: approaches, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is the fastest, most accurate, and easiest to use .
