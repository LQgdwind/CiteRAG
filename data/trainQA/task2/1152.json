      "content": "Paper Title: An Adaptive Stable Space-Time FE Method for the Shallow Water Equations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe derivation of a weak formulation for the AVS-FE method can be found in \nand we omit the step-by-step\nderivation found in these for the SWE and mention key points only. The AVS-FE weak formulations are\nestablished by techniques used in mixed FE methods as well as the broken weak forms associated to\nDPG and DG methods.\nThe first step is the partition of the computational domain into finite elements, i.e., into\na FE mesh. Since we are taking a space-time approach, we first define the\nspace-time domain ΩTsubscriptΩT\\Omega_{\\text{T}}: and the partition 𝒫hsubscript𝒫ℎ\\mathcal{P}_{h} of ΩTsubscriptΩT\\Omega_{\\text{T}} into elements Kmsubscript𝐾𝑚K_{m}, is such that: Our goal is to employ classical continuous FE approximating functions as bases for the trial space,\ne.g., Lagrange or Raviart-Thomas functions. Hence, it is required to recast the\nIBVP (3) into a first order system by introducing a tensor-valued auxiliary\nvariable 𝝈𝝈\\bm{\\sigma}: Using this variable, we recast the SWE IBVP as: Hence, in the weak enforcement of (6), the required regularities of the trial\nvariables are ζ∈H1​(ΩT)𝜁superscript𝐻1subscriptΩT\\zeta\\in H^{1}(\\Omega_{\\text{T}}), 𝐮∈H1​(ΩT)2𝐮superscript𝐻1superscriptsubscriptΩT2\\mathbf{u}\\in H^{1}(\\Omega_{\\text{T}})^{2}, and 𝝈∈H​(div,Ω)𝝈𝐻divΩ\\bm{\\sigma}\\in H(\\text{{div}},\\Omega), where H1​(ΩT)superscript𝐻1subscriptΩTH^{1}(\\Omega_{\\text{T}})\nand H​(div,Ω)𝐻divΩH(\\text{{div}},\\Omega) are the classical H1superscript𝐻1H^{1} and H​(d​i​v)𝐻𝑑𝑖𝑣H(div) Hilbert spaces on ΩTsubscriptΩT\\Omega_{\\text{T}}\nand ΩΩ\\Omega, respectively. The AVS-FE weak formulation is the established by an element-wise weak enforcement\nof (6), application of Green’s identity to all spatial derivatives\nwith the exception of the convective term 𝐮⋅(∇𝐮)⋅𝐮bold-∇𝐮\\mathbf{u}\\cdot(\\bm{\\nabla}\\mathbf{u}).\nThe BCs are all enforced in a weak sense, and we incorporate the initial conditions strongly\nin the definitions of the trial space. Thus, the AVS-FE weak formulation is: where the sesquilinear form, B:U​(ΩT)×V​(𝒫h)⟶ℝ:𝐵⟶𝑈subscriptΩT𝑉subscript𝒫ℎℝB:U(\\Omega_{\\text{T}})\\times{V(\\mathcal{P}_{h})}\\longrightarrow\\mathbb{R}, and linear\nfunctional, F:V​(𝒫h)⟶ℝ:𝐹⟶𝑉subscript𝒫ℎℝF:{V(\\mathcal{P}_{h})}\\longrightarrow\\mathbb{R} are defined: and the function spaces U​(ΩT)𝑈subscriptΩTU(\\Omega_{\\text{T}}) and V​(𝒫h)𝑉subscript𝒫ℎ{V(\\mathcal{P}_{h})} are defined: where broken spaces are defined: We also define norms on these spaces,\n∥⋅∥U​(Ω):U(Ω)⟶[0,∞)\\|{\\cdot}\\|_{U(\\Omega)}:U(\\Omega)\\!\\!\\longrightarrow\\!\\![0,\\infty) and\n∥⋅∥V​(𝒫h):V(𝒫h)⟶[0,∞)\\|{\\cdot}\\|_{{V(\\mathcal{P}_{h})}}:{V(\\mathcal{P}_{h})}\\!\\!\\longrightarrow\\!\\![0,\\infty) as: Note that the norm ∥⋅∥V​(𝒫h)\\|{\\cdot}\\|_{{V(\\mathcal{P}_{h})}} is equivalent to the classical broken norm: The weak\nformulation (7) is closely related to the weak formulations of the DPG method with\nultraweak forms, differing in our choice of trial space. To simplify the analyses of the AVS-FE weak formulation, we introduce an equivalent norm on\nthe trial space,\nthe energy norm ∥⋅∥B:U(ΩT)⟶[0,∞)\\|{\\cdot}\\|_{\\text{B}}:U(\\Omega_{\\text{T}})\\longrightarrow[0,\\infty): Before proceeding to the FE discretization of the weak formulation (7), we point out\nthat the weak formulation is well posed as it satisfies\nthe inf-sup and continuity conditions in terms\nof the energy norm with an inf-sup constant of unity if we consider a linearized version of the\nSWE for simplicity. Thus, the linearized form of this formulation\nsatisfies the required conditions of the Babuška Lax-Milgram Theorem ,\nfor an in-depth discussion on broken spaces and variational forms we refer\nto .\nWe also define the optimal test functions\n(e^,𝜺^,𝐄^)∈V​(𝒫h)^𝑒^𝜺^𝐄𝑉subscript𝒫ℎ(\\hat{e},\\hat{\\bm{\\varepsilon}},\\hat{\\mathbf{E}})\\in{V(\\mathcal{P}_{h})}, for each(ζ,𝐮,𝝈)∈U​(ΩT)𝜁𝐮𝝈𝑈subscriptΩT(\\zeta,\\mathbf{u},\\bm{\\sigma})\\in U(\\Omega_{\\text{T}}) as the\nsolution of the Riesz representation problem: The Riesz representation problem is well posed with unique solutions due to the inner product in the\nleft hand side (LHS).\nSince (15) is infinite dimensional, the optimal test functions must be computed\napproximately through an FE approximation. Fortunately, since the test space is broken, the solution\ncan be performed element wise, thereby removing the need for a global solve for the optimal test\nfunctions.\nWhile the definition of the energy norm makes the analysis of AVS-FE weak formulations straightforward,\nit is not computable as it is defined through a supremum.\nThankfully, the definition of the optimal test functions through the Riesz representation problem\nensures the following norm equivalence: which is readily available for computations once (e^,𝜺^,𝐄^)^𝑒^𝜺^𝐄(\\hat{e},\\hat{\\bm{\\varepsilon}},\\hat{\\mathbf{E}}) is known,\nsee   for details on optimal test functions and proof of the norm equivalence. To establish FE approximations of (7), we make the standard FE choice of a finite\ndimensional subspace Uh​(ΩT)⊂U​(ΩT)superscript𝑈ℎsubscriptΩT𝑈subscriptΩTU^{h}(\\Omega_{\\text{T}})\\subset U(\\Omega_{\\text{T}}). Since U​(ΩT)𝑈subscriptΩTU(\\Omega_{\\text{T}}) consists of Hilbert spaces, we use\nclassical FE basis functions, e.g., C0superscript𝐶0C^{0} polynomials and/or Raviart-Thomas bases.\nHere, we make no particular choice other than using conforming approximation spaces.\nHowever, the test space is to be constructed using the DPG philosophy through discrete Riesz\nrepresentation problems.\nThus, the AVS-FE discretization of (7) is: where\nthe finite dimensional test space V∗​(𝒫h)⊂V​(𝒫h)superscript𝑉subscript𝒫ℎ𝑉subscript𝒫ℎV^{*}(\\mathcal{P}_{h})\\subset{V(\\mathcal{P}_{h})} is spanned by numerical\napproximations of the optimal test functions through the Riesz representation\nproblems (15) computed element-by-element.\nThus, discrete stability and well-posedness of a linearized version of (17)\nis ensured due to the\nDPG philosophy (see Remark 2.2).\nSince the underlying differential\noperator is nonlinear, the solution procedure for (17) must perform\nnonlinear iterations, see the work of Roberts et al.  for\na discussion on DPG method and the Navier-Stokes equations. Computing optimal test functions on-the-fly to assemble the FE system of linear algebraic equations\nis one interpretation of DPG methods. Another equivalent interpretation is\nthat of a mixed or saddle point problem in\nwhich the Riesz representation problem (15) is used to define a constraint\nto the weak form (7): The derivation of this system is based on the weak form (7), the\nRiesz representation problem (15), and the fact that the AVS-FE is a minimum\nresidual method, see [ref]32 and  for details on the\nderivation for linear and nonlinear problems, respectively.\nB′superscript𝐵′B^{\\prime} represents the Gateaux derivative of the sesquilinear form with respect to (ζ,𝐮,𝝈)𝜁𝐮𝝈(\\zeta,\\mathbf{u},\\bm{\\sigma})\nacting on the approximation of the ”error representation\nfunction” (e~,𝜺~,𝐄~)~𝑒~𝜺~𝐄(\\tilde{e},\\tilde{\\bm{\\varepsilon}},\\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}), i.e., it represents a linearization of the\nsesquilinear form.\nThe mixed problem (18) is equivalent to (17)\n(see Theorem 2.2 of Carstensen et al. ). The linearization\nprovided by the constraint equation on the Gateaux derivative B′superscript𝐵′B^{\\prime} allows us to employ existing\nnonlinear FE solvers to perform iterations that (hopefully) converge to a stationary point. The error representation function is a Riesz representer of the approximation error\n(ζ,𝐮,𝝈)−(ζh,𝐮h,𝝈h)𝜁𝐮𝝈superscript𝜁ℎsuperscript𝐮ℎsuperscript𝝈ℎ(\\zeta,\\mathbf{u},\\bm{\\sigma})-(\\zeta^{h},\\mathbf{u}^{h},\\bm{\\sigma}^{h}) through an analogue of (15)\nwhere the right hand\nside is the residual functional.\nThus, due to the norm equivalence (16) the norm of the approximate error\nrepresentation function is an a posteriori error estimate of the approximation error\nof the energy norm: This error estimate has been analyzed in  and its\nand its local restriction to an element is an error indicator: This error indicator has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems in both the DPG and\nAVS-FE methods\n     . The size of the mixed discrete system of linear algebraic equations (18)\nis larger than the linear system corresponding to (17) since we do not compute optimal test functions on the fly element-by-element.\nAn advantage of this mixed form is that its solution immediately provides an a posteriori error\nestimate as well as error indicators to be used in mesh adaptive strategies. An application of the definition of the Gateaux derivative yields the operator\nB′:U​(ΩT)×V​(𝒫h)⟶ℝ:superscript𝐵′⟶𝑈subscriptΩT𝑉subscript𝒫ℎℝB^{\\prime}:U(\\Omega_{\\text{T}})\\times{V(\\mathcal{P}_{h})}\\longrightarrow\\mathbb{R}: The discrete stability due to optimal test functions is unconditional in the ”ideal” case in which\nwe can exactly compute these functions. However, since this is not achievable in practical\ncomputations, we are forced to consider a practical implementation and consider\nan approximation of these functions .\nHence, the approximation of the optimal test functions leads to a potential loss of discrete\nstability of the approximation is not sufficiently accurate. In the DPG method, sufficient\naccuracy of the optimal test functions is guaranteed by the existence of (local) Fortin\noperators . The construction of such operators is studied in great detail in\n , and its analysis was recently further refined\nin . Generally, in DPG methods for second order PDEs, a Fortin\noperator’s existence and thus discrete stability is ensured if the local Riesz representation\nproblems are solved using polynomials of order r=p+Δ​p𝑟𝑝Δ𝑝r=p+\\Delta p, where p𝑝p is the degree of the trial\nspace discretization and Δ​p=dΔ𝑝𝑑\\Delta p=d the space dimension. However, while this enrichment degree\nensures the existence of the required Fortin operator, numerical evidence suggest that in most cases\nΔ​p=1Δ𝑝1\\Delta p=1 is typically sufficient . Alternative test\nspaces for the DPG method for singular perturbation problems are investigated\nin , even for the case of Δ​p=0Δ𝑝0\\Delta p=0.\nAnother consequence of the existence of Fortin operators is the robustness of the a posteriori\nerror estimate through the error representation function (19)\nas shown in . In the AVS-FE method, numerical evidence suggests that r=p𝑟𝑝r=p is\nsufficient   for convection-diffusion PDEs as well as extensive numerical experimentation for the SWE. Since the test functions are sought in a\ndiscontinuous polynomial space, using r=p𝑟𝑝r=p still results in a larger space than the trial as the\ndiscontinuous spaces contain additional degrees of freedom. Furthermore, in the limit h→0→ℎ0h\\rightarrow 0\nthe space V​(𝒫h)𝑉subscript𝒫ℎ{V(\\mathcal{P}_{h})} is essentially L2superscript𝐿2L^{2}, i.e, any polynomial degree above constants is inherently\nan enrichment of the test space.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: a constraint\nto the weak form (7): The derivation of this system is based on the weak form (7), the\nRiesz representation problem (15), and the fact that the AVS-FE is a minimum\nresidual method, see [ref]32 and  for details on the\nderivation for linear and nonlinear problems, respectively.\nB′superscript𝐵′B^{\\prime} represents the Gateaux derivative of the sesquilinear form with respect to\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
