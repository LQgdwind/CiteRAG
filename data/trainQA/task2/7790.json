      "content": "Paper Title: Combining Combination Properties: Minimal Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we describe how the computability of a minimal model function\ncan be determined for all the theories from\nWe start with a theory that admits all the properties. Consider the Σ_​1subscriptΣ_1\\Sigma_{\\_}{1}-theory 𝒯≥nsubscript𝒯absent𝑛\\mathcal{T}_{\\geq n} from ,\nwhose models have at least n𝑛n elements (axiomatized by ψ_≥nsubscript𝜓_𝑛\\psi_{\\_}{\\geq n}).\nIt was shown in  [ref]25 that it admits all properties, except for\nthe computability of a minimal model function, which was not studied there.\nFor S={σ_​1}𝑆subscript𝜎_1S=\\{\\sigma_{\\_}{1}\\} we can get a computable minimal model function by going over all arrangements\nof variables that occur in the formula, and taking\nthe one with the least induced equivalence classes.\nOf course, if this number is less then n𝑛n, then the model\nhas to be enlarged to have n𝑛n elements: Now, let us move to an even simpler example, with a twist: Consider the Σ_​1subscriptΣ_1\\Sigma_{\\_}{1}-theory 𝒯∞subscript𝒯\\mathcal{T}_{\\infty} from , whose models are infinite (axiomatized by {ψ_≥n:n∈ℕ∖{0}}conditional-setsubscript𝜓_𝑛𝑛ℕ0\\{\\psi_{\\_}{\\geq n}:n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\setminus\\{0\\}\\}).\nIt was shown in  [ref]25 that it is stably infinite, smooth, and convex,\nwhile not having any of the other properties (except for computability of the minimal\nmodel function, that was not considered there).\nIt is easy to prove that, for S={σ_​1}𝑆subscript𝜎_1S=\\{\\sigma_{\\_}{1}\\},\nminmod_​𝒯∞,S​(ϕ)={ℵ_​0}subscriptminmod_subscript𝒯𝑆italic-ϕsubscriptℵ_0\\textbf{minmod}_{\\_}{\\mathcal{T}_{\\infty},S}(\\phi)=\\{\\aleph_{\\_}{0}\\} is a minimal model function,\nand also constant and therefore computable. The twist is that this theory wouldn’t be considered to have a computable minimal model function by a definition that demands the theory to be stably finite, as discussed in Proposition 3.\n A class of examples without computable minimal model functions are those involving the Busy Beaver function\nς:ℕ→ℕ:𝜍→ℕℕ\\varsigma:\\mathbb{N}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{N}, such that ς​(n)𝜍𝑛\\varsigma(n) is the maximum number of 111’s a Turing machine with at most n𝑛n states can write to its tape when it halts (assuming the tape begin with only 00’s). Its most important property for our purposes is that for any computable function h:ℕ→ℕ:ℎ→ℕℕh:\\mathbb{N}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{N}, there exists n_​0∈ℕsubscript𝑛_0ℕn_{\\_}{0}\\in\\mathbb{N} such that ς​(n)≥h​(n)𝜍𝑛ℎ𝑛\\varsigma(n)\\geq h(n) for all n≥n_​0𝑛subscript𝑛_0n\\geq n_{\\_}{0}, as shown by Radó ().\nIn [ref]25 this is used to separate\nthe finite model property and stable finiteness from finite witnessability and strong finite witnessability, but it can also separate the former properties from the computability of a minimal model function. Consider the Σ_​1subscriptΣ_1\\Sigma_{\\_}{1}-theory 𝒯ςsubscript𝒯𝜍\\mathcal{T}_{\\varsigma} from [ref]25,\naxiomatized by\n{ψ_≥ς​(n+2)∨⋁_i=2n+2​ψ_=ς​(i):n∈ℕ}conditional-setsubscript𝜓_𝜍𝑛2subscript_𝑖superscript2𝑛2subscript𝜓_𝜍𝑖𝑛ℕ\\{\\psi_{\\_}{\\geq\\varsigma(n+2)}\\vee\\bigvee_{\\_}{i=2}^{n+2}\\psi_{\\_}{=\\varsigma(i)}:n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}.\nA finite interpretation 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} is a 𝒯ςsubscript𝒯𝜍\\mathcal{T}_{\\varsigma}-interpretation if and only if |σ_​1𝒜|=ς​(n)subscript𝜎_superscript1𝒜𝜍𝑛|\\sigma_{\\_}{1}^{\\mathcal{A}}|=\\varsigma(n) for some n∈ℕ∖{0}𝑛ℕ0n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\setminus\\{0\\}; and all infinite interpretations are 𝒯ςsubscript𝒯𝜍\\mathcal{T}_{\\varsigma}-interpretations.\nFrom [ref]25, we know that it is stably infinite, not smooth, convex, has the finite model property and is stably finite, without being neither finitely witnessable nor strongly finitely witnessable.\nIt is then possible to show that 𝒯ςsubscript𝒯𝜍\\mathcal{T}_{\\varsigma} does not have a computable minimal model function: indeed, suppose that it does. We can then define an auxiliary function h:ℕ→ℕ:ℎ→ℕℕh:\\mathbb{N}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{N} by making h​(0)=ς​(0)=0ℎ0𝜍00h(0)=\\varsigma(0)=0, h​(1)=ς​(1)=1ℎ1𝜍11h(1)=\\varsigma(1)=1, and, for n∈ℕ∖{0}𝑛ℕ0n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\setminus\\{0\\},\nh​(n+1)=mℎ𝑛1𝑚h(n+1)=m for m∈minmod_​𝒯ς,{σ_​1}(≠(x1,…,xh​(n)+1))𝑚subscriptminmod_subscript𝒯𝜍annotatedsubscript𝜎_1absentsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥ℎ𝑛1m\\in\\textbf{minmod}_{\\_}{\\mathcal{T}_{\\varsigma},\\{\\sigma_{\\_}{1}\\}}(\\neq(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{h(n)+1})) (for x_​isubscript𝑥_𝑖x_{\\_}{i} of sort σ_​1subscript𝜎_1\\sigma_{\\_}{1}).\nWe then know that h​(n+1)ℎ𝑛1h(n+1) equals the cardinality of a 𝒯ςsubscript𝒯𝜍\\mathcal{T}_{\\varsigma}-interpretation with at least h​(n)+1ℎ𝑛1h(n)+1 elements, and thus we prove by induction that h​(n)≥ς​(n)ℎ𝑛𝜍𝑛h(n)\\geq\\varsigma(n) for all n∈ℕ𝑛ℕn\\in\\mathbb{N}. This leads to a contradiction, as hℎh is computable from its definition,\nbut is not eventually bounded by ς𝜍\\varsigma. The process of proving computability (or non-computability) of\nthe other theories from  [ref]25 is done in\na similar manner to the above examples.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: the Σ_​1subscriptΣ_1\\Sigma_{\\_}{1}-theory 𝒯≥nsubscript𝒯absent𝑛\\mathcal{T}_{\\geq n} from ,\nwhose models have at least n𝑛n elements (axiomatized by ψ_≥nsubscript𝜓_𝑛\\psi_{\\_}{\\geq n}).\nIt was shown in  [ref]25 that it admits all properties, except for\nthe computability of a minimal model function, which was not studied there.\nFor S={σ_​1}𝑆subscript𝜎_1S=\\{\\sigma_{\\_}{1}\\} we can get a computable\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
