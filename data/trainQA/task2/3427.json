      "content": "Paper Title: Graph Self-supervised Learning with Accurate Discrepancy Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA graph, consisting of nodes and edges, is a data structure that defines a relationship among objects.\nRecently, graph neural networks (GNNs)¬†7 [ref]9  , which aim to represent this structure with neural networks, have achieved great successes in modeling real-world graphs such as social networks¬†, knowledge graphs¬†, biological networks¬†, and molecular graphs¬†. However, it is extremely costly and time-consuming to annotate every label of the graphs. For example, labeling the properties of molecular graphs requires time-consuming laboratory experiments¬†2. Recently, various self-supervised learning methods for GNNs¬†2 1 3  have been studied to overcome this issue of the lack of labeled graph data. The existing self-supervised learning methods can be classified into two categories: predictive learning and contrastive learning. Predictive learning methods¬†2  6 aim to learn representations by predicting contexts of a graph (Figure¬†1, (a-1)). However, predictive learning schemes are limited as they consider only the subgraphical semantics.\nContrastive learning¬†   2  , which is a popular self-supervised learning approach in the computer vision field¬†   0, can learn the global semantics by maximizing the similarity between instances (images) perturbed by semantic-invariant perturbations (e.g. color jittering or flipping). Graph contrastive learning methods also use a similar strategy, generating positive examples with edge perturbation, attribute masking, and subgraph sampling, and then maximizing the similarity between two differently perturbed graphs from the original graph (See Figure¬†1, (b-1)). However, is it always correct to assume that the perturbed graphs by such perturbations will preserve the semantics of the original graph? In computer vision, there exists a set of well-defined perturbations, that does not change the human perception of the given image. However, in contrast to images that reside in a continuous domain, graphs are discrete data structures by nature, and thus their properties could become completely different even with slight perturbations. For example, two molecules in Figure¬†1 (d) and (e) show that, although they have a highly correlated structure, one molecular graph could be actively bound to a set of inhibitors of human Œ≤ùõΩ\\beta-secretase 1¬†, whereas the other is not. In this case, existing contrastive learning with perturbations may lead the representations for two semantically dissimilar graphs to collapse into the one representation (See Figure¬†1 (b-2)). To tackle this problem, we propose a novel self-supervised learning method which aims to learn the discrepancy between graphs, which we refer to as Discrepancy-based Self-supervised LeArning¬†(D-SLA). Specifically, we first perturb the given graph similarly as with contrastive learning schemes, but instead of maximizing the similarities across the perturbed graphs as done with contrastive learning, we aim to learn their discrepancies. To this end, we first introduce a discriminator which learns to discriminate real graphs from the perturbed ones (See Discriminator in Figure¬†1, (c-1)). This allows the model to learn small differences that may largely impact the global property of the graph, as illustrated by the example in Figure¬†1 (d) and (e). However, simply knowing that two graphs are different is insufficient, and we would want to learn the exact amount of discrepancy between them. Notably, with our perturbation scheme, the exact discrepancy can be trivially obtained since the graph edit distance¬† is automatically derived as the number of edges we perturb for a given graph. Then, we enforce the embedding-level difference between original and perturbed graphs to be proportional to the graph edit distance (See dotted circles in Figure¬†1 (c-1)). Finally, to discriminate the original and perturbed graphs from the completely different graphs, we enforce the relative distance of the latter to be larger than the former, by a large margin (See blue arrows in Figure¬†1, (c-1)). This will enable our D-SLA to capture both small and large topological differences (See Figure¬†1 (c-2)). Thus, our framework can enjoy the best of both worlds for graph self-supervised learning: predictive and contrastive learning. The experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms baselines, especially on the datasets where graphs with different properties have highly correlated structures, demonstrating the effectiveness of ours. Our main contributions are as follows: We propose a novel graph self-supervised learning framework with a completely opposite objective from contrastive learning, which aims to learn to differentiate a graph and its perturbed ones using a discriminator, as even slight perturbations could lead to completely different properties for graphs. Utilizing the graph edit distance that is obtained for perturbed graphs at no cost, we propose a novel objective to preserve the exact amount of discrepancy between graphs in the representation space. We validate our D-SLA by pre-training and fine-tuning it on various benchmarks of chemical, biology, and social domains, on which it significantly outperforms baselines.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: A graph, consisting of nodes and edges, is a data structure that defines a relationship among objects.\nRecently, graph neural networks (GNNs)¬†7 [ref]9  , which aim to represent this structure with neural networks, have achieved great successes in modeling real-world graphs such as social networks¬†, knowledge graphs¬†, biological networks¬†,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
