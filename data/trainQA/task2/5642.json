      "content": "Paper Title: Travel Demand Forecasting: A Fair AI Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are three possible ways to achieve the aforementioned fairness, i.e., correcting the unfairness. First, pre-processing the data (e.g., resampling or reweighting) and remove bias before training the models (e.g.,  7). Second, in-processing: modifying the algorithms such as including fairness penalty in the loss function   or incorporating constraints . Third, post-processing: correcting unfairness by adjusting the learned algorithms  . In this study, we selected the in-processing techniques due to their transparency (i.e., directly taking fairness into model optimization) and strong capabilities in achieving fairness even when confronted with biased data 8 and the effectiveness in mitigating bias amplification problems (i.e., the trained models amplify the biases in the training data) . In-processing methods involve two categories: implicit method and explicit method [ref]46. Implicit methods debias the models by implicitly removing bias from the latent representations. They usually hypothesize that if the latent representations are less biased, the predictions produced from the representations could also be less biased. The implicit methods are commonly used in adversarial learning [ref]56  , contrastive learning 9, etc. However, these methods (1) are usually less transparent since we can hardly interpret how the produced latent representations mitigate (or even remove) the unfairness   and (2) usually come with specific model architectures . Explicit methods focus on explicitly modifying the objective function while keeping the model structure intact, for example, adding fairness-related regularization terms or constraints. Therefore, the explicit methods usually afford greater flexibility and can be applied to a wide range of models. Existing explicit methods include absolute correlation regularization term , pairwise fairness loss , equal means 6, etc. This study adopts the explicit method by integrating a fairness-related regularization term into the loss function to jointly account for accuracy and fairness. Achieving multi-attribute fairness has long been an enduring challenge in using in-processing techniques to mitigate unfairness [ref]46. To date, most of the existing literature purely focused on correcting the unfairness of a single protected attribute  [ref]56  . However, mitigating the unfairness of one attribute may increase the unfairness of another attribute . This unexpected outcome may confuse the end-users (e.g., travel demand modelers) and thus hinder the adoption of the fairness-aware models. To tackle this issue, Yan and Howe  proposed to explicitly correct the unfairness of multiple attributes by simply adding multiple regularization terms (one for each attribute with a corresponding weight) into the loss function. However, when the protected attributes are correlated with each other (which is the case for most travel demand forecasting problems), it could be challenging to determine the appropriate weight for each protected attribute in order to achieve the optimal solution that minimizes the unfairness for the combination of the selected protected attributes. Other related methods include learning fair graph embeddings via adversarial learning 0, disentangled representation learning , adding fairness constraints for each protected attribute and achieve fairness via constrained optimization  . However, as we discussed, these methods are often less transparent and come with specific model architectures, which hinder their adaptability. As of now, there is a pressing need to develop transparent, effective and flexible methods that can simultaneously account for fairness for multiple protected attributes and can be applied to any model class.\n\nReference markers found: [46]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]46: in mitigating bias amplification problems (i.e., the trained models amplify the biases in the training data) .
