      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to Scale Multilingual Representations for Vision-Language Tasks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTransformer  based representation learning models have become increasingly popular since the release of BERT [ref]13. BERT transfers surprisingly well to other languages, despite having no multilingual training data or explicit multilingual loss . However, 3 demonstrates that there is an unequal transfer between different language pairs, notably those with typological differences to English. Both BERT and M-BERT, its multilingual extension, have been shown to be dependent on the number of parameters in the model, which reaches 110M parameters for the smaller base model . Thus, as also shown in [ref]1, a large number of additional parameters is needed to counter the performance degradation caused by training with many languages. Using the better performing large BERT model is impractical for many vision-language tasks as it contains 340M parameters, leaving little room in many GPUs memory for anything else. Along with language-only BERT variants, a burst of multimodal BERT-like models have been designed specifically for vision-language tasks    . More traditional word embedding models have also been designed for multimodal tasks with the use of either visual-word co-occurrence frequencies , multi-task training , or both , and require significantly less training data to reach similar performance. While these efforts evaluate on many multimodal tasks such as Visual Question Answering , Visual Commonsense Reasoning , Phrase Grounding 4, and more, they only train and evaluate on a single language. Recently, several multilingual methods have shown better performance on vision-language tasks than complicated transformer-based methods. LIWE  is a light-weight character embedding model that can represent many languages with few model parameters. LIWE uses a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (GRU)  to aggregate 24-D character embeddings for a text query that is encouraged to closely embed semantically similar images and sentences in other languages. Although LIWE represents a single language well, it suffers from significant performance loss when co-training on multiple languages as shown in Figure 1(b). Gella et al.  learns how to relate an image to language-specific representations and also constrain semantically similar sentences across languages to embed nearby each other. MULE  learns a universal language embedding so that it can use a single language branch in the multimodal model, significantly reducing the number of parameters required to represent each language compared to Gella et al. In addition, MULE combined the same cross-lingual constraints used in both Gella et al. and LIWE with an adversarial language classifier to further encourage alignment across languages. This results in a model that slightly improves performance as more languages are added as shown Figure 1(b). However, MULE learns a word-level embedding that requires significantly more parameters than LIWE (approximately 8x more with ten languages), and thus capacity concerns remain when scaling to many languages.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: Transformer  based representation learning models have become increasingly popular since the release of BERT [ref]13.
