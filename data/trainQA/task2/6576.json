For each input pair (F​a​c​e​C​r​o​p,B​o​d​y​C​r​o​p)𝐹𝑎𝑐𝑒𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑝𝐵𝑜𝑑𝑦𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑝(FaceCrop,BodyCrop) of size 224 × 224, we independently apply the original VOLO[ref]42 patch embedding module, which tokenizes the crops into image patches of size 8 × 8. Two representations are then fed into a feature enhancer module for cross-view feature fusion, which is achieved using cross-attention. The module is illustrated in Fig. 4, block 2. Once the features are enriched with additional information, we perform a simple concatenation, followed by a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that creates a new fused joint representation and reduces the dimensionality of the features. This feature fusion allows us to pay attention to important features from both inputs and disregard less significant ones. Additionally, it handles scenarios where one of the inputs is empty, ensuring meaningful information is extracted even from a single view. The fused features are then processed using the VOLO two-stage architecture[ref]42, which involves a stack of Outlookers, tokens downsampling, a sequence of transformers, and two heads on top. The last two linear layers update the class embedding into a 3-dimensional vector: two output values for gender and one for the normalized age value. Unlike , which uses multiple heads for separate age and gender predictions, MiVOLO produces a single vector for each image containing both outputs. We use combination of two losses for training: WeightedMSE loss function for age prediction with weights from LDS BinaryCrossEntropy loss function for gender prediction As demonstrated in Table 2, multi-task learning enables us to achieve improvements in both tasks. Moreover, early feature fusion allows us to maintain almost the same high performance as that of the original VOLO (see 4.3).\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: Our model is depicted in Figure 4.
