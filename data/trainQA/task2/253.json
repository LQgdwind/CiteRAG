      "content": "Paper Title: No-Regret Learning Dynamics for Extensive-Form Correlated Equilibrium\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe Nash equilibrium (NE)  is the most common notion of rationality in game theory, and its computation in two-player, zero-sum games has been the flagship computational challenge in the area at the interplay between computer science and game theory (see, e.g., the landmark results in heads-up no-limit poker by Brown and Sandholm  and Moravčík et al. [ref]34).\nThe assumption underpinning NE is that the interaction among players is fully decentralized.\nTherefore, an NE is a distribution on the uncorrelated strategy space (i.e., a product of independent distributions, one per player).\nA competing notion of rationality is the correlated equilibrium (CE) proposed by Aumann [ref]2.\nA correlated strategy is a general distribution over joint action profiles and it is customarily modeled via a trusted external mediator that draws an action profile from this distribution, and privately recommends to each player her component.\nA correlated strategy is a CE if no player has an incentive to choose an action different from the mediator’s recommendation, because, assuming that all other players also obey, the suggested strategy is the best in expectation. Many real-world strategic interactions involve more than two players with arbitrary (i.e., general-sum) utilities.\nIn these settings, the notion of NE presents some weaknesses which render the CE a natural solution concept: (i) computing an NE is an intractable problem, being PPAD-complete even in two-player games [ref]9 ; (ii) the NE is prone to equilibrium selection issues; and (iii) the social welfare that can be attained via an NE may be significantly lower than what can be achieved via a CE  .\nMoreover, in normal-form games, the notion of CE arises from simple learning dynamics in senses that NE does not  . The notion of extensive-form correlated equilibrium (EFCE) by von Stengel and Forges 0 is a natural extension of the CE to the case of sequential strategic interactions.\nIn an EFCE, the mediator draws, before the beginning of the sequential interaction, a recommended action for each of the possible decision points (i.e., information sets) that players may encounter in the game, but she does not immediately reveal recommendations to each player.\nInstead, the mediator incrementally reveals relevant individual moves as players reach new information sets.\nAt any decision point, the acting player is free to defect from the recommended action, but doing so comes at the cost of future recommendations, which are no longer issued if the player deviates.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: computational challenge in the area at the interplay between computer science and game theory (see, e.g., the landmark results in heads-up no-limit poker by Brown and Sandholm  and Moravčík et al.
