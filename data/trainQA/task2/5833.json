      "content": "Paper Title: MindDiffuser: Controlled Image Reconstruction from Human Brain Activity with Semantic and Structural Diffusion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBuilding upon the pioneering work of Haxby  and other researchers, a multitude of neural decoding tasks with significant guiding implications have surfaced in recent decades. These tasks can be categorized into stimuli classification[ref]11, stimuli recognition, and stimuli reconstruction based on their decoding objectives. Among them, stimuli reconstruction is the most alluring and demanding, and we focus on this area in the study. Previous image reconstruction techniques utilized linear regression models to fit fMRI with manually defined image features[ref]19. These approaches predominantly concentrated on extracting pre-established low-level characteristics from image stimuli, such as local image structures or raster filter features. The outcomes obtained from these reconstruction methods were blurry, and the features relied heavily on manual configuration.\nWith the advent of deep learning, the use of DNNs in this domain has become more prevalent. Shen et al. continuously optimized the latent space of the generation model to ensure that the DNN features of the generated images are comparable to the decoding features. Beliy et al. and Gaziv et al. employed semi-supervised learning to train an Encoder-Decoder structure to reconstruct images, solving the problem of fMRI-stimulus pairs deficiency. However, the reconstructions of these models only match the original images in terms of their outlines and postures, and do not possess distinguishable semantic information.\nDu et al. introduced a multi-view reconstruction model that accounts for the statistical correlation between fMRI signals and the corresponding stimuli. The model employs Bayesian inference to achieve precise reconstruction outcomes. Du et al.[ref]25 proposed a hierarchical neural decoding framework that leverages structural information and visual features from brain activity. This framework enhances the quality of partial natural images and face stimuli reconstructions through the use of a DNN and a matrix variable Gaussian priori, employing multi-task transfer learning. Previous researches have mainly focused on reconstructing specific types of stimuli, such as faces or handwritten digits. With the advancement of image generation models and the availability of more adequate brain imaging data, it is now becoming feasible to reconstruct complex natural images. Chen et al. pre-trained fMRI data using a method similar to MAE, and fine-tuned the LDM using the extracted characterizations from the 2D fMRI structure to obtain reconstructed images.\nOzcelik et al. and Gu et al. employed a self-supervised model for image instance feature extraction, followed by iterative optimization of noise and dense information using backpropagation. Subsequently, the three features were mapped from fMRI and put into an IC-GAN for image reconstruction. Since the introduction of multimodal pre-trained model CLIP, semantic information from text has been leveraged for reconstructing complex natural images. Lin et al. trained a mapping model using contrastive and adversarial learning loss to align fMRI with CLIP latent representations. The mapped fMRI was then fed into StyleGAN2 during the generation stage. Takagi et al. achieved close-to-original reconstruction results by mapping fMRI to the text feature cùëêc and image feature zùëßz of Stable Diffusion.\nThe aforementioned reconstruction models incorporate rich semantic information into the reconstruction results through the direct inclusion of text features or the extraction of features from images. However, since no additional constraints are imposed on the generator during reconstruction process, the quality of the generated image is exclusively determined by the decoded information. Consequently, the resulting reconstruction may lack precision in details such as location, size, and shape.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: of Haxby  and other researchers, a multitude of neural decoding tasks with significant guiding implications have surfaced in recent decades.
