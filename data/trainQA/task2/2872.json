      "content": "Paper Title: Utilizing Active Machine Learning for Quality Assurance: A Case Study of Virtual Car Renderings in the Automotive Industry\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nActive (machine) learning (AL) has been intensively researched over the past decades.\nIn general, AL methods can be divided into generative (e.g., [ref]40 ) and pool-based (e.g.,      [ref]30 [ref]46 ) approaches. Generative methods employ generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create informative samples which are added to the training set [ref]40 . Pool-based approaches utilize various acquisition strategies to select the most informative data instances.\nThe literature further distinguishes diversity- (e.g., core-set ) and uncertainty-based approaches, as well as combinations of both (e.g., Batch BALD  or BADGE ).\nFor our work, uncertainty-based techniques are most relevant.\nHere, the underlying assumption is that the more uncertain a model is with respect to a prediction, the more informative the associated data point has to be.\nUncertainty-based AL approaches can be further divided into ensemble-based (e.g., Deep Ensemble [ref]46 or MC-Dropout ) or non-ensemble-based (e.g., Minimal Margin , Learning Loss , or DEAL [ref]30) methods.\nGenerally, deriving uncertainty estimates via the softmax function carries the risk that a model may be uncertain in its predictions despite high softmax probabilities . Approaches addressing this drawback, e.g., generate multiple predictions per instance, which are subsequently aggregated, by using the technique of MC-Dropout  or by employing a model ensemble (Deep Ensemble [ref]46). Another approach is to add a separate loss prediction model to the network .\nWhile the first two approaches are time-consuming regarding the acquisition of new data instances, the latter requires implementing an extra model.\n In this work, we employ DEAL [ref]30 as it allows the selection of new data through uncertainty estimates generated by only one forward pass of each instance through the network. These uncertainty estimates are derived by placing a Dirichlet distribution on the class probabilities. Its parameters are set by the output of the neural network .\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: Active (machine) learning (AL) has been intensively researched over the past decades.\nIn general, AL methods can be divided into generative (e.g., [ref]40 ) and pool-based (e.g.,      [ref]30 [ref]46 ) approaches. Generative methods employ generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create informative samples which are added to the training set\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
