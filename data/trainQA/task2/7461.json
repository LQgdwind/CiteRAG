      "content": "Paper Title: Optimal Automated Market Makers: Differentiable Economics and Strong Duality\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAdams and Yellen  observed that for a monopolist selling more than one good, it may be advantageous to engage in mixed bundling, selling a bundle of multiple goods at a discounted price, while possibly also offering each good separately at an independent price.\nSurprisingly, this advantage does not require that goods be complements or substitutes; rather,\nit can happen even if the goods are completely unrelated, for example with a buyer\nwith additive values. A long line of work   2 seeks to characterize in what circumstances taking advantage of bundling is optimal.\nPavlov [ref]38, Manelli and Vincent , and\nGiannakopoulos and Koutsoupias [ref]21 all give explicit optimal solutions to particular special cases of the multiple-good monopolist problem, and show that these solutions do sometimes\ninvolve mixed bundling. Daskalakis etÂ al. [ref]13  present a general theory of strong duality, in which the optimal mechanism design problem is shown to be dual to a relaxed optimal transport problem.\nThey show that depending on the particular problem, selling separately, selling only a bundle, mixed bundling, or even offering an infinite continuum of lottery bundles could be optimal.\nKleiner and Manelli  give an equivalent formulation of the problem in terms of infinite-dimensional linear programming, and Kash and Frongillo  allow for more general constraints on allocations.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: the goods are completely unrelated, for example with a buyer\nwith additive values.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
