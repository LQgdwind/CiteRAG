      "content": "Paper Title: PAC-Bayesian Domain Adaptation Bounds for Multi-view learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFirst, the authors in  provided PAC-Bayesian bounds over the concatenation of the views, using priors that reflect how well the views agree on average over all examples, and deduced a SVM-like learning algorithm from this framework. However, this concatenation is designed for two views and kernel method, it is not generalizable to other methods. A more general framework of Pac-Bayesian bounds for multi-views was introduced in\n[ref]12. In the paper, the authors inroduced the two-level multiview approach. For each view v∈[[𝒱]]𝑣delimited-[]delimited-[]𝒱v\\in[\\![\\mathcal{V}]\\!], they consider a view-specific set ℋvsubscriptℋ𝑣\\mathcal{H}_{v} of voters h:𝒳v→Y:ℎ→superscript𝒳𝑣𝑌h:\\mathcal{X}^{v}\\rightarrow Y, and a prior distribution 𝒫vsubscript𝒫𝑣\\mathcal{P}_{v} on ℋvsubscriptℋ𝑣\\mathcal{H}_{v}. Given a hyper-prior distribution π𝜋\\pi over the views [[𝒱]]delimited-[]delimited-[]𝒱[\\![\\mathcal{V}]\\!]. In the paper, PAC-Bayesian learner objective has two parts. The first part is finding a posterior distribution 𝒬vsubscript𝒬𝑣\\mathcal{Q}_{v} over ℋv,∀v∈[[𝒱]]subscriptℋ𝑣for-all𝑣delimited-[]delimited-[]𝒱\\mathcal{H}_{v},\\forall\\;v\\in[\\![\\mathcal{V}]\\!]; The second is finding a hyper-posterior ρ𝜌\\rho distribution on the set of views [[𝒱]]delimited-[]delimited-[]𝒱[\\![\\mathcal{V}]\\!]. Thereby, [ref]12 defined the multi-view weighted majority vote ℬρMVsuperscriptsubscriptℬ𝜌MV\\mathcal{B}_{\\rho}^{\\textnormal{MV}} as: Thus, the authors propose to build a learner that intends to construct posterior and hyperposterior distributions that minimize the actual risk ℛD​(ℬρMV)subscriptℛ𝐷subscriptsuperscriptℬMV𝜌\\mathcal{R}_{D}(\\mathcal{B}^{\\textnormal{MV}}_{\\rho}) of the multiview weighted majority vote defined as: As stated in Section 2.2 the Gibbs risk is related to the expected disagreement dQ𝒳​(𝒬)subscript𝑑subscript𝑄𝒳𝒬d_{Q_{\\mathcal{X}}}(\\mathcal{Q}) and expected joint error eQ𝒳​(𝒬)subscript𝑒subscript𝑄𝒳𝒬e_{Q_{\\mathcal{X}}}(\\mathcal{Q}). Goyal et al. [ref]12 note that the stochastic Gibbs classifier GρMVsubscriptsuperscript𝐺MV𝜌G^{\\textnormal{MV}}_{\\rho} defined as follows in the multiview setting, follows the same idea and it can be rewritten in terms of expected disagreement dQMV​(ρ)subscriptsuperscript𝑑MV𝑄𝜌d^{\\textnormal{MV}}_{Q}(\\rho) and expected joint error eQMV​(ρ)subscriptsuperscript𝑒MV𝑄𝜌e^{\\textnormal{MV}}_{Q}(\\rho): As in the single-view PAC-Bayesian setting, [ref]12 note that the multiview weighted majority vote ℬρMVsubscriptsuperscriptℬMV𝜌\\mathcal{B}^{\\textnormal{MV}}_{\\rho} is closely related to the stochastic multiview Gibbs classifier GρMVsubscriptsuperscript𝐺MV𝜌G^{\\textnormal{MV}}_{\\rho}, and a generalization bound for GρMVsubscriptsuperscript𝐺MV𝜌G^{\\textnormal{MV}}_{\\rho} gives rise to a generalization bound for ℬρMVsubscriptsuperscriptℬMV𝜌\\mathcal{B}^{\\textnormal{MV}}_{\\rho}. Moreover, the authors extend the C-Bound 3 to multiview setting by Lemma 1 below (the theorem\nand it’s proof can be found in [ref]12). (Goyal et al. [ref]12).\nLet V≥2𝑉2V\\geq 2 be the number of views. For all posterior {𝒬v}v=1Vsubscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝒬𝑣𝑉𝑣1\\{\\mathcal{Q}_{v}\\}^{V}_{v=1} and hyper-posterior ρ𝜌\\rho distribution, if ℛQ​(GρMV)<12subscriptℛ𝑄subscriptsuperscript𝐺MV𝜌12\\mathcal{R}_{Q}(G^{\\textnormal{MV}}_{\\rho})<\\frac{1}{2}, then we have: The authors in the paper provide general multi-view PAC-Bayesian theorems and derive also a generalization bound with the approaches of ; ; ; and  introduce in section 2.2. 2.3 (the theorems and its proof can be found in [ref]12). The main difference between Goyal et al.’s bounds to theorems ; ; ; and  relies on the introduction of view-specific prior and posterior distributions, which mainly leads to an additional term 𝔼v∼ρ​DKL​(𝒬v∥𝒫v)subscript𝔼similar-to𝑣𝜌subscript𝐷KLconditionalsubscript𝒬𝑣subscript𝒫𝑣\\mathbb{E}_{v\\sim\\rho}\\;D_{\\textnormal{KL}}(\\mathcal{Q}_{v}\\|\\mathcal{P}_{v}), expressed as the expectation of the view-specific Kullback-Leibler divergence term over the views [[𝒱]]delimited-[]delimited-[]𝒱[\\![\\mathcal{V}]\\!] according to the hyper-posterior distribution ρ𝜌\\rho.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: However, this concatenation is designed for two views and kernel method, it is not generalizable to other methods.
