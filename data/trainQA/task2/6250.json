      "content": "Paper Title: Latent Exploration for Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn continuous control, the policy update of on-policy algorithms (e.g., REINFORCE , A3C , TRPO , PPO ) and of some off-policy algorithms (e.g., SAC [ref]5) requires the computation of log⁡π​(at|st)𝜋conditionalsubscript𝑎𝑡subscript𝑠𝑡\\log\\pi(a_{t}|s_{t}), which is the logarithm of the probability of choosing a certain action atsubscript𝑎𝑡a_{t} given the current state stsubscript𝑠𝑡s_{t}, according to the current policy π𝜋\\pi. In such cases, the policy gradient needs to be backpropagated through the density function of the action distribution. This is typically accomplished via the reparametrization trick, in which the policy network outputs the parameters of a differentiable probability density function, whose analytical expression is known, so that gradients can flow through the probability estimation. In the standard case, when we apply independent Gaussian noise to the action components, the action probability distribution can be parametrized as a multivariate Gaussian with diagonal covariance matrix (Algorithm 1). We propose that the weights of the policy network can be naturally used to parameterize the amount of exploration noise (Algorithm 2). While a generic perturbation of the policy network’s activations would lead to an action distribution with an unknown probability density function, in Lattice we limit the latent perturbation to the last layer’s latent state, which is linearly transformed into the action (Fig. 1 A). Consider the output of the last layer of the policy network 𝐱∈ℝNx𝐱superscriptℝsubscript𝑁𝑥\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N_{x}} and the matrix W∈ℝNa×Nx𝑊superscriptℝsubscript𝑁𝑎subscript𝑁𝑥W\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N_{a}\\times N_{x}}, mapping the embedding state to an action according to 𝐚=W​𝐱𝐚𝑊𝐱\\mathbf{a}=W\\mathbf{x}. We have indicated the size of the latent space with Nxsubscript𝑁𝑥N_{x} and the size of the action space with Nasubscript𝑁𝑎N_{a}. If we assume a perturbation of the latent state 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} with independent Gaussian noise ϵ=𝒩​(𝟎,Σ𝐱)bold-italic-ϵ𝒩0subscriptΣ𝐱\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}=\\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0},\\Sigma_{\\mathbf{x}}), where Σ𝐱subscriptΣ𝐱\\Sigma_{\\mathbf{x}} is a positive-definite diagonal matrix, then the perturbed latent state 𝐱~~𝐱\\mathbf{\\tilde{x}} is distributed as 𝐱~∼𝒩​(𝐱,Σ𝐱)similar-to~𝐱𝒩𝐱subscriptΣ𝐱\\mathbf{\\tilde{x}}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{x},\\Sigma_{\\mathbf{x}}). Thus, the action distribution 𝐚∼𝒩​(W​𝐱,W​Σ𝐱​W⊤+Σ𝐚)similar-to𝐚𝒩𝑊𝐱𝑊subscriptΣ𝐱superscript𝑊topsubscriptΣ𝐚\\mathbf{a}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(W\\mathbf{x},W\\Sigma_{\\mathbf{x}}W^{\\top}+\\Sigma_{\\mathbf{a}}), where with Σ𝐚subscriptΣ𝐚\\Sigma_{\\mathbf{a}} we have indicated the independent component of the action noise, can be derived as a linear transformation of a multivariate Gaussian distribution (details in Appendix A.2). This formula provides an analytical expression for log⁡π​(𝐚t|𝐬t)𝜋conditionalsubscript𝐚𝑡subscript𝐬𝑡\\log\\pi(\\mathbf{a}_{t}|\\mathbf{s}_{t}), as a function of the policy network weights and the covariance matrix of the latent state: The probability of an action depends on the network weights both through its mean value W​𝐱𝑊𝐱W\\mathbf{x} and through the perturbation variance matrices Σ𝐱subscriptΣ𝐱\\Sigma_{\\mathbf{x}} and Σ𝐚subscriptΣ𝐚\\Sigma_{\\mathbf{a}}. Depending on the RL algorithm, it might be convenient not to propagate the gradients of the policy network through the variance component of the loss. In this way, the expected action trains the policy network, while the loss due to the standard deviation can regulate its magnitude by updating the parameters Σ𝐱subscriptΣ𝐱\\Sigma_{\\mathbf{x}} and Σ𝐚subscriptΣ𝐚\\Sigma_{\\mathbf{a}}.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: In continuous control, the policy update of on-policy algorithms (e.g., REINFORCE , A3C , TRPO , PPO ) and of some off-policy algorithms (e.g., SAC [ref]5) requires the computation of log⁡π​(at|st)𝜋conditionalsubscript𝑎𝑡subscript𝑠𝑡\\log\\pi(a_{t}|s_{t}), which is the logarithm of the probability of choosing a certain action atsubscript𝑎𝑡a_{t}\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
