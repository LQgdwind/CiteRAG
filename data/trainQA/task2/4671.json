      "content": "Paper Title: Scheduling Algorithms for Federated Learning with Minimal Energy Consumption\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFederated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique used for training a shared model collaboratively while not sharing local data  [ref]2 [ref]3 .\nThis technique reduces privacy and security risks while also improving communication efficiency .\nThese features make FL attractive for applications from next-word prediction  and on-device item ranking [ref]2, to cyberattack detection [ref]3 and graph classification .\nDue to its data privacy design, FL has also received significant attention in medical applications. It has been used in brain tumor segmentation , tumor classification , and chest X-ray diagnosis for COVID-19 . In its most standard form, FL is based on the idea of a central server that coordinates the work of participating devices (mostly heterogeneous mobile or edge devices, but also local computers or Cloud instances in some application cases).\nThe server starts a training round by sending an initial model to some of the devices.\nThe devices train the model with their own local data, and send the updated model weights back to the server.\nThe latter then aggregates all updates and combines their model weights (e.g., by averaging their values) in order to start the next training round.\nThis process is repeated until a given deadline is met, a fixed number of training rounds is achieved, or until the model converges to a target accuracy. The accuracy of machine learning models (FL included) has seen improvements at the cost of larger models and exponentially-growing computational demands.\nWhen combined with an increase in usage, this is leading to an increased attention to machine learning’s economic and environmental costs 0 1.\nAn initial study 2 indicates that FL’s energy consumption can be one order of magnitude greater than an equivalent centralized model, while its carbon footprint may even be two orders of magnitude larger (mostly due to the energy sources available for people participating in training in different locations around the globe).\nEnergy is also of concern for FL due to the limited batteries of mobile devices. All of the aforementioned concerns make FL a prime target for energy consumption optimizations.\nYet, little work has been done on the subject so far 3.\nEnergy consumption is often seen as a secondary or tertiary objective after accuracy and execution time 4 5 6 7.\nAdditionally, the energy consumed during training is usually modeled in a simple manner to reduce the complexity of the optimization problems and ease the use of heuristics 8 9  7 6  . In this context, we present optimal scheduling algorithms to minimize the energy consumption of Federated Learning.\nOur algorithms define, for a target volume of training data, how much local data each device should use (while also respecting their own lower and upper data limits).\nWe show that this scheduling problem, in its general definition (without any specific assumptions of the devices’ energy behavior), is equivalent to a new knapsack problem that can be solved in pseudo-polynomial time.\nWe also present four algorithms with lower complexity for specific energy behavior scenarios where costs increase monotonically.\nAll of these algorithms have been designed for energy conservation, but they can be directly applied to minimize the carbon footprint, monetary cost, or any other cost function, weighted or not.\nWe can summarize our main contributions as follows: We provide a formulation of the minimal cost FL schedule problem with lower limits, upper limits, and arbitrary cost functions per device; We propose an optimal pseudo-polynomial solution based on the new Multiple-Choice Minimum-Cost Maximal Knapsack Packing Problem; and We present four optimal scheduling algorithms for scenarios with monotonically increasing cost functions with specific marginal cost behaviors, with or without upper limits. The remaining of this paper is organized as follows:\nSection 2 introduces related work on FL, energy, and scheduling.\nSection 3 provides a formulation of our scheduling problem.\nSection 4 presents an optimal solution to this problem based on a new knapsack problem and solution.\nSection 5 shows algorithms optimized for specific scenarios.\nSection 6 presents concluding remarks.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique used for training a shared model collaboratively while not sharing local data  [ref]2 [ref]3 .\nThis technique reduces privacy and security risks while also improving communication efficiency .\nThese features make FL attractive for applications from next-word prediction  and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
