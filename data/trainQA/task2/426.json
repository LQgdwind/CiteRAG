      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Various Length Dependence by Dual Recurrent Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecurrent neural networks (RNNs) are usually used for processing sequence-related problems as a memory model.\nThey widely appear in deep learning models to solve problems such as sequence learning , language modeling , etc.\nThese neural networks are designed to approach a dynamical system to get a complex time relationship, which can also be called as sequential dependence.\nA RNN structure has the connections between hidden units which can be described as the following , where 𝒙t∈ℝMsubscript𝒙𝑡superscriptℝ𝑀\\bm{x}_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{M} and 𝒉t∈ℝNsubscript𝒉𝑡superscriptℝ𝑁\\bm{h}_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N}, are the input and the hidden state at time t𝑡t, respectively.\n𝑾i​n∈ℝN×Msubscript𝑾𝑖𝑛superscriptℝ𝑁𝑀\\bm{W}_{in}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times{M}}, 𝑾r​e​c∈ℝN×Nsubscript𝑾𝑟𝑒𝑐superscriptℝ𝑁𝑁\\bm{W}_{rec}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times{N}}, and 𝒃∈ℝN𝒃superscriptℝ𝑁\\bm{b}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N} are the variables to be trained which are the input weight matrix, the recurrent weight matrix and the bias, respectively.\nσ𝜎\\sigma is the element-wise activation function.\nM𝑀M and N𝑁N are the dimension of the input feature and the number of hidden neurons, respectively. RNNs cannot process long-term sequences because of the gradient vanishing and exploding problems due to the improper activation function and the uncontrolled repeated multiplications of the recurrent weight matrix .\nThe existing methods proposed to solve the problem of learning long-term dependence can be roughly divided into two categories: the gated RNNs and the gate-free RNNs.\nThe first category of methods enhance the original recurrent neurons with a set of gates to preserve long-term memory,\nfor example, the famous long short-term memory (LSTM) and GRU models\n . Although the gated RNNs get notable performance and have become the popular configuration for many machine learning tasks, the generation of gates takes up considerable amount of computing resources and the forget gate also limits the learning of very long sequences while the uncontrolled recurrent weight matrix can cause gradient exploding [ref]6. The second category of methods are gate-free RNNs proposed to solve the gradient problems without using gates. While the gate-free RNNs perform better on learning the long-term dependence, less efforts have been devoted to reducing the short-term disturbances. In the study [ref]7, long-term dependence is expected to be learned by the deep layers of a multi-layer HMLSTM network while the shallow layers of it are used for the short-term dependence.\nThis rule is usually utilized unconsciously when constructing multi-layer RNN model to learn multi-scale dependence.\nHowever, simply using the same kind of LSTM cells is hard to adapt to different functional requirements.\nOn the contrary, using different models for long-term and short-term dependence may be more adaptive.\nBased on this motivation, a Dual Recurrent Neural Networks (DuRNN) is proposed in this paper.\nConsisting of two parts and a transition connection with selection mechanism between them, DuRNN progressively learns the short and long-term dependence. The first part is a conventional recurrent neural network with full connected neurons, where the singular values of the recurrent weight matrix are constrained to learn short-term memory and avoid gradient exploding. The second part consists of independent recurrent connected neurons  with numerical restriction on the recurrent weights to learn long-term dependence. The non-saturated activation function relu  is used in both parts.\nA selection mechanism is added to transfer the different dependence learned by the two parts in order to complete the divide-and-conquer strategy of learning separate dependence.\nSimilar to the macroscopic human memory generative processes, i.e., humans first have the short-term memory and then transfer it to the long-term memory 0, we are trying to adapt a divide-and-conquer strategy to learn long-term information.\nSimilar to the state-of-the-art CNN and RNN methods for generating deep models, our dual recurrent neural networks can also be considered as a layer to be stacked to form a multi-layer DuRNN for better performance. Our contributions can be summarized as follows. 1) A new framework is proposed to assist the capture of long-term dependence.\nIt uses two kinds of recurrent connections, i.e, local full recurrent connections and long-term independent recurrent connections to progressively learn the short-term and long-term dependence. 2) We propose a selection mechanism to connect these different recurrent networks such that the long-term memory can be better separated and utilized. 3) Extensive experiments are conducted on the adding problem, MNIST classification, language modeling and action recognition. The results confirm that DuRNN improves the performance in both long and short sequences.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: takes up considerable amount of computing resources and the forget gate also limits the learning of very long sequences while the uncontrolled recurrent weight matrix can cause gradient exploding [ref]6.
