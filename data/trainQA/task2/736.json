      "content": "Paper Title: Constructed emotions and superinformation: a constructor-theoretic approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhat is an emotion? This question is central to psychology and it is pervasive in scientific models of the mind and behavior. Emotions are seen as the causes, mediators, or effects of other psychological processes such as attention, memory, and perception. Even if there are unresolved\ndisagreements over the fundamental question of how an emotion is to be defined, there is general consensus about the definition of emotion in terms of responses to events that are important to the individual: in other words, they are subjective experiences based on feeling pleasure or pain.\n\nIn the following, we briefly present the most important theories and experimental results relevant to emotions, evidencing how the constructor theory of cognition can be used. Until the 60’s, the scientific approaches to emotions focused on the interplay between body’s physiological reactions and emotions, passing from a causal relation (James-Lange theory   at the end of the 19th-century), to a substantial independence (Cannon-Bard theory ), up to Schachter and Singer’s two factor theory . In the 1960s, Arnold  developed a new cognitive approach, where the first step in emotion is an appraisal of the situation ( the cognitive processes preceding the elicitation of emotion). According to Arnold, the initial appraisal starts the emotional sequence and arouse both the appropriate actions and the emotional experience itself. Thus the physiological changes, recognized as important, accompany, but do not initiate, the actions and experiences. Lazarus  followed Arnold’s approach, developing a more articulated appraisal theory, where appraisal mediates between the stimulus and the emotional response, and it is immediate and often unconscious. In contrast to the Schachter–Singer  theory of emotions, which views emotion as an outcome of the interaction between physiological arousal and cognition, Lazarus argued that the appraisal precedes cognitive labeling, simultaneously stimulating both the physiological arousal and the emotional experience itself. Several influential modern models (for example ) have preserved the original darwinian assumption that there are different kinds of emotion, each causing a distinct pattern of physiological and behavioral response. In the starkest form of such models, each kind of emotion is biologically basic, a separate, inherited, complex reflex that is hardwired at birth. Many models assume that each emotion kind is characterized by a distinctive syndrome of hormonal, muscular, and autonomic responses that are coordinated in time and correlated in intensity. However, in these last years, research has progressed from thinking about psychological phenomena as unitary faculties (entities) of the mind to thinking about them as emergent phenomena that vary with the immediate context. In fact, there is accumulating empirical evidence that is inconsistent with\nthe view that there are kinds of emotion with boundaries that are carved in nature [ref]2. This leads to what Barrett calls the emotion paradox, which evidences that\nour discrete commonsense categories of emotion, like ”anger”, ”sadness”, and ”happiness” can’t find consistent experimental support for their existence. Instead, the empirical evidence suggests that what exists in the brain and body is a simpler and more primitive element, the affect, and emotions are constructed by multiple brain networks working in tandem . The theory of constructed emotion  was proposed by Barrett to resolve such paradox. She draws an analogy between the categorisation process in emotion perception and colour perception: even if the retina registers light of different wave lengths and the spectrum of wavelengths as a continuum, yet people perceive categories of colours (red, green, yellow, blue) depending on previously acquired conceptual knowledge. The same happens with emotion: whether people categorise an episode of core affect as anger, fear, or sadness depends on acquired conceptual knowledge (emotion scripts). It is clear that the approach of theory of constructed emotion may have some points in common with a contructor-theoretic approach. In the following subsections we focus on the most important concepts of such theory of constructed emotion. An important question, considered in , is how emotions inform judgment and regulate thought.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: that vary with the immediate context.
