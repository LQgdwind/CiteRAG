      "content": "Paper Title: Mitigating Procrastination in Spatial Crowdsourcing Via Efficient Scheduling Algorithm\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn [ref]37, an interesting story of the famous economist George Akerlof is presented, which goes like this.\nDuring his visit to India for one year,\nhe had to return some of his friend‚Äôs luggage to USA. Every day Akerlof thought he would send off\nthe luggage, but he delayed one more day due to the lengthy\ntransportation process in India (he delayed as he thought that the loss of a whole day might be costly for him). This thought process of\nsending off the boxes on next day was continued for a few\nmonths before he finally managed to send the luggage. This story shows that procrastination could be a natural process, and we can build an efficient system taking procrastination into consideration. This viewpoint has been the prime motivation to write our paper. Another concept of behavioral economics is loss aversion, where the participating agents perceive loss more seriously than the equivalent profit. Some works based on this aspect (loss aversion) of behavioral economics have been done in the Mobile Crowdsourcing and Spatial Crowdsourcing scenarios. In spatial crowdsourcing, according to the agents‚Äô participating location, there are two types of regions that are marked as higher participation and sparse participation regions. The task completion rate in sparse regions is much slower than in higher participation regions. Liu et al. in their paper  have addressed this issue by proposing two incentive mechanisms based on behavioral economics that would leverage to the selection and payment for participants (agents) for sparse regions. These two mechanisms are - Incentive mechanism based on Behavioral Economics for Participant Selection (IBE-PS) and Incentive mechanism based on Behavioral Economics for Payment Decisions (IBE-PD). The basis of the first mechanism is the reference effect and the second one is the loss aversion. They have shown that these two mechanisms have effectively enhanced the participation of agents at sparse regions by which the loss of utility is diminished and the task completion rate is enhanced. In , we found another stress on behavioral economics where two problems are addressed. One is the fungibility of utility of various tasks and the other is the consistent behavioural preferences of the users (agents). According to the traditional economic theory, the utility of different tasks for agents is indistinguishable which refers to the term fungible. Mental Accounting in  first unveiled the fact that the utility of different tasks are different, i.e.,formulae-sequenceùëñùëíi.e., non-fungible and users‚Äô behavioral preferences are not consistent. Based on Mental Accounting, Deng et. al in  proposed an incentive mechanism called Mental Accounting Auction Incentive Mechanism (MAAIM). The proposed incentive mechanism is characterised by reference dependence, loss aversion, and sensitivity decline. Reference dependence and sensitivity decline have created an external reference environment and internal reference point which motivated the agents participating in the system. As a result, the utilisation of sensing platform and involvement of agents in task participation are improved. They have designed a payment mechanism based on loss aversion which also motivates the agents to collect better quality of data. Li et al. in  have proposed a scalable payment algorithm for agents based on the parameter called loss aversion. In their work, the loss aversion is introduced as a coefficient (parameter) in the utility function (for calculation of agents‚Äô utility) in order to modify the payment of agents to motivate their cooperative behaviour which leads to the enhancement of the crowdsensing platform. Apart from crowdsourcing, there are other areas where the mechanisms are proposed considering the behavioral aspects of the agents who are participating in the system. One such work is presented in . In their work, an incentive mechanism is proposed based on loss aversion called Loss Aversion Incentive Mechanism (LAIM) for Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANET). The incentive mechanisms for VANET until  are based on expected utility theory of traditional economics which assumes that participating in a system, the agents perceive the same effect by observing the same amount of gain or loss. However, the most realistic scenario would be to design mechanisms in VANET that will take the behavioral aspect of the agents where the agents perceive the profit and loss differently.\nIn , a mechanism is proposed by assuming that the nodes will have this behavioral aspect in consideration and with that they have shown, their mechanism will improve the cooperation among the participating nodes. As stated earlier, when the agents are executing the time bound jobs, it is quite realistic that they may submit the tasks as late as possible and these late submission of tasks may be problematic for task\nrequester. The problem of the task provider aggravates if the task provider is also constrained by deadline. The above review has not portrayed one very important step (often ignored), which is, the task provider is also constrained by deadline. The problem that arises, if the task provider is constrained by deadline, could be understood with the following example. Consider a faculty member announces 3 assignments to the students be submitted within 27t‚Äãhsuperscript27ùë°‚Ñé27^{th} of a month and the marks of the submitted assignments which is to be given within 30t‚Äãhsuperscript30ùë°‚Ñé30^{th} of the same month by the faculty member. In worst case, all the assignments are submitted to her on 27t‚Äãhsuperscript27ùë°‚Ñé27^{th}. Thus, the evaluation quality will be compromised as the time left for evaluation is only 333 days which is much less for evaluation in worst case scenario. So, the evaluation quality in this case is diminishing as the faculty member is getting less time to finish the stipulated work. This situation arises due to the fact that the deadline for submission of the assignments was not designed efficiently i.e., a single big deadline is given to the students to submit all the assignments. To mitigate this issue related to the deadline, a work is presented in  where they have proposed a Procrastination-aware-Scheduling algorithm (the algorithm is termed as OffPSP). This algorithm has allocated all jobs into the schedules in some sorted order based on a threshold, set for each schedule. Accordingly, this algorithm has produced a set of unbalanced schedules in terms of cost and number of jobs allocated. With these unbalanced schedules, the agent may face the same problem (will not get ample time) as stated earlier. In our paper, the issue related to this unbalancing effect on the schedules is addressed.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: In [ref]37, an interesting story of the famous economist George Akerlof is presented, which goes like this.\nDuring his visit to India for one year,\nhe had to return some of his friend‚Äôs luggage to USA.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
