Commonly, LMs aim to predict the next text element, called a token, conditioned on the previous ones [ref]30. This training approach yields generative models of language: tokens are sampled one after the other —i.e. autoregressively— based on the learned distribution.\nThe tipping point in Language Modelling research occurred with the arrival of the massively parallel Transformer architecture5222Replacing notably the slow sequential RNNs and LSTMs ., whose self-attention mechanism allowed both larger-scale training and long-range dependency modelling, and offered compelling performance.\nThe recent discovery of empirical scaling laws   –predicting test perplexity  as a power law of a model’s and dataset’s size, and correlating perplexity with downstream task performance–, spurred researchers to train large LMs (LLMs)333Large-scale models for other modalities such as images   or video , as well as multimodal models  ensued. to the 100s of billion parameters and to the trillion tokens [ref]30 , requiring massive compute and internet-scale data. Some emergent capabilities have been discussed  , reminiscent of complex systems  , such as zero- or few-shot learning  [ref]30,444I.e.when a model swiftly adapts to a novel task description, with only a few examples, without additional training. Steering LMs towards human-preferred responses solely through next-token prediction proved challenging, so additional fine-tuning approaches, such as instruct-LMs that employ instruction-following datasets  and reinforcement learning through human feedback , were devised.\nThese fine-tuned models (e.g. ChatGPT), enjoyed widespread success for general as well as specialized applications . Their versatility led recently to the emergence of LLM agents: agents whose core policy is an LLM that takes actions based on some observations to achieve certain objectives . LLM agents can make use of tools and APIs  providing them\nwith new affordances which, combined with some demonstrated LLMs’ abilities such as planning    , goal-generation  [ref]233, and long term semantic and procedural memory retrieval [ref]233, can result in more complex behaviour.\n\nReference markers found: [231]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]231: Language models (LMs) can be understood as probability distributions over sequences of text elements [ref]231 .
