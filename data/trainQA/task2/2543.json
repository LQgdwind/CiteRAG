      "content": "Paper Title: PRECODE - A Generic Model Extension to Prevent Deep Gradient Leakage\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNext, we compare PRECODE to other state of the art defense mechanisms, i.e., noisy gradients and gradient compression by pruning.\nFor noisy gradients, we add Gaussian noise with zero mean and standard deviation œÉùúé\\sigma.\nWe consider two noise levels: œÉ=10‚àí2ùúésuperscript102\\sigma=10^{-2} (NG-2) and œÉ=10‚àí3ùúésuperscript103\\sigma=10^{-3} (NG-3).\nWei et al. report Laplace noise to result in less privacy protection compared to Gaussian noise while having more negative impact on model accuracy¬†[ref]31.\nFor this reason, we did not consider Laplace noise in our experiments.\nFor gradient compression, referred to as GC in figures and tables, we prune 10%percent1010\\% of the gradient values with smallest magnitudes to zero as described in¬†. Fig.¬†12 displays exemplary reconstruction results on the CIFAR-10 dataset.\nAs can be seen for both baseline models, the training data can be recognizably reconstructed, whereas extension with PRECODE prevents successful reconstruction.\nAlso reconstructions for models using NG-3 and GC show notably reduced similarity to the original images.\nYet, for most reconstructed images basic patterns and objects are still recognizable. The metrics summarized in Table¬†2 also reflect this behaviour: both NG-3 and GC show increasing MSE and decreasing PSNR, SSIM, and ASR.\nHowever, PRECODE clearly outperforms both noisy gradients and gradient compression regarding privacy leakage prevention.\nIn addition, optimization using GC suffered from severe training instabilities that caused unacceptable performance drop.\nEven with reduced compression rates, we were not able to train models with sufficient accuracy and therefore decided to exclude GC from further experiments.\nAlmost the same observation has been made using noisy gradients with increased noise levels, i.e., œÉ=10‚àí2ùúésuperscript102\\sigma=10^{-2} (NG-2).\nNG-2 successfully prevents privacy leakage for both architectures but causes a notable drop in model accuracy.\nModerate noise levels, i.e., œÉ=10‚àí3ùúésuperscript103\\sigma=10^{-3} (NG-3), cause less drop in model performance but allowed for larger SSIM.\nFor privacy preservation that is on par with PRECODE, noise levels greater than 10‚àí2superscript10210^{-2} would be required. However, this renders models practically irrelevant due to overall bad performance.\nPRECODE on the other hand barely impacts model performance. Fig.¬†6 displays the learning curves in terms of training accuracy for the models trained on CIFAR-10 with and without defense mechanisms.\nWhereas PRECODE shows no impact on the training process, severe training instabilities and reduced model performance can be observed for the DMLP with NG and GC.\nNG-3 is the only approach that does not increase convergence time and decrease accuracy for LeNet.\nHowever, PRECODE generally provides better protection against IGA, and achieves higher accuracy and faster convergence compared to NG-2 and GC.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: and œÉ=10‚àí3ùúésuperscript103\\sigma=10^{-3} (NG-3).\nWei et al. report Laplace noise to result in less privacy protection compared to Gaussian noise while having more negative impact on model accuracy¬†[ref]31.\nFor this reason, we did not consider Laplace noise in our experiments.\nFor gradient compression, referred to as GC in figures and tables, we prune 10%percent1010\\% of the gradient values\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
