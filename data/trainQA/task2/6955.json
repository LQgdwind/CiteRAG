      "content": "Paper Title: BEVTrack: A Simple and Strong Baseline for 3D Single Object Tracking in Bird’s-Eye View\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe present a comprehensive comparison of BEVTrack with the previous state-of-the-art approaches on KITTI, namely SC3D , P2B , 3DSiamRPN , BAT , PTT , V2B [ref]35, PTTR , GLT-T , OSP2B , STNet [ref]15, M2-Track , and CXTrack [ref]11. As shown in Table I, BEVTrack surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods, with a significant improvement in average Success and Precision. Notably, our method achieves the best performance under all categories, except for Car, where transformer-based ST-Net [ref]15 with an iterative coarse-to-fine manner outperforms us by a slight margin of Success (72.1 v.s. 71.7). Besides, compared with CXTrack [ref]11, BEVTrack obtains consistent performance gains on all categories in terms of both Success and Precision metric, which demonstrates the importance of utilizing spatial information. We also visualize the tracking results on four KITTI categories for qualitative comparisons. As shown in Fig. 4, BEVTrack generates more robust and accurate tracking predictions. For a more comprehensive evaluation of effectiveness in challenging scenarios, we present results from various methods in cases characterized by sparse scenarios, occlusion, and intra-class distractors. To verify the effectiveness in sparse scenarios, we follow V2B [ref]35 to select sparse scenes for evaluation according to the number of points lying in the target bounding boxes in the test set. For analysis of the impact of intra-class distractors, we pick out scenes that contain Pedestrian distractors close to the target from the KITTI test split. For the occlusion situations, we filter out scenes of occlusion scores less than one in the KITTI test set. As shown in Fig. 5, each column from left to right represents the cases of base setting, sparse scenarios, occlusion, and intra-class distractors respectively on the Pedestrian category of the KITTI dataset. Our BEVTrack exhibits superior performance across all challenging scenarios, particularly excelling in cases involving occlusion and intra-class distractors. The Siamese paradigm represented by PTTR is susceptible due to hardly distinguishing targets by appearance in point clouds, suffering from a significant performance drop. While CXTrack effectively utilizes contextual information and is designed with a refined architecture, it still relies on appearance matching resulting in degraded performance. M2-Track eschews appearance matching, explicitly modeling the motion of the target but lacking sufficient utilization of contextual and spatial information, leading to suboptimal performance. Conversely, our proposed BEVTrack models the motion of both targets and intra-class distractors using BEV features, thereby harnessing contextual and spatial information effectively. This approach results in improved target localization accuracy, particularly in challenging scenarios. We also present the visual analysis of the tracking results under different challenging scenes on KITTI. As shown in Fig. 6, BEVTrack achieves good accuracy in different cases. When there are distractors around the target, conventional approaches tend to drift towards these distractors as a consequence of excessive dependence on appearance matching or segmentation. In contrast, our approach maintains accurate tracking by modeling the motion relations of not only the target itself but also distractors. In these challenging scenarios, our method can track point cloud objects more accurately and robustly.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: We present a comprehensive comparison of BEVTrack with the previous state-of-the-art approaches on KITTI, namely SC3D , P2B , 3DSiamRPN , BAT , PTT , V2B [ref]35, PTTR , GLT-T , OSP2B , STNet [ref]15, M2-Track , and CXTrack [ref]11.
