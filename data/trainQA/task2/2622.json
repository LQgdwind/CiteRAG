      "content": "Paper Title: Information Symmetry Matters: A Modal-Alternating Propagation Network for Few-Shot Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning has become the dominant technology on computer vision tasks. However, the performance is severely limited by the amount of labeled data, which is difficult or even infeasible to be acquired due to the high annotation cost or the scarcity of rare categories. By contrast, humans can recognize a new object with only one or limited observations based on abundant prior knowledge learned before. Inspired by this, learning to recognize new classes with few samples, called Few-Shot Learning (FSL) [ref]1 [ref]2, has attracted great attention recently. One intuitive solution for FSL is to employ the experience learned from other similar tasks. Meta-learning  , also known as ‚Äúlearning to learn‚Äù, aims at learning new concepts or skills rapidly with a few training examples based on abundant prior knowledge learned from base classes. Thus, the meta-learning framework has been widely employed on FSL and achieved promising performance   . Many studies demonstrate that humans capture object concepts from not only the visual view but also the language describing the characteristics of the objects  . Thus, some FSL approaches   [ref]12  utilize auxiliary semantic information, i.e., word embeddings or attribute annotations, to enhance the feature representations and improve the performance. For example, Li e‚Äãt‚Äãa‚Äãl.ùëíùë°ùëéùëôet\\,al. [ref]12 modified the visual embeddings according to the relationship between the visual distance and the semantic similarity of different categories. Huang e‚Äãt‚Äãa‚Äãl.ùëíùë°ùëéùëôet\\,al.  employed an attribute-guided attention mechanism to augment the representations with the guidance of semantics. However, since the semantic information of query samples is unavailable, the utilization of query embeddings and the support embeddings enhanced with semantics will inevitably produce a cross-modal embedding bias, which may lead to an information asymmetry problem, as shown in Figure 1(b). To address this problem, we introduce the graph propagation model to obtain the query semantics by the completed relation information in visual modality. The graph structure  has natural advantages on modeling relationships among nodes, which is effective to propagate information from one node to another. The main idea of our method is to update the visual graph with the guidance of semantics, and then propagate the semantic graph with the information transferred from visual modality. With the alternating propagation in two modalities, the information asymmetry problem is alleviated significantly as the visual graph is rectified and the semantic graph is completed. Considering the large discrepancy across modalities, it is essential to reduce the cross-modal shift so that the information in two modalities is beneficial for each other. A common approach is to constrain the embeddings of two modalities in a shared latent space with a penalty function. For example, Schonfeld e‚Äãt‚Äãa‚Äãl.ùëíùë°ùëéùëôet\\,al.  learned shared cross-modal feature embeddings of visual and semantic modalities with a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) and aligned the embeddings with two elaborate loss functions. Tokmakov e‚Äãt‚Äãa‚Äãl.ùëíùë°ùëéùëôet\\,al.  designed a soft constraint regularization which improves the robustness of the alignments. However, directly constraining the instance embeddings is inappropriate in FSL since it is difficult to maintain a balance between extracting discriminative features and aligning cross-modal embeddings in a low-data scenario. To this end, we focus on the relations among samples and design a new guidance strategy which is flexible to reduce the cross-modal discrepancy. Specifically, we propose a Modal-Alternating Propagation Network (MAP-Net) to obtain semantic information of query samples and rectify the feature embeddings, which alleviates the information asymmetry problem in FSL. The MAP-Net constructs two graphs in two modalities, i.e., the visual graph and the semantic graph, which are propagated alternately with the guidance of each other modality. The semantic graph is incomplete since semantic embeddings of query samples are unavailable. Therefore, we transfer the relation information from visual modality to semantic modality which is essential to propagate and complete the semantic graph. After the propagation, the information asymmetries are mitigated significantly as the query semantics are generated. To reduce the cross-modal discrepancy, we propose a Relation Guidance (RG) strategy to modify the relationships in visual modality. We transfer the relation vectors with a relation transfer module which is trained with support-support pairs to obtain the rectified relationships. Our highlights are summarized in three folds: We propose a Modal-Alternating Propagation Network to propagate modal information alternately to generate the pseudo-semantics of query samples and rectify the feature embeddings, which is effective in alleviating the information asymmetry problem between support and query samples. To overcome the discrepancy between modalities and obtain the accurate relation information among different samples, we propose a Relation Guidance strategy to guide visual relationships with the relationships in semantic modality. The visual relation vectors are transferred with a relation transfer module trained with support-support pairs to represent the relationships more accurately. We conduct experiments on three benchmark datasets with attributes or text descriptions, i.e., Caltech-UCSD-Birds 200-2011, SUN Attribute Database and Oxford 102 Flower, to compare the proposed method with previous few-shot learning methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves promising performance for few-shot learning from the perspective of information symmetry.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: object with only one or limited observations based on abundant prior knowledge learned before.
