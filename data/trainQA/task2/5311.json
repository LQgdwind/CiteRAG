      "content": "Paper Title: Evaluating Glyph Design for Showing Large-Magnitude-Range Quantum Spins\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTaking into account both study results, we think an important part of the answer to\nvisualization design\nis guidance of attention.\nIt is guided to some objects or locations over others by two broad methods: feature guidance (seeing objects) and scene guidance (seeing global structures). Feature guidance refers to guidance by properties of the task-target as well as the distractors (leading to correspondence errors). These features are limited to a relatively small subset of visual dimensions: color, size, texture, orientation, shape, blur or shininess and so on.\nThese features have been broadly studied in 3D glyph design (see reviews by Healey and Enns , Borgo et al. , Lie et al. , Ropinski et al. , and McNabb and Laramee ).\nTake one more example from quantum physics simulation results, but with a different task of searching for the structural distributions in the power of 333 in Figure 11 will guide attention to either the fat cylinders (Figure 11(a)) or the bright yellow color (Figure 11(d),  11(b)) or the very dark texture (Figure 11(c)), depending on the feature-pair types. Working with quantum physicists, we have noticed that\nthe structure and content of the scene strongly constrain the\npossible location of meaningful structures, guided “scene\nguidance” constraints  . Scientific data are not random and are typically structured. Contextual and global structural influences can arise from different sources of\nvisual information. If we return to the MAX search task in\nFigure 11 again, we will note that the chunk of darker or\nlighter texture patterns and colors on these regular contour\nstructures strongly influence our quick detection. This is\na structural and physical constraint that can be utilized\neffectively by viewers. This observation coupled with the\nempirical study results may suggest an interesting future work and hypothesis: adding scene structure guidance\nwould speed up quantitative discrimination, improve the\naccuracy of comparison tasks, and reduce the perceived\ndata complexity. Another structure acting as guidance is the size itself. It was used by participants seeking to resolve the NUMEROSTIY tasks to look for the longest outside cylinders. We have showed several examples like Figure 11, our collaborator suggested that the cylinder-bases of the same size with the redundant encoding (Figure 11b) also helped locate and group glyphs belonging to the same magnitude. This observation agrees with the most recent literature that guidance-by-size in 3D must take advantage of knowledge of the layout of the scene . Though feature guidance can be preattentive and features are detected within a fraction of a second, scene guidance is probably just about as fast (though precise experiments have not been done and our Experiment II only\nmerely shows this effect). Scene ‘gist’ can be extracted from\ncomplex images after very brief exposures  [ref]48. This doesn’t mean that a viewer instantly knows, say, where the answer is located. However, with a fraction of a second’s exposure, a viewer will know enough about the spatial layout of the scene to guide his or her attention towards\nvector groups in the regions of interest.\nFor example, categorical color becomes scene features since these colorful glyphs were perceived as a whole A future direction, and also an approach to understanding the efficiency and the effectiveness of scene guidance, is to conduct an eye-tracking study to give viewers a flash-view of our spatial structures and then let the viewer see the display only in a narrow range around the point of fixation:\ndoes this brief preview guide attention and the gaze effectively?\nWork in vision and visualization   [ref]51  domain has measured and correlated performance on the glance or global structure formation. Vision science discovered long ago that seeing global scene structures in medical imaging decision making guides experts’ attention (experts always know where to look)  .\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: just about as fast (though precise experiments have not been done and our Experiment II only\nmerely shows this effect).

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
