      "content": "Paper Title: An Online Gradient-Based Caching Policy with Logarithmic Complexity and Regret Guarantees\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCaching is a fundamental building block employed in various architectures to enhance performance, from CPUs and disks to the Web. Numerous caching policies target specific contexts, exhibiting different computational complexities. These range from simple policies like Least Recently Used (LRU) or Least Frequently Used (LFU)  with constant complexity to more sophisticated ones like Greedy Dual Size (GDS)  with logarithmic complexity, up to learned caches  that necessitate a training phase for predicting the next request. All caching policies, implicitly or explicitly, target a different traffic pattern.\nFor instance, LRU favors recency, assuming requests for the same item are temporally close, while LFU performs well with stationary request patterns . Learned caches identify patterns in historical request sequences,\nand assume the same pattern will persist. In a dynamic context with continuously changing traffic patterns, none of these policies can consistently provide high performance, and it is indeed easy to design adversarial patterns that may hamper the performance of a specific traffic policy  . Some recent caching policies    6 7  have been designed to be robust to any traffic pattern, making no assumptions about the arrival process. These policies are based on the online optimization [ref]27 framework.\nThe key performance metric in this context is regret, which is the performance gap (e.g., in terms of the hit ratio) between the online policy and the optimal static cache allocation in hindsight. Online caching policies aim for sub-linear regret w.r.t. the length of the time horizon, as this guarantees that their time-average performance is asymptotically at least as good as the optimal static allocation with hindsight.\nTheir major drawback is computational complexity, indeed, most of these policies have at least 𝒪​(N)𝒪𝑁\\text{O}(N) complexity per each request, where N𝑁N is the catalog size.\nWhile theoretical guarantees may justify a complexity higher than 𝒪​(1)𝒪1\\text{O}(1), 𝒪​(N)𝒪𝑁\\text{O}(N) complexity hinders the practical adoption of these policies in real-world scenarios.\nTo the best o our knowledge only the “Follow The Perturbed Leader” policy 7 can be, in some cases, implemented with 𝒪​(log⁡N)𝒪𝑁\\text{O}(\\log N) complexity. However, in practice, this policy is a noisy version of LFU, and tends to work well only when LFU does. In this paper, we design an online caching policy based on the gradient descent approach with both 𝒪​(log⁡N)𝒪𝑁\\text{O}(\\log N) complexity and sub-linear regret. This complexity matches that of commonly used caching policies,\nmaking it suitable for real-world contexts. This breakthrough is achieved by a clever joint-design of the two steps a classic OGB policy performs upon each request:\n(i) the update of a fractional state that keeps track of target probabilities to store each item, and (ii) the update of the cache actual content, i.e., the set of items stored locally.\nKey to the reduction of the computational cost is the minimization of the number of new items retrieved upon each update (while maintaining the algorithm’s adaptivity to changes in the request pattern). Interestingly, this strategy has the added benefit of reducing network traffic to the authoritative content server. Although designed for integral caching, where items are cached in their entirety, our algorithm can be adapted to fractional caching, i.e., when the cache can store arbitrarily small fractions of every item, albeit at the cost of increased computational complexity. The low complexity of our policy allows us to evaluate the policy on traces with millions of requests and items—an accomplishment previous works could not achieve. We explore various scenarios where traditional policies do not always achieve optimal performance, demonstrating that the gradient-based policy adapts to changes in traffic patterns. In summary, our contributions are as follows: We propose the first online gradient-based caching policy that enjoys both sub-linear regret guarantees and 𝒪​(log⁡N)𝒪𝑁\\text{O}(\\log N) amortized computational complexity and can then handle typical in real-world applications. We extend this result to fractional caching, considering batches of arrivals and thus mitigating the impact of the linear complexity intrinsically associated with such case. Through experiments on different public request traces with millions of items and millions of requests, we show for the first time that the regret guarantees of online caching policies bring significant benefits in scenarios of practical interest. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide background information on gradient-based caching policies and discuss the motivation behind the work. In Section 3, we offer a high-level description of the elements composing our solution and the problems they address. Sections 4 and 5 provide detailed descriptions of the building blocks of our scheme. In Section 6, we apply our solution to a set of publicly available traces. Finally, in Sections 7 and 8, we discuss related work and conclude the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: .
