      "content": "Paper Title: Dataset Distillation Meets Provable Subset Selection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this work, we distinguish between two main panels of distillation techniques: neural tangent kernel (NTK) based methods (e.g., [ref]35), and neural network-related loss minimization techniques (e.g.,¬†[ref]55). For each of the above categories of distillation techniques, we provide a robust initializer with provable theoretical guarantees. Initialization for NTK-based distillation methods. Recent work¬†  has shown that the learning procedure of neural networks replicates the behavior of Gaussian kernel as the width of the neural network tends to infinity. In other words, one can regard the neural network as a Gaussian process. This eases the inference and analysis of the learning process and it can be used for dataset distillation¬†[ref]35. For formal recitation, the following is given. In the infinite-width limit, artificial neural networks have a Gaussian distribution described by a kernel. In other words, every neural network tends to behave like a Gaussian process from the perspective of learning ‚Äì the wider the width of the neural network, the more similar the network is to a Gaussian process. This means that the corresponding kernel (referred to in the literature by neural tangent kernel¬†) of the neural network (describes the learning process) describes a Gaussian distribution; for full details on how to compute this kernel, we refer the reader to¬†.\nWith this in mind, Question¬†(1) for NTK-based methods can be restated as follows, ‚ÄúCan we find a subset of the data such that fitting the infinite-width neural network corresponding kernel on this subset will approximate fitting the same kernel on the entire data?\". Note that such a subset is attainable (as we will see later) for the case of infinite-width models, where the associated kernel is Gaussian in nature¬†. In addition, using such a set in dataset distillation is beneficial, as the subset encapsulates the capabilities and caveats of the learning process of the model on the entire data. Initialization for neural network-related loss minimization distillation technique (NNLMDT). Recently¬†[ref]11 questioned the effect of initialization of the dataset distillation techniques¬† [ref]55 , and observed that using KùêæK-center initialization¬† of the synthetic set improves the accuracy of the learned model trained on the distilled data. With this in mind, Question¬†(1) in the case of NNLMDTs can be restated as follows, ‚ÄúCan we improve upon KùêæK-center initialization in the case of NNLMDT?\".\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: In this work, we distinguish between two main panels of distillation techniques: neural tangent kernel (NTK) based methods (e.g., [ref]35), and neural network-related loss minimization techniques (e.g.,¬†[ref]55).
