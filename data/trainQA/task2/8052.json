      "content": "Paper Title: Quasi-Monte Carlo Beyond Hardy-Krause\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLow-Discrepancy Constructions. Low-discrepancy constructions are central objects of study in QMC and other related fields.\nFor intuition, consider d=1𝑑1d=1.\nFor n𝑛n random points, the D∗​(X)=Ω​(n)superscript𝐷𝑋Ω𝑛D^{*}(X)=\\Omega(\\sqrt{n}) typically (already the sub-interval [0,1/2]012[0,1/2] will typically have n/2±Ω​(n)plus-or-minus𝑛2Ω𝑛n/2\\pm\\Omega(\\sqrt{n}) points).\nHowever here, simply choosing equally spaced points at distance 1/n1𝑛1/n, trivially satisfies that D∗​(X)=1superscript𝐷𝑋1D^{*}(X)=1. Perhaps surprisingly, analogous constructions fail badly for d=2𝑑2d=2, e.g.,\nuniformly spaced gridpoints in the square have star discrepancy Ω​(n)Ω𝑛\\Omega(\\sqrt{n}) (see Figure 1); essentially no better than random points. Remarkably, point sets with O​(log⁡n)𝑂𝑛O(\\log n) discrepancy exist based on careful and beautiful explicit constructions! One such example is the van der Corput set (see Figure 1), first discovered in 1935 [vdC35a, vdC35b]. Since then, there has been extensive work on designing such low-discrepancy sets in higher dimensions. Several ingenious and elegant constructions have been discovered, often involving deep mathematical techniques.\nSome well-known examples include Halton-Hammersley sets [Ham60, Hal60], Sobol’ sequences [Sob67], Faure sequences [Fau82], digital nets [Nie92], lattice rules [Kor59], etc. The current best known bounds are a tight Θ​(log(d−1)/2⁡n)Θsuperscript𝑑12𝑛\\Theta(\\log^{(d-1)/2}n) for the ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2}-discrepancy for corners D2∗​(X)superscriptsubscript𝐷2𝑋D_{2}^{*}(X), and a worse upper bound of O​(logd−1⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑑1𝑛O(\\log^{d-1}n) for the ℓ∞subscriptℓ\\ell_{\\infty}-discrepancy D∗​(X)superscript𝐷𝑋D^{*}(X). It remains a “great open problem” [BC87] to improve the bound on D∗​(X)superscript𝐷𝑋D^{*}(X) for d>2𝑑2d>2 (for d=2𝑑2d=2, a tight lower bound of Ω​(log⁡n)Ω𝑛\\Omega(\\log n) is known).\nSome excellent references are [Nie92, Gla04, Mat09, Owe13]. Randomized QMC methods.\nAs discussed in Section 1, approaches to use randomization with QMC to bypass the limitations of QMC methods have been explored.\nPerhaps the simplest way is to apply a (single) random shift to X𝑋X, where each point 𝐱∈X𝐱𝑋\\mathbf{x}\\in X is shifted by the same amount 𝐬𝐬\\mathbf{s} to the point 𝐱+𝐬𝐱𝐬\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{s} (modulo [ref]0 [ref]1dsuperscript01𝑑[ref]0 [ref]1^{d}). This ensures that any single point 𝐱+𝐬𝐱𝐬\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{s} is uniformly random, and it does not change the discrepancy of X𝑋X. However, the randomness here is very limited to achieve the guarantees of MC, e.g., there is no pairwise randomness. Another simple randomization method is to perturb each points of a digital net inside its corresponding square lattice cell uniformly at random (see Figure 1 (right)). This method is known as jittered sampling. While jittered sampling performs well in 1-d, such randomization destroys the benefits of QMC quickly for d≥2𝑑2d\\geq 2. Already, in 222-d the discrepancy degrades to about n1/4superscript𝑛14n^{1/4}, as a typical corner/rectangle will intersect n1/2superscript𝑛12n^{1/2} cells. For general d𝑑d, the discrepancy of jittered sampling becomes n1/2−1/2​dsuperscript𝑛1212𝑑n^{1/2-1/2d}. More sophisticated randomized QMC methods have been proposed, where explicit QMC constructions, such as digital nets, are perturbed in much more delicate ways and one considers complicated explicit distributions over these perturbed sets.\nSome well-studied\nmethods include the Cranley-Patterson rotation of lattice constructions [CP76], digital shifted nets [LL02], scrambled nets of Owen [Owe94, Owe97a, Owe97b] and their variants [Hic96, Mat98], etc. Variants of scrambled nets [Owe97a, Mat98] can also achieve the best of both QMC and MC guarantees, similar to Theorem 1.4.\nHowever, these methods suffer from the limitations of having to start with an explicit initial set of QMC points, and do not go beyond the best of both QMC and MC guarantees.\nOne exception is the work by Owen [Owe97b, Owe08], though the focus there is very different from this paper. In particular, Owen showed a better convergence rate of O​(n−3/2)𝑂superscript𝑛32O(n^{-3/2}) for scrambled nets, using a different variation measure (which can be arbitrarily larger than the Hardy-Krause variation) and additional smoothness assumptions.\nWe refer interested readers to the excellent book [Owe13] and the survey [LL02] for more details on randomized QMC methods. Transference Principle and QMC constructions.\nThe transference principle has been long known (and is often attributed to Vera Sos), see e.g., [Mat09, ABN17]. Consider the following combinatorial discrepancy problem called Tusnady’s problem. Given a set of n𝑛n (arbitrary) points in [ref]0 [ref]1dsuperscript01𝑑[ref]0 [ref]1^{d}, color them ±1plus-or-minus1\\pm 1 to minimize the discrepancy of axis-parallel boxes.\nThe transference principle says that an α​(n)𝛼𝑛\\alpha(n) bound for Tusnady’s problem, implies a placement of n𝑛n points starting with n2superscript𝑛2n^{2} random points, with continuous discrepancy O​(α​(n))𝑂𝛼𝑛O(\\alpha(n)). The reduction is algorithmic (as used in this paper). Until recently though, this connection was mostly of theoretical interest as most of the better bounds for combinatorial discrepancy problems were based on non-constructive proof techniques. In recent years there has been a lot of progress in this direction, resulting in several algorithmic approaches such as [Ban10, LM15, Rot14, ES18, BDGL18, ALS21, PV23, JRT24] that match the non-constructive bounds. Several of these are also very efficient.\nRemarkably, the best known non-constructive bound for Tusnady’s problem (and hence for star discrepancy using these methods) is O​(logd−1/2⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑑12𝑛O(\\log^{d-1/2}n) [Nik17], which almost matches the best known bound of O​(logd−1⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑑1𝑛O(\\log^{d-1}n) based on explicit constructions. The best algorithmic bound for Tusnady’s problem is O​(logd⁡n)𝑂superscript𝑑𝑛O(\\log^{d}n) [BG17, ALS21]. Finally, we mention the beautiful algorithm due to Dwivedi et al. [DFGGR19], that finds a n𝑛n-point set with discrepancy O~d​(1)subscript~𝑂𝑑1\\widetilde{O}_{d}(1) in [ref]0 [ref]1dsuperscript01𝑑[ref]0 [ref]1^{d}, using only O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) random samples.

This ensures that any single point 𝐱+𝐬𝐱𝐬\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{s} is uniformly random, and it does not change the discrepancy of X𝑋X.
