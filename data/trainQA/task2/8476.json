      "content": "Paper Title: Spatiotemporal Persistence Landscapes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor zigzag modules, we require a generalization of the rank invariant that is equivalent to the barcode, because we seek to obtain information about the persistence of features in time. In , the author defined the rank invariant for multiparameter persistence modules as the map that sends a tuple of points (a,b)(a,b), where a<ba<b, to the rank of the map M​(a<b)M(a<b). However, for zigzag modules only adjacent indices are comparable (i.e. a<ba<b or b<ab<a). The following example shows that the rank invariant in  does not contain all the information about the interval decomposition of the zigzag module. Consider the two zigzag modules indexed by {1,2,3,4,5}\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}. They both have the same rank invariant, but since M=𝕀[ref]𝟚 ⊕𝕀 M=\\ch@airxmathbbm{I}_{[ref]2 }\\oplus\\ch@airxmathbbm{I}_{ } and N=𝕀[ref]𝟚 ⊕𝕀 N=\\ch@airxmathbbm{I}_{[ref]2 }\\oplus\\ch@airxmathbbm{I}_{ }, they are not isomorphic.\n In [ref]17, the authors proposed a generalized rank invariant for modules indexed over arbitrary posets. The rank invariant is defined for so-called intervals, which are defined as follows. Let PP be a poset. We call a nonempty subset II of PP an interval of PP if for all p,q∈Ip,q\\in I and p≤r≤qp\\leq r\\leq q it holds that r∈Ir\\in I and II is connected, i.e. for all p,q∈Ip,q\\in I there is a sequence p=p1,…,pl=qp=p_{1},\\ldots,p_{l}=q of elements in II such that pip_{i} and pi+1p_{i+1} are comparable (pi≤pi+1p_{i}\\leq p_{i+1} or pi≥pi+1p_{i}\\geq p_{i+1} for all 1≤i≤l−11\\leq i\\leq l-1).\n For a persistence module M:P→𝐕𝐞𝐜M:P\\to\\mathbf{Vec} we denote by M|IM|_{I} its restriction to a subset II of PP. Furthermore, we denote by lim←M|I=(L,(πp:L→Mp)p∈I)\\underleftarrow{\\mathrm{lim}}\\;M|_{I}=(L,(\\pi_{p}:L\\to M_{p})_{p\\in I}) the limit of M|IM|_{I} and by lim→M|I=(C,(ip:Mp→C)p∈I)\\underrightarrow{\\mathrm{lim}}\\;M|_{I}=(C,(i_{p}:M_{p}\\to C)_{p\\in I}) the colimit of M|IM|_{I}. See Appendix A for the definitions of limits and colimits. Note that from the definitions of limits and colimits it follows that for every p≤qp\\leq q in II it holds that M​(p≤q)∘πp=πqM(p\\leq q)\\circ\\pi_{p}=\\pi_{q} and iq∘M​(p≤q)=ipi_{q}\\circ M(p\\leq q)=i_{p}. This implies that ip∘πp=iq∘πqi_{p}\\circ\\pi_{p}=i_{q}\\circ\\pi_{q} for all p,q∈Ip,q\\in I. This map ψM|I:=ip∘πp\\psi_{M|_{I}}:=i_{p}\\circ\\pi_{p} is called the canonical limit-to-colimit map.\n The generalized rank over an interval II of a persistence module MM is defined as rank⁡(M|I):=rank⁡(ψM|I)\\operatorname{\\mathrm{rank}}(M|_{I}):=\\operatorname{\\mathrm{rank}}(\\psi_{M|_{I}}), where ψM|I\\psi_{M|_{I}} is the canonical limit-to-colimit map ip∘πpi_{p}\\circ\\pi_{p} for any p∈Ip\\in I.\n For interval decomposable modules, the generalized rank of MM over an interval II equals the number of intervals in the direct sum decomposition of MM that contain II and hence, it is a complete invariant [ref]17.\n Let Int⁡(P)\\operatorname{Int}(P) be the set of intervals of the poset PP. The generalized rank invariant is the map When applied to oneparameter persistence modules, the generalized rank invariant coincides with the standard rank invariant. Furthermore, for zigzag modules the generalized rank over an interval II counts the number of intervals JJ in the direct sum decomposition of the zigzag module containing II. In total, the barcode and the generalized rank invariant of the zigzag module contain the same information.\n As the original rank invariant, the generalized rank invariant is order-reversing. For two intervals I⊂JI\\subset J of PP, it holds that rk⁡(I)≥rk⁡(J)\\operatorname{rk}(I)\\geq\\operatorname{rk}(J).\n By construction, the limit of M|JM|_{J} is also a cone of M|IM|_{I} and the colimit of M|JM|_{J} is a cocone of M|IM|_{I}. Hence, by the universal properties of limits and colimits there exist unique morphisms g:lim←​M|J→lim←​M|Ig:\\underleftarrow{\\mathrm{lim}}\\;M|_{J}\\to\\underleftarrow{\\mathrm{lim}}\\;M|_{I} and f:lim→​M|I→lim→​M|Jf:\\underrightarrow{\\mathrm{lim}}\\;M|_{I}\\to\\underrightarrow{\\mathrm{lim}}\\;M|_{J} such that for all a∈Ia\\in I, all z∈Maz\\in M_{a} and all y∈lim←​M|Jy\\in\\underleftarrow{\\mathrm{lim}}\\;M|_{J} it holds πaJ​(y)=πaI∘g​(y)\\pi_{a}^{J}(y)=\\pi_{a}^{I}\\circ g(y) and iaJ​(z)=f∘iaI​(z)i_{a}^{J}(z)=f\\circ i_{a}^{I}(z). Hence, for the canonical limit-to-colimit-maps ψM|I\\psi_{M|_{I}} and ψM|J\\psi_{M|_{J}} it holds and hence, ψM|J\\psi_{M|_{J}} factors through ψM|I\\psi_{M|_{I}} and so rank⁡(ψM|I)≥rank⁡(ψM|J)\\operatorname{\\mathrm{rank}}(\\psi_{M|_{I}})\\geq\\operatorname{\\mathrm{rank}}(\\psi_{M|_{J}}).\n□\\ch@irxboxempty The following proposition shows how the limit and colimit can actually be constructed for diagrams valued in 𝐕𝐞𝐜\\mathbf{Vec}. For this, we first need to establish the following notation: for p,q∈Pp,q\\in P, vp∈Mpv_{p}\\in M_{p} and vq∈Mqv_{q}\\in M_{q} we write vp∼vqv_{p}\\sim v_{q} if pp and qq are comparable and either M​(p≤q)​(vp)=vqM(p\\leq q)(v_{p})=v_{q} or M​(q≤p)​(vq)=vpM(q\\leq p)(v_{q})=v_{p}, whichever case is applicable. The following proposition appears among others in . Let M:P→𝐕𝐞𝐜M:P\\to\\mathbf{Vec} be a persistence module. Then: The limit of MM is (isomorphic to) the pair (L,(πp)p∈P)(L,(\\pi_{p})_{p\\in P}) where and for each p∈Pp\\in P, πp:L→Mp\\pi_{p}:L\\to M_{p} is the canonical projection. We call an element of LL a section of MM. The colimit of MM is (isomorphic to) the pair (C,(ip)p∈P)(C,(i_{p})_{p\\in P}) described as follows: for p∈Pp\\in P let the map jp:Mp↪⊕p∈PMpj_{p}:M_{p}\\hookrightarrow\\oplus_{p\\in P}M_{p} be the canonical injection. CC is the quotient vector space (⊕p∈PMp)/T\\mathopen{}\\mathclose{{\\left(\\oplus_{p\\in P}M_{p}}}\\right)/T, where TT is the subspace of ⊕p∈PMp\\oplus_{p\\in P}M_{p} which is generated by vectors of the form jp​(vp)−jq​(vq)j_{p}(v_{p})-j_{q}(v_{q}) for vp∼vqv_{p}\\sim v_{q} and the maps ip:Mp→Ci_{p}:M_{p}\\to C are the compositions ρ∘jp\\rho\\circ j_{p}, where ρ\\rho is the quotient map ρ:⊕p∈PMp→C\\rho:\\oplus_{p\\in P}M_{p}\\to C. A path in PP between p∈Pp\\in P and q∈Pq\\in P is a sequence of elements p=p1,…,pl=qp=p_{1},\\ldots,p_{l}=q in PP such that for all 1≤i≤l−11\\leq i\\leq l-1 the elements pip_{i} and pi+1p_{i+1} are comparable. A section along the path Γ\\Gamma is an ll-tuple v∈⊕i=1lMpiv\\in\\oplus_{i=1}^{l}M_{p_{i}} with the property that vpi∼vpi+1v_{p_{i}}\\sim v_{p_{i+1}} for all i=1,…,l−1i=1,\\ldots,l-1.\n The following proposition will be utilized in the proof of Theorem 2.4. We use the same notation as in Proposition 2.4.  For p,q∈Pp,q\\in P and vectors vp∈Mpv_{p}\\in M_{p} and vq∈Mqv_{q}\\in M_{q}, it holds that [jp​(vp)]=[jq​(vq)]∈lim→​M[j_{p}(v_{p})]=[j_{q}(v_{q})]\\in\\underrightarrow{\\mathrm{lim}}\\;M if there exists a path Γ\\Gamma between pp and qq and a section (wp)p∈Γ(w_{p})_{p\\in\\Gamma} of M along Γ\\Gamma such that wp=vpw_{p}=v_{p} and wq=vqw_{q}=v_{q}.\n It follows directly from the explicit formula for the colimit in Proposition 2.4.\n□\\ch@irxboxempty To keep notations simple, we write [vp][v_{p}] instead of [jp​(vp)][j_{p}(v_{p})] for elements in the colimit. Note that the converse of Proposition 2.4 does not hold in general. Consider for example the module Passing to the colimit, in the upper right vector space [(10)]=[(01)]\\mathopen{}\\mathclose{{\\left[{{1}\\choose{0}}}}\\right]=\\mathopen{}\\mathclose{{\\left[{{0}\\choose{1}}}}\\right] holds, because there exists a section along the closed path that identifies the two vectors, and hence [(11)]=[(00)]\\mathopen{}\\mathclose{{\\left[{{1}\\choose{1}}}}\\right]=\\mathopen{}\\mathclose{{\\left[{{0}\\choose{0}}}}\\right]. On the other hand, the vector (11){1}\\choose{1}∈𝔽22\\in\\operatorname{\\ch@airxmathbbm{F}}_{2}^{2} in the upper right vector space does not lie in the image of any of the arrows and thus, there exists no section along any path such that the above holds.\n The following definition of lower and upper fences will be useful in several places in this article. In particular, these are subsets that carry the important property that they already completely determine the limits and colimits of a diagram. A subposet L⊂PL\\subset P is called a lower fence of PP if LL is connected and for any q∈Pq\\in P the intersection L∩{r∈P:r≤q}L\\cap\\{r\\in P:r\\leq q\\} is nonempty and connected.\nAnalogously, a subposet U⊂PU\\subset P is called an upper fence of PP if UU is connected and for any q∈Pq\\in P the intersection U∩{r∈P:q≤r}U\\cap\\{r\\in P:q\\leq r\\} is nonempty and connected.\n The following Proposition already appears among others in  and will be used in the proof of the main theorem of this Section. Let LL and UU be lower and upper fences, respectively. Given any PP-indexed persistence module MM, we have that lim←​M≅lim←​M|L\\underleftarrow{\\mathrm{lim}}\\;M\\cong\\underleftarrow{\\mathrm{lim}}\\;M|_{L} and lim→​M≅lim→​M|U\\underrightarrow{\\mathrm{lim}}\\;M\\cong\\underrightarrow{\\mathrm{lim}}\\;M|_{U}.\n The isomorphisms in Proposition 2.4 are given by the canonical section extension map where for all q∈Pq\\in P, wqw_{q} is defined as M​(p≤q)​(vp)M(p\\leq q)(v_{p}) for any p∈L∩{r∈P:r≤q}p\\in L\\cap\\{r\\in P:r\\leq q\\} and by the map Note that the canonical section extension map ee is well-defined since L∩{r∈P:r≤q}L\\cap\\{r\\in P:r\\leq q\\} is a connected set. The inverse r=e−1r=e^{-1} is the canonical section restriction. Furthermore, the other isomorphism hh is well-defined because of Proposition 2.4.\nKeeping the maps that we defined in the proof of the last Proposition, we set ξ=h−1∘ψM∘e\\xi=h^{-1}\\circ\\psi_{M}\\circ e, i.e. we obtain the commutative diagram Due to the fact that ee and hh are isomorphisms we have rank⁡ξ=rank⁡ψM\\operatorname{\\mathrm{rank}}\\;\\xi=\\operatorname{\\mathrm{rank}}\\;\\psi_{M}. In total, since the limit of a diagram is isomorphic to the limit of the diagram restricted to a lower fence and analogously for the colimit and a upper fence, we can compute the generalized rank of a diagram by only calculating limits and colimits of lower and upper fences and taking the canonical map between them. \n\nFor an interval II, denote by min⁡(I)\\min(I) and max⁡(I)\\max(I) the set of minimal and maximal elements, respectively, i.e. The least upper bound and the greatest lower bound of two elements p,q∈Pp,q\\in P are denoted by p∨qp\\lor q and p∧qp\\land q, respectively.\nIn our work, we will regard persistence modules that are indexed by a subset of ℝ2\\operatorname{\\ch@airxmathbbm{R}}^{2}, which, however, do not have the usual partial order as ℝ2\\operatorname{\\ch@airxmathbbm{R}}^{2}. We will specify the partial order in the next section. We sort the elements of min⁡(I)\\min(I) and max⁡(I)\\max(I) in ascending order by their xx-coordinates and the elements of max⁡(I)\\max(I) in descending order, i.e. min⁡(I)={p0,p1,…,pk}\\min(I)=\\{p_{0},p_{1},\\ldots,p_{k}\\} and max⁡(I)={q0,q1,…,ql}\\max(I)=\\{q_{0},q_{1},\\ldots,q_{l}\\}. Then, we define the two paths Clearly, the set of elements in Γmin\\Gamma_{\\min} is a lower fence of MM and the set of elements in Γmax\\Gamma_{\\max} is an upper fence of MM. We define the path Γ∂I\\Gamma_{\\partial I} of an interval I⊂PI\\subset P as the path obtained by composing Γmin\\Gamma_{\\min}, any arbitrary path Γ′\\Gamma^{\\prime} between pkp_{k} and qlq_{l} (or p0p_{0} and q0q_{0}) and Γmax\\Gamma_{\\max}. Further, for a persistence module MM we denote by M∂IM_{\\partial I} its restriction to the path, i.e. M|Γ∂IM|_{\\Gamma_{\\partial I}}.\n The following theorem is a slight variation of Theorem 24 in  and hence, the proof differs only slightly from the proof given in . The difference between our theorem and the theorem in  is that we proved it for more general paths Γ∂I\\Gamma_{\\partial I}. The entire proof can be found in Appendix B. Let I⊂PI\\subset P be an interval. Then, rank⁡(M|I)=rank⁡(M∂I)\\operatorname{\\mathrm{rank}}(M|_{I})=\\operatorname{\\mathrm{rank}}(M_{\\partial I}).\n In other words, this theorem allows us to compute the rank over an interval by computing the rank of a zigzag module that is somehow related to the boundary of that interval. As a consequence, it is sufficient to compute ranks of zigzag modules in order to compute generalized ranks over intervals. Hence, any algorithm that computes barcodes of zigzag modules is suitable for the computation of generalized ranks.\n Note that in the proof of the last theorem we did not use the special construction of Γ∂I\\Gamma_{\\partial I} as the concatenation of Γmin\\Gamma_{\\min} and Γmax\\Gamma_{\\max}. In fact, only the properties of lower and upper fences were used. Hence, Theorem 2.4 holds for any path Γ\\Gamma that is composed of a path through a lower fence, any arbitrary path between the lower and the upper fence and a path through an upper fence.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: all the information about the interval decomposition of the zigzag module.
