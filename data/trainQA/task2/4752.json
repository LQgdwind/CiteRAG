      "content": "Paper Title: Optimizing Data Collection for Machine Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhen K=1ùêæ1K=1, the designer decides how much data to sample without controlling the type of data. We explore classification on CIFAR-10¬†, CIFAR-100¬†, and ImageNet¬†[ref]37, where we train ResNets¬† to meet a target validation accuracy.\nWe explore semantic segmentation using Deeplabv3¬†[ref]39 on BDD100K¬†[ref]40, which is a large-scale driving data set, as well as Bird‚Äôs-Eye-View (BEV) segmentation on nuScenes¬† using the ‚ÄòLift Splat‚Äô architecture¬†; for both tasks, we desire a target mean intersection-over-union (IoU).\nWe explore 2-D object detection on PASCAL VOC¬†  using SSD300¬†, where we evaluate mean average precision (mAP). When K=2ùêæ2K=2, the designer collects two types of data with different costs.\nWe first divide CIFAR-100 into two subsets containing data from the first and last 50 classes, respectively.\nHere, we assume that the first 50 classes are more expensive to collect than the last; this mimics a real-world scenario where collecting data for some classes (e.g., long-tail) is more expensive than others.\nWe then explore semi-supervised learning on BDD100K where the labeled subset of this data is more expensive than the unlabeled data; the cost difference between these two types is equal to the cost of data annotation. We use a simulation model of the deep learning workflow following the procedure of¬†Mahmood et¬†al. , to approximate the true problem while simplifying the experiments (see Appendix¬†E for full details).\nTo avoid repeatedly sampling data, re-training a model, and evaluating the score, each simulation uses a piecewise-linear approximation of a ‚Äòground truth‚Äô learning curve that returns model performance as a function of data set size.\nIn our problems, we initialize with q0=10%subscriptùëû0percent10q_{0}=10\\% of the full data set (we use 20%percent2020\\% for VOC). Then in each round, we solve for the amount of data to collect and then call the piecewise-linear learning curve to obtain the current score. We compare LOC against the conventional estimation approach of¬†Mahmood et¬†al.  who fit a regression model to the learning curve statistics, extrapolate the learning curve for larger data sets, and then solve for the minimum data requirement under this extrapolation.\nThere are many different regression models that can be used to fit learning curves¬†   . Since power laws are the most commonly studied approach in the neural scaling law literature, we focus on these.\nIn Appendix F.4, we show that our optimization approach can be incorporated with other regression models.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: When K=1ùêæ1K=1, the designer decides how much data to sample without controlling the type of data.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
