      "content": "Paper Title: Adversarial VQA: A New Benchmark for Evaluating the Robustness of VQA Models adversarialvqa.github.io\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVisual Question Answering (VQA) [ref]4 is a task where given an image and a question\nabout it, the model provides an open-ended answer. A successful VQA system can be applied to real-life scenarios such as a chatbot that assists visually impaired people. In these applications, the VQA models are expected to handle diverse question types from recognition to reasoning, and answer questions faithfully based on the evidence in the image. While model performance on the popular VQA dataset  has been advanced in recent years [ref]4      , with better visual representations  , more sophisticated model designs  , large-scale pre-training 0     and adversarial training , today’s VQA models are still far from being robust enough for practical use. There are some works studying the robustness of VQA models, such as their sensitivity to visual content manipulation [ref]1, answer distribution shift , linguistic variations in input questions 9, and reasoning capabilities [ref]13 8. However, current robust VQA benchmarks mostly suffer from three main limitations: (i𝑖i) designed with heuristic rules [ref]13  [ref]1; (i​i𝑖𝑖ii) focused on a single type of robustness 8 9 [ref]13; (i​i​i𝑖𝑖𝑖iii) based on VQA v2  images (or questions), which state-of-the-art (SOTA) VQA models are trained on [ref]13  [ref]1 8 9. The images [ref]1 or questions [ref]13  are often synthesized, not provided by human. In addition, previous data collection procedures on VQA benchmarks are often static, meaning that the data samples in these datasets do not evolve, and model performance can saturate on the fixed dataset without good generalization. For example, model accuracy on VQA v2 has been improved from 50% [ref]4 to 76%  since inception. Similarly, on robust VQA benchmarks, a recent study 8 has found that pre-trained models can greatly lift state of the art. Yet it remains unclear whether such high performance can be maintained when encountering examples in the wild. To build an organically evolving benchmark, we introduce Adversarial VQA (AVQA), a new large-scale VQA dataset dynamically collected with Human-And-Model-in-the-Loop Enabled Training (HAMLET) . AVQA is built on images from different domains, including web images from Conceptual Captions , user-generated images from Fakeddit 2, and movie images from VCR . Our data collection is iterative and can be perpetually going. We first ask human annotators to create examples that current best models cannot answer correctly (Figure 1). These newly annotated examples expose the model’s weaknesses, and are added to the training data for training a stronger model. The re-trained model is subjected to the same process, and the collection can iterate for several rounds. After each round, we train a new model and set aside a new test set. In this way, not only is the resultant dataset more challenging than existing benchmarks, but this process also yields a “moving post” target for VQA systems, rather than a static benchmark that will eventually saturate. With this new benchmark, we present a thorough quantitative evaluation on the robustness of VQA models along multiple dimensions. First, we provide the first study on the vulnerability of VQA models when under adversarial attacks by human.\nSecond, we benchmark several SOTA VQA models on the proposed dataset to reveal the fragility of VQA models. We observe a significant and universal performance drop when compared to VQA v2 and other robust VQA benchmarks, which corroborates our belief that existing VQA models are not robust enough. Meanwhile, this also demonstrates the transferability of these adversarial examples – data samples collected using one set of models are also challenging for other models. Third, as our annotators can ask different types of questions for different types of robustness, our analyses show that SOTA models suffer across various questions types, especially counting and reasoning. Our main contributions are summarized as follows. (i𝑖i) For better evaluation of VQA model robustness, we introduce a new VQA benchmark dynamically collected with a Human-and-Model-in-the-Loop procedure.\n(i​i𝑖𝑖ii) Despite rapid advances on VQA v2 and robust VQA benchmarks, the evaluation on our new dataset shows that SOTA models are far from being robust. In fact, they are extremely vulnerable when attacked by human annotators, who can succeed within 2 trials on average. (i​i​i𝑖𝑖𝑖iii) We provide a thorough analysis to share insights on the shortcomings of current models as well as comparison with other robust VQA benchmarks.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Visual Question Answering (VQA) [ref]4 is a task where given an image and a question\nabout it, the model provides an open-ended answer.
