      "content": "Paper Title: An In-depth Walkthrough on Evolution of Neural Machine Translation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers[ref]21 is google’s state of the art language modelling architecture based on the transformers model[ref]5. BERT essentially encourages the recent trends of transfer learning. The architecture is trained on bidirectional (apparently non-directional) transformer which tends to remove the benchmarks set by the recurrent models. Since the goal was to train a language model that could be modularized into the requirement by fine tuning the pretrained model, BERT essentially is a language model that introduces a novel approach called MLM (Masked LM). This involves ’masking’ 15% random words in a given sentence and using the bidirectional model to predict them. While training Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) in BERT, two inputs are fed to the model, the source sentence (current sentence) and the target sentence (next sentence). For this, the authors of [ref]21 trained with 50% of the sentences trained with wrong target sentences (i.e. a sentence which is out of context). The reason behind this being that the model should learn to be incisive in telling if the sentence belongs in the context of the given context. BERT fine tuning implies appending an use case on the pretrained language model. [ref]22,  discusses implementation of BERT at NMT. In [ref]22 a concerted training framework(CTNMT) is introduced that serves the integration of the pretrained language model with NMT. CTMT consists of 3 modules viz. asymptotic distillation to make sure that the NMT model retains the previous pretrained context; dynamic switching gate to avoid forgetting of pretrained context; strategy to adjust the learning paces according to a scheduled policy[ref]22. In asymptotic distillation, [ref]22 essentially the mean squared error between the final hidden state of the language model and the NMT model. This loss is used in conjunction with the traditional cross-entropy loss of the NMT model by a weighted average on a hyper-parameter α𝛼\\alpha. This can be summarized mathematically as: To address the problem of forgetting either the language model context or the NMT context, [ref]22 introduces dynamic switch, which involves taking a weighted average of the hidden states of the language model and NMT respectively. The mathematical representation of the final hidden state is: In addition to the aforementioned methods, the paper also introduces rate scheduled learning rate strategy to tune each component with different learning rate. The key is to first converge the NMT model and then jointly train it with the language model and moderately tune only the NMT parameters to make sure the language model data isn’t forgotten. The dataset to evaluate CTNMT used is WMT English-German translation task and also English-French, English-Chinese. CTNMT with only rate scheduling obtained a BLEU score of 29.7 on En-De dataset which outperforms the transformer (big) with almost 1 BLEU point. The same model with En-Fr and En-Zh yielded BLEU of 41.6 and 38.4 respectively. WIth CTMT and dynamic switch En-De has a BLEU score of 29.4, with En-Fr 41.6 and 38.6 with En-Zh. With Asymptotic Distillation, CTNMT gives 29.2, 41.6 and 38.3 on En-De, En-Fr, En-Zh respectively. Finally, with all the methodologies combined, BERT CTNMT gives state of the art results with BLEU scores 30.1, 42.3 and 38.9 on En-De, En-Fr and En-Zh respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers[ref]21 is google’s state of the art language modelling architecture based on the transformers model[ref]5.
