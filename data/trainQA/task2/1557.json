      "content": "Paper Title: Robust Android Malware Detection System against Adversarial Attacks using Q-Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAndroid smartphones have evolved tremendously in the last decade, and today have reached more than half of the world‚Äôs population . Annual Android smartphone sales are expected to reach 1.321.321.32 billion in 202020202020 [ref]22. The broad acceptance of Android is due to its open-source nature, robust development framework, multiple app marketplaces, large app stores, etc [ref]34. Growth of Android OS is also fueled by recent development of 4‚ÄãG4ùê∫4G and 5‚ÄãG5ùê∫5G internet technologies. Internet is currently the primary attack vector used by malware designers to attack the Android ecosystem . Malware (Malicious Software) is any software program designed and developed with an evil intent against any target  . Malware is not new to the computing environment. The first malware Creeper111https://enterprise.comodo.com/malware-description.php was a self-replicating program written by Bob Thomas in 1971 for the TENEX operating system . On the other hand, the first malware on the Android platform was a trojan named Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.FakePlayer.a222https://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/trojan_android_fakeplayer.shtml detected in August 2010 which sends SMS messages to premium-rate numbers without the user‚Äôs knowledge . A report by AV-Test suggests detection of 65.2665.2665.26 million malware on the Android ecosystem in 201120112011. Since then, there has been an exponential growth of malicious applications with a current estimate of 1049.71049.71049.7 million for 2020 [ref]5. According to GDATA antivirus report, more than 10,0001000010,000 new malicious apps are detected every day and also malware designers are uploading an infected Android app every eight seconds . ISTR by Symantec reported a 33% increase in mobile ransomware with one out of every thirty-six mobile devices had the high-risk app installed on it . The primary defence against any malware attack is provided by the anti-malware research community and the anti-virus industry (Bitdefender, Kaspersky, McAfee, Symantec, Windows Defender etc)333https://attackevals.mitre.org/. Currently, most of the anti-viruses work on the signature, heuristic and behaviour-based detection engines   [ref]34. These mechanisms are excessively human dependent, time-consuming and not scalable and thus cannot detect next-generation polymorphic/metamorphic malware  [ref]34. Recently machine learning and deep learning have shown promising results in various domains like image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems etc. Thus, the anti-malware research community have also explored malware detection using machine learning and achieved promising results  [ref]34  . Classification models based on machine learning and deep learning are susceptible to adversarial attacks. Good fellow et al. in 2015 performed an adversarial attack on an image classification model. They showed that small but intentionally worst-case perturbations could result in the classification model misclassifying the test image. Also, sometimes these misclassifications are achieved with higher confidence . Earlier, non-linearity and overfitting were used to define the robustness of classification models which is not the case today . This fact can be exploited by malware designers to perform targeted and non-targeted attacks using adversarial learning. Reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to generate intentional perturbations which can be visualized as a min-max game where a reinforcement learning agent determines a sequence of actions to maximize the return based on the reward function . Adversarial attacks are highly dependent on the attacker‚Äôs knowledge about the malware detection system. This knowledge can consist of information about the training dataset, features information, model architecture, and classification algorithm used to construct the models . If the adversary has complete knowledge about the malware detection system, then it is known as a white-box scenario . On the other hand, if the adversary attacks without any prior knowledge about the system, then it is called as black-box scenario . However, the above cases are two extreme ends of the curve for any real-world scenario. Thus we started with white-box attack setting on malware detection models. Later, we also performed a grey-box attack where an adversary has limited knowledge about the malware detection system, which does not include any information about the model‚Äôs architecture or classification algorithm. Therefore in this paper, we proposed a novel adversarial attack for the white-box scenario, namely single-policy attack as it crafts perturbations governed by a single policy extracted from a Q-table. The optimal policy governs the modification attack, where the feature vector extracted from a malicious Android application is modified to be misclassified as benign by different Android malware detection models built using classical, ensemble and deep learning algorithms. The goal of the optimal policy is to modify the maximum number of malicious applications and generate new variants which are misclassified by detection models. Also, modifications are minimized in each application to reduce the overall cost of the attack. These modifications are syntactically possible and do not disrupt the behavioural or functional aspect of the Android applications. We also proposed a multi-policy attack for the grey-box scenario, which consists of a set of optimal policies extracted from many Q-tables and used parallelly for adversarial attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation of adversarial attacks on the grey-box scenario in the area of malware detection. In summary, we have made the following contributions through this paper for the development of the robust Android malware detection system against adversarial attacks: We proposed two novel adversarial attacks on Android malware detection system followed by a defence mechanism to improve the overall robustness of the detection models. We designed a single-policy adversarial attack for the white-box scenario, which achieved an average fooling rate of 44.28%percent44.2844.28\\% with a maximum of five modifications across eight diverse set of detection models. We also devised a multi-policy attack for the grey-box scenario, which obtained an average fooling rate of 53.20%percent53.2053.20\\% with a maximum of five modifications across the same eight detection models. Finally, we proposed a defence mechanism which reduces average fooling rate by threefold and twofold against single policy and multiple policy attack respectively to improve the overall robustness of the Android malware detection system. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 starts with a brief discussion on problem definition and proposes an architecture to construct a robust Android malware detection system. Further in the section, the design of adversarial attacks on malware detection models is explained, followed by defence strategies. Section 3 discusses the experimental evaluation, which contains details of the experimental setup like classification algorithms, dataset, feature evaluation, and performance metrics. Later, experimental results of adversarial attacks using the single policy and multiple policy attack are explained followed by results using defence strategy. Section 4 contains the related work in the domain. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper and presents the future direction of work.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: evolved tremendously in the last decade, and today have reached more than half of the world‚Äôs population .
