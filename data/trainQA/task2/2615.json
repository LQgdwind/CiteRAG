      "content": "Paper Title: Deep ℒ¹ Stochastic Optimal Control Policies for Planetary Soft-landing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe Powered-Descent Guidance (PDG) problem addresses the final stage of entry, descent, and landing sequence wherein a spacecraft uses its rocket engines to maneuver from some initial position to a soft-landing at a desired landing location. It can be framed as a finite time-horizon optimal control problem where the ultimate goal is to achieve a safe landing while minimizing the amount of fuel consumed during descent. The definition of a safe landing is provided in terms of state constraints (such as terminal velocity and position) derived from mission critical requirements. As a consequence, PDG is regarded as a control- and state-constrained optimization problem, with state constraints imposed by stringent mission requirements and control constraints imposed by the thrusting capabilities of the spacecraft. The PDG problem is commonly framed as an ℒ1superscriptℒ1\\mathcal{L}^{1} optimal control problem  wherein the ℒ1superscriptℒ1\\mathcal{L}^{1}-norm of the control is used instead of the standard quadratic control cost. This typically results in a max-min-max thrust profile instead of continuous thrusting as prescribed by a quadratic control cost minimizing controller. Motivation for using the ℒ1superscriptℒ1\\mathcal{L}^{1}-norm: The cost of fuel in space is exponentially larger than any other terrestrial application. Thus, minimizing fuel consumption becomes a critical component in the design of cost functions for the PDG optimal control problem. The fallacy of the assumption that quadratic costs minimize fuel-consumption is proved in . In this work, the author demonstrates how the choice of the norm of the thrust in the cost function is dependent on the type of rocket and which norms actually measure fuel consumption. It is shown that the well-known quadratic cost (or ℒ2superscriptℒ2\\mathcal{L}^{2}-norm) does not measure (and therefore does not minimize) fuel consumption and that a control policy optimal for quadratic costs will be sub-optimal with respect to other control costs that do measure fuel-consumption.\nAdditionally, as mentioned in , continuous thrusting controllers (obtained from quadratic costs), can cause undesirable effects (such as increasing the microgravity environment) on precision pointing payloads. For such payloads, bang-off-bang controllers are preferable so that science can happen during the off periods. Thus, the ℒ1superscriptℒ1\\mathcal{L}^{1}-norm is the de facto choice for designing optimal controllers for space applications. Related work: The PDG optimal control problem is a non-convex optimization problem. One approach is to convexify the original problem and prove that the convexification is lossless . However, proving this is not trivial and requires assumptions leading to ignoring certain constraints (such as the descent glide-slope) that help simplify the analysis. These also require linearizing the dynamics and deriving subsequent error bounds. However, the advantages are that it allows using off-the-shelf convex programming solvers and guarantees unique solutions. Another approach is to use sequential convex programming to iteratively convexify the original problem . Moreover, these approaches consider deterministic dynamics (i.e., cannot handle stochastic disturbances or unmodeled phenomena) and solve the problem for a specific initial condition. To handle stochasticity or arbitrary initial conditions, the solutions have to be recomputed on-the-fly. The authors in [ref]5 consider a stochastic version of the PDG problem, however, they do not consider stochasticity in the dynamics of the mass of the spacecraft. As will be seen in our problem formulation, the stochasticity entering the mass dynamics are negatively correlated to that entering the acceleration dynamics. Additionally, to handle the non-convex thrust-bounds constraint, they impose a control structure allowing Gaussian controls and then constrain only the mean to satisfy conservative thrust bounds. This makes the problem deterministic and the same lossless convexification solution as in  can be used. However, the conservative bounds lead to increased fuel consumption for which they propose solving an additional covariance steering problem. This solution relies on linear dynamics and does not work when there is stochasticity in the mass dynamics and the state vector contains the spacecraft’s mass thus yielding a nonlinear dynamical model. Another approach  based on the same stochastic optimal control theory as ours, presents a solution for the one-dimensional stochastic PDG problem. However, the closed-form optimal control expression presented in this work does not hold for the general three-dimensional constrained PDG problem as well as the proposed numerical algorithm is prone to compunding errors from least-squares approximations at every time step. Nevertheless, the results in terms of crash percentages demonstrate superior performance to deterministic controllers as well as the venerable Apollo powered descent guidance law and comparable performance in terms of fuel consumption. This motivates our work based on the same theory but delivers a general solution. There are recent works in literature that use deep neural networks (DNNs) to solve the deterministic soft landing problem. In , the authors employ an imitation learning-like procedure wherein Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle (PMP) is used to solve optimal control problems for soft-landing and generate training data. This data is then used to train DNNs via supervised learning. The authors claim that the learned policy can generalize to unseen areas of the state space. However, their approach considers a two-dimensional representation of a rocket and does not consider any state constraints. In [ref]7, the authors solve the 2D PDG problem for a spacecraft with vectorized thrust by formulating a Hamiltonian through the use of PMP and derive the necessary conditions of optimality that lead to a Two-Point Boundary Value Problem. They use a DNN to approximate the initial conditions of the adjoint variables which are then used to forward propagate the adjoint variables in time. Our proposed solution using deep Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (FBSDEs) adopts a similar strategy to allow forward-propagation of the backward SDE (BSDE). To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to propose a deep learning based solution to the stochastic three dimensional constrained PDG problem. Our work is inspired by  and builds off of recent work  [ref]9 that use DNNs to solve systems of FBSDEs. These so called deep FBSDE controllers are scalable solutions to solve high-dimensional parabolic partial differential equations such as the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) PDE that one encounters in continuous-time stochastic optimal control problems. These do not suffer from compounding least-squares errors and do not require backpropagating SDEs. By treating the initial-value of the BSDE as a learnable parameter of the DNN, the BSDE can be forward propagated and the deviation from the given terminal-value can be used as a loss function to train the DNN. These controllers have been used to successfully solve high-dimensional problems in finance [ref]9 and safety-critical control problems 0. Compared to the work thus far on deep FBSDEs and PDG literature, our main contributions are as follows: Ability to solve the nonlinear ℒ1superscriptℒ1\\mathcal{L}^{1} Stochastic Optimal Control PDG problem using deep FBSDEs without relying on convexification and convex solvers in an end-to-end differentiable manner. Incorporated first-exit time capability into the deep FBSDE framework for the PDG problem. Can be trained to be invariant of the initial position of the spacecraft and handle stochastic disturbances. The trained network can be deployed as a feedback policy without having to recompute the optimal solution online. With regards to computational burden, similar to , our approach is also based on training a policy network offline. The online computation comprises of a forward pass through a neural network and one-step parallel simulation of the dynamics. These computations can be performed entirely on a CPU (using vectorized operations) or a modest GPU.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: unmodeled phenomena) and solve the problem for a specific initial condition.
