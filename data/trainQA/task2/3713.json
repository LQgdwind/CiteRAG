      "content": "Paper Title: BELLATREX: Building Explanations through a LocaLly AccuraTe Rule EXtractor\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMachine Learning (ML) models are nowadays employed in various domains with excellent performance. When the performance is key to having a competitive advantage, ML models are widespread even when the algorithmic procedure is too complicated to be understood by humans (so called “black box” algorithms). However, in fields where the stakes for a single decision are high (healthcare, banking, etc.)  there is still scepticism in adopting such models.\nProfessionals are accountable for any costly mistake, and in such cases they want to fully understand and trust the outcomes of a ML model. An important element that leads to trust in ML models is to achieve more explainability in ML . In recent years, the ML community has therefore been developing tools that help ML practitioners and end-users to understand the predictions of black box models, leading to a booming of the field of Explainable AI (X-AI). As a result, X-AI methods nowadays make up a vast literature and can be categorised in several ways. One way is to distinguish the type of output explanations: global explanations  [ref]4, where the aim is to identify trends in the data and explain the model as a whole, or local explanations [ref]5 , where the aim is to understand why a certain prediction is made for a given instance.\nAnother common differentiation is made based on whether\nthe method has access to the internal components of the model and its architecture.\nIf that is the case, we talk about a model-specific approach, as opposed to a model-agnostic (e.g. [ref]5 ) approach. In this study, we propose Bellatrex: a local, model-specific method that condenses the predictions made by a random forest (RF)  into a few rules. By doing so, our method uses information directly extracted from the original RF. Furthermore, the procedure is optimised to follow closely the RF predictions for every instance, and maintains the original RF high performance.\nIn addition to high performance, Bellatrex provides different insights by selecting rules that are dissimilar from each other. Furthermore, given its local method, the extracted rules are different for each instance. The choice to specifically explain RF predictions is driven by the fact that RF has a great predictive performance and is easier to train than other highly performing methods, such as deep neural networks. Moreover, RF has been extended to a wide range of learning tasks, including binary classification, multi-label classification, regression and time-to-event prediction. We should highlight that our method is designed in such a way that it is independent of the learning task at hand, and consequently, it is capable of handling all these scenarios. Bellatrex is built on top of a trained RF and consists of four main steps. First, for a given input instance, a subset of rules is selected based on how close their prediction is with respect to the original ensemble. Second, a vector representation is built by extracting information from the rule structure. Third, dimensionality reduction of such representations is performed and lastly, we apply clustering on the projected vector representations, extracting this way only a few prototype rules. These final rules are then presented to the end user as an explanation for the forest prediction. By keeping the number of prototype rules low, we provide a few diverse explanations, which can be inspected by the user. Preliminary results of this work were presented in an earlier workshop paper  and were restricted to binary and time-to-event predictions. Here, we extend this work to regression (both single- and multi-target) and multi-label classification. Furthermore, we also provide a thorough experimental evaluation of our method against competitor methods from the literature in predictive performance, explanation complexity and explanation diversity, followed by an ablation study which validates the steps in our method. Overall, our contributions to the field of X-AI can be summarised as follows: We propose a local approach for explaining RF predictions, with a method that extracts a few meaningful decision paths from a trained RF. Importantly, the extracted rules are tailored to the instance to be explained, which represents, to the best of our knowledge, a novelty in the field of explaining RF predictions.\n We evaluate our local explainer in five different scenarios: binary classification, single- and multi-target regression, multi-label classification and time-to-event prediction, where the latter three are seldom explored in existing explainability methods. The inclusion of the time-to-event analysis in particular, highlights a novelty of our work since, to the best of our knowledge, no existing model-specific interpretability method is compatible with an adaptation of RF to time-to-event scenarios. We make our method available to the ML community by providing a Python implementation through GitHub111https://github.com/Klest94/Bellatrex, compatible with the scikit-learn and scikit-survival Python libraries. The remainder of the manuscript is organised as follows: Section 2 positions our work within the framework of post-hoc, RF-specific explainers, and underlines the differences with the existing literature; Section 3 provides the background information for the method section (Section 4), where our model is introduced. These are followed by Section 5, dedicated to the experimental set-up and Section 6, where the predictive performance of the method, the average complexity of the extracted rules, and the average dissimilarity of the latter are reported together with the outcomes of the ablation study. Next, we provide two examples of explanations generated by Bellatrex in Section 7. Finally, we draw our conclusions and share future directions of this work (Section 8).\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: AI (X-AI).
