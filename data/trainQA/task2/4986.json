      "content": "Paper Title: Spatial Reasoning for Few-Shot Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe show the nAP50 performance on PASCAL VOC with the three novel set splits in Table 1. As shown in the table, our approach outperforms existing methods in all novel set splits and the different numbers of training shots. The improvements become larger as we use the less number of training examples; e.g. 8.4%, 5.1% and 8.0% when compared with MPSR  on the 1-shot setting of the three novel set splits. To validate this observation clearly, we visualize the nAP50 performance by increasing k𝑘k and compare it with existing methods. As shown in Fig. 6, the proposed method achieves large performance gains particularly in low-shot settings such as 1-shot and 2-shots. This reveals that when training examples are extremely scarce, the non-local features identified by the spatial reasoning enhance the feature representation of novel RoIs. For more detailed comparisons, we provide nAP50, bAP50 and mAP50 in 3-shots and 10-shots with the novel set split 1. After collecting the detection results with all base and novel categories, we separately measured the detection performance on novel categories (nAP), base categories (bAP) and both categories (mAP). As shown in Table 2, the proposed method outperforms meta-learning based few-shot objects detectors  [ref]17 and MPSR  for the base categories because we freeze the feature extractor during the fine-tuning phase. However, TFA [ref]18 exhibits better bAP50 than our method by 1.7% and 1.0% in 3-shots and 10-shots, respectively. A possible reason is that novel RoIs affect the feature representation of existing base RoIs during the feature propagation of the GCN. \n\n\n\nShot\nMethod\nnAP50\nbAP50\nmAP50\n\n\n\n3\nFSRW \n26.7\n64.8\n55.3\n\nMeta R-CNN [ref]17\n35.0\n64.8\n57.3\n\nTFA w/cos [ref]18\n44.7\n79.1\n70.5\n\nMPSR \n51.4\n67.8\n63.7\n\nFSOD-SR (ours)\n56.2\n77.4\n72.1\n\n10\nFSRW \n47.2\n63.6\n59.5\n\nMeta R-CNN [ref]17\n51.5\n67.9\n63.8\n\nTFA w/cos [ref]18\n56.0\n78.4\n72.8\n\nMPSR \n61.8\n71.8\n69.3\n\nFSOD-SR (ours)\n62.4\n77.4\n73.7\n\n \n\n\n\nShot\nMethod\nn​A​P𝑛𝐴𝑃nAP\nn​A​P​50𝑛𝐴𝑃50nAP50\nn​A​P​75𝑛𝐴𝑃75nAP75\nn​A​PS𝑛𝐴subscript𝑃𝑆nAP_{S}\nn​A​PM𝑛𝐴subscript𝑃𝑀nAP_{M}\nn​A​PL𝑛𝐴subscript𝑃𝐿nAP_{L}\nn​A​R1𝑛𝐴subscript𝑅1nAR_{1}\nn​A​R10𝑛𝐴subscript𝑅10nAR_{10}\nn​A​R100𝑛𝐴subscript𝑅100nAR_{100}\nn​A​RS𝑛𝐴subscript𝑅𝑆nAR_{S}\nn​A​RM𝑛𝐴subscript𝑅𝑀nAR_{M}\nn​A​RL𝑛𝐴subscript𝑅𝐿nAR_{L}\n\n\n\n10\nFSRW \n5.6\n12.3\n4.6\n0.9\n3.5\n10.5\n10.1\n14.3\n14.4\n1.5\n8.4\n28.2\n\nMetaDet [ref]16\n7.1\n14.6\n6.1\n1.0\n4.1\n12.2\n11.9\n15.1\n15.5\n1.7\n9.7\n30.1\n\nMeta R-CNN [ref]17\n8.7\n19.1\n6.6\n2.3\n7.7\n14.0\n12.6\n17.8\n17.9\n7.8\n15.6\n27.2\n\nTFA w/fc [ref]18\n10.0\n19.2\n9.2\n3.9\n8.4\n16.3\n14.8\n22.2\n22.4\n7.8\n20.3\n35.0\n\nTFA w/cos [ref]18\n9.8\n18.7\n9.0\n4.5\n8.8\n15.8\n14.7\n22.5\n22.8\n9.6\n21.1\n33.9\n\nMPSR \n9.8\n17.9\n9.7\n3.3\n9.2\n16.1\n15.7\n21.2\n21.2\n4.6\n19.6\n34.3\n\nOurs\n11.6\n21.7\n10.4\n4.6\n10.5\n17.2\n16.4\n23.9\n24.1\n9.3\n21.8\n37.7\n\n30\nFSRW \n9.1\n19.0\n7.6\n0.8\n4.9\n16.8\n13.2\n17.7\n17.8\n1.5\n10.4\n33.5\n\nMetaDet [ref]16\n11.3\n21.7\n8.1\n1.1\n6.2\n17.3\n14.5\n18.9\n19.2\n1.8\n11.1\n34.4\n\nMeta R-CNN [ref]17\n12.4\n25.3\n10.8\n2.8\n11.6\n19.0\n15.0\n21.4\n21.7\n8.6\n20.0\n32.1\n\nTFA w/fc [ref]18\n13.5\n24.9\n13.2\n5.0\n12.6\n21.7\n17.6\n26.1\n26.3\n8.0\n23.4\n41.2\n\nTFA w/cos [ref]18\n13.6\n25.0\n13.4\n5.9\n12.2\n21.3\n17.5\n26.4\n26.7\n10.1\n23.9\n40.2\n\nMPSR \n14.1\n25.4\n14.2\n4.0\n12.9\n23.0\n17.7\n24.2\n24.3\n5.5\n21.0\n39.3\n\nOurs\n15.2\n27.5\n14.6\n6.1\n14.5\n24.7\n18.4\n27.1\n27.3\n9.8\n25.1\n42.6\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: detection performance on novel categories (nAP), base categories (bAP) and both categories (mAP).
