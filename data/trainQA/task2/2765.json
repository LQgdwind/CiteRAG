      "content": "Paper Title: Distribution Knowledge Embedding for Graph Pooling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph pooling methods.‚ÄÑ\nIn recent years, different approaches to graph representation learning via pooling modules have been investigated in the graph classification tasks. They can be divided into two schools: hierarchical graph pooling and flat graph pooling.\nHierarchical graph pooling is similar to the downsampling strategy in computer vision to gradually coarsen graphs. The works in¬†[ref]6 [ref]7 [ref]8  are the most representative hierarchical graph pooling methods.\nDIFFPool¬†[ref]6 proposed a differentiable graph pooling module that can generate hierarchical representations of graphs and can be combined with various graph neural network architectures in an end-to-end fashion.\nMinCutPool¬†[ref]7 formulated a continuous relaxation of the normalized minCUT problem to addresses limitations of spectral clustering and proposed a graph pooling operator that overcomes some important limitations of the existing graph pooling techniques.\nHAP¬†[ref]8 utilized a novel cross-level attention mechanism to focus more on close neighborhood and learned a global graph content to extract the graph pattern properties for the global guidance in graph coarsening.\nFlat graph pooling, also known as graph readout operation¬† plugged at the end of GNN layers, generates single vectors for representing graphs. Different from hierarchical graph pooling methods, flat graph pooling can only be used once to learn graph representations. The most familiar averaging and summation operations in GNNs¬†   belong to the flat graph pooling but only collect the first-order statistic information of the node representations and ignore the important higher-order statistics. Therefore, Wang et al.¬† proposed a second-order pooling framework as graph pooling and demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of second-order statistics for graph neural networks.\nHowever, all these methods ignore the non-Euclidean geometry characteristic of graphs, which will cause severe information missing and downgrade the performance of graph representations. Gaussian-based representation methods.‚ÄÑ\nIn statistics, the Gaussian distribution is a type of continuous probability distribution for a real-valued random variable. By considering two main parameters of multivariate Gaussians, i.e., mean and covariance components, the Gaussian-based representation methods¬†           have been shown to offer powerful representations for various recognition and regression tasks. Nakayama et al.  embedded Gaussians in a flat manifold by taking an affine coordinate system and applied them to scene categorization. Calvo et al.  embedded the manifold of multivariate Gaussians with informative geometry into the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices with the Siegel metric.\nLovric¬¥¬¥ùëê\\acute{c} et al.¬† embedded Gaussians in the Riemannian symmetric space¬† with a slightly different metric on the space of multivariate Gaussians. Chen et al.¬† considered the geometry structure of the Riemannian manifold of Gaussians and generated the final representations via Riemannian local difference vectors for image set classification. Wang et al.¬† proposed a robust estimation of approximate infinite-dimensional Gaussian based on von Neumann divergence and applied it to material recognition.\nLi et al.¬† proposed the local Log-Euclidean multivariate Gaussian descriptor by defining a multiplication operation on Riemannian manifold to embed Gaussians in the linear space for image classification. Wang et al.¬†  proposed a novel trainable layer to obtain the square root form of the Gaussian embedding matrix, which considered the Lie group structure of Gaussians and achieved the competitive performance on the challenging fine-grained recognition tasks.\nDifferent from the above works handling Gaussians with complicated Riemannian operations, our designed pooling module embeds Gaussian in the linear space with Euclidean operations while outlining the distribution information of Gaussians.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: into two schools: hierarchical graph pooling and flat graph pooling.\nHierarchical graph pooling is similar to the downsampling strategy in computer vision to gradually coarsen graphs.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
