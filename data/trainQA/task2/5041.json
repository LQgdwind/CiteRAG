      "content": "Paper Title: Scale-Aware Crowd Counting Using a Joint Likelihood Density Map and Synthetic Fusion Pyramid Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the literature, there are several frameworks such as   based on hand-crafted features to count objects with low densities. These methods cannot handle cases with diverse crowd distributions. Inspired by the success of heatmap-based object detection, many CNN architectures 3   [ref]27  1 9  are proposed to use various regression models to improve density maps, where the sum of the density map yields the crowd count. Details of these architectures are surveyed below. Handle scale variations in crowd counting.\nOne critical challenge of crowd counting based on the sum of density map is the scale variation due to various distances between the viewing cameras and the targets. In the multicolumn CNN of , each column uses a different combination of convolution kernels to extract multiple-scale features. However, the results of 3 show that similar features are often learned in each column of this network; and thus the model cannot be efficiently trained as the layers go deeper. In 3, multi-scale features are obtained using VGG16 and convolutions are adopted with different dilation rates. Instead of using different conv kernel sizes in each layer, a multi-branch strategy is used in  to choose convolution filters with a fixed size to extract multiple-scale features across layers. To avoid repeatedly computing convolutional features from subregions, in [ref]27, the multiresolution feature maps are generated by dividing a dense region into subregions, whose counts are calculated within a previously observed closed set. In 4, scale variation is handled by encoding multi-scale contextual information into the regression model. In 1, a density attention network generates various attention masks to focus the task of crowd counting on a particular scale. A densely connected architecture is used in 6 to maintain multi-scale information well, while an attention mechanism is used to remove the background noise. In 9, the CAN 4 and ASPP  are integrated into the regression model to obtain multi-scale features for better heat map generation. To improve generalizability,  proposed a CNN architecture based on a switching strategy to perform an alternative optimization between density estimation and count estimation. Deviation and errors from point-wise annotations.\nIn most crowd-counting datasets, a dotted annotation is often adopted to represent each object in images and profoundly affects subjective deviation and\nperformance evaluation compared to the bounding-box annotation since the dotted annotation does not include\nany size information. To address this issue, in , the average distance from each head to its three neighbors is calculated, and then the head size is estimated as the Gaussian standard deviation. In , various locally connected Gaussian kernels are used to replace the original convolution filter to reduce noise during the density map generation process. Loss Function: In the literature, the pixel-wise Mean Square Error (MSE) loss has dominated the training of density estimation-based crowd counting approaches. In 0, the annotation deviation is reduced by using a combinatorial loss that includes a spatial abstraction term and a spatial correlation term. The Bayesian loss is used in 5 to construct a density contribution probability model to reduce the influence of deviation. However, this approach cannot handle false positives well. Furthermore, a DM-count loss is defined in  to measure the similarity between the normalized predicted density map and the ground truth. In , a loss function with a multivariate Gaussian distribution is defined to deal with the problems of annotation noise and correlation. However, this loss is not scale-aware. In general, a pixel shift in annotation might not affect the accuracy of large object counting; however, it will result in significant errors in small object counting.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: to count objects with low densities.
