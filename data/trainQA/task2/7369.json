      "content": "Paper Title: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning with Prior Knowledge\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, deep learning has made breakthroughs in various vision tasks. In real-world scenarios, data often comes in sequentially as streams, which poses challenges for us to train neural networks: (I) It is expensive to retrain the network when new data is loaded in, and in specific cases, the old data cannot be reused; (II) training only on new data can make the neural network‚Äôs ability to process old knowledge drop dramatically, called catastrophic forgetting. Therefore, incremental learning is needed to help solve these problems. Current class incremental learning focuses more on the case when the number of new class samples is large enough. In real life, the label is often harder to obtain, especially for rare resources or data that need to focus on privacy protection. This led to the emergence of the few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) , [ref]2, [ref]3, [ref]4, , . The fundamental paradigm of FSCIL involves pre-training a model on a comprehensive labeled base class dataset. Subsequent data arrives in the form of a stream of NùëÅN-way KùêæK-shot, necessitating the model to minimize the forgetting of previous knowledge while assimilating new information. In the face of challenges associated with learning and convergence in few-shot data streams, conventional attention is often directed toward optimizing the efficient utilization of limited samples. However, there is a tendency to overlook the valuable semantic information that could potentially reside within unlabeled data. Leveraging these unlabeled data and integrating them into the initial model training process can furnish specific feature priors for subsequent incremental learning. Simultaneously, this approach facilitates the acquisition of shared patterns, thereby augmenting the model‚Äôs generalization capabilities. Recently, there has been research leveraging readily available unlabeled data to enhance model performance in the FSCIL task , ,. They have achieved good results using a semi-supervised learning paradigm and utilizing knowledge distillation. This work can be categorized as semi-supervised few-shot incremental learning (Semi-FSCIL). Based on the current state of research, we intend to leverage unlabeled data to incorporate prior knowledge during the pre-training phase, setting the stage for subsequent incremental learning, as illustrated in Figure 1.\nSemi-supervised learning has demonstrated its effectiveness in enhancing models with unlabeled data when labeled data is limited 0, 1. In our approach, we leverage unlabeled data in a manner that differs from traditional semi-supervised approaches. The unlabeled data is not used as labeled cooperation objects simultaneously with labeled data; instead, it is introduced at the very beginning as a form of data prior. Previous work 2 explains the advantages of forward compatibility in this context, while Germain et al. 3 demonstrates the validity of the priori from a theoretical perspective. They do not extract valid information from easily available unlabeled data to enhance modeling capabilities. We initiate with novel concepts, proposing the idea of incorporating knowledge priors in the pre-training. Wu et al. 4 proposes a two-stage algorithm that first builds a basic model with strong representational capabilities and adapts it to new data by fine-tuning. Their approach requires pre-training on a very large dataset and is not well-suited for few-shot tasks.\nIn contrast, by adding weaker prior knowledge as an intervention in the pre-trained phase, we can improve the extraction and recognition of new knowledge in the incremental phase by learning as many features as possible that may subsequently appear as new classes; at the same time, fewer adjustments to the model parameters can better maintain the model‚Äôs memory of old knowledge. LwPK needs not to train a large amount of base data in the pre-trained phase but only needs to add some unlabeled images and assign pseudo-labels using unsupervised clustering. By training these data jointly, the pre-trained model with prior knowledge can be constructed. To assign supervisory signals to unlabeled data, we utilize a deep clustering scheme that performs clustering and pseudo-label assignment on a semantic-based basis by learning feature representations that are more suitable for clustering 5, 6. The contributions of this study mainly include: Propose LwPK to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and overfitting in FSCIL using unlabeled samples with pseudo-labels generated by clustering algorithm for joint training with base class data. Experimentally confirm the effectiveness of LwPK for FSCIL through extensive experiments on CIFAR100 7, CUB200 8, and miniImageNet 9. Theoretically substantiate the efficacy of LwPK through empirical risk minimization and class distance analysis, aligning with experimental findings and showcasing its robust approach in FSCIL.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: the label is often harder to obtain, especially for rare resources or data that need to focus on privacy protection.
