      "content": "Paper Title: Multilingual Music Genre Embeddings for Effective Cross-Lingual Music Item Annotation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRetrofitting [ref]14 has been proposed as a post-processing step to improve concept embeddings by leveraging existing semantic lexicons or knowledge graphs (e.g. WordNet [ref]31).\nMore precisely, concept embeddings are modified to also encode concept relations [ref]14   . Let G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) be the graph capturing the semantic relations between the nodes in V𝑉V through a set of edges E⊆V×V𝐸𝑉𝑉E\\subseteq V\\times V.\nThe objective of retrofitting is to learn Q∈I​Rn×dQIsuperscriptR𝑛𝑑\\textbf{Q}\\in{\\rm I\\!R}^{n\\times d}, the new concept embeddings, such that each new embedding qi∈I​Rdsubscriptq𝑖IsuperscriptR𝑑\\textbf{q}_{i}\\in{\\rm I\\!R}^{d} does not stray too far from the initial distributional embedding q^isubscript^q𝑖\\hat{\\textbf{q}}_{i}, but also becomes closer to the new embeddings of the neighbour vertices qj∈I​Rd,j:(i,j)∈E:subscriptq𝑗IsuperscriptR𝑑𝑗𝑖𝑗𝐸\\textbf{q}_{j}\\in{\\rm I\\!R}^{d},j:(i,j)\\in E.\nThe objective function to minimize is then [ref]14: where αisubscript𝛼𝑖\\alpha_{i} and βi​jsubscript𝛽𝑖𝑗\\beta_{ij} are positive scalars specifying the importance given to each component, the initial embedding and each graph neighbor.\nAs ΦΦ\\Phi is convex with respect to Q, a solution minimizing the objective function ΦΦ\\Phi is found in [ref]14 via an iterative strategy derived from Jacobi iteration algorithm  that converges for such graph-based propagation problem  [ref]36. More precisely, until convergence, qisubscriptq𝑖\\textbf{q}_{i} is iteratively updated as follows: where Q is initialized to Q^^Q\\hat{\\textbf{Q}}.\nEquation (5) is not the same as the original one [ref]14.\nWe observed that, when applying the Jacobi method to optimize equation (4), the contributing terms in the partial derivative with respect to the node i𝑖i are those where i𝑖i appears as source as well as target node in the inner sum, leading to a different update.\nIn [ref]36 , the same conclusion referring to a corrected update rule, different from the initial proposal, is reached. Faruqui et al. [ref]14 set αi=1subscript𝛼𝑖1\\alpha_{i}=1 and βi​j=1degree​(i)subscript𝛽𝑖𝑗1degree𝑖\\beta_{ij}=\\frac{1}{\\text{degree}(i)} for (i,j)∈E𝑖𝑗𝐸(i,j)\\in E, where degree​(i)degree𝑖\\text{degree}(i) is the number of neighbors i𝑖i has in the graph G𝐺G, or 00 for (i,j)∉E𝑖𝑗𝐸(i,j)\\not\\in E.\nThis choice was largely adopted in other related works  .\nSpeer and Chin  proposed to use a modified version of retrofitting to learn embeddings for unknown vocabulary concepts which are present in the knowledge graph.\nFor this case, αisubscript𝛼𝑖\\alpha_{i} is set to 0 for all unknown vocabulary concepts.\nThis results in qisubscriptq𝑖\\textbf{q}_{i} being updated by averaging the embeddings of its neighbours at each iteration.\nDespite the change in the update rule we made, compared to the original work, we retain this choice of hyper-parameters as being a reasonable default, and defer the investigation of a more principled way to pick αisubscript𝛼𝑖\\alpha_{i} and βi​jsubscript𝛽𝑖𝑗\\beta_{ij} to future work. We further modify retrofitting to take advantage of the different types of music genre relations.\nOn one hand, music genres can be semantically equivalent to other music genres (the relation types wikiPageRedirects and sameAs).\nOn the other hand, music genres can be related to other music genres, but not semantically equivalent (e.g. stylisticOrigin).\nThe change we propose for computing these new embeddings (Qβ¯subscriptQ¯𝛽\\textbf{Q}_{\\overline{\\beta}}) is through the coefficients βi​jsubscript𝛽𝑖𝑗\\beta_{ij}, making them dependent on music genre relation types: where Eϵsubscript𝐸italic-ϵE_{\\epsilon} contains edges which represent equivalence relations (wikiPageRedirects, sameAs);\nE−Eϵ𝐸subscript𝐸italic-ϵE-E_{\\epsilon} contains edges with the remaining relation types (stylisticOrigin, musicSubgenre, derivative, musicFusionGenre).\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: Retrofitting [ref]14 has been proposed as a post-processing step to improve concept embeddings by leveraging existing semantic lexicons or knowledge graphs (e.g. WordNet [ref]31).\nMore precisely, concept\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
