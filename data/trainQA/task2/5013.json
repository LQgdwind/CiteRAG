      "content": "Paper Title: Robust Manifold Nonnegative Tucker Factorization for Tensor Data Representation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe hyperparameters of RMNTF-CIM, RMNTF-Huber, and RMNTF-Cauchy in all experiments were set as follows:\nλ=105,p=3formulae-sequence𝜆superscript105𝑝3\\lambda=10^{5},p=3, unless otherwise stated.\nWe compared RMNTF with three NMF methods, and six NTD methods.\nThey are listed as follows: Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) [ref]8:\nWe unfold tensorial original data into a matrix to apply it to NMF algorithm and obtain a low rank activation matrix 𝐕𝐕\\mathbf{V}.\nFinally, we apply 𝐕𝐕\\mathbf{V} to downstream tasks. Graph Regularization Nonnegative Matrix Decomposition (GNMF) : We unfold tensorial data into a matrix 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X} and reduce the dimensionality of 𝐗𝐗\\mathbf{X} into K𝐾K by GNMF, where the dictionary matrix 𝐔𝐔\\mathbf{U} is used in graph regularization term. The coefficient of regularization λ=10𝜆10\\lambda=10, and the hyperparameter p=3𝑝3p=3. Correntropy Induced Metric Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (CIMNMF) :Similar to the above, we unfold the tensorial data into a matrix and apply it to CIMNMF. The loss function between the unfolding tensor and reconstruction data is based on the correntropy induced metric.\nIt handles outlier rows by incorporating structural knowledge about outliers. Nonnegative Tucker Decomposition (NTD) :\nNTD works directly on the tensorial data.\nIt is constructed by the tucker model with nonnegativity constraints and updated by multiplicative rules.\nThis method can be considered as a special case of RMNTF when all the entries of weight tensor 𝒲𝒲\\mathcal{W} are 111, and λ=0𝜆0\\lambda=0. Nonnegative Tucker Decomposition with alpha-Divergence (α𝛼\\alphaNTD) :\nWe directly use the tensorial data to α𝛼\\alphaNTD.\nIt is considered α𝛼\\alpha-divergence as a discrepancy measure and derive multiplicative updating rules for NTD.\nThe hyperparameter α=1𝛼1\\alpha=1. Sparse Nonnegative Tucker Decomposition (SparseNTD) : The tensorial data is directly utilized in SparseNTD. It adopts the sparsity and nonnegativity constraints to a core tensor and several factor matrices.\nThe hyperparameter λ=0.5𝜆0.5\\lambda=0.5. Graph Regularized Nonnegative Tucker Decomposition (GNTD) : GNTD use tensorial data and it constructs the nearest neighbor graph to maintain the intrinsic manifold structure of tensor and applies this constraint on the N𝑁Nth factor matrix.\nThe hyperparameters λ=105𝜆superscript105\\lambda=10^{5}, and p=3𝑝3p=3. Locally Linear Embedding Regularized Nonnegative Tucker Decomposition (LLENTD) : We directly use tensor in LLENTD. It incorporates Laplacian Eigenmaps as manifold regularization terms into the least square form of nonnegative tucker model.\nThe hyperparameters λ=105𝜆superscript105\\lambda=10^{5}, and p=3𝑝3p=3. Manifold Regularization Nonnegative Tucker Decomposition (MRNTD) : MRNTD utilizes tensor data directly. It employs the manifold regularization terms for the core tensors constructed in the NTD.\nThe hyperparameters λ=105𝜆superscript105\\lambda=10^{5}, and p=3𝑝3p=3. Hypergraph regularized nonnegative tensor factorization (hyperNTD) :We take tensorial data into hyperNTD directly. It incorporates a higher-order relationship among the nearest neighborhoods and the nonnegative tucker decomposition.\nThe hyperparameters λ=105𝜆superscript105\\lambda=10^{5}, and p=3𝑝3p=3.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: unless otherwise stated.\nWe compared RMNTF with three NMF methods, and six NTD methods.\nThey are listed as follows: Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) [ref]8:\nWe unfold tensorial original data into a matrix to apply it to NMF algorithm and obtain a low rank activation matrix 𝐕𝐕\\mathbf{V}.\nFinally, we apply 𝐕𝐕\\mathbf{V} to downstream tasks.
