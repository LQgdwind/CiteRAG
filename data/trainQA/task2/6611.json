      "content": "Paper Title: Exploiting Counter-Examples for Active Learning with Partial labels\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAccording to the different query types between the oracle and the predictor, active learning (AL) normally can be divided into membership query synthesis, stream-based query, and pool-based query . Pool-based AL, where the selector decides on the annotated samples from a large pool of unlabeled datasets, has drastically appealed to many scholars from academia and industry because of its huge potential value in practical application. With the development of deep learning, pool-based AL has simultaneously experienced the stage from model-driven to data-driven. For the prevailing model-driven category, the selector heavily relies on handcrafted features or metrics to query the data. Uncertainty sampling, as the most used metric for the selector, aims to pick out the samples with low confidence from the predictor. Often, such uncertainty could be modeled in three following ways: the posterior probability of a predicted class , the margin between posterior probabilities of a predicted class and the secondly predicted class , or the entropy . Furthermore, all these uncertainty metrics could be improved, though time-consuming as it is, by using Monte Carlo Dropout and multiple forward passes based on Bayesian inference [ref]29 [ref]7. Some methods also modeled the impacts of the selected sample on the current model through Fisher information , mutual information [ref]29 [ref]7, or expected gradient length [ref]31. Specifically, [ref]31 proposed to select the samples that were disparate and high magnitude in a hallucinated gradient space constructed by using the model parameters of the predictor. Another important metric for the selector is diversity sampling, which aims to select representative and diverse samples for the predictor to better learn from the datasets. To this end, some methods using discrete optimization   focused on sample subset selection while  aimed at mining out the center points of subsets by clustering. Besides, such informative samples could also be highlighted by measuring the expected output changes , or the distribution distance between the unlabeled pool and the selected samples . The methods in the data-driven category describe that the selector, often equipped with deep models, is trained to automatically learn features or metrics. To learn the auto-feature or auto-metric, some methods adopted a generative model-based selector, such as VAE or GAN, to learn to distinguish unlabeled samples from labeled ones  . Moreover, some methods turned to adopting or designing data augmentation to help the selector better learn the input space .  introduced an auxiliary deep network, predicting the\n“loss” of the unlabeled samples, to select the samples with large “loss” to help the query process.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: or the entropy . Furthermore, all these uncertainty metrics could be improved, though time-consuming as it is, by using Monte Carlo Dropout and multiple forward passes based on Bayesian inference [ref]29 [ref]7. Some methods also modeled the impacts of the selected sample on the current model through Fisher information , mutual information [ref]29 [ref]7, or expected gradient length [ref]31.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
