      "content": "Paper Title: EEG-based Image Feature Extraction for Visual Classification using Deep Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe reviewed the previous studies and approaches for EEG classification and visual classification using the EEG dataset. EEG data consists of multiple channels of time-series signals per sample or trial. Over the years, many studies and state-of-the-art approaches have contributed to improve EEG data classifications. SyncNet [ref]8 and EEGNet , used for benchmarking classes in the EEG datasets, are notable mentions of deep learning models of high performance. Li et al. [ref]8 built the SyncNet that used structured 1D convolution layers to extract power from both time and frequency domains and classified the data based on joint modeling of 1D CNNs. Lawhern et al.  used 2D CNNs along different dimensions of EEG data to create EEGNet. The first set learned frequency information via temporal convolution and then learned spatial features of specific frequency using a depth-wise set of CNNs. One of the necessities in the standard EEG processing pipeline is feature engineering [ref]10. Traditional feature extraction provides only certain aspects of EEG, such as frequency or temporal domain content. A time-frequency resolution of EEG data can achieve the two-dimensional EEG representation. Therefore, the signals can be converted to a spectrogram image using STFT (short-time Fourier transform) [ref]6  or to a scaleogram image using CWT (continuous wavelet transform) . Thus, it can leverage the performance of the pre-trained deep learning models using transfer learning. The earlier efforts by Raghu et al.  have shown success in EEG classification using spectrogram encoded images instead of raw EEG signals. Hence, we explored efficient ways to use the image-transformed features from EEG-ImageNet data in one of our classification experiments using CNN-based deep learning models without losing any channel or frequency information. Zhang et al.  followed a unique classification approach based on an EEG dataset . They used 8-bit heatmap scaling to convert the raw EEG signals into images. Later, they used pre-trained MobileNet to extract deep features from these images. In the end, they used an SVM classifier and obtained good classification performance. Multi-modal fusion of diverse data has been emerging research to automate visual classification problems. Spampinato et al.  presented the first automated visual classification method driven by human brain signals using a CNN-based regression on the EEG manifold. Visual image stimuli evoked EEG data were learned with an RNN and then used to classify images into a learned EEG representation. Their promising results paved the way for human brain processes involved in effectively decoding visual recognition for further inclusion in automated methods. Li et al.  claimed that the results reported by Spampinato et al.  depended on a block design, and a rapid-event design process cannot replicate the results. The block design and training/test set splits were such that every trial in each test set came from a block with many attempts in the corresponding training set. Li et al.  also claimed that the wrong block design approach led to a high classification accuracy from the long-term brain activity associated with a block rather than the perception of the class stimuli. Palazzo et al. defended their previous research  by counter analyzing the claims made by Li et al.  while admitting the faults in data pre-processing. As a result, the classification performance was lower than the previously claimed average accuracy of around 83% . According to their latest work , the reduced accuracy was attributable to EEG drift because the earlier work mistakenly used unfiltered EEG data. The authors  achieved nearly 20% accuracy with correctly filtered data (high-frequency gamma-band); EEGNet reported about 30% accuracy, and EEG-Channel Net obtained approximately 50% accuracy. However, in their experimental finding, the temporal correlation in â€™s data was nominal, and the block design was suitable for classification studies after pre-processing. Consequently, they corrected for the publicly available data with proper filtering. Following this revelation, the performance of the models developed in , ,  and  cannot be compared as they are based on the unfiltered EEG data from  and the filtered dataset was published in 2020 . Tao et al.  used the filtered data from  with different frequency sets of [55-95] Hz, [14-70] Hz, and [5-95] Hz to compare all state-of-the-art models. They based their proposed model for EEG classification on the GRUGate Transformer. They achieved 61% accuracy on the high gamma band filtered data but reached only 49% with all band frequency data ([5-95] Hz). Table I compared the performance of all the previous studies that used the unfiltered as well as the correctly filtered EEG-ImageNet dataset.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: consists of multiple channels of time-series signals per sample or trial.
