      "content": "Paper Title: LUMINOUS: Indoor Scene Generation for Embodied AI Challenges\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLuminous builds on and extends research in indoor scene synthesis, simulation environments in EAI, and language-guided task completion. Indoor Scene Synthesis.\nIn computer graphics, extensive research exists in 3D indoor scene synthesis.\nEarly work either used explicit rule-based constraints \nor incorporated stochastic priors into the generative\nprocedure    .\nRecent advances [ref]19   utilize\ndeep neural networks to extract patterns from large-scale\ndatasets .\nWhile these data-driven approaches significantly enhance the automation of the scene generation process, the resulting synthesized scenes\nare still relatively simple in terms of object quantity and inter-object spatial\nrelationships.\nMany works generate scenes based on the natural representation of the scene graph  [ref]19 .\nOther lines of research condition on the image   or\ntext   representation of indoor scenes.\nThe discrepancies in the input representation of scene generation models and the\ndiverse sources of data make it difficult to compare and contrast the performance of different methods. To facilitate research in\nlearning-based approaches, Luminous is designed to support end-to-end scene generation evaluation and a unified rendering tool to accommodate the outputs of various approaches simultaneously. Embodied AI Simulators.\nIn the past few years, researchers have developed many simulation environments   [ref]13  [ref]9\nto serve as training and evaluation platforms for embodied agents. These simulation environments propel research progress in a wide\nrange of embodied tasks, including vision-and-language task\ncompletion  ,\nrearrangement  ,\nnavigation [ref]9 [ref]13,\nmanipulation   and human-robot\ncollaboration . Recently,\nAllenAct  integrates a set of embodied environments\n(such as iThor, RoboThor, Habitat [ref]9, etc.), tasks, and\nalgorithms thereby facilitating the evaluation of the\nsame model or algorithm across multiple EAI platforms. Many EAI platforms\nare designed with sophisticated indoor scenes to perform embodied tasks. Platforms such as\niGibson [ref]13, AI2Thor  can randomize materials,\ncolor, and small objects in the scene, while the basic room layouts remain unchanged.\nTo facilitate more robust and thorough evaluation of embodied agents,\nLuminous automatically generates indoor scenes with randomized layouts at a large scale that readily support vision-and-language navigation and high-level object interactions. We summarized the properties of Luminous and most popular EAI simulation platforms in Table 9. Language-Guided Task Completion.\nAmong existing EAI challenges, we use ALFRED  as\nour downstream exemplar task to evaluate the scene generation quality of Luminous. ALFRED enables agents to follow natural language descriptions to complete complex household tasks.\nALFRED tasks involve resolving vision-and-language grounding, affordance-aware navigation, and high-level object interactions. Roughly speaking, there are two categories of approaches to tackling ALFRED. Initial approaches learned end-to-end models that mapped language instructions into low-level actions directly   4.\nSubsequently, hierarchical approaches  5 were proposed that enabled better generalization and interpretation.\nHowever, those approaches are only tested in four indoor scenes unseen during training time.\nTowards a more convincing evaluation,\nLuminous generates an order of magnitude larger number of scenes for better assessment of generalization and robustness.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: extensive research exists in 3D indoor scene synthesis.\nEarly work either used explicit rule-based constraints \nor incorporated stochastic priors into the generative\nprocedure    .\nRecent advances [ref]19   utilize\ndeep neural networks to extract patterns from large-scale\ndatasets .\nWhile these data-driven approaches significantly enhance the automation of the scene generation process, the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
