      "content": "Paper Title: A trainable monogenic ConvNet layer robust in front of large contrast changes in image classification Under review\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOne of of the major features of the mammalian visual cortex is its built-in capacity to recognize objects independently of size, contrast, illumination, angle of view, or brightness, among other quantities [ref]1. Achieving an equivariance or invariance response to these transformations is an important goal in Deep Learning (DL)  . In fact, large contrast changes, such as the contrast of day and night, or as it appears in different sorts of glare, could be a problem in many DL applications such as self-driving cars , surface glazes in medical images , or day-round surveillance, among others. Among the ideas to overcome the illumination and the contrast variations in image classification problems, we find data augmentation¬†[ref]6 [ref]7. However, previous work indicates that learning of an invariant response may fail even with large data augmentations in the training process . In addition, the data augmentation techniques have three main problems¬† : i) it has to be tuned (manually) by human experts and in practice this causes large variances in the DL-model performance, ii) because of a lack of analytic tools (even for simple models), it is not well-understood how training on augmented data affects the learning process, iii) data augmentation approaches focus on improving the overall performance of a model, and it is often imperative to have a finer-grained perspective. This means that data augmentation techniques are required to mitigate the weak performance in dealing with the under-represented classes. Another common idea to tackle the contrast and illumination problems is the data normalization, such as local response normalization¬†. However, the main problem of these approaches appears when the change of illumination is non-uniform across the images in the data set¬†. Rad et al. proposed to use an adaptive local contrast normalization based on a window (region) difference of Gaussians for image detection. Although their approach is novel, the parameters of the Gaussian functions are based on the dataset illumination. As a result, for a new image with very different illumination the detection performance in general will be reduced. The usage of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) is capable of restoring contrast affected images¬† . Nevertheless, these architectures are primarily designed for visual restoration, not for image classification. The limitations of these approaches reveal opportunities to explore novel methods. In this work, we propose a new strategy to progress toward achieving contrast-illumination invariance in image classification tasks. Specifically, we present a new bio-inspired trainable layer, M6, which detects low-level geometric features (such as lines, edges and orientations) which are not unlike similar patterns detected by the V1 visual cortex . The M6 layer is based on the 2D extension of the analytic signal, called monogenic signal. As a result, each pixel value of an image I‚Äã(x,y)ùêºùë•ùë¶I(x,y) ‚ààùêëabsentùêë\\in\\mathbf{R} is mapped to a Hamilton quaternion ùêáùêá\\mathbf{H} (see Figure 1). The geometry of this approach has the remarkable simple property that the quality of the representation is not affected by large changes of the pixel intensities, a fact that confers a degree of explainability to the networks. On the experimental side, to evaluate the predictive performance and robustness of M6, we have simulated contrast changes in three different ways using four datasets (MNIST , Fashion MNIST , CIFAR-10 , and Dogs and Cats ) with three architectures: A1 (shallow), A2 (medium), and A3 (very deep). We compare the performance of M6 against a conventional ConvNets layer (C) and the Q9 layer¬†, which follows a close approach to handle contrast changes.\nTo evaluate the robustness response the models were trained with a specific data degradation and tested with other type of data degradations. The numerical results in the test set confirm that M6 achieves a remarkable resilient response to contrast variations when compared to standard convolution networks and with the Q9 approach. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, previous related works are acknowledged. Section 3 summarizes background materials concerning the local phase computation, the monogenic signal, and bio-inspired tools. In section 4, we present the computation aspects of the monogenic layer M6, and in Section 5 the data and experimental arrangements. The experimental outcomes and their analysis are described in Section 6, and the conclusions and future work in Section 7.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: of the major features of the mammalian visual cortex is its built-in capacity to recognize objects independently of size, contrast, illumination, angle of view, or brightness, among other quantities [ref]1.
