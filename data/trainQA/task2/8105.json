      "content": "Paper Title: LibMOON: A Gradient-based MultiObjective OptimizatioN Library in PyTorch\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMultiObjective Optimization problems (MOPs) are ubiquitous in machine learning. For instance, trustworthy machine learning (TML) includes fairness problems balancing the fairness level and the accuracy level  ;\nin robotics, it is necessary to balance several objectives (e.g., forward speed and energy consumption)   [ref]4; similarly, recommendation systems face potentially conflicting objectives, such as novelty, accuracy, and diversity   .\nFor all the applications above, the underlying optimization problem involves an MOP with m𝑚m objectives and can be (informally) defined as: where L1​(𝜽),…,Lm​(𝜽)subscript𝐿1𝜽…subscript𝐿𝑚𝜽L_{1}({\\bm{\\theta}}),\\ldots,L_{m}({\\bm{\\theta}}) denote m𝑚m (potentially) conflicting objectives and we denote the size of the model parameter as N≔|𝜽|≔𝑁𝜽N\\coloneqq|{\\bm{\\theta}}|. Note that as informally defined above, Equation 1 is a vector optimization problem that does not necessarily admit a total ordering. For non-trivial multiobjective problems, no single solution can attain the minimum of all objectives simultaneously. To compare two solutions for an MOP, we introduce the concepts of dominance and Pareto optimality .\nDominance occurs when solution 𝜽(a)superscript𝜽𝑎{\\bm{\\theta}}^{(a)} satisfies Li​(𝜽(a))≤Li​(𝜽(b))subscript𝐿𝑖superscript𝜽𝑎subscript𝐿𝑖superscript𝜽𝑏L_{i}({\\bm{\\theta}}^{(a)})\\leq L_{i}({\\bm{\\theta}}^{(b)}) for all 1≤i≤m1𝑖𝑚1\\leq i\\leq m, with at least one strict inequality Lj​(𝜽(a))<Lj​(𝜽(b))subscript𝐿𝑗superscript𝜽𝑎subscript𝐿𝑗superscript𝜽𝑏L_{j}({\\bm{\\theta}}^{(a)})<L_{j}({\\bm{\\theta}}^{(b)}).\nA solution is Pareto optimal if no other solution in the feasible region dominates it. The set of all Pareto optimal solutions is the Pareto set (PS), and its image is the Pareto front (PF). Over the last few decades, multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) emerged as a widely used methodology for addressing MOPs.\nDue to their population-level designs, MOEAs can identify a diverse set of Pareto optimal solutions that approximate and represent the entire PF of a given MOP.\nSeveral libraries have emerged as standard platforms for fair comparison of MOEAs, including PlatEMO  (in Matlab supporting over 160 MOEAs), Pagmo 0 (in C++), and Pymoo 1 (in Python). Compared to MOEAs, gradient-based multiobjective optimization (MOO) methods are particularly suitable designed for large-scale machine learning tasks involving thousands to millions of neural network parameters. While these methods can find Pareto stationary solutions—solutions that cannot be locally improved in any objective—they are also effective approximators of Pareto solutions for nonconvex models, including deep neural networks 2. In this paper, we roughly divide recent gradient-based MOO methods into two main groups.\nThe first one focuses on finding a finite set of Pareto solutions to approximately represent the entire PF. Examples include Upper Bounded Multiple Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA-UB) 3 and Exact Pareto Optimization (EPO) 4. The second, known as\nPareto set learning (PSL) 5 6 7, develops a single neural model parameterized by ϕbold-italic-ϕ{\\bm{\\phi}} to represent the entire Pareto set. Since the parameter space of ϕbold-italic-ϕ{\\bm{\\phi}} is large, thus PSL is usually optimized by gradient-based methods. With the growing use of gradient-based MOO methods in neural networks 3 8 [ref]4 6 9 0 1, there is a pressing need for a standard library to benchmark comparisons and developments. To fulfill this demand, we introduce LibMOON, a gradient-based Multi-Objective Optimization Library supporting over twenty state-of-the-art methods. We summarize our contributions as follows: We propose the first modern gradient-based MOO library, called LibMOON. LibMOON is implemented under the PyTorch framework 2 and carefully designed to support GPU acceleration. LibMOON supports synthetic problems and a wide range of real-world multiobjective machine learning tasks (e.g., fair classification and multiobjective classification problems). LibMOON supports over twenty state-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based MOO methods for constructing Pareto optimal solution sets, including those using finite solutions to approximate the whole PS/PF 4 9, PSL methods 6 5 aimed at approximating the entire Pareto set with a single neural network, and MOBO methods that designed to avoid frequent function evaluations. LibMOON has already been open-sourced at https://github.com/xzhang2523/libmoon with document at https://libmoondocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/, offering a reliable platform for comparing SOTA gradient-based MOO approaches and providing standard multiobjective testing benchmarks. Beyond examining its source code, LibMOON can be installed via pip install libmoon as an off-the-shelf gradient-based multiobjective tool.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: (TML) includes fairness problems balancing the fairness level and the accuracy level  ;\nin robotics, it is necessary to balance several objectives (e.g., forward speed and energy consumption)   [ref]4; similarly, recommendation systems face potentially conflicting objectives, such as novelty, accuracy, and diversity   .\nFor all the applications above, the underlying optimization problem\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
