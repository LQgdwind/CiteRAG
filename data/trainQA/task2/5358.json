Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: FPANet: Frequency-based Video Demoiréing using Frame-level Post Alignment\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, learning in the frequency domain has been widely studied in various fields    [ref]23  [ref]25    [ref]29   . Some of these methods   [ref]23 applied the spectral block correspondence to the vanilla convolution block where they utilize each grid value, which is associated with the frequency components. This is advantageous to leverage a much larger receptive field than the conventional convolution operations. Also, FcaNet  proposed frequency channel attention using the discrete cosine transform (DCT) to compress each feature over pre-defined DCT bases. Cai et al.  suggests the usefulness of amplitude and phase information for generating photo-realistic images in the generative models. Given this, Focal Frequency Loss  is utilized as a regularizer for the generative models. Also, FSDGN [ref]25 uses amplitude information to guide restoring the original image with haze. However, they separate spatial and frequency branches with the unidirectional flow (i.e. frequency to spatial) that can not fully use both information. LaMa [ref]29 shows remarkable performance in the inpainting task with Fast Fourier Convolution , which has the advantage of recovering repetitive structures such as fences. We also follow this line of work where we exploit amplitude and phase components separately via our proposed Frequency Selection Module (FSM) for the video demoiréing task.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: Recently, learning in the frequency domain has been widely studied in various fields    [ref]23  [ref]25    [ref]29   .
