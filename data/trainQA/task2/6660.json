      "content": "Paper Title: UniFormaly: Towards Task-Agnostic Unified Framework for Visual Anomaly Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOver the past decade, deep learning approaches, such as reconstruction or self-supervised learning, have gained prominence in addressing various anomaly detection tasks. Reconstruction-based approaches [ref]41 [ref]39 assume that anomalies cannot be accurately reconstructed, while self-supervised learning-based approaches rely on augmentations of normal images   . Specifically,  [ref]41 combines elements of both by incorporating the inpainting task within an autoencoder. While the two approaches focus on learning normal representations from scratch, recent methods leverage rich representations from encoders pre-trained on large-scale image datasets. Several works propose to adapt pre-trained features for anomaly detection  . In  , feature adaptation is achieved through the use of compactness loss and joint optimization, and   leverages an additional feature estimation network to maximize feature correspondence. Other works use off-the-shelf representations and feed them into a normal feature memory bank to determine anomalies   7. In this line of work, it is important to make the memory bank compact but highly representative.   uses image-level representations for anomaly detection and reduces the size of the memory bank by reusing them for anomaly localization.   computes statistical estimates for normal features, and  7 summarizes the memory bank with coreset subsampling. These approaches based on off-the-shelf representations have gained popularity due to their simplicity and effectiveness. However, despite their effectiveness, previous approaches in the literature have been developed in a fragmented manner with a lack of attempts for unification. While  [ref]39 unifies models across classes into a single architecture, it does not address grouping anomalies or detecting anomalies in high-resolution natural images. In contrast, our method achieves unified detection at various anomaly levels and enables clustering of anomalies arising in subtle regions. Furthermore, our method handles low normal-shot anomaly detection, making it more practical for real-world unified anomaly detection systems. In pre-trained encoder-based methods, it is critical to generate effective feature maps for anomaly detection. This issue encompasses two factors: encoder architecture and feature aggregation. While supervised ConvNets are widely used in pre-trained encoder-based methods, we explore alternative representation choices for anomaly detection. As for feature aggregation, previous pre-trained encoder methods often use a feature map from the last layer without aggregation  or employ rescaling and subsequent concatenation  for aggregation. However, more sophisticated feature aggregation techniques are required for defect detection. Recent approach 7 has introduced more complex feature aggregation methods that leverage local neighborhoods with a fixed window size and apply adaptive pooling in the channel dimension. Despite the significant improvement in defect detection performance, it is complex and sensitive to hyperparameters such as neighborhood size and pooling dimension, limiting scalability across various tasks or datasets. In contrast, UniFormaly simplifies feature aggregation with minimal hyperparameters, leading to robustness across datasets and tasks. Patch-level anomaly learning has gained prominence in image anomaly detection, where images are treated as collections of patches. This method computes anomaly scores for individual patches, typically through explicit feature training. For instance,   employs Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) for patch-level anomaly detection, and   extends this with mini-batch K-means clustering and metric learning. Moreover,   incorporates density estimation using the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for clustering. In contrast, some approaches   7 integrate patch-level representations with offline encoders, utilizing nearest neighbor retrieval from a memory bank of normal features. However, these offline encoder-based methods primarily focus on subtle defect detection and do not address semantic anomaly detection, which involves identifying higher-level anomalies. To bridge this gap, our approach extends patch-level anomaly learning with Back Patch Masking and top-k ratio feature matching, enabling task-agnostic anomaly detection and the identification of higher-level anomalies.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: the past decade, deep learning approaches, such as reconstruction or self-supervised learning, have gained prominence in addressing various anomaly detection tasks.
