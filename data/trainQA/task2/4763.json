      "content": "Paper Title: Public Transit Arrival Prediction: a Seq2Seq RNN Approach†\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nData-driven methods, instead of adopting a detailed modeling based on physics of\nthe traffic, typically employ a\ncoarse model (based on measurable entities) that is good enough for the prediction problem at hand.\nThere exist a class of methods which utilize a\ndata-based model but do not perform learning based on historical data in a full-fledged sense. Rest of the approaches learn from past historical\ndata to estimate the necessary parameters of a suitable predictive model, which is employed further for real-time predictions. Without Learning: This is a class of methods which don’t learn from historical-data explicitly.\nOne of the earliest approaches (using a Kalman filter) was proposed in , which used travel times of previous bus and travel times from previous day (same time), as\ninputs. The method captures temporal dependencies only with an adhoc parameter choice in the state space model.\nThe later approaches which employ a linear state-space model involving travel times, calibrate (or fix) the data-based model parameters in real time. These parameters are chosen either based on (a)\ncurrent data of previous bus   or (b)a suitable optimal travel-time data vector from the historical data-base . Explicit Learning: The literature has seen a wide variety of learning methods from historical data. For instance,\nsupport vector regression  and feed-forward\nANN  based methods have been proposed\nwhich capture only temporal correlations via multiple previous bus travel times.\nAn SVR based prediction with static inputs like link length and dynamic inputs like rate of road usage and speed is proposed in .\nHowever it doesn’t consider current bus position OR the previous bus inputs.\n proposes a speed based prediction scheme using a weighted average of historically averaged section speed and current bus speed as inputs, while ignores\ninformation from previous bus as earlier.\n considers a dynamic SVR based prediction scheme where current bus’s travel time at the previous section and previous bus’s travel time at the current section are\nconsidered as inputs during training.\nThis scheme exploits both\nspatial and temporal correlations in the data in a minimal way. A single hidden layer feed-forward ANN is trained in [ref]12 based on current position of the bus and time\nof query to predict arrival times across\nall subsequent stops. It learns a single model to predict travel times between any two bus stops on the route.\nThis renders the target travel time variable’s dynamic range very large in this method.\nA recent approach capturing spatio-temporal correlations based on linear\nstatistical models (non-stationary) was proposed in  which uses a linear kalman filter for prediction across sections. It uses linear models to\ncapture the spatial correlations. The temporal correlations come from the (currently plying) previous bus section travel time. Another approach using linear statistical models and exploiting real-time temporal correlations (from previous buses) was proposed in . A nonlinear generalization of  using support vector function\napproximators capturing spatio-temporal correlations was proposed in . CNN based approach capturing spatio-temporal correlations\nwas proposed\nin  recently where the conditional predictive distributions were parameterized using masked-CNNs. The CNN output modeled the travel-time\nbetween any two bus-stops in a quantized form. An interesting approach based on combining CNNs and RNNs is provided in . In particular the convolutional layer captures the (one-dimensional) spatial correlations from the\nadjacent sections of the 1-D route,\nwhile the recurrent structure captures the temporal correlations. A convolutional-RNN based\nED architecture\nis employed to capture accurate multi time-step predictions.  considers an attention-based extension of .  considers a simplified RNN\nwith no state feedback (in spite of weight sharing across time-steps) with attention, but only models single time-step predictions. In all these three RNN approaches, the time axis is\npartitioned uniformly into time bins (of width 151515-min). A recent computationally interesting approach where BATP is recast as a value function estimation problem under a suitably constructed Markov reward process is proposed in . This enables\nexploring a family of value-function predictors using temporal-difference (TD) learning.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: section are\nconsidered as inputs during training.\nThis scheme exploits both\nspatial and temporal correlations in the data in a minimal way. A single hidden layer feed-forward ANN is trained in [ref]12 based on current position of the bus and time\nof query to predict arrival times across\nall subsequent stops. It learns a single model to predict travel times between any two bus stops on the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
