      "content": "Paper Title: Similarity-aware Positive Instance Sampling for Graph Contrastive Pre-training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPre-training on graph data has received wide interests in recent years, with a large range of insightful works focused on learning universal graph structural patterns lying in different kinds of graph data [ref]26 [ref]15  . For instance, Hu et al. [ref]15 pre-train graph neural networks on molecules and transfer the learned model to molecular graph classification tasks, while Qiu et al. [ref]26 pioneer pre-training on big graphs.\nCompared with traditional\nsemi-supervised or supervised training methods for graph neural networks [ref]12    , pre-training tasks formulate the training objective without the access of training labels, and they empower graph neural networks to be generalized to unseen graphs or nodes with no or minor fine-tuning training cost. How to define proper pre-training tasks comes as the principal and also the most challenging part in graph self-supervised learning. Among current works, graph instance contrastive learning based pre-training tasks have been proved effective to learn graph strcutrual information [ref]26 .\nIt preforms contrast between positive/negative instance pairs extracted from real graphs observed in the dataset.\nThough positive pairs for graph contrastive learning seems easy to define for those tasks not performed on graph instances, like DeepWalk , node2vec , where near node-node pairs are treated as positive pairs and Infomax based models like DGI , InfoGraph , where node-graph pairs from a same graph are treated as positive pairs, it is not the case for graph instance contrastive learning.\nAttempts from previous literature mainly focus on devising suitable graph augmentation methods, such as graph sampling [ref]26 , node dropping , edge perturbation , and diffusion graph  to get positive graph instances from the original graph.\nDespite the achievements they have made using such graph data augmentation strategies,\nwe assume that such perturbation based graph data augmentation methods are not universal strategies to get ideal positive samples preserving necessary information for graph contrastive learning for various kinds of graph data such as molecular graphs, social graphs, and academic graphs. We make our assumptions on the necessary information that should be preserved in positive instances in the contrastive learning process, which though have not been proved theoretically, are reasonable and are arrived from the re-thinking of the purpose and inherent principle of the contrastive learning and what should positive samples preserve to get an effective method.\nSuch unproved but reasonable assumptions for positive instances are as follows:\n Positive instances should be semantically similar with the target instance; Positive samples for the same target instance should also be similar with each other; Positive instances should preserve certain domain information if necessary. Based on such assumptions, we can see that some widely used graph data augmentation strategies cannot always get positive instances with such properties preserved when being applied on different kinds of graph data.\nAs shown in Fig. 1,\nsimple edge-perturbation or node-dropping for molecular graph contrastive learning strategies can hardly get legal graph instances given the fact that molecules are specifically formulated in accordance to strict chemical constraints which will be easily broken if some edges/nodes, even of a very small number, are perturbed.\nMoreover, subgraph sampling strategy, though effective when applied on graphs without node/edge attributes, may always lead to positive instances that are dissimilar with the target instance when applied on molecular graphs.\nStatistical results for subgraph sampling and another data augmentation strategy suffering from similar problems – attribute masking, are presented in Appendix A.5.1. Thus, in this paper, we move beyond the widely used graph data augmentation strategies for an effective and more universal method to get positive graph instances for graph instance contrastive learning.\nWe propose a simple but effective similarity based positive instances sampling strategy that can be applied on various kinds of graph data. Unlike previous methods that construct contrastive pairs by\ngraph augmentation, our method encodes the pair-wise similarity information, measured by certain domain-specific similarity/proximity, into a hierarchical structure and selects positive graph instances\nfrom such a structure\nwhich ultimately maintains the legality of the sampled instances and high similarity to the target graphs (see Appendix C for details).\nMoreover, we also propose an improvement for a widely-used node-level pre-training strategy [ref]15, which, together with our similarity aware graph positive sampling strategy, brings us an upper strategy design philosophy. That is, the necessary of introducing prior knowledge or bias in random strategies. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative kinds of graph data: molecular graphs, social graphs as well as big social and academic graphs where nodes are of interest to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed sampling based strategy over previous graph contrastive learning strategies and also some other strategies not based on contrastive learning for different kinds of graph data.\nBesides, some additional experiments which try to transfer the GNN models pre-trained on molecular graph dataset to downstream social graph classification task let us have a glimpse of the potential possibility of the pre-trained models’ ability to capture universal graph structural information underlying different kinds of graph data as well as the possibility to get such a universally transferable pre-trained model.\nSimilar things have been explored in other domains such as multi-lingual language models. However, to our best knowledge, we are the first to propose such possibility for pre-trained GNN models, which, though lacks further and thorough exploration in the paper, can probably point out a new possibly meaningful research direction and cast light on successive work.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: on graph data has received wide interests in recent years, with a large range of insightful works focused on learning universal graph structural patterns lying in different kinds of graph data [ref]26 [ref]15  .
