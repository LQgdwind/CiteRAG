      "content": "Paper Title: The Exponential-Time Complexity of the complex weighted #CSP\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA series of dichotomies of #CSP have been developed, which is about either the problem polynomial time solvable or #P-hard. Such dichotomies are also called “FP vs #P-hard” type. Creignou and Hermann have proved that #CSP(ℱℱ\\mathscr{F}) can be solved in polynomial time only if every function in ℱℱ\\mathscr{F} is affine when ℱ={F:{0,1}k→{0,1}}ℱconditional-set𝐹→superscript01𝑘01\\mathscr{F}=\\{F:\\{0,1\\}^{k}\\to\\{0,1\\}\\} 1. The tractable condition is ℱ⊆{F\\mathscr{F}\\subseteq\\{F — F𝐹F is pure-affine}}\\} or ℱ⊆{F\\mathscr{F}\\subseteq\\{F — F𝐹F is product-type}}\\} when the value domain of ℱℱ\\mathscr{F} expands to ℚℚ\\mathbb{Q}  . Cai ,Lu and Xia defined two tractable classes 𝒜𝒜\\mathscr{A} and 𝒫𝒫\\mathscr{P} of complex weighted Boolean #CSP [ref]7. Cai and Chen developed such dichotomy to a natural culmination. They generalized above results and found the tractable condition of complex weighted #CSP with variables assigned in any finite domain [ref]4. Based on the results of complex weighted Boolean #CSP, more tractable classes of Boolean Holant problems have been discovered further. The dichotomies, of complex Holant* , non-negative Holant , real Holantc , complex Holantc  and Real Holant , are gradually proposed. Besides of the two general framework, there are also interesting researches on some special counting problems, like the complexity analysis for six-vertex model , graph homomorphism 6. Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH 7 8) is a better-known and widely-believed hypothesis, which says the satisfiability of 3-CNF formulas cannot be\ndecided in time e​x​p​(o​(n))𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑛exp(o(n)). The parameter n𝑛n is the number of variables, and it can be replaced by the number of constraints according Sparsification Lemma 8. This hypothesis is used to find more tight lower bound of NP-hard problems. Dell et al. relaxed it to the counting version (#ETH) and obtained sub-exponential lower bound of Tutte polynomial and the permanent problem when assuming #ETH holds 4. Curticapean showed a 2o​(n)superscript2𝑜𝑛2^{o(n)} time algorithm for some concrete counting problems would violate #ETH, with using the idea of block interpolation 2. #ETH causes the interest of whether existed “FP vs #P-hard” dichotomies have the same tractable condition as their “FP vs #ETH-hard” variant. It is yes for Boolean weighted Boolean #CSP  and counting graph homomorphism 0.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: is product-type}}\\} when the value domain of ℱℱ\\mathscr{F} expands to ℚℚ\\mathbb{Q}  .
