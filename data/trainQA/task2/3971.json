      "content": "Paper Title: How Powerful are ùêæ-hop Message Passing Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExpressive power of GNN. Analyzing the expressive power of GNNs is a crucial problem as it can serve as a guide on how to improve GNNs. Xu et¬†al. [ref]7 and Morris et¬†al. [ref]11 first proved that the power of 1-hop message passing is bounded by the 1-WL test. In other words, 1-hop message passing cannot distinguish any non-isomorphic graphs that the 1-WL test fails to. In recent years, many efforts have been put into increasing the expressive power of 1-hop messaging passing. The first line of research tries to mimic the higher-order WL tests, like 1-2-3 GNN¬†[ref]11, PPGN¬†[ref]24, ring-GNN¬†. However, they require exponentially increasing space and time complexity w.r.t. node number and cannot be generalized to large-scale graphs. The second line of research tries to enhance the rooted subtree of 1-WL with additional features. Some works¬†   add one-hot or random features into nodes. Although they achieve good results in some settings, they deteriorate the generalization ability as such features produce different representations for nodes even with the same local graph structure. Some works like Distance Encoding¬†, SEAL¬†, labeling trick¬† and GLASS¬† introduce node labeling based on either distance or distinguishing target node set. On the other hand, GraphSNN¬† introduces a hierarchy of local isomorphism and proposes structural coefficients as additional features to identify such local isomorphism. However, the function designed to approximate the structural coefficient cannot fully achieve its theoretical power. The third line of research resorts to subgraph representation. Specifically, ID-GNN¬† extracts ego-netwok for each node and labels the root node with a different color. NGNN¬† encodes a rooted subgraph instead of a rooted subtree by subgraph pooling thus achieving superior expressive power on distinguishing regular graphs. GNN-AK¬† applies a similar idea as NGNN. The only difference lies in how to compute the node representation from the local subgraph. However, such methods need to run an inner GNN on every node of the graph thus introducing much more computation overhead. Meanwhile, the expressive power of subgraph GNNs are bounded by 3-WL¬†. KùêæK-hop message passing GNN.\nThere are some existing works that instantiate the KùêæK-hop message passing framework. For example, MixHop¬† performs message passing on each hop with graph diffusion kernel and concatenates the representation on each hop as the final representation. K-hop¬† sequentially performs the message passing from hop K to hop 1 to compute the representation of the center node. However, it is not parallelizable due to its computational procedure. MAGNA¬† introduces an attention mechanism to KùêæK-hop message passing. GPR-GNN¬† use graph diffusion kernel to perform graph convolution on KùêæK-hop and aggregate them with learnable parameters. However, none of them give a formal definition of KùêæK-hop message passing and theoretically analyze its representation power and limitations.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Expressive power of GNN.
