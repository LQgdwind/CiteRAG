      "content": "Paper Title: Evolving Constrained Reinforcement Learning Policy\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nReinforcement learning (RL) has shown strong competence in several domains, such as games   . However, RL algorithms suffer from the temporal credit assignment problem with sparse reward, instability and inefficient sampling that often occur in real-world problems [ref]4 [ref]5. To tackle these issues, Khadka and Tumer [ref]5 proposed a hybrid algorithm, called evolutionary reinforcement learning (ERL). ERL evolves a population of actors which are used to generate diverse experiences for training an RL agent and periodically injects the agent’s gradient information into the corresponding evolutionary algorithm (EA). ERL outperforms some state-of-the-art RL algorithms and EA on some unconstrained robot control problems [ref]5. Most RL algorithms are based on the Markov decision process (MDP) [ref]4, which does not consider any constraint at all. When addressing real-world problems with constraints, such as constrained robot control problems [ref]6 and autonomous vehicle ,\nan RL agent may learn a policy that achieves a high reward but violates one or more constraints. Though ERL was originally not designed for constrained optimisation problems, the experience diversity introduced by ERL has the potential to achieve higher performance in handling constrained problems. It is intuitive to combine ERL and constraint reinforcement learning (CRL) approaches to address constrained problems. However, when adopting both classic and state-of-the-art CRL approaches, such as the reward shape method  and reward constrained policy optimisation (RCPO) [ref]6, to ERL, the dilemma between reward and constraint violation is observed (cf. Fig. 3). This can be explained by the conflicting behaviour of EA and RL.\nAs the CRL approach manipulates the RL agent only, the RL agent learns the policy with both reward and constraints while the EA evaluates and selects actors considering reward only [ref]5. Thus, the agent, expected to maximise the reward and minimise the constraint violation, learns from experiences sampled by the actors of the EA’s population, which ignore constraints. More specifically, the EA and RL components of ERL sample experiences from two distributions with different concerns, one over reward only and the other over both reward and constraints. When most of the experience buffer is reward-only experiences, the gradient will be directed to optimise reward only.\nThe dilemma between the reward and constraint violation as well as the presence of the conflicting behaviour of EA and RL suggests that simply applying CRL techniques to ERL is not enough. The actor selection in EA should consider both rewards and constraints. In this paper, we propose to consider both reward and constraints during actor selection through stochastic ranking  and design an evolutionary constrained reinforcement learning (ECRL) algorithm. ECRL inherits remarkable properties of ERL [ref]5 and leverages stochastic ranking  to rank the actors while balancing their rewards and constraint violations. Additionally, to provide diverse experiences with constraint information for the RL agent, ECRL adopts the Lagrangian relaxation method and introduces a multiplier for each individual in the population. The multipliers are updated and improved using an extra constraint buffer that stores historical episodic constraints. The contributions of this paper are summarised as follows: We determine the phenomenon of the conflicting behaviour that occurs when incorporating constrained RL into ERL. The necessary coordination of evolutionary constraint handling techniques is emphasised. We introduce stochastic ranking and Lagrange multiplier to ERL, which enable ERL to deal with constrained problems and tackle the conflicting behaviour. A constraint buffer is introduced, which maintains a set of historically Lagrangian multipliers that the RL agent can consult every now and then when selecting actors. Experiments conducted over robotic control benchmarks validate the occurrence of conflicting behaviours and demonstrates that our ECRL performs better than several state-of-the-art algorithms including ERL, variants of ERL using different CRL approaches, and state-of-the-art algorithm for constrained problems. An ablation study is also presented. ECRL requires no prior knowledge and is easy to implement.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: domains, such as games   .
