      "content": "Paper Title: Adversarial Transfer Learning for Punctuation Restoration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPre-trained BERT models are released by Google333https://github.com/google-research/bert, implemented with the TensorFlow toolkit . The pre-trained models include two kinds of models444https://github.com/google-research/bert#pre-trained-models: BERT-Large and BERT-Base.\nThe size of our experimental data is not large. Therefore, we use the Uncased BERT-Base model to initialize the BERT-BLSTM-CRF models. Uncased means that any case and accent markers are stripped out. The basic architecture of the BERT-Base model is shown at the bottom of Fig. 1 or Fig. 2.\nThe encoder has a stack of N=12𝑁12N=12 identical layers.\nThe heads hℎh of the parallel self-attention are 12.\nFor each of these heads, we set dk=dv=dm​o​d​e​l/h=64subscript𝑑𝑘subscript𝑑𝑣subscript𝑑𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙ℎ64d_{k}=d_{v}=d_{model}/h=64.\nBecause of the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality. In order to use residual connections, we set dm​o​d​e​l=768subscript𝑑𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙768d_{model}=768.\nThe positional encodings have the same dimension dm​o​d​e​lsubscript𝑑𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙d_{model} as the embeddings layers. So the two can be sumed. The total parameters of the BERT-Base is 110M. Please see [ref]24 for pre-training details of the BERT-Base model. The configuration of BLSTM-CRF layers is based on the work in , where there are one BLSTM layer and a CRF layer.\nThe BLSTM layer has peephole connections and a recurrent projection layer. There are two directions in the BLSTM layer: forward and backward.\nEach direction is a regular LSTM layer. The LSTM layer consists of 240 memory cells and the recurrent projection layer would project the output to 120 dimensions.\nWe initialize the BLSTM layer by the range (-0.02, 0.02) with a uniform distribution.\nApart from clipping the activations of memory cells to range [-50, 50], the activations of other units, the weights or the estimated gradients are not limited. The development sets are utilized for validation. If only a little improvement between two epochs on the development set has been observed, the training terminates.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: positional encodings have the same dimension dm​o​d​e​lsubscript𝑑𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙d_{model} as the embeddings layers.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
