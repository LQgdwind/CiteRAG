      "content": "Paper Title: Can a Fruit Fly Learn Word Embeddings?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur aim here is to demonstrate that the fruit fly word embeddings are competitive with existing state-of-the-art binarization methods applied to GloVe and word2vec embeddings. We show this by evaluating the semantic similarity of static word embeddings, using several common benchmark datasets: WS353 , MEN , RW , SimLex , RG-65 [ref]38, and Mturk . These datasets contain pairs of words with human-annotated similarity scores between them. Specifically, we compare with GloVe [ref]34 word embeddings222pretrained embeddings: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove trained on Wiki2014 and Gigaword 5, GloVe embeddings trained on OpenWebText Corpus  and word2vec embeddings333pretrained embeddings: https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec. Since our representations are binary (in contrast to GloVe and word2vec), we binarize GloVe and word2vec embeddings and report their performance using a number of common hashing methods, LSH/SimHash  (random contractive projections followed by binarization based on sign), RandExp  (random expansive projections followed by kùëòk-winner take all binarization),\nITQ [ref]16 (iterative quantization), SH (spectral hashing) 6, PCAH [ref]16 (PCA followed by binarization based on sign). Where available, we include evaluation from NLB, ‚ÄúNear-Lossless Binarization‚Äù 3 (autoencoder-based binarization). Following previous work [43; 42], model similarity score for binary representations is evaluated as s‚Äãi‚Äãm‚Äã(v1,v2)=(n11+n00)/nùë†ùëñùëösubscriptùë£1subscriptùë£2subscriptùëõ11subscriptùëõ00ùëõsim(v_{1},v_{2})=(n_{11}+n_{00})/n, where n11subscriptùëõ11n_{11} (n00subscriptùëõ00n_{00}) is the number of bits in v1subscriptùë£1v_{1} and v2subscriptùë£2v_{2} that are both 111 (00), and nùëõn is the length of v1,2subscriptùë£12v_{1,2}. Cosine similarity is used for real-valued representations. The results are reported in Tables 7, 8 and 9. For each dataset, we report performance across a range of hash lengths {4,8,16,32,64,128}48163264128\\{4,8,16,32,64,128\\}. For methods that incorporate randomness (LSH, RandExp, ITQ), we report the average across 5 runs. ITQ, SH and PCAH in Tables 7 and 8 were trained using the top 400k most frequent words. Table 9 compares our method to GloVe trained on OpenWebText (same dataset that our method is trained on) using the same vocabulary as our method uses. Our binary word embeddings demonstrate competitive performance compared to published methods for GloVe and word2vec binarization, and our algorithm can learn meaningful binary semantic representations directly from raw text.\nImportantly, our algorithm does not require training GloVe or word2vec embeddings first before binarizing them.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: applied to GloVe and word2vec embeddings.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
