      "content": "Paper Title: PrivHAR: Recognizing Human Actions From Privacy-preserving Lens\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo measure the overall performance of PrivHAR, we evaluate the action recognition task and privacy protection separately. First, to test action recognition, we pass the testing videos through our designed camera lens O‚Äã(‚ãÖ)ùëÇ‚ãÖO(\\cdot) to obtain the private videos. Next, we use our learned HAR backbone C‚Äã(‚ãÖ)ùê∂‚ãÖC(\\cdot) to get the predicted actions on each private video. Similarly as C3D , and RubiksNet , we report the standard average classification accuracy, denoted by ACsubscriptùê¥ùê∂A_{C}. On the other hand, to evaluate privacy protection, we follow the same evaluation protocol adopted by authors in . Specifically, assuming that an attacker has access to the set of private videos acquired with our O‚Äã(‚ãÖ)ùëÇ‚ãÖO(\\cdot) and the corresponding privacy attribute labels, then, the attacker can train different CNNs to try to steal sensitive information from the privacy-protected videos acquired with our camera. To empirically verify that our protection is robust to this kind of attack, we separately train ten different classification networks using the private images acquired with our camera, i.e., these CNNs are different from the selected CNN used during training. To train these networks, we use the same training set defined in the previous section and fix our camera component with the optimal learned parameters Œ∏o‚àósuperscriptsubscriptùúÉùëú\\theta_{o}^{*}. We use the following architectures: ResNet-{50,101}50101\\left\\{50,101\\right\\}, Wide-ResNet-{50,101}50101\\left\\{50,101\\right\\} , MobileNet-V2 , Inception-{V1,V3}V1V3\\left\\{\\text{V1},\\text{V3}\\right\\}[ref]47 , MNASNet-{0.5,0.75,1.0}0.50.751.0\\left\\{0.5,0.75,1.0\\right\\}. Among these CNNs, eight randomly selected networks start from ImageNet-pretrained weights. The remaining two models were trained from scratch (random initialization) to eliminate the possibility that the initialization with ImageNet weights affects the correct predictions. After training, we evaluate each model on our defined testing set (videos from PA-HMDB51) and select the model with the highest performance. Similar to previous works [ref]10  [ref]57 , we adopt the Class-based Mean Average Precision (C-MAP) to assess the performance of the models. Specifically, we compute the Average Precision (AP) per class, which is the area under the Precision-Recall curve of the privacy-related attribute. Hence, C-MAP corresponds to the average of the AP scores across all the privacy-related attributes. We also denote C-MAP as AAsubscriptùê¥ùê¥A_{A} in our experiments (lower is better). To measure image degradation, we use the structural similarity index (SSIM) metric . Large values of SSIM indicate high quality. Thus, in general, we expect to achieve the minimum SSIM values while achieving high ACsubscriptùê¥ùê∂A_{C} and low AAsubscriptùê¥ùê¥A_{A} for HAR and Adversarial accuracy, respectively. Besides, we combine the two accuracy metrics (ACsubscriptùê¥ùê∂A_{C} and AAsubscriptùê¥ùê¥A_{A}) into one using the harmonic mean as:\n and we expect to achieve the maximum PùëÉP value.\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: We use the following architectures: ResNet-{50,101}50101\\left\\{50,101\\right\\}, Wide-ResNet-{50,101}50101\\left\\{50,101\\right\\} , MobileNet-V2 , Inception-{V1,V3}V1V3\\left\\{\\text{V1},\\text{V3}\\right\\}[ref]47 , MNASNet-{0.5,0.75,1.0}0.50.751.0\\left\\{0.5,0.75,1.0\\right\\}.
