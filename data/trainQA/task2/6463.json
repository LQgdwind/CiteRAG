      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Polychromatic Neural Representation for CT Metal Artifact Reduction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nComputed tomography (CT) is a widely-used imaging technique for clinical diagnosis. CT measurements are produced by passing X-rays at different angles through the human body. Reconstruction of CT images from these measurements is often approximately modeled as a linear inverse problem . However, the attenuation coefficients of the metal materials dramatically vary with the X-ray spectral energy, which largely differs from those of human body tissues. This results in a non-negligible nonlinear metal effect in the CT measurements when the body carries metallic implants . Hence, recovering CT images from metal-affect measurements is a complicated nonlinear inverse problem. However, linear inverse problem algorithms, e.g., filtered back projection (FBP) , always lead to severe artifacts in the resulting CT images. These artifacts can greatly hamper the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Many efforts have been made for CT metal artifact reduction (MAR) task . Most studies   [ref]7   0 1 2 simplify this task as a linear inverse problem by designing various schemes to replace metal-affected extreme value signals (i.e., metal traces) in the measurements, which unfortunately results in significant degradation of the CT reconstruction due to the signal loss. Currently, supervised deep learning (DL) approaches [ref]7  3 4 5 6 7  are the mainstream MAR solutions. Supervised methods typically tend to learn mappings from metal-corrupted measurements to artifact-free CT images by training deep neural networks on a large-scale external dataset. However, related works face two main limitations. First, collecting numerous paired metal-corrupted measurements and high-quality CT images for training is resource-intensive and laborious. Second, if the metal shapes and the CT acquisition settings differ from those in the training dataset, performance may significantly decline. These challenges significantly limit the practical application of supervised MAR methods in clinical scenarios. Implicit neural representation (INR) is a new paradigm to solve inverse problems 8. It uses a multi-layer perception (MLP) to model an underlying signal by mapping coordinates to signal responses. The learning bias of the MLPs towards low-frequency signal components 9 0 is considered as an implicit regularization term for the inverse problems. By approximately simulating the CT acquisition forward model as a linear integral, INR has achieved significant progress in the linear sparse-view CT reconstruction 1 2 3 4 5 6. However, its potential for tackling the nonlinear inverse problem, such as the MAR task, remains unexplored. In this work, we aim to address the issue of MAR in CT scans from a nonlinear perspective. This allows us to use the complete measurement signals (i.e., including metal traces) and thus achieve better CT reconstruction performance. Specifically, we model the MAR as a polychromatic (i.e., multiple X-ray spectral energy levels) reconstruction task of CT image. This task is a highly ill-posed nonlinear inverse problem. To address this, we propose Polychromatic neural representation (Polyner), a novel extension of INR for the nonlinear problems. In our Polyner, we make three key designs. First, we derive a forward model that accurately simulates the polychromatic nonlinear CT acquisition process. Second, we define a regularization term that effectively constrains the solution space by preserving the physical properties of the CT images across different spectral energy levels. Third, we incorporate our forward model into the INR, granting its capacity to solve the nonlinear inverse problem. Meanwhile, the continuous prior brought by INR also contributes to a more stable solution. Our Polyner is an unsupervised method and does not require any external training data, which makes it potentially applicable to a wide range of CT imaging scenarios. We evaluate the performance of our Polyner on three datasets, including two simulation datasets and one real-world collected dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our Polyner performs comparably to the supervised DL method on in-domain datasets, while significantly outperforming them on out-of-domain datasets. We also conduct extensive ablation studies for several key designs of our method, verifying their effectiveness. To the best of our knowledge, our Polyner is the first unsupervised MAR method superior to its supervised counterparts. The main contributions of this work can be summarised as follows: (1) We propose Polyner, an unsupervised polychromatic neural representation, that can recover high-quality CT images from metal-corrupted measurements without the need for any extra data. (2) We introduce a new model perspective for the CT MAR problem, i.e., recovering polychromatic CT images to mitigate the nonlinear metal effect and thus achieving effective MAR. (3) We technically incorporate a polychromatic CT forward model into the INR, enabling the reconstruction of polychromatic CT images.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: CT images.
