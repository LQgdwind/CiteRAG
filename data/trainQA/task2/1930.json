It introduces an unobserved random variable as the generative component to model the probabilistic uncertainty. Given fully observed data D=(xi,yi)i=1N𝐷subscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖𝑁𝑖1D={(x_{i},y_{i})}^{N}_{i=1}, we consider them as random variables and use capital letters X𝑋X and Y𝑌Y to represent them. The unobserved random variable introduced with VI is denoted as Z𝑍Z and passes the information from X𝑋X to Y𝑌Y. It can be marginalised out with Bayes’ rule as: Under a mean-field assumption  over the unobserved random variable Z𝑍Z, we can factorise it as: Hence for each pair of data x𝑥x and y𝑦y, the maximum likelihood learning delivers the following objective with respect to θ𝜃\\theta: Given observed data D=(xi,yi)i=1N𝐷subscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖𝑁𝑖1D={(x_{i},y_{i})}^{N}_{i=1}, we can not directly model the distribution of unobserved z𝑧z and hence the probability distribution P​(y|z;θ)𝑃conditional𝑦𝑧𝜃P(y|z;\\theta) is intractable for data-driven models, such as neural networks. With VI, an additional variational parameter ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi with its associated variational family distribution q​(z;ϕ)𝑞𝑧italic-ϕq(z;\\phi) is introduced, to approximate the real probability P​(y|z;θ)𝑃conditional𝑦𝑧𝜃P(y|z;\\theta). During the learning process, we minimise the distance between q​(z;ϕ)𝑞𝑧italic-ϕq(z;\\phi) and P​(y|z;θ)𝑃conditional𝑦𝑧𝜃P(y|z;\\theta) through the Kullback–Leibler divergence, a term that measures the distance between two probability distributions. Hence, the learning of the intractable probability distribution problem is converted to an optimisation problem over the evidence lower bound (ELBO), where 𝔻K​Lsubscript𝔻𝐾𝐿\\mathbb{D}_{KL} refers to the Kullback–Leibler divergence: VI was initially developed to solve a specific class of modelling problems where conditional conjugacy is presumed, and variational parameter ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi is updated through closed-form coordinate ascent . However, conditional conjugacy is not practical in most of the real world problems; thus further advancements [ref]8 extend VI to large scale datasets and non-conjugate models.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Variational inference (VI) [ref]7[ref]21 is a general framework for Bayesian statistical modelling and inference under a maximum likelihood learning scheme.
