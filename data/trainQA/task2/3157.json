      "content": "Paper Title: UniLog: Deploy One Model and Specialize it for All Log Analysis Tasks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLarge-scale network services have been increasingly integrated into our daily lives. Most of them are expected to be available on a 24 × 7 basis, and any accidental downtime can lead to irreparable performance and significant revenue loss. For instance, a downtime in Amazon in 2017 led to a loss of around 150 million US dollars  . Therefore, network service reliability becomes increasingly important. These network services continuously generate large amounts of logs (see Fig.  1 for examples), which describe a vast range of events and record run-time information. The huge volume of logs makes it impractical to manually inspect logs for key diagnostic information, even with “search” or “grep” toolkit. Thus there are fast-growing demands to design automatic log analysis frameworks. Many automatic log analysis approaches have been proposed with the success of machine learning and deep learning, as shown in Fig. 2. Existing log analysis approaches can be classified into four tasks  (see Fig. 1), i.e., anomaly detection aiming to proactively detecting anomalous service behaviors , failure prediction which predicts service failure according to omen patterns [ref]4, log compression trying to save the storage space of massive logs [ref]5, and log summarization summarizing a series of logs [ref]6. Despite the tremendous success of the existing log analysis methods, these algorithms only specialize in one type of log analysis task. Nevertheless, real-life deployment constantly desired to do multiple log analysis tasks simultaneously. Imagine a scenario: the maintenance system localizes anomalous logs, and it warns the operators about a potential system failure that might happen very soon. Meanwhile, the system summarizes the unreadable logs into few words to let the operators examine the summarized logs and compress these vast amounts of real-time logs into lossless log data for future usage. More importantly, all these functionalities are performed via a single model, which is easy to debug and upgrade. Such a model is appealing yet hard to accomplish due to the following challenges. First of all, log data are heterogeneous across domains (i.e., datasets, devices, time.) because different datasets and devices are always filled with different rules to generate logs. Moreover, the style of generated logs from the network system can change from time to time (i.e., due to system upgrade), makes even more challenging to design a good model for log analysis tasks across domains. Secondly, there are many types of log analysis tasks; these tasks are not complemented from the perspective of algorithm design. For example, anomaly detection needs to reconstruct the origin piece of the log.\nIn contrast, failure prediction needs to predict a specific time where failures might happen. Therefore, current methods design task-specific models for each log analysis task. Unifying these tasks into a single model is non-trivial. In this paper, we present a novel approach, named as UniLog, which unified various log analysis tasks under a single framework, enables us to deploy a single model, and specialize it for all log analysis tasks.\nThe UniLog has the following merits. First of all, it can generalize to log data from different or even unseen domains. This is achieved by leveraging the Transformer , a deep neural architecture that has been rapidly developed in recent years on natural language processing (NLP) , computer vision , and graph data 0. We developed a large-scale unlabeled log data pretrain framework to mix up the log data from different domains and use these data to pretrain the Transformer neural networks. Such well designed pretrained Transformer can perform log analysis across different devices and different time periods effectively and consistently.\nSecondly, the UniLog is a framework to deploy one model and specialize it for all log analysis tasks. It unifies different log analysis tasks into a single framework. The UniLog would relieve the operators from debugging and upgrading the model to the log analysis tasks themselves.\nLast but not least, switching the UniLog model from one task to another does not involve prior knowledge from the professionals, enabling smooth and automatic workflow for maintaining the network log analysis system.\n Extensive experiments are conducted to verify our proposed UniLog model. We evaluate our method on four log analysis tasks, including log anomaly detection, log failure prediction, log summarization, and log data compression. Our model performs competitively or outperforms state-of-the-art methods on seven public log datasets across these four log analysis datasets. For instance, we outperform PreFix [ref]4 by an average of 5.46% F1 score on failure prediction tasks on Switch log dataset [ref]4. On log anomaly detection, we achieve better F1 scores on both HDFS and BGL datasets than state-of-the-arts. Furthermore, our experiments have shown that the UniLog can generalize on unseen log data, which overcome log data domain adaption and concept drift problem. We believe that UniLog offers an interesting and practical new perspective on designing the model for log analysis tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: into four tasks  (see Fig. 1), i.e., anomaly detection aiming to proactively detecting anomalous service behaviors , failure prediction which predicts service failure according to omen patterns [ref]4, log compression trying to save the storage space of massive logs [ref]5, and log summarization summarizing a series of logs [ref]6.
