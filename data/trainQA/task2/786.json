      "content": "Paper Title: CRAC: Checkpoint-Restart Architecture for CUDA with Streams and UVM\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMuch of the work targeting transparent checkpointing of\nCUDA was already covered in Section 2, as part of\nthe motivation for a fresh approach in CRAC.\nSee Section 2 for more details. To summarize, several\ntechniques      were explored prior to CUDA 4.0 (in\n2011 and earlier). Later, unified memory between device and host was\nintroduced to CUDA in two increments: Unified Virtual Addressing (UVA)\nin CUDA 4.0; and Unified Virtual Memory (UVM )\nin CUDA 6.0. This unified memory was incompatible with existing\ncheckpointing approaches. Since then, two newer checkpointing approaches appeared:\nCRCUDA [ref]15 and CRUM .\nThe limitations of these two approaches were\nalready described: high runtime overhead,\nincomplete UVM support, and untested scaling of concurrent streams.\n(See the second page of Section 1 for details.) It remains to describe four techniques from the literature that\nare related to the implementation of CRAC: proxies in CRUM;\nproxies in the wider literature; split processes; and\nprocess-in-process. The previous work of CRUM in checkpointing CUDA has unacceptable high\noverhead of 6% and could go up to 12%. This occurs at two extremes. Many short-lived kernels. This incurred overhead because\nof the need to frequently marshal and unmarshal the parameters for\ncommunication between the application and the proxy process when\ninvoking CudaLaunchKernel. For example, HPGMG-FV has a high frequency\nof CUDA calls. Kernel and host access many UVM memory pages frequently.\nThis requiring frequent calls to mprotect and userfault_fd\n(a recent Linux utility serving the same purpose as segfault\nhandlers). This interacted particularly badly with NVIDIA UVM. Proxy processes are a well-known concept that is widely used in systems.\nIn an early example, Zandy et al. \ndemonstrated the use of a “shadow” process for checkpointing currently\nrunning application processes that were not originally linked with a\ncheckpointing library. This allows the application process to continue to\naccess its kernel resources, such as open files, via RPC calls with the\nshadow process.\nKharbutli et al.  use a proxy process\nfor isolation of heap accesses by a process and for containment of attacks\nto the heap.\nCheCL  has employed\nproxy processes already in 2010, for the closely related OpenCL\nlanguage  for GPUs.\nCRCUDA [ref]15 and CRUM also\nemploy proxy processes. Split processes were described in\nFigure 1 in Section 3.1.\nMPI for MANA  had adopted the idea of split\nprocesses in the context of checkpoint-restart for MPI. Upon checkpoint, only\nthe upper half memory is saved. On restart, a small bootstrap program\nin the lower half restores the upper half memory, and the upper half\nthen replays any persistent state associated with a physical device.\nIn the case of MANA, that physical device would be the network, and/or\nsockets communicating with a central MPI coordinator. In the case of\nthe current work (CRAC), the physical device is the GPU. There are several antecedents to the idea of combining two programs\nin a single process. Here we note McKernel and shadow device drivers,\nboth devised for the Linux kernel. McKernel  runs a “lightweight” kernel along\nwith a full-fledged Linux kernel. The HPC application runs on the\nlightweight kernel, which implements time-critical\nsystem calls. The rest of the functionality is offloaded to a proxy process\nrunning on the Linux kernel. The proxy process is mapped in the address\nspace of the main application, similar to MANA’s concept of\na lower half, to minimize the overhead of “call forwarding” (argument\nmarshalling/un-marshalling). Swift et al.  developed the idea of\na “shadow device driver”. The lower half corresponds to the actual\ndevice driver, and the upper half corresponds to a shadow device\ndriver that mirrors (or “logs”) all transactions to the lower half.\nIf the lower-half device driver crashes, then it is re-initialized\nand a long-and-replay approach is used to re-initialize it. Process-in-process  is related to split\nprocess in that\nthat both approaches load multiple programs into a single address\nspace. However, the goal of process-in-process was intra-node communication\noptimization, and not checkpoint-restart.\nGiven two MPI ranks (processes) co-located on a single computer node,\nthe two ranks were loaded into a single address space, to make\ncopying of messages between the two MPI ranks more efficient. Unlike split processes, process-in-process\nloads all MPI ranks co-located on the same node\nas separate threads within a single process, but\nin different logical “namespaces”, in the sense of the dlmopen\nnamespaces in Linux.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: CUDA 4.0; and Unified Virtual Memory (UVM )\nin CUDA 6.0. This unified memory was incompatible with existing\ncheckpointing approaches. Since then, two newer checkpointing approaches appeared:\nCRCUDA [ref]15 and CRUM .\nThe limitations of these two approaches were\nalready described: high runtime overhead,\nincomplete UVM support, and untested scaling of concurrent streams.\n(See the second page of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
