      "content": "Paper Title: Quantum and classical query complexities of functions of matrices\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhen studying the query complexity of computing Boolean functions, the polynomial method provides a powerful approach for estimating lower bounds . It says that the quantum query complexity of computing a Boolean function f𝑓f is lower bounded by half of the approximate degree of f𝑓f. Here the approximate degree is defined as the minimal degree of the multivariate polynomial g𝑔g satisfying |f​(x)−g​(x)|≤1/3𝑓𝑥𝑔𝑥13|f(x)-g(x)|\\leq 1/3 for all x𝑥x in the domain of f𝑓f. We below consider the case for continuous functions. Let f​(x):[−1,1]→[−1,1]:𝑓𝑥→1111f(x):[-1,1]\\rightarrow[-1,1] be a function and ε∈(0,1]𝜀01\\varepsilon\\in(0,1], we define the ε𝜀\\varepsilon-approximate degree of f𝑓f as The following result indicates the existence of g​(x)𝑔𝑥g(x). Let f​(x)𝑓𝑥f(x) be a continuous function on [a,b]𝑎𝑏[a,b]. Then for every n𝑛n, there is a polynomial p^n​(x)subscript^𝑝𝑛𝑥\\hat{p}_{n}(x) of degree at most n𝑛n that minimizes maxx∈[a,b]⁡|f​(x)−pn​(x)|subscript𝑥𝑎𝑏𝑓𝑥subscript𝑝𝑛𝑥\\max_{x\\in[a,b]}|f(x)-p_{n}(x)|. It is obvious that deg~ε​(f)subscript~degree𝜀𝑓\\widetilde{\\deg}_{\\varepsilon}(f) is decreasing with respect to ε𝜀\\varepsilon.\nUsually, it is not easy to compute or estimate the approximate degree even for Boolean functions. One successful method is called the dual polynomial method 9. It connects the approximate degree of f𝑓f to a linear program problem. For a fixed integer d𝑑d, the dual polynomial method studies the smallest error to which any polynomial of degree less than d𝑑d can approximate f𝑓f. For real-valued functions, this can be formulated as the following linear semi-infinite program: We denote by Val​(f​(x),d)Val𝑓𝑥𝑑{\\rm Val}(f(x),d) the optimal value of the above linear semi-infinite program. From the above construction, it is easy to see that The dual form of (3.1) is A proof of this is given in Appendix A.\nThe above dual form is very similar to that of the case of Boolean functions discussed in [19, Equations (15)-(17)]. Condition (3.5) says that h​(x)ℎ𝑥h(x) is orthogonal to low-degree polynomials so that it has a pure high degree. Condition (3.5) means that f​(x)𝑓𝑥f(x) has L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} norm 1. By the stronger duality theorem, there is a h​(x)ℎ𝑥h(x) such that ∫−11f​(x)​h​(x)​𝑑x=εsuperscriptsubscript11𝑓𝑥ℎ𝑥differential-d𝑥𝜀\\int_{-1}^{1}f(x)h(x)dx=\\varepsilon when d=deg~ε​(f)𝑑subscript~degree𝜀𝑓d=\\widetilde{\\deg}_{\\varepsilon}(f) in (3.1). This means that h​(x)ℎ𝑥h(x) has a correlation ε𝜀\\varepsilon with f​(x)𝑓𝑥f(x). Following the notion of 9, we also call h​(x)ℎ𝑥h(x) a witness or a dual polynomial of f​(x)𝑓𝑥f(x). We below check the conditions of Lemmas 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 so that the above LSIP can be solved by the discretisation method.\nLet g𝑔g be the polynomial that approximates f𝑓f with degree d=deg~ε​(f)𝑑subscript~degree𝜀𝑓d=\\widetilde{\\deg}_{\\varepsilon}(f), then |f​(x)−g​(x)|≤ε𝑓𝑥𝑔𝑥𝜀|f(x)-g(x)|\\leq\\varepsilon for all x∈[−1,1]𝑥11x\\in[-1,1]. Thus if we choose δ=2​ε𝛿2𝜀\\delta=2\\varepsilon in (3.1), then the condition in Lemma 2.3 is satisfied using this (g,δ)𝑔𝛿(g,\\delta). As a result, there is no duality gap for the linear semi-infinite programming (3.1). Together with Lemmas 2.1 and 2.2, the problem (3.1) is reducible and can be solved by the discretisation approach.\nMoreover, by Lemma 2.2, there exist {x1,…,xn}subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛\\{x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}\\} with n≤d+2𝑛𝑑2n\\leq d+2 such that (3.1) is equivalent to the following linear program Here by equivalent, we mean they have the same optimal solution and optimal value.\nThe dual form of (3.6) is The constraints in (3.9) define a Vandermonde linear system with rank min⁡(d+1,n)𝑑1𝑛\\min(d+1,n). So to ensure the existence of a nontrivial solution, the only choice is n=d+2𝑛𝑑2n=d+2. It is easy to check that the solutions of this Vandermonde linear system satisfy where α∈ℝ𝛼ℝ\\alpha\\in\\mathbb{R} is a free parameter, which is determined by the constraint (3.9). From Equation (2.4) and Lemma 2.4, we can see that there is a close connection between the dual polynomial method and functions of symmetric tridiagonal matrices.\nOne problem here is that Lemma 2.3 is an existence theorem, it is possible that x1,…,xnsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n} do not have the symmetric property of eigenvalues of symmetric tridiagonal matrices, i.e., both λisubscript𝜆𝑖\\lambda_{i} and −λisubscript𝜆𝑖-\\lambda_{i} are eigenvalues. However, this can be resolved by focusing on the even and odd parts of f𝑓f. The following lemma is easy to prove. Let f​(x):[−1,1]→[−1,1]:𝑓𝑥→1111f(x):[-1,1]\\rightarrow[-1,1] be a function and let be the even and odd parts of f​(x)𝑓𝑥f(x) respectively. Then (i). max⁡(deg~ε​(feven),deg~ε​(fodd))≤deg~ε​(f)≤max⁡(deg~ε/2​(feven),deg~ε/2​(fodd))subscript~degree𝜀subscript𝑓evensubscript~degree𝜀subscript𝑓oddsubscript~degree𝜀𝑓subscript~degree𝜀2subscript𝑓evensubscript~degree𝜀2subscript𝑓odd\\max(\\widetilde{\\deg}_{\\varepsilon}(f_{\\rm even}),\\widetilde{\\deg}_{\\varepsilon}(f_{\\rm odd}))\\leq\\widetilde{\\deg}_{\\varepsilon}(f)\\leq\\max(\\widetilde{\\deg}_{\\varepsilon/2}(f_{\\rm even}),\\widetilde{\\deg}_{\\varepsilon/2}(f_{\\rm odd})). (ii). If f​(x)𝑓𝑥f(x) is even/odd, then the polynomial that approximates f​(x)𝑓𝑥f(x) with approximate degree can be set as even/odd. We are now ready to prove Theorem 1.10. We first consider fodd​(x)subscript𝑓odd𝑥f_{\\rm odd}(x). By Lemma 3.2 (ii), let goddsubscript𝑔oddg_{\\rm odd} be an odd polynomial that ε𝜀\\varepsilon-approximates f𝑓f with approximate degree d𝑑d. Then similar to (3.1), we can formulate goddsubscript𝑔oddg_{\\rm odd} in terms of an LSIP: Since goddsubscript𝑔oddg_{\\rm odd} is odd, there are\nl+1𝑙1l+1 terms, where l=⌊(d−1)/2⌋𝑙𝑑12l=\\lfloor(d-1)/2\\rfloor. This means that there are l+2𝑙2l+2 unknown variables for the above LSIP.\nUsing the optimal polynomial goddsubscript𝑔oddg_{\\rm odd} that approximates foddsubscript𝑓oddf_{\\rm odd}, it is easy to check that the conditions stated in Lemmas 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 are satisfied (also see the analysis above (3.6)).\nSo by the discretisation method (i.e., Lemma 2.2), there exist {x1,…,xl+2}⊆ subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑙201\\{x_{1},\\ldots,x_{l+2}\\}\\subseteq  such that (3.11) is equivalent to By viewing xi​hisubscript𝑥𝑖subscriptℎ𝑖x_{i}h_{i} as new variables, (3.14) defines a Vandermonde linear system whose solutions satisfy where α∈ℝ𝛼ℝ\\alpha\\in\\mathbb{R} is the free parameter determined by (3.14). We now have We view {±x1,…,±xl+2}plus-or-minussubscript𝑥1…plus-or-minussubscript𝑥𝑙2\\{\\pm x_{1},\\ldots,\\pm x_{l+2}\\} as eigenvalues of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix, then by Lemma 2.4, there is a symmetric tridiagonal matrix A𝐴A of dimension 2​l+42𝑙42l+4 with sub-diagonal entries b1,b2,…,b2​l+3subscript𝑏1subscript𝑏2…subscript𝑏2𝑙3b_{1},b_{2},\\ldots,b_{2l+3}, such that α=b1​b2​⋯​b2​l+3𝛼subscript𝑏1subscript𝑏2⋯subscript𝑏2𝑙3\\alpha=b_{1}b_{2}\\cdots b_{2l+3} and (3.14) is satisfied. Moreover, The above second equality follows from (2.4).\nIf we choose d=deg~ε​(fodd)𝑑subscript~degree𝜀subscript𝑓oddd=\\widetilde{\\deg}_{\\varepsilon}(f_{\\rm odd}), we know that the optimal value of (3.12) equals ε𝜀\\varepsilon. Thus f​(A)1,2​l+4=ε𝑓subscript𝐴12𝑙4𝜀f(A)_{1,2l+4}=\\varepsilon. Next, we consider fevensubscript𝑓evenf_{\\rm even}. Let gevensubscript𝑔eveng_{\\rm even} be an even polynomial that ε𝜀\\varepsilon approximates f𝑓f with approximate degree d=deg~ε​(feven)𝑑subscript~degree𝜀subscript𝑓evend=\\widetilde{\\deg}_{\\varepsilon}(f_{\\rm even}). Similar to the above argument, we can formulate gevensubscript𝑔eveng_{\\rm even} in terms of an LSIP: Let l=⌊d/2⌋𝑙𝑑2l=\\lfloor d/2\\rfloor.\nBy the discretisation method, there exist {x1,…,xl+2}⊆ subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑙201\\{x_{1},\\ldots,x_{l+2}\\}\\subseteq  such that (3.15) is equivalent to The solution of the Vandermonde linear system (3.18) satisfies where α∈ℝ𝛼ℝ\\alpha\\in\\mathbb{R} is the free parameter determined by (3.18). We now have We view {0,±x1,…,±xl+2}0plus-or-minussubscript𝑥1…plus-or-minussubscript𝑥𝑙2\\{0,\\pm x_{1},\\ldots,\\pm x_{l+2}\\} as eigenvalues of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix, then by Lemma 2.5, there is a symmetric tridiagonal matrix A𝐴A of dimension 2​l+52𝑙52l+5 with sub-diagonal entries b1,…,b2​l+4subscript𝑏1…subscript𝑏2𝑙4b_{1},\\ldots,b_{2l+4}, such that α=b2​⋯​b2​l+3𝛼subscript𝑏2⋯subscript𝑏2𝑙3\\alpha=b_{2}\\cdots b_{2l+3} and (3.18) is satisfied. Moreover The last equality comes from (2.5). The claim that deg~ε​(fodd)subscript~degree𝜀subscript𝑓odd\\widetilde{\\deg}_{\\varepsilon}(f_{\\rm odd}) or deg~ε​(feven)subscript~degree𝜀subscript𝑓even\\widetilde{\\deg}_{\\varepsilon}(f_{\\rm even}) is n−c𝑛𝑐n-c follows directly from the above argument.\n∎ As a direct result, we obtain Corollary 1.11. The proof is as follows. We only prove it for foddsubscript𝑓oddf_{\\rm odd}. The proof for fevensubscript𝑓evenf_{\\rm even} is similar. Let d=n−c𝑑𝑛𝑐d=n-c, where c𝑐c is the constant defined in Theorem 1.10. The existence of A𝐴A implies that the optimal value of the LP (3.12) and so the optimal value of the LSIP (3.11) is strictly larger than ε𝜀\\varepsilon.\nNote that deg~ε​(fodd)subscript~degree𝜀subscript𝑓odd\\widetilde{\\deg}_{\\varepsilon}(f_{\\rm odd}) decreases when ε𝜀\\varepsilon increases. This means that if deg~ε​(fodd)≤dsubscript~degree𝜀subscript𝑓odd𝑑\\widetilde{\\deg}_{\\varepsilon}(f_{\\rm odd})\\leq d, then the optimal value of the LSIP (3.11) is at most ε𝜀\\varepsilon. This is a contradiction. So we have deg~ε​(fodd)≥dsubscript~degree𝜀subscript𝑓odd𝑑\\widetilde{\\deg}_{\\varepsilon}(f_{\\rm odd})\\geq d.\n∎ As another application, we now can prove Theorem 1.5. We shall use the same trick as used in the proof of the ‘no fast-forwarding theorem’ of Hamiltonian simulation 7. Let (x1,…,xn)∈{0,1}nsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛superscript01𝑛(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n})\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n} be a bit string. It is known that computing the parity x1⊕⋯⊕xndirect-sumsubscript𝑥1⋯subscript𝑥𝑛x_{1}\\oplus\\cdots\\oplus x_{n} requires Ω​(n)Ω𝑛\\Omega(n) quantum queries  [ref]23. We below aim to construct a sparse Hermitian matrix such that computing an entry of f​(A)𝑓𝐴f(A) allows us to solve the parity problem. Let G𝐺G be a weighted graph defined on vertices (i,t)𝑖𝑡(i,t) for i∈{0,1,…,n},t∈{0,1}formulae-sequence𝑖01…𝑛𝑡01i\\in\\{0,1,\\ldots,n\\},t\\in\\{0,1\\}. For any t∈{0,1}𝑡01t\\in\\{0,1\\}, we add an edge between (i−1,t)𝑖1𝑡(i-1,t) and (i,t⊕xi)𝑖direct-sum𝑡subscript𝑥𝑖(i,t\\oplus x_{i}). The weights will be determined later. It is easy to check that G𝐺G is the disjoint union of the following two paths: Let A𝐴A be the adjacency matrix of G𝐺G, which is essentially a block matrix that consists of two tridiagonal matrices on the diagonal. So there are two possibilities: Case 1: if x0⊕⋯⊕xn−1=0direct-sumsubscript𝑥0⋯subscript𝑥𝑛10x_{0}\\oplus\\cdots\\oplus x_{n-1}=0, then for any function f𝑓f we have ⟨0,0|f​(A)|n,1⟩=0quantum-operator-product00𝑓𝐴𝑛10\\langle 0,0|f(A)|n,1\\rangle=0. Case 2: if x0⊕⋯⊕xn−1=1direct-sumsubscript𝑥0⋯subscript𝑥𝑛11x_{0}\\oplus\\cdots\\oplus x_{n-1}=1, then for any f𝑓f, we hope that there is a choice of the weights such that ⟨0,0|f​(A)|n,1⟩=δquantum-operator-product00𝑓𝐴𝑛1𝛿\\langle 0,0|f(A)|n,1\\rangle=\\delta for some δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0. As a result, if we can compute ⟨0,0|f​(A)|n,1⟩±δ/2plus-or-minusquantum-operator-product00𝑓𝐴𝑛1𝛿2\\langle 0,0|f(A)|n,1\\rangle\\pm\\delta/2, we then can distinguish the above two cases, and solve the parity problem. We assume that f𝑓f is not even, otherwise, we will modify G𝐺G by introducing an extra node (−1,t)1𝑡(-1,t) connected to (1,t)1𝑡(1,t) and an extra node (n+1,t)𝑛1𝑡(n+1,t) connected to (n,t)𝑛𝑡(n,t), and consider fevensubscript𝑓evenf_{\\rm even}. This will not influence the following analysis. So we can further assume that deg~ε​(fodd)≥deg~ε​(feven)subscript~degree𝜀subscript𝑓oddsubscript~degree𝜀subscript𝑓even\\widetilde{\\deg}_{\\varepsilon}(f_{\\rm odd})\\geq\\widetilde{\\deg}_{\\varepsilon}(f_{\\rm even}).\nBy Theorem 1.10, there is a tridiagonal matrix A′superscript𝐴′A^{\\prime} of the form (1.3) such that ⟨1|f​(A′)|n⟩=εquantum-operator-product1𝑓superscript𝐴′𝑛𝜀\\langle 1|f(A^{\\prime})|n\\rangle=\\varepsilon, where n=deg~ε​(fodd)+O​(1)𝑛subscript~degree𝜀subscript𝑓odd𝑂1n=\\widetilde{\\deg}_{\\varepsilon}(f_{\\rm odd})+O(1). Based on A′superscript𝐴′A^{\\prime},\nwe introduce a weight bisubscript𝑏𝑖b_{i} between (i−1,t)𝑖1𝑡(i-1,t) and (i,t⊕xi)𝑖direct-sum𝑡subscript𝑥𝑖(i,t\\oplus x_{i}) for any t𝑡t.\nThen it is easy to check that ⟨0,0|f​(A)|n,1⟩=⟨1|f​(A′)|n⟩=εquantum-operator-product00𝑓𝐴𝑛1quantum-operator-product1𝑓superscript𝐴′𝑛𝜀\\langle 0,0|f(A)|n,1\\rangle=\\langle 1|f(A^{\\prime})|n\\rangle=\\varepsilon in case 2. Thus, if there is a quantum algorithm that can compute ⟨0,0|f​(A)|n,1⟩±ε/2plus-or-minusquantum-operator-product00𝑓𝐴𝑛1𝜀2\\langle 0,0|f(A)|n,1\\rangle\\pm\\varepsilon/2, then there is a quantum algorithm that can solve the parity problem.\nBy Lemma 3.2 (i), deg~ε​(fodd)≥deg~2​ε​(f)subscript~degree𝜀subscript𝑓oddsubscript~degree2𝜀𝑓\\widetilde{\\deg}_{\\varepsilon}(f_{\\rm odd})\\geq\\widetilde{\\deg}_{2\\varepsilon}(f). Putting it all together, we obtain the claimed result.\n∎ One interesting function is 1/x1𝑥1/x, which is related to the matrix inversion problem. Theorem 1.5 cannot be used for this function directly because 1/x1𝑥1/x is not well-defined in the interval [−1,1]11[-1,1]. However,\nit was shown in [24, Corollary 69] that in the domain [−1,1]\\[−δ,δ]\\11𝛿𝛿[-1,1]\\backslash[-\\delta,\\delta], for f​(x)=3/4​x𝑓𝑥34𝑥f(x)=3/4x, there is a polynomial g​(x)𝑔𝑥g(x) of degree O​(δ−1​log⁡(1/δ​ε))𝑂superscript𝛿11𝛿𝜀O(\\delta^{-1}\\log(1/\\delta\\varepsilon)) that approximates f​(x)𝑓𝑥f(x) up to error ε𝜀\\varepsilon.\nApplying Theorem 1.5 to g​(x)𝑔𝑥g(x), we conclude that there exist i,j𝑖𝑗i,j such that computing ⟨i|3​A−1/4|j⟩±ε/4plus-or-minusquantum-operator-product𝑖3superscript𝐴14𝑗𝜀4\\langle i|3A^{-1}/4|j\\rangle\\pm\\varepsilon/4 costs at least Ω​(deg~ε​(g))Ωsubscript~degree𝜀𝑔\\Omega(\\widetilde{\\deg}_{\\varepsilon}(g)) queries.\nHere δ𝛿\\delta is usually the minimal singular value of A𝐴A so that 1/δ≈κ1𝛿𝜅1/\\delta\\approx\\kappa because ‖A‖≤1norm𝐴1\\|A\\|\\leq 1.\nRoughly, this means that computing ⟨i|A−1|j⟩±4​ε/3plus-or-minusquantum-operator-product𝑖superscript𝐴1𝑗4𝜀3\\langle i|A^{-1}|j\\rangle\\pm 4\\varepsilon/3 costs at least Ω​(deg~ε​(g))Ωsubscript~degree𝜀𝑔\\Omega(\\widetilde{\\deg}_{\\varepsilon}(g)) queries. If the degree of g​(x)𝑔𝑥g(x) is minimal, then we obtain a lower bound of Ω​(κ​log⁡(κ/ε)).Ω𝜅𝜅𝜀\\Omega(\\kappa\\log(\\kappa/\\varepsilon)).\nHowever, we are not able to find a result on the approximate degree of g​(x)𝑔𝑥g(x).\nWe below show that using a similar argument to the proof of Theorem 1.5, we can prove a lower bound of Ω​(κ)Ω𝜅\\Omega(\\kappa) without computing the approximate degree of g​(x)𝑔𝑥g(x). The following result is straightforward. Assume that n=2​m𝑛2𝑚n=2m is even. Let Then the (1,n)1𝑛(1,n)-th entry of A−1superscript𝐴1A^{-1} is (−1)m+1superscript1𝑚1(-1)^{m+1}. The condition number of A𝐴A is Θ​(n)Θ𝑛\\Theta(n). It is known that the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors of A𝐴A are So the (1,n)1𝑛(1,n)-th entry of A−1superscript𝐴1A^{-1} is 2n+1​∑k=1nλk−1​sin⁡k​πn+1​sin⁡n​k​πn+1=(−1)m+12𝑛1superscriptsubscript𝑘1𝑛superscriptsubscript𝜆𝑘1𝑘𝜋𝑛1𝑛𝑘𝜋𝑛1superscript1𝑚1\\frac{2}{n+1}\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\lambda_{k}^{-1}\\sin\\frac{k\\pi}{n+1}\\sin\\frac{nk\\pi}{n+1}=(-1)^{m+1}. The condition number is |λ1/λm|=Θ​(n)subscript𝜆1subscript𝜆𝑚Θ𝑛|\\lambda_{1}/\\lambda_{m}|=\\Theta(n).\n∎ We use a similar argument to the proof of Theorem 1.5. The construction of the graph does not change. The weights are set as 1/2121/2, so the operator norm of the adjacency matrix A𝐴A is less than 1.\nIn case 1, we have ⟨0,0|A−1|n,1⟩=0quantum-operator-product00superscript𝐴1𝑛10\\langle 0,0|A^{-1}|n,1\\rangle=0. In case 2, by Lemma 3.3, ⟨0,0|A−1|n,1⟩=±1/2quantum-operator-product00superscript𝐴1𝑛1plus-or-minus12\\langle 0,0|A^{-1}|n,1\\rangle=\\pm 1/2.\nSo if we can approximate this quantity up to additive/relative error ε<1/4𝜀14\\varepsilon<1/4 we then can distinguish the above two cases, namely we can solve the parity problem. For this construction, the condition number is κ=Θ​(n)𝜅Θ𝑛\\kappa=\\Theta(n). So we obtain a lower bound of Ω​(κ)Ω𝜅\\Omega(\\kappa).\n∎\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: be a bit string.

Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object. Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. Generate exactly 40 titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning."
