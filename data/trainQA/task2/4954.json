      "content": "Paper Title: RulE: Knowledge Graph Reasoning with Rule Embedding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nKnowledge graphs (KGs) usually store millions of real-world facts and are used in a variety of applications¬†  . Examples of knowledge graphs include Freebase¬†, WordNet¬† and YAGO¬†. They represent entities as nodes and relations among entities as edges. Each edge encodes a fact in the form of a triplet (head entity,relation,tail entity)head entityrelationtail entity(\\text{head entity},\\text{relation},\\text{tail entity}). However, KGs are usually highly incomplete, making their downstream tasks more challenging. Knowledge graph reasoning, which predicts missing facts by reasoning on existing facts, has thus become a popular research area in artificial intelligence. There are two prominent lines of work in this area: knowledge graph embedding (KGE) and rule-based KG reasoning. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) methods such as TransE¬†[ref]7, RotatE¬† and BoxE¬† embed entities and relations into a latent space and compute the score for each triplet to quantify its plausibility. KGE is efficient and robust to noise. However, it only uses zeroth-order (propositional) logic to encode existing facts (e.g., ‚ÄúAlice is Bob‚Äôs wife.‚Äù) without explicitly leveraging first-order (predicate) logic. First-order logic uses the universal quantifier to represent generally applicable logical rules. For instance, ‚Äú‚àÄx,y:x‚Äãis‚Äãy‚Äã‚Äôs wife‚Üíy‚Äãis‚Äãx‚Äã‚Äôs husband:for-allùë•ùë¶‚Üíùë•isùë¶‚Äôs wifeùë¶isùë•‚Äôs husband\\forall x,y\\colon x~{}\\text{is}~{}y\\text{'s wife}\\rightarrow y~{}\\text{is}~{}x\\text{'s husband}\". Those rules are not specific to particular entities (e.g., Alice and Bob) but are generally applicable to all entities. The other line of work, rule-based KG reasoning, in contrast, explicitly applies logic rules to infer new facts¬†0 1 2 3 4. Unlike KGE, logical rules can achieve interpretable reasoning and generalize to new entities. However, the brittleness of logical rules greatly harms prediction performance. Consider the logical rule (x,works in,y)‚Üí(x,lives in,y)‚Üíùë•works inùë¶ùë•lives inùë¶(x,\\text{works in},y)\\rightarrow(x,~{}\\text{lives in},y) as an example. It is mostly correct. Yet, if somebody works in New York but actually lives in New Jersey, the rule can still only infer the wrong fact in an absolute way. Considering that the aforementioned two lines of work can complement each other, addressing each other‚Äôs weaknesses with their own merits, it becomes imperative to study how to integrate logical rules with KGE methods in a principled manner. If we view this integration in a broader context, embedding-based reasoning can be seen as a neural method, while rule-based reasoning can be seen as a symbolic method. Neural-symbolic learning has also been a focus of artificial intelligence research in recent years¬†5 2 6 7 8. (a) Traditional KGE (b) Our RulE In the KG domain, such efforts exist too. Some works combine logical rules and KGE by using rules to infer new facts as additional training data for KGE¬†9 0 or directly convert some rules into regularization terms for specific KGE models¬†1 2. However, they both leverage logical rules merely to enhance KGE training without actually using logical rules to perform reasoning. In this way, they might lose the important information contained in explicit rules, leading to empirically worse performance than state-of-the-art methods. To address the aforementioned limitations, we propose a simple and principled framework called RulE, which aims to learn rule embeddings by jointly representing entities, relations and logical rules in a unified space. As illustrated in Figure¬†1, given a KG and logical rules, RulE assigns an embedding to each entity, relation and rule, and defines respective mathematical operators between entities and relations (traditional KGE part) as well as between relations and rules (RulE part). It is important to note that we cannot define operators between entities and rules because rules are not specific to particular entities. By jointly optimizing entity, relation and rule embeddings in the same space, RulE allows injecting prior logical rule information to enrich and regularize the embedding space. Our experiments reveal that this joint embedding can boost KGE methods themselves. Additionally, based on the relation and rule embeddings, RulE is able to give a confidence score to each rule, similar to how KGE gives each triplet a confidence score. This confidence score reflects how consistent a rule is with the existing facts, and enables performing logical rule inference in a soft way by softly controlling the contribution of each rule, which alleviates the brittleness of logic. We evaluate RulE on benchmark link prediction tasks and show superior performance.\nExperimental results reveal that our model outperforms the majority of existing embedding-based and rule-based methods. We also conduct extensive ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of each component of RulE. All the empirical results verify that RulE is a simple and effective framework for neural-symbolic KG reasoning.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: in artificial intelligence.
