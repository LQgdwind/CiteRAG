      "content": "Paper Title: A Simple Recipe for Competitive Low-compute Self supervised Vision Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSelf-Supervised Learning (SSL) has demonstrated promising performance for transfer learning [ref]10 [ref]9  . Most methods focus on large neural network architectures with at least 202020M parameters, ResNet50 architecture and bigger   [ref]10\nor ViT-Small and bigger [ref]9  [ref]2\n, with the most interesting results obtained with architectures such as ResNet50x4 (646464GFlops) for SimCLR [ref]10, or ViT-S/8 (222222GFlops) and ViT-B/8 (787878GFlops) for DINO [ref]9. At these scales, self-supervised methods have shown stronger transfer and semi-supervised performance than supervised pretraining.\nAt smaller scales however, ResNet50 and smaller, like ViT-Tiny (1.31.31.3GFlops) or ResNet18 (1.81.81.8GFlops) or MobileNetV3  (0.240.240.24GFlops), SSL approaches struggle to be competitive with their supervised counterparts  . This limits the scale of application of SSL methods, as ResNet50 and smaller architectures are the most commonly used architectures by practitioners . Additionally, large models require significantly higher memory, compute, and storage requirements, limiting their use on low compute or low power devices, where lightweight models are usually preferable. In this paper, we bring the benefits of self-supervised learning to neural network architectures with lower computational requirements.\nIn particular, we focus on strong off-the-shelf performance on transfer tasks, e.g., linear probe, few-shot, and semi-supervised settings.\nWe show that Knowledge Distillation      , originally developed for supervised learning, can be easily adapted to transfer knowledge from a large self-supervised model (the teacher) to a compact smaller model (the student). Our main insight is that the underlying training in many existing SSL joint-embedding methods [ref]10  [ref]9  can be easily repurposed to a knowledge-distillation framework.\nWe propose a simple and generic self-supervised distillation method, named Replace one Branch (RoB), that adapts the joint-embedding approaches into distillation methods by simply replacing one of the branches with a pretrained self-supervised teacher.\nWe instantiate our approach for 444 such methods: DINO [ref]9, SwAV  and iBOT  which are currently state of the art in the linear probe transfer setting, and MSN [ref]2 as the current state of the start for low shot in-distribution benchmarks (semi-supervised setting). When pretrained on ImageNet, RoB surpasses previous work in self-supervised distillation on ViT-Tiny and low compute ResNets (ResNet18 and ResNet34). More importantly, we demonstrate that the distilled students significantly surpass their supervised pre-trained counterparts on transfer tasks. More importantly, the self-supervised models are even competitive with low-compute neural nets obtained via supervised distillation (see Figures 1 and 2). Contributions: We focus on SSL performance using small models and show that existing joint embedding based SSL methods can be repurposed to a knowledge distillation framework. We propose, RoB, a simple and generic self-supervised distillation approach for joint embedding self-supervised methods. RoB is applicable to a wide variety of methods and architectures. We demonstrate state of the art self-supervised ViT-Tiny, ResNet18 and ResNet34, improving upon previous work on self-supervision for low-compute networks. We demonstrate that self-supervision is competitive on linear transfer with supervised pre-training and supervised distillation.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has demonstrated promising performance for transfer learning [ref]10 [ref]9  .
