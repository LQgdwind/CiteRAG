      "content": "Paper Title: Zorro: Valid, Sparse, and Stable Explanations in Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExplainability approaches for explaining decisions on a node level include soft-masking approaches  [ref]22 [ref]30 [ref]20  , Shapely based approaches  , surrogate model based methods  , and gradients based methods   .\nSoft-masking approaches like GNNExplainer  learns a real-valued edge and feature mask such that the mutual information with GNN’s predictions is maximized. An example of a surrogate model based method is PGMExplainer  which builds a simpler interpretable Bayesian network explaining the GNN prediction.\nOthers adopt existing explanations approaches such as Shapely  , layer-wise relevance propagation [ref]30, causal effects [ref]20 or LIME  , to graph data. The key idea in gradient based methods is to use the gradients or hidden feature map values to approximate input importance. This approach is the most straightforward solution to explain deep models and is quite popular for image and text data.\nFor graph data,  and  applied gradient based methods for explaining GNNs, which rely on propagating gradients/relevance from the output to the original model’s input. Another line of work that focuses on explaining decisions at a graph level includes XGNN  and GNES . XGNN proposed a reinforcement learning-based graph generation approach to generate explanations for the predicted class for a graph.\nGNES jointly optimizes task prediction and model explanation by enforcing graph regularization and weak supervision on model explanations.\nOther works   focus on explaining unsupervised network representations, which is out of scope for the current work or are specific to the combination of GNNs and NLP . Most of the existing approaches for explaining GNNs are based on soft-masking methods   [ref]22 [ref]30 [ref]20 .\nHowever, soft masks are typically hard for humans to interpret than hard masks due to their low sparsity and inherent uncertainty   7 .\nOnly a few hard-masking approaches for GNNs exist.\nPGMExplainer  defines explanation in terms of relevant neighborhood nodes influencing the model decision and does not consider node features.\nPGExplainer [ref]22 employs a parameterized model to generate soft edge masks with node representations (extracted from target GNN) as input. Unlike our approach, PGExplainer is not model agnostic. Like PGMExplainer, it also does not generate a feature-based explanation.\nSubgraphX  optimizes for Shapely values based on a Monte Carlo tree search.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: Explainability approaches for explaining decisions on a node level include soft-masking approaches  [ref]22 [ref]30 [ref]20  , Shapely based approaches  , surrogate model based methods  , and gradients based methods   .\nSoft-masking approaches like GNNExplainer  learns a real-valued edge and\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
