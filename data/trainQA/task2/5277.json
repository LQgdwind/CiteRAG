      "content": "Paper Title: UnICLAM:Contrastive Representation Learning with Adversarial Masking for Unified and Interpretable Medical Vision Question Answering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMedical Vision Question Answering (Medical-VQA) is a branch of general Vision Question Answering (VQA) that aims to product a correct answer with a given medical image and its corresponding question. The Medical-VQA requires building a cross-modal model that aligns the semantics from vision and texture representations, which is still in its infancy. Most current Medical-VQA models 8 [ref]13  mostly focus on extracting image and texture representations with dual independent encoders and grasping the interaction of vision-texture information through an extra fusion module, which makes it challenging to learn semantic alignments. Nevertheless, recently advanced general VQA models  [ref]26   try to conduct a unified framework that jointly learns the cross-modal representations or constructs a unified fusion module with pre-trained features. These works motivate us to construct a unified cross-modal learning structure for Medical-VQA.\nIn our work, we propose the UnICLAM illustrated in Fig. 1, a Unified and Interpretable model through the Contrastive Representation Learning method with Adversarial Masking.\nSpecifically, we construct a unified dual-stream pre-training structure with a gradually soft-parameter sharing strategy for vision and texture representation alignments. Technically, the parameters of image and texture encoders are constrained to be close in the same space by penalizing their l2subscriptùëô2{{l}_{2}} distances, and the higher the layer the looser the constraint. Moreover,\nin recent work, the random mask augmentation is generally employed for obtaining superior representations in the contrastive representation learning fashion. MoCo , SimCLR , SimSiam  which are fundamental works in contrastive learning, employing diverse data augmentations including the random mask to generate attracted and repulsed samples, achieving remarkable performance. Some works 0  also obtain promising performance with the powerful random mask exclusively.\nMAE  and BEiT  achieve highly competitive results through inpainting the images occluded by random masks. He  et al. currently present a simple and efficient language-image pre-training method through random masks.\nHowever, although the random mask is widely used and effective, the representation learning under the random mask is conceptually less interpretive, as the random mask partially obscures meaningful entities\n6 .\nWe hence elaborately extend the adversarial masking augmentation strategy to the unified contrastive representation learning of vision and texture, which jointly promotes the cross-modal prediction and interpretation.\nConcretely, while the encoder training minimizes the distance between the original and the masking samples, the masking model keeps adversarial learning to conversely maximize the distance. Through this, the adversarial masking model is optimized to generate more semantic vision and texture masks which are semantically associated for learning unified representations and improving interpretability.\nMoreover, we take a further step to explore the potential ante-hoc interpretability (methods to incorporate the interpretability along with the model‚Äôs training process itself) of adversarial masking which is different from the post-hoc interpretation tools (methods to explain a previously trained model) like attention map with Grad-CAM 5. We conduct detailed comparisons which illustrate that we have constructed an improved ante-hoc interpretable framework with remarkable efficiency. To be specific, with the generated semantic masks of vision and text which are closely corresponding,\nthe unified and interpretable model boosts the precise cross-modal prediction and jointly indicates how the adversarial masking efficiently benefits the cross-modal tasks. For demonstrating the effectiveness of UnICLAM, we first conduct quantitative analysis on the downstream public Medical-VQA datasets including VQA-RAD  and SLAKE 1. Experimental results reveal that UnICLAM achieves substantial improvements over existing 111111 state-of-the-art models. We also conduct a complicated analysis of the unified adversarial masking strategy, which further explores the potentials of ante-hoc interpretation with considerable efficiency.\nMore importantly, for evaluating the performance of UnICLAM applied to real-world medical scenarios, we newly conduct a practical Medical-VQA dataset of heart failure, taking an additional discussion about the few-shot performance of the UnICLAM in diagnosing heart failure.\nThe experiments reveal that our model boosts strong few-shot adaption performance by quickly adapting to practical medical applications via only limited in-context datasets. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We propose a unified and interpretable Medical-VQA structure UnICLAM, with the aid of a uniform training space where vision and texture encoders share parameters for joint interaction and a unified contrastive representation learning method with adversarial masking augmentation strategy for the semantic alignment. We present an adversarial masking data augmentation strategy with unified contrastive representation learning of vision and texture that can boost the precise prediction through cross-modal alignment and further serve as ante-hoc interpretation tools with considerable efficiency jointly. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate the outperformance of our proposed model which proves comparable prediction performance and indicative ante-hoc interpretability of the Medical-VQA. We take an additional exploration to discuss the prospect of Medical-VQA in practical heart failure diagnosing and carry out comparison experiments to verify the few-shot adaption performance of the proposed model in the newly conducted practical Medical-VQA dataset.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: question.
