      "content": "Paper Title: Avoiding Forgetting and Allowing Forward Transfer in Continual Learning via Sparse Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDynamic sparse training (DST) is a line of research that aims to reduce the computation and memory overhead of training dense neural networks by leveraging the redundancy in the parameters (i.e., being over-parametrized) [ref]8. The basic idea is to train a sparse neural network from scratch and optimize the weights and topology simultaneously. Efforts in this line of research are devoted to single standard task supervised and unsupervised learning. The first work in this direction was proposed by . They showed that dynamic training of sparse networks from scratch achieves higher performance than dense models and static sparse neural networks trained from scratch. Recently, many interesting works have addressed this training strategy by proposing different algorithms for optimizing the topology during training [ref]14 [ref]10  . In SpaceNet , a DST approach was proposed to optimize the topology to produce sparse representation for continual learning. DST demonstrated its success in other fields as well, such as feature selection , ensembling 6, federated learning , adversarial training , and deep reinforcement learning .\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: (DST) is a line of research that aims to reduce the computation and memory overhead of training dense neural networks by leveraging the redundancy in the parameters (i.e., being over-parametrized) [ref]8.
