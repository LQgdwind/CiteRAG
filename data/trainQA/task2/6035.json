      "content": "Paper Title: Few-shot Class-incremental Pill Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe purpose of FSL is to design a machine learning algorithm that can rapidly generalize to new tasks containing only a few samples with supervised information based on previous knowledge¬†[ref]15 . Each new task usually includes a support set and a query set, and the data in the two sets do not intersect¬†. The support set contains a few labeled training samples, which assist the algorithm based on prior knowledge to make predictions on the query set. The data in the support set is often described as N‚àílimit-fromùëÅN-way K‚àílimit-fromùêæK-shot, which means that the support set contains NùëÅN classes, and each class has KùêæK labeled samples. In recent years, plenty of works have focused on developing few-shot learning algorithms. They can broadly be summarized into optimization-based and metric learning-based methods¬†[ref]18. Optimization-based methods train a model with data from previous base classes and then fine-tune the classifier or the whole model with data from the support set in the new task¬†. Our work is more relevant to metric learning-based methods, which generally learn feature representations through existing metric algorithms¬†. Metric learning-based methods concentrate on learning a robust backbone to generate high-quality and transferable feature representations¬†. The Siamese loss, which can minimize the distance between feature representations from the same class, and maximize otherwise, is used to perform the FSL task in¬†. The first few-shot pill recognition framework¬† adopts the Triplet loss, similar to the Siamese loss, to obtain discriminative feature representations to perform the FSL task.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: The purpose of FSL is to design a machine learning algorithm that can rapidly generalize to new tasks containing only a few samples with supervised information based on previous knowledge¬†[ref]15 .

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
