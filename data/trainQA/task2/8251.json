Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: DRIM-ANN: An Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search Engine based on Commercial DRAM-PIMs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMainstream ANNS algorithms can be divided into graph-based , , tree-based[ref]14, cluster-based algorithms and hash-based categories. In this paper, we focus on cluster-based search methods, based on IVF and PQ techniques. Faiss  is a well-known industrial-grade library for ANNS and provides supports for cluster-based ANNS index from its initial version. After its proposal, many works[ref]17,,,8, try to reduce the time cost or improve the index quality of PQ at algorithm level. On CPU, ,,, explore fast index construction or searching, with pre-constructed LUT or SIMD instruction. On GPU, 7 presents Product Quantization Tree (PQT) for large scale dataset, 3 proposes a novel generic inverted index framework. However, the bandwidth of ordinary memory chips on CPU is limited, which hurts the performance of ANNS. The bandwidth of GPU memory is high, but the capacity is bounded, which limits the scalability of deployment on GPU. Besides,  proposes a framework for specific architecture design to solve the memory access problem by software-hardware co-design. However, development and optimization for the specific designs are laborious, which limits the application scenes of these designs.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: Mainstream ANNS algorithms can be divided into graph-based , , tree-based[ref]14, cluster-based algorithms and hash-based categories.
