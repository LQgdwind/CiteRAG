      "content": "Paper Title: Evaluating the Efficacy of Instance Incremental vs. Batch Learning in Delayed Label Environments: An Empirical Study on Tabular Data Streaming for Fraud Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMuch effort has been made in model interpretability in static settings, where the typical objective is to understand the decisions made by the underlying model. For this purpose, two approaches exist: using post hoc tools such as SHAP [ref]24 to explain the decision of black box models or using a\ndirectly inherently interpretable model such as an Explainable Boosting Machine  and TabSRA . Although interpretability in an evolving data stream is still in its early stages, the two approaches used in static settings can also be adapted to stream or online settings. Regarding post hoc solutions, we cite iSAGE [ref]27 which offers an incremental version to the Shapley Additive Global Importance (SAGE)  tool.\nUnlike static settings, interpretability also requires understanding changes that occur in the model behaviors or, at least, in its post hoc explanations caused by incremental model updates . Unfortunately, these approaches have to contend with the reliability issue that post hoc methods suffer from in the static settings\n[ref]23. Therefore, authors such as  favor the use of inherently interpretable models for evolving data stream problems, where the more interpretable to humans is likely to change less over time . Based on this consideration, our experimental results reveal that batch incremental inherently interpretable models, besides being more interpretable (as their architecture or weights change less frequently than their instance incremental counterparts, and therefore easier for human tracking and understanding), demonstrate superior predictive performance compared to their instance incremental counterparts.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: in static settings, where the typical objective is to understand the decisions made by the underlying model.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
