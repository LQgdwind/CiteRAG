      "content": "Paper Title: Byzantines can also Learn from History: Fall of Centered Clipping in Federated Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAt this point, we revisit another well-known attack strategy called ALIE to highlight the key notions behind our attack strategy. Contrary to IPM, ALIE does not specify a direction for the attack with respect to the benign update 𝐦¯tsubscript¯𝐦𝑡\\bar{\\mathbf{m}}_{t}, but introduces a radius τisubscript𝜏𝑖\\tau_{i}, for each index i𝑖i, so that the poisoned update can not be arbitrarily far away from the benign one, index-wise, i.e., where τisubscript𝜏𝑖\\tau_{i} is determined based on the statistics of the i𝑖ith index of the updates of benign clients as well as the number of Byzantines, which is further discussed in Section III-C. Contrary to (15), on average we have where 𝚫tsubscript𝚫𝑡\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}_{t} is not aligned with 𝐦¯tsubscript¯𝐦𝑡\\bar{\\mathbf{m}}_{t}, indeed, it is often orthogonal to 𝐦¯tsubscript¯𝐦𝑡\\bar{\\mathbf{m}}_{t}. Overall, the objective is to perturb the update direction as much as possible without being detected as an outlier. To achieve consistent error accumulation, the attacker must employ similarly aligned perturbation vectors during training. Here we note that, to measure the alignment of two vectors a common metric is the cosine similarity, defined as: ALIE is quite effective against TM, Krum , and Bulyan [ref]17 defense mechanisms [ref]3. Apart from being statistically less visible, ALIE mostly gains from accumulating the perturbations over time.. We argue that the enabling factor behind the accumulation is the correlation of consecutive attacks; in other words, attack vectors are positively aligned over time, i.e., cos⁡(𝚫t,𝚫t−1)≈1subscript𝚫𝑡subscript𝚫𝑡11\\cos(\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}_{t},\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}_{t-1})\\approx 1. We emphasize that, even though the attack is formed independently from the benign gradients without specifying a particular direction; since it directly utilizes the statistics of the benign client updates which often vary slowly during training, the adversarial perturbations end up being highly correlated over time. We argue that the variance 𝝈¯tsubscript¯𝝈𝑡\\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}_{t} from benign clients 𝒦bsubscript𝒦𝑏\\mathcal{K}_{b}, thus the direction of the attack vector, does not vary significantly during training. In Table II, we demonstrate that 𝚫tsubscript𝚫𝑡\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}_{t} of ALIE is always aligned positively, which verifies our initial argument that the perturbation zm​a​x​𝝈¯tsuperscript𝑧𝑚𝑎𝑥subscript¯𝝈𝑡z^{max}\\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}_{t} used by ALIE attack is consistent over iterations in terms of its direction. This temporal correlation leads to a stronger accumulation and enhances the strength of the attack. Now, to better visualise the impact of temporal accumulation, we consider a scenario where the sign of 𝚫tsubscript𝚫𝑡\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}_{t} is alternated over consecutive communication rounds; We observe that when the sign alternates, ALIE is unable to accumulate error throughout training, which leads to normal convergence. We illustrate the convergence behaviours of ALIE and ALIE with alternating sign of 𝚫𝚫\\boldsymbol{\\Delta} in Fig. 1 against the TM aggregator, which is an aggregator that is known not to be robust against ALIE[ref]3. This comparison verifies our argument that the ALIE’s strength mainly comes from the accumulation of attacks over iterations due to the temporal alignment.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: vectors during training.
