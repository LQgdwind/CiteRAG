      "content": "Paper Title: An 808 Line Phasor-Based Dehomogenisation Matlab Code For Multi-Scale Topology Optimisation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA multi-scale optimisation problem, formulated on both a macro and a micro scale, is considered. On the macro scale ΩΩ\\Omega is discretised using Nesubscript𝑁𝑒N_{e} equal-sized quadrilateral elements e∈𝒯c𝑒superscript𝒯𝑐e\\in\\mathcal{T}^{c}. Let Ωe⊆ΩsubscriptΩ𝑒Ω\\Omega_{e}\\subseteq\\Omega denote the domain spanned by the element e∈𝒯c𝑒superscript𝒯𝑐e\\in\\mathcal{T}^{c}. On the microscale ΩesubscriptΩ𝑒\\Omega_{e} consists of a constant periodic laminate, the so-called Rank-2 microstructure. The Rank-2 microstructure consists of two periodic orthogonally oriented lamellar materials, parameterised on two different length scales, 𝒚i=𝒙/ϵi,ϵi→0formulae-sequencesubscript𝒚𝑖𝒙superscriptitalic-ϵ𝑖→subscriptitalic-ϵ𝑖0\\bm{y}_{i}=\\bm{x}/\\epsilon^{i},\\;\\epsilon_{i}\\rightarrow 0, for i∈{1,2}𝑖12i\\in\\{1,2\\} (1(c)). On the smallest length scale, 𝒚1subscript𝒚1\\bm{y}_{1}, the lamellar material has a stiff phase, (+)(+), and a compliant phase, (−)(-), with Youngs moduli E(+)superscript𝐸E^{(+)} and E(−)superscript𝐸E^{(-)}, respectively, and identical Poisson’s ratio, ν=1/3𝜈13\\nu=1/3. On the second length scale, 𝒚2subscript𝒚2\\bm{y}_{2}, the lamellar material is similarly structured, but the compliant phase is described by the effective stiffness of the 𝒚1subscript𝒚1\\bm{y}_{1} lamellar. The stiff phases are parameterised by their relative widths μi∈ subscript𝜇𝑖01\\mu_{i}\\in , for i∈{1,2}𝑖12i\\in\\{1,2\\}. Assuming that the compliant phase is void, E(−)=0superscript𝐸0E^{(-)}=0, will make the constitutive model singular, and thus non-positive definite. To mitigate this, an isotropic background material, with the stiffness Emin=10−9subscript𝐸superscript109E_{\\min}=10^{-9}, is introduced to approximate void and simplify the expression. The stiffness of the solid phase is set to unit stiffness, E(+)=1superscript𝐸1E^{(+)}=1. Following the description of a Rank-N microstructure from Jensen et al., 8 with Cartesian aligned laminates, the constitutive matrix is defined in Eq. 1. The Rank-2 material is rotated with respect to 𝒙𝒙\\bm{x}, using the standard planar rotation (Eq. 2), where the basis-transformation matrix is given in Eq. 3 with c=cos⁡(a)𝑐𝑎c=\\cos(a) and s=sin⁡(a)𝑠𝑎s=\\sin(a), and a∈[−4​π,4​π]𝑎4𝜋4𝜋a\\in[-4\\pi,4\\pi] being the orientation angle. The relative widths, μisubscript𝜇𝑖\\mu_{i}, are defined on two different scales, making a single-scale interpretation challenging. Instead, the interpretation of relative widths from single-scale, w¯isubscript¯𝑤𝑖\\bar{w}_{i}, to multi-scale is significantly more straightforward to obtain 6.\nTo this end, μisubscript𝜇𝑖\\mu_{i} is obtained from w¯isubscript¯𝑤𝑖\\bar{w}_{i} by Eq. 4-Eq. 6, where pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} is the stiffness contribution from each layer and ρNsubscript𝜌𝑁\\rho_{N} the relative density of a lamellar with N𝑁N layers. w¯isubscript¯𝑤𝑖\\bar{w}_{i} is a physical relative width, which depends on two design variables; the relative width wi∈[wmin,wmax]subscript𝑤𝑖subscript𝑤subscript𝑤w_{i}\\in[w_{\\min},w_{\\max}], where 0≤wmin≤wmax≤10subscript𝑤subscript𝑤10\\leq w_{\\min}\\leq w_{\\max}\\leq 1, and an indicator value si∈ subscript𝑠𝑖01s_{i}\\in . The indicator determines if the material is active, s=1𝑠1s=1, or void, s=0𝑠0s=0 3. w𝑤w and s𝑠s are filtered to obtain w~~𝑤\\tilde{w} and s~~𝑠\\tilde{s} (Eq. 7), where k𝑘k is a kernel based on the neighbourhood Ωek∈ΩsubscriptsuperscriptΩ𝑘𝑒Ω\\Omega^{k}_{e}\\in\\Omega defined from the filter radii rminsubscript𝑟r_{\\min} and αrsc​rminsubscript𝛼rscsubscript𝑟\\alpha_{\\text{rsc}}\\,r_{\\min}, for w~~𝑤\\tilde{w} and s~~𝑠\\tilde{s}, respectively. αrsc≥1subscript𝛼rsc1\\alpha_{\\text{rsc}}\\geq 1 is a scaling parameter for the indicator filter radius. s~~𝑠\\tilde{s} is projected using the three-field robust approach [ref]31 to s¯msuperscript¯𝑠𝑚\\bar{s}^{m}, for m∈{e,i,d}𝑚𝑒𝑖𝑑m\\in\\{e,i,d\\}, representing the eroded, intermediate and dilated fields, respectively (Eq. 8). ηm∈ superscript𝜂𝑚01\\eta^{m}\\in  are projection thresholds and β∈(0,∞]𝛽0\\beta\\in(0,\\infty] is the projection sharpness. To ensure minimum length-scale on the physical relative widths, the indicator and widths are convoluted (Eq. 9). Let 𝐰i∈ℝNesubscript𝐰𝑖superscriptℝsubscript𝑁𝑒\\mathbf{w}_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N_{e}}, 𝐬∈ℝNe𝐬superscriptℝsubscript𝑁𝑒\\mathbf{s}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N_{e}} and 𝐚∈ℝNe𝐚superscriptℝsubscript𝑁𝑒\\mathbf{a}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N_{e}} be vectors representing the design on ΩΩ\\Omega, with restrictions 𝐰i=1subscript𝐰𝑖1\\mathbf{w}_{i}=1 and 𝐬=1𝐬1\\mathbf{s}=1 in ΩPsubscriptΩ𝑃\\Omega_{P}, for solid passive material. Further, let 𝜿𝜿\\bm{\\kappa} denote the combined set of design variables, such that 𝜿={𝐰1,𝐰2,𝐬,𝐚}𝜿subscript𝐰1subscript𝐰2𝐬𝐚\\bm{\\kappa}=\\{\\mathbf{w}_{1},\\mathbf{w}_{2},\\mathbf{s},\\mathbf{a}\\}. The optimisation problem of the multi-scale minimum compliance problem is stated in (Eq. 10)-(Eq. 13). The optimisation objective (Eq. 10) is to minimise a weighted sum of the structural compliance (Eq. 14),\nand a non-uniqueness penalty term 3 8, with weight factors γ0subscript𝛾0\\gamma_{0} and γSsubscript𝛾𝑆\\gamma_{S} respectively. γ0subscript𝛾0\\gamma_{0} is the volume-weighted solid compliance of ΩΩ\\Omega, and γS=1/20subscript𝛾𝑆120\\gamma_{S}=1/20 scales the penalty term. The objective is subjected to an upper bound constraint (Eq. 13) on the overall volume (Eq. 15), with VΩsubscript𝑉ΩV_{\\Omega} denoting the volume of ΩΩ\\Omega. The displacements, 𝐮𝐮\\mathbf{u}, are obtained from the linear elastic problem (Eq. 13) considering the eroded multi-scale interpretation of 𝐰isubscript𝐰𝑖\\mathbf{w}_{i} (Eq. 4). The design variables are subjected to box constraints based on their defined ranges (Eq. 13).\nThe optimisation problem is solved in a nested form, where in each iteration of the procedure, the design is updated using the OC-resembling update rule from 0. Sensitivities with respect to the objective and volume fraction constraint are computed using the discrete adjoint method.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: s~~𝑠\\tilde{s}, respectively. αrsc≥1subscript𝛼rsc1\\alpha_{\\text{rsc}}\\geq 1 is a scaling parameter for the indicator filter radius. s~~𝑠\\tilde{s} is projected using the three-field robust approach [ref]31 to s¯msuperscript¯𝑠𝑚\\bar{s}^{m}, for m∈{e,i,d}𝑚𝑒𝑖𝑑m\\in\\{e,i,d\\}, representing the eroded, intermediate and dilated fields, respectively (Eq. 8). ηm∈ superscript𝜂𝑚01\\eta^{m}\\in  are projection\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
