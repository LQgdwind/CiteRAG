The work in [ref]11 adopts magnitude selection on model gradients to yield sparsification when using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). Instead of dense updates of weights, [ref]10 proposed a distributed SGD that keeps 1% of the gradients\nby comparing their magnitude values. The method in  scales up SGD training of DNN via controlling the rate of weight update per individual weight.  develops encoding SGD-based vectors achieving reduced communication overhead.  proposed the periodic quantized averaging SGD strategy that attains similar model predictive performance while the size of shared model gradients is reduced 95%percent9595\\%. In , the authors argued that 99% of gradients are redundant and introduced a deep gradient compression method, which achieves compression rates in the range 270-600 with sacrificing accuracy. The gTop-k gradient sparsification method in  reduces communication cost based on the Top-k method in .  develops a method based on  that adaptively compresses the size of exchanged model gradients via quantization. In contrast to gradient sparsification, the shrinkage of the entire model size is of paramount importance in distributed learning. It not only eliminates communication redundancy during training but also enables less storage and inference time, which makes FL welcome in distributed knowledge systems. However, so far, only centralized learning adopts model compression via, e.g., weight pruning, quantization, low-rank factorization, transferred convolutional filters, and knowledge distillation , with pruning being our focus in this work. SNIP  introduces a method that prunes a DNN model once (i.e., prior to training) based on the identification of important connections in the model.  proposes a centralized two-step method that prunes each layer of a DNN via regression-based channel selection and least squares reconstruction. The method in [ref]25 prunes CNNs centrally using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Following [ref]25, the PruneTrain method  uses structured group-LASSO regularization to accelerate CNN training in a centralized location only. The DPF  method allows dynamic management of the model sparsity with a feedback mechanism that re-activates pruned weights.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: and redundant sharing of model weights is a significant obstacle in distributed learning .\nThe size of the exchanged models among nodes can be reduced by compression and sparsification.
