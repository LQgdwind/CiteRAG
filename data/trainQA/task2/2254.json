      "content": "Paper Title: Continual Learning via Inter-Task Synaptic Mapping\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis section discusses the experimental procedure of our algorithm in four problems: splitMNIST  , permuttedMNIST , rotatedMNIST  and omniglot  [ref]8. ISYANA is compared against eight recently published algorithms: Context-dependent Gating (XDG) , Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) , onlineEWC  [ref]8, SI , LWF , Deep Generative Replay (DGR) , Deep Generative Replay distillation [ref]1  and Averaged Gradient Episodic Memory (A-GEM) .\n\nSimulation Protocol: the standard evaluation protocol of continual learning   is followed here where three evaluation metrics, namely average accuracy, positive forward transfer and positive backward transfer, are applied. It not only evaluates the ISYANA’s aptitude in dealing with catastrophic forgetting, but also assesses whether the past knowledge improves the network performance in learning new tasks or the newly observed knowledge in the current task undermines its capability in coping with the previous tasks. Suppose that S∈ℜT×T𝑆superscript𝑇𝑇S\\in\\Re^{T\\times T} stands for an evaluation matrix where Si,jsubscript𝑆𝑖𝑗S_{i,j} denotes the test accuracy on the task Tjsubscript𝑇𝑗T_{j} after observing completely the task Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i} while b^^𝑏\\hat{b} is the accuracy vector for each task. The three evaluation metrics [ref]1 [ref]2  are mathematically defined as follows: where A​C​C,B​W​T,F​W​T𝐴𝐶𝐶𝐵𝑊𝑇𝐹𝑊𝑇ACC,BWT,FWT stand for the average accuracy, the backward transfer and the forward transfer respectively. The B​W​T𝐵𝑊𝑇BWT and F​W​T𝐹𝑊𝑇FWT complement A​C​C𝐴𝐶𝐶ACC if the accuracy returns the same results.\n\nBaseline: the characteristics of eight baseline algorithms are outlined as follows:\n\nXDG  uses a randomly generated number of hidden nodes to accept new tasks while leaving the remainder of nodes unchanged.\n\nEWC  is a regularization approach for handling the catastrophic forgetting problem where the parameter importance matrix Z𝑍Z is derived from the Fisher information matrix.\n\nOnlineEWC [ref]8 is an online variant of EWC where it utilizes the Laplace approximation rather than the posterior approximation. It retains only the latest running sum on the Fisher’s information matrix.\n\nSI  is akin to EWC but offers an alternative avenue in computing the parameter importance matrix Z𝑍Z. That is, it is calculated using the accumulated gradient of network parameters to reduce the computational burden.\n\nLWF  prevents the catastrophic forgetting by formulating the joint optimization problem between the cross entropy loss of current task and the knowledge distillation loss.\n\nDGR  utilizes the information replay mechanism to cope with the catastrophic forgetting problem. It makes use of the generative adversarial network (GAN) principle where there exists a generator and solver for each task.\n\nDGR+distill [ref]1  presents an extension of DGR with the knowledge distillation concept. It reduces the computational issue on DGR with the integration of generative model into the main model through the backward connection.\n\nA-GEM  is an extension of Generative Episodic Memory  where it applies some modification of loss function of GEM.\n\nAll algorithms are configured under the same network structure and utilizes the implementation [ref]1 [ref]2. In a nutshell, the hyperparameters of consolidated algorithms are exhibited in Table 6 and 7. Additional details of the experiments can be found in the Appendix.\n\nDatasets: the characteristics of the four baseline problems are detailed in the following.\n\nRotated MNIST is an extension of the original MNIST problem    having non-stationary traits. The changing characteristics are induced by dynamic rotations between  00180 0 degrees.\n\nPermutted MNIST presents the non-stationary version of MNIST problem by applying the fixed pixel permutation. Both permutation and rotation of the permuttedMNIST and the rotatedMNIST are unrelated for each task and represent the concept drift while having fixed target classes across tasks.\n\nSplit MNIST features the incremental class problem where the full MNIST problem is divided into 5 subsets or tasks of disjoint digits: T1∈ [ref]1,T2∈[ref]2 ,T3∈ ,T4∈ ,T5∈[ref]8 formulae-sequencesubscript𝑇101formulae-sequencesubscript𝑇223formulae-sequencesubscript𝑇345formulae-sequencesubscript𝑇467subscript𝑇589T_{1}\\in [ref]1,T_{2}\\in[ref]2 ,T_{3}\\in ,T_{4}\\in ,T_{5}\\in[ref]8 . \nOmniglot is a popular benchmark problem of the few-shot learning modified for the continual learning. It presents the continual learning of handwritten characters of 50 alphabets [ref]8. Each alphabet is considered as a separate task. Because of its size having 500 classes in total, this problem is capable of testing the scalability of continual learner. We implement our flow based on the work [ref]1 [ref]2 in the python programming language and perform our experiments on a Windows platform. We adopt the original 28x28 pixel grey-scale images without pre-processing [ref]1 [ref]2. For SplitMNIST, the dataset is divided into five tasks where each task is a two-way classification. For permutedMNIST and rotatedMNIST, the dataset is split into ten tasks where each task is a ten-way classification respectively. For omniglot dataset, it consists of 50 tasks where each task encompasses 10 classes [ref]8. It is akin to the splitMNIST problem where each task is devoted to handle the incremental class problem. We run each simulation for 10 times with different random seeds and adopt the average value as the measurable criterion to evaluate the performance of each method. Table 1, 2, 3 and 4 corresponding to Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 show the numerical results, i.e., the ACC, BWT, and FWT among different approaches for splitMNIST, rotatedMNIST, permutedMNIST and omniglot respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: This section discusses the experimental procedure of our algorithm in four problems: splitMNIST  , permuttedMNIST , rotatedMNIST  and omniglot  [ref]8.
