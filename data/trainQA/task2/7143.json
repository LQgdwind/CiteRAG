      "content": "Paper Title: PAC-Bayesian Domain Adaptation Bounds for Multi-view learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe PAC-Bayesian approach abbreviated Pac-Bayes is analysis techniques of generalization in the theory of statistical learning. PAC-Bayes inequalities were introduced by [ref]24, and  ; and further formalised\n   and other (see  for a recent survey and  for an introduction to the\nfield). It provides PAC (probably approximately correct, Valiant, 1984) generalization bounds by expressing a trade-off between the empirical risk on the training set\nand a measure of complexity of the predictors class as a weighted majority vote over a set of functions from the hypothesis space ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}. In this section, we recall the general PAC–Bayesian generalization bounds in the setting of binary classification with the 0​-​10-10\\scalebox{0.75}[0.7]{-}1-loss defined in the above section. To\nderive such a generalization bound, one assumes a prior distribution 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} over ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}, which models an a priori belief on the hypothesis from ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} before the observation of the\ntraining sample 𝕊∼Qmsimilar-to𝕊superscript𝑄𝑚\\mathbb{S}\\sim Q^{m}. Given the training sample 𝕊𝕊\\mathbb{S}, the learner aims at finding a posterior distribution 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} over ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} that leads to a well-performing 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q}-weighted majority vote ℬ𝒬subscriptℬ𝒬\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathcal{Q}} (also called the bayes classifier) defined as: We want to learn 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} over ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} such that it minimizes the true risk ℛQ​(ℬ𝒬)subscriptℛ𝑄subscriptℬ𝒬\\mathcal{R}_{Q}(\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathcal{Q}}) of the 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q}-weighted majority vote. However, the risk of B𝒬subscript𝐵𝒬B_{\\mathcal{Q}} is known to be NP-hard, therefore PAC–Bayesian generalization bounds do not directly focus on the risk of ℬ𝒬subscriptℬ𝒬\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathcal{Q}}. Instead, it gives an upper bound over the expectation over 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} of all the individual hypothesis true risk called the expected/true Gibbs risk: The expected Gibbs risk is closely related to the deterministic 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q}-weighted majority vote. Indeed, if ℬ𝒬​(⋅)subscriptℬ𝒬⋅\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathcal{Q}}(\\cdot) misclassifies 𝒙∈𝒳𝒙𝒳\\bm{x}\\in\\mathcal{X}, then at least half of the classifiers (under measure 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q}) make a prediction error on 𝒙𝒙\\bm{x}. Therefore, we have ℛQ​(ℬ𝒬)≤2​ℛQ​(G𝒬)subscriptℛ𝑄subscriptℬ𝒬2subscriptℛ𝑄subscript𝐺𝒬\\mathcal{R}_{Q}(\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathcal{Q}})\\leq 2\\,\\mathcal{R}_{Q}(G_{\\mathcal{Q}}). Another result on the relation between ℛQ​(ℬ𝒬)subscriptℛ𝑄subscriptℬ𝒬\\mathcal{R}_{Q}(\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathcal{Q}}) and ℛQ​(G𝒬)subscriptℛ𝑄subscript𝐺𝒬\\mathcal{R}_{Q}(G_{\\mathcal{Q}}) know as C-bound (5) and defined as: where dQ𝒳​(𝒬)subscript𝑑subscript𝑄𝒳𝒬d_{Q_{\\mathcal{X}}}(\\mathcal{Q}) corresponds to the expected disagreement between pairs of voters on the marginal distribution Q𝒳subscript𝑄𝒳Q_{\\mathcal{X}}: The authors in 5 observed that in a binary classification context, the expected disagreement dQ𝒳​(𝒬)subscript𝑑subscript𝑄𝒳𝒬d_{Q_{\\mathcal{X}}}(\\mathcal{Q}) is closely related\nto the notion of expected joint error eQ​(𝒬)subscript𝑒𝑄𝒬e_{Q}(\\mathcal{Q}) between pairs of voters, eQ​(𝒬)subscript𝑒𝑄𝒬e_{Q}(\\mathcal{Q}): Indeed, for all distribution Q𝑄Q on 𝒳×𝒴𝒳𝒴\\mathcal{X}\\times\\mathcal{Y} and a distribution 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} on ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}, we can decompose ℛQ​(G𝒬)subscriptℛ𝑄subscript𝐺𝒬\\mathcal{R}_{Q}(G_{\\mathcal{Q}}) as follows: The PAC-Bayesian theory, suggests that minimizing the expected Gibbs risk ℛQ​(G𝒬)subscriptℛ𝑄subscript𝐺𝒬\\mathcal{R}_{Q}(G_{\\mathcal{Q}}) can be done by minimizing the trade-off between the empirical Gibbs risk ℛ𝕊​(G𝒬)subscriptℛ𝕊subscript𝐺𝒬\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathbb{S}}(G_{\\mathcal{Q}}) and Kullback–Leibler divergence minimization DK​L(𝒬||𝒫)D_{KL}(\\mathcal{Q}||\\mathcal{P}). Note that PAC–Bayesian generalization bounds do not directly take into account the complexity of the hypothesis class ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}, but measure the deviation between the prior\ndistribution 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} and the posterior distribution 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} on ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} through the Kullback–Leibler\ndivergence. In the following, we present three main PAC-Bayesian bound proposed by ;  6; . Firstly, ; and 6 propose the following PAC-Bayesian theorem in which the tradeoff between the complexity and the risk is handled by DK​L(⋅||⋅)D_{KL}(\\cdot||\\cdot): (Seeger ; Langford 6)\nFor any distribution Q𝑄Q over 𝒳×𝒴𝒳𝒴\\mathcal{X}\\times\\mathcal{Y}, any set of hypotheses ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}, and any prior distribution 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} over ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}, any δ∈(0,1]𝛿01\\delta\\in(0,1], with a probability at least 1−δ1𝛿1-\\delta over the choice of 𝕊∼Qmsimilar-to𝕊superscript𝑄𝑚\\mathbb{S}\\sim Q^{m}, for every 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} over ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}, we have: As stated in [ref]8, the PAC-Bayesian theorem in this form provides a precise bound, particularly for low empirical Gibbs risk. Nevertheless, the inclusion of the DK​L(ℛ𝕊(G𝒬)||ℛQ(G𝒬))D_{KL}\\Big{(}\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathbb{S}}(G_{\\mathcal{Q}})\\Big{|}\\Big{|}\\mathcal{R}_{Q}(G_{\\mathcal{Q}})\\Big{)} term makes the interpretation of this bound challenging since it does not provide a direct relationship between the empirical Gibbs risk ℛ𝕊​(G𝒬)subscriptℛ𝕊subscript𝐺𝒬\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathbb{S}}(G_{\\mathcal{Q}}) and the true Gibbs risk ℛQ​(G𝒬)subscriptℛ𝑄subscript𝐺𝒬\\mathcal{R}_{Q}(G_{\\mathcal{Q}}) in a closed form. Thus, finding the distribution 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} that minimizes the bound on ℛQ​(G𝒬)subscriptℛ𝑄subscript𝐺𝒬\\mathcal{R}_{Q}(G_{\\mathcal{Q}}) given by Theorem 2.1 could be a difficult task from an algorithmic standpoint. However, the first proposed version of the PAC-Bayes theorem (McAllester ) offers a simpler interpretation by linking ℛ𝕊​(G𝒬)subscriptℛ𝕊subscript𝐺𝒬\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathbb{S}}(G_{\\mathcal{Q}}) and ℛQ​(G𝒬)subscriptℛ𝑄subscript𝐺𝒬\\mathcal{R}_{Q}(G_{\\mathcal{Q}}) through a linear relation. The following PAC-Bayesian theorem is derived from McAllester : (McAllester )\nFor any distribution Q𝑄Q over 𝒳×𝒴𝒳𝒴\\mathcal{X}\\times\\mathcal{Y}, any set of hypotheses ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}, and any prior distribution 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} over ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}, any δ∈(0,1]𝛿01\\delta\\in(0,1], with a probability at least 1−δ1𝛿1-\\delta over the choice of 𝕊∼Qmsimilar-to𝕊superscript𝑄𝑚\\mathbb{S}\\sim Q^{m}, for every 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} over ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}, we have: As stated in [ref]8, theorems 2.1 and 2.2 propose that to reduce the expected Gibbs risk, a learning algorithm needs to balance between minimizing the empirical Gibbs risk ℛ𝕊​(G𝐐)subscriptℛ𝕊subscript𝐺𝐐\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathbb{S}}(G_{\\mathbf{Q}}) and minimizing the KL-divergence DK​L(⋅∥⋅)D_{KL}(\\cdot\\|\\cdot). The explicit control of this trade-off is achievable through theorem 2.3, which is a PAC-Bayesian result introduced by  and defined with a hyperparameter (referred to as c in theorem 2.3). This result seems to be a convenient approach for developing PAC-Bayesian algorithms. We are presenting a simplified version of this result as suggested by 0. (Catoni )\nFor any distribution Q𝑄Q on 𝒳×𝒴𝒳𝒴\\mathcal{X}\\times\\mathcal{Y}, for any set of voters ℋℋ\\mathcal{H},  for any prior distribution 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} on ℋℋ\\mathcal{H},  for any δ∈(0,1]𝛿01\\delta\\in(0,1], and any real number c>0𝑐0c>0, with probability at least 1−δ1𝛿1-\\delta over the random choice of the sample 𝕊∼Qmsimilar-to𝕊superscript𝑄𝑚\\mathbb{S}\\sim Q^{m}, for every posterior distribution 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} on ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}, we have In this section we reviewed the principal Pac-Bayes bounds analysis with no adaptation and no concept of multi-view learning.
