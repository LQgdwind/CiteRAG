      "content": "Paper Title: Visual Explanation of Black-Box Model : Similarity Difference and Uniqueness (SIDU) Method\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo preform the Functionally-Grounded evaluation we choose the two automatic causal metrics insertion and deletion as proposed by [ref]12. The deletion metric deletes the saliency region in the image which is responsible for higher classification scores and forces the CNN model to change its decision. This metric estimates the decrease in the probability classification scores, when more pixels are removed from the saliency region. With the deletion metric, the good explanation shows a sharp drop in the predicted score and area under the probability curve will be lower. Whereas, the insertion metric measures the probability increase of the predicted score. As more pixels are inserted in the image, a higher Area Under Curve (AUC) rate can be achieved (i.e., effectiveness of explanation model at a greater level). The procedure of computing AUC using insertion and deletion is illustrated in Figure. 7 on page 7.\nThese metrics were selected since they are independent of human subjects, bias free and hence increase transparency when evaluating the XAI methods. In order to evaluate the performance of the SIDU explanation method we choose two datasets with different characteristics, namely- The ImageNet  dataset of Natural Images with 1000 classes. We used 2000 images randomly collected from the ImageNet validation dataset. The other is a Retinal Fundus Image Quality Assessment (RFIQA) dataset from the medical domain consisting of 9,945 images with two levels of quality, ’Good’ and ’Bad’. The retinal images were collected from a large number of patients with retinal diseases [ref]28. (a)              (b)               (c)              (d)              (e)              (f) We conducted two experiments for evaluating the faithfulness of the proposed explanation method. The first experiment is performed on the ImageNet validation dataset where we randomly selected 2000 images from the ImageNet dataset. To do a fair evaluation, we choose two existing standard CNN models, ResNet-50  and VGG-16  that had been pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset . Table 1 summarizes the results obtained on ResNet-50 for the proposed method and compares it to the most recent works RISE [ref]12 and GRAD-CAM [ref]11. It was observed that the proposed method achieved improved performance for both metrics, followed by RISE [ref]12 and GRAD-CAM [ref]11. Table 1 summarizes the results obtained on the VGG-16 model for the proposed method and compares it to most recent works RISE [ref]12 and GRAD-CAM [ref]11 where it can be identified that proposed method, SIDU achieved best performance. From the Table 1, we can observe that the values are better for ResNet-50 than VGG-16 for all the XAI methods, which suggests that ResNet-50 is a better classification model than VGG-16. Qualitative examples are shown in Figure. 6. In our proposed method, the generated masks come from the last feature activation maps of the CNN model, due to this the final explanation map will localize the entire region of interest (object class). We also conducted a second experiment on the Medical Image dataset which has totally different characteristics. We trained the existing ResNet-50  with an additional two FC layers and softmax layer on the RFIQA dataset [ref]28. The CNN model achieve 94%percent9494\\% accuaracy. The proposed explanation method uses the trained model for explaining the prediction of the RFIQA test subset with 1028 images. The evaluated results of the proposed method and RISE [ref]12 and GRAD-CAM [ref]11 are summarized in Table 2. We can observe that the GRAD-CAM achieves slightly higher AUC for insertion and lower AUC for deletion followed by SIDU. RISE [ref]12 has shown least performance in both metrics, This can be explained by the fact that the RISE method generates N𝑁N number of random masks and the weights predicted for these masks give higher weights to false regions which makes the final map of RISE noisy. The visual explanations of the proposed method (SIDU) and the RISE [ref]12, GRAD-CAM [ref]11 methods on the RFIQA test dataset are shown in Figure. 10 (b), (c), (d).\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: To preform the Functionally-Grounded evaluation we choose the two automatic causal metrics insertion and deletion as proposed by [ref]12.
