      "content": "Paper Title: On Consistency for Bulk-Bitwise Processing-in-Memory\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures, where the memory module does not only hold data but also processes it, PIM operations are explicitly initiated by software (e.g., by a dedicated instruction in the host processor      ). When initiated, these PIM operations are sent from the host core to the memory, thereby becoming a new class of memory operations alongside standard memory operations such as load and store. These new operations require re-investigation of the consistency model for hosts using PIM operations. Questions about reordering of PIM operations between PIM and other memory operations must be raised. These issues are important, as without clear ordering rules, it is hard to reason about program correctness . Despite its importance, the issue of a consistency model for PIM has been completely ignored in PIM architecture works       [ref]8 2  . PIM techniques can be categorized according to the location of the processing units, the granularity of the PIM operations, and the arbitration of the PIM computations and memory accesses  . Each PIM category exhibits different characteristics, suits different application classes, and requires different system-level support. In this paper, we focus specifically on bulk-bitwise PIM      8  and discuss the consistency of such PIM techniques. In bulk-bitwise PIM, the memory array serves both as the storage medium and as the processing unit, performing the computation on its stored data and writing the result directly to the memory cells within the array. The bulk-bitwise operations performed within the array are bitwise row-to-row or column-to-column logic operations, potentially performed on numerous memory arrays simultaneously. These characteristics have two important implications on the computing system: a) bulk-bitwise PIM operations are immediately committed to the system state during PIM execution, and b) a single bulk-bitwise PIM operation may change a large memory section. Regarding the consistency model and its implementation, these implications suggest that bulk-bitwise PIM operations cannot be speculatively executed and reverted on order violation and that the ordering of PIM operations needs to be enforced on a large address range. These implications do not necessarily apply to other PIM techniques   [ref]8  , which might require different consistency models and different solutions. Some prior works refer to the related topic of coherency between the PIM module and the host caches   . Consistency and coherency are tightly coupled when PIM is considered, as loads and stores are handled in the host processor caches while PIM operations go to the memory, potentially reordering PIM operations with loads and stores. Designing coherency solutions for PIM should be done with care, as flawed ones can result in problematic behavior. For instance, in  , PIM operations do not interact with the host processor caches and the coherency between the PIM module and caches is the responsibility of the software (by using cache flushes). For such a PIM operation mechanism, consider the scenario depicted in Fig. 1. A thread, running the example code in Fig. 1, writes value A0subscript𝐴0A_{0} to address A𝐴A (Fig. 1 1) and then writes value B0subscript𝐵0B_{0} to address B𝐵B (Fig. 1 2). Later, both addresses are flushed to memory (Fig. 1 3 4) before issuing a PIM operation (Fig. 1 6) that will change their values to A1subscript𝐴1A_{1} and B1subscript𝐵1B_{1} (Fig. 1 6a 6b). Between the flush and the PIM operation, however, A𝐴A is read from the memory to a cache (Fig. 1 5) with the value A0subscript𝐴0A_{0} (e.g., by another thread or by a prefetcher). As a result, read operations to A𝐴A after the PIM operation will result in a cache hit and the old value of A0subscript𝐴0A_{0}.\nAlthough the software is written properly (i.e., all related addresses are flushed from the cache by the software), the result is still incorrect without a proper consistency model. The above scenario is problematic for an additional reason.\nA cyclic ordering without a well-defined happen-before relation exists in this scenario, allowing the same thread to see different orders of events regardless of the host processor’s native consistency and software enforcement.\nA cyclic ordering can be formed by the following sequence of operations: (1) reading addresses A𝐴A and B𝐵B to validate that W​r​i​t​e​(A)𝑊𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒𝐴Write(A) happened before W​r​i​t​e​(B)𝑊𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒𝐵Write(B), (2) reading B𝐵B twice and getting B0subscript𝐵0B_{0} and then B1subscript𝐵1B_{1} to validate that W​r​i​t​e​(B)𝑊𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒𝐵Write(B) is before P​I​M​o​p𝑃𝐼𝑀𝑜𝑝PIMop, and (3) reading B𝐵B, getting B1subscript𝐵1B_{1}, and then reading A𝐴A, getting A0subscript𝐴0A_{0} (from the cache) to validate that P​I​M​o​p𝑃𝐼𝑀𝑜𝑝PIMop is before W​r​i​t​e​(A)𝑊𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒𝐴Write(A). Hence, W​r​i​t​e​(A)𝑊𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒𝐴Write(A) is before W​r​i​t​e​(B)𝑊𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒𝐵Write(B), W​r​i​t​e​(B)𝑊𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒𝐵Write(B) is before P​I​M​o​p𝑃𝐼𝑀𝑜𝑝PIMop, and P​I​M​o​p𝑃𝐼𝑀𝑜𝑝PIMop is before W​r​i​t​e​(A)𝑊𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒𝐴Write(A), i.e., W​r​i​t​e​(A)𝑊𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒𝐴Write(A) is before itself, forming a cycle.\nFurthermore, the ordering of W​r​i​t​e​(A)𝑊𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒𝐴Write(A) and W​r​i​t​e​(B)𝑊𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒𝐵Write(B) is not well-defined, breaking the ordering rules of the host specified explicitly by the MemFence instructions . Changing the host ordering rules by the additional PIM operation breaks the software correctness relying on these rules. In the above example, the problem comes from the non-atomicity of the PIM operation and cache flushes. This non-atomicity enables relevant addresses to be brought back to the host caches, making the PIM memory non-coherent with the host caches, and violating the host processor ordering rules for loads and stores. Any ordering guarantees that include PIM operations require the atomicity of PIM operations and cache flushes on the relevant addresses. In this paper, we propose and evaluate different options for incorporating PIM operations into a consistency model. We offer hardware solutions to enforce the proposed consistency models, including the atomicity of the PIM operations and cache flushes. Our solutions are evaluated using the gem5 simulator environment  and workloads for the YCSB [ref]7 and TPC-H 2 benchmarks. In summary, this paper makes the following contributions: We propose four consistency models for bulk-bitwise PIM operations and suggest how to implement them. We design a hardware solution to enforce the atomicity of PIM operations and their required cache flushes. We evaluate our solutions using a gem5 simulation and database workloads (YCSB and TPC-H), showing that the run time overhead of guaranteeing correctness is at most 6%percent66\\%, and in many cases the run time is even improved. We show that in the context of bulk-bitwise PIM, relaxed consistency models do not necessarily execute faster than strict consistency models.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: clear ordering rules, it is hard to reason about program correctness .
