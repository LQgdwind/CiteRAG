      "content": "Paper Title: Discrete Cycle-Consistency Based Unsupervised Deep Graph Matching\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nmethods 6  typically consist of two parts: Feature extraction and combinatorial optimization. Whereas the first part is nowadays carried out by neural networks, the second is responsible for finding a one-to-one, possibly incomplete, matching. As shown in  , neural networks do not generalize on combinatorial tasks and cannot substitute combinatorial methods therefore. The architecture of neural networks of recent deep graph matching methods such as  or  is very similar. As a backbone they use a VGG16 4 or a similar convolutional network for visual feature generation and a graph neural network for their refinement and combination with geometric information. Apart from specific parameters of the used networks, the key differences are the type of combinatorial solvers used and\nhow differentiation through these solvers is dealt with. A number of combinatorial techniques have been proposed to address the matching problem itself, see the recent benchmark 9 and references therein. One distinguishes between linear and quadratic formulations, closely related to the linear and quadratic assignment problems (LAP and QAP resp.). These are deeply studied in operations research . Whereas the optimal linear assignment minimizes the sum of node-to-node (cf. keypoint-to-keypoint in Fig. 1) matching costs, the quadratic assignment penalizes pairs of nodes (pairs of keypoints) matched to each other. Most importantly, this allows to take into account relative positions of respective keypoints. The greater expressive power of QAPs comes at a price: In general this problem is NP-hard, whereas LAP can be exactly and efficiently solved with a number of polynomial algorithms, see a practical analysis in 0. Most learning pipelines, however, adopt an approximate LAP solver based on the Sinkhorn normalization (SN)  1 due to its inherent differentiability 3. Despite the computational difficulty of QAPs, best existing algorithms are able to provide high-quality approximate solutions for problems with hundreds of keypoints within one second or even less 9. This speed allows their direct use in end-to-end training pipelines provided there exists a way to differentiate through the solvers. The Differentiablity Issue.\nWhen incorporating a combinatorial solver into a neural network, differentiability constitutes the principal difficulty. Such solvers take continuous inputs (matching costs in our case) and return a discrete output (an indicator vector of an optimal matching). This mapping is piecewise constant because a small change of costs typically does not affect the optimal matching. Therefore, the gradient exists almost everywhere but is equal to zero. This prohibits any gradient-based optimization. The need for end-to-end differentiablity has given rise to various approaches that utilize differentiable relaxations of combinatorial optimization techniques 0 0  [ref]44  7 . At the end of their pipeline, all these methods use the Sinkhorn normalization. However, such methods are either limited to approximately solving the LAP, or are solver specific, when addressing the QAP. The most general technique providing a black-box differentiation of combinatorial solvers was proposed in . Applied to deep graph matching  it is still among the state-of-the art methods in this domain. We also make use of this technique in our work, but in the unsupervised setting. Multi-Graph Matching (MGM) is a generalization of graph matching for computing correspondences between multiple images of the same object.\nFrom an optimization point of view, the goal is to minimize the total matching cost between all pairs of such images given the cycle consistency of all matchings 6.\nThe problem is NP-hard even if the matching of each pair of objects is formulated as LAP  7.\nApart from optimization, recent works in this domain include also learning of the matching costs, see, e.g., . Contrary to these works, we do not enforce cycle consistency during inference, and only use it as a supervision signal for training. Unsupervised Deep Graph Matching.\nThe field of unsupervised deep graph matching is still under-studied. Essentially, it contains two works. The first one , referred to as GANN, uses cycle consistent output of an MGM solver as pseudo-ground truth for training a differentiable QAP-based matching.\nCosts involved in MGM as well as the QAP are updated during training, to make the output of both algorithms closer to each other in the sense of a cross-entropy loss.\nThe method is restricted to specific differentiable algorithms and biased to the sub-optimal solutions provided by the used MGM solver. The second unsupervised training technique called SCGM  is based on contrastive learning with data augmentation. Specifically, in the unsupervised training stage each image and the respective keypoint graph is matched to its augmented copies. The known mapping between original and modified keypoint graphs serves as ground truth. This technique can be applied with virtually any deep graph matching method as a backbone. Moreover, it can be used as a pre-training technique for our method, as demonstrated in Section 6. However, the augmentations are problem specific and dependent on an unknown data distribution. Also, SCGM uses two views of the same image to build its graph matching problem. It is thus biased towards complete matchings, which is a disadvantage in real world matching scenarios. Cycle Consistency\nas self-supervision signal has been used in various computer vision applications such as videos, e.g., [ref]44 or dense semantic matching . Another example is the seminal work 1 that leverages synthetic (3D CAD) objects to obtain correct (2D image-to-image) correspondences. In all these cases, however, one considers dense image matching and penalizes the Euclidean or geodesic distance between the first and the last point in a cycle. This type of loss does not fit the discrete setting, where nothing else but the number of incorrect matches has to be minimized, i.e., the Hamming distance between matches. Another approach used, e.g., in multi-shape matching, implicitly enforces cycle consistency by matching all objects to the universe . This, however, eliminates cycle consistency as a supervision signal, hence one has to use additional information in the unsupervised setting. This is the functional map that delivers a supervision signal in the recent multi-shape matching works  . However, the lack of a functional map makes this approach inapplicable to graph matching in general and in our application in particular. Finally, the recent work  uses a discrete cycle consistency as part of a loss to improve the matching results in a supervised setting. To differentiate the loss they use the direct loss minimization technique  that can be seen as a limit case of the black-box-differentiation method  utilized in our framework.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: any gradient-based optimization.
