As the most common form of VR contents, 360-degree/omnidirectional images and videos record visual information that covers the entire 180×360∘180superscript360180\\times{{360}^{{}^{\\circ}}} viewing spherical, thus attract a lot of attentions from both academy and industry during recent years . With the commercial head mount display (HMD), users are allowed to freely view any direction with the specific content by head movement, which is different from conventional 2D images and videos. Moreover, due to the omnidirectional viewing range, the resolution of 360-degree image/video is usually ultra-high, e.g. 4K, 8K, or even higher. These would bring many difficulties to the whole 360-degree image/video processing chain, such as acquisition, compression, transmission, reconstruction and display, etc . Additionally, the perceptual quality of omnidirectional images could be degraded in the 360-degree image/video processing systems. Therefore, the study on 360-degree/omnidirectional image quality assessment (OIQA) is more challenging and significant to guide the development of VR applications. Recently, there have witnessed ever-increasing interests in the research field of image quality assessment (IQA). Two types of IQA methods are involved, which consist of subjective IQA      and objective IQA   [ref]11  [ref]13. In subjective IQA tests, subjects are asked to give the human ratings for each viewed image. After data processing and outlier elimination, the mean opinion score (MOS) can be obtained by computing the average quality scores of all subjects for each image, which can be regarded as the quantitative ground truth of the perceptual quality . Since human is the ultimate viewer, subjective IQA is the most reliable quality assessment approach. By conducting such subjective experiments, several subjective OIQA databases have been established. For example, a testbed for the subjective measurement of 360-degree/omnidirectional contents was proposed , where 6 reference and 54 distorted omnidirectional images (OIs) were included. The JPEG compression with various quality parameters and two projection models are considered in this database. Moreover, in , 4 high fidelity uncompressed OIs were used to generate 100 impaired images with different geometric projections and three codecs, i.e. JPEG, JPEG2000, and HEVC intra. Four target bitrates were chosen to compress original OIs. The compressed VR image quality database (CVIQD) was built in , which includes 5 reference and 165 compressed OIs by JPEG, AVC, and HEVC codecs. Furthermore, this database was expanded as the CVIQD2018  with more visual contents, leading to 16 pristine and 528 compressed images. In , different resolutions and JPEG compression were considered, where the database has 12 original and 144 distorted OIs. In addition, an omnidirectional image quality assessment (OIQA) database 0 was developed, consisting of 16 reference and 320 distorted images. Apart from JPEG and JPEG2000 compression artifacts, different levels of white Gaussian noise and Gaussian blur were taken into account in this database. Since observers usually exploit the HMD to view OIs, the absolute category rating with hidden reference (ACR-HR) methods, which are also referred to as the single-stimulus (SS) methods, are adopted to build all these subjective quality assessment databases for OIs. However, subjective tests are generally time-consuming and labor-intensive. Thus, objective visual quality assessment algorithms used to automatically measure the perceptual quality of OIs are required. As shown in Fig. 1, (a) represents the projected equirectangular projection (ERP) map of a viewed VR scene. The projected ERP map usually has a higher resolution, such as 4K or 8K. Hence, it is suitable for multi-resolution decomposition, which is also an image decomposition in the frequency channels of constant bandwidth on a logarithmic scale. Moreover, the concept of multi-resolution can interpret multi-frequency channel decompositions 1. In this figure, except for the projected ERP map, (b) shows 6 viewports from a variety of viewing directions, each of which is a part of 360-degree image falling into the field of view (FoV) in the HMD. The naturalness characteristics reflected by statistical regularizations from the global ERP map and local viewports are different. In addition, a no-reference quality assessment model for 3D/stereoscopic omnidirectional images has been proposed in 2. The monocular multi-scale features are extracted from left and right views separately, while the binocular perception features are exploited from tensor decomposition and the absolute difference map as well as product image of left and right views. The naturalness features involved in the product image are also validated. Nevertheless, it is different from 2D omnidirectional images considered in this paper, where we only have one single view image with multiple viewports. Based on these observations, in this paper, we propose a novel no-reference (NR) OIQA method by Multi-Frequency Information and Local-Global Naturalness (MFILGN). First, according to a series of studies in neuroscience on the human visual system (HVS), the neuronal responses in the visual cortex are frequency-dependent 3. In other words, each neuron corresponds to specific spatial and temporal frequency signals. Therefore, the input visual signal can be decomposed into multiple frequency domains, which is more in line with the human visual perception. Among various multi-frequency channel decomposition methods, wavelet decomposition shows the superiority of processing visual signals 4. Meanwhile, the wavelet decomposition also has been demonstrated to have good performance in IQA 5 6. Motivated by this mechanism, we decompose the projected ERP maps into wavelet subbands through discrete Haar wavelet transform (DHWT). Since the decomposed low-frequency and high-frequency subbands represent luminance information and textural details, respectively. We then compute the entropy intensities of low-frequency and high-frequency subbands, which are used to measure the multi-frequency information of OIs. Second, due to different viewports during browsing, we propose the local-global naturalness measurement, where the natural scene statistics (NSS) features are extracted from both local viewed FoVs and global ERP maps. To the best of our knowledge, the naturalness has been proved in a number of IQA research 7 8 but it has not been used in OIQA. Finally, the quality predictions of OIs are obtained by the well-known support vector regression (SVR). As demonstrated by extensive experiments, our proposed MFILGN performs better than state-of-the-art FR and NR algorithms on two publicly available OIQA databases. The main contributions of this work are summarized as follows: We propose the first blind OIQA algorithm based on the measurements of multi-frequency information and local-global naturalness. According to the frequency-dependent characteristic of human visual cortex, we derive the decomposed low and high frequency subbands and utilize the entropy intensities of these subband images to reflect the multi-frequency information in omnidirectional images. Considering the viewing process of omnidirectional images, apart from the global naturalness from the projected ERP maps, we extract the local naturalness features from various viewports together with global NSS to composite the local-global naturalness measurement. The remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows. In Section II, we present the related works of objective quality assessment for both traditional 2D images and OIs. Section III introduces the proposed MFILGN model for NR OIQA in details. In Section IV, experimental results and analysis are presented. Section V concludes the whole paper with possible research directions in the future.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Immersive multimedia technologies, especially the virtual reality (VR), can provide viewers with more realistic and interactive user experience [ref]1.
