Unweighted Graph vs. Weighted Graph   Graphs can be distinguished into weighted and unweighted graphs based on the equality of weights assigned to their edges. Graphs characterized by equal edge weights are termed unweighted graphs, a common occurrence in various applications  . Modeling unweighted graphs is relatively straightforward, as demonstrated by Baswana et al. , who construct approximate distance oracles in expected O​(n2)𝑂superscript𝑛2O(n^{2}) time for unweighted graphs. Numerous methodologies, aimed at diverse tasks, rely on unweighted graphs, such as the improved parallel algorithm presented by Miller et al.  for decomposing an undirected unweighted graph into components with small diameters. Conversely, graphs with distinct edge weights, as observed in social networks where weights signify closeness  or in e-commerce networks where weights represent ratings , provide additional information. Analyzing weighted graphs requires specialized design and algorithms, including the consideration of weights in adjacency matrix decomposition  . For instance, Umeyama  discusses eigen decomposition of adjacency matrices for solving the weighted graph matching problem. Zhou et al.  introduce a novel definition of weighted coreness for vertices in a weighted graph and propose efficient algorithms for both weighted core decomposition and weighted core maintenance problems. \n B. Indirected Graph vs. Directed Graph  Indirected graphs are characterized by the presence of two symmetrical links for any types of edges, a configuration frequently encountered in applications such as community detection  and natural language processing .\nIn contrast to indirected graphs, directed graphs depict asymmetric relationships between nodes, rendering them more versatile and applicable across various domains. For example, Shi et al. [ref]83 represent skeleton data as a directed acyclic graph, leveraging the kinematic dependency between joints and bones in the natural human body. This directional representation proves indispensable for addressing complexities that cannot be adequately resolved using an indirected graph. \n Homogeneous Hypergraph.\nA homogeneous hypergraph can be defined as 𝒢=(𝒱,ℰ,𝒯)𝒢𝒱ℰ𝒯{\\mathcal{G}}=({\\mathcal{V}},{\\mathcal{E}},{\\mathcal{T}}). Here, v∈𝒱v𝒱v\\in{\\mathcal{V}} denotes the nodes.\ne∈ℰeℰe\\in{\\mathcal{E}}\ndenotes the hyperedge. 𝒯𝒯{\\mathcal{T}} denotes hyperedge type set, and |𝒯|=1𝒯1|{\\mathcal{T}}|=1 here.

Homogeneous Hypergraph vs. Heterogeneous Hypergraph  Hypergraphs are a graph structure wherein each edge can connect multiple nodes. The foundation of hypergraph theory can be traced back to , primarily concentrating on hypergraph segmentation and the generalization of conventional graph theories to hypergraphs. Subsequently, research on hypergraphs has expanded to encompass a broader spectrum of tasks and methodologies. For instance, Sun et al. [ref]86 introduce a hypergraph spectral learning formulation tailored for multi-label classification, leveraging hypergraphs to capture correlation information among diverse labels. In contemporary research, there is a growing introduction of deep learning methods for hypergraph representation. Feng et al.  propose a hyperedge convolution layer, expressed as: where 𝐇𝐇\\mathbf{H} represents the hypergraph adjacency matrix. 𝐗(l)superscript𝐗𝑙\\mathbf{X}^{(l)} and 𝐗(l+1)superscript𝐗𝑙1\\mathbf{X}^{(l+1)} denote the learned representations of nodes in the l𝑙l-th layer and l+1𝑙1l+1-th layer, respectively. Additionally, 𝐃esubscript𝐃𝑒\\mathbf{D}_{e} and 𝐃vsubscript𝐃𝑣\\mathbf{D}_{v} serve as hyperedge degree and node degree matrices, functioning as normalization terms. The matrices ΘΘ\\Theta and 𝐖𝐖\\mathbf{W} are trainable parameters. Prior research has predominantly focused on homogeneous hypergraphs (refer to Definition 2), often overlooking the heterogeneity inherent in hypergraphs, characterized by the presence of different types of hyperedges. Recent studies have recognized the significance of addressing this heterogeneity and propose models for heterogeneous hypergraphs (refer to Definition 3).\nFor instance, Sun et al.  introduce a novel approach by initially projecting the heterogeneous hypergraph into a sequence of snapshots. Subsequently, they employ a wavelet basis with an efficient polynomial approximation to perform localized hypergraph convolution. The consideration of heterogeneity in hypergraphs proves essential for addressing various applications, as exemplified in the study by St-Onge et al.  focusing on the investigation of contagions.\n\nReference markers found: [83]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]83: .\nIn contrast to indirected graphs, directed graphs depict asymmetric relationships between nodes, rendering them more versatile and applicable across various domains.
