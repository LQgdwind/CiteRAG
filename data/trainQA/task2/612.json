      "content": "Paper Title: Data-Efficient Ranking Distillation for Image Retrieval\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTraining dataset. We use the training dataset used in [ref]30. The dataset was initially introduced in [ref]34 and consists of 7.4 million internet photo collections of popular landmarks around the world. The images are passed through an SfM pipeline [ref]30 to create clusters of images (class labels). This process results in 163k images clustered into about 700 classes. Training dataset consists of randomly selected 550 classes containing 133k images. We refer to this dataset as SfMFr Network Training.\nWe used the publicly available trained Resnet101 models by Radenovic et al. [ref]31 trained on SfMFr as teacher models, TùëáT. MobileNetV2 (MVNetV2) and Resnet34 pre-trained on ImageNet  are used as the student models S1 and S2 repsectively. We randomly sample Dùê∑D = 4000 images from SfMFr. The network is trained with a batch size, BùêµB = 1000 which are randomly sampled from the training set, Dùê∑D. We used Adam  optimizer with an initial learning rate of l0subscriptùëô0l_{0} = 1√ó10‚àí41E-41\\text{\\times}{10}^{-4}, exponential decay l0‚Äãexp‚Å°(‚àí0.01√óe‚Äãp)subscriptùëô00.01ùëíùëùl_{0}\\exp(-0.01\\times ep) every epoch, e‚Äãpùëíùëùep. Weight decay was set to 1√ó10‚àí61E-61\\text{\\times}{10}^{-6}. Images were rescaled to 362 pixels on the longest side while maintaining the aspect ratio. Training is done for 30 epochs on GeForce RTX GPU with 11GB memory.\nWe use generalized mean pooling (GeM) [ref]31 to obtain global representations for each image. The global descriptors are subsequently l‚Äã2ùëô2l2 normalized. We list the hyper-parameters associated with our algorithm are œÑùúè\\tau = 0.75, RùëÖR = 10. We use the same hyper-parameter settings for both the student networks, S1 and S2. Baselines. We train MVNetV2, Resnet34 using contrastive loss (CL) and Average Precision (AP) loss on SfMFr dataset. For CL, we mine hard negatives every epoch from a random pool of 22K images, and keep top 5 negatives. Margin is set to 0.65. Batch size are 5 and 4000 for CL and AP respectively. The learning rate was set to 5√ó10‚àí75E-75\\text{\\times}{10}^{-7} for CL and 1√ó10‚àí41E-41\\text{\\times}{10}^{-4} for AP. Test dataset We evaluate our approaches on standard image retrieval benchmark datasets, Oxford5k (Oxf) ,Paris6k (Par) , ROxford5k (ROxf) , and RParis (RPar)  datasets. The evaluation metric is mean Average Precision (mAP). The test sets consists of 55 queries and several thousand database images (Oxf:5k, Par:6k), while their revisited counterparts have 70 queries each with 4k and 6k database images respectively. The revisited datasets also have 3 splits : Easy (E), Medium (M), and Hard (H) defining the difficulty level of retrieving the corresponding database images in the set . The queries are annotated with a bounding box specifying the landmark of interest. Similar to prior works, we crop the query images with bounding box. During evaluation, we extract multi-scale global representations with the scales: 1, 1/22\\sqrt{2}, and 1/2. The resulting descriptors are combined using GeM pooling. The resulting vector is l‚Äã2ùëô2l2 normalized. Furthermore, due to low sample complexity we do not use any validation data during training. Instead, we perform weight averaging  to combine model performances from different epochs. In particular, the final student network used for evaluation is obtained by averaging the weights of the trained student models from the 20th and 30th epoch. The number of parameters and average multi-scale inference time during evaluation are presented in Tab. 1 for teacher and student models.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: Training dataset.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
