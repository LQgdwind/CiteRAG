      "content": "Paper Title: A Complete Quantitative Axiomatisation of Behavioural Distance of Regular Expressions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe have presented a sound and complete axiomatisation of the shortest-distinguishing word distance between languages representing regular expressions through a quantitative analogue of equational logic¬†. Before our paper, only axiomatised behavioural distances of probabilistic/weighted transition systems existed, through (variants of) the Kantorovich/Wasserstein lifting¬†    , while we looked at a behavioural distance obtained through a more general coalgebraic framework¬†[ref]5. Outside of the coalgebra community, the shortest-distinguishing word distance and its variants also appear in the model checking¬†0 and in the automata learning¬†4 literature. We have followed the strategy for proving completeness from¬†. The interesting insight about that strategy is that it relies on properties that are not exclusive to distances obtained through the Kantorovich/Wasserstein lifting and can be established for notions of behavioural distance for other kinds of transition systems stemming from the coalgebraic framework. In particular, one needs to show that the monotone map on the lattice of pseudometrics used in defining the distance of finite-state systems is nonexpansive with respect to the sup norm (and hence œâùúî\\omega-cocontinuous) and has a unique fixpoint, thus allowing to characterise the behavioural distance as the greatest fixpoint obtained through the Kleene fixpoint theorem. This point of view allows one to reconstruct the fixpoint calculation in terms of axiomatic manipulation involving the (Cont) rule, eventually leading to completeness. We have additionally observed that in the presence of the infinitary (Cont) rule and the (ŒªùúÜ\\lambda-Pref) axiom, there is no need for a fixpoint rule, which is common place in all axiomatisations of regular expressions but also in other work on distances. In particular, the previous work on axiomatising a discounted probabilistic bisimilarity distance from¬† includes both (ŒªùúÜ\\lambda-Pref) and the fixpoint introduction rule, but its proof of completeness¬†[2, Theorem¬†6.4] does not involve the fixpoint introduction rule at any point. We are highly confident that in the case of that axiomatisation, the fixpoint introduction rule could be derived from other axioms in a similar fashion to the way we derived Salomaa‚Äôs rule for introducing the Kleene star¬†9. Additionally, we are interested in how much this argument relates to the recent study of fixpoints in quantitative equational theories¬†3. Moreover, the axiomatisations from¬†  rely on a slight modification of quantitative equational theories, which drop the requirement of all operations from the signature to be nonexpansive. This is dictated by the fact that the interpretation of Œºùúá\\mu-recursion in Stark and Smolka‚Äôs probabilistic process algebra¬† can increase the behavioural distances in the case of unguarded recursion, while in regular expressions recursive behaviour is introduced through Kleene‚Äôs star, whose interpretation is non-expansive with respect to the shortest-distinguishing-word distance. This allowed us to fit instantly into the original framework of quantitative equational theories. The earlier work¬† focusing on Markov processes¬† also relies on quantitative equational theories, but its syntax does not involve any recursive primitives. Instead, the recursive behaviour is introduced through Cauchy completion of a pseudometric induced by the axioms. The earliest works on axiomatising behavioural distances of weighted¬† and probabilistic¬† transition systems, studied before the introduction of quantitative equational theories, rely on ad-hoc inference systems that cannot be easily generalised. The pioneering works¬†3      laid foundations for behavioural (pseudo)metrics of various flavours of probabilistic transition systems. The coalgebraic point of view¬†[ref]5 allowed to generalise these ideas to a wide range of transition systems by moving from the Kantorovich/Wasserstein lifting to the abstract setting of lifting endofunctors from the category of sets to the category of pseudometric spaces. Building upon this theory, further lines of work were dedicated to asymmetric distances (called hemimetrics) through the theory of quasi-lax liftings¬†3, fuzzy analogues of Hennessy-Milner logic characterising behavioural distance¬†7 [ref]6, fibrational generalisations involving quantale-enriched categories¬†, up-to techniques allowing for efficient approximation of behavioural distances¬† and quantitative analogues of van Glabbek‚Äôs linear-time branching-time spectrum¬†5. In this paper, we have focused on the simplest and most intuitive instantiation of the coalgebraic framework in the case of deterministic automata, but the natural next step would be to generalise our results to a wider class of transition systems. A good starting point could be to consider coalgebras for polynomial endofunctors, in the fashion of the framework of Kleene Coalgebra¬†2. Alternatively, it would be interesting to look at recent work on a family of process algebras parametric on an equational theory representing the branching constructs¬†1 and study its generalisations to quantitative equational theories. A related and interesting avenue for future work are equational axiomatisations of behavioural equivalence of Guarded Kleene Algebra with Tests (GKAT)¬†3 1 and its probabilistic extension (ProbGKAT)¬†8, whose completeness results rely on a powerful uniqueness of solutions axiom (UA). The soundness of UA in both cases is shown through an involved argument relying on equipping the transition systems giving the operational semantics with a form of behavioural distance and showing that recursive specifications describing finite-state systems correspond to certain contractive mappings. It may be more sensible, particularly for ProbGKAT to consider quantitative axiomatisations in the first place and give the proofs of completeness through the pattern explored in this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: transition systems existed, through (variants of) the Kantorovich/Wasserstein lifting¬†    , while we looked at a behavioural distance obtained through a more general coalgebraic framework¬†[ref]5.
