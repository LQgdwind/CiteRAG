      "content": "Paper Title: Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning Models: A Comparative Study on a Decade of Sinhala Language Facebook Data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe results of this study exhibit a clear improvement of performance metrics in comparison to the work done by Senevirathne et al. . The differences among F1 scores of the two studies are visualized in Fig. 3. The size of the selected data set can be postulated as a major reason for the drastic improvement of results in this study; the data set we used is almost 10 times the size of the corpus used by Senevirathne et al. . As deep learning is generally data hungry [ref]29, the 15,0591505915,059 entries in their data set may have been insufficient to properly train the models.\nThe fact that a larger user annotated data set could produce better performance than a smaller manually annotated data set is a promising result for resource poor languages, for which manually annotated data sets are rather difficult to create or find in comparison to user annotated social media data sets. Even in the cases where manually annotated data is available, in configurations such as parallel corpora, it has been observed that the data is of poor quality for Sinhala [ref]30. The BiLSTM models outshine the rest of the models in the experiment, with the exception of the BiLSTM model with a CNN layer. This effect could be due to the ability of BiLSTM models to be trained in both positive and negative time directions \n, which is countered by upper layers in the stacked models filtering out contextual information from positive and negative time sequences when the model is paired with a CNN . In the work of Senevirathne et al. , the reason for the lack of performance of baseline models paired with a CNN layer is explained as the lack of data entries to train the model properly. Furthermore, since only one layer of one dimensional CNN layer is used, a different configuration of the CNN layer may alter the results. However, since changing the CNN layer configuration may lead to unfair comparison with the model used in the work of Senevirathne et al. no adjustment was done as discussed earlier in Section IV.\nThe HAHNN model [ref]18 shows the lowest improvement in the performance compared to other models. Since the HAHNN model focuses on the attention mechanism introduced by the work of Vaswani et al. , the lack of respect to strict grammatical structures observed in colloquial text in our corpus may have hindered the capability of HAHNN. The Core Reaction Set model and the Star Rating model taken from Jayawickrama et al. , being derived from classical statistical modeling, lack the complexity to perform well in the sentiment analysis task compared to other models. Thus, further improvements will be required in order for them to become effective sentiment analysis models. The word embedding model used in this work has been trained using the Sinhala News Comments data set. This can be replaced by a new word embedding trained using the Facebook data set itself, which could capture the relationships among words in the data set more effectively. Different word embedding models such as fastText, Word2vec , and Glove  with different dimensions could be tested to select the best embedding. The latest model known as transformers introduced by Vaswani et al.  is another area to be explored. Further research is needed to determine the performance of the model with the Sinhala language. However, transformers usually tend to be more data hungry than other deep learning models [ref]29. The implications of this on resource poor Sinhala may be an interesting study.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: reason for the drastic improvement of results in this study; the data set we used is almost 10 times the size of the corpus used by Senevirathne et al. .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
