      "content": "Paper Title: 2PS: High-Quality Edge Partitioning with Two-Phase Streaming\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, distributed graph processing frameworks, such as Pregel¬†, Giraph¬†, GPS¬† and PowerGraph¬†2, have emerged as a way to perform complex graph analytics on massive real-world graphs on a cluster of servers. In a distributed graph processing framework, the graph analytics algorithms are provided in form of a vertex function (‚Äúthink-like-a-vertex‚Äù), which is then executed iteratively until a convergence criterion is met¬†. In doing so, the different servers execute the vertex function on disjoint parts of the graph, which are called graph partitions. While executing the vertex function, on each server, updates on vertex states are computed. If such updates refer to a vertex that is part of a different partition, communication between servers is initiated in order to synchronize the state, which is costly and increases the run-time of the graph processing task.\nTo minimize the required communication between servers that perform distributed graph processing, the goal of edge partitioning is to divide the edges of the graph into kùëòk equally-sized partitions such that the number of vertex replications is minimized. The graph partitioning problem is known to be NP-hard, and hence, can only be solved heuristically for large graphs¬†. The current approaches to solve the edge partitioning problem can be categorized into two groups. Random-access partitioners¬†8 [ref]34   5 load the complete graph into memory and then perform partitioning on it. In contrast to this, streaming partitioners¬†    ingest the graph as a stream of edges, i.e., edge by edge, and assign each edge of the stream immediately and irrevocably to a partition. The streaming approach has the advantage that graphs can be partitioned with low memory overhead, as the edge set does not need to be kept in memory completely at any time. This way, the monetary costs of graph partitioning can be reduced, as smaller machines can be used for partitioning very large graphs. However, streaming edge partitioning yields a higher vertex replication than random-access approaches. We attribute this shortcoming to the uninformed assignment problem¬†: A streaming partitioner only has a partial view of the graph structure. In particular, when processing an edge eisubscriptùëíùëñe_{i} in the graph stream, the partitioner does not know the subsequent edges ei+1,ei+2,‚Ä¶subscriptùëíùëñ1subscriptùëíùëñ2‚Ä¶e_{i+1},e_{i+2},..., but still has to decide to which partition it shall assign eisubscriptùëíùëñe_{i}. Current approaches to overcome the uninformed assignment problem either do not apply to the edge partitioning problem¬† or require locality in the edge stream¬†. In this paper, we provide a method for streaming edge partitioning that overcomes the uninformed assignment problem and yields a significantly lower replication factor than existing streaming solutions. Our contributions are threefold: We propose 2PS, a novel two-phase streaming algorithm for edge partitioning. In the first phase, 2PS gathers information about the global graph structure by performing streaming clustering. In the second phase, clustering information is exploited to perform high-quality edge partitioning decisions. By combining two different algorithms, we exploit the flexibility of graph clustering and at the same time solve the more rigid edge partitioning problem. We provide a thorough theoretical analysis of 2PS regarding time and space complexity. Further, we prove that, on power-law graphs, the replication factor obtained with 2PS is strictly better than competing streaming partitioners. We perform extensive evaluations on large real-world graphs, showing the superior performance of 2PS compared to other streaming algorithms. On web graphs, 2PS yields a comparable replication factor to resource intensive random-access partitioners. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section¬†2, we formalize the problem of edge partitioning and introduce a model of stateful streaming partitioning. In Section¬†3, we introduce our novel 2PS algorithm for high-quality stateful streaming edge partitioning. In Section¬†4, we perform a thorough theoretical analysis of 2PS regarding time and space complexity as well as replication factor on power-law graphs. In Section¬†5, we perform extensive evaluations of 2PS on a variety of real-world graphs. Finally, in Section¬†6 we discuss related work and then conclude the paper in Section¬†7.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: NP-hard, and hence, can only be solved heuristically for large graphs¬†.
