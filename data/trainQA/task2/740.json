      "content": "Paper Title: Joint Policy Search for Multi-agent Collaboration with Imperfect Information\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMethods to Solve Extensive-Form Games. For two-player zero-sum extensive-form games, many algorithms have been proposed with theoretical guarantees. For perfect information game (PG), Œ±ùõº\\alpha-Œ≤ùõΩ\\beta pruning, Iterative Deepening depth-first Search¬†, Monte Carlo Tree Search¬† are used in Chess¬† and Go¬† , yielding strong performances. For imperfect information games (IG), Double-Oracle¬†, Fictitious (self-)play¬† and Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR¬† [ref]23) can be proven to achieve Nash equilibrium. These algorithms are coordinate-ascent: iteratively find a best response to improve the current policy, given the opponent policies over the history. On the other hand, it is NP-hard to obtain optimal policies for extensive-form collaborative IG where two agents collaborate to achieve a best common pay-off¬†. Such games typically have multiple sub-optimal Nash equilibria, where unilateral policy update cannot help¬†4. Many empirical approaches have been used. Self-play was used in large-scale IG that requires collaboration like Dota 2¬† and Find and Seek¬†. Impressive empirical performance is achieved with huge computational efforts. Previous works also model belief space (e.g., Point-Based Value Iteration¬† in POMDP, BAD¬†6) or model the behaviors of other agents (e.g., AWESOME¬†1, Hyper Q-learning¬†, LOLA¬†5). To our best knowledge, we are the first to propose a framework for efficient computation of policy improvement of multi-agent collaborative IG, and show that it can be extended to a sample-based form that is compatible with gradient-based methods and neural networks. Solving Imperfect Information Games. While substantial progress has been made in PG, how to effectively solve IG in general remains open. Libratus¬† and Pluribus¬† outperform human experts in two-player and multi-player no-limit Texas Holdem with CFR and domain-specific state abstraction, and DeepStack¬†[ref]29 shows expert-level performance with continual re-solving. ReBeL¬† adapts AlphaZero style self-play to IIG, achieving superhuman level in Poker with much less domain knowledge. Recently,¬† shows strong performance in Hanabi using collaborative search with a pre-defined common blueprint policy. Suphx¬† achieves superhuman level in Mahjong with supervised learning and policy gradient. DeepRole achieves superhuman level¬†3 in The Resistance: Avalon with continual re-solving¬†[ref]29. In comparison, Contract Bridge with team collaboration, competition and a huge space of hidden information, remains unsolved. While the playing phase has less uncertainty and champions of computer bridge tournament have demonstrated strong performances against top professionals (e.g., GIB¬†7, Jack¬†, Wbridge5¬†2), bidding phase is still challenging due to much less public information. Existing software hard-codes human bidding rules. Recent works¬† 2 8 use DRL to train a bidding agent, which we compare with. See Sec. 5 for details.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: Tree Search¬† are used in Chess¬† and Go¬† , yielding strong performances.
