      "content": "Paper Title: Deepfake Detection Scheme Based on Vision Transformer and Distillation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMost configured models in deepfake detection is based on the CNN structure. There are two approaches for discriminating deepfake videos. One is to exploit unnatural spatial properties within one frame of video as an image unit, and the other is to exploit temporal properties to find unnaturalness between video frames. Montserrat detects the space-time awkwardness by putting the frames of the video into the efficientnet and each feature into the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) [ref]36. Similarly, Güera use CNN to extract frame-level features and train a RNN that learns to classify fake videos [ref]19. In addition, Unlike previous studies using CNN and RNN networks to find out spatio-temporal properties, de Lima [ref]11 use 3DCNN to detect them at once. They use I3D , R3D , MC3  because of higher performing network architectures. As the method of optical flow based cnn, Amerini proposed a optical flow field to exploit possible inter-frame dissimilarities . To detect the spatial of manipulated in the face, Li  use CNN model such as VGG16 6, ResNet50, ResNet101, and ResNet152 . Nguyen proposed a capsule network that can detect various kinds of deepfakes . they use the features pretrained by VGG16 and suggested Capsule-Forensics architecture.\nClassical classification method using the SVM was proposed by Yang  and Guarnera used K-nearest neighbors and linear discriminant analysis .\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: find unnaturalness between video frames.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
