      "content": "Paper Title: “How Does It Detect A Malicious App?” Explaining the Predictions of AI-based Android Malware Detector\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe research efforts in the model explanation literature are mainly to reveal the transparency of the reasoning behind the model’s predictions based on the data features, a.k.a., input variables.\nThere are two major categories of the explanation approaches [ref]30:\ni) transparency-based methods; and\nii) post-doc interpretability methods.\nThe transparency-based methods  are the traditional model explanation strategy that conveys the interpretation of the predictions by interpretable AI models.\nThat is, these models cannot be too complicated in terms of structure and parameters’ numbers such that humans cannot understand .\nFor instance, in , the authors tried to enhance the interpretation of the SVM classifier’s predictions through the presentation of the features with top ranked weights. Unfortunately, as the complexity of the AI models grows, it is inevitably more difficult for these methods to identify meaningful explanations. In addition, it is trade-off for a model between the transparency for interpretability and the prediction performance [ref]30. The post-doc methods explored in the literature have raised more attention from both academia and industry.\nThey extract the causality relationships between the prediction and the data features from the trained (learned) model.\nThe early research in this field focused on the model-specific explanation that seek the rationale of predictions for specific models.\nFor example, Zeiler et. al.  proposed to visualize and observe the neurons in a convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that shows how each neuron responses to different data instances.\nXu et. al. [ref]34 developed an attention-based caption generator for the images, where the attention mechanism shows the highlighted part of the image that is relevant to the generation of a particular word in the caption.\nObviously, in the above methods, it is hard to extend the explanation to other models as the learning-based AI models are rapidly evolving today.\nTherefore, there are also several research that aim to develop the model explanation methods that can disclose the inference of predictions for any models, a.k.a., model-agnostic explanation.\nFor instance, Samek et. al.  present two methods for deep learning models: (1) sensitivity analysis (SA) that measures how sensitive the predictions are w.r.t. each input variables, and (2) layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) that propagates the prediction backward in the deep neural network, constrained by a set of propagation rules.\nSundararajan et. al.  propose a feature attribution method, integrated gradients (IGs), that was inspired by a cooperative gaming theory [ref]36.\nIt can explain the models that the input data are in different types , such as images, text and tabular data, only if the gradients of model’s prediction scores w.r.t. data features is provided.\nBesides, several efforts focusing on the complex model explanation that use model approximation. For example, LIME , a model-agnostic method for local explanation, explains any classifiers by learning an interpretable model, such as a linear model, with the generated data around the predictions.\nHowever, it has the risk that the linear model for interpretation through approximating the original model make the explanation is not capable of those models and datasets with complicated structure.\nAnother approach presented by Wu et. al. in  explains the deep models through the original model approximation with a decision tree with few nodes.\nThe model explanation research efforts also focus on explaining the AI models in different tasks, such as common sense question answering (CQA) .\nRecently, Guo et.al. 0 proposed LEMNA as the solution to LIME’s limitations that are caused by the linearity of its surrogate model.\nLEMNA is designed specific for the AI models that are used in cyber security tasks, which usually need to deal with sequential data, such as binary code analysis using RNN 1.\nThe linear approximation of the original model f​(𝐱)𝑓𝐱f(\\mathbf{x}) cannot take the dependencies among features into account that leads to limited capacity of explanation for sequential data.\nLEMNA solves this issue using the fused lasso 2, which forces the explanation considers the dependencies among features accordingly.\nIn addition, LEMNA enhanced the fidelity of the local approximation on the non-linearity of the neighborhoods (sampled) around the input data sample 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} by mixture regression model 3. There are also several development tools for explainable AI (xAI) that are public available online.\nThe What-If Tool 4 provides an interactive visual interface for users to inspect the models’ behaviors.\nIt works with Tensorflow models 5 as a dashboard that allows users to compare models and find out the importance of features by manipulating the data feature values.\nHowever, this is a tool that requires models running on Google Cloud, and the user-interface is not friendly for those other than data scientists.\nCaptum 6 is a Python library developed by Facebook recently that implements several model explanation methods, such as DeepLift 7, Input ×\\times Gradient 8 and Integrated Gradients .\nThe functionalities of Captum are under expansion, and this model explanation library currently is only able to explain the deep learning models written in PyTorch 9.\nSimilarly, SecML 0 provides a Python library that focuses on the secure and explainable AI algorithms.\nThere are limited number of model explanation methods provided in SecML library, because it is an integrated library that combines several machine learning, adversarial machine learning and explainable machine learning algorithms.\nIn addition, SecML only accepts the data instances in the type (i.e., CArray) that is defined in the library, which is not a requirement in our proposed method.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: mainly to reveal the transparency of the reasoning behind the model’s predictions based on the data features, a.k.a., input variables.\nThere are two major categories of the explanation approaches [ref]30:\ni) transparency-based methods; and\nii) post-doc interpretability methods.\nThe transparency-based methods  are the traditional model explanation strategy that conveys the interpretation of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
