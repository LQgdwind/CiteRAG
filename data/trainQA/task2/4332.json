Despite the numerous CNN models, their basic operators, convolution, are the same. Recently, [ref]11 proposed a pure transformer-based image classification model ViT, which achieves impressive performance on the ImageNet benchmark. DeiT  shows that well-trained ViT can obtain a better performance-speed trade-off than ConvNets. PVT  and Swin  propose multi-stage vision transformers, which can be easily transferred to other downstream tasks. On the other hand, recent papers are attempting to use only MLP as the building block. MLP-Mixer , ResMLP , and ViP  show that pure MLP architectures can also achieve near state-of-the-art performance. Combination of different operators.\nAnother line of work tries to combine different operators to form new networks. CvT  propose to incorporate self-attention and convolution by generating ùöÄùöÄ\\mathtt{Q}, ùô∫ùô∫\\mathtt{K}, and ùöÖùöÖ\\mathtt{V} in self-attention with convolution. CeiT  replace the original patchy stem with a convolutional stem and add depthwise convolution to the FFN layer, which obtains fast convergence and better performance. ConViT  tries to unify convolution and self-attention with gated positional self-attention and is more sample-efficient than self-attention. Many other works     also explored the combination of convolution and transformer to form hybrid architectures to improve the data or computation efficiency. Besides, ConvMLP  studied the combination of convolution and MLP, and gMLP  studied the combination of gated MLP and multi-head self-attentions (MSA). Instead of requiring manual exploration of the hybrid architectures, we propose a unified architecture search approach to automatically search for high-performance hybrid architecture. Downsampling module.\nIn ConvNets, the downsampling module (DSM) is implemented with strided-Conv or pooling. As DSM breaks the shift-invariant of convolution,  propose anti-aliased DSM to keep it. Besides, a line of works tries to preserve more information when downsampling with a learnable or dynamic kernel   . Most of their approaches are downsampling based on local context, which we show is not suitable for our unified network. In our work, we propose context-aware DSM and jointly search with operator combinations, which guarantees better performance.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: Convolution, Transformer, and MLP.\nA host of ConvNets have been proposed to push forward the state-of-the-art computer vision approaches such as [ref]17 [ref]37 .
