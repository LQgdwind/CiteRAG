Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7.

Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: SyreaNet: A Physically Guided Underwater Image Enhancement Framework Integrating Synthetic and Real Images\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur proposed SyreaNet is trained with PyTorch on a single NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU. The style transferor WCT2superscriptWCT2\\text{WCT}^{2}  is utilized for transferring inter-domain background knowledge, and the discriminator of PatchGAN  is employed as the UID. The training images are resized to 256√ó256256256256\\times 256 with a batch size of 12. The balanced weights Œªr‚Äãe‚Äãc,Œªc‚Äão‚ÄãnsubscriptùúÜùëüùëíùëêsubscriptùúÜùëêùëúùëõ\\lambda_{rec},\\lambda_{con} and Œªa‚Äãd‚ÄãvsubscriptùúÜùëéùëëùë£\\lambda_{adv} are set as 10, 1, and 2, respectively. Due to the difficulty of training the whole framework from scratch, the initial weights of PGDNet are pretrained by synthetic images without any DA strategies for 100 epochs with Adam optimizer of learning rate 1e-3. Then the whole framework is finetuned by both synthetic and real underwater images for 100 epochs with a learning rate of 1e-6. The synthesized images are based on 20k randomly selected in-air images from NYUDepth , SUNRGBD , KITTI [ref]38 and MegaDepth . There are 5k real underwater images randomly selected from UIEB [ref]39 and EUVP [ref]40 for training.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: by both synthetic and real underwater images for 100 epochs with a learning rate of 1e-6. The synthesized images are based on 20k randomly selected in-air images from NYUDepth , SUNRGBD , KITTI [ref]38 and MegaDepth . There are 5k real underwater images randomly selected from UIEB [ref]39 and EUVP [ref]40 for training.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
