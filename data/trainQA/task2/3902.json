      "content": "Paper Title: CSI-fingerprinting Indoor Localization via Attention-Augmented Residual Convolutional Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent decades, accurate positioning is receiving increasing interests as a key enabler for many location-based services, such as navigation, smart robots, and the internet of things. However, the widely-used\nglobal positioning system is not applicable in indoor scenarios since the line-of-sight (LOS) propagation between the mobile terminals (MTs) and the\nsatellites can be blocked. Therefore, many indoor positioning techniques have been proposed as alternative solutions. Among these alternatives, channel state information (CSI)-based fingerprinting localization has achieved increasing attention for its simplicity, broad applicability, and reliability     [ref]5. These CSI-fingerprinting localization methods usually consist of two phases: 1) an offline phase, where the CSI is measured at some spatially-distributed reference points (RPs) and a localization algorithm is developed based on the collected CSI-location dataset, and 2) an online testing phase, in which the developed localization algorithm is applied to predict the location of MT using real-time CSI. CSI-fingerprinting localization does not need to model the wireless channel explicitly and works for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. Inspired by the great success of deep learning, some works treat CSI as images and use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn the mapping from CSI measurements to two-dimensional terminal coordinates  [ref]7  . After training on the CSI-location pairs collected at the RPs, these CNN-based methods achieve higher positioning accuracy than the traditional probabilistic methods . Although the existing methods have successfully introduced deep CNN into the CSI-based fingerprinting indoor localization problem, we find that using a CNN architecture with a larger receptive field (RF) can improve the performance. Unlike in fully connected networks (FCNs), where the value of each pixel depends on the\nentire input, the value of a pixel in a CNN layer is only affected by the inputs in a region, which is defined as the RF of that CNN layer 0. As each pixel in one layer cannot see the input information outside its RF, it is essential to ensure the RF is large enough to cover all the relevant information for accurate decision making. For CSI-fingerprinting indoor positioning, the requirement for a large RF is significant as we need to leverage the channel responses on multiple non-neighbouring frequency bands and antennas to alleviate the influence of environmental noise 1 and fading . Besides the positioning system, a tracking system is usually\nbuilt to improve the localization accuracy for moving targets. As the motion patterns in an indoor environment are relatively fixed due to environmental restrictions, the tracking system can use the historical information on the trajectory to enhance the location estimation for the current timestamp 2. In the context of indoor tracking, a generic approach is to take the results from a positioning system as measurements and track the state of the target, including position, velocity, and acceleration, over time via Bayesian estimators 3 4 5. Nevertheless, the success of these parametric model-based methods relies on the accuracy of system models 6, which\nare difficult to estimate in many cases. To address the above problem, integrating the sensory data from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) into a tracking system is a popular direction 7 8. By using built-in IMUs, such as acceleration sensors and gyroscopes, step length and orientation can be estimated through the pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) approach 9, with which a more realistic system model can be built. Some learning-based tracking 0 1 2 or IMU-aided tracking methods 2 3 have recently been proposed for indoor environments. By exploring the correlation of CSI measurements or IMU data along a trajectory, these methods achieve better performance than stationary positioning systems\nand Bayesian filtering tracking systems. Despite the performance improvement, the generality of these learning-based tracking systems can be improved. Expressly, most existing tracking methods assume that the tracking network is trained for each indoor environment. At the same time, this is not easy as training a tracking system requires collecting precise positions and CSI/IMU measurements for a continuously moving target at discrete time instances, which are difficult to measure precisely without enough time and workforce 2. Also, existing works mainly focus on one type of IMU and do not consider the precision difference between different types of IMU. We find it impossible for a single network to handle IMU measurements with varying precision while training a specific model for each type is a huge burden. Therefore, it is necessary for a universal tracking system to be used across indoor environments and compatible for IMU equipment with arbitrary precision. In this paper, we consider both CSI-fingerprinting positioning and\ntracking. For positioning, we will enhance the feature extraction process of the positioning network by increasing its RF. Specifically, we first enlarge the RF by increasing the depth of our network with stacked residual blocks 4. Then, we extract global context from CSI through an attention-augmented convolutional operation 5. Besides, we re-model tracking as a denoising task, where the trajectory generated by a positioning system is a noisy observation of the true trajectory, and explore the inherent properties of indoor trajectories to mitigate the noise. These properties are expressed by a trajectory prior function in our work.\nAs the trajectory prior function is independent of the wireless propagation environments and positioning systems, our tracking system has better generality.  Moreover, for IMU-aided tracking systems, we consider the precision difference between different IMUs 6. We adopt the idea of plug-and-play (PnP) 7\nto integrate the IMU data into a learning-based tracking system in a model-based way, so that the precision difference problem can be handled by tuning the trade-off parameters in the model. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows: To improve the positioning performance, we develop a novel attention-augmented residual convolutional neural network (AAResCNN) for CSI-based fingerprinting indoor positioning. Experiments on publicly-released datasets show that our network can achieve higher localization accuracy than state-of-the-art (SOTA) CNN-based methods. We propose a universal tracking method by training a set of Gaussian Denoisers based on the deep trajectory prior function. Simulation results verify the generality of our tracking system for different environments. We use PnP to integrate IMU sensory data into the tracking system. Experiments on simulated datasets show that our methods perform better than learning-based and Bayesian filtering-based methods when the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) of IMU sensory data changes. In the remainder of the paper, related works are reviewed in\nSection II. In Section III, we present the overall architecture of our system, followed by our motivations and contributions. Sections IV, V and VI introduce our positioning, tracking, and IMU-aided tracking methods, respectively. The experimental setups and evaluation results are presented in Section VII. Finally, conclusions of our work are shown in Section VIII.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: solutions.
