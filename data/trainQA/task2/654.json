      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning in Bayesian Stackelberg Markov Games for Adaptive Moving Target Defense\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMulti-agent Reinforcement Learning in Markov Games ‚ÄÉ\nA standard solution strategy in MGs, when œÑùúè\\tau and UùëàU are unknown but a simulator is available, is to adapt the Bellman‚Äôs update used in the single-agent Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) for multi-agent reinforcement learning to learn equilibrium policies . In the context of MARL, researchers have investigated different notions of equilibrium. The min-max Q-learning is meaningful when the game has a zero-sum reward structure . On the other hand, Nash Q-learning, introduced in , has been categorized into two types by ‚Äì Friend, where the game defined by the Q-values always allows for an optimal joint action profile, and Foe, where the game admits a saddle point solution. The convergence of these algorithms is mostly shown by the fact that Q-values of the states in self-play, given infinite exploration, approach the correct Q-values (i.e. calculated Q-values if all the parameters of the game were provided upfront). The convergence of Nash Q-learning in the context of general-sum games becomes difficult because of the existence of multiple equilibria and the lack of a common incentive or co-ordination amidst agents .\nIn correlated equilibrium (CE) Q-learning , authors assume the existence of a correlation device accessible to both players. However, the authors show that the learned strategies of the players converge to an uncorrelated equilibrium. On the other hand, in Stackelberg Q-learning , there exists a leader-follower paradigm among the players, i.e .the leader‚Äôs strategy can be observed by a follower before the latter commits to an action. Convergence guarantees in self-play, although popular, become less meaningful when action sets of the players are different (defense configuration vs. exploits) and game utilities have a general-sum reward structure. The Landscape of Existing Games ‚ÄÉ\nWe seek to answer two questions‚Äì where does our BSMG fit in and why it is useful. In Figure¬†5, we graphically situate BSMG in the landscape of existing work.\nBSMG, as seen in the experiments, can generalize Markov Games  (and therefore, MDP). Instead of assuming infinite reasoning capabilities required for Bayesian Nash equilibrium , Bayesian Markov Game considers scenarios where players have finite levels of belief about other players(s) . On the other hand, Markov Games with Imperfect Information (MGIIs) assumes a Markovian property over the state, the observations, and the joint set of actions; this results in reasoning over opponent types and allows them to decompose Partially Observable Stochastic Games (POSGs)  into a set of Bayesian stage-games . In BSMGs, the assumption of a pre-specified distribution over attacker types helps us (1) avoid reasoning over the nested belief space, and (2) can be interpreted as the private information of the opponent in MGIIs (and POSGs) as being provided upfront.\nThus, BSMG becomes a special case of MGII and BMG with the added semantics of leader-follower interaction.\nOur assumptions (about modeling imperfect information) helps our game be scalable while providing adequate expressive power in the context of MTDs. Leader-follower scenarios ‚ÄÉ Researchers have investigated solution concepts in the context of Stochastic games with multiple-followers, but do not model incomplete information about them.222Extending the uncertainty over follower-types in BSMGs to multiple followers results in scalability issues. The interaction is generally modeled as a Semi-Markov Decision Process  and improvements consider (1) multiple followers , (2) factored state spaces [ref]45, (3) methods based on deep reinforcement learning   etc. Reinforcement Learning in MTDs Works that are precursors to our BSS-Q learning approach are the min-max Q-learning  in the context of complete information MGs and the Bayesian Nash Q-learning  for dynamic placement of sensors. Recent works that model the multi-agent cyber-scenarios as an MDPs (RL in Flip-it games ) or POMDPs (RL for MTDs ), as shown above, can generate policies that can be exploited by a strategic adversary.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: multiple followers results in scalability issues.
