      "content": "Paper Title: Open-Vocabulary DETR with Conditional Matching\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nObject detection, a fundamental computer vision task aiming to localize objects with tight bounding boxes in images, has been significantly advanced in the last decade thanks to the emergence of deep learning     . However, most object detection algorithms are unscalable in terms of the vocabulary size, i.e., they are limited to a fixed set of object categories defined in detection datasets  2. For example, an object detector trained on COCO 2 can only detect 80 classes and is unable to handle new classes beyond the training ones. A straightforward approach to detecting novel classes is to collect and add their training images to the original dataset, and then re-train or fine-tune the detection model. This is, however, both impractical and inefficient due to the large cost of data collection and model training. In the detection literature, generalization from base to novel classes has been studied as a zero-shot detection problem  where zero-shot learning techniques like word embedding projection 0 are widely used. Recently, open-vocabulary detection, a new formulation that leverages large pre-trained language models, has gained increasing attention from the community [ref]36 3. The central idea in existing works is to align detector’s features with embedding provided by models pre-trained on large scale image-text pairs like CLIP  (see Fig 1 (a)). This way, we can use an aligned classifier to recognize novel classes only from their descriptive texts. A major problem with existing open-vocabulary detectors [ref]36 3 is that they rely on region proposals that are often not reliable to cover all novel classes in an image due to the lack of training data, see Fig. 1(a). This problem has also been identified by a recent study 7, which suggests the binary nature of the region proposal network (RPN) could easily lead to overfitting to seen classes (thus fail to generalize to novel classes). In this paper, we propose to train end-to-end an open-vocabulary detector under the Transformer framework, aiming to enhance its novel class generalization without using an intermediate RPN. To this end, we propose a novel open-vocabulary detector based on DETR —hence the name OV-DETR—which is trained to detect any object given its class name or an exemplar image. This would offer greater flexibility than conventional open-vocabulary detection from natural language only. Despite the simplicity of end-to-end DETR training, turning it into an open-vocabulary detector is non-trivial. The biggest challenge is the inability to calculate the classification cost for novel classes without their training labels. To overcome the challenge, we re-formulate the learning objective as binary matching between input queries (class name or exemplar image) and the corresponding objects. Such a matching loss over diverse training pairs allows to learn useful correspondence that can generalize to unseen queries during testing. For training, we extend the Transformer decoder of DETR to take conditional input queries. Specifically, we condition the Transformer decoder on the query embeddings obtained from a pre-trained vision-language model CLIP , in order to perform conditional matching for either text or image queries. Fig. 1 shows this high-level idea, which proves better at detecting novel classes than RPN-based closed-set detectors. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two challenging\nopen-vocabulary object detection datasets, and show consistent improvements in performance. Concretely, our OV-DETR method achieves 17.417.417.4 mask mAP of novel classes on the open-vocabulary LVIS dataset 3 and 29.429.429.4 box mAP of novel classes on open-vocabulary COCO dataset [ref]36, surpassing SOTA methods by 1.31.31.3 and 1.81.81.8 mAP, respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: embedding projection 0 are widely used.
