      "content": "Paper Title: PGADA: Perturbation-Guided Adversarial Alignment for Few-shot Learning Under the Support-Query Shift\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, deep learning models have celebrated success in several computer vision tasks   , which require large amounts of labeled data. However, collecting sufficient labels to train the model parameters involves considerable human effort, which is unacceptable in practice . Moreover, the labels of training data and testing data are usually disjoint, i.e., the labels in the testing phase are unseen in the training phase. In contrast, few-shot learning aims to learn the model parameter by a handful of training data (support sets) and adapt to the testing data (query sets) [ref]30 [ref]11 , effectively. In the testing phase, the model classifies the query set into the support sets according to the distance of their embeddings. While these approaches extract rich contextual features from the images, the embeddings from the support set and the query set usually exhibit certain distribution shifts, i.e., the Support-Query Shift . For example, the images are captured by various devices, e.g., smartphones and single-lens reflex cameras in different environments, e.g., foggy and high-luminance. Since the learned embeddings are located in different spaces, degrading the model performance, optimal transportation  has been proposed to stage the embeddings from different domains into the same latent space. However, in this paper, we theoretically prove that optimal transport can be easily misguided by small perturbations in the images (as illustrated in Fig. 1). Meanwhile, several training techniques   have been proposed to derive a more robust embedding model against the perturbations. On the one hand, data augmentation methods transform a single image 5 or combine multiple images   to create more training samples at pixel level. However, these methods cannot create new information which is not included in the given data . On the other hand, adversarial training methods such as projected gradient descent (PGD) 3, AugGAN  are used to find the perturbed images to confuse the model, i.e., predicting an incorrect label, as the additional training samples. However, these methods usually require numerous iterations to generate the adversarial examples by optimizing a predefined adversarial loss, which is computationally intensive. Besides, a clear trade-off has been shown between the accuracy of a classifier and its robustness against adversarial examples . To address the above issues, we propose Perturbation-Guided Adversarial Alignment (PGADA) to relieve the negative effect caused by the small perturbations in the support-query shift. PGADA aims to generate the perturbed data as the hard examples, i.e., less similar to the original data point in the embedding space but still classified into the same class. Next, the model is trained on these generated data by minimizing the empirical risk to enhance the embedding model’s robustness of noise tolerance. We further introduce smooth optimal transport, which regularizes the negative entropy of the transportation plan to take more query data points as the anchor nodes, leading to a higher error tolerance of the transportation plan. The contributions of this work are summarized as follows. We formally investigate how the perturbation in the images would affect the results of optimal transportation under the Support-Query Shift. We propose Perturbation-Guided Adversarial Alignment (PGADA) to relieve the misalignment problem from small perturbations via deriving a more robust feature extractor and a smooth transportation plan under distribution shifts. Extensive experiments manifest that PGADA outperforms eleven state-of-the-art methods by 10.91%percent10.9110.91\\% on three public datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: phase are unseen in the training phase.
