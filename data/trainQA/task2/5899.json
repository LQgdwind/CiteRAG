      "content": "Paper Title: TPMCF: Temporal QoS Prediction using Multi-Source Collaborative Features\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe now present the rationale behind our model selection and the justification for having various modules of TPMCF through the ablation study. Model Selection: Table VII presents the performance of TPMCF in terms of MAE as compared to other models that can be used to generate spatial and temporal features. We have the following observations from Table VII. (i) We first compare GCMF with graph attention network (GAT)  and graph convolutional network (GConv)  on the RT-10 dataset. As evident from Table VII, TPMCF achieved an improvement of 55.44% and 38.54% over GAT+PTE and GConv+PTE architectures, respectively. This experiment shows the effectiveness of GCMF in TPMCF. (ii) We further implemented the temporal QoS prediction block using LSTM [ref]45 and GRU . TPMCF achieved an improvement of 18.62% and 19.41% over GCMF+LSTM and GCMF+GRU architectures, respectively. This experiment explains the importance of the PTE as part of the temporal QoS prediction block. Module Ablation:\nTable VIII presents the ablation study for various modules in TPMCF. We have the following observations from Table VIII. (i) TPMCF achieved on average 14.65% improvement over the stand-alone GCMF, which justifies the requirement of temporal QoS prediction block. (ii) TPMCF achieved on average 14.16% improvement over the stand-alone transformer encoder with temporal features. This implies the necessity of capturing the spatial features along with the temporal dependencies. Feature Ablation:\nTable IX presents the feature ablation study for TPMCF. As observed from Table IX, TPMCF with the combined features outperformed the same model with individual feature categories, as discussed in Section III-A1. On the one hand, this experiment shows the significance of using the collaborative features derived from domain knowledge apart from the other auto-extracted features used for QoS prediction. On the other hand, it justifies using the different sets of features extracted to employ in TPMCF. In summary, TPMCF achieved higher prediction accuracy than the SoA methods, all the while maintaining reasonably fast prediction times.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: and 38.54% over GAT+PTE and GConv+PTE architectures, respectively.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
