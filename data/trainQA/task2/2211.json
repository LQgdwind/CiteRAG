      "content": "Paper Title: DiGS : Divergence guided shape implicit neural representation for unoriented point clouds\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe task of surface reconstruction of unoriented point clouds is specified as follows. Given an input point cloud ùí≥‚äÇ‚Ñù3ùí≥superscript‚Ñù3\\mathcal{X}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{3} find the surface ùíÆùíÆ\\mathcal{S} from which ùí≥ùí≥\\mathcal{X} was sampled. The point set is usually acquired by a 3D scanner which introduces various types of data corruptions, e.g., noise, occlusions, nonuniform sampling. We evaluate the performance of our method on the Surface Reconstruction Benchmark dataset  and on ShapeNet . We compare our results to recent prominent methods, most of which have shown to outperform classical methods, including SAL , IGR , SIREN [ref]37, DGP [ref]44 and NSP [ref]45.\nNote that apart from SAL, these methods report results using normal vector supervision, therefore for fair comparison we evaluate on SIREN and IGR without the normal vector loss term (note that the same cannot be done with DGP and NSP).\nFurthermore we compare to results reported from the concurrent work PHASE 6, who evaluate on SRB. While PHASE uses normal information, they also provide a version without normals that uses Fourier features, PHASE+FF, and a baseline for IGR without normal information, IGR+FF. Surface Reconstruction Benchmark (SRB).\nWe use the simulated scan and ground truth data provided in Williams¬†et¬†al. [ref]44 (freely available for academic use). The dataset contains five shapes, each with it own challenging traits, e.g., complex topology, high level of detail, missing data, and different feature sizes. In Table¬†2 we report the average Chamfer and Hausdorff distance for the shapes, and since the shapes have varying difficulties, we also report the mean deviation from the best performing method for each shape.\nIt shows that our method is consistently better than SoTA methods on both metrics when normal information is not available.\nQualitative results for a subset of the dataset are shown in Figure¬†6. In the absence of normal information, SIREN and IGR struggle to converge to the correct zero level set and produce undesired artifacts (ghost geometries).\nDiGS, on the other hand, is able to remove such artifacts. When compared to the version with normal supervision added there is not much change other than DiGS being slightly smoother. In fact, DiGS manages to get similar results to the methods that use normal supervision.\nFor extended results (results per shape, results with normal supervision and more metrics), visualization of all shapes and a video showing the shapes from multiple angles, see the supplemental material. ShapeNet.\nThe ShapeNet dataset contains 3D CAD models of a diverse range of objects. These shapes often have internal structure, inconsistent normals, and non-manifold meshes. We use the preprocessing and split of Williams¬†et¬†al.¬†[ref]45, who evaluate on 20 shapes in each of 13 categories, and preprocess to make the normals consistent and internal structure to be manifold meshes.\nThe results are reported in Table¬†3 and we provide visualizations in Figure¬†7. When adding normal supervision to DiGS, our method has a much better median squared Chamfer distance and median IoU among the 260 shapes. We attribute this to our divergence term smoothing out the space, which does well on shapes without much internal structure. However for some shapes with internal structure (e.g., a loudspeaker with components inside or a sofa with structural beams) we get significant internal ghost geometry. As a result our mean squared Chamfer distance, while competitive with the other methods, is worse than methods such as SIREN. Note, however, that ths does not affect the IoU as much, our mean IoU is still better than other methods. When comparing without normals, DiGS has similar medians on both metrics to when normal supervision is added, however it has better means. We attribute this to having fewer internal ghost geometries when not attempting to fit normal vectors at internal points.\nNote that DiGS outperforms other methods that do not use normal supervision on both metrics. The improvement in IoU is significant, which we attribute to other methods failing to contain ghost geometry and being inconsistent with what is inside/outside the shape. On the other hand, DiGS appropriately deals with both of these challenges by its structured training procedure. Scene reconstruction.\nQualitative results for scene reconstruction are presented in Figure¬†8. Here we use eight layers with 512 units and train on the scene from Sitzmann¬†et¬†al.¬†[ref]37 which includes 10M oriented points.\nWe train SIREN with and without the normal constraint, and the proposed DiGS method. In this experiment we did not use a geometric initialization because, unlike the shape reconstruction task, the target surface is vastly different than a sphere, and instead only increase the frequencies. When training SIREN without normal supervision we observe many ghost geometries (SIREN wo n). On the other hand, DiGS is able to reconstruct the scene without these, though it produces a very smooth result. This is desirable in most planar regions, e.g., ceiling, floor and table, however, this trait has the drawback of smoothing out fine details, e.g., sofa legs and picture frame.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: Surface Reconstruction Benchmark dataset  and on ShapeNet . We compare our results to recent prominent methods, most of which have shown to outperform classical methods, including SAL , IGR , SIREN [ref]37, DGP [ref]44 and NSP [ref]45.\nNote that apart from SAL, these methods report results using normal vector supervision, therefore for fair comparison we evaluate on SIREN and IGR without the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
