The work of the first author is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 12201053 and 12171043.

It is well known that fully connected networks are universal approximators for continuous functions [ref]11  9.\nFurther research primarily concentrated on how the width and depth of models influence their UAP.\nAn estimation has been made of the lower bound for the minimum width required by networks to achieve UAP  [ref]30. It has also been demonstrated that the depth of the network is crucial, as increasing the network depth can enhance the expression power  2 4.\nOur work considers the network with arbitrary width, aligning with conventional scenarios.\nHowever, the constraints on parameters imposed by permutation training introduce non-trivial complexities and challenges not encountered in traditional free training methods. Permutation, as a typical group structure, has been systematically described . In deep learning, it closely relates to permutation equivariant or invariant networks  designed to learn from symmetrical data  5.\nIt is also evident in graph-structured data which inherently exhibit permutation invariance  .\nHowever, permutation training is not limited to the issues with intrinsic symmetry. As for the weight permutation attempts, Qiu and Suda  empirically proposed the first (to our knowledge) weight-permuted training method. This method preserves the initialized weight value, allowing more efficient and reconfigurable implementation of the physical neural networks  .\nOur work provides theoretical guarantees of this method and considers some regression tasks numerically. Additionally, initialization can be improved by rewiring neurons from the perspective of computer networks , but the training methods are unchanged. Permutation training is also closely related to the permutation symmetry and linear mode connectivity (LMC)  . The LMC suggests that after a proper permutation, most SGD solutions under different initialization will fall in the same basin in the loss landscape.\nSimilarly, permutation training also seeks a permutation to improve performance. Therefore, the search algorithms utilized in LMC indicate the possibility of more efficient permutation training algorithms, as the fastest algorithm can search a proper permutation of large ResNet models in seconds to minutes  4.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: The UAP has been extensively studied in various settings, leading to many efficient applications.
