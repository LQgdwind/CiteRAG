      "content": "Paper Title: A Rewriting Theory for Quantum ùúÜ-Calculus\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor quantum ŒªùúÜ\\lambda-calculi without measurement, hence\nwithout probabilistic behavior, confluence\n  (and even a special form of\nstandardization ) have been studied since early work.\nWhen dealing with measurement, the analysis is far more\nchallenging. To our knowledge, only confluence has been studied, in\npioneering work by Dal Lago, Masini and Zorzi\n.\nRemarkably, in order to deal with probabilistic and asymptotic\nbehavior, well before the advances in probabilistic rewriting of which\nwe profit, the authors introduce a very elaborated technique. Notice that in  reduction\nis non-deterministic, but restricted to surface reduction. In\nour paper, their result roughly corresponds to the diamond property of\n‚áíùóåsubscript‚áíùóå\\mathrel{\\mathop{\\Rightarrow}\\limits_{\\vbox to0.0pt{\\kern-6.0pt\\hbox{$\\scriptstyle\\mathsf{s}\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ $}\\vss}}}, together with Thm.¬†7.3. No ‚Äústandard‚Äù standardization results (like the classical\nones we recall in Table¬†1) exist in the literature for the\nquantum setting. Notice that the form of standardization in\n is a reordering of the (surface)\nmeasurement-free reduction steps, so to perform first beta\nsteps, then quantum steps, in agreement with the idea that a quantum\ncomputer consists of a classical device ‚Äòsetting up‚Äô a quantum\ncircuit, which is then fed with an input. A similar refinement is\nalso possible for the corresponding fragment of our calculus (namely\nmeasurement-free ‚Üíùóåsubscript‚Üíùóå\\mathrel{\\mathop{\\rightarrow}\\limits_{\\vbox to0.0pt{\\kern-6.0pt\\hbox{$\\scriptstyle{\\mathsf{s}}$}\\vss}}}), but clearly does not scale: think of\n(Œªx.x)ùöñùöéùöäùöú(UHùöóùöéùö†,M,N)(\\lambda x.x)\\,\\mathtt{meas}({U_{H}\\,\\mathtt{new}},{M},{N}), where the argument of a function is\nguarded by a measurement. Our term language is close to . How such a\ncalculus relate with a Call-by-Value ŒªùúÜ\\lambda-calculus such as\n? A first level of answer is that our setting\nis an untyped ŒªùúÜ\\lambda-calculus; linear abstraction, together\nwith well forming rules, allows for the management of quantum data. In\n, the same role is fulfilled by the (Linear\nLogic based) typing system. Despite these differences, we do expect that our results can be\ntransferred. As already mentioned, the redex (Œª!x.M)!N(\\lambda^{!}x.M)!N\nreflects a Call-by-Push-Value mechanism, which in untyped form\nhas been extensively studied in the literature with the name of\nBang calculus   , as a uniform framework to encode both\nCall-by-Name (CbN) and Call-by-Value\n(CbV).\nSemantical but also syntactical properties, including\nconfluence   and\nstandardization   are\nanalyzed in the Bang setting, and then transferred via reverse\nsimulation to both CbV and CbN. More precisely, a CbV\n(resp. CbN) translation maps forth-and-back weak (resp. head)\nreduction into surface reduction. Surface normal forms are the CbV\nimage of values (and the CbN image of head normal forms).\nSince the Bang calculus is exactly the fragment of Simpson‚Äôs\ncalculus  without linear abstraction, one may\nreasonably expect that our calculus can play a similar role in the\nquantum setting. It seems however that a back-and forth translation of\nCbV (or CbN) will need to encompass types. A last line of works worth mentioning is the series of works based on\nLineal\n  [ref]18. However,\nthese works differ from our approach in the sense that the\nŒªùúÜ\\lambda-terms themselves are subject to superposition: the distinction\nbetween classical and quantum data in an untyped setting is unclear.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: the\nquantum setting.
