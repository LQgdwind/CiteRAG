In    ,\nTRSs were extended to the probabilistic setting.\nProbabilistic programs describe randomized algorithms and probability\ndistributions, with applications in many areas, see, e.g., 1.\nInstead of only considering ordinary termination (i.e., absence of\ninfinite evaluation sequences),\nin the probabilistic setting one is interested in almost-sure termination (𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST}),\nwhere infinite evaluation sequences are allowed, but their probability is 00.\nA strictly stronger notion is positive 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} (𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{PAST}), which requires that\nthe expected runtime is finite  3. There exist numerous techniques to prove (𝙿)​𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{(P)AST} of\nimperative programs on numbers (like the probabilistic guarded command language\npGCL  [ref]38), e.g.,\n6  0  1 7 5 0 5 1  2. In contrast,\nprobabilistic TRSs (PTRSs) are especially suitable for modeling and analyzing functional programs and\nalgorithms operating on (user-defined)\ndata structures like lists, trees, etc. Up to now,\nthere exist only few automatic approaches to analyze (𝙿)​𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{(P)AST} of probabilistic programs with complex non-tail recursive\nstructure  2 3. The\napproaches that are suitable for algorithms on recursive data structures\n8  \nare mostly specialized for specific data structures and cannot easily be adjusted to\nother (possibly user-defined) ones, or are not yet fully automated.\nIn contrast,  our goal is\na fully automatic termination analysis for arbitrary PTRSs. For PTRSs, orderings based on interpretations were adapted to prove\n𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{PAST} offull rewriting (w.r.t. any evaluation strategy)\nin ,\nand we presented a relatedtechnique to prove 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} in\n8.\nHowever, already for non-probabilistic TRSs, such\na direct application of orderings is limited in power.\nTo obtain a powerful approach, one should\ncombine orderings in a modular way, as in the DP framework. Indeed, based on initial work in 8,\nin [ref]31 we adapted the DP framework to the probabilistic setting to prove\ninnermost AST (𝚒𝙰𝚂𝚃𝚒𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{iAST}) of PTRSs\nvia so-called annotated dependency pairs (ADPs).\nHowever, this adaption is restricted to innermost rewriting,\ni.e., one only considers sequences that rewrite at innermost positions of terms.\nAlready for non-probabilistic TRSs, innermost termination is easierto prove than full termination,\nand this remains true in the probabilistic setting. In the current paper, we adapt the definition of\nADPs to use them for any evaluation strategy.\nAs our running example, we transform Alg. 1 on the right (written in pGCL) into\nan equivalent PTRS and show howour new ADP framework proves 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST}.\nHere, ⊕1/2subscriptdirect-sum12\\oplus_{\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}} denotes probabilistic choice, and □□\\square denotes demonic non-determinism.\nNote that there are proof rules (e.g., ) and tools (e.g., 1) that can\nprove 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} for both loops of Alg. 1 individually, and hence for the whole algorithm.\nMoreover, the tool Caesar 4\ncan prove 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} if one provides\nsuper-martingales for the two loops. However, to the best of our knowledge\nthere exist no automatic techniques to handle similar algorithms on\narbitrary algebraic data structures, i.e., (non-deterministic) algorithms\nthat first create a random data object y𝑦y in a first loop\nand then access or modify it in a second loop,\nwhereas this is possible with our new ADP framework.111Such examples can be found in our benchmark set,\nsee Sect. 5 and App. 0.A.\nNote that while Alg. 1 is 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST}, its expected runtime is\ninfinite, i.e., it is not 𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{PAST}.222This already holds for the program\nwhere only the first possibility of the first while-loop is considered (i.e., where y𝑦y\nis always doubled in its body). Then for the\ninitial value y=1𝑦1y=1, the expected number of\niterations of the second while-loop which decrements y𝑦y is 12⋅2+14⋅4+18⋅8+…=1+1+1+…=∞⋅122⋅144⋅188…111…\\tfrac{1}{2}\\cdot 2+\\tfrac{1}{4}\\cdot 4+\\tfrac{1}{8}\\cdot 8+\\ldots=1+1+1+\\ldots=\\infty. In , we developed the first criteria for classes of PTRSs where 𝚒𝙰𝚂𝚃𝚒𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{iAST} implies\n𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST}. So for PTRSs from these classes, one can use our ADP framework for 𝚒𝙰𝚂𝚃𝚒𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{iAST} in order to\nconclude 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST}. However, these criteria exclude non-probabilistic\nnon-determinism,\ni.e., they require that the rules of the PTRS must be non-overlapping. In addition, they impose\nlinearity restrictions on both sides of the rewrite rules.\nIn contrast, our novel ADP framework can be applied to overlapping PTRSs and\nit also weakens the linearity requirements considerably. We start with preliminaries on (probabilistic) term rewriting in Sect. 2.\nIn Sect. 3 we recapitulate annotated dependency pairs\nfor innermost 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} [ref]31,\nexplain why they cannot prove 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST} for full rewriting, and adapt them accordingly.\nWe present the probabilistic ADP framework in Sect. 4,\nillustrate its main processors, and show\nhow to adapt them from 𝚒𝙰𝚂𝚃𝚒𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{iAST} to 𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚃\\mathtt{AST}.\nFinally, in Sect. 5 we evaluate the implementation\nof our approach in the tool\nAProVE .\nWe refer to App. 0.A to illustrate our approach on examples with non-numerical data structures\nlike lists or trees, and to App. 0.B for all proofs.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: that\nthe expected runtime is finite  3.
