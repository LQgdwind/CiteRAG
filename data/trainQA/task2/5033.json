      "content": "Paper Title: On the Privacy Risks of Algorithmic Recourse\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMachine learning (ML) models are increasingly being deployed in domains such as finance, healthcare, and policy to make a variety of consequential decisions. As a result, there is a growing emphasis on providing recourse to individuals who have been adversely impacted by the predictions of these models . For example, an individual who was denied a loan by a predictive model employed by a bank should be informed about what can be done to reverse this decision.\nSeveral approaches in the recent literature tackled the problem of providing recourse by generating counterfactual explanations   1    which highlight what features need to be changed and by how much to flip a model’s prediction. For instance, Wachter et al.  proposed a gradient based approach to find the nearest counterfactual resulting in the desired prediction. More recently, Karimi et al.   advocated for leveraging the causal structure of the underlying data when generating recourses   . As algorithmic recourses seep into real-world applications, adversaries could potentially exploit these recourses to extract information about the underlying models and their training data, thereby leaking sensitive information (e.g., a bank’s customer data) and enabling fraudulent activities. Therefore, there is a clear and urgent need to investigate the privacy risks associated with algorithmic recourse.\nWhile there is extensive literature on privacy attacks and defenses for machine learning models    , there is very little research [ref]34 [ref]2 that focuses on the privacy risks that arise when adversaries have access to explanations which highlight the rationale behind one or more model predictions. Recently, Shokri et al. [ref]34 studied if and how feature attribution based explanations (which capture the feature importances associated with individual model predictions) leak sensitive information, and  Aïvodji et al. [ref]2 developed model extraction (i.e., reconstructing the underlying model) attacks against counterfactual explanations. However, neither of these works explore if and how adversaries may leverage recourses to infer sensitive information about the underlying model’s training data. In this work, we address the aforementioned gaps by initiating a study of if and how an adversary can leverage algorithmic recourses to leak sensitive information about the training data of the underlying model.\nTo this end, we introduce a general class of membership inference attacks called counterfactual distance-based attacks which leverage algorithmic recourse to determine if an instance belongs to the training data of the underlying model or not. In formulating this new class of attacks, we exploit the intuition that the distance between an instance and its corresponding recourse may capture information about whether that instance was used to train the model. We instantiate the aforementioned class of attacks to propose two novel membership inference attacks. Our first attack infers membership by thresholding on the distance between a given instance and its corresponding algorithmic recourse. Our second attack draws inspiration from state-of-the-art loss-based membership inference attacks  7 and proposes a likelihood ratio test (LRT) that accounts for algorithmic recourse.\nOur attacks operate under the assumption that the adversary can only query the recourse algorithm once. This assumption is a lot more practical than those considered in related works [ref]2, and is inline with real-world settings where an end user would typically be provided with a single recourse and will not be able to query the underlying model or recourse algorithm multiple times 1 . To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to introduce membership inference attacks which leverage algorithmic recourse. We experiment with multiple real world datasets spanning diverse domains such as lending, healthcare, and law to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed attacks. Our experimental results clearly demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed attacks, and highlight significant privacy leakage through recourses generated by a wide range of recourse algorithms. In addition, the proposed attacks also outperform the state-of-the-art loss-based membership inference attacks (which do not leverage recourses) on data with sufficiently high dimensionality, thus highlighting the promise of our recourse-based attacks as generic membership inference attacks. We also empirically analyze the factors contributing to the success of our attacks, and find that our attacks are highly successful when the underlying model overfits to the training data  and the dimensionality of the data is high. Overall, our results establish unintended privacy leakage as an important risk in the widespread adoption of recourse algorithms.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: investigate the privacy risks associated with algorithmic recourse.\nWhile there is extensive literature on privacy attacks and defenses for machine learning models    , there is very little research [ref]34 [ref]2 that focuses on the privacy risks that arise when adversaries have access to explanations which highlight the rationale behind one or more model predictions.
