      "content": "Paper Title: RP-SLAM: Real-time Photorealistic SLAM with Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe computational and storage efficiency of RP-SLAM is demonstrated through a comprehensive evaluation of the Replica[ref]22, TUM, and ScanNet++[ref]23 datasets, as detailed in Tab. I to IV. The results demonstrate that RP-SLAM ensures photorealistic reconstruction while maintaining a compact model size and achieving a high frame rate in comparison to state-of-the-art methods. The high frame rates achieved by RP-SLAM can be attributed to the decoupling of camera tracking from Gaussian primitives optimization. By employing ORB-SLAM3 for direct camera pose estimation, RP-SLAM circumvents the arduous iterative procedure necessitated for the optimization of the camera pose with respect to the scene representation. This separation permits the system to allocate computational resources in a more efficient manner, thereby achieving real-time performance. As illustrated in Tab. I, RP-SLAM attains an average frame rate of 17.3 FPS in monocular mode on the Replica dataset, which is considerably superior to that of MonoGS, which exhibits a lower frame rate due to the overhead of coupled optimization. Similarly, in RGB-D mode (Tab. II), RP-SLAM achieves an average frame rate of 18.3 FPS, which outperforms MonoGS4, RTG-SLAM5, and SplaTAM3. The compact model size of RP-SLAM is attributed to EIM, which represents the scene in an efficient manner by reducing redundancy without compromising the rendering quality. EIM employs quadtree-based adaptive sampling oriented to the image gradient, which ensures that regions with a high level of detail are adequately sampled while avoiding unnecessary repetitive sampling in regions with a more even texture. Furthermore, the implementation of KNN-besed filtering facilitates the refinement of the Gaussian primitives set through the elimination of redundancy, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the map representation. As illustrated in Tab. I, the average model size of RP-SLAM in monocular mode on the Replica dataset is 11.3 Mb, which is notably smaller than that of Photo-SLAM6 (23.14 Mb) and that of CaRtGS (15.3 Mb). In RGB-D mode (Tab. II), the average model size of RP-SLAM is 10.0 Mb, which is significantly smaller than that of all baseline methods. On the TUM dataset (Tab. III), RP-SLAM maintains a compact model size of 6.3 Mb in monocular mode and 3.8 Mb in RGB-D mode, which outperforms all methods except MonoGS4. Similarly, the smallest model size was obtained on the ScanNet++ dataset (Tab. IV). The combined impact of the decoupled sampling method and EIM is further emphasized when considering the balance between computational efficiency and rendering quality. Despite achieving higher frame rates and smaller model sizes, RP-SLAM does not compromise the quality of the reconstructed scene. This balance is critical for applications that require both real-time and high-fidelity reconstruction. In conclusion, the computational and storage efficiency of RP-SLAM is markedly enhanced by the decoupled method for camera pose estimation and scene representation optimization, in addition to EIM. Collectively, these approaches empower RP-SLAM to attain real-time operation at high frame rates while maintaining a compact model size, and furthermore, provide realistic and consistent scene reconstruction.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: The computational and storage efficiency of RP-SLAM is demonstrated through a comprehensive evaluation of the Replica[ref]22, TUM, and ScanNet++[ref]23 datasets, as detailed in Tab. I to IV.
