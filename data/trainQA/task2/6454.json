Copyright may be transferred without notice, after which this version may no longer be accessible.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis section provides preliminary concepts which will be used in the following sections. Throughout this article, s𝑠s refers to an indexed family of distinct symbolic variables of type unit interval, that is, ∀i∈ℕfor-all𝑖ℕ\\forall i\\in\\mathbb{N}, the symbol sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i} (uniquely identified by the integer i𝑖i) refers to a scalar real variable the value of which is only known to belong to the unit interval 𝒟​(si)=[−1,+1]⊂ℝ𝒟subscript𝑠𝑖11ℝ\\mathcal{D}(s_{i})=[-1,+1]\\subset\\mathbb{R}. Also, 𝒟​(s)=[−1,+1]c​a​r​d​(s)𝒟𝑠superscript11𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑑𝑠\\mathcal{D}(s)=[-1,+1]^{card(s)}. In other words, the a priori unknown value ι​si𝜄subscript𝑠𝑖\\iota s_{i} taken by the symbolic variable sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i} satisfies ι​si∈𝒟​(si)𝜄subscript𝑠𝑖𝒟subscript𝑠𝑖\\iota s_{i}\\in\\mathcal{D}(s_{i}). The generic notation ι𝜄\\iota which reads as ”interpretation/valuation of” helps disambiguate between symbols (syntax) and values (semantics) . Note that, in general, several interpretations may coexist. Set-valued interpretations take sets as values. In the following, consistently with the definition domain 𝒟​(si)𝒟subscript𝑠𝑖\\mathcal{D}(s_{i}) related to sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i}, the set-valued interpretation of each symbolic variable sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i} will be si|ι=[−1,+1]{s_{i}}_{|\\iota}=[-1,+1]. In addition, the integer-valued vector I𝐼I is used to uniquely identify a set of symbols, for example, vector I=[ref]1 [ref]5 𝐼153I=[1,\\,5,\\,3] identifies the symbols s1subscript𝑠1s_{1}, s5subscript𝑠5s_{5} and s3subscript𝑠3s_{3}. For brevity of notation, sIsubscript𝑠𝐼s_{I} denotes the column vector [si]i∈Isubscriptdelimited-[]subscript𝑠𝑖𝑖𝐼[s_{i}]_{i\\in I}. A symbolic zonotope 𝒳|s\\mathcal{X}_{|s} is an affine symbolic function that can be written in the form c+R​sI𝑐𝑅subscript𝑠𝐼c+Rs_{I} where vector c𝑐c and matrix R𝑅R do not depend on the symbolic variables in sIsubscript𝑠𝐼s_{I}. Notation: 𝒳|s=⟨c,R,I⟩|s=c+R​sI\\mathcal{X}_{|s}=\\langle c,R,I\\rangle_{|s}=c+Rs_{I}. The e-zonotope 𝒳|ι\\mathcal{X}_{|\\iota} related to the s-zonotope 𝒳|s=⟨c,R,I⟩|s=c+R​sI\\mathcal{X}_{|s}=\\langle c,R,I\\rangle_{|s}=c+Rs_{I} is the set-valued interpretation of 𝒳|s\\mathcal{X}_{|s} as 𝒳|ι=⟨c,R,I⟩|ι={c+R​σ|σ∈𝒟​(sI)}\\mathcal{X}_{|\\iota}=\\langle c,R,I\\rangle_{|\\iota}=\\{c+R\\sigma|\\sigma\\in\\mathcal{D}(s_{I})\\}. A basic example is : given i∈ℕ𝑖ℕi\\in\\mathbb{N}, ⟨0,1,i⟩|s=si\\langle 0,1,i\\rangle_{|s}=s_{i} (symbolic expression corresponding to the i𝑖i-th symbol in s𝑠s) and ⟨0,1,i⟩|ι=𝒟​(si)=[−1,+1]\\langle 0,1,i\\rangle_{|\\iota}=\\mathcal{D}(s_{i})=[-1,+1] (set-valued interpretation of sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i}). More generally, s-zonotopes and their interpretation as e-zonotopes make it possible to explicitly perform operations either at symbolic/syntactic level (.|s._{|s}) or at semantic level (.|ι._{|\\iota}). In this work, all symbols being of type unit interval, c𝑐c being a real vector and R𝑅R a real matrix, 𝒳|ι\\mathcal{X}_{|\\iota} is a classical zonotope ⟨c,R⟩𝑐𝑅\\langle c,R\\rangle with center c𝑐c and generator matrix R𝑅R (for extensions to other symbol types, see ). Note that ⟨0,1,i⟩|s−⟨0,1,j⟩|s=si−sj=0\\langle 0,1,i\\rangle_{|s}-\\langle 0,1,j\\rangle_{|s}=s_{i}-s_{j}=0 for i=j𝑖𝑗i=j, whereas ⟨0,1,i⟩|ι−⟨0,1,j⟩|ι=[−2,+2]\\langle 0,1,i\\rangle_{|\\iota}-\\langle 0,1,j\\rangle_{|\\iota}=[-2,+2] for all (i,j)𝑖𝑗(i,j), that is, even for i=j𝑖𝑗i=j. Operating at the symbolic/syntactic level thus permits more accurate set evaluations by preserving trace of symbolic dependencies. This is a key point to prevent from pessimistic outer approximations induced by the so-called dependency problem  affecting natural interval arithmetic and other classical set-based operations only considering the semantic level. From a computational point of view, an s-zonotope is defined by storing the triplet (c,R,I)𝑐𝑅𝐼(c,R,I). Due to their affine structure, a key aspect is to efficiently trace the identifier i∈I𝑖𝐼i\\in I of the symbol that multiplies each column of the matrix R𝑅R. To that end, Matrices with Labeled Columns (MLCs), constitute a data structure featuring columnwise sparsity: It is defined by the pair (R,I)𝑅𝐼(R,I) that allows for efficiently recasting standard operations involving s-zonotopes as set-operations on the identifiers vector (I𝐼I) and column-wise operations in the projection matrices (R𝑅R). For how to translate operations such as sum or linear image onto a computational platform using MLCs the interested reader can refer to 0. Due to their relevance in further developments, the following operations involving s-zonotopes are briefly recalled. Any two s-zonotopes 𝒳|s=⟨cx,R,I⟩|s\\mathcal{X}_{|s}=\\langle c_{x},R,I\\rangle_{|s} and 𝒴|s=⟨cy,G,J⟩|s\\mathcal{Y}_{|s}=\\langle c_{y},G,J\\rangle_{|s}, can be rewritten using a common set of symbols sKsubscript𝑠𝐾s_{K} as 𝒳|s=⟨cx,R~,K⟩|s\\mathcal{X}_{|s}=\\langle c_{x},\\tilde{R},K\\rangle_{|s} and 𝒴|s=⟨cy,G~,K⟩|s\\mathcal{Y}_{|s}=\\langle c_{y},\\tilde{G},K\\rangle_{|s}, with Matrices (R1,G1)subscript𝑅1subscript𝐺1(R_{1},G_{1}) in 1 may be empty matrices if I∩J𝐼𝐽I\\cap J is empty (similarly for R2subscript𝑅2R_{2} and I∖J𝐼𝐽I\\setminus J or G2subscript𝐺2G_{2} and J∖I𝐽𝐼J\\setminus I). Given two s-zonotopes 𝒳|s\\mathcal{X}_{|s} and 𝒴|s\\mathcal{Y}_{|s} with a common set of symbols sKsubscript𝑠𝐾s_{K} as in 1, then their sum and vertical concatenation are the s-zonotopes The s-zonotope 𝒴|s\\mathcal{Y}_{|s} is said to include the s-zonotope 𝒳|s\\mathcal{X}_{|s}, if the set-valued interpretation of 𝒴|s\\mathcal{Y}_{|s} includes the set-valued interpretation of 𝒳|s\\mathcal{X}_{|s}. In other words, the expression 𝒳|s⊂𝒴|s\\mathcal{X}_{|s}\\subset\\mathcal{Y}_{|s} interprets as 𝒳|ι⊂𝒴|ι\\mathcal{X}_{|\\iota}\\subset\\mathcal{Y}_{|\\iota}. 4 paves the way for rewriting rules (at symbolic level) that may be either inclusion preserving or inclusion neutral or none of both at set-based evaluation (semantic) level. A more formal treatment of this topic can be found in the definition 27 (rewriting rules and inclusion) in ,\nwhere a definition of inclusion functions is also given in definition 2. The reduction operator ↓qsubscript↓𝑞\\downarrow_{q} transforms an s-zonotope 𝒳|s=⟨c,R,I⟩|s\\mathcal{X}_{|s}=\\langle c,R,I\\rangle_{|s} into a new s-zonotope 𝒳~|s=↓q𝒳|s=⟨c,G,J⟩|s\\tilde{\\mathcal{X}}_{|s}=\\downarrow_{q}\\mathcal{X}_{|s}=\\langle c,G,J\\rangle_{|s}, such that 𝒳~|s\\tilde{\\mathcal{X}}_{|s} includes 𝒳|s\\mathcal{X}_{|s} while depending on at most q𝑞q symbols, i.e. c​a​r​d​(J)≤q𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑑𝐽𝑞card(J)\\leq q. Reduction is thus an inclusion preserving transform. In 5, I∩J≠∅𝐼𝐽I\\cap J\\neq\\emptyset is not mandatory but often useful to prevent from a further propagation of conservative approximations, while controlling the complexity of 𝒳~|s\\tilde{\\mathcal{X}}_{|s} through the maximum number q𝑞q of its symbols/generators. In this context, preserving the more significant symbols/dependencies is often beneficial: as in 0,\nif p>q𝑝𝑞p>q a common practice is to replace the p−q+1𝑝𝑞1p-q+1 less important symbols by a new independent one while guaranteeing the inclusion 𝒳|s⊆𝒳~|s\\mathcal{X}_{|s}\\subseteq\\tilde{\\mathcal{X}}_{|s}. Besides, note that new symbols introduced to characterize independent behaviors must be uniquely identified. Wherever needed, the generation of a vector of n𝑛n new unique symbols identifiers is denoted as !(n)!(n). The generation of a pre-specified number of identifiers can be attained by implementing, for example, the Unique Symbols Provider (USP) service introduced in 0.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: symbolic variable sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i} will be si|ι=[−1,+1]{s_{i}}_{|\\iota}=[-1,+1]. In addition, the integer-valued vector I𝐼I is used to uniquely identify a set of symbols, for example, vector I=[ref]1 [ref]5 𝐼153I=[1,\\,5,\\,3] identifies the symbols s1subscript𝑠1s_{1}, s5subscript𝑠5s_{5} and s3subscript𝑠3s_{3}. For brevity of notation, sIsubscript𝑠𝐼s_{I} denotes the column vector\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
