      "content": "Paper Title: Uncertainty-Aware Signal Temporal Logic Inference\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, inferring temporal properties of a system by its temporally evolved trajectories have been in the spotlight [ref]27. Kong et. al developed an algorithm for STL inference from trajectories that show the desired behavior and those having the undesired behavior . Kyriakis et. al. proposed stochastic temporal logic (StTL) inference algorithm for characterizing time-varying behaviors of a dynamical stochastic system. Neider et. al  proposed a framework for learning temporal properties using LTL. Several other frameworks for inferring temporal properties such as , [ref]31, , , , etc have been proposed. In addition, various quantitative semantics have been introduced for temporal logics such as robust semantics. Danze et. al. [ref]33 introduced robust semantics for STL formulas, and Lindemann et. al.  introduced predicate robustness. Fainekos et. al.  defined robust semantics for metric temporal logic (MTL). Kyriakis et. al. incorporated robust semantics to maximize the efficiency of his StTL inference framework . On the other hand, using decision trees in STL inference have been noteworthy [ref]31. For example, Brunello et. al.  introduced Interval Temporal Logic Decision Trees, where the data is delivered to the decision tree in form of intervals.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: Recently, inferring temporal properties of a system by its temporally evolved trajectories have been in the spotlight [ref]27.
