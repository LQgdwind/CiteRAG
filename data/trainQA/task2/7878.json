      "content": "Paper Title: Analyzing Multifiltering Functions Using Multiparameter Discrete Morse Theory\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTopological data analysis (TDA) is a fast-growing branch of mathematics which proposes a panoply of tools to better understand and visualize data   . One of the most popular method in TDA is persistent homology, which aims to detect the most significant topological features of a space filtered in accordance with some parameter or (real) function  . In many contexts, notably when the given space is generated from a noisy sample of points, it is more convenient to consider multiple parameters, such as the scale and density of the data . This motivated Carlsson and Zomorodian  to extend the concept to multiparameter persistent homology. Multipersistence has already proven itself to be useful in applications, for instance in the analysis of biomedical data  . However, it is a challenge to compute multipersistent homology efficiently . Different ways to lessen the computational burden while preserving the topological information extracted have been proposed in the literature  [ref]20 0   . One strategy we take a particular interest in is the use of discrete Morse theory, introduced by Forman . Akin to its smooth counterpart 4 , it provides a way to compute the homology of a whole space using only the critical simplices of a (discrete) Morse function defined on it and its (discrete) gradient field. While there exists other notable discrete or piecewise linear (PL) Morse theories    , Forman’s version has the advantage of being highly versatile and adapts well to the present context. Indeed, over the years, it led to many applications in TDA     as well as the development of a novel combinatorial approach to dynamics    . More specifically, discrete Morse theory can be used in order to ease the computation of the persistent homology associated to a filtration . Essentially, this involves reducing the size of the input data by keeping only the elements which are critical, that is, necessary for computations. In particular, when considering an injective filtering function defined on either the vertices of a simplicial complex  or a cubical grid representing a digital image , it can be used to generate a discrete gradient field whose critical points represent the homological changes in the corresponding filtration. These ideas are pushed a step further to the multiparameter framework by Allili et al. . In their paper, the authors prove that a discrete gradient field, also called a Morse matching, can be used to reduce a Lefschetz complex, e.g. a simplicial or cubical complex, while preserving multipersistent homology. Moreover, they present the algorithm Matching that takes as input a simplicial complex and a vector function defined on its vertices and outputs a Morse matching compatible with the multifiltration induced by the given multifiltering function. By restraining the considered input functions to component-wise injective vertex maps, the algorithm Matching is improved in  and a more efficient version, ComputeDiscreteGradient, is proposed thereafter by Scaramuccia et al. . Experiments in  show that critical simplices output by these algorithms tend to form clusters which resemble smooth Pareto sets, as defined by Smale , Wan , who extended the classical Morse theory to vector-valued functions. In the last few years, many links have been made between the Pareto sets of smooth ℝ2superscriptℝ2{\\mathbb{R}}^{2}-valued filtering functions and the homological changes in their corresponding filtration   . In discrete settings however, to our knowledge, only a few contributions on related subjects may be found in the literature. In , Jacobi sets of vector-valued PL mappings are used to characterize Reeb spaces, whereas in 7, Pareto sets are defined for such maps and used to analyze and visualize data. This motivates the need to extend Morse-Forman theory to vector-valued functions. In , fundamental definitions needed to do so are proposed, and the elaboration of multiparameter discrete Morse (mdm) theory is completed by Brouillette et al. . In this paper, many central results of Forman are generalized to the vectorial setting and the notion of critical components is introduced. Although it gives a solid theoretical framework, the work in  does not address specifically how mdm functions could be used in practice. Therefore, the objective of the present paper is to pick up where Brouillette et al.  left off by bridging theory and practice. We do so in two ways. First, we propose an algorithm, GenerateMDM, that takes as input any multifiltering function f:K→ℝk:𝑓→𝐾superscriptℝ𝑘f:K\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}}^{k} defined on a simplicial complex K𝐾K and generates a mdm function which approximates f𝑓f and whose gradient field is compatible with the multifiltration induced by f𝑓f, as stated in Theorem 5.7. Second, we define the concept of Pareto set for a discrete multifiltering function f𝑓f and see experimentally how its connected components compare to the critical components of the mdm function output by GenerateMDM when given f𝑓f as input. The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we recall some known concepts, mainly about multipersistent homology. In Section 3, a brief overview of mdm theory is presented. Then, our main algorithm GenerateMDM and subroutines are described in Section 4. We analyze its complexity and compare it with previous similar algorithms Matching and ComputeDiscreteGradient. Next, we prove in Section 5 that GenerateMDM outputs the desired result. Thereafter, the notion of discrete Pareto set is introduced in Section 6. Finally, in Section 7, we see how GenerateMDM performs in practice and we experiment with the concept of discrete Pareto set and that of critical components of a mdm function on triangular meshes.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: to compute multipersistent homology efficiently .
