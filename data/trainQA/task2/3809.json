Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: SiamHAN: IPv6 Address Correlation Attacks on TLS Encrypted Traffic via Siamese Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe prior work mainly performs user correlation under TLS traffic from the dimensions including user profiling  , TLS fingerprinting [ref]2, and flow sequences . Among them, we implement four representative methods to compare with SiamHAN: (1) User IP Profiling . User IP Profiling is building user profiles through all the destination IPs of the client address and using a Bayesian classifier  to identify known users in a closed-world dataset. To apply address correlation to identify unknown users in an open-world scenario, we use pairwise profiles as input to the classifier to evaluate the performance of correlation attacks. (2) User SNI Profiling . User SNI Profiling is to use the SNIs in all the TLS ClientHello messages from the client as a user interest identification. Similar to Banse et al. , we also exploit a Bayesian classifier to input pairwise SNI profiles to correlate user activities. (3) Client Fingerprinting [ref]2. Client Fingerprinting is to extract the specific fields of the TLS ClientHello message as the user’s client fingerprints and leverages Random Forest  to learn the correlation of any two paired fingerprints. (4) Deepcorr . Deepcorr uses the flow sequence characteristics to achieve correlation tasks in multiple scenarios   . To keep the same setup with Deepcorr, we also extract a flow sequence of 300 packets per client address to indicate the performance of Deepcorr.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: The prior work mainly performs user correlation under TLS traffic from the dimensions including user profiling  , TLS fingerprinting [ref]2, and flow sequences .
