All experiments were run on a computer with a Ubuntu 22.04 OS, a 12th Gen Intel(R) CoreTM i9-12900H CPU with 64 GB of RAM, and with a NVIDIA RTX A100 GPU with 4GB of VRAM. We explore the following hyper-parameters, Number of samples n𝑛n is searched among {50,100,200}×nc50100200subscript𝑛𝑐\\{50,100,200\\}\\times n_{c}. Number of atoms K𝐾K is searched among {3,4,⋯,8}34⋯8\\{3,4,\\cdots,8\\}. Batch size nbsubscript𝑛𝑏n_{b} is searched among {5,10,20}×nc51020subscript𝑛𝑐\\{5,10,20\\}\\times n_{c}. We further sample balanced batches from the sources. The complexity of our model is controlled through n𝑛n and K𝐾K. We provide further analysis on the robustness w.r.t. hyper-parameter choice, as well as the full set of chosen hyper-parameters in our appendix. For other algorithms from the State-of-the-Art (SOTA), we use the best hyper-parameter settings reported by their respective authors. Caltech-Office 10 is a benchmark consisting on the intersection of the Caltech 256 dataset of  and the Office 31 dataset of . It has 4 domains: Amazon (A), dSLR (D), Webcam (W) and Caltech (C). In this benchmark we compare DaDiL with other shallow DA algorithms, such as: (i) Subspace Alignment (SA) of ; (ii) Transfer Component Analysis (TCA) of ; (iii) Optimal Transport Domain Adaptation (OTDA) of [ref]1; (iv) Wasserstein Barycenter Transport (WBT) of  ; (v) Weighted JDOT (WJDOT) of . (i) and (ii) are standard algorithms in DA, (iii) is the single-source OT baseline, and (iv, v) are the SOTA for shallow MSDA. The baseline corresponds to training a single-layer Perceptron with the concatenation of source domain data. Our results is presented in table 2. DaDiL improve over previous OT-based MSDA baselines, i.e. WJDOT and WBT, being especially better on the Webcam and Caltech domains. Overall, we improve previous SOTA by 3.15 in terms of average DA performance. Ablation Study. We investigate the effectiveness of DiL in comparison with other barycenter-based approaches. As follows, we compare the performance on the Caltech-Office 10 benchmark of 4 methods: (i) Wasserstein Barycenter (WB); (ii) WBT; (iii) Wasserstein Barycentric Coordinates Regression (WBR)-R and WBR-E, which can be understood as the adaptation of the framework of  for point clouds. The R and E methods are analogous to DaDiL when the atoms are initialized and fixed as the source domains. We provide further details of this adaptation in our appendix. We report our findings in table 3. Overall, WB and WBR have sub-optimal performance. On the one hand, this implies that Q^T∉ℳ​(𝒬S)subscript^𝑄𝑇ℳsubscript𝒬𝑆\\hat{Q}_{T}\\not\\in\\mathcal{M}(\\mathcal{Q}_{S}). On the other hand, this implies that DiL is key for MSDA. Indeed, since P^k∈𝒫subscript^𝑃𝑘𝒫\\hat{P}_{k}\\in\\mathcal{P} are free, DaDiL learns 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} s.t. Q^T∈ℳ​(𝒫)subscript^𝑄𝑇ℳ𝒫\\hat{Q}_{T}\\in\\mathcal{M}(\\mathcal{P}). WBT reg compensates this fact by transporting the B^^𝐵\\hat{B} towards Q^Tsubscript^𝑄𝑇\\hat{Q}_{T}, thus minimizing the residual shift W2​(B^,P^T)subscript𝑊2^𝐵subscript^𝑃𝑇W_{2}(\\hat{B},\\hat{P}_{T}). Refurbished Office 31. In this experiment, we use the Office 31 benchmark of , with the improvements proposed by 5. This benchmark has 3 domains: Amazon (A), dSLR (D) and Webcam (W). Our goal is to establish a comparison with deep DA methods. As follows, we consider: (i) Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) of [ref]12, (ii) Wasserstein Distance Guided Representation Learning (WDGRL) of , (iii) Deep-JDOT of , (iv) Moment Matching for MSDA (M3SDA) of , (v) WJDOT and (vi) WBT. While (i) - (iii) are single source baselines, (iv) is a standard method for MSDA. We use a ResNet-50 6 as backbone. A summary of our results is shown in table 4. Overall, DaDiL-R and E are especially better than previous algorithms in the Amazon domain. As a consequence, in terms of average domain performance, DaDiL-R and E improve over the second-best method (WBTreg) by a margin of 2.29% and 1.37% respectively. CWRU. In this benchmark, we explore DaDiL for cross-domain fault diagnosis. The goal is to classify which type of fault has occurred, based on sensor readings. Hence, we extract 204820482048 Fourier coefficients from a sub-set of 409640964096 time-steps extracted from the raw signals (see 7, or our appendix for more details). As feature extractor, we use a 3-layer fully connected encoder. We compare 3 single, and 5 multi-source DA algorithms to DaDiL, namely, DANN, OTDA, TCA, M3SDA, LTC-MSDA of 8, JCPOT of , WBT reg and WJDOT. We present a summary of our results in table 5. Overall, WBT reg and DaDiL are the best performing methods, demonstrating the power of Wasserstein barycenters for DA. Our method outperforms WBT reg by 7.71%, in terms of average domain performance. Furthermore, our methods surpass other deep learning baselines, such as M3SDA  and LTC-MSDA 8, by a margin of 19.90%.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: benchmark we compare DaDiL with other shallow DA algorithms, such as: (i) Subspace Alignment (SA) of ; (ii) Transfer Component Analysis (TCA) of ; (iii) Optimal Transport Domain Adaptation (OTDA) of [ref]1; (iv) Wasserstein Barycenter Transport (WBT) of  ; (v) Weighted JDOT (WJDOT) of . (i) and (ii) are standard algorithms in DA, (iii) is the single-source OT baseline, and (iv, v) are the SOTA\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
