      "content": "Paper Title: Sparsely Changing Latent States for Prediction and Planning in Partially Observable Domains\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor our reinforcement learning experiments in the Mini-Gridworld [ref]48, we used an actor-critic architecture as previously done by Chevalier-Boisvert et al. .777We used an implementation by one of the authors available at https://github.com/lcswillems/rl-starter-files. The code is licensed under MIT license.\nThe architecture is a modified version of our general architecture (Fig. 1(d)), shown in Fig. 9.\nThe image-like input is preprocessed by a three-layered convolutional neural network fpresubscript𝑓pref_{\\text{pre}} with 2×2222\\times 2 convolution kernels and with max-pooling after the first layer.\nThe 64-dimensional image embdeding is processed by an LSTM with 64-dimensional latent state.\nThe LSTM output is processed by two separate MLPs, akin to using two fpostsubscript𝑓postf_{\\text{post}} in Fig. 1(d), that take the role of the actor and the critic.\nThe actor MLP factorsubscript𝑓actorf_{\\text{actor}} outputs the policy 𝝅tsubscript𝝅𝑡\\bm{\\pi}_{t}, which determines the next action 𝒂tsubscript𝒂𝑡\\bm{a}_{t}.\nThe critic MLP fcriticsubscript𝑓criticf_{\\text{critic}} outputs a value estimate 𝒗tsubscript𝒗𝑡\\bm{v}_{t}.\nBoth MLPs use two layers with 64 neurons on the intermediate layer.\nIn our experiments with GateL0RD, we only replace the LSTM cell and leave fpresubscript𝑓pref_{\\text{pre}}, factorsubscript𝑓actorf_{\\text{actor}}, and fcriticsubscript𝑓criticf_{\\text{critic}} unmodified. As done by Chevalier-Boisvert et al. , we train the system using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)  with parallel data processing.\nWe performed 4 epochs of PPO with a batch size of 256.\nWe took the PPO hyperparameters from , setting γ=0.99𝛾0.99\\gamma=0.99 and the generalized advantage estimation to 0.990.990.99. We train the system using Adam  with β1=0.9subscript𝛽10.9\\beta_{1}=0.9, β2=0.999subscript𝛽20.999\\beta_{2}=0.999, and ϵ=0.0001italic-ϵ0.0001\\epsilon=0.0001.\nTo determine the learning rate α𝛼\\alpha we ran a grid search on the vanilla system (LSTM) with α∈{0.005,0.001,0.0005,0.0001}𝛼0.0050.0010.00050.0001\\alpha\\in\\{0.005,0.001,0.0005,0.0001\\} for two random seeds and compared the mean rewards after training.\nIn five of the six environments α=0.001𝛼0.001\\alpha=0.001 achieved the best results.\nThus, for consistency we ran the MiniGrid experiments with a learning rate of α=0.001𝛼0.001\\alpha=0.001.\nFor the one environment (KeyCorridorS3R2) in which a smaller learning rate (α=0.0005𝛼0.0005\\alpha=0.0005) produced better results, we additionally evaluated the system with the optimized learning rate and report the results in Suppl. D.9.\nAs before, we apply gradient norm clipping  with a clipping threshold of 0.10.10.1.\nThe loss was backpropagated for 32 time steps. When using GateL0RD, we simply replaced the LSTM cell and left all hyperparameters unmodified.\nThe PPO loss  was used as ℒtasksubscriptℒtask\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{task}} in Eq. 2 and we set λ=0.01𝜆0.01\\lambda=0.01 in all experiments.\nAll reinforcement learning experiments were run with 10 random seeds per configuration.\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: For our reinforcement learning experiments in the Mini-Gridworld [ref]48, we used an actor-critic architecture as previously done by Chevalier-Boisvert et al. .777We used an implementation by one of the authors available at\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
