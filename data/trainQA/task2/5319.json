      "content": "Paper Title: Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Prognostics and Health Management of Lithium-Ion Batteries\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDynamic models for Li-ion-batteries degradation can be established\nbased on the classic Pseudo-Two-dimensional (P2D) model, which possesses\nhigh accuracy but is severely restricted due to the subsequent complexity\nand computation burden . The Single-Particle (SP) model\nis then proposed to simplify the P2D model, which assumes that both\nelectrodes consist of multiple uniform-sized spherical particles .\nBased on the SP model, a widely-accepted degradation mechanism was\nproposed. Since electrolytes can be reduced in the presence of lithiated\ncarbon, SEI formation is caused by the lithium carbonate. The newly\nexposed surface of the particles is then covered by SEI during the\ncycling. Under this mechanism, the degradation rate considering both\nDiffusion Induced Stresses (DIS), crack growth, and SEI thickness\ngrowth was derived in  . There are many parameters\nto estimate and verify in this dynamic model proposed fully based\non prior electrochemical knowledge, which restricts its generalizability. Another category of degradation models focuses more on the utilization\nof available degradation data with monitoring time or cycles, and\nthen the degradation trends are modeled by analytical functions under\nthe given statistical assumptions . These models commonly\noversimplify the physics that the degradation trends of Li-ion batteries\nshould follow. Semi-physics and semi-empirical dynamic models are\nproposed to take both factors into account . For instance,\nan exponential-law model can be derived based on battery Coulombic\nefficiency [ref]22. This exponential model can also be integrated\nfrom an empirically given differential form and then its parameters\nare estimated based on temperature stress, State of Charge (SoC) stress,\ntime stress, and Depth of Discharge (DoD) stress . In view of the fact that there is an upper bound for the capacity\nloss, the Verhulst model has been proposed to quantify the rate of\ncapacity loss . As can be seen, there usually exists\nmore or less available information from physics for SoH estimation,\nwhile this is not always true for RUL prognostics. To fill this gap,\ndiscovery for dynamic models with a preset fixed form or completely\narbitrary form has been explored by developing PDE-Net [ref]23 [ref]24\nand DeepHPM   respectively. These models discover\nPDEs by training specialized layers. In PDE-Net, convolution kernels\nare trained to approximate the differential operators, and other network\nparameters are trained to approximate finite-order linear PDEs. Discrete-time\nmodels can be accordingly constructed. In DeepHPM, the most significant\ndifference is that it uses the Automatic Differentiator (AutoDiff)\nto compute the analytical differentiation. As a result, DeepHPM can\nhandle both discrete and continuous, linear and nonlinear models.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: follow. Semi-physics and semi-empirical dynamic models are\nproposed to take both factors into account . For instance,\nan exponential-law model can be derived based on battery Coulombic\nefficiency [ref]22.
