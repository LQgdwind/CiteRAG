Studies for link prediction on n-ary relational data directly are relatively much scarcer and newer. The m-TransH [ref]2 method generalizes TransH  on binary relational data to n-ary relational data. It presents a mathematical definition of n-ary relations as the mappings from sequences of roles to their role-values. Each n-ary relational fact is a specific mapping of the corresponding relation. Then, the score function of an n-ary relational fact is defined by the weighted sum of the projection results from its role-values to its relation hyperplane, where the weights are the real numbers projected from its roles. Based on m-TransH, RAE  introduces the relatedness of role-values, i.e., the likelihood that two role-values co-participate in a common n-ary relational fact, and adds this relatedness loss with a weight hyper-parameter to the embedding loss of m-TransH. Although with the additional modeling of the relatedness of role-values, RAE outperforms m-TransH, it does not look into the roles when computing the relatedness. Since roles are also a fundamental part of n-ary relational facts, taking them into consideration may make a difference as illustrated afore. To better capture the role that the entity plays in a given relation, HypE [ref]7 further convolves each entity appearing at the specific position in a given tuple with the set of position-specific filters. GETD  is the first tensor based method for n-ary relational link prediction. However, GETD only focuses on handling n-ary relational facts of the same arities. HINGE  and NeuInfer  consider principal and subordinate structure information and represent each n-ary relational fact as a primary triple coupled with a set of its auxiliary descriptive r:v pair(s). Actually, no all n-ary relational facts have a primary triple. In a word, all these methods do not consider any type constraint.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: and usually tricky to deal with, most of existing studies convert them into triples.
