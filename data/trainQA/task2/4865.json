      "content": "Paper Title: Inductive Logical Query Answering in Knowledge Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nKnowledge Graph Completion.\nKnowledge graph completion, a.k.a. simple link prediction, has been widely studied in the transductive paradigm [ref]6 3 [ref]27 , i.e., when training and inference are performed on the same graph with a fixed set of entities. Generally, these methods learn a shallow embedding vector for each entity.\nWe refer the audience to respective surveys  7 covering dozens of transductive embedding methods.\nThe emergence of message passing 4 and graph neural networks (GNNs) has led to more advanced, inductive representation learning approaches that model entity or triplet representations as a function of the graph structure in its neighborhood.\nGraIL  learns triplet representations based on the subgraph structure surrounding the two entities. NeuralLP , DRUM  and NBFNet  learn the pairwise entity representations based on the set of relation paths between two entities. NodePiece 3 learns entity representations from a fixed-size vocabulary of tokens that can be anchor nodes in a graph or relation types. Complex Query Answering.\nIn the complex (multi-hop) query answering setup with logical operators, existing models employ different approaches, e.g., geometric 5  , probabilistic  , neural-symbolic   , neural  , and GNN 1 .\nStill, all the approaches are created and evaluated exclusively in the transductive mode where the set of entities does not change at inference time.\nTo the best of our knowledge, there is no related work in inductive logical query answering when the inference graph contains new entities.\nWith our work, we aim to bridge this gap and extend inductive representation learning algorithms to logical query answering.\nIn particular, we focus on the inductive setup where an inference graph is a superset of a training graph222The set of relation types is fixed. such that 1) inference queries require reasoning over both seen and new entities; 2) original training queries might have more correct answers at inference time with the addition of new entities.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: Knowledge Graph Completion.\nKnowledge graph completion, a.k.a. simple link prediction, has been widely studied in the transductive paradigm [ref]6 3 [ref]27 , i.e., when training and inference are performed on the same graph with a fixed set of entities. Generally, these methods learn a shallow embedding vector for each entity.\nWe refer\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
