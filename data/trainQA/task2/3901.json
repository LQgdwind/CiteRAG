      "content": "Paper Title: Concise tensors of minimal border rank\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis paper is motivated by algebraic complexity theory and the study of secant varieties\nin algebraic geometry. It takes first steps towards overcoming complexity lower bound barriers\nfirst identified in\n . It also provides new “minimal cost” tensors\nfor Strassen’s laser method to upper bound the exponent of matrix multiplication that are not known to be subject to the\nbarriers identified in \nand later refined in numerous works, in particular  which\nshows there are barriers for minimal border rank binding tensors (defined below), as our new tensors are not binding.

In geometric\nlanguage, the border rank is smallest r𝑟r such that T𝑇T\nbelongs to the r𝑟r-th secant variety of the Segre variety,\nσr​(S​e​g​(ℙm−1×ℙm−1×ℙm−1))⊆ℙ​(ℂm​⊗​ℂm​⊗​ℂm)subscript𝜎𝑟𝑆𝑒𝑔superscriptℙ𝑚1superscriptℙ𝑚1superscriptℙ𝑚1ℙsuperscriptℂ𝑚tensor-productsuperscriptℂ𝑚tensor-productsuperscriptℂ𝑚\\sigma_{r}(Seg(\\mathbb{P}^{m-1}\\times\\mathbb{P}^{m-1}\\times\\mathbb{P}^{m-1}))\\subseteq\\mathbb{P}(\\mathbb{C}^{m}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{m}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{m}). Informally, a tensor T𝑇T is concise if it cannot be expressed as a tensor in a smaller ambient space. (See §1.1 for the precise definition.)\nA concise tensor T∈ℂm​⊗​ℂm​⊗​ℂm𝑇superscriptℂ𝑚tensor-productsuperscriptℂ𝑚tensor-productsuperscriptℂ𝑚T\\in\\mathbb{C}^{m}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{m}{\\mathord{\\otimes}}\\mathbb{C}^{m} must have border rank at least m𝑚m, and if the border rank\nequals m𝑚m, one says that T𝑇T has minimal border rank. As stated in , tensors of minimal border rank are important for algebraic\ncomplexity theory as they\nare “an important building stone in the construction of fast matrix multiplication\nalgorithms”. More precisely, tensors of minimal border rank have\nproduced the best upper bound on the exponent of matrix multiplication\n1  [ref]51   via Strassen’s laser method .\nTheir investigation also has a long history in classical algebraic\ngeometry as the study of secant varieties of Segre varieties. Problem 15.2 of  asks to classify concise tensors of minimal border rank.\nThis is now understood to be an extremely difficult question. The difficulty\nmanifests itself in two substantially different ways: Lack of structure. Previous to this paper, an important class of tensors (111-degenerate, see §1.1)\nhad no or few known structural properties. In other words, little is known\nabout the geometry of singular loci of secant varieties. Complicated geometry. Under various genericity hypotheses that enable one to avoid\nthe previous difficulty, the classification\nproblem reduces to hard problems in algebraic geometry: for example\nthe classification of minimal border rank binding tensors (see §1.1)\nis equivalent to classifying smoothable\nzero-dimensional schemes in affine space [35, §5.6.2], a longstanding\nand generally viewed as impossible problem in algebraic geometry, which is\nhowever solved for m≤6𝑚6m\\leq 6  . The main contributions of this paper are as follows: (i) we give equations for the set of\nconcise minimal border rank tensors for m≤5𝑚5m\\leq 5 and classify them, (ii) we\ndiscuss and consolidate the theory of minimal border rank 1∗subscript11_{*}-generic tensors, extending their characterization\nin terms of equations\nto m≤6𝑚6m\\leq 6, and (iii)\nwe introduce a new structure associated to a tensor, its 111-algebra, and investigate new invariants of\nminimal border rank tensors coming from\nthe 111-algebra. Our contributions allow one to streamline proofs of earlier results.\nThis results from the power of the 111-equations, and the\nutilization of the ADHM correspondence discussed below. While the second leads to much shorter\nproofs and enables one to avoid using the\nclassification results of  , there is a price to be paid\nas the language and machinery of modules and the Quot scheme need to be introduced.\nThis language will be essential in future work, as it provides the only proposed path to overcome\nthe lower bound barriers of  , namely deformation theory. We emphasize\nthat this paper is the first direct use of deformation theory in the study of tensors. Existing results from\ndeformation theory were previously used in . Contribution (iii) addresses the lack of structure and motivates\nmany new open questions, see §1.4.\n\nReference markers found: [51]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]51: stone in the construction of fast matrix multiplication\nalgorithms”.
