We assume that 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} is a measurable space with possibly infinite number of elements, 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} is a finite action set. ℙh(⋅|x,a)\\mathbbm{P}_{h}(\\cdot|x,a) is the transition probability kernel which denotes the probability to reach a state when action a𝑎a is taken at state x𝑥x. rh:𝒮×𝒜→[ref]0 [ref]1:subscript𝑟ℎ𝒮𝒜→01r_{h}\\mathrel{\\mathop{\\mathchar 58\\relax}}\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow[ref]0 [ref]1, and gh:𝒮×𝒜→[ref]0 [ref]1:subscript𝑔ℎ𝒮𝒜→01g_{h}\\mathrel{\\mathop{\\mathchar 58\\relax}}\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow[ref]0 [ref]1 and are assumed to be deterministic. However, we can readily extend to settings when rhsubscript𝑟ℎr_{h} and ghsubscript𝑔ℎg_{h} are random. Each episode k∈[K]𝑘delimited-[]𝐾k\\in[K] starts with the fixed state x1subscript𝑥1x_{1}. It can be readily generalized to the setting where x1subscript𝑥1x_{1} is drawn from a distribution. Then at each step h∈[H]ℎdelimited-[]𝐻h\\in[H] in episode k𝑘k, the agent observes state xhk∈𝒮superscriptsubscript𝑥ℎ𝑘𝒮x_{h}^{k}\\in\\mathcal{S}, picks an action ahk∈𝒜superscriptsubscript𝑎ℎ𝑘𝒜a_{h}^{k}\\in\\mathcal{A}, receives a reward rh​(xhk,ahk)subscript𝑟ℎsuperscriptsubscript𝑥ℎ𝑘superscriptsubscript𝑎ℎ𝑘r_{h}(x_{h}^{k},a_{h}^{k}), and a utility gh​(xhk,ahk)subscript𝑔ℎsuperscriptsubscript𝑥ℎ𝑘superscriptsubscript𝑎ℎ𝑘g_{h}(x_{h}^{k},a_{h}^{k}). The MDP evolves to xh+1ksuperscriptsubscript𝑥ℎ1𝑘x_{h+1}^{k} that is drawn from ℙh(⋅|xhk,ahk)\\mathbbm{P}_{h}(\\cdot|x_{h}^{k},a_{h}^{k}). The episode terminates at step H+1𝐻1H+1. Without loss of generality, we assume that rH+1=gH+1=0subscript𝑟𝐻1subscript𝑔𝐻10r_{H+1}=g_{H+1}=0. In this paper, we consider the challenging scenario where the agent only observes the bandit information rh​(xhk,ahk)subscript𝑟ℎsuperscriptsubscript𝑥ℎ𝑘superscriptsubscript𝑎ℎ𝑘r_{h}(x_{h}^{k},a_{h}^{k}) and gh​(xhk,ahk)subscript𝑔ℎsuperscriptsubscript𝑥ℎ𝑘superscriptsubscript𝑎ℎ𝑘g_{h}(x_{h}^{k},a_{h}^{k}) at the visited state-action pair (xhk,ahk)superscriptsubscript𝑥ℎ𝑘superscriptsubscript𝑎ℎ𝑘(x_{h}^{k},a_{h}^{k}).\nThe policy-space of an agent is Δ​(𝒜|𝒮,H)Δconditional𝒜𝒮𝐻\\Delta(\\mathcal{A}|\\mathcal{S},H); {{πh(⋅|⋅)}h=1H:πh(⋅|x)∈Δ(𝒜),∀x∈𝒮,\\{\\{\\pi_{h}(\\cdot|\\cdot)\\}_{h=1}^{H}\\mathrel{\\mathop{\\mathchar 58\\relax}}\\pi_{h}(\\cdot|x)\\in\\Delta(\\mathcal{A}),\\forall x\\in\\mathcal{S}, and h∈[H]ℎdelimited-[]𝐻h\\in[H]}. Here Δ​(𝒜)Δ𝒜\\Delta(\\mathcal{A}) is the probability simplex over the action space. For any xhk∈𝒮superscriptsubscript𝑥ℎ𝑘𝒮x_{h}^{k}\\in\\mathcal{S} , k∈[K]𝑘delimited-[]𝐾k\\in[K], and h∈[H]ℎdelimited-[]𝐻h\\in[H], πh,k​(ahk|xhk)subscript𝜋ℎ𝑘conditionalsuperscriptsubscript𝑎ℎ𝑘superscriptsubscript𝑥ℎ𝑘\\pi_{h,k}(a_{h}^{k}|x_{h}^{k}) denotes the probability that the action ahk∈𝒜superscriptsubscript𝑎ℎ𝑘𝒜a_{h}^{k}\\in\\mathcal{A} is taken at episode k𝑘k when the state is xhksuperscriptsubscript𝑥ℎ𝑘x_{h}^{k}. Let Vr,hπ​(x)subscriptsuperscript𝑉𝜋𝑟ℎ𝑥V^{\\pi}_{r,h}(x) denote the expected value of the total reward function starting from step hℎh and state x𝑥x when the agent selects action using the policy π={πh}h=1H𝜋superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝜋ℎℎ1𝐻\\pi=\\{\\pi_{h}\\}_{h=1}^{H} where 𝔼𝔼\\mathbbm{E} is taken with respect to the policy π𝜋\\pi and the transition probability kernel ℙℙ\\mathbbm{P}. Let Qr,hπ​(x,a)subscriptsuperscript𝑄𝜋𝑟ℎ𝑥𝑎Q^{\\pi}_{r,h}(x,a) denote the expected value of the total reward starting from step hℎh and the state-action pair (x,a)𝑥𝑎(x,a) and follows the policy π𝜋\\pi as Similarly, we define the value function for the utility Vg,hπ​(x)subscriptsuperscript𝑉𝜋𝑔ℎ𝑥V^{\\pi}_{g,h}(x), and the action-value function for the utility Qg,hπ​(x,a)subscriptsuperscript𝑄𝜋𝑔ℎ𝑥𝑎Q^{\\pi}_{g,h}(x,a). We denote Vj,hπ​(x)subscriptsuperscript𝑉𝜋𝑗ℎ𝑥V^{\\pi}_{j,h}(x), and Qj,hπ​(x,a)subscriptsuperscript𝑄𝜋𝑗ℎ𝑥𝑎Q^{\\pi}_{j,h}(x,a) for j=r,g𝑗𝑟𝑔j=r,g. For brevity, we denote ℙh​Vj,h+1π​(x,a)=𝔼x′∼ℙh(⋅|x,a)​Vj,h+1π​(x′)\\mathbbm{P}_{h}V^{\\pi}_{j,h+1}(x,a)=\\mathbbm{E}_{x^{\\prime}\\sim\\mathbbm{P}_{h}(\\cdot|x,a)}V^{\\pi}_{j,h+1}(x^{\\prime}) for j=r,g𝑗𝑟𝑔j=r,g. Using this notation, the Bellman’s equation associated with the policy π𝜋\\pi becomes Note that Vj,hπ(x)=⟨πh(⋅|x),Qj,hπ(x,⋅)⟩𝒜V^{\\pi}_{j,h}(x)=\\langle\\pi_{h}(\\cdot|x),Q^{\\pi}_{j,h}(x,\\cdot)\\rangle_{\\mathcal{A}}, where ⟨πh(⋅|x),Qj,hπ(x,⋅)⟩𝒜=∑a∈𝒜πh(a|x)Qj,hπ(x,a)\\langle\\pi_{h}(\\cdot|x),Q^{\\pi}_{j,h}(x,\\cdot)\\rangle_{\\mathcal{A}}=\\sum_{a\\in\\mathcal{A}}\\pi_{h}(a|x)Q^{\\pi}_{j,h}(x,a). The objective of the learning agent is to find an optimal solution of the following problem Note that even though we have only once constraint, it can be readily generalized to the scenario with multiple constraints. In order to avoid trivial solutions, we consider b∈(0,H]𝑏0𝐻b\\in(0,H]. We denote the optimal policy as π∗superscript𝜋\\pi^{*} which solves the above optimization problem. Since π∗superscript𝜋\\pi^{*} is obtained by having complete information, it is also denoted as the best policy in the hindsight. Without any constraint information a priori, an agent can not know the policies that satisfy the constraint. Instead, we allow the policy to violate the constraint and minimize the regret while minimizing the total constraint violations over the K𝐾K episodes. Such an approach is also considered in the existing literature [ref]1 [ref]7 . We now define the performance metric which we seek to minimize. Performance Metric. Let the policy employed by the agent at episode k𝑘k be πk=[π1,k,…,πh,k,…,πH,k]Tsubscript𝜋𝑘superscriptsubscript𝜋1𝑘…subscript𝜋ℎ𝑘…subscript𝜋𝐻𝑘𝑇\\pi_{k}=[\\pi_{1,k},\\ldots,\\pi_{h,k},\\ldots,\\pi_{H,k}]^{T}. The performance metric we are considering is the following where [z]+=max⁡{z,0}subscriptdelimited-[]𝑧𝑧0[z]_{+}=\\max\\{z,0\\}. The regret is defined as the difference between the total reward value by following the optimal policy π∗superscript𝜋\\pi^{*}, and the total reward value obtained by following agent’s policy πksubscript𝜋𝑘\\pi_{k} at episode k𝑘k over K𝐾K episodes. The constraint violation is defined as the difference between the threshold value K​b𝐾𝑏Kb and the total utility function attained by following the policies over all the episodes K𝐾K. Linear Function Approximation. To handle a possible large number of states, we consider the following linear MDPs. The CMDP is a linear MDP with feature map ϕ:𝒮×𝒜→ℝd:italic-ϕ𝒮𝒜→superscriptℝ𝑑\\phi\\mathrel{\\mathop{\\mathchar 58\\relax}}\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{d}, if for any h, there exists d𝑑d unknown signed measures μh={μh1,…,μhd}subscript𝜇ℎsubscriptsuperscript𝜇1ℎ…subscriptsuperscript𝜇𝑑ℎ\\mu_{h}=\\{\\mu^{1}_{h},\\ldots,\\mu^{d}_{h}\\} over 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} such that for any (x,a,x′)∈𝒮×𝒜×𝒮𝑥𝑎superscript𝑥′𝒮𝒜𝒮(x,a,x^{\\prime})\\in\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}\\times\\mathcal{S}, and there exists vectors θr,hsubscript𝜃𝑟ℎ\\theta_{r,h}, θg,h∈ℝdsubscript𝜃𝑔ℎsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\theta_{g,h}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d} such that for any (x,a)∈𝒮×𝒜𝑥𝑎𝒮𝒜(x,a)\\in\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}, Assumption 1 adapts the definition of linear MDP   to the constrained case. By the above definition, the transition model, the reward, and the utility functions are linear in terms of feature map ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi. We remark that despite being linear, ℙh(⋅|x,a)\\mathbbm{P}_{h}(\\cdot|x,a) can still have infinite degrees of freedom since μh​(⋅)subscript𝜇ℎ⋅\\mu_{h}(\\cdot) is unknown. Note that tabular MDP is part of linear MDP . Note that [ref]7  studied another related concept known as linear kernel MDP. In the linear kernel MDP, the transition probability is given by ℙh​(x′|x,a)=⟨ψ​(x′,x,a),θh⟩subscriptℙℎconditionalsuperscript𝑥′𝑥𝑎𝜓superscript𝑥′𝑥𝑎subscript𝜃ℎ\\mathbbm{P}_{h}(x^{\\prime}|x,a)=\\langle\\psi(x^{\\prime},x,a),\\theta_{h}\\rangle. In general, linear MDP and linear kernel MDPs are two different classes of MDP . Similar to Proposition 1 in , we can show that for a linear MDP and for any policy π𝜋\\pi there exists {wj,hπ}h=1Hsuperscriptsubscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝑤𝑗ℎ𝜋ℎ1𝐻\\{w_{j,h}^{\\pi}\\}_{h=1}^{H} such that Qj,hπ​(x,a)=⟨wj,hπ,ϕ​(x,a)⟩subscriptsuperscript𝑄𝜋𝑗ℎ𝑥𝑎superscriptsubscript𝑤𝑗ℎ𝜋italic-ϕ𝑥𝑎Q^{\\pi}_{j,h}(x,a)=\\langle w_{j,h}^{\\pi},\\phi(x,a)\\rangle for any (x,a,h)∈𝒮×𝒜×[H]𝑥𝑎ℎ𝒮𝒜delimited-[]𝐻(x,a,h)\\in\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}\\times[H]. We, thus, focus on linear action-value function. Dual problem and Slater’s Condition.\nWe first introduce few notations which we will use throughout this paper. Vhπ,Y​(⋅)=Vh,rπ​(⋅)+Y​Vh,gπ​(⋅)subscriptsuperscript𝑉𝜋𝑌ℎ⋅subscriptsuperscript𝑉𝜋ℎ𝑟⋅𝑌subscriptsuperscript𝑉𝜋ℎ𝑔⋅V^{\\pi,Y}_{h}(\\cdot)=V^{\\pi}_{h,r}(\\cdot)+YV^{\\pi}_{h,g}(\\cdot), and Qhπ,Y​(x,a)=Qr,hπ​(x,a)+Y​Qg,hπ​(x,a)subscriptsuperscript𝑄𝜋𝑌ℎ𝑥𝑎subscriptsuperscript𝑄𝜋𝑟ℎ𝑥𝑎𝑌subscriptsuperscript𝑄𝜋𝑔ℎ𝑥𝑎Q^{\\pi,Y}_{h}(x,a)=Q^{\\pi}_{r,h}(x,a)+YQ^{\\pi}_{g,h}(x,a), where Y𝑌Y is the dual variable. Thus, Vhπ,Y​(⋅)subscriptsuperscript𝑉𝜋𝑌ℎ⋅V^{\\pi,Y}_{h}(\\cdot) and Qhπ,Y​(⋅,⋅)subscriptsuperscript𝑄𝜋𝑌ℎ⋅⋅Q^{\\pi,Y}_{h}(\\cdot,\\cdot) are respectively the composite value function and Q𝑄Q-functions respectively.\nWe can cast the problem (4) as a saddle point problem maxπ⁡minY⁡ℒ​(π,Y)subscript𝜋subscript𝑌ℒ𝜋𝑌\\max_{\\pi}\\min_{Y}\\mathcal{L}(\\pi,Y) where ℒ​(π,Y)=Vr,1π​(x1)+Y​(Vg,1π​(x1)−b)=V1π,Y−Y​bℒ𝜋𝑌superscriptsubscript𝑉𝑟1𝜋subscript𝑥1𝑌superscriptsubscript𝑉𝑔1𝜋subscript𝑥1𝑏superscriptsubscript𝑉1𝜋𝑌𝑌𝑏\\mathcal{L}(\\pi,Y)=V_{r,1}^{\\pi}(x_{1})+Y(V_{g,1}^{\\pi}(x_{1})-b)=V_{1}^{\\pi,Y}-Yb, where π𝜋\\pi is the primal policy and Y𝑌Y is the dual variable. However, the lagrangian is non-concave in π𝜋\\pi  even though it is convex in Y𝑌Y. Nevertheless, the strong duality holds . Hence, there exists optimal dual variable Y∗superscript𝑌Y^{*}, such that maxπ⁡ℒ​(π,Y∗)subscript𝜋ℒ𝜋superscript𝑌\\max_{\\pi}\\mathcal{L}(\\pi,Y^{*}) will correspond to the optimal reward value function. We assume the following slater’s condition in this paper. There exists γ>0𝛾0\\gamma>0, and π¯∈Δ​(𝒜|𝒟,ℋ)¯𝜋Δconditional𝒜𝒟ℋ\\bar{\\pi}\\in\\Delta(\\mathcal{A}|\\mathcal{D},\\mathcal{H}), such that Vg,1π¯​(x1)≥b+γsubscriptsuperscript𝑉¯𝜋𝑔1subscript𝑥1𝑏𝛾V^{\\bar{\\pi}}_{g,1}(x_{1})\\geq b+\\gamma, The optimal dual-variable Y∗≤Vr,1π∗​(x1)−Vr,1π¯​(x1)γ≤Hγsuperscript𝑌subscriptsuperscript𝑉superscript𝜋𝑟1subscript𝑥1subscriptsuperscript𝑉¯𝜋𝑟1subscript𝑥1𝛾𝐻𝛾Y^{*}\\leq\\dfrac{V^{\\pi^{*}}_{r,1}(x_{1})-V^{\\bar{\\pi}}_{r,1}(x_{1})}{\\gamma}\\leq\\dfrac{H}{\\gamma}. The slater’s condition is mild in practice and commonly adopted in previous works [ref]7 [ref]1 . We use the properties of the slater’s condition to bound the performance of our proposed algorithm.
