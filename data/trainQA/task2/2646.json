      "content": "Paper Title: Graph Attention Layer Evolves Semantic Segmentation for Road Pothole Detection: A Benchmark and Algorithms\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA fully convolutional network (FCN) [ref]17 is an end-to-end, pixel-to-pixel semantic segmentation network. It converts all fully connected (FC) layers to convolutions. An FCN typically consists of a downsampling path and an upsampling path. The downsampling path employs a classification network as the backbone to capture semantic/contextual information, while the upsampling path fully recovers the spatial information using skip connections. FCN-32s, FCN-16s, and FCN-8s are three main variants having different upsampling strides to provide coarse, medium-grain, and fine-grain semantic image segmentation results, respectively. In the paper, FCN-8s is used for road pothole detection. U-Net [ref]18 was designed based on FCN. It was extended to work with fewer training samples while yielding more accurate segmentation results. U-Net consists of a contracting path and an expansive path. The contracting path has a typical CNN architecture of convolutions, rectified linear units (ReLUs), and max pooling layers. At the same time, the expansive path combines the desired visual features and spatial information through a sequence of upconvolutions and concatenations. The skip connection between the contracting path and the expansive path helps restore small objects‚Äô locations better. Compared with FCN, U-Net has a large number of feature channels in upsampling layers, allowing it to propagate context information to the layers with higher resolution. SegNet [ref]19 has an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder network employs VGG-16  to generate high-level feature maps, while the decoder network upsamples its input to produce a sparse feature map, which is then fed to a softmax classifier for pixel-wise classification. Therefore, SegNet has a trainable decoder filter bank, while an FCN does not. The network depth kùëòk determines the image downsampling and upsampling by an overall factor of 2k√ó2ksuperscript2ùëòsuperscript2ùëò2^{k}\\times 2^{k}. DeepLabv3+  is developed based on DeepLabv1 , DeepLabv2  and DeepLabv3 . It combines the advantages of both the spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) module and the encoder-decoder architecture. Compared to DeepLabv3, it adds a simple yet efficient decoder module to refine the semantic segmentation. Additionally, it employs depth-wise separable convolution to both atrous SPP (ASPP) and decoder modules, making its encoder-decoder structure much faster. Although ASPP can generate feature maps by concatenating multiple atrous-convolved features, the resolution of these maps is typically not dense enough for applications requiring high accuracy . In this regard, DenseASPP  was developed to connect atrous convolutional layers (ACLs) more densely. The ACLs are organized in a cascade fashion, where the dilation rate increases layer by layer. Then, DenseASPP concatenates the output from each atrous layer with the input feature map and the outputs from lower layers. The concatenated feature map is then fed into the following layer. DenseASPP‚Äôs final output is a feature map generated by multi-scale and multi-rate atrous convolutions. DenseASPP is capable of generating multi-scale features that cover a larger and denser scale range without significantly increasing the model size. Different from the CNNs mentioned above, the pyramid attention network (PAN)  combines an attention mechanism and a spatial pyramid to extract accurate visual features for semantic segmentation. It consists of a feature pyramid attention (FPA) module and a global attention upsample (GAU) module. The FPA module encodes the spatial pyramid attention structure on the high-level output and combines global pooling to learn better feature representations. The GAU module provides global context as a guidance for using low-level visual features to select category localization details. As discussed above, the recent CNNs with encoder-decoder architectures typically perform bilinear upsampling in the last decoder layer for final pixel-wise region prediction. However, simple bilinear upsampling limits the recovered pixel-wise prediction accuracy because it does not take pixel prediction correlations into account . DUpsampling was therefore introduced to recover the pixel-wise prediction from low-resolution CNN outputs by exploiting the redundancy in the semantic segmentation label space. It allows the decoder to downsample the fused visual features to the lowest feature map resolution before merging them. This approach not only reduces the decoder computation cost but also decouples fused feature resolution from the final prediction. Although most deep CNNs have achieved compelling semantic segmentation results, large networks are generally slow and computationally intensive. ESPNet  was designed to resolve this issue. An efficient spatial pyramid (ESP) module consists of point-wise convolutions to help reduce the computational\ncomplexity, and a spatial pyramid of dilated convolutions to resample the feature maps to learn the representations from the large effective receptive field. The ESP module‚Äôs large effective field introduces gridding artifacts, which are then removed using hierarchical feature fusion. A skip-connection between the input and output is also added to improve the information flow. Unlike the above-mentioned CNNs, gated shape CNN (GSCNN)  leverages a two-branch architecture. The regular branch can be any backbone CNN, while the shape branch processes shape information in parallel to the regular branch through a set of residual blocks and gated convolutional layers. Furthermore, GSCNN uses higher-level activations in the regular branch to gate the lower-level activations in the shape branch, effectively reducing noise and helping the shape branch to focus only on the relevant boundary information. This, in turn, efficiently improves the performance of the regular branch. GSCNN then employs an ASPP to combine the information from the two branches in a multi-scale fashion. The experimental results demonstrate that this architecture can produce sharper predictions around region boundaries and can significantly boost the semantic segmentation accuracy for thinner and smaller objects. Graph models can produce useful representations for pixel relations, which greatly helps to improve the semantic segmentation performance. As discussed in Section I, the CRF-based approaches are computationally intensive, and can only be deployed on the final semantic probability map. To solve this disadvantage, we propose GAL, which is capable of producing additional weights based on the relational inductive bias to refine image feature representations in a computationally efficient manner.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: A fully convolutional network (FCN) [ref]17 is an end-to-end, pixel-to-pixel semantic segmentation network.
