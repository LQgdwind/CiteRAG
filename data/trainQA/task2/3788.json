Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

Their Data-efficient image Transformer (DeiT) model pushed ViT ahead with minimal architectural changes, and through the use of advanced augmentations and training techniques.\nTheir efforts highlighted the true potential of a Transformer-based image classifier in medium-sized data regimes, and inspired many more to adopt their training techniques [ref]21 .\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: Dosovitskiy et al.  proposed a Transformer-based image classifier that merely consists of a Transformer encoder [ref]31 and an image tokenizer, named Vision Transformer (ViT).\nPrevious works, such as DETR , explored CNN-Transformer hybrids for object detection.\nViT on the other hand proposed a model that would\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
