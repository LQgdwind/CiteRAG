Compared to other parallel computation models such as PRAM , BSP , LogP  and so on, the advantage of the MPC model lies in its simplicity and the power to capture the essence of computation procedure of modern share-nothing clusters. In the MPC model, computation proceeds in synchronous rounds, where in each round the computation machines first communicate with each other, then conduct local computation. Any pair of machines can communicate in a point-to-point manner, and all the communication messages can be transferred without congestion. Although the MPC model is simple and powerful, one of its most important shortcomings is revealed by some recent works  , which is the strong assumption of homogeneity. All the machines in MPC model are considered as identical, and the communication bandwidth between any pair of machines are identical too . In realistic parallel environment, the assumption of identical computation machines can be satisfied in most cases, but the assumption of identical communication bandwidth can not. Typically, a cluster consists of several racks connected by slower communication channels, and each rack includes several machines connected by faster communication channels. Thus, the communication bandwidth of in-rack and across-rack communication differ significantly, which refutes the basic assumption of homogeneous communication network in MPC model. In order to tackle this shortcoming of the MPC model, a new topology aware massively parallel computation model was proposed and studied in  . The computation machines are still identical in this model111There may be non-computational machines in this model, though., but the communication bandwidth between different pair of machines are different. This model was first proposed in recent works , where the underlying communication network is represented as a graph, and the edges are assigned with a weight which represents the communication bandwidth. However, the paper  only declared the new model but did not give any theoretical results. The other work  considered three data processing tasks on this model, which are set intersection, Cartesian product and sorting. Algorithms and lower bounds about the communication cost optimization problems for the three tasks were proposed . However, the authors of  restricted the underlying communication network to trees, and the algorithm and lower bounds given in that paper can not be generalized to graphs other than trees. In this paper, we follow the line of research started by  , and consider the topology aware massively parallel computation model in a more general case, where the underlying communication network is a complete weighted graph. In this sense, our work is a complement to the work in . The goal of this paper is also to minimize the communication cost. However, unlike the work in  which considers specific computation tasks, in this paper we define general communication cost minimization problems that capture the characteristics of a variety of computation tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: The Massively Parallel Computation model , MPC for short, has been a well acknowledged model to study parallel algorithms    [ref]9  5   ever since it was proposed.
