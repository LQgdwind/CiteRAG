This explosive rise in effectiveness and popularity can be attributed to better, larger datasets such as ImageNet  , and Pascal-VOC , as well as exponentially increasing compute power via stronger, more specialised hardware. As neural network models are more and more ubiquitous and are applied in critical real-world applications, such as medicine , self-driving cars  , military applications  and more, the need arises for explainability. End-users should no longer blindly accept the predictions of a neural network model, but rather the model should try to justify its predictions towards the user. In doing so, the user can determine via expert knowledge in the domain whether the reasoning of the model is sound and valid. Common tools used in this context are visual explanation methods, algorithms that assign relevance scores to features in the input image based on how relevant the feature is to the predicted label. Numerous explanation methods have been introduced in the literature, including but not limited to: Grad-CAM , Guided Backpropagation , Layerwise Relevance Propagation  , LIME , RISE , Sliding-Window Occlusion , Excitation Backprop  and SHAP-values . Previous work evaluating multiple visual explanation methods can be classified in two categories: large-scale studies such as   that use computer-generated data to compare the effectiveness of a large number of different methods, and papers that propose a new explanation method and compare their proposed method to a small set of directly related methods. As far as our knowledge, no large scale comparison has been done using standard datasets depicting real-world scenes.\nTaking the above into account, the contributions of this paper are: i) a large-scale comparison and evaluation of multiple commonly used explanation methods in a more realistic scenario, as well as ii) an in-depth study of the most common evaluation methods for visual explanations. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. section 2 presents an overview of the related work, while section 3 will lay down the experimental methodology followed during the study. In section 4 we share our experiments and results, and we provide a high level discussion in section 5. Finally, we conclude this paper in section 6.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Neural Network models have risen from obscurity to the State-of-the-Art in computer vision tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA) [ref]1 [ref]2, Image Segmentation , Image Classification [ref]4, Object Localisation , Image Captioning   and more.
