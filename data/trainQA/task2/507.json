At each time step t=0,…,T𝑡0…𝑇t=0,\\ldots,T, the agent is in state 𝒙t∈𝒳subscript𝒙𝑡𝒳\\bm{x}_{t}\\in\\mathcal{X} and chooses an action 𝒖t∈𝒰subscript𝒖𝑡𝒰\\bm{u}_{t}\\in\\mathcal{U} transitioning it to a successor state 𝒙t+1∼𝒫​(𝒙t+1|𝒙t,𝒖t)similar-tosubscript𝒙𝑡1𝒫conditionalsubscript𝒙𝑡1subscript𝒙𝑡subscript𝒖𝑡\\bm{x}_{t+1}\\sim\\mathcal{P}\\left(\\bm{x}_{t+1}|\\bm{x}_{t},\\bm{u}_{t}\\right), and yielding a cost c​(𝒙t,𝒖t)𝑐subscript𝒙𝑡subscript𝒖𝑡c(\\bm{x}_{t},\\bm{u}_{t}). Given a state 𝒙tsubscript𝒙𝑡\\bm{x}_{t}, an action 𝒖tsubscript𝒖𝑡\\bm{u}_{t} is sampled from a policy π:𝒳×U→[ref]0 :𝜋→𝒳𝑈01\\pi:\\mathcal{X}\\times{U}\\rightarrow[ref]0 , where we write π​(𝒖t|𝒙t)𝜋conditionalsubscript𝒖𝑡subscript𝒙𝑡\\pi(\\bm{u}_{t}|\\bm{x}_{t}) to represent the conditional density of an action. Upon subsequent interactions, the agent collects a trajectory 𝝉=[𝒙0:T,𝒖0:T]𝝉subscript𝒙:0𝑇subscript𝒖:0𝑇\\bm{\\tau}=[\\bm{x}_{0:T},\\bm{u}_{0:T}], and aims to determine an optimal policy π⋆superscript𝜋⋆\\pi^{\\star} by minimising total expected cost: π⋆∈arg⁡minπ⁡𝔼𝝉∼pπ​(𝝉)​[𝒞​(𝝉):=∑t=0Tγt​c​(𝒙t,𝒖t)]superscript𝜋⋆subscript𝜋subscript𝔼similar-to𝝉subscript𝑝𝜋𝝉delimited-[]assign𝒞𝝉superscriptsubscript𝑡0𝑇superscript𝛾𝑡𝑐subscript𝒙𝑡subscript𝒖𝑡\\pi^{\\star}\\in\\arg\\min_{\\pi}\\,\\mathbb{E}_{\\bm{\\tau}\\sim p_{\\pi}(\\bm{\\tau})}[\\mathcal{C}(\\bm{\\tau}):=\\sum_{t=0}^{T}\\gamma^{t}c(\\bm{x}_{t},\\bm{u}_{t})],\nwhere pπ​(𝝉)subscript𝑝𝜋𝝉p_{\\pi}(\\bm{\\tau}) denotes the trajectory density defined as: pπ​(𝝉)=μ0​(𝒙0)​∏t=0T−1𝒫​(𝒙t+1|𝒙t,𝒖t)​π​(𝒖t|𝒙t)subscript𝑝𝜋𝝉subscript𝜇0subscript𝒙0superscriptsubscriptproduct𝑡0𝑇1𝒫conditionalsubscript𝒙𝑡1subscript𝒙𝑡subscript𝒖𝑡𝜋conditionalsubscript𝒖𝑡subscript𝒙𝑡p_{\\pi}(\\bm{\\tau})=\\mu_{0}(\\bm{x}_{0})\\prod_{t=0}^{T-1}\\mathcal{P}(\\bm{x}_{t+1}|\\bm{x}_{t},\\bm{u}_{t})\\pi(\\bm{u}_{t}|\\bm{x}_{t}), with μ0​(⋅)subscript𝜇0⋅\\mu_{0}(\\cdot) being an initial state distribution. \nConstrained MDPs: The above can be generalised to include various forms of constraints, often motivated by the desire to impose some form of safety measures. Examples are expectation constraints   (which have the same form as the objective, i.e., expected discounted sum of costs), constraints on the variance of the return 8, chance constraints (a.k.a. Value-at-Risk (VaR)) 2, and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) 1 2 7. The latter is the constraint we adopt in this paper for reasons that will be elucidated upon below. Adding constraints means we can’t directly apply standard algorithms like policy gradient , and different techniques are required, e.g., via Lagrange multipliers , as was done in 1 2 7 besides many others. Further, current methods only consider cost minimisation with no regard to exploration as we do in this paper.\nModel-Based Reinforcement Learning: Current solutions to the problem described above (constrained or unconstrained) can be split into model-free and model-based methods. Though effective, model-free algorithms are highly sample inefficient . For sample-efficient solvers, we follow model-based strategies that we now detail. To reduce the number of interactions with the real environments, model-based solvers build surrogate models, 𝒫surrsubscript𝒫surr\\mathcal{P}_{\\text{surr}}, to determine optimal policies. These methods, typically, run two main loops. The first gathers traces from the real environment to update 𝒫surrsubscript𝒫surr\\mathcal{P}_{\\text{surr}}, while the second improves the policy using 𝒫surrsubscript𝒫surr\\mathcal{P}_{\\text{surr}} 9 [ref]24. Among various candidate models, e.g., world models [ref]23, in this paper, we follow PILCO 9 and adopt Gaussian processes (GPs) as we believe that uncertainty quantification and sample efficiency are key for real-world considerations of safety. In this construction, one places a Gaussian process prior on a latent function f𝑓f to map between input-output pairs. Such a prior is fully specified by a mean, m​(𝒙)=𝔼​[f​(𝒙)]𝑚𝒙𝔼delimited-[]𝑓𝒙m(\\bm{x})=\\mathbb{E}\\left[f(\\bm{x})\\right], and a covariance function k​(𝒙,𝒙′)=𝔼​[(f​(𝒙)−m​(𝒙))​(f​(𝒙′)−m​(𝒙′))]𝑘𝒙superscript𝒙′𝔼delimited-[]𝑓𝒙𝑚𝒙𝑓superscript𝒙′𝑚superscript𝒙′k(\\bm{x},\\bm{x}^{\\prime})=\\mathbb{E}\\left[(f(\\bm{x})-m(\\bm{x}))(f(\\bm{x}^{\\prime})-m(\\bm{x}^{\\prime}))\\right] 9. We write f∼𝒢​𝒫​(m​(⋅),k​(⋅,⋅))similar-to𝑓𝒢𝒫𝑚⋅𝑘⋅⋅f\\sim\\mathcal{GP}\\left(m(\\cdot),k(\\cdot,\\cdot)\\right) to emphasize that f𝑓f is sampled from a GP 9.
