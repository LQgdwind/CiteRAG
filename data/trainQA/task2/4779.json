      "content": "Paper Title: TensorAnalyzer: Identification of Urban Patterns in Big Cities using Non-Negative Tensor Factorization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGeoreferenced data, also known as spatial, geographic, or geospatial data, are the essential pieces of information necessary to identify the geographic location of phenomena on the surface of the Earth  . In general, georeferenced data is indexed by geographic coordinates (points referenced by latitude and longitude) that allow the application of spatial pattern extraction techniques to extract valuable information from the data. The following is an overview of the main fields investigated in the literature that seek to find patterns considering several georeferenced data sources. Point pattern analysis has been a growing interest in identifying and analyzing forest fire sites. For example,  studied lightning patterns that caused fires in Ontario from 1976 to 1998. The authors used K-function to evaluate the clustering and the smoothing of the kernel density in order to provide graphical representations of the cluster.  developed a logistic model to estimate the probability of occurrences of fires caused by lightning, considering meteorological variables and indices related to fire risk. Point pattern analysis has also been widely applied in the field of epidemiology in order to understand the relationship between health events and aspects related to individual characteristics (e.g., genetics, behavior, and demographic) and contextual factors (e.g., the socio-economic conditions of the surroundings and the physical environment), in which clustering algorithms are applied to detect spatial groups of diseases   . In this context,   used cluster statistics to show that clusters of HIV-positive individuals can be used to identify hotspots with a high incidence of malaria in Tanzania.   used spatial scanning to explore the clustering of malaria infection in different age groups on Bioko Island in Equatorial Guinea. Recently, we have been witnessing an emerging class of communication platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, FourSquare, and Flickr, that allow users to publish georeferenced content ranging from short status messages to videos. Some studies have been developed using this content information to extract patterns from the data. For example,  developed a tool that uses spatial clustering techniques to extract data patterns from georeferenced mobile devices.  focused on extracting activities and human mobility based on data from mobile devices.  conducted a statistical analysis that aims to identify general spatial patterns in the occurrence of flood-related tweets that may be associated with the proximity and severity of flood events.  presented an approach based on the clustering algorithm DBSCAN  to extract mobility patterns from Twitter messages and then analyze their correlation with demographic, economic, and social data. [ref]2 presented a new methodology based on clustering algorithms to estimate population dynamics from cell phone data. In the context of crimes, data are becoming increasingly available to the population, which has called researchers’ attention to try to understand the criminal patterns of a given location. Crime records are generally georeferenced data; therefore, several approaches have been proposed to extract spatial patterns from these data. For instance, the COPLINK  system is recognized as one of the successful implementations of the clustering technique for criminal data mining, in which the concept of space is applied to identify relationships between suspects and victims .  developed a framework named ReCAP (Regional Crime Analysis Program) that combines multiple data sources to extract patterns.  developed a general tool that allows discovering associations, identifying patterns, and making predictions.   described a tool capable of extracting important features from the georeferenced database and creating digital profiles for all aggressors. Their method compares all individuals in these profiles using a new distance measure and groups them together.  developed a tool to detect crime patterns based on data mining techniques such as clustering and classification.  proposed a tool for analyzing criminal data that focuses on identifying patterns and trends that uses decision trees to classify the data together with clustering algorithms.  employed the k-means  algorithm to extract criminal patterns from large georeferenced data sets. The works described in this section aimed at identifying spatial patterns in georeferenced data and most of them use standard clustering algorithms for this purpose. However, these algorithms require user tuning parameters, a complicated task when the user does not have prior knowledge about the data, especially in noisy real-world data.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: presented an approach based on the clustering algorithm DBSCAN  to extract mobility patterns from Twitter messages and then analyze their correlation with demographic, economic, and social data.
