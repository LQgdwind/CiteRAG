      "content": "Paper Title: Playtesting: What is Beyond Personas\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGame designers envision how a game will work during a play through. As the game develops, it becomes increasingly difficult to predict how players will interact with the game. Playtesters help out this process by providing feedback by playing the game. However, human playtesting introduces latency and additional costs to the process. Therefore, researchers proposed methods to automate the playtesting process  [ref]2 . Additionally, the playtesting process may employ players with distinct playstyles. These players will respond to the game differently, and they will generate different play traces. The game designer can use these play traces to shape her game. In order to automate playtesting with different players, researchers replaced these playtesters with procedural personas. A procedural persona describes an archetypal player’s behavior. Researchers used personas to playtest a Role-Playing Game  and a Match-3  game. As a result, personas enabled distinct playstyles and helped to playtest a game like distinct players. In order to realize the personas using RL agents, researchers used a utility function  to define the decision model of a persona. This utility function was used as the reward function of the Q-Learning agents. However, this replacement makes the agents bound to the utility function. Since the utility function is tailored for a specific decision model, the behavior of these agents is constant throughout the game. Therefore, the procedural personas approach is not flexible enough to create personas with developing decision models. For example, a player may change her objectives while playing the game. Consequently, the decision model of this player cannot be captured by a utility function. Bartle [ref]7 presents examples of these changes that a player can undergo while playing a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game. We believe that the change in the playstyle occurs after accomplishing a goal. For example, a player may start a game by opening the treasures to find a required item and then killing monsters. This player chooses her actions like a Treasure Collector until she finds the desired item and becomes a Monster Killer. We propose a sequence of goals to model the decision-making mechanism of this player. The sequence-based approach was previously used in automated video game testing agents  and was found more practical than non-sequence-based approaches. The developing persona model consists of multiple goals that are linked. Each goal consists of criteria and a utility function. The utility function serves the same purpose as in procedural personas. The criteria determine until which condition the current goal is active. When the current goal criteria are fulfilled, the next goal becomes active. The agent plays until the last goal criterion is fulfilled or until the end of the game. The game designer sets the criteria and utility functions of each goal. The goal structure enables the creation of dynamic personas. Additionally, this approach gives a more granularized control over a persona. The game designer can create variations of Monster Killer by setting different criteria. In order to playtest a casual Monster Killer, the game designer may set a health threshold as the criterion; and to playtest a hardcore Monster Killer, the game designer may set the percentage of monsters killed as the criterion. Furthermore, the game designer may envision a game with various endings. In order to playtest her game, she utilizes an agent that behaves like an Exit persona and exercises this agent multiple times. Then, the game designer analyzes the trajectories generated by this agent and sees that all the trajectories provide data for only one of the possible endings. On the other hand, a human playtester would have generated trajectories that cover various endings. Thus, the shortcoming of automated playtests is not caused by the Exit persona but by the inherent nature of RL algorithms. RL algorithms such as Deep Q-Network (DQN) , Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) 0, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) 1 disregard the previous trajectories. Consequently, even if we train an agent with any of these algorithms and then evaluate the agent, and repeat this process numerous times, all the generated trajectories would be similar most of the time. However, the trajectories may be different due to the following reasons a) the random initialization of the Neural Network (DQN and PPO) b) ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-greedy policy of DQN c) stochasticity of MCTS d) the game’s nondeterminism. The critical point is that even if the agent generates a distinct trajectory, this result is not by design but by random chance. Exploration methods in RL improve the agent’s policy by motivating the agent to explore the environment. As the agent explores an environment, the agent improves its policy. The researchers proposed methods to motivate the agent to explore less visited states 2 3 4. Compared to the traditional exploration methods such as ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-greedy, where exploration is achieved through randomness, these modern algorithms entice exploration logically. These algorithms learn to distinguish the unvisited states from the visited states, consequently, these algorithms guide the agents to less-visited states. As a result, exploration methods vastly improved the agent’s score, such as Montezuma’s Revenge 2. On the other hand, APF knows the previous trajectories and guides the agent to learn to play differently from previous ones. For this purpose, APF penalizes the agent when the agent visits a similar state and rewards the agent when the agent visits a different state, compared to the states in the previous trajectories. APF employs the state comparison algorithms used in exploration algorithms. These state comparison algorithms are the backbone of exploration research, and researchers tested these algorithms in multiple games. We show how we build the APF framework to generate new and unique playtests and how APF augments any RL agent. In this paper, we list the contributions as follows. Our first contribution is the developing persona. The developing persona is more flexible and capable than the current persona models. We show how game designers can utilize the developing persona to empower the playtesting. Our second contribution is the Alternative Path Finder. We present a generic APF framework that can augment every RL agent. We use the GVG-AI 5 and VizDoom 6 environments to demonstrate our proposed methodologies. This paper is structured as follows: Section II describes the examples and methodologies of related research. We grouped the related research into four subsections: Playtesting, Personas in Playtesting, Automated Playtesting, and Exploration Methods in Reinforcement Learning. The developing persona is based on the first three subsections. Next, APF is founded on the Exploration Methods in Reinforcement Learning. Our proposed methodology that consists of developing persona and APF is presented in Section III. Section IV describes our experimentation setup and Section V presents the results of these experiments. Section VI discusses the outcomes of the strategies used, their contributions and limitations. Lastly, Section VII concludes this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: feedback by playing the game.
