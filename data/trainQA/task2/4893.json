      "content": "Paper Title: Planning for Sample Efficient Imitation Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe real-world sequential decision process in robotics is highly challenging. Robots have to handle high dimensional input such as images, need to solve long horizon problems, some critical timesteps need highly accurate maneuver, and the learning process on the real robot has to be sample efficient. Imitation learning is a promising approach to solving those problems, given a small dataset of expert demonstrations. However, current imitation algorithms struggle to achieve these goals simultaneously. There are two kinds of popular imitation learning algorithms, Behavior Cloning (BC) and Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL). BC formulates imitation learning as a supervised learning problem. It needs no in-environment samples, but it suffers from the covariate shift issue , often leading to test time performance degradation. Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) [ref]16 [ref]6 casts imitation learning as a distribution matching problem. Though AIL suffers less from the covariate shift problem and can perform better than BC on some domains, it requires impractical number of online interactions   and can perform badly on image inputs [ref]37. These drawbacks heavily limit its application in fields like robotics, where physical robot time matters. In summary, current imitation learning algorithms fail to achieve high online testing performance and high in-environment sample efficiency at the same time. Further, the two types of imitation algorithms seem to be incompatible since they are based on two completely different training objectives. Previous work finds that it is hard to unify them  naively. Inspired by the recent success in sample efficient RL, such as EfficientZero , we propose a planning-based imitation algorithm named EfficientImitate (EI) that achieves high test performance and high in-environment sample efficiency at the same time. Our method extends AIL to a model-based setting with multi-step losses under the MCTS-based RL framework. Our algorithm also unifies the two types of the previous imitation algorithms (BC and AIL) naturally, thanks to the planning component of our algorithm. Intuitively, BC gives a coarse solution that is correct most of the time but fails to match the expert’s behavior in the long term. On the other hand, AIL knows the goal of the learning, i.e., matching state action distribution, but doesn’t give the solution directly. Our method’s planning component unifies those two methods and shows a significant performance boost, especially in the harder tasks such as Humanoid. We illustrate the detailed procedure in Figure 1. We validate our idea not only on state-based tasks but also on image-based tasks, which relatively few previous algorithms can handle them [ref]37. EI achieves state-of-the-art results in sample efficiency and performance. It shows over 4x gain in performance in the limited sample setting on state-based and image-based tasks. On harder tasks such as Humanoid, the gain is even larger. A by-product of this paper is that we extend the recent EfficientZero algorithm to the continuous action space. We open-source the code at https://github.com/zhaohengyin/EfficientImitate to facilitate future research. Our contributions in this paper are summarized as follows. We present EfficientImitate, a sample efficient imitation learning algorithm based on MCTS. We identify that MCTS can benefit from BC by using BC actions during the search, which is crucial for challenging tasks. EfficientImitate suggests a natural way to unify BC and AIL. We conduct experiments in both the state and the image domain to evaluate EI. Experimental results show that EI can achieve state-of-the-art sample efficiency and performance.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: learning problem.
