      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient and Effective ER with Progressive Blocking\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTable 2 summarizes the main symbols used throughout this paper. Let V𝑉V be the input set of records, with |V|=n𝑉𝑛|V|=n. Consider an (unknown) graph 𝒞=(V,E+)𝒞𝑉superscript𝐸\\mathcal{C}=(V,E^{+}), where (u,v)∈E+𝑢𝑣superscript𝐸(u,v)\\in E^{+} means that u𝑢u and v𝑣v represent the same entity.\n𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is transitively closed, that is, each of its connected components C⊆V𝐶𝑉C\\subseteq V is a clique representing a distinct entity. We call each clique a cluster of V𝑉V, and refer to the partition induced by 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} as the ER ground truth. Given a set of matching record pairs A′⊆V×Vsuperscript𝐴′𝑉𝑉A^{\\prime}\\subseteq V\\times V, Pair Recall is the fraction of pairs (u,v)∈E+𝑢𝑣superscript𝐸(u,v)\\in E^{+} that can be either (i) matched directly, because (u,v)∈A′𝑢𝑣superscript𝐴′(u,v)\\in A^{\\prime}, or (ii) indirectly inferred from other pairs (u,w0),(w0,w1),…,(wc,v)∈A′𝑢subscript𝑤0subscript𝑤0subscript𝑤1…subscript𝑤𝑐𝑣superscript𝐴′(u,w_{0}),(w_{0},w_{1}),\\dots,(w_{c},v)\\in A^{\\prime} by connectivity. A formal definition of the blocking task follows. Given a set of records V𝑉V, group records into possibly overlapping blocks ℬ≡{B1,B2,…}ℬsubscript𝐵1subscript𝐵2…\\mathcal{B}\\equiv\\{B_{1},B_{2},\\dots\\}, Bi⊆Vsubscript𝐵𝑖𝑉B_{i}\\subseteq V and compute a graph P𝑃P =(V,A′)absent𝑉superscript𝐴′=(V,A^{\\prime}), where A′⊆Asuperscript𝐴′𝐴A^{\\prime}\\subseteq A, A≡{(u,v):∃Bi∈ℬ​ s.t. ​u∈Bi∧v∈Bi}𝐴conditional-set𝑢𝑣subscript𝐵𝑖ℬ s.t. 𝑢subscript𝐵𝑖𝑣subscript𝐵𝑖A\\equiv\\{(u,v):\\exists B_{i}\\in\\mathcal{B}\\textnormal{ s.t. }u\\in B_{i}\\land v\\in B_{i}\\}, such that A′superscript𝐴′A^{\\prime} is sparse (|A′|<<(n2)much-less-thansuperscript𝐴′binomial𝑛2|A^{\\prime}|<<{n\\choose 2}) and A′superscript𝐴′A^{\\prime} has high Pair Recall. We refer to P𝑃P as the blocking graph. The blocking graph P𝑃P is the final product of blocking and contains all the pairs that can be considered for pair matching. The efficiency and effectiveness of the blocking method is measured as Pair Recall (PR) of (the set of edges in) P𝑃P and the number of edges in it for a certain PR, respectively.\nBlocking methods consist of three sub-tasks as defined by : block building, block cleaning and comparison cleaning. In the following, we describe each of these steps and the corresponding methods in the literature. Block building (ℬ​ℬℬℬ\\mathcal{BB}) takes as input V𝑉V and returns a block collection ℬℬ\\mathcal{B}, by assigning each record in V𝑉V to possibly multiple blocks. The popular standard blocking  strategy creates a separate block Btsubscript𝐵𝑡B_{t} for each token t𝑡t in the records and assigns to Btsubscript𝐵𝑡B_{t} all the records that contain the token t𝑡t. In order to tolerate spelling errors, q-grams blocking  considers character-level q-grams instead of entire tokens. Other strategies include canopy clustering  and sorted neighborhood . Canopy clustering iteratively selects a random seed record r𝑟r, and creates a new block Brsubscript𝐵𝑟B_{r} (or a canopy) with all the records that have a high similarity with r𝑟r with respect to a given similarity function (e.g., using a subset of features ). We can use different similarity functions to build different sets of canopies. Sorted neighborhood sorts all the records according to multiple sort orders (e.g., each according to a different attribute ) and then it slides a window w𝑤w of tokens over each ordering, every time creating a new block Bwsubscript𝐵𝑤B_{w}. Blocks have the same number of distinct tokens but the number of records in a block can vary significantly. Each of these techniques creates O​(n)𝑂𝑛O(n) blocks. Block cleaning (ℬ​𝒞ℬ𝒞\\mathcal{BC}) takes as input the block collection ℬℬ\\mathcal{B} and returns a subset ℬ′⊆ℬsuperscriptℬ′ℬ\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}\\subseteq\\mathcal{B} by pruning blocks that may contain too many non-matching record pairs. Block cleaning is typically performed by assigning each block a s​c​o​r​e:ℬ→I​R:𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒→ℬIRscore:\\mathcal{B}\\rightarrow{\\rm I\\!R} with a block scoring procedure and then pruning blocks with low score. Traditional scoring strategies include functions of block sizes such as TF-IDF  . Comparison cleaning (𝒞​𝒞𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{CC}) takes as input the set A𝐴A of all the intra-block record pairs in the block collection ℬ′superscriptℬ′\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime} (which is a subset of the intra-block record pairs in ℬℬ\\mathcal{B}) and returns a graph P𝑃P =(V,A′)absent𝑉superscript𝐴′=(V,A^{\\prime}), with A′⊆Asuperscript𝐴′𝐴A^{\\prime}\\subseteq A, by pruning pairs that are likely to be non-matching. Comparison cleaning is typically performed by assigning each pair a w​e​i​g​h​t:A→I​R:𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡→𝐴IRweight:A\\rightarrow{\\rm I\\!R} and then pruning pairs with low weight. Weighting strategies include meta-blocking  possibly with active learning [ref]29 . In classic meta-blocking, w​e​i​g​h​t​(u,v)𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑢𝑣weight(u,v) corresponds to the number of blocks in which u𝑢u and v𝑣v co-occur, based on the assumption that that more blocks a record pair shares, the more likely it is to be matching.111This assumption holds for block building methods such as standard blocking, q-grams blocking and sorted neighborhood with multiple orderings , and extends naturally to canopy clustering by using multiple similarity functions. The recent BLOSS strategy  employs active learning on top of the pairs generated by meta-blocking, and learns a classifier using features extracted from the blocking graph for further pruning. We denote with ℬℬ\\mathcal{B}(X,Y,Z𝑋𝑌𝑍X,Y,Z) a blocking strategy that uses the methods X𝑋X, Y𝑌Y, and Z𝑍Z, respectively for block building, block cleaning and comparison cleaning. The strategy used in our cars example (Example 1) can be thus denoted as ℬℬ\\mathcal{B}(standard blocking, TF-IDF, meta-blocking). After blocking.  Typical ER algorithms include pair matching and entity clustering operations. Such operations label as “matching” the pairs referring to the same entity and “non-matching” otherwise, and typically require the use of a classifier  or a crowd . Clustering consists of building a possibly noisy clustering 𝒞′superscript𝒞′\\mathcal{C}^{\\prime} according to labels, and can be done with a variety of techniques, including robust variants of connected components  and random graphs . This noisy clustering is the final product of ER.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: by assigning each pair a w​e​i​g​h​t:A→I​R:𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡→𝐴IRweight:A\\rightarrow{\\rm I\\!R} and then pruning pairs with low weight.
