      "content": "Paper Title: Generalization in Automated Process Discovery: A Framework based on Event Log Patterns\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn process mining, the automated discovery of process models has received much attention. With a plethora of techniques developed to discover a process model from a given event log, the importance to assess the quality of process models has become essential.\nIn particular, the quality will be measured by comparing three constructs of a process: the event log, the process model and the (process) system representing the recorded, the normative and the true behavior of a process, respectively.\nFig. 1 illustrates how three orthogonal quality dimensions have been proposed based on a set comparison of the three constructs.\nFitness (a.k.a. recall) measures\nthe fraction of the behavior of a log that is covered by the model.\nPrecision measures the fraction of the behavior of a process model that was not observed in the event log. The generalization dimension considers that an event log is just a sample of the true behavior of the process system. It is concerned with measuring the degree to which a process model describes the underlying system and hence avoids overfitting the event log, i.e. it measures the fraction of the system that is covered in the model.\nBesides automated discovery, fitness, precision and generalization also can be used for the purpose of conformance checking in process mining   .\nFinally, a fourth orthogonal quality dimension simplicity measures how complex a process model is, and it is based on the Occam’s Razor principle: the best model is the simplest model explaining the behaviour of the log.\nPlease note that this work only considers logs that do not contain behavior outside the process system, which can be removed in a preprocessing step as described in .\nThis article proposes a framework for measures in the generalization dimension. For that purpose, we discuss the generalization definition next. Generalization definition.\nGeneralization measures how well the process model describes the underlying system , however,\nthere lies a significant problem since the complete behavior of the system, i.e. the true behavior of a process, is unknown.\nIn , the behavior of the process system was specified to act like an event log with unknown traces. This allows to relate the system to the process model with both existing fitness and precision measures adapted to the system instead of the log, i.e. the system fitness and system precision measures the fraction of the system behavior that is covered by the model and the fraction of model behavior that is covered by the system, respectively.\nIt is common to assume that the system precision is 1, i.e. that a process model does not contain behavior outside the system. Hence, the generalization of a process model should measure the fitness of the model towards the system.\nAdditionally, generalization measures should also be orthogonal to other measures such as log fitness and log precision. Hence, the generalization measure should only measure the fraction of new unseen behavior of the system that is covered by the process model and has not been recorded in the event log yet.\nGiven a process model and an event log, a common definition for generalization measures then was proposed to measure the probability that new unseen traces fit the process model  . Hence, every generalization measure faces the challenge of defining the behavior of unseen traces of the system based on the example behavior that was observed in the event log. Next, we discuss current state-of-the-art measures for the generalization dimension. Alignments generalization.\nThe first generalization measure proposed in [ref]9 relates each activity occurrence, a.k.a. event, in an event log to an execution state in the process model just before executing the activity. For every execution state, it collects the frequency of events being executed in the state and the number of different activities that can be executed at the execution state. An estimator then measures the probability that a new event\nvisiting the state will be a new unseen event as a fraction of different activities towards the frequency of the state. A generalization measure is then one minus the average of all estimators for all execution states.\nThe alignment generalization measure is however only applicable to fully fitting event logs. The proposed workaround of using alignments for the traces of an event log with the process model as a new event log distorts the measurement of generalization.\nWe did not include the alignment generalization in our evaluation since it was later shown in  that this measure assigns high generalization values to simple models that do not contain any generalizing constructs. Negative events generalization.\nThe measure proposed in  explicitly defines new and unseen behavior by inserting negative events at each trace position by cross referencing events from other traces. These negative events are weighted with a moving window by the fraction of the prefix that has been observed in another trace to include a measure for the confidence of the negative events.\nThe measure then counts the number of allowed generalizations by replaying the traces of the event log on the process model and at each state testing whether negative events could be replayed. If that is the case the allowed generalizations is increased by one minus the weight of the negative event and otherwise the disallowed generalizations are increased. The generalization is then the fraction of allowed generalizations to the overall number of generalizations. Anti-alignments generalization.\nIn [ref]5, a generalization measure was proposed based on the idea that if newly observed behavior introduces only new paths through the process model but does not introduce new states then the process model generalizes new behavior well.\nThis idea is instantiated by means of a recovery distance, i.e. the maximal distance between the states visited by the log and the states visited by an anti-alignment. A process model generalizes the behavior of an event log well, if it has a minimal recovery distance and a large distance to the anti-alignment. A generalization measures then is defined for each anti-alignment when leaving exactly one trace out of the event log.\nHence, the anti-alignment generalization does not specify new unseen behavior outside the event log.\nFurther, the anti-alignments measure is also only applicable to fully fitting event logs. Adversarial networks generalization.\nA recent generalization measure proposed in 0 uses sequence generative adversarial networks and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to sample unobserved trace variants based on the trace distribution of the input event log. The generalization is then computed as the harmonic mean between the fitness and the precision of the process model and the newly computed trace variants.\nAs the authors state, it still has to be seen how well the generated trace variants describe the underlying system as the system’s behavior is unknown, in the absence of a ground truth in the experiments reported in this paper.\nWhile the application of adversarial networks is promising to find new trace variants, the general applicability of this approach in practice is hindered by its specific hardware requirements (high GPU). This article presents a more structured approach to identify behavior not observed in an event log. The approach is based on the idea that patterns in an event log are excerpts of the process behavior.\nFor each pattern we propose to find a set of traces representing unseen behavior of the system. We then compute alignments between the unobserved traces and the process model, and then test the fulfilment of each pattern by analysing the such alignments.\nFor example, a sequence of activities in the event log that is repeated a certain number of times implies that this sequence could be repeated with a different number of repetitions in the underlying system.\nThis observation should be generalized with a loop structure for the repeating sequence in the process model. We derive a new unobserved trace with a high number of repetitions and align it with the process model. If the alignment could match all repetitions of the sequence then the pattern was successfully generalized with a loop structure in the process model. The proposed pattern-generalization measures have the following advantages:\n\n\n(1) the generalization is more intuitive for process analysts to understand because the unseen behavior is related to specific patterns;\n\n(2) the proposed measure can handle also unfitting event logs because it uses alignments to relate the model and the log, and\n\n(3) improvements for generalization issues can be easily identified by testing certain control structures related to the patterns in the process models.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: that was observed in the event log. Next, we discuss current state-of-the-art measures for the generalization dimension.
