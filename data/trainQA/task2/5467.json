We use GeForce RTX 2080Ti GPUs to run MINERVA, Neural-LP, and DRUM because these methods use TensorFlow version 1. For ASER, we implement the string matching based inference model described in . The original program of MINERVA is designed only to predict a tail entity. We add reversed triplets to also predict a head entity. In Multi-Hop, we set all the add_reverse_edge options to be true. We run AnyBURL with different rule learning times: 10 seconds, 100 seconds, 1,000 seconds and 10,000 seconds. Since the results of running 10,000 seconds are similar to those of 1,000 seconds, we use the results of 1,000 seconds. We use the best hyperparameters provided by the authors of each of the baseline methods except PTransE, RPJE, TransD, ANALOGY, QuatE, and BiQUE; we tune the hyperparameters of PTransE, RPJE, TransD, ANALOGY, QuatE, and BiQUE because the best hyperparameters are not provided for these methods. For PTransE and RPJE, we tune the learning rate α𝛼\\alpha using the range of α={10−6,5⋅10−6,10−5,5⋅10−5,10−4,5⋅10−4}𝛼superscript106⋅5superscript106superscript105⋅5superscript105superscript104⋅5superscript104\\alpha=\\{10^{-6},5\\cdot 10^{-6},10^{-5},5\\cdot 10^{-5},10^{-4},5\\cdot 10^{-4}\\} and the margin γ𝛾\\gamma using the range of γ={0.5,1.0,2.0}𝛾0.51.02.0\\gamma=\\{0.5,1.0,2.0\\}. We use TransD, ANALOGY, QuatE, and BiQUE, which are implemented based on OpenKE . For TransD, we tune the learning rate α𝛼\\alpha using the range of α={0.1,0.5,1.0,2.0,5.0}𝛼0.10.51.02.05.0\\alpha=\\{0.1,0.5,1.0,2.0,5.0\\} and the margin γ𝛾\\gamma using the range of γ={2.0,5.0,10.0}𝛾2.05.010.0\\gamma=\\{2.0,5.0,10.0\\}. For ANALOGY, we tune the learning rate α𝛼\\alpha using the range of α={0.001,0.005,0.01,0.05,0.1,0.5}𝛼0.0010.0050.010.050.10.5\\alpha=\\{0.001,0.005,0.01,0.05,0.1,0.5\\} and the regularization rate β𝛽\\beta using the range of β={0.1,0.5,1.0}𝛽0.10.51.0\\beta=\\{0.1,0.5,1.0\\}. For QuatE and BiQUE, we tune the learning rate α𝛼\\alpha using the range of α={0.1,0.5,1.0,2.0,5.0}𝛼0.10.51.02.05.0\\alpha=\\{0.1,0.5,1.0,2.0,5.0\\} and the regularization rate β𝛽\\beta using the range of β={0.1,0.5,1.0}𝛽0.10.51.0\\beta=\\{0.1,0.5,1.0\\}. For TransD, ANALOGY, QuatE, and BiQUE, validation is done every 50 epochs up to 500 epochs, and we select the best epoch based on the validation results. Table 11 shows the best hyperparameters of these methods for the triplet prediction and the base-level link prediction. For the conditional link prediction problem, we combine the scores of the triplet prediction and the base-level link prediction as described in the main paper; we use the best hyperparameters of the triplet prediction and the base-level link prediction.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: In experiments, we use 12 different baseline methods which are ASER , MINERVA , Multi-Hop [ref]24, Neural-LP [ref]39, DRUM [ref]31, AnyBURL , PTransE , RPJE , TransD , ANALOGY , QuatE , and BiQUE .
