      "content": "Paper Title: Create Your World: Lifelong Text-to-Image Diffusion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis section briefly reviews several representative works on two related topics, Lifelong Machine Learning and i.e., Text-to-image Diffusion. For the related Lifelong Machine Learning, the earlier works intends to transfer the selective information from task cluster to new tasks , or transferring invariance knowledge by using neural networks . The main target is to learn on non-stationary data streams without catastrophically forgetting previous knowledge. To achieve this,  proposes a new continual multi-view task learning model by combining sparse subspace learning and deep matrix factorization; [ref]12 presents a cross-domain lifelong learning framework for reinforcement learning, which can improve the efficiency when specializing to different domains. Different from the latent knowledge-based algorithms,  [ref]13 develops an elastic weight consolidation (EWC) model, and implements it via using the diagonal of the Fisher information matrix;  proposes a learning without forgetting (LwF) method into convolutional neural networks, which could retrain the neural networks without using the past task data. These regularization-based algorithms can consolidate the learned knowledge via constraining the neural network parameters. Instead of fixing the neural networks,  proposes a novel deep network to dynamically decide its network capacity when a sequence of tasks arrive; DER  adds a new learnable feature extractor for its network architecture while freezing the previously learned feature extractor, when learning each a new task; DyTox  proposes a transformer architecture with dynamic expansion of task tokens in the continual learning paradigm. Amongst the recently-proposed discussions above, there is no works concerning how to extending lifelong learning in the text-to-image fields, and our work is a pioneering work to attain lifelong text-to-image generation in computer vision and robot perception applications. For the Text-to-Image diffusion, diffusion models[ref]5   (DM) have demonstrated remarkable generative power in various fields, such as image-to-image generation , text-to-image generation[ref]5 , text-to-video generation 2 and text-to-3D generation3 4. By encoding text inputs into a condition vector using a pretrained CLIP 5, text-to-image diffusion have achieved successful applications in image generation. As examples, GLIDE represents a text-guided diffusion model that encompasses both image generation and editing capabilities; Imagen adopts classifier free guidance and a pretrained large language model for image generation. In particular, as a significant advancement of latent diffusion, Stable Diffusion[ref]5 utilizes VQ-GAN6 to achieve the mapping of the representation space from pixel space to latent space. This transformation can not only reduce the computational burden associated with processing large-scale data samples, but also enable the model to focus the comprehension of well-compressed semantic features and visual patterns. In parallel, both StructureDiffusion7 and Attend-and-Excite8 identify the risk of catastrophic neglect in synthetic images of pretrained Stable Diffusion, and mitigate the effects of this risk via introducing structured guidance or refining the cross-attention units. Personalized Text-to-Image diffusion: In order to leverage the potential of Stable Diffusion[ref]5 for synthesizing images that align with the user’s own concepts, recent works have focused on the customization and personalization of text-to-image diffusion models through fine-tuning techniques applied to personalized datasets. For instance DreamBooth9 employs a class-specific prior preservation loss to safeguard prior knowledge and conducts fine-tuning of all parameters of Stable Diffusion. In contrast, Textual Inversion focuses on learning word vectors solely for new concepts. Custom Diffusion selectively fine-tunes a limited number of parameters within specific attention layers, facilitating fast tuning. Meanwhile, SVDiff leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the weight matrices of Stable Diffusion, thereby enabling more efficient tuning on personalized datasets. However, all the above models cannot consecutively incorporate a new text-to-image diffusion task without reusing the past data.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: without catastrophically forgetting previous knowledge.
