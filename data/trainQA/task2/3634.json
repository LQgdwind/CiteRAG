      "content": "Paper Title: Exploiting Neighbor Effect: Conv-Agnostic GNN Framework for Graphs with Heterophily\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, heterophilic graph learning has become an upward-trending research topic, and various specific structured GNNs have been proposed. Most argue that message passing during inter-class edges is harmful to the node classification task and try to avoid harmfulness. Current kinds of literature can be divided into three lines: (1) Some works deal with heterophily from the spectral domain. FAGCN [ref]14 divides the message from each edge into low-frequency and high-frequency signals and shows that both the low- and high-frequency signals are necessary for heterophilic graph learning. In addition, some works aim at extracting high-order approximation with graph spectral filters. GPRGNN [ref]19 modifies the convolution to the generalized page rank and learns an arbitrary K-order polynomial graph filter. GCNII [ref]31 proposes the initial residual and identity mapping for vanilla GCN and theoretically proves that it can express a K-order polynomial filter with arbitrary coefficients.\nBernNet  learns arbitrary graph spectral filters via Bernstein approximation to oversimplified or ill-posed filters.\nACM-GCN  modifies graph convolution by explicitly dividing it into low-pass, high-pass, and identity filters in each layer and adaptively fusing them for each node. However, these spectral-based methods need to specifically design and modify the graph convolution, which is not trivial to generalize to broader spatial GNNs like GAT and GIN. (2) Some works reorganize the graph structure to obtain a more homophilic signal.\nGeom-GCN  utilizes geometric aggregation to capture structural similarity in the latent space and long-range dependencies.\nNLGNN  leverages attention-guide sorting to generate a re-connected graph and conducts non-local aggregation.\nSLAPS  combines the self-supervised technique to infer a homophily latent structure.\nGDAMN  proposes the decoupling attention mechanism on both features and labels to increase the intra-class and reduce inter-class edge weights. (3) Some works aim to capture high-order neighbor information, which was proven to be homophily dominant [ref]14.\nMixHop  repeatedly mixes representations of multi-hop neighbors to achieve higher-order message passing.\nJK-Nets  jumps the intermediate representations to the last layer for better structure-aware\nrepresentation.\nH2GCN  proposes three designs with separated ego and neighbors, hider-order neighbors, and a combination of intermediate representations to combine the message from neighbors. Unlike these specific GNN architectures to avoid the harmfulness of inter-class edges; instead, we consider the inter-class edges from an identifiable neighbor distribution perspective. Furthermore, we propose a simple and general Conv-Agnostic framework. This framework can be regarded as a plug-in component and is compatible with most GNNs to improve their performance on heterophilic graphs.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: to the node classification task and try to avoid harmfulness.
