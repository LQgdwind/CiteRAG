      "content": "Paper Title: Projection-Free Stochastic Bi-level Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe review some of the related work in the context of\nbi-level optimization, compositional optimization, and projection-free algorithms. Bi-level optimization has had a long history, with the earliest applications in economic game theory . Bi-level optimization has recently received great attention from the machine learning community due to the number of applications in the area . A series of works that proposed to solve the problem of the form (1) has appeared recently [ref]7  [ref]19 [ref]9   . Of these, the seminal works in [ref]7  proposed a class of double-loop approximation algorithms to iteratively approximate the stochastic gradient of the outer objective and incurred a sample complexity of ùí™‚Äã(œµ‚àí2)ùí™superscriptitalic-œµ2\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2}) in order to achieve the œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon-stationary point. The double loop structure of these approaches made them impractical for large-scale problems; [ref]7 required solving an inner optimization problem to a predefined accuracy, while  required a large batch size of ùí™‚Äã(œµ‚àí1)ùí™superscriptitalic-œµ1\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-1}) at each iteration. To address this issue, various single-loop methods, involving simultaneous update of inner and outer optimization variables, have been developed [ref]19 [ref]9  . A single-loop two-time scale stochastic algorithm proposed in [ref]19 incurred a sub-optimal sample complexity of ùí™‚Äã(œµ‚àí2.5)ùí™superscriptitalic-œµ2.5\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2.5}). This is further improved recently in [ref]9  , in which the authors have utilized the momentum-based variance reduction technique from  to obtain optimal convergence rates. While all of the above-mentioned works seek to solve (1), they are projection-based and require a projection on to ùí≥ùí≥{{\\mathcal{X}}} at every iteration. In this work, we are interested in developing projection-free stochastic optimization algorithms for bi-level problems, which is still an open problem and the subject of the work in this paper. Compositional optimization problems have been recently studied and various algorithms have been proposed in       . The seminal work in  proposed a quasi-gradient method called stochastic compositional gradient descent (CGD) to solve the problem via a two time-scale approach. In , the authors proposed an accelerated SCGD method that achieved an improved sample complexity of ùí™‚Äã(œµ‚àí2)ùí™superscriptitalic-œµ2\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2}) for convex objectives and ùí™‚Äã(œµ‚àí2.25)ùí™superscriptitalic-œµ2.25\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2.25}) for non-convex objectives. Further, different variance-reduced SCGD variants have been proposed, such as SCVR , VRSC-PG , SARAH-Compositional  , and STORM-Compositional . In the literature, we can also find some single time-scale algorithms to solve compositional problems  . Work in  presented a nested averaged stochastic approximation (NASA) and proved a sample complexity of ùí™‚Äã(œµ‚àí2)ùí™superscriptitalic-œµ2\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2}). Recently, another single time-scale algorithm called the stochastically corrected stochastic compositional gradient method (SCSC) is proposed in  that converges at the same rate as the SGD methods for non-compositional stochastic optimization. It further adopted the Adam-type adaptive gradient approach and achieved the optimal sample complexity of ùí™‚Äã(œµ‚àí2)ùí™superscriptitalic-œµ2\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2}). Again, all the above-mentioned algorithms either solve an unconstrained problem or use projection operation at each iteration to deal with the constraints. In this work, we developed a projection-free algorithm for compositional problems as well. Note that even-though compositional problems are a special case of bi-level problems, we have studied them separately in this work and proposed a novel projection-free algorithm specifically for compositional problems to achieve the optimal sample complexity. Projection-free algorithms have been extensively studied to solve the single-level optimization problems of the form (1) in the literature   . A number of first-order projection-free algorithms have been developed for stochastic optimization problems as well     . The stochastic FW method proposed in  achieves a sample complexity of ùí™‚Äã(œµ‚àí3)ùí™superscriptitalic-œµ3\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-3}) but requires an the batch size b=ùí™‚Äã(t)ùëèùí™ùë°b=\\mathcal{O}(t), where tùë°t is the iteration index. The need for increasing batch sizes was dropped in , which worked with a standard mini-batch but still achieved the same sample complexity. Finally, an improved stochastic recursive gradient estimator-based algorithm called ORGFW was proposed in  and achieved a sample complexity of ùí™‚Äã(œµ‚àí2)ùí™superscriptitalic-œµ2\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2}). For non-convex problems,  proposed an approach where the batch-size depends on the total number of iterations, resulting in a sample complexity of ùí™‚Äã(œµ‚àí4)ùí™superscriptitalic-œµ4\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-4}). Later, work in  came up with a two-sample strategy and achieved ùí™‚Äã(œµ‚àí3)ùí™superscriptitalic-œµ3\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-3}) sample complexity. We remark that the idea of projection-free algorithms is limited only to single-level optimization problems in the existing literature. Therefore, there are no corresponding oracle complexity bounds for projection-free algorithms in bilevel settings, and our work fills this crucial gap. We present our main contributions as follows.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: great attention from the machine learning community due to the number of applications in the area .
