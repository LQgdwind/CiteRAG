      "content": "Paper Title: PrEditor3D: Fast and Precise 3D Shape Editing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur method can generate various impressive edited shapes from complex input shapes and prompts. We illustrate a variety of our results in Fig. 5.\nOur approach flexibly edits various different elements of the 3D objects, for instance replacing a “sword” of a skull warrior with a “viking axe,” resulting in coherent, seamless edits in both texture and geometry.\nOur edits also follow the structure of the input shape when applicable; for instance, when replacing a curvy fork with a worm, the worm maintains the same curved structure as the initial fork.\nWe can also insert new objects, such as a “pillow” or “sunglasses.” Our method even enables both replacement and addition at the same time as in “cat with a tail” example, replacing the chicken with a cat and simultaneously placing a tail at the back of the car. Given the same prompt, our method can generate different results with different seeds. In Fig. 6, we show generations of “cat” and “dog” samples with various seeds. The resulting shapes vary in their head, eye, and ear structures with different colors and sizes. We can further control the various aspects of the generated shape through user prompts. This is also shown in Fig. 6, where we adjust the mood and appearance of the generated shape. Comparison with Baselines.\nFig. 4 shows a qualitative comparison of our method against several state-of-the-art methods: Tailor3D [ref]31, MVEdit  and Vox-E [ref]36.\nOur approach shows significant improvements, in both editing quality as well as consistency with the original shape. Similar to our method, Vox-E allows controllable editing through merging but at the expense of an expensive SDS-based optimization that can tend towards more global changes than local ones. Since Tailor3D accepts edited front and back views as input, we ran their method using our multi-view editing results. Tab. 1 shows a comparison using GPTEval3D.\nWhile our method is consistently preferred, improvements are not as large since this metric does not measure consistency with the input. A method could globally change the shape and still achieve better results. This is because this metric does not take input shape into account and only considers edited output and the prompt. To complement this metric, we calculated the directional CLIP score and its few variants in Tab. 3; this considers consistency with the input, and demonstrates that our approach achieves significant improvements over the baselines. Perceptual Study. We prepare a perceptual study to compare our method with three other baselines asking users three different questions: “Select the one that follows the following prompt more closely”, “Select the one with better visual quality”, “Which example better preserves the parts that were not instructed to be edited with the prompt?”. There are 360 questions in total, each answered by 10 different participants, totaling 3600 responses. Results are presented in Tab. 2. In all questions, our method is preferred over the baselines. Runtime Analysis. Our method enables fast iteration, taking around 24 seconds to obtain initial multi-view editing results. Merging then takes another 50 seconds to produce a final refined shape.\nTab. 4 shows a comparison with baselines, using a single RTX 3090 for measurements, except for MVDream, which we run on RTX A6000.\nTailor3D [ref]31, concurrent to our work, also operates fast, taking 2 seconds for a forward pass using our multi-view editing results as input (26 seconds in total). MVEdit  does not employ any merging, performing editing in around 6 minutes. Since Vox-E [ref]36 involves a long SDS optimization process, its overall inference can take around an hour.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: where we adjust the mood and appearance of the generated shape.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
