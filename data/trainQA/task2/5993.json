On the basis of the maximising discounted cumulative reward, CMDP restricts policy under constraints. The CMDP   is defined as a tuple (𝒮,𝒜,ℛ,𝒞,𝒫,γ)𝒮𝒜ℛ𝒞𝒫𝛾(\\mathcal{S},\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{R},\\mathcal{C},\\mathcal{P},\\gamma), where 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} is the set of states, 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} is the set of actions, ℛ:𝒮×𝒜×𝒮↦ℝ:ℛmaps-to𝒮𝒜𝒮ℝ\\mathcal{R}:\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}\\times\\mathcal{S}\\mapsto\\mathbb{R} is the reward function. 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} is the cost function of a constraint with 𝒞:𝒮×𝒜×𝒮↦ℝ:𝒞maps-to𝒮𝒜𝒮ℝ\\mathcal{C}:\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}\\times\\mathcal{S}\\mapsto\\mathbb{R}. 𝒫:𝒮×𝒜×𝒮↦ :𝒫maps-to𝒮𝒜𝒮01\\mathcal{P}:\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}\\times\\mathcal{S}\\mapsto  is the transition probability function.\nγ𝛾\\gamma is the discount factor.\nA policy π:𝒮↦𝒫​(𝒜):𝜋maps-to𝒮𝒫𝒜\\pi:\\mathcal{S}\\mapsto\\mathcal{P}(\\mathcal{A}) is a mapping from states to a probability distribution over actions. π​(at|st)𝜋conditionalsubscript𝑎𝑡subscript𝑠𝑡\\pi(a_{t}|s_{t}) is the probability of taking action atsubscript𝑎𝑡a_{t} in state stsubscript𝑠𝑡s_{t} at time t𝑡t.\nUsually, a cumulative constraint 𝒞=g​(c​(s0,a0,s1),…,c​(st,at,st+1))𝒞𝑔𝑐subscript𝑠0subscript𝑎0subscript𝑠1…𝑐subscript𝑠𝑡subscript𝑎𝑡subscript𝑠𝑡1\\mathcal{C}=g(c(s_{0},a_{0},s_{1}),...,c(s_{t},a_{t},s_{t+1})) is restricted by a threshold ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon where c​(s,a,s′)𝑐𝑠𝑎superscript𝑠′c(s,a,s^{\\prime}) is a per-step penalty to constraint violation.\nJ𝒞πsubscriptsuperscript𝐽𝜋𝒞J^{\\pi}_{\\mathcal{C}} denotes the expectation of the cumulative constraint and is formulated as J𝒞π=𝔼τ∼π​[𝒞]subscriptsuperscript𝐽𝜋𝒞subscript𝔼similar-to𝜏𝜋delimited-[]𝒞J^{\\pi}_{\\mathcal{C}}=\\mathbb{E}_{\\tau\\sim\\pi}[\\mathcal{C}], where τ𝜏\\tau denotes a trajectory (s0,a0,s1,a1,…)subscript𝑠0subscript𝑎0subscript𝑠1subscript𝑎1…(s_{0},a_{0},s_{1},a_{1},\\dots) and τ∼πsimilar-to𝜏𝜋\\tau\\sim\\pi denotes trajectories sampled from π𝜋\\pi.\nThe goal of CMDP is to find a policy πθsubscript𝜋𝜃\\pi_{\\theta} that maximises the discounted cumulative reward subjecting to some constraints, formulated as : Several constrained reinforcement learning (CRL)  approaches have been proposed to handle constraints while maximising cumulative discounted rewards 2 .\nAugmenting the objective function in case of constraint violation is a commonly used category 3 [ref]6 4.\nThe reward shape  is a classic and easy-to-implement method for constrained optimisation. It shapes the reward function with a weighted penalty term.\nAn actor-critic algorithm using a Lagrange multiplier proposed by Borkar 3 can be regarded as a primal-dual type learning algorithm using different timescales. Tessler et al. [ref]6 proposed a multi-timescale approach, reward constrained policy optimisation (RCPO). Instead of using a constant value, the penalty coefficient is updated during learning in a slower time scale than policy gradient update [ref]6. Calian et al. 4 extended the Lagrange formulation to nested optimisation problems via meta-gradients. PID Lagrangian, presented by Stooke et al. 5, considers Lagrangian multiplier update as a dynamic control problem. This method 5 avoids oscillating cases when updating the multiplier with extra parameters. The interior-point policy optimisation (IPO) 6 augments the objective function by logarithmic barrier functions. It is assumed that policies must be feasible during initialisation . Another popular category of CRL approaches is the trust region method.\nConstrained policy optimisation (CPO) 7 searches constrained policy locally. The best-improved policy with constraint satisfaction is selected after updating with the approximated prediction of constraint violations. Different to CPO, projection-based constrained policy (PCPO) 8 uses two steps to optimise the constrained policy iteratively. PCPO first learns a reward-preferred policy locally, and then projects this policy back into the constrained region 8. Some of the aforementioned approaches rely on certain assumptions of the problem to be solved  or suffer from sample and calculation complexity 8, while RCPO is easy-to-implement and makes no assumption about the problems.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: approaches have been proposed to handle constraints while maximising cumulative discounted rewards 2 .\nAugmenting the objective function in case of constraint violation is a commonly used category 3 [ref]6 4.\nThe reward shape  is a classic and easy-to-implement method for constrained optimisation.
