      "content": "Paper Title: A Game-Theoretic Framework for Privacy-Aware Client Sampling in Federated Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the burgeoning development of machine learning (ML) techniques, the Internet of Things (IoT), and their networking applications, the exponential growth of data generated at edge devices presents vast potential for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and facilitates the applications in various fields  , such as facial recognition , disease diagnosis [ref]4 and embodied intelligence [ref]5. However, the performance of the conventional centralized machine learning (CML) paradigm is restricted by the limited wireless communication bandwidth for data transmission . Moreover, the heightened awareness of privacy protection and the enactment of stringent data privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA  poses a formidable challenge for distributed devices in accessing and sharing data. In tackling the challenges and safeguarding the confidential information of participants in ML systems, Federated Learning (FL) , served as an emergent and preeminent distributed machine learning (DML) paradigm for secure model training, has been proposed, which enables geographically dispersed clients to collaboratively refine a shared model orchestrated by a central server while keeping private data localized , achieving multi-fold performance benefits including privacy preservation and communication efficiency 0. To reduce the huge communication burden and coordinate geographically distributed mobile devices, a subset of participating clients are typically selected for FL model training with the uniform client sampling 1 . Recent research has demonstrated the effectiveness of the partial client participation approach in FL with a solid theoretical convergence foundation 2. In addition, given the diverse nature of heterogeneous data (typically amassed from distributed devices operating under varying mobile scenarios), there exists an inherent risk associated with the encompassed confidential information, such as personal health information and financial records, thereby elevating the potential for substantial privacy breaches 3. To address the significant privacy leakage associated with the gradient propagation scheme in FL systems 4, œÅùúå\\rho-zero-concentrated differential privacy (œÅùúå\\rho-zùëßzCDP) mechanism 5 has been widely adopted in recent literature 6 7, which mitigates private information leakage by introducing Gaussian distributed-based noise into local or global model parameters. However, uniformly random sampling of participating clients results in significant model bias during model aggregation. The randomly selected unrepresentative subsets may exacerbate variance introduced by client sampling, thereby slowing down the convergence rate and degrading model performance, which is particularly problematic in the general presence of system heterogeneity (e.g., artificial noise for privacy preservation) and statistical heterogeneity (i.e., Non-IID datasets) 1 8. Based on the œÅùúå\\rho-zùëßzCDP mechanism, the noise determined by heterogeneous and selfish clients further compromises uniform sampling due to the divergent noise magnitudes (according to the personalized privacy budgets). Consequently, there is a substantial probability of including clients with high noise magnitudes in each iteration, resulting in suboptimal model performance. Moreover, a prevailing and idealized assumption in most existing literature is that heterogeneous clients will participate in the FL systems unconditionally once invited by the central server. This assumption neglects significant factors such as computational consumption, communication resource burden, and the risk of severe information leakage during FL model training 9. Accordingly, without a well-designed economic incentivization, egocentric clients may be reluctant to contribute their local computation results (or computing facilities), given the potential privacy risks and significant training costs¬†. In a nutshell, the limitations of existing research stem from the failure to jointly consider the impact of inherent system heterogeneity on client sampling and the design of effective incentive mechanisms within the context of privacy-preserving FL. Specifically, clients should strategically modulate their privacy budgets to enhance their sampling probability and maximize long-term utilities. This insight drives us to investigate the following key questions. Key Question 1: How to design an effective client sampling strategy for the central server to tackle system heterogeneity and ensure optimal model performance? Key Question 2: How to incentivize heterogeneous clients with various privacy budgets to participate in FL training under dynamic privacy budget constraints? Key Question 3: How should the client decide the optimal strategy to dynamically adjust its privacy budget over time in the context of unknown strategies employed by other clients? Several challenges arise when addressing the above questions: (1) It is difficult to analytically quantify the convergence performance of privacy-preserving FL models based on the client sampling probabilities. (2) Modeling the interaction between the central server and clients is complicated and challenging within an uncertain environment. (3) The closed-form of the optimal strategy profile of both sides is obstructive to obtain due to the incomplete information and the dynamic constraints of the decision variable. In light of the discussions above, we proposed a novel framework FedPCS for the incentive mechanism design in FL with the privacy-aware client sampling probabilities, as shown in Fig. 1. The multi-fold contributions of our work are summarized as follows: A Game-Theoretic Formulation of the Privacy-aware Client Sampling: To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to jointly consider the time-depend client sampling and reward design in privacy-preserving FL models. We propose a novel framework, named FedPCS, which constructs the interaction between the central server and clients as a two-stage Stackelberg game. Through dynamically adjusting the subset of sampled clients over time, we theoretically obtain the central server‚Äôs optimal reward and client sampling strategy in Stage¬†I and the optimal correction factor of each client that dynamically adjusts its privacy budget in Stage¬†II. Subsequently, we rigorously demonstrate that the optimal strategy profile constitutes a Stackelberg Nash Equilibrium. Mean-Field Estimator for Decentralized Strategy Profile Design: Given the incomplete information resulting from the lack of local information exchange among clients during local model training, which complicates the determination of optimal decentralized client strategies, we introduce a mean-field estimator to evaluate the average privacy budget. Leveraging this estimator, we successfully derive the approximate optimal decentralized correction factor in closed-form. Moreover, through theoretical analysis, the existence of the fixed point for the mean-field estimator is proved. Efficiency Analysis of Clients‚Äô Strategies via PoA: To analyze the efficiency improvement of clients‚Äô strategies under our proposed privacy-aware sampling compared to random sampling, we utilize the PoA to measure the ratio between the social welfare achieved by the socially optimal strategy and that attained by these two methods. Our theoretical analysis illustrates that the random sampling policy (commonly employed in FL systems) is significantly affected by egocentric clients, resulting in PoA approaching infinity as the lower boundary of privacy budgets closes to 0. On the contrary, our proposed privacy-aware sampling scheme incentivizes egocentric clients to determine their privacy budgets prudently and successfully bounding PoA within a reachable context. Adaptive Optimal Client Sampling Ratio under Dynamic Privacy Constraints: Besides conducting FL training with a constant client sampling ratio, we further extend our model and analysis to more realistic scenarios, in which the privacy preservation demands of the FL systems vary in different stages of model training. In this extended scenario, the central server adaptively determines the optimal sampling ratio and reward allocated according to the dynamic privacy constraints, which makes the strategy analysis more complicated. Nonetheless, we successfully derive the closed-form optimal sampling ratio and reward. In addition, we conduct experiments to demonstrate the superiority of FedPCS under dynamic constraints. Convergence Analysis and Performance Assessment: We conduct rigorous analyses of the convergence upper bound of FedPCS with artificial noise and partial participant involvement, thus establishing a robust theoretical foundation. Further, we comprehensively assess the performance of our proposed framework on different real-world datasets (Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, SVHN, CIFAR-100, CINIC-10, and Tiny-ImageNet). Experimental results demonstrate that FedPCS outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of utilities and FL model performance. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We review the related work in Section¬†II and introduce the system model in Section¬†III. The optimal strategy profile and Stackelberg Nash Equilibrium are discussed in Sections¬†IV. The rigorous theoretical convergence analysis for our proposed framework FedPCS is presented in Section¬†V. In Section¬†VI, we analytically compare the two strategies via PoA analysis. Subsequently, we extend the system model and analysis to the dynamic privacy constraint scenario in Section¬†VII. Experimental results are conducted in Section¬†VIII and this paper is concluded in Section¬†IX.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: growth of data generated at edge devices presents vast potential for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and facilitates the applications in various fields  , such as facial recognition , disease diagnosis [ref]4 and embodied intelligence [ref]5.
