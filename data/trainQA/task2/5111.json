      "content": "Paper Title: Intelligent Computing: The Latest Advances, Challenges and Future\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nComputational materials (CM) have become a powerful means of studying materials‚Äô properties and designing new materials for several decades. Their applications, however, suffer from many challenges due to the complexity of materials and material behaviors, including lacking force fields and potentials for many atoms, ions, and atomic and ionic interactions, different thermodynamic phases in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and the huge search space for the optimization of material components and process parameters. AI integration into CM is shown to be a revolution to the traditional CM as a new research paradigm¬†. Intelligent CM is one major component of materials informatics¬† and is becoming increasingly popular. The number of relevant publications has reached 50 thousand on the Web of Science. About 70 percent were published in the past five years. The integration of AI and CM is exhibiting great success in multiple lengths and time scales and multiple physical field coupling calculations. The most famous electronic and atomic scale calculation method is first-principle calculations by applying the Density Functional Theory (DFT). The key issue in DFT calculations is the huge demands on computational powers due to the multiple particles and nonlinear interactions in the Schr√∂dinger equation for electronic structures. The Deep Neural Network might be an efficient way to accelerate the calculation process of the electronic Schr√∂dinger equation¬† . The approximations of exchange-correlation (XC) energy in DFT limit the accuracy of the Kahn-Sham DFT calculations. Kernel ridge regression and deep neural networks can create more accurate XC approximations¬† . ML-based XC approximations can even be applied in systems with strong correlations. By substituting time-consuming electronic structure calculations with empirical potentials, MD can simulate much larger systems with defects in different temperatures. ML can provide a systematic method to derive force fields or potentials from first-principle calculations. The ML-based force fields are called ML potentials. ML potentials consist of two parts: Data and ML potential model. During data collection, prior knowledge of the studied system plays a central role in the design of candidate structures which should be calculated using first-principle calculations. The design of descriptors for local structures is the heart of the ML potential model¬†. Several efficient ML potential packages have been published including Amp¬†, MLIP¬†, MLatom¬†, and DeepMD¬†. Xu et al. investigated Li-Si alloys using molecular dynamics based on a model that was built from DeepMD¬†. Various crystalline and amorphous Li-Si systems were analyzed for their structural and dynamic features. Their prediction was 20 times faster than ab initio molecular dynamics simulations with similar accuracy. This method can also be applied to insulating materials like liquid water. Grace et al. introduced a model for insulating materials and applied it on liquid water¬†. It shows that the Raman spectra associated with classical 2-nanosecond trajectories under a fixed temperature could be computed, and the resolution of low-frequency Raman spectra was enhanced. Li et al. applied DeepMD on the solid-state electrolyte Na3OBr¬†. The N‚Äãa+limit-fromùëÅùëéNa+ diffusion coefficients at finite temperature were obtained, suggesting the influence of temperature on the migration barrier. Their work also demonstrates the promising future of DeepMD in the study of transport properties of solid-state electrolytes. Recently, He et al. studied the structure phase transitions of SrTiO3 using DeepMD¬†. The temperature-driven phase transition characters under different in-plane strains were studied via the model build using DeepMD. Phase field simulations can illustrate the microstructure evolution over time at the continuum thermodynamic and kinetical levels. But they require huge computational powers. LSTM networks, as a famous algorithm of gated RNN, were successfully applied to train a model to predict results of a long time evolution from data collected from calculations over a very short time period¬†. In finite element calculations of materials, the key issue is constructing a constitutive model for specific materials in a given service environment. Many ML models are able to construct a constitutive model from data, for example, Gaussian processing¬†, Artificial Neural Networks¬†    [ref]277  and symbolic regressions¬† . Another application of ML in computational materials is to train an ML surrogate model, especially a simple analytic surrogate formula, which is used to substitute the original true physical model¬† [ref]282. Data are collected from several calculations of the physical model with different input parameters and applied in ML-model training. Usually, the ML surrogate model can be evaluated far faster than the original physical model, while both models have nearly the same accuracy. The several orders acceleration on computational speed allows for a global search in the design and optimization space. Typical ML algorithms that can be applied to train a multi-fidelity surrogate model include Kriging/Gaussian process¬†, LSTM Networks¬† , Physics-informed Neural Networks¬†, and CNNs¬†. For cases without available physical models, a surrogate model can be trained directly from experimental data to substitute a yet-unknown physical model. The situation is the most common in materials society, and the model is usually called the material microstructure-macroproperty relationship. Features or descriptors in machine learning of materials include electronic and atomic parameters, chemical composition, microstructural parameters, thermodynamic and kinetic parameters, processing conditions, service environment conditions, all material characterization conditions, optical and electron microscopy images, etc. The output of machine learning models can be either target properties or potential energy surfaces¬†. Depending on the studied problems, some parameters are features in some problems and become responses in other problems. Target properties include stability¬†, formability, bandgap¬†, Curie temperature, dielectric properties, flexoelectricity¬† and so on. Stability plays an imperative role in predicting new materials and the formation energy, which can be obtained from the first principles calculations. Li et al.¬† developed a transfer learning method to predict formation energy. After screening 21,316 perovskites, they found 764 stable perovskites with a tolerance factor of less than 4.8. Ninety-eight of them have already been proven stable by DFT calculation. Recently, Park et al. studied the stability of hybrid organic/inorganic compounds using a series of machine learning models and proved that the combination of advanced electronic structure theory and machine learning promotes designing new materials¬†. The bandgap is an important parameter in designing novel photovoltaic devices. The solar cell requires a bandgap that meets the wavelength of visible light. In 2018, Takahashi et al. predicted perovskite bandgap to search candidates for solar cells using machine learning¬†. They predicted 9,238 perovskite materials to have the desired bandgap, and 11 of them were undiscovered.\n\nReference markers found: [277]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]277: model for specific materials in a given service environment.
