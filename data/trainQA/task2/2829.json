      "content": "Paper Title: Avoiding Forgetting and Allowing Forward Transfer in Continual Learning via Sparse Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe divide CL methods into two categories: replay-free and replay-based. Replay-free In this category, past data is inaccessible during future learning. It includes two strategies:\n(1) Task-specific components. Specific components are assigned to each task. Current methods either extend the initially allocated capacity of a model for new tasks [ref]43  or use a fixed-capacity model and add a sparse sub-network for each task  [ref]29    [ref]48. Typically, connections of past tasks are kept fixed, and the newly added ones are updated to learn the current task. The criteria used for adding new connections often focus solely on avoiding forgetting, limiting the selective transfer of relevant knowledge to learn future tasks. Moreover, most methods rely on task labels to pick the connections corresponding to the task at inference. SpaceNet [ref]48 addressed component-agnostic inference by learning sparse representation during training and fixing a fraction of the most important neurons of each task to reduce interference. Sparse representations are learned by training each sparse sub-network using dynamic sparse training  , where weights and the sparse topology are jointly optimized. Yet, selective transfer and class ambiguity are not addressed.\n(2) Regularization-based. A fixed-capacity model is used, and all weights are updated for each task. Forgetting is addressed by constraining changes in the important weights of past tasks    or via distillation loss  . Replay-based In this category, forgetting is addressed by replaying: (1) a subset of old samples     , (2) pseudo-samples from a generative model 7  , or (3) generative high-level features 0. A buffer is used to store old samples or a generative model to generate them. Attention to task similarities and forward transfer has recently increased. Most efforts are devoted to task-IL. In , the analysis showed that higher layers are more prone to forgetting, and intermediate semantic similarity across tasks leads to maximal forgetting. SAM  meta-trains a self-attention mechanism for selective transfer in dense networks. CAT 8 addresses the relation between task similarities and forward/backward transfer in task-IL, where task labels are used to find similar knowledge in dense models. In , an expectation-maximization method was proposed to select the shared or added layers to promote transfer in task-IL. Similarly, 1 uses a modular neural network architecture and searches for the optimal path for a new task by the composition of neural modules. A task-driven method is used to reduce the exponential search space. In , the lottery ticket hypothesis 1 is studied for CL.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: It includes two strategies:\n(1) Task-specific components.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
