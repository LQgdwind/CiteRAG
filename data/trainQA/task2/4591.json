      "content": "Paper Title: Design Automation for Fast, Lightweight, and Effective Deep Learning Models: A Survey\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe most intuitive and easiest search algorithm is the grid search, which exhaustively explores the search space and evaluates every possible architecture. This approach works well for a small space  but is terribly inefficient for a large space due to the exponentially increased number of evaluations. Another problem with this type of method is that it only supports a bounded and discrete space and needs careful selection of the grid interval. Random search , on the other hand, samples neural architectures randomly from the search space. It can be used not only for a discrete space but also for a continuous space with a predefined distribution. This algorithm is superior to the grid search also when the search dimensions (e.g., kernel sizes, expansion ratios, and network depths) have different effects on the final performance. Random search and its simple variants are usually used when the performance of a candidate model is easy to obtain  . Advanced search algorithms, like reinforcement learning and evolutionary search, are widely demonstrated better performance than random search  [ref]105 . In the following, we summarize the advanced search algorithms,\nincluding Bayesian optimization, evolutionary search, reinforcement learning, and differentiable methods, regarding design automation for efficient deep learning models. Bayesian Optimization (BayesOpt) is an important approach for automated hyperparameter tuning and architecture search. Given a search space ùïäùïä\\mathbb{S} that contains a large set of neural architectures, and a black-box objective function f‚Äã(‚ãÖ)ùëì‚ãÖf(\\cdot) from an neural architecture to an evaluation metric (e.g., accuracy), the goal of BayesOpt is to find an architecture a‚ààùïäùëéùïäa\\in\\mathbb{S} that maximizes f‚Äã(a)ùëìaf(\\textbf{a}): a‚àó=argmaxa‚ààùïäf‚Äã(a)superscripta‚àósubscriptargmaxaùïäùëìa\\textbf{a}^{\\ast}=\\operatorname*{argmax}_{\\textbf{a}\\in\\mathbb{S}}f(\\textbf{a}). However, it is expensive to achieve f‚Äã(a)ùëìaf(\\textbf{a}) because it requires fully training the architecture a from scratch. Therefore, a statistical model, which is invariably a Gaussian process (GP), is used as a surrogate model. The more neural architectures (i.e., points of f‚Äã(‚ãÖ)ùëì‚ãÖf(\\cdot)) are evaluated, the less uncertainty the surrogate model has. Another important component of BayesOpt is the acquisition function for deciding which architectures are sampled and then evaluated at each iteration, which is often expected improvement (EI): where a is a sampling architecture and f‚Äã(a+)ùëìsuperscriptaf(\\textbf{a}^{+}) is the evaluation metric of the best architecture a+superscripta\\textbf{a}^{+} so far, that is until tùë°t-th exploration.\nThe general process of BayesOpt is shown in Fig. 4a, where multiple architectures are first randomly sampled from the efficient search space; the sampled architectures are then trained and evaluated for updating a GP model; the acquisition function is computed based on the updated GP model to decide which neural architectures should be sampled next; the process proceeds iteratively until certain conditions are met. The best architecture among all sampled architectures is usually output as the final model. When additionally considering the hardware constraints, Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) is commonly used    , where GP is fitted for each objective independently, and Pareto-frontier is identified as the set of optimal trade-off solutions of the multiple objectives. Different MOBO approaches mainly differ in how to achieve the Pareto-frontier during the acquisition process. For example, Parsa et al.  use a Gaussian distribution to estimate the Pareto-frontier function; Eriksson et al.  use the Noisy Expected Hypervolume Improvement (NEHVI) acquisition function, which is a noise-tolerant and extended version of EI for the multi-objective setting, to sample intermediate Pareto-frontiers.\nAlthough BayesOpt has shown promising performance, especially in hyperparameter optimization, it is computationally expensive and struggling when handling a high-dimensional search space and multiple objectives  . Evolutionary Search (ES) is a long-thriving NAS approach, which is based on the concept of biological evolution. It manages to find an optimal solution by iteratively improving upon a population of candidate solutions according to a fitness function. As illustrated in Fig. 4b (the schematic of the basic ES process), a population of candidate networks is first initialized by randomly sampled from the efficient search space; then evolutionary operations, such as crossover (combination of two parents) and mutation (arbitrarily mutating operators with new ones from the search space), are applied to current population to generate next generation; lastly, all offsprings need to be tested against a fitness function, which is to select the most powerful candidate networks and update the population; the process proceeds repeatedly until stopping criteria are met. The best network in the last population is the final achieved model. The major benefit of evolutionary search is its flexibility in directly controlling the offspring generation process and population updating process [ref]105. The hardware constraints are usually considered in the fitness function of ES in two ways: hard-constraint and soft-constraint, which we will present concretely in the flowing section III-B2. Thus, most studies directly use existing evolutionary algorithms with customised fitness function to incorporate hardware constraints       [ref]105 . For example, FBNetV3  uses the adaptive genetic algorithms  to realize adaptive probabilities of crossover and mutation, and customizes the fitness function with its proposed accuracy predictor and hard hardware constraints; OFA  adopts the regularized evolutionary search , which introduces an age property to favor younger generation during search; DONNA , FairNAS , and MOGA  appeal to the famous NSGA-\\@slowromancapii@ , which is a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, to find the Pareto-optimal solution instead of the solution under hard constraints in previous studies. In contrast to directly using off-the-shelf ES algorithms, some researchers develop ES algorithms specific to the hardware efficient application   . LEMONADE  is such a representative work, which handles various objectives differently considering that different objectives have different evaluation costs. Specifically, the efficiency objective (e.g., FLOPs) is cheap to evaluate while the accuracy objective is much more expensive as it requires fully training the model at each iteration. The authors propose to first select the architectures that fulfil the Pareto front for the cheap objectives and then only train and evaluate these networks. As traditional ES can only sample a limited amount of networks that satisfy hardware constraints, Scheidegger et al.  use ES algorithms to search sampling laws that can better cover the sub search space under specific constraints. Thus, better Pareto frontiers can be achieved. NSAG-Net  designs an additional exploitation step after the traditional evolutionary operating to learn and leverage the history of evaluated populations. Since the evaluated populations at each iteration rank relatively high regarding the fitness score, it is quite possible that the optimal model has similarities to the evaluated populations and thus extracting common patterns from the evaluated populations can accelerate convergence.\nAlthough the above studies manage to lighten the search process from the algorithm perspective, it is still costly due to the requirement of training each network of the new generation at each interaction. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved notable success and grabbed great attention in the NAS community since Zoph and Le‚Äôs work in 2017 [ref]52. The general framework of RL for NAS is illustrated in Fig. 4c: the controller, usually an RNN network, is the core component, which generates actions to sample operators or hyperparameters from the efficient search space; a neural network will then be constructed using the sampled options and trained and evaluated to achieve a reward, which will be used to update the controller using a policy gradient method . This process will be performed repeatedly until stopping criteria are met. The hardware information is often considered in the RL reward function. Some studies thus directly use the existing RL-based NAS approach [ref]52, but optimize with a customized reward function  . Furthermore, most recent work mainly follows the advanced RL search algorithms in two representative studies, MnasNet [ref]48 and TuNAS . Specifically,   follow MnasNet, and   follow TuNAS. Similar to [ref]52, MnasNet [ref]48 also uses RNN as the controller while maximizing the expected reward using an advanced policy gradient method, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) , to alleviate the high gradient variance of the vanilla policy gradient method. TuNAS is based on ENAS  and ProxylessNAS . It improves with warmup and channel masking techniques for better search robustness and scalability. Instead of building one candidate network at each training step, TuNAS encompasses all candidate networks into a supernet. Each path of the supernet represents a candidate network. In addition, TuNAS is not a sequential decision-making process and does not rely on an RNN controller; alternatively, it uses learnable probability distribution that spans over architectural choices as the RL controller. At each step, a candidate network is sampled from the distribution, and then the portion of the supernet correlated with the sampled network is trained; a reward is calculated with the sampled network to update the probability distribution i.e., the RL controller. Differentiable Search is the most recently developed search paradigm that finds an optimal network by gradient descent . As shown in Figure 4d, a network is as a directed acyclic graph consisting of an ordered sequence of NùëÅN nodes (N=4ùëÅ4N=4 in Figure 4d: X0,X1,X2,X3subscriptùëã0subscriptùëã1subscriptùëã2subscriptùëã3X_{0},X_{1},X_{2},X_{3}). Each node XisubscriptùëãùëñX_{i} is a latent representation and each directed edge represents a candidate operator OisubscriptùëÇùëñO_{i} that is applied to XisubscriptùëãùëñX_{i}. For example, in Figure 4d, there are three candidate operators (i.e., O1subscriptùëÇ1O_{1}, O2subscriptùëÇ2O_{2}, and O3subscriptùëÇ3O_{3}) between node X0subscriptùëã0X_{0} and X3subscriptùëã3X_{3}. In this way, the search process is formulated as an optimal path-finding problem. All outputs of the candidate operators from a node‚Äôs predecessors are summed with weights Œ±isubscriptùõºùëñ\\alpha_{i} to achieve the node representation: Xj=‚àëi=1mŒ±i‚ÄãOi‚Äã(Xi)subscriptùëãùëósuperscriptsubscriptùëñ1ùëösubscriptùõºùëñsubscriptùëÇùëñsubscriptùëãùëñX_{j}=\\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\alpha_{i}O_{i}(X_{i}), subject to Œ±i‚â•0,‚àëi=1mŒ±i=1formulae-sequencesubscriptùõºùëñ0superscriptsubscriptùëñ1ùëösubscriptùõºùëñ1\\alpha_{i}\\geq 0,\\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\alpha_{i}=1. In Figure 4d, edges with darker colours indicate larger weights. The weights Œ±isubscriptùõºùëñ\\alpha_{i} can be represented with a softmax function of architectural parameters Œ≤isubscriptùõΩùëñ\\beta_{i}: Œ±i=e‚Äãx‚Äãp‚Äã(Œ≤i)‚àëi=1me‚Äãx‚Äãp‚Äã(Œ≤i)subscriptùõºùëñùëíùë•ùëùsubscriptùõΩùëñsuperscriptsubscriptùëñ1ùëöùëíùë•ùëùsubscriptùõΩùëñ\\alpha_{i}=\\frac{exp(\\beta_{i})}{\\sum_{i=1}^{m}exp(\\beta_{i})}. The network weights (wùë§w) and architectural parameters (Œ≤isubscriptùõΩùëñ\\beta_{i}) are trained alternatively with training data and validation data, respectively. This induces a bi-level optimization problem : Therefore, unlike ES and RL, a differentiable search unifies model training and search into a joint procedure. As the whole network contains multiple parallel operators in each layer, it is called a supernet, and its subnet with one operator in each layer is a candidate network. The candidate operator with the highest associated weight is chosen to construct the final model. The training of the supernet is also the search process. The hardware information can be considered in the loss function and optimized when training the architectural parameters. Various differentiable search algorithms are proposed to achieve better search efficiency and performance      . FBNetV1  replaces the softmax function with the Gumbel softmax function  to better represents the subnet sampling process, and thus reduce the performance gap between the supernet and subnet. HR-NAS  progressively discards the paths with low path weights during the search to increase the search efficiency. DenseNAS  splits the search procedure into two stages: the first stage optimizes the model weights only for enough epochs and the second stage alternatively optimizes the model weights and architectural parameters. This strategy alleviates the bias of fast convergence operators. Considering the small size of the search space of the conventional differentiable search due to its requirement of loading the whole supernet into memory, many studies propose novel differentiable search algorithms to reduce the memory footprint    . ProxylessNAS  proposes to factorize the task of training of all paths into training two sampled paths, which have the highest sampling probabilities, and discard the other paths temporarily at each iteration. The architectural parameters of the two selected paths are updated during training and then rescaled after training to keep the path weights of unsampled paths unchanged. In this way, the memory requirement is decreased to the level of training two subnets. Different from previous papers, which use multi-path supernets and thereby have memory issues, Single-Path NAS  and FBNetV2  develop masking mechanisms that train a supernet with the largest hyperparameters (e.g., 7√ó7777\\times 7 kernel) and a mask/indicator function that determines whether to just use a small part (e.g., 5√ó5555\\times 5 or 3√ó3333\\times 3 kernel) of the largest hyperparameters. Other types of search algorithms are also reported  . Xiong et al.  propose a modified Cost-Effective Greedy algorithm for the submodular NAS process, where starting from an empty network, each block is filled iteratively with the highest marginal gain ratio regarding both accuracy and cost. DPP-Net  follows the progressive search algorithm in  to find the optimal operator layer by layer. Different from searching for a new model for each new resource budget, another way is to build a baseline model first and then scale it to obtain a family of models for various budgets  . Specifically, they adopt the conventional RL-based hardware-aware search algorithm [ref]48 to search for a small baseline model, and use a simple grid search to determine the best scaling coefficient (i.e., Œ±ùõº\\alpha, Œ≤ùõΩ\\beta, Œ≥ùõæ\\gamma) for network depth, width, and input size. A family of specialized models for different budgets can be obtained by scaling up the baseline model by Œ±NsuperscriptùõºùëÅ\\alpha^{N}, Œ≤NsuperscriptùõΩùëÅ\\beta^{N}, and Œ≥NsuperscriptùõæùëÅ\\gamma^{N} with 2Nsuperscript2ùëÅ2^{N} times increased resource.\n\nReference markers found: [105]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]105: performance of a candidate model is easy to obtain  .
