      "content": "Paper Title: PIMMiner: A High-performance PIM Architecture-aware Graph Mining Framework\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph datasets.\nWe use the graph datasets in Table¬†III for evaluation.\nThese datasets are used for most GPMI systems, such as Arabesque¬†, RStream¬†, AutoMine¬†,\nGramer¬†,\nGraphPi¬† and\nFlexMiner¬†.\nBefore execution, we sort the vertices based on their degree from largest to smallest (the id of the vertex with the highest degree is 0). GPMI applications.\nWe evaluate the following GPMI applications: 3-size motif counting (3-MC), 3 to 5-size clique counting (3-CC, 4-CC, 5-CC), 4-size diamond (4-DI), and cycle(4-CL) patterns. These patterns are described in Figure¬†1 and are commonly used in other GPMI systems¬†  . Compared GPMI software systems.\nGraphPi¬† is a graph mining system on CPUs.\nGraphPi is aimed at complex patterns, it determines the order of each vertex of the pattern according to the characteristics of the graph and the pattern.\nWe run GraphPi with the source code¬†[ref]29 using 96 threads.\nAutoMine¬† is a widely-used pattern-enumeration method, and our GPMI algorithm is based on this method. We requested the code of Automine from the author. When running the original Automine code, we found that Automine uses multiple function calls for the generality, which greatly reduces the performance, and the load is\nextremely imbalanced when multi-threaded. So, we rewrote the code using the order of each vertex of the pattern in GraphPi 222https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Optimized-AutoMine/README.md, and use it for PIM acceleration.\nWe show the runtime of original(ORG) and optimized(OPT) Automine in the evaluation section.\nThe results in Table I are also run with optimized(OPT) AutoMine. Compared GPMI acceleration architectures.\nDIMMining  and NDMiner  are two recent PIM/NDP architectures designed for accelerating GPMI applications.\nThe results show that the performance of DIMMining and NDMiner is higher than the previous accelerators , so we aim to use these two designs as the baselines of GPMI accelerators.\nFor DIMMining, we use the numerical values reported in , and we also requested the execution time of NDMiner from its authors.\nTo ensure the fairness of the experimental results, we scaled their results to the peak performance of 1024 Gflops, which is the same as our PIMMiner. System and architecture configurations.\nFor AutoMine and GraphPi, we run the experiments on a real system with Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6240R 2.4GHz Processor (total 48 physical cores, 96 hyperthreads) with 36MB LLC and 192GB 3.2GHz DDR4 memory.\nAccording to Intel‚Äôs official documentation, the peak of this processor is 1152 Gflops, which is very close to the 1024 Glops of PIMMiner architecture.\nFor PIMMiner, we use ZSim¬† with Ramulator¬† to simulate HBM-PIM systems.\nWe modify Zsim to generate traces for PIM when executing the nest_for_loop function.\nWe also modify Ramulator to support 128 PIM cores (following Samsung HBM-PIM parameters ) with L1i and L1d caches. All caches use the LRU policy.\nThe memory access latency in 3D-stack DRAM is obtained from .\nTable¬†IV shows the detailed configurations of our simulated system.\nWe set the overhead of workload stealing to 2 times of remote memory access latency (2√ó140=28021402802\\times 140=280 memory cycles).\nDue to the long execution time of the cycle-accurate simulator, for larger graphs (MI, YT, PA, and LJ), we sample the vertices v0subscriptùë£0v_{0} in the first level during trace generation. The sample ratio is set so that each simulation can finish within ten hours. Other works using cycle-accurate simulation also adopt the similar sampling methodology .\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: CPUs.\nGraphPi is aimed at complex patterns, it determines the order of each vertex of the pattern according to the characteristics of the graph and the pattern.\nWe run GraphPi with the source code¬†[ref]29 using 96 threads.\nAutoMine¬† is a widely-used pattern-enumeration method, and our GPMI algorithm is based on this method.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
