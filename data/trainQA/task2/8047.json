      "content": "Paper Title: Deterministic approximate counting of colorings with fewer than 2⁢Δ colors via absence of zeros\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLet q>0𝑞0q>0 be an integer, let G=(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G=(V,E) be a graph, let S⊂V𝑆𝑉S\\subset V and let ϕ:S→[q]:={1,…,q}:italic-ϕ→𝑆delimited-[]𝑞assign1…𝑞\\phi:S\\to[q]:=\\{1,\\ldots,q\\}.\nWe call the triple (G,S,ϕ)𝐺𝑆italic-ϕ(G,S,\\phi) a partially q𝑞q-colored graph.\nOften we will just say that G𝐺G is a partially q𝑞q-colored graph, omitting the reference to S𝑆S and ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi.\nA vertex v∈S𝑣𝑆v\\in S will be called pinned; any vertex not contained in S𝑆S will be called a free vertex.\nWe say that a color j∈[q]𝑗delimited-[]𝑞j\\in[q] is blocked at v𝑣v for a vertex v∈V𝑣𝑉v\\in V if either v𝑣v is pinned, or if v𝑣v has a neighbor in S𝑆S which is assigned the color j𝑗j by ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi, otherwise color j𝑗j is called free at v𝑣v. The partition function of the Potts model of a partially q𝑞q-colored graph G=(G,S,ϕ)𝐺𝐺𝑆italic-ϕG=(G,S,\\phi) is defined as Note that we remove the q𝑞q from the argument of ZGsubscript𝑍𝐺Z_{G} compared to (1) since q𝑞q is already implicit in G𝐺G. Given a partially q𝑞q-colored graph (G,S,ϕ)𝐺𝑆italic-ϕ(G,S,\\phi),\nwe can always assume that each pinned vertex v∈S𝑣𝑆v\\in S is a leaf of G𝐺G (i.e. has degree 111) without changing the partition function, by iteratively replacing each pinned vertex v𝑣v by d=deg⁡(v)𝑑degree𝑣d=\\deg(v) copies of it, v1,…,vdsubscript𝑣1…subscript𝑣𝑑v_{1},\\ldots,v_{d}, connecting each of them to a unique neighbor of v𝑣v.\nWe denote by 𝒢Δ,q∙superscriptsubscript𝒢Δ𝑞∙\\mathcal{G}_{\\Delta,q}^{\\bullet} the set of pairs (G,v)𝐺𝑣(G,v), where G𝐺G is a connected partially q𝑞q-colored graph of maximum degree ΔΔ\\Delta and v𝑣v is a free vertex of G𝐺G and where the pinned vertices of G𝐺G are all leaves and form an independent set.\nFor such a pair let us define the vector 𝐜G,v∈ℕ≥0qsubscript𝐜𝐺𝑣superscriptsubscriptℕabsent0𝑞{\\bf c}_{G,v}\\in\\mathbb{N}_{\\geq 0}^{q}, where the i𝑖ith coordinate, cG,v;isubscript𝑐𝐺𝑣𝑖c_{G,v;i}, denotes the number of pinned neighbors of v𝑣v that are colored with color i𝑖i. We refer to 𝐜G,vsubscript𝐜𝐺𝑣{\\bf c}_{G,v} as the vector of blocked colors at v𝑣v.\nAs a convention, we will write vectors in boldface, while entries of vectors are denoted in plain typeface. If w≥0𝑤0w\\geq 0 and if ZG​(w)≠0subscript𝑍𝐺𝑤0Z_{G}(w)\\neq 0 there is an associated probability measure, ℙG,wsubscriptℙ𝐺𝑤\\mathbb{P}_{G,w}, on the collection of all colorings ψ:V→[q]:𝜓→𝑉delimited-[]𝑞\\psi:V\\to[q] that coincide with ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi on S𝑆S, whose probability mass function is defined by We will use capital letters to denote random variables. In particular, we denote the probability that vertex v𝑣v is assigned color j𝑗j when sampling a coloring from this distribution by ℙG,w​[Φ​(v)=j]subscriptℙ𝐺𝑤delimited-[]Φ𝑣𝑗\\mathbb{P}_{G,w}[\\Phi(v)=j].\nWhen w𝑤w is clear from the context, we often simply write ℙGsubscriptℙ𝐺\\mathbb{P}_{G} instead of ℙG,wsubscriptℙ𝐺𝑤\\mathbb{P}_{G,w}. For w∈ℂ𝑤ℂw\\in\\mathbb{C} and a free vertex v𝑣v of a partially q𝑞q-colored graph G𝐺G we consider the ratio as a rational function in w𝑤w. Here ZG,vj​(w)subscriptsuperscript𝑍𝑗𝐺𝑣𝑤Z^{j}_{G,v}(w) denotes the sum (2) restricted to those ψ𝜓\\psi that assign color j𝑗j to the vertex v𝑣v. Note that R~G,v;i,j​(w)subscript~𝑅𝐺𝑣𝑖𝑗𝑤\\tilde{R}_{G,v;i,j}(w) only depends on the connected component of G𝐺G that contains v𝑣v. To prove that ZG​(w)≠0subscript𝑍𝐺𝑤0Z_{G}(w)\\neq 0 for some w∈ℂ𝑤ℂw\\in\\mathbb{C} and a partially q𝑞q-colored graph, it suffices to inductively show that ZG,vj​(w)≠0subscriptsuperscript𝑍𝑗𝐺𝑣𝑤0Z^{j}_{G,v}(w)\\neq 0 for some color j∈[q]𝑗delimited-[]𝑞j\\in[q] and that the ratios R~G,v;i,j​(w)subscript~𝑅𝐺𝑣𝑖𝑗𝑤\\tilde{R}_{G,v;i,j}(w) (i∈[q]𝑖delimited-[]𝑞i\\in[q]) pairwise make a small angle.\nIn  this is done via a direct recursive approach, by showing that these ratios are trapped in a certain set in the complex plane.\nIn [ref]27 this is done via a clever indirect approach by showing that for fixed w∈ 𝑤01w\\in  and w~~𝑤\\tilde{w} close enough to w𝑤w, we have that the perturbed ratios R~G,v;i,j​(w~)subscript~𝑅𝐺𝑣𝑖𝑗~𝑤\\tilde{R}_{G,v;i,j}(\\tilde{w}) are close to the original ratios R~G,v;i,j​(w)subscript~𝑅𝐺𝑣𝑖𝑗𝑤\\tilde{R}_{G,v;i,j}(w) and in particular lie close to the real axis and hence make a pairwise small angle.\nThis is also the approach we follow in the present paper.\nTo do so, we will change coordinates and work with log-ratios. Define under the implicit assumption that ZG,vi​(w~)superscriptsubscript𝑍𝐺𝑣𝑖~𝑤Z_{G,v}^{i}(\\tilde{w}) and ZG,vj​(w~)superscriptsubscript𝑍𝐺𝑣𝑗~𝑤Z_{G,v}^{j}(\\tilde{w}) are both not equal to 00 and where we fix the branch of the logarithm that is real valued on the positive real line. For (G,v)∈𝒢Δ,q∙𝐺𝑣subscriptsuperscript𝒢∙Δ𝑞(G,v)\\in\\mathcal{G}^{\\bullet}_{\\Delta,q} we denote by (G¯,v)∈𝒢Δ,q∙¯𝐺𝑣subscriptsuperscript𝒢∙Δ𝑞(\\overline{G},v)\\in\\mathcal{G}^{\\bullet}_{\\Delta,q} the rooted partially q𝑞q-colored graph obtained from (G,v)𝐺𝑣(G,v) by removing all pinned neighbors of v𝑣v from G𝐺G.\nWe often just write G¯¯𝐺\\overline{G} in case v𝑣v is clear from the context.\nThe free degree of a vertex is the number of free neighbors of that vertex.\nWe next state an expanded version of our main theorem. There exists a constant η≥0.002𝜂0.002\\eta\\geq 0.002 such that for all integers Δ≥3Δ3\\Delta\\geq 3, q≥(2−η)​Δ𝑞2𝜂Δq\\geq(2-\\eta)\\Delta there exist ε1>0subscript𝜀10\\varepsilon_{1}>0 and ε2>0subscript𝜀20\\varepsilon_{2}>0, such that if (G,v)∈𝒢Δ,q∙𝐺𝑣subscriptsuperscript𝒢∙Δ𝑞(G,v)\\in\\mathcal{G}^{\\bullet}_{\\Delta,q} where v𝑣v has free degree at most Δ−1Δ1\\Delta-1, then for any colors i,j∈[q]𝑖𝑗delimited-[]𝑞i,j\\in[q], any w∈ 𝑤01w\\in  and any w~∈B​(w,ε1)~𝑤𝐵𝑤subscript𝜀1\\tilde{w}\\in B(w,\\varepsilon_{1}), It follows from our proof that we can take ε1≥C​Δ−4subscript𝜀1𝐶superscriptΔ4\\varepsilon_{1}\\geq C\\Delta^{-4} for some constant C>0𝐶0C>0.\nFor η=0𝜂0\\eta=0 this improves on the size of the zero-free region given by Liu, Sinclair and Srivastava [ref]27 who proved a zero-free region around  01  of width C′​Δ−16superscript𝐶′superscriptΔ16C^{\\prime}\\Delta^{-16} for some constant C′>0superscript𝐶′0C^{\\prime}>0. Below, we give an outline of our proof of this result; the actual proof can be found in Section 7.\nFirst, we use it to deduce Theorem 1. Let ε1subscript𝜀1\\varepsilon_{1} be as in the statement of Theorem 2, fix w∈ 𝑤01w\\in  and let w~∈B​(w,ε1)~𝑤𝐵𝑤subscript𝜀1\\tilde{w}\\in B(w,\\varepsilon_{1}).\nBy Theorem 2, it suffices to prove that ZG​(q;w~)≠0subscript𝑍𝐺𝑞~𝑤0Z_{G}(q;\\tilde{w})\\neq 0 if G𝐺G is ΔΔ\\Delta-regular.\nTo cover the case where all the vertices of G𝐺G have degree exactly ΔΔ\\Delta, and hence are not pinned, we will use the symmetry of the model between the colors.\nWe may further assume that G𝐺G is connected since the partition function factors over connected components. First we claim that the partition function ZG,v1​(q;w~)superscriptsubscript𝑍𝐺𝑣1𝑞~𝑤Z_{G,v}^{1}(q;\\tilde{w}) is non-zero.\nIndeed, ZG,v1​(q;w~)superscriptsubscript𝑍𝐺𝑣1𝑞~𝑤Z_{G,v}^{1}(q;\\tilde{w}) is equal to the partition function of the partially q𝑞q-colored graph H𝐻H obtained from G𝐺G by replacing v𝑣v with vertices v1,…,vΔsubscript𝑣1…subscript𝑣Δv_{1},\\dots,v_{\\Delta} each of them colored with color 111 and where each visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i} is connected to a unique neighbor of v𝑣v in G𝐺G.\nWe next claim that ZH​(w~)≠0subscript𝑍𝐻~𝑤0Z_{H}(\\tilde{w})\\neq 0. Since each component of H𝐻H has a vertex of free degree Δ−1Δ1\\Delta-1, namely a neighbor of some visubscript𝑣𝑖v_{i}, and since by construction we have that the pinned vertices of H𝐻H form an independent set and are all leaves, by Theorem 2 we indeed have ZH​(w~)≠0subscript𝑍𝐻~𝑤0Z_{H}(\\tilde{w})\\neq 0 (because the partition function is multiplicative over the components of H𝐻H). Now, since each vertex in G𝐺G is free, it follows by symmetry that Therefore, ∎\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: (i∈[q]𝑖delimited-[]𝑞i\\in[q]) pairwise make a small angle.\nIn  this is done via a direct recursive approach, by showing that these ratios are trapped in a certain set in the complex plane.\nIn [ref]27 this is done via a clever indirect approach by showing that for fixed w∈ 𝑤01w\\in  and w~~𝑤\\tilde{w} close enough to w𝑤w, we have that the perturbed ratios\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
