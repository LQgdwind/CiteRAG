      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Improving Exploration in Self-Imitation Learning using Intrinsic Motivation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section we briefly review the literature related to IL and self-IL (Section II.a), IM (Section II.b) and IL+IM approaches (Section II.c) to deal with sparse reward problems from a sample-efficient perspective. The experience replay buffers have been employed to stabilize the learning process when using neural network in Reinforcement Learning . Instead of just focusing on the whole history of experiences, different works have proposed to prioritize those samples based on the TD-error 7 or high extrinsic trajectories 8. The goal is to sample the most promising experiences more frequently, potentially expediting and enhancing the overall knowledge learned by the agent. Following the idea of improving the sample efficiency, IL methods have resorted to expert demonstrations to accelerate the learning stage process, by forcing the agent to learn the inherent decision making hidden in those examples 9 . However, collecting expert demonstrations is not easy to achieve and most of the time the agent is fed with suboptimal demonstrations that hinder the learning of an optimal policy  . When lacking an expert capable of providing examples, self-IL was proposed so that an agent, without any kind of prior knowledge, is responsible for collecting and imitating good experiences improvised in the past  1 . Interestingly, self-IL approaches aim to deal with exploration-exploitation dilemma by encouraging the agent to exploit the information that has not been previously learned, so as to achieve a better exploration strategy and ultimately, a near-optimal performance. Despite their proven efficiency at hard exploration problems 1  [ref]26, these methods tend to struggle in tasks characterized by very sparse rewards due to their reduced capability to find good trajectories early in the learning process by just naive exploration . This can be the reason why self-IL solutions have so far been evaluated mainly over non-procedurally-generated environments, where the generalization capabilities of the agent are not tested since the observationâ€™s features do not change from level to level  [ref]26. Alternatively, new approaches like RAPID 6 have emerged to deal with procedurally-generated environments by ranking the episodes not only in terms of their extrinsic rewards, but also by considering exploration scores related to the level. As a result of this multi-criteria ranking, the agent can imitate those experiences and overcome the exploration needs of very sparse tasks, as opposed to other approaches that prioritize episodes based just on their achieved extrinsic reward 1. Another research direction to enhance the exploration of the agent and thereby achieve a good overall performance for a given task is to use IM mechanisms. Some of the IM methods were not originally designed to tackle procedurally-generated environments, such as Counts , Random Network Distillation (RND ), or Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM ). Lately new approaches have emerged with the aim to learn more robust and generalized knowledge: this is the case of BeBold/NoveId [ref]31, MADE , RIDE  or AGAC . One of the common aspects to all these methods is that the generated rewards are commonly used with on-policy algorithms (i.e., A2C/A3C, PPO, IMPALA), which discard the collected experiences after their respective optimization updates. This hinders a good sample efficiency, even more so when considering disentanglement/derailment [ref]26 and catastrophic forgetting due to the fades of intrinsic rewards . The idea of combining IL and IM strategies is not new. Previous works have analyzed if they are complementary to each other. However, most of them have been studied at singleton environments where the generalization capabilities have not been assessed. SIL 1 used a count-based intrinsic reward to augment the exploration capabilities in singleton Apple-Gold mazes. Similarly, DTSIL  employed the same environment and evaluated its generalization ability by training over 12 random mazes and by evaluating the trained agent over 6 test instances. However, it requires a hierarchical policy where they do not use any kind of IM technique: they only combine DTSIL and IM to evaluate the exploration improvements over some Atariâ€™s (non procedurally-generated) environments. The approach presented in 2 was tested in Atariâ€™s Montezuma, Solaris and Venture environments, in which different prioritizing strategies were studied with prioritized experience replay and IM methods. Recently, 3 evaluated its solution with SIL and BeBold in relatively easy sparse MiniGrid environments. Nevertheless, neither 3 nor 6 address hard exploration environments as in other works related to IM [ref]31 . At this point, we note that by hard exploration we refer to different configurations of the environments that make them more difficult to be solved. For instance, using more rooms in Multiroom; larger room size in KeyCorridor; or facing ObstructedMaze. In these tasks the generalization and learning requirements are of utmost importance and call for better exploration strategies during the agentâ€™s learning process. We formally propose the use of a self-IL strategy together with IM, showing that this combination succeeds at solving hard exploration environments. Our proposal builds upon RAPID 6, in which we combine its ranking strategy for past stored episodes with intrinsic motivation mechanisms. This manuscript steps beyond the state of the art by showing that previous approaches did not consider 3 or failed to solve 6 procedurally-generated environments with hard exploration requirements (see Section IV). Our experiments in scenarios with different learning challenges validate this claim and prove that the combination of RAPID and IM methods can meet the exploration requirements needed to solve hard exploration tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: that has not been previously learned, so as to achieve a better exploration strategy and ultimately, a near-optimal performance.
