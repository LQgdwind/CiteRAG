      "content": "Paper Title: BGT-Net: Bidirectional GRU Transformer Network for Scene Graph Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVisual Genome dataset  is the most frequently used dataset for the SGG task. We use the same data statistics and evaluation metrics as widely used by the state of the art in this field, i.e., 150 object categories and 50 relationship categories are used. 70% of the dataset is used for training and 30% for testing. An additional 5000 images are taken from the training set and are used for validation. As used by the state of the art, we also employed Faster R-CNN [ref]25 with VGG-16 or ResNext-101 as a backbone to get the characteristics of object proposals. To keep the fairness in the comparison with state-of-the-art, we chose same experimental factors as chosen by [ref]21. Performance Diagnosis: The scene graph generation model is evaluated in three different sub-tasks: (1) Predicate classification, (2) Scene graph classification, and (3) Scene graph generation. These are the three protocols for which the model‚Äôs performance is evaluated separately.\nPredicate Detection is used to specify the relation of given objects. This protocol evaluates the set of possible relations between a pair of given objects. The prediction of relationships without the effect of object detection is examined.\nIn Phrase Detection, the input is an image and the outputs are triplets of subject-predicate-object. Additionally, one bounding box must have an overlap of at least 0.5 with the corresponding ground truth.\nFor Relation Detection, the same input and output as in Phrase Detection is used. In this case, not only one but two bounding boxes of the pair of objects must have at least 0.5 overlap with the ground truth. Metrics. The evaluated metrics for the diagnosis of the model performance is Recall at K (R@K), no graph constraint Recall at K (nGR@K), zero-shot Recall at K (zsR@K), and mean Recall (mR@K), where KùêæK=20, 50, and 100, respectively. Object Detector: A pretrained Faster R-CNN object detector with a VGG-16 net [ref]9 or ResNeXt-101-FPN  as a backbone is used which is taken from [ref]21. This detector was trained on the VG dataset, with batch size 8 and initial learning rate 8‚àó10‚àí38superscript1038*10^{-3} which is decayed at the 30‚Äãkt‚Äãh30superscriptùëòùë°‚Ñé30k^{th} and 40‚Äãkt‚Äãh40superscriptùëòùë°‚Ñé40k^{th} iteration by the factor of 10. After training this detector on 4 2080Ti GPU, 28.14 mAP (with 0.5 IoU) was achieved. Scene Graph Generation: The scene graph generation is trained with an SGD optimizer . The learning rate is set at 10‚àí3superscript10310^{-3} for all three protocols. This learning rate was decayed by a factor of 10 twice after hitting a validation performance plateau. Per-Class non-maximal suppression (NMS) was applied with 0.5 IoU. 160 RoIs for each image were sampled. In contrast to previous works, we also considered non-overlapping regions for relationship prediction. To generalize the scene graph generation task, we used similar settings as used in literature [ref]21. For model training, an RTX Titan was used. The batch size was set to 12 and the learning rate started at 10‚àí3superscript10310^{-3} and was reduced two times by a factor of 10 after hitting a validation performance plateau. The number of solver iterations was set to 18000.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: is used for training and 30% for testing.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
