Semi-template-based methods   [ref]13  \nhave two steps: (1) they first identify the reaction centers and\nbreak the product into synthons using reaction centers; and then (2) they complete synthons into\nreactants.\nFor example, 𝖱𝖾𝗍𝗋𝗈𝖯𝗋𝗂𝗆𝖾𝖱𝖾𝗍𝗋𝗈𝖯𝗋𝗂𝗆𝖾\\mathsf{RetroPrime} [ref]13 employs two Transformers to first translate the SMILES strings of products to synthons, and then synthons to reactants.\n𝖦𝗋𝖺𝗉𝗁𝖱𝖾𝗍𝗋𝗈𝖦𝗋𝖺𝗉𝗁𝖱𝖾𝗍𝗋𝗈\\mathsf{GraphRetro}  predicts reaction centers by learning from the molecular graphs of products, and then completes synthons by classifying the subgraphs\nbased on whether they can realize the difference between synthons and reactants.\n𝖦𝟤​𝖱𝖾𝗍𝗋𝗈superscript𝖦2𝖱𝖾𝗍𝗋𝗈\\mathsf{G^{2}Retro}  also predicts reaction centers from molecular graphs, and then completes synthons by sequentially adding rings or bonds.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: use reaction templates that are extracted from known reactions to transform a product directly into reactants, and thus are\nlimited to reactions covered by the templates.\nTemplate-free methods    [ref]9 [ref]10\ntypically utilize the sequence representation of molecules (SMILES) and employ Transformer models to translate product SMILES strings into reactant SMILES strings, without using\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
