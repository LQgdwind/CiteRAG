      "content": "Paper Title: On the independence between phenomenal consciousness and computational intelligence\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nArtificial intelligence  has another controversial definition. Generally, it is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines [ref]38. But, if we want to define the intelligence of machines, that definition is circular, hence invalid. We prefer to define it as an objective quantitative measure that is determined by the scope of problems that an artificial system is able to solve. In the recent years, due to the significant advances of computational power, it has been possible to implement high-capacity machine-learning models  like deep neural networks, what is usually referred as deep learning . As we have illustrated in the introduction, these models, whose capacity includes having more than 500 billions of parameters , are able to solve complex problems like the protein folding problem , go and chess , write philosophy articles in a newspaper mocking the type of writings that were usually only attributed to human beings  mastering natural language processing and common sense tasks and generating art . In essence, deep learning methodologies are able to fitting complex probability distributions being able to generalize their behaviour to tasks that we only supposed to be solved by humans, making their behaviour indistinguishable from the one of humans . However, deep neural networks are software programs that are executed using computer hardware in a CPU (Central Processing Unit), GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) or TPU (Tensorial Processing Unit). Concretely, these hardware units are a part of a Von Neumann architecture, that is essentially a Turing machine, making deep neural networks algorithms that can be executed by a Von Neumann architecture, hence a Turing machine. Consequently, as we will further provide arguments for this claim, they lack awareness or phenomenal consciousness. As a result, they are unable to understand nor experience the scope of problems that they are solving and merely solve computations involving pattern recognition, independently of their complexity. Hence, artificial intelligence systems only posses computational intelligence  , lacking understanding as it requires the qualia of the problem being solved. However, a virtue of computational intelligence is that it can be quantified, as it solves objective problems belonging to the set of all possible computational problems. In contrast, general human intelligence, as we will further see, is a subjective and relative to the observer measure, requiring the qualia generated by understanding, feelings or empathy and hence being impossible to fully quantify without incurring in a reductionist measure. There are several propositions to quantify the computational intelligence that a system or an entity possess. Let π𝜋\\pi be an entity, for example a human being, that in every instant t𝑡t is able to perform a set of actions A𝐴A to solve a given problem. An intelligent agent π𝜋\\pi would decide, for every instant t𝑡t, the optimum action a⋆∈Asuperscript𝑎⋆𝐴a^{\\star}\\in A to solve the problem. The branch of computer science that studies how to train intelligent agents in this framework is called reinforcement learning , and can be directly extrapolated to the reality. For example, if we want to say the optimum phrase to win a negotiation, in every instant t𝑡t we receive the sentence of the person that we are negotiating with, its word frequency, mood state and more information and as a function of all that information we choose to answer a certain phrase in a particular mood state. As we can see, the reinforcement learning can be applied to a plethora of computational intelligence problems. In fact, reinforcement learning systems are implemented in robots for planning. Dealing with these systems, that can perfectly be humans, the universal intelligence function ΥΥ\\Upsilon of a data structure resembling an agent π𝜋\\pi is given by the following measure : where μ𝜇\\mu is a data structure representing an environment from the set E𝐸E of all computable reward bounded environments, K​(⋅)𝐾⋅K(\\cdot) is the Kolmogorov complexity, and Vμπ:=𝔼​(∑i=1∞Ri)assignsuperscriptsubscript𝑉𝜇𝜋𝔼superscriptsubscript𝑖1subscript𝑅𝑖V_{\\mu}^{\\pi}:=\\mathbb{E}(\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}R_{i}) is the expected sum of future rewards Risubscript𝑅𝑖R_{i} when agent π𝜋\\pi interacts with environment μ𝜇\\mu. That is, the previous expression is a weighted average of how many problems μ∈E𝜇𝐸\\mu\\in E does an agent π𝜋\\pi solve weighted by their difficulty 2−K​(μ)​Vμπsuperscript2𝐾𝜇superscriptsubscript𝑉𝜇𝜋2^{-K(\\mu)}V_{\\mu}^{\\pi} and the capabilities of the agent. In particular, this is the reason why Vμπsuperscriptsubscript𝑉𝜇𝜋V_{\\mu}^{\\pi} includes π𝜋\\pi. Several things are interesting dealing with this expression. First, the set of all computable reward bounded environments, i.e., generalizing this set would be the set of all computational problems, is countably infinite, having as an axiom that it exists a particular simple problem that can not be decomposed in more single parts. Hence, the intelligence ΥΥ\\Upsilon of an agent is not upper bounded. If we transform the set E𝐸E to a set where the area of a problem μ𝜇\\mu is given as a function of its difficulty S​(μ)𝑆𝜇S(\\mu), being more area given to more difficulty with respect to a particular agent π𝜋\\pi, the previous measure can be transformed in this abstract, general measure: where S​(μ)𝑆𝜇S(\\mu) is a oracle function that gives the objective area of a problem μ𝜇\\mu and δ​(μ|π)𝛿conditional𝜇𝜋\\delta(\\mu|\\pi) is a delta function representing whether the particular problem is solved or not by the agent π𝜋\\pi. Recall that the delta function outputs 111 if the problem is solved and 00 otherwise. As the set is potentially countably infinite, a problem can be decomposed according to the progress on it in different problems until a simple base problem, each one with different area to measure the progress of an agent in the progress of a particular problem. Interestingly, the integral over the set E𝐸E gives the area of computational problems being solved, and this area is infinite. Moreover, an oracle giving the particular objective unbiased measure of difficulty for every problem would be needed. Depending on the features of the system, a problem may be more difficult than other, specially for non-computable problems requiring qualia to be solved. These objections make such a measure impossible to be unbiasedly implemented in practice, but may be a lower bound of the computational intelligence of a system, animal or human being. Another example of an intelligence measure of a system represented by I​S𝐼𝑆IS for a scope of tasks sampled from Ps​c​o​p​esubscript𝑃𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑝𝑒P_{scope} is now described. We have generalized from the measure proposed by Chollet, taking into account not only a scope of particular task that are numerable into a set but all the possible tasks that can be done in our universe, which is potentially infinite and the one that we believe that should be taken into account. Recall that we want to provide an ontologically objective general measure of computational intelligence , as we want to study its independence with an ontologically objective dichotomous property, that is whether an agent is aware of its phenomenal consciousness. Consequently, any measure that excludes a single property or is noisy or biased, such as the intelligence quotient, can not be compared with phenomenal consciousness without being also the results biased or noisy. Summarizing the main components of the expression, let PI​S,T+EI​S,T,Csubscript𝑃𝐼𝑆𝑇subscript𝐸𝐼𝑆𝑇𝐶P_{IS,T}+E_{IS,T,C} (priors plus experience) represent the total exposure of the system to information about the problem, including the information it starts with at the beginning of training represented by C𝐶C, the curriculum. Let ωT⋅θT⋅subscript𝜔𝑇subscript𝜃𝑇\\omega_{T}\\cdot\\theta_{T} be the subjective value we place on achieving sufficient skill at T𝑇T and let G​D𝐺𝐷GD be the generalization difficulty for agent I​S𝐼𝑆IS of solving task T𝑇T given its curriculum or specific properties of the agent C𝐶C: The formula is basically a generalization of ΥΥ\\Upsilon that takes into account the previous knowledge, modelled by the curriculum and the priors, to solve a particular task T𝑇T. The difficulty of the task is now modelled by the generalization difficulty and solving a potentially infinite scope is given the computing the expectation over Ps​c​o​p​esubscript𝑃𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑝𝑒P_{scope}. However, although this measure takes into account whether an entity is able to generalize from prior knowledge as a measure of intelligence, we find the same problems than in the previous measure. In both measures of intelligence, as the set of potential problems is potentially infinite and not-numerable, any entity would really have a measure of general intelligence of approximately 0, as it would fail to solve a potentially infinite set of problems. Moreover, both measures require having an oracle to determine the difficulty of the task. Consequently, they would both be biased although an objective oracle was able to provide this quantity. Any measure of intelligence giving any other score rather than zero, although practical, would be just a lower bound of the true intelligence of the entity, better approximated with these measures than with the intelligence quotient measure. Hence, it can be useful for health situations but never to classify an individual as more intelligent than another individual or, as we will further see, to say that a being is susceptible of having more or less likelihood of having phenomenal consciousness as a result of scoring more degree of intelligence according to a measure, as it is only a lower bound on the true intelligence, that cannot be measured in practice as we can only approximate it based on a subset of problems and by the external behaviour of the subject as in the case of the intelligence quotient. However, recall that it is critical to provide an abstract definition of computational intelligence because of two main reasons: first, in order to study its independence with an ontological property such as being aware of phenomenal consciousness, it needs to possess the same properties as phenomenal consciousness, that is, being ontological, general and not biased. As an analogy, in statistical terms, it needs to be defined as the parameter, from a frequentist point of view. Second, it can be useful to provide such a definition of intelligence to shed light to the psychology community to provide less biased estimators to it. Once again, this definition corresponds to the parameter and measures such as the intelligence quotient correspond to the estimator.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: Artificial intelligence  has another controversial definition.
