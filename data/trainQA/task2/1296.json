      "content": "Paper Title: LCS Graph Kernel Based on Wasserstein Distance in Longest Common Subsequence Metric Space\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOptimal transport provides a means of comparing probability distributions, which are histograms in the finite dimensional case  [ref]12. This quantity is defined over the same ground space or multiple pre-registered ground spaces. This comparison is interpreted as a mass movement problem, which seeks an optimum plan to move the mass from one distribution to the other at minimal cost. Actually, OT is rapidly gaining popularity in a multitude of machine learning problems, ranging from low-rank approximation , to dictionary learning , domain adaptation , clustering , semi-supervised learning [ref]22, color transfer , linear discriminative learning [ref]24, and clustering . We define two simplexes of histograms with n1subscript𝑛1n_{1} and n2subscript𝑛2n_{2} in the same metric space, which are defined, respectively, as\nΔn1={𝒑∈ℝ+n1;∑ipi=1}subscriptΔsubscript𝑛1formulae-sequence𝒑superscriptsubscriptℝsubscript𝑛1subscript𝑖subscript𝑝𝑖1\\Delta_{n_{1}}=\\{\\mbox{\\boldmath$p$}\\in\\mathbb{R}_{{+}}^{n_{1}};\\sum_{i}p_{i}=1\\}, and\nΔn2={𝒒∈ℝ+n2;∑jqj=1}subscriptΔsubscript𝑛2formulae-sequence𝒒superscriptsubscriptℝsubscript𝑛2subscript𝑗subscript𝑞𝑗1\\Delta_{n_{2}}=\\{\\mbox{\\boldmath$q$}\\in\\mathbb{R}_{{+}}^{n_{2}};\\sum_{j}q_{j}=1\\}, where in mass movement problem, 𝒑,𝒒𝒑𝒒\\mbox{\\boldmath$p$},\\mbox{\\boldmath$q$} are usually regarded as mass vectors of each histogram, with elements denoting the mass of each bin. Subsequently, we define two probability measures as\nμ=∑i=1n1pi​δxi𝜇superscriptsubscript𝑖1subscript𝑛1subscript𝑝𝑖subscript𝛿subscript𝑥𝑖\\mu=\\sum_{i=1}^{n_{1}}p_{i}\\delta_{x_{i}}, and ν=∑j=1n2qj​δyj𝜈superscriptsubscript𝑗1subscript𝑛2subscript𝑞𝑗subscript𝛿subscript𝑦𝑗\\nu=\\sum_{j=1}^{n_{2}}q_{j}\\delta_{y_{j}},\nwhere xi≠xjsubscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑥𝑗x_{i}\\neq x_{j} for i≠j𝑖𝑗i\\neq j is assumed without loss of generality. We also consider the ground cost matrix C∈ℝ+n1×n2Csuperscriptsubscriptℝsubscript𝑛1subscript𝑛2\\mbox{\\bf C}\\in\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n_{1}\\times n_{2}}, where C​(i,j)C𝑖𝑗\\mbox{\\bf C}(i,j) represents the transportation cost between the i𝑖i-th and j𝑗j-th element. The optimal transport problem between these two histograms is defined as where 𝒰n1​n2subscript𝒰subscript𝑛1subscript𝑛2\\mathcal{U}_{n_{1}n_{2}} is defined as and 𝒰n1​n2subscript𝒰subscript𝑛1subscript𝑛2\\mathcal{U}_{n_{1}n_{2}} represents the polytope of n1×n2subscript𝑛1subscript𝑛2n_{1}\\!\\times\\!n_{2} nonnegative matrices such that their row and column marginals are, respectively, equal to pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} and qjsubscript𝑞𝑗q_{j}. This minimization problem involves a linear programming (LP) problem, i.e., a convex optimization problem. Then, the Wasserstein distance between two measures, denoted as 𝒲​(μ,ν)𝒲𝜇𝜈\\mathcal{W}(\\mu,\\nu), is equal to the total distance traversed by the mass under the optimal transport plan T∗superscriptT\\mbox{\\bf T}^{*}.\nFurthermore, by adding an entropic regularizer H​(T)=−∑i=1n1∑j=1n2T​(i,j)​(log⁡(T​(i,j))−1)𝐻Tsuperscriptsubscript𝑖1subscript𝑛1superscriptsubscript𝑗1subscript𝑛2T𝑖𝑗T𝑖𝑗1H(\\mbox{\\bf T})=-\\sum_{i=1}^{n_{1}}\\sum_{j=1}^{n_{2}}\\mbox{\\bf T}(i,j)(\\log(\\mbox{\\bf T}(i,j))-1), a solution of the entropically regularized optimal transport problem is solvable efficiently using Sinkhorn’s fixed-point iterations   . If no prior information is known about a space, then\nwe set 𝒑=1n1​𝟏n1𝒑1subscript𝑛1subscript1subscript𝑛1\\mbox{\\boldmath$p$}=\\frac{1}{n_{1}}\\mbox{\\boldmath$1$}_{n_{1}} and 𝒒=1n2​𝟏n2𝒒1subscript𝑛2subscript1subscript𝑛2\\mbox{\\boldmath$q$}=\\frac{1}{n_{2}}\\mbox{\\boldmath$1$}_{n_{2}}.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: Optimal transport provides a means of comparing probability distributions, which are histograms in the finite dimensional case  [ref]12.
