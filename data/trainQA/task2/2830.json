      "content": "Paper Title: Avoiding Forgetting and Allowing Forward Transfer in Continual Learning via Sparse Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBaselines. Our study focuses on the replay-free setting using a fixed-capacity model. Therefore, we compare with several representative regularization methods that use dense fixed-capacity, EWC , MAS , and LWF [ref]25. In addition, we compare with task-specific components methods that use sparse sub-networks within a fixed-capacity model, PackNet  and SpaceNet 8. Benchmarks. We performed our experiments on three sets of benchmarks: (1) standard split-CIFAR10, (2) sequences with high semantic similarity at the class level across tasks, and (3) sequence of mixed datasets where tasks come from different domains to study the stability-plasticity dilemma for sequences with concept drift and interfering tasks. Standard Evaluation. We evaluate the standard split-CIFAR10 benchmark with 5 tasks. Each task consists of 2 consecutive classes of CIFAR10 . Similar Sequences. To assess replay-free methods under more challenging conditions, we design two new benchmarks with high semantic similarity across tasks. In the absence of past data, we test the unified classifier‚Äôs ability to distinguish between similar classes when they are not presented together within the same task. (1) sim-CIFAR10 is constructed from CIFAR-10 by shuffling the order of classes to increase the similarity across tasks (Appendix 0.A; Table 5). It consists of 5 tasks. (2) sim-CIFAR100 is constructed from CIFAR-100 . Classes within the same superclass in CIFAR-100 have high semantic similarity. Hence, we construct a sequence of 8 tasks with two classes each and distribute the classes from the same superclass in different tasks (Appendix 0.A; Table 6). Mix datasets. The considered datasets are CIFAR10 , MNIST , NotMNIST , and FashionMNIST . We construct a sequence of 8 tasks with 5 classes each. The first four tasks are dissimilar, while the second four are similar to the first ones (Appendix 0.A; Table 7). Implementation Details. Motivated by the recent study on architectures for CL , we follow 4 8  to use an AlexNet-like architecture  that is trained from scratch using stochastic gradient descent. We start reusing relevant knowledge in future tasks after learning similar ones. Therefore, for Mix and sim-CIFAR100, we start reusing past components from task 5, while for split-CIFAR10 and sim-CIFAR10, we start from task 3. Earlier tasks add connections in each layer using the free neurons. For all benchmarks, we use lr‚Äãe‚Äãu‚Äãs‚Äãesubscriptùëôùëüùëíùë¢ùë†ùëíl_{reuse} of 4. Evaluation Metrics. To evaluate different CL requirements, we assess various metrics: (1) Average accuracy (ACC), which measures the performance at the end of the learning experience, (2) Backward Transfer (BWT) , which measures the influence of learning a new task on previous tasks (large negative BWT means forgetting), (3) Floating-point operations (FLOPs), which measure the required computational cost, and (4) Model size (#params), which is the number of model parameters. More details are in Appendix 0.A.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: Our study focuses on the replay-free setting using a fixed-capacity model.
