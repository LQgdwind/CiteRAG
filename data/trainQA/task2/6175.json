Whereas a stream of works exists that aims at making these models inherently explainable , , , , , , , post-hoc interpretation techniques , , , [ref]43 currently dominate the existing related literature. A major advantage of the post-hoc methods is that the interpretation process does not interfere with the model design and training, thereby leaving the model performance unaffected. Our method is also a post-hoc technique, hence we focus on the related literature along this stream. Based on the underlying mechanism, we can divide the post-hoc interpretation approaches into three categories. The first is perturbation-based techniques , , , , [ref]50. The central idea of these methods is to interpret model prediction by perturbing the input features and analyzing its effects on the output. For instance, , , [ref]50 occlude parts of the image to cause the perturbation, whereas ,  optimize for a perturbation mask, keeping in sight the confidence score of the predictions. These methods are particularly relevant to black-box scenarios, where the model details are unavailable. However, since white-box setups are equally practical for the interpretation task, other works also use model information to devise more efficient methods. We discuss these approaches next. Among the white-box methods, activation-based techniques , , , , ,  form the second broad category. These methods commonly interpret the model predictions by weighting the activations of the deeper layers of the network with model gradients, thereby computing a saliency map for the input features. Though efficient, the resolution mismatch between the deeper layer features of the model and the input image compromises the quality of their results . The third category is that of backpropagation-based techniques , , , , , which side steps this issue by fully backpropagating the model gradients to the input for feature interpretation. Within the backpropagation-based techniques, a sub-branch of approaches is known as path attribution methods , [ref]20, , , [ref]43, . These methods are particularly attractive because they exhibit certain desirable axiomatic properties , . Originated in cooperative game-theory , the central idea of these techniques is to accumulate model gradients w.r.t. the input over a single  or multiple [ref]20,  paths formed between the input and a baseline image. The baseline signifies absence of the input features. Recording model gradients from the absence to the presence of a feature allows a more desirable non-local estimate of the importance attributed by the model to that feature.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: models are gaining considerable research attention.
