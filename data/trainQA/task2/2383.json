      "content": "Paper Title: From Show to Tell: A Survey on Deep Learning-based Image Captioning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSelf-attention is an attentive mechanism where each element of a set is connected with all the others, and that can be adopted to compute a refined representation of the same set of elements through residual connections (Fig. 3(b)). It was first introduced by Vaswani et al.  for machine translation and language understanding tasks, giving birth to the Transformer architecture and its variants, which have dominated the NLP field and later also Computer Vision. Definition of self-attention.\nFormally, self-attention makes use of the scaled dot-product mechanism, i.e. a multiplicative attention operator that handles three sets of vectors: a set of nqsubscript𝑛𝑞n_{q} query vectors 𝑸𝑸\\bm{Q}, a set of key vectors 𝑲𝑲\\bm{K}, and a set of value vectors 𝑽𝑽\\bm{V}, both containing nksubscript𝑛𝑘n_{k} elements. The operator takes a weighted sum of value vectors according to a similarity distribution between query and key vectors: where dksubscript𝑑𝑘d_{k} is a scaling factor.\nIn the case of self-attention, the three sets of vectors are obtained as linear projections of the same input set of elements.\nThe success of the Transformer demonstrates that leveraging self-attention allows achieving superior performances compared to attentive RNNs. Early self-attention approaches.\nAmong the first image captioning models leveraging this approach, Yang et al.  used a self-attentive module to encode relationships between features coming from an object detector. Later, Li et al.  proposed a Transformer model with a visual encoder for the region features coupled with a semantic encoder that exploits knowledge from an external tagger. Both encoders are based on self-attention and feed-forward layers. Their output is then fused through a gating mechanism governing the propagation of visual and semantic information. Variants of the self-attention operator.\nOther works proposed variants or modifications of the self-attention operator tailored for image captioning [ref]77   [ref]80 [ref]81. Geometry-aware encoding –\nHerdade et al. [ref]77 introduced a modified version of self-attention that takes into account the spatial relationships between regions. In particular, an additional geometric weight is computed between object pairs and is used to scale the attention weights. On a similar line, Guo et al.  proposed a normalized and geometry-aware version of self-attention that makes use of the relative geometry relationships between input objects.\nFurther, He et al.  introduced a spatial graph transformer, which considers different categories of spatial relationship between detections (e.g., parent, neighbor, child) when performing attention. Attention on Attention – Huang et al.  proposed an extension of the attention operator in which the final attended information is weighted by a gate guided by the context. Specifically, the output of the self-attention is concatenated with the queries, then an information and a gate vector are computed and finally multiplied together. In their encoder, they employed this mechanism to refine the visual features.\nThis method is then adopted by later models such as . X-Linear Attention – Pan et al. [ref]80 proposed to use bilinear pooling techniques to strengthen the representative capacity of the output attended feature. Notably, this mechanism encodes the region-level features with higher-order interaction, leading to a set of enhanced region-level and image-level features. Memory-augmented Attention – Cornia et al. [ref]81  proposed a Transformer-based architecture where the self-attention operator of each encoder layer is augmented with a set of memory vectors. Specifically, the set of keys and values is extended with additional “slots” learned during training, which can encode multi-level visual relationships. Other self-attention-based approaches.\nJi et al.  proposed to improve self-attention by adding to the sequence of feature vectors a global vector computed as their average. A global vector is computed for each layer, and the resulting global vectors are combined via an LSTM, thus obtaining an inter-layer representation. Luo et al.  proposed a hybrid approach that combines region and grid features to exploit their complementary advantages. Two self-attention modules are applied independently to each kind of features, and a cross-attention module locally fuses their interactions.\nOn a different line, the architecture proposed by Liu et al.  is based on an attention module to align grid or detection features with visual words extracted from a concept extractor and to obtain semantic-grounded encodings. Attention on grid features and patches.\nOther than applying the attention operator on detections, the role of grid features has been recently re-evaluated . For instance, the approach proposed by Zhang et al.  applies self-attention directly to grid features, incorporating their relative geometry relationships into self-attention computation.\nTransformer-like architectures can also be applied directly on image patches, thus excluding the usage of the convolutional operator   (Fig. 4). On this line, Liu et al.  devised the first convolution-free architecture for image captioning. Specifically, a pre-trained Vision Transformer network (i.e. ViT ) is adopted as encoder, and a standard Transformer decoder is employed to generate captions. Interestingly, the same visual encoding approach has been adopted in CLIP  and SimVLM , with the difference that the visual encoder is trained from scratch on large-scale noisy data. CLIP-based features have then been used by subsequent captioning approaches   . Early fusion and vision-and-language pre-training.\nOther works using self-attention to encode visual features achieved remarkable performance also thanks to vision-and-language pre-training   and early-fusion strategies  . For example, following the BERT architecture , Zhou et al.  combined encoder and decoder into a single stream of Transformer layers, where region and word tokens are early fused together into a unique flow. This unified model is first pre-trained on large amounts of image-caption pairs to perform both bidirectional and sequence-to-sequence prediction tasks and then fine-tuned. On the same line, Li et al.  proposed OSCAR, a BERT-like architecture that includes object tags as anchor points to ease the semantic alignment between images and text.\nThey also performed a large-scale pre-train with 6.56.56.5 million image-text pairs, with a masked token loss similar to the BERT mask language loss and a contrastive loss for distinguishing aligned words-tags-regions triples from polluted ones.\nLater, Zhang et al.  proposed VinVL, built on top of OSCAR, introducing a new object detector capable of extracting better visual features and a modified version of the vision-and-language pre-training objectives. On this line, Hu et al.  improved the VinVL model by scaling up its size and using larger scale noisy data to pre-train.\n\nReference markers found: [77]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]77: propagation of visual and semantic information.
