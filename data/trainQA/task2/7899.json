      "content": "Paper Title: Runtime Verification on Abstract Finite State Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere has been considerable interest in the use of abstraction to enhance the performance of property checking of finite-state systems     . We first briefly highlight the main approaches to design-time abstraction methods and then point out the similarities and differences with our proposed approach. Property-Preserving Abstractions.\nAs noted earlier in Section 1, abstractions should be property-preserving in order that\nverification can be carried out on abstract models. This concept was first introduced by\nSifakis  in the context of transition systems and further studied by Loiseaux, et al\n.\nThey show the preservation of properties in a fragment of the Œºùúá\\mu-calculus when the states of the two transition systems are related by a Galois connection. This is a specialization of the approach by Cousot and Cousot\n  who showed the use of Galois connections for a language-independent way of specifying abstract interpretations of programs. Abstract interpretations   are generally used to collect information about the static semantics of a program, in contrast with our work which focuses on the dynamic behavior of programs. In abstract interpretations, the abstractions are defined for particular types of analysis and are fixed, whereas, in our approach, the abstractions are user-defined and given on the fly. Clarke et al  showed the use of abstraction to reduce the complexity of checking properties in a CTL branching-time logic and to facilitate the verification of problems with very large state spaces. The transition system is defined using a finite-state procedural program and symbolic execution is performed on this program in order to produce an abstract representation of its behaviour.\nThe temporal properties are then verified using state-space search in the abstract space.\nProperty preservation holds for abstraction in the sense that if a property is true in the abstract space it is true in the original space; if it is false in abstract space, it may or may not be false in the original space.\nThe abstraction functions discussed in the work are: congruence modulo integer for arithmetic operations; single-bit abstractions for bit-wise logical operations; product abstractions for combining various abstractions;\nand symbolic abstractions. Software Model Checking.\nIn software model checking, the state space could be infinite and abstraction is essential for reducing the verification of an infinite-state system to that of a finite-state system. Ball et al , \nintroduce the concept of predicate abstraction whereby a C program is abstracted as a boolean program with the aid of a set of predicates. The abstracted program has the same control flow as the C program and has been used for various static analyses as well as to check temporal safety properties of Microsoft‚Äôs device drivers. The authors note that the drivers are essentially control-oriented programs and are amenable to model checking by accurately abstracting the flow of control. A noteworthy aspect of their system (SLAM) is the ability to automatically find abstraction predicates as well as to modify them when a particular choice of predicates is insufficient to prove or disprove a property. The Bandera system developed by Dwyer et al  shares with our work the focus on Java programs (or JVM bytecodes) and support for similar types of user-defined abstractions that are tailored to the temporal property being verified. Like SLAM, the analyses are done statically, starting from a transformation of a concrete (Java) program to an abstract program. The temporal LTL property is also mapped to a property in the abstract space and the abstract program is then shown to satisfy the abstract property. Towards improving overall performance, Bandera removes irrelevant parts of the program from being considered by using program slicing based upon information about variables present in the property to be proved as well as other variables upon which they are control- or data-dependent. The main difference between the above approaches and this paper is our focus on runtime, as opposed to design-time, verification. Specification Mining. The concept of model abstraction has also been explored by the state-based specification mining   [ref]27 and monitoring  approaches. In object behavior mining , the program executions are observed to construct models of a Java object and these models are subject to fixed abstraction patterns to create an abstract model of the object. JIV2E is similar in terms of using program execution to extract models and applying abstractions to reduce the states, but differs in extracting models of the entire program under execution rather than focusing on a single object behavior. Also, the abstractions are defined by the users based on the domain of the key attributes selected for model construction. Marchetto et al  used state abstractions to abstract state machines of Ajax based web applications.\nWhile their abstractions are similar to boolean abstractions, the JIV2E user can also define\nmulti-valued and control abstractions. Mariani et al [ref]27 explore the application of state abstractions to automatically evolve mined specifications from Java  and Ajax  applications. The traces from the applications are analyzed to keep the existing models updated and aligned with the actual implementations, which dynamically evolve due to changes in configuration or dynamic installation/removal of components. Unlike this technique, JIV2E constructs the runtime model by adding new states (concrete / abstract) to the model being constructed as the events are received. The states once added are not removed from the model, thereby retaining the history of the application state. Cornejo et al  explore the use of automatically derived abstraction functions using symbolic execution techniques. While the derived abstractions are based on path conditions over state variables and program inputs,\nJIV2E supports user-defined abstractions such as boolean, multi-valued, control and path abstractions. Object Constraint Language.\nThere are some similarities between our property specification language and the Object Constraint Language (OCL) .\nOCL is a textual language that augments UML with design-time specifications, notably constraints and rules on UML models that cannot be captured by the structural diagrams. Other key design-time specifications of OCL are pre- and post-conditions for methods and class invariants. These are a complementary set of concerns compared with the focus of this paper, which is on run-time verification of data- and control-oriented properties. The latter are typically path properties that are especially useful in larger applications. Although there is some research on defining temporal extensions to OCL  , this is still not an official part of OCL. A comprehensive verification system should support both design-time and run-time verification. The focus of this paper, however, is on the latter, and, in particular, the use of abstractions to obtain smaller models for verification. Runtime Verification.\nThe early forerunners in the area of runtime verification were the monitoring and checking framework (MaC)   and the Java path explorer (JPAX)   . Our online verification system, JIV2E, is related to the MaC architecture   for continuous monitoring and checking of correct behaviors of an application. The MaC system is implemented for Java and the instrumentation is performed at the byte-code level. It consists of three main components (filter, event recognizer, and runtime checker), which effectively map low-level information, such as the values of program variables, to abstract events that serve as a basis for checking the acceptance of runtime behaviors. JIV2E also employs the above three components, but a major difference in our approach is that we directly construct an abstract model as the program runs and also carry out property checking directly on the abstract model. JPAX tests execution traces of Java programs against logic-based specifications using logic-based monitoring and detects concurrency errors, such as deadlocks and data races, using error pattern analysis. In JPAX, the logic specifications and the error pattern analysis are performed directly on the execution trace, whereas in our work, abstract runtime models are constructed before property checking. While the earlier systems were designed to handle propositional events (not carrying data), the more recent systems also handled parameterized events (events with data values)    . Another approach that supports both types of events is the paradigm of monitor-oriented programming (MOP)     . In MOP, the monitors are automatically synthesized from high level specifications and take appropriate actions in the event of violation or validation of properties. JIV2E also supports propositional and parameterized events which we classify as control-oriented and data-oriented respectively. An important feature of JIV2E is that the values of fields of objects can also be included in the finite state model, and these fields can be subject to abstraction111Although our focus is on fields of objects through FieldWrite events, we can also access method arguments through VariableWrite events. The bytecode instrumentation technique used in JIV2E for emitting events may be\ncontrasted with approaches based upon aspect-oriented programming (AOP) such as DiSL \nwhich require the source code modifications to express instrumentation details using AOP‚Äôs pointcut/advice model. Our system can emit various types of events such as field write, method calls, method returns, etc., whereas DiSL supports only events based on methods calls and its arguments, but does not allow one to extract details regarding field writes in a straightforward manner  . Finally, we would like to note that this paper is a continuation of our recent paper  whose focus was on model extraction from an execution trace derived from a run of a Java program. Although there was some discussion of abstraction and properties in our earlier paper, we present here a more in-depth account of these topics and, in particular, provide algorithms for property checking on abstract models along with case studies of their applicability. We construct data-oriented models and control-oriented models according to whether the property to be verified is about the data states or the flow of control, respectively. The abstraction functions can be boolean or multi-valued for data-oriented models and they can be package/class/method/thread and path abstractions for control-oriented models. The property specification language caters to state-based as well as path-based properties. We show that property preservation holds in that if the property is true in the abstract model then it is true in the concrete model. If a property fails in the abstract model, it may or may not fail in the concrete model ‚Äì the chosen abstraction may be incorrect and may need to be reformulated.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: this paper is our focus on runtime, as opposed to design-time, verification.
