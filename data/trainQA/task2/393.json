A subgraph G^^𝐺\\widehat{G} of the signed graph H^^𝐻\\widehat{H} is the\ns-core of H^^𝐻\\widehat{H} if there is homomorphism f:H^→G^:𝑓→^𝐻^𝐺f:\\widehat{H}\\to\\widehat{G}, and\nevery homomorphism G^→G^→^𝐺^𝐺\\widehat{G}\\to\\widehat{G} is a bijection on V​(G)𝑉𝐺V(G). The letter s𝑠s stands\nfor signed. It is again easy to see that the s𝑠s-core is unique up to isomorphism and\nswitching equivalence. [ref]8\nThe problem S-Hom(H^)^𝐻(\\widehat{H}) is polynomial-time solvable\nif the s-core of H^^𝐻\\widehat{H} has at most two edges, and is NP-complete otherwise. When the signature π𝜋\\pi has all edges positive, the problem S-Hom(H,π)𝐻𝜋(H,\\pi)\nis equivalent to the unsigned graph homomorphism problem, and the s-core of (H,π)𝐻𝜋(H,\\pi)\nis just the core of H𝐻H. To compare Theorem 5 with the graph dichotomy\ntheorem of  as discussed at the beginning Section 1, we observe that\nthe core of a graph cannot have exactly two edges, as a core must be either a single vertex\n(possibly with a loop), or a single edge, or a graph with at least three edges. Thus Theorem\n5 is stronger than the graph dichotomy theorem from , which states\nthat the graph homomorphism problem to H𝐻H is polynomial-time solvable if the core of H𝐻H\nhas at most one edge and is NP-complete otherwise. (However, we note that the proof of\nTheorem 5 in [ref]8 uses the graph dichotomy theorem .) Observe that an instance of the problem S-Hom​(H^)S-Hom^𝐻\\textsc{S-Hom}(\\widehat{H}) can be\nalso viewed as an instance of List-S-Hom​(H^)List-S-Hom^𝐻\\textsc{List-S-Hom}(\\widehat{H}) with all\nlists L​(v)=V​(H)𝐿𝑣𝑉𝐻L(v)=V(H), therefore if S-Hom​(H^)S-Hom^𝐻\\textsc{S-Hom}(\\widehat{H}) is NP-complete,\nthen so is List-S-Hom​(H^)List-S-Hom^𝐻\\textsc{List-S-Hom}(\\widehat{H}). Moreover, if H^′superscript^𝐻′\\widehat{H}^{\\prime} is\nan induced subgraph of H^^𝐻\\widehat{H}, then any instance of\nList-S-Hom​(H^′)List-S-Homsuperscript^𝐻′\\textsc{List-S-Hom}(\\widehat{H}^{\\prime}) can be viewed as an instance of\nList-S-Hom​(H^)List-S-Hom^𝐻\\textsc{List-S-Hom}(\\widehat{H}) (with the same lists), therefore if the\nproblem List-S-Hom​(H^′)List-S-Homsuperscript^𝐻′\\textsc{List-S-Hom}(\\widehat{H}^{\\prime}) is NP-complete, then so is the\nproblem List-S-Hom​(H^)List-S-Hom^𝐻\\textsc{List-S-Hom}(\\widehat{H}). This yields the NP-completeness of\nList-S-Hom​(H^)List-S-Hom^𝐻\\textsc{List-S-Hom}(\\widehat{H}) for all signed graphs (H^)^𝐻(\\widehat{H}) that\ncontain an induced subgraph H^′superscript^𝐻′\\widehat{H}^{\\prime} whose s-core has more than two\nedges. Furthermore, when the signed graph H^^𝐻\\widehat{H} is uni-balanced, then we\nmay assume that all edges are at least blue, and the list homomorphism\nproblem for H𝐻H can be reduced to List-S-Hom​(H^)List-S-Hom^𝐻\\textsc{List-S-Hom}(\\widehat{H}). In particular,\nwe emphasize that List-S-Hom​(H^)List-S-Hom^𝐻\\textsc{List-S-Hom}(\\widehat{H}) is NP-complete if H^^𝐻\\widehat{H}\nis a uni-balanced signed graph (or, by a symmetric argument, an anti-uni-balanced signed\ngraph), and the underlying graph H𝐻H is not a bi-arc graph . Next we focus on the class of signed graphs that have no bicoloured loops and no bicoloured\nedges. In this case, the following simple dichotomy describes the classification. (This result\nwas previously announced in .) It follows from our earlier remarks that these\nsigned graphs are balanced if and only if they are uni-balanced, and similarly they are anti-balanced\nif and only if they are anti-uni-balanced. Suppose H^^𝐻\\widehat{H} is a connected signed graph without bicoloured loops and edges.\nIf the underlying graph H𝐻H is a bi-arc graph, and H^^𝐻\\widehat{H} is balanced or\nanti-balanced, then the problem List-S-Hom​(H^)List-S-Hom^𝐻\\textsc{List-S-Hom}(\\widehat{H}) is polynomial-time\nsolvable. Otherwise, the problem is NP-complete. The polynomial cases follow from Feder et al. , by the following argument.\nSuppose H^^𝐻\\widehat{H} is balanced; we may assume all edges are blue. In ,\nthere is a polynomial-time algorithm to decide if the input signed graph G^^𝐺\\widehat{G} is\nbalanced. If it is not balanced, there is no homomorphism of G^^𝐺\\widehat{G} to H^^𝐻\\widehat{H}.\nOtherwise, we may assume that G^^𝐺\\widehat{G} has also all edges blue and hence there is a\nhomomorphism of G^^𝐺\\widehat{G} to H^^𝐻\\widehat{H} if and only if there is a homomorphism of G𝐺G\nto H𝐻H. Since H𝐻H is a bi-arc graph, this can be decided in polynomial time by the algorithm in\n. The argument is similar if H^^𝐻\\widehat{H} is anti-balanced. Otherwise, H^^𝐻\\widehat{H}\ncontains a cycle which cannot be switched to a blue cycle and a cycle which cannot be switched\nto a red cycle, in which case the s-core of H^^𝐻\\widehat{H} contains at least three edges.\n(This is true even if the cycles are just loops.)\n\\qed We have observed that List-S-Hom(H^)^𝐻(\\widehat{H}) is NP-complete if the\ns-core of H^^𝐻\\widehat{H} has more than two edges. Thus we will focus on signed\ngraphs H^^𝐻\\widehat{H} whose s-cores have at most two edges. This is not as simple\nas it sounds, as there are many complex signed graphs with this property, including,\nfor example, all irreflexive bipartite signed graphs that contain a bicoloured edge,\nand all signed graphs that contain a bicoloured loop. That these cases are not easy\nunderlines the fact that the assumptions in Theorem 6 cannot be\nweakened without significant new breakthroughs. Consider, for example, allowing\nbicoloured edges but not bicoloured loops. In this situation, we may focus on the\ncase when there is a bicoloured edge (else Theorem 6 applies),\nand so if there is any loop at all, the s-core would have more than two edges. Thus\nwe consider irreflexive signed graphs. The s-core is still too big if the underlying\ngraph has an odd cycle. So in this case it remains to classify the irreflexive bipartite\nsigned graphs that contain a bicoloured edge. Even this case is complex. We explore\nhomomorphisms to irreflexive bipartite signed graphs in a companion paper. In this paper we focus on List-S-Hom​(H^)List-S-Hom^𝐻\\textsc{List-S-Hom}(\\widehat{H}) when the underlying\ngraph of H^^𝐻\\widehat{H} is a tree with possible loops. We have treated the special cases\nof reflexive and irreflexive trees in  and in the conference version of this paper ;\nin the general case presented here, the polynomial algorithms are much more involved\nand technical, and the structure of these trees turns out to be surprisingly complex.\nNevertheless, they seem to suggest that nice characterizations may be possible, in\nanalogy to bi-arc trees , see also . We now introduce our basic tool for proving NP-completeness. Let (U,D)𝑈𝐷(U,D) be two walks in H^^𝐻\\widehat{H} of equal length, say U𝑈U, with\nvertices u=u0,u1,…,uk=vformulae-sequence𝑢subscript𝑢0subscript𝑢1…subscript𝑢𝑘𝑣u=u_{0},u_{1},\\ldots,u_{k}=v and D𝐷D, with vertices u=d0,d1,…,dk=vformulae-sequence𝑢subscript𝑑0subscript𝑑1…subscript𝑑𝑘𝑣u=d_{0},d_{1},\\ldots,d_{k}=v. We say that (U,D)𝑈𝐷(U,D) is a chain, provided u​u1,dk−1​v𝑢subscript𝑢1subscript𝑑𝑘1𝑣uu_{1},d_{k-1}v are unicoloured edges and u​d1,uk−1​v𝑢subscript𝑑1subscript𝑢𝑘1𝑣ud_{1},u_{k-1}v are bicoloured edges, and\nfor each i𝑖i, 1≤i≤k−21𝑖𝑘21\\leq i\\leq k-2, we have both ui​ui+1subscript𝑢𝑖subscript𝑢𝑖1u_{i}u_{i+1} and di​di+1subscript𝑑𝑖subscript𝑑𝑖1d_{i}d_{i+1} are edges of H^^𝐻\\widehat{H}\nwhile di​ui+1subscript𝑑𝑖subscript𝑢𝑖1d_{i}u_{i+1} is not an edge of H^^𝐻\\widehat{H}, or both ui​ui+1subscript𝑢𝑖subscript𝑢𝑖1u_{i}u_{i+1} and di​di+1subscript𝑑𝑖subscript𝑑𝑖1d_{i}d_{i+1} are bicoloured edges of H^^𝐻\\widehat{H}\nwhile di​ui+1subscript𝑑𝑖subscript𝑢𝑖1d_{i}u_{i+1} is not a bicoloured edge of H^^𝐻\\widehat{H}. If a signed graph H^^𝐻\\widehat{H} contains a chain, then\nList-S-Hom​(H^)List-S-Hom^𝐻\\textsc{List-S-Hom}(\\widehat{H}) is NP-complete. Suppose that H^^𝐻\\widehat{H} has a chain (U,D)𝑈𝐷(U,D) as specified above. We shall\nreduce from Not-All-Equal SAT. (Each clause has three unnegated\nvariables, and we seek a truth assignment in which at least one variable is\ntrue and at least one is false, in each clause.) For each clause x∨y∨z𝑥𝑦𝑧x\\lor y\\lor z, we take three vertices x,y,z𝑥𝑦𝑧x,y,z, each with list {u}𝑢\\{u\\}, and three\nvertices x′,y′,z′superscript𝑥′superscript𝑦′superscript𝑧′x^{\\prime},y^{\\prime},z^{\\prime}, each with list {v}𝑣\\{v\\}. For the triple x,y,z𝑥𝑦𝑧x,y,z, we add\nthree new vertices p​(x,y)𝑝𝑥𝑦p(x,y), p​(y,z)𝑝𝑦𝑧p(y,z), and p​(z,x)𝑝𝑧𝑥p(z,x), each with list\n{u1,d1}subscript𝑢1subscript𝑑1\\{u_{1},d_{1}\\}, and for the triple x′,y′,z′superscript𝑥′superscript𝑦′superscript𝑧′x^{\\prime},y^{\\prime},z^{\\prime}, we add three new vertices\np​(x′,y′),p​(y′,z′),p​(z′,x′)𝑝superscript𝑥′superscript𝑦′𝑝superscript𝑦′superscript𝑧′𝑝superscript𝑧′superscript𝑥′p(x^{\\prime},y^{\\prime}),p(y^{\\prime},z^{\\prime}),p(z^{\\prime},x^{\\prime}), each with list {uk−1,dk−1}subscript𝑢𝑘1subscript𝑑𝑘1\\{u_{k-1},d_{k-1}\\}. We\nconnect these vertices as follows: p​(x,y)𝑝𝑥𝑦p(x,y) adjacent to x𝑥x by a red edge and to y𝑦y by a blue edge, p​(y,z)𝑝𝑦𝑧p(y,z) adjacent to y𝑦y by a red edge and to z𝑧z by a blue edge, p​(z,x)𝑝𝑧𝑥p(z,x) adjacent to z𝑧z by a red edge and to x𝑥x by a blue edge. Analogously, the hexagon x′,p​(x′,y′),y′,p​(y′,z′),z′,p​(z′,x′)superscript𝑥′𝑝superscript𝑥′superscript𝑦′superscript𝑦′𝑝superscript𝑦′superscript𝑧′superscript𝑧′𝑝superscript𝑧′superscript𝑥′x^{\\prime},p(x^{\\prime},y^{\\prime}),y^{\\prime},p(y^{\\prime},z^{\\prime}),z^{\\prime},p(z^{\\prime},x^{\\prime}) will also\nbe alternating in blue and red colours, with (say) p​(x′,y′)𝑝superscript𝑥′superscript𝑦′p(x^{\\prime},y^{\\prime}) adjacent to x′superscript𝑥′x^{\\prime}\nby a red edge. Moreover, we join each pair of vertices p​(x,y)𝑝𝑥𝑦p(x,y) and p​(x′,y′)𝑝superscript𝑥′superscript𝑦′p(x^{\\prime},y^{\\prime}) by a separate\npath P​(x,y)𝑃𝑥𝑦P(x,y) with k−1𝑘1k-1 vertices, say p​(x,y)=a1,a2,…,ak−2,ak−1=p​(x′,y′)formulae-sequence𝑝𝑥𝑦subscript𝑎1subscript𝑎2…subscript𝑎𝑘2subscript𝑎𝑘1𝑝superscript𝑥′superscript𝑦′p(x,y)=a_{1},a_{2},\\ldots,a_{k-2},a_{k-1}=p(x^{\\prime},y^{\\prime}), where aisubscript𝑎𝑖a_{i} has list {ui,di}subscript𝑢𝑖subscript𝑑𝑖\\{u_{i},d_{i}\\} and the edge\nai​ai+1subscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑎𝑖1a_{i}a_{i+1} is blue unless both ui​ui+1subscript𝑢𝑖subscript𝑢𝑖1u_{i}u_{i+1} and di​di+1subscript𝑑𝑖subscript𝑑𝑖1d_{i}d_{i+1} are bicoloured,\nin which case ai​ai+1subscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑎𝑖1a_{i}a_{i+1} is also bicoloured. Paths P​(z,x)𝑃𝑧𝑥P(z,x) and P​(y,z)𝑃𝑦𝑧P(y,z) are\ndefined analogously. See Figure 1 for an illustration. We observe for future reference that the path x,p​(x,y)=a1,a2,…,ak−2,formulae-sequence𝑥𝑝𝑥𝑦subscript𝑎1subscript𝑎2…subscript𝑎𝑘2x,p(x,y)=a_{1},a_{2},\\ldots,a_{k-2}, ak−1=p​(x′,y′),x′subscript𝑎𝑘1𝑝superscript𝑥′superscript𝑦′superscript𝑥′a_{k-1}=p(x^{\\prime},y^{\\prime}),x^{\\prime}, when considered by itself, admits a list\nhomomorphism both to U𝑈U and to D𝐷D. (To see this invoke Zaslavsky’s theorem\ncharacterizing switching equivalent signatures, and use the fact that both\nU𝑈U and D𝐷D contain a bicoloured edge.) Further we note there is no list\nhomomorphism to any other subgraph of U∪D𝑈𝐷U\\cup D where p​(x,y)𝑝𝑥𝑦p(x,y) maps\nto d1subscript𝑑1d_{1} and p​(x′,y′)𝑝superscript𝑥′superscript𝑦′p(x^{\\prime},y^{\\prime}) maps to uk−1subscript𝑢𝑘1u_{k-1}. (This follows from the conditions\nin the definition of chain.) If x𝑥x occurs in several clauses, we now have several vertices corresponding\nto x𝑥x. We link all these occurrences by a new vertex p​(x)𝑝𝑥p(x) with the list {u1}subscript𝑢1\\{u_{1}\\},\nand joined by blue edges to all the occurrences of x𝑥x. Since the edge\nu​u1𝑢subscript𝑢1uu_{1} is unicoloured, this will ensure that all occurrences of the vertex x𝑥x are\nswitched or no occurrence of x𝑥x is switched. We denote the resulting graph (G,σ)𝐺𝜎(G,\\sigma). We now claim that this instance of\nNot-All-Equal SAT is satisfiable if and only if (G,σ)𝐺𝜎(G,\\sigma)\nadmits a list homomorphism to (H,π)𝐻𝜋(H,\\pi). Let G^​(x,y,z)^𝐺𝑥𝑦𝑧\\widehat{G}(x,y,z) denote the subgraph of (G,σ)𝐺𝜎(G,\\sigma) induced by\nP​(x,y),P​(z,x),P​(y,z)𝑃𝑥𝑦𝑃𝑧𝑥𝑃𝑦𝑧P(x,y),P(z,x),P(y,z) and x,y,z,x′,y′,z′𝑥𝑦𝑧superscript𝑥′superscript𝑦′superscript𝑧′x,y,z,x^{\\prime},y^{\\prime},z^{\\prime}. We claim that\n(i)\nany list homomorphism of G^​(x,y,z)^𝐺𝑥𝑦𝑧\\widehat{G}(x,y,z) to U∪D𝑈𝐷U\\cup D must switch at\neither one or two of the vertices x,y,z𝑥𝑦𝑧x,y,z, and that \n(ii) there are\nlist homomorphisms of G^​(x,y,z)^𝐺𝑥𝑦𝑧\\widehat{G}(x,y,z) to U∪D𝑈𝐷U\\cup D that switch at any\none or any two of the vertices x,y,z𝑥𝑦𝑧x,y,z. Once this claim is proved, we can associate with every truth assignment a list\nhomomorphism of G^​(x,y,z)^𝐺𝑥𝑦𝑧\\widehat{G}(x,y,z) to U∪D𝑈𝐷U\\cup D where a vertex\ncorresponding to a variable is switched if and only if that variable is true,\nand conversely, setting a variable true if its corresponding vertex was\nswitched in the list homomorphism.\nSince we have ensured that all occurrences of a variable are switched or all\nare not switched, we conclude that all occurrences of a variable take on the\nsame truth value. We now prove (i). Since the lists are so restrictive, any list homomorphism is\nfully described by what happens to the paths P​(x,y)𝑃𝑥𝑦P(x,y), P​(z,x)𝑃𝑧𝑥P(z,x), P​(y,z)𝑃𝑦𝑧P(y,z),\nand whether or not the vertices corresponding to x,y,z𝑥𝑦𝑧x,y,z (and x′,y′,z′superscript𝑥′superscript𝑦′superscript𝑧′x^{\\prime},y^{\\prime},z^{\\prime})\nare switched. Note that U𝑈U begins with a unicoloured edge and D𝐷D ends with a\nunicoloured edge. If neither x𝑥x nor y𝑦y or both x𝑥x and y𝑦y\nare switched, the edges x​p​(x,y)𝑥𝑝𝑥𝑦xp(x,y) and p​(x,y)​y𝑝𝑥𝑦𝑦p(x,y)y are different colours, and\nin any list homomorphism of G^​(x,y,z)^𝐺𝑥𝑦𝑧\\widehat{G}(x,y,z) to U∪D𝑈𝐷U\\cup D we must map\nP​(x,y)𝑃𝑥𝑦P(x,y) to D𝐷D. In particular, x′​p​(x′,y′)superscript𝑥′𝑝superscript𝑥′superscript𝑦′x^{\\prime}p(x^{\\prime},y^{\\prime}) and p​(x′,y′)​y′𝑝superscript𝑥′superscript𝑦′superscript𝑦′p(x^{\\prime},y^{\\prime})y^{\\prime} map to a unicoloured\nedge and must have the same colour. Thus, if none or all of the vertices x,y,z𝑥𝑦𝑧x,y,z\nwere switched, then the hexagon x′,p​(x′,y′),y′,p​(y′,z′),z′,p​(z′,x′)superscript𝑥′𝑝superscript𝑥′superscript𝑦′superscript𝑦′𝑝superscript𝑦′superscript𝑧′superscript𝑧′𝑝superscript𝑧′superscript𝑥′x^{\\prime},p(x^{\\prime},y^{\\prime}),y^{\\prime},p(y^{\\prime},z^{\\prime}),z^{\\prime},p(z^{\\prime},x^{\\prime}) has an\neven number of red and even number of blue edges, which is impossible. (It\nstarted with an odd number of each.) For (ii), it remains to show that one or two of the vertices x,y,z𝑥𝑦𝑧x,y,z can be\nswitched under a list homomorphism of G^​(x,y,z)^𝐺𝑥𝑦𝑧\\widehat{G}(x,y,z) to U∪D𝑈𝐷U\\cup D. Suppose\nfirst that only one was switched; by symmetry assume it was x𝑥x (so y𝑦y and\nz𝑧z were not switched). Now edges x,p​(x,y)𝑥𝑝𝑥𝑦x,p(x,y) and p​(x,y),y𝑝𝑥𝑦𝑦p(x,y),y have the same\ncolour, and z,p​(z,x)𝑧𝑝𝑧𝑥z,p(z,x) and p​(z,x),x𝑝𝑧𝑥𝑥p(z,x),x have the same colour. By the above\nobservation, we can map P​(x,y)𝑃𝑥𝑦P(x,y) and P​(z,x)𝑃𝑧𝑥P(z,x) to U𝑈U, and map P​(y,z)𝑃𝑦𝑧P(y,z) to D𝐷D.\nNote that the switchings necessary for these list homomorphisms affect\ndisjoint sets of vertices (the paths P​(x,y),P​(y,z),P​(z,x)𝑃𝑥𝑦𝑃𝑦𝑧𝑃𝑧𝑥P(x,y),P(y,z),P(z,x)), so the\nobservation applies. If two vertices, say y𝑦y and z𝑧z were switched, the\nargument is almost the same and we omit it.\n\\qed\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: We first mention the dichotomy classification of the problems S-Hom(H^)^𝐻(\\widehat{H})\nfrom [ref]8.
