      "content": "Paper Title: A Robust Version of Hegedűs’s Lemma, with Applications\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe Polynomial Method is a technique of great utility in both Theoretical Computer Science and Combinatorics. The idea of associating polynomials with various combinatorial objects and then using algebraic or geometric techniques to analyze them has proven useful in many settings including, but not limited to, Computational Complexity (Circuit lower bounds    , Pseudorandom generators ), Algorithm design (Learning Algorithms   , Satisfiability algorithms  , Combinatorial algorithms   [ref]4), and Extremal Combinatorics  6 8. The engine that drives the proofs of many of these results is our understanding of combinatorial and algebraic properties of polynomials. In this paper, we investigate another such naturally stated property of polynomials defined over the Boolean cube {0,1}nsuperscript01𝑛\\{0,1\\}^{n} and strengthen known results in this direction. We then apply this result to sharpen known results in theoretical computer science and combinatorics. The question we address is related to how well low-degree polynomials can ‘distinguish’ between different layers of the Boolean cube {0,1}n.superscript01𝑛\\{0,1\\}^{n}. For m∈{0,…,n}𝑚0…𝑛m\\in\\{0,\\ldots,n\\}, let {0,1}mnsubscriptsuperscript01𝑛𝑚\\{0,1\\}^{n}_{m} be the elements of {0,1}nsuperscript01𝑛\\{0,1\\}^{n} of Hamming weight exactly m𝑚m. As a first approximation, let us say that a polynomial P∈𝔽​[x1,…,xn]𝑃𝔽subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛P\\in\\mathbb{F}[x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}] (here 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} is some field) distinguishes between level sets {0,1}knsubscriptsuperscript01𝑛𝑘\\{0,1\\}^{n}_{k} and {0,1}Knsubscriptsuperscript01𝑛𝐾\\{0,1\\}^{n}_{K} if it vanishes at all points in the former set and at no point of the latter. Note that the ability of low-degree polynomials to do this depends on the properties of the underlying field 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F}: when 𝔽=ℚ𝔽ℚ\\mathbb{F}=\\mathbb{Q} (or any field of characteristic 00), the simple polynomial (∑i=1nxi)−ksuperscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛subscript𝑥𝑖𝑘\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}\\right)-k does the job. However, if the field 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} has positive characteristic p𝑝p and more specifically if K−k𝐾𝑘K-k is divisible by p𝑝p, then this simple polynomial no longer works and the answer is not so clear. In this setting, a classical theorem of Lucas tells us that if q𝑞q is the largest power of p𝑝p dividing K−k𝐾𝑘K-k, then there is a polynomial of degree q𝑞q that distinguishes between {0,1}knsubscriptsuperscript01𝑛𝑘\\{0,1\\}^{n}_{k} and {0,1}Kn.subscriptsuperscript01𝑛𝐾\\{0,1\\}^{n}_{K}. A very interesting lemma of Hegedűs  shows that this is tight even if we only require P𝑃P to be non-zero at some point of {0,1}Kn.subscriptsuperscript01𝑛𝐾\\{0,1\\}^{n}_{K}.\nMore precisely, Hegedűs’s lemma shows the following.111The lemma is usually stated    for a more restricted choice of parameters. However, the known proofs extend to yield the stronger statement given here. A proof of a more general statement can be found in [44, Theorem 1.5]. Let 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} be a field of characteristic p>0𝑝0p>0. Fix any positive integers n,k,q𝑛𝑘𝑞n,k,q such that k∈[q,n−q],𝑘𝑞𝑛𝑞k\\in[q,n-q], and q𝑞q a power of p𝑝p. If P∈𝔽​[x1,…,xn]𝑃𝔽subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛P\\in\\mathbb{F}[x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}] is any polynomial that vanishes at all a∈{0,1}kn𝑎subscriptsuperscript01𝑛𝑘a\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n}_{k} but does not vanish at some b∈{0,1}k+qn𝑏subscriptsuperscript01𝑛𝑘𝑞b\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n}_{k+q}, then deg⁡(P)≥q.degree𝑃𝑞\\deg(P)\\geq q. This lemma was first proved in  using Gröbner basis techniques. An elementary proof of this was recently given by the author and independently by Alon (see ) using the Combinatorial Nullstellensatz. Hegedűs’s lemma has been used to resolve various questions in both combinatorics and theoretical computer science. Hegedűs used this lemma to give an alternate solution to a problem of Galvin, which is stated as follows. Given a positive integer n𝑛n divisible by 444, what is the smallest size m=m​(n)𝑚𝑚𝑛m=m(n) of a family ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} of (n/2)𝑛2(n/2)-sized subsets of [n]delimited-[]𝑛[n] such that for any S⊆[n]𝑆delimited-[]𝑛S\\subseteq[n] of size n/2𝑛2n/2, there is a T∈ℱ𝑇ℱT\\in\\mathcal{F} with |T∩S|=n/4𝑇𝑆𝑛4|T\\cap S|=n/4? It is easy to see that m​(n)≤n/2𝑚𝑛𝑛2m(n)\\leq n/2 for any n𝑛n. A matching lower bound was given by Enomoto, Frankl, Ito and Nomora 9 in the case that t:=(n/4)assign𝑡𝑛4t:=(n/4) is odd. Hegedűs used the above lemma to give an alternate proof of a lower bound of n𝑛n in the case that t𝑡t is an odd prime. His proof was subsequently strengthened to a linear lower bound for all t𝑡t by Alon et al.  and more recently to a near-tight lower bound of (n/2)−o​(n)𝑛2𝑜𝑛(n/2)-o(n) for all t𝑡t by Hrubeš et al. . Both these results used the lemma above. Alon et al.  also used Hegedűs’s lemma to prove bounds for generalizations of Galvin’s problem. Using this, they were able to prove improved lower bounds against syntatically multilinear algebraic circuits. These are algebraic circuits that compute multilinear polynomials in a “transparently multilinear” way (see e.g.  for more). Alon et al. used Hegedűs’s lemma to prove near-quadratic lower bounds against syntactically multilinear algebraic circuits computing certain explicitly defined multilinear polynomials, improving on an earlier Ω~​(n4/3)~Ωsuperscript𝑛43\\tilde{\\Omega}(n^{4/3}) lower bound of Raz, Shpilka and Yehudayoff . Hrubeš et al.  also used Hegedűs’s lemma to answer the following question of Kulikov and Podolskii  on depth-222 threshold circuits. What is the smallest k=k​(n)𝑘𝑘𝑛k=k(n) such that there is a depth-222 circuit made up of Majority222The Majority function is the Boolean function f𝑓f which accepts exactly those inputs that have more 111s than 00s. gates of fan-in at most k𝑘k that computes the Majority function on n𝑛n bits? Using Hegedűs’s lemma, Hrubeš et al. showed an asymptotically tight lower bound of n/2−o​(n)𝑛2𝑜𝑛n/2-o(n) on k​(n)𝑘𝑛k(n). Our main result in this paper is a ‘robust’ strengthening of Hegedűs’s lemma. Proving ‘robust’ or ‘stability’ versions of known results is standard research direction in combinatorics. Such questions are usually drawn from the following template. Given the fact that objects that satisfy a certain property have some fixed structure, we ask if a similar structure is shared by objects that ‘almost’ or ‘somewhat’ satisfy the property. In our setting, we ask if we can recover the degree lower bound in Hegedűs’s lemma even if we have a polynomial P𝑃P that ‘approximately’ distinguishes between {0,1}knsubscriptsuperscript01𝑛𝑘\\{0,1\\}^{n}_{k} and {0,1}k+qnsubscriptsuperscript01𝑛𝑘𝑞\\{0,1\\}^{n}_{k+q}: this means that the polynomial P𝑃P vanishes at ‘most’ points of weight k𝑘k but is non-zero at ‘many’ points of weight k+q𝑘𝑞k+q. Our main lemma is that under suitable definitions of ‘most’ and ‘many’, we can recover (up to constant factors) the same degree lower bound as in Lemma 1.1 above. Assume that 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} is a field of characteristic p𝑝p. Let n𝑛n be a growing parameter and assume we have positive integer parameters k,q𝑘𝑞k,q such that 100​q<k<n−100​q100𝑞𝑘𝑛100𝑞100q<k<n-100q and q𝑞q is a power of p𝑝p. For ε=ε​(n,k,q),𝜀𝜀𝑛𝑘𝑞\\varepsilon=\\varepsilon(n,k,q), if P∈𝔽​[x1,…,xn]𝑃𝔽subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛P\\in\\mathbb{F}[x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}] that vanishes at a (1−ε)1𝜀(1-\\varepsilon)-fraction of points of {0,1}knsubscriptsuperscript01𝑛𝑘\\{0,1\\}^{n}_{k} but does not vanish at an ε0.0001superscript𝜀0.0001\\varepsilon^{0.0001} fraction of points of {0,1}k+qn,subscriptsuperscript01𝑛𝑘𝑞\\{0,1\\}^{n}_{k+q}, then deg⁡(P)=Ω​(q).degree𝑃Ω𝑞\\deg(P)=\\Omega(q). To keep the exposition informal, we have not specified exactly what ε𝜀\\varepsilon is in the above lemma. However, we note below that the ε𝜀\\varepsilon chosen is nearly the best possible in the sense that if ε𝜀\\varepsilon is appreciably increased, then there is a sampling-based construction of a polynomial P𝑃P of degree o​(q)𝑜𝑞o(q) satisfying the hypothesis of the above lemma (see Section 3.3). The reader might wonder why the lemma above is a strengthening of Hegedűs’s lemma, given that we require the polynomial P𝑃P to be non-zero at many points of weight k+q𝑘𝑞k+q, which is a seemingly stronger condition than required in Lemma 1.1. However, this is in fact a weaker condition. This is because of the following simple algebraic fact: if there is a polynomial P𝑃P of degree at most d𝑑d satisfying the hypothesis of Lemma 1.1 (i.e. vanishing at all points of weight k𝑘k but not at some point of weight k+q𝑘𝑞k+q), then there is also a polynomial Q𝑄Q of degree at most d𝑑d that vanishes at all points of weight k𝑘k but does not vanish at a significant fraction (at least a (1−1/p)11𝑝(1-1/p) fraction) of points of weight k+q𝑘𝑞k+q. We give a short proof of this in Appendix A. Hence, the above lemma is indeed a generalization of Lemma 1.1 (up to the constant-factor losses in the degree lower bound). Our investigations into robust versions of Hegedűs’s lemma were motivated by questions in computational complexity theory. Using our main result, we are able to sharpen and strengthen known results in complexity as well as combinatorics. Degree bounds for the Coin Problem: For a parameter δ∈[0,1/2],𝛿012\\delta\\in[0,1/2], we define the δ𝛿\\delta-coin problem as follows. We are given N𝑁N independent tosses of a coin, which is promised to either be of bias 1/2121/2 (i.e. unbiased) or (1/2)−δ12𝛿(1/2)-\\delta, and we are required to guess which of these is the case with a high degree of accuracy, say with error probability at most ε𝜀\\varepsilon. (See Definition 4.1 for the formal definition.) The coin problem has been studied in a variety of settings in complexity theory (see, e.g.    9 2 5) and for various reasons such as understanding the power of randomness in bounded-depth circuits, the limitations of blackbox hardness amplification, and devising pseudorandom generators for bounded-width branching programs. More recently, Limaye et al. 1 proved optimal lower bounds on the size of AC0​[⊕]superscriptAC0delimited-[]direct-sum\\mathrm{AC}^{0}[\\oplus] 333Recall that these are bounded-depth circuits made up of AND, OR and ⊕direct-sum\\oplus gates. circuits solving the δ𝛿\\delta-coin problem with constant error, strengthening an earlier lower bound of Shaltiel and Viola 9. This led to the first class of explicit functions for which we have tight (up to polynomial factors) AC0​[⊕]superscriptAC0delimited-[]direct-sum\\mathrm{AC}^{0}[\\oplus] lower bounds. These bounds were in turn used by Golovnev, Ilango, Impagliazzo, Kabanets, Kolokolova and Tal  to resolve a long-standing open problem regarding the complexity of MCSP in the AC0​[⊕]superscriptAC0delimited-[]direct-sum\\mathrm{AC}^{0}[\\oplus] model, and by Potukuchi 6 to prove lower bounds for Andreev’s problem. A key result in the lower bound of Limaye et al. 1 was a tight lower bound on the degree of any polynomial P∈𝔽​[x1,…,xN]𝑃𝔽subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑁P\\in\\mathbb{F}[x_{1},\\ldots,x_{N}] that solves the δ𝛿\\delta-coin problem with constant error: they showed that any such polynomial P𝑃P must have degree at least Ω​(1/δ).Ω1𝛿\\Omega(1/\\delta). As noted by Agrawal , this is essentially equivalent to a recent result of Chattopadhyay, Hatami, Lovett and Tal 3 on the level-111 Fourier coefficients of low-degree polynomials over finite fields, which in turn is connected to an intriguing new approach 3 toward constructing pseudorandom generators secure against AC0​[⊕].superscriptAC0delimited-[]direct-sum\\mathrm{AC}^{0}[\\oplus]. Using the robust Hegedűs lemma, we are able to strengthen the degree lower bound of 1 to a tight degree lower bound for all errors. Specifically, we show that over any field 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} of fixed positive characteristic p𝑝p, any polynomial P𝑃P that solves the δ𝛿\\delta-coin problem with error ε𝜀\\varepsilon must have degree Ω​(1δ​log⁡(1/ε))Ω1𝛿1𝜀\\Omega(\\frac{1}{\\delta}\\log(1/\\varepsilon)), which is tight for all δ𝛿\\delta and ε.𝜀\\varepsilon. Probabilistic degrees of symmetric functions: In a landmark paper , Razborov showed how to use polynomial approximations to prove lower bounds against AC0​[⊕]superscriptAC0delimited-[]direct-sum\\mathrm{AC}^{0}[\\oplus]. The notion of polynomial approximation introduced (implicitly) in his result goes by the name of probabilistic polynomials, and is defined as follows. An ε𝜀\\varepsilon-error probabilistic polynomial of degree d𝑑d for a Boolean function f:{0,1}n→{0,1}:𝑓→superscript01𝑛01f:\\{0,1\\}^{n}\\rightarrow\\{0,1\\} is a random polynomial 𝑷𝑷\\bm{P} of degree at most d𝑑d that agrees with f𝑓f at each point with probability at least 1−ε1𝜀1-\\varepsilon. The ε𝜀\\varepsilon-error probabilistic degree of f𝑓f is the least d𝑑d for which this holds. (Roughly speaking, a low-degree probabilistic polynomial for f𝑓f is an efficient randomized algorithm for f𝑓f, where we think of polynomials as algorithms and degree as a measure of efficiency.) Many applications of polynomial approximation in complexity theory  and algorithm design 0 use probabilistic polynomials and specifically bounds on the probabilistic degrees of various symmetric Boolean functions.444Recall that a Boolean function f:{0,1}n→{0,1}:𝑓→superscript01𝑛01f:\\{0,1\\}^{n}\\rightarrow\\{0,1\\} is said to be symmetric if its output depends only on the Hamming weight of its input. Motivated by this, in a recent result with Tripathi and Venkitesh , we gave a near-tight characterization on the probabilistic degree of every symmetric Boolean function. Unfortunately, however, our upper and lower bounds were separated by logarithmic factors. This can be crucial: in certain algorithmic applications (see, e.g., [4, Footnote, Page 138]), the appearance or non-appearance of an additional logarithmic factor in the degree can be the difference between (say) a truly subquadratic running time of N2−εsuperscript𝑁2𝜀N^{2-\\varepsilon} and a running time of N2−o​(1)superscript𝑁2𝑜1N^{2-o(1)}, which might be less interesting. In the case of characteristic 00 (or growing with n𝑛n), such gaps look hard to close since we don’t even understand completely the probabilistic degree of simple functions like the OR function 4 2 0. However, in positive (fixed) characteristic, there are no obvious barrriers. Yet, even in this case, the probabilistic degree of very simple symmetric Boolean functions like the Exact Threshold functions (functions that accept inputs of exactly one Hamming weight) remained unresolved until this paper. In this paper, we resolve this question and more. We are able to give a tight (up to constants) lower bound (matching the upper bounds in ) on the probabilistic degree of every symmetric function over fields of positive (fixed) characteristic. Robust version of Galvin’s problem: Given that Hegedűs’s lemma was used to solve Galvin’s problem, it is only natural that we consider the question of using the robust version to solve a robust version of Galvin’s problem. More precisely, we consider the minimum size m=m​(n,ε)𝑚𝑚𝑛𝜀m=m(n,\\varepsilon) to be the minimum size of a family ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} of (n/2)𝑛2(n/2)-sized subsets of [n]delimited-[]𝑛[n] such that for all but an ε𝜀\\varepsilon-fraction of sets S𝑆S of size n/2𝑛2n/2, there is a set T∈ℱ𝑇ℱT\\in\\mathcal{F} such that |S∩T|=n/4.𝑆𝑇𝑛4|S\\cap T|=n/4. Following the proof of Galvin’s theorem from Hegedűs’s lemma, we can prove a lower bound of Ω(nlog(1/ε))\\Omega(\\sqrt{n\\log(1/\\varepsilon})) for the above version of Galvin’s problem for any ε∈[2−n,1/2].𝜀superscript2𝑛12\\varepsilon\\in[2^{-n},1/2]. Note that this interpolates smoothly between a bound of Ω​(n)Ω𝑛\\Omega(\\sqrt{n}) for constant ε𝜀\\varepsilon and Ω​(n)Ω𝑛\\Omega(n) for ε=2−Ω​(n)𝜀superscript2Ω𝑛\\varepsilon=2^{-\\Omega(n)}, both of which are tight. For general ε𝜀\\varepsilon in between these two extremes, we do not know if our bounds are tight (we suspect they are). However, our bounds are tight for every ε𝜀\\varepsilon for a natural generalization of the above problem, where we allow intersections of any size (and not just n/4𝑛4n/4). We refer the reader to Section 4.3 for details. We observe that the main lemma (Lemma 1.2) is quite similar to classical polynomial approximation results of Razborov  and Smolensky   (see also ). The main difference is that while these results hold for polynomials approximating some function on the whole cube {0,1}nsuperscript01𝑛\\{0,1\\}^{n}, the lemma deals with polynomial approximations that are more ‘local’ in that they are restricted on just two layers of the cube. Nevertheless, we can show that the basic proof strategy of Smolensky (or more specifically a variant as in  9) can be used to prove our lemma as well. The main point of difference from these standard proofs is the employment of a result from discrete geometry due to Nie and Wang 5, that allows us to bound the size of the closure555The degree-D𝐷D closure clD​(E)subscriptcl𝐷𝐸\\mathrm{cl}_{D}(E) of a set E𝐸E is the set of points where any degree-D𝐷D polynomial Q𝑄Q vanishing throughout E𝐸E is forced to vanish. of a small set of points in the cube. This is a well-studied object in coding theory  and combinatorics 4 6 5, and turns out to be a crucial ingredient in our proof. For the application to the coin problem, we show that if a polynomial P𝑃P solves the coin problem (see Definition 4.1 for the formal definition of this), then it can be used to distinguish between Hamming weights k𝑘k and k+q𝑘𝑞k+q for k𝑘k and q𝑞q as in Lemma 1.2. This reduction is done by a simple sampling argument. The degree lower bound in Lemma 1.2 then implies the desired degree lower bound on the degree of P𝑃P. In the other applications to probabilistic degree and the robust version of Galvin’s problem, the idea is to follow the proofs of the previous best results in this direction and apply the main lemma at suitable points.
