Auditing Large Language Models for Race and Gender Bias\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLarge Language Models (LLM) have dramatically surged in popularity over the recent years. Since the release of ChatGPT, LLMs - especially those with an accessible chat interface - have not only been used by experts, but are also becoming an increasingly common tool with significant benefits for laypeople. To that end, many commercial actors have already begun implementing LLMs in their operations, ranging from customer-facing chatbots to internal decision support systems  . The fairness of AI algorithms, including LLMs, has been a pernicious issue, motivating a growing literature and community of AI ethics research . Disparities across gender and race, among other attributes, have especially preoccupied this field , leading to efforts to include bias auditing as an important component of AI harm mitigation in policy discussions and regulatory frameworks [ref]28. Mitigating biases arising from the explicit use of race or gender in the prompt is comparatively straightforward. For instance, popular models like GPT-4 often refuse to provide an answer when prompted to produce information about a hypothetical individual when given that individual’s race. Similarly, companies that have access to sensitive features of their customers may simply foreclose access to this information from the LLM. However, biases can materialize not only through the explicit use of sensitive characteristics, but also by utilizing features that are (strongly) correlated with a person’s protected attributes. The impact of these features can be harder to mitigate, because (1) their potential to cause disparate outcomes is often less salient, and (2) these features may contain information that otherwise improves the utility of the model. Among the potential candidates with these characteristics, we focus on an individual’s name as a feature of particular pertinence. Names strongly correlate with perceptions of race, raising the risk of creating significant disparities in model outputs, in turn harming marginalized communities. At the same time, in many practical applications, removing names might only come at a substantial cost. For instance, a chatbot that directly interacts with customers might significantly improve the experience via personalization if given access to the user’s name. In this study, we assess the name-sensitivity of the output produced by state-of-the-art language models. The names we choose are perceived to strongly correlate with race and/or gender, and we use direct model prompting as input to the models. Our assessment encompasses 42 idiosyncratic prompts. These prompts approximate use cases for 14 domains in which language models could be deployed to give advice to laypeople, such as in negotiations over the purchase of a car or in predicting election outcomes. We also assess how name-sensitivity interacts with the level of other useful information the model has access to in generating its output. We find significant disparities across names associated with race and gender in most scenarios we investigate, with varying effect sizes. The results are qualitatively similar across different models, including GPT-4, GPT-3.5 and PaLM-2. Overall, we find that names associated with white men yield the most beneficial predictions, while those associated with Black women generate outcomes that disadvantage the individual in question. Providing the model with qualitative context about the person has an inconsistent effect on biases, at times amplifying and at times decreasing observed disparities; while a numeric anchor effectively removes name-based disparities in most scenarios we investigate. Our findings also suggest that the observed disparities are the result of a systematic bias, rather than the result of a few name outliers. Overall, the results suggest that the model implicitly encodes common stereotypes, which in turn affects the model response. Because these stereotypes typically disadvantage the marginalized group, the advice given by the model does as well. Our findings suggest name-based differences commonly materialize into disparities to the disadvantage of women, Black communities, and in particular Black women. The biases are consistent with common stereotypes prevalent in the U.S. population. The findings show that despite efforts to mitigate biases and mount guardrails against disparate association with sensitive characteristics such as race and gender, LLMs encode biases that translate into disparate outcomes. Despite earlier concerns over bias, even the latest models, such as GPT-4, are not immune to this problem. Moreover, we show these name-based biases translate into disparate quantitative advice, effectively suggesting less favorable treatment of women and Black people. The findings raise concerns for businesses that seek to incorporate LLMs into their operations, suggesting that masking race and gender may not be enough to prevent unwanted disparities. The findings show that bias is pervasive and highlight the need for audits at the point of deployment and implementation, and not only at the development phase.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: other attributes, have especially preoccupied this field , leading to efforts to include bias auditing as an important component of AI harm mitigation in policy discussions and regulatory frameworks [ref]28.
