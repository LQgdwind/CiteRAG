      "content": "Paper Title: Unifying Sequent Systems for Gödel-Löb Provability Logic via Syntactic Transformations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nProvability logics are a class of modal logics where the □□\\Box operator is read as ‘it is provable that’ in some arithmetical theory. One of the most prominent provability logics is Gödel-Löb logic (𝖦𝖫𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{GL}), which arose out of the work of Löb, who formulated a set of conditions on the provability predicate of Peano Arithmetic (PA). The logic 𝖦𝖫𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{GL} can be axiomatized as an extension of the basic modal logic 𝖪𝖪\\mathsf{K} by the single axiom □​(□​φ→φ)→□​φ→□→□𝜑𝜑□𝜑\\Box(\\Box\\varphi\\rightarrow\\varphi)\\rightarrow\\Box\\varphi, called Löb’s axiom. It is well-known that the axioms of 𝖦𝖫𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{GL} are sound and complete relative to transitive and conversely-wellfounded relational models . In a landmark result, Solovay  remarkably showed that 𝖦𝖫𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{GL} is complete for PA’s provability logic, i.e., 𝖦𝖫𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{GL} proves everything that PA can prove about its own provability predicate. The logic 𝖦𝖫𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{GL} enjoys a rich structural proof theory, possessing a number of cut-free sequent-style systems. Sequent systems in the style of Gentzen were originally provided by Sambin and Valentini in the early 1980s  . (NB. In this work, we take a Gentzen system to be a proof system whose rules operate over Gentzen sequents, i.e., expressions of the form φ1,…,φn⊢ψ1,…,ψkprovessubscript𝜑1…subscript𝜑𝑛subscript𝜓1…subscript𝜓𝑘\\varphi_{1},\\ldots,\\varphi_{n}\\vdash\\psi_{1},\\ldots,\\psi_{k} such that φisubscript𝜑𝑖\\varphi_{i} and ψjsubscript𝜓𝑗\\psi_{j} are logical formulae.) Since then, a handful of alternative systems have been introduced, each of which either generalizes the structure of sequents or generalizes the notion of proof. The labeled sequent system 𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{G3GL} was provided by Negri  and uses labeled sequents in proofs, which are binary graphs whose nodes are Gentzen sequents. In a similar vein, the tree-hypersequent system 𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{CSGL} was provided by Poggiolesi  and uses tree-hypersequents in proofs, which are trees of whose nodes are Gentzen sequents. The use of (types of) graphs of Gentzen sequents in proofs (as in 𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{G3GL} and 𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{CSGL}) allows for the systems to possess properties beyond those of the original Gentzen systems  . For example, both 𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{G3GL} and 𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{CSGL} enjoy invertibility of all rules, rules are symmetric, which simplifies syntactic cut-elimination (cf. ), and the close connection between the syntax of sequents and 𝖦𝖫𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{GL}’s relational semantics makes such systems suitable for counter-model extraction. Rather than generalizing the structure of sequents, Shamkanov  showed that one could obtain alternative cut-free sequent systems for 𝖦𝖫𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{GL} by generalizing the structure of proofs. In particular, by taking the sequent calculus for the modal logic 𝖪𝟦𝖪𝟦\\mathsf{K4} and allowing for non-wellfounded proofs, one obtains a non-wellfounded sequent system 𝖦𝖫∞subscript𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{GL_{\\infty}} for 𝖦𝖫𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{GL}. Non-wellfounded proofs were introduced to capture (co)inductive reasoning, and are potentially infinite trees of sequents such that (1) every parent node is the conclusion of a rule with its children the corresponding premises and (2) infinite branches satisfy a certain progress condition, which ensures soundness (cf.    ). As non-wellfounded proofs are regular trees (i.e., only contain finitely many distinct sub-trees), such proofs can be ‘folded’ into finite trees of sequents such that leaves are ‘linked’ to internal nodes of the tree, giving rise to cyclic proofs (cf.    [ref]9). Shamkanov  additionally showed that one could obtain a cut-free cyclic sequent system 𝖦𝖫𝖼𝗂𝗋𝖼subscript𝖦𝖫𝖼𝗂𝗋𝖼\\mathsf{GL_{circ}} for 𝖦𝖫𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{GL} by allowing cyclic proofs in 𝖪𝟦𝖪𝟦\\mathsf{K4}’s sequent calculus, which was then used to provide the first syntactic proof of Lyndon interpolation for 𝖦𝖫𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{GL}. Due to the diversity in 𝖦𝖫𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{GL}’s proof theory, it is natural to wonder about the relationships between the various systems that have been introduced. Typically, proof systems are related means of proof transformations, which are functions that map proofs from one calculus into another, are sensitive to the structure of the input proof, and operate syntactically by permuting rules, replacing rules, or adding/deleting sequent structure in the input proof to yield the output proof. Studying proof transformations between sequent systems is a beneficial enterprise as it lets one transfer results from one system to another, thus alleviating the need of independent proofs in each system (e.g.,  4). Moreover, one can measure the relative sizes or certain characteristics of proofs, giving insight into which systems are better suited for specific (automated) reasoning tasks, and letting one ‘toogle’ between differing formalisms when one is better suited for a task than another (e.g., 3 2). Indeed, the question of the relationship between 𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{G3GL} and 𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{CSGL} was asked by Poggiolesi  and answered in full by Goré and Ramanayake 4, who provided constructive mappings of proofs between the two systems. Similarly, Shamkanov  provided syntactic mappings of proofs between the systems 𝖦𝖫∞subscript𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{GL_{\\infty}} and 𝖦𝖫𝖼𝗂𝗋𝖼subscript𝖦𝖫𝖼𝗂𝗋𝖼\\mathsf{GL_{circ}}, and the Gentzen system 𝖦𝖫𝗌𝖾𝗊subscript𝖦𝖫𝗌𝖾𝗊\\mathsf{GL_{seq}} (an equivalent reformulation of Sambin and Valentini’s systems  ). Nevertheless, the inter-translatability of proofs between former two structural sequent systems (𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{G3GL} and 𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{CSGL}) and the latter three sequent systems (𝖦𝖫𝗌𝖾𝗊subscript𝖦𝖫𝗌𝖾𝗊\\mathsf{GL_{seq}}, 𝖦𝖫∞subscript𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{GL_{\\infty}}, and 𝖦𝖫𝖼𝗂𝗋𝖼subscript𝖦𝖫𝖼𝗂𝗋𝖼\\mathsf{GL_{circ}}) has yet to be identified, and presents a non-trivial open problem that we solve in this paper. Thus, our first contribution in this paper is to ‘complete the picture’ and establish complete correspondences between the above five mentioned sequent systems by means of syntactic proof transformations. There is an inherent difficulty in transforming proofs that use structural sequents (e.g., labeled sequents or tree-hypersequents) into proofs that use Gentzen sequents. This is due to the fact that structural sequents are (types of) graphs of Gentzen sequents, and thus, possess a more complicated structure that must be properly ‘shed’ during proof transformations 2 5. To overcome this difficulty and define proof transformations from 𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{G3GL} and 𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{CSGL} to 𝖦𝖫𝗌𝖾𝗊subscript𝖦𝖫𝗌𝖾𝗊\\mathsf{GL_{seq}}, we rely on three techniques: first, we show how to restructure proofs in 𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{CSGL} so that they are end-active (cf. 0), meaning rules only affect data at leaves or parents of leaves in tree-hypersequents. Second, we introduce a novel linearization technique, whereby we show how to shed the tree structure of tree-hypersequents in end-active proofs, yielding a proof consisting solely of linear nested sequents 0, i.e., lines whose nodes are Gentzen sequents. Linear nested sequents were introduced as an alternative (albeit equivalent) formalism to 2-sequents 8 9 that allows for sequent systems with complexity-optimal proof-search that also retain fundamental admissibility and invertibility properties 0. The presented linearization technique is new and shows how to extract linear nested sequent systems from tree-hypersequent systems, serving as the second contribution of this paper. We conjecture that this method can be generalized and applied in other settings to provide new linear nested sequent systems for modal and related logics. The technique also yields the first (cut-free) linear nested sequent calculus for 𝖦𝖫𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{GL}, which we dub 𝖫𝖭𝖦𝖫𝖫𝖭𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{LNGL}, and which is the third contribution of this paper. Last, we show that proofs in 𝖫𝖭𝖦𝖫𝖫𝖭𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{LNGL} can be put into a specific normal form that repeats in stages of modal and local rules. Such proofs are translatable into 𝖦𝖫𝗌𝖾𝗊subscript𝖦𝖫𝗌𝖾𝗊\\mathsf{GL_{seq}} proofs, which are translatable into 𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{G3GL} proofs, thus establishing purely syntactic proof transformations between the most prominent sequent systems for 𝖦𝖫𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{GL}. These proof transformations and systemic correspondences are summarized in Figure 1 below. Outline of Paper. In Section 2, we recall the language, semantics, and axioms of Gödel-Löb logic. In Section 3, we discuss Negri’s labeled system 𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{G3GL} , Poggiolesi’s tree-hypersequent system 𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{CSGL} , and Goré and Ramanayake correspondence result for the two systems 4. In Section 4, we show how to put proofs in 𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{CSGL} into an end-active form (Theorem 4.6) and specify our novel linearization method (Theorem 4.7), which yields the new linear nested sequent system 𝖫𝖭𝖦𝖫𝖫𝖭𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{LNGL} for 𝖦𝖫𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{GL}. In Section 5, we recall the sequent calculus 𝖦𝖫𝗌𝖾𝗊subscript𝖦𝖫𝗌𝖾𝗊\\mathsf{GL_{seq}} due to Sambin and Valentini  , Shamkanov’s non-wellfounded system 𝖦𝖫∞subscript𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{GL_{\\infty}} and cyclic system 𝖦𝖫𝖼𝗂𝗋𝖼subscript𝖦𝖫𝖼𝗂𝗋𝖼\\mathsf{GL_{circ}}, as well as Shamkanov’s correspondence result for the aforementioned three systems . We then show how to transform proofs in 𝖫𝖭𝖦𝖫𝖫𝖭𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{LNGL} into proofs in 𝖦𝖫𝗌𝖾𝗊subscript𝖦𝖫𝗌𝖾𝗊\\mathsf{GL_{seq}} (Theorem 5.2) and how to transform proofs in 𝖦𝖫𝗌𝖾𝗊subscript𝖦𝖫𝗌𝖾𝗊\\mathsf{GL_{seq}} into proofs in 𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{G3GL} (Theorem 5.4). This establishes a six-way correspondence between the systems 𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫𝖦𝟥𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{G3GL}, 𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫𝖢𝖲𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{CSGL}, 𝖦𝖫𝗌𝖾𝗊subscript𝖦𝖫𝗌𝖾𝗊\\mathsf{GL_{seq}}, 𝖦𝖫∞subscript𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{GL_{\\infty}}, 𝖦𝖫𝖼𝗂𝗋𝖼subscript𝖦𝖫𝖼𝗂𝗋𝖼\\mathsf{GL_{circ}}, and 𝖫𝖭𝖦𝖫𝖫𝖭𝖦𝖫\\mathsf{LNGL} by means of syntactic transformations. Last, in Section 6, we conclude and discuss future work.
