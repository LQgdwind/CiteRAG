Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: CapHuman: Capture Your Moments in Parallel Universes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere has been significant advancement in the field of text-to-image synthesis. With the emergence of large-scale data collections such as LAION-5B  and the support of powerful computation resources, large generative models bloom in abundance. One of the pathways is driven by diffusion models. Diffusion models  are easily scalable without instability and mode collapse of adversarial training [ref]15. They have achieved amazing results in generating photo-realistic and content-rich images with high fidelity. Imagen [ref]34, GLIDE , and DALL-E 2 [ref]31 directly operate the denoising process in the pixel space. Instead, Stable Diffusion  performs it in the latent space to enable training under the limited resources scenarios while retaining the capability of high-quality image generation. Besides, some works research on auto-regressive modeling  or masked generative modeling . Recently, GigaGAN  has explored the potential of the traditional GAN framework  for large-scale training on the same large datasets and can synthesize high-resolution images as well.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: large generative models bloom in abundance.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
