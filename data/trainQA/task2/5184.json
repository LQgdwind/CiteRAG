      "content": "Paper Title: Equivalence Between SE(3) Equivariant Networks via Steerable Kernels and Group Convolution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo avoid any integrability problems in our definitions and theorems, we will assume functions and kernels are measurable, bounded and compactly supported in the rest of this work. In this section we recall the general definition of group convolution (3.1), show how it specializes to practical cases and introduce notations for convolutional layers and networks (3.2). Convolution is the cornerstone of Convolutional Neural Networks for image analysis popularized by the famous AlexNet . A key property of Euclidean convolution is translation equivariance, i.e. equivariance to the translation group ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑{\\mathbb{R}}^{d}. Indeed, it is well-known that convolution is the only linear operation that is translation-equivariant . This can be generalized to other groups by the notion of group convolution, and in particular the rotation groups SO​(3)SO3\\mathrm{SO}(3) and roto-translation group SE​(3)SE3\\mathrm{SE}(3). Group convolution offers a general methodology to design neural networks which are equivariant to a group action, e.g., for SO​(3)SO3\\mathrm{SO}(3)  or SE​(3)SE3\\mathrm{SE}(3) , among others. For a group G𝐺G, given an integrable function f𝑓f and kernel κ𝜅\\kappa, where both f,κ:G→ℝ:𝑓𝜅→𝐺ℝf,\\kappa:G\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}}, convolution on G𝐺G for a measure ν𝜈\\nu is defined as: The classical definition of G𝐺G-conv considers a uniform measure (also called Haar measure) which is invariant by the action of G𝐺G (see the survey of Esteves  for a quick introduction and to Haar measures and   for more details). We explicitly highlight the role of the measure ν𝜈\\nu, as it becomes important in our discussion of discretization and specifically, point cloud convolution. We recall that the action of the group G𝐺G on a function κ:G→ℝ:𝜅→𝐺ℝ\\kappa:G\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}} is defined via the action of G𝐺G on its input: (y.κ)(x):=κ(y−1⋅x)(y.\\kappa)(x):=\\kappa(y^{-1}\\cdot x). Similarly the action of h∈Gℎ𝐺h\\in G on a measure ν𝜈\\nu over G𝐺G is defined for any measurable subset S⊆G𝑆𝐺S\\subseteq G by (h.ν)(S):=ν(h−1⋅S)(h.\\nu)(S):=\\nu(h^{-1}\\cdot S). It is well-known (see Section B.1 in the supplementary material for a proof) that G𝐺G-convolution is equivariant to these actions. Group convolution satisfies the following equiavriance property for any group element h∈Gℎ𝐺h\\in G and functions f,g:G→ℝ:𝑓𝑔→𝐺ℝf,g:G\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}}:\n(h.f)∗h.νg=h.(f∗νg)(h.f)\\ast_{h.\\nu}g=h.(f\\ast_{\\nu}g) In other words, acting on the input of the convolution and the underlying measure by a group element hℎh is equivalent to acting on the output by the same element hℎh. When ν𝜈\\nu is Haar the equivariance property simplifies and we can ignore the action on the measure as it is invariant. In  Kondor and Trivedi show that a linear map between functions on a compact group is equivariant iff it is convolutional. Cohen et al show this results for uni-modular groups under reasonable assumptions  . Setting G=ℝd𝐺superscriptℝ𝑑G={\\mathbb{R}}^{d} and ν𝜈\\nu to be the Lebesgue measure of ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑{\\mathbb{R}}^{d} we recover the classical notion of convolution f∗ℝd,νκ​(x)=∫ℝdf​(t)​g​(x−t)​𝑑tsubscript∗superscriptℝ𝑑𝜈𝑓𝜅𝑥subscriptsuperscriptℝ𝑑𝑓𝑡𝑔𝑥𝑡differential-d𝑡f\\ast_{{\\mathbb{R}}^{d},\\nu}\\kappa(x)=\\int_{{\\mathbb{R}}^{d}}f(t)g(x-t)dt. Euclidean convolution can be adapted to the case of discrete point clouds where the input signal is only defined on the given set of points X⊂ℝ3𝑋superscriptℝ3X\\subset{\\mathbb{R}}^{3}. This can be formalized by setting G=ℝd𝐺superscriptℝ𝑑G={\\mathbb{R}}^{d} and ν=δX:=∑iδXi𝜈subscript𝛿𝑋assignsubscript𝑖subscript𝛿subscript𝑋𝑖\\nu=\\delta_{X}:=\\sum_{i}\\delta_{X_{i}} the sum of Dirac measures at points of X𝑋X. We then have f∗ℝ3,δXκ​(Xi)=∑jf​(Xj)​κ​(Xi−Xj)subscript∗superscriptℝ3subscript𝛿𝑋𝑓𝜅subscript𝑋𝑖subscript𝑗𝑓subscript𝑋𝑗𝜅subscript𝑋𝑖subscript𝑋𝑗f\\ast_{{\\mathbb{R}}^{3},\\delta_{X}}\\kappa(X_{i})=\\sum_{j}f(X_{j})\\kappa(X_{i}-X_{j}). Note that a rotation of δXsubscript𝛿𝑋\\delta_{X} is equivalent to a rotation of X𝑋X, for all R∈SO​(3)𝑅SO3R\\in\\mathrm{SO}(3) we have R.δX=δR.Xformulae-sequence𝑅subscript𝛿𝑋subscript𝛿formulae-sequence𝑅𝑋R.\\delta_{X}=\\delta_{R.X} (see\nSection B.3 for a proof). This is a practical approach as the convolution only depends of values of f𝑓f and κ𝜅\\kappa on X𝑋X which can be stored in matrices. Multiple works investigate this idea [ref]30 [ref]31    [ref]35 (see also Sec. 3.3.2. in ). The main variations consist in developing methods to compensate biases induced by non-uniform or uneven sampling. Some works like [ref]30 normalize the signals, others use Monte Carlo integration with re-sampling [ref]31 and others learn the kernel functions themselves in addition to the weights [ref]35. SO​(3)SO3\\mathrm{SO}(3)-convolution is generally defined using the Haar measure of SO​(3)SO3\\mathrm{SO}(3) (the volume measure of SO​(3)SO3\\mathrm{SO}(3)) which we denote by μ𝜇\\mu (see Section A.2 of the appendix of   for more details). We have f∗SO​(3),νθ​(R):=∫SO​(3)f​(H)​θ​(H−1​R)​𝑑μ​(H)assignsubscript∗SO3𝜈𝑓𝜃𝑅subscriptSO3𝑓𝐻𝜃superscript𝐻1𝑅differential-d𝜇𝐻f\\ast_{\\mathrm{SO}(3),\\nu}\\theta(R):=\\int_{\\mathrm{SO}(3)}f(H)\\theta(H^{-1}R)d\\mu(H). Recall that the roto-translation group SE​(3)=ℝ3⋊SO​(3)SE3right-normal-factor-semidirect-productsuperscriptℝ3SO3\\mathrm{SE}(3)={\\mathbb{R}}^{3}\\rtimes\\mathrm{SO}(3) is the semi-direct product of the translation group ℝ3superscriptℝ3{\\mathbb{R}}^{3} and the rotation group SO​(3)SO3\\mathrm{SO}(3), and its composition law is given by:\n(x,U).(y,V)=(U​y+x,U​V),(t,H)−1:=(H−1,−H−1​t)formulae-sequence𝑥𝑈formulae-sequence𝑦𝑉𝑈𝑦𝑥𝑈𝑉assignsuperscript𝑡𝐻1superscript𝐻1superscript𝐻1𝑡(x,U).(y,V)=(Uy+x,UV),\\ \\ (t,H)^{-1}:=(H^{-1},-H^{-1}t). We set ν=λ⊗μ𝜈tensor-product𝜆𝜇\\nu=\\lambda\\otimes\\mu where λ𝜆\\lambda is either the Lebesgue measure of ℝ3superscriptℝ3{\\mathbb{R}}^{3} in the continuous case or λ=δX𝜆subscript𝛿𝑋\\lambda=\\delta_{X} for a point cloud X𝑋X, extending the notion of point cloud convolution to SE​(3)SE3\\mathrm{SE}(3). We have: \n(f∗SE​(3),λ⊗μg)​(x,R):=∫ℝ3∫SO​(3)f​(t,H)​g​(H−1​(x−t),H−1​R)​𝑑μ​(H)​𝑑λ​(t)assignsubscript∗SE3tensor-product𝜆𝜇𝑓𝑔𝑥𝑅subscriptsuperscriptℝ3subscriptSO3𝑓𝑡𝐻𝑔superscript𝐻1𝑥𝑡superscript𝐻1𝑅differential-d𝜇𝐻differential-d𝜆𝑡(f\\ast_{\\mathrm{SE}(3),\\lambda\\otimes\\mu}g)(x,R):=\\int_{{\\mathbb{R}}^{3}}\\int_{\\mathrm{SO}(3)}f(t,H)g(H^{-1}(x-t),H^{-1}R)d\\mu(H)d\\lambda(t). Note that in practice cross-correlation is often preferred over convolution for Euclidean domains. Cross-correlation can be obtained from convolution by negating the input of the kernel, replacing κ𝜅\\kappa by :x↦κ​(−x):absentmaps-to𝑥𝜅𝑥:x\\mapsto\\kappa(-x). In this work we refer to both as convolution as our analysis applies to both notions. The notion of Group Convolutional Neural Network naturally extends the classical definition by replacing usual convolution by group convolution: Given a group G𝐺G endowed with a measure λ𝜆\\lambda, a G𝐺G-convolutional layer (G𝐺G-conv) of kernels (κj:G→ℝ)j(\\kappa_{j}:G\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}})_{j}, weights tensor W𝑊W and bias vector b𝑏b takes a family of functions (fi:G→ℝ)i(f_{i}:G\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}})_{i} and a measure ν𝜈\\nu and outputs the family of functions on G𝐺G defined by: A G𝐺G-Convolutional Neural Network (G𝐺G-CNN) consists in stacking G𝐺G-conv layers. It takes a family of functions f𝑓f over G𝐺G and is defined recursively by: where ξ:ℝ→ℝ:𝜉→ℝℝ\\xi:{\\mathbb{R}}\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}} is an activation function. G𝐺G-CNNs satisfy the same equivariance property as their layers, we provide a proof in Section B.2: A G𝐺G-CNN (or G𝐺G-conv layer) satisfies the equivariance property:\nCNNG(g.f,g.ν,W,b)=g.CNNG(f,ν,W,b)\\mathrm{CNN}_{G}(g.f,g.\\nu,W,b)=g.\\mathrm{CNN}_{G}(f,\\nu,W,b)\nfor all g∈G𝑔𝐺g\\in G.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: (see\nSection B.3 for a proof).
