In this paper we generalize the\nsmallest k𝑘k-enclosing disc\nproblem to simple polygons using the geodesic metric.\nThis means the Euclidean distance function has been replaced by the\ngeodesic distance function.\nThe geodesic distance between two points a𝑎a and b𝑏b\nin a simple polygon P𝑃P is the length\nof the shortest path between a𝑎a and b𝑏b that lies completely inside\nP𝑃P.\nWhen P𝑃P is a simple polygon with a finite set of vertices,\na shortest path from a𝑎a to b𝑏b in P𝑃P is a polyline whose length is\nthe sum of the Euclidean lengths of its edges.\nLet this shortest path starting at a𝑎a and ending at b𝑏b be\ndenoted Π​(a,b)Π𝑎𝑏\\Pi(a,b) and let its length be denoted\nas dg​(a,b)subscript𝑑𝑔𝑎𝑏d_{g}(a,b).\nFor any two points a𝑎a and b𝑏b of P𝑃P, the vertices\non Π​(a,b)Π𝑎𝑏\\Pi(a,b) are either a𝑎a, b𝑏b, or reflex vertices of P𝑃P\n  [ref]37.\nA geodesic disc D​(c,ρ)𝐷𝑐𝜌D(c,\\rho)\nof radius ρ𝜌\\rho centred at c∈P𝑐𝑃c\\in P is the set of all points\nin P𝑃P whose geodesic distance to c𝑐c is at most ρ𝜌\\rho.\nThe main focus of our article is the following problem.

We make the general position assumptions that no two points of S𝑆S are\nequidistant to a vertex of Pi​nsubscript𝑃𝑖𝑛P_{in}, and no four points of S𝑆S are\ngeodesically co-circular.\nUnder these assumptions, a SKEG disc contains\nexactly k𝑘k points.\nLet D​(c∗,ρ∗)𝐷superscript𝑐superscript𝜌D(c^{*},\\rho^{*}) be a SKEG disc for the\npoints of S𝑆S in Pi​nsubscript𝑃𝑖𝑛P_{in}.\nFor convenience, at times we will refer to this as simply D∗superscript𝐷D^{*}.
