      "content": "Paper Title: Institutionalising Ethics in AI through Broader Impact Requirements\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe now identify a number of causes for these potential negative effects, which in turn will allow us to develop a list of tentative suggestions for conference organisers and the community at large. The complexity and difficulty of the task. Foreseeing the downstream uses of AI research, especially foundational research, is notoriously difficult. This is particularly relevant for general purpose technologies like machine learning (ML), in which one technique may be applicable to a broad range of potential applications. Anticipating the societal impacts of those applications is even more challenging, even for social scientists and ethicists\nwho have specialised in the task   . In contrast to social scientists, however, computer scientists typically have not received the relevant training that would allow them to address the complexity and nuances behind impact anticipation, nor can they be expected to be as familiar with the relevant literature. Lack of best practice and guidance. There is currently no established best practice for writing impact statements. The experiment by Owen and Goldberg discussed above demonstrates the importance of guidance for researchers . Numerous studies that show high variance in IRB approval, as well as the mentioned ACM SIGCOMM 2015 incident, illustrate the importance of having clear guidelines and benchmarks that (a) help researchers to write adequate statements, and (b) allow for adequate and consistent assessments    . Lack of explanation of purpose. Currently, little explanation has been provided regarding the precise purpose and motivation of these statements. For example, whether the aim is to raise awareness, to anticipate impacts, to identify potentially unethical research, to encourage reflection or discussion, to motivate researchers to take responsibility, or any combination of the above. Such lack of clarity may dampen motivation, and lead to confusion. Clarity of purpose is also required to understand whether the initiative is meeting its aims. Lack of procedural transparency and justice. Transparency of procedures regarding the evaluation of impact statements, and how they relate to the ethical review process and acceptance decisions can help set expectations and create accountability for the process. Lack of transparency, on the other hand, as well as procedural injustice which causes decisions to be perceived as being influenced by bias, political opinions, or prejudice, may not only lead to inadequate evaluation, but also to growing resistance amongst researchers . High opportunity costs. Writing a high quality impact statement takes time. Researchers routinely experience a substantial amount of pressure to deliver high-quality research articles under tight conference deadlines. If there is a trade-off between working on a research article and the broader impact statement, it is likely that researchers will opt for the first, especially when the broader impact statement does not substantially affect conference admission. Institutional and social pressure. Researchers may experience pressure—psychological, social, or institutional—to primarily emphasise the benefits of their work rather than potential downsides. Indeed, only emphasising the potential upsides of one’s research is already standard practice . As a result, researchers may be incentivised to focus on minor risks or those that do not threaten their own or their organisation’s interests. Researchers working in a commercial setting might be particularly affected, as their employers have incentives to downplay certain risks to save commercial interests or prevent legal liabilities. It has been noted that corporations have an incentive to reframe ethics discussions in such a way that they do not challenge how the firm operates in any significant way . This is of increasing significance as the number of papers from corporate affiliations increases over time . Cognitive and social biases. Cognitive and social biases may affect authors and referees of broader impact statements. Phenomena such as motivated reasoning may lead to gaps or belittlement of risks . Several other biases, such as the framing effect , ambiguity effect , or confirmation bias [ref]55, may similarly affect the quality and the comprehensiveness of impact statements.\n\nReference markers found: [55]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]55: impact statements. Phenomena such as motivated reasoning may lead to gaps or belittlement of risks . Several other biases, such as the framing effect , ambiguity effect , or confirmation bias [ref]55, may similarly affect the quality and the comprehensiveness of impact statements.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
