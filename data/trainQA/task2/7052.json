      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Pauli channel estimation with logarithmic quantum memory\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe now consider learning Pauli channels in the online learning setting. The basic concepts of online learning, mistake bounds, and regrets are introduced in Section 3.4. As defined in 1, given a Pauli channel Λ​(⋅)=I​Tr⁡(⋅)+∑aλa​Pa​Tr⁡(Pa​(⋅))2nΛ⋅𝐼Tr⋅subscript𝑎subscript𝜆𝑎subscript𝑃𝑎Trsubscript𝑃𝑎⋅superscript2𝑛\\Lambda(\\cdot)=\\frac{I\\operatorname{Tr}(\\cdot)+\\sum_{a}\\lambda_{a}P_{a}\\operatorname{Tr}(P_{a}(\\cdot))}{2^{n}}, the goal of the learner is to learn all the eigenvalues λasubscript𝜆𝑎\\lambda_{a} within accuracy demand ε𝜀\\varepsilon. In iteration t𝑡t of the online learning scheme, the learner is given an index at∈{1,…,4n−1}subscript𝑎𝑡1…superscript4𝑛1a_{t}\\in\\{1,...,4^{n}-1\\} and is required to output a hypothesis Pauli channel (prediction) The learner then obtains feedback bt∈ subscript𝑏𝑡01b_{t}\\in  with |bt−λat|≤ε2subscript𝑏𝑡subscript𝜆subscript𝑎𝑡subscript𝜀2\\absolutevalue{b_{t}-\\lambda_{a_{t}}}\\leq\\varepsilon_{2} for some 0≤ε2≤ε≤10subscript𝜀2𝜀10\\leq\\varepsilon_{2}\\leq\\varepsilon\\leq 1. The learner then suffers from a L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} loss equal to It is straightforward to observe that this L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} loss function is L𝐿L Lipschitz. The regret for the first T𝑇T iterations is computed by: for some optimal Λ^=I​Tr⁡(⋅)+∑a=14n−1λ^a​Pa​Tr⁡(Pa​(⋅))2n^Λ𝐼Tr⋅superscriptsubscript𝑎1superscript4𝑛1subscript^𝜆𝑎subscript𝑃𝑎Trsubscript𝑃𝑎⋅superscript2𝑛\\hat{\\Lambda}=\\frac{I\\operatorname{Tr}(\\cdot)+\\sum_{a=1}^{4^{n}-1}\\hat{\\lambda}_{a}P_{a}\\operatorname{Tr}(P_{a}(\\cdot))}{2^{n}}. After receiving the feedback, the learner computes the loss function ℓt​(Λ^t)subscriptℓ𝑡subscript^Λ𝑡\\ell_{t}(\\hat{\\Lambda}_{t}). The learner then performs an update procedure on the hypothesis channel Λ^t→Λ^t+1→subscript^Λ𝑡subscript^Λ𝑡1\\hat{\\Lambda}_{t}\\to\\hat{\\Lambda}_{t+1} if the loss function ℓt​(Λ^t)subscriptℓ𝑡subscript^Λ𝑡\\ell_{t}(\\hat{\\Lambda}_{t}) is larger than a certain threshold. As the learner, we use the techniques from online convex optimization to minimize regret. The number of “bad iterations” t𝑡t in which the hypothesis channel is tested to be far away from the true channel can also be bounded via minimizing the regret. For state learning tasks, Ref.  proposed several online learning update methods in the setting of state learning including the Regularized Follow-the-Leader algorithm (RFTL)  [ref]42, the Matrix Multiplicative Weights algorithm  [ref]8, and the sequential fat-shattering dimension of\nquantum states . Some offline algorithms    are also proposed for a similar update procedure. Here, we follow the template of the RFTL using the regularization function of (negative) von Neumann entropy for the Choi–Jamiołkowski isomorphism ρCJ​(Λ)subscript𝜌CJΛ\\rho_{\\text{CJ}}(\\Lambda) state of the Pauli channel ΛΛ\\Lambda in the extended Hilbert space defined in (4). That is to say. given a Pauli channel ΛΛ\\Lambda, the regularized function is where λisubscript𝜆𝑖\\lambda_{i} denotes the i𝑖i-th eigenvalue of the matrix. The full algorithm is provided below in Algorithm 5: Before analyzing the performance, we first consider the correctness of this RFTL algorithm. We can observe that the mathematical program is convex. The basic idea for this online Pauli channel estimation is to employ the Choi–Jamiołkowski isomorphism to map the Pauli channel into a 2​n2𝑛2n-qubit state. According to Ref. , the minimizer in the last step is always positive semidefinite in the state learning setting, which also guarantees the correctness of our algorithm. Now, we consider the regret bound of Algorithm 5. We suppose there are in total T𝑇T iterations where the learner performs an update procedure. We have the following lemma: By setting η=O​(n/T)𝜂𝑂𝑛𝑇\\eta=O(\\sqrt{n/T}) for some suitable constant coefficient, we can bound the regret RTsubscript𝑅𝑇R_{T} of Algorithm 5 by By theorem 5.2 of Ref. [ref]42, we can bound the regret of Algorithm 5 by by choosing some η=O​(DR/(GR​T))𝜂𝑂subscript𝐷𝑅subscript𝐺𝑅𝑇\\eta=O(D_{R}/(G_{R}\\sqrt{T})), where Notice that R​(⋅)𝑅⋅R(\\cdot) is the von Neumann entropy for a 2​n2𝑛2n-qubit quantum state, it is bounded by 2​n​log⁡2=O​(n)2𝑛2𝑂𝑛2n\\log 2=O(n). As the loss function ℓt​(⋅)subscriptℓ𝑡⋅\\ell_{t}(\\cdot) is L=1𝐿1L=1-Lipschitz, we can bound ‖∇t‖op≤O​(1)subscriptnormsubscript∇𝑡op𝑂1\\norm{\\nabla_{t}}_{\\text{op}}\\leq O(1) according to its definition in (30). Therefore, we have when we choose some η=O​(n/T)𝜂𝑂𝑛𝑇\\eta=O(\\sqrt{n/T}). This finishes the proof for Lemma 7.\n∎ Finally, we bound the number of iterations where we invode the update algorithm. We consider running the update algorithm in Algorithm 5 when the loss function ℓt​(λ^at,t)=|bt−λ^at,t|>ε1−ε2subscriptℓ𝑡subscript^𝜆subscript𝑎𝑡𝑡subscript𝑏𝑡subscript^𝜆subscript𝑎𝑡𝑡subscript𝜀1subscript𝜀2\\ell_{t}(\\hat{\\lambda}_{a_{t},t})=\\absolutevalue{b_{t}-\\hat{\\lambda}_{a_{t},t}}>\\varepsilon_{1}-\\varepsilon_{2} for some 0≤ε2≤ε1≤ε≤10subscript𝜀2subscript𝜀1𝜀10\\leq\\varepsilon_{2}\\leq\\varepsilon_{1}\\leq\\varepsilon\\leq 1. By the definition of btsubscript𝑏𝑡b_{t}, |bt−λat,t|≤ε2subscript𝑏𝑡subscript𝜆subscript𝑎𝑡𝑡subscript𝜀2\\absolutevalue{b_{t}-\\lambda_{a_{t},t}}\\leq\\varepsilon_{2}. Given the regret bound in Lemma 7, we consider the true Pauli channel ΛΛ\\Lambda as the hypothesis. As |bt−λat,t|≤ε2subscript𝑏𝑡subscript𝜆subscript𝑎𝑡𝑡subscript𝜀2\\absolutevalue{b_{t}-\\lambda_{a_{t},t}}\\leq\\varepsilon_{2}, the sum of loss function over all iterations t=1,…,T𝑡1…𝑇t=1,...,T in this case is bounded above by ε2​Tsubscript𝜀2𝑇\\varepsilon_{2}T. Then, given an arbitrary online learning procedure with T𝑇T iterations, the regret is bounded below by Ω​((ε1−ε2)​T)Ωsubscript𝜀1subscript𝜀2𝑇\\Omega((\\varepsilon_{1}-\\varepsilon_{2})T). According to the regret bound, we have which directly indicates that Thus, we formally have the below lemma: Suppose the learner is given feedback btsubscript𝑏𝑡b_{t} such that |bt−λat,t|≤ε2subscript𝑏𝑡subscript𝜆subscript𝑎𝑡𝑡subscript𝜀2\\absolutevalue{b_{t}-\\lambda_{a_{t},t}}\\leq\\varepsilon_{2} in each iteration and invoke the RFTL update procedure if ℓt​(λ^at,t)=|bt−λ^at,t|>ε1−ε2subscriptℓ𝑡subscript^𝜆subscript𝑎𝑡𝑡subscript𝑏𝑡subscript^𝜆subscript𝑎𝑡𝑡subscript𝜀1subscript𝜀2\\ell_{t}(\\hat{\\lambda}_{a_{t},t})=\\absolutevalue{b_{t}-\\hat{\\lambda}_{a_{t},t}}>\\varepsilon_{1}-\\varepsilon_{2}. We choose the parameters Then the number of iterations T𝑇T where the update the procedure is used is bounded above by\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: minimizing the regret.
