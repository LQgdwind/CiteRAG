      "content": "Paper Title: GFlowCausal: Generative Flow Networks for Causal Discovery\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUncovering causal relations from observational data is a burgeoning topic in machine learning and artificial intelligence, which has various applications such as biology  and genetics . Some work formulates this causal discovery task as exploring a directed acyclic graphs (DAG) that could most represent the causal relationship from observational or experimental data  . Even though some notable works are reluctant to treat graphs learned from observational data as causal  , or consider ignoring the possibility of cycles will potentially introduce bias , it is still a common and worthwhile aim to begin with such well-known class. With certain assumptions, causal structure is fully or partially identifiable. For example, if one assumes the distribution is entailed by a structural equation model, then such graph is identifiable with mutual independence of noises and some mild regularity conditions [ref]8 . Depending on the way to solve, causal discovery can be categorized into four different classes: constraint-based 0 , score-based 1 2, structural asymmetry-based 3 and intervention-based . Most constraint-based approaches test for conditional independencies in the empirical joint distribution, while they require large sample sizes to be reliable. For example, PC  0 and Greedy Equivalence Search (GES)  rely on local heuristics for searching. Intervention-based approaches  talk about that if interventional data are available, we are able to reduce the number of graphs in the markov equivalence class. Structural asymmetry-based tests the direction of edges between each pair of nodes 3. Score-based aims to compute a score on each graph over the observed data, and then search for DAGs with the best score.\nHowever, searching for DAGs is known to be NP-hard  due to its combinatorial nature with acyclicity constraints and super-exponentially growing in the number of graphs. NOTEARS 1 firstly casts this problem into a continuous constrained one with the least-squares objective for linear models. Subsequently a flurry of developments in continuous optimization approaches includes DAG-GNN 4, NO FEARS 5, and GraN-DAG . Without violating some general assumptions, optimal ordering learning problems are adopted to guarantee the significantly smaller search space and avoid acyclicity constraints 6. As another attempt, some research takes the strong searching ability of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for causal discovery. For example, RL-BIC 2 utilizes predefined score functions and find the underlying DAG . Nevertheless, due to the large search space and inefficient acyclicity constraints, most searching approaches do not handle large-scale settings and get stuck on local optimum. Furthermore, CORL 7 considers to take advantage of the reduced space of variable orderings, to make RL approach perform better than other gradient-based methods that directly optimize the same score function. Recently, Generative Flow Network based approach DAG-GFlowNet is proposed by 8, which treats the generation of a sample as a sequential decision problem and use flow matching conditions to train a model, thus modeling the posterior distribution over DAGs. However, the trajectory length and loss objective matter in computational complexity and DAG-GFlowNet may not able to achieve a close performance than others in beyesian structure learning. In this paper, we consider DAG learning task in causal discovery, and take advantage of Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to cast the searching problem into the generation problem. Instead of directly searching DAGs and evaluating them, our idea is to gradually add a direct edge between each pair of two nodes, until a desired graph is generated. We call this approach GFlowCausal, which could generate diverse DAGs by sequential actions with probabilities proportional to a predefined reward function. Our GFlowCausal could overcome the current predicament for the following reasons. First, it aims to learn the best policy to generate diverse high reward DAGs based on the flow matching condition, different from other searching or optimizing problems. This helps to avoid getting stuck in a sub-optimal situation. Second, with a strong exploration ability, GFlowCausal could be applied in a large scale setting and obtain convergence fast. Moreover, GFlowCausal defines allowed actions to ensure acyclicity in every state transition based on matrix calculations and reduce the computational complexity significantly to 𝒪​(1)𝒪1\\mathcal{O}(1) per operation.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: For example, if one assumes the distribution is entailed by a structural equation model, then such graph is identifiable with mutual independence of noises and some mild regularity conditions [ref]8 .
