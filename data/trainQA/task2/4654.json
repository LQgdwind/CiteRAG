Next we recall the required assumptions for MMLS algorithm, when applied to noiseless data: ℳ∈C2ℳsuperscript𝐶2{\\mathcal{M}}\\in C^{2} is a closed (i.e.,\ncompact and boundaryless) d𝑑d-dimensional submanifold of ℝDsuperscriptℝ𝐷\\mathbb{R}^{D}.\nThe sample set S={𝐫i}i=1n⊂ℳ𝑆superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝐫𝑖𝑖1𝑛ℳS=\\{{\\mathbf{r}}_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{n}\\subset{\\mathcal{M}} is a quasi-unifom\nsample set with respect to the domain ℳℳ{\\mathcal{M}}, with fill distance\nhℎh. With these assumption, it is possible to perform MMLS approximation\nof ℳℳ{\\mathcal{M}}. In [ref]37, Sober and Levin proposed\nusing the technique of MLS for approximating submanifolds\nin ℝDsuperscriptℝ𝐷\\mathbb{R}^{D}. Given a point 𝐫∈ℝD𝐫superscriptℝ𝐷{\\mathbf{r}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D} close enough to ℳℳ{\\mathcal{M}}\n(see Assumption 8), MMLS projection\nis performed in two steps: Approximate the sampled points via a local d𝑑d-dimensional affine\nspace (𝐪​(𝐫),H​(𝐫))𝐪𝐫𝐻𝐫({\\mathbf{q}}({\\mathbf{r}}),H({\\mathbf{r}})), where H​(𝐫)𝐻𝐫H({\\mathbf{r}}) is a linear space and the origin\nis set to 𝐪​(𝐫)𝐪𝐫{\\mathbf{q}}({\\mathbf{r}}). Explicitly, H​(𝐫)=𝐒𝐩𝐚𝐧​{𝐞k}k=1d𝐻𝐫𝐒𝐩𝐚𝐧superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝐞𝑘𝑘1𝑑H({\\mathbf{r}})={\\bf Span}\\{{\\mathbf{e}}_{k}\\}_{k=1}^{d}\n(an element in the d𝑑d-dimensional Grassmanian of ℝDsuperscriptℝ𝐷\\mathbb{R}^{D}, denoted\nby Gr​(d,D)Gr𝑑𝐷\\text{Gr}(d,D)) where {𝐞k}k=1dsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝐞𝑘𝑘1𝑑\\{{\\mathbf{e}}_{k}\\}_{k=1}^{d} is an orthonormal\nbasis of H​(𝐫)𝐻𝐫H({\\mathbf{r}}), and the affine space is {𝐪​(𝐫)+𝐡|𝐡∈H​(𝐫)}conditional-set𝐪𝐫𝐡𝐡𝐻𝐫\\{{\\mathbf{q}}({\\mathbf{r}})+{\\mathbf{h}}\\,|\\,{\\mathbf{h}}\\in H({\\mathbf{r}})\\}. The\naffine space is used as a local coordinates system for the second\nstep. Define the projection 𝐫𝐫{\\mathbf{r}} via a local polynomial approximation g:H​(𝐫)≌ℝd→ℝD:𝑔≌𝐻𝐫superscriptℝ𝑑→superscriptℝ𝐷g:H({\\mathbf{r}})\\backsimeq\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{D}\n(of total degree m𝑚m) of ℳℳ{\\mathcal{M}} over the new coordinate system\nspanning H​(𝐫)𝐻𝐫H({\\mathbf{r}}), i.e., the projection is defined by 𝒫mh​(𝐫)≔g​(𝟎)≔superscriptsubscript𝒫𝑚ℎ𝐫𝑔0{\\mathcal{P}}_{m}^{h}({\\mathbf{r}})\\coloneqq g({\\mathbf{0}}).\nThe approximation is achieved as follows: denote by 𝐪isubscript𝐪𝑖{\\mathbf{q}}_{i} the orthogonal\nprojections of 𝐫i−𝐪​(𝐫)subscript𝐫𝑖𝐪𝐫{\\mathbf{r}}_{i}-{\\mathbf{q}}({\\mathbf{r}}) onto H​(𝐫)𝐻𝐫H({\\mathbf{r}}), then g𝑔g is a polynomial\napproximation of the vector valued function φ𝐫​(⋅):H​(𝐫)→ℳ:subscript𝜑𝐫⋅→𝐻𝐫ℳ\\varphi_{{\\mathbf{r}}}(\\cdot):H({\\mathbf{r}})\\to{\\mathcal{M}}\nwith the samples φ𝐫​(𝐪i)=𝐫isubscript𝜑𝐫subscript𝐪𝑖subscript𝐫𝑖\\varphi_{{\\mathbf{r}}}({\\mathbf{q}}_{i})={\\mathbf{r}}_{i}, which is found by solving a weighted\nleast-squares problem. Note that φ𝐫​(⋅)subscript𝜑𝐫⋅\\varphi_{{\\mathbf{r}}}(\\cdot) is a function which takes as an input orthogonal projections of points on ℳℳ{\\mathcal{M}} deflected by 𝐪​(𝐫)𝐪𝐫{\\mathbf{q}}({\\mathbf{r}}) on H​(𝐫)𝐻𝐫H({\\mathbf{r}}), and returns the pre-projected points. Thus, in a small neighborhood of 𝐪​(𝐫)𝐪𝐫{\\mathbf{q}}({\\mathbf{r}}), the function φ𝐫​(⋅)subscript𝜑𝐫⋅\\varphi_{{\\mathbf{r}}}(\\cdot) is unique. To keep notation concise, we omit the subscripts from φ𝐫​(⋅)subscript𝜑𝐫⋅\\varphi_{{\\mathbf{r}}}(\\cdot), i.e., φ​(⋅)𝜑⋅\\varphi(\\cdot), where the subscript can be concluded from the domain of φ​(⋅)𝜑⋅\\varphi(\\cdot). This approach approximates the manifold ℳℳ{\\mathcal{M}} via an approximation\nof some local parametrization φ𝜑\\varphi of it, i.e., an inverse map of a\ncoordinate chart. Another view of the aforementioned approach is as follows. A smooth d𝑑d-dimensional manifold\nℳℳ{\\mathcal{M}} can be viewed locally as a graph of a function from a\nd𝑑d-dimensional space to a (D−d)𝐷𝑑(D-d)-dimensional space; see [4, Lemma A.12]\nfor the local existence of such a representation of ℳℳ{\\mathcal{M}} as\na graph of a function from H​(𝐫)𝐻𝐫H({\\mathbf{r}}) to H⟂​(𝐫)superscript𝐻perpendicular-to𝐫H^{\\perp}({\\mathbf{r}}). In that view, as mentioned in\n[37, Remark 3.8] and explicitly performed in\n[4, Algorithm 2], the aforementioned approximation is equivalent to finding a local polynomial approximation g:H​(𝐫)≌ℝd→H⟂​(𝐫)≌ℝD−d:𝑔≌𝐻𝐫superscriptℝ𝑑→superscript𝐻perpendicular-to𝐫≌superscriptℝ𝐷𝑑g:H({\\mathbf{r}})\\backsimeq\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\to H^{\\perp}({\\mathbf{r}})\\backsimeq\\mathbb{R}^{D-d}\napproximating a representation of ℳℳ{\\mathcal{M}} as a graph of a function. We now present, the explicit steps of MMLS projection (see\n[37, Section 3.2] for the implementation details\nof MMLS projection): where d​(𝐫i−𝐪,H)𝑑subscript𝐫𝑖𝐪𝐻d({\\mathbf{r}}_{i}-{\\mathbf{q}},H) is the Euclidean distance between the point\n𝐫i−𝐪subscript𝐫𝑖𝐪{\\mathbf{r}}_{i}-{\\mathbf{q}} and the linear subspace H𝐻H, θ1​(t)subscript𝜃1𝑡\\theta_{1}(t) is a non-negative\nweight function (locally supported or rapidly decreasing\nas t→∞→𝑡t\\to\\infty, e.g., a Gaussian). The goal is to find a d𝑑d-dimensional linear subspace\nH​(𝐫)𝐻𝐫H({\\mathbf{r}}), and a point 𝐪​(𝐫)∈ℝd𝐪𝐫superscriptℝ𝑑{\\mathbf{q}}({\\mathbf{r}})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d}\nthat satisfies Eq. (2.3)\nunder the constraints 𝐫−𝐪​(𝐫)⟂H​(𝐫)perpendicular-to𝐫𝐪𝐫𝐻𝐫{\\mathbf{r}}-{\\mathbf{q}}({\\mathbf{r}})\\perp H({\\mathbf{r}}), 𝐪∈Bμ​(𝐫)𝐪subscript𝐵𝜇𝐫{\\mathbf{q}}\\in B_{\\mu}({\\mathbf{r}}), #​(S∩Bh​(𝐪))≠0#𝑆subscript𝐵ℎ𝐪0\\#(S\\cap B_{h}({\\mathbf{q}}))\\neq 0, where Bh​(𝐪)subscript𝐵ℎ𝐪B_{h}({\\mathbf{q}}) is an open ball of radius hℎh around q𝑞q, and hℎh is the\nfill distance, and Bμ​(𝐫)subscript𝐵𝜇𝐫B_{\\mu}({\\mathbf{r}}) from Constraint 2 is an open ball of radius μ𝜇\\mu (later\ndefined) around 𝐫𝐫{\\mathbf{r}} limiting the Region Of Interest (ROI). In practice, Constraint 2 is fulfilled heuristically (see Subsection 5.1). Constraint 3 makes sure that there are sample points in the support of θ1subscript𝜃1\\theta_{1}, thus avoiding trivial zero solution to Problem (2.3). In practice, Constraint 3 can be manually checked (see the end of Subsection 5.2.2). According to [37, Section 3.2], the cost of this step is O​(D​dm)𝑂𝐷superscript𝑑𝑚O(Dd^{m}). The radius\nμ𝜇\\mu must be limited by the manifold’s reach: The reach of a subset A𝐴A of ℝDsuperscriptℝ𝐷\\mathbb{R}^{D}, is the largest\nτ𝜏\\tau (possibly ∞\\infty) such that if 𝐱∈ℝD𝐱superscriptℝ𝐷{\\mathbf{x}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D} and the distance,\n𝐝𝐢𝐬𝐭​(A,𝐱)𝐝𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐴𝐱{\\bf dist}\\left(A,{\\mathbf{x}}\\right), from 𝐱𝐱{\\mathbf{x}} to A𝐴A is smaller than τ𝜏\\tau, then A𝐴A\ncontains a unique point, PA​(𝐱)∈Asubscript𝑃𝐴𝐱𝐴P_{A}({\\mathbf{x}})\\in A, nearest to 𝐱𝐱{\\mathbf{x}}. Then the\nreach of A𝐴A is denoted by 𝐫𝐜𝐡​(A)𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐴{\\bf rch}\\left(A\\right). The reach neighborhood\nof a manifold ℳℳ{\\mathcal{M}} is defined by We assume that ℳℳ{\\mathcal{M}} is a manifold with non-zero (positive) reach. Recall\nthat a closed manifold has a positive reach if and only if it is\ndifferentiable and locally Lipschitz [ref]34,\nwhich falls under our assumptions. Moreover, the region in H​(𝐫)𝐻𝐫H({\\mathbf{r}}) where ℳℳ{\\mathcal{M}} can be viewed as\na graph of a function from H​(𝐫)𝐻𝐫H({\\mathbf{r}}) to H⟂​(𝐫)superscript𝐻perpendicular-to𝐫H^{\\perp}({\\mathbf{r}}) depends on 𝐫𝐜𝐡​(ℳ)𝐫𝐜𝐡ℳ{\\bf rch}\\left(\\mathcal{M}\\right) (see [4, Lemma A.12]). To generalize the concept of a\nreach neighborhood for a domain where MMLS approximation is unique,\nthe following assumption is made in [37, Assumption 3.6]: It is assumed that there exists a uniqueness domain, Uuniquesubscript𝑈uniqueU_{\\mathrm{unique}}, defined by the largest ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-neighborhood\nof the manifold ℳℳ{\\mathcal{M}} (possibly ∞\\infty) such that if 𝐱∈ℝD𝐱superscriptℝ𝐷{\\mathbf{x}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D} and the distance,\n𝐝𝐢𝐬𝐭​(𝐱,ℳ)𝐝𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐱ℳ{\\bf dist}\\left({\\mathbf{x}},{\\mathcal{M}}\\right), from 𝐱𝐱{\\mathbf{x}} to ℳℳ{\\mathcal{M}} is smaller than ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon, then the minimization problem\n(2.3) has a unique local minimum 𝐪​(𝐱)∈Bμ​(𝐱)𝐪𝐱subscript𝐵𝜇𝐱{\\mathbf{q}}({\\mathbf{x}})\\in B_{\\mu}({\\mathbf{x}}),\nfor some constant μ<𝐫𝐜𝐡​(ℳ)/2𝜇𝐫𝐜𝐡ℳ2\\mu<{\\bf rch}\\left(\\mathcal{M}\\right)/2 which does not depend on 𝐱𝐱{\\mathbf{x}}. Indeed, in the limit case where h→0→ℎ0h\\to 0 it is shown in [37, Lemma 4.4]\nthat such a uniqueness domain exists for all closed manifolds, where ϵ<𝐫𝐜𝐡​(ℳ)/4italic-ϵ𝐫𝐜𝐡ℳ4\\epsilon<{\\bf rch}\\left(\\mathcal{M}\\right)/4 and μ=𝐫𝐜𝐡​(ℳ)/2𝜇𝐫𝐜𝐡ℳ2\\mu={\\bf rch}\\left(\\mathcal{M}\\right)/2. Thus, for hℎh small enough, μ𝜇\\mu can be approximately 𝐫𝐜𝐡​(ℳ)/2𝐫𝐜𝐡ℳ2{\\bf rch}\\left(\\mathcal{M}\\right)/2. Moreover,\nfor any 𝐫~∈Uunique~𝐫subscript𝑈unique\\widetilde{{\\mathbf{r}}}\\in U_{\\mathrm{unique}} that is also ‖𝐫~−𝐪​(𝐫)‖<μnorm~𝐫𝐪𝐫𝜇\\|\\widetilde{{\\mathbf{r}}}-{\\mathbf{q}}({\\mathbf{r}})\\|<\\mu\nand 𝐫~−q​(𝐫)⟂H​(𝐫)perpendicular-to~𝐫𝑞𝐫𝐻𝐫\\widetilde{{\\mathbf{r}}}-q({\\mathbf{r}})\\perp H({\\mathbf{r}}) the problem (2.3) for\n𝐫~~𝐫\\widetilde{{\\mathbf{r}}} yields the same local minimum [37, Lemma 4.7],\ni.e., 𝐪​(𝐫~)=𝐪​(𝐫)𝐪~𝐫𝐪𝐫{\\mathbf{q}}(\\widetilde{{\\mathbf{r}}})={\\mathbf{q}}({\\mathbf{r}}) and H​(𝐫~)=H​(𝐫)𝐻~𝐫𝐻𝐫H(\\widetilde{{\\mathbf{r}}})=H({\\mathbf{r}}). In addition,\n𝐪​(𝐫)𝐪𝐫{\\mathbf{q}}({\\mathbf{r}}) and H​(𝐫)𝐻𝐫H({\\mathbf{r}}) are smoothly varying functions of 𝐫𝐫{\\mathbf{r}} when θ1​(⋅)∈C∞subscript𝜃1⋅superscript𝐶\\theta_{1}(\\cdot)\\in C^{\\infty} [37, Theorem 4.12],\nmaking them a smoothly varying coordinate system. Now the manifold ℳℳ{\\mathcal{M}} is approximated using the local coordinate\nsystem in Bμ​(𝐫)subscript𝐵𝜇𝐫B_{\\mu}({\\mathbf{r}}), by approximating the function φ:H​(𝐫)→ℳ⊆ℝD:𝜑→𝐻𝐫ℳsuperscriptℝ𝐷\\varphi:H({\\mathbf{r}})\\to{\\mathcal{M}}\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^{D} (a parametrization of ℳℳ\\mathcal{M}).\nLet {𝐞k}k=1dsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝐞𝑘𝑘1𝑑\\{{\\mathbf{e}}_{k}\\}_{k=1}^{d} be an orthogonal basis of H​(𝐫)𝐻𝐫H({\\mathbf{r}}). Let\n𝐪isubscript𝐪𝑖{\\mathbf{q}}_{i} be the orthogonal projections of 𝐫i−𝐪​(𝐫)subscript𝐫𝑖𝐪𝐫{\\mathbf{r}}_{i}-{\\mathbf{q}}({\\mathbf{r}}) onto H​(𝐫)𝐻𝐫H({\\mathbf{r}}),\ni.e., 𝐪i=∑k=1d⟨𝐫i−𝐪​(𝐫),𝐞k⟩​𝐞ksubscript𝐪𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑘1𝑑subscript𝐫𝑖𝐪𝐫subscript𝐞𝑘subscript𝐞𝑘{\\mathbf{q}}_{i}=\\sum_{k=1}^{d}\\left\\langle{\\mathbf{r}}_{i}-{\\mathbf{q}}({\\mathbf{r}}),{\\mathbf{e}}_{k}\\right\\rangle{\\mathbf{e}}_{k}.\nNote that 𝐫−𝐪​(𝐫)𝐫𝐪𝐫{\\mathbf{r}}-{\\mathbf{q}}({\\mathbf{r}}) is projected to the origin of H​(𝐫)𝐻𝐫H({\\mathbf{r}}). Next, φ𝜑\\varphi\nis approximated via a polynomial g:H​(𝐫)≌ℝd→ℝD:𝑔≌𝐻𝐫superscriptℝ𝑑→superscriptℝ𝐷g:H({\\mathbf{r}})\\backsimeq\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{D} of\ntotal degree m𝑚m for 1≤k≤D1𝑘𝐷1\\leq k\\leq D (denoted by g∈Πmd𝑔superscriptsubscriptΠ𝑚𝑑g\\in\\Pi_{m}^{d}),\nusing the data points φi=φ​(𝐪i)=𝐫isubscript𝜑𝑖𝜑subscript𝐪𝑖subscript𝐫𝑖\\varphi_{i}=\\varphi({\\mathbf{q}}_{i})={\\mathbf{r}}_{i} and MLS.\nExplicitly, we have where θ2​(⋅)subscript𝜃2⋅\\theta_{2}(\\cdot) is\na fast decaying radial weight function consistent across scales, i.e., θ2​(𝐫i−𝐪​(𝐫))=θh​(‖𝐫i−𝐪​(𝐫)‖)subscript𝜃2subscript𝐫𝑖𝐪𝐫subscript𝜃ℎnormsubscript𝐫𝑖𝐪𝐫\\theta_{2}({\\mathbf{r}}_{i}-{\\mathbf{q}}({\\mathbf{r}}))=\\theta_{h}(\\|{\\mathbf{r}}_{i}-{\\mathbf{q}}({\\mathbf{r}})\\|) and θh​(t​h)=Φ​(t)subscript𝜃ℎ𝑡ℎΦ𝑡\\theta_{h}(th)=\\Phi(t). The projection 𝒫mh​(𝐫)superscriptsubscript𝒫𝑚ℎ𝐫{\\mathcal{P}}_{m}^{h}({\\mathbf{r}}) is then defined as: According to [37, Section 3.2], the cost of this step is O​(D​dm+d3​m)𝑂𝐷superscript𝑑𝑚superscript𝑑3𝑚O(Dd^{m}+d^{3m}). Thus, the total cost of performing MMLS projection on a given point 𝐫𝐫{\\mathbf{r}} is O​(D​dm+d3​m)𝑂𝐷superscript𝑑𝑚superscript𝑑3𝑚O(Dd^{m}+d^{3m}) [37, Corollary 3.11]. For convenience we denote it by TMMLS≔O​(D​dm+d3​m)≔subscript𝑇MMLS𝑂𝐷superscript𝑑𝑚superscript𝑑3𝑚T_{\\text{MMLS}}\\coloneqq O(Dd^{m}+d^{3m}). Using MMLS, the approximating manifold of ℳℳ{\\mathcal{M}} denoted by ℳ~~ℳ\\widetilde{{\\mathcal{M}}}\nis then defined by In [37, theorems 4.21 and 4.22], it is shown that if θ1subscript𝜃1\\theta_{1} and θ2subscript𝜃2\\theta_{2} are monotonically decaying and compactly supported, for 𝐫∈Uunique𝐫subscript𝑈unique{\\mathbf{r}}\\in U_{\\mathrm{unique}}, and small enough hℎh,\nwe have that 𝒫mh​(𝐫)∈ℳ~superscriptsubscript𝒫𝑚ℎ𝐫~ℳ{\\mathcal{P}}_{m}^{h}({\\mathbf{r}})\\in\\widetilde{{\\mathcal{M}}} and ℳ~~ℳ\\widetilde{{\\mathcal{M}}}\nis almost everywhere a C∞superscript𝐶C^{\\infty} d𝑑d-dimensional manifold that approximates ℳℳ{\\mathcal{M}}\nwith the approximation order O​(hm+1)𝑂superscriptℎ𝑚1O(h^{m+1}) in Hausdorff norm, i.e. for some constant M>0𝑀0M>0 independent of hℎh. Together with [38, Eq. (24)], we have that given 𝐩∈ℳ𝐩ℳ{\\mathbf{p}}\\in\\mathcal{M} such that 𝒫mh​(𝐩)=𝐫superscriptsubscript𝒫𝑚ℎ𝐩𝐫{\\mathcal{P}}_{m}^{h}({\\mathbf{p}})={\\mathbf{r}}, then 𝐫∈ℳ~𝐫~ℳ{\\mathbf{r}}\\in\\widetilde{\\mathcal{M}} and for some constant cMMLS>0subscript𝑐MMLS0c_{\\text{MMLS}}>0 independent of 𝐩𝐩{\\mathbf{p}} and 𝐫𝐫{\\mathbf{r}}. In addition, in [37, Theorem 4.21] it is shown that MMLS projection from ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} to ℳ~~ℳ\\widetilde{\\mathcal{M}} is smooth, thus ℳ~~ℳ\\widetilde{\\mathcal{M}} is a compact set as the image of the compact manifold ℳℳ\\mathcal{M}. Furthermore, [37, Theorem 4.19] states that the aforementioned projection is an injective mapping. Thus, together with the definition of ℳ~~ℳ\\widetilde{\\mathcal{M}} from Eq. (2.5), we have that MMLS projection from ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} to ℳ~~ℳ\\widetilde{\\mathcal{M}} is bijective. Moreover, under the\nsame conditions, in [38, Lemma 3] (see Lemma 32 in Appendix B.1), it is shown that\na parametrization φ:H​(𝐩)→ℳ⊆ℝD:𝜑→𝐻𝐩ℳsuperscriptℝ𝐷\\varphi:H({\\mathbf{p}})\\to{\\mathcal{M}}\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^{D} of ℳℳ{\\mathcal{M}}\nexists such that 𝐩∈ℳ𝐩ℳ{\\mathbf{p}}\\in{\\mathcal{M}}, φ​(𝟎)=𝐩𝜑0𝐩\\varphi({\\mathbf{0}})={\\mathbf{p}}, and 𝒫mh​(𝐩)∈ℳ~superscriptsubscript𝒫𝑚ℎ𝐩~ℳ{\\mathcal{P}}_{m}^{h}({\\mathbf{p}})\\in\\widetilde{{\\mathcal{M}}}, and also a parametrization φ~:H​(𝐩)→ℳ~⊆ℝD:~𝜑→𝐻𝐩~ℳsuperscriptℝ𝐷\\widetilde{\\varphi}:H({\\mathbf{p}})\\to\\widetilde{{\\mathcal{M}}}\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^{D} of ℳ~~ℳ\\widetilde{{\\mathcal{M}}}\nexists such that φ~​(𝟎)=𝒫mh​(𝐩)~𝜑0superscriptsubscript𝒫𝑚ℎ𝐩\\widetilde{\\varphi}({\\mathbf{0}})={\\mathcal{P}}_{m}^{h}({\\mathbf{p}}). It is further shown in [38, Lemma 4] (see Lemma 33 in Appendix B.1),\nthat if in addition limt→0θh​(t)=∞subscript→𝑡0subscript𝜃ℎ𝑡\\lim_{t\\to 0}\\theta_{h}(t)=\\infty, i.e., ℳ~~ℳ\\widetilde{{\\mathcal{M}}} interpolates ℳℳ{\\mathcal{M}} at\n𝐫isubscript𝐫𝑖{\\mathbf{r}}_{i}, then in a small vicinity of 𝟎∈H​(𝐩)0𝐻𝐩{\\mathbf{0}}\\in H({\\mathbf{p}})\nin H​(𝐩)𝐻𝐩H({\\mathbf{p}}) the directional derivatives of φ​(𝐱)𝜑𝐱\\varphi({\\mathbf{x}})\nand g⋆​(𝐱|𝐩)superscript𝑔⋆conditional𝐱𝐩g^{\\star}({\\mathbf{x}}\\ |\\ {\\mathbf{p}}) (with respect to the first input) at any direction 𝐯∈ℝd𝐯superscriptℝ𝑑{\\mathbf{v}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d} satisfy for some constant cℳ>0subscript𝑐ℳ0c_{\\mathcal{M}}>0 independent of 𝐯𝐯{\\mathbf{v}} or 𝐩𝐩{\\mathbf{p}} (see Appendix B.1). Note that Eq. (2.8) is also true for the directional derivatives of g⋆superscript𝑔⋆g^{\\star} (with respect to the first input) and of φ~​(⋅)~𝜑⋅\\widetilde{\\varphi}(\\cdot), with another constant cℳ~>0subscript𝑐~ℳ0c_{\\widetilde{\\mathcal{M}}}>0, and also for the directional derivatives of φ𝜑\\varphi and φ~~𝜑\\widetilde{\\varphi} with cℳ,ℳ~>0subscript𝑐ℳ~ℳ0c_{\\mathcal{M},\\widetilde{\\mathcal{M}}}>0, both constants are independent of 𝐯𝐯{\\mathbf{v}} or 𝐩𝐩{\\mathbf{p}}, i.e., and Note that [38, Lemma 3] and [38, Lemma 4] can be extended in the following way. Given 𝐫∈ℳ~𝐫~ℳ{\\mathbf{r}}\\in\\widetilde{\\mathcal{M}}, there exists a 𝐩∈ℳ𝐩ℳ{\\mathbf{p}}\\in\\mathcal{M} such that 𝒫mh​(𝐩)=𝐫superscriptsubscript𝒫𝑚ℎ𝐩𝐫{\\mathcal{P}}_{m}^{h}({\\mathbf{p}})={\\mathbf{r}} since MMLS projection from ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} to ℳ~~ℳ\\widetilde{\\mathcal{M}} is bijective. Thus, from the uniqueness property [37, Lemma 4.7], we have that 𝐪​(𝐫)=𝐪​(𝐩)𝐪𝐫𝐪𝐩{\\mathbf{q}}({\\mathbf{r}})={\\mathbf{q}}({\\mathbf{p}}), H​(𝐫)=H​(𝐩)𝐻𝐫𝐻𝐩H({\\mathbf{r}})=H({\\mathbf{p}}), and 𝒫mh​(𝐩)=𝒫mh​(𝐫)=𝐫superscriptsubscript𝒫𝑚ℎ𝐩superscriptsubscript𝒫𝑚ℎ𝐫𝐫{\\mathcal{P}}_{m}^{h}({\\mathbf{p}})={\\mathcal{P}}_{m}^{h}({\\mathbf{r}})={\\mathbf{r}}. Thus, for such 𝐫∈ℳ~𝐫~ℳ{\\mathbf{r}}\\in\\widetilde{\\mathcal{M}} the same parametrizations of ℳ~~ℳ\\widetilde{\\mathcal{M}} and ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} from H​(𝐩)𝐻𝐩H({\\mathbf{p}}) which are guaranteed by [38, Lemma 3], i.e., φ:H​(𝐩)→ℳ:𝜑→𝐻𝐩ℳ\\varphi:H({\\mathbf{p}})\\to{\\mathcal{M}} and φ~:H​(𝐩)→ℳ~:~𝜑→𝐻𝐩~ℳ\\widetilde{\\varphi}:H({\\mathbf{p}})\\to\\widetilde{{\\mathcal{M}}} correspondingly, are also parametrizations from H​(𝐫)𝐻𝐫H({\\mathbf{r}}). Moreover, Eq. (2.8), Eq. (2.9), and Eq. (2.10), which hold due to [38, Lemma 4], hold also for such 𝐫∈ℳ~𝐫~ℳ{\\mathbf{r}}\\in\\widetilde{\\mathcal{M}} and its corresponding MMLS polynomial g⋆​(𝐱|𝐫)superscript𝑔⋆conditional𝐱𝐫g^{\\star}({\\mathbf{x}}\\ |\\ {\\mathbf{r}}) (since g⋆​(𝐱|𝐫)=g⋆​(𝐱|𝐩)superscript𝑔⋆conditional𝐱𝐫superscript𝑔⋆conditional𝐱𝐩g^{\\star}({\\mathbf{x}}\\ |\\ {\\mathbf{r}})=g^{\\star}({\\mathbf{x}}\\ |\\ {\\mathbf{p}})). Finally, it can be shown from Eq. (2.8), Eq. (2.9), and Eq. (2.10), and the structure of MMLS projection that the orthogonal projections operators on the ranges of D​g⋆​(𝐱|𝐩)Dsuperscript𝑔⋆conditional𝐱𝐩\\text{D}g^{\\star}({\\mathbf{x}}\\ |\\ {\\mathbf{p}}), D​φ​(𝐱)D𝜑𝐱\\text{D}\\varphi({\\mathbf{x}}), and D​φ~​(𝐱)D~𝜑𝐱\\text{D}\\widetilde{\\varphi}({\\mathbf{x}}), differ in O​(D​hm)𝑂𝐷superscriptℎ𝑚O(\\sqrt{D}h^{m}) from each other in L2subscript𝐿2L_{2} norm (see Lemma 35 in Appendix B.1). MMLS projection is presented here using\nthe standard inner product in ℝDsuperscriptℝ𝐷\\mathbb{R}^{D}, but it is possible to generalize\nthis procedure for any other inner product of the form (𝐮,𝐯)𝐌=𝐮T​𝐌​𝐯subscript𝐮𝐯𝐌superscript𝐮T𝐌𝐯({\\mathbf{u}},{\\mathbf{v}})_{{\\bm{\\mathrm{M}}}}=\\sqrt{{\\mathbf{u}}^{\\textsc{T}}{\\bm{\\mathrm{M}}}{\\mathbf{v}}}\nfor 𝐌𝐌{\\bm{\\mathrm{M}}} symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrix [37, Remark 4.23].\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: is a quasi-unifom\nsample set with respect to the domain ℳℳ{\\mathcal{M}}, with fill distance\nhℎh.
