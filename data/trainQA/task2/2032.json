      "content": "Paper Title: DRL: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Intelligent Robot Control– Concept, Literature, and Future\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe introduction of OpenAI as well as its foundation and all that along\nWith the fast pace of DL approaches and by introduction of DRL approaches for AGI https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence,\nSome of the wealthy independent thinkers such as Ellen Musk https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk started procrastinating the actual future applications of AGI\nand started somehow worrying it. This gave birth to a foundation with the aim of open-sourcing the AI technology and\nget people involved in the actual development, gathering all the important minds in the field and conducting open-source research.\nOpenAI www.openai.com was born, mainly focusing on RL and DL approaches. This This work [ref]36 proposing DRL as self playing approach in non-perfect environment in terms of the provided information, specifically in games as the environment and for agents.\nAgain DRl as self-playing, self-learning and self exploring approach experimented in games as the most primitive simulated environment and agents. In terms of DRL, this work  is demonstrating \"Case Study with Standard RL Testing Domains\" which provides a great depth and intuition about\nDRL as a general-purpose framework. This work  explains more about how DRL is exploring different models (internal model) and somehow trying to understand the power behind this approach by analyzing it more\nin different parts and how it comes up with new model. This work [ref]39 is a good example of applying DRL for multi-robot communication. Centralized learning and decentralized execution of commands on each agent platform.\nThis shows the potential of DRL to be applied to a team of robot and learning how to communicate and share the information for better decision making. This work is another work with Prof. Abbeel participation:\nAnother work for continuous control outputs and decision making is . It shows DRL framework for generating continuous control command or action as a regression method\nfor function fitting (classification used for function approximation with discreet output action). This work  shows the application of DRL on terrain traversability based on kinematics of the agent for locomotion.\nThis is very well related to my previous work [ref]42 trying to solve the traversability problem using a hand-engineered features such as surface and points normals. This work  is an application of DRL as an end-to-end framework for NLP (Natural Language Processing) and also understanding along with speech recognition.\nThe DRQN is proposed as the DRL framework specifics which is the combination of DRNN (Deep RNN) and Q-network. This work  proposed DRL as a powerful framework for learning policies to map BIG sensor input data to the output actions in different domains such as Atari games.\nThis work is concentrating on macro-actions as the output controlling commands in 2600 different Atari games.\nThey mainly try to address the shortcomings of DQN  and reason about the problem of sparse rewarding signals. This work  is a great example of policy learning so-called P-learning in the paper in DRL framework.\nThis is simply explaining how a DL approach can be inside RL setting using negative examples. In terms of transfer learning, this work  claim the first successful experimentation continual learning.\nThis work in terms of transfer learning or continual learning is very important.\nBriefly speaking, they claim the addition of memory to the DRL framework successfully. This work  is applying DRL framework to simulation framework of the environment and the agent based on a 3D game called Doom and reporting its results.\nThis simulation framework is based one-person view which makes much more realistic than Atari games.\nIt also shows the architecture of the CNN used for DL along with Q-learning as RL approach in this aspect.\nThis work  is proposing a lifelong DRL framework including transfer learning as well for reusing the learned skill for the next task.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: in the actual development, gathering all the important minds in the field and conducting open-source research.\nOpenAI www.openai.com was born, mainly focusing on RL and DL approaches.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
