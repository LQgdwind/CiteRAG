      "content": "Paper Title: R2L: Distilling Neural Radiance Field to Neural Light Field for Efficient Novel View Synthesis\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInferring the representation of a 3D scene from 2D observations is a fundamental problem in computer graphics and computer vision. Recent research innovations in implicit neural representations     and differential neural renders [ref]34 have remarkably advanced the solutions to this problem. Neural radiance field (NeRF) learned by a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network shows a great potential to store a complex scene into a compact neural network [ref]34, thus has inspired plenty of follow-up works [ref]6   . Despite the success of NeRF and its extensions, the drawback is still apparent. The rendering time even for a single pixel is prolonged since the NeRF framework needs to aggregate the radiance of hundreds of sampled points via alpha-composition. It requires hundreds of network forwards, thus is prohibitively slow, especially on resource-constrained devices. One intuitive solution to the problem is to reduce the model size of NeRF MLP. However, apparent quality degradation of rendered images can be observed (e.g., reducing the network width by only half causes around 0.01 SSIM  drop in ) while the reduction of inference time is only limited.\nOther research efforts focus on decreasing the number of sampled points  [ref]35. However, this does not fundamentally resolve the sampling issue. Some work [ref]35 demands extra depth information for training, which is usually unavailable in most practical cases.\nThus, a method that only requires 2D images as input, represents the scene compactly, and enjoys a fast rendering speed with high image quality is highly desired. This paper aims to present such a method that can achieve all the four goals simultaneously by representing the scene as Neural Light Field (NeLF) instead of neural radiance field. In the neural light field, ray origin and direction are directly mapped into its associated RGB values, avoiding the need of sampling multiple points along the camera ray. Therefore, rendering a pixel requires only one single query, making it much faster than the radiance scene representation. The idea of NeLF is attractive; however, realizing it for representing complex real-world scenes with better quality than NeRF is still challenging.\nOur first key technical innovation enabling this is a novel network architecture design for the neural light field network. Specially, we propose a deep (88 layers) residual MLP network with extensive residual MLP blocks. The deep network has much greater expressivity than the shallow\ncounterparts, thus can represent the light field faithfully. Notably, since the debut of NeRF [ref]34, its MLP-based network architecture is inherited with few substantial changes [ref]6 [ref]35  . To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt to address the NeRF rendering efficiency issue from the network design perspective. Although our network contains more parameters than the original NeRF, we only need one single network forward to render the color of a pixel, leading to much faster inference speed than NeRF. The major technical problem is how to train the proposed deep residual MLP network. It is well-known that large networks hunger for large sample sizes to curb overfitting  . We can barely train such a large network using only the original 2D images (which are typically less than 100100100 in real-world applications). To tackle this problem, as the second key technical innovation of this paper, we propose to distill the knowledge   from a pretrained NeRF model to our network, by rendering pseudo data from random views using the pre-trained NeRF model. We name our method as R2L since we show distilling neural Radiance filed to neural Light filed is an effective way to obtain a powerful NeLF network for efficient novel view synthesis. Empirically, we evaluate our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets. On the synthetic scenes, we achieve 26∼35×26\\sim 35\\times FLOPs reduction (28∼31×28\\sim 31\\times wall-time speedup) over the original NeRF with\nsignificantly higher rendering quality. Comparison between ours and other efficient novel view synthesis approaches is summarized in Tab. 1.\nOverall, our contributions can be summarized into the following aspects: Methodologically, we present a brand-new deep residual MLP network aiming for compact neural representation, fast rendering,\nwithout extra demand besides\n2D images, for efficient novel view synthesis. This is the first attempt to improve the rendering efficiency via network architecture optimization. Our network represents complex real-world scenes as neural light fields.\nTo resolve the data shortage problem when training the proposed deep MLP network, we propose an effective training strategy by distilling knowledge from a pre-trained NeRF model, which is the key to enabling our method. Practically, our approach achieves 26∼35×26\\sim 35\\times FLOPs reduction (28∼31×28\\sim 31\\times wall-time speedup) over the original NeRF with even better visual quality, which also performs favorably against existing counterpart approaches.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: a 3D scene from 2D observations is a fundamental problem in computer graphics and computer vision.
