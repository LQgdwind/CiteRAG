Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

Dataset. The test dataset consists of 10, 000 images randomly selected from the ImageNet validation set , and almost all can be correctly classified by the model exploited in this paper. All these images are resized to 299√ó299√ó32992993299\\times 299\\times 3 beforehand. Models. In the experiment, 14 models are selected for testing, including four normally trained models and ten defense models. Four normally trained models, i.e., Inception-v3 (Inc-v3) , Inception-v4 (Inc-v4) , Inception-Resnet-v2 (IncRes-v2)  and Resnet-v2-152 (Res-152) . Ten defense models three adversarially trained models, i.e., Inc-v3ens3, Inc-v3ens4, and IncRes-v2ens ); top-3 defense models in NIPS 2017 competition, i.e., high-level representation guided denoiser (HGD rank-1) , random resizing and padding (R&P rank-2)  and the rank-3 submission (NIPS-r3111https://github.com/anlthms/nips-2017/tree/master/mmd); four recently proposed defense methods, i.e., purifying perturbations via image compression model (Comdefend) , randomized smoothing (RS) , feature distillation (FD1) , and feature denoising (FD2) . Baselines. Four gradient-based adversarial attacks (i.e., FGSM , I-FGSM , MI-FGSM , and NI-FGSM [ref]23) are selected as the baselines to compare with our proposed PC-based attacks, including PC-FGSM, PC-I-FGSM, PC-MI-FGSM, and PC-NI-FGSM. In addition, three data augmentation methods (i.e., DIM , TIM [ref]13, and SIM [ref]23) are integrated into NI-FGSM [ref]23 and our proposed PC-NI-FGSM for comparison. NI-FGSM integrated with the three augmentation methods are named DI-NI-FGSM, TI-DI-NI-FGSM, and SI-TI-DI-NI-FGSM, and PC-NI-FGSM integrated with the three data augmentation methods are termed PC-DI-NI-FGSM, PC-DI-NI-FGSM, and PC-SI-TI-DI-NI-FGSM, respectively.
