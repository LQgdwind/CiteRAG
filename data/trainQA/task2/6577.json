      "content": "Paper Title: Diffusion Policies for Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Offline Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn dynamic programming-based offline RL methods, the state-action value function is approximated using the offline RL dataset that comprises samples collected by the behavior policy. As the learned policy diverges more from the behavior policy, Q-function estimates tend to exhibit overestimation in regions where uncertainty is high [ref]14. One way to mitigate this challenge is employing a policy constraint method that works well in off-policy RL. A straightforward approach would be to impose a constraint on the statistical distance between the learned policy and the behavior policy in the policy optimization objective [ref]8 or the reward function . However, both methods require the computation of the behavior policy through behavior cloning and enforce a constraint on the learned policy. Nair et al.  alleviated the need for computing the behavior policy by approximating the policy objective using an advantage-weighted maximum likelihood. They derived the closed-form solution of the constrained actor objective using Lagrangian and learned a Q-function to approximate the advantage values of the samples from the dataset. Still, this method is prone to distribution shift as the policy can query the out-of-distribution (OOD) actions during training. Recent work addressed this distribution shift by avoiding OOD actions in the Q-function estimation using an expected loss instead of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss . As an alternative, in Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) [ref]18, the Q-function is approximated using a minimax objective where overestimated action values are minimized, and actions from the dataset are maximized. However, conservative estimation of the value function is prone to over-fitting when data is scarce [ref]8. Importance Sampling-based offline RL methods attempt to approximate the learned policy or expected return via off-policy RL techniques. Resorting to previous work on off-policy RL seems intuitive, as replay buffers of both algorithms consist of samples from policy distributions that are different from the policy being learned. However, the off-policy RL problem formulation fundamentally differs from the offline RL setting. Off-policy RL allows environment interaction in the training loop, whereas offline RL learns from a static replay buffer constructed before training. The accuracy of the importance sampling estimator depends on the proximity of the learned policy to the policy used for data collection, the dimensionality of the state-action space, and the horizon of the task. Hence, these algorithms have limited applicability to real tasks and impose constraints on our objective of obtaining the best policy supported by the data. Prior work on importance sampling-based offline RL addresses the bias-variance trade-off. The marginal importance ratio  can be used via dynamic programming to reduce bias. Doubly robust estimator  uses recursive regression-based value evaluation to reduce variance. However, these methods are still prone to distribution shifts, as they exploit out-of-distribution regions in the policy improvement step. Hence, this work uses an auxiliary state reconstruction signal in the policy improvement step that encourages learning more generalizable state features. Model-based offline RL methods focus on deriving the environment model by estimating the transition function, unlike model-free methods. Although, theoretically, their advantage over model-free methods has not been proven [ref]8, they offer sample efficiency and quick adaptation. In the model-based offline RL setting, the model cannot correct out-of-distribution states in addition to the out-of-distribution actions. To avoid out-of-distribution states and actions, a scaled uncertainty function penalizes the reward function over state action pairs . However, estimating an uncertainty function that accurately quantifies uncertainty regions over the state action space is a challenging open problem [ref]8. Conservative Model-Based-RL , on the other hand, follows a similar approach used in CQL [ref]18 and regularizes the Q-function estimation objective by penalizing overestimated Q-values of state action tuples sampled from the model distribution. Most model-based RL algorithms are myopic and fail to make accurate predictions in tasks where the dimensions of the state action space are high [ref]8. Recent works have viewed the problem through the lens of sequence modeling and used high-capacity transformers  . However, these architectures are computationally intensive to train as they need careful tuning of hyperparameters. More importantly, the requirement of extensive hyperparameter tuning is a significant limitation for offline RL. Despite that, current algorithms restrict the set of hyperparameters to be tuned by assuming a limited number of online interactions is allowed . Hence, validation and hyperparameter optimization in offline RL is still an open area of research.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: samples collected by the behavior policy.
