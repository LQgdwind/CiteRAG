Not all readability criteria come naturally in the form of differentiable functions.\nWe cannot compute the gradient of or apply SGD on non-differentiable functions.\nIn cases that the original objective is continuous but not everywhere differentiable e.g., a ‚Äôhinge‚Äô function f(x)=max(0,x), we can compute the subgradient and update the objective based on the subgradient.\nHence, as long as the function is continuously defined on a connected component in the domain, we can apply the subgradient descent algorithm. When a function is not defined in a connected domain, we can introduce surrogate loss functions to ‚Äòconnect the pieces‚Äô.\nFor example, when optimizing neighborhood preservation we maximize the Jaccard similarity between graph neighbors and nearest neighbors in graph layout.\nHowever, Jaccard similarity is only defined between two binary vectors.\nTo solve this problem we extend Jaccard similarity to all real vectors by its Lov√°sz extension¬†[ref]8 and apply that to optimize neighborhood preservation.\nAn essential part of gradient descent based algorithms is to compute the gradient/subgradient of the objective function.\nIn practice, it is not necessary to write down the gradient analytically as it can be computed automatically via (reverse-mode) automatic differentiation¬†.\nDeep learning packages such as Tensorflow¬† and PyTorch¬† apply automatic differentiation to compute the gradient of complicated functions. Most of the objective functions that we consider here are not convex and do not have unique global minimizers.\nTherefore, even though SGD is known to converge (to at least a local optimum) in relatively relaxed settings¬† [ref]5, few optimization objectives are guaranteed to find the global optimum.\nIn particular, unlike methods such as stress majorization¬†, most of our optimization objectives are not guaranteed to converge to the global optimum.\nMeanwhile, most of the objective functions for which SGD works well in practice (e.g., in deep learning) are neither convex nor have unique global minimizers¬†.\nWith this in mind, we follow the common practice of applying an annealing process, if necessary, to ensure convergence (to a possibly local minimum).\n When optimizing multiple criteria simultaneously, we combine them via a weighted sum.\nHowever, choosing a proper weight for each criterion can be tricky.\nConsider, for example, maximizing crossing angles and minimizing stress simultaneously with a fixed pair of weights.\nAt the very early stage, the initial drawing may have many crossings and stress minimization often removes most of the early crossings.\nAs a result, maximizing crossing angles in the early stage can be harmful as it moves nodes in directions that contradict those that come from stress minimization.\nTherefore, a well-tailored weight scheduling is needed for a successful outcome.\nContinuing with the same example, a better outcome can be achieved by first optimizing stress until it converges, and later adding weights for the crossing angle maximization.\nTo explore different ways of scheduling, we provide an interface that allows manual tuning of the weights.\n\nWe consider weight schedules for different criteria sets in Section¬†5.2.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: neighbors in graph layout.\nHowever, Jaccard similarity is only defined between two binary vectors.\nTo solve this problem we extend Jaccard similarity to all real vectors by its Lov√°sz extension¬†[ref]8 and apply that to optimize neighborhood preservation.\nAn essential part of gradient descent based algorithms is to compute the gradient/subgradient of the objective function.\nIn practice, it\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
