      "content": "Paper Title: Enhanced Isotropy Maximization Loss: Seamless and High-Performance Out-of-Distribution Detection Simply Replacing the SoftMax Loss\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe consider an input 𝒙𝒙\\bm{x} applied to a neural network that performs a parametrized transformation 𝒇𝜽​(𝒙)subscript𝒇𝜽𝒙\\bm{f}_{\\bm{\\theta}}(\\bm{x}). We also consider 𝒑ϕjsuperscriptsubscript𝒑bold-italic-ϕ𝑗\\bm{p}_{\\bm{\\phi}}^{j} to be the learnable prototype associated with class j𝑗j. Additionally, let the expression ∥𝒇𝜽​(𝒙)−𝒑ϕj∥delimited-∥∥subscript𝒇𝜽𝒙superscriptsubscript𝒑bold-italic-ϕ𝑗\\lVert\\bm{f}_{\\bm{\\theta}}(\\bm{x})\\!-\\!\\bm{p}_{\\bm{\\phi}}^{j}\\rVert represent the nonsquared Euclidean distance between 𝒇𝜽​(𝒙)subscript𝒇𝜽𝒙\\bm{f}_{\\bm{\\theta}}(\\bm{x}) and 𝒑ϕjsuperscriptsubscript𝒑bold-italic-ϕ𝑗\\bm{p}_{\\bm{\\phi}}^{j}. Finally, we consider 𝒑ϕksuperscriptsubscript𝒑bold-italic-ϕ𝑘\\bm{p}_{\\bm{\\phi}}^{k} as the learnable prototype associated with the correct class for the input 𝒙𝒙\\bm{x}. Thus, we write the IsoMax loss [ref]3 using the equation below: Besides preserving classification accuracy compared with SoftMax loss- and IsoMax loss-trained networks, IsoMax+ loss-trained models show higher OOD detection performance. Results are shown as means and standard deviations of five different iterations (see Table III). SoftMaxESES{}_{\\text{ES}} means training using SoftMax loss and performing OOD detection using the entropic score (ES). IsoMaxESES{}_{\\text{ES}} means training using IsoMax loss and performing OOD detection using the entropic score (ES). IsoMax+MDSMDS{}_{\\text{MDS}} means training using IsoMax+ loss and performing OOD detection using minimum distance score (MDS). Results are shown as the mean and standard deviation of five iterations. The best results are shown in bold. See Table II. In the above equation, Essubscript𝐸𝑠E_{s} represents the entropic scale. From Equation (1), we observe that the distances from IsoMax loss are given by the expression 𝒟=∥𝒇𝜽​(𝒙)−𝒑ϕj∥𝒟delimited-∥∥subscript𝒇𝜽𝒙superscriptsubscript𝒑bold-italic-ϕ𝑗\\mathcal{D}\\!=\\!\\lVert\\bm{f}_{\\bm{\\theta}}(\\bm{x})\\!-\\!\\bm{p}_{\\bm{\\phi}}^{j}\\rVert. During inference, probabilities calculated based on these distances are used to produce the negative entropy, which serves as a score to perform OOD detection. However, because the features 𝒇𝜽​(𝒙)subscript𝒇𝜽𝒙\\bm{f}_{\\bm{\\theta}}(\\bm{x}) are not normalized, examples with low norms are unjustifiably favored to be considered OOD examples because they tend to produce high entropy. Additionally, because the weights 𝒑ϕjsuperscriptsubscript𝒑bold-italic-ϕ𝑗\\bm{p}_{\\bm{\\phi}}^{j} are not normalized, examples from classes that present prototypes with low norms are unjustifiably favored to be considered OOD examples for the same reason. Thus, we propose replacing 𝒇𝜽​(𝒙)subscript𝒇𝜽𝒙\\bm{f}_{\\bm{\\theta}}(\\bm{x}) with its normalized version given by 𝒇𝜽​(𝒙)^=𝒇𝜽​(𝒙)/∥𝒇𝜽​(𝒙)∥^subscript𝒇𝜽𝒙subscript𝒇𝜽𝒙delimited-∥∥subscript𝒇𝜽𝒙\\widehat{\\bm{f}_{\\bm{\\theta}}(\\bm{x})}\\!=\\!\\bm{f}_{\\bm{\\theta}}(\\bm{x})/\\lVert\\bm{f}_{\\bm{\\theta}}(\\bm{x})\\rVert. Additionally, we propose replacing 𝒑ϕjsuperscriptsubscript𝒑bold-italic-ϕ𝑗\\bm{p}_{\\bm{\\phi}}^{j} with its normalized version given by 𝒑ϕj^=𝒑ϕj/∥𝒑ϕj∥^superscriptsubscript𝒑bold-italic-ϕ𝑗superscriptsubscript𝒑bold-italic-ϕ𝑗delimited-∥∥superscriptsubscript𝒑bold-italic-ϕ𝑗\\widehat{\\bm{p}_{\\bm{\\phi}}^{j}}\\!=\\!\\bm{p}_{\\bm{\\phi}}^{j}/\\lVert\\bm{p}_{\\bm{\\phi}}^{j}\\rVert. The expression ∥𝒗∥delimited-∥∥𝒗\\lVert\\bm{v}\\rVert represents the 2-norm of a given vector 𝒗𝒗\\bm{v}. However, while the distances in the original IsoMax loss may vary from zero to infinity, the distance between two normalized vectors is always equal to or lower than two. To avoid this unjustifiable and unreasonable restriction, we introduce the distance scale dssubscript𝑑𝑠d_{s}, which is a scalar learnable parameter. Naturally, we require the distance scale to always be positive by taking its absolute value |ds|subscript𝑑𝑠\\lvert d_{s}\\rvert. Feature normalization makes the solution isometric regardless of the norm of the features produced by the examples. The distance scale is class independent because it is a single scalar value learnable during training. The weight normalization and the class independence of the distance scale make the solution isometric regarding all classes. The final distance is isometric because it produces an isometric treatment of all features, prototypes, and classes.\nTherefore, we can write the isometric distances used by the IsoMax+ loss as 𝒟ℐ=|ds|​∥𝒇𝜽​(𝒙)^−𝒑ϕj^∥subscript𝒟ℐsubscript𝑑𝑠delimited-∥∥^subscript𝒇𝜽𝒙^superscriptsubscript𝒑bold-italic-ϕ𝑗\\mathcal{D_{I}}=\\lvert d_{s}\\rvert\\>\\lVert\\widehat{\\bm{f}_{\\bm{\\theta}}(\\bm{x})}\\!-\\!\\widehat{\\bm{p}_{\\bm{\\phi}}^{j}}\\rVert.\nReturning to Equation (1), we can finally write the expression for the IsoMax+ loss as follows (see Algorithm 1): Applying the entropy maximization trick (i.e., the removal of the entropic scale Essubscript𝐸𝑠E_{s} for inference) [ref]3, we can write the expression for the IsoMax+ loss probabilities used during inference for performing OOD detection when using the maximum probability score or the entropic score [ref]3: ODIN and Mahalanobis were applied to models trained using SoftMax loss. These approaches compute at least four times slower and less power efficient inferences [ref]3 because they use input preprocessing. Their hyperparameters were validated using adversarial examples. Additionally, Mahalanobis requires feature extraction for training ad-hoc models to perform OOD detection. Finally, feature ensemble was also used. IsoMax+MDSMDS{}_{\\text{MDS}} (ours) means training using IsoMax+ loss and performing OOD detection using minimum distance score (MDS). No hyperparameter tuning is required when using IsoMax+ loss for training and the MDS for OOD detection. The IsoMax+ loss OOD detection performance shown in this table may be increased further without relying on input preprocessing or hyperparameter tuning by replacing the minimum distance score with the Mahalanobis [ref]5 or the energy score . Results are the mean and standard deviation of five runs. The best results are shown in bold. SoftMaxESOEsubscriptsuperscriptabsentOEES{}^{\\text{OE}}_{\\text{ES}} means training using SoftMax loss enhanced during training using outlier exposure [ref]7, which requires the collection of outlier data, and performing OOD detection using the entropic score. We used the same outlier data used in [ref]7. We collected the same amount of outlier data as the number of training examples present in the training set used to train SoftMaxOEOE{}^{\\text{OE}}. Despite being possible , the IsoMax loss and IsoMax+ loss were not enhanced by outlier exposure to keep the solution seamless. IsoMaxESES{}_{\\text{ES}} means training using IsoMax loss and performing OOD detection using the entropic score. IsoMax+MDSMDS{}_{\\text{MDS}} (ours) means training using IsoMax+ loss and performing OOD detection using minimum distance score (MDS). The values of the performance metrics TNR@TPR95 and AUROC were averaged over all out-of-distribution (SVHN, TinyImageNet, and LSUN). Results are shown as the mean and standard deviation of five iterations. The best results are shown in bold. IsoMaxESES{}_{\\text{ES}} means training using IsoMax loss and performing OOD detection using the entropic score (ES). IsoMaxMDSMDS{}_{\\text{MDS}} means training using IsoMax loss and performing OOD detection using the minimum distance score (MDS). IsoMax+ESES{}_{\\text{ES}} means training using IsoMax+ loss and performing OOD detection using entropic score (ES). IsoMax+MDSMDS{}_{\\text{MDS}} (ours) means training using IsoMax+ loss and performing OOD detection using minimum distance score (MDS). The values of the performance metrics TNR@TPR95 and AUROC were averaged over all out-of-distribution (SVHN, TinyImageNet, and LSUN). Results are shown as the mean and standard deviation of five iterations. The best results are shown in bold. See Fig. 1. Different from IsoMax loss, where the prototypes are initialized to a zero vector, we initialized all prototypes using a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This approach is necessary because we normalize the prototypes when using IsoMax+ loss. The distance scale is initialized to one, and we added no hyperparameters to the solution.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Finally, we consider 𝒑ϕksuperscriptsubscript𝒑bold-italic-ϕ𝑘\\bm{p}_{\\bm{\\phi}}^{k} as the learnable prototype associated with the correct class for the input 𝒙𝒙\\bm{x}.
