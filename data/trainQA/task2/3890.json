      "content": "Paper Title: Lagrangian PINNs: A causality–conforming solution to failure modes of physics-informed neural networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we connect the dimensionality of the problem to the training difficulties in PINNs.\nSpecifically, we provide numerical evidence to connect the decay of singular values of the snapshots to the difficulties in the training phase.\nThis measure corresponds to transport phenomena, convection, traveling waves, and moving fronts.\nAlthough limited attempts were made to quantify connection of dimensionality and slow convergence of some specific classes of ML architectures [ref]21 , many of the questions regarding the choice of activation functions, norms, and architecture remains open [ref]21.\nFormal investigations of such questions are out of the scope of the present paper. In approximation theory, Kolmogorov n–width is a measure of how close\nn–dimensional subspaces can approximate the solution\nmanifold, ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} .\nThe following definitions briefly explains this measure . Definition: Let ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} be a normed linear space and 𝓜~nsubscript~𝓜𝑛\\widetilde{\\bm{\\mathcal{M}}}_{n} any\nn-dimensional subspace of ℳℳ\\mathcal{M}. For each x∈ℳ𝑥ℳx\\in\\mathcal{M}, δ​(x,𝓜~n)𝛿𝑥subscript~𝓜𝑛\\delta\\left(x,\\widetilde{\\bm{\\mathcal{M}}}_{n}\\right) shall denote the distance of the\nn-dimensional subspace 𝓜~nsubscript~𝓜𝑛\\widetilde{\\bm{\\mathcal{M}}}_{n} from x𝑥x, defined by If there exist a y∗∈𝓜~nsuperscript𝑦subscript~𝓜𝑛y^{*}\\in\\widetilde{\\bm{\\mathcal{M}}}_{n} for which δ​(x,𝓜~n)=‖x−y∗‖𝛿𝑥subscript~𝓜𝑛norm𝑥superscript𝑦\\delta\\left(x,\\widetilde{\\bm{\\mathcal{M}}}_{n}\\right)=\\|x-y^{*}\\|, then y∗superscript𝑦y^{*} is the best\napproximation of x𝑥x from 𝓜~nsubscript~𝓜𝑛\\widetilde{\\bm{\\mathcal{M}}}_{n}. Extending the concept from a\nsingle element of x𝑥x to 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S}, a given subset of ℳℳ\\mathcal{M}, the deviation\nof 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} from 𝓜~nsubscript~𝓜𝑛\\widetilde{\\bm{\\mathcal{M}}}_{n} is defined as representing the worst element of x∈𝒮𝑥𝒮x\\in\\mathcal{S} approximated in\n𝓜~nsubscript~𝓜𝑛\\widetilde{\\bm{\\mathcal{M}}}_{n}. Definition: Kolmogorov n–width of ℳℳ\\mathcal{M}, dn​(ℳ)subscript𝑑𝑛ℳd_{n}\\left(\\mathcal{M}\\right), is defined as where the infimum is taken over all n–dimensional subspaces\n(𝓜~nsubscript~𝓜𝑛\\widetilde{\\bm{\\mathcal{M}}}_{n}) of the state space, ℳℳ\\mathcal{M}. In the context of Petrov–Galerkin projection schemes, n–width correlates with the best achievable rate of convergence for a given snapshots .\nThe connection between singular value decomposition (SVD) of the Hankel\noperator and the Kolmogorov n–width is rigorously\nestablished  .\nIt is shown that Kolmogorov n–width  is equivalent to the (n+1)stsuperscript𝑛1st(n+1)^{\\textit{st}} Hankel singular value .\nThe aforementioned studies strictly connected the singular values of the snapshots to convergence of linear subspaces.\nThe extension of such results to non–linear manifolds, such as those discovered through training of PINNs, has not been established yet.\nHowever, we numerically evaluate whether the rate of decay of singular values could be used as a simple a priori guideline to the complexity of the training phase of PINNs. In figs. 1 to 4, the snapshots of the solution and the corresponding singular value decays are plotted for given snapshots of convection equation, reaction equation, reaction–diffusion equation, and Burgers’ equation, where the state variable w=w​(x,t)𝑤𝑤𝑥𝑡w=w(x,t) exists in the domain (x,t)∈[xa,xb]×[0,T]𝑥𝑡subscript𝑥𝑎subscript𝑥𝑏0𝑇(x,t)\\in[x_{a},x_{b}]\\times[0,T], and the PDEs are equipped with initial\nconditions w​(x,0)=w0​(x)𝑤𝑥0subscript𝑤0𝑥w(x,0)=w_{0}(x), and appropriate boundary conditions at xasubscript𝑥𝑎x_{a}, and\nxbsubscript𝑥𝑏x_{b}.\nConvection speed, viscosity, and reaction coefficient are denoted by c𝑐c, ν𝜈\\nu, and ρ𝜌\\rho, respectively. The successful and failing regimes of eqs. 6 to 8\nwere investigated in .\nWe identify Burgers’ equation eq. 9, in certain regimes, as an additional challenging test case for PINNs.\nIn each of these experiments, the solution of the governing equation is depicted in the space–time domain, and the corresponding singular value spectra are also compared,  where σisubscript𝜎𝑖\\sigma_{i} is the ithsuperscript𝑖thi^{\\textit{th}} singular value of the snapshots of the solution. In , it was shown that PINNs for convection become hard to train for c>10𝑐10c>10 (failure modes). Subsequently, the cases with c=0𝑐0c=0 and c=50𝑐50c=50 are compared in fig. 1.\nIt is clear that σ2/σ1subscript𝜎2subscript𝜎1\\sigma_{2}/\\sigma_{1} increases quickly as c𝑐c increases.\nFor the reaction equation, the decay of singular values becomes slower as ρ𝜌\\rho increases, in a similar trend, the PINNs are more difficult to train as ρ𝜌\\rho increases.\nFor the cases of reaction–diffusion in , all cases show similar slow rate of decay of singular values, and in a similar trend, training in all the cases encounters difficulties.\nFinally, we consider Burgers’ equation, a case successfully solved in early studies of PINNs . However, in that case, a viscous shock forms and collapses on its place, without traveling in the domain.\nIn this paper, to impose the shock moving through the domain, the initial condition is offset from zero.\nSimilar to the convection case, the rate of decay of singular values decreases as the speed of the shock is increased.\nSubsequently, similar challenges in training of PINNs for Burgers’ equation in convection–dominated regimes is observed.\nIn such cases, the shock travels in the domain before collapsing/diffusing (see section 4.3). These experiments show that although the neural networks (NNs) can express a non–linear manifold, the dimensionality of the solution on the linear optimal subspace of singular vectors can still inform the convergence behavior of PINNs, for comparable governing equations.\nHowever, the singular value spectra between two different governing equations do not explain difficulty of the training, e.g., collapsing shock has a slower rate of decay of singular values compared to convection with high speed and yet the training phase is well–behaved.\nNevertheless, in all cases the network is hard to train at the presence of traveling features, such as shock, fronts, and gradients. Some of the successful remedies in   1 can be explained by breaking the Kolmogorov n–width, a recognized paradigm in finite element method of solving PDEs  , data assimilation , NNs–based reduced order models (ROMs)   , projection-based ROMs      [ref]40    , flexDeepONet , and projection–based ROMs on NN–based manifolds  .\nTo demonstrate the effect of the proposed remedies on the rate of decay of (normalized) singular values, we consider the synthetic data of fig. 5(a), representing a traveling shock.\nThe snapshot is constructed on Nx=256subscript𝑁𝑥256N_{x}=256 spatial grid points and Nt=500subscript𝑁𝑡500N_{t}=500 time steps. It is shown that in PINNs, accuracy can be increased by over–sampling the traveling shock, in contrast to the uniformly sampled data .\nHere, at each time level 252525 data points are sampled (i) randomly and uniformly, (ii) randomly but weighted where the probability of sampling is proportional to the absolute value of the gradient of the data.\nAs in fig. 5(b), while sampled data has a lower rank compared to the full data, the first singular values of the data remains unchanged when sampled uniformly (a property used in randomized singular value decomposition).\nHowever, the rate of decay of the singular values increases by over–sampling the shock. Parallel–in–time decomposition 1 and sequence-to-sequence learning  decompose the temporal domain into short time intervals.\nThis strategy is similar to principal interval decomposition (PID) (in linear subspace), applied to ROMs [ref]40 and Long short–term memory (LSTM) networks , and effectively reduces the Kolmogorov n–width of the data.\nConsidering the synthetic data, the temporal domain is decomposed to 252525 consecutive time steps, significantly increasing the rate of decay of singular values as in fig. 5(b).\nSubsequently, increasing the temporal domain, decreases the rate of decay.\nDecomposition of the computational domain, in both space and time, is possible using extended PINN s (XPINNs), originally developed to tackle the scalibility of PINNs . Given the numerical evidence in this section, one paradigm to tame the training in PINNs is to reformulate the problem on a manifold such that Kolmogorov n–width is decreased, or equivalently, the rate of decay of the singular values is increased.\nFor non–linear convection–diffusion flows, where convection dominates diffusion, such goal is achievable by reformulating the governing equations on the characteristics curves  .\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: convection, traveling waves, and moving fronts.\nAlthough limited attempts were made to quantify connection of dimensionality and slow convergence of some specific classes of ML architectures [ref]21 , many of the questions regarding the choice of activation functions, norms, and architecture remains open [ref]21.\nFormal investigations of such questions are out of the scope of the present\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
