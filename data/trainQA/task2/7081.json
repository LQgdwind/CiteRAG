Typically, the instance-level methods      start with training a network to predict instance-level labels that are assigned by propagating the bag-level label to each of its instances. They aggregate the predicted instance-level labels to obtain the corresponding bag-level label afterward. However, due to the fact that only a small fraction of positive instances in a bag are associated with a disease in WSIs,\nthe negative instances in a positive bag are often mislabeled. Despite numerous attempts to purify the instance-level labels, empirical studies have consistently shown that instance-level methods exhibit inferior performance compared to their bag-level counterparts [ref]8 [ref]21. Bag-level MIL methods  [ref]7 [ref]8  [ref]21        follow a two-stage learning process: they first embed the instances into feature representation using a pre-trained feature extractor and then perform MIL aggregation to generate bag-level predictions. Previous explorations in bag-level MIL primarily focused on two directions. The first direction is to enhance the MIL aggregator. Following this direction of work, the attention-based MIL   turned the traditional non-parametric poolings, e.g., max/mean-pooling [ref]21, into trainable ones through an attention mechanism. However, initial attempts treated each instance independently without considering their similarities. Many follow-up works addressed this limitation by leveraging graph convolutional networks , non-local attention [ref]7, transformer [ref]8, and knowledge distillation .\nThe second direction is to improve the feature embedding by mainly leveraging self-supervised pre-training [ref]7   . However, these methods need a sufficient amount of data for task-specific training and are computationally expensive. Our work is closely related to , which enhanced the feature embedding through a low-rank guided self-supervised pre-training and improved the attention-based MIL aggregator to harness low-rank property. However, it still requires an extra self-supervised training stage and is tailored to a specific MIL aggregator. In contrast, our work can achieve both feature enhancement and model global instance similarities by a single module, as well as can be incorporated into current MIL methods in a plug-and-play fashion.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: numerous attempts to purify the instance-level labels, empirical studies have consistently shown that instance-level methods exhibit inferior performance compared to their bag-level counterparts [ref]8 [ref]21. Bag-level MIL methods  [ref]7 [ref]8  [ref]21        follow a two-stage learning process: they first embed the instances into feature representation using a pre-trained feature\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
