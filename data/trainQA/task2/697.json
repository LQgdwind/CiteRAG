      "content": "Paper Title: Fluid Composition of Intermittent IoT Energy Services\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a result of the pervasive presence of wireless sensors and embedded systems . Physical things are being connected to the Internet and augmented with sensors, computing resources, and network connectivity. These capabilities may be abstracted as IoT services with functional and non functional properties (i.e., Quality of Service (QoS)) . For example, sensing health-related information by a smartwatch is an IoT service where the functionality is sensing bio-signals from the body. The accuracy of signals and their freshness represent QoS attributes . Crowdsourcing leverages IoT services to create a self-sustained ecosystem. Crowdsourcing IoT services refers to sharing services among nearby IoT devices . Examples of crowdsourced IoT services include computing offloading , environment monitoring , and wireless energy sharing . A smartphone with low battery power may for instance elect to receive energy from nearby wearables using Wifi. The focus in this paper is on wireless energy sharing. The concept of wireless energy sharing (i.e., crowd charging) has been introduced recently to provide IoT users with ubiquitous power access through crowdsourcing . Energy sharing provides a green and convenient alternative to charge IoT devices. For example, a smartwatch can be recharged using the harvested energy of nearby smart shoes. The IoT devices can harvest energy from different sources, i.e., the kinetic movement of IoT users or their body heat [ref]8. Several wireless energy transfer technologies allow the delivery up to 3 Watts power within 5-meter distances to multiple receivers e.g., Energous111https://www.energous.com/ and Wi-Charge222https://wi-charge.com/. Crowdsourcing energy as a service is the process of delivering wireless energy from IoT service providers to IoT users (i.e., consumers). Energy providers participate in the crowdsourced energy ecosystem for the following reasons. They might share energy altruistically to contribute to a green IoT environment. They can also be egotistic since energy is a vital resource for IoT devices. Therefore, providers would not be interested in sharing their energy unless they receive a satisfying incentive to compensate for their resource consumption. There is a body of research that considers incentives for crowdsourced IoT services . In this paper, we focus on composing crowdsourced energy services. We assume that the providers are already incentivized by existing incentive models . The composition of IoT energy services is expected to play an important role in the crowdsourced IoT environment 0. A single energy service may not satisfy the consumer’s requirement. The preferred solution is to select an optimal set of services according to the requirement of the consumer 1. Service composition has been extensively researched 2. IoT services exhibit flexible and dynamic features. Conventional composition techniques may not be a good fit for energy services for the following distinct characteristics: Flexibility. Energy service consumers do not have any lock-in contracts like traditional services. Assuming crowdsourced energy services are represented by time intervals, consumers may invoke services for the full-time interval or only partially according to their preferences. Intermittent behavior. Energy providers may exhibit an intermittent behavior in a confined area at their advertised time. The energy providers do not necessarily commit to their initial advertisement. Energy services do not have any Service Level Agreement (SLA) 1. They may move freely inside the confined area. For example, an IoT user in a coffee shop may go to the counter to place an order and comeback 3. Best-effort composition. There is no failure if the composed services do not fulfill the exact requested energy amount. Any obtained amount is usable by the consumer. Unlike the binary traditional service composition 42, the best-effort composition provides the best possible combination of services in terms of QoS properties and the consumer constraints. We introduce the concept of fluid composition considering the above characteristics of the crowdsourced IoT environment. The novelty of our proposed solution is that intermittent energy services are composed without any lock-in contracts or SLA. The fluid composition permits the partial consumption and re-invocation of intermittent services to collect the maximum amount of energy with the best QoS properties. If one of the component services disconnects temporarily and comeback (i.e., intermittent behavior), the composition framework must decide between waiting for the intermittent service or switching to another service. To the best of our knowledge, existing energy service composition approaches do not consider the mobility and the intermittent behavior of the crowdsourced energy service providers 0. In this paper, we propose a novel model for mobile and intermittent crowdsourced energy services which is a major extension of the deterministic energy service model in 0. The indoor mobility patterns are predictable when people regularly visit confined areas such as restaurants and coffee shops 35. We leverage these mobility patterns to propose a fluid composition approach. The proposed approach finds an optimal selection of services ahead of time after estimating the mobility patterns and the cost of all disconnections and switches between available services. The main contributions are: A novel service model to represent the intermittent behavior of crowdsourced IoT energy services. A heuristic-based fluid composition algorithm to select an optimal set of intermittent IoT energy services.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: a smartwatch can be recharged using the harvested energy of nearby smart shoes.
