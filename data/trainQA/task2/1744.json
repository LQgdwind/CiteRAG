      "content": "Paper Title: API2Com: On the Improvement of Automatically Generated Code Comments Using API Documentations This research is support by a grant from Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada RGPIN-2019-05175.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCode comment generation has a long history using templates based approaches  9 and techniques based on information retrieval  [ref]40.\nSince 2016, many researchers use neural network frameworks for comment generation. Neural network models can outperform the traditional approaches with the existence of large scale datasets. Iyer et al.  first applied the encoder-decoder seq-seq model where the encoder only contains token embedding and the decoder consists of an LSTM layer.\nHu et al. 7 proposed DeepCom which passes the source code to the encoder in a different way. They converted the source code to AST to capture the structural information of the source code. They further introduced a structure-based tree traversal for flattening the generated AST to sequential text and use it as input to the LSTM encoder.\nLeClair et al. [ref]16 improved the performance of the code generation task by capturing both the semantic and structural information of the source code. They used source code as well as flatten AST as input to two GRU encoders, and then results are used in the decoder to generate text.\nAlon et al. [ref]22 introduced a novel flattening technique to traverse AST and convert it to text sequence. They considered various traversal paths and used them as distinct inputs to the LSTM encoder-decoder model.\nWei et al.  consider the relation between code generation and comment generation to improve both tasks. They design a dual training model to incorporate duality on attention weights.\nFeng et al. 3 propose using a natural language - programming language bimodal pre-trained model   for different programming languages. It is initially trained with general-purpose datasets and then is fine-tuned with downstream tasks, including code comment generation. Some studies integrate structural information (AST) into tree-based encoders such as Graph neural network , Tree-LSTM  and Tree-transformer . Allamanis et al.  propose a convolutional network to capture long-range attention knowledge and local time-invariant.\nIn our work, we used flattened AST as the input to one of the encoders. However, our results show that AST downgrades the performance of Transformer slightly.\nThe recent studies incorporate external knowledge to the neural model.\nWei  and Zhang et al.  incorporate information retrieval comment generation methods into neural machine translation models to improve the quality of the output comments.\nGiven a source code snippet, they retrieve the most similar method where the corresponding comment is already available. Then, they exploit this comment as an additional input to the model to enhance the comment generation.\nWang et al.  incorporate the external information to the model including enclosing class name and Unified Modeling Language.\nHaque et al.  integrate enclosing file context as the external knowledge into an attention mechanism to leverage words and tokens within the file to generate comments. They take the signature of other subroutines within the file into account and attempt to capture the relation between these subroutines and target subroutine summaries.\nThe most similar work to our work is the approach of Hu et al. . The authors use the name of the APIs to generate comments. Our work is different with existing works as it uses the API Docs for comment generation, which have not been explored previously. Also, our work is one of the few studies that leverages the Transformer model for comment generation, adding an external knowledge source to this model. There are many studies on comment generation and neural code representation, and in this section we provided a brief overview of the most relevant ones. For a survey on related work, please refer to the living literature review by Allamanis et al. .\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: Code comment generation has a long history using templates based approaches  9 and techniques based on information retrieval  [ref]40.\nSince 2016, many researchers use neural network frameworks for comment generation.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
