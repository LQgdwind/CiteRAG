      "content": "Paper Title: Joint Detection and Localization of Stealth False Data Injection Attacks in Smart Grids using Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn general, there are two main approaches to detect and localize the FDIAs: model-based and data driven approaches [ref]8.\nIn the model-based methods     , a model for the system is built and its parameters are estimated to detect the FDIAs.\nSince there is no training, these methods do not require the historical data.\nHowever, the detection delays, scalability issues and threshold tuning steps can limit the performance and usability of the model-based approaches .\nConversely, the data-driven methods  are system independent and require historical data and a training procedure.\nHowever, they provide scalability and real time compatibility due to the excessive training.\nData driven methods, machine learning (ML) [ref]16, in particular, offer superior performances to detect FDIAs in power systems as the historical datasets are growing [ref]8 .\nTherefore, we employ a data driven approach in this work for detecting and localizing FDIAs in power systems. While there has been a great deal of research on detection of FDIAs, only a few attempts have been made to localize these attacks      .\nSince localization of FDIAs is relatively a newer research subject compared to detection of these attacks, the current approaches proposed in literature suffer from some limitations.\nA multistage localization algorithm based on graph theory results is proposed in  to localize the attack at cluster level.\nNevertheless, the low resolution hinders the benefits of localization in cluster level algorithms.\nIn , a model-driven analytical redundancy approach utilizing Kalman filters is presented for joint detection and mitigation of FDIA in AGC systems.\nIn their model, the authors of  first determine a threshold using the Mahalanobis norm of the residuals of the non-attacked situation.\nAny residue larger than the threshold is regarded as an attacked sample.\nApart from the manual threshold optimization steps, detection times are at the range of seconds in their estimation based models. A generalized modulation operator that is applied on the states of the system is presented as an ongoing work in a brief announcement in  to localize the FDIAs in power systems. Yet, the results are not published as of today.\nAuthors in  present an internal observer-based detection and localization method for FDIA in power systems. They create and assign an interval observer to each measurement device and construct a customized logic localization judgment matrix to detect and localize the FDIA. Nevertheless, their average detection delay is more than 1.1 seconds, which can highly limit their usability in a real life scenario. Lack of scalability and the need for a custom solution requiring manual labor represent additional limitations of this method.\nA Graph Signal Processing (GSP) based approach is developed in  to detect and localize FDIAs using the Graph Fourier Transform (GFT), local smoothness, and vertex-frequency energy distribution methods. Hovewer, the random and easily detectable attacks employed to test their models do not comprehensively assess the actual performance of the models. Besides, manual threshold tuning of graph filters (GFs) brings extra effort for their proposed methods.\nAuthors in  propose physics- and learning-based approaches to detect and localize the FDIAs in automatic generation control (AGC) of power systems.\nWhile the physics-based method relies on interaction variables, the learning-based approach exploits the historical Area Control Error (ACE) data, and utilizes a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network (NN) to generate a model for learning the data pattern.\nNevertheless,  reports results limited to a 5-bus system and assumes training an LSTM model for each measurement.\nThus, the limited number of components deeply confines the large scale attributes of the proposed method.\nFurthermore, training a separate detector for each bus extremely increases the overall model complexity for large systems and reduces its suitability for real world applications.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: In general, there are two main approaches to detect and localize the FDIAs: model-based and data driven approaches [ref]8.\nIn the model-based methods     , a model for the system is built and its parameters are estimated to detect the FDIAs.\nSince there is no training, these methods do not require the historical\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
