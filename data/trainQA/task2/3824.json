      "content": "Paper Title: 1 Introduction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPrior work due to Arora et al.  has shown that without any restrictions on the adversary, and even when 𝒞T=𝒳constsubscript𝒞𝑇subscript𝒳const\\mathcal{C}_{T}=\\mathcal{X}_{\\text{const}}, for any player there exists an adversary such that the player’s constant action policy regret satisfies ℛ𝒳constpol=Ω~​(T)subscriptsuperscriptℛpolsubscript𝒳const~Ω𝑇\\mathcal{R}^{\\text{pol}}_{\\mathcal{X}_{\\text{const}}}=\\widetilde{\\Omega}(T). To prove this lower bound, Arora et al.  construct an adversary that is wholly unrestricted and hence extremely powerful. Thus, to obtain non-trivial upper bounds on even the constant action policy regret, it is necessary to weaken the adversary. One natural type of restriction that has been well studied in prior work, is to restrict the memory of the adversary   . We say that an adversary is m𝑚m-memory bounded if for all t≥m𝑡𝑚t\\geq m, all a1:t∈𝒳tsubscript𝑎:1𝑡superscript𝒳𝑡a_{1:t}\\in\\mathcal{X}^{t}, all a1:t−m′∈𝒳t−msubscriptsuperscript𝑎′:1𝑡𝑚superscript𝒳𝑡𝑚a^{\\prime}_{1:t-m}\\in\\mathcal{X}^{t-m} and all ftsubscript𝑓𝑡f_{t} we have that Hence, an m𝑚m-memory bounded adversary is only permitted to define its loss function based on the player’s most recent m𝑚m actions. Prior work has shown that when m𝑚m is sublinear in T𝑇T and 𝒞Tsubscript𝒞𝑇\\mathcal{C}_{T} is sufficiently restricted (informally, when 𝒞Tsubscript𝒞𝑇\\mathcal{C}_{T} equals or is only slightly larger than 𝒳constsubscript𝒳const\\mathcal{X}_{\\text{const}}), then the player can achieve policy regret ℛ𝒞Tpolsubscriptsuperscriptℛpolsubscript𝒞𝑇\\mathcal{R}^{\\text{pol}}_{\\mathcal{C}_{T}} that is sublinear in T𝑇T    . When m=1𝑚1m=1, then the adversary is oblivious, and we overload notation and write ft​(a1:t)=ft​(at)subscript𝑓𝑡subscript𝑎:1𝑡subscript𝑓𝑡subscript𝑎𝑡f_{t}(a_{1:t})=f_{t}(a_{t}). Notably, for a fixed 𝒞Tsubscript𝒞𝑇\\mathcal{C}_{T}, the policy regret ℛ𝒞Tpolsubscriptsuperscriptℛpolsubscript𝒞𝑇\\mathcal{R}^{\\text{pol}}_{\\mathcal{C}_{T}} equals the traditional regret ℛ𝒞Ttradsubscriptsuperscriptℛtradsubscript𝒞𝑇\\mathcal{R}^{\\text{trad}}_{\\mathcal{C}_{T}} in this scenario. It is well known that against an oblivious adversary, a player can achieve sublinear constant action policy regret . Hence, it is natural to question whether a player can achieve sublinear CPR, when the adversary is oblivious. We show via the following counterexample that this is impossible. Note that the result of the counterexample holds even in the full information feedback model (as opposed to just bandit feedback). A similar result is given by Mohri and Yang [ref]37. Let 𝒳={x1,x2}𝒳subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2\\mathcal{X}=\\{x_{1},x_{2}\\}. To define its sequence of loss functions, the adversary first samples a bit string b𝑏b uniformly at random from {0,1}Tsuperscript01𝑇\\{0,1\\}^{T}. For each t𝑡t, it then defines Attaining sublinear complete policy regret is then equivalent to making a sublinear number of mistakes when guessing the value of btsubscript𝑏𝑡b_{t}. Since this is impossible, we have that 𝔼​[ℛTcp]=Ω~​(T)𝔼delimited-[]subscriptsuperscriptℛcp𝑇~Ω𝑇\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathcal{R}^{\\text{cp}}_{T}\\right]=\\widetilde{\\Omega}(T), where the expectation is over the sampling of b𝑏b and the player’s (possibly randomized) strategy. Crucially, the above counterexample relies on the fact that even though the adversary is oblivious, its loss functions ft,ft′subscript𝑓𝑡subscript𝑓superscript𝑡′f_{t},f_{t^{\\prime}} for t≠t′𝑡superscript𝑡′t\\neq t^{\\prime} are time varying and are constructed independent of each other. In this scenario, the player cannot predict anything about ftsubscript𝑓𝑡f_{t} via knowledge of ft′subscript𝑓superscript𝑡′f_{t^{\\prime}} for t′<tsuperscript𝑡′𝑡t^{\\prime}<t. To evade such counterexamples, a different type of restriction on the adversary’s power is to ensure that some knowledge of ft′subscript𝑓superscript𝑡′f_{t^{\\prime}} leaks some information about ftsubscript𝑓𝑡f_{t}. This motivates the following definition. An m𝑚m-memory bounded adversary is said to be g𝑔g-restricted if the following is true. For each action x∈𝒳𝑥𝒳x\\in\\mathcal{X}, there exists a base function gx:∪m′=1m𝒳m′→ [ref]1:subscript𝑔𝑥→superscriptsubscriptsuperscript𝑚′1𝑚superscript𝒳superscript𝑚′01g_{x}:\\cup_{m^{\\prime}=1}^{m}\\mathcal{X}^{m^{\\prime}}\\to [ref]1, such that Although we are not aware of prior work on online learning that uses g𝑔g-restricted adversaries without additional restriction, in the sequel we will discuss prior work that consider g𝑔g-restricted adversaries with significant additional restrictions  [ref]32    . For now, we note that a g𝑔g-restricted adversary must define loss functions whose value for a fixed input cannot vary with time. With such a restriction, the player can learn information about each gxsubscript𝑔𝑥g_{x} (and hence about ftsubscript𝑓𝑡f_{t}) as the game progresses, and this enables the player to choose better actions over time. This restriction thus precludes the setting of Counterexample 1. When the adversary is g𝑔g-restricted, it is straightforward to achieve CPR bounds that are sublinear in T𝑇T and depend exponentially on m𝑚m. However, throughout our paper we interested in efficiently minimizing CPR, which means we desire bounds that scale polynomially with m𝑚m. Unfortunately, there exist online learning games where the adversary is m𝑚m-memory bounded and g𝑔g-restricted, but it is impossible to efficiently minimize CPR. We demonstrate this in the following counterexample, which holds even in the full information feedback model (as opposed to just bandit feedback). Let 𝒳={x1,x2}𝒳subscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2\\mathcal{X}=\\{x_{1},x_{2}\\}. Sample a tuple b𝑏b of length m−1𝑚1m-1 uniformly at random from 𝒳m−1superscript𝒳𝑚1\\mathcal{X}^{m-1}. Define gx1:∪m′=1m𝒳m′→ [ref]1:subscript𝑔subscript𝑥1→superscriptsubscriptsuperscript𝑚′1𝑚superscript𝒳superscript𝑚′01g_{x_{1}}:\\cup_{m^{\\prime}=1}^{m}\\mathcal{X}^{m^{\\prime}}\\to [ref]1 as Also define gx2=1subscript𝑔subscript𝑥21g_{x_{2}}=1. Via the base functions gx1,gx2subscript𝑔subscript𝑥1subscript𝑔subscript𝑥2g_{x_{1}},g_{x_{2}} we define the adversary’s loss functions as The policy that cyclically plays actions b1,b2​…​bm−1,x1subscript𝑏1subscript𝑏2…subscript𝑏𝑚1subscript𝑥1b_{1},b_{2}\\dots b_{m-1},x_{1} suffers a loss of zero at least once every m𝑚m timesteps. Meanwhile, suffering zero loss for the player is at least as hard as identifying b𝑏b, and a standard “needle in the haystack” argument  shows that this requires Ω~​(2m)~Ωsuperscript2𝑚\\widetilde{\\Omega}(2^{m}) timesteps. Hence we have that 𝔼​[ℛTcp]=Ω~​(min⁡{2m,T}/m)𝔼delimited-[]subscriptsuperscriptℛcp𝑇~Ωsuperscript2𝑚𝑇𝑚\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathcal{R}^{\\text{cp}}_{T}\\right]=\\widetilde{\\Omega}(\\min\\{2^{m},T\\}/m), where the expectation is over the sampling of b𝑏b and the player’s (possibly randomized) strategy. This counterexample demonstrates that even if the adversary is m𝑚m-memory bounded and g𝑔g-restricted, any player suffers CPR that scales exponentially with m𝑚m. So, further restrictions on the adversary are necessary. A natural restriction is to enforce that each gxsubscript𝑔𝑥g_{x} has special structure. This is precisely the approach taken by works on rotting bandits  [ref]32  , improving bandits , single peaked bandits  and congested bandits . Concretely, these works use base functions {gx}x∈𝒳subscriptsubscript𝑔𝑥𝑥𝒳\\{g_{x}\\}_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}} that have the following special “tallying” structure. An m𝑚m-memory bounded and g𝑔g-restricted adversary is said to be hℎh-tallying, if for each x∈𝒳𝑥𝒳x\\in\\mathcal{X} there exists hx:{1,2​…​m}→ [ref]1:subscriptℎ𝑥→12…𝑚01h_{x}:\\{1,2\\dots m\\}\\to [ref]1 such that As discussed by the aforementioned works, this tallying structure is often a natural model in practice. For instance, Heidari et al.  discuss a crowdsourcing setting where an agency utilizes workers to repeatedly perform the same task (such as classifying images) at each timestep. The agency picks a worker at each timestep, with the goal of picking a sequence of workers that makes the fewest number of mistakes when performing the task. Here, it is reasonable that an individual worker’s performance changes as an (unknown) function of the number of times that the worker has already performed the task (for example, due to fatigue), thus motivating the tallying structure. We emphasize that in addition to assuming the adversary is hℎh-tallying, the aforementioned works of Heidari et al. , Levine et al. [ref]32, Seznec et al. , Seznec et al. , Lindner et al.  and Awasthi et al.  make supplemental benign assumptions on the structure of the functions {hx}x∈𝒳subscriptsubscriptℎ𝑥𝑥𝒳\\{h_{x}\\}_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}}, as we detail in Section 5. For instance, the rotting bandit setting of Heidari et al.  assumes that hxsubscriptℎ𝑥h_{x} is an increasing function for each x∈𝒳𝑥𝒳x\\in\\mathcal{X}. Under this benign assumption, they provide algorithms that efficiently minimize CPR. Notably, such strong assumptions on hxsubscriptℎ𝑥h_{x} enable this line of work to (often) tackle the case where m=T𝑚𝑇m=T (although algorithms designed for this case generally do not handle m<T𝑚𝑇m<T), and additionally enables these works to (often) handle the more difficult scenario of when the losses are stochastically observed. This exposes a gap in our understanding of when one can efficiently minimize CPR. In particular, it remains unclear whether we can attain this goal for hℎh-tallying adversaries where we make no assumptions on the structure of each hxsubscriptℎ𝑥h_{x}. This motivates the following question. Assume the adversary is m𝑚m-memory bounded, g𝑔g-restricted and hℎh-tallying. Without any assumptions on the functions {hx}x∈𝒳subscriptsubscriptℎ𝑥𝑥𝒳\\{h_{x}\\}_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}}, and in the bandit feedback model with (possibly) stochastically observed losses, when is it possible to efficiently minimize the complete policy regret? The remainder of this paper is devoted to resolving this question. To this end, in the sequel we define the tallying bandit, and provide upper and lower bounds on the achievable CPR in this setting.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: this is impossible.
