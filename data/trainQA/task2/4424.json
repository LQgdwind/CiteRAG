      "content": "Paper Title: A general-purpose method for applying Explainable AI for Anomaly Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInterpreting the model’s explanation requires the expert to align the observation, prediction, and explanation with the system’s context and a relevant knowledge base . To be successful, the expert must associate the model’s explanation with a particular cause or fault, and then decide to take a corrective action. Anomaly Detection Expert We propose there are three kindes of experts that use eplainable AI: physicus, technicus, and secularus, described in Appendix 0.A. Technicus has a detailed knowledge base of the system, and aims to alter or influence the system in response to known conditions . The explanations should describe the anomaly in its original state and enable the technicus to easily choose the most suitable treatment for the anomaly. The natural objective of XAI is to generate explanations that enable effective interpretation for the expert. Therefore, it is helpful to consider how the human mind recognizes, generalizes and categorizes, and reasons about causality in order to better design explanations. Generalization. Empirical studies in cognitive sciences revealed that humans assign objects to categories based on some notion of distance or dissimilarity between multidimensional stimuli . One prominent generalization theory developed by ,  suggested that distance can be well approximated with Euclidean L2 or City Block L1 distance measures, and stimuli are internalized in some internal metric space called psychological spaces. Experiments with human subjects also indicated that similarity generally follows an exponential decay with distance. Prototypes and Exemplars. It is well established that when categorizing stimulus of a previously unseen object, humans will tend to use previously observed objects as a reference for making their decision. This gave rise to Prototype and Exemplar Theories  [ref]14, where the former suggests that humans remember an anchoring object (i.e., a prototype) when categorizing, and the latter suggests that humans tend to retain multiple examples in memory for a category or concept. Contrastive Explanations.  One of the most important conclusions from a review of explanations for AI drawn from the social sciences, was that good explanations are contrastive [ref]20. Humans perform better in understanding explanations when presented with a contrastive, counterfactual event, and prefer explanations with why did event P happen, instead of counterfactual event Q.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: categorizing stimulus of a previously unseen object, humans will tend to use previously observed objects as a reference for making their decision.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
