      "content": "Paper Title: Combining Classical and Probabilistic Independence Reasoning to Verify the Security of Oblivious Algorithms (Extended Version)\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSide-channel attacks allow attackers to infer sensitive information\nby eavesdropping on a program‚Äôs execution,\nwhen the sensitive data are not directly observable (e.g.¬†because they are encrypted). For example, sensitive documents or secret images can be\nreconstructed by only observing a program‚Äôs memory access pattern   .\nMany algorithms are charged with the protection of secrets\nin application contexts where such attacks are realistic,\nfor example, cloud computing , secure processors   and multiparty computation . The goal of an oblivious algorithm\n(e.g. path ORAM, Melbourne shuffle )\nis to hide its secrets from an attacker that can observe memory accesses. Probabilistic oblivious algorithms aim to do so while achieving better performance than deterministic oblivious algorithms. The various programming disciplines to defend against such attacks for deterministic\nalgorithms¬†  often lead to poor performance: e.g.¬†to hide the fact\nthat an array is accessed at a certain position, one\nmay have to iterate over the entire array¬†[ref]6. Probabilistic oblivious algorithms avoid this inefficiency by performing\nrandom choices at runtime to hide\ntheir secrets from attackers more efficiently. Unfortunately, probabilistic methods for achieving obliviousness are error prone and some have been shown insecure, as a result requiring non-trivial fixes¬†7 1. In this paper we develop a program logic to verify the\nsecurity of probabilistic oblivious algorithms formally and systematically.\nWe adopt the standard threat model for such programs,\nin which the attacker is assumed to be able to infer the memory\naccess pattern (e.g.¬†either by explicitly observing memory requests in case of\nuntrusted/compromised operating system or by measuring the time its own memory\naccesses take due to shared resources like caches)¬†0   2. Although some previous works [ref]4    exist, many oblivious algorithms\nhave complex semantics and invariants that are beyond the reach of those prior methods to reason about.\nFor example, path ORAM  maintains an invariant stating that virtual addresses are independent of\neach other and of the program‚Äôs memory access patterns; whereas\nthe oblivious sampling algorithm  contains secret- or random-variable-dependent random choices, conditional branches and loops,\nwhose details we introduce in Section¬†2 and Section¬†5. Also, to achieve efficiency, some oblivious algorithms    forgo perfection and\nhave a very small probability of failure, which means\nthat they do not perfectly hide their secrets. Fortunately,\nthey are intentionally designed so that the failure probability is bounded\nby some negligible factor (e.g.¬†of the size of the secret data), meaning that they are secure in practice.\nFollowing prior work  , this means that we can prove them secure by reasoning over\nperfectly oblivious approximations, the theoretical and perfect version of the practical algorithms that are free of failure by construction\n(Section¬†0.A.1 justifies this claim).\nProving negligible error probability bounds on oblivious algorithms is an important goal, but is out of scope of this present\nwork. Reasoning over the perfectly oblivious approximations requires an approach that\nsupports for all of the following: Assertions that describe probability distributions and independence; Reasoning about dynamic random choices over secrets and random variables ‚Äì e.g. a random choice of integers from 1 to random secret variable sùë†s; Reasoning about branches that depend on secret random variables; Reasoning over loops that have a random number of iterations. Our approach that addresses these challenges simultaneously. Following preliminaries (Section¬†3), in¬†Section¬†4 we build a program logic\nthat combines classical\nand probabilistic reasoning to address the aforementioned challenges, which we\nprove sound in Isabelle/HOL. Our\nlogic is situated atop the Probabilistic Separation Logic (PSL)¬†[ref]4; proving the soundness of our logic\nrevealed several\noversights in PSL¬†[ref]4, which we fixed (see Section¬†4.4). To our knowledge, the reasoning our logic supports is beyond all prior methods\nfor verifying obliviousness, including PSL¬†[ref]4, ObliCheck¬†, ŒªùëÇùê¥ùê∑ùëásubscriptùúÜùëÇùê¥ùê∑ùëá\\lambda_{\\mathit{OADT}}¬†, and Œªùëúùëèùëôùëñùë£subscriptùúÜùëúùëèùëôùëñùë£\\lambda_{\\mathit{obliv}}¬†.\nThe combination of classical\nand probabilistic reasoning also makes our logic more expressive than previous\nprobabilistic Hoare logics (e.g., 3, VPHL¬† and pRHL¬†)\nwhich, because they lack assertions for describing distributions and independence, are\nill-suited to direct proofs of obliviousness. Finally, we demonstrate the power of our\nlogic by applying it on pen-and-paper to verify, for the first time, the obliviousness of several non-trivial case studies (Section¬†5). Their verification is a significant achievement in that they\nconstitute the fundamental\nbuilding blocks for secure oblivious systems.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: such attacks for deterministic\nalgorithms¬†  often lead to poor performance: e.g.¬†to hide the fact\nthat an array is accessed at a certain position, one\nmay have to iterate over the entire array¬†[ref]6. Probabilistic oblivious algorithms avoid this inefficiency by performing\nrandom choices at runtime to hide\ntheir secrets from attackers more efficiently.
