      "content": "Paper Title: Large Language Models for Compiler Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCompiler pass ordering for performance has been exploited for decades   [ref]26. Over the years there have been several approaches using machine learning  9  9  . The application of machine learning in compilers is not limited to pass order and has been applied to many other problems     . No one has applied LLMs to the problem of pass ordering, we are the first to do so. Neural machine translation is an emerging field that uses language models to transform code from one language to another. Prior examples include compiling C to assembly , assembly to C  , and source-to-source transpilation . In these works code correctness cannot be guaranteed. In our work we use code generation solely as an auxiliary learning task – correctness is supplied by the compiler. Language models have found broad adoption for coding tasks, though few operate at the level of compiler IR. Gallagher et al. train a RoBERTA architecture on LLVM-IR for the purpose of code weakness identification  and Transcoder-IR  uses LLVM-IR as a pivot point for source-to-source translation. Neither use LLMs for optimization as we do. Many language models have been trained on source code including CodeBERT , GraphCodeBERT , and CodeT5  which are trained to perform multiple tasks including code search, code summarization, and documentation generation. LLMs trained on source code have also been used for program fuzzing   , test generation , and automated program repair   . A large number of useful applications have been explored for language models, however, this is the first work where an LLM is used specifically for optimizing code. Most LLMs are trained at least partly on code    . Some LLMs are trained similarly to general models but especially target programming languages and can be used for code completion such as Codex  which powers Copilot . The introduction of fill-in-the-middle capabilities is especially useful for real-world code completion use cases and has become common in recent code models such as InCoder , SantaCoder , StarCoder , and Code Llama . Code Llama was also trained to follow instructions and generate code as well as explain its functionalities. While the multi-terabyte training corpora for these models contain some assembly, we believe that a focused exploration of the value of LLMs in the domain of compilers will be of value to the community. This paper aims to provide that.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: Compiler pass ordering for performance has been exploited for decades   [ref]26.
