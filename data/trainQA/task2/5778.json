      "content": "Paper Title: On the link between generative semi-supervised learning and generative open-set recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nClassifier networks are trained to categorise input data samples into pre-labelled categories. However, classifiers must also be equipped to detect unknown or novel categories that may emerge over time¬†. Two critical applications of novelty detection are 1) automated diagnostic tools¬† and 2) self-driving cars¬†[ref]45. In both cases, misclassifications can lead to fatal consequences. Therefore, to ensure safe classifications, classifiers must be able to detect and separate novel categories that were not present during training but appeared during testing. As per the examples, 1) classifiers should call on human doctors when encountering an unknown disease (e.g. SARS-CoV-2 pre-December 2019¬†), and 2) classifiers must alert driving modules to safely manoeuvre out of the way or demand manual takeover in case of unexpected driving scenes (e.g. unexpected obstacles¬†6, or high-risk scenarios¬†5). Open-set recognition (OSR) considers classification with simultaneous novelty detection. More specifically, OSR tests classifiers‚Äô ability to handle both labelled and novel categories unobserved during training¬†. To do so, OSR defines an open testing domain, meaning trained classifiers must accurately categorise test samples belonging to one of KùêæK labelled categories and separate test samples belonging to unobserved novel categories into an additional K+1ùêæ1K+1‚Äôth unknown category. It is important to note that OSR is independent of the training method used since it only inserts novel categories during the testing phase. However, OSR studies generally apply supervised learning to train classifiers, which is known to be costly in many real-world applications¬†. Instead, training under semi-supervised learning (SSL, which is training off partially labelled datasets) and testing classifiers under the OSR regime would significantly improve the cost-efficiency and practicality of classifier development. SSL and OSR are rarely linked within research. However, SSL and OSR share striking similarities in their proposed training methods, particularly when using generative adversarial networks (GANs) (SSL -¬†9    and OSR -¬†[ref]29 [ref]22 ). Consider a typical closed-set classifying network with a softmax output activation function for K=3ùêæ3K=3 categories depicted in Fig.¬†1(a) and Fig.¬†1(b). A conventional closed-set classifier learns an embedding space that covers the entire domain. In other words, the model embeds different classification boundaries for each category that would maximally separate the categories from one another, leaving no space open. However, maximising boundaries is insufficient for SSL¬† and OSR¬†. More specifically, SSL classifiers must also generalise the complementary space¬†9  (see Fig. 2(a)), and OSR classifiers must generalise the open space¬† (see Fig. 2(b)). This study will show that generalising the complementary space inherently generalises the open space as well. As to say, SSL-GANs and OSR-GANs achieve the same goal. The specific methodology behind SSL-GANs and OSR-GANs is to generalise an additional K+1ùêæ1K+1‚Äôth category to represent the necessary embedding spaces as theorised in each field. As previously mentioned, SSL-GANs aim to generalise the complementary space in the K+1ùêæ1K+1‚Äôth category and OSR-GANs aim to generalise the open space in the K+1ùêæ1K+1‚Äôth category. To do so, SSL-GANs and OSR-GANs design their generators to produce samples that, when pseudo-labelled into the K+1ùêæ1K+1‚Äôth category, ensures that the classifier will generalise the necessary embedding spaces. However, it is interesting that SSL-GANs and OSR-GANs rely on these generated samples looking ‚Äôbad‚Äô by some theoretical definition. This study postulates that bad-looking generated samples in both SSL-GAN and OSR-GAN studies are the same in that both lie in the complementary space. Then, when pseudo-labelling generated samples in the complementary space into the K+1ùêæ1K+1‚Äôth category, SSL and OSR classifiers both generalise the open space. To prove that SSL-GANs and OSR-GANs operate in the same manner, two GAN models are theoretically described and experimentally compared. For SSL, we study feature-matching (FM)-GANs¬†9, which set the foundation of complementary space theory. For OSR, we study adversarial reciprocal point (ARP)-GANs¬†, which exhausts open space theory to achieve state-of-the-art OSR results. Each GAN is thoroughly described concerning its setup and loss functions, specifically emphasising their definitions of the K+1ùêæ1K+1‚Äôth category. These descriptions make it clear that both models aim to produce samples in the complementary space, and that both models define their K+1ùêæ1K+1‚Äôth categories as a regularisation category. In other words, SSL-GANs and OSR-GANs use bad-looking generated samples to regularise their classifying networks. To prove these findings, FM-GANs and ARP-GANs are compared under the same experimental setups. Considering that both achieve near identical results, we can conclude the SSL-OSR link under the GAN context. Given the SSL-OSR link, it is also important to develop benchmark results for this newly discovered field. Consequently, we experiment with several GANs to determine the best performer for SSL-OSR experiments. Specifically, we experiment with Bad-GANs¬†, Margin-GANs¬† and Triple-GANs¬†, and find that Margin-GANs outperform the other models. Finally, we also discuss various applications of SSL-OSR, with the aim of promoting this field to a variety of research spaces. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows - Section¬†2 provides background information on SSL, OSR, and the previous research on the links between these fields; Section¬†3 provides the necessary theory on FM-GANs and ARP-GANs; Section¬†4 conducts experiments; Section¬†5 discusses applications of the new SSL-OSR field; and Section¬†6 concludes the study.\n\nReference markers found: [45]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]45: must also be equipped to detect unknown or novel categories that may emerge over time¬†.
