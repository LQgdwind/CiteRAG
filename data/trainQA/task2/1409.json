      "content": "Paper Title: POPO: Pessimistic Offline Policy Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOne of the main driving factors for the success of the mainstream machine learning paradigm in open-world perception environments (such as computer vision, natural language processing) is the ability of high-capacity function approximators (such as deep neural networks) to learn inductive models from large amounts of data [ref]1 . Combined with deep learning, reinforcement learning (RL) has proven its great potential in a wide range of fields such as playing Atari games , playing chess, Go and shoji , beating human players in StarCraft  etc. However, it turns out that reinforcement learning is difficult to extend from physical simulators to the unstructured physical real world because most RL algorithms need to actively collect data due to the nature of sequential decision making, which is very different from the typical supervised learning setting. In this paper, we study how to utilize RL to solve sequential decision-making problems from a fixed data set, i.e., offline RL, a.k.a. batch RL, which is opposite to the research paradigm of active, interactive learning with the environment.\nIn the physical world, we can usually obtain static data from historical experiences more easily than dynamics data, such as scheduling a region’s power supply system. There are problems with model deviation for such a scenario, and too expensive for manufacturing a simulator. Therefore, learning from static datasets is a crucial requirement for generalizing RL to a system where the data collection procedure is time-consuming, risky, or expensive.\nIn principle, if assumptions about the quality of the behavior policies that produced the data can be satisfied, then we can use imitation learning (IL) [ref]6 to get a strong policy. However, many imitation learning algorithms are known to fail in the presence of suboptimal trajectories or to require further interaction with the environment in which the data is generated from [ref]7  . Many off-policy RL methods have proven their excellent sample-efficiency in complex control tasks or simulation environments recently   . Generally speaking, off-policy reinforcement learning is considered to be able to leverage any data to learn skills. However, in practice, these methods still fail when facing arbitrary off-policy data without any opportunity to interact with its environment. Even the off-policy RL method would fail given high-quality expert data produced by the same algorithm. This phenomenon goes against our intuition about off-policy RL because if shown expert data, then exploration, RL’s intractable problem, no longer exists. The sensitivity of existing RL algorithms to data limits the broad application of RL. We aim to develop a completely offline RL algorithm, which can learn from large, arbitrarily static datasets. Our contributions are summarized as follows. Firstly, we show that a critical challenge arises when applying value-based algorithms to completely offline data that the estimation gap of the value function. When we evaluate the value function, the inability to interact with the environment makes it unable to eliminate the estimation gap through the Bellman equation. This gap can lead to the value function’s catastrophic estimation issue for data that the actions do not appear in the data set. Secondly, We propose a novel offline policy optimization method, namely Pessimistic Offline Policy Optimization (POPO), where the policy utilizes a pessimistic distributional value function to approximate the true value, thus learning a strong policy. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of POPO111Refer to https://github.com/sweetice/POPO for our code. by comparing it with SOTA offline RL methods on the MuJoCo locomotion benchmarks . Furthermore, we conduct fine-grained experiments to verify POPO reflects the principles that informed its development.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: (such as computer vision, natural language processing) is the ability of high-capacity function approximators (such as deep neural networks) to learn inductive models from large amounts of data [ref]1 .
