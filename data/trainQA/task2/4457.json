      "content": "Paper Title: Encoding Concepts in Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph Neural Network Explainer (GNNExplainer,  [ref]12) represents the first seminal work on GNN explainability. Specifically, GNNExplainer maximizes the mutual information between GNN predictions and the distribution of possible subgraphs for explanations. By focusing on individual predictions, the method is limited to explaining one instance at a time corresponding to a localized view of the data distribution. To get a full picture, Ying et al. [ref]12 suggest to perform subgraph matching on a substantial number of instances. However, this is not scalable as subgraph matching is NP-Hard [ref]12. In an attempt to alleviate this issue, the Parameterised Graph Explainer (PGExplainer, [ref]13) and the Probabilistic Graphical Model Explainer (PGM-Explainer, ) parametrize the process of generating explanations using deep neural networks to provide multi-instance explanations. However, all these methods remain fundamentally limited in their locality as they cannot explain a class of samples in its entirety. In contrast, GCExplainer   fills the gap of global explainability for GNNs using concept-based explanations. While the existing explainability techniques begin to address the lack of insight into the computations of GNNs, they are all post-hoc methods whose goal is to explain a trained GNN, not to make it more interpretable. The proposed method instead aims at filling this knowledge gap by making GNNs explainable by design. From a broader perspective, our work borrows ideas from supervised and unsupervised concept-based methods. These methods have been explored in various ways for other neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks     [ref]20 and recurrent architectures . From supervised concept-based methods, our approach inherits the ability to perform effective human interventions at concept level extending Concept Bottleneck Models [ref]20 to graphs. As for unsupervised methods, our approach mainly draws from the Automatic Concept Extraction algorithm (ACE, ). The algorithm extracts visual concepts by performing k-Means clustering  on image segments in the activation space of a convolutional network. The ACE approach is based on the observation that the learned activation space is similar to human perceptual judgement . This was the main motivation behind GCExplainer, as well as our approach. However, in contrast to ACE and GCExplainer, we embed the clustering step within the network architecture, making GNNs explainable by design.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: Graph Neural Network Explainer (GNNExplainer,  [ref]12) represents the first seminal work on GNN explainability.
