      "content": "Paper Title: Parametric Representation for Singing Voice Synthesis: a Comparative Evaluation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe field of singing synthesis has been steadily growing in maturity as many diverse techniques are being proposed and developed. Thanks to the similarities between singing and speech signals, techniques developed for speech synthesis undeniably influence the field, although direct applications have varying amounts of success due to some key differences.\nSome of the more significant differences of singing from speech are, the much wider pitch ranges, greater dynamic range, and significantly longer sustained voiced sounds. The effects of source-filter interaction are greater and harder to neglect, in contrast to the commonly-made assumption in speech . Additionally, the diversity of singer categories and singing techniques makes it difficult to approach the problem of modeling singing in a straightforward manner, even when constrained to a single discipline of singing. As a direct consequence of such difficulties, many existing singing synthesizers have limited scope, generally working better for one singing technique or singer category at the expense of others. Therefore there exists a wide gap between the capabilities of existing synthesizers and the expressive range of human singers, as well as the performative requirements of musicians wishing to use these tools. Among existing systems, Harmonic plus Noise Modeling (HNM) has been used extensively . In the Vocaloid  system, a degree of control is obtained over a unit concatenation technique by integrating HNM , though the synthesis results are still confined in singing space to the range of the pre-recorded samples. In the CHANT  and FOF  systems, rule-based descriptions characterizing some opera voices are integrated, yielding remarkable results for soprano voices. Meron obtained convincing results for lower registers of singing by applying the non-uniform unit selection technique to singing synthesis . Similar strategies have been applied to formant synthesis, articulatory synthesis  and Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based synthesis methods [ref]9, but the limitations in vocal expression range have been quite similarly limited. Among the mentioned approaches, the HMM-based statistical parametric synthesis is of particular interest due to its flexibility and capability to be adapted to different circumstances. An immediate and fundamental question in this approach is the choice of parametric representation of signals. The limitations of any representation are unavoidably present in the synthesis, and often create the quality bottleneck. Many existing vocoders have been used to generate and synthesize from parameters modeled and generated by HMM-based signals. We can generally group the state-of-the-art vocoders into three categories with representative examples: i) Source-filter with residual modeling: Pulse vocoder, Deterministic plus Stochastic Model (DSM) 01, Closed-Loop Training 2, Mixed Excitation 3, STRAIGHT 4\nii) Sinusoids+noise models: Harmonic plus Noise Model (HNM) 5, Harmonic/Stochastic Model (HSM) 6, Sinusoidal Parametrization 7\niii) Glottal modeling: GlottHMM 8 and variants 90, Glottal Post-filtering 1, Glottal Spectral Separation 2, Separation of Vocal-tract and Liljencrants-Fant model plus Noise (SVLN) 3. As mentioned earlier, some of these vocoders have already been used in singing synthesizers. However, not all of them are suitable for statistical modeling, and their performance on singing is largely unknown. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the performance of a subset of these vocoders that are suitable for statistical modeling on a large variety of singing sounds by subjective listening tests, along with the conventional pulse vocoder to provide a baseline. More specifically, DSM 1, GlottHMM 0 and HNM 5 methods were selected for comparison. The choice of methods was motivated by covering different vocoder families. The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the vocoders selected for comparison. Section 3 presents the database used in the evaluation and the experimental protocol, as well as the results and their discussion. Section 4 concludes the paper.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: non-uniform unit selection technique to singing synthesis .
