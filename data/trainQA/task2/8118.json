      "content": "Paper Title: Presheaf automata\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe have introduced presheaf automata as a generalisation of different\nvariants of higher-dimensional automata, introducing in particular\nd-categories as a generalisation of the index categories that generate\nthem. We have shown that standard automata can be modelled as presheaf\nautomata as well, and likewise, as a more substantial contribution, Petri nets\nwithout a safety assumption. We have also outlined the foundations of\na language theory for presheaf automata, including definitions of\nregular and rational languages and a notion of open map for presheaf\nautomata, which forms the basis for notions of bisimulations. These\nconcepts may lead to analoga of classical theorems for automata, such\nas Kleene‚Äôs theorem, the Myhill-Nerode theorem or the\nB√ºchi-Elgot-Trakhtenbrot theorem for some instances of presheaf\nautomata, extending recent work on higher-dimensional\nautomata¬† [ref]10 . There is a long history of categorical approaches to standard automata\nand a vast literature on the topic, starting, to our knowledge, with\nwork by Eilenberg and Wright\n[ref]7, and both from an\nalgebraic and a coalgebraic point of view, as the following\nrepresentative texts show¬†[ref]1 4. A\nrecent functorial approach to standard automata has been described by\nColcombet and Petrisan¬†, who\ncite¬† as an early predecessor. A presheaf approach\nto standard automata has been proposed by\nRosenthal¬†3, but using relational presheaves, which\nare lax functors ùíûop‚Üíùêëùêûùê•‚Üísuperscriptùíûopùêëùêûùê•\\mathcal{C}^{\\textup{op}}\\to\\mathbf{Rel} into the category\nof sets and binary relations. Both approaches have little relationship\nto ours. There is also a long line of work on transition systems and Petri nets\nas presheaves, starting\nwith¬†. The seminal article of\nMeseguer and Monanari 2 is\nsimilar in spirit to our examples in later sections, but it emphasises\nsymmetric monoidal categories, which are not explicit in our work,\nwhile presheaves are missing. Formalising cubical sets as presheaves,\nas well as their simplicial or globular counterparts, is standard in\nmathematics. van Glabbeek 6 and\nsubsequently Goubault and Mimram \nhave previously related higher-dimensional automata with other models\nof concurrency, including transition systems, event structures or\nPetri nets. By contrast, all comparisons from the previous sections\nare original, to our knowledge, Beyond the language-theoretic perspective mentioned above, we envisage\ntwo main avenues for future work. Obviously, d-functors induce natural\ntransformations between presheaves over the source and target\nd-categories. This provides tools for translating between different\ninstances of presheaf automata. A natural question asks for conditions\non d-functors that preserve various properties of presheaf automata.\nFurther, the relation between presheaf automata and monoidal\nstructures in concurrency, as for instance in\n2, remains to be explored,\nsee also the work of Grandis and Mauri for a monoidal approach to\ncubical sets¬†, the work of Sassone and\nSoboci≈Ñski and subsequently Baez and Master on open Petri nets in\nthe setting of symmetric monoidal bicategories and double\ncategories¬†5 , as well as more recent work on\nPetri nets by Baez et al¬†; see finally\n for a definition of parallel composition of\nhigher-dimensional automata in terms of a tensor.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: automata, such\nas Kleene‚Äôs theorem, the Myhill-Nerode theorem or the\nB√ºchi-Elgot-Trakhtenbrot theorem for some instances of presheaf\nautomata, extending recent work on higher-dimensional\nautomata¬† [ref]10 .
