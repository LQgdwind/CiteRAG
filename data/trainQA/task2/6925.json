      "content": "Paper Title: Efficacy of Neural Prediction-Based Zero-Shot NAS\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNeural Architecture Search (NAS) aims to automate the discovery of top-performing neural network architectures via substituting or enhancing the expert-driven design process with an algorithmic exploration mechanism    . Since traditional NAS procedures require models to be fully trained, they cost a lot of computational resources. To reduce the computational burden of NAS procedures, two promising paradigms have emerged: Prediction-based NAS     [ref]9 and Zero-Shot NAS 0 1 2 3. Prediction-based NAS is created to evaluate the performance of fewer neural networks by efficiently interpret the data. The research is currently dominated by neural models  4. They are able to evaluate the performance of architectures within a search space, using only a small sample from that search space. It implies that neural networks can generalize extremely well within the search space consisting of the sample these neural networks learned from. However, the learned representation from prediction-based NAS cannot be reused to search in another search space due to some inherent differences between these spaces, making a prediction-based NAS process costly in many applications. This limitation of prediction-based NAS is largely based on different NAS search spaces using different types of layers while most prediction-based NAS relies on one-hot encoding to represent these layers (all current graph-learning-based, for example:  [ref]9). Zero-Shot NAS is created to consume less resource per evaluated architectures by being able to measure the performance of architectures without training them. To conduct architecture performance measurement, Zero-Shot NAS procedures utilize a performance estimator or an ensemble of these. These performance estimators are crafted through expert knowledge based on empirical results. Simple forms of performance can be the depth or the width of neural network architectures, while modern performance estimators are based on insights on trainability and expressivity. These estimators are quick to compute, usually cost around one forward pass. If they can accurately predict the performance of a neural network, they can speed up the design process. In the meantime, while research is being conducted to improve zero-shot NAS, it does not currently have comparable accuracy to prediction-based NAS  0. Moreover, many of them rely on well-defined features like capacity, expressivity, and SGD-trainability 0 3 1. These features, easy to understand at first glance, have a strong positive link with how well neural networks work. But to build a theory around neural network performance or design the architecture by hand, we need deep expertise. Often, handcrafted architectures are designed to boost certain metrics, like having bigger kernel sizes, wider models, or more layers. Therefore, the process of making handcraft neural network architecture performance predictors is the encapsulation of expert knowledge. However, relying on expert knowledge to design neural networks does not align with automated discovery of neural network architectures. This is a natural question: “Can neural networks interpret neural network architecture performance?” Using machine learning models to understand this falls under Prediction-based NAS, and there is a problem. The common method of using one-hot vectors to represent neural operators does not work well with the variety of neural operators. Therefore, we need a different encoding method for neural operators. We notice that each neural network gives a unique set of outputs carrying key structural details about the network, even if it looks like raw data that’s tough to decipher at first. Given this, deep learning shows promise in helping us understand this data, especially since it’s known for processing complex information. In this study, we aim to show that neural prediction-based NAS can make good zero-shot NAS. Our procedure can be described in Figure 1, where solid arrows and the dashed arrows describe the novel Prediction-based Zero-Shot NAS procedure and prior alternatives, respectively. We mitigate the limitation of prediction-based NAS paradigm we raised above by creating neural-based architectural performance predictors appropriate to a wide range of search space. By being able to use these neural-based architectural performance predictors, they can effectively function as performance predictors in Zero-Shot NAS paradigm. First, we propose a representation mechanism to substitute neural network operators with components that resemble the operators being substituted. This design methodology can well-adapt future neural operations, for example, convolution represents convolution. Our proposed Fourier-Transform-based representation for convolution layers provides a procedure to encode all kinds of convolutional layers. It proved itself capable to capture topological information of the convolutional layer by achieving a higher score-accuracy correlation in prediction-based NAS for NAS-Bench-201 5, many zero-shot NAS score-accuracy correlation test settings 6 5 7 8, and usefulness in conducting end-to-end NAS in a huge NAS search space 3. Second, we propose a new efficient optimization scheme that works for training on single and multiple architectural search spaces. The new optimization scheme improves the convergence rate of neural performance predictors. It allows them to be trained on large-scale datasets or to be trained within a small computational budget. Finally, we propose a way to ensemble multiple proxies, either to provide more reliable indicators or to mitigate visible weaknesses of certain performance predictors. This paper is organized as follows. Section II presents existing work related to this article. Section III presents the mechanisms, optimization method, and search algorithm of NAS process. Section IV shows the results of the proposed method in both prediction-based NAS and zero-shot NAS test settings in diverse benchmark and real search spaces. Section V provides certain interpretation of the results and limitations of the study. Finally, section VI presents the conclusions and future directions toward zero-shot NAS designed by machines.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: require models to be fully trained, they cost a lot of computational resources.
