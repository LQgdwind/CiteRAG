      "content": "Paper Title: AEFE: Automatic Embedded Feature Engineering For Categorical Features\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe early feature crossing technique applied to high-dimensional sparse features is derived from the optimization of the binomial kernel method . Subsequently, POLY2 [ref]16 is proposed to use the binomial transformation to achieve feature crossing. However, due to the high feature dimension, such models encounter the problem of excessive parameter space and over-fitting. To alleviate the excessively large parameter space of the crossing feature, FM [ref]5 attaches the weight of the crossing feature to the inner product between the latent vectors of corresponding features. Owing to its pleasing effect, improving FM becomes an important research direction. Higher-order Factorization Machines (HOFM)  extends the matrix factorization of FM to tensor factorization to achieve higher-order feature crossing. Xiao  apply the attention mechanism to obtain the weight of second-order terms and propose Attentional Factorization Machines(AFM). Field-aware Factorization Machines(FFM)  uses field information additionally to improve the prediction effect. Each feature uses different latent vectors to calculate the interaction with corresponding fields. Pan  proposes Field-weighed Factorization Machine(FwFM) to model the weights of field pairs, reducing the number of parameters compared with FFM. Furthermore, FM can be regarded as a network model with only an embedding layer and a hidden crossing layer [ref]21. From this perspective, FM may be used as an approach to train the embedding layer, which not only maps high-dimensional sparse features to dense vectors but also captures second-order feature crossing. Zhang et al.  proposed Factorization-Machine Supported Neural Networks (FNN), which pre-train the embedding vectors of features with FM and feed them into DNN next. Similar to FNN, Neural Factorization Machines (NFM) uses the Bi-interaction layer to subdivide the inner product of FM, generalizes FM with a deep learning structure . Deepfm  replaced the wide part of the Wide&Deep model with FM. The commonness of these models is that after embedding the categorical features, the second-order crossing information and the high-order nonlinear crossing information are captured by FM and DNN, respectively. These models may be referred to as \"FM-embedding deep learning models\". Training the embedding vector containing feature crossing information does not necessarily require the use of FM. For example, Product-based Neural Network (PNN) replaces the FM layer with a product layer, which captures different crossing patterns by inner product or outer product . Besides, Deep&Cross Network (DCN)  and eXtreme Deep Factorization Machines (xDeepFM) , utilize Cross Net and Compress Interaction Network (CIN) respectively to learn specific orders of explicit feature crossing, while the former interact features at the bit-wise level and the latter at the vector-wise level. XDeepInt  then ensemble a Polynomial Interaction Network (PIN) to learn both vector-wise and bit-wise level feature interactions. In addition, it is acceptable to use CNN   or directly use DNN  [ref]21 to model feature interaction. Whatâ€™s more, extensive research proposed various models to learn feature crossing, e.g., Deep Crossing , Deep and Shallow Layers (DSL) , and Fi-GNN  which applied Graph Neural Network, just to name a few. The models mentioned above can learn different order feature crossing, especially the state-of-the-art deep learning models that can capture non-linear crossing. However, the large amount of parameters makes them only suitable for applications with a large amount of data. Moreover, they have problems of low prediction stability and difficult tuning, compared with the pattern of feature engineering plus traditional machine learning. To handle it, recently, NAS was used to find appropriate layers for different feature interactions. It focuses on leveraging mining of the high-order feature interactions and the complexity of model architectures. Inspired by DARTs 0, a novel algorithm for differentiable NAS, AutoFIS  introduce a gate for each feature interaction on FM layer in training procedure to find useful combinational features in inference step. AutoFeature  then explores feature interactions on each order of feature fields based on their pre-defined operations including Pointwise Addition, Hadamard Product, Concatenation, Generalized Product, and Null. On the contrary, AutoGroup  defines a fixed feature interaction function extending from FM but explores which feature is useful in which order interaction. The application of NAS hasnâ€™t changed the functions of basic feature interaction. A benchmark conducted by Zhu 1 indicates that designing a novel architecture meets the bottleneck in pursuing better performance. Besides, either the implicit crossing feature learned by DNN or the explicit crossing feature learned by PNN, CIN, GNN, PIN, etc., makes the modelâ€™s interpretability weak, which leads to the fact that in some business scenarios, the prediction results cannot give valuable feedback to the data collection and preprocessing stages. Taking the online recommendation system as an example, the deep learning model can give accurate recommendation items, but it is difficult to know which context information or what combinatorial features are working to select this item. Guo 2 conducts experiments to explore the understanding of DNN on CTR prediction problems through visualization, yet its work mainly analyzes the internal mechanism of DNN and gives no guiding analysis from the business level.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: The early feature crossing technique applied to high-dimensional sparse features is derived from the optimization of the binomial kernel method .
