      "content": "Paper Title: Two-phase Dual COPOD Method for Anomaly Detection in Industrial Control System\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis subsection describes the proposed methodâ€™s performance on the WADI dataset compared to previous work evaluated on the same dataset. During training, the WADI training dataset is passed through the first stage of the TPD COPOD method for any noise and unwanted signals to be removed. The total number of dimensions (features) consisting of both discrete and continuous values of the training dataset is 119. The clean WADI data consisting of 706,114 samples were separated into discrete and continuous samples for phase 2 of the TPD COPOD. The computer used for analysis required 13.80s to train the phase 2 models and 19.64s to make predictions on the test data consisting of 172800 samples. The WADI dataset has been utilized for anomaly detection by SVM [ref]49 KNN [ref]49, AE [ref]49, FB [ref]49, EGAN [ref]49, GAN [ref]49, Deep Autoencoding Gaussian Model (DAGMM) [ref]54, Long-short Term Memory Variational Autoencoder (LSTM-VAE) [ref]55 and DIF , and Graph Deviation Network (GDN) . Table II shows a comparison of evaluation results between previous work and the proposed method. Table II shows that TPD COPOD has superior performance to all previous work in terms of F1-score and recall. TPD COPOD achieved an F1-score of 92%percent9292\\%, precision of 82%percent8282\\%, and recall of 86%percent8686\\%. The high recall and F1-score values of TPD COPOD reflect its robustness and ability to confidently detect WADI dataset anomalies as compared to previous work. Although LSTM-VAE and GDN achieved higher precision values as compared to the proposed method in this study, LSTM-VAE and GDN models have significantly low recall values of 27%percent2727\\% and 40.2%percent40.240.2\\%, respectively. The low recall values of LSTM-VAE and GDN resulted in poor F1-scores of 25%percent2525\\% and 57%percent5757\\%, respectively. The outstanding performance of TPD COPOD across all performance metrics could be attributed to the noise removal from the training data in phase 1 during model training. Phase 2 of the method in Figure 4 trains on clean training data, arguably a true representation of the normal operation of the WADI testbed.\n\nReference markers found: [49]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]49: for analysis required 13.80s to train the phase 2 models and 19.64s to make predictions on the test data consisting of 172800 samples.
