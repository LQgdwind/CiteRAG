      "content": "Paper Title: Procedural Generation of 3D Maps with Snappable Meshes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe use of PCG for creating maps and levels in computer games began in the 1970’s with games\nsuch as Beneath Apple Manor and Rogue , and is unarguably the\nmost common use case of PCG in games . Academic interest in this area\nhas been growing, with a number of important developments occurring in the last 15 years [ref]10 . PCG techniques are often fully autonomous, in the sense that the user simply performs some initial\nconfiguration, such as defining parameters and/or output constraints, before content is generated.\nRecently, mixed-initiative\ncontent creation (MICC) techniques, in which a combination of human input and computer-assisted\nPCG are used, have gained traction in game development in general and map design in particular\n . However, the line that separates autonomous PCG\nand MICC-PCG is ill-defined. For example, Yannakakis & Togelius \nclaim that “the PCG process is autonomous when the initiative of the designer is limited to\nalgorithmic parameterizations before the generation starts”. Then, how to classify a PCG technique\nthat works according to this statement, but produces results which mainly depend on\ndesigner-provided building blocks, such as the one presented in this paper? Although we do not\nprovide a definitive answer, this question guides the type of related works discussed in this\nsection. More specifically, we will focus on PCG methods and tools for creating maps and levels in\nwhich the human designer has considerable influence on the look and feel of the generated output,\nirrespective of whether the PCG algorithm tends to be more autonomous (i.e., the designer specifies\nthe parameters and possibly provides the building blocks) or works in a more MICC fashion, where\nhuman and computer iteratively collaborate on the design process. Tanagra is one such MICC tool for 2D platformers , allowing human designers\nto partially specify a level’s geometry and pacing, leaving it up to the computer to fill in the\ngaps. Using constraint programming, Tanagra guarantees that the generated levels are playable\nwhen human-defined constraints are valid. Occupancy-regulated extension (ORE)  is a 2D geometry assembly algorithm\nthat, similar to the algorithm presented in this paper, (i) creates maps from premade pieces (or\nchunks), and, (ii) delegates context and chunk selection to separate subroutines. However,\ncontrary to the snappable meshes technique, ORE utilizes the potential positions a player might\noccupy in a chunk during play to determine which other chunks are adequate for combination, thus\nrequiring pieces of geometry annotated with gameplay information. PCG can be used together with pre-established level design patterns to generate desirable\nlevels. Two proposals have employed a MICC approach, where the contribution from the level\ndesigners is used in the optimization process of the generators’ evolutionary\nalgorithm [ref]15 . This way, their accumulated knowledge of\nlevel design is fed into the generators, refining not only level layouts but also agent and\nitem placement on each iteration. This is accomplished by identifying and then reinforcing\nthe level design patterns in the heuristics, leading to both playable and enjoyable\nexperiences. Sentient Sketchbook [ref]17 is a MICC level design tool for strategy games,\nwhere designers sketch maps while being presented with similar, more detailed alternatives.\nThese recommendations are presented in real time using evolutionary search and employing gameplay\nmetrics—such as balance, exploration, resources or navigability—as fitness dimensions. A number of 3D map and level generation approaches have also been proposed. SuSketch\n, aimed at generating first-person shooter levels, is one such case.\nLike Sentient Sketchbook, the user provides the initial designs and the tool offers alternative\nlayouts and feedback on a number of gameplay metrics in a full MICC fashion. Additionally, SuSketch\nalso provides gameplay predictions which take into account different character classes. FPSEvolver is a 3D MICC generation proposal in which the human contribution for level design\ncomes from the players themselves. It consists of a multiplayer shooter featuring a novel\ngrid-based interactive evolution approach for generating maps according to the players’\npreferences . Players vote on a selection of evolving scenarios,\nwith the goal of generating levels in accordance with what they consider to be a good map. Oblige is a 3D level generator for the DOOM family of games .\nIt allows the level designer to set a number of parameters, such as level size and\napproximate quantities of each type of monster, power-up and level section (e.g. outdoors,\ncaves, hallways, etc). Levels are created using shape grammars on a grid-based layout,\nand are limited to a single floor—an inherent limitation of the DOOM family of games. Butler et al.  explored MICC-based PCG in the context of macro level\ndesign, where the focus is the entire player experience and not just single levels. Their\nsolution relies on a set of authoring tools where level designers can define progression\nconstraints that lead to the generation of a progression plan. The solution then generates\nand/or validates the individual level designs against the progression plan. Regarding recent commercial applications, map and/or level PCG has been employed for level\ncreation in a number of games, namely 2D roguelikes such as Spelunky Classic\n, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth \nand Enter the Gungeon . Spelunky uses premade room\ntemplates to fill out a grid. Rooms with specific characteristics such as top entrances and\nbottom pits are considered when generating levels in order to create a valid path for the\nplayer to traverse towards the end  . In\nThe Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, maps are created by connecting several rooms together,\nfit into a grid  . However, each\nroom may take more than one grid space, and each grid space it occupies can be connected to other\nrooms on adjacent grid spaces. This allows for large rooms to connect to small rooms and\nvice-versa. Enter the Gungeon does not connect its rooms directly to one another,\nemploying a more complex algorithm to obtain the desired layout. It uses nodes and connectors,\nplacing different premade rooms as those nodes and afterwards creating corridors to join the\nrooms for the final map layout . Generate Worlds  is a commercial tool for creating 3D\nmaps from user-provided voxel tiles or blocks. It uses a very simple premise: two blocks\nare only adjacently placed if they have the same color in all the places where they touch,\nin a similar fashion to Wang tiles , often used for image and\ntexture generation  . If the user carefully designs\nthese blocks, the method is able to generate varied and interesting content, from dungeons\nto landscapes. Generate Worlds builds on a previously proposed open-source tool\n, and essentially solves the constraint satisfaction problem\nof correctly tiling blocks according to their colors. The Wave Function Collapse (WFC)\nfamily of algorithms, initially proposed by Maxim Gumin , takes these\nideas further, requiring only one input example (e.g., an image) and a rule to decompose it\ninto blocks (e.g., tiles). For the purpose of image, map and level generation, WFC works\nessentially on a grid, although it has been shown to handle graph representations for more\nspecific generation tasks, such as node placement in navigation meshes .\nNonetheless, gridless map generation has yet to be demonstrated. WFC has been gaining\nmomentum among game developers, and was recently analyzed and formalized by Karth and Smith\n, which also look into several of the technique’s uses\nand extensions since its inception. A recent tool, Tessera ,\naddresses several common issues with the original WFC implementation, allowing users to\nexperiment with the technique and several of its extensions within the Unity game engine. The map generation technique proposed in this paper uses some of the ideas present in the\nworks discussed thus far, but follows its own distinct approach. For example, contrary to\nthe work of Butler et al. , the proposed method does not deal with\ngameplay or inter-level balance, focusing instead on the layout of individual maps.\nFurthermore, unlike evolutionary-based designer feedback approaches\n[ref]15  [ref]17 ,\nthe presented PCG technique relies on the designer to carefully model individual map pieces,\nsince one of the goals is to generate multiple quality maps, rather than refining one design.\nLike Sentient Sketchbook [ref]17 and SuSketch ,\nthe snappable meshes technique uses path finding for map evaluation; contrary to these tools,\nhowever, the technique is less bound to specific game genres (at the cost of less detailed maps)\nand offers a fully explainable generation process. Snappable meshes follows a constraint-based\nconstructive approach, similar to Generate Worlds  and WFC\n, but is not bound to a grid, allowing free-form map generation. Indeed,\nit is considerably more flexible than Generate Worlds, as it does not require pixel-perfect\ncolored block interfaces, and is simpler than WFC, which several users found difficult to\ngrasp and refactor . Further, unlike many of the works\ndiscussed here, the proposed technique is not a specific tool designed for certain use cases,\nbut a generic and easy-to-understand procedure which can be integrated in various designer\ntools and workflows.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: Manor and Rogue , and is unarguably the\nmost common use case of PCG in games . Academic interest in this area\nhas been growing, with a number of important developments occurring in the last 15 years [ref]10 .
