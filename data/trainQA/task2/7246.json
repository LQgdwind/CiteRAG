      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring the Reasoning Abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): A Comprehensive Survey on Emerging Trends in Multimodal Reasoning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent studies have explored the potential of using external tools to augment LLMs’ capabilities for complex tasks .\nResearch    has demonstrated that\nsupplementing LLMs with tools, such as calculators, search engines, translation systems, calendars,\nor even API calls to other models can help solve tasks beyond their inherent capabilities. The integration of tools into LLMs generally involves two primary phases: tool selection or creation, and processing the results obtained from these tools   .\nTool selection, a pivotal phase within tool learning, can involve allowing the LLM itself to make decisions based on input queries     [ref]19.\nAlternatively, it might include the use of predefined tools specifically designed for particular scenarios   , such as retrieval systems. When the model is required to autonomously determine which tools to employ, it necessitates the model to understand the characteristics of these tools and make accurate selections via their reasoning abilities.\nThe majority of approaches tend to decompose a complex task into a series of subtasks interacting with tools in sequential or tree structures, such as Chain of Thoughts (CoT) [ref]104 [ref]106, Tree of Thoughts (ToT)  and Program of Thoughts (PoT) . A simple way to teach language models to use tools is by instruction   .\nThe description of tools is able to teach language models to use tools  in a zero-shot fashion.\nLanguage models can also learn to use tools from few-shot examples.\nThis in-context tool learning can range from retrieval tasks to enhancing the model’s ability to generalize to new challenges.\nFor example, Art  demonstrates this by selecting examples of multistep reasoning and tool usage from a task library.\nThis approach significantly improves upon traditional few-shot prompting and automated Chain of Thought (CoT) methods, particularly in unseen tasks within the BigBench and MMLU benchmarks. Some studies have shown that LLMs can learn to utilize tools by fine-tuning on the tool-specific corpora   .\nTALM  and Toolformer  both adopt a self-supervised method, starting with a few tool demonstrations and then enabling the language model to autonomously generate additional data involving tool usage.\nTALM is designed to use APIs for search and calculation, applying these functions to enhance language models’ capabilities in question-answering tasks.\nToolformer, on the other hand, utilizes a broader range of tools, including a calculator, a QA\nsystem, a search engine, a translation system,\nand a calendar, leading to improved zero-shot performance across various downstream tasks. Gorilla  introduces APIBench, a comprehensive dataset comprising APIs from HuggingFace, TorchHub, and TensorHub.\nThe study demonstrates that a fine-tuned LLaMA-based model, trained with this dataset, significantly surpasses GPT-4 in generating API calls, showcasing its enhanced performance. Recent research   has expanded the capabilities of LLMs beyond just utilizing existing tools; it now includes enabling LLMs to create tools through programming.\nThis method uses programming languages to tackle mathematics tasks, thereby enhancing the models’ capacity for accurate mathematical computation and improving logical task planning.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: and processing the results obtained from these tools   .\nTool selection, a pivotal phase within tool learning, can involve allowing the LLM itself to make decisions based on input queries     [ref]19.\nAlternatively, it might include the use of predefined tools specifically designed for particular scenarios   , such as retrieval systems.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
