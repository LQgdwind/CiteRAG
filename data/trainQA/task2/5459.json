      "content": "Paper Title: Transformers in Action Recognition: A Review on Temporal Modeling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMotion + RNN: In [ref]218, a feature selection network (FSN) is proposed with actor-critic reinforcement learning. Given the extracted feature sequence, FSN learns to adaptively select the most representative features and discard the ambiguous features for action recognition. In addition, a generalized graph generation module is proposed to capture latent dependencies and further propose a generalized graph convolution network (GGCN). The GGCN and FSN are combined in a three-stream recognition framework, in which different types of information from skeleton data are fused to improve recognition accuracy. The proposed method in [ref]219 consists of three major steps; feature extraction from a skeleton sequence (as the input of ten neural networks; three LSTM models and seven CNN models), neural networks training, and the late score fusion. Applying various methods to a skeleton sequence can obtain various features prominently in the spatial or temporal domain, and that features are defined as SPF (spatial-domain-feature) and TPF (temporal-domain-feature). SPF is selected as the input of LSTM networks and TPF as the input of CNN networks. To obtain the SPF, three types of spatial domain features are extracted including R (relative position), J (distances between joints), and L (distances between joints and lines). To obtain the TPF, the methods used in [ref]19 and  are followed to generate the joint distances map and joint trajectories map (JTM) respectively.\nConv3D + motion: In , dynamic GCN is proposed in which a convolutional neural network named context-encoding network (CeN) is introduced to learn skeleton topology. In particular, when learning the dependency between two joints, contextual features from the rest joints are incorporated in a global manner. Multiple CeN-enabled graph convolutional layers are stacked to build dynamic GCN. In addition, static physical body connections and motion modalities are combined to improve results. In  , a two-stream model using 3D CNN is proposed for skeleton-based action recognition. In this method, skeleton joints are mapped into a 3D coordinate space and the spatial and temporal information are encoded. Second, 3D CNN models are separately applied to extract deep features from two streams. Third, to enhance the ability of deep features to capture global relationships, every stream is extended into a multitemporal version. In , a data reorganizing strategy is proposed to represent the global and local structure information of human skeleton joints. It employs the data mirror to increase the relationship between skeleton joints. Based on this design, an end-to-end multi-dimensional CNN network is proposed to consider the spatial and temporal information to learn the feature extraction transform function. Particularly, in this CNN network, different convolution kernels are used on different dimensions to learn skeleton representation to generate robust features.\n\nReference markers found: [218]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]218: Motion + RNN: In [ref]218, a feature selection network (FSN) is proposed with actor-critic reinforcement learning.
