Other deep learning-based approaches such as autoencoders that learn\nto encode from the physical to the Koopman invariant subspace, and vice versa in the decoder, are becoming popular [ref]13 [ref]15 [ref]16.\nWhile the Koopman operator can be computed by solving a least squares optimization as in [ref]16,\nit was evaluated from an auxiliary network and eigenvalue treatment in [ref]15.\nThe latter approach‚Äîwhich is extended in this study‚Äîis very promising as highly non-linear functions that are\nnon-periodic can also be studied using the Koopman treatment. As the Deep Learning community develops more novel algorithms to reprsent data, some of these\ncan be used in lieu of autoencoders and alternate Koopman formulations can be reconstructed.\nFor instance, videos that are a sequence of individual frames can be treated using a Koopman approach to build a\nmodel of the dynamics. Even the field of model-based Reinforcement Learning   can use a Koopman-type\nmodel for learning the system dynamics p‚Äã(xt+1|xt,at)ùëùconditionalsubscriptùë•ùë°1subscriptùë•ùë°subscriptùëéùë°p(x_{t+1}|x_{t},a_{t}). Here, the state of the system xtsubscriptùë•ùë°x_{t} can be very high dimensional\nand so one can use a deep learning approach to embed the state to a Koopman invariant sub-space, where the action atsubscriptùëéùë°a_{t} will advance\nthe model dynamics, which can be decoded to the next state xt+1subscriptùë•ùë°1x_{t+1} of the system.\nThe fluid dynamics community can also greatly benefit with the use of deep learning-based Koopman models, as also\nevidenced by many recent publications [ref]15 [ref]16 .\nIt suffices to say that the applications of deep learning-based Koopman models are plentiful.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: operator. Other deep learning-based approaches such as autoencoders that learn\nto encode from the physical to the Koopman invariant subspace, and vice versa in the decoder, are becoming popular [ref]13 [ref]15 [ref]16.\nWhile the Koopman operator can be computed by solving a least squares optimization as in [ref]16,\nit was evaluated from an auxiliary network and eigenvalue treatment in\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
