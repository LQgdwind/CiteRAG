      "content": "Paper Title: Exploring Data Augmentation for Multi-Modality 3D Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n3D object detection.\nMany approaches     have been focusing on processing LiDAR point cloud to improve the performance of 3D object detection.\nTo deal with the irregular and unstructured nature of point cloud, common approaches either apply convolutional neural network (CNN) to the voxelized representation    \nor process raw points    by PointNets  .\nRecent methods    exploit both voxel representation and raw points.\nThere are also attempts   that purely rely on cameras for 3D detection. Previous works aggregate image and point cloud features from different views  ; the efficiency is limited by the view aggregation for a large quantity of anchors  or the proposals .\nMore recent works [ref]24 [ref]25 3 fuse image features into each point, but they exhibit various feature misalignment issues.\nFor example, MVX-Net 3 quantizes image coordinates, while methods [ref]24 [ref]25 based on ContFuse [ref]25 use the nearest points for each BEV feature grid.\nFrustum-based methods   obtain frustum proposals from an image and then apply PointNet  to point cloud for 3D object localization.\nTheir performance is limited by the proposal qualities and they may not fully exploit the complementary information of multi-modalities.\nImVoteNet  skips the above-mentioned issue by fusing 2D votes in images and 3D votes in point clouds. Augmentations for detection.\nData augmentation is crucial to improve the models’ performance.\nHowever, the current single-modality 3D object detection methods    use more aggressive data augmentations than existing multi-modality methods  [ref]24 3 do.\nConventional image augmentations include but are not limited to random cropping, random flipping,\nand multi-scale training  .\nFor point cloud data, common augmentation techniques are random flipping, rotation, translation, and scaling   .\nIn multi-modality 3D detection, the practices of augmentations vary across different methods [ref]25 [ref]24 3.\nFor example, ContFuse [ref]25 skips random flip,\nwhereas MVX-Net 3 does not apply random rotation and translation to maintain consistency between image and point cloud. There are augmentations applied to regions that contain objects of an image  3 .\nA representative method is to cut and paste objects   .\nWhile Dwibedi et al..  paste objects randomly, recent works use a location probability map , semantic and depth information , or a visual context model  to guide the pasting process.\nCutting and pasting the points of objects is also common for LiDAR-based 3D detection methods    but is absent from multi-modality methods  [ref]24 3.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: works aggregate image and point cloud features from different views  ; the efficiency is limited by the view aggregation for a large quantity of anchors  or the proposals .\nMore recent works [ref]24 [ref]25 3 fuse image features into each point, but they exhibit various feature misalignment issues.\nFor example, MVX-Net 3 quantizes image coordinates, while methods [ref]24 [ref]25 based on\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
