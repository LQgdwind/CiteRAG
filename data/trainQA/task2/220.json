Using the notation of Section 1.1, we write Π^0subscript^Π0\\widehat{\\Pi}_{0} (resp. Π^1subscript^Π1\\widehat{\\Pi}_{1}, Σ^1subscript^Σ1\\widehat{\\Sigma}_{1}, Π^2subscript^Π2\\widehat{\\Pi}_{2}) for the finitely-generated groups that are virtually cyclic (resp. abelian, free, a subgroup of a direct product of finitely many finite-rank free groups). We also write {1}^^1\\widehat{\\{1\\}} for the finite groups (i.e., the virtually trivial groups), and ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} for the set of all finitely generated groups G𝐺G that are linear groups over some field of characteristic 00. The following proposition, which collects the results of many authors, demonstrates the extremely strong relationship between the computational complexity of WGsubscript𝑊𝐺W_{G} and certain algebraic properties of G𝐺G. (        ) Let G𝐺G be a finitely generated group with word problem WGsubscript𝑊𝐺W_{G}. The following statements hold. G∈{1}^⇔WG∈𝖱𝖤𝖦.⇔𝐺^1subscript𝑊𝐺𝖱𝖤𝖦G\\in\\widehat{\\{1\\}}\\Leftrightarrow W_{G}\\in\\mathsf{REG}.

Statements (i),(i​i),(i​i​i),(v), and ​(v​i)𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑣 and 𝑣𝑖(i),(ii),(iii),(v),\\text{ and }(vi) were shown, respectively, in ,,, , and . In , it was shown that G𝐺G is free if and only if WG∈𝖢𝖥𝖫subscript𝑊𝐺𝖢𝖥𝖫W_{G}\\in\\mathsf{CFL} and G𝐺G is accessible, in , it was shown that all finitely presented groups are accessible, and in  it was shown that all context-free groups are finitely presented, which implies the first equivalence in (i​v)𝑖𝑣(iv). The second equivalence in (i​v)𝑖𝑣(iv) was shown in .\n∎ It is particularly interesting that, while there are strict inclusions 𝖣𝖢𝖥𝖫⊊𝖢𝖥𝖫𝖣𝖢𝖥𝖫𝖢𝖥𝖫\\mathsf{DCFL}\\subsetneq\\mathsf{CFL}, 𝖣𝖮𝖢𝖫⊊𝖮𝖢𝖫𝖣𝖮𝖢𝖫𝖮𝖢𝖫\\mathsf{DOCL}\\subsetneq\\mathsf{OCL}, and 𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒−𝖣𝖮𝖢𝖫⊊𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒−𝖮𝖢𝖫𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝖣𝖮𝖢𝖫𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝖮𝖢𝖫\\mathsf{poly{-}DOCL}\\subsetneq\\mathsf{poly{-}OCL}, there are no groups whose word problem witnesses any of these separations. That is to say, the deterministic and non-deterministic versions of each of these models can recognize word problems for precisely the same class of groups. Our results have a close correspondence to the above mentioned results. By Theorem 1.2 (resp. Theorem 1.3), ∀G∈Π^1⊋Π^0⊋{1}^for-all𝐺subscript^Π1superset-of-and-not-equalssubscript^Π0superset-of-and-not-equals^1\\forall G\\in\\widehat{\\Pi}_{1}\\supsetneq\\widehat{\\Pi}_{0}\\supsetneq\\widehat{\\{1\\}} (resp. ∀G∈Π^2⊋Π^1∪Σ^1⊋Π^0⊋{1}^for-all𝐺subscript^Π2superset-of-and-not-equalssubscript^Π1subscript^Σ1superset-of-and-not-equalssubscript^Π0superset-of-and-not-equals^1\\forall G\\in\\widehat{\\Pi}_{2}\\supsetneq\\widehat{\\Pi}_{1}\\cup\\widehat{\\Sigma}_{1}\\supsetneq\\widehat{\\Pi}_{0}\\supsetneq\\widehat{\\{1\\}}), WGsubscript𝑊𝐺W_{G} is recognized with one-sided bounded error, in expected polynomial (resp. exponential) time, by a 2QCFA with a single qubit and algebraic number transition amplitudes. Moreover, if allowed a quantum register of any constant size, such a 2QCFA may recognize the word problem of any group G∈𝒬𝐺𝒬G\\in\\mathcal{Q}, where 𝒬𝒬\\mathcal{Q} denotes the class of groups for which Theorem 1.4 applies, with one-sided bounded error in expected exponential time. Of course, as our fundamental approach to solving the group word problem is to construct a DFR for a group G𝐺G, and as any such DFR yields a faithful finite-dimensional unitary representation of G𝐺G, any such G∈ℒ𝐺ℒG\\in\\mathcal{L}. In a companion paper [ref]34, we establish a lower bound on the running time of any 2QCFA (with any size quantum register and no restrictions placed on its transition amplitudes) that recognizes a word problem WGsubscript𝑊𝐺W_{G} with bounded error (even under the more generous notion of two-sided bounded error); more strongly, we establish a lower bound on the running time of any quantum Turing machine that uses sublogarithmic space, though we will not discuss that here. In particular, we show that, ∀G∈𝒬∖Π^1for-all𝐺𝒬subscript^Π1\\forall G\\in\\mathcal{Q}\\setminus\\widehat{\\Pi}_{1}, WGsubscript𝑊𝐺W_{G} cannot be recognized by such a 2QCFA is expected time 2o​(n)superscript2𝑜𝑛2^{o(n)}. Therefore, the algorithm exhibited in this paper for recognizing the word problem of any group G∈𝒬∖Π^1𝐺𝒬subscript^Π1G\\in\\mathcal{Q}\\setminus\\widehat{\\Pi}_{1} has (essentially) optimal expected running time; moreover, we have obtained the first provable separation between the classes of languages recognizable with bounded error by 2QCFA in expected exponential time and in expected subexponential time. In that same paper, we also show that if a 2QCFA of this most general type recognizes a word problem WGsubscript𝑊𝐺W_{G} in expected polynomial time, then G∈𝒢v​N​i​l​p𝐺subscript𝒢𝑣𝑁𝑖𝑙𝑝G\\in\\mathcal{G}_{vNilp}, where 𝒢v​N​i​l​psubscript𝒢𝑣𝑁𝑖𝑙𝑝\\mathcal{G}_{vNilp} denotes the finitely generated virtually nilpotent groups, and Π^1⊊𝒢v​N​i​l​psubscript^Π1subscript𝒢𝑣𝑁𝑖𝑙𝑝\\widehat{\\Pi}_{1}\\subsetneq\\mathcal{G}_{vNilp}. This naturally raises the following question. Is there a group G∈(𝒢v​N​i​l​p∖Π^1)𝐺subscript𝒢𝑣𝑁𝑖𝑙𝑝subscript^Π1G\\in(\\mathcal{G}_{vNilp}\\setminus\\widehat{\\Pi}_{1}) such that WGsubscript𝑊𝐺W_{G} can be recognized by a 2QCFA with bounded error in expected polynomial time? We have shown that the (three-dimensional discrete) Heisenberg group H∈(𝒢v​N​i​l​p∖Π^1)𝐻subscript𝒢𝑣𝑁𝑖𝑙𝑝subscript^Π1H\\in(\\mathcal{G}_{vNilp}\\setminus\\widehat{\\Pi}_{1}) is “complete” for this question, in the sense that if WHsubscript𝑊𝐻W_{H} cannot be recognized with bounded error by a 2QCFA in expected polynomial time, then no such G𝐺G can [ref]34. Let 𝒢v​S​o​l​v​L​i​nsubscript𝒢𝑣𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑣𝐿𝑖𝑛\\mathcal{G}_{vSolvLin} denote the finitely generated virtually solvable linear groups over a field of characteristic zero, and note that 𝒢v​N​i​l​p⊊𝒢v​S​o​l​v​L​i​nsubscript𝒢𝑣𝑁𝑖𝑙𝑝subscript𝒢𝑣𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑣𝐿𝑖𝑛\\mathcal{G}_{vNilp}\\subsetneq\\mathcal{G}_{vSolvLin}. Furthermore, note that WG∈𝖫subscript𝑊𝐺𝖫W_{G}\\in\\mathsf{L}, ∀G∈𝒢v​S​o​l​v​L​i​nfor-all𝐺subscript𝒢𝑣𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑣𝐿𝑖𝑛\\forall G\\in\\mathcal{G}_{vSolvLin} . However, every G∈𝒢v​S​o​l​v​L​i​n∖Π^1𝐺subscript𝒢𝑣𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑣𝐿𝑖𝑛subscript^Π1G\\in\\mathcal{G}_{vSolvLin}\\setminus\\widehat{\\Pi}_{1} does not have a faithful finite-dimensional unitary representation (see, for instance, [41, Proposition 2.2]) and, therefore, does not have a DFR (even an unbounded-error DFR); this prevents the techniques of this paper from producing a 2QCFA that recognizes the corresponding WGsubscript𝑊𝐺W_{G}. Is there a finitely generated group G𝐺G that does not have a faithful finite-dimensional unitary representation (for example, any G∈𝒢v​S​o​l​v​L​i​n∖Π^1𝐺subscript𝒢𝑣𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑣𝐿𝑖𝑛subscript^Π1G\\in\\mathcal{G}_{vSolvLin}\\setminus\\widehat{\\Pi}_{1} or any finitely generated infinite Kazhdan group) such that WGsubscript𝑊𝐺W_{G} can be recognized with bounded error by a 2QCFA at all (i.e., in any time bound)? Consider the group ℤ∗ℤ2∈Σ2⊊Π^3ℤsuperscriptℤ2subscriptΣ2subscript^Π3\\mathbb{Z}*\\mathbb{Z}^{2}\\in\\Sigma_{2}\\subsetneq\\widehat{\\Pi}_{3}, and note that ℤ∗ℤ2∉Π^2ℤsuperscriptℤ2subscript^Π2\\mathbb{Z}*\\mathbb{Z}^{2}\\not\\in\\widehat{\\Pi}_{2}. The complexity of Wℤ∗ℤ2subscript𝑊ℤsuperscriptℤ2W_{\\mathbb{Z}*\\mathbb{Z}^{2}} has been considered by many authors and it is conjectured that Wℤ∗ℤ2∉𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒−𝖢𝖥𝖫subscript𝑊ℤsuperscriptℤ2𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝖢𝖥𝖫W_{\\mathbb{Z}*\\mathbb{Z}^{2}}\\not\\in\\mathsf{poly{-}CFL} (cf. ) and that Wℤ∗ℤ2∉𝖼𝗈𝖢𝖥𝖫subscript𝑊ℤsuperscriptℤ2𝖼𝗈𝖢𝖥𝖫W_{\\mathbb{Z}*\\mathbb{Z}^{2}}\\not\\in\\mathsf{coCFL} . By Theorem 1.5, Wℤ∗ℤ2subscript𝑊ℤsuperscriptℤ2W_{\\mathbb{Z}*\\mathbb{Z}^{2}} is recognizable with one-sided unbounded error by a 2QCFA. We ask the following questions. Can Wℤ∗ℤ2subscript𝑊ℤsuperscriptℤ2W_{\\mathbb{Z}*\\mathbb{Z}^{2}} be recognized by a 2QCFA with bounded error? More generally, is Wℤ∗ℤrsubscript𝑊ℤsuperscriptℤ𝑟W_{\\mathbb{Z}*\\mathbb{Z}^{r}} recognizable by a 2QCFA with bounded error, ∀r∈ℕfor-all𝑟ℕ\\forall r\\in\\mathbb{N}? Does ℤ∗ℤ2ℤsuperscriptℤ2\\mathbb{Z}*\\mathbb{Z}^{2} have an algebraic DFR. More generally, does ℤ∗ℤrℤsuperscriptℤ𝑟\\mathbb{Z}*\\mathbb{Z}^{r} have an algebraic DFR, ∀r∈ℕfor-all𝑟ℕ\\forall r\\in\\mathbb{N}? Even more generally, is the class of groups which have algebraic DFRs closed under free product? Of course, such a DFR would immediately yield a 2QCFA of the desired type for the corresponding word problem. Moreover, recall that Σ2subscriptΣ2\\Sigma_{2} consists of all groups of the form ℤr1∗⋯∗ℤrmsuperscriptℤsubscript𝑟1⋯superscriptℤsubscript𝑟𝑚\\mathbb{Z}^{r_{1}}*\\cdots*\\mathbb{Z}^{r_{m}}, for some m,r1,…,rm∈ℕ𝑚subscript𝑟1…subscript𝑟𝑚ℕm,r_{1},\\ldots,r_{m}\\in\\mathbb{N}, and that any such groups embeds in ℤ∗ℤrℤsuperscriptℤ𝑟\\mathbb{Z}*\\mathbb{Z}^{r}, where r=maxj⁡rj𝑟subscript𝑗subscript𝑟𝑗r=\\max_{j}r_{j}. By Lemma 3.14(i), if ℤ∗ℤrℤsuperscriptℤ𝑟\\mathbb{Z}*\\mathbb{Z}^{r} has a DFR then ℤr1∗⋯∗ℤrmsuperscriptℤsubscript𝑟1⋯superscriptℤsubscript𝑟𝑚\\mathbb{Z}^{r_{1}}*\\cdots*\\mathbb{Z}^{r_{m}} has a DFR with essentially the same parameters. Therefore, if all such ℤ∗ℤrℤsuperscriptℤ𝑟\\mathbb{Z}*\\mathbb{Z}^{r} have DFRs of the desired type, then so do all groups in Σ2subscriptΣ2\\Sigma_{2}, which would then imply all groups in Π^3subscript^Π3\\widehat{\\Pi}_{3} virtually have such a DFR, by an application of Lemma 3.13 and Lemma 3.14(i). We next consider known results concerning those group word problems recognizable by particular QFA variants. Ambainis and Watrous, in the paper in which the 2QCFA model was first defined [ref]2, considered the languages Le​q={am​bm:m∈ℕ}subscript𝐿𝑒𝑞conditional-setsuperscript𝑎𝑚superscript𝑏𝑚𝑚ℕL_{eq}=\\{a^{m}b^{m}:m\\in\\mathbb{N}\\} and Lp​a​l={w∈{a,b}∗:w​ is a palindrome}subscript𝐿𝑝𝑎𝑙conditional-set𝑤superscript𝑎𝑏𝑤 is a palindromeL_{pal}=\\{w\\in\\{a,b\\}^{*}:w\\text{ is a palindrome}\\}. They showed that a 2QCFA, with only two quantum basis states (i.e., a single-qubit quantum register), can recognize Le​qsubscript𝐿𝑒𝑞L_{eq} (resp. Lp​a​lsubscript𝐿𝑝𝑎𝑙L_{pal}) with one-sided bounded error in expected polynomial (resp. exponential) time. As noted in the introduction, while neither Le​qsubscript𝐿𝑒𝑞L_{eq} nor Lp​a​lsubscript𝐿𝑝𝑎𝑙L_{pal} are group word problems, they are closely related to word problems. In particular, Le​q=(a∗​b∗)∩Wℤsubscript𝐿𝑒𝑞superscript𝑎superscript𝑏subscript𝑊ℤL_{eq}=(a^{*}b^{*})\\cap W_{\\mathbb{Z}}. Moreover, for w=w1​⋯​wn∈{a,b}∗𝑤subscript𝑤1⋯subscript𝑤𝑛superscript𝑎𝑏w=w_{1}\\cdots w_{n}\\in\\{a,b\\}^{*}, where each wi∈{a,b}subscript𝑤𝑖𝑎𝑏w_{i}\\in\\{a,b\\}, let w¯=w1−1​⋯​wn−1∈{a−1,b−1}∗¯𝑤superscriptsubscript𝑤11⋯superscriptsubscript𝑤𝑛1superscriptsuperscript𝑎1superscript𝑏1\\overline{w}=w_{1}^{-1}\\cdots w_{n}^{-1}\\in\\{a^{-1},b^{-1}\\}^{*}; then, for any w∈{a,b}∗𝑤superscript𝑎𝑏w\\in\\{a,b\\}^{*}, w∈Lp​a​l⇔w​w¯∈WF2⇔𝑤subscript𝐿𝑝𝑎𝑙𝑤¯𝑤subscript𝑊subscript𝐹2w\\in L_{pal}\\Leftrightarrow w\\overline{w}\\in W_{F_{2}}. This observation allows us to reinterpret the above results of Ambainis and Watrous in terms of group word problems. In addition to results of the above form, which, implicitly, study the quantum computational complexity of the word problem for certain groups, some authors have explicitly considered this question. In the following we write MO-1QFA for the measure-once one-way QFA (defined in ), MM-1QFA for the measure-many one-way QFA (defined in ) and 1QFA↺↺\\circlearrowleft for the one-way QFA with restart (defined in 6). Let 𝖲ℚ=superscriptsubscript𝖲ℚ\\mathsf{S}_{\\mathbb{Q}}^{=} denote the class of languages L𝐿L for which there is a probabilistic finite automaton P𝑃P, all of whose transition amplitudes are rational numbers, such that, ∀w∈Lfor-all𝑤𝐿\\forall w\\in L, the probability that P𝑃P accepts w𝑤w is exactly 1212\\frac{1}{2}, and, ∀w∉Lfor-all𝑤𝐿\\forall w\\not\\in L, the probability that P𝑃P accepts w𝑤w differs from 1212\\frac{1}{2}. The languages WFksubscript𝑊subscript𝐹𝑘W_{F_{k}}, k∈ℕ𝑘ℕk\\in\\mathbb{N} can be recognized, with negative one-sided unbounded error, by a MO-1QFA . Yakaryilmaz and Say 6 showed that any language L∈𝖲ℚ=𝐿superscriptsubscript𝖲ℚL\\in\\mathsf{S}_{\\mathbb{Q}}^{=} can be recognized by a MM-1QFA, with negative one-sided unbounded error, and by a 1QFA↺↺\\circlearrowleft or 2QCFA, with negative one-sided bounded error, in expected exponential time. As Le​q,Lp​a​l∈𝖲ℚ=subscript𝐿𝑒𝑞subscript𝐿𝑝𝑎𝑙superscriptsubscript𝖲ℚL_{eq},L_{pal}\\in\\mathsf{S}_{\\mathbb{Q}}^{=}, this result, partially, subsumes the original result of Ambainis and Watrous [ref]2. However, in addition to the (exponential) difference in expected running time in the case of Le​qsubscript𝐿𝑒𝑞L_{eq}, we also note that there is a significant difference between the sizes of the quantum registers of the machines produced in these two results. In particular, the 1QFA↺↺\\circlearrowleft and 2QCFA constructed by Yakaryilmaz and Say that recognize Lp​a​lsubscript𝐿𝑝𝑎𝑙L_{pal} have 151515 quantum basis states, as opposed to the 222 quantum basis states of the 2QCFA constructed by Ambainis and Watrous. Similarly, as WFk∈𝖲ℚ=subscript𝑊subscript𝐹𝑘superscriptsubscript𝖲ℚW_{F_{k}}\\in\\mathsf{S}_{\\mathbb{Q}}^{=}, ∀k∈ℕfor-all𝑘ℕ\\forall k\\in\\mathbb{N}, the result of Yakaryilmaz and Say shows that the word problems of these groups can be recognized by a 2QCFA of our type; however, a direct application of their construction would yield a 2QCFA with larger quantum part than that of our construction, or that of Ambainis and Watrous. Of course, our results also apply to the 1QFA↺↺\\circlearrowleft model (with exponential expected running time).\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: group word problem is to construct a DFR for a group G𝐺G, and as any such DFR yields a faithful finite-dimensional unitary representation of G𝐺G, any such G∈ℒ𝐺ℒG\\in\\mathcal{L}.
