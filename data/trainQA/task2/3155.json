      "content": "Paper Title: Kraken: An Efficient Engine with a Uniform Dataflow for Deep Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNeural networks are built as directed graphs of layers. While Kraken can accelerate other types of DNNs as well, in this work, we focus on CNNs. CNNs are built such that, as an image flows through a CNN, it is downsampled by integer factors in the spatial dimensions (H,W𝐻𝑊H,W) due to striding and pooling. This ensures the extraction of more global features from local ones as we go deeper into the network. Meanwhile, channels typically increase from 3 at the first layer to 1024 or 2048 near the last layers to extract more complex features. †(K,S)=(1,2)\\dagger(K,S)=(1,2) layers can be processed as (1,1)11(1,1) The number of MAC operations in the jthsuperscript𝑗thj^{\\text{th}} layer can be calculated as where H,W,Co,KH,KW=1𝐻𝑊subscript𝐶𝑜subscript𝐾𝐻subscript𝐾𝑊1H,W,C_{o},K_{H},K_{W}=1 for fully-connected layers. We note that, similar to the analysis by Ahmadi et al. [ref]32, but unlike that of Chen et al.   and Ardakani et al. , we ignore the MAC operations corresponding to the zero paddings (Zj)subscript𝑍𝑗(Z_{j}) when calculating the valid number of MAC operations. While this results in a lower estimate for actual performance, it better reflects the engine’s capability. Furthermore, the exact number of off-chip memory accesses needed to fetch the input (MX,jsubscript𝑀𝑋𝑗M_{X,j}) and kernel (MK,jsubscript𝑀𝐾𝑗M_{K,j}), and store the outputs (MY,jsubscript𝑀𝑌𝑗M_{Y,j}) of the jthsuperscript𝑗thj^{\\text{th}} layer can be calculated as The number of memory accesses per layer and per inference can be calculated as their sums. With AlexNet [ref]41, acing the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) in 2012, the race to build deeper CNNs with higher accuracy began. Today, every few months, in every subfield of machine vision, a novel state-of-the-art CNN architecture is introduced to outperform the last. While any convolutional or fully-connected layer in such models is characterized by the shape parameters outlined above and can hence be accelerated by Kraken, for the purposes of benchmarking and comparison, AlexNet [ref]41, VGG-16 [ref]42 and ResNet50  are chosen in accordance with the prior works   [ref]32.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: layer can be calculated as where H,W,Co,KH,KW=1𝐻𝑊subscript𝐶𝑜subscript𝐾𝐻subscript𝐾𝑊1H,W,C_{o},K_{H},K_{W}=1 for fully-connected layers.
