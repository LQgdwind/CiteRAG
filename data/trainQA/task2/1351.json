      "content": "Paper Title: Learning-Based Quality Assessment for Image Super-Resolution\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe performance evaluation results of the proposed DISQ model are listed in Table V and compared with other IQA methods, where the best and second-best results are shown in  red and  blue, respectively. The compared algorithms include four no-reference IQA methods (DIIVIVE , BRISQUE , HOSA , CNN-IQA ) designed for general distorted images, six no-reference ISA indicators (LPC-SI , MLV , GPC , SPARISH , Synthetic-MaxPol , HVS-MaxPol ), two focus quality assessment algorithms (FQPath [ref]49, FocusLiteNN ), and four related SR-IQA works (NSS-SR , HYQM , LNQM , BSRIQA ).\nThe source codes of these metrics are obtained from the authorsâ€™ public websites. There are two other SR-IQA metrics [ref]16  without publicly available codes and parameters, thus they are not compared in the table. From Table V, we have the following observations: First, FocusLiteNN obtains the highest PLCC on the Waterloo-15 database, and the HOSA achieves the best performance on SRCC and KRCC. In this database, all images were interpolated with integers, which implies that the pixels at LR image will be reused in HR image. An SR-IQA algorithm can utilize this feature to enhance their evaluation performance. However, the proposed DISQ algorithm is designed for general purpose SR without prior knowledge of scaling factors. Nevertheless, its performance is still close to the best. In particular, DISQ ranks the second in terms of SRCC and KRCC. Second, DISQ achieves a good performance on the CVIU-17 database, while other metrics present moderate performances. CVIU-17 was created by several popular image SR algorithms, in which HR images are not limited to the common distortions. Therefore, the features modeled in common IQA methods cannot cover diverse visual contents. Although NSS-SR and NYQM are designed for image SR, they do not work well on this database, because the hand-crafted features of these methods are built more specifically for image interpolation. Third, most non-SR-IQA methods are less effective on the QADS database. DISQ and LNQM, both learning-based, show excellent performance in comparison with other methods. Between them, DISQ utilizes the large-scale database and deep learning to effectively extract intrinsic features, and shows much better performance. The moderate performance of the CNN-based BSRIQA may be attributed to the small training database. Fourth, it can be clearly observed that DISQ outperforms other metrics on the SISAR database. FocusLiteNN achieves excellent performance, and most no-reference ISA algorithms show a good correlation with SISAR database. The reason is that the methods perform better on the local focused images in SISAR database than other metrics. However, their performance drops significantly on the other three databases. Among the SR-IQA methods, although LNQM and BSRIQA obtains better performance than NSS-SR and NYQM, they are not among the best performers. Both of them are trained on CVIU-17, in which the HR images were generated only by integer scaling factors. By contrast, SISAR contains HR images produced by non-integer scaling factors, which benefits the DISQ model that uses SISAR for training. To further investigate model generalization ability, Table VI reports the average performances of all algorithms under comparison on different databases. The performance of the algorithms above the dividing line are the average of four databases, and the rest are average of three, except for the database used for training the corresponding algorithm. As can be observed, the DISQ achieves the best average performance in cross-database experiments, and the PLCC and SRCC values are nearly 10% higher than the second-best model. The results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed DISQ model.\n\nReference markers found: [49]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]49: , CNN-IQA ) designed for general distorted images, six no-reference ISA indicators (LPC-SI , MLV , GPC , SPARISH , Synthetic-MaxPol , HVS-MaxPol ), two focus quality assessment algorithms (FQPath [ref]49, FocusLiteNN ), and four related SR-IQA works (NSS-SR , HYQM , LNQM , BSRIQA ).\nThe source codes of these metrics are obtained from the authorsâ€™ public websites.
