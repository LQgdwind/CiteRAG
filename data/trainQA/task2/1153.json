      "content": "Paper Title: An Adaptive Stable Space-Time FE Method for the Shallow Water Equations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe shallow water equations govern the flow of water in domains in which the\ncharacteristic wavelength horizontally is significantly larger than the depth of water.\nA very important application of the SWE is in the modeling of events such as storm surges resulting\nfrom hurricanes. Thus, the importance of accurate numerical solution techniques should therefore\nbe clear as the repercussions of such events can be vast.\nThe SWE are models for the Navier-Stokes equations in which the direction of the depth has been\nintegrated from the sea floor to the free surface of the water and application of the corresponding boundary conditions.\nThe resulting equations are continuity and momentum equations for the water\nsurface elevation and depth-averaged horizontal velocities, respectively.\nGenerally, the domains if interest in the application of the SWE are irregular and the resulting\ncomputational meshes need to be unstructured, thereby making FE methods well suited for the numerical\napproximation of the SWE, see, e.g.,¬†  for early\nexamples. For flow regimes resulting from hurricanes, the motion of the water, i.e., convection is\nthe driving mechanism of transport.\nThe domination of convective transport over diffusive transport leads to stability issues in classical\nGalerkin FE methods.\nThis issue is well known to be resolved when the element size in the\nFE mesh is adequately refined near the interior or boundary layers induced by this phenomenon.\nHowever, the computational cost and the required mesh generation efforts on a case-by-case basis\nis generally prohibitive. Furthermore, the smallest element size dictates the corresponding\ntime step size further increasing the computational cost.\nLynch and Gray developed the wave continuity equation as a surrogate for the SWE\nin¬† which result in more stable FE approximations as it changes the enforcement of\nthe continuity\nequation by introducing second order time derivatives thereby circumventing the hyperbolic nature\nof the SWE.\nThe wave continuity equation is employed in the advanced circulation model of\nLuettich et. al¬†,\nwhich is widely used and has been developed to encompass a wide range of features important in\nhurricane storm surge modeling. Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods as well as their hybridized\nversions¬†   are popular\nFE methods for the SWE.\nImportant reasons for their popularity include high accuracy, their mass conservation property, ease\nof establishing conditionally\nstable FE discretizations, and local pùëùp-adaptivity¬†[ref]8.\nRecently, high order entropy stable DG methods for curved FE meshes have been introduced for the SWE\nby Wu et al. in¬† which satisfies discrete conservation of entropy. The\nentropy stable method takes advantage of summation-by-parts operators to increase\ncomputational efficiency compared to traditional DG methods demonstrated through numerical\nverifications.\nThe development of hybridized DG (HDG) methods has also reduced the computational\ncost of solving the global system of equations\ncompared to classical DG methods¬†.\nCoupled Galerkin and DG methods have also successfully been\ndeveloped to maximize efficiency and accuracy by Dawson and Proft\nin¬†0 1.\nLeast squares FE methods (LSFEMs)¬†2 have also been successfully applied to the\nSWE by Starke in¬†3 and Liang and Hsu in¬†4. Both these LSFEMs\ntake advantage of the stability property of LSFEMs spatially and the authors present several numerical\nverifications. All the aforementioned FE methods used in shallow water systems for the SWE or its surrogate\nwave continuity equation employ a method of lines approach in the temporal discretization.\nThus, spatial and temporal computations are decoupled, where finite elements are employed in space\nand time stepping schemes such as finite difference methods are employed in time.\nIt is significantly less common to employ space-time FE methods, i.e., using FE discretizations of\nboth space and time. The main reasons are likely the increased computational cost of such methods, as\nwell as the inherently unstable numerical nature of classical FE methods for first order\npartial derivatives.\nHowever, some examples of space-time FE methods for the SWE do exist in\nliterature¬†5 6 7 8, where\nconditional\ndiscrete stability is ensured in space and time by an upwinding argument.\nIn modern multi processor computers and supercomputers, the additional cost of space-time FE methods\ncan be justified as the functional framework of FE leads to readily available\na priori error bounds in addition to a posteriori error estimation\ntechniques. Hence, space-time FE methods can take advantage of adaptive mesh refinement strategies\nto ensure maximum computational efficiency and accuracy. The AVS-FE method¬†9 is an unconditionally stable FE method that falls\ninto the category of discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) methods, introduced by Demkowicz\nand Gopalakrishnan¬†0 1 2 3 4.\nThe unconditional stability of the method is ensured by a particular choice of test functions\nwhich is defined by a Riesz representation problem that realize the supremum in the\ninf-sup condition.\nHence, the AVS-FE method is a Petrov-Galerkin method in which the weak formulation is such that the\ntrial space is a globally continuous Hilbert space, whereas the test space is a broken Hilbert space.\nHence, the test functions are square integrable functions that are of higher order\nregularity on each element, e.g., H1superscriptùêª1H^{1} or H‚Äã(div)ùêªdivH(\\text{div}). The corresponding FE discretization of this\ntest space is achieved by by computing on-the-fly optimal test functions\nin the spirit of the DPG method.\nThis method remains attractive in particular due to its unconditional stability property, regardless\nof the differential operator.\nAdditionally, according to the philosophy of the DPG method, the AVS-FE method establishes an\nequivalent saddle point system which yields both the AVS-FE approximation, as well as\nan ‚Äùerror representation function‚Äù. This function leads to a posteriori error estimates of the\nnumerical approximation error in terms of the energy norm induced by the sesquilinear form. In this paper, we build upon the work of¬†5,\nwhere the AVS-FE method was employed to establish space-time FE approximations for the\nKorteweg-de Vries equation.\nFollowing this introduction, we introduce the model initial boundary value problem (IBVP) as well as\nnotations and conventions in Section¬†2.1.\nIn Section¬†2.2, we present the equivalent AVS-FE weak\nformulation and its analysis for the SWE IBVP as well as the concepts\nof Carstensen et al.¬†6 to establish nonlinear\nAVS-FE approximations.\nA priori error estimates are introduced in Section¬†3.\nIn Section¬†4, we perform multiple numerical verifications for the SWE\npresenting numerical asymptotic convergence properties as well h‚àílimit-from‚Ñéh-adaptive mesh refinements.\nFinally, we conclude with remarks on the results and future works in Section¬†5.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: for the SWE.\nImportant reasons for their popularity include high accuracy, their mass conservation property, ease\nof establishing conditionally\nstable FE discretizations, and local pùëùp-adaptivity¬†[ref]8.\nRecently, high order entropy stable DG methods for curved FE meshes have been introduced for the SWE\nby Wu et al. in¬† which satisfies discrete conservation of entropy.
