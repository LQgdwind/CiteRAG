      "content": "Paper Title: Cognition-Mode Aware Variational Representation Learning Framework for Knowledge Tracing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n∙∙\\bullet DKT : This method is the first to apply deep neural network into the KT field. It utilizes LSTMs to model the evolution of students’ knowledge states with the hidden units.\n∙∙\\bullet DKVMN : This method extends DKT by using a key-value memory network to store and update students’ knowledge states based on a static key matrix and a dynamic value matrix and can mine the relationship between concepts.\n∙∙\\bullet KTM [ref]35: This method is the first to apply the FM [ref]28 into modeling multiple factors related to students’ learning and is a quite generic framework for factor analysis methods.\n∙∙\\bullet SAKT : This method applies the structure of Transformer to model students’ practice sequences to enhance the ability to capture long-term dependencies between practices. \n∙∙\\bullet AKT : This method proposes to update the practice representation with awareness of contexts and introduces the IRT  to acquire question embeddings. \n∙∙\\bullet DIMKT : This method measures students’ subjective feelings of question difficulty and estimates students’ knowledge acquisition while answering questions of different difficulty levels to model the evolution of knowledge states.\n∙∙\\bullet KTM+ [ref]35: KTM can freely incorporate attribute features into predicting students’ responses. In this paper, we define the KTM+ as the KTM-based method with attribute features. \n∙∙\\bullet CL4KT [ref]13: This method introduces a contrastive learning framework that reveals semantically similar or dissimilar examples of a learning history with data augmentation methods. To assess the effectiveness of CMVF, we select multiple classic methods including DKT (the cornerstone of deep KT methods), KTM (a general framework for factor analysis methods), and DIMKT (a state-of-the-art method) as the network backbone for the CMVF framework. \n∙∙\\bullet CMVF+DKT: We select the hidden state of LSTM in DKT, i.e. 𝒉𝒉\\boldsymbol{h}, as the input of the dynamic routing algorithm to extract cognition mode 𝑴𝑴\\boldsymbol{M}. To incorporate student embedding into the DKT, we apply a fully-connected layer for final prediction, i.e. y=σ​(M​L​P​(𝑴⊕𝒆u⊕𝒆q))𝑦𝜎𝑀𝐿𝑃direct-sum𝑴subscript𝒆𝑢subscript𝒆𝑞y=\\sigma(MLP(\\boldsymbol{M}\\oplus\\boldsymbol{e}_{u}\\oplus\\boldsymbol{e}_{q})), where 𝒆usubscript𝒆𝑢\\boldsymbol{e}_{u} and 𝒆qsubscript𝒆𝑞\\boldsymbol{e}_{q} denote the variational embeddings of students and questions. σ​(⋅)𝜎⋅\\sigma(\\cdot) denotes the sigmoid function. \n∙∙\\bullet CMVF+KTM: We exploit wins and fails factors in KTM [ref]35 to extract the cognition modes, and replace the original embeddings of factors with variational embeddings. Moreover, we replace the representations of wins and fails factors in FM with the students’ cognition mode representation. \n∙∙\\bullet CMVF+DIMKT: The output of knowledge state updating in DIMKT is utilized to extract cognition modes 𝑴𝑴\\boldsymbol{M}. As the original DIMKT did not incorporate student representations, we fuse difficulty-enhanced question embedding and student embedding into 𝒙=𝑾T​[𝒆u⊕𝒆q⊕𝒆c⊕𝑸​𝑺⊕𝑲​𝑪]+𝒃𝒙superscript𝑾𝑇delimited-[]direct-sumsubscript𝒆𝑢subscript𝒆𝑞subscript𝒆𝑐𝑸𝑺𝑲𝑪𝒃\\boldsymbol{x}=\\boldsymbol{W}^{T}[\\boldsymbol{e}_{u}\\oplus\\boldsymbol{e}_{q}\\oplus\\boldsymbol{e}_{c}\\oplus\\boldsymbol{QS}\\oplus\\boldsymbol{KC}]+\\boldsymbol{b}, where 𝑸​𝑺𝑸𝑺\\boldsymbol{QS} and 𝑲​𝑪𝑲𝑪\\boldsymbol{KC} denote the difficulty of question and concept, respectively. At last, we make the prediction as y=σ​(𝑴⋅𝒙)𝑦𝜎⋅𝑴𝒙y=\\sigma(\\boldsymbol{M}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{x}).\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: using a key-value memory network to store and update students’ knowledge states based on a static key matrix and a dynamic value matrix and can mine the relationship between concepts.\n∙∙\\bullet KTM [ref]35: This method is the first to apply the FM [ref]28 into modeling multiple factors related to students’ learning and is a quite generic framework for factor analysis methods.\n∙∙\\bullet SAKT :\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
