      "content": "Paper Title: Digital Twin-Aided Learning for Managing Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Assisted, Uplink, User-Centric Cell-Free Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPower control and AUA have been studied in UCCF systems with no RIS.\nBuzzi et al.  proposed two power allocation strategies to maximize the sum-rate and the minimum rate by using alternating optimization and sequential convex programming. The results showed that a UCCF system generally outperforms its cell-free counterpart, especially in the uplink. Alonzo et al.  proposed a low-complexity power allocation strategy to maximize the global EE of UCCF systems.\nNo AUA was considered in  and .\nLiu et al.  jointly optimized AUA, power control, and user-side interference cancellation to maximize the spectral- and energy-efficiency of a downlink UCCF system. A generalized weighted minimum mean square error algorithm was used to optimize the power control. An exhaustive search (ES) was used to optimize the AUA.\nD’Andrea et al.  designed a position-based virtual clustering approach for AUA to maximize the sum-rate.\nNgo et al.  utilized sequential convex approximation to solve downlink power control, and designed two low-complexity AUA algorithms based on the received power and large-scale fading information.\nThese AUA techniques are not applicable in the presence of RISs. While the gain of RISs has been demonstrated in the capacity and EE of cell-free systems 0 [ref]8 , no RIS has been incorporated in UCCF systems; in other words, no AUA has been considered in those studies.\nBashar et al.  designed power control and RIS beamforming to maximize the minimum rate in the downlink of an RIS-assisted cell-free system utilizing geometric programming and semidefinite programming.\nTo maximize a weighted sum-rate of an RIS-assisted, downlink, cell-free system,\nZhang et al. [ref]8 proposed a centralized beamforming scheme to jointly optimize the beamforming at the APs and RISs, and showed that the use of an RIS contributes to the capacity of cell-free systems.\nHuang et al.  designed a decentralized AP and RIS beamforming scheme based on the ADMM, where each AP decides its beamforming locally.\nThe design relieved the computational burden on the edge server, compared to its centralized counterpart developed in [ref]8.\nLe et al. 0 developed a low-complexity alternating descent-based iterative algorithm to maximize the EE of an RIS-assisted, downlink, cell-free system iteratively, and obtained locally optimal analog beamforming at the APs and RISs.\nZhang et al.  designed a hybrid downlink beamforming scheme consisting of digital beamforming at the BSs and analog beamforming at the RIS to maximize EE iteratively.\nUnlike the above studies of downlink systems, Liu et al.  considered an uplink RIS-assisted cell-free system and employed Lagrangian transform and fractional programming to maximize the worst-case EE. DRL has been applied to cell-free or UCCF systems with no RIS    or RIS-assisted conventional cellular systems [ref]31 [ref]32 .\nZhao et al.  used two DRL models, i.e., deep Q-networks (DQN) and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), to learn the power control that maximizes the SE of a cell-free system.\nFredj et al.  developed a distributed DDPG algorithm to design the beamforming at the APs in a cell-free system.\nAl-Eryani et al.  jointly optimized AUA and beamforming at the APs to maximize the sum-rate of a downlink UCCF system. A hybrid DRL framework was designed, where a DQN learned the AUA and DDPG produced the beamforming.\nFeng et al. [ref]31 investigated the RIS beamforming for an RIS-assisted, downlink, cellular system, and applied DRL to tackle the non-convex unit modulus constraints of the RIS phase shifts.\nHuang et al. [ref]32 proposed a joint design of active and passive beamforming in an RIS-assisted cellular system using DRL.\nOnly a single RIS was considered in [ref]31 and [ref]32.\nKim et al.  considered a multi-cell system with the assistance of multiple RISs, and proposed a joint control scheme based on a multi-agent DQN to design the discretized transmit power control, RIS beamforming, and BS combining.\nAll these algorithms require direct interactions with the physical environments to test the learned results. None has considered the potential use of DTs.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: power and large-scale fading information.\nThese AUA techniques are not applicable in the presence of RISs. While the gain of RISs has been demonstrated in the capacity and EE of cell-free systems 0 [ref]8 , no RIS has been incorporated in UCCF systems; in other words, no AUA has been considered in those studies.\nBashar et al.  designed power control and RIS beamforming to maximize the minimum\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
