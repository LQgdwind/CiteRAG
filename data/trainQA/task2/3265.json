      "content": "Paper Title: A Heterogeneous In-Memory Computing Cluster For Flexible End-to-End Inference of Real-World Deep Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTab. I reports the comparison of our scaled-up system with fully digital and mixed-signal state-of-the-art solutions.\nThe solution we propose is superior compared to the others, as it provides full hardware support for a wide range of workloads both in analog and digital domains, enabling de facto efficient end-to-end execution of complex neural network models such as the MobileNetV2. Compared to Vega , which is an architecture based on the same RISC-V cluster without integrating analog IMC cores nor dedicated accelerators for the depth-wise, we show 10×\\times and 2.5×\\times improvements in terms of inference latency and energy, respectively, when considering the end-to-end inference of the MobileNetV2. We compare favorably also with , which consists of a tiny RISC-V core and a charge-based IMC array integrated into the system through a loosely-coupled scheme. In theory, the presence of a programmable core potentially enables the execution of a reasonably sized network such as MobileNetV2. However, the only processing model possible on this architecture is to offload the point-wise layers to the IMC array and the depth-wise and residual layers to the tiny RISC-V processor, which is not capable of performing compute-intensive functions with a reasonable performance level.\nThis would create a major performance bottleneck for the heterogeneous workload. For these reasons, our solution shows at least two orders of magnitude improvement on the end-to-end execution of the DNN. Despite the higher area of our system that might represent a drawback, it is worth noticing that the charge-based IMA integrated into  requires extending the architecture with a Flash memory to store the weights of the DNN (with non-negligible area costs). In our architecture, weights can be stored directly on the non-volatile IMAs, without having to consider an external Flash. The system presented in  consists of a PCM-based IMC array extended with digital logic that performs only activation and pooling operations, while a small SRAM memory acts as a layer-to-layer intermediate buffer. The higher peak performance and efficiency on MVMs they show compared to us is due to the bigger array size they used (1024×\\times512 compared to 256×\\times256), being the in-memory macro based on the same prototype [ref]27, while a loss as little as 10% of the peak is attributable to the integration of the IMA into a complex system like the one we propose, as we show in Sec. V-C. However, the architecture in  is too limited to execute the end-to-end inference of the MobileNetV2 for two main reasons: first, a single IMC array can not host all the layers weights of the MobileNet; second, there are no programmable cores to handle residual connections and control operations. Despite a more complex data-path compared to , including a cluster of 4×\\times4 computing in memory units and a network-on-chip for communication which delivers outstanding performance and efficiency on MVMs, also the architecture shown in [ref]31 is not viable to map heterogeneous workloads such as the MobileNetV2, due to the absence of a programmable processor. Finally, to better highlight the contribution of this work, we abstract the specific System-on-Chip implementations described in Tab. I to four categories representative of the state-of-the-art, as shown in Fig. 13. We can highlight four different processing models: i) analog cores extended with fixed-function digital logic  [ref]31 (ima+ dig. acc.), ii) analog cores controlled by simple MCU-subsystems  (ima+ mcu), iii) IMAs integrated into tightly-coupled clusters of programmable processors [ref]8 (sw+ ima), and iv) the paradigm proposed in this work, where we exploit heterogeneity both in terms of analog and digital computing and in terms of programmable cores and lightweight tightly coupled digital acceleration (sw+ima+ dig. acc.). Fig. 13 shows the results of the exploration, highlighting that for the MobileNetV2 workload, the computational model proposed in this work delivers significantly better performance compared to all the models exploiting programmable processor to sustain flexibility bottlenecks of IMC arrays. On the other hand, architectures only mixing specialized digital hardware with AIMC can only deal with DNN models for which they are designed, not being able to adapt to different models for which they were not intended before fabrication. We argue that this concept, only demonstrated for MobileNetV2 DNN in Fig. 13 can be easily extended to more complex computer vision pipelines in the embedded domain, where AI workloads are often coupled to more traditional linear algebra algorithms such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Fast Fourier Transform, Filtering Functions or Inverse Kinematics . We believe that the approach proposed in this work is a viable way to tackle the performance and flexibility requirements of rapidly evolving modern computer vision pipelines.\n\nReference markers found: [27]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]27: and efficiency on MVMs they show compared to us is due to the bigger array size they used (1024×\\times512 compared to 256×\\times256), being the in-memory macro based on the same prototype [ref]27, while a loss as little as 10% of the peak is attributable to the integration of the IMA into a complex system like the one we propose, as we show in Sec. V-C.
