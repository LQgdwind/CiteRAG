      "content": "Paper Title: Meta-Learning Adversarial Bandit Algorithms\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur last application is bandit linear optimization, in which at task t𝑡t round i𝑖i we play 𝐱t,i∈𝒦subscript𝐱𝑡𝑖𝒦\\mathbf{x}_{t,i}\\in\\mathcal{K} in some convex 𝒦⊂ℝd𝒦superscriptℝ𝑑\\mathcal{K}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{d} and observe loss ⟨ℓt,i,𝐱t,i⟩∈[−1,1]subscriptℓ𝑡𝑖subscript𝐱𝑡𝑖11\\langle\\ell_{t,i},\\mathbf{x}_{t,i}\\rangle\\in[-1,1].\nWe will again use a variant of mirror descent, using a self-concordant barrier for ψ𝜓\\psi and the specialized loss estimators of Abernethy et al. [2, Alg. 1].\nMore information on such regularizers can be found in the literature on interior point methods .\nWe pick this class of algorithms because of their optimal dependence on the number of rounds and their applicability to any convex domain 𝒦𝒦\\mathcal{K} via specific barriers ψ𝜓\\psi, which will yield interesting notions of task-similarity.\nOur ability to handle non-smooth regularizers via the structural result (Thm. 2.1) is even more important here, as barriers are infinite at the boundaries.\nIndeed, we will not learn a β𝛽\\beta parameterizing the regularizer and instead focus on tuning a boundary offset ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0.\nHere we make use of notation from Section 2, where 𝐜εsubscript𝐜𝜀\\mathbf{c}_{\\varepsilon} maps points in 𝒦𝒦\\mathcal{K} to a subset 𝒦εsubscript𝒦𝜀\\mathcal{K}_{\\varepsilon} defined by the Minkowski function (c.f. Def. E.1) centered at 𝐱1=arg​min𝐱∈𝒦⁡ψ​(𝐱)subscript𝐱1subscriptargmin𝐱𝒦𝜓𝐱\\mathbf{x}_{1}=\\operatorname*{arg\\,min}_{\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathcal{K}}\\psi(\\mathbf{x}). From Abernethy et al. [ref]2 we have an upper bound on the expected task-averaged regret of their algorithm run from initializations 𝐱t,1∈𝒦∘subscript𝐱𝑡1superscript𝒦\\mathbf{x}_{t,1}\\in\\mathcal{K}^{\\circ} with step-sizes ηt>0subscript𝜂𝑡0\\eta_{t}>0 and offsets εt>0subscript𝜀𝑡0\\varepsilon_{t}>0: We can show (88) that Dε2=max𝐱,𝐲∈𝒦εB(𝐱||𝐲)≤9​ν32​K​S1εD_{\\varepsilon}^{2}=\\max_{\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathcal{K}_{\\varepsilon}}B(\\mathbf{x}||\\mathbf{y})\\leq\\frac{9\\nu^{\\frac{3}{2}}K\\sqrt{S_{1}}}{\\varepsilon}, where ν𝜈\\nu is the self-concordance constant of ψ𝜓\\psi and S1=‖∇2ψ​(𝐱1)‖2subscript𝑆1subscriptnormsuperscript∇2𝜓subscript𝐱12S_{1}=\\|\\nabla^{2}\\psi(\\mathbf{x}_{1})\\|_{2} is the spectral norm of its Hessian at the center 𝐱1subscript𝐱1\\mathbf{x}_{1} of 𝒦𝒦\\mathcal{K}.\nRestricting to tuning ε∈[1m,1]𝜀1𝑚1\\varepsilon\\in[\\frac{1}{m},1]—which is enough to obtain constant task-averaged regret above if the estimated optima 𝐱^tsubscript^𝐱𝑡\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}_{t} are identical—we can now apply Algorithm 1 via the following instantiation: Note the similarity to the MAB case (8), with the difference being the upper bound passed to EWOO and MW.\nOur structural result bounds the expected task-averaged regret as follows (c.f. Thm. E.1): \\SavedStyle \\SavedStyle \\SavedStyle \\SavedStyle For ρ=oT​(1)𝜌subscript𝑜𝑇1\\rho=o_{T}(1) and k=ωT​(1)𝑘subscript𝜔𝑇1k=\\omega_{T}(1) this becomes oT​(poly​(m))+𝔼​minε∈[1m,1],η>0⁡V^ε2η+32​η​d2​m+ε​msubscript𝑜𝑇poly𝑚𝔼subscriptformulae-sequence𝜀1𝑚1𝜂0superscriptsubscript^𝑉𝜀2𝜂32𝜂superscript𝑑2𝑚𝜀𝑚o_{T}(\\textrm{poly}(m))+\\mathbb{E}\\min_{\\varepsilon\\in[\\frac{1}{m},1],\\eta>0}\\frac{\\hat{V}_{\\varepsilon}^{2}}{\\eta}+32\\eta d^{2}m+\\varepsilon m, where V^ε2=1T∑t=1Tψ(𝐜ε(𝐱^t)−ψ(𝐜ε(𝐱¯^t)\\hat{V}_{\\varepsilon}^{2}=\\frac{1}{T}\\sum_{t=1}^{T}\\psi(\\mathbf{c}_{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}_{t})-\\psi(\\mathbf{c}_{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{\\hat{\\bar{x}}}_{t}).\nThen by tuning η𝜂\\eta we get an asymptotic (T→∞→𝑇T\\to\\infty) regret of 4​d​V^ε​2​m+ε​m4𝑑subscript^𝑉𝜀2𝑚𝜀𝑚4d\\hat{V}_{\\varepsilon}\\sqrt{2m}+\\varepsilon m for any ε∈[1m,1]𝜀1𝑚1\\varepsilon\\in[\\frac{1}{m},1].\nOur analysis removes the explicit dependence on ν𝜈\\sqrt{\\nu} that appears in the single-task regret [ref]2;\nas an example, ν𝜈\\nu equals the number of inequalities defining a polytope 𝒦𝒦\\mathcal{K}, as in the bandit shortest-path application below. The remaining challenge is to interpret V^ε2superscriptsubscript^𝑉𝜀2\\hat{V}_{\\varepsilon}^{2}, which as we did for MAB we do via specific examples, in this case concrete action domains 𝒦𝒦\\mathcal{K}.\nOur first example is for BLO over the unit sphere 𝒦={𝐱∈ℝd:‖𝐱‖2≤1}𝒦conditional-set𝐱superscriptℝ𝑑subscriptnorm𝐱21\\mathcal{K}=\\{\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d}:\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_{2}\\leq 1\\} using the appropriate log-barrier regularizer ψ​(𝐱)=−log⁡(1−‖𝐱‖22)𝜓𝐱1superscriptsubscriptnorm𝐱22\\psi(\\mathbf{x})=-\\log(1-\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_{2}^{2}): For BLO on the sphere,\nAlgorithm 1 has expected task-averaged regret The bound above is decreasing in 𝔼​‖𝐱¯^‖22𝔼superscriptsubscriptnorm^¯𝐱22\\mathbb{E}\\|\\mathbf{\\hat{\\bar{x}}}\\|_{2}^{2}, the expected squared norm of the average of the estimated optima 𝐱^tsubscript^𝐱𝑡\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}_{t}.\nWe thus say that\nbandit linear optimization tasks over the sphere are similar if the norm of the empirical mean of their (estimated) optima is large.\nThis makes intuitive sense:\nif the tasks’ optima are uniformly distributed, we should expect 𝔼​‖𝐱¯^‖22𝔼superscriptsubscriptnorm^¯𝐱22\\mathbb{E}\\|\\mathbf{\\hat{\\bar{x}}}\\|_{2}^{2} to be small, even decreasing in d𝑑d.\nOn the other hand, in the degenerate case where the estimated optima 𝐱^tsubscript^𝐱𝑡\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}_{t} are the same across all tasks t∈[T]𝑡delimited-[]𝑇t\\in[T], we have 𝔼​‖𝐱¯^‖22=1𝔼superscriptsubscriptnorm^¯𝐱221\\mathbb{E}\\|\\mathbf{\\hat{\\bar{x}}}\\|_{2}^{2}=1, so the asymptotic task-averaged regret is 1 because we can use ε=1m𝜀1𝑚\\varepsilon=\\frac{1}{m}.\nPerhaps slightly more realistically, if it is 1mp1superscript𝑚𝑝\\frac{1}{m^{p}}-away from 1 for some power p≥12𝑝12p\\geq\\frac{1}{2} then setting ε=1m𝜀1𝑚\\varepsilon=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}} can remove the logarithmic dependence on m𝑚m.\nThese two regimes illustrate the importance of tuning ε𝜀\\varepsilon. As a last application, we apply our meta-BLO result to the shortest-path problem in online optimization  .\nIn its bandit variant  , at each step i=1,…,m𝑖1…𝑚i=1,\\dots,m the player must choose a path pisubscript𝑝𝑖p_{i} from a fixed source u∈V𝑢𝑉u\\in V to a fixed sink v∈V𝑣𝑉v\\in V in a directed graph G​(V,E)𝐺𝑉𝐸G(V,E).\nAt the same time the adversary chooses edge-weights ℓi∈ℝ|E|subscriptℓ𝑖superscriptℝ𝐸\\ell_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{|E|} and the player suffers the sum ∑e∈ptℓi​(e)subscript𝑒subscript𝑝𝑡subscriptℓ𝑖𝑒\\sum_{e\\in p_{t}}\\ell_{i}(e) of the weights in their chosen path ptsubscript𝑝𝑡p_{t}.\nThis can be relaxed as BLO over vectors 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} in a set 𝒦⊂ |E|𝒦superscript01𝐸\\mathcal{K}\\subset ^{|E|} defined by a set 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} of 𝒪​(|E|)𝒪𝐸\\mathcal{O}(|E|) linear constraints (𝐚,b)𝐚𝑏(\\mathbf{a},b) ⟨𝐚,𝐱⟩≤b𝐚𝐱𝑏\\langle\\mathbf{a},\\mathbf{x}\\rangle\\leq b enforcing flows from u𝑢u to v𝑣v;\nu𝑢u to v𝑣v paths can be sampled from any 𝐱∈𝒦𝐱𝒦\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathcal{K} in an unbiased manner [2, Proposition 1].\nOn a single-instance, applying the BLO method of Abernethy et al. [ref]2 ensures 𝒪​(|E|32​m)𝒪superscript𝐸32𝑚\\mathcal{O}(|E|^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\sqrt{m}) regret on this problem. In the multi-instance setting, comprising a sequence t=1,…,T𝑡1…𝑇t=1,\\dots,T of shortest path instances with m𝑚m adversarial edge-weight vectors ℓt,isubscriptℓ𝑡𝑖\\ell_{t,i} each, we can attempt to achieve better performance by tuning the same method across instances.\nNotably, we can view this as the problem of learning predictions  in the algorithms with predictions paradigm from beyond-worst-case analysis [ref]40, with the OMD initialization on each instance being effectively a prediction of its optimal path.\nOur meta-learner then has the following average performance across bandit shortest-path instances: For multi-task bandit online shortest path, Algorithm 1 with regularizer ψ​(𝐱)=−∑𝐚,b∈𝒞log⁡(b−⟨𝐚,𝐱⟩)𝜓𝐱subscript𝐚𝑏𝒞𝑏𝐚𝐱\\psi(\\mathbf{x})=-\\sum_{\\mathbf{a},b\\in\\mathcal{C}}\\log(b-\\langle\\mathbf{a},\\mathbf{x}\\rangle) attains the following expected average regret across instances \\SavedStyle \\SavedStyle \\SavedStyle \\SavedStyle Here the asymptotic regret scales with the sum across all constraints 𝐚,b∈𝒞𝐚𝑏𝒞\\mathbf{a},b\\in\\mathcal{C} of the log of the ratio between the arithmetic and geometric means across tasks of the distances b−⟨𝐚,𝐜ε​(𝐱^t)⟩𝑏𝐚subscript𝐜𝜀subscript^𝐱𝑡b-\\langle\\mathbf{a},\\mathbf{c}_{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}_{t})\\rangle from the estimated optimum flow 𝐜ε​(𝐱^t)subscript𝐜𝜀subscript^𝐱𝑡\\mathbf{c}_{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}_{t}) to the constraint boundary.\nAs it is difficult to separate the effect of the offset ε𝜀\\varepsilon, we do not state an explicit task-similarity measure like in our previous settings.\nNevertheless, since the arithmetic and geometric means are equal exactly when all entries are equal—and otherwise the former is larger—the bound does show that regret is small when the estimated optimal flows 𝐱^tsubscript^𝐱𝑡\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}_{t} for each task are at similar distances from the constraints, i.e. the boundaries of the polytope.\nIndeed, just as on the sphere, if the estimated optima are all the same then setting ε=1m𝜀1𝑚\\varepsilon=\\frac{1}{m} again yields constant averaged regret.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: function (c.f.
