      "content": "Paper Title: ASIF: Coupled Data Turns Unimodal Models to Multimodal without Training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nClassics. In , Stanley Ulam affirms that a mathematical formalization of the word “as”–on a par with the connectives “and”, “or”, “implies” and “not”–would be a key milestone to artificial intelligence. This idea of analogies being at the core of cognition is shared by Hofstadter 7, who states that a concept is a collection of analogies, in line with what the ASIF procedure prescribes. Retrieval augmented foundation models.\nRecent works in NLP enhance unimodal language models with retrieval to reduce the size of the architectures and the training dataset while also making results more transparent  . Our work is in line with this view, that the ASIF procedure extends to the multimodal case. Importantly, ASIF offers a new perspective on data centric AI , where data and the external memory implement the alignment between modalities. Networks with discrete Key-Value bottlenecks [ref]30 are closely related to our approach, with the critical differences that our memory is not learned and that their decoder is trained for classification.\nRetrieval and memory-augmented models have also been successful in Reinforcement Learning [ref]31, physical reasoning , and code generation .\nFinally, we notice that making predictions on new samples by exploiting the similarity with a dictionary of previous data points is a common approach in computer vision  for few-shot learning. Our procedure is also related to compressed sensing algorithms where a signal (in our case an image) is sensed as a sparse combination of fixed atoms   with an iterative projection procedure   and only transmitting the coefficients to the receiver (text modality). Learning multimodal models.  Following the intuition outlined by early works on aligning text and image embeddings  ,\ntoday large multimodal models are conquering the computer vision scene thanks to their wide applicability and easy transfer to new downstream tasks   5 .\n\nWe identify two key leaps respect to traditional models like ResNet : (i) Free text allows to learn visual concepts beyond a finite set of predefined categories and to exploit the structure of language to compose them, as masterfully seen in Dall-E . (ii) The recognition tag transitioned from being an output pulled out of the image by the neural stack (the label) to become an input that should be interpreted, and therefore processed by its own encoder (the free text caption).\nThis corresponds to an epistemological perspective shift, as discussed by Norelli et al. .\nData and learning efficiency are clear challenges for large multimodal models, that often require hundreds of millions of examples. Efforts such as   attempt to reduce this. ASIF presents a different take on this problem, showing how much can be achieved by simply remembering the training data efficiently.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: case. Importantly, ASIF offers a new perspective on data centric AI , where data and the external memory implement the alignment between modalities. Networks with discrete Key-Value bottlenecks [ref]30 are closely related to our approach, with the critical differences that our memory is not learned and that their decoder is trained for classification.\nRetrieval and memory-augmented models\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
