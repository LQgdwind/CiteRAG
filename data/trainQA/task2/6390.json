      "content": "Paper Title: Memory-Constrained Algorithms for Convex Optimization via Recursive Cutting-Planes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOptimization algorithms are ubiquitous in machine learning, from solving simple regressions to training neural networks. Their essential roles have motivated numerous studies on their efficiencies, which are usually analyzed through the lens of oracle-complexity: given an oracle (such as function value, or subgradient oracle), how many calls to the oracle are needed for an algorithm to output an approximate optimal solution? . However, ever-growing problem sizes have shown an inadequacy in considering only the oracle-complexity, and have motivated the study of the trade-off between oracle-complexity and other resources such as memory   [ref]5 and communication       . In this work, we study the oracle-complexity/memory trade-off for first-order non-smooth convex optimization, and the closely related feasibility problem, with a focus on developing memory efficient (deterministic) algorithms. Since  formally posed as open problem the question of characterizing this trade-off, there have been exciting results showing what is impossible: for convex optimization in ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\mathbb{R}^{d},  shows that any randomized algorithm with d1.25−δsuperscript𝑑1.25𝛿d^{1.25-\\delta} bits of memory needs at least Ω~​(d1+4​δ/3)~Ωsuperscript𝑑14𝛿3\\tilde{\\Omega}(d^{1+4\\delta/3}) queries, and this has later been improved for deterministic algorithms to d1−δsuperscript𝑑1𝛿d^{1-\\delta} bits of memory or Ω~​(d1+δ/3)~Ωsuperscript𝑑1𝛿3\\tilde{\\Omega}(d^{1+\\delta/3}) queries by [ref]5; in addition [ref]5 shows that for the feasibility problem with a separation oracle, any algorithm which uses d2−δsuperscript𝑑2𝛿d^{2-\\delta} bits of memory needs at least Ω~​(d1+δ)~Ωsuperscript𝑑1𝛿\\tilde{\\Omega}(d^{1+\\delta}) queries. Despite these recent results on the lower bounds, all known first-order convex optimization algorithms that output an ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon-suboptimal point fall into two categories: those that are quadratic in memory but can potentially achieve the optimal 𝒪​(d​ln⁡1ϵ)𝒪𝑑1italic-ϵ\\mathcal{O}(d\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}) query complexity, as represented by the center-of-mass method, and those that have 𝒪​(1ϵ2)𝒪1superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^{2}}) query complexity but only need the optimal 𝒪​(d​ln⁡1ϵ)𝒪𝑑1italic-ϵ\\mathcal{O}(d\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}) bits of memory, as represented by the classical gradient descent . In addition, the above-mentioned memory bounds apply only between queries, and in particular the center-of-mass method  is allowed to use infinite memory during computations. We propose a family of memory-constrained algorithms for the stronger feasibility problem in which one aims to find a point within a set Q𝑄Q containing a ball of radius ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon, with access to a separation oracle. In particular, this can be used for convex optimization since the subgradient information provides a separation vector. Our algorithms use 𝒪​(d2p​ln⁡1ϵ)𝒪superscript𝑑2𝑝1italic-ϵ\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{d^{2}}{p}\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}) bits of memory (including during computations) and 𝒪​((C​dp​ln⁡1ϵ)p)𝒪superscript𝐶𝑑𝑝1italic-ϵ𝑝\\mathcal{O}((C\\frac{d}{p}\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})^{p}) queries for some universal constant C≥1𝐶1C\\geq 1, and a parameter p∈[d]𝑝delimited-[]𝑑p\\in[d] that can be chosen by the user. Intuitively, in the context of convex optimization, the algorithms are based on the idea that for any function f​(𝒙,𝒚)𝑓𝒙𝒚f(\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{y}) convex in the pair (𝒙,𝒚)𝒙𝒚(\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{y}), the partial minimum min𝒚⁡f​(𝒙,𝒚)subscript𝒚𝑓𝒙𝒚\\min_{\\boldsymbol{y}}f(\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{y}) as a function of 𝒙𝒙\\boldsymbol{x} is still convex and, using a variant of Vaidya’s method proposed in , our algorithm can approximate subgradients for that function min𝒚⁡f​(𝒙,𝒚)subscript𝒚𝑓𝒙𝒚\\min_{\\boldsymbol{y}}f(\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{y}), thereby turning an optimization problem with variables (𝒙,𝒚)𝒙𝒚(\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{y}) to one with just 𝒙𝒙\\boldsymbol{x}. This idea, applied recursively with the variables divided into p𝑝p blocks, gives our family of algorithms and the above-mentioned memory and query complexity. When p=1𝑝1p=1, our algorithm is a memory-constrained version of Vaidya’s method  , and improves over the center-of-mass  method by a factor of ln⁡1ϵ1italic-ϵ\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} in terms of memory while having optimal oracle-complexity. The improvements provided by our algorithms are more significant in regimes when ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon is very small in the dimension d𝑑d: increasing the parameter p𝑝p can further reduce the memory usage of Vaidya’s method (p=1𝑝1p=1) by a factor ln⁡1ϵ/ln⁡d1italic-ϵ𝑑\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}/\\ln d, while still improving over the oracle-complexity of gradient descent. In particular, in a regime ln⁡1ϵ=poly​(ln⁡d)1italic-ϵpoly𝑑\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}=\\text{poly}(\\ln d), these memory improvements are only in terms of ln⁡d𝑑\\ln d factors. However, in sub-polynomial regimes with potentially ln⁡1ϵ=dc1italic-ϵsuperscript𝑑𝑐\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}=d^{c} for some constant c>0𝑐0c>0, these provide polynomial improvements to the memory of standard cutting-plane methods. As a summary, this paper makes the following contributions. Our class of algorithms provides a trade-off between memory-usage and oracle-complexity whenever ln⁡1ϵ≫ln⁡dmuch-greater-than1italic-ϵ𝑑\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\gg\\ln d. Further, taking p=1𝑝1p=1 improves the memory-usage from center-of-mass  by a factor ln⁡1ϵ1italic-ϵ\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}, while preserving the optimal oracle-complexity. For ln⁡1ϵ≥Ω​(d​ln⁡d)1italic-ϵΩ𝑑𝑑\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\geq\\Omega(d\\ln d), our algorithm with p=d𝑝𝑑p=d is the first known algorithm that outperforms gradient descent in terms of the oracle-complexity, but still maintains the optimal 𝒪​(d​ln⁡1ϵ)𝒪𝑑1italic-ϵ\\mathcal{O}(d\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}) memory usage. We show how to obtain a ln⁡1ϵ1italic-ϵ\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} dependence in the known lower-bound trade-offs  [ref]5, confirming that the oracle-complexity/memory trade-off is necessary for any regime ϵ≲1dless-than-or-similar-toitalic-ϵ1𝑑\\epsilon\\lesssim\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: problem sizes have shown an inadequacy in considering only the oracle-complexity, and have motivated the study of the trade-off between oracle-complexity and other resources such as memory   [ref]5 and communication       .
