      "content": "Paper Title: VeriDIP: Verifying Ownership of Deep Neural Networks through Privacy Leakage Fingerprints\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning plays an important role in various tasks such as image recognition  [ref]2 , natural language processing , and speech recognition  tasks. Building a sophisticated deep neural network (DNN) requires a significant amount of annotated training data, which often contains user privacy, demands powerful computing resources, and necessitates machine learning expertise. These unique DNN models represent valuable intellectual property (IP) and require copyright protection. However, deploying DNN models’ APIs for user queries introduces the risk of model extraction attacks, leading to copyright infringement   . Model extraction attack efficiently transfers the functionality of a victim model to a stolen copy using limited query answers. Additionally, attackers, who may be insiders with full access to the victim models, employ techniques such as distillation [ref]9, fine-tuning 0, or pruning 1 2 in an attempt to reverse-engineer the tracking. Proof-of-ownership serves as an adequate protection mechanism against model stealing attacks, ensuring accountability for any theft of copyright-protected models. However, proving ownership of a neural network poses challenges due to the stochastic nature of the training and stealing process 3. Many stealing mechanisms have minimal side effects on the model’s functionality but disable the proof-of-ownership mechanism 4 [ref]9 5. Methods for proving ownership of DNN models can be broadly classified into two categories: watermark embedding (WE) 6 7 8 9    and ownership testing (OT)   5  . The WE methods embed customized watermarks into DNN models during the training stage then verify the ownership by confirming the presence of the respective watermarks from given suspect models. However, WE techniques have certain limitations, including tampering with the training process, potential side effects on model functionality, and vulnerability to watermark erasure attacks [ref]9  0. In contrast, the OT methods extract the intrinsic characteristics (fingerprints) of DNN models, making them non-invasive and more resilient to adaptive attacks  5. In this paper, our focus is on the OT technique to verify the copyright of DNN models. To the best of our knowledge, existing ownership testing solutions rely on two types of DNN fingerprints\n— model robustness and model overfitting, which capture the uniqueness of DNN models.\nRobustness-based solutions utilize adversarial examples to delineate the decision boundary of\nboth the victim model and its stolen copies, and then compare the percentage of matched answers   5.\nHowever, techniques that enhance a DNN model’s robustness against adversarial attacks, such as adversarial training , undermine the performance of ownership testing.\nOn the other side, overfitting-based OT solutions, such as dataset inference , leverage the observation that the stolen copies exhibit a higher level of overfitting to the training set of the victim models, thereby extracting the overfitting level as fingerprints.\nWhile these approaches are innovative and effective, they have certain limitations. The verification process is communicational and computationally expensive requiring thousands of queries to the stolen copy to obtain dozens of minimal adversarial noise as fingerprints \nContinuous inquiries may raise suspicions of model theft and result in rejection of the inquiries .\nFurthermore, the performance of overfitting-based solutions is negatively affected by the model’s generalization ability. To address these problems, we propose a novel ownership testing approach to Verify a DNN model’s Intelligence Property (VeriDIP). The key feature of VeriDIP is its utilization of privacy leakage fingerprints, instead of relying on overfitting  or robustness   5 metrics to indicate model uniqueness. Drawing on the concept of membership inference (MI) attacks from previous works  0 1, the privacy leakage of a model against MI attacks reflects the extent to which the model has memorized its private or secret training data. Hence, considering the secrecy of the training data, a stolen model would not exhibit the same level of privacy leakage on the victim’s private training data as the victim model under the same MI attacks. In other words, the privacy leakage fingerprint of a model captures the distinctive and confidential patterns learned by the model, fulfilling the criteria of a reliable fingerprint: uniqueness and irremovability. As a result,\nany unauthorized DNN models that result in a certain degree of privacy leakage of a private training set can be identified as plagiarized. Using privacy leakage fingerprints, VeriDIP consists of four components for verifying a DNN model’s intelligence property. First, motivated by the aforementioned properties of the privacy leakage of a given model, we utilize MI attacks to estimate the lower bound of privacy leakage, which serves as the extracted fingerprint of a given model. Then we employ hypothesis testing on the extracted fingerprint to determine the likelihood of a suspect model being a stolen copy of the victim model. However, we may encounter the issue of “fingerprint fading” when dealing with well-generalized models that exhibit minimal privacy leakage against MI attacks. To tackle this problem,\nwe introduce an enhanced version of VeriDIP where MI attacks query the suspect models using less private samples to extract the worst-case privacy leakage fingerprints of the suspect models. These less private samples face higher privacy leaking risks against MI attacks, enabling the enhanced VeriDIP to extract stronger privacy leakage fingerprints.\nTo identify the less private data in advance, we train numerous shadow models to investigate the impact of each training sample on the decision boundary of DNN models. The data that significantly influences the models will be considered as the less private data. We extensively evaluate VeriDIP on two image datasets (FMNIST and CIFAR-10) and two tabular datasets (Adult and Health) against three types of model stealing attacks: model extraction attack, model distillation attack, and fine-tune attack. The evaluation results for FMNIST and CIFAR demonstrate that VeriDIP can publicly authenticate all stolen copies while exposing less than 5 training samples, with a significantly reduced number of queries to the suspect models compared to . Despite the models trained on tabular datasets having minimal overfitting, VeriDIP is still capable of publicly authenticating all stolen copies, at the cost of exposing dozens of training samples, whereas previous works    5 are unable to do so. In this work, we also address an open question raised in  regarding the effectiveness of VeriDIP on differentially private DNN models. We demonstrate that VeriDIP’s success rate is constrained by a stringent privacy budget, such as ε=0.1𝜀0.1\\varepsilon=0.1. However, we find that VeriDIP remains effective even for utility-preserving differentially private models, such as those with a higher privacy budget, e.g., ε=0.5𝜀0.5\\varepsilon=0.5. To summarize, our contributions are as follows: We propose VeriDIP, a model ownership testing (OT) approach for DNN models. VeriDIP utilizes the membership inference (MI) attack to estimate the privacy leakage of DNN models, which serves as the fingerprint of a given (victim/target) model. We further enhance VeriDIP by utilizing less private samples to estimate the worst-case privacy leakage, thereby strengthening the extracted fingerprints of DNN models. We perform extensive evaluations on VeriDIP using various DNN models trained with tabular or image benchmarks, against three types of model stealing attacks. The results show that VeriDIP can publicly authenticate all stolen copies with minimal verification costs. We theoretically and experimentally analyze the connection between the effectiveness of VeriDIP and differential privacy (DP) privacy protection. The results demonstrate that as long as a DP model is utility-preserving, VeriDIP can effectively protect its copyright.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Deep learning plays an important role in various tasks such as image recognition  [ref]2 , natural language processing , and speech recognition  tasks.
