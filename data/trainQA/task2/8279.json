      "content": "Paper Title: Corners in Quasirandom Groups via Sparse Mixing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the early 1980s, Chandra, Furst, and Lipton introduced the Number-on-Forehead (NOF) model of communication complexity  to better capture interaction with shared information. The k𝑘k-NOF model is defined by k𝑘k players communicating over a shared channel in order to compute a function f:({0,1}n)k→{0,1}:𝑓→superscriptsuperscript01𝑛𝑘01f:(\\{0,1\\}^{n})^{k}\\to\\{0,1\\}. Each player can see the k−1𝑘1k-1 inputs of every other player, but they cannot see their own. Albeit perhaps unintuitive at first glance, the model has a number of strikingly powerful and surprising connections to other areas of theoretical computer science and combinatorics. For example, lower bounds for k=ω​(log⁡n)𝑘𝜔𝑛k=\\omega(\\log n) players would imply breakthrough circuit lower bounds    [ref]9, and the communication complexity of several natural functions is known to be equivalent to central problems in Ramsey theory   . Unfortunately, our understanding of this model is severely lacking. Only in the past year have researchers discovered explicit functions witnessing strong separations between randomized and deterministic 3-NOF communication complexity , despite the fact that optimal separations were long known to exist non-explicitly . More precisely, Kelley, Lovett, and Meka exhibited an explicit 3-player function which has a constant cost randomized protocol, but requires Ω​(n1/3)Ωsuperscript𝑛13\\Omega(n^{1/3}) bits of communication to compute deterministically. Their primary technical tool is a combinatorial adaptation of ideas from the recent breakthrough of Kelley and Meka on three-term arithmetic progressions (3APs) . One of the most well-studied functions in the NOF setting is Exactly-N, where each player receives a number in [N]≔{1,2,…,N}≔delimited-[]𝑁12…𝑁[N]\\coloneqq\\{1,2,\\dots,N\\}, and they wish to determine if their numbers sum to N𝑁N. Introduced by , they showed that the 3-NOF complexity of Exactly-N is at most O​(log⁡N)𝑂𝑁O(\\sqrt{\\log N}) using the Behrend construction of 3-AP free sets . In fact, they observed a near equivalence between Exactly-N (for three players) and the size of sets S⊂[N]2𝑆superscriptdelimited-[]𝑁2S\\subset[N]^{2} without corners: three points (x,y),(x+z,y),(x,y+z)∈[N]2𝑥𝑦𝑥𝑧𝑦𝑥𝑦𝑧superscriptdelimited-[]𝑁2(x,y),(x+z,y),(x,y+z)\\in[N]^{2} with z≠0𝑧0z\\neq 0. The first nontrivial bounds on the size of such sets were proven earlier by Ajtai and Szemerédi , but the quantitative behavior was poor, since the proof relied on Szemerédi’s regularity lemma 2. The strongest bound to date is due to Shkredov 0, who showed any corner-free set of size δ​N2𝛿superscript𝑁2\\delta N^{2} must satisfy for some absolute constant c>0𝑐0c>0 (see also  and the exposition by Green over finite fields 3 4). Using the connection shown by , this implies that the complexity of Exactly-N is at least Ω​(log⁡log⁡log⁡N)Ω𝑁\\Omega(\\log\\log\\log N). Unfortunately, the techniques developed in  do not suffice to improve this lower bound, since they only apply to much denser functions. Concretely, the number of solutions of Exactly-N (that is, triples x,y,z∈[N]𝑥𝑦𝑧delimited-[]𝑁x,y,z\\in[N] that satisfy x+y+z=N𝑥𝑦𝑧𝑁x+y+z=N) is at most N2superscript𝑁2N^{2}, whereas the function exhibited by  to have strong lower bounds for deterministic NOF communication has N3−csuperscript𝑁3𝑐N^{3-c} solutions for some small constant c>0𝑐0c>0; their technique is restricted to such functions. Observe that corners may be viewed as a multidimensional generalization of arithmetic progressions. In fact, upper bounds on corner-free sets easily imply upper bounds on 3AP-free sets (see e.g. [55, Section 2.4]). Given their tight relationship, many researchers have suspected that the recent techniques of Kelley and Meka  used to improve bounds for 3AP-free sets will be amenable to usage in the case of corners (see e.g.  and [43, Section 1.2]). While there is some preliminary evidence that this direction is viable [ref]30 , such strong bounds remain currently beyond reach.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: connections to other areas of theoretical computer science and combinatorics.
