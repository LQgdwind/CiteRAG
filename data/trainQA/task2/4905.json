      "content": "Paper Title: Black Box Model Explanations and the Human Interpretability Expectations - An Analysis in the Context of Homicide Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDespite the wide applicability of ensemble-based algorithms (such as: bagging and boosting) in real-world problems, this group of algorithms has a smaller quantity of explainability measures and benchmark studies when compared to the current moment of studies concerning the explainability of neural networks . That is, there are still few model-agnostic XAI techniques. Currently, there are different types of XAI techniques aimed at generating global model-agnostic explanations, namely: Partial Dependence Plots - PDP, Accumulated Local Effects - ALE, Feature Interection, Functional Decomposition, Permutation Features Importance, Global Surrogate, and Prototypes and Criticisms . Based on these types of measures listed above, this research focuses on two types only: Permutation Feature Importance and Global Surrogate, since these two categories are capable of generating ranks and feature-compatible implementations.\nBased on the above, this research conducted a bibliographic and practical survey (development) on the main existing XAI measures, specifically aimed at generating model-agnostic global explainability ranks that support tabular data. As a result, a total of six tools were selected, with libraries updated and compatible with each other, with current Python development platforms and Scikit-Learning algorithms . These tools are: CIU 9, Dalex , Eli5 , Lofo 3, SHAP  e Skater . The measures referenced herein generate explanatory ranks based on the same previously-trained machine learning models, manipulate their inputs or/and produce new intermediate models (copies). Therefore, a comparison of the generated explanatory ranks is fair and feasible. It should be noted that during the initial analyzes and executions, as occurred in 8, this research found XAI measures with incompatibilities at the level of libraries and dependencies, making it impossible to use and compare some measures. For this reason, some XAI means were not used for this research (for example: Alibe-ALE , Lime 9, Ethical ExplainableAI 8, IBM Explainable AI 360 [ref]5, and Interpreter ML 4). The Contextual Importance and Utility - CIU is a XAI measure based on Decision Theory 3 that focuses on serving as a unified metric of model-agnostic explainability based on the implementation of two different indexes: Contextual Importance - CI and Contextual Utility - CU. As verified in preliminary tests carried out by this research, these two indices generate equal ranks. Thus, it was decided to use the CI9. The measure Dalex is a set of XAI tools based on the LOCO (leave one covariate out) approach and can generate explainabilities from this approach. This measure receives the model and the data to be explained, calculates model performance, performs new training processes with new generated data sets, and makes the inversion of each attribute of the data in a unitary and iterative way, measures what attributes are important to the model, evaluates its performance obtained according to the inversions of the attributes[ref]6 1. A little less popular but very powerful is the Leave One Feature Out - Lofo, a XAI measure with a similar proposal to that of Dalex, but no attribute inversion is performed here, because in the Lofo metric the iterative step is based on iterative removal of the attributes to find its global importance to the model. This measure also analyzes the performance of the model3. A very popular and quick measure to be performed, the Explain Like I’m Five - Eli5 is a tool that helps explore machine learning classifiers and explains the predictions thereof by assigning weights to decisions, as well as exporting decision trees and presenting the importance of the attributes of the model submitted to the tool. In its documentation, it is possible to see that this measure uses only training and test data to create the explanations, which is curious, given that the weights it extracts are based on a tree algorithm . One of the most popular and currently used measures is the SHapley Additive exPlanations - SHAP, proposed as a unified measure of attribute importance that explains the prediction of an instance X𝑋X from the contribution of an attribute. What makes this measure different from the others is the calculation explanation index based in the game theory of Shapley Value  0 . Last but not least is the measure Skater, a set of tools capable of generating ranks of the importance of model attributes, differing from the other measures to calculate its explanation index based on Information Theory 6, through measurements of entropy in changing predictions through a disturbance of a certain attribute. A general comparison of the main characteristics of the measures that meet the requirements of this research is shown in table 1. All the tools described above are capable of generating different types of explanations (instance-level explanation, dependent plot, impacts on the model output, similarity of instances, among others), which go beyond global explanations based on attribute ranks; therefore, the focus of this article is to compare this most basic unit of model explainability, i.e., the global importance rank. Even knowing that each of the XAI measures used in this research are based on different algorithms and methodologies, a comparison of their results is fair. Since it will only compare the basic structure of your explanations based on attribute rank.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: it impossible to use and compare some measures. For this reason, some XAI means were not used for this research (for example: Alibe-ALE , Lime 9, Ethical ExplainableAI 8, IBM Explainable AI 360 [ref]5, and Interpreter ML 4). The Contextual Importance and Utility - CIU is a XAI measure based on Decision Theory 3 that focuses on serving as a unified metric of model-agnostic explainability\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
