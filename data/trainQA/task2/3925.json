      "content": "Paper Title: The Smallest Hard Trees\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor a fixed directed graph (short: digraph) ‚Ñç‚Ñç\\mathbb{H}, the constraint satisfaction problem for ‚Ñç‚Ñç\\mathbb{H}, denoted by CSP‚Å°(‚Ñç)CSP‚Ñç\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbb{H}), is the computational problem of deciding whether a given finite digraph ùîæùîæ\\mathbb{G} admits a homomorphism to ‚Ñç‚Ñç\\mathbb{H}. This problem is also known as the ‚Ñç‚Ñç\\mathbb{H}-coloring problem.\nIf ‚Ñç‚Ñç\\mathbb{H} is finite and symmetric, then CSP‚Å°(‚Ñç)CSP‚Ñç\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbb{H}) can be solved in polynomial time if ‚Ñç‚Ñç\\mathbb{H} is bipartite or contains a loop, and is NP-complete otherwise¬†. The situation if ‚Ñç‚Ñç\\mathbb{H} is a finite but not necessarily symmetric digraph is much more complicated.\nThe Feder-Vardi dichotomy conjecture states that CSP‚Å°(‚Ñç)CSP‚Ñç\\operatorname{CSP}(\\mathbb{H}) is in P or NP-complete¬†.\nIn fact, the conjecture was phrased not only for digraphs but for the corresponding computational problem for general finite relational structures.\nHowever, it is known that every CSP for a finite relational structure is polynomial-time (and even logspace)\nequivalent to the CSP for a finite digraph¬† .\nThe Feder-Vardi conjecture was proved in 2017 independently by Bulatov¬† and by Zhuk¬† . Prior to their break-through result, the conjecture was open even if ‚Ñç‚Ñç\\mathbb{H} is an orientation of a finite tree. The description of the polynomially solvable cases in the proofs of Bulatov and of Zhuk is based on the so-called algebraic approach\nand phrased using polymorphisms of ‚Ñç‚Ñç\\mathbb{H}, i.e., edge-preserving multivariate operations on the vertex set (‚Äòhigher-dimensional symmetries‚Äô) [ref]12. The algebraic condition for polynomial-time tractability in the proofs of Bulatov and of Zhuk has numerous equivalent characterizations, e.g.   . Siggers was the first to show the (at the time somewhat surprising) fact that the condition can be characterized by the existence of a single, 6-ary polymorphism satisfying certain identities  ‚Äî which can readily be tested at least for very small digraphs. This was later improved by Kearnes, Markoviƒá, and McKenzie  to the existence of a single 4-ary operation, commonly referred to as a Siggers polymorphism, or a pair of 3-ary operations which we will call Kearnes-Markoviƒá-McKenzie polymorphisms (for the definition, see Section¬†6.1). The latter is computationally the most feasible (the search space is the smallest) and thus the most suitable for our purposes. The question whether a given finite digraph ‚Ñç‚Ñç\\mathbb{H} satisfies any of the equivalent characterizations of the algebraic tractability condition is decidable, but NP-hard¬†.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: Zhuk is based on the so-called algebraic approach\nand phrased using polymorphisms of ‚Ñç‚Ñç\\mathbb{H}, i.e., edge-preserving multivariate operations on the vertex set (‚Äòhigher-dimensional symmetries‚Äô) [ref]12.
