      "content": "Paper Title: Distillation Enhanced Time Series Forecasting Network with Momentum Contrastive Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTime series forecasting has been extensively studied, and various models have been developed to tackle this task. Traditional approaches include autoregressive models such as ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), exponential smoothing methods like Holt-Winters, and state space models like Kalman filters. These models capture temporal dependencies and exploit statistical properties of time series data. In recent years, deep learning models have gained popularity in time series forecasting due to their ability to automatically learn complex patterns and dependencies. Convolution Neural networks(CNNS) , Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)  , particularly variants like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), have shown success in capturing long-term dependencies in time series data. Temporal Convolution Network (TCN) introduces dilated convolutions for time series forecasting and demonstrates their superior efficiency and predictive performance compared to RNNs. Moreover, LSTnet 5 integrates CNNs and RNNs to simultaneously capture short-term local dependencies and long-term trends. Additionally, attention mechanisms have been integrated into RNN-based models to focus on informative time steps or features, improving the model’s forecasting accuracy6 [ref]42 [ref]32 . Transformer-based architectures, originally designed for natural language processing tasks, have also been adapted for time series forecasting by employing self-attention mechanisms.\nLogTrans6 employs convolutional self-attention layers with a LogSparse design to capture local information and reduce space complexity. Informer[ref]42 introduces a ProbSparse self-attention mechanism that uses distilling techniques to efficiently extract the most crucial keys. Autoformer [ref]32 incorporates the concepts of decomposition and auto-correlation from traditional time series analysis methods. FEDformer  employs a Fourier-transform structure to achieve linear complexity.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: and long-term trends. Additionally, attention mechanisms have been integrated into RNN-based models to focus on informative time steps or features, improving the model’s forecasting accuracy6 [ref]42 [ref]32 . Transformer-based architectures, originally designed for natural language processing tasks, have also been adapted for time series forecasting by employing self-attention\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
