      "content": "Paper Title: Allocating Indivisible Goods to Strategic Agents: Pure Nash Equilibria and FairnessAn extended abstract version of this work appeared in the Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Web and Internet Economics (WINE 2021) [8].\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere is a significant number of different notions one can use to determine which allocations are “fair”. The most prominent such notions are envy-freeness (EF)    and proportionality (PROP) , and, in the discrete setting we study here, their relaxations, namely envy-freeness up to one good (EF1) , envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) [ref]26, and maximin share fairness (MMS) . Particularly for additive valuation functions, we have that EF⇒EFX⇒EF1⇒EFEFX⇒EF1\\textrm{{EF}}\\Rightarrow\\textrm{{EFX}}\\Rightarrow\\textrm{{EF}1} and EF⇒PROP⇒MMS⇒EFPROP⇒MMS\\textrm{{EF}}\\Rightarrow\\textrm{{PROP}}\\Rightarrow\\textrm{{MMS}}, where X⇒Y⇒𝑋𝑌X\\Rightarrow Y means that any allocation that satisfies fairness criterion X𝑋X always satisfies fairness criterion Y𝑌Y as well. + An allocation (A1,…,An)subscript𝐴1…subscript𝐴𝑛(A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}) is envy-free (EF), if for every i,j∈N𝑖𝑗𝑁i,j\\in N, vi​(Ai)≥vi​(Aj)subscript𝑣𝑖subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝑣𝑖subscript𝐴𝑗v_{i}(A_{i})\\geq v_{i}(A_{j}). envy-free up to one good (EF1), if for every pair of agents i,j∈N𝑖𝑗𝑁i,j\\in N, with Aj≠∅subscript𝐴𝑗A_{j}\\neq\\emptyset, there exists a good g∈Aj𝑔subscript𝐴𝑗g\\in A_{j}, such that\nvi​(Ai)≥vi​(Aj∖{g})subscript𝑣𝑖subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝑣𝑖subscript𝐴𝑗𝑔v_{i}(A_{i})\\geq v_{i}(A_{j}\\setminus\\{g\\}). envy-free up to any good (EFX), if for every pair i,j∈N𝑖𝑗𝑁i,j\\in N, with Aj≠∅subscript𝐴𝑗A_{j}\\neq\\emptyset and every good g∈Aj𝑔subscript𝐴𝑗g\\in A_{j} with vi​(g)>0subscript𝑣𝑖𝑔0v_{i}(g)>0, it holds that vi​(Ai)≥vi​(Aj∖{g})subscript𝑣𝑖subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝑣𝑖subscript𝐴𝑗𝑔v_{i}(A_{i})\\geq v_{i}(A_{j}\\setminus\\{g\\}). While these notions rely on comparisons among the agents, proportionality focuses on everyone receiving at least a 1/n1𝑛1/n fraction of the total value. An allocation (A1,…,An)subscript𝐴1…subscript𝐴𝑛(A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}) is proportional (PROP), if for every i∈N𝑖𝑁i\\in N, vi​(Ai)≥vi​(M)/nsubscript𝑣𝑖subscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝑣𝑖𝑀𝑛v_{i}(A_{i})\\geq{v_{i}(M)}/{n}. In the same direction, but adjusted for indivisible goods, a number of fairness notions have been based on the notion of maximin shares .\nImagine that agent i𝑖i is asked to partition the goods into n𝑛n bundles, under the condition that she will receive the worst bundle among those. If the resources were divisible, then she would clearly split everything evenly into n𝑛n bundles of value vi​(M)/nsubscript𝑣𝑖𝑀𝑛{v_{i}(M)}/{n} each, thus capturing the benchmark required for proportionality. However, now that the goods are indivisible, agent i𝑖i would like to create a partition maximizing the minimum value of a bundle. This value is her maximin share. Given a subset S⊆M𝑆𝑀S\\subseteq M of goods, the n𝑛n-maximin share of agent i𝑖i with respect to S𝑆S is where Πn​(S)subscriptΠ𝑛𝑆\\Pi_{n}(S) is the set of all partitions of S𝑆S into n𝑛n bundles. From the definition and the preceding discussion, we have that n⋅𝝁i​(n,S)≤vi​(S)⋅𝑛subscript𝝁𝑖𝑛𝑆subscript𝑣𝑖𝑆n\\cdot\\bm{\\mu}_{i}(n,S)\\leq v_{i}(S).\nWhen S=M𝑆𝑀S=M, we call 𝝁i​(n,M)subscript𝝁𝑖𝑛𝑀\\bm{\\mu}_{i}(n,M) the maximin share of agent i𝑖i and denote it by 𝝁isubscript𝝁𝑖\\bm{\\mu}_{i} as long as it is clear what n𝑛n and M𝑀M are. An allocation\n𝒜=(A1,…,An)𝒜subscript𝐴1…subscript𝐴𝑛\\mathcal{A}=(A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}) is called an α𝛼\\alpha-maximin share fair (α𝛼\\alpha-MMS) allocation if vi​(Ai)≥α⋅𝝁isubscript𝑣𝑖subscript𝐴𝑖⋅𝛼subscript𝝁𝑖v_{i}(A_{i})\\geq\\alpha\\cdot\\bm{\\mu}_{i}\\,, for every i∈N𝑖𝑁i\\in N. When α=1𝛼1\\alpha=1 we just say that 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A} is an MMS allocation. Besides MMS, there exist other fairness criteria based on the notion of maximin shares, like pairwise maximin share fairness (PMMS) [ref]26 and groupwise maximin share fairness (GMMS) [ref]16. While we are not going into more details about them, it should be noted that PMMS⇒EFX⇒PMMSEFX\\textrm{{PMMS}}\\Rightarrow\\textrm{{EFX}} [ref]26 and that for n=2𝑛2n=2, MMS, PMMS, and GMMS coincide. In particular, we need the following result of Caragiannis et al. [ref]26. For n=2𝑛2\\,n=2, any MMS allocation is also an EFX allocation. In addition to the implications mentioned so far, one can consider how the approximate versions of EF1, EFX and MMS relate to each other (see [ref]5). Here we need the following result about the worst case MMS guarantee of an EFX allocation for the case of two agents. For n=2𝑛2\\,n=2, any EFX allocation is also a 2323\\frac{2}{3}-MMS allocation.\nThis guarantee is tight, in the sense that for every δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0 there exists an EFX allocation that is not a (23+δ)23𝛿\\big{(}\\frac{2}{3}+\\delta\\big{)}-MMS allocation, for any m≥4𝑚4m\\geq 4.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: are envy-freeness (EF)    and proportionality (PROP) , and, in the discrete setting we study here, their relaxations, namely envy-freeness up to one good (EF1) , envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) [ref]26, and maximin share fairness (MMS) .
