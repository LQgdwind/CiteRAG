      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Universe Model for Partial Matching Networks over Multiple Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are mainly two forms of methods to solve the Eq. 2 of MGM. The first solves the problem in discrete space, which includes the composition-based method CAO, MGM-Floyd   and the tree-structure-based approach MatchOpt [ref]16. These methods iteratively optimize the matching via finding the optimal matching chains over pairwise graph matching results, whereby the cycle consistency constraint is either automatically satisfied by the mechanism or encouraged in the objective function. Another line of works [ref]34   etc. try to relax the MGM problem into a continuous space and re-project the solution back to obtain a discrete matching result. The global consistency is maintained with a universe-graph-like structure and pursued via some continuous optimization methods, e.g. spectral clustering [ref]30, semidefinite programming [ref]34 and further robust improvement  using alternating direction methods of multipliers (ADMM) that can address the partial multi-graph matching setting. Differing from the above approaches that separate the affinity-based two-graph matching and consistency-driven smoothing into two stages, some other works e.g. MatchALS   also explore the joint optimization regarding consistency and affinity by relaxation in continuous space. Some extension settings of MGM are also explored as incremental multiple graph matching   or multiple graph matching and clustering  . Incremental multiple graph matching solver   aims to design an efficient algorithm for the setting where graphs are given one by one in sequence. Meanwhile,   propose the method to deal with graphs of mixed class as input, where matching and clustering are often iteratively performed to improve the accuracy of both sides.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: of methods to solve the Eq. 2 of MGM.
