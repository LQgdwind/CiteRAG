      "content": "Paper Title: Fine-Grained Emotion Prediction by Modeling Emotion Definitions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDifferent Transformer Architectures Experiments:\nWe experiment with different transformer architectures: BERT, XLNet, RoBERTa, ALBERT, to compare their performances as base models for emotion classification on GoEmotions dataset. We keep the same hyperparameters as in , except for an increase in the number of training epochs to 10. A classifier layer is added to all the models, followed by binary cross-entropy loss. Binary classification on all categories is used to accommodate multi-labeled instances. Fine-Grained Experiments:\nWe use the same hyperparameters as in the previous experiment. We experiment with proportional sampling during training with the following range of values for Bernoulli distribution probability p‚àà{0.1,0.2,0.3,‚Ä¶,0.9}ùëù0.10.20.3‚Ä¶0.9p\\in\\{0.1,0.2,0.3,...,0.9\\}, where pùëùp corresponds to the probability of training the primary task during an iteration. These experiments are carried on all the three auxiliary tasks setups considered for the proposed framework as explained in Section 2: CDP only MLM only both CDP and MLM Transfer Learning-Based Experiments:\nIn transfer learning-based experiments, we test the adaptability and generalization capability of the proposed model to other domains and emotion label sets. We use the best performing model(s) trained on GoEmotions dataset obtained in previous experiments to initialize training on other datasets, thereby transferring the knowledge learned from GoEmotions to a target domain. We compare the performance of our model(s) to vanilla BERT and BERT trained on GoEmotions proposed by  following the same parameters and experimental setup. Emotion corpora from the Unified Dataset  are selected for the experiments; in particular, we experiment on benchmark datasets ISEAR[ref]26, EmoInt, and Emotion-Stimulus owing to their diversity in source domains and emotion label sets. During training on each dataset, train data size is varied in the range (100,200,500,1000,80%‚Äão‚Äãf‚Äãt‚Äão‚Äãt‚Äãa‚Äãl)1002005001000percent80ùëúùëìùë°ùëúùë°ùëéùëô(100,200,500,1000,80\\%\\ of\\ total), the remaining data is taken for the test set. The above is repeated for ten random splits for each set size.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: proposed by  following the same parameters and experimental setup.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
