Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

In particular, DARTS [ref]23 significantly increases the search efficiency by relaxing the categorical choice of operation to be continuous, so that the architecture can be optimized by gradient descent.\nIn this work, we develop an efficient NAS algorithm for object detectors, by fast searching the optimized transformations. NAS has been applied to many vision tasks apart from image classification, such as object detection  [ref]1  . For example, NAS-FPN  uses a RL-based NAS to search for an optimal FPN  on the RetinaNet.\nDetNAS [ref]1 aims at finding the optimal shuffle-block-based backbone network in object detectors using an evolution algorithm  .\nA channel-level NAS is proposed in NATS  to search for the backbone in object detectors.\nAlternatively, some recent works search for the detection-specific parts rather than the backbone for object detection.\nFor instance, Auto-FPN  searches for a FPN structure\nand head structures.\nSM-NAS  also searches for two-stage detectors by first conducting a structural-level search and then a modular-level search. Instead of exploring novel structures, CR-NAS  aims to re-allocate the computation resources in the backbone.\nNAS-FCOS  is a FCOS-based detector in which the structure of its FPN and the following sub-networks are computed using RL-based NAS.\nIn this work, we design the search space specifically for object detection, and propose the FAD method to search for the sub-networks in one-stage detectors.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: Recent attention has been moved from network design by hand to neural architecture search (NAS)    [ref]26 [ref]23.\nA stream of efficient NAS methods is the differentiable NAS [ref]26 [ref]23.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
