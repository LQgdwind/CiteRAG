All data is provided in full in the results section of this paper.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs our main contribution, we generalize the result of Atserias et al.¬† from Boolean CSPs to CSPs on arbitrary finite domains.\nAs has been done in, e.g,¬†4 , we\nrepresent a finite domain of size dùëëd by the dùëëd-th roots of unity, and require\nthat each operator Aùê¥A in an operator assignment should be normal (i.e. A‚ÄãA‚àó=A‚àó‚ÄãAùê¥superscriptùê¥superscriptùê¥ùê¥AA^{*}=A^{*}A)\nand should satisfy Ad=Isuperscriptùê¥ùëëùêºA^{d}=I. The representation of non-Boolean CSPs relies on\nmulti-dimensional Fourier transform.\nOur main result\nproves that\nCSPs of bounded width (on arbitrary finite domains) do not have a\nsatisfiability gap, meaning that classical satisfiability is equivalent to\nsatisfiability via operators (Theorem¬†9); and all other CSPs do have a\nsatisfiability gap, meaning that classical satisfiability is not equivalent to\nsatisfiability via operators\n(Theorem¬†19). Let ŒìŒì\\Gamma be an arbitrary finite set of relations on a finite domain. If CSP‚Äã(Œì)CSPŒì{\\rm CSP}(\\Gamma) has\nbounded width then classical and operator satisfiability are the same for\nCSP‚Äã(Œì)CSPŒì{\\rm CSP}(\\Gamma). Otherwise, classical and operator satisfiability are not the same\nfor CSP‚Äã(Œì)CSPŒì{\\rm CSP}(\\Gamma). The proof\nrelies on several ingredients. Firstly, we observe that\nresults establishing that primitive positive definability preserve\nsatisfiability gaps¬† can be lifted from Boolean to arbitrary finite\ndomains. Secondly, for CSPs of bounded width we show that there is no difference\nbetween classical and operator satisfiability by simulating the inference by the\nso-called Singleton Linear Arc Consistency (SLAC) algorithm in polynomial\nequations. We note that while there are several (seemingly stronger) algorithms\nfor CSPs of bounded width, our proof relies crucially on the special structure of SLAC and\nthe breakthrough result of Kozik that SLAC solves all CSPs of bounded\nwidth¬†. Thirdly, to prove that CSPs of unbounded width have\nsatisfiability gaps we use the algebraic approach to CSPs, namely, we show that not\nonly primitive positive definitions but also other reductions,\nnamely going to the core, adding constants, and restrictions to subalgebras and\nfactors, preserve satisfiability gaps. Finally, for all odd dùëëd we give an\nexplicit construction of a CSP instance with a satisfiability gap, which is a\ngeneralization of the Mermin-Peres square. We note that that there is a significant hurdle to go from Boolean CSPs to CSPs\nover arbitrary finite domains. While any non-Boolean CSP can be Booleanized via\nindicator variables and extra constraints, such constructions do not\nimmediately imply classifications of non-Boolean CSPs as the ‚Äúencoding\nconstraints‚Äù are intended to be used in only a particular way. Indeed, while\nthe complexity of Boolean CSPs was established by Schaefer in\n1978¬† and the complexity of CSPs on three-element domains\nwas established by Bulatov in 2002¬† [ref]14, the\ndichotomy for all finite domains was only established in\n2017¬† [ref]56 .\nSimilarly for other variants of CSPs and different notions of tractability,\nresults on Boolean domains, including the work of Atserias et\nal.¬†, rely crucially on the explicit knowledge of the structure\nof relations on Boolean domains (established by Post¬†), which is not known for non-Boolean CSPs.\nIndeed, on the tractability side, the structure of relations in tractable Boolean CSPs is simple and very well understood; on the intractability side, reductions based only on primitive positive definitions suffice for a complete classification of Boolean CSPs. Neither of these two facts is true for non-Boolean CSPs. We find it fascinating that bounded width is the borderline for satisfiability\ngaps for CSPs, thus linking a notion coming from a natural combinatorial\nalgorithm for CSPs with a foundational topic in quantum computation.\nThis is yet another result confirming how fundamental the notion of bounded width\nis, capturing not only the power of the local consistency\nalgorithm¬†0    as conjectured\nin¬†3 with links to Datalog, pebble games, and\nlogic¬†3 6, but also robust solvability of\nCSPs¬†, exact solvability of valued CSPs by\nLP¬† and SDP¬† relaxations, and now also\nsatisfiability via operators.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: in only a particular way. Indeed, while\nthe complexity of Boolean CSPs was established by Schaefer in\n1978¬† and the complexity of CSPs on three-element domains\nwas established by Bulatov in 2002¬† [ref]14, the\ndichotomy for all finite domains was only established in\n2017¬† [ref]56 .\nSimilarly for other variants of CSPs and different notions of tractability,\nresults on Boolean domains, including\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
