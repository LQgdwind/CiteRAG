Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Network-Based Rule Models With Truth Tables\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe used RMSE, AUC, and accuracy for the evaluation of the regression, binary classification, and multi-class classification respectively. Rules and complexity are defined in Section 3.1.3. All results are presented after grid search and 5-fold cross-validation. All the training features are detailed in the supplementary Section. We compare the performance of our method with that of several other algorithms, including Linear/Logistic Regression , Decision Trees (DT), Generalized Linear Models (GL)[ref]47, Neural Additive Models (NAM), XGBoost, and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) . The supplementary materials provide details on the training conditions used for these competing methods.\nExperiments are available on demand.\nOur workstation consists of eight cores Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8650U CPU clocked at 1.90 GHz, 16 GB RAM. We utilized a variety of healthcare and non-healthcare datasets for our study. For multi-classification, we used the Diabetes 130 US-Hospitals dataset111https://bit.ly/diabetes_130_uci from the UCI Machine Learning Repository . For binary classification tasks, we used two single-cell RNA-seq analysis datasets, one for head and neck cancer222https://bit.ly/neck_head_rna 7 and another for melanoma 333https://bit.ly/melanoma_rna, as well as the TCGA lung cancer dataset444https://bit.ly/tcga_lung_rna 3 for regression. For binary classification tasks, we used the Adult dataset555https://bit.ly/Adult_uci from the UCI Machine Learning Repository , the Compas dataset666https://bit.ly/Compas_data introduced by ProPublica , and the HELOC dataset [ref]1. We also employed the California Housing dataset777https://bit.ly/california_statlib 4 for the regression task. Supplementary details regarding each of the datasets can be found in the supplementary Section materials. Our TT-rules framework’s scalability is demonstrated using two DNA datasets, namely the single-cell RNA-seq analysis datasets for head neck, and melanoma cancer 7  for binary classification and the TCGA lung cancer3 for regression. These datasets contain 23689 and 20530 features, respectively, and are commonly used in real-life machine learning applications 2  9 .\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: the supplementary Section. We compare the performance of our method with that of several other algorithms, including Linear/Logistic Regression , Decision Trees (DT), Generalized Linear Models (GL)[ref]47, Neural Additive Models (NAM), XGBoost, and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) . The supplementary materials provide details on the training conditions used for these competing methods.\nExperiments\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
