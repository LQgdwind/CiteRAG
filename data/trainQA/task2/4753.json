      "content": "Paper Title: Optimizing Data Collection for Machine Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNeural Scaling Laws.\n\nAccording to the neural scaling law literature, the performance of a model on a validation set scales with the size of the training data set q𝑞q via a power law V∝θ0​qθ1proportional-to𝑉subscript𝜃0superscript𝑞subscript𝜃1V\\propto\\theta_{0}q^{\\theta_{1}}  [ref]6 [ref]8 [ref]9      .\nHestness et al.  observe this property over vision, language, and audio tasks, Bahri et al. [ref]9 develop a theoretical relationship under assumptions on over-parametrization and the Lipschitz continuity of the loss, model, and data, and Rosenfeld et al. [ref]6 estimate power laws using smaller data sets and models to extrapolate future performance.\n\nMulti-variate scaling laws have also been considered for some specific tasks, for example in transfer learning from synthetic to real data sets .\nFinally, Mahmood et al.  explore data collection by estimating the minimum amount of data needed to meet a given target performance over multiple rounds.\nOur paper extends these prior studies by developing an optimization problem to minimize the expected total cost of data collected. Specifically, we incorporate the uncertainty in any regression estimate of data requirements and further generalize to multiple data sources with different costs. Active Learning.\n\nIn active learning, a model sequentially collects data by selecting new subsets of an unlabeled data pool to label under a pre-determined labeling budget that replenishes after each round 0 1 2 3 4. In contrast, our work focuses on systematically determining an optimal collection budget. After determining how much data to collect, we can use active learning techniques to collect the desired amount of data. Statistical Learning Theory.\n\nTheoretical analysis of the sample complexity of machine learning models is typically only tight asymptotically, but some recent work have empirically analyzed these relationships 5 6.\nParticularly, Bisla et al.  study generalization bounds for deep neural networks, provide empirical validation, and suggest using them to estimate data requirements.\nIn contrast, our paper formally explores the consequences of collection costs on data requirements. Optimal Experiment Design.\nThe topic of how to collect data, select samples, and design scientific experiments or controlled trials is well-studied in econometrics 7 8 9.\nFor example, Bertsimas et al.  optimize the assignment of samples into control and trial groups to minimize inter-group variances.\nMost recently, Carneiro et al.  optimize how many samples and covariates to collect in a statistical experiment by minimizing a treatment effect estimation error or maximizing t𝑡t-test power.\nHowever, our focus on industrial machine learning applications differs from experiment design by having target performance metrics and continual rounds of collection and modeling.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: of a model on a validation set scales with the size of the training data set q𝑞q via a power law V∝θ0​qθ1proportional-to𝑉subscript𝜃0superscript𝑞subscript𝜃1V\\propto\\theta_{0}q^{\\theta_{1}}  [ref]6 [ref]8 [ref]9      .\nHestness et al.  observe this property over vision, language, and audio tasks, Bahri et al.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
