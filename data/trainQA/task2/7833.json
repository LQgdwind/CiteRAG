      "content": "Paper Title: An 808 Line Phasor-Based Dehomogenisation Matlab Code For Multi-Scale Topology Optimisation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTopology optimisation is an established and systematic tool in engineering design and research. The premise is to obtain optimised structural layouts within a given physical design domain, according to specific objectives and constraints. This methodology is particularly valuable in industry applications due to its limited requirement for prior knowledge of the design. Topology optimisation has been applied to numerous fields of study, varying from elastic problems to photonics. Educational dissemination of topology optimisation methods has been achieved through publications of complete interactive apps or software, originating with the top99 code by Sigmund, . Most of these publications focus on smaller-scale problems, whereas Aage et al.,  provides a large-scale topology optimisation framework using PETSc. An extensive review of educational and publicly available codes is presented in Wang et al., . Giga-scale topology optimisation was shown by Aage et al.,  and Baandrup et al.,  to reveal important aspects of structural design, as novel high-performing structures with bridging length scales were found. These frameworks require a considerable amount of computational resources to achieve these results, due to the discretisation needed to realise the minimum length scale. An alternative approach is to relax the length scale discretisation using a periodic homogenised design representation. Homogenisation-based topology optimisation constitutes the foundation of the research field, first introduced in the seminal paper by Bendsøe and Kikuchi, [ref]7. Due to the multi-scale nature of the optimised structures, obtaining a corresponding realisation on a single length-scale is not trivial, and has likely been a contributing factor as to why this original method stayed passive until recent years. The single-scale reconstruction of homogenised results involves approximating the conformality and constant periodicity of the multi-scale structure on a finite length scale, as first established in Pantz and Trabelsi, 0 with the introduction of the projection-based dehomogenisation approach, which was later improved by Groen and Sigmund, 4. Numerous other frameworks have been proposed, based on a variety of different concepts. Wu et al.,  presented an approach using meshing techniques and Stutz et al., 7 developed a streamline tracing based procedure. A pattern-generating neural network was employed in Elingaard et al., , whereas Garnier et al., 1 utilised reaction-diffusion-driven pattern formation. Along similar lines, Woldseth et al., [ref]32 recently proposed a phasor-based dehomogenisation heuristic, based on noise functions from computer graphics. Senhora et al., 1 utilised spinodal metamaterials, with inherent similarities in parameterisation, to the phasor noise approach. The dehomogenisation capabilities have also been extended to incorporate multiple loads 8 and manage 3D domains 2 5 7. By considering a homogenised solution in a layer-wise manner, the oriented periodic multi-scale microtructures are projected to finite periodic laminates with smoothly varying orientations. To ensure structural integrity on a finite length-scale, the dehomogenised design must be separated from the underlying homogenisation assumptions, reflected by the orientation conformality objective of the projection. There is an inherent conflict between the microscale assumption of perfect bonding and the macroscale discontinuities arising from evaluating the microstructure parameters at the centre of each macroscale element 9. Bonding on the macroscale is ensured by the smoothness of the conformal-like mapping, but requires distortion of the microstructure geometry . The dehomogenised design should converge towards the correct microstructure shape for increasingly fine length-scales. To this end, the proportions of the microstructure should be preserved in the realisation, which facilitates requirements of spatially coherent layer-spacing. The concepts of best approximating conformality and obtain uniform layer-spacing causes conflict for any non-trivial orientation field, and the heuristic nature of different dehomogenisation approaches emerges from measures aiming to obtain a balanced trade-off between these incompatible requirements. Nevertheless, dehomogenisation approaches have been proven to produce large-scale topology optimisation results from coarse parameterisations of multi-scale structures. The obtained structural performance is consistently within 10% of the conventional large-scale approaches, while the computational cost is reduced by several orders of magnitudes, even allowing for solving on conventional workstation PCs 4 8 7 [ref]32. The phasor noise-based dehomogenisation procedure [ref]32 has proven to provide a highly efficient and well-performing alternative to the more conventional approaches. By exploiting the compact representation and real-time rendering properties of procedural noise functions 8, many of the computational restrictions of existing methods are overcome, achieving advantageous scalability properties facilitating potential for on-the-fly dehomogenisation. The dehomogenisation implementation is, however, nontrivial and involves a number of computer graphics aspects and heuristic adaptions. Motivated by these observations, an integrated and accessible dehomogenisation and homogenisation-based topology optimisation framework is presented. The deHomTop808 code presents an integrated workflow combining minimum compliance multi-scale topology optimisation utilising a stiffness-optimal material parameterisation with dehomogenisation to a fine-scale physica structural design. The code constitutes a comprehensive design tool, aimed at giving everyday structural engineers an efficient and adaptable large-scale topology optimisation framework, that can run on simple computer hardware. The deHomTop808 code is capable of, Maximising stiffness of a single-load case scenario subjected to a constraint on the maximum allowed material use. Performing on-the-fly dehomogenisation of the stiffness-optimised structure to a given minimum length scale. Verify the dehomogenised fine-scale structure for stiffness and volume fraction performance. A multi-scale composite material, the orthogonal Rank-2 laminate, is used as the design material due to its stiffness optimal properties for single-load problem cases. The Rank-2 material is, however, parameterised on two different length scales, which makes the realisation of the microstructure challenging. Instead, a single-scale translation of this parameterisation is introduced, with a corresponding mapping to its multi-scale counterpart, to obtain the Rank-2 material properties. This single-scale parameterisation is subsequently utilised to dehomogenise the Rank-2 structure by the phasor-based approach. With the single-scale parameterisation, minimum length-scale control is introduced, increasing the relevancy for manufacturing-oriented design applications.\nFor improved readability and compactness, the deHomTop808 code consists of a new formulation and implementation of the homogenisation-based optimisation procedure, as well as a simplified version of the original phasor-based dehomogenisation procedure [ref]32. A visual overview of the code capabilities is seen in Figure 1.\nThe code presented builds on the concept of the top88 code  and the top250 code 0 utilising the modified OC routine.\nThe code was developed and tested using MATLAB, version R2023b, including MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox111The code can also be executed without the MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox, but the behaviour may change, which is discussed in Section 2. and is tested on Linux kernel 6.6 Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS, Mac OS Sonoma 14.4 and Windows 11 operative systems. To provide fundamentals for how deHomTop808 is operated, this paper starts with an introduction of the executable and its various inputs in Section 2. For understanding the mathematical models and methodologies utilised in this code, fundamental theory is presented for the multi-scale topology optimisation problem in Section 3.1 and the phasor-based dehomogenisation in Section 3.2. Section 4 provides a more detailed description of the deHomTop808 code, in terms of how the code is organised, the different parameters, and how it relates to the theory in Section 3.1- 03.2. Examples and performance considerations are presented in Section 5. Potential extensions to the code are presented in Section 6, and final remarks are given in Section 7.
