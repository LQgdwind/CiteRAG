      "content": "Paper Title: Computational complexity of isometric tensor network states\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSchuch et al.¬† have used a duality between PEPS and postselected quantum circuits to show that a machine capable of preparing any PEPS is equivalent to a postselected quantum computer.\nIn contrast, by virtue of the isometry condition, isoTNS are dual to quantum circuits, which naturally lead to the result that a machine that can prepare isoTNS is equivalent to a quantum computer. Anshu et al.¬† use a similar (to the present work) fault-tolerant embedding of quantum circuits in injective PEPS to show that injective PEPS are BQP-hard. They also show that determining expectation values of non-local observables to multiplicative precision is #P-hard.\nIn injective isoTNS, we find that local expectation values are BQP-complete and thus hard on classical computers.\nNote that while it is clear that isoTNS can be prepared on a quantum computer, this is not clear for injective PEPS as considered in Ref.¬†.\nIt may well be the case that their complexity is greater than BQP. Many results exist on the difficulty of sampling¬†, even from shallow-depth circuits¬†.\nTo show that sampling from isoTNS to multiplicative error is hard independent of the injectivity parameter, we establish a link between maximally injective isoTNS and IQP circuits (circuits of commuting gates), which are known to be hard to sample from unless postBQP==postBPP¬†. Our results establishing that computing local expectation values in sufficiently injective isoTNS is easy draw on early results showing that noisy quantum computers undergo a complexity transition¬† , which uses a similar percolation result to the present paper.\nSimilarly, after mapping sampling in isoTNS to monitored quantum circuits, we can draw on the large body of literature that establishes conditions under which such monitored circuits become easy to simulate¬†[ref]33  . Another result that establishes conditions under which there is an efficient classical algorithm to compute local expectation values in injective PEPS is obtained in Ref.¬†.\nThere, it was shown that local observables in a normalized injective PEPS on d‚àílimit-fromùëëd-dimensions can be computed to a precision œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon by just restricting the PEPS to a log‚Å°(œµ‚àí1)superscriptitalic-œµ1\\log(\\epsilon^{-1}) length cube around the local observable.\nIn 2‚ÄãD2ùê∑2D, this would also yield a poly‚Å°(œµ‚àí1)polysuperscriptitalic-œµ1\\operatorname{poly}(\\epsilon^{-1}) algorithm for computing the local observable.\nThe key distinction between this and our result is that the result in Ref.¬† does not rely on isometry,\nbut instead they require that the frustration-free parent Hamiltonian of the PEPS is gapped and remains uniformly gapped when removing terms, which is an unrelated and potentially stronger condition. IsoTNS can also be viewed as being prepared from a chain of ancillas interacting sequentially with arrays of qubits¬†, similar to how MPS can be prepared from a single emitter¬†.\nThis links efforts to find efficient classical numerical approaches based on tensor networks to efforts to utilize qubit-efficient ‚Äúholographic‚Äù ways of simulating quantum systems¬†     .\nOur work directly applies to states generated in such schemes and may thus also be useful to understand the power and limitation of such approaches.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: after mapping sampling in isoTNS to monitored quantum circuits, we can draw on the large body of literature that establishes conditions under which such monitored circuits become easy to simulate¬†[ref]33  .
