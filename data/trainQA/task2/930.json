      "content": "Paper Title: Tight Approximation Guarantees for Concave Coverage Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCoverage functions are central objects of study in combinatorial optimization. Problems related to optimizing such functions arise in multiple fields, such as operations research , machine learning , algorithmic game theory , and information theory . The most basic covering problem is the maximum coverage one. In this problem, we are given subsets T1,…,Tmsubscript𝑇1…subscript𝑇𝑚T_{1},\\ldots,T_{m} of a universe [n]delimited-[]𝑛[n], along with a positive integer k𝑘k, and the objective is to find a size-k𝑘k subset S⊆[m]𝑆delimited-[]𝑚S\\subseteq[m] that maximizes the coverage function C​(S)≔|⋃i∈STi|≔𝐶𝑆subscript𝑖𝑆subscript𝑇𝑖C(S)\\coloneqq\\absolutevalue{\\bigcup_{i\\in S}T_{i}}. A fundamental result in the field of approximation algorithms establishes that an approximation ratio of 1−e−11superscript𝑒11-e^{-1} can be achieved for this problem in polynomial-time  and, in fact, this approximation guarantee is tight, under the assumption that P≠NPPNP{\\rm P}\\not={\\rm NP} . Note that in the maximum coverage problem, an element a∈[n]𝑎delimited-[]𝑛a\\in[n] is counted at most once in the objective, even if a𝑎a appears in several selected sets. However, if we think of elements a∈[n]𝑎delimited-[]𝑛a\\in[n] as goods or resources, there are many settings wherein the utility indeed increases with the number of copies of a𝑎a that get accumulated. Motivated, in part, by such settings, we consider a generalization of the maximum coverage problem where an element a𝑎a can contribute by an amount that depends on the number of times it is covered. Given a function φ:ℕ→ℝ+:𝜑→ℕsubscriptℝ\\varphi:\\mathbb{N}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}_{+}, an integer k∈ℕ𝑘ℕk\\in\\mathbb{N}, a universe of elements [n]delimited-[]𝑛[n], positive weights wasubscript𝑤𝑎w_{a} for each a∈[n]𝑎delimited-[]𝑛a\\in[n], and subsets T1,…,Tm⊆[n]subscript𝑇1…subscript𝑇𝑚delimited-[]𝑛T_{1},\\ldots,T_{m}\\subseteq[n], the φ𝜑\\varphi-MaxCoverage problem entails maximizing Cφ​(S)≔∑a∈[n]wa​φ​(|S|a)≔superscript𝐶𝜑𝑆subscript𝑎delimited-[]𝑛subscript𝑤𝑎𝜑subscript𝑆𝑎C^{\\varphi}(S)\\coloneqq\\sum_{a\\in[n]}w_{a}\\varphi(\\absolutevalue{S}_{a}) over subsets S⊆[m]𝑆delimited-[]𝑚S\\subseteq[m] of cardinality k𝑘k; here |S|a=|{i∈S:a∈Ti}|subscript𝑆𝑎conditional-set𝑖𝑆𝑎subscript𝑇𝑖\\absolutevalue{S}_{a}=\\absolutevalue{\\{i\\in S:a\\in T_{i}\\}}. This work focuses on functions φ𝜑\\varphi that are nondecreasing and concave (i.e., φ​(i+2)−φ​(i+1)≤φ​(i+1)−φ​(i)𝜑𝑖2𝜑𝑖1𝜑𝑖1𝜑𝑖\\varphi(i+2)-\\varphi(i+1)\\leq\\varphi(i+1)-\\varphi(i) for i∈ℕ𝑖ℕi\\in\\mathbb{N}). We will also assume that the function φ𝜑\\varphi is normalized in the sense that φ​(0)=0𝜑00\\varphi(0)=0 and φ​(1)=1𝜑11\\varphi(1)=1.444One can always replace a generic φ𝜑\\varphi to a normalized one without changing the optimal solutions through a simple affine transformation. Our approximation guarantees are in terms of the Poisson concavity ratio of φ𝜑\\varphi, which we define as follows: Here Poi⁡(x)Poi𝑥\\operatorname{\\text{Poi}}(x) denotes a Poisson-distributed random variable with parameter x𝑥x. We will write αφ​(x)≔𝔼​[φ​(Poi⁡(x))]φ​(x)≔subscript𝛼𝜑𝑥𝔼delimited-[]𝜑Poi𝑥𝜑𝑥\\alpha_{\\varphi}(x)\\coloneqq\\frac{\\mathbb{E}[\\varphi(\\operatorname{\\text{Poi}}(x))]}{\\varphi(x)}, with αφ​(0)=1subscript𝛼𝜑01\\alpha_{\\varphi}(0)=1, and hence (see Proposition A.3), αφ=minx∈ℕ∗⁡αφ​(x)=infx∈ℝ+αφ​(x)subscript𝛼𝜑subscript𝑥superscriptℕsubscript𝛼𝜑𝑥subscriptinfimum𝑥subscriptℝsubscript𝛼𝜑𝑥\\alpha_{\\varphi}=\\min_{x\\in\\mathbb{N}^{*}}\\alpha_{\\varphi}(x)=\\inf_{x\\in\\mathbb{R}_{+}}\\alpha_{\\varphi}(x).555We require φ𝜑\\varphi to be defined for nonnegative integers and will extend it over ℝ+subscriptℝ\\mathbb{R}_{+} by considering its piecewise linear extension. Our main result is that the φ𝜑\\varphi-MaxCoverage problem admits an efficient αφsubscript𝛼𝜑\\alpha_{\\varphi}-approximation algorithm, when φ𝜑\\varphi is normalized nondecreasing concave, and this approximation guarantee is tight when φ𝜑\\varphi grows sublinearly. Formally, For any normalized nondecreasing concave function φ𝜑\\varphi, there exists a polynomial-time αφsubscript𝛼𝜑\\alpha_{\\varphi}-approximation algorithm for the φ𝜑\\varphi-MaxCoverage problem. Furthermore, for φ​(n)=o​(n)𝜑𝑛𝑜𝑛\\varphi(n)=o(n), it is NP-hard to approximate the φ𝜑\\varphi-MaxCoverage problem within a factor better than αφ+εsubscript𝛼𝜑𝜀\\alpha_{\\varphi}+\\varepsilon, for any constant ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0. Before detailing the proof of the theorem, we provide a few remarks and connections to related work. We can directly reduce the standard maximum coverage problem to φ𝜑\\varphi-MaxCoverage by setting φ​(j)=min⁡{j,1}𝜑𝑗𝑗1\\varphi(j)=\\min\\{j,1\\}. In this case αφ=1−e−1subscript𝛼𝜑1superscript𝑒1\\alpha_{\\varphi}=1-e^{-1}. One can also encapsulate, within our framework, the ℓℓ\\ell-MultiCoverage problem studied in  by instantiating φ​(j)=min⁡{j,ℓ}𝜑𝑗𝑗ℓ\\varphi(j)=\\min\\{j,\\ell\\}. In this setting, we recover the approximation ratio αφ=1−ℓℓ​e−ℓℓ!subscript𝛼𝜑1superscriptℓℓsuperscript𝑒ℓℓ\\alpha_{\\varphi}=1-\\frac{\\ell^{\\ell}e^{-\\ell}}{\\ell!}, which matches the approximation guarantee obtained in  (see Proposition B.1). Note that the hardness result in  was based on the Unique Games Conjecture, whereas the current work proves that this guarantee is tight under P≠NPPNP{\\rm P}\\not={\\rm NP}. Another application of φ𝜑\\varphi-MaxCoverage is in the context of multiwinner elections that entail selecting k𝑘k (out of m𝑚m) candidates with the objective of maximizing the cumulative utility of n𝑛n voters; here, the utility of each voter a∈[n]𝑎delimited-[]𝑛a\\in[n] increases as more and more approved (by a𝑎a) candidates get selected. One can reduce multiwinner elections to a coverage problem by considering subset Ti⊆[n]subscript𝑇𝑖delimited-[]𝑛T_{i}\\subseteq[n] as the set of voters that approve of candidate i∈[m]𝑖delimited-[]𝑚i\\in[m] and φ​(j)𝜑𝑗\\varphi(j) as the utility that an agent achieves from j𝑗j approved selections.666Indeed, for a subset of candidates S⊆[m]𝑆delimited-[]𝑚S\\subseteq[m], the utility of a voter a∈[n]𝑎delimited-[]𝑛a\\in[n] is equal to φ​(|S|a)𝜑subscript𝑆𝑎\\varphi(\\absolutevalue{S}_{a}), with |S|a=|{i∈S:a∈Ti}|subscript𝑆𝑎conditional-set𝑖𝑆𝑎subscript𝑇𝑖\\absolutevalue{S}_{a}=\\absolutevalue{\\{i\\in S:a\\in T_{i}\\}}. Addressing multiwinner elections in this standard utilitarian model, Dudycz et al.  obtain tight approximation guarantees for some well-studied classes of utilities. Specifically, the result in  applies to the classic proportional approval voting rule, which assigns a utility of ∑i=1j1isuperscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑗1𝑖\\sum_{i=1}^{j}\\frac{1}{i} for j𝑗j approved selections. This voting rule corresponds to the coverage problem with φ​(j)=∑i=1j1i𝜑𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑗1𝑖\\varphi(j)=\\sum_{i=1}^{j}\\frac{1}{i}. Section 4.1 shows that Theorem 1 holds for all the settings considered in  and, in fact, applies more generally. In particular, the voting version of ℓℓ\\ell-MultiCoverage (studied in ) can be addressed by Theorem 1, but not by the result in . Such a separation also arises when one truncates the proportional approval voting rule to, say, ℓℓ\\ell candidates, i.e., upon setting φ​(j)=∑i=1min⁡{j,ℓ}1i𝜑𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑗ℓ1𝑖\\varphi(j)=\\sum_{i=1}^{\\min\\{j,\\ell\\}}\\frac{1}{i}. Given that multiwinner elections model multiple real-world settings (e.g., committee selection  and parliamentary proceedings [ref]6), instantiations of φ𝜑\\varphi-MaxCoverage in such social-choice contexts substantiate the applicability of our algorithmic result. Coverage functions arise in numerous resource-allocation settings, such as sensor allocation , job scheduling, and plant location . The goal, broadly, in such setups is to select k𝑘k subsets of resources (out of m𝑚m pre-specified ones) such that the welfare generated by the selected resources is maximized–each resource’s contribution to the welfare increases with the number of times it is selected. This problem can be cast as φ𝜑\\varphi-MaxCoverage by setting n𝑛n to be the number of resources, {Ti}i∈[m]subscriptsubscript𝑇𝑖𝑖delimited-[]𝑚\\{T_{i}\\}_{i\\in[m]} as the given collection of subsets, and φ​(j)𝜑𝑗\\varphi(j) to be the welfare contribution of a resource when it is covered j𝑗j times.777Formally, to capture specific welfare-maximization problems in their entirety we have to a consider φ𝜑\\varphi-MaxCoverage with a matroid constraint, and not just bound the number of selected subsets by k𝑘k. Details pertaining to matroid constraints and the reduction appear in Section 2.1 and 4.2, respectively. Here, we mention a specific allocation problem to highlight the relevance of studying φ𝜑\\varphi beyond the standard coverage and ℓℓ\\ell-coverage formulations (see Section 4.3 for details): in the Vehicle-Target Assignment problem   the resources are n𝑛n targets and covering a target j𝑗j times contributes φp​(j)=1−(1−p)jpsuperscript𝜑𝑝𝑗1superscript1𝑝𝑗𝑝\\varphi^{p}(j)=\\frac{1-(1-p)^{j}}{p} to the welfare; here, p∈(0,1)𝑝01p\\in(0,1) is a given parameter. Interestingly, we find that for this problem, the approximation ratio αφsubscript𝛼𝜑\\alpha_{\\varphi} we obtain can outperform the price of anarchy (PoA), which corresponds to the approximation ratio of any method whereing the agents selfishly maximize their utilities (see Section 4.3 for further discussion of this point). By contrast, in the resource allocation problem with φ​(j)=min⁡{j,ℓ}𝜑𝑗𝑗ℓ\\varphi(j)=\\min\\{j,\\ell\\}, the price of anarchy is equal to αφsubscript𝛼𝜑\\alpha_{\\varphi}; see  for details. Another allocation problem studied in  corresponds to φ𝜑\\varphi-MaxCoverage with φ​(j)=jd𝜑𝑗superscript𝑗𝑑\\varphi(j)=j^{d}, for a given parameter d∈(0,1)𝑑01d\\in(0,1). We refer to this instantiation as the d𝑑d-Power function. Theorem 1 gives us a tight approximation bound of αφsubscript𝛼𝜑\\alpha_{\\varphi} for all the above-mentioned applications of φ𝜑\\varphi-MaxCoverage. The values of αφsubscript𝛼𝜑\\alpha_{\\varphi} for these instantiations are listed in Table 1. It is relevant to compare the approximation guarantee, αφsubscript𝛼𝜑\\alpha_{\\varphi}, obtained in the current work with the approximation ratio based on the notion of curvature of submodular functions. Note that if φ𝜑\\varphi is nondecreasing and concave, then Cφsuperscript𝐶𝜑C^{\\varphi} is submodular. One can show, via a direct calculation, that for such a submodular Cφsuperscript𝐶𝜑C^{\\varphi} the curvature (as defined in ) is given by c=1−(φ​(m)−φ​(m−1))𝑐1𝜑𝑚𝜑𝑚1c=1-(\\varphi(m)-\\varphi(m-1)) for instances with at most m𝑚m cover sets; see Proposition A.4. Therefore, the algorithm of Sviridenko et al.  provides an approximation ratio of 1−c​e−11𝑐superscript𝑒11-ce^{-1} for the φ𝜑\\varphi-MaxCoverage problem. We note that the Poisson concavity ratio αφsubscript𝛼𝜑\\alpha_{\\varphi} is always greater than or equal to this curvature-dependent ratio (Proposition A.7). Specifically, for p𝑝p-Vehicle-Target Assignment, it is strictly better for all p∉{0,1}𝑝01p\\notin\\{0,1\\} and for ℓℓ\\ell-MultiCoverage, it is strictly better for all ℓ≥2ℓ2\\ell\\geq 2 as remarked in . Therefore, for the setting at hand, the current work improves the approximation guarantee obtained in . By Jensen’s inequality along with the nonnegativity and concavity of φ𝜑\\varphi, we have that αφ∈ subscript𝛼𝜑01\\alpha_{\\varphi}\\in . We show that αφsubscript𝛼𝜑\\alpha_{\\varphi} can be computed numerically up to any precision ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0, in time that is polynomial in 1ε1𝜀\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}. In fact, Proposition A.2 shows that αφ​(x)≥1−εsubscript𝛼𝜑𝑥1𝜀\\alpha_{\\varphi}(x)\\geq 1-\\varepsilon for all x≥Nε:=⌈(6ε)4⌉𝑥subscript𝑁𝜀assignsuperscript6𝜀4x\\geq N_{\\varepsilon}:=\\lceil\\left(\\frac{6}{\\varepsilon}\\right)^{4}\\rceil. Thus, we can iterate over all x∈{1,2,…,Nε}𝑥12…subscript𝑁𝜀x\\in\\{1,2,\\ldots,N_{\\varepsilon}\\} and find minx∈[Nε]⁡αφ​(x)subscript𝑥delimited-[]subscript𝑁𝜀subscript𝛼𝜑𝑥\\min_{x\\in[N_{\\varepsilon}]}\\alpha_{\\varphi}(x) up to ε𝜀\\varepsilon precision (under reasonable assumptions on φ𝜑\\varphi). This gives us a method to overall compute αφsubscript𝛼𝜑\\alpha_{\\varphi}, up to an absolute error of 2​ε2𝜀2\\varepsilon: if αφ≤1−εsubscript𝛼𝜑1𝜀\\alpha_{\\varphi}\\leq 1-\\varepsilon, then computing minx∈[Nε]⁡αφ​(x)subscript𝑥delimited-[]subscript𝑁𝜀subscript𝛼𝜑𝑥\\min_{x\\in[N_{\\varepsilon}]}\\alpha_{\\varphi}(x) (up to ε𝜀\\varepsilon precision) suffices. Otherwise, if αφ≥1−εsubscript𝛼𝜑1𝜀\\alpha_{\\varphi}\\geq 1-\\varepsilon, then αφ​(1)≤1subscript𝛼𝜑11\\alpha_{\\varphi}(1)\\leq 1 provides the desired bound.\nFurthermore, we note that Proposition A.1 shows that even if we consider αφ​(x)subscript𝛼𝜑𝑥\\alpha_{\\varphi}(x) over all x∈ℝ+𝑥subscriptℝx\\in\\mathbb{R}_{+}, an infimum (i.e., the value of αφsubscript𝛼𝜑\\alpha_{\\varphi}) is achieved at an integer. Theorem 1 shows that, under the assumption P≠NPPNP{\\rm P}\\not={\\rm NP}, no polynomial-time algorithm can approximate φ𝜑\\varphi-MaxCoverage within a better ratio than αφsubscript𝛼𝜑\\alpha_{\\varphi} for sublinear φ𝜑\\varphi. One natural question that arises is whether relaxing the running time constraint helps. More precisely, since there are (mk)=O​(mk)binomial𝑚𝑘𝑂superscript𝑚𝑘\\binom{m}{k}=O(m^{k}) choices of k𝑘k cover sets among the m𝑚m available, a simple exhaustive search algorithm works in time O​(mk)𝑂superscript𝑚𝑘O(m^{k}). We can ask if FPT algorithms with respect to k𝑘k, running in time f​(k)⋅mo​(k)⋅𝑓𝑘superscript𝑚𝑜𝑘f(k)\\cdot m^{o(k)} with f𝑓f an arbitrary function, can do better. As in , we use the result of  to show in Theorem 5 that such algorithms cannot approximate φ𝜑\\varphi-MaxCoverage within a better ratio than αφsubscript𝛼𝜑\\alpha_{\\varphi} for sublinear φ𝜑\\varphi, under the Gap-ETH hypothesis ; see Section 3.3 for more details. This means that the brute-force strategy is essentially the best, if one wants to get a better approximation ratio than αφsubscript𝛼𝜑\\alpha_{\\varphi}. In Section 2, we present our approximation algorithm for the φ𝜑\\varphi-MaxCoverage. The algorithm is an application of pipage rounding, a technique introduced in , on a linear programming relaxation of φ𝜑\\varphi-MaxCoverage. We show that the multilinear extension Fφsuperscript𝐹𝜑F^{\\varphi} of Cφsuperscript𝐶𝜑C^{\\varphi} is efficiently computable and thus, we can compute an integer solution xintsuperscript𝑥intx^{\\text{int}} from the optimal fractional one x∗superscript𝑥x^{*} satisfying Cφ​(xint)≥Fφ​(x∗)superscript𝐶𝜑superscript𝑥intsuperscript𝐹𝜑superscript𝑥C^{\\varphi}(x^{\\text{int}})\\geq F^{\\varphi}(x^{*}). Using the notion of convex order between distributions, we show that Fφ​(x∗)≥∑a∈[n]wa​𝔼​[φ​(Poi⁡(|x∗|a))]superscript𝐹𝜑superscript𝑥subscript𝑎delimited-[]𝑛subscript𝑤𝑎𝔼delimited-[]𝜑Poisubscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑎F^{\\varphi}(x^{*})\\geq\\sum_{a\\in[n]}w_{a}\\mathbb{E}[\\varphi(\\operatorname{\\text{Poi}}(|x^{*}|_{a}))], where |x|a=∑i∈[m]:a∈Tixisubscript𝑥𝑎subscript:𝑖delimited-[]𝑚𝑎subscript𝑇𝑖subscript𝑥𝑖|x|_{a}=\\sum_{i\\in[m]:a\\in T_{i}}x_{i}. Comparing this to the value ∑a∈[n]wa​φ​(|x∗|a)subscript𝑎delimited-[]𝑛subscript𝑤𝑎𝜑subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑎\\sum_{a\\in[n]}w_{a}\\varphi(|x^{*}|_{a}) taken by the linear program, we get a ratio given by the Poisson concavity ratio αφsubscript𝛼𝜑\\alpha_{\\varphi}. The concavity of φ𝜑\\varphi is crucial at several steps of the proof: it guarantees that the natural relaxation can be written as a linear program, it is used to relate between sums of Bernouilli random variables and a Poisson random variable via the convex order, as well as for the fact that we can restrict the infimum in the definition of αφsubscript𝛼𝜑\\alpha_{\\varphi} to integer values of x𝑥x. The generalization to matroid constraints follows in a standard way and is presented in Section 2.1. In Section 3, we present the hardness result for φ𝜑\\varphi-MaxCoverage. For this, we define a generalization of the partitioning gadget of Feige , extending also . Roughly speaking, for an integer xφ∈ℕsubscript𝑥𝜑ℕx_{\\varphi}\\in\\mathbb{N}, it is a collection of xφsubscript𝑥𝜑x_{\\varphi}-covers of the set [n]delimited-[]𝑛[n] (an x𝑥x-cover is a collection of subsets such that each element a∈[n]𝑎delimited-[]𝑛a\\in[n] is covered x𝑥x times, or in other words, its φ𝜑\\varphi-coverage is φ​(x)​n𝜑𝑥𝑛\\varphi(x)n) that are incompatible in the sense that if we take an element from each one of these xφsubscript𝑥𝜑x_{\\varphi}-covers, then the φ𝜑\\varphi-coverage is bounded approximately by 𝔼​[φ​(Poi⁡(xφ))]​n𝔼delimited-[]𝜑Poisubscript𝑥𝜑𝑛\\mathbb{E}[\\varphi(\\operatorname{\\text{Poi}}(x_{\\varphi}))]n. Then, we construct an instance of φ𝜑\\varphi-MaxCoverage from an instance of the NP-hard problem Label Cover (as in ) using such a gadget with xφ∈argminx∈ℕ​αφ​(x)subscript𝑥𝜑subscriptargmin𝑥ℕsubscript𝛼𝜑𝑥x_{\\varphi}\\in\\text{argmin}_{x\\in\\mathbb{N}}\\alpha_{\\varphi}(x). Having set up the partitioning gadget, the analysis of the reduction can be obtained by carefully generalizing the reductions of  and . In Section 4, we present different domains of application of our result.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: Given that multiwinner elections model multiple real-world settings (e.g., committee selection  and parliamentary proceedings [ref]6), instantiations of φ𝜑\\varphi-MaxCoverage in such social-choice contexts substantiate the applicability of our algorithmic result.
