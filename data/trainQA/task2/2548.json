      "content": "Paper Title: Pointwise Distance Distributions of periodic point sets\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis paper resolves the long-standing challenge of ambiguous data representation for periodic structures that model all solid crystalline materials (crystals).\nAny real crystal is best modeled as a periodic set S⊂ℝn𝑆superscriptℝ𝑛S\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{n} of points at all atomic centers, whose positions have a physical meaning and are determined via X-ray diffraction patterns.\nEdges between points are excluded because they only abstractly represent inter-atomic bonds that depend on thresholds for distances and angles . The simplest example is a lattice Λ⊂ℝnΛsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\Lambda\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{n} consisting of all integer linear combinations of a basis whose vectors span a unit cell U𝑈U, whose translational copies are shown in Fig. 1 only for convenience. Materials discovery still relies on trial-and-error because periodic crystals are traditionally represented by non-invariants (descriptors with false negatives) or discontinuous invariants such as symmetry groups that break down under tiny perturbations.\nThese conventional descriptions cannot identify fraudulent structures in experimental datasets that keep depositing numerous (near-)duplicates without reliable tools for justified comparisons .\nThe ambiguity challenge will be rigorously stated in Problem 1.1 as a classification of periodic sets up to isometry preserving the rigid form of crystals. Fig. 1 illustrates the first obstacle: the same lattice can be generated by infinitely many different bases or unit cells.\nSo distinguishing only lattices up to isometry is already non-trivial.\nThen any periodic point set S𝑆S is a sum Λ+M={u→+v→:u∈Λ,v∈M}Λ𝑀conditional-set→𝑢→𝑣formulae-sequence𝑢Λ𝑣𝑀\\Lambda+M=\\{\\vec{u}+\\vec{v}\\,:\\,u\\in\\Lambda,v\\in M\\}, where a motif M𝑀M is a finite set of points in the basis of U𝑈U.\nAny lattice ΛΛ\\Lambda is considered as a periodic set with a 1-point motif M={p}𝑀𝑝M=\\{p\\}.\nA single point p𝑝p can be arbitrarily chosen in a unit cell U𝑈U as in the first two pictures of Fig. 1.\nBasis vectors of U𝑈U and atomic coordinates of motif points (atomic centers) in M𝑀M form a conventional Crystallographic Information File (CIF).\nFig. 2 (left) shows the ambiguity of the CIF pair (Λ,M)Λ𝑀(\\Lambda,M) even if a basis of U𝑈U is fixed.\nThe recent work by Edelsbrunner et al  initiated a new research area in classifications of periodic point sets up to isometry.\nAn isometry of Euclidean space ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n} is any map that maintains inter-point distances.\nAny orientation-preserving isometry can be realized as a continuous rigid motion, for example any composition of translations and rotations in ℝ3superscriptℝ3\\mathbb{R}^{3}.\nThis equivalence is most natural for periodic point sets that represent real rigid structures. Crystals can be reliably distinguished up to isometry only by an isometry invariant that takes the same value on all isometric sets, hence having no false negatives.\nIf a descriptor allows false negatives, we can make no reliable conclusions because equivalent objects can have different representations as in Fig. 1 and 2 (left).\nHence, non-invariants such as edge-lengths and angles of a unit cell, or coordinates of motif points in a cell basis cannot be used to justifiably compare crystals .\nIt suffices to classify up to isometry including mirror reflections.\nAs a linear map, an isometry f𝑓f reverses orientation if the determinant det(v1,…,vn)subscript𝑣1…subscript𝑣𝑛\\det(v_{1},\\dots,v_{n}) of basis vectors has the same sign as det(f​(v1),…,f​(vn))𝑓subscript𝑣1…𝑓subscript𝑣𝑛\\det(f(v_{1}),\\dots,f(v_{n})). The traditional approach to identify a periodic crystal is to use its conventional or reduced cell [45, section 9.3].\nThis reduced cell has been known to be discontinuous under perturbations [ref]1 even for lattices when a motif M𝑀M is a single point.\nMore formally, [24, section 1] and [33, Theorem 15] proved that a continuous reduced cell cannot be defined for all lattices.\nFor more general periodic sets, discontinuity of many past discrete invariants such as symmetry groups becomes clearer in Fig. 2 (right) showing that even real-valued invariants struggle to continuously quantify the similarity between nearly sets.\nThe minimum volume of a cell U𝑈U can easily double, while the density (the number or mass of points divided by the cell volume) remains constant under perturbations of points. The continuous isometry classification of periodic sets has been an open problem since 1980 [ref]1. Find a function I𝐼I on all periodic sets of unlabeled points in ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n} such that (1.1a) invariance :\nif any periodic point sets S≅Q𝑆𝑄S\\cong Q are isometric in ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}, then I​(S)=I​(Q)𝐼𝑆𝐼𝑄I(S)=I(Q), so the invariant I𝐼I has no false negatives; (1.1b)\ncompleteness :\nif I​(S)=I​(Q)𝐼𝑆𝐼𝑄I(S)=I(Q) for any periodic point sets S,Q𝑆𝑄S,Q, then S≅Q𝑆𝑄S\\cong Q are isometric, so the invariant I𝐼I has no false positives; (1.1c) metric :\na distance d𝑑d between values of I𝐼I satisfies all axioms;\n1) d​(I1,I2)=0𝑑subscript𝐼1subscript𝐼20d(I_{1},I_{2})=0 if and only if I1=I2subscript𝐼1subscript𝐼2I_{1}=I_{2}, 2) symmetry d​(I1,I2)=d​(I2,I1)𝑑subscript𝐼1subscript𝐼2𝑑subscript𝐼2subscript𝐼1d(I_{1},I_{2})=d(I_{2},I_{1}), 3) triangle inequality\nd​(I1,I3)≤d​(I1,I2)+d​(I2,I3)𝑑subscript𝐼1subscript𝐼3𝑑subscript𝐼1subscript𝐼2𝑑subscript𝐼2subscript𝐼3d(I_{1},I_{3})\\leq d(I_{1},I_{2})+d(I_{2},I_{3}); (1.1d) continuity :\nif Q𝑄Q is obtained from a periodic set S⊂ℝn𝑆superscriptℝ𝑛S\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{n} by shifting each point of S𝑆S by at most ε𝜀\\varepsilon, then d​(I​(S),I​(Q))≤C​ε𝑑𝐼𝑆𝐼𝑄𝐶𝜀d(I(S),I(Q))\\leq C\\varepsilon for a fixed constant C𝐶C and any such periodic point sets S,Q⊂ℝn𝑆𝑄superscriptℝ𝑛S,Q\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{n}; (1.1e)\ncomputability : the invariant I𝐼I, the metric d𝑑d and verification of I​(S)=I​(Q)𝐼𝑆𝐼𝑄I(S)=I(Q) should be computed in a near-linear time in the number of motif points of periodic sets for a fixed dimension n𝑛n; (1.1f)\ninverse design : any periodic point set S⊂ℝn𝑆superscriptℝ𝑛S\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{n} can be reconstructed from its invariant I​(S)𝐼𝑆I(S).\n ■■\\blacksquare Problem 1.1 is the ultimate Data Science challenge for all periodic crystals S𝑆S whose non-invariant input (a cell basis and a motif) should be transformed into a complete invariant I​(S)𝐼𝑆I(S), which uniquely and unambiguously represents any S𝑆S.\nSuch a complete invariant can be considered as a materials genome  or a DNA-type code that also allows an explicit reconstruction for any periodic crystal. For example, Computer Vision tries to identify humans and other objects such as road signs by using pixel-based images as input.\nSimilar to other real objects, any periodic crystal can be given by (infinitely) many inputs.\nProblem 1.1 is an example of the data ambiguity challenge for almost any application that needs to uniquely identify a real object.\nBiology has partially solved this challenge by a DNA code, though a living creature cannot be easily created from a given code.\nCondition (1.1f) goes further and requires a full reconstruction of a periodic crystal S𝑆S from its DNA-style code I​(S)𝐼𝑆I(S). The proposed solution to Problem 1.1 is the isometry invariant I𝐼I called the Pointwise Distance Distribution PDDPDD\\mathrm{PDD}.\nTheorems 3.2, 4.3, 5.1 , 4.4 prove that PDDPDD\\mathrm{PDD} satisfies all conditions of Problem 1.1, even (1.1b) at least for generic sets.\nMore exactly, Theorem 4.4 shows that\nany periodic point set S⊂ℝn𝑆superscriptℝ𝑛S\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{n} in general position can be explicitly reconstructed from PDD and lattice invariants. The strength of PDDPDD\\mathrm{PDD} was experimentally checked for all 660K+ periodic crystals in the world’s largest Cambridge Structural Database (CSD).\nDespite the CSD being curated to contain only real and distinct structures , the new invariants identified several pairs of duplicates.\nAll the underlying publications are now being investigated for data integrity by five journals, see details in section 6. Problem 1.1 is stated in the hardest scenario when points are unordered and unlabeled because many real crystals have identical compositions.\nFor example, diamond and graphite (whose 2-dimensional layer is famous graphene) consist of pure carbon but have vastly different physical properties. Conditions (1.1cd) for a continuous metric are stronger than a complete classification in (1.1ab):\ndetecting an isometry gives a discontinuous metric d​(S,Q)=1𝑑𝑆𝑄1d(S,Q)=1 (or another positive number) for all non-isometric S≇Q𝑆𝑄S\\not\\cong Q even if S,Q𝑆𝑄S,Q are near duplicates as in Fig. 2 (right).\nContinuity under perturbations is practically important because atoms vibrate, and any real measurement of a crystal produces slightly different coordinates of its unit cell and motif.\nAny simulation of periodic structures introduces floating point errors because of inevitable approximations by iterative optimization. Thousands of near-duplicates are routinely produced, though only a few structures are synthesized.\nFive real structures of 5679 predicted on a supercomputer over 12 weeks are a typical example .\nThis ‘embarrassment of over-prediction’ wastes resources and time to run simulations and then analyze results, often by visual inspection, because there were no invariants that resolve Problem 1.1. Computability condition (1.1e) avoids the trivial function I​(S)=S𝐼𝑆𝑆I(S)=S in Problem 1.1.\nInverse design in (1.1f) allows one to replace the traditional blind sampling (of ambiguous cells and motifs leading to (near-)duplicates via optimization) with a guided exploration of the crystal space parameterized by complete and reversible invariants.\nSection 2 shows that the state-of-the-art tools remain stuck with conditions (1.1ab) while the new invariants satisfy the stronger practical requirements (1.1cdef).\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: The traditional approach to identify a periodic crystal is to use its conventional or reduced cell [45, section 9.3].\nThis reduced cell has been known to be discontinuous under perturbations [ref]1 even for lattices when a motif M𝑀M is a single point.\nMore formally, [24, section 1] and [33, Theorem 15] proved that a continuous reduced cell cannot be defined for all lattices.\nFor more\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
