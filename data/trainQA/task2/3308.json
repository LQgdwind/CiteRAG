      "content": "Paper Title: Multi-task Pre-training Language Model for Semantic Network Completion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe benchmark the link prediction tasks using proposed methods and competitive approaches, including both the translational distance-based approaches and semantic matching-based methods. For the translational distance models, 18 widely-used solutions are tested in our experiments, including TransE , DistMult , ComplEx , R-GCN , ConvE , KBAT [ref]24, QuatE , RotatE , TuckER , AttH [ref]29, DensE , Rot-Pro , QuatDE , LineaRE , CapsE 4, RESCAL-DURA 5 and HAKE . As expected, only a few previous attempts employed semantic-matching-based methods, due to the difficulties of the training. Here, KG-BERT  and StAR [ref]9 are used for the quantitative comparison. The detailed results are shown in Table II. As can be observed from the Table, the LB-BERT is able to achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance on all three widely used datasets, including WN18RR, FB15k-237 and UMLS dataset. The improvement is especially significant in terms of Hits@10 and Hits@3 due to the superior generalization performance of multi-task pre-training textual encoding approach, which will be further analyzed in the section below. Furthermore, LP-BERT surpasses all other methods by a large margin in terms of Hits@3, Hits@10 on WN18RR and Hits@10 on UMLS. Although it only achieves inferior performance on FB15k-237 dataset and Hits@1 and MRR of WN18RR dataset compared to translational distance models, it still remarkably outperforms other semantic matching models such as KG-BERT and StAR from the same genre by introducing structured knowledge. In particular, LB-BERT outperforms StAR [ref]9, which is the previous state-of-the-art model, on all three datasets with only one-third parameters numbers of it. For the WN18RR datasets, the Hits@1 is increased from 0.243 to 0.343, Hits@3 is increased to 0.563 from 0.491. The experimental results show that the semantic matching models perform well in the topK recall evaluation methods, but the Hits@1 result is significantly inferior to the translation distance models. This is because that the features of the semantic matching models are based on text, which leads to the vector representation of similar entities in the text being close and difficult to distinguish. Although translation distance models perform well on the Hits@1, they are incapable of understanding the text semantics. For new entities not seen in the training set, the prediction results of translation distance models are random, while the semantic matching models are reliable, which is why Hits@3 and Hits@10 LP-BERT can far exceed the translation distance models to achieve state-of-art performance. Similar to KG-BERT and StAR, our model is relied BERT and we compare LP-BERT with KG-BERT and StAR on WN18RR in detail, including different initialization manners. As shown in Table III, LP-BERT consistently achieves superior performance over most metrics. The evaluation effect of the LB-BERT model based on RoBERTa-base has exceeded the evaluation effect of KG-BERT and StAR based on RoBERTa-large. As for empirical efficiency, due to the small number of model parameters and the strategy of negative sampling based on the batch in the training process, our model is faster than KG-BERT and StAR for both the training and inference phases.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: and semantic matching-based methods.
