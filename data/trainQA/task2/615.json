      "content": "Paper Title: Equivalence-Invariant Algebraic Provenance for Hyperplane Update Queries\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe tracking of provenance for database queries has been\nextensively studied in the past years (see e.g.\n [ref]23  [ref]5). In\na nutshell, data provenance captures details of the computation that\ntook place and resulted in the generation of each output data item.\nMultiple models for data provenance have been proposed, for multiple\nquery languages such as the (positive) relational algebra, datalog\n(see [ref]23), data-intensive workflows (e.g.,\n ) data mining , and\ndata-centric applications . Provenance has been proven\nuseful for managing access control, trust, hypothetical reasoning,\nview maintenance and debugging (see\n   [ref]23 ). The approach advocated by [ref]23 is based on designing\nalgebraic provenance structures whose equivalence axioms\nare based on equivalences in the formalism for which provenance is designed to be tracked.\nThis guarantees that by design, equivalent queries/programs in the formalism of interest will\nhave equivalent provenance for their output. In a sense, this means that provenance captures the\n“essence of computation” that has been performed. The commutative semiring model of [ref]23 achieves this property\nfor the positive relational algebra; several extensions have been studied [ref]5   for different query languages. In this paper we focus on a fragment of update queries and sequences thereof (which we refer to as “transactions”),\nand propose a novel algebraic provenance model. The fragment of update queries that we focus on\nis that of hyperplane queries, introduced in  as simple yet important building blocks of transactions. Hyperplane queries are intuitively “domain-based”, in that selection of tuples in each query only involves the inspection of individual attribute values for each tuple. As demonstrated in  , this fragment of transactions facilitates appealing theoretical features, while allowing to express transactions of interest. Specifically, for this fragment,  has shown a sound and complete axiomatization, which is crucial for our provenance model as we next explain. The provenance annotations in our model are initially\nassigned to both queries and tuples; those assigned to queries are propagated to the tuples that these queries affect, so that the result of applying\nan annotated transaction is an annotated database. Then, in a similar vein to the commutative semiring model mimicking the\nequivalence axioms of positive relational algebra, our model is based on the sound and complete axiomatization\nfor set equivalence of transactions in . Namely, we start with a most generic structure that uses abstract operations\nto capture the effect of each type of update query, and then introduce, for each of the axioms in ,\na corresponding axiom in our algebraic structure. As we will show, this leads to a provenance framework that has the following\nfavourable property: two transactions are “provenance-equivalent”, i.e., their application on every input database yields the same annotated database, if and only if they are set-equivalent.\nThis means that provenance in our framework is independent of the particular way that the transaction is executed and of any optimizations that may take place. To our knowledge, ours is the first provenance model to satisfy this property for transactions (see discussion of previously proposed models in Sections 3.3 and 7). Details of our provenance model appear in Section 3. By propagating annotations that are assigned to both queries and tuples, we are able to support multiple applications of interest, which we overview in Section 4. For instance, analysts may use the resulting provenance to conduct hypothetical reasoning with respect to both the database and transaction. Namely, by assigning truth values to tuple and/or query annotations in the resulting provenance expressions, they may observe the effect of deleting a tuple or aborting a transaction, on the computation result. Additional examples include the support of access control, where each tuple/query is associated with access credentials and these are propagated so that we compute access credentials for each output tuple; and a “certification” example, where we assign trust level to each tuple/query and correspondingly produce certifications to output tuples we trust. As is the case with previous algebraic provenance constructions, the idea is that we may first compute an expression in the “most general” structure (detailed in Section 3), and then upon request “specialize” (map) it to any application domains such as those we have just exemplified. Further, while our generic structure is quite complex, we\nprovide a “prescription” for building instances of it. This is\nachieved by establishing a connection with the commutative semiring\nmodel: we show that\nfor a simple-to-define class of commutative semirings (see Theorem 4.5 for details),\ntheir operators can be easily extended to define operators for our model that do satisfy the axioms. We then (Section 5) turn to the problem of efficient provenance generation and\nstorage, for the “most general” structure. The model definition already entails an algorithm for\nprovenance generation, but we show that it may lead to an\nexponential blowup of the provenance size with respect to the\ntransaction length (number of queries). We show that this blowup may\nbe avoided, leveraging our axioms: we derive algebraic simplification rules that are entailed by the axioms, and consequently propose a “normal form” structure for provenance. We show that every provenance expression obtained by applying a\nsequence of hyperplane updates may be transformed to this structure.\nThe expressions that we obtain in this structure are far more\ncompact: they are in fact linear in the size of the transaction and\ninput database. Furthermore, we show that we can generate\nexpressions in this structure on-the-fly during query evaluation,\navoiding a detour through the exponentially large representation. Finally, we present (Section 6) an experimental study of our framework using the\nTPC benchmark as well as a synthetic dataset. The experiments focus on the time\nand space overheads incur by provenance tracking, and on the time it takes to “specialize” provenance once it is computed, i.e., assign values to variables and thereby use it in applications such as described above. Our measurements are performed for implementations with and without the normal form optimization.\nOur results show that our rewrite of provenance\ninto its normal form (made possible due to our axioms) significantly reduces the provenance size, and may be efficiently performed alongside with provenance generation. Thereby, it also significantly benefits provenance applications, accelerating provenance use (assignment of values).\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: The tracking of provenance for database queries has been\nextensively studied in the past years (see e.g.\n [ref]23  [ref]5).
