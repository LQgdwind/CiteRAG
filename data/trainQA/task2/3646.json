      "content": "Paper Title: CP2: Copy-Paste Contrastive Pretraining for Semantic Segmentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOur MoCo v2 implementation follows the official open source code [ref]12, and our semantic segmentation implementation uses the MMSegmentation  library. Datasets. We pretrain CP2 and the baselines on ImageNet [ref]17 (∼similar-to\\sim1.28 million training images) and finetune on semantic segmentation tasks of PASCAL VOC , Cityscapes , and ADE20k . For PASCAL VOC, we train on the augmented training set  with 10582 images and evaluate on VOC2012 validation set. For Cityscapes, we train on the “train-fine” set with 2975 images and evaluate on its validation set. For ADE20k, we train on the training set with 20210 images and evaluate on the validation set. Segmentation and projection heads. Our DeepLab v3 ASPP head follows the default setting in MMSegmentation which uses 512 output channels for both the atrous convolutions and the output projection. Our CP2 projection head consists of two layers of 512-channel 1×\\times1 convolutions, ReLU, and a C=128𝐶128C=128 channel 1×\\times1 convolution. For the FCN head, we follow the settings in prior works  [ref]30 for fair comparison, i.e., two layers of 256-channel 3×\\times3 convolutions with atrous rate==6 followed by BN and ReLU. The CP2 projection for the FCN-based model consists of two layers of 256-channel 1×\\times1 convolutions, ReLU, and a C=128𝐶128C=128 channel 1×\\times1 convolution. Baselines. We compare CP2 with the self-supervised contrastive learning methods with classification-oriented  [ref]12   , detection-oriented  [ref]30, and dense prediction  objectives. All the pretrained ResNet-50 models of are downloaded from their official implementations.\nFor InsLoc , we use the backbone of its ResNet50-FPN model which has been pretrained for 400 epochs. For DetCon [ref]30, we use the model pretrained 1000 epochs with DetCon-B manner for the most competitive baseline. The pretrained ViT-S model of MoCo v2 is borrowed from DINO . Moreover, to compare with supervised methods, we load a pretrained ResNet-50 model in torchvision official model zoo, which has a top-1 accuracy of 76.13% on ImageNet validation set [ref]17. Hyper-parameters. For ResNet-backed models, we pretrain by SGD optimizer with 0.03 learning rate, 0.9 momentum, 0.0001 weight decay, and a mini-batch size of 256 on ImageNet. We finetune them by SGD with 0.9 momuntum, 0.0005 weight decay, and 0.003, 0.01, 0.01 learning rate for PASCAL, Cityscapes, and ADE20k, respectively. For ViT-backed models, we also pretrain with a mini-batch size of 256 on ImageNet but apply an AdamW  optimizer with β1=0.9subscript𝛽10.9\\beta_{1}=0.9, β2=0.999subscript𝛽20.999\\beta_{2}=0.999, 0.00005 learning rate, 0.01 weight decay for both pretraining and finetuning. We pretrain and finetune with 4 GPUs. We find that for CP2 pretrained models, the use of weight decay in finetuning stage usually leads to ∼similar-to\\sim0.2% mIoU decrease. This is possibly because for the baseline methods, the segmentation head is randomly initialized in finetuning and relies on weight decay for better generalization. However, as CP2 pretrains both the backbone and segmentation head with a proper weight decay, the ewights of segmentation head have been decayed into a lower scale and do not require further decaying during finetuning. Thus, in the finetuning stage, we use weight decay for those baseline models with random segmentation head and turn off weight decay for CP2 models. We adopt a memory bank of N=65536𝑁65536N=65536, C=128𝐶128C=128 dimensional vectors, with 𝒌+subscript𝒌\\bm{k_{+}}, the normalized masked average representation of image Iksubscript𝐼𝑘I_{k} in the current mini-batch enqueued and the oldest vectors dequeued. For instance contrastive loss ℒi​n​ssubscriptℒ𝑖𝑛𝑠\\mathcal{L}_{ins}, we set the temperature τi​n​s=0.2subscript𝜏𝑖𝑛𝑠0.2\\tau_{ins}=0.2 in accordance with MoCo v2 [ref]12. We assign a weight of α=0.2𝛼0.2\\alpha=0.2 and set the temperature τd​e​n​s​e=1subscript𝜏𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒1\\tau_{dense}=1 for ℒd​e​n​s​esubscriptℒ𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒\\mathcal{L}_{dense}, according to grid search. For PASCAL VOC, we use crop size 512×\\times512 and train with batch size 16 for 40k iterations. For Cityscapes, we use crop size 512×\\times1024 and train with batch size 8 for 60k iterations. For ADE20k, we use crop size 512×\\times512 and train with batch size 16 for 80k iterations.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: Our MoCo v2 implementation follows the official open source code [ref]12, and our semantic segmentation implementation uses the MMSegmentation  library.
