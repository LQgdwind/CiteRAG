Once trained the interpolation network Ni​n​tsubscript𝑁𝑖𝑛𝑡N_{int} provides an approximation of the RHS function f𝑓f on its domain, that is Ni​n​t​(t,x)≈f​(t,x)subscript𝑁𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑡𝑥𝑓𝑡𝑥N_{int}(t,x)\\approx f(t,x). The data used by the interpolation network are couples (Xh,Yh),h=j+(i−1)​M=1,…,K​Mformulae-sequencesubscript𝑋ℎsubscript𝑌ℎℎ𝑗𝑖1𝑀1…𝐾𝑀(X_{h},Y_{h}),\\;h=j+(i-1)M=1,\\dots,KM, where Xhsubscript𝑋ℎX_{h} is the input and Yhsubscript𝑌ℎY_{h} is the target and Xhsubscript𝑋ℎX_{h}, Yhsubscript𝑌ℎY_{h} are defined as follows: The data is separated into training and testing sets made respectively of 80% and 20% of the data. A representation of the data for the interpolation network is provided in Figure 3. The interpolation network is feed forward neural network with L𝐿L layers and Leaky ReLU activation function. We apply the network to each training input Xhsubscript𝑋ℎX_{h} and we aim to find the best network parameters to match the corresponding Yhsubscript𝑌ℎY_{h}.\nFor i=1,…,L𝑖1…𝐿i=1,\\dots,L define the weight matrices Wi​n​ti∈ℝni×ni−1superscriptsubscript𝑊𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑖superscriptℝsubscript𝑛𝑖subscript𝑛𝑖1W_{int}^{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{\\;n_{i}\\times n_{i-1}} and bias vectors bi​n​ti∈ℝnisuperscriptsubscript𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑖superscriptℝsubscript𝑛𝑖b_{int}^{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n_{i}} where ni∈ℕ,n0=1+d,nL=dformulae-sequencesubscript𝑛𝑖ℕformulae-sequencesubscript𝑛01𝑑subscript𝑛𝐿𝑑n_{i}\\in\\mathbb{N},n_{0}=1+d,n_{L}=d. Let θi​n​t={Wi​n​t,bi​n​t}subscript𝜃𝑖𝑛𝑡subscript𝑊𝑖𝑛𝑡subscript𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑡\\theta_{int}=\\{W_{int},b_{int}\\} be the model parameters.\nFor an input Xh∈ℝ1+dsubscript𝑋ℎsuperscriptℝ1𝑑X_{h}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{1+d} and parameters θ𝜃\\theta we have: The loss function minimized to train the interpolation network contains two terms. The first one is the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the network output and the target data: this forces the network predictions to be close to the observed data. The second term is a a Lipschitz regularization term which forces the Lipschitz constant of the network Ni​n​tsubscript𝑁𝑖𝑛𝑡N_{int} to be small. In contrast with the most common choices of regularization terms found in Machine Learning literature, we don’t impose an explicit regularization on the network parameters, but we impose a Lipschitz regularization on the statistical geometric mapping properties of the network. More details about this regularization term can be found in our paper .\nSpecifically, the loss function has the form: where ∥⋅∥2\\|\\cdot\\|_{2} is the L2superscript𝐿2L^{2} norm, α>0𝛼0\\alpha>0 is a regularization parameter and Lip​(Ni​n​t)Lipsubscript𝑁𝑖𝑛𝑡\\text{Lip}(N_{int}) is the Lipschitz constant of the network Ni​n​tsubscript𝑁𝑖𝑛𝑡N_{int}. The predicted approximation of the function f​(t,x)𝑓𝑡𝑥f(t,x) is given by the network Ni​n​tsubscript𝑁𝑖𝑛𝑡N_{int} corresponding to argminθi​n​t​L​(θi​n​t)subscript𝜃𝑖𝑛𝑡argmin𝐿subscript𝜃𝑖𝑛𝑡\\underset{\\theta_{int}}{\\mathrm{argmin}}\\,L(\\theta_{int}).\nThe Lipschitz constant of the network Ni​n​tsubscript𝑁𝑖𝑛𝑡N_{int}, Lip​(Ni​n​t)Lipsubscript𝑁𝑖𝑛𝑡\\text{Lip}(N_{int}), is computed as: where the gradient of the network with respect to the input Xhsubscript𝑋ℎX_{h} is computed exactly using autograd [ref]21.\nWe note that controlling the Lipschitz constant of the network Ni​n​tsubscript𝑁𝑖𝑛𝑡N_{int} yields control on the smoothness and rate of change of the approximating function. In the examples we approximate the Lipschitz constant of the interpolation network using an approach similar to the one exposed in : a finite set S𝑆S of points is selected randomly in the domain of f𝑓f where the data was generated; then, the Lipschitz norm of the network is estimated as the infinity norm of the gradient of Ni​n​tsubscript𝑁𝑖𝑛𝑡N_{int} evaluated on S𝑆S.\nThe approximation of the derivative of the network Ni​n​tsubscript𝑁𝑖𝑛𝑡N_{int} with respect to its inputs is computed in Python using autograd [ref]21.\nNote that, as empirically shown in , the larger the cardinality of the set S𝑆S, the better the approximation of the Lipschitz constant. In our experiments, we set the cardinality of S𝑆S to be 1000. For ease of notation, in the rest of the paper we will drop the explicit dependence of the networks from their learnable parameters and we will only write Nj​(Xij)subscript𝑁𝑗superscriptsubscript𝑋𝑖𝑗N_{j}(X_{i}^{j}) and Ni​n​t​(Xh)subscript𝑁𝑖𝑛𝑡subscript𝑋ℎN_{int}(X_{h}).\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: Lip​(Ni​n​t)Lipsubscript𝑁𝑖𝑛𝑡\\text{Lip}(N_{int}), is computed as: where the gradient of the network with respect to the input Xhsubscript𝑋ℎX_{h} is computed exactly using autograd [ref]21.\nWe note that controlling the Lipschitz constant of the network Ni​n​tsubscript𝑁𝑖𝑛𝑡N_{int} yields control on the smoothness and rate of change of the approximating function.
