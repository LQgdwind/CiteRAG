      "content": "Paper Title: FP6-LLM: Efficiently Serving Large Language Models Through FP6-Centric Algorithm-System Co-Design\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) [ref]1 8 2    are renowned for their capacity to process diverse language-related tasks    7.\nHowever, it is challenging to deploy LLMs as these models are also characterized by their expansive size, e.g., 175 billion parameter GPT-3 [ref]1 and 1.76 trillion parameter GPT-4 8.\nOn one hand, it requires large amounts of GPU memory (326 GB for GPT-3 in FP16) only to accommodate model weights, whereas an A100/H100 GPU 0 1 only has up to 80 GB memory.\nOn the other hand, LLM inference faces severe \"memory wall\" issues   during token generation, where the speed of LLM inference is mainly limited by the time reading model weights from GPU DRAM.\nIt makes LLM inference memory bounded, under-utilizing the computational power of GPUs. Model quantization       2 reduces both GPU memory footprint and DRAM data access.\nIt uses fewer bits to represent each model weight, resulting in a more compact representation of the model.\nHowever, only a small set of bit-widths (i.e. 4-bit and 8-bit) are efficiently supported in existing systems 6    on modern GPUs.\nRecent studies show that 6-bit quantization is a good trade-off between inference cost and model quality for LLM deployment 5 .\nHowever, there is still no efficient system support for the 6-bit linear layer execution (i.e., matrix multiplication) on modern GPUs.\nIt is urgent to develop the system support for 6-bit quantization fully leveraging the computing power of GPUs. On one hand, more efficient LLM inference can be achieved with 6-bit quantization compared to larger-bit quantization (e.g., 8-bit).\nFirstly, more GPU memory can be saved, e.g. around 40 GB memory can be saved if deploying the GPT-3 model with 6-bit rather than 8-bit quantization.\nSecondly, LLM inference can be further accelerated as the time of reading model weights from GPU DRAM can be effectively reduced.\nAs shown in Figure 1, the linear layer implemented with our newly proposed 6-bit quantization system design (TC-FPx_W6A16) is constantly faster (up to 1.45×1.45\\times) than the state-of-the-art support for 8-bit quantization (TensorRT_LLM_W8A16).\nOn the other hand, 6-bit quantization can more effectively preserve model quality compared to smaller-bit quantization (e.g., 4-bit).\nDespite the potential shown by recent 4-bit techniques  9 in compressing LLMs with minimal quality loss, they are predominantly geared towards zero-shot evaluations.\nRecent research 5 demonstrates that in tasks extending beyond zero-shot measurements, such as code generation and summarization, 4-bit methods underperform and lack robustness, whereas 6-bit quantization displays strong and consistent performance across these varied applications. Motivated by the above observations, we propose TC-FPx, the first full-stack GPU system design scheme with unified Tensor Core 0 1 support of float-point weights for various quantization bit-width (6-bit, 5-bit, 3-bit, etc.), mitigating the \"memory wall\" issues during LLM inference.\nTC-FPx breaks the limitations of the underlying GPU hardware, allowing the GPU to support linear layer calculations involving model weights of arbitrary bit width.\nIn TC-FPx, Tensor Cores are utilized for intensive computation of matrix multiplications, while SIMT cores are effectively leveraged for weight de-quantization, transforming the x-bit model weights to FP16 type during runtime before feeding them to Tensor Cores.\nWe propose Ahead-of-time Bit-level Pre-packing (Section 5.2) to resolve the challenge of unfriendly memory access for weights with irregular bit-width (Section 4.2.1), enabling optimal GPU memory access.\nBesides, we propose SIMT-Efficient GPU Runtime (Section 5.3) to minimize the runtime overhead of weight de-quantization (Section 4.2.2).\nLast but not least, we present the software pipeline of TC-FPx kernel, where SIMT cores, Tensor Cores, and the GPU memory hierarchy cooperate efficiently with high performance. We integrate TC-FPx kernel into a state-of-the-art inference system , providing new end-to-end support (called FP6-LLM) for quantized LLM inference, where better trade-offs between inference cost and model quality are achieved.\nCurrently, FP6-LLM mainly supports 6-bit quantization (FP6) for popular LLMs such as LLaMA 2, OPT  with various sizes.\nEvaluations show that FP6-LLM enables the inference of LLaMA-70b using only a single GPU, achieving 1.69×1.69\\times-2.65×2.65\\times higher normalized inference throughput than the FP16 baseline.\nBesides, FP6-LLM improves the inference throughput of OPT-30b by 1.72×1.72\\times-4.05×4.05\\times. In summary, we make the following contributions: We identify the significance and key challenges in supporting FP6 quantization on modern GPUs. We propose TC-FPx, the first full-stack GPU kernel design scheme with unified Tensor Core support of float-point weights with various bit-width, e.g. FP6. We provide new end-to-end inference support for quantized LLMs through the integration of TC-FPx, achieving better trade-offs between inference cost and model quality. We evaluate FP6-LLM on various LLM models and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms the baseline.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Large Language Models (LLMs) [ref]1 8 2    are renowned for their capacity to process diverse language-related tasks    7.\nHowever, it is challenging to deploy LLMs as these models are also characterized by their expansive size,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
