      "content": "Paper Title: Synthesizing Tight Privacy and Accuracy Bounds via Weighted Model Counting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are a number of related works on differential privacy verification. In [ref]21 , Liu et. al provide a probabilistic model checking approach for exactly solving the differential privacy verification problem. We provide a comparison with this approach in Section 6. Other works which are closely related to ours are works on finding counterexamples to differential privacy or tightening bounds. In , Ding et. al develop a statistical procedure for finding a candidate counterexample to differential privacy in probabilistic algorithms. In , Wang et. al develop a program analysis tool for finding counterexamples or proofs of validation of privacy in implementations of DP algorithms. In [ref]12, Bichsel et. al use a sampling approach to find counterexamples to differential privacy. In , Zhang et. al use interpreters to find counterexamples to differential privacy. There is significant work on developing type systems and program logics for differential privacy algorithms. This work begins with  in which Reed et. al develop a type system for differential privacy. Following this, [ref]30     present other type systems and program logics for differential privacy. There is a related line of work which develops and implements a hoare logic approach and uses probabilistic couplings to mechanize proofs of differential privacy via the apRHL logic and EasyCrypt     . In , Albarghouthi et. al propose a technique to automate these proofs. In , Barthe et. al develop a probabilistic programming framework which uses inference for writing verifiable DP programs. There are also works on program synthesis for DP programs   . Our techniques could be used in these synthesis approaches for verifying intermediate programs, and as a more exact method of ensuring high accuracy while satisfying DP properties. In a more theoretical approach, Gaboardi et. al  find complexity bounds for exact verification of DP in non-looping programs. In follow-up work to this, Bun et. al  extend this analysis to looping programs. Privacy auditing provides empirical methods to estimate the privacy leakage of an ML algorithm by mounting privacy attacks. Privacy auditing can be performed with membership inference attacks  or data poisoning  , but initial techniques developed for auditing require training thousands of ML models to provide confidence intervals for the estimated lower bound on the privacy parameter. Recent techniques showed how to rigorously perform estimation of the privacy parameter while using multiple randomized canaries  and eventually training a single ML model  . To our knowledge, there is very little work on theoretical or applied formal verification or bound synthesis for accuracy of DP algorithms. In , Barthe et. al provide theoretical analysis on the decidability of accuracy different classes of probabilistic computations. In , Lobo-Vesga et. al develop a programming framework for estimating accuracy bounds.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: There are a number of related works on differential privacy verification.
