      "content": "Paper Title: giotto-ph: A Python Library for High-Performance Computation of Persistent Homology of Vietoris–Rips Filtrations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, persistent homology (PH) (see e.g.    [ref]34 [ref]11    for surveys) has been a key driving force behind the ever-increasing adoption of topological approaches in a wide variety of computational contexts, such as geometric inference  , signal processing 0 , data visualization , and, more generally, data analysis   and machine learning .111As a matter of fact, insights from the theory of persistent homology and persistence modules have also proved helpful in pure mathematics, e.g., in symplectic topology/geometry . Among the main invariants described by this theory, the (persistence) barcode      8 has attracted the most attention due to a) its ability to track the appearance and disappearance of topological features in data throughout entire ranges of parameters, b) its succinct nature and ease of representation, as it simply consists of a (typically small) collection of intervals of the real line, c) its provable robustness under perturbations of the input data  , and d) its amenability to computation and algorithmic optimization, as demonstrated by the large number of existing implementations – see Sect. 1 in  for a review, and  6 for recent entries not mentioned there. Despite these successes, the computation of barcodes remains a challenge when dealing with large datasets and/or with high-dimensional222In this paper, we use the word “dimension” as a synonym for “degree” when describing homology classes and therefore bars in a persistence barcode. topological features. We now explain why this is the case. The input to any barcode computation is a growing, one-parameter family of combinatorial objects, called a filtration or a filtered complex. Filtrations consist of cells with assigned integer dimensions and values of the filtration-defining parameter, as well as boundary (resp. co-boundary) relations (mappings) between k𝑘k-dimensional cells and (k−1𝑘1k-1)-dimensional [resp. (k+1𝑘1k+1)-dimensional] ones.333We refer the reader to any of the aforementioned surveys of PH for rigorous definitions. Arguably, the most common examples of filtrations in applications concern simplicial complexes, in which case the cells are referred to as simplices, and k𝑘k-dimensional simplices consist of sets of k+1𝑘1k+1 points from a common vertex set V𝑉V – for instance, a 00-simplex {v}𝑣\\{v\\} is one of the vertices v∈V𝑣𝑉v\\in V, while a 111-simplex {v,w}⊆V𝑣𝑤𝑉\\{v,w\\}\\subseteq V can be thought of as an edge connecting vertices v𝑣v and w𝑤w. These are the filtrations of interest in the present paper. In particular, we focus on the Vietoris–Rips (VR) (resp. flag) filtration of a finite metric space (resp. undirected graph with vertex and edge weights), in which simplices are arbitrary subsets of the available points (resp. vertices) and their filtration values are set to be their diameters (resp. the maximum weights of all vertices and edges they contain, with absent edges being given infinite filtration value). Several simplicial filtrations of interest in applications, and the VR filtration chiefly among these, quickly become very large as their defining parameter increases (and hence more and more simplices are included in the growing complex). At the heart of all algorithms for computing PH barcodes lies the reduction of boundary or co-boundary matrices indexed by the full set of simplices in the filtration; the available reduction algorithms have asymptotic space and time complexities which are polynomial in the total number N𝑁N of simplices. In the case of the VR filtration of an input metric space ℳℳ\\mathcal{M}, if one is interested in computing the barcode up to and including homology dimension D𝐷D, then N=∑k=0D+1(|M|k)𝑁superscriptsubscript𝑘0𝐷1binomial𝑀𝑘N=\\sum_{k=0}^{D+1}\\binom{|M|}{k}. For sizeable datasets, this combinatorial explosion leads to a staggering number of elementary row or column operations (as well as memory) required to distil the desired barcode. PH computation for many other simplicial filtrations constructed from point clouds, finite metric spaces, or graphs are also ultimately limited by similar considerations.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: In recent years, persistent homology (PH) (see e.g.    [ref]34 [ref]11    for surveys) has been a key driving force behind the ever-increasing adoption of topological approaches in a wide variety of computational contexts, such as geometric inference  ,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
