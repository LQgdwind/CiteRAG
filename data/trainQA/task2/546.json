      "content": "Paper Title: Coconut: A Scalable Bottom-Up Approach for Building Data Series Indexes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe brute-force approach for evaluating nearest neighbor queries is by performing a sequential pass over the complete dataset.\nHowever, as data series collections grow to terabytes   , scanning the complete dataset becomes performance bottleneck taking hours or more to complete. This is especially problematic in exploratory search scenarios, where batch execution of queries is impossible because the next query depends on the results of previous queries. To mitigate this problem, various dimensionality reduction techniques have been proposed to transform data series into summarizations that enable approximating and lower bounding the distance between any two data series. Examples include generic Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFT)¬†   , Piecewise Linear Approximation (PLA)¬†0, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)¬†3 , Discrete Haar Wavelet Transforms (DHWT)¬† , Piecewise Constant Approximation (PCA), and Adaptive Piecewise Constant Approximation (APCA)¬†, as well as data series specific techniques such as Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA)¬†1, Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX)¬†7 and the indexable Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (iùëñiSAX)¬†4 .\nThese smaller summarizations can be scanned and filtered¬† 5 or indexed and pruned¬†[ref]14   6 4 3 0 1  8 8 to avoid accessing parts of the data that do not contain the nearest neighbor. Our work follows the same high-level idea of indexing the data series based on a smaller summarization to enable pruning, though our work is the first to use sortable summarizations to facilitate index construction. In all previous work, the index is constructed through top-down insertions that lead to many slow random I/Os and to a sparsely populated, non-contiguous and unbalanced index. Our work is the first to use a bottom-up bulk-loading algorithm and median-based splitting to efficiently build a contiguous, balanced, and densely populated index. Note that our infrastructure can be used in conjunction with any summarization that represents a sequence as a multi-dimensional point, and so it is compatible with all main-stream summarizations¬†    0 3     4 .\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: (PAA)¬†1, Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX)¬†7 and the indexable Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (iùëñiSAX)¬†4 .\nThese smaller summarizations can be scanned and filtered¬† 5 or indexed and pruned¬†[ref]14   6 4 3 0 1  8 8 to avoid accessing parts of the data that do not contain the nearest neighbor.
