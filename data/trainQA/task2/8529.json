      "content": "Paper Title: The Annotated Dependency Pair Framework for Almost-Sure Termination of Probabilistic Term Rewriting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe assume some familiarity with term rewriting [ref]7, but recapitulate all important notions.\nWe regard finite signatures Σ=⨄n∈ℕΣn\\Sigma=\\biguplus_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}\\Sigma_{n}, where Σn\\Sigma_{n} is the set of nn-ary functions symbols and we require Σ0≠∅\\Sigma_{0}\\neq\\varnothing.333This requirement ensures that there exist ground terms.\nThis is not a restriction, since we showed in 8 that almost sure termination of PTRSs is preserved under signature extensions.\nLet 𝒯=𝒯​(Σ,𝒱)\\mathcal{T}=\\mathcal{T}\\left(\\Sigma,\\mathcal{V}\\right) denote the set of all terms over Σ\\Sigma and a set of variables 𝒱\\mathcal{V}, which is recursively defined as the smallest set such that 𝒱⊆𝒯\\mathcal{V}\\subseteq\\mathcal{T}, and if f∈Σnf\\in\\Sigma_{n} and t1,…,tn∈𝒯t_{1},\\ldots,t_{n}\\in\\mathcal{T}, then f​(t1,…,tn)∈𝒯f(t_{1},\\ldots,t_{n})\\in\\mathcal{T}.\nA substitution is a function σ:𝒱→𝒯\\sigma:\\mathcal{V}\\to\\mathcal{T} with σ​(x)=x\\sigma(x)=x for all but finitely many x∈𝒱x\\in\\mathcal{V}.\nWe lift substitutions to terms by defining σ​(t)=f​(σ​(t1),…,σ​(tn))\\sigma(t)=f(\\sigma(t_{1}),\\dots,\\sigma(t_{n})) for a term t=f​(t1,…,tn)∈𝒯t=f(t_{1},\\dots,t_{n})\\in\\mathcal{T}, and we often write t​σt\\sigma instead of σ​(t)\\sigma(t).\nFor a term t∈𝒯t\\in\\mathcal{T}, the set of positions Pos​(t)\\mathrm{Pos}(t) is the smallest subset of ℕ∗\\mathbb{N}^{*} satisfying ε∈Pos​(t)\\varepsilon\\in\\mathrm{Pos}(t), and if t=f​(t1,…,tn)t=f(t_{1},\\dots,t_{n}) then for all 1≤j≤n1\\leq j\\leq n and all π∈Pos​(tj)\\pi\\in\\mathrm{Pos}(t_{j}) we have j.π∈Pos​(t)j.\\pi\\in\\mathrm{Pos}(t).\nIf π∈Pos​(t)\\pi\\in\\mathrm{Pos}(t) then t|πt|_{\\pi} denotes the subterm\nat position π\\pi, i.e., t|ε=tt|_{\\varepsilon}=t for the root position ε\\varepsilon and t|j.π=tj|πt|_{j.\\pi}=t_{j}|_{\\pi} for t=f​(t1,…,tn)t=f(t_{1},\\dots,t_{n}), 1≤j≤n1\\leq j\\leq n, and π∈ℕ∗\\pi\\in\\mathbb{N}^{*}.\nThe root symbol at position ε\\varepsilon is also denoted by root⁡(t)\\operatorname{root}(t).\nWe write t​⊵​st\\trianglerighteq s if ss is a subterm of tt and and t⊳st\\triangleright s if ss is a proper subterm of tt (i.e., if t​⊵​st\\trianglerighteq s and t≠st\\neq s).\nLet t​[r]πt[r]_{\\pi} denote the term that results from replacing the subterm t|πt|_{\\pi} at position π\\pi with the term r∈𝒯r\\in\\mathcal{T}, i.e., t​[r]ε=rt[r]_{\\varepsilon}=r and t​[r]j.π=f​(t1,…,tj​[r]|π,…,tn)t[r]_{j.\\pi}=f(t_{1},\\dots,t_{j}[r]|_{\\pi},\\dots,t_{n}) for t=f​(t1,…,tn)t=f(t_{1},\\dots,t_{n}), 1≤j≤n1\\leq j\\leq n, and π∈ℕ∗\\pi\\in\\mathbb{N}^{*}.\nA context is a term C∈𝒯​(Σ⊎{□},𝒱)C\\in\\mathcal{T}\\left(\\Sigma\\uplus\\{\\square\\},\\mathcal{V}\\right) containing the 0-ary function symbol □\\square exactly once.\nFor a context CC and a term tt, let C​[t]C[t] denote the term resulting from CC by replacing the only occurrence of □\\square by tt. A rewrite rule ℓ→r\\ell\\to r is a pair of terms ℓ,r∈𝒯\\ell,r\\in\\mathcal{T} such that 𝒱​(r)⊆𝒱​(ℓ)\\mathcal{V}(r)\\subseteq\\mathcal{V}(\\ell) and ℓ∉𝒱\\ell\\notin\\mathcal{V}, where 𝒱​(t)\\mathcal{V}(t) denotes the set of all variables occurring in t∈𝒯t\\in\\mathcal{T}.\nThe restrictions 𝒱​(r)⊆𝒱​(ℓ)\\mathcal{V}(r)\\subseteq\\mathcal{V}(\\ell) and ℓ∉𝒱\\ell\\notin\\mathcal{V} are imposed to exclude trivially non-terminating systems.\nHere, ℓ\\ell is called the left-hand side and rr the right-hand side of the rule.\nA term rewrite system (TRS) is a finite set of rewrite rules.\nAs an example, consider ℛ𝖾𝗑={(​1​),(​2​)}\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathsf{ex}}\\!=\\!\\{\\eqref{R-ex-1},\\eqref{R-ex-2}\\}. A TRS ℛ\\mathcal{R} induces a rewrite relation →ℛ⊆𝒯×𝒯{\\to_{\\mathcal{R}}}\\subseteq\\mathcal{T}\\times\\mathcal{T} on terms where s→ℛts\\to_{\\mathcal{R}}t holds if there is a position π∈Pos​(s)\\pi\\in\\mathrm{Pos}(s), a rule ℓ→r∈ℛ\\ell\\to r\\in\\mathcal{R}, and a substitution σ\\sigma such that s|π=ℓ​σs|_{\\pi}=\\ell\\sigma and t=s​[r​σ]πt=s[r\\sigma]_{\\pi}.\nA rewrite step s→ℛts\\to_{\\mathcal{R}}t is an innermost rewrite step (denoted s→𝗂ℛts\\mathrel{\\mathrel{\\smash{\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle\\raisebox{3.4pt}{\\tiny$\\mathsf{i}\\>$}}}{{\\smash{\\rightarrow}}}}}_{\\mathcal{R}}}t) if all proper subterms of the used redex ℓ​σ\\ell\\sigma are in normal form w.r.t. ℛ\\mathcal{R}, i.e., the proper subterms of ℓ​σ\\ell\\sigma do not contain redexes themselves and thus, they cannot be reduced with →ℛ\\to_{\\mathcal{R}}.\nFor example, we have 𝖿​(𝗀​(x))→𝗂ℛ𝖾𝗑𝖿​(𝗌​(x))\\mathsf{f}(\\mathsf{g}(x))\\mathrel{\\smash{\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle\\raisebox{3.4pt}{\\tiny$\\mathsf{i}\\>$}}}{{\\smash{\\rightarrow}}}}}_{\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathsf{ex}}}\\mathsf{f}(\\mathsf{s}(x)).\nLet 𝙽𝙵ℛ\\mathtt{NF}_{\\mathcal{R}} denote the set of all terms that are in normal form w.r.t. ℛ\\mathcal{R}, and let 𝙰𝙽𝙵ℛ\\mathtt{ANF}_{\\mathcal{R}} denote the set of all terms that are in argument normal form w.r.t. ℛ\\mathcal{R}, i.e., all terms where every proper subterm is in normal form. Two rules ℓ1→r1,ℓ2→r2∈ℛ\\ell_{1}\\to r_{1},\\ell_{2}\\to r_{2}\\in\\mathcal{R} with renamed variables such that 𝒱​(ℓ1)∩𝒱​(ℓ2)=∅\\mathcal{V}(\\ell_{1})\\cap\\mathcal{V}(\\ell_{2})=\\varnothing are overlapping\nif there exists a non-variable position π\\pi of ℓ1\\ell_{1} such that ℓ1|π\\ell_{1}|_{\\pi} and ℓ2\\ell_{2} are unifiable, i.e., there exists a substitution σ\\sigma such that ℓ1|π​σ=ℓ2​σ\\ell_{1}|_{\\pi}\\sigma=\\ell_{2}\\sigma.\nIf (ℓ1→r1)=(ℓ2→r2)(\\ell_{1}\\to r_{1})=(\\ell_{2}\\to r_{2}), then we require that π≠ε\\pi\\neq\\varepsilon.\nℛ\\mathcal{R} is non-overlapping (NO) if it has no overlapping rules.\nAs an example, the TRS ℛ𝖾𝗑\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathsf{ex}} is non-overlapping.\nA TRS is left-linear (right-linear) if every variable occurs at most once in the left-hand side (right-hand side) of a rule, and it is linear if it is both left- and right-linear.\nFinally, a TRS is non-duplicating\nif for every rule, every variable occurs at most as often in the right-hand side as in the left-hand side.\nAs an example, ℛ𝖾𝗑\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathsf{ex}} is both left- and right-linear, and hence non-duplicating. We call a TRS ℛ\\mathcal{R} strongly normalizing (or terminating) or 𝚂𝙽\\mathtt{SN} for short if →ℛ\\to_{\\mathcal{R}} is well founded.\nℛ\\mathcal{R} is strongly innermost normalizing (or innermost terminating) or 𝚒𝚂𝙽\\mathtt{iSN} for short if →𝗂ℛ\\mathrel{\\smash{\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle\\raisebox{3.4pt}{\\tiny$\\mathsf{i}\\>$}}}{{\\smash{\\rightarrow}}}}}_{\\mathcal{R}} is well founded. Next, we recapitulate the DP framework with its core processors to analyze (innermost) termination (see, e.g.,    1 2\nfor further details).\nWe decompose the signature Σ=𝒟⊎𝒞\\Sigma=\\mathcal{D}\\uplus\\mathcal{C} such that f∈𝒟f\\in\\mathcal{D} if f=root⁡(ℓ)f=\\operatorname{root}(\\ell) for some ℓ→r∈ℛ\\ell\\to r\\in\\mathcal{R}.\nThe symbols in 𝒟\\mathcal{D} are called defined symbols\n(representing executable functions) and the symbols in 𝒞\\mathcal{C} are constructors (representing data).\nFor ℛ𝖾𝗑\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathsf{ex}} we have 𝒟={𝖿,𝗀}\\mathcal{D}=\\{\\mathsf{f},\\mathsf{g}\\} and 𝒞={𝗌,𝖼}\\mathcal{C}=\\{\\mathsf{s},\\mathsf{c}\\}.\nFor every f∈𝒟f\\in\\mathcal{D} we introduce a fresh annotated symbol f#f^{\\#} of the same arity.444The symbols f#f^{\\#} were also called tuple symbols\n(or marked symbols) in the literature.\nThese symbols represent a “function call” with the tuple of arguments of the original defined symbol ff.\nLet 𝒟#\\mathcal{D}^{\\#} denote the set of all annotated symbols, Σ#=𝒟#⊎Σ\\Sigma^{\\#}=\\mathcal{D}^{\\#}\\uplus\\Sigma, and 𝒯#=𝒯​(Σ#,𝒱)\\mathcal{T}^{\\#}=\\mathcal{T}\\left(\\Sigma^{\\#},\\mathcal{V}\\right).\nFor any t=f​(t1,…,tn)∈𝒯t=f(t_{1},\\ldots,t_{n})\\in\\mathcal{T} with f∈𝒟f\\in\\mathcal{D}, let t#=f#​(t1,…,tn)t^{\\#}=f^{\\#}(t_{1},\\ldots,t_{n}).\nFor every rule ℓ→r\\ell\\to r and every (not necessarily proper) subterm tt of rr with defined root symbol, one obtains a dependency pair (DP) ℓ#→t#\\ell^{\\#}\\to t^{\\#} that represents two possible subsequent “function calls” in a rewrite sequence.\n𝒟​𝒫​(ℛ)\\mathcal{DP}(\\mathcal{R}) denotes the set of all dependency pairs of ℛ\\mathcal{R}.\nAs an example, we have 𝒟​𝒫​(ℛ𝖾𝗑)={(​3​),(​4​)}\\mathcal{DP}(\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathsf{ex}})=\\{\\eqref{R-ex-3},\\eqref{R-ex-4}\\}.\nTo ease readability, we often use capital letters like 𝖥\\mathsf{F} instead of 𝖿#\\mathsf{f}^{\\#}. The DP framework uses DP problems\n(𝒫,ℛ)(\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{R}) where 𝒫\\mathcal{P} is a (finite) set of DPs and ℛ\\mathcal{R} is a TRS.\nA (possibly infinite) sequence t0#,t1#,t2#,…t_{0}^{\\#},t_{1}^{\\#},t_{2}^{\\#},\\ldots with tj#→ε𝒫∘→ℛ∗tj+1#t_{j}^{\\#}\\mathrel{\\smash{\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle\\raisebox{3.4pt}{\\tiny$\\varepsilon\\>$}}}{{\\smash{\\rightarrow}}}}}_{\\mathcal{P}}\\circ\\to_{\\mathcal{R}}^{*}t_{j+1}^{\\#} for all jj is a (𝒫,ℛ)(\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{R})-chain\nwhich represents sequences of subsequent “function calls” in evaluations.\nHere, for any binary relation →\\to, “→∗\\to^{*}” denotes its reflexive and transitive closure.\nMoreover, “→ε𝒫\\mathrel{\\smash{\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle\\raisebox{3.4pt}{\\tiny$\\varepsilon\\>$}}}{{\\smash{\\rightarrow}}}}}_{\\mathcal{P}}” denotes rewrite steps with DPs from 𝒫\\mathcal{P} at the root and “∘\\circ” denotes composition.\nWe refer to steps with →ε𝒫\\mathrel{\\smash{\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle\\raisebox{3.4pt}{\\tiny$\\varepsilon\\>$}}}{{\\smash{\\rightarrow}}}}}_{\\mathcal{P}} as 𝐚\\mathbf{a}-steps\n(𝐚\\mathbf{a} for annotation, as we rewrite at the position of an annotated symbol, since rewrite steps with →ε𝒫\\mathrel{\\smash{\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle\\raisebox{3.4pt}{\\tiny$\\varepsilon\\>$}}}{{\\smash{\\rightarrow}}}}}_{\\mathcal{P}} require an annotated symbol at the root), and we call steps with →ℛ\\to_{\\mathcal{R}} 𝐧\\mathbf{n}-steps\n(𝐧\\mathbf{n} for no-annotation, as we rewrite at the position of a symbol without annotation).\nThe latter are used to evaluate the arguments of an annotated function symbol.\nSo an infinite chain consists of an infinite number of 𝐚\\mathbf{a}-steps with a finite number of 𝐧\\mathbf{n}-steps between consecutive 𝐚\\mathbf{a}-steps.\nA (possibly infinite) sequence t0#,t1#,t2#,…t_{0}^{\\#},t_{1}^{\\#},t_{2}^{\\#},\\ldots with tj#⟶ε​𝗂𝒫,ℛ∘→𝗂ℛ∗tj+1#t_{j}^{\\#}\\mathrel{\\smash{\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle\\raisebox{3.4pt}{\\tiny$\\varepsilon\\>\\mathsf{i}\\>$}}}{{\\smash{\\longrightarrow}}}}}_{\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{R}}\\circ\\mathrel{\\mathrel{\\smash{\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle\\raisebox{3.4pt}{\\tiny$\\mathsf{i}\\>$}}}{{\\smash{\\rightarrow}}}}}_{\\mathcal{R}}^{*}}t_{j+1}^{\\#} for all jj is an innermost (𝒫,ℛ)(\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{R})-chain.\nHere, “⟶ε​𝗂𝒫,ℛ\\mathrel{\\smash{\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle\\raisebox{3.4pt}{\\tiny$\\varepsilon\\>\\mathsf{i}\\>$}}}{{\\smash{\\longrightarrow}}}}}_{\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{R}}” is the restriction of →ε𝒫\\mathrel{\\smash{\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle\\raisebox{3.4pt}{\\tiny$\\varepsilon\\>$}}}{{\\smash{\\rightarrow}}}}}_{\\mathcal{P}} to rewrite steps where the used redex is in 𝙽𝙵ℛ\\mathtt{NF}_{\\mathcal{R}}.\nFor example, 𝖥​(𝗌​(x)),𝖥​(𝗌​(x)),…\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{s}(x)),\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{s}(x)),\\ldots is an infinite innermost (𝒟​𝒫​(ℛ𝖾𝗑),ℛ𝖾𝗑)(\\mathcal{DP}(\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathsf{ex}}),\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathsf{ex}})-chain, as 𝖥​(𝗌​(x))⟶ε​𝗂𝒟​𝒫​(ℛ𝖾𝗑),ℛ𝖾𝗑𝖥​(𝗀​(x))→𝗂ℛ𝖾𝗑∗𝖥​(𝗌​(x))\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{s}(x))\\mathrel{\\smash{\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle\\raisebox{3.4pt}{\\tiny$\\varepsilon\\>\\mathsf{i}\\>$}}}{{\\smash{\\longrightarrow}}}}}_{\\mathcal{DP}(\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathsf{ex}}),\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathsf{ex}}}\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{g}(x))\\mathrel{\\smash{\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle\\raisebox{3.4pt}{\\tiny$\\mathsf{i}\\>$}}}{{\\smash{\\rightarrow}}}}}_{\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathsf{ex}}}^{*}\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{s}(x)). A DP problem (𝒫,ℛ)(\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{R}) is called terminating (or 𝚂𝙽\\mathtt{SN}) if there is no infinite (𝒫,ℛ)(\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{R})-chain.\nIt is innermost terminating (or 𝚒𝚂𝙽\\mathtt{iSN}) if there is no infinite innermost (𝒫,ℛ)(\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{R})-chain.\nThe main result on DPs is the chain criterion which states that there is no infinite (innermost) sequence t0→(𝗂)ℛt1→(𝗂)ℛ…t_{0}\\mathrel{\\smash{\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle\\raisebox{3.4pt}{\\tiny$(\\mathsf{i})\\>$}}}{{\\smash{\\rightarrow}}}}}_{\\mathcal{R}}t_{1}\\mathrel{\\smash{\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle\\raisebox{3.4pt}{\\tiny$(\\mathsf{i})\\>$}}}{{\\smash{\\rightarrow}}}}}_{\\mathcal{R}}\\ldots (i.e., ℛ\\mathcal{R} is (𝚒)​𝚂𝙽\\mathtt{(i)SN}) iff there is no infinite (innermost) (𝒟​𝒫​(ℛ),ℛ)(\\mathcal{DP}(\\mathcal{R}),\\mathcal{R})-chain (i.e., (𝒟​𝒫​(ℛ),ℛ)(\\mathcal{DP}(\\mathcal{R}),\\mathcal{R}) is (𝚒)​𝚂𝙽\\mathtt{(i)SN}).\nThe DP framework is a divide-and-conquer approach, which applies DP processors Proc\\operatorname{Proc} of the form Proc⁡(𝒫,ℛ)={(𝒫1,ℛ1),…,(𝒫n,ℛn)}\\operatorname{Proc}(\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{R})=\\{(\\mathcal{P}_{1},\\mathcal{R}_{1}),\\ldots,(\\mathcal{P}_{n},\\mathcal{R}_{n})\\}, where 𝒫,𝒫1,…,𝒫n\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{P}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathcal{P}_{n} are (finite) sets of DPs and ℛ,ℛ1,…,ℛn\\mathcal{R},\\mathcal{R}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathcal{R}_{n} are TRSs, to transform DP problems into simpler sub-problems.\nA processor Proc\\operatorname{Proc} is sound for termination (for innermost termination) if (𝒫,ℛ)(\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{R}) is 𝚂𝙽\\mathtt{SN} (𝚒𝚂𝙽\\mathtt{iSN}) whenever (𝒫j,ℛj)(\\mathcal{P}_{j},\\mathcal{R}_{j}) is 𝚂𝙽\\mathtt{SN} (𝚒𝚂𝙽\\mathtt{iSN}) for all 1≤j≤n1\\leq j\\leq n.\nIt is complete for termination (for innermost termination) if (𝒫j,ℛj)(\\mathcal{P}_{j},\\mathcal{R}_{j}) is 𝚂𝙽\\mathtt{SN} (𝚒𝚂𝙽\\mathtt{iSN}) for all 1≤j≤n1\\leq j\\leq n whenever (𝒫,ℛ)(\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{R}) is 𝚂𝙽\\mathtt{SN} (𝚒𝚂𝙽\\mathtt{iSN}). So given a TRS ℛ\\mathcal{R}, one starts with the initial DP problem (𝒟​𝒫​(ℛ),ℛ)(\\mathcal{DP}(\\mathcal{R}),\\mathcal{R}) and applies sound (and preferably complete) DP processors repeatedly until all sub-problems are “solved”, i.e., sound processors transform them to the empty set.\nThis yields a modular framework for termination and innermost termination proofs, as different techniques can be used for different sub-problems (𝒫j,ℛj)(\\mathcal{P}_{j},\\mathcal{R}_{j}).\nTo give an intuition for the framework, the following three theorems recapitulate the three most important processors of the DP framework.\nLater in the paper, we will also introduce additional processors which we adapt to the probabilistic setting. The (innermost) (𝒫,ℛ)(\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{R})-dependency graph is a control flow graph that indicates which DPs can be used after each other in an (innermost) chain.\nIts set of nodes is 𝒫\\mathcal{P} and there is an edge from ℓ1#→t1#\\ell_{1}^{\\#}\\to t_{1}^{\\#} to ℓ2#→t2#\\ell_{2}^{\\#}\\to t_{2}^{\\#} if there exist substitutions σ1,σ2\\sigma_{1},\\sigma_{2} such that t1#​σ1→ℛ∗ℓ2#​σ2t_{1}^{\\#}\\sigma_{1}\\to_{\\mathcal{R}}^{*}\\ell_{2}^{\\#}\\sigma_{2} (t1#​σ1→𝗂ℛ∗ℓ2#​σ2t_{1}^{\\#}\\sigma_{1}\\mathrel{\\smash{\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle\\raisebox{3.4pt}{\\tiny$\\mathsf{i}\\>$}}}{{\\smash{\\rightarrow}}}}}_{\\mathcal{R}}^{*}\\ell_{2}^{\\#}\\sigma_{2} and ℓ1#​σ1,ℓ2#​σ2∈𝙽𝙵ℛ\\ell_{1}^{\\#}\\sigma_{1},\\ell_{2}^{\\#}\\sigma_{2}\\in\\mathtt{NF}_{\\mathcal{R}} for the innermost dependency graph).\nAny infinite (innermost) (𝒫,ℛ)(\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{R})-chain corresponds to an infinite path in the (innermost) dependency graph, and since the graph is finite, this infinite path must end in some strongly connected component (SCC).555Here, a set 𝒫′\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime} of DPs is an SCC if it is a maximal cycle, i.e., it is a maximal set such that for any ℓ1#→t1#\\ell_{1}^{\\#}\\to t_{1}^{\\#} and ℓ2#→t2#\\ell_{2}^{\\#}\\to t_{2}^{\\#} in 𝒫′\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime} there is a non-empty path from ℓ1#→t1#\\ell_{1}^{\\#}\\to t_{1}^{\\#} to ℓ2#→t2#\\ell_{2}^{\\#}\\to t_{2}^{\\#} which only traverses nodes from 𝒫′\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}.\nHence, it suffices to consider the SCCs of this graph independently. Let 𝒫1,…,𝒫n\\mathcal{P}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathcal{P}_{n} be the SCCs of the (innermost) (𝒫,ℛ)(\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{R})-dependency graph.\nThen Proc𝙳𝙶⁡(𝒫,ℛ)={(𝒫1,ℛ),…,(𝒫n,ℛ)}\\operatorname{Proc}_{\\mathtt{DG}}(\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{R})=\\{(\\mathcal{P}_{1},\\mathcal{R}),\\ldots,\\linebreak(\\mathcal{P}_{n},\\mathcal{R})\\} is sound and complete for (innermost) termination.

Here, Proc𝙳𝙶⁡(𝒟​𝒫​(ℛ𝖿𝖿𝗀),ℛ𝖿𝖿𝗀)\\operatorname{Proc}_{\\mathtt{DG}}(\\mathcal{DP}(\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathsf{ffg}}),\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathsf{ffg}}) yields the DP problem ({(​8​)},ℛ𝖿𝖿𝗀)(\\{\\eqref{R-fgf-4}\\},\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathsf{ffg}}). While the exact (innermost) dependency graph is not computable in general, there exist several techniques to over-approximate it automatically, see, e.g.,   1.\nA basic approximation technique that we will also use for the novel transformational processors in Sect. 5 works as follows.\nTo find out whether there is an edge from ℓ1#→t1#\\ell^{\\#}_{1}\\to t^{\\#}_{1} to ℓ2#→t2#\\ell^{\\#}_{2}\\to t^{\\#}_{2} we compute the skeleton Capℛ⁡(t1#)\\operatorname{Cap}_{\\mathcal{R}}(t^{\\#}_{1}) of t1#t^{\\#}_{1} that remains unchanged when reducing t1#​σ1t^{\\#}_{1}\\sigma_{1} to ℓ2#​σ2\\ell^{\\#}_{2}\\sigma_{2} for arbitrary substitutions σ1\\sigma_{1} and σ2\\sigma_{2}.\nCapℛ⁡(t1#)\\operatorname{Cap}_{\\mathcal{R}}(t^{\\#}_{1}) results from replacing all those subterms of t1#t^{\\#}_{1} by different fresh variables whose root is a defined symbol of ℛ\\mathcal{R}.\nHere, multiple occurrences of the same subterm are also replaced by pairwise different variables.\nSo if 𝖿∈𝒟\\mathsf{f}\\in\\mathcal{D} and 𝖼∈𝒞\\mathsf{c}\\in\\mathcal{C}, then Capℛ⁡(𝖼​(𝖿​(x),𝖿​(x)))=𝖼​(x1,x2)\\operatorname{Cap}_{\\mathcal{R}}(\\mathsf{c}(\\mathsf{f}(x),\\mathsf{f}(x)))=\\mathsf{c}(x_{1},x_{2}).\nAfterwards, we check whether the skeleton Capℛ⁡(t1#)\\operatorname{Cap}_{\\mathcal{R}}(t^{\\#}_{1}) and ℓ2#\\ell^{\\#}_{2} are unifiable by a substitution σ\\sigma where ℓ1#​σ\\ell^{\\#}_{1}\\sigma and ℓ2#​σ\\ell^{\\#}_{2}\\sigma are in 𝙰𝙽𝙵ℛ\\mathtt{ANF}_{\\mathcal{R}} (and thus, also in 𝙽𝙵ℛ\\mathtt{NF}_{\\mathcal{R}}). If they are, then we create an edge from ℓ1#→t1#\\ell^{\\#}_{1}\\to t^{\\#}_{1} to ℓ2#→t2#\\ell^{\\#}_{2}\\to t^{\\#}_{2} in the estimated innermost dependency graph.\nIf they cannot be unified, then there is no innermost rewrite sequence from an instantiation of t1#t^{\\#}_{1} to an instantiation of ℓ2#\\ell^{\\#}_{2} such that both instantiated left-hand sides ℓ1#,ℓ2#\\ell^{\\#}_{1},\\ell^{\\#}_{2} are in argument normal form.\nThus, this leads to a sound over-approximation of the innermost dependency graph.\nTo check whether we can reduce t1#​σ1t^{\\#}_{1}\\sigma_{1} to ℓ2#​σ2\\ell^{\\#}_{2}\\sigma_{2} in non-innermost chains, we add another transformation Ren\\operatorname{Ren} that replaces all variable occurrences (including multiple occurrences of the same variable) by fresh variables.\nThe reason for this additional transformation is that for non-innermost chains, variables in t1#t^{\\#}_{1} may be instantiated by terms that are not in normal form.\nHence, they can be evaluated to different terms during the reduction of the arguments of t1#t^{\\#}_{1}.\nThus, we check unifiability of Ren⁡(Capℛ⁡(t1#))\\operatorname{Ren}(\\operatorname{Cap}_{\\mathcal{R}}(t^{\\#}_{1})) and ℓ2#\\ell^{\\#}_{2} for the (non-innermost) dependency graph. The next processor removes rules that cannot be used for right-hand sides of dependency pairs when their variables are instantiated with normal forms. Let ℛ\\mathcal{R} be a TRS.\nFor every f∈Σ#f\\!\\in\\!\\Sigma^{\\#} let Rulesℛ⁡(f)={ℓ→r∈ℛ∣root⁡(ℓ)=f}\\operatorname{Rules}_{\\mathcal{R}}(f)=\\{\\ell\\to r\\in\\mathcal{R}\\mid\\operatorname{root}(\\ell)=f\\}.\nFor any t∈𝒯​(Σ#,𝒱)t\\in\\mathcal{T}\\left(\\Sigma^{\\#},\\mathcal{V}\\right), its usable rules 𝒰ℛ​(t)\\mathcal{U}_{\\mathcal{R}}(t) are the smallest set such that 𝒰ℛ​(x)=∅\\mathcal{U}_{\\mathcal{R}}(x)=\\varnothing for all x∈𝒱x\\in\\mathcal{V} and 𝒰ℛ​(f​(t1,…,tn))=Rulesℛ⁡(f)∪⋃j=1n𝒰ℛ​(tj)∪⋃ℓ→r∈Rulesℛ⁡(f)𝒰ℛ​(r)\\mathcal{U}_{\\mathcal{R}}(f(t_{1},\\ldots,t_{n}))=\\operatorname{Rules}_{\\mathcal{R}}(f)\\,\\cup\\,\\bigcup_{j=1}^{n}\\mathcal{U}_{\\mathcal{R}}(t_{j})\\;\\cup\\;\\bigcup_{\\ell\\to r\\in\\operatorname{Rules}_{\\mathcal{R}}(f)}\\mathcal{U}_{\\mathcal{R}}(r).\nThe usable rules for the DP problem (𝒫,ℛ)(\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{R}) are 𝒰​(𝒫,ℛ)=⋃ℓ#→t#∈𝒫𝒰ℛ​(t#)\\mathcal{U}(\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{R})=\\bigcup_{\\ell^{\\#}\\to t^{\\#}\\in\\mathcal{P}}\\,\\mathcal{U}_{\\mathcal{R}}(t^{\\#}).\nThen Proc𝚄𝚁⁡(𝒫,ℛ)={(𝒫,𝒰​(𝒫,ℛ))}\\operatorname{Proc}_{\\mathtt{UR}}(\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{R})=\\{(\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{U}(\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{R}))\\} is sound but not complete for innermost termination.666\nSee  for a complete version of this processor.\nIt extends DP problems by an additional set which stores the left-hand sides of all rules (including the non-usable ones) to determine whether a rewrite step is innermost.\nWe omit this refinement here for readability. To continue Ex. 2.2 for innermost rewriting, Proc𝚄𝚁⁡({(​8​)},ℛ𝖿𝖿𝗀)\\operatorname{Proc}_{\\mathtt{UR}}\\bigl{(}\\{\\eqref{R-fgf-4}\\},\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathsf{ffg}}\\bigr{)} yields the problem ({(​8​)},∅)(\\{\\eqref{R-fgf-4}\\},\\varnothing), i.e., it removes all rules, because the right-hand side of (​8​)\\eqref{R-fgf-4} does not contain the defined symbol 𝖿\\mathsf{f}. Finally, the reduction pair processor allows us to use term orders to remove certain DPs.\nAs our probabilistic adaption in Sect. 4\nneeds to consider “expected values”, we focus on reduction pairs derived from a Σ#\\Sigma^{\\#}-algebra.\nAn (ordered) Σ#\\Sigma^{\\#}-algebra is a pair (𝒜,≻)(\\mathcal{A},\\succ), where 𝒜\\mathcal{A} maps every function symbol f∈Σn#f\\in\\Sigma_{n}^{\\#} of arity nn to a function 𝒜​(f)=f𝒜:An→A\\mathcal{A}(f)=f_{\\mathcal{A}}:A^{n}\\to A for a non-empty carrier set AA.\nThe mapping 𝒜\\mathcal{A} is extended to ground terms, i.e., 𝒜(f(t1,…,tn)=f𝒜(𝒜(t1),…,𝒜(tn))\\mathcal{A}(f(t_{1},\\ldots,t_{n})=f_{\\mathcal{A}}(\\mathcal{A}(t_{1}),\\ldots,\\mathcal{A}(t_{n})) for f∈Σn#f\\in\\Sigma_{n}^{\\#} and ground terms t1,…,tn∈𝒯#t_{1},\\ldots,t_{n}\\in\\mathcal{T}^{\\#}.\nFurthermore, ≻\\succ is a well-founded order on AA, i.e., ≻\\succ is well founded and transitive.\nNow one can obtain a well-founded order on ground terms by considering t1t_{1} to be greater than t2t_{2} iff 𝒜​(t1)≻𝒜​(t2)\\mathcal{A}(t_{1})\\succ\\mathcal{A}(t_{2}).\nWe extend this to a well-founded order on terms with variables by writing 𝒜​(t1)≻𝒜​(t2)\\mathcal{A}(t_{1})\\succ\\mathcal{A}(t_{2}) iff 𝒜​(t1​σ)≻𝒜​(t2​σ)\\mathcal{A}(t_{1}\\sigma)\\succ\\mathcal{A}(t_{2}\\sigma) holds for all substitutions σ\\sigma that instantiate the variables of t1t_{1} and t2t_{2} by ground terms.\nLet ≽\\succcurlyeq be the reflexive closure of ≻\\succ.\nWe say that (𝒜,≻)(\\mathcal{A},\\succ) is monotonic\nif 𝒜​(t1)≻𝒜​(t2)\\mathcal{A}(t_{1})\\succ\\mathcal{A}(t_{2}) implies 𝒜​(C​[t1])≻𝒜​(C​[t2])\\mathcal{A}(C[t_{1}])\\succ\\mathcal{A}(C[t_{2}]), and weakly monotonic if 𝒜​(t1)≽𝒜​(t2)\\mathcal{A}(t_{1})\\succcurlyeq\\mathcal{A}(t_{2}) implies 𝒜​(C​[t1])≽𝒜​(C​[t2])\\mathcal{A}(C[t_{1}])\\succcurlyeq\\mathcal{A}(C[t_{2}]) for every context CC.\nThe reduction pair processor searches for a weakly monotonic Σ#\\Sigma^{\\#}-algebra (𝒜,≻)(\\mathcal{A},\\succ) such that all rules and DPs are ordered by ≽\\succcurlyeq, and it removes those DPs that are ordered by ≻\\succ. Let (𝒜,≻)(\\mathcal{A},\\succ) be a weakly monotonic Σ#\\Sigma^{\\#}-algebra.\nLet 𝒫=𝒫≽⊎𝒫≻\\mathcal{P}=\\mathcal{P}_{\\succcurlyeq}\\uplus\\mathcal{P}_{\\succ} with 𝒫≻≠∅\\mathcal{P}_{\\succ}\\neq\\varnothing where: Then Proc𝚁𝙿⁡(𝒫,ℛ)={(𝒫≻,ℛ)}\\operatorname{Proc}_{\\mathtt{RP}}(\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{R})=\\{(\\mathcal{P}_{\\succ},\\mathcal{R})\\} is sound and complete for both termination and innermost termination. An example for a Σ#\\Sigma^{\\#}-algebra is a polynomial interpretation (Pol,>)(\\operatorname{Pol},>).\nPol\\operatorname{Pol} maps every function symbol f∈Σ#f\\in\\Sigma^{\\#} to a polynomial fPol∈ℕ​[𝒱]f_{\\operatorname{Pol}}~\\in~\\mathbb{N}[\\mathcal{V}] over the variables 𝒱\\mathcal{V} with coefficients from ℕ\\mathbb{N}, see .\nThe order >> is simply the natural order on ℕ\\mathbb{N}.\nThe reduction pair processor allows us to use weakly monotonic polynomial interpretations that do not have to depend on all of their arguments, and SMT solvers can be used to search for an appropriate interpretation automatically.\nFor ({(​8​)},∅)(\\{\\eqref{R-fgf-4}\\},\\varnothing), one can use the reduction pair processor with the polynomial interpretation that maps 𝖿​(x)\\mathsf{f}(x) to x+1x+1 and both 𝖥​(x)\\mathsf{F}(x) and 𝗀​(x)\\mathsf{g}(x) to xx.\nThen, Proc𝚁𝙿⁡({(​8​)},∅)={(∅,∅)}\\operatorname{Proc}_{\\mathtt{RP}}\\bigl{(}\\{\\eqref{R-fgf-4}\\},\\varnothing\\bigr{)}=\\{\\bigl{(}\\varnothing,\\varnothing\\bigr{)}\\}.\nAs Proc𝙳𝙶⁡(∅,…)=∅\\operatorname{Proc}_{\\mathtt{DG}}(\\varnothing,\\ldots)=\\varnothing and all processors used are sound, this means that there is no infinite innermost chain for the initial DP problem (𝒟​𝒫​(ℛ𝖿𝖿𝗀),ℛ𝖿𝖿𝗀)(\\mathcal{DP}(\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathsf{ffg}}),\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathsf{ffg}}) and thus, ℛ𝖿𝖿𝗀\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathsf{ffg}} is innermost terminating.\nThis also implies that ℛ𝖿𝖿𝗀\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathsf{ffg}} is terminating, since ℛ𝖿𝖿𝗀\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathsf{ffg}} is non-overlapping, and hence, innermost termination implies termination .\nThere are several other classes of ordered Σ#\\Sigma^{\\#}-algebras that are suitable for the reduction pair processor, e.g., matrix interpretations .\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: We assume some familiarity with term rewriting [ref]7, but recapitulate all important notions.\nWe regard finite signatures Σ=⨄n∈ℕΣn\\Sigma=\\biguplus_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}\\Sigma_{n}, where Σn\\Sigma_{n} is the set of nn-ary functions symbols and we\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
