      "content": "Paper Title: Alpha-Refine: Boosting Tracking Performance by Precise Bounding Box Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPrecise box estimation is indispensable for a successful tracker.\nEarly trackers usually solve this problem by multi-scale search  [ref]6  \nor sampling-then-regression strategy 7 , which are inaccurate and greatly limit the performance of the trackers.\nFor obtaining more robust and precise tracking results, many state-of-the-art trackers  2 [ref]7 [ref]2\nadopt a multiple-stage tracking strategy, which introduces additional tracking stages for more precise box estimation.\nThese trackers first coarsely locate the target and then refine the initial result in the additional tracking stages\nto get more precise box prediction.\nHowever, this box estimation can still be improved, even for state-of-the-art trackers.\nAn oracle experiment verifies this opinion.\nWe set the tracker’s search region always centering at the ground truth so that\nthe performance will be mainly determined by the capacity of box estimation.\nTable 1 shows that with the aforementioned oracle setting, state-of-the-art trackers’\nAUC scores are still far from perfection, indicating unsatisfying box estimation, although\nsome methods (e.g. ATOM [ref]7, DiMP [ref]2) have built-in box estimation modules.\nIn contrast, given the perfectly centered search region, the proposed Alpha-Refine achieves significantly\nbetter performance, demonstrating that Alpha-Refine’s superiority in box estimation. Additionally, most of refinement methods in existing trackers  2 [ref]7 [ref]2 are weak in transferability,\nbecause their training is coupled with other components. Extra retraining is required if above refinement modules are applied to new base trackers.\nAs opposed to these methods, Alpha-Refine is trained independently and can be directly applied to any existing trackers in a plug-and-play style, requiring no extra training or modification of the base tracker. In this work, a series of design options are investigated and compared. Specifically, we assess multiple feature fusion modules and prediction heads. We also explore to use an auxiliary mask head, which introduces pixel-level supervision into the training. We find that extracting and maintaining precise spatial information is the key to precise box estimation.\nTo this end, we finally adopt a pixel-wise correlation as well as a key-point style prediction head for better maintaining and utilizing the detailed spatial information. Additionally, an auxiliary mask head is used, which encourages the network to extract more detailed spatial information, leading to more precise box estimation.\nMoreover, if we reserve the mask head at the inference stage, Alpha-Refine will enable the base trackers to predict the mask of the object, satisfying scenarios where the mask is required.\nThe design options will be discussed in Section 3 and verified in Section 4. To verify the effectiveness of our Alpha-Refine module, we choose six famous base trackers: ECO [ref]6,\nRT-MDNet 6, SiamRPNpp , ATOM [ref]7, DiMP [ref]2, and\nDiMPsuper [ref]2, on multiple tracking benchmarks, namely, LaSOT 1, GOT-10K 4, TrackingNet  and VOT2020 9.\nTake Fig. 1 as an example, experimental results show that our proposed refinement module improves the base trackers’ performance significantly.\nCompared with its competitors (i.e. IoU-Net [ref]7 [ref]2 and SiamMask ), Alpha-Refine’s performance also surpasses them by a large margin. The proposed Alpha-Refine method leads to a series of strengthened trackers, among which the ARSiamRPN (Alpha-Refine strengthened SiamRPNpp) and ARDiMP50 (Alpha-Refine strengthened DiMP50) achieve good efficiency-precision trade-off, while ARDiMPsuper (Alpha-Refine strengthened DiMPsuper) achieves state-of-the-art performance at a real-time speed on multiple benchmarks.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: Precise box estimation is indispensable for a successful tracker.\nEarly trackers usually solve this problem by multi-scale search  [ref]6  \nor sampling-then-regression strategy 7 , which are inaccurate and greatly limit the performance of the trackers.\nFor obtaining more robust and precise tracking results, many state-of-the-art\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
