      "content": "Paper Title: ATLAS: Automatically Detecting Discrepancies Between Privacy Policies and Privacy Labels\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile using developer reported privacy labels enabled us to build a training corpus almost a hundred times larger than previous work, our data was expected to be somewhat ‚Äúnoisy‚Äù [ref]26 . Smaller scale analyses in the past suggest that privacy labels may not be accurate  . While much work has been dedicated to learning from noisy, mislabeled data (, ), it is ‚Äúunfair and unreasonable to have noise in the‚Äù testing data . We outline a technique for importance sampling to help reduce noise when creating training and testing datasets. For clarity, we define a Positive instance as a privacy policy associated with a privacy label that reported a particular data type as being collected. A Negative instance is where the data type is reported to not be collected. Figure 5(a) characterizes how noisy the underlying data was by providing a depiction of a random sample of the Name data type: we randomly sampled 500 policies whose privacy label declared collection of Name, and 500 policies that did not. We then extracted an embedding from each policy using TF-IDF vectorization and created a two-dimensional representation using t-SNE [ref]27. There is significant overlap between positive and negative instances and no clear distinction between the two groups; this suggests that many policies might be mislabeled. However, as depicted in Figure 5(b), natural clusters tended to appear within the randomly sampled data. Points were clustered using DBSCAN ‚Äì since the number of clusters was not known a priori and the underlying data contains some noise ‚Äì after performing Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) on the high dimensional TF-IDF embeddings  . LSA was performed by using TruncatedSVD to project the high-dimensional data onto 10 components. We reasoned that these clusters are semantically similar privacy policies and should therefore all have the same privacy label (either positive or negative). For example, if a cluster had 20 positive instances and 5 negative instances, then the negative instances could potentially be mislabeled, since the content of their privacy policies were similar to many positive instances. We assigned clusters a positive or negative label by conducting a two-proportion z-test that compared the incidence of positive to negative labels within a cluster. If a cluster had a statistically significantly larger proportion (i.e., p << 0.05) of one class than the other, we assigned the cluster the label of the more prominent class. In cases where determining cluster labels was inconclusive (i.e., p ‚â•\\geq 0.05), we disregarded the cluster entirely. We then computed centroids for all positive and negative clusters. Finally, to construct a dataset of size NùëÅN, with N2ùëÅ2\\frac{N}{2} positive and N2ùëÅ2\\frac{N}{2} negative examples, we conducted a random oversample of NùëÅN instances per class. Then, for each class, we selected the N2ùëÅ2\\frac{N}{2} examples closest to the class centroids, effectively sampling points closer to centroids with higher probability than those farther away. We also equally weighted the contribution of each class centroid. Each of the Cùê∂C centroids had approximately N2‚ÄãCùëÅ2ùê∂\\frac{N}{2C} examples associated with it. To account for edge cases where no clusters were identified, we fell back to a simple random sample. This process was used to construct the test (N=150ùëÅ150N=150), validation (N=150ùëÅ150N=150), and training sets (N=1000ùëÅ1000N=1000), for each data type. We had 4,376 unique examples within the test sets, 4,262 unique examples within the validation sets, and 22,262 unique examples within the training sets. In total, we used 30,900 unique privacy policies to train and evaluate our classifiers. Intuitively, our sampling procedure can be thought of as focusing on high-density areas with large amounts of information more likely to be labeled correctly. Points on the edge have a lower probability of being selected: they are assumed to be less likely to be labeled correctly, therefore contributing less useful information. Figure 5(c) demonstrates how importance sampling creates a clear separation between the positive and negative classes, in contrast to random sampling shown in Figure 5(a).\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: While using developer reported privacy labels enabled us to build a training corpus almost a hundred times larger than previous work, our data was expected to be somewhat ‚Äúnoisy‚Äù [ref]26 .
