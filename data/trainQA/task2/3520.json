      "content": "Paper Title: LobsDICE: Offline Learning from Observation via Stationary Distribution Correction Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe ability to learn from experience is one of the core aspects of an intelligent agent. Reinforcement learning (RL)  provides a framework to acquire such an intelligent behavior autonomously through interactions with the environment while receiving reward feedback.\nHowever, the practical applicability of RL to real-world domains has been limited for two reasons.\nFirst, designing a suitable reward function for complex tasks can be extremely difficult.\nThe RL agent learns behaviors incentivized by the reward function rather than the ones intended, which can be nontrivial to specify in terms of reward. Second, the need for online interaction with the environment during the RL training loop has hindered its adoption in many real-world domains, where environment interactions are costly or risky. Imitation learning (IL)    circumvents the difficulty of reward design in RL by leveraging demonstrations given by experts, where the goal is to mimic the expert’s behavior.\nHowever, the standard IL requires the expert demonstrations to contain not only the state information (e.g. robot joint angles) but also the precise action (e.g. robot joint torques) executed by the expert at each time step.\nThis demand for explicit action labels is in contrast to the way human imitates (e.g. learning by watching videos) and precludes leveraging a massive amount of data in which the action label is missing.\nTherefore, developing an imitation learning algorithm that can learn from observing the experts’ state-only trajectories is a promising direction for creating a practical, autonomous intelligent agent.\nLearning from observation (LfO)  6 [ref]39  4 concerns this particular learning scenario and has been gaining interest in recent years. In this paper, we are particularly interested in solving the LfO problem in an offline setting: Given the state-only demonstrations by experts and abundant state-action demonstrations by imperfect agents of arbitrary levels of optimality, we aim to find a policy that follows the sequence of expert’s states without further interaction with the environment.\nThis problem setting is appealing in many practical situations where environment interactions are costly or risky.\nYet, it cannot be straightforwardly tackled by existing approaches. Most of the existing LfO methods are on-policy algorithms [ref]39 [ref]40  5, which is not directly applicable to the offline setting.\nOne of the few exceptions is BCO , which performs behavior cloning on the inferred action via an inverse dynamics model.\nThis method could be suboptimal unless the inverse dynamics disagreement is always zero, i.e. the underlying environment dynamics is deterministic and injective.\nAnother one is OPOLO , an off-policy LfO algorithm, but it relies on nested min-max optimization as well as out-of-distribution (OOD) action values,\nwhich can be unstable especially in the offline setting.\nIQ-Learn  solves an Inverse RL and can be applied to the offline LfO by learning a state-only reward function. However, it suffers from numerical instability due to using OOD action values in the offline setting.\nLastly, RCE , an example-based control algorithm, can in principle be applied to the offline LfO setting by providing the expert trajectories as successful example states; however, its empirical performance is known to be limited without online data collection. We present an offline LfO algorithm that minimizes the divergence between state-transition distributions induced by the expert and the learned policy,\nwithout requiring an inverse dynamics model.\nOur algorithm, offline Learning from OBServation via stationary DIstribution Correction Estimation (LobsDICE),\nessentially optimizes in the space of state-action stationary distributions and state-transition stationary distributions, rather than in the space of policies.\nWe show that our formulation can be reduced to a single convex minimization problem that can be solved efficiently in practice, unlike existing imitation learning (from observation) algorithms that rely on nested min-max optimization.\nIn the experiments, we demonstrate that LobsDICE can successfully recover the state visitations by the expert, outperforming strong baseline methods.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: algorithm that can learn from observing the experts’ state-only trajectories is a promising direction for creating a practical, autonomous intelligent agent.\nLearning from observation (LfO)  6 [ref]39  4 concerns this particular learning scenario and has been gaining interest in recent years.
