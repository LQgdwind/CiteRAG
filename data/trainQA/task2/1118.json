      "content": "Paper Title: Self-supervised Representation Learning for Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNeural architecture search (NAS) refers to the use of certain search strategies to find the best performing neural architecture in a pre-defined search space with minimum searching costs . The search strategies sample the potentially promising neural architectures from the search space and the performance metrics of the sampled architectures, obtained from time-consuming training and validation procedures, are used to optimize the search strategies. To alleviate the time cost of training and validation procedures, some recently proposed NAS search strategies employ neural predictors to accelerate the performance estimation of sampled architectures     . The capability of neural predictors to accurately predict the performance of sampled architectures is critical to downstream search strategies     .Because of the significant time cost of obtaining labeled training samples, how to acquire accurate neural predictors using a fewer number of training samples is one of the key issues in NAS methods employing neural predictors. Self-supervised representation learning, a type of unsupervised representation learning, has been successfully applied in areas such as image classification [ref]9 0 and natural language processing 1. If a model is pre-trained by an effective self-supervised representation learning and then fine-tuned by supervised learning using a few labeled training data, then it is highly likely to outperform its supervised counterparts [ref]9 0 2. In this paper, we novelty study and apply the self-supervised representation learning to the NAS domain to enhance the performance of neural predictors built from graph neural networks 3 and employ it to the downstream evolutionary search strategy. Effective unsupervised representation learning falls into one of two categories: generative or discriminative [ref]9. Existing unsupervised representation learning methods for NAS  4 belong to the generative category. Their learning objective is to make the neural predictor correctly reconstruct the input neural architecture, but it has limited relevance to NAS. This may result in the trained neural predictor producing a less effective representation of the input neural architecture. Discriminative unsupervised representation learning, also known as self-supervised learning, requires designing a pretext task 5 6 from an unlabeled dataset and using it as supervision to learn meaningful feature representation. Inspired by previous findings that “close by” architectures tend to have similar performance metrics 7 8, we adopt the graph edit distance (GED) as a supervision to carry out self-supervised learning because GED can reflect the distance of different neural architectures in the search space. Commonly used GED is computed based on the graph encoding of two different neural architectures (adjacency matrices and node operations) 7, but this scheme cannot identify isomorphic graphs. Path-based encoding  is another commonly used neural architecture encoding scheme, but it can not recognize the position of each operation in the neural architecture, e.g., two different operations in a neural architecture may have the same path-encoding vectors. To overcome the above drawbacks, we propose a new neural architecture encoding scheme denoted as position-aware path-based encoding, which can identify isomorphic graphs and recognize the position of different operations in neural architectures. Since different pretext tasks may lead to different feature representations, utilizing the GED, we devise two self-supervised learning methods from two different perspectives to improve the feature representation of neural architectures, and to investigate the effect of different pretext tasks on the predictive performance of neural predictors. The first method utilizes a handcrafted pretext task, while the second one learns feature representation by contrasting positive pairs against negative pairs. The pretext task of the first self-supervised learning method is to predict the normalized GED of two different neural architectures in the search space. We design a model with two independent identical branches and use the concatenation of their output features to predict the normalized GED. After the self-supervised pre-training, we adopt only one branch of the model to build neural predictor. This method is denoted as self-supervised regression learning. The second self-supervised learning method is inspired by the prevalently contrastive learning for image classification [ref]9 0 2, which maximizes the agreement between differently augmented views of the same image via a contrastive loss in the latent space [ref]9. Since there is no guarantee that a neural architecture and its transformed form will have the same performance metrics, it is not reasonable to directly apply the contrastive learning to NAS. We propose a new contrastive learning algorithm, termed central contrastive learning, that uses the feature vector of a neural architecture and its nearby neural architectures’ feature vectors (with small GEDs) to build a central feature vector. Then the contrastive loss is utilized to tightly aggregate the feature vectors of the architecture and its nearby architectures onto the central feature vector and push the feature vectors of other neural architectures away from the central feature vector. This method is indicated as self-supervised central contrastive learning. After self-supervised pre-training, two neural predictors are built by connecting a fully connected layer to the architecture embedding modules of the pre-trained models. Finally, we integrate the pre-trained neural predictors into the neural predictor guided evolution neural architecture search (NPENAS) algorithm  to verify their performance. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows. We present a new vector encoding scheme, termed position-aware path-based encoding, to overcome the drawbacks of the adjacency matrix encoding and path-based encoding methods. The scheme is more efficient than path-based encoding, and the experimental results illustrate its superiority to filter out isomorphic graphs. We propose a self-supervised regression learning method that defines a pretext task to predict the normalized GED of two different neural architectures and design a neural network with two independent identical branches to learn meaningful representation of neural architectures. After the self-supervised pre-training, a neural predictor is constructed and fine-tuned. The neural predictor pre-trained by this method achieves its performance upper bound with a small search budget and a few training epochs, and in the best case, achieves better performance using ten times less search budget than it supervised counterparts. We present a central contrastive learning algorithm that forces neural architectures with small GED to lean closer together in the feature space, while neural architectures with large GED divide further apart. When trained for more epochs, the pre-trained neural predictor fine-tuned with half search budget can achieve comparable performance to its supervised counterparts, and with the same search budget, the fine-tuned neural predictor outperforms their supervised counterparts by about 1.5 times. The proposed central contrastive learning algorithm can also be extended to the domain of graph unsupervised representation learning without any modifications.\n When integrating the pre-trained neural predictors to the NPENAS, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the NASBench-101 7 and NASBench-201 9 benchmarks. The searched neural architectures have comparable or equal results to the ORACLE baseline (performance upper bound).\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: NAS methods employing neural predictors.
