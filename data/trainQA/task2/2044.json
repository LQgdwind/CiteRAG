      "content": "Paper Title: Polygonal Point Set Tracking\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPoST. \nWe found only few works [ref]28 [ref]37 that perform a point tracking mechanism in their framework.\nFor completeness, we also compare our method against alternative methods such as optical flow-based tracking and patch tracking combined with a video object segmentation technique.\nIn the case of optical flow, the given point set is tracked through all frames by propagating each point following the flow map from a current state-of-the-art optical flow method .\nPatch tracking can also be used to track each point by extracting patches centered on given points.\nFor the patch tracking method, we can additionally guide the result to stick to the object boundary using object masks from the-state-of-the-art video object segmentation method, STM [ref]35.\nWe use CSRT  for the patch tracking here. Results of each method on PoST is reported in Table 2.\nAs the results show, our model yields superior performance compared with existing competitors in point set tracking in terms of SA and TA with entire thresholds.\nNote that patch tracking shows impressive results in terms of SA, but the outlines of the object were not preserved well in this setting. † reproduced with default setting. Video Object Segmentation Datasets. \nAlthough video object segmentation is not the main goal in this paper, our method can represent object contour using a polygonal point set.\nFor evaluation, we report performance on video object segmentation dataset, CPC  and DAVIS2016 . Quantitative results on CPC are summarized in Table 3.\nIn CPC, even though the performance is saturated due to the rigidity and the static motion of the targets in the dataset, our method shows a comparable accuracy with other methods.\nNote that STM [ref]35 aims to derive a region-based object mask thus does not track a point set.\nWe report the performance of CPC  only for a subset of the dataset as reported in the original paper, because their codes are not available.\nIn Roto++, we also test with two ground-truth keyframes of the first and last frames because interpolation between keyframes plays an important role in the mechanism.\nThe performance of ROAM [ref]37 is reported in two cases: the number reported in the original paper and our reproduced results with an official code in the default setting. For DAVIS2016 validation set, the performance of various methods is shown in Table 4.\nSince the dataset targets non-rigid object motion and occlusions, contour-based object segmentation methods inherently have many challenges on this dataset.\nDespite the limitation, our method outperforms other point set tracking approaches with significant gaps in all metrics. Runtime Performance.\nTable 5 shows runtime performance on DAVIS2016.\nWe use GeForce TITAN X as in [ref]37.\nOur method is the fastest one among other point set tracking approaches.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: PoST. \nWe found only few works [ref]28 [ref]37 that perform a point tracking mechanism in their framework.\nFor completeness, we also compare our method against alternative methods such as optical flow-based tracking and patch\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
