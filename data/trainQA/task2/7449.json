      "content": "Paper Title: LOSS-GAT: Label Propagation and One-Class Semi-Supervised Graph Attention Network for Fake News Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe pervasive challenge of fake news in the digital era has prompted substantial research into effective detection and mitigation strategies. Researchers have explored various approaches, including natural language processing, machine learning, network analysis, and social media mining. This section provides a summary of the literature, emphasizing semi-supervised methods, which hold promise for leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data in fake news detection. Dong et al.  introduced a two-path deep semi-supervised learning framework for fake news detection in social media, using shared Convolutional Neural Networks.\nTheir model collaboratively optimizes loss functions to enhance accuracy with sparse labeled data.\nKonkobo et al.  proposed a semi-supervised model for early fake news detection, utilizing three neural networks and four key components, including opinion extraction, user credibility assessment, hierarchical clustering for user networks and a semi-supervised news classifier.\nThe DEFD-SSL method  employs diverse deep learners, augmentations, and distribution-aware pseudo-labeling with a hybrid loss function for balanced accuracy in imbalanced datasets\nand benefits from ensemble learning and distribution alignment.\nSLD-CNN  integrates CNNs with linear discriminant analysis, iteratively predicting labels for unlabeled data with an impact factor for effective error control. Meel et al. [ref]24 proposed a semi-supervised CNN framework for fake news classification, leveraging linguistic and stylometric information with self-ensembling and Temporal Ensembling to enhance the accuracy.\nCross-SEAN  is a neural attention model that combines cross-stitch units with semi-supervised learning, integrating unlabeled data, external knowledge, tweet and user features, and adversarial training for both supervised and unsupervised loss.\nLi et al.  presented a self-learning semi-supervised deep learning network for detecting social media fake news. Featuring a confidence layer, it autonomously boosts accuracy by incorporating accurate results, proving advantageous for incomplete or limited datasets.\nYang  introduced an approach for COVID-19-related fake news on social media, using a text graph constructed from tweet similarity. The method employs a graph neural network to classify fake news, reducing the need for extensive labeled data. Hu et al. [ref]28 introduced M-GCN, a framework for detecting fake news in short articles. It employs graph embedding, multi-depth GCN blocks, and an attention mechanism to combine multi-scale features, treating each news article as a node and leveraging speaker profiles for relationship networks.\nRen et al.  presented AA-HGNN, a model using a hierarchical attention mechanism in a heterogeneous information network with active learning for improved performance in data-scarce scenarios. It uses a two-level attention mechanism in a classifier and a selector, working together adversarially to enhance label quality and candidate selection.\nBenamira et al.  embedded articles, constructed an article similarity graph using a k-nearest-neighbors approach and employed Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Attention Networks for classification on the similarity graph.\nFaustini and Covoes  employed an OCL approach, training their model exclusively on fake news data. They introduced DCDistanceOCC, a novel algorithm highlighting OCL’s effectiveness in discerning fake news across various text types.\nGôlo et al.  introduced a multimodal OCL approach\nfor fake news detection, utilizing Multimodal Variational Autoencoders (MVAEs) that learn from language, linguistic, and topic features. In , tensor decomposition creates embeddings for news articles, forming a graph where known labels are propagated, transforming fake news detection into a semi-supervised problem.\nXie et al. [ref]33 introduced LNMT, a Label Noise-Resistant Mean Teaching approach for weakly supervised fake news detection. It uses unlabeled news data and user feedback comments to generate improved weak labels, employing a two-stage training process with a baseline model to reduce noise impact.\nDe Souza et al.  introduced a fake news detection approach using Positive and Unlabeled Learning by Label Propagation (PU-LP), a transductive, semi-supervised algorithm adapted for text classification. They proposed network representations incorporating news objects and key n-grams to enhance the model, aiming to minimize labeling efforts, improve text classification accuracy, and leverage network structures for effective information extraction from unlabeled documents in fake news detection. Our approach builds upon the foundation established in  by de Souza et al. We integrate three influential techniques: Graph Neural Networks, One-Class Learning, and Label Propagation. This synergy harnesses their strengths to effectively tackle the intricate challenges associated with the spread of fake news in the digital era.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: distribution alignment.\nSLD-CNN  integrates CNNs with linear discriminant analysis, iteratively predicting labels for unlabeled data with an impact factor for effective error control.
