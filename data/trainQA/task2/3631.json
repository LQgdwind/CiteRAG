      "content": "Paper Title: Dense Siamese Network for Dense Unsupervised Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe comparison on transfer learning in dense prediction tasks between DenseSiam and previous unsupervised representation learning methods  [ref]20  [ref]48  [ref]10 is shown in Table 2.\nThe results of scratch, supervised, MoCo v2 , DenseCL [ref]48, SimCLR , and BYOL [ref]20 are reported from DenseCL [ref]48.\nFor fair comparison, we fine-tune the model of ReSim-C4  using the similar setting (Sec. 5.1).\nThe model checkpoint is released by the paper authors111https://github.com/Tete-Xiao/ReSim.\nWe report the results of SimSiam [ref]10, DetCo , and PixPro  based on our re-implementation. COCO Instance Segmentation and Detection.\nAs shown in the first two columns of Table 2,\nDenseSiam outperforms SimSiam by 0.4 APmaskmask{}^{\\text{mask}} on COCO instance segmentation.\nThe improvements over SimSiam is on-par with that of DenseCL and DetCo over MoCo v2 (0.4 vs. 0.3 APmaskmask{}^{\\text{mask}})\nand is better than ReSim (0.4 vs. 0 APmaskmask{}^{\\text{mask}}).\nThis further verifies the effectiveness of DenseSiam.\nNotably, DenseSiam outperforms ReSim, DetCo, DenseCL, and PixPro by 0.7, 0.4, 0.4, and 0.2 APmaskmask{}^{\\text{mask}}, respectively.\nThe results in COCO object detection is consistent with that in instance segmentation. Cityscapes Semantic Segmentation.\nWe compare DenseSiam with previous methods on semantic segmentation on Cityscapes dataset  and report the mean IoU (mIoU) of fine-tuned models.\nDenseSiam surpasses SimSiam by 0.7 mIoU and\noutperforms previous dense representation learning methods ReSim, DetCo, DenseCL, and PixPro by 0.2, 0.5, 1.3, and 0.7 mIoU, respectively.\nNotably, image-level unsupervised method such as SimCLR , BYOL [ref]20 and SimSiam [ref]10 show considerable performance gap against\ndense unsupervised methods including DenseSiam, DenseCL, and ReSim, indicating that pre-training with image-level similarity learning is sub-optimal for dense prediction tasks. PASCAL VOC Object Detection.\nWe further compare DenseSiam with previous methods on PASCAL VOC  object detection.\nWe report the original metric AP5050{}_{\\text{50}} (AP calculated with IoU threshold 0.5) of VOC and further report COCO-style AP  and AP7575{}_{\\text{75}},\nwhich are stricter criteria in evaluating the detection performance.\nDenseSiam show a large improvement of 1.8 AP in comparison with SimSiam [ref]10.\nNotably, DenseSiam exhibits considerable improvements on AP7575{}_{\\text{75}} than AP5050{}_{\\text{50}},\nsuggesting the effectiveness of DenseSiam in learning accurate spatial information.\nIts improvement over SimSiam is more than that of DetCo  (0.8 AP) over MoCo v2, and is on-par with those of DenseCL [ref]48 and ReSim  over MoCo v2 . DenseCL, ReSim, and PixPro are 0.2, 0.2, and 1.0 AP better than DenseSiam, respectively.\nThis phenomenon contradicts the results in the benchmarks of COCO dataset,\nalthough their improvements over their image-level counterparts are consistent across benchmarks.\nWe hypothesize that the different backbones used in the two benchmarks leads to this phenomenon, where ResNet-50-C4 backbone  is used on PASCAL VOC but ResNet-50-FPN  is used on COCO.\nThe hypothesis also explains the inferior performance of DetCo :\nDetCo conducts contrastive learning on pyramid features but only one feature scale is used when fine-tuning Faster R-CNN on PASCAL VOC dataset.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: The comparison on transfer learning in dense prediction tasks between DenseSiam and previous unsupervised representation learning methods  [ref]20  [ref]48  [ref]10 is shown in Table 2.\nThe results of scratch, supervised, MoCo v2 , DenseCL [ref]48, SimCLR , and BYOL [ref]20 are reported from DenseCL [ref]48.\nFor fair comparison, we\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
