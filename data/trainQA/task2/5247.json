      "content": "Paper Title: Many-valued Argumentation, Conditionals and a Probabilistic Semantics for Gradual Argumentation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe strong relations between the notions of coherent, faithfull and φ𝜑\\varphi-coherent labellings of a gradual argumentation graph and the\ncorresponding semantics of weighted conditional knowledge bases have suggested\nan approach for defeasible reasoning over a weighted argumentation graph  2, which builds on the semantics of the argumentation graph. Given an argumentation graph G𝐺G and a gradual argumentation semantics S𝑆S,\nwe define a preferential (many-valued) interpretation of the argumentation graph G𝐺G, with respect to the gradual semantics S𝑆S.\nIn the following, we first consider a propositional language to represent boolean combination of arguments and a many-valued semantics for it on the domain of argument valuation. Then, we extend the language with a typicality operator, to introduce defeasible implications over boolean combinations of arguments and define a (multi-)preferential interpretation associated with the argumentation graph G𝐺G and the argumentation semantics S𝑆S.\nA similar extension with typicality of a propositional language has, for instance, been considered for the two-valued case in the Propositional Typicality Logic . Let us consider an argumentation graph G=⟨𝒜,ℛ,π⟩𝐺𝒜ℛ𝜋G=\\langle\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{R},\\pi\\rangle, which may be weighted or not, and some gradual argumentation semantics S𝑆S for G𝐺G. In case the graph is not weighted, we let π​(B,A)=−1𝜋𝐵𝐴1\\pi(B,A)=-1 mean that argument B𝐵B attacks argument A𝐴A, and π​(B,A)=+1𝜋𝐵𝐴1\\pi(B,A)=+1 mean that argument B𝐵B supports argument A𝐴A.\nWe refer to  for a classification and the properties of gradual semantics when the argumentation graph is not weighted. We introduce a propositional language ℒℒ\\mathcal{L}, whose set of propositional variables P​r​o​p𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑝Prop is the set of arguments 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}.\nAssume our language ℒℒ\\mathcal{L} contains the connectives ∧\\wedge, ∨\\vee, ¬\\neg and →→\\rightarrow, and that propositional formulas are defined inductively from the set of propositional variables, as usual. Propositional formulas, when restricted to the propositional variables in 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}, correspond to boolean combination of arguments, which have been considered, for instance, by Hunter et al. . We will use α,β,γ𝛼𝛽𝛾\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma to denote boolean combination of arguments. Let 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} be a truth degree set, equipped with a preorder relation ≤\\leq.\nThis choice for the domain of argument valuations has been proposed by Baroni et al.  as it is general enough to include the domain of argument valuations in most gradual argumentation semantics.\nLet the truth set 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} be the domain of argument valuation of a gradual semantics S𝑆S for the argumentation graph G𝐺G.\nWe let ⊗tensor-product\\otimes, ⊕direct-sum\\oplus, ⊳contains-as-subgroup\\rhd and ⊖symmetric-difference\\ominus be\nthe truth degree functions in 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} for the connectives ∧\\wedge, ∨\\vee, ¬\\neg and →→\\rightarrow (respectively).\nFor instance, when 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} is [ref]0 [ref]0  or the finite set 𝒞nsubscript𝒞𝑛\\mathcal{C}_{n}, ⊗tensor-product\\otimes, ⊕direct-sum\\oplus, ⊳contains-as-subgroup\\rhd and ⊖symmetric-difference\\ominus can be chosed as a t-norm, s-norm, implication function, and negation function in some well known system of many-valued logic . A labelling σ:𝒜→𝒮:𝜎→𝒜𝒮\\sigma:\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{S} assigns to each argument Ai∈𝒜subscript𝐴𝑖𝒜A_{i}\\in\\mathcal{A} a truth degree in 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S}, that is,\nσ𝜎\\sigma is a many-valued valuation.\nA valuation σ𝜎\\sigma can be inductively extended to all propositional formulas of L𝐿L as follows: σ​(α∧β)=σ​(α)⊗σ​(β)𝜎𝛼𝛽tensor-product𝜎𝛼𝜎𝛽\\sigma(\\alpha\\wedge\\beta)=\\sigma(\\alpha)\\otimes\\sigma(\\beta)\n                    σ​(α∨β)=σ​(α)⊕σ​(β)𝜎𝛼𝛽direct-sum𝜎𝛼𝜎𝛽\\sigma(\\alpha\\vee\\beta)=\\sigma(\\alpha)\\oplus\\sigma(\\beta) σ​(α→β)=σ​(α)⊳σ​(β)𝜎→𝛼𝛽contains-as-subgroup𝜎𝛼𝜎𝛽\\sigma(\\alpha\\rightarrow\\beta)=\\sigma(\\alpha)\\rhd\\sigma(\\beta)\n                  σ​(¬α)=⊖σ​(α)𝜎𝛼symmetric-difference𝜎𝛼\\sigma(\\neg\\alpha)=\\ominus\\sigma(\\alpha) Based on the choice of the combination functions, a labelling σ𝜎\\sigma uniquely assigns a truth degree to any boolean combination of arguments. In the following we will assume that the false argument ⊥bottom\\bot and the true argument ⊤top\\top are formulas of L𝐿L and that σ​(⊥)=0𝜎bottom0\\sigma(\\bot)=0 and σ​(⊤)=1𝜎top1\\sigma(\\top)=1, for all labellings σ𝜎\\sigma. Let ΣΣ\\Sigma be a set of labellings of a weighted argumentation graph G=⟨𝒜,ℛ,π⟩𝐺𝒜ℛ𝜋G=\\langle\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{R},\\pi\\rangle, e.g., the labellings of G𝐺G under a given gradual semantics S𝑆S with domain of argument valuation 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S}.\nAs an example, ΣΣ\\Sigma may be the set of the finitely-valued φ𝜑\\varphi-coherent labellings of the graph G𝐺G with values in 𝒞nsubscript𝒞𝑛\\mathcal{C}_{n}. Given a set of labellings ΣΣ\\Sigma, for each argument Ai∈𝒜subscript𝐴𝑖𝒜A_{i}\\in\\mathcal{A} , we can define a preference relation <Aisubscriptsubscript𝐴𝑖<_{A_{i}} on ΣΣ\\Sigma, as follows: where << is the strict partial order on 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} defined from the preorder ≤\\leq as usual\n(a<b​ iff ​a≤b​ and ​b≰a𝑎𝑏 iff 𝑎𝑏 and 𝑏not-less-than-or-equals𝑎a<b\\mbox{ iff }a\\leq b\\mbox{ and }b\\not\\leq a).\nThe labelling σ𝜎\\sigma is preferred to labelling σ′superscript𝜎′\\sigma^{\\prime} with respect to argument Aisubscript𝐴𝑖A_{i} (or σ𝜎\\sigma is more plausible than σ′superscript𝜎′\\sigma^{\\prime} for argument Aisubscript𝐴𝑖A_{i}), when the degree of truth of Aisubscript𝐴𝑖A_{i} in σ𝜎\\sigma is greater than the degree of truth of Aisubscript𝐴𝑖A_{i} in σ′superscript𝜎′\\sigma^{\\prime}.\nThe preference relation <Aisubscriptsubscript𝐴𝑖<_{A_{i}} is a strict partial order relation on ΣΣ\\Sigma.\nWhen ≤\\leq is a total preorder on 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S},\n<Aisubscriptsubscript𝐴𝑖<_{A_{i}} is also modular, that is, for all σ′,σ′′,σ′′′∈Σsuperscript𝜎′superscript𝜎′′superscript𝜎′′′Σ\\sigma^{\\prime},\\sigma^{\\prime\\prime},\\sigma^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}\\in\\Sigma, σ′<Aiσ′′subscriptsubscript𝐴𝑖superscript𝜎′superscript𝜎′′\\sigma^{\\prime}<_{A_{i}}\\sigma^{\\prime\\prime} implies (σ′<Aiσ′′′subscriptsubscript𝐴𝑖superscript𝜎′superscript𝜎′′′\\sigma^{\\prime}<_{A_{i}}\\sigma^{\\prime\\prime\\prime} or σ′′′<Aiσ′′subscriptsubscript𝐴𝑖superscript𝜎′′′superscript𝜎′′\\sigma^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}<_{A_{i}}\\sigma^{\\prime\\prime}).\nFor instance, when 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} is equal to [ref]0 [ref]0  or to 𝒞nsubscript𝒞𝑛\\mathcal{C}_{n}, <Aisubscriptsubscript𝐴𝑖<_{A_{i}} is a strict modular partial order relation. When the set ΣΣ\\Sigma is infinite, <Aisubscriptsubscript𝐴𝑖<_{A_{i}} is not guaranteed to be well-founded, as there may be infinitely-descending chains of labellings\nσ2<Aiσ1subscriptsubscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝜎2subscript𝜎1\\sigma_{2}<_{A_{i}}\\sigma_{1},\nσ3<Aiσ2subscriptsubscript𝐴𝑖subscript𝜎3subscript𝜎2\\sigma_{3}<_{A_{i}}\\sigma_{2}, ……\\ldots.\nIn the following, we will restrict our consideration to sets of labellings ΣΣ\\Sigma such that <Aisubscriptsubscript𝐴𝑖<_{A_{i}} is well-founded for all arguments Aisubscript𝐴𝑖A_{i} in ΣΣ\\Sigma. We will call ΣΣ\\Sigma a well-founded set of labellings. The definition of preference over arguments which is induced by a set of labellings ΣΣ\\Sigma also extends to boolean combination of arguments α𝛼\\alpha in the obvious way,\ngiven a choice of combination functions. A set of labellings ΣΣ\\Sigma induces a preference relation <αsubscript𝛼<_{\\alpha} on ΣΣ\\Sigma, for each boolean combination of arguments α𝛼\\alpha, as follows: σ<ασ′​ iff ​σ′​(α)<σ​(α)subscript𝛼𝜎superscript𝜎′ iff superscript𝜎′𝛼𝜎𝛼\\sigma<_{\\alpha}\\sigma^{\\prime}\\mbox{ iff }\\sigma^{\\prime}(\\alpha)<\\sigma(\\alpha).\nNote that if <Aisubscriptsubscript𝐴𝑖<_{A_{i}} is well-founded for all arguments Aisubscript𝐴𝑖A_{i} in σ′superscript𝜎′\\sigma^{\\prime}, it is well-founded for all boolean combination of arguments α𝛼\\alpha. We now define a notion of preferential interpretation over many-valued valuations, which relates to preferential interpretations in KLM preferential logics and, when preferences <Aisubscriptsubscript𝐴𝑖<_{A_{i}} are modular, to ranked interpretations .\nAs seen above, here preferences are defined over many-valued labellings, rather than over two-valued propositional valuations.\nA further difference with KLM approach is that the semantics exploits multiple preferences (one for each argument) rather than a single one, being then a multi-preferential semantics. Some multi-preferential semantics for KLM conditional logics have been considered in 1 ,\nand, for ranked and weighted knowledge bases in fuzzy description logics in 5.  Given an argumentation graph G=⟨𝒜,G=\\langle\\mathcal{A}, ℛ,π⟩\\mathcal{R},\\pi\\rangle,\nand ΣΣ\\Sigma a set of labellings of G𝐺G, in some gradual semantics of G𝐺G with the domain of argument valuation 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S},\na preferential interpretation of G𝐺G wrt. ΣΣ\\Sigma, is a pair I=(𝒮,Σ)𝐼𝒮ΣI=(\\mathcal{S},\\Sigma),\nwhere ΣΣ\\Sigma is a set of labellings σ:𝒜→𝒮:𝜎→𝒜𝒮\\sigma:\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{S}. Note that preference relations <αsubscript𝛼<_{\\alpha} in I𝐼I are left implicit, as they are induced by the set of labellings in ΣΣ\\Sigma. A unary typicality operator 𝐓𝐓{\\bf T} can be added to the language L𝐿L. We will call the extended language L𝐓superscript𝐿𝐓L^{\\bf T}, and the associated many-valued logic with typicality ℒ𝐓superscriptℒ𝐓\\mathcal{L}^{\\bf T}.\nIntuitively, as in the Propositional Typicality Logic, “a sentence of the form 𝐓​(α)𝐓𝛼{\\bf T}(\\alpha) is understood to refer to the typical situations in which α𝛼\\alpha holds” . The typicality operator allows the formulation of conditional implications (or defeasible implications) of the form 𝐓​(α)→β→𝐓𝛼𝛽{\\bf T}(\\alpha)\\rightarrow\\beta, whose meaning is that ”normally, if α𝛼\\alpha then β𝛽\\beta”, where α𝛼\\alpha and β𝛽\\beta are boolean combination of arguments. In the two-valued case such implications correspond to conditional implications α∣∼β\\alpha\\mathrel{{\\scriptstyle\\mid\\!\\sim}}\\beta of KLM preferential logics .\nAs usual , we do not allow nesting of the typicality operator.\nWhen α𝛼\\alpha and β𝛽\\beta do not contain occurrences of the typicality operator, an implication α→β→𝛼𝛽\\alpha\\rightarrow\\beta is called strict.\nIn the following, we do not restrict our consideration to strict or defeasible implications, but we allow in the language L𝐓superscript𝐿𝐓L^{\\bf T} general implications of the form α→β→𝛼𝛽\\alpha\\rightarrow\\beta, where α𝛼\\alpha and β𝛽\\beta are boolean combination of arguments which may contain (unnested) occurrences of the typicality operator. The interpretation of a typicality formula 𝐓​(α)𝐓𝛼{\\bf T}(\\alpha) is defined with respect to a preferential interpretation I=(𝒮,Σ)𝐼𝒮ΣI=(\\mathcal{S},\\Sigma).\nWe define the truth degree of a typicality formula 𝐓​(α)𝐓𝛼{\\bf T}(\\alpha) in a valuation σ∈Σ𝜎Σ\\sigma\\in\\Sigma of the preferential interpretation I=(𝒮,Σ)𝐼𝒮ΣI=(\\mathcal{S},\\Sigma) taking into account all labellings in ΣΣ\\Sigma.\nIn the next definition we are assuming the set of labellings ΣΣ\\Sigma to be well-founded. Given a preferential interpretation I=(𝒮,Σ)𝐼𝒮ΣI=(\\mathcal{S},\\Sigma), and a labelling σ∈Σ𝜎Σ\\sigma\\in\\Sigma, the valuation of a propositional formula 𝐓​(α)𝐓𝛼{\\bf T}(\\alpha) in σ𝜎\\sigma is defined as follows: where min<α(Σ)={σ:σ∈Σmin_{<_{\\alpha}}(\\Sigma)=\\{\\sigma:\\sigma\\in\\Sigma and ∄​σ′∈Σnot-existssuperscript𝜎′Σ\\nexists\\sigma^{\\prime}\\in\\Sigma s.t. σ′<ασ}\\sigma^{\\prime}<_{\\alpha}\\sigma\\}. The truth value of 𝐓​(α)𝐓𝛼{\\bf T}(\\alpha) in σ∈Σ𝜎Σ\\sigma\\in\\Sigma depends on the whole set of labellings ΣΣ\\Sigma in the preferential interpretation I𝐼I.\nWhen (𝐓​(A))I​(σ)>0superscript𝐓𝐴𝐼𝜎0({\\bf T}(A))^{I}(\\sigma)>0, σ𝜎\\sigma is a labelling assigning a maximal degree of acceptability to argument A𝐴A in I𝐼I.\ni.e., it is a labelling maximizing the acceptability of argument A𝐴A, among all the labellings in I𝐼I.\nSimilarly, in Propositional Typicality Logic , the evaluation of a typicality formula in a preferential interpretation depends on the set of all propositional valuations in the interpretation. Observe that, with the definition above, we are departing from previous semantics of typicality in the fuzzy and many-valued description logics 5 , as we are not defining a two-valued interpretation for 𝐓​(A)𝐓𝐴{\\bf T}(A). The typicality operator is not simply intended to single out those labellings σ∈Σ𝜎Σ\\sigma\\in\\Sigma which maximize the acceptability degree of argument A𝐴A, but it assigns a truth degree to 𝐓​(A)𝐓𝐴{\\bf T}(A) in σ𝜎\\sigma which may be different from 00 or 111. Given a preferential interpretation I=(𝒮,Σ)𝐼𝒮ΣI=(\\mathcal{S},\\Sigma), where the labellings in ΣΣ\\Sigma have domain of argument valuation 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} we can now define the satisfiability in I𝐼I of a graded implication, having the form α→β≥l→𝛼𝛽𝑙\\alpha\\rightarrow\\beta\\geq l or α→β≤u→𝛼𝛽𝑢\\alpha\\rightarrow\\beta\\leq u, for l𝑙l and u𝑢u values in 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S}.\nWe first define the truth degree of an implication α→β→𝛼𝛽\\alpha\\rightarrow\\beta wrt. a preferential interpretation I𝐼I. Given a preferential interpretation I=(𝒮,Σ)𝐼𝒮ΣI=(\\mathcal{S},\\Sigma) associated with an argumentation graph G𝐺G,\nthe truth degree of an implication α→β→𝛼𝛽\\alpha\\rightarrow\\beta wrt. I𝐼I is defined as follows: (α→β)I=i​n​fσ∈Σ​(σ​(α)⊳σ​(β))superscript→𝛼𝛽𝐼𝑖𝑛subscript𝑓𝜎Σcontains-as-subgroup𝜎𝛼𝜎𝛽(\\alpha\\rightarrow\\beta)^{I}=inf_{\\sigma\\in\\Sigma}(\\sigma(\\alpha)\\rhd\\sigma(\\beta)) As a special case, for defeasible implications, we have that: (𝐓​(α)→β)I=i​n​fσ∈Σ​(σ​(𝐓​(α))⊳σ​(β))superscript→𝐓𝛼𝛽𝐼𝑖𝑛subscript𝑓𝜎Σcontains-as-subgroup𝜎𝐓𝛼𝜎𝛽({\\bf T}(\\alpha)\\rightarrow\\beta)^{I}=inf_{\\sigma\\in\\Sigma}(\\sigma({\\bf T}(\\alpha))\\rhd\\sigma(\\beta)) meaning that in the most typical situations (labellings) in which α𝛼\\alpha holds, β𝛽\\beta also holds.\nNote that the interpretation of an implication (and of a defeasible implication) is defined globally wrt. a preferential interpretation I𝐼I, and it is based on the whole set of labellings ΣΣ\\Sigma in I=(𝒮,Σ)𝐼𝒮ΣI=(\\mathcal{S},\\Sigma). This is similar to the interpretation of conditionals A∣∼BA\\mathrel{{\\scriptstyle\\mid\\!\\sim}}B in a preferential model in KLM preferential semantics  , as the semantics of conditional formulas depends (globally) on the set of propositional valuations in the preferential model as well as on the preference relation. We can now define the satisfiability of a graded implication in a preferential interpretation I=(𝒮,Σ)𝐼𝒮ΣI=(\\mathcal{S},\\Sigma). Given a preferential interpretation I=(𝒮,Σ)𝐼𝒮ΣI=(\\mathcal{S},\\Sigma) of an argumentation graph G𝐺G,\nI𝐼I satisfies a graded implication α→β≥l→𝛼𝛽𝑙\\alpha\\rightarrow\\beta\\geq l (written I⊧α→β≥lmodels𝐼𝛼→𝛽𝑙I\\models\\alpha\\rightarrow\\beta\\geq l) iff (α→β)I≥lsuperscript→𝛼𝛽𝐼𝑙(\\alpha\\rightarrow\\beta)^{I}\\geq l;\nI𝐼I satisfies a graded implication α→β≤u→𝛼𝛽𝑢\\alpha\\rightarrow\\beta\\leq u (written I⊧α→β≤umodels𝐼𝛼→𝛽𝑢I\\models\\alpha\\rightarrow\\beta\\leq u) iff (α→β)I≤usuperscript→𝛼𝛽𝐼𝑢(\\alpha\\rightarrow\\beta)^{I}\\leq u. Notice that the valuation of a graded implication (e.g., α→β≥l→𝛼𝛽𝑙\\alpha\\rightarrow\\beta\\geq l) in a preferential interpretation I𝐼I is two-valued (that is, either the graded implication is satisfied in I𝐼I (i.e., I⊧α→β≥lmodels𝐼𝛼→𝛽𝑙I\\models\\alpha\\rightarrow\\beta\\geq l) or it is not (i.e.,\nI⊧̸α→β≥lnot-models𝐼𝛼→𝛽𝑙I\\not\\models\\alpha\\rightarrow\\beta\\geq l). Hence, it is natural to consider boolean combinations of graded implications, such as the following ones: (𝐓(A1)→A2∧A3≤0.3)∧(𝐓(A3∨A1)→A4)≥0.6)({\\bf T}(A_{1})\\rightarrow A_{2}\\wedge A_{3}\\leq 0.3)\\wedge({\\bf T}(A_{3}\\vee A_{1})\\rightarrow A_{4})\\geq 0.6), and (𝐓(A1)→A2∧A3≤0.3)→(𝐓(A1)→A4)≥0.6)({\\bf T}(A_{1})\\rightarrow A_{2}\\wedge A_{3}\\leq 0.3)\\rightarrow({\\bf T}(A_{1})\\rightarrow A_{4})\\geq 0.6), and define their satisfiability in an interpretation I𝐼I in the obvious way, based on the semantics of classical propositional logic.\nFor two graded implications, ψ𝜓\\psi and η𝜂\\eta, we have: I⊧ψ∧ηmodels𝐼𝜓𝜂I\\models\\psi\\wedge\\eta iff I⊧ψmodels𝐼𝜓I\\models\\psi and I⊧ηmodels𝐼𝜂I\\models\\eta; I⊧ψ∨ηmodels𝐼𝜓𝜂I\\models\\psi\\vee\\eta iff I⊧ψmodels𝐼𝜓I\\models\\psi or I⊧ηmodels𝐼𝜂I\\models\\eta; I⊧¬ψmodels𝐼𝜓I\\models\\neg\\psi iff I⊧̸ψnot-models𝐼𝜓I\\not\\models\\psi and similarly for all other classical logic connectives111Here, we have used the same names for the boolean connectives ∧,∨,¬→→absent\\wedge,\\vee,\\neg\\rightarrow over graded implications and for the many-values connectives ∧,∨,¬→→absent\\wedge,\\vee,\\neg\\rightarrow over boolean combination of arguments.\nHowever, there is no ambiguity on their interpretation, which only depends on their occurrence.. Given a specific semantics S𝑆S of a weighted argumentation graph G𝐺G, with domain of argument valuation 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S}, if the set of labellings ΣΣ\\Sigma of G𝐺G in S𝑆S is well-founded, we let IS=(𝒮,Σ)superscript𝐼𝑆𝒮ΣI^{S}=(\\mathcal{S},\\Sigma) be the preferential interpretation of G𝐺G with respect to the gradual semantics S𝑆S. Some gradual semantics assume a base score (or basic weight) σ0subscript𝜎0\\sigma_{0}, which is a function\nσ0:𝒜→𝒮:subscript𝜎0→𝒜𝒮\\sigma_{0}:\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{S} assigning to each argument A∈𝒜𝐴𝒜A\\in\\mathcal{A} its basic strength.\nA gradual semantics can then be defined with respect to an argumentation graph and a base score σ0subscript𝜎0\\sigma_{0} (see    for the description of general frameworks and references to the many proposals). For such argumentation semantics S𝑆S, a set of labellings Σσ0SsubscriptsuperscriptΣ𝑆subscript𝜎0\\Sigma^{S}_{\\sigma_{0}} can be associated to a given choice σ0subscript𝜎0\\sigma_{0} of the base score, and\na preferential interpretation\nIS=(𝒮,ΣS)superscript𝐼𝑆𝒮superscriptΣ𝑆I^{S}=(\\mathcal{S},\\Sigma^{S}) can be defined for a semantics S𝑆S by considering the labellings for all the possible choices of the base score σ0subscript𝜎0\\sigma_{0}, or for some of them (the choices satisfying some conditions), or for a single one. The preferential interpretation ISsuperscript𝐼𝑆I^{S} can be used to validate (under the semantics S𝑆S) properties of interest of an argumentation graph G𝐺G, expressed by graded implications (including strict or defeasible implications or their boolean combination) based on the semantics S𝑆S. When the preferential interpretation ISsuperscript𝐼𝑆I^{S} is finite (i.e., contains a finite set of labellings), the satisfiability\nof graded implications (or their boolean combinations) can be verified by model checking over the preferential interpretation ISsuperscript𝐼𝑆I^{S}. In case there are infinitely many labellings of the graph in the semantics S𝑆S, which may give rise to non well-founded preference relations associated to arguments, approximations of the semantics S𝑆S over a finite domain, can be considered for proving properties of the argumentation graph. In the next section, as a proof of concept, we consider the model checking problem for the argumentation semantics based on φ𝜑\\varphi-coherent finitely-valued labellings introduced in Section 2 in the case 𝒮=𝒞n𝒮subscript𝒞𝑛\\mathcal{S}=\\mathcal{C}_{n}, for an integer n≥1𝑛1n\\geq 1.\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: and ⊖symmetric-difference\\ominus be\nthe truth degree functions in 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} for the connectives ∧\\wedge, ∨\\vee, ¬\\neg and →→\\rightarrow (respectively).\nFor instance, when 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} is [ref]0 [ref]0  or the finite set 𝒞nsubscript𝒞𝑛\\mathcal{C}_{n}, ⊗tensor-product\\otimes, ⊕direct-sum\\oplus, ⊳contains-as-subgroup\\rhd and ⊖symmetric-difference\\ominus can be chosed as a t-norm, s-norm,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
