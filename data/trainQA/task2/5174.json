      "content": "Paper Title: Federated Learning for 5G Base Station Traffic Forecasting\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTime-series forecasting has a wide range of applications in various industries and lots of practical applications. To comply with regulations and reduce computation and communication overhead, federated learning has also been explored in the context of time-series prediction. Taik et al. 4 employed a federated LSTM model for the household load forecasting task. After generating the global model, participants perform a fine-tuning step using their local data to achieve personalization. Liu et al. 5 proposed FedGRU with the FedAvg algorithm [ref]8 to predict the number of vehicles in an area. Before initiating federated training, the participating entities form clusters using the K-Means algorithm. After grouping, participants train a global model for each cluster. Liu et al.  introduced a federated attention-based CNN-LSTM model for anomaly detection using time-series data with the FedAvg algorithm. In addition, the communication cost of federated training is minimized using a selection-based gradient compression algorithm. Briggs et al.  proposed FedLSTM applied to load forecasting similar to 4. FedLSTM integrates exogenous data such as weather information and applies a clustering step among participating entities by considering the weight similarity of local models. Fekri et al.  adapted LSTM to the federated setting and used FedAvg and FedSGD [ref]8 for the load forecasting task, similar to . Before training, the data owners perform local preprocessing, i.e., participants execute feature scaling locally. In this work, we argue that local scaling leads to inconsistencies during training and we show that global scaling results in lower forecasting error. Similarly,  used a FedLSTM to predict traffic load for inter-slice resource orchestration, considering a differentiated loss for overestimated and underestimated model predictions. All of the previous works in federated time-series forecasting do not raise the issue of non-iid data and evaluate the generated global models only using the FedAvg algorithm. In this work, we raise the challenge of training federated models under the presence of four categories of non-iid data, evaluate different aggregation functions and show that local preprocessing techniques can lead to higher predictive accuracy. In addition, similar works only adapt a single neural network architecture to the federated setting, e.g., LSTM 4    or GRU 5. Hence, insights regarding different federated models applied to time-series forecasting have yet to be provided. We emphasize that in our use case, the participating entities (base stations) are limited to three and therefore, clustered federated learning 5  cannot be directly applied. Finally, since federated learning requires several rounds of operations, many studies review the environmental impact of federated learning regarding energy consumption and C‚ÄãO2‚Äãe‚Äãqùê∂subscriptùëÇ2ùëíùëûCO_{2eq} emissions 9. In our experiments we measure the communication cost regarding the total uplink and downlink transmission of model weights and the energy consumption for training the global model with respect to the carbon footprint (C‚ÄãO2‚Äãe‚Äãqùê∂subscriptùëÇ2ùëíùëûCO_{2eq}).\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: forecasting task.
