      "content": "Paper Title: Category Query Learning for Human-Object Interaction Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHuman-Object Interaction (HOI) detection has attracted a lot of interests in recent years      3. The task consists of two sub-tasks. The first is human and object detection. It is usually performed by common object detection methods. The second is interaction classification of each human-object (HO) pair. This sub-task is very challenging due to the complex appearance variations in the interaction categories. See  Fig. 1 for examples. It is the focus of most previous HOI methods, as well as this work. Most previous HOI methods focus on learning better human-object features, including modeling relation and context via GNN  4 7  or attention mechanism  4 , decoupling localization and classification  [ref]22, leveraging vision-language knowledge [ref]22  and introducing multi-scale feature to transformer . However, for interaction classification they all adopt the simple linear classifier that performs the dot product of the human-object feature and a static weight vector, which represents an interaction category. In this work, we propose a new approach that enhances the above paradigm and complements most previous HOI methods. It is motivated by the recent work Query2label, a transformer-based classification network. It proposes a new concept we call category-specific query. Unlike the queries in other transformer methods, each query is associated to a specific and fixed image category during training and inference. This one-to-one binding makes the query learn to model each category more effectively. The queries are converted to image specific category representations via a transformer decoder. This method achieves excellent performance on multi-label image classification task. We extend this approach for human-object interaction classification. Essentially, our approach replaces traditional category representation as a static weight vector in previous HOI methods with category queries learnt as described above. The same linear classifier is adopted. Such category queries are more effective, and adaptive for different images, giving rise to better modeling of the complex variations in each interaction category. This is the crucial difference between this work and a simple adaption of   to HOI. Notably, this work is the first to address the category weight representation problem in the HOI community. Note that our proposed category specific query is different and not related to those queries in other transformer-based HOI methods3   . Specifically, category queries extract image-level features as the category representation. The queries in other methods are human-object instance-level features and category-agnostic. Our method is simple, lightweight and general. The overview is in Fig. 2. It is complementary to any off-the-shelf HOI method that provides human-object features. The modification of both inference and training is small. The incurred additional cost is marginal. In experiments, our approach is validated on three representative and strong HOI baseline methods, two transformer-based methods 3 [ref]22 and a traditional two-stage method 2. They are all significantly improved by our approach. New state-of-the-art results are obtained on two benchmarks. Specifically, we obtain 36.03 mAP on HICO-DET. Comprehensive ablation studies and in-depth discussion are also provided to verify the effectiveness of implementation details in our approach. It turns out that our method is more effective on challenging images that contain more human-object instances, a property that is rarely discussed by previous HOI methods.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: previous HOI methods focus on learning better human-object features, including modeling relation and context via GNN  4 7  or attention mechanism  4 , decoupling localization and classification  [ref]22, leveraging vision-language knowledge [ref]22  and introducing multi-scale feature to transformer .
