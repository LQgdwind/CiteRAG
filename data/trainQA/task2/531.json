Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

Perceptual loss relies on features extracted from the activation layers of the pre-trained VGG-19 network in , instead of low-level pixel-wise error measures. We define perceptual loss as the euclidean distance between the feature representations of the estimated SR image GθG​(L​Rt)subscript𝐺subscript𝜃𝐺𝐿subscript𝑅𝑡{G_{{\\theta_{G}}}}{\\left({L{R_{t}}}\\right)} and the ground truth H​Rt𝐻subscript𝑅𝑡HR_{t}. where,\nV​G​Gi,j𝑉𝐺subscript𝐺𝑖𝑗VGG_{i,j} denotes the feature map obtained by the jt​hsuperscript𝑗𝑡ℎj^{th} convolution (after activation) before the it​hsuperscript𝑖𝑡ℎi^{th} maxpooling layer in the VGG-19 network.
