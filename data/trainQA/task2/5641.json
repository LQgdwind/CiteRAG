      "content": "Paper Title: Understanding and Unifying Fourteen Attribution Methods with Taylor Interactions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDespite its widespread success in a variety of real-world applications, DNNs are typically regarded as ‚Äùblack boxes‚Äù, because it is difficult to interpret how a DNN makes a decision.\nThe lack of interpretability hurts the reliability of DNNs, thereby hampering their wide applications on high-stake tasks, such as automatic driving  and AI healthcare .\nTherefore, interpreting DNNs has drawn increasing attentions recently. As a typical perspective of interpreting DNNs,\nattribution methods aim to calculate the attribution/im-portance/contribution score of each input variable to the network output  7 0.\nFor example, given a pre-trained DNN for image classification and an input image,\nthe attribution score of each input variable refers to the numerical effect of each pixel on the confidence score of classification. Although many attribution methods have been proposed in recent years  7 ,\nmost of them are built upon different heuristics.\nFor example, some methods  [ref]35 consider that the gradient of the output w.r.t. the input can reflect the importance of input variables. In addition, some methods   use the output change when the input variable xisubscriptùë•ùëñx_{i} is occluded to measure the importance. There is a lack of unified theoretical perspective to examine the correctness of these attribution methods, or at least to mathematically clarify their core mechanisms,\ne.g., explaining their essential similarity and difference,\nand comparing their advantages and disadvantages. A few researchers have attempted to unify different attribution methods 70,\nbut these studies cover only a few methods (please see Table 1 for details).\nIn this paper, we propose the Taylor interaction as a new unified perspective, which first allows us to mathematically formulate mechanisms of up to fourteen attribution methods into the same system.\nWe believe that a mathematical system that unifies more methods is more likely to reflect essential factors in generating attributions, and enable an impartial comparison between different attribution methods. The proposed Taylor interaction is a new metric to represent the two types of effects on the network output caused by input variables.\nFirst, an input variable may make a direct effect on the network output, which is not influenced by other input variables.\nSuch an effect is termed an independent effect.\nSecond, an input variable may also collaborate with other input variables to affect the network output.\nSuch an effect is termed an interaction effect.\nBoth types of effects can be quantified as specific Taylor interactions. As a toy example, let us consider a DNN for a scene classification task that is trained to fit the target function fstudy room‚Äã(ùíô)=3‚Äãxbook+2‚Äãxdesk‚Äãxlamp‚Äãxbooksubscriptùëìstudy roomùíô3subscriptùë•book2subscriptùë•desksubscriptùë•lampsubscriptùë•bookf_{\\textrm{study room}}(\\bm{x})=3x_{\\textrm{book}}+2x_{\\textrm{desk}}x_{\\textrm{lamp}}x_{\\textrm{book}}.\nHere, the binary input variables xbook,xdesk,xlamp‚àà{0,1}subscriptùë•booksubscriptùë•desksubscriptùë•lamp01x_{\\textrm{book}},x_{\\textrm{desk}},x_{\\textrm{lamp}}\\in\\{0,1\\} denote the binary present/absent state of these objects in the scene.\nThe book variable xbooksubscriptùë•bookx_{\\textrm{book}} has an independent effect 3‚Äãxbook3subscriptùë•book3x_{\\textrm{book}} on the output.\nThe collaboration between variables xdesk,xlamp,xbooksubscriptùë•desksubscriptùë•lampsubscriptùë•bookx_{\\textrm{desk}},x_{\\textrm{lamp}},x_{\\textrm{book}} makes an interaction effect on the classification of the study room scene. In this paper, we prove that attributions scores generated by fourteen different attribution methods can all be explained by the above two types of effects.\nThe essential task of each attribution method can be represented as allocating a specific ratio of each independent effect and a specific ratio of each interaction effect to the input variable xisubscriptùë•ùëñx_{i}, so as to compute the attribution score of xisubscriptùë•ùëñx_{i}. Furthermore, the essential difference between these attribution methods is that they compute attribution scores by allocating different ratios of independent effects and interaction effects to input variables.\nFor example, let us consider the previous example fstudy room‚Äã(ùíô)=3‚Äãxbook+2‚Äãxdesk‚Äãxlamp‚Äãxbooksubscriptùëìstudy roomùíô3subscriptùë•book2subscriptùë•desksubscriptùë•lampsubscriptùë•bookf_{\\textrm{study room}}(\\bm{x})=3x_{\\textrm{book}}+2x_{\\textrm{desk}}x_{\\textrm{lamp}}x_{\\textrm{book}}.\nThere are an independent effect 3‚Äãxbook3subscriptùë•book3x_{\\textrm{book}} and an interaction effect 2‚Äãxdesk‚Äãxlamp‚Äãxbook2subscriptùë•desksubscriptùë•lampsubscriptùë•book2x_{\\textrm{desk}}x_{\\textrm{lamp}}x_{\\textrm{book}}.\nThen, the Shapley value 0 allocates the entire independent effect to the variable xbooksubscriptùë•bookx_{\\textrm{book}}, and allocate 1/3 of the interaction effect to xbooksubscriptùë•bookx_{\\textrm{book}}.\nIn this way, the attribution is computed as abook=3‚Äãxbook+2/3‚Äãxdesk‚Äãxlamp‚Äãxbooksubscriptùëébook3subscriptùë•book23subscriptùë•desksubscriptùë•lampsubscriptùë•booka_{\\textrm{book}}=3x_{\\textrm{book}}+2/3x_{\\textrm{desk}}x_{\\textrm{lamp}}x_{\\textrm{book}}.\nIn comparison, the Occlusion-1  allocates the entire independent effect and the entire interaction effect to the variable xbooksubscriptùë•bookx_{\\textrm{book}}.\nThat is, the attribution is computed as abook=3‚Äãxbook+2‚Äãxdesk‚Äãxlamp‚Äãxbooksubscriptùëébook3subscriptùë•book2subscriptùë•desksubscriptùë•lampsubscriptùë•booka_{\\textrm{book}}=3x_{\\textrm{book}}+2x_{\\textrm{desk}}x_{\\textrm{lamp}}x_{\\textrm{book}}. Principles of faithful attribution.\nThe above unified perspective enables us to fairly compare different attribution methods.\nTo this end, we propose three principles to examine whether an attribution method faithfully allocates the two types of effects to input variables.\nLet us use the attribution in the previous example of study room scene classification to explain the three principles. (i) The independent effect of a variable (3‚Äãxbook3subscriptùë•book3x_{\\textrm{book}}) is directly caused by the variable (xbooksubscriptùë•bookx_{\\textrm{book}}), which is not influenced by other variables.\nTherefore, the independent effect (3‚Äãxbook3subscriptùë•book3x_{\\textrm{book}}) is supposed to be allocated entirely to the variable (xbooksubscriptùë•bookx_{\\textrm{book}}).\nOther variables should not be allocated such an effect. (ii) The interaction effect (2‚Äãxdesk‚Äãxlamp‚Äãxbook2subscriptùë•desksubscriptùë•lampsubscriptùë•book2x_{\\textrm{desk}}x_{\\textrm{lamp}}x_{\\textrm{book}}) is caused by the collaboration between its own set of variables (S={xdesk,xlamp,xbook}ùëÜsubscriptùë•desksubscriptùë•lampsubscriptùë•bookS=\\{x_{\\textrm{desk}},x_{\\textrm{lamp}},x_{\\textrm{book}}\\}).\nTherefore, such an interaction effect is supposed to be allocated to the involved variables, not to variables without participating in the collaboration. (iii) The interaction effect (2‚Äãxdesk‚Äãxlamp‚Äãxbook2subscriptùë•desksubscriptùë•lampsubscriptùë•book2x_{\\textrm{desk}}x_{\\textrm{lamp}}x_{\\textrm{book}}) should be all allocated to the involved variables.\nIn other words, when we sum up the numerical effects allocated from the interaction effect to the involved variables, we obtain the exact value of the overall interaction effect (2‚Äãxdesk‚Äãxlamp‚Äãxbook2subscriptùë•desksubscriptùë•lampsubscriptùë•book2x_{\\textrm{desk}}x_{\\textrm{lamp}}x_{\\textrm{book}}). Subsequently, we apply the three principles to evaluate the faithfulness of the fourteen attribution methods.\nWe find that attribution methods such as Shapley value 0, Integrated Gradients [ref]35, and DeepLIFT Rescale  satisfy all principles. In summary, this paper has three contributions: We propose the Taylor interaction as a new unified perspective to theoretically explain the core mechanism of fourteen attribution methods. For each specific attribution method, the Taylor interaction enables us to clarify its distinctive property of computing attributions. We propose three principles to evaluate the faithfulness of an attribution method, which evaluate whether the attribution method faithfully allocates independent effects and interaction effects to input variables.
