Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5.

Note that these metrics are not always correlated. For example, an explanation can have a high validity score but low stability or RDT-Fidelity. In the following, we describe the real-world datasets that we use to compare explanations. Datasets and GNN Models. We use the most commonly used datasets Cora, CiteSeer and PubMed¬†.\nWe evaluate our approach on four different two-layer graph neural networks: GCN, graph attention network (GAT)¬†[ref]37, the approximation of personalized propagation of neural predictions (APPNP)¬†[ref]19, and graph isomorphism network (GIN)¬†[ref]41.\nWe evaluate these combinations with respect to validity, sparsity, and RDT-Fidelity for 300300300 randomly selected query nodes.\nTo calculate node sparsity for those approaches which retrieve soft edge masks, such as GNNExplainer, we follow¬† and create node masks by distributing the edge mask value equally onto the endpoint of the respective edges. For example, if a particular edge (u,v)ùë¢ùë£(u,v) the corresponding edge mask has a value of 0.5, then nodes uùë¢u and vùë£v would be given a node mask of 0.250.250.25 each. In Appendix¬†C, we provide additional experimental results in which we investigate: i) the effect of the number of samples used for calculating the RDT-Fidelity in Zorro, ii) further variations of the RDT-Fidelity threshold, iii) explanations using four additional metrics proposed by , and iv) the impact of larger computational graphs on explanation approaches by using the Amazon Computers dataset¬†.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: and GNN Models. We use the most commonly used datasets Cora, CiteSeer and PubMed¬†.\nWe evaluate our approach on four different two-layer graph neural networks: GCN, graph attention network (GAT)¬†[ref]37, the approximation of personalized propagation of neural predictions (APPNP)¬†[ref]19, and graph isomorphism network (GIN)¬†[ref]41.\nWe evaluate these combinations with respect to validity,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
