      "content": "Paper Title: Learning 3D Face Reconstruction with a Pose Guidance Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTraining Datasets. To train the shared encoder and PGN, we utilize two types of datasets: synthetic dataset with pseudo 3D annotations and in-the-wild datasets. For synthetic dataset, we choose 300W-LP [ref]15, which contains 60k synthetic images with fitted 3DMM parameters. These images are synthesized from around 4k face images with face profiling synthetic method . To enable more robust 3D face landmark detection, we choose a corpus of in-the-wild datasets, including Menpo , CelebA , 300-VW  and Multi-PIE  with their 68 2D landmarks automatically extracted by  . To train identity and expression regression networks with our proposed self-consistency losses, we utilize 300-VW  and Multi-PIE , where the former contains monocular videos, and the latter contains faces images of the same identity under different lightings, poses, expressions and scenes. Evaluation Datasets and Metrics. We evaluate our model on AFLW-2000-3D [ref]15, Florence  and FaceWarehouse  datasets. AFLW-2000-3D contains the first 2000 images from AFLW , which is annotated with fitted 3DMM parameters and 68 3D landmarks in the same way as 300W-LP. We evaluate face landmark detection performance and 3D face reconstruction performance on this dataset, which is measured by Normalized Mean Error (NME). Florence dataset contains 53 subjects with ground truth 3D scans, where each subject contains three corresponding videos: “Indoor-Cooperative”, “PTZ-Indoor” and “PIZ-Outdoor”. We report Point-to-Plane Distance to evaluate 3D shape reconstruction performance. The Florence dataset only contains 3D scans with the neutral expression, which can only be used to evaluate the performance of shape reconstruction. To evaluate the expression part, we further evaluate our method on the FaceWarehouse dataset. Following previous work [ref]26   , we use a subset with 180 meshes (9 identities and 20 expressions each) and report per-vertex error. Florence and FaceWarehouse are also employed to verify the effectiveness of our proposed multi-frame consistency scheme. Training Details. The face regions are cropped according to either pseudo 3D face landmarks or detected 2D facial landmarks . Then the cropped images are resized to 256×\\times256 as input. The shared encoder and PGN structures are the same as PRN [ref]16. For PGN, another option is using fully connected layers to regress sparse 3D landmarks, which can reduce a lot of computation with slightly decreased performance. The identity and expression regression networks take the encoder output as input, followed by one convolutional layer, one average pooling layer and three fully-connected layers. Our whole training procedure contains 3 steps: (1) We first train the shared encoder and PGN. We randomly sample one batch images from 300W-LP and another batch from in-the-wild datasets, then employ 3D landmark and 2D landmark supervision respectively. We set batch size to 16 and train the network for 600k iterations. After that, both the shared encoder and PGN parameters are fixed. (2) For identity and expression regression networks, we first pre-train them with only one image for each identity as input using Llsubscript𝐿𝑙L_{l} and Lrsubscript𝐿𝑟L_{r} for 400k iterations. This results in a coarse estimation and speeds up the convergence for training with multiple images. (3) Finally, we sequentially choose 2 and 4 images for each identity as input and train for another 400k iterations by minimizing Eq. (7). The balance weights for loss terms are set to λl=1subscript𝜆𝑙1\\lambda_{l}=1, λp=0.2subscript𝜆𝑝0.2\\lambda_{p}=0.2, λfsubscript𝜆𝑓\\lambda_{f} = 0.2, λssubscript𝜆𝑠\\lambda_{s} = 10, λrsubscript𝜆𝑟\\lambda_{r} = 1.\nDue to the memory consumption brought by rendering and optical flow estimation, we reduce the batch size to 4 for multi-image input. All 3 steps are trained using Adam  optimizer with an initial learning rate of 10−4superscript10410^{-4}. Learning rate decays half after 100k iterations. 3D Face Alignment Results. Fig.  3(a) shows the 68 facial landmark detection performance on AFLW2000-3D dataset [ref]15.\nBy training with a large corpus of unlabeled in-the-wild data, our model greatly improves over previous state-of-the-art 3D face alignment methods (e.g., PRN [ref]16, MMFace ) that heavily rely on 3D annotations. Our method achieves the best performance without any post-processing such as the ICP used in MMFace. Moreover, our PGN is robust. We can fix it and directly use its output as ground truth of 3D landmarks to guide the learning of 3D face reconstruction. Quantitative 3D Face Reconstruction Results. We evaluate 3D face reconstruction performance with NME on AFLW2000-3D, Point-to-Plane error on Florence\nand Per-vertex error on FaceWarehouse. Thanks to the robustness of our PGN, we can directly fix it and obtain accurate pose estimation without further learning. Then, our model can focus more on shape and expression estimation. As shown in Fig. 3(b), we achieve the best results on the AFLW2000-3D dataset, reducing N​M​E3​d𝑁𝑀subscript𝐸3𝑑NME_{3d} of previous state-of-the-art from 3.96 to 3.31, with 16.4% relative improvement. Table 1 shows the results on the Florence dataset. In contrast to MVF that concatenates encoder features as input to estimate a share identity parameter, we employ average pooling for encoder features, enabling us to perform both single-image and multi-image face reconstruction. In the evaluation setting, it does not make much difference using single-frame or multi-frame as input, because we’ll finally average all the video frame output. Notably, our method is more general than the previous state-of-the-art MVF that assumes expressions are the same among multiple images (i.e., multi-view images), while our method can directly train on monocular videos. Table 2 shows the results on FaceWarehouse dataset. For single frame setting, without modeling albedo, we still achieve comparable performance with MoFA [ref]26, Inversefacenet  and Tewari et al. . For multi-frame settings, we achieve better results than FML . For both single-frame and multi-frame settings, we achieve improved performance with PGN. All these show the effectiveness of PGN and self-consistency losses. Qualitative 3D Face Reconstruction Results. Fig. 4(a) shows the qualitative comparisons with 3DDFA [ref]15, PRNet [ref]16 and the pseudo ground truth. 3DDFA regresses identity, expression and pose parameters together and is only trained with synthetic datasets 300W-LP, leading to performance degradation. The estimated shape and expression of 3DDFA is close to mean face geometry and looks generally similar. PRNet directly regresses all vertices stored in UV position map, which cannot capture the geometric constraints well; thus, it does not look smooth and lacks geometric details, e.g., eye and mouth regions.\nIn contrast, our estimated shape and expression looks visually convincing. Even when compared with the pseudo ground truth generated with traditional matching methods, our estimation is more accurate in many cases. Fig. 4(b) shows the comparison on the Florence dataset, which further demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. Compared with FML on FaceWarehouse dataset, our results can generate more accurate expressions with visibly pleasing face reconstruction results (Fig. 4 (c)). Ablation Study. The effectiveness of PGN has been shown in Fig 3 (a) (for face alignment) and Table 2 (for face reconstruction). To better elaborate the contributions of different components in our self-consistency scheme, we perform detailed ablation study in Fig 5. Our baseline model is single-image face reconstruction trained only with Llsubscript𝐿𝑙L_{l} and Lrsubscript𝐿𝑟L_{r}. However, it doesn’t lead to accurate shape estimation, because our PGN with sparse landmarks can only provide a coarse shape estimation. To better estimate the shape, we employ multi-frame images as input. As shown in Fig.  5(a), even without census transform, the photometric consistency (Lp−subscript𝐿limit-from𝑝L_{p-}) improves the performance. However, photometric loss does not work well when illumination changes among video frames. Therefore, we enhance the photometric loss with census transform to make the model more robust to illumination change. This improves the performance quantitatively (Fig.  5(a)), and qualitatively (Fig. 5(b-f)). Applying semantic consistency (Lssubscript𝐿𝑠L_{s}) and flow consistency (Lfsubscript𝐿𝑓L_{f}) enforces the rendered image and the target image to look semantically similar and generates better face geometry. Video Results.\nOur proposed multi-image face reconstruction method is based on texture sampling, then it shall obtain better face reconstruction results with higher texture quality (higher video resolution). To verify it, we fine-tune our model on a high-quality video from the Internet, i.e., the fine-tuned model is specialized for the video. No 3D ground truth is used here. As shown in Fig. 4(d), our estimated shape and expression look surprisingly accurate after several thousand iterations. Specifically, our model captures the detailed expression (e.g., totally closed eyes) and face shape very well. This can be an interesting application when we need to obtain accurate 3D face reconstruction for one specific person.\n\nReference markers found: [15]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]15: Datasets.
