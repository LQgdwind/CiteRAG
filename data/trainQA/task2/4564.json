      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Practical Single-shot Phase Retrieval with Physics-Driven Deep Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, the deep learning-based PR approaches have been widely studied since they provide non-iterative inferences compared with the time-consuming optimization-based algorithms. Most of these approaches can work with only one Fourier intensity measurement for each PR reconstruction without the need for any additional constraints on the measurement. This seemingly impossible task, in fact, has a theoretical basis . It is known that if the Fourier intensity measurement is oversampled by two or more times in each dimension, the original complex-valued signal can be uniquely reconstructed, except for trivial ambiguities. Although such a reconstruction problem is highly non-convex (it is the reason why the traditional optimization methods fail to perform), it is particularly suitable to the deep learning-based methods due to their non-linear nature. Besides, they can also make use of the statistics acquired from a huge dataset to infer the solution. In general, the deep learning-based PR methods can be split into two categories depending on whether the underlying physics is adopted in the networks. For the first category, a feedforward network is used to estimate the target images directly from a Fourier intensity measurement [ref]25  [ref]23   [ref]32  . Specifically, [ref]25 proposed a two-branch CNN to reconstruct the magnitude and phase part from an oversampled Fourier intensity measurement, and  applied this network to the 3D crystal PR problem. The approach shows reasonably good performance for simple images with brief details. The performance when dealing with complex images is unknown. [ref]23 applied the conditional generative adversarial network to reconstruct the images. The network is extremely large since multiple multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) are used for all stages of the network.  adopted the ResNet  structure for Fourier phase retrieval tasks. Only a simple dataset (MNIST) was used for testing, and the performance was only barely satisfactory. The error in the details was still rather large.  implemented a UNet structure  to reconstruct the phase-only images from Fresnel diffraction patterns. Its performance with Fraunhofer diffraction patterns (Fourier intensity) is unknown. As for [ref]32, the authors adopted a multiple-resolution UNet structure and connected the hidden layers in the decoder to additional convolution layers to produce coarse outputs in an attempt to match the low-frequency components. Only the result of using 222 measurements is shown in the paper, and the blurring effect is quite significant, as shown in the result. Recently, our team also developed a feedforward DNN structure to tackle the PR problem . It has an MLP front end for feature extraction and a residual attention-based reconstruction unit to generate the phase images. Although it outperformed most of the existing state-of-the-art methods, its performance when dealing with more complex images still had room for further improvement. To improve the quality of the reconstructed images, the second category of deep learning-based PR methods implicitly or explicitly utilizes the underlying physics in the models      . For instance,  made use of the physics information to perform a learnable spectral initialization . It is followed by a double branch UNet for reconstruction. The approach requires an additional masking scheme to impose constraints on the measurement. The reconstructed images are rather noisy, even for simple images.  proposed to use MLP of different sizes in a cascaded network. The intensity measurement is applied to each MLP to assist the training and inferencing. The network size is very large due to the use of multiple MLPs. And the approach fails to reconstruct the details in the images. There are other iterative approaches similar to the traditional optimization-based methods. For instance,  suggested an iterative method with a 3-step structure: HIO initialization, iterative update between UNet and HIO, and final refinement by UNet.  proposed to embed a pre-trained DnCNN  into a plug-and-play iterative algorithm for refining the estimated images at each iteration. These iterative physics-driven approaches are usually quite time-consuming. Besides, they cannot be end-to-end trained, which often affects the overall performance.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: on whether the underlying physics is adopted in the networks.
