      "content": "Paper Title: Structure-Aware Image Segmentation with Homotopy Warping\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Sec. A.6 introduces the datasets used in this paper, including both 2D and 3D datasets. The benchmark methods are described in Sec. A.7. We mainly focus on topology-aware segmentation methods. Sec. A.8 describes the evaluation metrics used to assess the quality of the segmentation. To demonstrate the ability to achieve better structural/topological performances, besides standard segmentation metric, such as DICE score, we also use several topology-aware metrics to evaluate all the methods. Several ablation studies are then conducted to further demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the technical contributions (Sec. 4.1). Datasets.\nWe conduct extensive experiments to validate the efficacy of our method. Specifically, we use four natural and biomedical 2D datasets (RoadTracer , DeepGlobe [ref]13, Mass. [ref]35, DRIVE 6) and one more 3D biomedical dataset (CREMI 222https://cremi.org/) to validate the efficacy of the propose method. More details about the datasets and the split of the training and validation subsets are included in Sec. A.6. Baselines.\nWe compare the results of our method with several state-of-the-art methods. The standard/simple UNet (2D/3D) UNet 1 [ref]10 is used as a strong baseline and the backbone for other methods. The other baselines used in this paper include RoadTracer , VecRoad , iCurb , DIVE , VGG-UNet , TopoLoss , clDice 4 and DMT . More descriptions and implementation details of these baselines are included in Sec. A.7. Evaluation Metrics.\nWe use both pixel-wise (DICE) and topology-aware metrics (ARI, Warping Error and Betti number error) to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. More details about the evaluation metrics are provided in Sec. A.8. Implementation Details.\n\nFor 2D images, we use (m,n)𝑚𝑛(m,n) = (4, 8) to check if a pixel is simple or not; while (m,n)𝑚𝑛(m,n) = (8, 26) for 3D images. We choose cross-entropy loss as Lw​a​r​p/Lp​i​x​e​lsubscript𝐿𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑝subscript𝐿𝑝𝑖𝑥𝑒𝑙L_{warp}/L_{pixel} for all the experiments, except the ablation studies in Tab. 3. For 2D datasets, the batch size is set as 16, and the initial learning rate is 0.01. We randomly crop patches with the size of 512×512512512512\\times 512 and then feed them into the 2D UNet. For 3D case, the batch size is also 16, while the input size is 128×128×1612812816128\\times 128\\times 16. We perform the data normalization for the single patch based on its mean and standard deviation. We use PyTorch framework (Version: 1.7.1) to implement the proposed method. A simple/standard UNet (2D or 3D) is a used as baseline and the backbone. For the proposed method, as well as the other loss function based baselines, to make a fair comparison, we use the same UNet as backbone. And the training strategy is to train the UNet with dice loss first until converge, and then add the proposed losses to fine-tune the models obtained from the initial step. All the experiments are performed on a Tesla V100-SXM2 GPU (32G Memory), and an Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6140 CPU@2.30 GHz. Qualitative and Quantitative Results.\nIn Fig. 6, we show qualitative results from different datasets. Compared with baseline UNet, our method recovers better structures, such as connections, which are highlighted by red circles. Our final loss is a weighted combination of the dice loss and warping-loss term Lw​a​r​psubscript𝐿𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑝L_{warp}. When λw​a​r​psubscript𝜆𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑝\\lambda_{warp} = 0, the proposed method degrades to a standard UNet. The recovered better structures (UNet and Warping columns in Fig. 6) demonstrates that our warping-loss helps the deep neural networks to achieve better topological segmentations. More qualitative results are provided in Sec. A.9. Tab. 1 shows quantitative results for three 2D image datasets, RoadTracer, DeepGlobe and The Massachusetts dataset and one 3D image dataset, CREMI. The best performances are highlighted with bold. The proposed warping-loss usually achieves the best performances in both DICE score and topological accuracy (ARI, Warping Error and Betti Error) over other topology-aware segmentation baselines. Note that we only report the mean performances here for space limitation. We also include standard deviations and use t-test to determine the statistical significance in Sec. A.10.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: contributions (Sec. 4.1).
