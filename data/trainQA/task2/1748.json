      "content": "Paper Title: Attention-based model for predicting question relatedness on Stack Overflow\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are numerous unrecognized duplicate questions in the PCQA websites, which are not conducive to websites’ maintenance. Moreover, users who ask duplicate questions wait a long time for the question to be answered, while ready answers are already available [ref]2. Although some PCQA websites such as Stack Overflow recommend users search for related questions before posing new ones , as the same questions can be expressed in many different ways, the website will inevitably face duplicate questions. Taking Stack Overflow as an example, users of high reputation mark duplicate questions through manual analysis , which is ineffective and time-consuming. Therefore, automated detection approaches are required. Zhang et al. [ref]2 proposed a tool DUPPREDICTOR for automatically detecting duplicate questions on Stack Overflow. The tool uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to transform the natural language in a question into a topic distribution. Then it calculates the semantic similarity of the question pair by considering the title, description, topic, and tag similarity. This tool is the first work that addresses the problem of duplicate questions on Stack Overflow. Ahasanuzzaman et al.  proposed a duplicate question detection model Dupe for Stack Overflow. This model uses logistic regression to detect the duplicate question based on the five features of the question pair, such as cosine similarity value, term overlap, entity overlap, entity type overlap, and WordNet similarity. In the prediction stage, the BM25 algorithm and other methods are applied to filter irrelevant questions. Although the above methods can automatically detect duplicate questions, they require the manual design of features, which is time-consuming, and do not fully use the semantic information in question . Moreover, these features are usually related to specific tasks, so such methods’ generalization performance is lacking. Wang et al.  first applied the deep learning technique to detect duplicate questions on Stack Overflow. They explore three different deep learning approaches (e.g., DQ-CNN, DQ-RNN, and DQ-LSTM) based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), respectively. Compared with the baseline detection approaches and machine learning approaches, their models can achieve better performance, indicating the superiority of deep learning in this field. Besides, the DQ-LSTM model based on LSTM performs better than other deep learning models. AskUbuntu is another popular CQA website focused on software programming. For the duplicate question detection on the AskUbuntu, Bogdanova et al.  applied the convolution neural network with shared parameters to encode the distributed vector representation of individual questions and then calculate the similarity of vectors through cosine similarity to predict whether a pair of questions are duplicate. Based on Bogdanova et al.’s work, Rodrigues et al. [ref]16 released the AskUbuntu dataset’s clean version. They removed the explicit clues from the question to avoid a biased result . In their paper, the DCNN model, which combines the CNN model  and the MayoNLP model , can achieve state-of-the-art performance on this dataset. Compared with the traditional automated detection methods, the above deep learning approaches do not require the manual design of features and have better performance and generalization ability. However, such methods also fail to consider the interaction information between two questions well. We also expand our approach to the duplicate question detection task in software engineering, using the clean version of the AskUbuntu dataset prepared by Rodrigues et al. [ref]16 to evaluate ASIM’s applicability and robustness in a similar task.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: websites, which are not conducive to websites’ maintenance.
