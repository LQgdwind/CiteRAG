      "content": "Paper Title: RL-PGO: Reinforcement Learning-based Planar Pose-Graph Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSoft actor-critic (SAC) [ref]36, [ref]37 is a state-of-the-art continuous control RL algorithm with an augmented objective: where the temperature parameter α𝛼\\alpha dictates the relative importance between the entropy ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} and reward R𝑅R. Thus, the agent is encouraged to explore the state space and unseen trajectories which can speed up learning and prevent sub optimal convergence.\nWe utilize a recurrent version of the original implementation as shown in . After observing the current state and history of previous state-action pairs, the recurrent SAC policy network applies the optimal retractions to each of the poses shared by the edge in which the agent is located at for every time step. The recurrent SAC algorithm utilizes two networks, the Q-function and the policy. We will consider the policy πϕsubscript𝜋italic-ϕ\\pi_{\\phi}, parameterized by ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi modelled as a Gaussian with mean 𝐚tsubscript𝐚𝑡\\mathbf{a}_{t}, and covariance as depicted in Fig. 2. The two dimensional action vector at time t𝑡t is given by: where ϵtsubscriptitalic-ϵ𝑡\\epsilon_{t} is an input noise vector sampled from a normal distribution with mean 0, and standard deviation of 1. Both policy and Q value architectures follow the structure of the recurrent-based DDPG algorithm proposed in [ref]38. The recurrent branch further allows the agent to make informed optimal decisions on the next actions from previous state and action pairs, by the internal state representation [ref]38: zt=z​(ht)subscript𝑧𝑡𝑧subscriptℎ𝑡z_{t}=z\\left(h_{t}\\right) modelled by an LSTM. We denote ht=[at−1,st−1,at−2,st−2,…]subscriptℎ𝑡subscript𝑎𝑡1subscript𝑠𝑡1subscript𝑎𝑡2subscript𝑠𝑡2…h_{t}=\\left[a_{t-1},s_{t-1},a_{t-2},s_{t-2},\\ldots\\right] to represent the history of the previous states and actions. The objective loss functions are essentially the same as presented in [ref]37, with slight modification to the gradient estimators, accounting for back propagation through time (BPTT). Details can be referred to in [ref]38 and .\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: Soft actor-critic (SAC) [ref]36, [ref]37 is a state-of-the-art continuous control RL algorithm with an augmented objective: where the temperature parameter α𝛼\\alpha dictates the relative importance between the entropy\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
