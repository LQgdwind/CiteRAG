      "content": "Paper Title: GraphMLP: A Graph MLP-Like Architecture for 3D Human Pose Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe large-scale ablation studies with 2D detected inputs on the Human3.6M dataset are conducted to investigate the effectiveness of our model (using the single-frame model). Model Configurations.\nWe start our ablation studies by exploring the GraphMLP on different hyper-parameters.\nThe results are shown in Table VI.\nIt can be observed that using the expanding ratio of 2 (C=512𝐶512C=512, DC=2​C=1024subscript𝐷𝐶2𝐶1024D_{C}=2C=1024) works better than the ratio value of 4 which is common in vision Transformers and MLPs.\nIncreasing or reducing the number of GraphMLP layers L𝐿L hurts performance, while using L=3𝐿3L=3 performs best.\nThe hidden size C𝐶C is important to determine the modeling ability.\nWhile increasing the C𝐶C from 128 to 512 (keeping the same MLP ratios), the MPJPE decreases from 50.2 m​m𝑚𝑚mm to 49.2 m​m𝑚𝑚mm.\nMeanwhile, the number of parameters increases from 0.60M to 9.49M.\nThe performance saturates when C𝐶C surpasses 512.\nTherefore, the optimal hyper-parameters for our model are L=3𝐿3L=3, C=512𝐶512C{=}512, DC=1024subscript𝐷𝐶1024D_{C}=1024, and DS=256subscript𝐷𝑆256D_{S}=256, which are different from the original setting of MLP-Mixer .\nThe reason for this may be the gap between vision and skeleton data, where the Human3.6M dataset is not diverse enough to train a large GraphMLP model. Input 2D Detectors.\nA high-performance 2D detector is vital in achieving accurate 3D pose estimation.\nTable VII reports the performance of our model with ground truth 2D joints, and detected 2D joints from Stack Hourglass (SH) , Detectron , CPN [ref]47, and HRNet .\nWe can observe that our approach can produce more accurate results with a better 2D detector and is effective on different 2D estimators. Network Architectures.\nTo clearly demonstrate the advantage of the proposed GraphMLP, we compare our approach with various baseline architectures.\nThe ‘Graph-Mixer’ is constructed by replacing the linear layers in MLP-Mixer with GCN layers, and the ‘Transformer-GCN’ is built by replacing the spatial MLPs in GraphMLP with multi-head self-attention blocks and adding a position embedding module.\nTo ensure a consistent and fair evaluation, the parameters of these architectures (e.g., the number of layers, hidden size) keep the same.\nAs shown in Table VIII, our proposed approach consistently surpasses all other architectures.\nFor example, our approach can improve the GCN-based model [ref]8 from 51.3 m​m𝑚𝑚mm to 49.2 m​m𝑚𝑚mm, resulting in relative 4.1% improvements.\nIt’s worth noting that the MLP-Like model (‘MLP-Mixer’, ‘GraphMLP’) outperforms the Transformer-based model (‘Transformer’, ‘Transformer-GCN’).\nThis may be because a small number of tokens (e.g., 17 joints) are less effective for self-attention in learning long-range dependencies.\nOverall, these results confirm that the GraphMLP can serve as a new and strong baseline for 3D human pose estimation.\nThe implementation details of these network architectures can be found in the supplementary. Network Design Options.\nOur approach allows the model to learn strong structural priors of human joints by injecting GCNs into the baseline model (i.e., MLP-Mixer ).\nWe also explore the different combinations of MLPs and GCNs to find an optimal architecture.\nAs shown in Table IX, the location matters of GCN are studied by five different designs:\n(i) The GCN is placed before spatial MLP.\n(ii) The GCN is placed after spatial MLP.\n(iii) The GCN is placed after channel MLP.\n(iv) The GCN and MLP are in parallel but using a spatial GCN block (process tokens in spatial dimension) in SG-MLP.\n(v) The GCN and MLP are in parallel.\nThe results show that all these designs can help the model produce more accurate 3D poses, and using GCN and MLP in parallel achieves the best estimation accuracy.\nThe illustrations of these design options can be found in the supplementary. Model Components.\nWe also investigate the effectiveness of each component in our design.\nIn Table X, the first row corresponds to the baseline model (i.e., MLP-Mixer ) that does not use any GCNs in the model.\nThe MPJPE is 52.0 m​m𝑚𝑚mm.\nThe rest of the rows show the results of replacing its spatial MLP with SG-MLP or channel MLP with CG-MLP by adding a GCN block into the baseline.\nIt can be found that using our SG-MLP or CG-MLP can improve performance (50.6 m​m𝑚𝑚mm and 50.5 m​m𝑚𝑚mm respectively).\nWhen enabling both SG-MLP and CG-MLP, GraphMLP improves the performance over the baseline by a clear margin of 2.8 m​m𝑚𝑚mm (relatively 5.4% improvements), indicating that the proposed components are mutually reinforced to produce more accurate 3D poses.\nThese results validate the effectiveness of our motivation: combining modern MLPs and GCNs in a unified architecture for better 3D human pose estimation.\n\nReference markers found: [47]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]47: is vital in achieving accurate 3D pose estimation.\nTable VII reports the performance of our model with ground truth 2D joints, and detected 2D joints from Stack Hourglass (SH) , Detectron , CPN [ref]47, and HRNet .\nWe can observe that our approach can produce more accurate results with a better 2D detector and is effective on different 2D estimators.
