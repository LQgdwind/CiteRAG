These “best” reviews explain, in a personalised way, the newly suggested interactions (uj→𝑠r​e​sk𝑠→subscript𝑢𝑗𝑟𝑒subscript𝑠𝑘u_{j}\\xrightarrow{s}res_{k}) assuming s∈ 𝑠45s\\in , as depicted in Figure 5. As stated before, this is a LTR task. Considering the positive reviews of the restaurant r​e​sk∈R𝑟𝑒subscript𝑠𝑘𝑅res_{k}\\in R, we aim at learning the following function: where r+superscript𝑟r^{+} is a positive review for restaurant r​e​sk𝑟𝑒subscript𝑠𝑘res_{k}, C+∗(uj)c​i​t​ysuperscript𝐶subscriptsubscript𝑢𝑗𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦C^{+}*(u_{j})_{city} is the positive (+)(+) expansion (∗)(*) of the user context from Equation 4, and r​e​v​i​e​w​s+​(r​e​sk)𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑒𝑤superscript𝑠𝑟𝑒subscript𝑠𝑘reviews^{+}(res_{k}) is the set of positive reviews of that restaurant. Following the idea of the LTR task, we must deal with the probabilities P​r​(r+|uj)𝑃𝑟conditionalsuperscript𝑟subscript𝑢𝑗Pr(r^{+}|u_{j}) for a user uj∈U−subscript𝑢𝑗superscript𝑈u_{j}\\in U^{-} of liking each of the positive reviews r+∈r​e​v​i​e​w​s+​(r​e​sk)superscript𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑒𝑤superscript𝑠𝑟𝑒subscript𝑠𝑘r^{+}\\in reviews^{+}(res_{k}). We aim at predicting the review r∗superscript𝑟r^{*} whose probability value is the highest, which corresponds to the “best” explanation to the new suggested interaction (uj→𝑠r​e​sk𝑠→subscript𝑢𝑗𝑟𝑒subscript𝑠𝑘u_{j}\\xrightarrow{s}res_{k}): We defined a multi-label classification problem to solve the supervised LTR task, considering the ground truth definition from Subsection 3.2. In this way, each output label j𝑗j, corresponding to the user uj∈U−subscript𝑢𝑗superscript𝑈u_{j}\\in U^{-}, can be addressed independently. The model can behave better for some users and worse for others, depending on the quality (and completeness) of their contexts C+∗(uj)c​i​t​ysuperscript𝐶subscriptsubscript𝑢𝑗𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦C^{+}*(u_{j})_{city}. As stated in Subsection 3.3, PTER follows the feature-based approach of the pre-trained BERT-base-uncased model . We focused on the hidden states of the last four layers to build what we called the contextual embedding, following a transfer learning task. As a reminder, each sample in the training dataset has (1) the pre-processed input review (transformed to the input embeddings using the BERT-tokenizer) and (2) the target binary vector. The PTER model has two neural network blocks, organised as follows: The mapping block: it transforms natural language reviews to dense representations of real-valued vectors. This part of the model is straightforward, corresponding to the aforementioned BERT-base-uncased model, depicted in Figure 6. A concatenation layer links the hidden states of the last four hidden layers of the transformer, of size 768. This turns out in a 768×4=307276843072768\\times 4=3072 contextual embedding for each token in the input review (limited to a maximum of 512 tokens). PTER customised layers: these layers tackle the multi-label classification problem for the supervised LTR task. Figure 7 depicts the overall design. First, the contextual embeddings are fed into a Bi-LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network [ref]35 as time series data. The purpose of this layer is the classification of sequences, hence its suitability for NLP tasks. We present the contextual embeddings to the network as 512 periods or “steps” to match with the maximum number of tokens allowed in the input sequences. The LSTM network was configured with 256 output units. The bi-directional approach of the LSTM learns the sequence in both the forward and backward directions, duplicating the output units. Moreover, the Bi-LSTM was configured to output the hidden states in every time step, generating a 256×2=5122562512256\\times 2=512 output per input contextual embedding. After that, average and maximum pooling are addressed to reduce the output hidden states of every time step to a single output [ref]36  (i.e., summarising the time series data). A concatenation layer links both pooled representations, resulting in a 1024 dense representation of the whole input review. Overfitting issues are faced dropping output units  with a dropout layer (with 0.1 ratio). Then, a fully connected dense layer with ReLU activation  applies L2 weight regularisation (with 0.001 ratio) and decreases the dense representation size by half, with 512 output units. The output layer with size |U−|superscript𝑈|U^{-}| applies a sigmoid activation function that maps logits (i.e., w​e​i​g​h​t​s×i​n​p​u​t​s+b​i​a​s𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡𝑠𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠weights\\times inputs+bias) to real values in the range (0,1)01(0,1). PTER predicts the probabilities Pr⁡(r+|uj)Prconditionalsuperscript𝑟subscript𝑢𝑗\\Pr(r^{+}|u_{j}) ∀r+∈r​e​v​i​e​w​s+​(r​e​sk)for-allsuperscript𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑒𝑤superscript𝑠𝑟𝑒subscript𝑠𝑘\\forall r^{+}\\in reviews^{+}(res_{k}) and for every user uj∈U−subscript𝑢𝑗superscript𝑈u_{j}\\in U^{-}, given a restaurant r​e​sk∈R𝑟𝑒subscript𝑠𝑘𝑅res_{k}\\in R. We used these probabilities to generate the rankings of reviews, following the idea of the LTR supervised task. Then, we computed the “best” reviews, as stated in Equation 8. As we will see later, when describing the evaluation framework, the “best” reviews take into account more than the ranking position. The standard threshold of 0.5 was used at the output of the sigmoid activation function to determine which labels are activated and which are not. In our approach, we faced the problem of sparsity in user interactions, stated in Subsection 3.1. We defined the previous concept of “active users” from Equation 6 as a model hyper-parameter. As a reminder, U−⊂Usuperscript𝑈𝑈U^{-}\\subset U is the top |U−|superscript𝑈|U^{-}| users from a city context with the highest amount of interactions. It is worth mentioning that these top users determine the size of the output layer, as depicted in Figure 7. The model will only consider them to make predictions and generate the rankings. This filtering criterion entails an important trade-off between the number of output users and the availability of training data: If we reduce the number of output users, there will be a larger amount of zero-valued target vectors that will be discarded from the training process, as already described. The advantage is that selected targets are less dispersed and easier to train with, but at the cost of losing training data and reducing the range of predictions. Moreover, filtering reviews in this way is making us discard some restaurants in each city. If we increase the number of output users, we are increasing the scope of predictions, since increasing the number of users also entails an increase in the number of restaurants to be considered (see Figure 4). Therefore more data will be available to perform the task. However, selected targets are more dispersed and harder to train with. PTER performance is directly affected by this trade-off, as we can see in Figure 8. As expected, PTER performs better when decreasing the number of active users, that is, when the matrix to learn is less sparse. To adjust our model, we separated the pre-processed input reviews with their target output vectors into three different partitions. (1) The training partition (70% of the dataset), (2) the validation partition (15% of the dataset) and (3) the test partition (the remaining 15% of the dataset). These partitions were randomly shuffled in every experiment. In order to tackle the sparsity issue, we took two decisions. First, we double the importance of the positive labels (representing the user contexts in Equation 7) during the training stage. With this aim, we defined the “1’s labels weight” hyper-parameter, so that we modified the loss function, as we will see later. The second decision was to address the imbalance between positive and negative labels using the ML-ROS-20 random oversampling method 0 in the training partition. Basically, ML-ROS-20 computes a set of metrics of a MLD (Multi-Label Dataset) to check the initial label distribution. It determines if the dataset is unbalanced based on those metrics and therefore requires oversampling. If so, the minority labels constitute a “bag” from which new samples are randomly drawn and added (repeated) in the training partition. This process increased the ratio of the minority labels111As a side effect, this oversampling method tends to balance the ratios of 1’s throughout all the outputs labels (i.e., like an equalisation process).. These two decisions combined, made the model more sensitive to positive detections and mitigated the interactions-per-user sparsity problem. Since BERT weights are frozen, we only focus on the connections of the second block of our network during training. Our training objective was to minimise the BCE (Binary Cross Entropy) loss function, which is the suitable function for a multi-label classification task. We leveraged a customised version of this function based on the aforementioned “1’s labels weight” hyper-parameter, in order to weigh double the positive labels with respect to the negative labels, which mean absence of information about user contexts. During training, we followed an early stop method, monitoring the validation loss of this customised BCE function, using both a ΔΔ\\Delta (minimum change in the monitored metric between two consecutive epochs to qualify as an improvement) and a “patience epochs” (number of epochs with no improvement after which training will be stopped) hyper-parameters. We used the Adam optimisation algorithm, following the original proposal of BERT , as well as the recommended values for the batch size and learning rate in fine-tuning tasks. We followed the naive approach of keeping the N𝑁N head tokens of the reviews 1 2, on the assumption that the most meaningful information is written first. The “input sequence length” hyper-parameter matches the maximum length constraint of BERT . The “#active users” hyper-parameter was set accordingly with the performance curves in Figure 8. For the sake of comparison, we set the same value for every city. For the rest of hyper-parameters, values were set by trial and error accordingly with the validation data during the training stage. Table 3 contains the values of the hyper-parameters employed to train the model. We enhanced the generalisation capabilities of the model using (1) a dropout layer, (2) L2 regularisation and (3) early stopping. Early stopping is a common strategy to guarantee the best fit of parameters, avoiding overfitting to the training data. For our proposed LTR supervised task, the early stop process made the executions stop in the range of 8-15 epochs, depending on the dataset. Assessing the usefulness and the validity of the explanations that PTER provides is a complicated issue due to the subjective nature of the concept of explanation. To assess our PTER model, we centred on the following 3 core ideas: (1) we designed an heuristic method to select our explainable reviews from the rankings, (2) we used the authorship criterion of the reviews to check the human suitability of explanations in a clustering process and (3) we defined a random adversary to make a comparison. Given the r​e​v​i​e​w​s+​(r​e​sk)​∀r​e​sk∈R𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑒𝑤superscript𝑠𝑟𝑒subscript𝑠𝑘for-all𝑟𝑒subscript𝑠𝑘𝑅reviews^{+}(res_{k})~{}\\forall res_{k}\\in R in the test and validation sets, the aim of our proposal was to obtain new dyads (uj,r​e​sk,c​u​s​t​o​mj​k)subscript𝑢𝑗𝑟𝑒subscript𝑠𝑘𝑐𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑜subscript𝑚𝑗𝑘(u_{j},res_{k},custom_{jk}) where c​u​s​t​o​mj​k𝑐𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑜subscript𝑚𝑗𝑘custom_{jk} is the personalised explanation that was selected based on the rankings using the PTER model. In order to check the validity of our model, we guaranteed that we had a real positive review written by ujsubscript𝑢𝑗u_{j} about r​e​sk𝑟𝑒subscript𝑠𝑘res_{k}, so that we already had the reference dyad (uj,r​e​sk,a​u​t​h​o​rj​k)subscript𝑢𝑗𝑟𝑒subscript𝑠𝑘𝑎𝑢𝑡ℎ𝑜subscript𝑟𝑗𝑘(u_{j},res_{k},author_{jk}). Then, we competed against a random adversarial dyad definition (uj,r​e​sk,r​a​n​d​o​mj​k)subscript𝑢𝑗𝑟𝑒subscript𝑠𝑘𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑜subscript𝑚𝑗𝑘(u_{j},res_{k},random_{jk}). In order to perform the evaluation, we filter each predicted ranking to preserve a top N𝑁N positive reviews (with N𝑁N a small number of the overall ranking size), which we identified as the “predicted context” of each interaction (uj→𝑠r​e​sk)𝑠→subscript𝑢𝑗𝑟𝑒subscript𝑠𝑘(u_{j}\\xrightarrow{s}res_{k}). This N𝑁N evaluation parameter was tailored for every city dataset to keep only the reviews with the highest probabilities. The “predicted context” helped us extracting meaningful text-based features, weighing the importance of every restaurant feature in terms of text and according to the output user. To get the most meaningful text-based features of the “predicted contexts”, we considered the following filtering criteria for the reviews: We discarded all non-alphanumeric characters from the reviews. We filtered English stopwords222The corpora that was used is available at https://www.nltk.org/nltk_data/., which are high frequency words without relevant semantics (e.g., demonstratives, prepositions and so on). We followed POS tagging, selecting the singular nouns333The English off-the-shelf tagger, using the Penn Treebank tagset, was used. Available at https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html. as the most meaningful English part of speech. We applied lemmatization, to get the root from word inflections 444The lemmatization process leverages the WordNet’s built-in morphy function.. After that, we encoded these “predicted contexts” of reviews to a TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) vector space model representation, applying a tokenizer (fit to the whole vocabulary Vc​i​t​ysubscript𝑉𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦V_{city} of a c​i​t​y∈C𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦𝐶city\\in C). TF (Term Frequency) weighs the occurrences of a word of Vc​i​t​ysubscript𝑉𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦V_{city} in a review (or set of reviews, considering the “predicted context”). IDF (Inverse Document Frequency) represents the specificity of the term (i.e., give more importance to the terms that appear only in few reviews). Using this TF-IDF measures, we mapped the “predicted contexts” corresponding to each interaction (uj→𝑠r​e​sk)𝑠→subscript𝑢𝑗𝑟𝑒subscript𝑠𝑘(u_{j}\\xrightarrow{s}res_{k}) to a single cumulative vector. We deleted from these vector representations the top 20 words with the highest frequencies in the vocabulary of the reviews in each city. In this way, we discarded the most common, generic and meaningless words (e.g., food, restaurant, dish…) from the specific user contexts. To select the personalised and explainable review from the “predicted contexts” of each interaction (uj→𝑠r​e​sk)𝑠→subscript𝑢𝑗𝑟𝑒subscript𝑠𝑘(u_{j}\\xrightarrow{s}res_{k}), we followed this heuristic process: We took, from the “predicted context” cumulative vector of each interaction (uj→𝑠r​e​sk)𝑠→subscript𝑢𝑗𝑟𝑒subscript𝑠𝑘(u_{j}\\xrightarrow{s}res_{k}), the positions with the highest weights (i.e., keywords). We individually computed the frequency of each keyword in all the reviews from the “predicted contexts”. We selected the personalised and explainable review from the “predicted context” based on a score, computed for every review as the addition of the keywords frequencies, penalised logarithmically with the ranking position. The review with the highest score within the “predicted context”, added to the interaction (uj→𝑠r​e​sk)𝑠→subscript𝑢𝑗𝑟𝑒subscript𝑠𝑘(u_{j}\\xrightarrow{s}res_{k}), explains the new dyad (uj,r​e​sk,c​u​s​t​o​mj​k)subscript𝑢𝑗𝑟𝑒subscript𝑠𝑘𝑐𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑜subscript𝑚𝑗𝑘(u_{j},res_{k},custom_{jk}). We give more importance to the highest positions in the rankings, also considering the most important keywords of the “predicted context” for every interaction (uj→𝑠r​e​sk)𝑠→subscript𝑢𝑗𝑟𝑒subscript𝑠𝑘(u_{j}\\xrightarrow{s}res_{k}). It is worth mentioning that the selected review, c​u​s​t​o​mj​k𝑐𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑜subscript𝑚𝑗𝑘custom_{jk}, can have a position different from the first in the rankings. We present two examples of the reviews selected as the explanations, given a restaurant and two different users in the Barcelona dataset. In the first example, two users (“John W” and “LaurentG752”) are linked to the restaurant “Restaurante_Salamanca”. Their keywords vary according to their interactions and therefore the selected reviews. Looking at the keywords from the user “John W”, they are mainly related to the seafood and the service of the restaurant, as the selected review does. On the other side, the keyword “beach” of the user “LaurentG752” changes the selected review, this time specifying that the restaurant is right next to the beach in the Mediterranean sea. In the second example, two users (“Paul B” and “iamnotfatimbeyonce”) are linked to the restaurant “Teresa_Carles”. In this particular example, “Paul B” is more interested in vegan food, so the selected review is tailored in that way. On the other hand, the user “iamnotfatimbeyonce” prefers information regarding breakfasts (“excellent fresh juices”).\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: the multi-label classification problem for the supervised LTR task.
