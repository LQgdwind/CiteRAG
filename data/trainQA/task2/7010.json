      "content": "Paper Title: Safe and Accelerated Deep Reinforcement Learning-based O-RAN Slicing: A Hybrid Transfer Learning Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe work in [ref]16 is amongst the earliest research to consider slicing from an O-RAN perspective. The authors promote using DRL as one of several machine learning (ML) schemes to optimize O-RAN slicing. They highlight that DRL provides faster convergence when compared with tabular reinforcement learning (RL) given large state and action spaces. The authors of [ref]17 and  employ the concept of federated reinforcement learning (FRL) in the context of O-RAN slicing. In [ref]17, the authors suggest that the global model built using FRL learns to generalize at a slow rate. However, it achieves relatively more robust training by leveraging the shared experience. In , the authors employ the knowledge gained in one network application and share it to solve a slightly different problem in another application. This is done by coordinating power control and radio resource allocation xApps for network slicing in O-RAN. A joint global model is created and then disassembled into local Q-tables for the different xApps to follow when deciding the actions to take. The authors indicate that FRL can enable faster convergence but with relatively lower rewards. Nevertheless, a global generic model can still be prone to instabilities and require some exploration when transferred to make decisions in a target local context. The concept of safe and accelerated DRL is partially addressed by a few research studies in the context of O-RAN. In , we discussed the need for and categorized the approaches to safe and accelerated DRL in NGNs. We also examined the viability of TL variants to accelerate DRL-based RAN slicing using a basic case study. In , the problem of resource allocation in O-RAN slicing is addressed. The authors mainly rely on the inherent properties of the DRL algorithms when choosing one to employ. For instance, they mention that the implemented actor-critic (AC)-based solution can produce a faster convergence compared to the proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based one as the off-policy model has relatively improved sample efficiency. However, they show that the AC-based solution has a failed exploration at the beginning and a lower reward value in general. Moreover, both DRL-based solutions can take around 20 thousand learning steps to converge with no guarantee of fast and stable performance if deployed in the near-RT RIC of O-RAN. Hence, robust performance cannot be insured solely based on the inherent properties of the DRL algorithm chosen. In , O-RAN slicing is one of the 3 developed exemplary xApps. The authors address some convergence-related issues by choosing PPO as it proved to be reliable and efficient in literature. They also propose pre-processing the observations using autoencoders before feeding them into the DRL agent. This reduces the dimensionality of the observations yet retains a good representation of the system state. Moreover, in , the authors show that the proposed deep Q-network (DQN)-based algorithm experiences relatively slow convergence on the communication level of slicing compared with the computational level. They indicate that this is primarily due to the mobility of end devices. Consequently, the channel gains between the base stations (BSs) and the end devices change frequently, delaying the convergence. More relevantly, authors of  attempt to accelerate the convergence by proposing an evolutionary-based DRL approach in the context of O-RAN slicing. However, it appears that training and deployment flows are not isolated. Meaning that the DRL training is carried out in the near-RT RIC. Online training is not recommended by the O-RAN alliance as it comes with risks such as the requirement for exploration [ref]11. Furthermore, the costs of online training are not demonstrated. The authors of  propose a centralized DRL-based approach for dynamic RAN slicing. They run simulations using different combinations of parameters to find those leading to short convergence times. This is mainly done for the offline training process and still falls under the “acceleration via design choices” category defined in . They also propose a non-DRL-based crowding game approach that experiences relatively faster convergence in the offline training phase. Nonetheless, if deployed in the near-RT RIC, additional time is required for the crowding game approach to compute the cost of each strategy and make a decision as it is based on the users’ KPIs. Finally, in [ref]11, parallelization is suggested as one of the design approaches for reducing the convergence time. This is mainly done by utilizing several environments in parallel. This can reduce the real clock time of DRL agents’ convergence during offline training. However, this is not supported during the deployment phase in real networks. Different from the aforementioned reviewed work, in this paper, we propose isolated systematic training-deployment workflows that consider the O-RAN recommendations. Such flows incorporate expert policies pre-trained on the same problem, and fine-tuned using live network data, to guide the DRL convergence. The flows are algorithm-agnostic and should work with any DRL algorithms or settings configured by the MNO. Furthermore, the proposed policy transfer-aided DRL approach and baselines are primarily concerned with the practical live deployment in the O-RAN’s near-RT RIC. Finally, the proposed hybrid TL-aided DRL approach ensures that the maximum level of rewards is reached safely and quickly. We demonstrate that using real network VR gaming traffic to reflect an important immersive and latency-intolerant scenario in NGNs .\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: The work in [ref]16 is amongst the earliest research to consider slicing from an O-RAN perspective.
