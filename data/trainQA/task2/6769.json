      "content": "Paper Title: Towards a Comprehensive Human-Centred Evaluation Framework for Explainable AI\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEven though AI/ML models have standard evaluation metrics, there is still no consensus on the strategy to evaluate XAI methods. Doshi-Velez et al. [ref]18 proposed the first standardisation of XAI evaluation. According to their work, the evaluation could be performed in three levels: application-grounded, with real tasks and users; human-grounded, with real users and proxy tasks; and functionality-grounded, with proxy tasks and no users. Currently, application or human-grounded approaches have been criticized for their lack of rigour  , and for using proxy tasks . To conduct functionally-grounded evaluations, i.e. proxy tasks and no users, some studies have focused on grouping concepts and defining properties\n[ref]34   [ref]5 and their corresponding metrics . These works aggregate existing literature that defines properties or presents metrics to assess them. The proposed properties try to measure the quality of the explanations without context so that they can be used in functionality-grounded evaluation. Similarly, Hoffman et al.  proposed to evaluate explanations using the ‘goodness criteria’ that assess the explanation quality without context. Most recently, Agarwal et al.  presented a framework to benchmark different XAI methods using automatic metrics. Still, it is limited to particular methods and only works with specific datasets created for the benchmark. Little work has been conducted to present the connections between these properties. Most papers state that trade-offs exist    [ref]34, but they have not quantified them. To the best of our knowledge, only the study by Balog et al.  uncovered conflicting relationships between some of the proposed properties, but they did not evaluate XAI-generated explanations. Given the number of properties to evaluate, selecting the aspects to consider in the evaluation is becoming an important topic. According to Liao et al. , this selection depends on the tasks the system has to support because the user accomplishment of these tasks determines the overall system’s success. Knijnenburg et al. 5 indicate the selection is made according to theoretical models, i.e., it results from previous studies or from the hypothesis that is tested. Recently, Liao et al.  presented a study that connects tasks with evaluation criteria to provide general guidelines for the field. In this study, experts and end-users selected the most appropriate properties to evaluate diverse XAI tasks. They found that XAI tasks obtained different property rankings regardless of the application domain (loan application, medical diagnosis, among others). Our work builds upon these previous studies by proposing a unified framework that integrates previously proposed definitions and measurements by making the relations between them explicit and grounded in previous work. Additionally, we analysed measurement procedures and classified them by which explanation element they measure according to Miller’s definition of explanation , which declares that explanations are composed of a cognitive process, a product and a social process. This new criteria to classify measurements provides researchers and practitioners with a new understanding of how to measure properties of explanations.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: Even though AI/ML models have standard evaluation metrics, there is still no consensus on the strategy to evaluate XAI methods.
