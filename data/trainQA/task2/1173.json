      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient falsification approach for autonomous vehicle validation using a parameter optimisation technique based on Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nISO 26262 is a widely accepted functional safety standard in the automotive industry, and the focus of this standard is on conventional vehicle systems. This standard looks at preventing malfunctions(faults and failures) which are mainly related to internal causes. However, the most functionally safe vehicle can still have an accident due to the performance limitations of the system caused by unintended behaviour when the system interacts with the external environment. The recently released ISO 21448 addresses this problem by aiming to reduce the number of unintended behaviours that a system can produce1. The standard suggests that safety of intended functionality is ensured by explicitly evaluating the known-unsafe scenario and evaluating unknown-unsafe scenarios using industry best practice, systematic analysis, or dedicated experiments1. The goal of the standard is to reduce the known unintended behaviours (known unsafe) and the unknown potential behaviour (unknown-unsafe) to an acceptable level of residual risk2. These existing standards are essential to provide best practices for developing safety systems, but they are not comprehensive enough to cover the safety of Highly Automated Vehicles3. These standards assume the ultimate guarantee of safety is the responsibility of the human driver. This is a fundamental problem for HAV operating on the road without a human driver. There are many technologies used in HAV that are inherently incompatible with existing automobile safety standards423. A common strategy is to use a test matrix for system validation[ref]4. In this approach, the system is evaluated using pre-defined test scenarios extracted from the crash database[ref]4. One such example is the AEB Autonomous Emergency Braking test protocol developed as part of the Euro New Car Assessment Program (Euro-NCAP)[ref]45. Even though this approach is repeatable and reliable, these scenarios are fixed and predefined6. So, the system is likely to perform well in these tests, but the real-life scenarios are more diverse and challenging[ref]4. Evaluating the performance of the system in a real-world environment is an essential aspect of robotic system design. Several Naturalistic Field Operation Tests(N-FOT) have been conducted around the world to evaluate the performance of automated vehicles using real-world data[ref]4. In a real-world setting, exposure to rare events is uncommon[ref]4. So this naturalistic data based approach or distance based approach needs to collect a large number of miles of data to make statistically significant observations. Although real-world testing is an important step in the development process, these approaches are time-consuming and expensive. Recently, a significant body of research focused on scenario-based testing has been presented as alternative option to validate the SUT compared to naturalistic data based approach78. This type of approach is based on the assumption that most scenarios in the real world are non-critical and there is a need to generate critical scenarios intentionally89. Hence, it can reduce the required validation effort as a scenario based approach is focused directly on the relevant critical scenarios89. In , scenarios are parameterised and stored in a database. Then, Monte-Carlo simulations are run to generate test cases from the parameterised scenarios. Similarly, in [ref]4, frequency distributions are extracted from the real-world data, and Monte-Carlo simulations are used to generate test cases by sampling from these distributions.\nThe ENABLE-S3 project utilises the work from  for the validation process. A method to extract the scenarios from real-world data is demonstrated by parameterising these scenarios. Then test cases can be derived from the frequency distribution generated during the parameterisation. Similarly, in Pegasus, data from different sources are used to cluster similar scenarios together to generate logical scenarios. Test cases (concrete scenarios) are created based on the logical scenarios. One of the challenges of scenario-based testing is parameter space explosion . The scenario-based testing approach has to consider a high number of influential parameters. This leads to a high dimensional parameter space for validation, resulting in parameter space explosion. In other words, this approach requires a large number of concrete scenarios per logical scenario. In , a functional decomposition method is proposed to reduce the effect of the parameter space explosion. Waymo recreates the scenarios from the real-world data in simulation and generates thousand of variations of the recreated scenarios to validate the system. They heavily rely on simulation to identify the critical events that are not encountered during real-world testing by creating variations of each scenario. This approach enables them to release software updates quickly rather than requiring millions of additional miles for validation.  presents an interesting approach for validating the autonomous vehicles at a pedestrian crossing. They have proposed a method to find for most likely failure scenarios using a process called Adaptive Stress Testing. The primary strategy of the approach is to search for the most critical scenarios. Nevertheless, as there are no constraints on the variation of parameters this approach could generate non realistic scenarios, with non-smooth trajectories from the simulated participants. In our work, an efficient falsification approach to evaluate the SUT is proposed. The method searches for critical scenarios by considering the generation of scenarios as a parameter optimisation problem. The scenarios are constructed by varying the parameters and applying a loss function to optimise towards challenging scenarios. The approach is an optimisation-guided falsification method, and the optimisation process tends the scenarios towards the challenging cases with the maximum cost. In this work, we use NAS as an optimisation engine to create challenging scenarios. Figure 5 is the high-level overview of the proposed method where the search space represents the selected parameters and the search strategy is the optimisation approach. A new scenario is generated in the simulation using a mixture of the values for each parameter. The reward function is used to determine the level of safety risk in the generated scenario created from a new set of generated parameters. The reward function used is based on a combination of the Responsibility Sensitive Safety (RSS) metric, the euclidean distance of pedestrian w.r.t ego-vehicle, and the instance of a collision.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: a human driver.
