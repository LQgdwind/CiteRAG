      "content": "Paper Title: Veni, Vidi, Vici: Solving the Myriad of Challenges before Knowledge Graph Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nKnowledge Graphs (KGs) are semantic data stores that model data as a set of nodes and the relations between them . The atomic unit of knowledge in a knowledge graph is the triple, which consists of a single labelled head node, a labelled tail node, and a directed, labelled edge that relates the head to the tail. For example, the fact ”Sauron created the One Ring” could be written as (Sauron, created, One-Ring). The graph structure of KGs lends them very naturally to a variety of intrinsically networked datasets, such as social networks, computer networked systems, and biomedical drug-gene interaction networks. However, KG data has grown to a size that precludes human analysis without computational assistance. For example, Hetionet, a common benchmark dataset for drug repurposing in bioinformatics, contains 2.25M triples – far more than a human can analyse alone . Other large KGs can range from 1M to 21M triples  [ref]4. In order to empower human use of these massive KGs, various KG learning systems have been proposed to detect patterns and predict new information in the domain of a given KG. Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) use machine learning to attempt to represent the semantics of a KG in vector space   . Other KG learning approaches include logical and rule-based methods  [ref]8 , path-based methods  0, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) 1 2 3 4. KG learning systems have made significant progress in assisting with research tasks, such as drug re-purposing  5 5 and drug-drug interaction prediction 6 7. However, recent literature has identified some major shortcomings of the current state-of-the-art approaches to KG learning systems. The first shortcoming is that most existing KG learning systems do not account for the logical structure of the data, which means that these systems typically cannot use an expert-curated ontologies even if they are available    2 8. Moreover, application of KGEs to real-world problems, notably including high-potential-impact uses such as medical drug repurposing and predictions about drugs and diseases in the biomedical context, are mostly done on methods that make no attempt to model the logical structure of the data 9 0 1 2. This means that many logical and causal inferences the humans care about most are not well accounted for, either in theory or in practice. Moreover, KG learning systems have been shown to suffer from biases due to varying distributions of node degrees: high-degree nodes are generally learned much more reliably and with much greater embedding quality than low-degree nodes across various KG learning methods 3 4 5. Despite their generally superior embedding quality, high-degree nodes can also have detrimental effects on KG learning systems 5 3, to the point that removing high-degree domain-relevant data from the KG can boost performance 5. KG learning systems also often lack the focus that is desired by human researchers and clinicians: while in many cases KG learning systems are only used for predicting certain types of facts in a graph, those models are trained to predict all types of facts with equal emphasis on each one 5. Most widely-used KG learning systems do not calculate or use uncertainty or relevance scores for triples, which further prevents the model from focusing on the most relevant and most reliable information    6. Finally, most KG learning systems were not created or evaluated for explainability   5  0 2 4 7. Some logical methods do allow explainability  [ref]8 8; however, with few exceptions, these logical approaches generally cannot handle large KGs . Moreover, there is no agreed-upon definition or concrete metric for explainability for KG learning systems, which makes comparison of progress in this area a challenge in itself 7 9. As a result, not only are KG learning systems opaque to humans, but critically detecting the presence and cause of the other 3 problems is severely hindered by the black-box nature of most KG learning systems. Individually, these problems are each a major setback for human-AI empowerment and advancements in the realm of KGs. Taken together, they present a bleak outlook for the use of KG learning techniques and suggest an urgent need for corrective innovation and development within the field. In this position paper, we first formalise definitions and nomenclatures for each of these four problems: lack of expert knowledge integration, instability to extreme topological variation, inability to perform focused learning, and lack of explainability. We present the details of each problem and give a review of state-of-the-art techniques that attempt to address each one. Our analysis leads us to the conclusion that the state-of-the-art is deficient not only because of a general lack of robust answers to these problems, but because existing solutions tend to address only one of these problems while ignoring the others. We conclude by presenting our ”Veni, Vidi, Vici” framework for how to represent and consider diverse problems in the same conceptual space to best empower humans with robust, interpretable, and reliable learning systems. Finally, we propose that use of the ”Veni, Vidi, Vici” model will allow researchers to not only greatly advance KG learning systems past these major challenges, but also fundamentally strengthen the machine learning-human interface in many different domains.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Hetionet, a common benchmark dataset for drug repurposing in bioinformatics, contains 2.25M triples – far more than a human can analyse alone .
