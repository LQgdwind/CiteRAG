      "content": "Paper Title: FactoFormer: Factorized Hyperspectral Transformers with Self-Supervised Pretraining\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhen comparing FactoFormer with MAEST, which is the current state-of-the-art method using a transformer with a self-supervised pretraining approach, our method outperforms it with 7.15%, 4.13%, and 0.58% higher OA on Indian Pines, University of Pavia and Houston 2013 datasets respectively. It shows that our novel factorized approach with self-supervised pretraining improves performance significantly. Also, interestingly our models converge with less than 100 epochs during fine-tuning on all three datasets, whereas, in MAEST, the models are fine-tuned for more than 200 epochs. It again highlights that the factorized pretraining in FactoFormer learns rich feature representations, which enables fast convergence during fine-tuning. Also, FactoFormer is computationally more efficient in terms of the number of model parameters and run-time, which is briefly discussed in Section VI-C under computational efficiency. Compared to SpectralFormer [ref]13, which is a fully supervised transformer-based approach, FactoFormer outperforms it by 9.54% on Indian Pines, 4.12% on University of Pavia and 1.12% on Houston 2013 datasets highlighting the importance of factorization and pretraining. ViT[ref]27 shows the least performance of all the transformer methods, as it is applied directly as in images for spectral tokens in HSI without adapting it to suit the structure of hyperspectral data. In general, SpectralFormer[ref]13, MAEST, and FactoFormer perform better than all other classic backbone networks and conventional classifiers in all three datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of transformer-based approaches for HSI. 2-D CNN performs better compared to 1-D CNN, RNN and miniGCN on all three datasets. When comparing 2-D CNN , FactoFormer achieves 15.41%, 9.14%, and 5.41% higher accuracy on Indian Pines, University of Pavia and Houston 2013 datasets, respectively. This significant performance gap exhibits the effectiveness of FactoFormer over CNN-based approaches. In order to demonstrate the robust performance of FactoFormer across more challenging datasets, we conducted experiments with the WHU-HI dataset, which comprises three UAV-borne datasets. We compared the performance against previous state-of-the-art transformer-based methods. FactoFormer achieved 3.96%, 8.34%, and 5.33% higher overall accuracy than MAEST  and 5%, 3.34%, and 2.1% higher overall accuracy than SpectralFormer [ref]13 on the WHU-Hi-LongKou, WHU-Hi-HanChuan, and WHU-Hi-HongHu datasets, respectively. These three datasets have high spectral resolution with around 270 bands, which is crucial for learning and distinguishing subtle differences between different crop species. The performance improvement with our method demonstrates that utilizing both spatial and spectral features in FactoFormer is important, especially with downstream tasks like precise crop classification, where variations in spectra among different species are not very significant. This stands in contrast to the approach of focusing only on spectra, as seen in SpectralFormer [ref]13 and MAEST .\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: is computationally more efficient in terms of the number of model parameters and run-time, which is briefly discussed in Section VI-C under computational efficiency.
