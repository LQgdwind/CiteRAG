The normal\nand tangential components of the vector field on each boundary can be\nseparated and prescribed in a mathematically consistent\nsetting [ref]32  . Specifically without the\nneed for definition of a facet normal at mesh vertices. There is no\nrequirement for the constraint matrix CC\\mathrm{C} to be constructed. Simply\nassembly of the stiffness matrix AA\\mathrm{A}. And there is no requirement for\ngrowth in the block size of the underlying linear system, also simplifying\npreconditioning. The implementation challenge lies in a user–friendly\ninterface for defining a boundary condition by Nitsche’s method.
