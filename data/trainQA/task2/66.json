      "content": "Paper Title: WiSM: Windowing Surrogate Model for Evaluation of Curvature-Constrained Tours with Dubins vehicle\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe proposed Windowing Surrogate Model (WiSM) has been evaluated in combination with the evolutionary algorithm presented in Section IV and the combined method is further denoted WiSM-EA.\nThe solved DTSP instances are of various sizes and different densities of the locations. The performance of the WiSM-EA is compared with the existing DTSP approaches.\nNamely, the Alternating Algorithm (AA) , the Local Iterative Optimization (LIO) , and the Sampling-based Algorithm (SA) .\nThe SA transforms the problem to the Generalized TSP that is further transformed into Asymmetric TSP solved by the LKH solver . As a baseline, we take the decoupled approach from  where the DTSP solution takes the location sequence ΣΣ\\Sigma from the solution of the corresponding Euclidean TSP (obtained by the Concorde solver [ref]16).\nThe headings ΘΘ\\Theta are consequently determined by the IRIS method.\nBesides, we also initially considered the Memetic algorithm ; however, the achieved results are not competitive with the selected approaches regarding the solution quality and computational requirements.\nTherefore it is not included in the reported results. The DTSP methods were compared using instances, randomly generated similarly to .\nThe benchmark set consists of 10 instances per each possible pair (n,d)𝑛𝑑(n,d), where n∈{25,100,500}𝑛25100500n\\in\\{25,100,500\\} denotes the number of target locations and d∈{0.1,1,10}𝑑0.1110d\\in\\{0.1,1,10\\} is the density of the locations.\nThe targets 𝒯𝒯\\mathcal{T} of each instance were uniformly sampled from a square region with a side b=n/d𝑏𝑛𝑑b=\\sqrt{n/d}, i.e., ti∈[−12​b,12​b]×[−12​b,12​b]subscript𝑡𝑖12𝑏12𝑏12𝑏12𝑏t_{i}\\in\\left[-\\frac{1}{2}b,\\frac{1}{2}b\\right]\\times\\left[-\\frac{1}{2}b,\\frac{1}{2}b\\right]. Due to unknown optimal solutions of the DTSP instances, the results are evaluated using the normalized cost defined as where C​(Σbase,Θbase)𝐶subscriptΣbasesubscriptΘbaseC(\\Sigma_{\\text{base}},\\Theta_{\\text{base}}) is the cost provided by the baseline. The headings ΘΘ\\Theta for the baseline and also for the WiSM-EA (Line 1, Algorithm 1) were determined using IRIS  with the maximum number of samples set to kmax=1024subscript𝑘max1024k_{\\text{max}}=1024. The parameters used by the evolutionary algorithm were: the population size N=100𝑁100N=100, tournament size t=3𝑡3t=3, mutation probability pm=0.8subscript𝑝𝑚0.8p_{m}=0.8, and elitist size e=20𝑒20e=20. The WiSM-EA was implemented in Julia language , run with -O3 and --check-bounds=no options and the computational requirements were further significantly decreased by caching model approximations C¯​(Σw,i)¯𝐶subscriptΣ𝑤𝑖\\overline{C}(\\Sigma_{w,i}) using Σw,isubscriptΣ𝑤𝑖\\Sigma_{w,i} as a key.\nThe IRIS method (called from Line 1, Algorithm 1) and also all the other algorithms (AA, LIO, SA) were implemented in C++ and compiled by the gcc compiler with -O3 and -march=native flags, which also holds for the LKH.\nIn all the cases, the algorithms were run on a single core of the Intel Xeon Gold 6130 @ 2.10 GHztimes2.10GHz2.10\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{G}\\mathrm{H}\\mathrm{z} processor.\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: As a baseline, we take the decoupled approach from  where the DTSP solution takes the location sequence ΣΣ\\Sigma from the solution of the corresponding Euclidean TSP (obtained by the Concorde solver [ref]16).\nThe headings ΘΘ\\Theta are consequently determined by the IRIS method.\nBesides, we also initially considered the Memetic algorithm ; however, the achieved results are not competitive with\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
