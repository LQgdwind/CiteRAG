Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Qualitative and quantitative results are shown in Fig. 4 and Tab. 1. Our model is validated in three aspects: the perceptual quality of inversion, the ability of editing, and the model size. MSE and LPIPS evaluate the pixel and perceptual similarity of input and inverted images. FID [ref]13 and SWD [ref]28 measure the distance between two distributions of real and generated images, indicating the visual quality of generated images. To compare the editing ability of three methods, we adopt InterFaceGAN  in face domain to edit the latent codes generated by each method. For car domain, we apply GANSpace  to find the semantic directions. The metrics are averaged over the editing results of the whole test set.\nOur model is outperformed in inversion and of higher editability. Moreover, we list the parameters, FLOPs and inference time of three methods in Tab. 1. Compared with Convnet, the transformer used in our model has only 18 or 16 tokens for face and car domain, hence it is lightweight and efficient.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: We compare our model with pSp  and e4e [ref]33, which are two state-of-the-art encoder-based inversion methods.
