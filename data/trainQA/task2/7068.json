      "content": "Paper Title: RobustEdge: Low Power Adversarial Detection for Cloud-Edge Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAdversarial attacks have the following objective: Here, C(.)C(.) denotes the classifer model’s predictions, W𝑊W is the classifier weights, x𝑥x is the natural input data and δ𝛿\\delta is the perturbation added to the input. Based on the input, δ𝛿\\delta is computed using the gradient (in case of gradient-based attacks) and loss (decision-based attacks) information from the classifier model  [ref]9 [ref]21. δ𝛿\\delta is constrained by the parameter ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon such that attacks are imperceptible to human eyes. There have been several effective adversarial attacks proposed in literature which are described below: Gradient-based attacks: To generate these attacks, a forward and backward propagation is performed on the classifier model. To create the adversarial image for input x𝑥x, the gradient of loss with respect to x𝑥x (∂ℒ∂xℒ𝑥\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x}) is used. The Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) is a simple one-step adversarial attack proposed in [ref]22. Several works have shown that FGSM attack can be made stronger with momentum (MIFGSM), random initialization (FFGSM), and input diversification (DIFGSM). In contrast, the Basic Iterative Method (BIM) is an iterative attack proposed in [ref]22. The BIM attack with random restarts is called the Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack [ref]9. A targeted version of the PGD attack (TPGD)  can fool the model into mis-classifying a data as a desired class. Other multi-step attacks like Carlini-Wagner (C&W)  and PGD-L2 [ref]9 are crafted by computing the L2 Norm distance between the adversarial and natural images. Score-based attacks: Score-based attacks do not require input gradients to craft adversaries. Instead these attacks use the classifier’s loss information to maximize the attack strength. Square attack (SQR) [ref]21 uses multiple queries to perturb randomly selected square regions in the input. Other score-based attacks like the AutoAttack (AUTO) and Auto-PGD (APGD) craft adversaries by automatically choosing the optimal attack parameters . The Gaussian Noise (GN) attack is created by adding gaussian noise with standard deviation of strenght ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon to the input.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: added to the input. Based on the input, δ𝛿\\delta is computed using the gradient (in case of gradient-based attacks) and loss (decision-based attacks) information from the classifier model  [ref]9 [ref]21. δ𝛿\\delta is constrained by the parameter ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon such that attacks are imperceptible to human eyes. There have been several effective adversarial attacks proposed in\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
