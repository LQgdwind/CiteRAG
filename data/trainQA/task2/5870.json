      "content": "Paper Title: Dice Semimetric Losses: Optimizing the Dice Score with Soft Labels\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImage segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis. One of the key design choices in many segmentation pipelines that are based on neural networks lies in the selection of the loss function. In fact, the choice of loss function goes hand in hand with the metrics chosen to assess the quality of the predicted segmentation . The intersection-over-union (IoU) and the Dice score are commonly used metrics because they reflect both size and localization agreement, and they are more in line with perceptual quality compared to, e.g., pixel-wise accuracy [ref]10 . Consequently, directly optimizing the IoU or the Dice score using differentiable surrogates as (a part of) the loss function has become prevalent in semantic segmentation  2 [ref]10 6 . In medical imaging in particular, the Dice score and the soft Dice loss (SDL)   have become the standard practice, and some reasons behind its superior functioning have been uncovered and further optimizations have been explored [ref]10 [ref]3 . Another mechanism to further improve the predicted segmentation that has gained significant interest in recent years, is the use of soft labels during training. Soft labels can be the result of data augmentation techniques such as label smoothing (LS)  3 and are integral to regularization methods such as knowledge distillation (KD)  . Their role is to provide additional regularization so as to make the model less prone to overfitting   and to combat overconfidence , e.g., providing superior model calibration . In medical imaging, soft labels emerge not only from LS or KD, but are also present inherently due to considerable intra- and inter-rater variability. For example, multiple annotators often disagree on organ and lesion boundaries, and one can average their annotations to obtain soft label maps  5  7. This work investigates how the medical imaging community can combine the use of SDL with soft labels to reach a state of synergy. While the original SDL surrogate was posed as a relaxed form of the Dice score, naively inputting soft labels to SDL is possible (e.g. in open-source segmentation libraries 1  2 ), but it tends to push predictions towards 0-1 outputs rather than make them resemble the soft labels [ref]3  . Consequently, the use of SDL when dealing with soft labels might not align with a user’s expectations, with potential adverse effects on the Dice score, model calibration and volume estimation [ref]3. Motivated by this observation, we first (in Sect. 2) propose two probabilistic extensions of SDL, namely, Dice semimetric losses (DMLs). These losses satisfy the conditions of a semimetric and are fully compatible with soft labels. In a standard setting with hard labels, DMLs are identical to SDL and can safely replace SDL in existing implementations. Secondly (in Sect. 3), we perform extensive experiments on the public QUBIQ, LiTS and KiTS benchmarks to empirically confirm the potential synergy of DMLs with soft labels (e.g. averaging, LS, KD) over hard labels (e.g. majority voting, random selection).\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: (IoU) and the Dice score are commonly used metrics because they reflect both size and localization agreement, and they are more in line with perceptual quality compared to, e.g., pixel-wise accuracy [ref]10 .
