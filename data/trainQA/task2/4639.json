      "content": "Paper Title: Risk Aware Adaptive Belief-dependent Probabilistically Constrained Continuous POMDP PlanningThis work was partially supported by the Israel Science Foundation (ISF).\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDecision making under uncertainty in partially observable domains is a key capability for reliable autonomous agents. Commonly, the basis of the state-of-the-art algorithms for decision making under uncertainty is the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). The robot does not have access to its state. Instead, it maintains a distribution, named the belief, over the state given all its current information, namely, the history of actions and the observations alongside the prior belief. The decision maker shall maintain and reason about the evolution of the belief within the planning phase. At the same time, the robot‚Äôs online goal is to find an optimal action for its current belief. Unfortunately, an exact solution of POMDP is unfeasible .\nA critical limitation of the classical POMDP formulation is the assumption that the belief-dependent reward is nothing more than the expectation of state-dependent reward with respect to belief . Another limiting assumption in many state-of-the-art algorithms is the discrete domain, e.g., discrete state and observation spaces 8, . In contrast, we tackle the continuous domain in terms of state and observation spaces. Augmenting POMDP with general belief-dependent rewards is a long-standing problem. Unravelling it would allow information theoretic rewards, which are extremely important in numerous problems in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robotics, such as autonomous exploration, Belief Space Planning (BSP) , and active Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) . The belief-dependent reward formulation is known as œÅùúå\\rho-POMDP , [ref]7. Earlier techniques focused on offline solvers and extended Œ±ùõº\\alpha-vectors approach to piecewise linear and convex ,  or Lipschitz-continuous rewards [ref]7. These extended solvers are also limited to discrete domains in terms of states and observations. Continuous spaces and general belief-dependent rewards render many off-the-shelf POMDP solvers not applicable. Another way to incorporate general belief-dependent rewards is to reformulate POMDP as Belief-MDP (BMDP) and use more recent online solvers designed for MDP. These algorithms are suitable for continuous domains and challenging nonparametric beliefs represented by particles.\nSeminal approaches in this category are Sparse Sampling (SS) 2, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) 9, and its efficient, simplified variant . Such an MCTS running on BMDP is called a Particle Filter Tree with Double Progressive Widening (PFT-DPW) 9. The described limitation of discrete state and observation spaces also applies to recently appeared chance constrained approaches, gaining attention. The motivation to add the chance constraints is to introduce the notion of risk into the problem. Initially, the planning community focused on collision avoidance, formulating it as a chance constraint. For example,  is limited to Gaussian parameterized beliefs. Applying Kalman filter on the linearized system, the  tracks the distribution (modeled as a Gussian) over possible state estimates alongside the (Gaussian) posterior beliefs. Each posterior, conditioned on the history of actions and observations, is then regarded as conditional on the sole state estimate and multiplied by the probability density of the state estimate. This way, the joint distribution of state and state estimates is obtained. The chance constraint is calculated on the marginal of such a joint distribution which is the probability of the state propagated solely with actions and without the observations. In this way, on the selected by  optimal action sequence, the probability of collision is the probability of the robot‚Äôs final state obtained solely with actions and without the observations. Such a formulation does not apply to general beliefs represented by particles, nor is it a truly risk-averse constraint. We extensively debate this claim in the paper. More recent works examine a discrete domain and a belief-dependent constraint being the first moment of the state-dependent constraint 4. Moreover, 4 provides only a local solution. Another line of work considers chance constraints 7. The paper 7 introduces the algorithm RAO* which uses admissible heuristics for the action value function (QùëÑQ-function) in the belief space. This aspect is problematic with general belief-dependent rewards. However, this is not a main point of this work. Moreover, the RAO* algorithm prunes not feasible actions using a necessary condition of the feasibility of chance constraint (See Appendix E) . In other words, the chance constraint may be violated, but the action has not been pruned. In fact, this is one of our main points in this paper. Since the condition is only necessary, after pruning it is still required to verify feasibility of each kept action. This significantly complicates the algorithmic and inflict unnecessary computational burden. It would be much easier if after pruning we would know that remained actions satisfy the constraint. Similar to the situation with belief-dependent rewards reformulation POMDP as Belief-MDP (BMDP) can possibly allow employing approaches designed for Probabilistically constrained MDP 0, . However, the theory presented in these papers does not apply to parametric nor nonparametric Belief-MDP due to various assumptions made by the authors. This is one of the gaps we aim to fill in this work. In this paper, we formulate a novel two-staged approach to enhance continuous belief-dependent POMDP with belief-dependent probabilistic constraint. Typically algorithms designed for general beliefs represent the belief as a set of particles and use a particle filter [ref]22 for nonparametric Bayesian updates.\nIn this work, we assume the setting of nonparametric beliefs, although our formulations also support a parametric setting.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: Robotics, such as autonomous exploration, Belief Space Planning (BSP) , and active Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) .
