      "content": "Paper Title: Robust Proxy: Improving Adversarial Robustness by Robust Proxy Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved great performance in various machine learning tasks   . Despite the phenomenal success of DNNs, they are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks   [ref]6   . By adding small and imperceptible perturbation to input data (i.e., adversarial examples), adversarial perturbations can effectively fool DNNs. Such vulnerability of DNNs could lead to security problems and the loss of the reliability of DNNs. To mitigate the potential threat of adversarial attacks, a number of defenses have been proposed [ref]6 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7. Among the existing defenses, Adversarial Training (AT) has been demonstrated to be the most effective defense strategy 8 9. It trains DNNs with adversarial examples by solving min-max optimization problems between the adversarial perturbation and model parameters. However, some recent works started tackling the limitation of existing adversarial training schemes through the lens of feature representation 0 1 2 3 4 5. They claim that well-generalized feature representation could improve the adversarial robustness. To enhance the feature representation, they apply AT framework to a self-supervised or unsupervised learning scheme such as SimCLR 3 4. However, they just applied the existing representation learning framework to AT framework, there is a lack of a deeper understanding of adversarially robust feature representation. In the lens of adversarial robustness, it has been known that the disagreement between standard and adversarial robustness stems from differently trained features representation 6 7 8. The vulnerability of DNNs arises from naturally learned non-robust feature components, and they are highly correlated with adversarial prediction. Ilyas et al. 6 demonstrated that features consist of robust and non-robust components. They claimed that the adversarial examples are directly attributed to the presence of non-robust components and these non-robust components are brittle by adversarial perturbations while useful for prediction in the standard setting. Kim et al. 7 explicitly distilled features into the robust and non-robust components. Specifically, they disentangled features into the robust and non-robust channels. Then, they showed that the vulnerability mainly stems from non-robust channels rather than robust channels. The aforementioned analyses of the adversarial vulnerability commonly argue that the feature representations that are learned to correctly predict and robustly predict are different. Therefore, to improve adversarial robustness, it is necessary to learn adversarially robust feature representations. Although there are many studies to identify the robust and non-robust features, only a few works have been conducted to exploit these robust and non-robust features. Based on the aforementioned adversarially robust feature representation view, in this paper, we raise the following intriguing, yet thus far overlooked questions: ‚ÄúHow can we make DNNs learn the adversarially robust feature?‚Äù To address the question, in this paper, we generate class representative robust features for all classes. Then, with the generated features, we train DNNs to explicitly learn adversarially robust features. To generate the robust feature, firstly, we employ a feature distillation method proposed in 7 and distill the feature into robust and non-robust channels. With the distilled features, we quantify the effect of the non-robust channels on the prediction by the gradient of them. Then, we optimize the input to minimize the magnitude of the gradient of non-robust channels. Specifically, we add a Robust Perturbation (RP, rùëür) to input data and optimize the perturbation to reduce the gradient of non-robust channels. After that, we extend the process of optimizing robust perturbation to the process of optimizing Class-wise Robust Perturbation (CRP, rksuperscriptùëüùëòr^{k}). The CRP is added to any input data corresponding to the target class kùëòk and makes the input robust against adversarial perturbation. To optimize CRP, we exploit the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) optimization which is considered a successful recipe for finding classifiers with small population risk. Specifically, we propose a novel optimization process called Class-wise ERM Optimization (CEO). In the CEO algorithm, we quantify the empirical risk of the target class as the expectation of gradient for the non-robust channels. Then, we optimize CRP to reduce the gradient. Through empirical and theoretical analysis, we show that CRP makes the corresponding class input not easily attacked by adversarial perturbation and provides a robust prediction. With the optimized CRP, we generate a class-representative robust feature called Robust Proxy. To generate a robust proxy, we randomly sample each class image from the training dataset and add CRP to the corresponding class images. Then, we extract features from the CRP-added images and use the features as robust proxies. During the training, DNNs explicitly learn the representation of robust proxy through the proposed robust proxy learning framework. For each proxy, we pull the data of the same class close to the proxy and push others away in the feature space, allowing the model to explicitly learn adversarially robust features. The major contributions of the paper are as follows. We propose a novel way to generate adversarially robust features by optimizing robust perturbation. Then, we extend the robust perturbation to class-wise robust perturbation to generate class-representative robust features. With the CRP, we train DNNs with the proposed learning framework called Robust Proxy Learning. In the proposed method, we train the DNNs to explicitly learn adversarially robust features by using robust proxies. Through extensive experiments, we show that we could explicitly learn robust features and improve the robustness.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: Recently, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved great performance in various machine learning tasks   .
