      "content": "Paper Title: Matryoshka: Non-Exclusive Memory Tiering via Transactional Page Migration\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA long line of pioneering work has explored a wide range of of tiered storage/memory systems, built upon SSDs and HDDs         , DRAM and disks    , HBM and DRAMs   , NUMA memory  [ref]3, PM and DRAM    [ref]14, local and far memory  5   , DRAM and CXL memory   [ref]34, and multiple tiers  9   . We focus on tiered memory systems consisting of DRAM and emerging CXL memory, though the proposed approaches in Matryoshka also apply to other tiered memory systems such as HBM/DRAM and DRAM/PM. We discuss the most related works as follows. Lightweight memory access tracking: To mitigate software overhead associated with memory access tracking, Hotbox  employs two separate scanners for fast and slow tiers to scan the slow tier at a fixed rate while the local tier at an adaptive rate, configurable based on the local memory pressure. Memtis [ref]34 adjusts its PEBS-based sampling rate to ensure its overhead is under a threshold (e.g., < 3%). TMTS 2 also adopts a periodic scanning mechanism to detect frequency along with hardware sampling to more timely detect newly hot pages. While these approaches balance scanning/sampling overhead and tracking accuracy, an “always-on” profiling component does not seem practical, especially for high-pressure workloads. Instead, thermostat [ref]14 samples a small fraction of pages, while DAMON [ref]3 monitors memory access at a coarser-grained granularity (i.e., region). Although both can effectively reduce the scanning overhead, coarse granularity leads to lower accuracy regarding page access patterns. On the other hand, to reduce the overhead associated with frequent hint page faults like AutoNUMA , TPP  enables the page-fault based detection only for CXL memory (i.e., the slow tier) and tries to promote a page promptly (e.g., when it encounters a page fault); prompt page promotion avoids subsequent page faults on the same page. Inspired by existing lightweight tracking systems, such as Linux’s active and inactive lists and hint page faults, Matryoshka advances them by incorporating more recency information with no additional CPU overhead. Unlike hardware-assisted approaches [ref]34 2 , Matryoshka does not require any additional hardware support. Page migration optimizations: To hide reclamation overhead from applications, TPP  decouples page allocation and reclamation; however, page migration remains in the critical path, incurring significant slowdowns. Nimble  focuses on mitigating page migration overhead with new migration mechanisms, including transparent huge page migration and concurrent multi-page migration. Memtis [ref]34 further moves page migration out of the critical path using a kernel thread to promote/demote pages in the background. TMTS 2 leverage a user/kernel collaborative approach to control page migration. In contrast, Matryoshka aims to achieve prompt, on-demand page migration while moving page migration off the critical path. It is orthogonal to and can benefit from existing page migration optimizations. The most related work is , which leverages hardware support to pin data in caches, enabling access to pages during migration. Again, Matryoshka does not need additional hardware support.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: A long line of pioneering work has explored a wide range of of tiered storage/memory systems, built upon SSDs and HDDs         , DRAM and disks    , HBM and DRAMs   , NUMA memory  [ref]3, PM and DRAM    [ref]14, local and far memory  5   , DRAM and CXL memory   [ref]34, and multiple tiers  9   .
