      "content": "Paper Title: Fearless Asynchronous Communications with Timed Multiparty Session Protocols\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBocchi et al.¬† propose a timed extension of MPST to model real-time choreographic interactions, while\nBocchi et al.¬† extend¬†binary session types with time constraints, introducing\na subtyping relation and a blocking receive primitive with timeout in their calculus. In contrast to their strategies to avoid time-related failures, as discussed in¬†¬ß‚Äã¬†1 and¬†2, ATMP focuses on actively managing failures as they occur, offering a distinct approach to handling timed communication. Iraci et al.¬†\nextend synchronous binary session types\nwith a periodic recursion primitive to model rate-based processes.\nTo align their design with real-time systems, they encode time into a periodic construct, synchronised with a global clock. With¬†rate compatibility,\na relation that facilitates communication between processes with different periods by\nsynthesising and verifying a common superperiod type, their approach ensures that well-typed processes\nremain free from rate errors during any specific period.\nOn the contrary, ATMP integrates time constraints directly into communication through local clocks,\nresulting in distinct time behaviour. Intriguingly, our method of time encoding can adapt to theirs,\nwhile the opposite is not feasible.\nConsequently, not all the timed protocols in our paper, e.g.¬†Fig.¬†1(b), can be accurately\nrepresented in their system. Moreover, due to its binary and synchronous features,\ntheir theory does not directly model and ensure the properties of real distributed systems. Le Brun et al.¬†[ref]34 develop a theory of multiparty\nsession types that accounts for different failure scenarios, including message losses, delays, reordering,\nas well as link failures and network partitioning.\nUnlike¬†ATMP, their approach does not integrate time specifications\nor address failures specifically related to time.\nInstead,\nthey use timeout as a generic message label for failure branches,\nwhich triggers the failure detection mechanism.\nFor example, in¬†[ref]34, s‚Äã[ùöô].ùüé.ùë†delimited-[]ùöô0{\\color[rgb]{0,0,0}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0,0,0}{{\\color[rgb]{0,0,0}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0,0,0}s}}[{{\\color[rgb]{0.5,0.0,0.0}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0.5,0.0,0.0}\\boldsymbol{{\\color[rgb]{0.5,0.0,0.0}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0.5,0.0,0.0}\\mathtt{p}}}}}]}{\\scriptsize\\textifclk{\\char 155\\relax}}\\mathbin{{\\color[rgb]{0,0,0}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0,0,0}\\!.\\!}}{\\color[rgb]{0,0,0}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0,0,0}\\mathbf{0}} denotes a timeout branch, where \nis the timeout notation representing\na non-deterministic time duration that a process waits before assuming a failure has arisen.\nExcept for¬†, all the mentioned works\non session types with time are purely theoretical.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: in their system.
