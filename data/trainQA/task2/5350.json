      "content": "Paper Title: Collective Privacy Recovery: Data-sharing Coordination via Decentralized Artificial Intelligence\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe findings reveal that a significant privacy recovery is attainable within the modus operandi of a data collective. This is a radical shift from the mainstream thought of privacy as a personal value to privacy as a collective value , a public good shared within a community of citizens generating data. Coordinated data sharing supported by a trustworthy decentralized AI automates and scales up collective arrangements for sharing under the doctrine ‘as little as possible as much as necessary’. Such optimized arrangements would be otherwise too complex and expensive to achieve in a transparent way with existing top-down privacy policies and regulations or even with automated data-access committees . Findings also reveal that data collectives create tangible benefits for online service providers that collect or access data shared in a coordinated way: data collection costs drop down dramatically and data are used more purposefully to deliver the required quality of service. This can create further remarkable cost reductions such as reduced data storage, security, energy and carbon footprint costs as well as costs for solving legal disputes that are more likely to incur when dealing with excessive personal data. Within rising information asymmetries and monopolies of knowledge in existing data markets and big tech, the capability of data collectives to coordinate data sharing at large-scale has been so far a gap  . This is underlined in promising solutions from political and economic theory such as data-owning democracy , digital socialism  and peer-to-peer digital commons [ref]50. Establishing data collectives at a community or municipality level can create alternative forms of data ownership and control; they can empower citizens participation based on an agenda of using digital assets for priorities such as social welfare and environmental sustainability  [ref]51. These blueprints can be the basis of alternative data-market designs that encourage business models based on social innovation without over-relying on excessive free personal data. Data collectives can further benefit from scale, for instance, increasing individuals who coordinate their data-sharing decisions or increasing individuals’ contributions by generating more alternative data-sharing options. The AI system based on collective learning has a higher degree of freedom to calculate data-sharing choices that match the required data and recover more privacy in larger populations . It is also decentralized to make coordination more resilient to computational bottlenecks. Science can also benefit from data collectives. They can scale up open data and citizen science initiatives, while improving the transparency and reproducibility of research. Moreover, data collectives can be a response to the current opaque models of generative AI such as ChatGPT. Selective data shared as a result of coordination can be used to train open and more transparent generative AI models, ethically aligned to community values. This could be a new type of ‘curricula’ for training AI, institutionalized in a bottom-up way via data collectives. Choices under intrinsic and rewarded data sharing prioritize different criteria. Individuals better distinguish data collectors and contexts than the type of data they share. In contrast, rewarded individuals that give up privacy better distinguish the type of data they share, and in particular the GPS. Thus, rewards diminish the importance of who collects data and for what purpose. In this case, data collectors may have no competitive advantage against each other but instead excessive and irrelevant data that increase their costs and risks. The perceived privacy sensitivity of the data-sharing criteria explains different key data-sharing behaviors (groups), for instance, individuals who do not preserve privacy vs. individuals who sacrifice privacy under rewards. Raising awareness about the privacy sensitivity of data collectors can influence data-sharing decisions. This has implications for how privacy policies and data consents are designed to be more transparent and user-friendly. Data-sharing choices that preserve and give up significant privacy tend to polarize, thus highlighting the value of privacy for individuals who have it rather than for the ones who do not . Coordinated data sharing breaks this vicious cycle by redistributing the privacy cost within the individuals for the benefit of all. This demonstrates opportunities for digitally networked societies without borders to reconcile different cultural norms on privacy. Future work can unleash further opportunities to reclaim privacy in the digital age: Spatio-temporal coordinated data sharing can automate and scale up the “right to be forgotten\", which improves both privacy control and the willingness to share data, e.g. 10%-18% . The feasibility of collective learning using optimization scenarios in time and space are earlier demonstrated for Smart City applications . Nevertheless, defining and conveying to individuals the context of data use is not always straightforward and further work is required in this area, for instance, semantics and ontologies . Moreover, beyond purposeful data sharing, speculative data analysis out of a specific context can also encourage innovation and creativity. In such scenarios, data collectors may have a more significant role for trust in data-sharing decisions. The acceptance of coordinated data-sharing recommendations requires a follow up study, in particular, the incentives and the interface design of the AI system for the broader population. Notwithstanding, earlier results demonstrate significant coordination capacity even when large portions of the population are not flexible [ref]52. The explainability of coordinated data sharing based on decentralized AI is particularly challenging and is expected to further shield the trust on data collectives.\n\nReference markers found: [50]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]50: large-scale has been so far a gap  .
