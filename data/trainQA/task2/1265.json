      "content": "Paper Title: Comparison Graphs: a Unified Method for Uniformity Testing\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe field of property testing was initiated by¬†   and concerns with fast probabilistic algorithms that use query access to some large structure (such as graphs, functions, distribution, etc.) in order to determines whether a specific instance belong to a subclass of possible instances (e.g., connected graphs or monotone functions) or in some sense far from it.\nSpecifically for distributions, as formulated in¬†, we are given random samples from some unknown distribution, and we wish to decide with high probability (over the random samples) whether it has some property, or it is far from any distribution that does (typically we use ‚Ñì1subscript‚Ñì1\\ell_{1} as a distance measure).\nProperties of distributions were excessively studied through the years (see¬† [ref]12 for excellent surveys). Until recently, the vast majority of results were limited to the classic setting, where a single\nprocessor is given an oracle access, and performs the testing procedure. The measure of complexity is based solely on the number of samples, as typically the running time is polynomial in this number. However, distribution testing can be very useful in different frameworks as well.\nFor example, suppose we have a sensor network taking some measurements that need to be combined in order to make a decision about the subject of these measurements, be it volcanic activity, seismic movements, or any form of radiation. Another framework where testing is useful, is under constrained memory. One might try testing an object so big, that the number of samples needed is very large. In that scenario, even if one might endure a lengthly sampling process, storing all past samples at one given moment can be too costly. For example, imagine a large telescope collecting data on infrared radiation in a pursuit to discover new planets. These types of questions can be translated to a streaming model, where samples come as a stream, and one wish to store only a small amount of data while reliably test for a property of the underlying distribution. When considering the relatively similar motivations for these cases, one might even wonder about a combination of the two models, where multiple sensors spread out in some area collect samples, each of which has bounded memory. They will then need to process all available data within their memory constraints, such that by the end of each time period - they are able to report their individual findings concisely to some data center that aggregates all information in order to make an important decision. All of these questions are inherently multi-dimensional, in the sense that many incomparable resources are in play: the number of players, the number of samples, the memory space of each sensor, and even the amount of bits communicated.\nHere, we focus our efforts, for the most part, on minimizing the sample complexity (or amount of samples per player, when multiple players are involved), with other resources given as parameters. This specification is well-motivated by the case where we have no shortage of data we can sample from, and we wish to understand how long a sampling process should take, as a parameter of the number of sensors we use and their computational strength.\nThroughout the text, we focus on the task of uniformity testing, a key problem in the field of distribution testing. The most studied family of problems in distribution testing is arguably identity testing, where we want to test whether the input distribution PùëÉP is equal to some fixed distribution pùëùp, or œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon-far\nfrom it (in ‚Ñì1subscript‚Ñì1\\ell_{1}), where œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon is the proximity parameter of the problem.\nIn the heart of these problems stands the problem of uniformity testing, where p=UŒ©ùëùsubscriptùëàŒ©p=U_{\\Omega}.\nOne evidence for the importance of uniformity testing was shown in¬† and made more robust in¬†: it is actually complete for identity testing, in the sense that testing identity to any fixed distribution pùëùp can be reduced to testing uniformity instead.\nOn the other hand, uniformity testing is a specific case of other problems such as closeness testing and independence testing,\nso showing lower bounds for uniformity testing would imply lower bounds for these problems.\nThe classic version of testing uniformity was settled for the case œµ=Œ©‚Äã(n‚àí1/4)italic-œµŒ©superscriptùëõ14\\epsilon=\\Omega\\left(n^{-1/4}\\right) in¬†, showing that Œò‚Äã(n/œµ2)Œòùëõsuperscriptitalic-œµ2\\Theta\\left(\\sqrt{n}/\\epsilon^{2}\\right) samples are in fact sufficient and necessary.  later showed this holds for all values of œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon. The problem of uniformity testing was implicitly introduced in the paper¬†, as a way to test the expansion of a graph: when simulating multiple short random walks, and observing the distribution of the endpoint, one can connect a uniform distribution over these endpoint to good expansion of the graph.\nTo solve uniformity, the collision-based tester was introduced, where one simply counts the number of pairs of samples that have the same value. This tester was shown to have sample complexity of Œò‚Äã(n‚ãÖpoly‚Å°(1/œµ))Œò‚ãÖùëõpoly1italic-œµ\\Theta\\left(\\sqrt{n}\\cdot\\operatorname{poly}(1/\\epsilon)\\right), which is turned out to be sub-optimal in terms of œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon.\nHowever, several years after the question was settled, it was shown in¬† that the original collision-based tester also achieves optimal sample complexity, using a finer analysis. The idea behind the collision-based tester is rather straightforward: when comparing two samples from a distribution, the chance of both having the same value (also referred as collision probability) relates to the ‚Ñì2subscript‚Ñì2\\ell_{2} norm of the distribution. It is a well-known fact that over a fixed set Œ©Œ©\\Omega, the uniform distribution has the minimal ‚Ñì2subscript‚Ñì2\\ell_{2} norm. It is also rather easy to show that any distribution that is somewhat far from uniform (in statistical distance), has a significantly larger ‚Ñì2subscript‚Ñì2\\ell_{2} norm. This means that each comparison of two samples is an unbiased estimator of the collision probability (having the right expectation), but with very high variance. One would need to average over many such comparisons in order to reduce the variance. Over the years, numerous methods to test for uniformity have been proposed. Some of them had different goals in mind, such as testing with very high confidence, or in a multiparty model where each player gets a single sample (sometimes even wishing to keep it private). These methods include counting unique element¬†, modified œá2superscriptùúí2\\chi^{2} test¬†, using the empirical distance to uniformity¬†[ref]14, randomly hashing samples to a smaller domain¬† and more.\nIn both¬† [ref]17, testers that aim to overcome different constraints relied strongly on collision counting111These testers do not count collisions per se, but they add other steps to the algorithm. The results also use a more involved analysis. Considering it is also optimal in the classic setting, this makes collision-based testing a prime candidate for a more generic method to test uniformity, and hopefully adjust itself to different models easily. The original version of the collision-based tester takes a set of samples, and use comparisons between all pairs of samples. This is well-suited for the classic model, where one processor with no concrete limitations sees all the samples, and is able to perform all possible comparisons. However, in more constrained models, this simple task is inherently impossible. For example, a memory-constrained tester cannot store all previous samples in order to compare them with new ones.\nIn the simultaneous model, where each processor holds its own set of samples, a lot of communication might be needed to compare samples that are held by different processors.222For a specific pair of samples, this would require solving equality. When observing the two sets of samples held by the two processors, one can imagine a disjointness-type problem, which intuitively should be hard to solve accurately.\nIn distributed models, such as CONGEST and LOCAL (see¬†[ref]17), the problem is defined where each player in a network holds a single sample from a distribution (replacing one sample by a constant amount produces similar behaviour). In these models, it is much cheaper for player to compare their samples with those of a neighboring player, than it is to make such a comparison with players that are far away (on the network topology). To this end, we introduce the notion of comparison graphs. A comparison graph is linked to a collision-based tester (or algorithm) as follows: the vertices of the graph are the samples given as input, and the edges are pairs of samples that are being compared.\nAs stated above: in the classic model this graph is typically the complete clique (all pairs of samples are compared). Under constrained models, however, very specific edges (comparisons) are allowed, whereas others are not. For example, if the sample s1subscriptùë†1s_{1} is given to one player, and the sample s2subscriptùë†2s_{2} is given to another player in the simultaneous model, no algorithm can presume to compare the two samples. Equipped with the notion of comparison graphs, one can define a collision-based tester as a couple (G,œÑ)ùê∫ùúè(G,\\tau), where G=(V,E)ùê∫ùëâùê∏G=(V,E) is the comparison graph that defines which comparisons are being made, and œÑùúè\\tau is a threshold parameter. The algorithm is defined as follows: it counts the amount of collisions observed, ZùëçZ, and compares it to a threshold TùëáT that depends on œÑùúè\\tau and the amount of comparisons made (which is |E|ùê∏\\left|E\\right|). In Section¬†4.1, we prove a structural theorem concerning with which sets of comparisons are able to inspire a reliable test for uniformity based solely on counting collisions.\nThis is done by observing the comparison graph Gùê∫G. We formulate sufficient conditions in terms of the graph Gùê∫G, that guarantee it induces a good tester (when paired with the right threshold parameter œÑùúè\\tau).\nIt turns out that two properties of a comparison graph Gùê∫G are key: the first is the number of edges, which represents the amount of comparisons being made; the second one, somewhat surprisingly, is the number of 222-paths in the graph Gùê∫G, which encapsulates the amount of dependencies between different comparisons being made. Few of our testers rely on the same type of graph, that pops up multiple times, for different reasons. To this end, we formulate Lemma¬†3.2, that specifies the required parameters for a comparison graph of this type to induce a good tester.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: property, or it is far from any distribution that does (typically we use ‚Ñì1subscript‚Ñì1\\ell_{1} as a distance measure).\nProperties of distributions were excessively studied through the years (see¬† [ref]12 for excellent surveys).
