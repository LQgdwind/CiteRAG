      "content": "Paper Title: The Power of a Single Qubit: Two-way Quantum Finite Automata and the Word Problem\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe theory of quantum computation has made amazing strides in the last several decades. Landmark results, like Shor’s polynomial time quantum algorithm for integer factorization , Grover’s algorithm for unstructured search , and the linear system solver of Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd , have provided remarkable examples of natural problems for which quantum computers seem to have an advantage over their classical counterparts. These theoretical breakthroughs have provided strong motivation to construct quantum computers. However, while significant advancements have been made, the experimental quantum computers that exist today are still quite limited, and are certainly not capable of implementing, on a large scale, algorithms designed for general quantum Turing machines. This naturally motivates the study of more restricted models of quantum computation. In this paper, our goal is to understand the computational power of a small number of qubits, especially the power of a single qubit. To that end, we study two-way finite automata with quantum and classical states (2QCFA), introduced by Ambainis and Watrous [ref]2. Informally, a 2QCFA is a two-way deterministic finite automaton (2DFA) that has been augmented with a quantum register of constant size, i.e., a constant number of qubits. The quantum part of the machine is extremely limited; however, the model is surprisingly powerful. In particular, Ambainis and Watrous [ref]2 showed that a 2QCFA, using only one qubit, can recognize, with bounded error, the language Le​q={am​bm:m∈ℕ}subscript𝐿𝑒𝑞conditional-setsuperscript𝑎𝑚superscript𝑏𝑚𝑚ℕL_{eq}=\\{a^{m}b^{m}:m\\in\\mathbb{N}\\} in expected polynomial time and the language Lp​a​l={w∈{a,b}∗:w​ is a palindrome}subscript𝐿𝑝𝑎𝑙conditional-set𝑤superscript𝑎𝑏𝑤 is a palindromeL_{pal}=\\{w\\in\\{a,b\\}^{*}:w\\text{ is a palindrome}\\} in expected exponential time. This clearly demonstrated that 2QCFA are more powerful than 2DFA, which recognize precisely the regular languages 3. Moreover, as it is known that two-way probabilistic finite automata (2PFA) can recognize Le​qsubscript𝐿𝑒𝑞L_{eq} with bounded error in exponential time , but not in subexponential time , and cannot recognize Lp​a​lsubscript𝐿𝑝𝑎𝑙L_{pal} with bounded error in any time bound , this result also demonstrated the superiority of 2QCFA over 2PFA. We investigate the ability of 2QCFA to recognize the word problem of a group. Informally, the word problem for a group G𝐺G involves determining if the product of a finite sequence of group elements g1,…,gk∈Gsubscript𝑔1…subscript𝑔𝑘𝐺g_{1},\\ldots,g_{k}\\in G is equal to the identity element of G𝐺G. Word problems for various classes of groups have a rich and well-studied history in computational complexity theory, as there are many striking relationships between certain algebraic properties of a group G𝐺G and the computational complexity of its word problem WGsubscript𝑊𝐺W_{G}. For example, WG∈𝖱𝖤𝖦⇔G⇔subscript𝑊𝐺𝖱𝖤𝖦𝐺W_{G}\\in\\mathsf{REG}\\Leftrightarrow G is finite , WG∈𝖢𝖥𝖫⇔WG∈𝖣𝖢𝖥𝖫⇔G⇔subscript𝑊𝐺𝖢𝖥𝖫subscript𝑊𝐺𝖣𝖢𝖥𝖫⇔𝐺W_{G}\\in\\mathsf{CFL}\\Leftrightarrow W_{G}\\in\\mathsf{DCFL}\\Leftrightarrow G is a finitely generated virtually free group , and WG∈𝖭𝖯⇔G⇔subscript𝑊𝐺𝖭𝖯𝐺W_{G}\\in\\mathsf{NP}\\Leftrightarrow G is a finitely generated subgroup of a finitely presented group with polynomial Dehn function . For a quantum model, such as the 2QCFA, word problems are a particularly natural class of languages to study. There are several results  6 5 which show that certain (generally significantly more powerful) QFA variants can recognize the word problems of particular classes of groups (see the excellent survey  for a full discussion of the many QFA variants). Moreover, there are also results concerning the ability of QFA to recognize certain languages that are extremely closely related to word problems; in fact, the languages Le​qsubscript𝐿𝑒𝑞L_{eq} and Lp​a​lsubscript𝐿𝑝𝑎𝑙L_{pal} considered by Ambainis and Watrous [ref]2 are each closely related to a word problem. Fundamentally, the laws of quantum mechanics sharply constrain the manner in which the state of the quantum register of a 2QCFA may evolve, thereby forcing the computation of a 2QCFA to have a certain algebraic structure. Similarly, the algebraic properties of a particular group G𝐺G impose a corresponding algebraic structure on its word problem WGsubscript𝑊𝐺W_{G}. For certain classes of groups, the algebraic structure of WGsubscript𝑊𝐺W_{G} is extremely compatible with the algebraic structure of the computation of a 2QCFA; for other classes of groups, these two algebraic structures are in extreme opposition. In this paper, we show that there is a broad class of groups for which these algebraic structures are quite compatible, which enables us to produce 2QCFA that recognize these word problems. As a corollary, we show that Le​qsubscript𝐿𝑒𝑞L_{eq} can be recognized by a 2QCFA with better parameters than in the original Ambainis and Watrous result [ref]2. In a separate paper 4, we establish matching lower bounds on the running time of a 2QCFA (and, more generally, a quantum Turing machine that uses sublogarithmic space) that recognizes these word problems, thereby demonstrating the optimality of these results; this allows us to prove that the class of languages recognizable with bounded error by 2QCFA in expected subexponential time is properly contained in the class of languages recognizable with bounded error by 2QCFA in expected exponential time.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: power of a small number of qubits, especially the power of a single qubit.
