      "content": "Paper Title: Certified Adversarial Defenses Meet Out-of-Distribution Corruptions: Benchmarking Robustness and Simple Baselines\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe focus our attention on the SOTA certification technique based on randomized smoothing (RS) which is efficient and scalable.\nLet us consider a base classifier ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} trained on samples 𝒙∈𝒳⊂ℝd×d×3𝒙𝒳superscriptℝ𝑑𝑑3{\\bm{x}}\\in\\mathcal{X}\\subset{\\mathbb{R}}^{d\\times d\\times 3} and their corresponding labels y∈𝒴⊂ℝ+𝑦𝒴superscriptℝy\\in\\mathcal{Y}\\subset{\\mathbb{R}}^{+}, obtained from an underlying data distribution 𝒟𝒟\\mathcal{D}. Certification. The RS-based certification uses a base classifier ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} and provides certified robustness guarantees for its smoothed version defined as ℳ^​(𝒙)=arg​maxc∈𝒴⁡ℙ​(ℳ​(𝒙+𝜹)=c)^ℳ𝒙subscriptargmax𝑐𝒴ℙℳ𝒙𝜹𝑐\\hat{\\mathcal{M}}({\\bm{x}})=\\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{c\\in\\mathcal{Y}}{\\mathbb{P}}(\\mathcal{M}({\\bm{x}}+{\\bm{\\delta}})=c) where 𝜹∼𝒩​(0,σ2​𝐈)similar-to𝜹𝒩0superscript𝜎2𝐈{\\bm{\\delta}}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^{2}\\mathbf{I}).\nIntuitively, ℳ^^ℳ\\hat{\\mathcal{M}} returns the most probable class returned by ℳℳ\\mathcal{M} on Gaussian perturbations of the input 𝒙𝒙{\\bm{x}}.\nThe certification guarantees that the prediction of the smoothed classifier ℳ^^ℳ\\hat{\\mathcal{M}} are consistent in the ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2} radius [ref]8 of\nCR​(ℳ^,σ,𝒙;y)=σ2​(Φ−1​(pA)−Φ−1​(pB))CR^ℳ𝜎𝒙𝑦𝜎2superscriptΦ1subscript𝑝𝐴superscriptΦ1subscript𝑝𝐵\\text{CR}(\\hat{\\mathcal{M}},\\sigma,{\\bm{x}};y)=\\frac{\\sigma}{2}(\\Phi^{-1}(p_{A})-\\Phi^{-1}(p_{B})),\nwhere Φ−1superscriptΦ1\\Phi^{-1} is the inverse CDF of the standard Gaussian distribution, pA=ℙ​(ℳ​(𝒙+𝜹)=cA)subscript𝑝𝐴ℙℳ𝒙𝜹subscript𝑐𝐴p_{A}={\\mathbb{P}}(\\mathcal{M}({\\bm{x}}+{\\bm{\\delta}})=c_{A}) is probability of the top class (cAsubscript𝑐𝐴c_{A}) and pB=maxc≠cA⁡ℙ​(ℳ​(𝒙+𝜹)=cA)subscript𝑝𝐵subscript𝑐subscript𝑐𝐴ℙℳ𝒙𝜹subscript𝑐𝐴p_{B}=\\max_{c\\neq c_{A}}{\\mathbb{P}}(\\mathcal{M}({\\bm{x}}+{\\bm{\\delta}})=c_{A}) is the probability of the runner-up class.\nMonte Carlo-based sampling [ref]17 is utilized to approximate pA¯≤pA¯subscript𝑝𝐴subscript𝑝𝐴\\underline{p_{A}}\\leq p_{A} and pB¯=1−pA¯≥pB¯subscript𝑝𝐵1¯subscript𝑝𝐴subscript𝑝𝐵\\overline{p_{B}}=1-\\underline{p_{A}}\\geq p_{B}. The certified radius can still be computed using the same formula by replacing pAsubscript𝑝𝐴p_{A} and pBsubscript𝑝𝐵p_{B} with pA¯¯subscript𝑝𝐴\\underline{p_{A}} and pB¯¯subscript𝑝𝐵\\overline{p_{B}}. Improved Training. It has been observed empirically [ref]8 that models trained using the standard training procedure do not provide reasonable certified robustness. Therefore, there is an increasing interest in developing improved training techniques to maximize the certified robustness. Several works  have made significant advances on the training techniques and reported impressive gains in terms of certified radius on in-distribution test data.\nSpecifically, new training methods such as Gaussian augmentation [ref]8, SmoothAdv  and MACER [ref]58 have been proposed. Intuitively, Cohen et al. [ref]8 propose to leverage Gaussian augmentation with variance σ2superscript𝜎2\\sigma^{2} to train the base classifier. SmoothAdv  and MACER [ref]58 both use Gaussian augmentation and further improve Cohen et al.’s baseline method by adversarial training and introducing an auxiliary objective to maximize the certified radius, respectively.\nHowever, the effect of OOD data on the robustness guarantees of these models has been unexplored in the literature. Evaluation Metrics. Similar to previous works [ref]58  , we use the average certified radius (ACR) as our metric to evaluate the robustness of the models on in-distribution (or clean) test data. Specifically, ACR:=1|𝒟t​e​s​t|​∑(𝒙,y)∈𝒟t​e​s​tCR​(ℳ^,σ,𝒙;y)×1ℳ^​(𝒙,σ)=yassignACR1subscript𝒟𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡subscript𝒙𝑦subscript𝒟𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡CR^ℳ𝜎𝒙𝑦subscript1^ℳ𝒙𝜎𝑦\\text{ACR}:=\\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{D}_{test}|}\\sum_{({\\bm{x}},y)\\in\\mathcal{D}_{test}}\\text{CR}(\\hat{\\mathcal{M}},\\sigma,{\\bm{x}};y)\\times\\textbf{1}_{\\hat{\\mathcal{M}}({\\bm{x}},\\sigma)=y}, which is also equivalent to the area under the certified radius-accuracy curve.\nWe assign CR​(⋅)=0CR⋅0\\text{CR}(\\cdot)=0 for incorrect prediction of ℳ^^ℳ\\hat{\\mathcal{M}}. For OOD performance, we measure the mean ACR (mACR) as an overall metric, mACR:=1c​∑i=1cACRiassignmACR1𝑐superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑐subscriptACR𝑖\\text{mACR}:=\\frac{1}{c}\\sum_{i=1}^{c}{\\text{ACR}_{i}}, where c𝑐c is the number of corruptions leveraged in a specific test set. For example, c=15𝑐15c=15 and 101010 in CIFAR-10/100-C and -C¯¯C\\overline{\\text{C}} datasets, respectively. We also report the ACR for each corruption type. Unlike previous studies on empirical defenses, we do not use the empirical clean and robust accuracy [ref]8  [ref]58 as a metric in this work since we focus on the certified robustness.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: Gaussian perturbations of the input 𝒙𝒙{\\bm{x}}.\nThe certification guarantees that the prediction of the smoothed classifier ℳ^^ℳ\\hat{\\mathcal{M}} are consistent in the ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2} radius [ref]8\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
