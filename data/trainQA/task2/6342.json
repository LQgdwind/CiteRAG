Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

[ref]35 \nThe PD function of a feature set S𝑆S is defined as The PD function marginalizes the underlying model over all features in S¯¯𝑆\\bar{S}.\nSince ℙℙ\\mathbb{P} is unknown, the PD function can be approximated via Monte-Carlo integration using all observed data points The approximation therefore evaluates the model on the set of all n𝑛n observations, where the values for features in S¯¯𝑆\\bar{S} stem from the original data points and the feature values in S𝑆S are replaced by values in 𝐱Ssuperscript𝐱𝑆\\mathbf{x}^{S}.\nTo visualize the PDP, m𝑚m grid points 𝐱1S,…,𝐱mSsubscriptsuperscript𝐱𝑆1…subscriptsuperscript𝐱𝑆𝑚\\mathbf{x}^{S}_{1},\\dots,\\mathbf{x}^{S}_{m} are used to construct a PD curve using the pairs {𝐱kS,f^SPD​(𝐱kS)}k=1msuperscriptsubscriptsubscriptsuperscript𝐱𝑆𝑘superscriptsubscript^𝑓𝑆PDsuperscriptsubscript𝐱𝑘𝑆𝑘1𝑚\\{\\mathbf{x}^{S}_{k},\\hat{f}_{S}^{\\text{PD}}(\\mathbf{x}_{k}^{S})\\}_{k=1}^{m}.\nGrid points can be created in equidistance on the feature scale or based on the feature distribution [ref]37.\nAs an additional layer of interpretation, the PDP can be enriched with ICE curves .\nICE curves show each observation’s trajectory across the feature space revealing more complicated relationships because of feature interactions or correlations   , i.e. a single term in the sum of (1).\nThe PDP and its ICE curves are illustrated in Fig. 1. Since, values for features in S𝑆S are sampled independently of 𝐱S¯superscript𝐱¯𝑆\\mathbf{x}^{\\bar{S}}, synthetic data points can be created that break the dependence between features in S𝑆S and S¯¯𝑆\\bar{S}.\nHence, the model is evaluated with unrealistic data points, which is also referred to as being off-manifold  or sampled by the marginal expectation .\n\nReference markers found: [16]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]16: Different approaches exist for retrieving the relationship of a feature on the underlying model’s predictions.\nThe Partial Dependence Plot (PD Plot, or PDP) [ref]16 is a well-established method for retrieving the marginal effect of features on a model.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
