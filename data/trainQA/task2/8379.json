However, this approach often struggled to match ANN performance on complex sequential tasks , particularly with event data. A key obstacle in training deep SNNs is the non-differentiable nature of spike activations [ref]11, which prevents the direct application of gradient-based optimization techniques, leading to subpar performance. To overcome this, approximate surrogate gradients [ref]11  have been proposed, that replace non-differentiable spike activations with smooth gradient approximations, enabling the use of BPTT  to train deep SNNs. However, this approach introduces other challenges like vanishing gradients, especially with long sequences and sparse event data [ref]6, and reduce accuracy compared to ANNs (due to approximate gradients). To address these challenges, previous work has investigated two main avenues: adaptive LIF neurons with learnable thresholds and leaks , and traditional skip connections (without delays) in SNNs . While adaptive LIF neurons allow for dynamic adjustment and better capture of spatio-temporal patterns, and skip connections can improve accuracy and efficiency, neither approach fully addresses the challenges of representing and capturing complex temporal patterns. To achieve this, we propose TSkips, incorporating explicit temporal delays into the network architecture with forward and backward skip connections.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: Early methods to train SNNs relied on ANN-to-SNN conversion [ref]6 [ref]37.
