      "content": "Paper Title: Injecting Domain Adaptation with Learning-to-hash for Effective and Efficient Zero-shot Dense Retrieval\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDense retrieval has become a core component within several downstream NLP and web-search tasks such as question-answering [ref]1 , semantic similarity , conversational search , entity retrieval , fact-checking  and passage retrieval   [ref]9  .\nIn dense retrieval, dual-encoder models encode semantically correlated queries and documents and represent them as spatially close embeddings, i.e., dense vector representations.\nDense retrieval can be efficiently conducted via approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search at inference . Dual-encoder models encode and store document embeddings within an index, which starts to become bulky, once the documents start to increase within the corpus.\nIt becomes expensive to serve dense retrievers practically.\nFor example, storing 21M (million) passages within a dense index requires about 65 GB of memory .\nAs nearest-neighbor (exact) search in large vector spaces is rather slow, ANN techniques such as HNSW  are popularly used, which results in even higher memory requirements such as 150 GB .\nAs a result, for searching on a very large corpus, we require a high-memory and expensive machine to host the bulky index, which hinders the practical application of dense retrieval. Aware of the issue, there have been recent efforts to improve the efficiency of dense retrieval models by compressing the vector representation to lower memory, i.e., space requirements.\nTraditionally, out-of-the-box unsupervised strategies such as dimension reduction with principal component analysis (PCA) or product quantization (PQ)  have been popular for retrieval  . More recently, supervised learning-to-hash (LTH) techniques have been introduced such as BPR  and JPQ . LTH techniques map the original dense embeddings into a Hamming space (binary space) and obtain the low-dimensional binary codes. Unfortunately, all existing vector compression methods are proposed under the single-domain retrieval assumption. However, in practice, many retrieval applications span across various domains with diverse distributions; often with scarce training data [ref]19. In our work, we focus on the Pareto frontier between downstream zero-shot retrieval accuracy while maintaining the efficiency of compression methods. We evaluate TAS-B [ref]9, a robust generalizable dense retriever on 18 diverse retrieval datasets on the BEIR benchmark [ref]19.\nWe evaluate out-of-the-box vector compression techniques to efficiently compress the embeddings, with the least drop in zero-shot retrieval effectiveness.\nWe show that prior work on hashing strategies focused on single-domain retrieval fails severely under domain shifts in zero-shot retrieval, and can underperform the zero-shot TAS-B dense retriever on average by up to 14% nDCG@10 on average on BEIR. To resolve this, in our work, we propose an easy yet effective solution of injecting domain adaptation with existing supervised LTH strategies to improve zero-shot generalization without sacrificing efficiency at inference (both memory and retrieval latency).\nWe focus on the unsupervised setting and experiment with two popular synthetic training data generation-based techniques: GenQ [ref]19 and GPL 0.\nFor both techniques, we use MS MARCO 1 as the source and keep the rest of the BEIR datasets as the target, as previously experimented in [ref]19 0 2. Figure 1 summarizes the overall results presented in our work.\nOur injection technique can improve the naive implementations for both the BPR and JPQ variants of TAS-B by 11.5% and 8.2% nDCG@10 on average while maintaining its 32×32\\times memory efficiency and 14×14\\times and 2×2\\times speedup in retrieval latency in comparison to TAS-B dense retriever on BEIR.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Dense retrieval has become a core component within several downstream NLP and web-search tasks such as question-answering [ref]1 , semantic similarity , conversational search , entity retrieval , fact-checking  and passage retrieval   [ref]9  .\nIn dense retrieval, dual-encoder models encode semantically correlated\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
