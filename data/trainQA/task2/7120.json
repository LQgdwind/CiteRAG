      "content": "Paper Title: GD2-NeRF: Generative Detail Compensation via GAN and Diffusion for One-shot Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOut-distribution Baselines. Since the main goal of final fine stage is achieving vivid plausible details with 3D consistency in an inference-time finetuning-free manner via out-distribution priors, we choose recent Zero-123-NVS  as our main competitor, which is a finetuned latent diffusion model with viewpoint condition and can also synthesize novel views without per-scene finetuning using out-distribution priors. In-distribution Baselines. The main in-distribution baseline of our method is PixelNeRF , which is taken as the OG-NeRF part of our GD2-NeRF. Additionally, we report the quantitative results of methods including 3D GAN methods 4 5 6, Geometry-free method 3, Large-model-based Image-to-3D methods 8 7, and previous OG-NeRF methods   . Notably, VisionNeRF [ref]4 and NeRFDiff 0 are not listed here since they require much more computation than PixelNeRF [ref]4 0 (detailed in the appendix), and  0 requires tedious per-scene optimization using the co-trained diffusion model. Qualitative Analysis.\nWe perform qualitative comparisons with previous methods on ShapNet Cars & Chairs in Fig. 6, and DTU dataset in Fig. 7. Obviously, Zero123-NVS shows significant inconsistency between different views together with inaccurate geometries. Also, it is sensitive to the foreground masking process, which is not suitable for relatively complex scenes as in the DTU dataset. In contrast, our method can gradually include the in- and out-distribution details while maintaining good 3D consistency and geometry on both synthetic and real-world complex datasets. Quantitative Analysis.\n(i) Out-distribution 3D-consistency.\nWe compare the 3D-consistency with our main out-distribution competitor, Zero123-NVS, quantitatively in Tab. II using 101010 randomly picked videos from each dataset, where our method outperforms Zero123-NVS in Pixel-MSE score by almost twice. This can be credited to the primary consistency provided by the coarse-stage outputs together with the proposed global consistency approximation in fine-stage Diff3DE.\n\n(ii) In-distribution Image Quality.\nWe report the in-distribution metric comparisons in Tab. III. It is obvious that our in-distribution method OPP shows a good balance between sharpness and fidelity in general, outperforming the baseline methods even though many of them require per-scene optimization/finetuning/auto-regression. It is worth mentioning that though 3DiM 3 achieves the best FID, as a geometry-free method, it mainly focuses on the image quality of every single view while ignoring the 3D consistency.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: we report the quantitative results of methods including 3D GAN methods 4 5 6, Geometry-free method 3, Large-model-based Image-to-3D methods 8 7, and previous OG-NeRF methods   .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
