Fully-supervised classification, e.g., image classification   on ImageNet  and video action classification  [ref]30 on Kinetics , is a common pretraining task when the data categories are available.\nWhen annotation is scarce, self-supervised learning, e.g, MAE 0, VideoMAE  and DINOv2 [ref]37, is an effective way to leverage large-scale unlabeled data. These models can scale up more easily by utilizing the vast amount of images and videos out there without human annotation. If paired language descriptions for the vision data are available, vision-language pretraining can be utilized, e.g., CLIP  and Frozen . All these types of pretrained models can benefit downstream tasks through finetuning.\nIt has been shown that finetuning from large pretrained models achieves significantly improved performance than training from scratch for various downstream tasks     . However, the majority of existing pretrained models are non-reversible, and consume a large amount of GPU memory when used for downstream finetuning. In this paper, we propose a novel family of reversible networks for downstream finetuning, which can directly leverage these pretrained models.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: Large pretrained models 0  [ref]37 [ref]30, due to their large model scales and their large-scale training data, have demonstrated impressive performance in various computer vision tasks.\nDifferent pretraining mechanisms have\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
