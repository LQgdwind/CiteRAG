      "content": "Paper Title: Enhanced Isotropy Maximization Loss: Seamless and High-Performance Out-of-Distribution Detection Simply Replacing the SoftMax Loss\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNeural networks have been used in classification tasks in many real-world applications . In such cases, the system must typically identify whether a given input belongs to any of the classes on which it was trained.  called this capability out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and proposed datasets and metrics to allow standardized performance evaluation and comparison. However, current OOD detection solutions still have limitations (e.g., special requirements and side effects) that prevent more general use of OOD detection capabilities in practical real-world applications [ref]3 (Table I). First, OOD detection solutions commonly present hyperparameters that usually presume access to out-of-distribution samples to be defined [ref]4 3 [ref]5 4 5. A consequence of presuming access to OOD samples to validate hyperparameters and using the same distribution to evaluate OOD detection results is producing overestimated performance estimations 6. To avoid unrealistic access to OOD samples and overestimated performance, [ref]5 proposed validating hyperparameters using adversarial samples. However, this requires the generation of adversarial examples. This procedure also requires determining hyperparameters (e.g., maximum adversarial perturbation) that are typically unknown when dealing with novel datasets. Similar arguments hold for solutions based on adversarial training  7 8 9 4, which also result in higher training time. Approaches based on the generation of adversarial examples or adversarial training may also have limited scalability when dealing with large images (e.g., ImageNet 0). Many solutions make use of the so-called input preprocessing technique introduced in ODIN [ref]4. However, the use of the mentioned technique increases at least four times the inference delay and power consumption [ref]3 2 because a combination of a first forward pass, backpropagation operation, and second forward pass is required [ref]4 [ref]5  5 for a single useful inference. Actually, approaches that may be applied directly to pretrained models and completely avoid training or fine-tuning the model [ref]4 [ref]5  typically produce inefficient inferences and/or additional computational complexity to perform OOD detection [12, Section IV, D]. From a practical perspective, this is a drawback because inferences may be performed thousands or millions of times in the field. Thus, such approaches may be prohibitive (not sustainable) from environmental 1 and real-world cost-based perspectives. Another harmful and common side effect is the so-called classification accuracy drop 0 . In such cases, higher OOD detection performance is achieved at the expense of a drop in the classification accuracy compared with models trained using the usual SoftMax loss (i.e., the combination of the output linear layer, the SoftMax activation, and the cross-entropy loss 2)111In this paper, we consider that an approach does not present classification accuracy drop if it never presents a classification accuracy more than one percent lower than the correspondent softmax-loss-trained model.. For example, in some situations, the solution proposed in 0 produces a classification accuracy drop of more than two percent when compared with SoftMax loss training of the same neural network. From a practical perspective, this situation is not desirable because the detection of out-of-distribution samples may be a rare event, and classification is usually the primary aim of the designed system 3. The proposal also requires changing the training of the last layer by removing its weight decay to work properly. Therefore, this solution does not work as a SoftMax loss drop-in replacement. Generalized ODIN  uses the in-distribution validation set to avoid the need to access OOD samples to determine the hyperparameters required by the solution. However, considering that CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 do not have separate sets for validation and testing, the results presented in the paper may be overestimated because the validation sets used to define the hyperparameters were reused for OOD detection performance estimation. A more realistic OOD detection performance estimation could have been achieved by removing the in-distribution validation set from in-distribution training data, which would probably produce an even higher classification accuracy drop. For example, Generalized ODIN produces a nearly 3% classification accuracy drop for ResNet34 trained on CIFAR100. Retraining the neural network using a very unusual fine-tuned regularization (dropout with p=0.7𝑝0.7p\\!\\!=\\!\\!0.7), as suggested by the authors, does not actually solve the problem because a classification accuracy drop of approximately 1% persists and the OOD detection performance plunges approximately 10%. The Generalized ODIN changes the architecture by adding a fully connected layer to the end of the network. We believe that this fact may explain the mentioned overfitting. We imagine that this problem may be even worse in datasets with fewer training examples. Additionally, the solution proposed in  is expensive and not environmentally friendly because it uses input preprocessing and thus produces slow and energy-inefficient inferences [ref]3 2. Recently, many OOD detection approaches have used additional/outlier/background data  1 4. In addition to requiring collecting additional data, these approaches require double the GPU memory size for training. The Gram matrices solution performs calculations on values produced by the model during inference  to perform OOD detection. This inference is efficient; however, the OOD detection has a high computational cost. In some cases, an ensemble of classifiers is used 5. For deep ensembles, 7 proposed an ensemble of same-architecture models trained with different random initial weights. Some proposals required structural changes in the model to perform OOD detection 6, and certain trials used uncertainty or confidence estimation/calibration techniques 7 8 9  . However, Bayesian neural networks that are used in most of these are typically more difficult to implement and require much more computational resources. Computational constraints also typically require approximations that compromise the performance, which is also affected by the prior distribution used 7. For example, MC-dropout uses pretrained models with dropout activated during the test time. An average of many inferences is used to perform a single decision . The entropic out-of-distribution detection approach, which is composed of the IsoMax loss for training and the entropic score for OOD detection, avoids all mentioned special requirements and side effects [ref]3 2. Indeed, no hyperparameter tuning is required because the entropic scale is a global constant kept equal to ten for all combinations of datasets and models. Even if we call the entropic scale hyperparameter, the IsoMax loss does not involve hyperparameter tuning because the same constant value of entropic scale is used in all cases. This result is possible because Macêdo et al. showed in [3, Fig. 3] and in [12, Section IV, A] that the OOD detection performance exhibits a well-behaved dependence on the entropic scale regardless of the dataset and model. No additional/outlier/background data are necessary. Models trained using IsoMax loss produce inferences as fast and energy-efficient as the inferences produced by softmax-loss-trained networks. OOD detection requires only a speedy entropy calculation. Finally, no classification accuracy drop is observed. For real-world large-scale applications, we require efficient inference and high-performance solutions. By efficient inference, we mean solutions that do not increase the inference delay, computation, and energy consumption when compared with current softmax-loss-trained neural networks. By high performance, we mean solutions that do not present a classification accuracy drop and simultaneously exhibit much higher out-of-distribution detection when compared with usual SoftMax loss trained neural networks. In this paper, we are only interested in studying and comparing inference-efficient high-performance out-of-distribution detection solutions. Starting from the IsoMax loss, we added the following contributions. First, we normalize both the prototypes and the features. Second, we change the initialization of the prototypes. Third, we add the distance scale, which is a learnable scalar parameter that multiplies the feature-prototype distances. We call the combination of these three modifications the isometrization of the feature-prototype distances. We call the proposed modified version of IsoMax the enhanced isotropy maximization loss or the enhanced IsoMax loss (IsoMax+ loss). Fourth, we use the minimum feature-prototype distance as a score to perform OOD detection. Considering that the minimum feature-prototype distance is calculated to perform the classification, the OOD detection task presents essentially zero computational cost because we simply reuse this value as a score to perform OOD detection. Fifth, in addition to experimental evidence, we provide insights into why a combination of training using IsoMax+ and performing OOD detection using the minimum distance score produces a substantial performance increase in OOD detection. Our approach keeps the solution seamless (i.e., avoids the previously mentioned special requirements and side effects) while significantly increasing the OOD detection performance. Similar to IsoMax loss, IsoMax+ works as a SoftMax loss drop-in replacement because no procedures other than regular neural network training are required.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: current OOD detection solutions still have limitations (e.g., special requirements and side effects) that prevent more general use of OOD detection capabilities in practical real-world applications [ref]3 (Table I).
