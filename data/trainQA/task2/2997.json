      "content": "Paper Title: Abstract\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTraditional Reinforcement Learning (RL)  is often centred around agents moving towards a specific goal. The problem of designing agents that can address multiple concurrent objectives at the same time has recently become of pivotal importance in RL  . While start and goal states are part of the same world, the resulting\npolicies are often merely collected in the form of a ‚Äúcatalogue‚Äù for\nthe different start/goal combinations. Here we wish to start from a\nfundamentally geometric position: we posit that in a world where the\nagent incurs movement costs for each action (negative rewards only),\nand trajectories implement directed shortest routes between a start\nand a goal point, these become a part of a geometry. Such a structure puts these different trajectories and the policies used to achieve them in relation with each other and allows us to systematically draw conclusions about their commonalities, what the space between these tasks looks like and how to switch between tasks or trajectories, and, finally, how to generalise solutions. The best-known form of such a structure is Euclidean geometry. Classical Euclidean geometry is often considered as a ‚Äústatic‚Äù\nconcept. However, one can alternatively interpret it as the\nentirety of locations of a set under consideration, together with the\nstraight lines defining the shortest routes of travel between these\npoints, and the associated directions determined by such straight\nlines. In the field of cognitive science, this Euclidean notion of lines connecting bounding points has been used in the theory of Conceptual Spaces  to geometrically represent knowledge. It introduces a conceptual space which uses geometric and topological ideas to represent quality dimensions which enable one to compare concepts such as weight, colour, taste, etc. Natural categories are convex regions in conceptual spaces, in that if xùë•x and yùë¶y are elements of a category, and if zùëßz is between xùë•x and yùë¶y, then z is also likely to belong to the category. This convexity allows the interpretation of the focal points of regions as category prototypes. Analogous to straight lines in Euclidean space, the distance in between concepts is defined in terms of these prototypes through conceptual similarity  which expresses their similarity as a linear combination of their common and distinctive features. In contrast to such a concept of ‚Äúin-betweenness‚Äù, in traditional\ngeometry, one has furthermore the alternative option of navigating by\nchoosing an initial direction for a route which then is subsequently\nmaintained in a consistent fashion. Using a compass an agent can\nmaintain a bearing, say, a strict northern course, by selecting the\ndesired direction and then strictly keeping its current orientation.\nThis can be used to reach a goal, or even multiple goals, optimally\nwhenever this fixed direction happens to coincide with one or more\ndesired shortest routes. This concept generalises into Riemannian\ngeometry by replacing the straight lines with geodesics which\nrepresent a kind of consistent directionality on a manifold. This\nassumes that direction-constant and shortest routes coincide,\notherwise they need to be treated separately. While Riemannian geometry still respects the symmetry of distance\nbetween locations, one can generalise this to direction-dependent\nroutes in terms of a Finsler geometry , where such\ndistances are no longer symmetric between two given points; this\nmodels, for instance, non-reversible energy expenditure, altitude\ntraversal, or accounting for the ease of terrain. This can be\nelegantly expressed as RL problems which carry only positive cost (or\nnegative reward, our convention throughout the paper). In this context\nthe RL policy is a decision or behaviour strategy employed by an agent\nto solve a task. In this paper, we will consider, amongst other, the\nlimit case of an open-loop policy with optimal costs; we will argue\nthat this can be interpreted as a generalisation of selecting and\nfollowing a cardinal direction by a compass while keeping\nthe orientation fixed, which is a state-independent behaviour. More precisely, once an open-loop policy, i.e.¬†a bearing has been determined, using the same action or action\ndistribution selected in every state, the agent will proceed without\nfurther deliberation or intake of information about the current state,\ni.e.¬†in an open-loop manner. We interpret this as corresponding to\nstrictly following the set direction, without adjustment. When considering behaviour, it is traditionally hypothesised that\nbehavioural preferences of rational agents can be characterised by a\nsuitably chosen utility function UùëàU that assigns a numerical value to\nthe possible behaviour outcomes, and the agents act as to maximise the\nexpected value of this utility\n. System deviations from\nrational behaviour are known as cognitive biases which result from the\nuse of fast but fallible cognitive strategies known as heuristics\n. Agents have finite\ncognitive resources. Thus, it is unrealistic to assume that agents would have a unique heuristic for every particular situation. Resource-rationality aims to provide a framework to account for heuristics and biases, such that expected utility maximisation is subject to both computational costs and cognitive limitations. In this context, acting optimally is defined as the decision strategy, or policy œÄùúã\\pi, which maximises the difference between the expected utility and the cost of the policy  according to œÄ‚àó=arg‚Å°maxœÄ‚Å°(ùîºœÄ[U]‚àíCost‚Å°(œÄ))superscriptùúãsubscriptùúãsubscriptùîºùúãùëàCostùúã\\pi^{*}={\\arg\\max}_{\\pi}\\left(\\operatorname*{\\mathbb{E}}_{\\pi}[U]-\\operatorname{Cost}(\\pi)\\right). These costs include the cost of computation  and the cost of control . The cost for the cognitive processing required to operate a given policy has also been measured in terms of information-theoretic functionals   [ref]30 . In the present paper, we are interested in the geometries emerging\nfrom the incorporation of such informational cognitive costs\n. In two-dimensional continuous Euclidean spaces, the\noptimal routes consist of straight lines which also form shortest\npaths between two points. On a sphere, optimal routes lie on grand\ncircles connecting two points; furthermore, souch routes can be\nnaturally extended beyond their boundary points, on the sphere, to\nfull grand circles. The latter form geodesics which no longer\nnecessarily constitute overall shortest routes, however, they are still direction-preserving curves, the generalisation of the Euclidean straight line .\nWe will generally consider geometry in\nterms of locations (points) and optimal routes from a start location\nto another. Such routes are characterised by a distance (in\nour RL-based convention, negative cumulated rewards) and a\ndirection. Rethinking RL in terms of geodesics means, in some cases,\nsplitting the resulting trajectory at a subgoal s‚Ä≤superscriptùë†‚Ä≤s^{\\prime}, such that the agent can\nvisit s‚Ä≤superscriptùë†‚Ä≤s^{\\prime} en route to the final goal gùëîg without any extra\ninformational costs. Furthermore, instead of a\ncost-optimal route between two states sùë†s and gùëîg, one can instead consider\nthe starting state sùë†s and a generalised ‚Äúdirection‚Äù towards gùëîg,\nwhich in our case is reinterpreted as an open-loop policy. Incorporating cognitive cost we can additionally ask how such a\ngeometry would ideally be organised and represented in an\ninformationally limited agent. We note that this perspective, while\ncarrying some similarity to the questions of transfer learning\n, is still markedly distinct. No symmetry or\nequivariance is implied, only operational and cognitive distances\n(costs) and their associated policies ‚Äî in particular, there is no\nreason to assume that one type of strategy carries over to another\nregion. Of course, if there is some spatial coherence across regions,\none can expect some relevant overlap of trajectory structures between them. We can consider our agent starting at a given point and\nproceeding unchanged to ‚Äúmove in one direction‚Äù, with a fixed given\nbehaviour or else, with a strategy optimal for a particular problem of\ntraveling from a state sùë†s to gùëîg. Similarly to the pure cost problem,\nwe ask which goals in addition to the original one will be optimally\nreached following this fixed behaviour or a least-cost route. Such\ngeneralised geometries with their directional or minimal cost routes\nlead us to envisage connections in the space that enable agents to\nadapt policies to goals beyond our current goal. Whenever the\ninfodesic contains more than just the original start and end state,\nthis means that multiple goals can be reached without redirection or\nextra costs (or with costs that do not exceed a given relaxation\nthreshold). In the case where we consider minimal cost routes and\ncognitive costs incorporating the cost of processing information, we will\nalso speak of infodesics. In these, constraining information\nprocessing can thus trade in nominally shorter but more complicated\nroutes against longer, but simpler and safer ones\n [ref]30, which effectively imposes a distortion\non the geometry of a task space. To investigate this further, we define Decision Information to quantify the amount of information processed by an agent to execute a policy to navigate from a starting location to the goal state. Here, we use an information-theoretic free energy principle     [ref]30, which induces a notion of informational distance and endows the decision-making problem with a qualitative geometrical interpretation. We now introduce our formalism. After describing the simulations implemented, we present and discuss the results with suggestions for future avenues of research.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: the cost of computation  and the cost of control .
