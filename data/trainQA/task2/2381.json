      "content": "Paper Title: A Convolutional Neural Network Approach to the Classification of Engineering Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nClassification of Engineering (CAD) models is very important for a task such as design reuse. It has been observed that designers spend a considerable amount of time in search for the right information as well as use a large percentage of existing design for a new product development . Gunn  has observed that about 40% of the new designs could be built from an existing design and 40% from modifying an existing design. Ullman  has indicated that a large percentage (75% or sometimes, more than that) of design reuses existing knowledge for the new product development. Classification is also an important task for retrieval of CAD models, which in turn employed in design reuse . Another area of interest is in the CAD assembly model retrieval , where, apart from using topology and connection informations, classification plays a key role. The interdependence between product life cycle management (PLM), material requirements planning (MRP) and CAD systems also calls for classification and search of 3D Engineering models . Considering the applications and the fact that we are in the digital age with many information archived digitally, the problem of automatic classification of CAD models becomes a predominant one. An Engineering/CAD model (see Fig. 1(a)) has features such as holes (genus >> 0), blind holes (genus == 0) and fillets which are usually absent in a graphical model (see Fig. 1(b)). Also, sharp edges are usually found in a CAD Model as opposed to a graphical model which more or less has smooth curvature throughout. Traditionally, in the field of Engineering models, boundary representation (B-Rep) is the native format to store the data. To protect the proprietary design during data transfer, other formats such as mesh / tessellated representations are used. Also, with newer technologies such as additive manufacturing / 3D printing, mesh model representation in the field of Engineering / CAD is gaining popularity. A mesh for a CAD model (see Fig. 1(a)) is substantially different from that of a graphical model (see Fig. 1(b)) in the following ways : CAD Model tessellations are typically sparse while that of graphical models are usually dense. CAD Models have a lesser number of triangles in general as compared to a graphical model. In general, the problem of classification of shapes/models has been an active area of research in several fields viz. images, graphical models, CAD models etc. for more than two decades. The problem gained prominence with the start of digital archiving. For image data, MPEG dataset  was perhaps one of the first ones in the domain of computer vision. In the area of graphical models, Princeton shape benchmark (PSB) was one of the earlier ones . Jayanti et al. introduced Engineering shape benchmark (ESB) for CAD models . The National Design Repository (NDR) [ref]9 also contains a few hundred CAD models. The advent of machine learning techniques and in particular, the advances made in deep learning, accelerated the research on the problem of classification. However, deep learning techniques call for a large number of labelled data with appropriate class information. Hence, labelled datasets for images with class information have grown much larger 0, and so for graphical 3D models 1. In recent times, datasets for Engineering/CAD models have also grown through acquiring from different resources 2. Though the dataset 2 contains a large number of models, the aim seems to be more on populating the data rather than providing classification. In the field of Engineering, it is imperative to classify data functionally. For example, a pipe and a bolt may look like a cylinder but have different functionality. This classification task also requires the people involved to have rich domain knowledge and experience. As CAD models are a derivate of the Engineering design process, many of the design data are also proprietary in nature and hence may not be put in the public domain 3. Also, there exists only very few works on CAD model classification using deep learning. Qin et al. 3 use only deep networks (not CNN) and the work presented in 2 uses basic geometric properties such as normals and curvatures but does not take functional classification into account. Our motivation for addressing the problem of classification of Engineering / CAD models comes from the following: Most of the CAD datasets (such as  or [ref]9) have only a few hundred models. Datasets having larger number of CAD models are either proprietary (not publicly available) 3 or lack classification information 2. The recent advances in deep learning such as CNN have not been made use of, to the best of our knowledge. In this work, in order to classify the CAD data functionally, we start by using the publicly available datasets of CAD Models, ESB and NDR, which also have well-annotated functional classification. Unfortunately, they have only very few models, in the order of hundreds. We then resort to creating CAD models and functionally classify them by adding to the appropriate class. A dataset termed ‘CADNET’ has been then prepared. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach (only deep network was used in 3) for the classification of CAD models is then proposed. It is also crucial to come up with a network architecture for the intended application. The key contributions of the paper are as follows: A dataset named ‘CADNET’, which is suitable for deep learning-based approaches. A CNN-based deep learning approach for the classification of CAD models using a residual network structure, inspired by ResNet 4, with much lesser number of filters and thereby much reduction in the number of parameters. Used the idea of class-weights, in order to alleviate the problem of imbalanced classes in CADNET. Proposed the use of gradient-based boosting approaches to improve the efficiency of classification. The proposed network produces better classification accuracy with much lesser training time. The manuscipt is organised as follows: Section 2 discusses the literature corresponding to 3D CAD models, in addtion to the literature on Images, 3D Graphical Models, and an overview of the existing datasets for CAD model classification. The typical pipeline to be employed for a deep learning based classification task is described in Section 3, and each step of the pipeline is elaborated in Sections 4 to 6. Section 7 provides the Implementation Details. The results, limitaitons and possible future work are elaborated in Section 8, followed by a Conclusion (Section 9).\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: of graphical models, Princeton shape benchmark (PSB) was one of the earlier ones .
