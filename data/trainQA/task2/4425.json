      "content": "Paper Title: The discriminating power of the generalized rank invariant\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor any ‚Ñê‚äÇInt‚Äã(P)‚ÑêIntP\\mathcal{I}\\subset\\mathrm{Int}(\\mathrm{P}), we say a PP\\mathrm{P}-module MùëÄM is ‚Ñê‚Ñê\\mathcal{I}-decomposable, if MùëÄM can be written as a direct sum of interval modules (cf. Section 2.1), where all intervals are from ‚Ñê‚Ñê\\mathcal{I}. We investigate the discriminating power of GRI by exploiting its M√∂bius inversion (a.k.a. generalized persistence diagram). Also, we simplify proofs in the literature by harnessing the M√∂bius inversion formula even when the setting is not locally finite. Without the assumption that ‚Ñê‚äÇInt‚Äã(P)‚ÑêIntP\\mathcal{I}\\subset\\mathrm{Int}(\\mathrm{P}) is locally finite, we use the M√∂bius inversion formula to prove that the GRI over ‚Ñê‚Ñê\\mathcal{I} is a complete invariant for ‚Ñê‚Ñê\\mathcal{I}-decomposable PP\\mathrm{P}-modules: see Theorem 4.1 (note: the statement itself was known; see Remark 4.3). We show that the aforementioned completeness theorem is, in a sense, ‚Äòtight‚Äô: see Theorem 4.4 and Corollary 4.5. We go one step further and describe the equivalence classes of PP\\mathrm{P}-modules that have the same GRI over any ‚Ñê‚äÇInt‚Äã(P)‚ÑêIntP\\mathcal{I}\\subset\\mathrm{Int}(\\mathrm{P}) in terms of the GPDs. Interestingly, we show this via exploiting the M√∂bius inversion of functions that are not the GRIs: see Theorem 4.6 and Corollary 4.7. We contextualize several theorems and observations regarding the RI or GRI from the literature within the framework of the M√∂bius inversion formula. We introduce the notion of M√∂bius invertible GRI for PP\\mathrm{P}-modules that does not require Int‚Äã(P)IntP\\mathrm{Int}(\\mathrm{P}) to be locally finite in order for the GPD of MùëÄM to be well-defined.\nInterestingly, the M√∂bius invertible GRIs are exactly the GRIs that admit rank decompositions. This implies that if a GRI admits a rank decomposition, its minimal decomposition is obtained from M√∂bius inversion:\nsee Definition 3.1 and Theorem 3.4. We establish a few sufficient conditions that guarantee the M√∂bius invertiblity of the GRI. Examples include finitely presentable PP\\mathrm{P}-modules for an arbitrary join-semilattice PP\\mathrm{P}: see Theorem 3.5 and Remark 3.6. A rank decomposability theorem [10, Theorem 2.5] by Botnan, Oppermann and Oudot is proved using\nthe reverse operation of the M√∂bius inversion: see Remark 3.8. Results about the ZIB and GRI of ‚Ñ§2superscript‚Ñ§2\\mathbb{Z}^{2}-modules follow. Let int‚Äã(‚Ñ§2)intsuperscript‚Ñ§2\\mathrm{int}(\\mathbb{Z}^{2}) be the collection of all finite intervals of ‚Ñ§2superscript‚Ñ§2\\mathbb{Z}^{2}. We show that the ZIB over simple paths and the GRI over int‚Äã(‚Ñ§2)intsuperscript‚Ñ§2\\mathrm{int}(\\mathbb{Z}^{2}) do not determine each other. As a corollary to this result and [24, Theorem 24], it follows that the ZIB over all paths is a strictly finer invariant than both the ZIB over simple paths and the GRI over int‚Äã(‚Ñ§2)intsuperscript‚Ñ§2\\mathrm{int}(\\mathbb{Z}^{2}): see Examples 6.3, 6.4 and Figure 2. Using M√∂bius inversion, we show the ZIB over simple paths and the GRI over int‚Äã(‚Ñ§2)intsuperscript‚Ñ§2\\mathrm{int}(\\mathbb{Z}^{2})\napproximate each other: see Remark 6.6 and Proposition 6.8. We establish a stability theorem for GRIs and their restrictions\n‚Äì a property that was not addressed in 9: see Theorem 5.4.\nA reinterpretation of this theorem implies stability of ZIBs:\nsee Theorem 6.9. Patel noted that the persistent diagram in the one-parameter setting can be defined as the M√∂bius inversion of the RI and thereby introduced the generalized persistence diagram  of an ‚Ñù‚Ñù\\mathbb{R}-indexed functor whose target can be different from vector spaces. Patel‚Äôs work became a motivation for the work by Kim and M√©moli 9 and the work by McCleary and Patel  .\nIn particular, in 9, the generalized persistence diagram of a PP\\mathrm{P}-module is defined as the M√∂bius inversion of the GRI over Con‚Äã(P)ConP\\mathrm{Con}(\\mathrm{P}), which can be viewed as a multiset of signed elements of Con‚Äã(P)ConP\\mathrm{Con}(\\mathrm{P}) (assuming that Con‚Äã(P)ConP\\mathrm{Con}(\\mathrm{P}) is locally finite). Asashiba et al. also use M√∂bius inversion to devise methods to approximate a persistence module MùëÄM over a finite 2d-grid by an interval-decomposable module . One of their approximation methods yields an invariant that possesses the same amount of information as\n(the M√∂bius inversion of) the GRI of MùëÄM over the intervals in the grid [31, Remark 2.19]. These two equivalent invariants naturally encode the bigraded Betti numbers of MùëÄM . Recently, ideas from relative homological algebra have been employed to study the RI and GRI  [ref]6 [ref]10 . M√∂bius inversion has been utilized alongside other invariants of persistence modules, including the birth-death function and the meta-rank  7 . In Section 2 we review the concepts of persistence modules, their decompositions, the M√∂bius inversion formula, the GRI, the GPD, and rank decompositions. In Section 3, we establish results outlined in Contribution 2 above. In Section 4, we establish results outlined in Contribution 1. In Sections 5-6, we establish results outlined in Contribution 3. In Section 7, we discuss open questions.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: [31, Remark 2.19].
