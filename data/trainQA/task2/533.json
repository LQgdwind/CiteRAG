      "content": "Paper Title: A Symbolic Temporal Pooling method for Video-based Person Re-Identification\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we briefly review the most relevant research in terms of video-based re-identification methods and symbolic representation techniques. Video Re-ID: The current person re-id works can be broadly classified into two groups: image-based 0   and video-based  9 . According to our purposes, in this work we pay special attention to video based re-id techniques. Temporal Aggregation: Temporal aggregation methods either adopt Temporal Pooling   or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)   [ref]39 to learn temporal cues across the different frames. Suh et al. developed a part-aligned bi-linear representation model, composed of a two-stream network and a bi-linear pooling layer. Among the two-stream network, one stream extracts the appearance map and another one focuses in the body-part map. Liu et al. proposed a spatial temporal Mutual promotion Model, that starts by using a Refining Recurrent Unit (RRU) to recover the missing parts (ocludded) in a frame. Further, a Spatial-Temporal Clues Integration Module (STIM) is introduced to integrate spatial and temporal information. Optical Flow: In optical flow-based methods, temporal cues are extracted using the classical optical flow technique or its minor variations, which are then fused to spatial information. McLaughlin et al. developed an optical flow and RNN-based model to capture short- and long-term temporal information. Feichtenhofer et al. proposed a two-stream architecture that combines spatial and motion pathways by motion gating.\nChung et al. proposed a two stream convolutional neural network architecture, where each stream is a Siamese Network used to learn spatial and temporal information separately. Wu et al. proposed a spatio-temporal association representation model that fuses appearance and short-term motion at the local level, and spatial and temporal features at the global level. 3D CNN: These methods use 3D convolutional kernels in the spatial and temporal dimensions . Gao and Nevatia  proposed a 3D CNN architecture to extract video level features, while Li et al. using the Multi-Scale 3D (M3D) convolution layer to learn temporal cues. Despite showing promising results, this kind of 3D models are computationally expensive and vulnerable to spatial misalignment. Various efforts were made to develop temporal attention based solutions. Li et al. developed a spatio-temporal attention model in which the discriminative regions are inferred using a multiple spatial attention scheme. Liu et al.9 proposed a non-local video attention network (NVAN) that exploits both spatial and temporal features by using non-local attention layers. Gu et al. proposed a temporal knowledge propagation (TKP) method, where the image representations learn frame features to match the video representation network output in a shared feature space. Zhang et al.0 proposed a Multi-Granularity Reference aided Attentive Feature Aggregation (MG-RAFA) model, that starts by determining the importance of each feature. Next, the affinity of each feature with respect to all reference elements is obtained and used as weight for aggregation. Symbolic Data Analysis: In recent years, the concept of symbolic data analysis (SDA) has been receiving growing attention. Symbolic data representations can be seen as an extension to the traditional data types, that include interval, distribution, periodic or histogram-based features. Applications based in symbolic representations have been extensively reported (e.g.,      ). In all these works, the basic premise is that the variations among the data that compose a sequence cannot be captured by a crisp data type and that symbolic representations can do that in a much more effective way 7  2 .\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: in this work we pay special attention to video based re-id techniques.
