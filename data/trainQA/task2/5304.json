Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: HIER: Metric Learning Beyond Class Labels via Hierarchical Regularization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets.\nOn four benchmark datasets, namely CUB-200-2011 (CUB)¬†, Cars-196 (Cars)¬†, Stanford Online Product (SOP)¬†, and In-shop Clothes Retrieval (In-Shop)¬†[ref]21, models are evaluated and compared.\nWe split the datasets into train and test sets, directly following the standard protocol presented in [ref]17. Evaluation metric.\nWe measure the performance on the datasets by Recall@kùëòk, the fraction of queries that have at least one relevant sample in their kùëòk-nearest neighbors on a learned hyperbolic embedding space. Embedding network architectures.\nFor fair comparisons with previous work, we utilize ResNet50¬† and vision transformer architecture with three types of pretraining scheme (ViT-S¬†, DeiT-S¬† and DINO¬†[ref]3). All encoder is pretrained for ImageNet classification¬†. In ViT variants, the linear projection layer for patch embedding is frozen during training. We adjust the size of the last FC layer according to the dimensionality of embedding vectors. We note that L2subscriptùêø2L_{2} normalization is not used for hyperbolic embedding. Instead, the exponential mapping layer¬†(See Eq.¬†(1)) is appended to the last embedding layer. Implementation details.\nOur embedding models are optimized by AdamW¬† with the learning rate value 10‚àí5superscript10510^{-5} for ViT-S and DeiT-S, and 5√ó10‚àí65superscript1065\\times 10^{-6} for DINO models. For experiments using ResNet50, we follow the training setting of [ref]17.\nTraining images are randomly resized and cropped to 224√ó224224224224\\times 224 and randomly flipped horizontally while test images are resized to 256√ó256256256256\\times 256 and then center cropped.\nFor hyperbolic embedding, we use curvature parameter c=0.1ùëê0.1c=0.1 and clipping radius r=2.3ùëü2.3r=2.3 following previous work¬†.\nIn proxy anchor loss, we use a high learning rate for proxies by scaling 1√ó1041superscript1041\\times 10^{4} times.\nFor all of our experiments, we maintain a consistent set of hyperparameters, including K=20ùêæ20K=20 for the number of nearest neighbors, |P|=512ùëÉ512|P|=512 for the number of hierarchical proxies, Œª=1ùúÜ1\\lambda=1 for the loss weight of HIER, and Œ¥=0.1ùõø0.1\\delta=0.1 for the margin.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: Datasets.\nOn four benchmark datasets, namely CUB-200-2011 (CUB)¬†, Cars-196 (Cars)¬†, Stanford Online Product (SOP)¬†, and In-shop Clothes Retrieval (In-Shop)¬†[ref]21, models are evaluated and compared.\nWe split the datasets into train and test sets, directly following the standard protocol presented in [ref]17.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
