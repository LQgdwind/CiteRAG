      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Learning Meets Mechanism Design: Key Results and Some Novel Applications\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThere are some scenarios wherein the auctioneer may be interested in the fair allocation of resources to buyers, for example, the allocation of natural resources such as spectrum allocation and the online advertisement of career opportunities to all the users irrespective of gender. In [ref]37, the authors study revenue maximizing auctions that have strategy proof and fairness constraints for online advertisement auction scenarios. This paper extends the work of RegretNet studied in 1. First, let us define one of the fairness metrics known as total variation of fairness [ref]42. Let U be the set of users who arrive randomly to visit the website and let A be the set of advertisers. Let us consider pi,usubscript𝑝𝑖𝑢p_{i,u} to be the probability of allocation of advertiser i𝑖i to user u𝑢u and let us divide set A into c𝑐c classes as C={C1,…,Cc}𝐶subscript𝐶1…subscript𝐶𝑐C=\\{C_{1},\\dots,C_{c}\\}. For any class m𝑚m, 1≤m≤c1𝑚𝑐1\\leq m\\leq c, consider the user-pair distance metric dm:U×U→ :superscript𝑑𝑚→𝑈𝑈01d^{m}:U\\times U\\rightarrow  . Then the total variation fairness is an extension of an individual fairness where similar users are treated similarly and is defined as follows. An auction mechanism satisfies total variation fairness, if the L1subscript𝐿1L_{1} distance between two user allocations is less than the L1 distance between the two users. That is From Definition 9, we define the unfairness metric which is used as a loss function for the NN. It is defined as the amount of violation of total variation fairness by an auction mechanism for each user u∈U𝑢𝑈u\\in U and is given as The loss function is defined as The fairness constraint is ensured by adding the loss function Lu​n​fsubscript𝐿𝑢𝑛𝑓L_{unf} with the loss function defined in Eqn. 39 for the RegretNet model (Fig. 4) 1 using the augmented Lagrangian approach. In many real world applications we consider the fair allocation of resources, for example, in course assignments, ad-auctions, inventory pricing, etc. In , the authors consider the auctioning of indivisible goods to multiple strategic buyers in a single-parameter environment and study Envy freeness up to one good (EF1), maximin share guarantee (MMS) and Nash social welfare (NSW) fairness conditions. Let there be n𝑛n buyers and a single seller having m𝑚m goods to sell. Let vi∈R+subscript𝑣𝑖subscript𝑅v_{i}\\in R_{+} be the valuation for buyer i𝑖i (private value) and let the known public value summarization function among all buyers be W:2[m]→R+:𝑊→superscript2delimited-[]𝑚subscript𝑅W:2^{[m]}\\rightarrow R_{+}. For a given subset S⊆[m]𝑆delimited-[]𝑚S\\subseteq[m], the valuation of the it​hsuperscript𝑖𝑡ℎi^{th} buyer is vi​(S)=vi​W​(S)subscript𝑣𝑖𝑆subscript𝑣𝑖𝑊𝑆v_{i}(S)=v_{i}W(S). Then, the fairness conditions are defined below. Under this comparative notion of fairness, an allocation is said to be FA-EF1 iff, every buyer i𝑖i values a set of goods Sisubscript𝑆𝑖S_{i} as much as any other buyer j𝑗j values a set of goods Sjsubscript𝑆𝑗S_{j}, up to the removal of the most valuable good from the other buyer set and for some g∈Sj𝑔subscript𝑆𝑗g\\in S_{j}. It is mathematically given as such that Further, the allocation is both EF1 and Pareto efficient for additive valuations. Under this fairness notion, an allocation is said to be FA-MMS, iff every buyer gets a bundel of value ≥ϵabsentitalic-ϵ\\geq\\epsilon, where ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon is an agent specific fairness threshold. Mathematically, it is given as such that It is defined as the geometric mean of the buyers valuations for their bundles. Mathematically, it is given as and it quantifies the amount of fairness in an allocation. An allocation that maximizes NSW is both fair and Pareto efficient in the case of allocation of indivisible goods. Motivated by the fairness metrics of , the authors of  propose a NN model for an auction that has a fair allocation in addition to being IC and IR while maximizing social welfare. The proposed model is described below. Let there be n𝑛n buyers with N={1,…,n}𝑁1…𝑛N=\\{1,\\dots,n\\} and m𝑚m items to sell with M={1,…,m}𝑀1…𝑚M=\\{1,\\dots,m\\}. Consider the valuation of buyer i𝑖i to be vi​(S):S→R,∀S⊆M:subscript𝑣𝑖𝑆formulae-sequence→𝑆𝑅for-all𝑆𝑀v_{i}(S):S\\rightarrow R,\\forall S\\subseteq M and it is an additive valuation. Let the allocation be pw​(v)superscriptp𝑤v\\textbf{p}^{w}(\\textbf{v}) and the payment be tw​(v)superscriptt𝑤v\\textbf{t}^{w}(\\textbf{v}). Then the regret can be defined from Eqn. 19 where uiw=viT​piw−tiwsubscriptsuperscript𝑢𝑤𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝑣𝑇𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝑝𝑤𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝑡𝑤𝑖u^{w}_{i}=v^{T}_{i}p^{w}_{i}-t^{w}_{i}. Similarly, the dissatisfaction metric (i.e,. amount of dissatisfaction for each buyer i𝑖i) is defined as The proposed formulations are described below.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: of resources to buyers, for example, the allocation of natural resources such as spectrum allocation and the online advertisement of career opportunities to all the users irrespective of gender.
