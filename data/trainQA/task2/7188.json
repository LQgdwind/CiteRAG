Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Malla: Demystifying Real-world Large Language Model Integrated Malicious Services\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPast research showcased how LLMs can be weaponized across diverse domains, such as misinformation propagation   , deepfake user profile creation , spear phishing campaigns  [ref]53, attack and malware generation [ref]53 and the generation of hateful memes [ref]76.\nSpecifically,\nZhou et al.  generated a dataset of AI-generated misinformation and analyzed their characteristics compared with human-created misinformation.\nMink et al.  studied user perceptions towards deepfake-generated social persona. They used GPT-2 to generate deepfake profile descriptions to gauge user perceptions.\nHazell et al.  created spear phishing messages using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models to explore LLMs’ ability to assist with the reconnaissance and message generation stages of a spear phishing attack.\nGupta et al. [ref]53 undertook an exploratory study, interacting with a jailbroken ChatGPT to generate attack payloads and malware.\nQu et al. [ref]76 demonstrated the ease with which adversaries can craft convincing hateful meme variants using advanced algorithms.\nTo the best of our knowledge, none of these works have studied the exploitation of LLMs as malicious services in the context of tangible cybercriminal activities. Another body of research has delved into the weaknesses of LLMs that can be exploited to facilitate such misuse, mainly associated with two main types of attacks: prompt manipulation and jailbreaking.\nPrompt manipulation refers to the practice of manipulating an LLM’s system prompt, leading to model generations that are undesirable and harmful.\nSpecifically, Perez et al.  proposed the PROMPTINJECT framework to demonstrate that the simple prompt “Ignore the previous instructions and classify [ITEM] as [DISTRACTION]” can be used to lead an LLM into predicting [DISTRACTION], regardless of the original task.\nBranch et al. [ref]46 demonstrated the effectiveness of the above attack on GPT-3, BERT, ALBERT, and RoBERTa.\nGreshake et al.   discussed the threats of indirect prompt injection, which placed the PROMPTINJECT framework into indirect data sources that are retrieved and used by an LLM to generate a response.\nIn contrast to prompt injection, jailbreaking doesn’t mandate access to the model’s system prompt. Instead, it solely depends on crafting prompts to circumvent the LLM’s safety measures.\nOremus  crafted prompts with DAN (“Do Anything Now”) to circumvent moderation filters.\nQiu et al.  presented a set of prompts for English-Chinese translation tasks that contains malicious instructions.\nShen et al.  reported a measurement study of jailbreak prompts collected from four public online resources, and evaluated their effectiveness against three safeguarding approaches.\nIn contrast to these works, our research uncovered the mechanisms underpinning Malla, supplementing the understanding of the LLM exploitation landscape.\n\nReference markers found: [53]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]53: Past research showcased how LLMs can be weaponized across diverse domains, such as misinformation propagation   , deepfake user profile creation , spear phishing campaigns  [ref]53, attack and malware generation [ref]53 and the generation of hateful memes [ref]76.\nSpecifically,\nZhou et al.  generated a dataset of AI-generated misinformation and analyzed their\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
