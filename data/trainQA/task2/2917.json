      "content": "Paper Title: BINAS: Bilinear Interpretable Neural Architecture Search\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe increasing utilization of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in real systems and commercial products puts neural networks with both high accuracy and fast inference speed in high demand. Early days architectures, such as VGG [ref]38 or ResNet 4, were designed for powerful GPUs as those were the common computing platform for deep CNNs, however, in recent years the need for deployment on standard CPUs and edge devices emerged. These computing platforms are limited in their abilities and as a result require lighter architectures that comply with strict requirements on real time latency and power consumption. This has spawned a line of research aimed at finding architectures with both high performance and constrained resource demands. The main approaches to solve this evolved from Neural Architecture Search (NAS)   , while a constraint on the target latency is added over various platforms, e.g., CPU, TPU, FPGA, MCU etc.\nThose constrained-NAS methods can be grouped into two categories: (i) Reward based methods such as Reinforcement-Learning (RL) or Evolutionary Algorithms (EA)  1 2 , where the latency and accuracy of sampled architectures are predicted by evaluations on the target devices over some validation set to perform the search.\nThe predictors are typically made of complicated models and hence require many samples and sophisticated fitting techniques 4. Overall this oftentimes leads to inaccurate, expensive to acquire, and hard to optimize objective functions due to their complexity. (ii) Resource-aware gradient based methods formulate a differentiable loss function consisting of a trade-off between an accuracy term and either a proxy soft penalty term  5 or a hard constraint 9. Therefore, the architecture can be directly optimized via bi-level optimization using stochastic gradient descent (SGD)  or stochastic Frank-Wolfe (SFW) , respectively. However, the bi-level nature of the problem introduces many challenges  6   and recently 3 pointed out the inconsistencies associated with using gradient information as a proxy for the quality of the architectures, especially in the presence of skip connections in the search space. These inconsistencies call for making NAS more interpretable, by extending its scope from finding optimal architectures to interpretable features  and their corresponding impact on the network performance. In this paper, we propose an interpretable search algorithm that is fast and scalable, yet produces architectures with high accuracy that satisfy hard latency constraints.\nAt the heart of our approach is an accuracy estimator which is interpretable, easy to optimize and does not have a strong reliance on gradient information. Our proposed predictor measures the performance contribution of individual design choices by sampling sub-networks from a one-shot model (  2  9).\nConstructing the estimator this way allows making insights about the contribution of the design choices. It is important to note, that albeit its simplicity, our predictor’s performance matches that of previously proposed predictors, that are typically expensive to compute and hard to optimize due to many hyper-parameters. The predictor we propose has a bilinear form that allows formulating the latency constrained NAS problem as an Integer Quadratic Constrained Quadratic Programming (IQCQP). Thanks to this, the optimization can be efficiently solved via a simple algorithm with some off-the-shelf components. The algorithm we suggest solves it within a few minutes on a common CPU. Overall our optimization approach has two main performance related advantages. First, the outcome networks provide high accuracy and closely comply with the latency constraint.\nSecond, the search is highly efficient, which makes our approach scalable to multiple target devices and latency demands.\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: Neural Networks (CNN) in real systems and commercial products puts neural networks with both high accuracy and fast inference speed in high demand.
