      "content": "Paper Title: Quantum learning algorithms imply circuit lower bounds\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOne of the salient goals of quantum computing is to understand which computational problems admit quantum speedups over classical algorithms.\nThe canonical example is Shor’s algorithm  for factoring, which achieves an exponential speedup over the best known classical algorithms.\nAnother notable example is Grover’s algorithm , which sheds light on quantum complexity theory by showing that expressive languages such as the quintessential\n𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-complete problem 𝖥𝗈𝗋𝗆𝗎𝗅𝖺𝖥𝗈𝗋𝗆𝗎𝗅𝖺\\mathsf{Formula}-𝖲𝖠𝖳𝖲𝖠𝖳\\mathsf{SAT} admits quantum algorithms of time complexity O~​(2n/2)~𝑂superscript2𝑛2\\widetilde{O}(2^{n/2}), whereas in general, there are no known classical algorithms that outperform the O~​(2n)~𝑂superscript2𝑛\\widetilde{O}(2^{n})-time brute force search. This paper investigates the implications of quantum speedups within the setting of learning theory. Quantum learning theory forms the theoretical foundations which allow us to understand the potential power and limitations of quantum machine learning. At its core, this field studies quantum algorithms that are given quantum access (typically, quantum queries or quantum samples) to an unknown circuit f𝑓f from a fixed concept class ℭℭ\\mathfrak{C}, and the goal is to output a hypothesis hℎh that well-approximates f𝑓f, in which case we say that ℭℭ\\mathfrak{C} can be quantumly learned.\nDue to the massive success of machine learning and the great potential of quantum computing, quantum learning received much attention over the last two decades      6   2  (cf. survey [ref]10 and references therein). In this setting, quantum algorithms have two main advantages over their classical counterparts: making queries in superposition, and using quantum computation to process the information obtained from these queries. Note that a large number of negative results about the power of classical learning algorithms do not extend to the quantum setting (e.g.,  ), since the underlying hardness assumptions, based on problems such as factoring and discrete logarithm, break for quantum computations. In addition, in some learning models and for some learning tasks, quantum algorithms are strictly faster than classical algorithms , under standard cryptographic assumptions.\nWhile it is possible to rule out polynomial-time or quasi-polynomial time quantum learning algorithms for some concept classes using stronger cryptographic assumptions , our understanding of the possibilities and limitations of sub-exponential time quantum learnability is still limited. This motivates the following fundamental question: Are quantum speedups for learning expressive concept classes possible? Our main result exposes an intrinsic connection between complexity theory and quantum learning theory, showing that obtaining any quantum learner that does marginally better than certain “trivial” learners (see Section 1.1) would imply circuit lower bounds for languages computable in 𝖡𝖰𝖤𝖡𝖰𝖤\\mathsf{BQE}, the quantum analogue of 𝖤𝖤\\mathsf{E}.111Recall that 𝖤=𝖣𝖳𝖨𝖬𝖤​[2O​(n)]𝖤𝖣𝖳𝖨𝖬𝖤delimited-[]superscript2𝑂𝑛\\mathsf{E}=\\mathsf{DTIME}[2^{O(n)}], and analogously 𝖡𝖰𝖤=𝖡𝖰𝖳𝖨𝖬𝖤​[2O​(n)]𝖡𝖰𝖤𝖡𝖰𝖳𝖨𝖬𝖤delimited-[]superscript2𝑂𝑛\\mathsf{BQE}=\\mathsf{BQTIME}[2^{O(n)}]. To our knowledge, this is the first result connecting the design of general quantum algorithms to proving lower bounds: If a class ℭℭ\\mathfrak{C} of polynomial-size concepts can be learned under the uniform distribution with membership queries and with error at most 1/2−γ12𝛾1/2-\\gamma in quantum time o​(γ2⋅2n/n)𝑜⋅superscript𝛾2superscript2𝑛𝑛o(\\gamma^{2}\\cdot 2^{n}/n), then 𝖡𝖰𝖤⊈ℭnot-subset-of-nor-equals𝖡𝖰𝖤ℭ\\mathsf{BQE}\\nsubseteq\\mathfrak{C}. While it seems extremely unlikely that a large class such as 𝖡𝖰𝖤𝖡𝖰𝖤\\mathsf{BQE} can be simulated by classical Boolean circuits of polynomial size, showing this and similar results for exponential time classes seems to be out of reach of current techniques. For comparison, the recent 𝖭𝖤⊈𝖠𝖢𝖢𝟢not-subset-of-nor-equals𝖭𝖤superscript𝖠𝖢𝖢0\\mathsf{NE}\\nsubseteq\\mathsf{ACC^{0}} lower bound due to Williams 7 is widely recognized to be a milestone in complexity theory. Our result admits two possible interpretations. For a pessimist, it explains the difficulty of designing provably correct quantum learning algorithms for expressive concept classes, given that establishing non-uniform circuit lower bounds is a notoriously difficult problem.\nContrarily, for an optimist, it indicates a potential path to new lower bounds by exploring the power of quantum computation. For instance, if depth-222 threshold circuits of polynomial size can be learned in o​(2n/n)𝑜superscript2𝑛𝑛o(2^{n}/n) quantum time under the uniform distribution, a new complexity lower bound would follow. Our starting point in the proof of this result is a connection of a similar nature between classical learning algorithms and circuit lower bounds due to Oliveira and Santhanam 4. The extension to quantum learning algorithms turns out to require significant technical work. En route to that, we obtain new results concerning local list-decoding for quantum circuits, construct the first 𝖯𝖱𝖦𝖯𝖱𝖦\\mathsf{PRG} secure against uniform quantum computations, and provide a new general method to establish learning-to-lower-bound connections. We next describe our contributions in more detail.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: learned.\nDue to the massive success of machine learning and the great potential of quantum computing, quantum learning received much attention over the last two decades      6   2  (cf. survey [ref]10 and references therein).
