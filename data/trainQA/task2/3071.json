Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Large Scale Benchmark for Individual Treatment Effect Prediction and Uplift Modeling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPioneering work in ITE prediction in the 2000’s and 2010’s such as  or  use two landmarks datasets: IHDP, a randomized infant development study (<1,000 samples) and Jobs  (approx. 3,000 samples), a randomized job training study, both collected in the 1980’s. Very recent published work in ITE prediction still use almost exclusively these datasets to day [54; 43; 56]. Besides, in order to benchmark multiple methods, ACIC challenge  was held from 2016 to 2019 using IHDP dataset combined with diverse generation processes.\nIn the field of UM a notable exception to private datasets is the Hillstrom study  (64,000 samples) collecting the sales results of an e-mail marketing campaign from the 2000’s. Whilst a good improvement it is under documented and still lagging behind in terms of scale and covariates dimensionality (see Table 1) compared to modern datasets in other areas such as computer vision [ref]20 or recommender systems  where rich features and the million samples landmark are common.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: a good improvement it is under documented and still lagging behind in terms of scale and covariates dimensionality (see Table 1) compared to modern datasets in other areas such as computer vision [ref]20 or recommender systems  where rich features and the million samples landmark are common.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
