      "content": "Paper Title: Average-Constrained Policy Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nLearning constraint-satisfaction policies has been explored in the Deep RL literature . This can either be (1) through expert annotations and demonstrations [ref]25  or, (2) by exploration with constraint satisfaction  2. While the former approach is not scalable since it requires human interventions, current state-of-the-art algorithms for the latter are not applicable to the average reward setting. Previous work on RL with the average reward criterion has mostly attempted to extend stochastic approximation schemes for the tabular setting, such as Q-learning  8, to the non-tabular setting with function approximation 9 .  deals with online learning in a constrained MDP setting, but their aim is regret minimization or exploration, both in tabular settings.  provide bounds on the performance of a trust region algorithm for the the average reward setting but do not incorporate constraints. Thus, we believe that our ACPO algorithm is the first policy optimization algorithm for CMDPs with average rewards and average constraints, and with function approximation. The algorithm, just like PPO, is practical and scalable, as seen by its superior empirical performance compared to other alternatives. Since our work is related to CPO  and ATRPO , we highlight our work‚Äôs novelty as follows. ACPO is designed to find the optimal policy of the undiscounted average-CMDP problem directly, with an average reward objective and constraints on average cost functions. While CPO is designed for discounted CMDPs (setting Œ≥=1ùõæ1\\gamma=1 in CPO does not yield the ACPO algorithm), and though we could use it for the average case by setting Œ≥‚Üí1‚Üíùõæ1\\gamma\\to 1, we shall see that empirically it has inferior performance to ACPO. Moreover, theory for CPO and ATRPO cannot be extended trivially to the ACPO algorithm, but since they are all trust region methods, they share some analysis. Several of our techniques are still unique, e.g. in Lemma 3.3, we use eigenvalues of the transition matrix to relate total variation (TV) of stationary distributions with the TV of the policies, and in Lemma A.3, we use the sublevel sets of constraints and projection inequality of Bregman divergence. We now begin with some preliminaries.\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: Learning constraint-satisfaction policies has been explored in the Deep RL literature .
