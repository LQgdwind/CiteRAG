      "content": "Paper Title: Graph Self-Contrast Representation Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets:\nFor unsupervised learning,\nwe use 8 datasets from the benchmark TU dataset ,\nincluding graph data for various biochemical molecules (i.e., NCI1, PROTEINS, DD, MUTAG) and social networks (i.e., COLLAB, REDDIT-BINARY, REEDIT-MULTI-5K and IMDB-BINARY).\nFor transfer learning, we perform pre-training on ZINC-2M which samples 2 million unlabeled molecules from ZINC15  and fine-tune the model with 8 datasets including BBBP, Tox21, ToxCast, SIDER, ClinTox, MUV, HIV and BACE.\nMore details can be seen in the Table I and Table II. Baselines:\nFor unsupervised learning,\nwe compare GraphSC with\nthree kernel-based methods including graphlet kernel (GL) , Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel (WL) , and deep graph kernel (DGK) . Furthermore, we compare GraphSC with other state-of-the-art\nmethods: sub2vec , graph2vec , InfoGraph , GraphCL [ref]3, JOAO(v2) , AD-GCL [ref]36, SimGRACE , RGCL  and LaGraph .\nWe also take GraphSC-MSE as our baseline.\nFor transfer learning, we adopt DGI , EdgePred [ref]47, AttrMasking [ref]47, ContextPred [ref]47, GraphCL [ref]3, JOAO(v2) , AD-GCL [ref]36, SimGRACE , GraphLoG and RGCL , which are the state-of-the-art pre-training paradigms in this area, as our baselines. Evaluation Protocols: Following the settings of previous works [ref]47 [ref]3 , we evaluate the performance and generalizability of the learned representations on both unsupervised and transfer learning settings.\nIn unsupervised setting, we train GraphSC  using the whole dataset to learn graph representations and feed them into a downstream SVM classifier with 10-fold cross-validation, report the mean accuracy with standard deviation after 5 runs.\nFor transfer learning, we pre-train and fine-tune GNN encoder in different datasets to evaluate the transferability of the pre-training scheme.\nThe fine-tuning procedure is repeated for 10 times with different random seeds and we evaluate the mean and standard deviation of AUROC scores on each downstream dataset, which is consistent with our baselines. Implementation details:\nWe implement GraphSC  using PyTorch. The model is initialized by Xavier initialization  and trained by Adam .\nAs suggested in ,\nwe set ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon in (13) and (15) to 0.2. Similarly,\nwe set β𝛽\\beta in (18) to 0.013 according to 3.\nFor other hyperparameters,\nwe fine-tune them by grid search.\nFor unsupervised learning,\nwe first fine-tune learning rate from {0.001,0.005,0.01}0.0010.0050.01\\{0.001,0.005,0.01\\}. For the augmentation functions A​(⋅)𝐴⋅A(\\cdot), we choose from four augmentations and some of their combinations, which are in line with GraphCL [ref]3.\nFor the perturbation rates rasubscript𝑟𝑎r_{a} and rbsubscript𝑟𝑏r_{b}, we fine-tune them from {0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2} and {0.15,0.2,0.25,0.3,0.35,0.4} respectively. In addition, we fine-tune λ1subscript𝜆1\\lambda_{1}, λ2subscript𝜆2\\lambda_{2} and λ3subscript𝜆3\\lambda_{3} from {0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100 }.\nIn transfer learning, we pre-trained the GNN encoder on the ZINC-2M dataset, and we set learning rate to 0.001, the number of epochs to 80, rasubscript𝑟𝑎r_{a} to 0.1, rbsubscript𝑟𝑏r_{b} to 0.25, λ1subscript𝜆1\\lambda_{1} to 1, λ2subscript𝜆2\\lambda_{2} to 0.01 and λ3subscript𝜆3\\lambda_{3} to 0.01. In addition, we use the combination of subgraph and node dropping as augmentation function, which is the same as GraphCL [ref]3. In the process of fine-tuning, we adjust the two hyperparameters learning rate and epoch, and the grid search range is {0.0001, 0.0005, 0.001} and {20, 40, 60, 80, 100} respectively.\nSince most results of baselines are publicly available,\nwe directly report these results from their original papers.\nFor the results of AD-GCL and GraphLoG,\nwe report these results from RGCL .\nFor fairness,\nwe run all the experiments on a server with 128G memory and a single NVIDIA 2080Ti GPU.\nWe provide our code and data here:\nhttps://anonymous.4open.science/r/GraphSC-8360.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: graphlet kernel (GL) , Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel (WL) , and deep graph kernel (DGK) . Furthermore, we compare GraphSC with other state-of-the-art\nmethods: sub2vec , graph2vec , InfoGraph , GraphCL [ref]3, JOAO(v2) , AD-GCL [ref]36, SimGRACE , RGCL  and LaGraph .\nWe also take GraphSC-MSE as our baseline.\nFor transfer learning, we adopt DGI , EdgePred [ref]47, AttrMasking [ref]47, ContextPred\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.
