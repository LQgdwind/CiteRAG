      "content": "Paper Title: pNNCLR: Stochastic Pseudo Neighborhoods for Contrastive Learning based Unsupervised Representation Learning Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the context of self-supervised learning, a pretext task refers to a puzzle or sub-task that is solved by the SSL model. The objective is to learn the underlying structure of the data by deriving a supervision signal from the sub-task in an unsupervised manner, i.e., without relying on any labeled data [ref]18.\nDoersch et al. explored spatial context as a supervision signal for training visual representations [ref]18. Their approach involved dividing a region in image into 9 patches, then sampling pairs from these patches and training the model to predict the relative position of a patch given another patch from the pair. They achieved unsupervised object discovery and improved performance on object detection tasks.\nZhang et al. used cross channel color space prediction as a pretext task [ref]21 [ref]23. They used a CNN to predict ab color space from L channel of the CIE Lab* color space. It was found that colorization could be a useful option for learning representations for vision tasks.\nPathak et al. also used context information for their inpainting pretext task by forcing their context encoding CNN to predict the missing region in an input image . Although predicting the entire region is an under constrained task, however, their approach produced strong image representations.\nAnother line of work (Shuffle learn , Sequence sorting , Sustained order verification  , Odd one out ), used frame order prediction as the pretext task. These models learned meaningful image representations for vision tasks. However, it was not as strong as the representations learned by other pretext tasks, like context prediction or spatial rearrangement.\nNoroozi et al. proposed an even more challenging pretext task of sorting all nine pieces of a Jigsaw puzzle . They also suggested several shortcut prevention approaches as they emphasized — “A good self-supervised task is neither simple nor ambiguous.\"\nGidaris et al. proposed a simple rotation prediction as the pretext task for CNNs . The objective was to predict the angle of rotation from 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees. Rotation turned out to be a simple yet powerful SSL strategy since it does not leave any easily detectable low-level visual shortcut for trivial feature learning.\nChen et al. adapted a GPT-2 scale transformer model from Masked Language Modeling (MLM) to Masked Image Modeling (MIM) on pixels of down-scaled images . Objective of the pretext task was to auto-regressively predict the masked pixels in the transformer output in a BERT-like sense.\nFollowing the same line, Zhou et al. introduced an online visual tokenizer for MIM . They showed that better semantics could be learned by simultaneously training the tokenizer with the MIM transformer through knowledge distillation.\nXie et al. simplified the previous transformer based masked prediction pretext task methods by dropping blockwise masking and tokenization . Their model achieved competitive results with just linear probing.\n\nReference markers found: [18]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]18: the SSL model. The objective is to learn the underlying structure of the data by deriving a supervision signal from the sub-task in an unsupervised manner, i.e., without relying on any labeled data [ref]18.\nDoersch et al. explored spatial context as a supervision signal for training visual representations [ref]18. Their approach involved dividing a region in image into 9 patches, then sampling\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
