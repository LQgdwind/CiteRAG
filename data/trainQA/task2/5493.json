      "content": "Paper Title: A Biomedical Knowledge Graph for Biomarker Discovery in Cancer\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn systems medicine, holistic approaches for complete systems are applied to understand complex physiological and pathological processes, thereby forming the basis for the development of innovative methods for the diagnosis, therapy, and prevention strategies mitigating disease conditions1. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are widely used for the analysis and interpretation of multimodal data (e.g., multi-omics data, imaging data, clinical outcomes, medication data, disease progression, lifestyle information, etc.) to achieve early detection, prediction and diagnosis of diseases, personalized interventions, and finally identifying biomarkers and targets for new therapies  . With the help of ML models for disease progression, the clinical data can be combined and fully analyzed in a multimodal data setting for new biomarker discovery and early disease detection. Yet, the adoption of data-driven approaches has been hampered in many clinical settings by the lack of scalable computational methods (e.g., ML models) that can deal with large-scale data (being often heterogeneous, high dimensional, unstructured, and having high levels of uncertainty) to perform in a reliable and safe manner . The development of solutions for precision medicine requires the integration of multi-omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, or metabolomics data), into clinical decision-making process . Furthermore, harmonization and seamless integration of diverse datasets from heterogeneous and distributed systems across different platforms is challenging  as the quantity and diversity of biomedical data, and the spread of clinically relevant knowledge across multiple biomedical databases and publications, pose a challenge to data integration. A challenging scenario for AI solutions is the use of large-scale clinical data for improving the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions based on cancer  . Cancer is characterized as a heterogeneous disease, having many types and subtypes  . It is caused when cells turn abnormal, divide rapidly, and spread to other tissues and organs and may be further driven by a series of genetic mutations of genes induced by selection pressures of carcinogenesis in the cells. The so-called marker genes including oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are often responsible for cancer growth. When a gene is over- or under-expressed as a differentially expressed gene, it becomes uncontrollable proliferation or immorality of cancer cells  . Although the difference in the average of expression values between two sample classes is frequently employed in transcriptomics analyses, such difference is not the only way a gene can be expressed differentially . With more than 200 different types identified to date, cancer has become the second leading cause of death worldwide 0. According to the National Cancer Institute2 an estimated 17.35 million new cancer cases were diagnosed in the United States in 2018 of which 609,640 people died; while there were 18 million new cases of which 9.5 million deaths were reported worldwide. The number of new cases is expected to rise to 23.6 million by 2030 and is anticipated to increase by 70% by 2035 and to 29.5 million by 2040. On the other hand, according to Federal Statistical Office3, 231271 people died of cancer in Germany in 2020, where breast and lung cancer are the leading causes of death111https://www.cancer.org/research/cancer-facts-statistics/all-cancer-facts-figures/cancer-facts-figures-2018.html. Cancer research relies on a large number of diverse datasets generated by different omics technologies. Electronic health record data, which are gathered at the point-of-care, are increasingly utilized in pre-clinical and clinical research as well as health management and analyzed in unison with genomic data. Curation, management, and analysis of these data present unique challenges arising from data heterogeneity, complexity, and size. Ontologies and knowledge graphs are being increasingly adopted to address these issues, and have great potential to support multidisciplinary cancer research efforts. Moreover, ontology-based approaches for genomics, machine learning, and clinical decision support are a growing hot topic due to their potential to support explainability. Experts are often interested in gathering and comprehending knowledge and mechanism of certain biological process, e.g., diseases to design strategies in order to develop prevention and therapeutics decision making process. “Knowledge is something that is known and can be written down” . Knowledge containing simple statements, e.g., “TP53 is an oncogene” or quantified statements, such as “All oncogenes are responsible for cancer” can be extracted from structured sources such as knowledge or rule bases. Moreover, knowledge can be extracted from external sources like scientific articles, where KG could be an effective means to capture facts from heterogeneous data sources. For example, scientific literature and patents provide a huge treasure of structured and unstructured information about different biological entities. One prominent example is PubMed, which contain millions of scientific articles is a great source of knowledge in biomedical domain [ref]8. PubMed data are mostly unstructured and heterogeneous. This makes the knowledge extraction process very challenging. Domain experts may need to rely on up-to-date findings from external sources, e.g., knowledge and facts about drugs, genes, protein, and their mechanism are spread across a huge number of structured (knowledge bases) and unstructured (e.g., scientific articles) [ref]9 0.\nIn the last few years, thanks to the availability of sizeable open-access article repositories such as PubMed Central (Beck 2010), arxiv (https://arxiv.org) bioarxiv (https://www.biorxiv.org/) as well as ontology databases which hold entities and their relations (Lambrix et al. 2007), the research community has focused on text mining tools and machine learning algorithms to digest these corpora and extract valuable semantic knowledge from them. These articles form a large-scale biomedical data source and can have a huge impact on disseminating mechanisms about certain biological processes, e.g., diseases to design strategies o develop prevention and therapeutics decision-making process 0. However, extracting knowledge and facts from unstructured, heterogeneous, and scattered sources is a very challenging task. The problem of semantic heterogeneity is further compounded due to the flexibility of semi-structured data and various tagging methods applied to documents or unstructured data.\nSemantic Web (SW) technologies address data variety, by proposing graphs as a unifying data model, to which a data can be mapped in the form of a graph structure. Ontology-based named entity extraction and disambiguation help with unambiguous identification of entities in heterogeneous data and assertion of applicable named relationships that connect these entities together. A graph may not only contain data, but also metadata and domain knowledge (ontologies containing axioms or rules), all in the same uniform structure, and are then called knowledge graph (KGs) 1 2. Owing to the SW technologies that offer functionality to connect previously isolated pieces of data and knowledge, associate meaning to them, and represent knowledge extracted from them. In particular, ontology-based named entity relation extraction (NER) and disambiguation help with unambiguous identification of entities in heterogeneous data and assertion of applicable named relationships that connect these entities together. Information extraction is the process of automatically extracting structured knowledge and facts from such unstructured and/or semi-structured machine-readable documents and other electronically represented sources 3. Information extraction is typically done in three steps: i) NER that recognizes the named entities scientific articles, ii) entity linking (EL) to link extracted named entities, and iii) relation extraction (RE). NER is recognizing domain-specific proper nouns in a biomedical corpus. It can be performed by fine-tuning a domain-specific BERT variant such as BioBERT 4 and SciBERT 5 on relevant articles. The RE step also involves relation classification, which is typically formulated as a classification problem to classify the relationship between entities identified in the text 6. A classifier takes a piece of text and two entities as inputs and predicts possible relations between the entities as output. The EL task is about associating mentions of the named entities in a text with the existing nodes of our target KG 2. For example, for the abstract: “Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 mRNA and protein expression were found to be frequently elevated in human pancreatic adenocarcinomas and cell lines derived from such tumours. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated cytoplasmic COX-2 expression in 14 of 21 (67%) pancreatic carcinomas. The level of COX-2 mRNA was found to be elevated in carcinomas, relative to the histologically normal pancreas from a healthy individual, as assessed by reverse transcription-PCR.”, a NER model would be able to recognize named entities classified as diseases, chemical or genetic, as shown in, where named entities are highlighted with different HMs. Facts containing simple statements, e.g., “TP53 is an oncogene” or quantified statements:“oncogenes are responsible for cancer” can be extracted and integrated into a knowledge graph (KG). A simple statement can be accumulated as an edge in a KG, while quantified statements provide a more expressive way to represent knowledge, which however requires ontologies 2. Hogan et al. 2 defined KG as “a graph of data intended to accumulate and convey knowledge of the real world, whose nodes represent entities of interest and whose edges represent potentially different relations between these entities”. Nodes in a KG represent entities and edges represent binary relations between those entities 2. A KG can be defined as G={E,R,T}𝐺𝐸𝑅𝑇G=\\{E,R,T\\}, where G𝐺G is a labelled and directed multi-graph, and E,R,T𝐸𝑅𝑇E,R,T are the sets of entities, relations, and triples, respectively and a triple can be represented as (u,e,v)∈T𝑢𝑒𝑣𝑇(u,e,v)\\in T, where u∈E𝑢𝐸u\\in E is the head node, v∈E𝑣𝐸v\\in E is the tail node, and e∈R𝑒𝑅e\\in R is the edge connecting u𝑢u and v𝑣v 2. A common way to represent the extracted facts in Resource Description Framework (RDF). RDF is a semantic data model, where the linking structure of a KG forms a directed graph and triples are represented in the form of (u,e,v)𝑢𝑒𝑣(u,e,v) or (s​u​b​j​e​c​t,p​r​e​d​i​c​a​t​e,o​b​j​e​c​t)𝑠𝑢𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑜𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡(subject,predicate,object). Each triple forms a connected component of a sentence for a KG. A number of languages have been proposed for querying a KG in RDF format 2, including the SPARQL query language for RDF graphs222https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/.\nReasoning over KGs enables consistency checking to recognize conflicting facts, classification by defining taxonomies, and deductive inferencing by revealing implicit knowledge from a set of facts 7. However, exploration, processing, and analysis of large-scale KGs pose a great challenge to current computational methods. To provide cancer diagnosis reasoning over the DNN models, an integrated domain-specific KG is required, which is subject to the availability of an efficient NLP-based information extraction method and a domain-specific ontology.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: and unstructured information about different biological entities.
