      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Scalable Multi-Agent Coordination by Spatial Differentiation for Traffic Signal Control\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTraffic congestion has been an increasingly critical matter for decades. It not only leads to an increase in commuting time but also exacerbates noise and environmental pollution issues due to frequent acceleration and deceleration. According to relevant researches, almost all collisions and delays in urban traffic are concentrated on intersections[ref]1. Unreasonable signal control significantly leads to a waste of traffic resources. Therefore, the key to solve urban congestion is to keep the intersection clear. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods have been well applied in the traffic signal regulation of single-intersection and shown a better performance than traditional methods[ref]3, such as Max-pressure. Recent works began to try to apply DRL algorithms, especially multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)[ref]6, to multi-intersection and even large-scale road networks. Different from the single-intersection problem, the intelligent regulation of large-scale road networks needs to achieve synergistic control between various intersections which can be regarded as a Multi-objective Optimization Problem (MOP) and Markov/Stochastic Games (MGs) with Cooperative Setting. In other words, multiple agents need to coordinate with each other. They need to keep their intersection open, and at the same time, pay attention to the traffic flow status of surrounding or even remote intersections, so that they can ultimately improve the efficiency of the overall road network. The latest research introduced the graph attention network (GAT) to share the observations of real-time traffic volume implicitly with each other, and get an inspired result.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: and environmental pollution issues due to frequent acceleration and deceleration. According to relevant researches, almost all collisions and delays in urban traffic are concentrated on intersections[ref]1. Unreasonable signal control significantly leads to a waste of traffic resources. Therefore, the key to solve urban congestion is to keep the intersection clear.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
