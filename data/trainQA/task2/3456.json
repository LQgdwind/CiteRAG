      "content": "Paper Title: Strategy Synthesis for Zero-Sum Neuro-Symbolic Concurrent Stochastic Games\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nStochastic games were introduced by Shapley [ref]4, who assumed a finite state space.\nSince then, many researchers, have considered CSGs with uncountable state spaces,\ne.g.,   .\nMaitra and Parthasarathy  were the first to study discounted zero-sum CSGs in this setting, assuming that the state space is a compact metric space. Following this, more general results for discounted zero-sum CSGs with Borel state spaces have been derived, e.g.,    . These aim at providing sufficient conditions for the existence of either values or optimal strategies for players. Another important and practical problem for zero-sum CSGs with uncountable state spaces is the computation of values and optimal strategies. Since the seminal policy iteration (PI) methods were introduced by Hoffman and Karp  and Pollatschek and Avi-Itzhak , a wide range of fixed-point algorithms have been developed for zero-sum CSGs with finite state\nspaces    . Recent work by Bertsekas [ref]17 proposed a distributed optimistic abstract PI algorithm, which inherits the attractive structure of the Pollatschek and Avi-Itzhak algorithm while resolving its convergence difficulties. Value iteration (VI) and PI algorithms have been improved for simple stochastic games  . However, all of the above approaches assume finite state spaces and, to the best of our knowledge, there are no existing VI or PI algorithms for CSGs with uncountable, or more specifically Borel, state spaces. VI and PI algorithms for stochastic control (i.e., the one player case) with Borel state spaces can be found in  . Other problems for zero-sum CSGs with uncountable state spaces have been studied and include information structure , specialized strategy spaces , continuous time setup  and payoff criteria . A variety of other objectives, for instance, mean-payoff  , ratio  and reachability  [ref]36 objectives, have also been studied for CSGs    .\nBut these are primarily in the context of finite/countable state spaces which,\nas argued above, are insufficient for our setting where\nuncountable real vector spaces are usually supplied as inputs to NNs.\nWe remark that, building on an earlier version of this work ,\nthere has been recent progress on solving NS-CSGs ,\nbut focusing on finite-horizon objectives and using equilibria-based (nonzero-sum) properties. Finally, we note that this paper assumes a fully observable game setting;\na natural extension would be partially observable stochastic games (POSGs), for which there are no general VI and PI computation algorithms.\nA variant of POSGs, called factored-observation stochastic games (FOSGs),\nwas recently proposed \nthat distinguishes between private and public observations in a similar fashion to our model,\nbut for finite-state models without NNs.\nPartial observability in FOSGs is dealt with via a mechanism that converts imperfect-information games\ninto continuous-state (public belief state) perfect-information games  ,\nsuch that many techniques for perfect-information games can also be applied. Our fully observable model can arguably serve as a vehicle to later solve the more complex case with imperfect information.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: Stochastic games were introduced by Shapley [ref]4, who assumed a finite state space.\nSince then, many researchers, have considered CSGs with uncountable state spaces,\ne.g.,   .\nMaitra and Parthasarathy  were the first to study discounted\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
