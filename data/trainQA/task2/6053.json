      "content": "Paper Title: Rumor Detection with Hierarchical Representation on Bipartite Adhoc Event Trees\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets. We adopt two publicly available datasets, i.e., PHEME111https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/PHEME_dataset_of_rumours_and_non-rumours/4010619 [ref]48 and RumorEval222https://alt.qcri.org/semeval2017/task8/index.php?id=data-and-tools [ref]49, for evaluation. Detailed statistics of these two datasets are provided in Table III. Both datasets are real-world data collected from the social platform Twitter, and the RumorEval dataset was developed for the SemEval-2017 Task 8 competition. The PHEME dataset contains five breaking news events, while RumorEval involves eight breaking news events. Both datasets contain post texts, author information, timestamps, and propagation information. Each claim is labeled with a binary class (i.e., True Rumor or False Rumor). In addition, during data preprocessing of the PHEME data, we removed noisy samples that have less than 3 retweets or do not have author information associated with the authors (IDs) of the claim post or retweet post. All comparative models are evaluated on the two datasets to provide an extensive and fair comparison. Baselines. We conduct a comprehensive comparison of our model with state-of-the-art rumor detection baselines. DTR : A decision tree-based ranking model proposed to identify trending rumors through searching query phrases. CNN : A convolutional neural network with multiple filter sizes that is used to detect the stance of posts and determine the veracity of specific rumors. SVM : A linear SVM classifier that is used to identify rumors by leveraging temporal sequences to model the chronological variation of social context features. TE : A content-based model that leverages tensor decomposition to derive concise article embeddings, capture contextual information and create an article-by-article graph on limited labels. RvNN [ref]18: A top-down (down-top) model based on tree-structured RvNN proposed to detect rumors through integrating structure and content. We choose the well-performed top-down model as our baseline. DTCA : A decision tree-based co-attention model developed to detect rumors by discovering evidence for explainable verification, in which the evidence scores combine both authors’ and texts’ information. RvNN-GA : An enhanced rumor detection model proposed with designed discriminative attention mechanisms based on TD-RvNN/BU-RvNN. In this work, we select the top-down global attention model as a baseline. Bi-GCN : A bi-directional graph model based on two-layer GCNs to detect rumors through integrating structural features of both propagation depth (top-down) and dispersion (down-top). ClaHi-GAT : A graph attention network model is proposed to represent posts and authors as an undirected graph and then augmented by a multi-layer attention mechanism to learn the rumor indicator characteristics. EBGCN : An edge-enhanced rumor detection model proposed with multiple graph conventional layers to iteratively aggregate features of structural neighbors and consider the uncertainty issue. RGNN : A rumor detection framework based on structure-aware retweeting graph neural networks to integrate content, users, and propagation patterns from a converted tractable binary tree to enhance performance. FGCN : A neuro-fuzzy method with fuzzy graph convolutional networks to capture uncertain interactions in the information cascade in a fuzzy perspective based on the tree or tree-like structure of source tweets. These representative and state-of-the-art baselines are chosen carefully for extensive comparisons. 1) DTR, CNN, and SVM are representative baselines based on handcrafted features, and TE is a content-based detection model. Those baselines are compared to investigate the effectiveness of propagation information in the detection. 2) The other state-of-the-art baselines include RNN-, attention-, and GNN-based models that elaborately leverage propagation information to enhance detection. Those baselines are selected to investigate the benefits of our proposed bipartite adhoc trees, especially involving the propagation information from the author’s perspective. In addition, multi-modality detection models are not considered in the experiments since those methods based on multi-modality information of text and image inputs do not belong to the family of propagation-based models. Experimental settings. (1) Parameter settings: In the experiments, all parameters are initialized with a normal distribution, and we perform a grid search of the learning rate over {1​e−3,5​e−3,1​e−4,5​e−4,1​e−5}1superscript𝑒35superscript𝑒31superscript𝑒45superscript𝑒41superscript𝑒5\\{1e^{-3},5e^{-3},1e^{-4},5e^{-4},1e^{-5}\\} and L2 regularization rate over {0,1​e−1,1​e−2,1​e−3,1​e−4}01superscript𝑒11superscript𝑒21superscript𝑒31superscript𝑒4\\{0,1e^{-1},1e^{-2},1e^{-3},1e^{-4}\\} to guarantee the best performance of our proposed BAET. For hyperparameters Ω=d,μΩ𝑑𝜇\\Omega={d,\\mu}, we tune the dimension of the embedding and hidden units d𝑑d over {16,32,64,128,256}163264128256\\{16,32,64,128,256\\} and μ𝜇\\mu over {0.0,0.2,0.4,…,1.0}0.00.20.4…1.0\\{0.0,0.2,0.4,...,1.0\\} to choose the values with the best performance for BAET. Finally, we set i) the embedding dimension d=128𝑑128d=128; ii) a balance weight μ=0.6𝜇0.6\\mu=0.6; iii) the ADAM optimizer  with an initial learning rate of 0.0050.0050.005; iv) a batch size of 161616; v) L2 regularization rate of 1​e−31superscript𝑒31e^{-3}; vi) a dropout rate of 0.50.50.5.\n(2) Baseline settings: Regarding the baselines, we implement RvNN, RvNN-GA, BiGCN, and EBGCN according to their published source codes, while other baselines are implemented by referring to the corresponding papers. To ensure fair comparisons, the best parameters for all comparative models are chosen by carefully tuning the author-recommended parameter ranges based on their recommended settings. Specifically, for the parameters in each baseline, we first initialize them with the values reported in the original paper and then carefully tune them on our datasets for best performance.\n(3) Metrics: We adopt four metrics accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate all comparative rumor detection models. We conducted the experiments using five-fold cross-validation and report the average evaluation results. (4) Platforms: All experiments were implemented in PyTorch and were conducted on two NVIDIA 1080 12G GPUs.\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: Datasets.
