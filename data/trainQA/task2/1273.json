Figure 1 depicts a timeline with important milestones and achievements in short-term traffic forecasting approached via Deep Learning models. Among them, recent surveys that address short-term traffic forecasting in conjunction with Deep Learning methods are analyzed in this section, in order to highlight the need for the synthesis and investigation presented in this work. Starting with , this work focuses on different Deep Learning architectures applied for short-term traffic forecasting and explains their components and operation. A categorization of the reviewed models is presented, providing an overview of new modeling proposals. The second and third surveys  [ref]39 analyze several Deep Learning methods for different transportation topics, including traffic signal control, autonomous driving and traffic state prediction. Therefore, the authors do not stress on the specific short-term traffic forecasting sub-domain, and only a few works concerning this topic are considered. Further away from the subject of short-term traffic forecasting,  revolves around spatio-temporal data mining as a general task that can be formulated in many application domains. Indeed, authors review Deep Learning models proposed for transportation and human mobility, but also take into account other unrelated topics like neuroscience and crime analysis. As a result, this survey only provides insights for some traffic forecasting solutions that benefit from spatio-temporal relationships. Another survey on traffic prediction is available at , where authors summarize the state of the art on traffic prediction methods, and comment on the different Deep Learning architectures. It is the only work among those reviewed in Table I that performs an empirical study. This experimental setup aims for comparing performance among recent Deep Learning methods, but no further insights are given in regard to whether such performance levels are superior to those rendered by simpler learners. Next, both  and [ref]43, provide an overview of existing Deep Learning methods for traffic flow forecasting. Future challenges for the research field are discussed in , such as a lack of well-established benchmark datasets, the inclusion of contextual data (for instance, weather data) and the development of graph-based modeling techniques. Finally,  conforms to a further overview of Deep Learning methods applied to short-term traffic forecasting. The authors classify published models by generation, according to the complexity and structure of the Deep Learning technique. After analyzing the summarized works at Table I, we conclude that they do not entirely provide a comprehensive, critical vision of the use of Deep Learning models for short-term traffic forecasting. Those who match the topic are restricted to an overview of the components of available Deep Learning architectures, while the remaining ones gravitate around general subjects like transportation or spatio-temporal data mining. It is our belief that a survey should go beyond an overview of recent Deep Learning techniques, towards answering other important questions such as why? and what for?. Deep Learning models lead the majority of short-term traffic forecasting benchmarks, but often authors do not discuss the caveats related to their implementation. Some endemic features of Deep Learning do not comply with the requirements of traffic managers, including their computational complexity and black-box nature. Therefore, the adoption of such modeling techniques should be supported by other evidences and statements than a performance gain over other data-driven methods. Based on this rationale, this overview does not elaborate on the different Deep Learning architectures used in the literature, but instead focuses on classifying it according to alternative criteria more aligned with the questions formulated above.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: Table I summarizes the criteria under consideration for each survey that has been published so far on Deep Learning models for short-term traffic forecasting. \n\n\n\n\n\nSurvey\n\n\n[ref]39\n\n\n\n[ref]43\n\nOurs\n\nPeriod\n1994 - 2018\n1997 - 2017\n1999 - 2018\n2012 - 2018\n2015 - 2020\n2014-2019\n2014 - 2019\n2014 - 2020\n2015 - 2020\n\n# of reviewed works\n∼70similar-toabsent70\\sim\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
