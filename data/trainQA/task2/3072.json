      "content": "Paper Title: ACR-Pose: Adversarial Canonical Representation Reconstruction Network for Category Level 6D Object Pose Estimation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\n6D object pose estimation is at the core of many applications, such as robotic grasping  2 9, augmented reality   1, and autonomous driving 5  6. Given an observation (RGB, RGBD, or LiDAR scan), 6D object pose estimation aims to estimate the rotation and translation of the target object in the camera coordinate system. Over the last decade, numerous 6D object pose estimation works7 7 9 1  4  have emerged and been deployed in industrial products, demonstrating the usefulness of this line of research. However, most of the existing methods are instance-level approaches, i.e., a well-trained model works only for a particular object.\nThis prohibits large-scale applications in the wild, as it is both memory-inefficient and labor exhausting to train and deploy models per object. To address this issue, category-level 6D object pose estimation has become increasingly popular recently among academia and industry. Given a RGBD observation as input, a deep learning network is often used to predict a canonical representation 3 of the target object. The canonical representation refers to a normalized 3D model that integrates a category of objects’ most representative characteristics, independent of the object’s pose, such as the NOCS 3 and the CASS [ref]5 representation. Once the canonical representation is obtained, it can be used to align with the back-projected object depth observation to recover the object’s pose. Therefore, the key to successful category-level object pose estimation is to accurately reconstruct the canonical representation. Although existing methods 3 [ref]5 8  3 have achieved promising 6D object pose estimation performance through the canonical representation, their reconstruction quality still needs improvement. Specifically, previous methods have the following drawbacks: 1) They are ineffective in learning canonical-related features due to their sensitivity to pose-related characteristics. 2) They ignore the critical relational information between different input modalities. 3) Some of their reconstruction results appear to be unrealistic. In this paper, we propose an Adversarial Canonical Representation Reconstruction pipeline called ACR-Pose, which aims at reconstructing high quality canonical representations for precise 6D object estimation as shown in Fig. 1. In ACR-Pose, we first detect and segment out objects from the RGBD images. Then, taking the image patch and depth region of an object as input, we train a Reconstructor and a Discriminator in an adversarial manner to generate realistic canonical representations. Specifically, as the Reconstructor plays a significant role in generating high-quality canonical representations, two novel sub-modules are proposed to learn more discriminative and robust features within the Reconstructor. First, we note that observations of the objects contain both pose-related information (rotation and translation) and shape information, and existing canonical representation reconstruction models 3 8 are sensitive to pose-related characteristics. However, since the goal of reconstruction is canonical, the rotational and translational cues in the object observation must be filtered out, while only the shape information should be preserved. To achieve this, we introduce a Pose-Irrelevant Module (PIM) so as to learn canonical-related features only.\nSecond, inspired by 8, we take a learned shape prior as an input of our network, in addition to the RGB and depth images. We hypothesize that the relational information between these three sources of information is important for high-quality reconstruction. Therefore, a Relational Reconstruction Module (RRM) is introduced to learn this relational information of the three inputs.\nFinally, utilizing the features learned from the RRM, the canonical representation can be reconstructed using a Shape Prior Deformation step 8. Afterwards, 6D object pose can be easily solved by aligning the canonical representation with the back-projected object depth using the Umeyama algorithm 0. Furthermore, we find that the reconstruction results could be unrealistic in some cases, which may cause inaccurate alignment results. To resolve this issue, we adopt the idea of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)   in our pipeline and propose to use a Discriminator to adversarially guide the Reconstructor, making it more creative so that it can produce more realistic canonical representations. As a result, experiments on the NOCS-CAMERA and NOCS-REAL datasets show that our ACR-Pose can achieve state-of-the-art performance in both synthetic and real scenarios. To summarize, our contributions are: 1) We propose ACR-Pose, an Adversarial Canonical Representation Reconstruction Network, for learning high-quality canonical representations trained in an adversarial manner. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce adversarial training for category-level 6D object pose estimation. 2) We propose a Pose-Irrelevant Module and a Relational Reconstruction Module to form the ACR-Pose’s Reconstructor, through which high-quality canonical-related features and relational features are effectively learned for credible reconstruction. 3) We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our model and compare it with previous works, where our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real world datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: canonical representation refers to a normalized 3D model that integrates a category of objects’ most representative characteristics, independent of the object’s pose, such as the NOCS 3 and the CASS [ref]5 representation.
