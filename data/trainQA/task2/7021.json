      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Network-Based Rule Models With Truth Tables\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been widely and successfully employed in various machine learning tasks, but concerns regarding their security and trustworthiness persist. One of the primary issues associated with DNNs, as well as ensemble ML models in general, is their lack of explainability and the challenge of incorporating human knowledge into them due to their inherent complexity¬† . Therefore, there is a significant research focus on achieving global and exact interpretability for these systems, especially in safety-critical applications ¬† [ref]20. In contrast, rule-based models¬†, including tree-based models¬†, are specifically designed to offer global and exact explanations, providing insights into the decision-making process that yields the same output as the model. However, they generally exhibit lower performance compared to other models like DNNs or ensemble ML model¬†. Additionally, they encounter scalability issues when dealing with large datasets and lack flexibility in addressing various types of tasks, often limited to binary classification¬†[ref]14. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no family of DNNs that possesses both global and exact interpretability akin to rule-based models, while also demonstrating scalability on real-life datasets without the need for an explainer. This limitation is significant since explainer methods often provide only local, inexact, and potentially misleading explanations¬†  3. This paper introduces a novel neural network framework that effectively combines the interpretability of rule-based models with the high performance of DNNs. Our framework, called TT-rules, builds upon the advancements made by Benamira et al.¬† and Agarwal et al.¬†. The latter proposed a neural network architecture that achieves interpretability by utilizing several DNNs, each processing a single continuous input feature, and a linear layer for merging them. The effectiveness of aggregating local features on image datasets to achieve high accuracy has been demonstrated by Brendel et al.¬†. Similarly, Agarwal et al.¬† showed that aggregating local features on tabular datasets can also yield high accuracy. Furthermore, Benamira et al.¬† introduced a new Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) filter function called the Learning Truth Table (LTT) block. The LTT block has the unique property of its complete distribution being computable in constant and practical time, regardless of the architecture. This allows the transformation of the LTT block from weights into an exact mathematical Boolean formula. Since an LTT block is equivalent to a CNN filter, the entire neural network model, known as Truth Table Net (TTnet), can itself be represented as a Boolean formula. To summarize, while Agarwal et al.¬† focused on continuous inputs, and Benamira et al.¬† focused on discrete inputs, our approach leverages the strengths of both works to achieve high accuracy while maintaining global and exact interpretability. To optimize the rule set ‚Ñõ‚Ñõ\\mathcal{R}, our TT-rules framework employs two post-training steps. Firstly, we automatically integrate ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Care Terms‚Äù (D‚ÄãC‚ÄãTùê∑ùê∂ùëáDCT), utilizing human logic, into the truth tables. This reduces the size of each rule in the set ‚Ñõ‚Ñõ\\mathcal{R}. Secondly, we introduce and analyze an inter-rule correlation score to decrease the number of rules in ‚Ñõ‚Ñõ\\mathcal{R}. These optimizations, specific to the TT-rules framework, automatically and efficiently transform the set ‚Ñõ‚Ñõ\\mathcal{R} into an optimized set ‚Ñõ‚Äão‚Äãp‚Äãt‚Ñõùëúùëùùë°\\mathcal{R}{opt} in constant time. We also quantify the trade-offs among performance, the number of rules, and their sizes. At this stage, we obtain a rule-based model from the trained DNN TTnet, which can be used for prediction by adding up the rules in ‚Ñõ‚Äão‚Äãp‚Äãt‚Ñõùëúùëùùë°\\mathcal{R}{opt} according to the binary or floating linear layer. To enhance the interpretability of the model, we convert all rule equations into Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams. A) The TT-rules framework demonstrates versatility and effectiveness across various tasks, including binary classification, multi-classification, and regression. A-1) Our experiments encompassed five machine learning datasets: Diabetes¬† in healthcare, Adult¬†, HELOC¬†[ref]1, and California Housing¬†4 in finance, and Compas¬† in the justice domain. The results clearly indicate that the TT-rules framework surpasses most interpretable models in terms of Area Under Curve/Root Mean Square Error (AUC/RMSE), including linear/logistic regression, decision trees, generalized linearized models, and neural additive models. A-2) On two datasets, the TT-rules framework performs comparably to XGBoost and DNN models. A-3) We conducted a comparative analysis of the performance-complexity tradeoff between our proposed TT-rules framework and other state-of-the-art rule-based models, such as generalized linearized models¬†7, RIPPER¬† , decision trees (DT)6, and ORS8, specifically focusing on binary classification tasks. Our findings demonstrate that the TT-rules framework outperforms all the aforementioned models, except for the generalized linearized models, in terms of the performance-complexity tradeoff. B) Scalability is a key strength of our model, enabling it to handle large datasets with tens of thousands of features, such as DNA datasets¬†4 7 3, which consist of over 20K features. Our model not only scales efficiently but also performs feature reduction, compressing the initial 20K features of the first DNA datasets¬†4 7 into 1K rules, and reducing the 23K features of the second DNA dataset¬†3 into 9K rules. C) A distinctive feature of our framework lies in its inherent global and exact interpretability. C-1) To showcase its effectiveness, we provide a concrete use case with the Adult dataset and thoroughly investigate its interpretability. C-2) We explore the potential for incorporating human knowledge into our framework. C-3) Additionally, we highlight how experts can leverage the rules to detect concept shifts, further emphasizing the interpretability aspect of our framework. This paper is structured as follows. Section¬†2 presents a comprehensive literature review on rule-based models. In Section¬†3, we establish the notations and fundamental concepts that will be utilized throughout the paper. Section¬†4 offers a detailed analysis of the TT-rules framework, exploring its intricacies and functionalities. In Section¬†5, we present the experimental results obtained and compare them with the current state-of-the-art approaches. Additionally, we showcase the scalability of our framework and illustrate its applicability through a compelling case study. The limitations of the proposed approach are discussed in Section¬†6, followed by the concluding remarks in Section¬†7.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: due to their inherent complexity¬† .
