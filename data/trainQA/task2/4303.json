      "content": "Paper Title: Open- and Closed-Loop Neural Network Verification using Polynomial Zonotopes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe first summarize the state of the art for open-loop neural network verification followed by reachability analysis for neural network controlled systems. Many different set representations have been proposed for computing enclosures of the image through a neural network, including intervals , polytopes , zonotopes , star sets [ref]40, and Taylor models . For neural networks with ReLU activation functions, it is possible to compute the exact image. This can be either achieved by recursively partitioning the input set into piecewise affine regions , or by propagating the initial set through the network using polytopes   or star sets [ref]40, where the set is split at all neurons that are both active or inactive. In either case the exact image is in the worst case given as a union of 2vsuperscript2ùë£2^{v} convex sets, with vùë£v being the number of neurons in the network. To avoid this high computational complexity for exact image computation, most approaches compute a tight enclosure instead using an abstraction of the neural network. For ReLU activation functions one commonly used abstraction is the triangle relaxation  (see Fig.¬†1), which can be conveniently integrated into set propagation using star sets [ref]40. Another possibility is to abstract the input-output relation by a zonotope (see Fig.¬†1), which is possible for ReLU, sigmoid, and hyperbolic tangent activation functions . One can also apply Taylor model arithmetic  to compute the image through networks with sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent activation , which corresponds to an abstraction of the input-output relation by a Taylor series expansion. In order to better capture dependencies between different neurons, some approaches also abstract the input-output relation of multiple neurons at once  . While computation of the exact image is infeasible for large networks, the enclosures obtained by abstractions are often too conservative for verification. To obtain complete verifiers, many approaches therefore use branch and bound strategies  that split the input set and/or single neurons until the specification can either be proven or a counterexample is found. For computational reasons branch and bound strategies are usually combined with approaches that are able to compute rough interval bounds for the neural network output very fast. Those bounds can for example be obtained using symbolic intervals  that store linear constraints on the variables in addition to the interval bounds to preserve dependencies. The DeepPoly approach  uses a similar concept, but applies a back-substitution scheme to obtain tighter bounds. With the FastLin method  linear bounds for the overall network can be computed from linear bounds for the single neurons. The CROWN approach  extends this concept to linear bounds with different slopes as well as quadratic bounds. Several additional improvements for the CROWN approach have been proposed, including slope optimization using gradient descent  and efficient ReLU splitting . Instead of explicitly computing the image, many approaches also aim to verify the specification directly using SMT solvers  , mixed-integer linear programming  , semidefinite programming , and convex optimization . For reachability analysis of neural network controlled systems one has to compute the set of control inputs in each control cycle, which is the image of the current reachable set through the neural network controller. Early approaches compute the image for ReLU networks exactly using polytopes  or star sets . Since in this case the number of coexisting sets grows rapidly over time, these approaches have to unite sets using convex hulls  or interval enclosures , which often results in large over-approximations. If template polyhedra are used as a set representation, reachability analysis for neural network controlled systems with discrete-time plants reduces to the task of computing the maximum output along the template directions , which can be done efficiently. Neural network controllers with sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent activation functions can be converted to an equivalent hybrid automaton , which can be combined with the dynamics of the plant using the automaton product. However, since each neuron is represented by an additional state, the resulting hybrid automaton is very high-dimensional, which makes reachability analysis challenging. Some approaches approximate the overall network with a polynomial function [ref]14 [ref]18 using polynomial regression based on samples [ref]14 and Bernstein polynomials [ref]18. Yet another class of methods     employs abstractions of the input-output relation for the neurons to compute the set of control inputs using intervals , star sets , Taylor models, and a combination of zonotopes and Taylor models. Common tools for reachability analysis of neural network controlled systems are JuliaReach , NNV , POLAR , ReachNN* , RINO , Sherlock , Verisig , and Verisig 2.0 , where JuliaReach uses zonotopes for neural network abstraction , NVV supports multiple set representations, ReachNN* applies the Bernstein polynomial method [ref]18, POLAR approximates single neurons by Bernstein polynomials , RINO computes interval inner- and outer-approximations , Sherlock uses the polynomial regression approach [ref]14, Verisig performs the conversion to a hybrid automaton , and Verisig 2.0 uses the Taylor model based neural network abstraction method .\n\nReference markers found: [40]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]40: controlled systems.
