      "content": "Paper Title: End-to-end AI Framework for Interpretable Prediction of Molecular and Crystal Properties\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the explosion of AI models [ref]1 [ref]2 [ref]3   developed to predict various material properties\nover the recent years, it has become difficult to keep track of\nthe available AI models and the datasets that are used for training\nand inference.\nNumerous efforts   have\nbeen made toward the integration of AI models and\ntheir associated datasets in one place to streamline\ntheir use for a wide range of applications and a broad community of\nusers   .\nAI models and datasets are often\navailable through open repositories, in the best scenario,\nso a user can download, deploy and reproduce\ntheir putative capabilities. Unfortunately, this is a time-consuming\nand laborious process, which can be further complicated when tools and\nlibraries used to develop the AI models are\nnot available, deprecated, or non-backwards compatible\nin computing environments of new users.\nFurthermore, most of the existing packages are specialized in predicting quantum mechanical properties of small molecules, few of them support crystals. In order to address these shortcomings,\nhere we report the construction\nof a computational framework that\nconsolidates libraries, AI models\nand AI interpretability tools to study\nmolecules, crystals, and metal-organic frameworks.\nThe framework enables hyperparameter tuning\nthrough the open source library\nDeepHyper ,\nmodel training, and interpretable inference of\nsmall-molecule quantum mechanics (QM) properties from\npublic datasets such as\nQM9 ,\nand crystal properties from datasets such as\nhMOF .\nKey aspects of this computational framework include: Novel features of AI models. The node and\nedge embedding schemes of two graph neural\nnetwork models, PhysNet [ref]2 and CGCNN ,\nwere modified from\nthe original adjacency matrix format to an adjacency list format to reduce redundant information and enable faster\ntraining. We also adapted small-molecule\nproperty prediction models to take in crystal structures\nas input such as the crystal version of SchNet [ref]1. Transferable AI applications.\nWe demonstrate the transferability of the learned force\nfields by training TorchMD-NET [ref]3 model using selected molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory data of a given set of molecules in the\nMD17 dataset  to\nperform MD simulations of similar molecules. In particular, we show that a model\ntrained based on ethanol is transferable to both n-propanol and\niso-propanol, and a model trained based on uracil is transferable\nto pyrimidine and naphthalene. All of the results are\nautomatically logged to weights and\nbiases (WandB) , a machine learning\ntracking tool, for simple access. Interpretable AI inference.\nIntrepretation methods provide a novel pathway to deepen the understanding of the structure-property relationships of materials. Previous work   has shown great success in applying interpretation methods to identify key functional groups in molecules that contribute to toxicity, including Excitation Backpropagation , CAM  and Grad-CAM  and Contrastive gradient . Moreover, The UMAP method has also been applied to effectively visualize the distribution shift of sampled molecules on a 2D plane with and without transfer learning . To gain a better understanding of model predictions, we provide two interpretation methods to explain the learned features. The first method, Grad-CAM, highlights selected atoms of molecules that are significant for model predictions.\nThe second method, uniform manifold approximation and projection , or UMAP, maps the last hidden layer of the model onto a 3D plane. In this way, we can make more sense of the molecular clusters with similar properties. This AI suite and scientific software are released\nwith this manuscript, and may be found in GitLab . To facilitate the use\nof these resources, we have prepared Jupyter notebooks in\nGoogle Colab , which have been\ntested independently by researchers not involved in this\nwork to ensure that these resources are easy to\nfollow and use. To ensure that all the resources used\nin this article are self-contained, we have also\npublished the datasets used for these studies in\nZenodo .\nWe expect that this collection of\nstate-of-the-art graph\nneural networks, transformer models,\nand analysis methods for small molecules and crystals will empower AI practitioners\nto seamlessly perform hyperparameter optimization,\naccelerated training, and\ninterpretable AI inference in modern computing environments with a unified, standalone computational framework.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: With the explosion of AI models [ref]1 [ref]2 [ref]3   developed to predict various material properties\nover the recent years, it has become difficult to keep track of\nthe available AI models and the datasets that are used for\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
