Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: On the Visualisation of Argumentation Graphs to Support Text Interpretation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nArgument mining (AM) is a technique in text mining  that involves two main stages: identifying argument discourse and predicting argument relationships  6. AM can be done fully automated (        , TARGER, MARGOT ARGs, or ConToVi [ref]37) or as a hybrid of manual and automated methods ( ). However, it lacks standardization  and full automation lacks accuracy due to its insufficient incorporation of semantics and domain knowledge. Consequently, experts currently rely on time-consuming manual annotations . This study aims to refine Walton’s classification schemes  to analyze debate topics from “ProCon.org”  using the BRAT annotation tool  and the VIANA framework, with a focus on enhancing textual interpretation in argument mining.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: in text mining  that involves two main stages: identifying argument discourse and predicting argument relationships  6.

However, it lacks standardization  and full automation lacks accuracy due to its insufficient incorporation of semantics and domain\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
