      "content": "Paper Title: Cheetah: Bridging the Gap Between Machine Learning and Particle Accelerator Physics with High-Speed, Differentiable Simulations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFuture particle accelerator experiments will place ever-increasing demands on the performance and capabilities of particle accelerator operations and experiment analysis.\nIn order to meet these demands, the research community is increasingly turning to  machine learning (ML) methods, which have already demonstrated their ability to push the envelope of what is possible in the field of accelerator science [ref]1 [ref]2 [ref]3 . One of the remaining challenges holding back this line of research is the demand for large amounts of data (including environment interactions) of these methods.\n\\AcfRL, for example, has already successfully been used to train intelligent tuning algorithms and controllers that can outperform the currently deployed black-box optimisation algorithms and handcrafted controllers [ref]1   .\nHowever,  reinforcement learning (RL) methods require many interactions with their target task to train a well-performing policy.\nFor example, 6 000 00060000006\\,000\\,000 samples were needed in [ref]1 to successfully train a policy on a transverse beam tuning task.\nOrders of magnitude larger number of samples are also common with other RL applications  .\nThe general scarcity of beam time makes collecting experimental data for ML methods, such as RL, a significant bottleneck.\nGathering at least partial data sets in simulation can alleviate this problem, but existing accelerator simulation codes have mostly been developed with a focus on the design phase of accelerators, where high-fidelity and physical correctness are critical, and computing times range from minutes to several hours for one simulation.\nConsequently, data collection with existing simulation codes becomes impractical with the growing demand for large data sets.\nIn this paper, we introduce Cheetah, a PyTorch-based high-speed differentiable linear-beam dynamics code. Cheetah is capable of accelerating beam dynamics simulations by multiple orders of magnitude through tensorised computation and several speed optimisation methods.\nIn the specific example of [ref]1, this equates to a reduction in RL training time from over 121212 days when using the Ocelot simulation code  to just over 111 hour when using Cheetah. At the same time, numerical optimisation is fast becoming an important tool for accelerator design, tuning, and model calibration  .\nAdvanced numerical optimisation methods like  Bayesian optimisation (BO) have been used to achieve impressive results . However, demands to solve optimisation problems of increasing dimensionality are growing, and BO may struggle to efficiently optimise objective functions with more than a few dozen degrees of freedom .\nIn the field of ML, gradient-based optimisation has successfully been used to optimise up to 707070 billion parameters  .\nHowever, computing gradients of complex models, like beam dynamics, using numerical or analytical methods are computationally expensive. Instead, automatic differentiation has found widespread adoption in machine learning for the fast computation of gradients.\n\\AcML frameworks, such as PyTorch  and JAX , allow convenient and computationally cheap automatic differentiation to calculate the partial derivatives up to arbitrary orders for all the parameters using the chain rule.\nBecause Cheetah is constructed upon PyTorch, it provides built-in support for automatic differentiation to efficiently compute the gradients of the beam dynamics models it implements.\nHence, Cheetah makes optimisation over the large parameter spaces of accelerator facilities tractable beyond the number of parameters that can feasibly be optimised with the current state-of-the-art numerical optimisers. Surrogate modelling of start-to-end accelerator systems utilising neural networks is another active area of research  [ref]2 [ref]3. Such surrogate models can be used to acquire offline models of processes in accelerator facilities or as a fast and differentiable stand-in for computationally expensive simulations.\nNevertheless, NN are usually trained on start-to-end data, taking actuators as inputs and sensor values as output. This makes it difficult to reuse trained models for applications beyond those intended at the time of training.\nMoreover, NN surrogate models are not commonly designed to interface with beam dynamics simulators.\nConveniently, Cheetah is implemented using PyTorch, which is first and foremost an ML framework. As a result, models implemented in Cheetah can be readily integrated with NN surrogate models. This also means that gradient propagation from NN surrogate models through Cheetah and vice versa works out-of-the-box.\nWith Cheetah, it is therefore possible to combine modular NN surrogate models with physical beam dynamics simulations.\nIn particular, Cheetah provides a practical platform for integrating modular NN surrogate models with handcrafted beam dynamics models, making the expensive-to-train surrogate models more reusable. In the following, we introduce Cheetah and its inner workings in Section II, benchmarking its speed in Section II.4. In the second half of this paper, we present five different application examples (also shown in context in Fig. 1), taking advantage of Cheetah’s speed for reinforcement learning in Section III.1, and using its differentiability for beam tuning in Section III.2 and system identification in Section III.3, followed by an example using Cheetah as a BO prior in Section III.4, and demonstrating how Cheetah may host modular NN surrogate models in Section III.5.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: community is increasingly turning to  machine learning (ML) methods, which have already demonstrated their ability to push the envelope of what is possible in the field of accelerator science [ref]1 [ref]2 [ref]3 .
