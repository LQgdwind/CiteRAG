      "content": "Paper Title: The Relational Quotient Completion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nQuotients are pervasive both in mathematic and computer science, as they are crucial in carrying out many fundamental arguments. Quotients have been widely studied and several constructions have been refined to allow one to work with quotients even though they are not natively available in the setting in which one is reasoning (such as within a type theory, where usually quotients are not a primitive concept).\nThe intuition behind these constructions is that\ntaking a quotient changes the notion of equality on an object to a given equivalence relation.\nThen, to work with (formal) quotients, one just endows\neach object (set, type, space, …\\ldots) with an (abstract) equivalence relation and forces the object to “believe” that that equivalence relation is the equality.\nThis idea underlies the construction of setoids in type theories  , which are the common solution to work with quotients in that setting and\nunderlies also the exact completion of a category with weak finite limits  ,\nas well as the elementary quotient completion of an elementary doctrine  . Following the approach pioneered by Lawvere ,\nwe can regard distances as a quantitative counterpart of equivalence relations:\nthey measure how much two elements are similar instead of just saying whether they are equivalent or not.\nIndeed, a distance on a set XX is just a function\nd:X×X→[0,∞]{{d}}:{{X\\times X}}\\rightarrow{{[0,\\infty]}} taking values in the extended non-negative real numbers,\nwhich satisfies a form of reflexivity (every point is at distance 0 from itself),\nsymmetry (the distance from xx to yy is the same as the one from yy to xx) and\ntransitivity (which is given by the triangular inequality).\nIn this way, a metric space can be viewed as a form of quantitative setoid and\nquotients can be understood quantitatively as a change of distance.\nIn fact, this operation is often used when dealing with metric structures, see for instance the construction of monads associated with quantitative equational theories  [ref]9 0. A unified view of quotients covering both usual and quantitative settings is missing. The aim of this paper is to develop a notion of quotient, related concepts and constructions extending known results and incorporating new quantitative examples. Many mathematical tools have been adopted to study quotients.\nAmong them, Lawvere’s doctrines 1 2 stand out as a simple and powerful framework capable to cope with a large variety of situations (see 3 4 5 and references therein). Doctrines provide a functorial description of logical theories,\nabstracting the essential algebraic structure shared by both syntax and semantics of logics.\nIn particular, Maietti and Rosolini   identified doctrines modelling the conjunctive fragment of first order logic with equality as the minimal setting where to define equivalence relations and quotients. Then they defined a universal construction, named elementary quotient completion, that freely adds quotients to such doctrines, showing that it subsumes many others, such as setoids and the exact completion of a category with finite limits. In order to move this machinery to a quantitative setting,\none may try to work with doctrines where the usual conjunction is replaced by its linear counterpart.\nIn this way, equivalence relations becomes distances as transitivity becomes a triangular inequality.\nHowever smooth, this transition is less innocent than it appears.\nAs shown in 6, to properly deal with a quantitative notion of equality one needs a more sophisticated structure, which however fails to capture important examples like the category of metric spaces and non-expansive maps.\nThe main difficulty in working with Lawvere’s doctrines is that doctrines, modelling usual predicate logic, take care of variables. This is problematic in a quantitative setting as the use of variables usually has an impact on the considered distances. For these reasons, in this paper we take a different approach: we work with doctrines abstracting the calculus of relations 7 8 9 which is a variable-free alternative to first order logic. Here one takes as primitive concept (binary) relations instead of (unary) predicates, together with some basic operations, such as relational identities, composition and the converse of a relation.\nEven though in general it is less expressive than first order logic,111The calculus of relations is equivalent to first order logic with three variables 0.\nit is still quite expressive, for instance, one can axiomatise set theory in it 1.\nMoreover, being variable-free, it scales well to quantitative settings, as witnessed by the fruitful adoption of relational techniques to develop quantitative methods 2 3 4. Then, in this paper, we introduce relational doctrines,\nas a functorial description of a core fragment of the calculus of relations.\nRelying on this structure, we define a notion of quotient capable to deal with also quantitative settings. We present a universal construction to add such quotients to any relational doctrine. The construction extends the one in   and can also capture quantitative instances such as the category of metric spaces and non-expansive maps. Furthermore, related to quotients, we study the notion of extensional equality.\nRoughly, two functions or morphisms are extensionally equal if their outputs coincide on equal inputs. Even if quotients and extensionality are independent concepts, several known constructions that add quotients often force extensionality (see e.g., Bishop’s sets, setoids over a type theory or the exact completion). Therefore the study of extensionality is essential to cover these well-known examples. We show that our quotient completion, changing the notion of equality on objects without affecting plain equality on arrows in the base category, may break this property.\nThus, we define another universal construction that forces extensionality and use it to obtain an extensional version of our quotient completion.\nWe show also how this logical principle captures many notions of separation in metric and topological structures. These results are developed using the language of 2-categories 5.\nTo this end, we organise relational doctrines in a suitable 2-category where morphisms abstract the usual notion of relation lifting 6.\nThe universality of our constructions is then expressed in terms of (lax) 2-adjunctions 7, thus describing their action not only on relational doctrines, but on their morphisms as well.\nWe also prove that these constructions are 2-monadic 8, showing that quotients and extensionality are algebraic concepts, that is, they can be described by (pseudo)algebra structures for certain 2-monads on a relational doctrine.\nFurthremore, we show that these algebra structures are essentially unique, proving that the associated 2-monads are (lax) idempotent 9 0.\nThis makes precise the fact that having quotients or being extensional is a property of a relational doctrine rather than a structure on it. Since many categorical concepts can be defined internally to any 2-category, we get them for free also for relational doctrines.\nFor instance, following 1, we can consider monads on relational doctrines and the associated doctrines of algebras where relations between two algebras are given by congruences, that is, relations closed under the operations of the algebras they relate.\nAs an application of our construction, we show that, under suitable hypotheses, these doctrines of algebras can be obtained as the extensional quotient completion of their restriction to free algebras, extending a similar result proved for the exact completion 2.\nTo achieve this result, we rely on a characterization of relational doctrines obtained through the extensional quotient completion as those doctrines where every object can be presented as a quotient of a projective one, again generalizing a similar result proved for the exact completion . The paper is organised as follows.\nIn Section 2 we introduce relational doctrines with their basic properties, presenting several examples.\nIn Section 3 we define quotients and the intensional quotient completion, proving it is universal and 2-monadic, generating a lax idempotent 2-monad.\nIn Section 4 we discuss extensionality, its connection with separation and the universal construction forcing it, proved again to be 2-monadic and to generate an idempotent 2-monad.\nIn Section 5, we combine these result to define the extensional quotient completion, showing it is universal, 2-monadic and generating a lax idempotent 2-monad.\nSection 6 provides the characterization of doctrines obtained through the extensional quotient completion and apply it to doctrines of algebras.\nIn Section 7 we compare our approach with two important classes of examples: ordered categories with involution 3, which are a generalisation of both allegories and cartesian bicategories, and existential elementary doctrines  , characterizing relational doctrines corresponding to them.\nFinally, Section 8 summarises our contributions and discusses directions for future work.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: as a change of distance.\nIn fact, this operation is often used when dealing with metric structures, see for instance the construction of monads associated with quantitative equational theories  [ref]9 0.
