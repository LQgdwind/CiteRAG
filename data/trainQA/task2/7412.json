      "content": "Paper Title: Multiple Instance Learning for Cheating Detection and Localization in Online Examinations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDue to the newly prevailed Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), online examinations have gradually become an indispensable means of assessing students’ knowledge standard . Many scholars and service providers are making efforts to ensure the equality of online examinations. How to detect cheating behaviors during examinations has become an issue of great concern. Video anomaly detection  [ref]3 [ref]4    generally refers to the process of identifying the event that significantly deviates from the normal behaviors. The detection and location of abnormal behaviors, such as stampedes, traffic accidents, or terrorist attacks, play an important role in the security and protection system. However, manual annotation is time-consuming when it comes to various abnormal events. Moreover, collecting anomalous datasets is a difficult task due to the rare occurrence of anomalous events in real life. Therefore, video anomaly detection is generally regarded as an unsupervised learning task in previous studies   0 1 2, which only utilizes normal training samples to learn the normal patterns. The process of abnormal behaviors detection is to identify the difference between the learned normal and abnormal behavior feature representations. Different from traditional anomaly detection tasks where cameras could provide a broad and full-scaled view, cheating detection has much more complicated and subtle challenges. In most online examinations, the examinees are asked to turn on their webcams and the examiners can only see a limited view, which is usually composed of the body above the chest and the surroundings around the examinees. Considering that the picture information provided by the webcam is very limited, and the seriousness of the misjudgment of cheating in different countries, the applicable scenarios of the algorithm need to be strictly regulated. To solve these problems, several models have been proposed to detect cheating behaviors from different perspectives. Recently, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) 0 3 has gradually become the main technique for anomaly detection tasks. It treats the video as a package, and uses the splitted clips of each video as an instance. Then, the model tries to find out the clips of abnormal events in the abnormal video. However, MIL can only locate anomalies in the temporal dimension, while ignoring other discriminative features. For example, face recognition technology 4 is used to grab the number of human faces in a certain time period through a webcam to determine whether there is an external assistant in the examination room. In addition, the object detection algorithm [ref]3 is also used to identify and analyze the existing items in the streaming media. With the help of the gaze estimation algorithm, 5, the examinee’s cheating behavior patterns can be identified by calculating the gaze range. In previous works 6 7 8 9 0, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has been used in anomaly detection because of its ability to effectively capture dependencies between clips. In the graph, clips are abstracted as vertices, and abnormal information is propagated through the edges. Further, feature similarity 6 and temporal consistency 7 1 are used as two features in GCN to clean the noise of the label. Feature similarity means that the abnormal clips have some similar features, while temporal consistency indicates that the abnormal clips may be close to each other in the time dimension. In real cheating scenarios, the candidate’s head and surrounding scenes tend to be abnormal for a specific short period of time, which means that the spatio-temporal features in the video are very important. Moreover, the ambiguous boundary between normal and abnormal data impedes the performance of unsupervised learning models. This work is dedicated to solving cheating problems in online closed-book test scenarios. In this type of exam scenario, scratch paper and calculators will be provided in the form of electronic tools, and candidates are not allowed to carry books, mobile phones, and other items without authorization. To solve the cheating problems in this scenario, we propose a method to capture anomalies in the video frames in a weakly supervised way. The videos are annotated as abnormal if it contains abnormal frames, while the temporal information is not provided. In this work, we apply the clip-level labels generated by multi-instance learning as the supervision of the feature encoder. On this basis, multi-modal features are obtained by fusing GAP features 2, body pose, and background features for cheating behavior detection. To take advantage of spatio-temporal dependencies between multi-modal features, we introduce a spatio-temporal graph module with temporal consistency and feature similarity. Specifically, we extract the C3D/I3D features from the feature extractor and put them into the label generator. The generator based on MIL can produce clip-level labels for the feature encoder training. In the second stage, through these labels and their corresponding video information, we acquire multi-modal features with the help of openface 2.0 and train our feature encoder with spatio-temporal graph module for learning discriminative features (as shown in Figure 1). To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to use a MIL-based approach and comprehensively consider multi-modal features such as facial appearance, head posture, and gaze angle to detect cheating behaviors.\nThe contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: We propose a novel weakly supervised framework for cheating behaviors detection combined with multi-modal features for graph learning. We introduce the spatio-temporal graph module to capture the spatio-temporal relationship between clips and propagate the supervision signal, in which the stitched features are comprehensively taken into account. We conduct experiments on three different anomaly detection datasets including an online examination monitoring dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The related works are discussed in Section II. Section III defines the problem of video anomaly detection. Section IV presents the overall framework of the proposed model and describes the design of each module. The comparative and ablation experiments results will be discussed in Section V and followed by the conclusion in Section VI.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: providers are making efforts to ensure the equality of online examinations.
