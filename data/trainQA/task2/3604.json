      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to Generate Synthetic Training Data using Gradient Matching and Implicit Differentiation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn machine learning, the purpose of data distillation  is to compress the original dataset while maintaining the performance of the models trained on it. Generalizability is also needed: the ability of the dataset to train models of architectures that were not involved in the distillation process. Since training with less data is usually faster, distillation can be useful in practice. For example, it can be used to speed up a neural architecture search (NAS) task. Acceleration is achieved through the faster training of candidates. In many recent works , [ref]3, [ref]5, , , distillation is formulated as an optimization problem with the objects of a new dataset as parameters for optimization. Therefore, to distill the dataset for an image classification task, pixels of images have to be optimized. First, all new objects are initialized with random noise, then these objects are used to train the student (randomly selected network). Then the student misclassification loss is calculated on real data. Finally, a gradient descent step is used to update the synthetic objects. Gradients can be calculated by backpropagating the error through the entire student’s learning process. The step of this procedure can be very time-consuming and memory-intensive, so there is a need for an alternative. In [ref]2, the authors use the implicit function theorem to solve the memory consumption problem. In [ref]3, the data distillation problem has been reformulated to use gradient matching loss and speed up the optimization of synthetic objects and reduce memory usage. There is an alternative to optimizing the pixels of synthetic data. In , the authors suggest to optimize parameters of the generator model (generative teaching network or GTN) to produce synthetic data from noise and labels. This creates a dataset that provides better performance for models trained with it. The disadvantage is that the authors used backpropagation through the learning process for optimization. Inspired by recent ideas in the field of data distillation, we propose replacing it with gradient matching or with implicit differentiation to make the procedure less computationally expensive. We have found that this allows not only to reduce memory costs but also to create more efficient and generalizable datasets. In addition, we investigate the use of augmentation in the distillation procedure and in models’ learning on distilled data. The rest of the paper is divided into 8 sections. We first overview the related work in section II and give a general formulation of the data distillation problem in III. We then analyse the first data distillation algorithm  and discuss its problems in section IV. A brief description of the algorithms for implicit differentiation [ref]2 and gradient matching [ref]3 can be found in sections V and VI. VII presents the generative teaching network architecture that we use in our work. The VIII section contains the results of experiments with the MNIST image classification benchmark. In VIII-A we compare the results of all the described distillation methods, limiting the distillation time to a constant. In VIII-B and VIII-C we show results of new distillation techniques when training a generator with gradient matching and implicit differentiation, respectively. In VIII-D we study the use of augmentation by distillation, and in VIII-E we check the generalization of the data obtained with the new methods. Finally, we present our findings in section IX.
