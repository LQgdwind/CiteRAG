One of the\nmost well-known parameter-free type-II algorithms is the proximal\ngradient descent (PGD) method with backtracking line search. In ,\nit was shown that this method has a 𝒪​(ε−2)𝒪superscript𝜀2{\\cal O}(\\varepsilon^{-2})\ntype-II complexity bound when f𝑓f is weakly-convex and a suboptimal\n𝒪​(ε−1)𝒪superscript𝜀1{\\cal O}(\\varepsilon^{-1}) type-II bound when f𝑓f is convex. One of the earliest accelerated type-II methods is found in\n under the assumption that domhdomℎ\\operatorname*{dom}h\nis bounded. Following this, paper [ref]13 presented\na parameter-free extension of the method in \nthat handles Hölder continuous gradients of f𝑓f. In a separate line\nof research,  presented a type-II accelerated\nmethod whose main steps are variants of the (accelerated) FISTA algorithm\nin [ref]5 and assumes domhdomℎ\\operatorname*{dom}h is bounded. A variant\nof this method, with improved iteration complexity bounds in the convex\nsetting, was examined in . It is worth noting\nthat some of the methods in  [ref]13  \nhave optimal type-I bounds when f𝑓f is convex but all the\nmethods have suboptimal type-II bounds even when f𝑓f is convex. Motivated by the developments in , other\npapers, e.g.,    ,\ndeveloped similar accelerated methods under different assumptions\non f𝑓f and hℎh. Recently,  proposed a\nparameter-dependent accelerated inexact proximal point (AIPP) method\nthat has an optimal iteration complexity bound of 𝒪​(M​m​Δ0/ε2)𝒪𝑀𝑚subscriptΔ0superscript𝜀2{\\cal O}(\\sqrt{Mm}\\Delta_{0}/\\varepsilon^{2})\nwhen f𝑓f is weakly convex but has no advantage when f𝑓f is convex.\nThe work in  proposed an adaptive version\nof AIPP where (m,M)𝑚𝑀(m,M) were estimated locally, but a lower bound for\nmax⁡{m,M}𝑚𝑀\\max\\{m,M\\} was still required. A version of \nin which the outer proximal point scheme is replaced with an accelerated\none was examined in , in which a moderately\nworse iteration-complexity bound was established.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: type-II bound when f𝑓f is convex.
