      "content": "Paper Title: Visual Explanation of Black-Box Model : Similarity Difference and Uniqueness (SIDU) Method\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor an end-user, visual explanation methods makes it easier to understand the prediction output of the black-box model. One common approach to generate such a visualization is done via saliency maps   and such algorithms may be divided into the following three categories:’back-propagation based’ methods, ’perturbation-based’ methods and ’approximation-based’ methods. Back-propagation methods: back-propagation methods spread a feature signal from an output neuron rearwards through the layers of a model to the input in a single pass; making them efficient. ’Layer wise Relevance Propagation’  and ’DeCovNet’ [ref]19 are examples of this category. Network weights and feature activation map of CNN model at a specific layer, e.g., CNN’s last layer, are considered as an effective saliency method for generating visual explanation. Class Activation Mapping (CAM) that visually highlights the discriminative region of the image class prediction is an example of this family. In addition, the gradient or its modified version in the back-propagation algorithm can be employed to visualize the derivative of the CNN’s output w.r.t. to its input, e.g. such as Grad-CAM [ref]11. An improved method to produce input images that effectively activate a neuron was proposed in [ref]21. The method explored in this related work was focused upon generating class-specific saliency maps by performing a gradient ascent in pixel space to reach a maxima. This synthesized image served as a class-specific visualization that augmented comprehension of how a given CNN modeled a class. Perturbation-based methods: here, the input is perturbed while keeping track of the resultant changes to the output. In some work, the change occurs at intermediate layers of the model. The state-of-the-art RISE  algorithm belongs to this category. Meaningful perturbations  optimized a spatial perturbation mask that maximally effects a model’s output to reveal a new image saliency model that sought to identify where an algorithm searches by finding out which regions of an image most affected its output level when perturbed. Approximation-based method:\nMethods of this class attempt to provide explanation to a complex black-box model by utilizing an easier-to-understand and more interpretable model such as decision trees or linear regression.\nApart from these simple models, a good example class that is widely applied to visual input is the LIME algorithm . The main idea behind this related approach was to sample single visual input (i.e., image patches), correlate to the predictor model and subsequently identify its contribution toward the output class. The prediction results of each sample patch of the single image were then weighted with respect to the highest class score respectively. Finally, these weightings were used to train a simple surrogate model that was used as a local explanation for the result of the complex\nmodel. Furthermore, another related work titled DeepLift  evaluated the importance of each input neuron for a particular decision by approximating the instantaneous gradients (of the output with respect to the inputs) with discrete gradients. This obviated the need to train\ninterpretable classifiers for explaining each input-output relationship (as in LIME) for every test point.Inspired by the CAM method under the back-propagation based visual saliency approach, our proposed visual explanation, SIDU  utilized ’Similarity Difference’ and ’Uniqueness’ measures to score the importance of associated activation maps from the last convolution layer of a CNN model. The proposed visual explanation algorithm is a gradient-free method that can effectively localize an entire salient region of the object of interest compared to the state-of-the-art XAI methods such as Grad-CAM and RISE.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: methods spread a feature signal from an output neuron rearwards through the layers of a model to the input in a single pass; making them efficient. ’Layer wise Relevance Propagation’  and ’DeCovNet’ [ref]19 are examples of this category.
