      "content": "Paper Title: Clearing Financial Networks with Derivatives: From Intractability to Algorithms\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHow does the collapse of an established financial institution affect the stability of a financial market? Can a bank‚Äôs exposure to such a contagion risk be efficiently measured by clearing authorities? What factors should legislatures consider when formulating economic policies? These are just some exemplar questions that are paramount to the study of systemic risk in finance. In this context, financial networks have emerged as the framework of reference. These networks are modelled as graphs whose nodes represent financial institutions (such as banks) and edges represent active economic commitment between nodes. The central computational challenge for financial networks, that underpins many, if not all, the questions considered in the literature in this area, is the clearing problem. This amounts to computing the percentage of the liabilities that each bank should pay if the system had to be cleared at once ‚Äì intuitively, the smaller the ratio, the more exposed the bank is to systemic risk due to defaults in the network. In the literature, this ratio is referred to as the ‚Äúclearing recovery rate.‚Äù The finance industry is infamous for its inventiveness in coming up with hedging and/or lucrative new instruments that derive their value from underlying assets. Chief amongst these derivative contracts is the so-called Credit Default Swap (CDS) for which the value of the underlying asset is based upon the recovery rate of a third institution, called reference bank. Originally conceived to protect the creditor from potential default of its debtor, CDSes have been increasingly used as speculative contracts to wager about the solvency of other institutions. They attracted the interest of regulators both in the US and the EU being amongst the causes of the Great Financial Crisis of 2007 and the European sovereign debt crisis of 2011. The picture for the computational complexity of the clearing problem is less clean when CDSes enter the frame. In their seminal work Eisenberg and Noe [EN01], establish the mathematical formulation of the clearing problem. Their approach, which constitutes the baseline of research in this area, initiates the study of the problem from a fixed point computation perspective. The upshot of their work, is that clearing recovery rates correspond to fixed points of a certain function fùëìf, whenever the liabilities are simple contracts requiring the payment of a certain value (known as notional) unconditionally. More importantly, they provide a polynomial time algorithm for computing the clearing recovery rate vectors in case of networks with simple debt contracts. Despite the solid foundational base of this work in the financial literature, the reality that emerges from the presence of credit default swaps cannot be captured. The addition of credit default swaps to the model is attributed to Schuldenzucker, Seuken and Battinston [SSB16]. The authors present a graph-like model for financial networks that contain simple debt and CDS contracts. Similarly, the clearing problem takes the form of a fixed point computation over a more complex function fùëìf that always admits fixed points. The main observation for the new model on top of its involved combinatorial structure, is the numerical irrationality of the clearing recovery rates; a combination that constitutes the exact solution of the problem out of reach. To correctly define the computational question in this case, one then needs to resort to a notion of approximation. Proposed approximation notions in the literature involve the computation of either a ‚Äòweak‚Äô (almost) fixed point xùë•x such that |x‚àíf‚Äã(x)|<œµùë•ùëìùë•italic-œµ|x-f(x)|<\\epsilon along all dimensions or a ‚Äòstrong‚Äô (near) fixed point yùë¶y satisfying |y‚àíz|<œµùë¶ùëßitalic-œµ|y-z|<\\epsilon where zùëßz is such that z=f‚Äã(z)ùëßùëìùëßz=f(z) (that is, zùëßz is a fixed point). Both versions can be appealing for systemic risk in financial networks and have been considered in the literature: Ioannidis, de Keijzer and Ventre showed that the exact version of the clearing problem involving CDSes is FIXP-complete, which immediately yields FIXPa-completeness for strong approximations whenever the banks pay proportionally or by prioritising debts [IDKV22b, IDKV22a]. In [SSB17] it is proved that there a exit a constant œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon, for which computing weak approximations within this constant is PPAD-complete, whenever the banks pay proportionally. The authors construct a reduction from the\nœµitalic-œµ\\epsilon-Generalised-Circuit problem proved by Rubinstein to be PPAD-hard for some constant œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon [Rub15]. This statement excludes the possibility of constructing a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS). Contribution.\nIn this paper we want to understand whether there are values of œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon for which computing a suitable approximation of the clearing recovery rates can be done in polynomial time. In particular, we are interested in the intractability of the problem; for which values of œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon do the hardness results carry over? We study weak approximations and establish the following result. Main Theorem 1 (informal). Computing œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon-weak approximations of clearing recovery rates is PPAD-hard for œµ‚â§3‚àí516‚âà0.048italic-œµ35160.048\\epsilon\\leq\\frac{3-\\sqrt{5}}{16}\\approx 0.048. We exploit the connection of the clearing problem to the PPAD complexity class, along with the recent advancements in the area of total function search problems TFNP, regarding constant inapproximability. Our proof leverages Pure-Circuit ‚Äì a toolkit introduced by Deligkas, Fearnley, Hollender and Melissourgos [DFHM22] ‚Äì for showing constant inapproximability in PPAD. The problem features a set of variables which can take one of three different values 0, 1 or garbage and a circuit constructed from connecting gates of the following three types: NOT, OR and PURIFY. The first two basically follow boolean logic whereas the PURIFY gate has one input and two outputs and makes sure to duplicate the pure bit in input or produce at least one pure bit in output if the input is garbage. The main result of [DFHM22] is that Pure-Circuit is PPAD-complete. We construct a direct reduction from Pure-Circuit to the clearing problem. The proof is technically involved and can be divided in the following parts: (i) A ‚Äúhypothetical‚Äù encoding of the recovery rate space [ref]0 [ref]0  into three disjoint subintervals that intuitively map recovery rates to either a pure bit or garbage. (ii) The construction of three ‚Äúfinancial gates‚Äù whose behaviour under weak approximate clearing vectors must simulate the function of Pure-Circuit gates after decoding the recovery rates of specific banks. (iii) A reverse engineering process that fixes the initial encoding for the recovery rate values and results in the final specified constant œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon. Here we note two things. The proposed reduction is optimal, in the sense that it generates a family of possible encodings for the recovery rate values, upon which we choose the one that maximises the inapproximability parameter œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon. The intricate structure of the proposed networks combined with the restriction of computations to intervals within the [ref]0 [ref]0  range, significantly increases the complexity of the analysis. To bypass this obstacle we define a first-order language denoted as L‚Äã(R,F,C)ùêøRFCL(\\text{R},\\text{F},\\text{C}), designed to handle combined arithmetic operations involving intervals and numbers within the range [ref]0 [ref]0 . This is a basic tool in our analysis since it combines concise representations with a high level of expressiveness.\nThe upshot is that if we were able to approximate the clearing problem better than (roughly) 0.0480.0480.048 then the encoding would guarantee that we could solve Pure-Circuit. In the second part we evaluate the effectiveness of policies introduced in the wake of the aforementioned crises, the introduction of Central CDS Debtors (CCDs), a construct reminiscent of a central clearing counterparty (CCP), and the ban of naked CDSes. Main Theorem 2 (informal). There is an exponential-time algorithm for optimising any objective function of interest with respect to the clearing recovery rates if CCDs are mandated. Both the regulatory frameworks in EU and US require the use of a CCP for a large part of the over-the-counter derivatives market [SSB16]. This means that if two banks uùë¢u and vùë£v want to sign a derivative (CDS in our context) they need to involve a CCP which will sign one CDS contract with uùë¢u and another CDS with vùë£v. A CCP is typically so well capitalised that it can absorb shocks in the market. A Central CDS debtor is a CCP which is not creditor of any CDS contract, a strengthening of the current notion of CCP where the risk of the original CDS from uùë¢u to vùë£v is not only absorbed downstream towards vùë£v but also upstream vis-a-vis uùë¢u (e.g., the original CDS is only substituted with a CDS between the CCP and vùë£v whereas the liability with uùë¢u is a simple debt contract). Such a policy requirement restricts quite significantly the network structure and holds out the hope for efficient computation of (good approximations of) clearing rates. Interestingly, under the presences of CCDs, all clearing vectors are rational. Unfortunately, our inapproximability result applies also to the case in which CCDs ought to be used. We propose an approach for computing exact clearing vectors. Specifically, for financial networks that involve CCDs, we devise a Mixed-Binary Linear Program. Within this program, there is a combination of real-valued variables for the recovery rates and binary decision variables tailored to indicate a bank‚Äôs solvency status. The feasible solutions of this program correspond to the clearing recovery rate vectors of the network. This framework is highly adaptable for optimising any linear objective function of interest related to the clearing vector. An immediate implication is an exponential-time algorithm for computing clearing recovery rate vectors when CCDs are mandated. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first explicit algorithm for the clearing problem with derivatives. Main Theorem 3 (informal). There is a polynomial-time algorithm computing exact clearing recovery rates if CCDs are mandated and naked CDSes are banned. A naked CDS is a purely speculative contract;\nits counterparties do not have any other interest in the reference bank if not the CDS itself. However, regulators could ban their existence and only allow to buy a CDS if a corresponding (debt) exposure exists ‚Äì i.e., to only have so-called covered CDS. We exploit the topological structure of covered CDS and CCDs and compute exact clearing recovery rates for any such financial network in polynomial time. Significance of our results.\nThe clearing problem is among the first conjectured by the authors in [DFHM22], to fall into the category of problems for which a transition from an undefined small constant inapproximability parameter to an explicit higher bound can be achieved via their proposed tool, i.e., Pure-Circuit. Following the current of research in the intersection of finance and computation and aligning it with the cutting-edge research direction marked by [DFHM22], we prove the conjecture correct. We provide the first explicit inapproximability bound for the clearing problem for financial networks with credit default swaps. The significance of our result is not restricted to specifying the inapproximability bound, but also to its comparison with the state of the art. We specify the initial (yet unknown) inapproximability bound to œµ<1/150‚âà0.0067italic-œµ11500.0067\\epsilon<1/150\\approx 0.0067 (cf. Appendix C). Therefore, our main theorem 2 is a seven-fold improvement over the state of the art. Another important added value is that our result holds for any ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù payment scheme (see Corollary 1 below). This paper is the pivotal step from complexity to algorithmic results for the clearing problem. Our optimisation approach is novel, and provides a versatile tool for proving higher lower bounds and upper bounds. The proposed algorithms are the first positive results in the area. The exponential algorithm suggests a clearing mechanism for central clearing authorities. Moreover, it solves default ambiguity problems that were previously noted in the literature [PW22] (cf. Remark 3 below for details). It is important to emphasise that the exponent in the algorithm‚Äôs running time is contingent solely on the number of banks in the network and remains unaffected by the actual size of the parameters within the networks structure (see Remark 3 below). The efficient algorithm we propose, when high-capitalised clearing authorities are coupled with covered CDSes, aligns with legislative policies on prohibiting the use of ‚Äúnaked CDSes.‚Äù Our analytical proof supports with evidence policies by the EU for sovereign debt in the wake of the Eurozone crisis, (see [EUB]) and previous research [IDKV22b, SSB17]. Related Work.  The clearing problem was introduced by Eisenberg and Noe [EN01]. They introduced a model addressed to financial networks with simple debt contracts. The authors presented the first polynomial-time algorithm for computing exact clearing recovery rate vectors whenever banks pay proportionally. Other payment policies and variations of the model were defined by Rogers and Veraart [RV13]. Concepts of financial systems with simple debt contracts were investigated in [SS21, PW21a, HW22] Schuldenzucker, Seuken and Battiston [SSB16], added credit default swaps to the model. In [SSB17], the authors showed that finding a weak approximate clearing vector in financial networks containing both debt contracts and CDSes is PPAD-complete. Ioannidis, de Keijzer and Ventre [IDKV22b, IDKV22a, IdKV23] showed that computing an exact solution to the clearing problem with CDSes whenever the banks pay proportionally or under priorities is FIXP-complete. Further studies on financial networks with CDSes are presented by Papp and Wattenhofer [PW22, PW20, PW21b]. A game-theoretic approach to financial networks is introduced by Bertschinger, Hoefer and Schmand [BHS20]. Financial Network games and strategic behaviour of financial firms is presented by Kanellopoulos, Kyropoulou and Zhou [KKZ21, KKZ22].The strategic framework of prioritising debts in financial networks with CDSes is due to Papp and Wattenhofer [PW20]. The complexity of total search function problems TFNP was first considered by Megiddo and Papadimitriou [MP91] while the class PPAD was defined by Papadimitriou¬†[Pap94, Yan09] and gained significant attention from the papers of Daskalakis, Goldberg and Papadimitriou [DGP09] and Chen, Deng and Teng [CDT09] for computing Nash equilibrium in strategic-formed games. The FIXP complexity class was introduced by Etessami and Yannakakis [EY10, Yan09] for studying strong approximation to Nash equilibrium in strategic-formed games. Recent advancements related to the FIXP class can be found in [BHH21, FGH+23, FHHH21, GH21, IDKV22b, IdKV23, HL21]. Generalised-Circuit was introduced by [CDT09] and used by Rubinstein [Rub15] to establish a first constant inapproximability method. Most recently Deligkas, Fearnley, Hollender and Melissourgos [DFHM22] suggested Pure-Circuit, a tool for showing stronger constant inapproximability results for PPAD. Applications of the problem are presented in [DFHM22, DFHM23].\n\nReference markers found: [0]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]0: a direct reduction from Pure-Circuit to the clearing problem.
