      "content": "Paper Title: StereoSpike: Depth Learning with a Spiking Neural Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFigure 4 shows qualitative visualizations of depth reconstructions obtained with our model. Table 1(a) provides a quantitative comparison with previous works on the Mean Depth Error (MDE), the most common metric used for characterizing depth estimation on MVSEC. In outdoor scenarios, our model outperforms E2Depth 9 by a large margin at all cutoff distances, and with 25×\\times fewer parameters. This is not due to the fact that 9 takes input from only one camera as the monocular version of StereoSpike still remains consistently superior to this competitor. In indoor settings, our model also proves to be better in terms of both accuracy and number of parameters than the previous state-of-the-art (DDES, ), which is a fully-fledged ANN using 3D convolutions with a less general framework.\nHowever, recent approaches [ref]44 have built upon the latter and positioned themselves with lower MDE than StereoSpike. In the case of EITNet , this improvement comes at the cost of a much higher number of parameters (more than 10 times). DTC-SPADE [ref]44 has managed to incorporate elements of the latter for the benefit of accuracy and without exploding algorithmic size. Nevertheless, we argue that this model is heavier than StereoSpike and less suited to edge and energy-efficient computing in embedded systems.\nWith StereoSpike, we aim to address the problem of dense depth estimation from events consistently with the philosophy of event cameras, that is, by placing ourselves on the portability side of the accuracy-lightweightness trade-off. Moreover, unlike the recent state-of-the-art for this task   [ref]44, StereoSpike’s architecture is not specific to the estimation of depth and could be used for any other large-scale regression task; its simple adaptation from the standard 2D U-Net base makes it all the more general. In terms of MDE, monocular models (i.e., receiving data from only one camera) also lead to good depth estimates, but with a consistent drop in accuracy across data splits.\nThis suggests that in addition to being –for the most part– a non-temporal task, depth reconstruction from DVS data can be efficiently tackled on a monocular setting, at a reasonable cost in performance. Therefore, fusing left and right data as early as in the first convolution layer reveals itself to be a simple but good strategy for exploiting binocular disparity, as backpropagation proves capable of extracting stereoscopic cues in such a way. From a visual neuroscience perspective, there is strong evidence that binocular cues are mixed in a similar manner at very early stages of the visual system.\n\nReference markers found: [44]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]44: of both accuracy and number of parameters than the previous state-of-the-art (DDES, ), which is a fully-fledged ANN using 3D convolutions with a less general framework.\nHowever, recent approaches [ref]44 have built upon the latter and positioned themselves with lower MDE than StereoSpike.
