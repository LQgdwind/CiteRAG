      "content": "Paper Title: GRAC: Self-Guided and Self-Regularized Actor-Critic\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe proposed algorithm incorporates three key ingredients within the actor-critic method: a self-regularized TD update, self-guided policy improvements based on evolution strategies, and Max-min double Q-Learning. In this section, we review prior work related to these ideas. In Deep Q-Learning, we use a nonlinear function approximator such as a neural network to approximate the Q-function that represents the value of each state-action pair. Learning the Q-function in this way is known to suffer from divergence issues [ref]25 such as assigning unrealistically high values to state-action pairs . This is detrimental to the quality of the greedy control policy derived from Q . To mitigate the divergence issue, Mnih et al.4 introduce a target network which is a copy of the estimated Q-function and is held fixed to serve as a stable target for some number of steps. However, target networks can slow down the learning process due to delayed function updates . Durugkar et al.  propose Constrained Q-Learning, which uses a constraint to prevent the average target value from changing after an update. Achiam et al. give a simple analysis based on a linear approximation of the Q function and develop a stable Deep Q-Learning algorithm for continuous control without target networks. However, their proposed method requires separately calculating backward passes for each state-action pair in the batch, and solving a system of equations at each timestep. Peng et al. 5 uses Monte Carlo instead of TD error to update the Q network and removes the need for a target network. Our proposed GRAC algorithm adds a self-regularization term to the TD-Learning objective to keep the change of the state-action value small. Evolution Strategies (ES) are a family of black-box optimization algorithms which are typically very stable, but scale poorly in high-dimensional search spaces. Gradient-based deep RL methods, such as DDPG 2, are often sample efficient, particularly in the off-policy setting. These off-policy methods can continue to reuse previous experience to improve value estimations but can be unstable and highly sensitive to hyper-parameter tuning 6. Researchers have proposed to combine these approaches to get the best of both worlds. Pourchot et al. 6 proposed CEM-RL to combine CEM with either DDPG 2 or TD3 [ref]6. However, CEM-RL applies CEM within the actor parameter space which is extremely high-dimensional, making the search not efficient. Kalashnikov et al.  introduce QT-Opt, which leverages CEM to search the landscape of the Q function, and enables Q-Learning in continuous action spaces without using an actor. Based on QT-Opt, Simmons-Edler et al.  leverage CEM to search the landscape the Q-function but propose to initialize CEM with a Gaussian prior covering the action space, independent of observations. However, as shown in , CEM does not scale well to high-dimensional action spaces, such as in the Humanoid task used in this paper. We first let the actor network output an initial Gaussian action distribution conditioned on current state. Then we use CEM to search for an action with a higher Q value than the Q value of the Gaussian mean. Starting from the predicted distribution, GRAC speeds up the learning process compared to popular actor-critic methods. Using function approximation, Q-learning  is known to suffer from overestimation . To mitigate this problem, Hasselt et al.  proposed Double Q-learning which uses two Q functions with independent sets of weights. TD3 [ref]6 proposed Clipped Double Q-learning to learn two Q-functions and uses the smaller of the two to form the targets in the TD-Learning process. However, TD3 [ref]6 may lead to underestimation. Besides, the actor network in  TD3 [ref]6 is trained to select the action to maximize the first Q function throughout the training process which may make it very different from the second Q-function. A large discrepancy results in large TD-errors which in turn results in large gradients during the update of the actor and critic networks. This makes instability of the learning process more likely. We propose Max-min Double Q-Learning to balance the differences between the two Q functions and provide a better approximation of the Bellman optimality operator .\n\nReference markers found: [25]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]25: approximator such as a neural network to approximate the Q-function that represents the value of each state-action pair.
