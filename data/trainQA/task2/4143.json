(Given a set of colored vertices, we obtain a multiset from the occurrences of colors in it.)\nBy requiring that the margin of victory of a set of colored vertices shall not exceed a given threshold, we prevent one color from becoming a dominating majority\n(see Stoica et al.  for a more extensive motivation of this concept).\nAs an alternative simple fairness measure, we consider Max-Min, which is defined as the difference between the number of occurrences of the most frequently occurring element and the number of occurrences of the least frequently occurring element in a multiset.\nIn a set of colored vertices with a small value of Max-Min all colors appear more or less equally often. Which of MoV or Max-Min is more appropriate depends not only on the specific application (as discussed in the next two paragraphs) but also on the underlying data.\nSuppose that we have 2​n2𝑛2n red, 2​n2𝑛2n blue, and one green vertex on the left side and two vertices on the right side.\nThen, it would be natural to deem a subset consisting of n𝑛n red, n𝑛n blue, and one green vertex fair (as it is in some sense the best we can hope for).\nAccordingly, MoV seems to be a better fit because the MoV of the described subset is zero whereas the Max-Min value is n−1𝑛1n-1.\nIn contrast, if there are 2​n2𝑛2n red, 2​n2𝑛2n blue, and 2​n2𝑛2n green vertices, then the same subset with n𝑛n red, n𝑛n blue, and one green vertex should be considered as unfair, rendering Max-Min more suitable for this color distribution than MoV.\nIn general, Max-Min seems to be a natural choice for homogeneous data.\nThe first example illustrates, however, that in some scenarios, MoV may serve as a viable relaxation of Max-Min.111Note that the Max-Min value is at least the MoV value for any multiset. A notable application of Fair Matching emerges in the context of district-based elections.\nIn such elections, voters (modeled by vertices in U𝑈U) are divided into constituencies (modeled by vertices in V𝑉V), and then\neach constituency elects its own representative.\nHere, colors can represent various attributes.\nFor instance, colors may represent political standings.\nA small margin of victory is particularly desirable in this case because it will lead to close elections, holding politicians accountable for their job.\nOne could also strive for “fair” representation of different ethnic groups or age groups by modeling ethnicity or age with colors.222Notably in  and [8, pp. 251-252], Banerjee and Duflo reported that, in particular in developing countries, districts that are dominated by one ethnicity are a serious problem, as candidates belonging to the dominating ethnicity often win independent of their merit. As a result, those candidates are, among others, more likely to be corrupt.\nOther applications include the assignment of school children to schools (where colors may model sociodemographic attributes) or the assignment of reviewers to academic papers (where colors may model the level of expertise or academic background of reviewers). Similar fairness considerations also arise in modern online systems (see, e.g., 0 for a survey).\nFor instance, fairness is a pressing issue to counter targeted advertising or to improve recommender systems.\nHere one task is to ensure that the content (each perhaps represented by multiple vertices in U𝑈U) falling into different categories (colors) is assigned to users (vertices in V𝑉V) in a way that each user is presented with a “diverse” selection of content.\nLastly, we mention that (Max-Min) Fair Matching has also applications outside of the “fairness” context:\nImagine a centralized job market for companies (vertices in V𝑉V) and applicants (vertices in U𝑈U), each having a specific skillset (color).\nFirms may wish to balance between applicants with different skillsets so that they are able to place employees with various skillsets in each team (to be formed).\nFor instance, it may be desirable for a software company to hire roughly the same number of frontend and backend developers. We perform a refined complexity analysis of the NP-hard Max-Min Fair Matching and MoV Fair Matching problems in terms of the size k𝑘k of V𝑉V, the number |C|𝐶|C| of colors, and the maximum degree ΔUsubscriptΔ𝑈\\Delta_{U} and ΔVsubscriptΔ𝑉\\Delta_{V} among vertices in U𝑈U and V𝑉V, respectively.\nOur main contribution are arguably involved FPT algorithms for the parameterization k𝑘k (Section 4).\nAt the heart of the design of our algorithms lies an integer linear program (ILP) of bounded dimension.\nWe essentially determine whether Hall-like conditions that guarantee the existence of a fair matching are fulfilled by formulating these in a system of linear inequalities.\nIn order to establish the correctness of our ILP formulations, we prove what we call touching separation theorem, getting inspiration from Frank’s separation theorem on submodular and supermodular functions .\nFor MoV Fair Matching, we apply our approach in conjunction with the color coding technique [ref]5.\nTo familiarize ourselves with the ideas underlying our ILPs, in Section 3, we start with a warm-up where we present ILP-based fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for the larger parameter k+|C|𝑘𝐶k+|C|.\nTo sum up, as it is straightforward to see that Max-Min/Mov Fair Matching are FPT with respect to the size n𝑛n of U𝑈U333We can enumerate all fair subsets of U𝑈U in 2n⋅(n+k)O​(1)⋅superscript2𝑛superscript𝑛𝑘𝑂12^{n}\\cdot(n+k)^{O(1)} time. Then, Knapsack-like dynamic programming solves Fair Matching in 3n⋅(n+k)O​(1)⋅superscript3𝑛superscript𝑛𝑘𝑂13^{n}\\cdot(n+k)^{O(1)} time., we establish the fixed-parameter tractability of both problems for the two natural parameters n𝑛n and k𝑘k.444In most described applications k𝑘k is typically quite small and much smaller than n𝑛n. For instance, Stoica et al.  performed some experiments for MoV Fair Matching to assign voters to districts with n=50,000𝑛50000n=50,000 and k=10𝑘10k=10, and to assign students to schools with n=41,834𝑛41834n=41,834 and k=61𝑘61k=61.\nWe then in Section 5 study the computational complexity of Max-Min/Mov Fair Matching with respect to ΔUsubscriptΔ𝑈\\Delta_{U}, ΔVsubscriptΔ𝑉\\Delta_{V}, and |C|𝐶|C|.\nWe show that Max-Min/Mov Fair Matching is polynomial-time solvable for |C|=2𝐶2|C|=2 and that it becomes NP-hard for |C|≥3𝐶3|C|\\geq 3.\nMoreover, we settle all questions concerning the problems’ classical complexity in terms of ΔUsubscriptΔ𝑈\\Delta_{U} and ΔVsubscriptΔ𝑉\\Delta_{V}, revealing a complete complexity landscape in this regard (see Figure 1).\nFinally, in Section 6, we show that Max-Min/Mov Fair Matching are linear-time solvable when every vertex in U𝑈U can be matched to any vertex in V𝑉V. Notably, all our algorithmic results hold even if we require that each vertex from V𝑉V is matched to at least one vertex from U𝑈U.\nThis further constraint may appear when we need to divide the vertices into exactly k𝑘k non-empty fair subsets.\nAlthough this constraint is seemingly simple, sometimes (e.g., in our FPT algorithm for Max-Min Fair Matching for k𝑘k) non-trivial adaptions are needed. Stoica et al.  introduced three problems where the task is to partition a set of colored vertices into subsets with a small margin of victory satisfying some global size constraints.\nAmong these three, the most general is Fair Connected Regrouping, where one is given a vertex-colored graph G𝐺G, an integer k𝑘k, and a function that determines for each vertex which subsets it can be part of.\nThe task is then to find a partitioning of G𝐺G into k𝑘k fair districts (i.e., connected components).\nIn a follow-up work, Boehmer et al.  analyzed how the structure of G𝐺G influences the (parameterized) computational complexity of Fair Connected Regrouping.\nThe other two problems Stoica et al.  considered are special cases of Fair Connected Regrouping:\nOne is Fair Regrouping where the connectivity constraints are dropped (corresponding to MoV Fair Matching).\nThe other is Fair Regrouping_X, which is a special case of Fair Regrouping, where any vertex can belong to any district (corresponding to MoV Fair Matching on complete bipartite graphs; we study this special case in Section 6).\nThey proved that Fair Regrouping is NP-hard for three colors (without any constraints on the degree of the graph) and is XP with respect to the number k𝑘k of districts (i.e., polynomial-time solvable for constant k𝑘k).\nThey also showed that Fair Regrouping_X is XP with respect to the number of colors. Coming back to Fair Matching as a matching problem, Ahmed et al.  proposed a global supermodular objective to model the fairness (which they call diversity)\nof a bipartite weighted many-to-many matching and developed a polynomial-time greedy heuristic for it.\nAhmadi et al. [ref]1 extended the work of Ahmed et al.  by generalizing the problem to the case where vertices can have multiple different colors and presented a pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm for it.\nMoreover, Dickerson et al.  applied this formulation of fairness to an online setting where vertices from the left side arrive over time and Ahmed et al.  applied it to the task of forming teams. Fairness is also a popular topic when finding a stable many-to-one matching of vertices that have preferences over each other. Here, fairness constraints are typically modeled by imposing for each vertex from the right side certain lower and upper bounds on the number of vertices of each color that can be matched to it     . More broadly speaking, fairness has recently also been frequently applied to a variety of different problems from the area of combinatorial optimization.\nFor instance, in the context of the Knapsack , Maximum Coverage  or s𝑠s-t𝑡t Path  problem, fairness means that all types are represented equally in the selected solution.\nAnother example is Clustering, where each cluster is considered fair when each type accounts for a certain fraction of vertices in it   0. The proof (or their completion) of all results marked by (⋆⋆\\star) can be found in the appendix.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: theorem, getting inspiration from Frank’s separation theorem on submodular and supermodular functions .\nFor MoV Fair Matching, we apply our approach in conjunction with the color coding technique [ref]5.\nTo familiarize ourselves with the ideas underlying our ILPs, in Section 3, we start with a warm-up where we present ILP-based fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for the larger parameter\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
