      "content": "Paper Title: pNNCLR: Stochastic Pseudo Neighborhoods for Contrastive Learning based Unsupervised Representation Learning Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDeep learning is rapidly revolutionizing almost every sector of our society. Off-the-shelf models are being used for feature/representation extraction, and standard models are being fine-tuned for their application to specific problems . To train such models, efficient representation learning methods are required [ref]2. SSL or representation learning provides the backbone networks for many computer vision related tasks such as object detection, segmentation, image or video recognition, etc. . Recent developments like NNCLR [ref]4, SimSiam , Decouplted contrastive learning [ref]2, CLIP , CAEs , are good examples of powerful feature extractors, and all employ some standard backbone network like ResNet  or EfficientNet . Labeling the data is a costly operation, on the other hand, the main advantage of SSL models is their ability to learn better generic representations from the unlabelled data 0. Foundational works like SimCLR 0 and SimSiam  have established that SSL models with slight finetuning (as low as 1% of the labeled data) can outperform their counterpart supervised models. Another advantage of SSL models is that they provide task-agnostic models which can easily be adapted using transfer learning to multiple kinds of downstream tasks (the tasks which are specialized cases of a larger generic task also known as the pretext task) 1. Earlier models like the non-contrastive models (RotNet 1, Jigsaw 2) used intelligently designed pretext tasks for providing the self-supervisory signal to the learning algorithm. These signals were based on some independent tasks like verifying the correct rotation 1, the correct sequence of frames 3, or the correct placement of tiles 2. Recently, another branch of SSL methods, called contrastive learning (CL), has shown promising progress 0. With better loss functions and image augmentations, these models have now exceeded the non-contrastive models. These contrastive learning based methods work by pushing closer the similar-looking (positive) samples and pushing apart non-similar class (negative) samples, without actually knowing the classes of these samples. However, recently, it was shown that the positives generated using augmentations are not very semantically diverse [ref]4. To overcome this, it was suggested to use the nearest neighbors of the anchors (the samples whose positive is to be found), since this leads to better representations by learning from non-trivial positive samples [ref]4. However, in our experiments and analysis with NNCLR [ref]4, we found that the quality of the support set plays a crucial role in learning better representations. At the beginning of training, the probability of finding a good nearest neighbor is low, and this can affect the overall learning in the SSL model. Based on these observations, this work presents stochastic pseudo nearest neighbors and the learning framework ‚Äî pNNCLR. The main objective of contrastive SSL methods is to employ a strategy or function, fùëìf, to arrange the latent space in such a way that similar class samples appear closer (attraction property) than distinct class samples (repulsion property) in the latent space. Nearest neighbor based methods try to amplify the diversity in the attraction process. The source of this diversity is the process of sampling the positives in the form of nearest neighbors and not augmented views. However, this amplification of diversity introduces a trade-off between the attraction and repulsion properties. Because, if the quality of the support set is low or the chosen nearest neighbors are incorrect (section 3.3), fùëìf may negatively impact the main objective by reducing the intended attraction and repulsion properties. To improve this trade-off, independent of the support set quality, we hypothesize modifying fùëìf such that the diversity in the attraction process is amplified favorably, i.e., the positive samples retain the semantic variations and, at the same time, are not unfavorably distinct from the anchor point. We accomplish this by reducing the magnitude of the resultant vector in the direction of the nearest neighbor by a factor. Although, this controls the diversification in the attraction process, however, it reduces the semantic quality. To avoid this, a stochastic prior is imposed during the sampling of positives. This allows the expansion of uncertainty to increase the semantic information. As a consequence of these adaptations, the positives become more semantically diverse and related to the anchor point, thereby, helping in learning better representations by the model. We also found that by employing a smooth-weight-updation approach, the effects of uncertainty, introduced by nearest neighbor based learning, can be stabilized to a significant extent. We tested the proposed adaptations and found that they significantly improve the performance of the proposed method over our baseline, NNCLR [ref]4, on image recognition tasks. Following this, we also tested it for the medical datasets and found a favorable performance. Following are the main contributions of this work: We studied the suitability of nearest neighbor based semantic information enrichment in CL, and introduced stochastic pseudo nearest neighbors (pNN) to control the quality of the positive samples in CL based SSL methods. To the best of our knowledge, we are first to introduce pNN approach. We showed that a smooth-weight-updation approach in NN based CL methods is highly useful in controlling the uncertainty in sampling. Using this, we propose our CL base method called pNNCLR, which significantly improves over our baseline NNCLR [ref]4. We performed many experiments and ablation studies to empirically verify the superiority of our contribution through medical as well as non-medical datasets. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the related literature on representation learning methods. Section 3 presents the details of our baseline and the proposed method. Section 4 presents the implementation details, evaluation, and comparison of the results on different datasets. After this, the conclusion and appendix are presented.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: feature/representation extraction, and standard models are being fine-tuned for their application to specific problems .
