      "content": "Paper Title: Distributional Reinforcement Learning with Dual Expectile-Quantile Regression\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDistributional reinforcement learning (RL)  aims to maintain an estimate of the full distribution of expected return rather than only the mean. It can be used to better capture the uncertainty in the transition matrix of the environment , as well as the stochasticity of the policy being evaluated, which may enable faster and more stable training by making better use of the data samples 2. Non-parametric approximations of the return distribution learned by quantile regression have proven very effective in several domains [ref]7 [ref]8 7 , when combined with deep RL agents such as deep Q-networks (DQN) 4 or soft actor-critic (SAC) .\nHowever, quantile-based methods sometimes require an extensive number of steps to outperform the classical agents they are based upon , and sometimes fail at solving the task at hand 9.\nIn this paper, we propose an extension of the non-parametric approach to distributional RL that improves sample efficiency and overall performance. Our approach relies on combining expectile and quantile regression for policy evaluation. In short, where quantiles are a generalisation of the median, expectiles are a generalisation of the mean. Interestingly, they learn different information about on the distribution: quantiles are trained using an asymmetric L1 loss and are therefore robust to outliers, while expectiles rely on an asymmetric L2 loss, which finds more stable solutions and has better optimization properties. In particular, expectile regression produces the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) of any point within the range of the distribution, including all quantiles of the distribution 7. Moreover, expectile regression provides a straightforward estimator of the mean expected return, i.e., the expectile 0.50.50.5. Finally, expectiles present valuable properties for deep RL that we detail in Section 4. In particular, we show that they allow for an adaptive action selection strategy based on training errors. The properties listed above make expectile regression a desirable approach for distributional RL. However, in distributional temporal difference learning , the distributional Bellman operator requires samples from the target distribution to compute the target during value-function training and, contrary to quantiles, obtaining such samples from expectile values is not obvious. Previous work 0 observed that a naive approach using expectile values as pseudo-samples lacks theoretical guarantees and makes the distribution collapse to the mean in practice. Rowland et al. 0 solved this issue by applying an imputation step that returns samples based on expectile values, and takes the form of finding an approximate solution to an optimization problem.\nThis solution, although effective, is extremely slow, preventing practical applications at scale.\nOur approach does not have this drawback, as we rely on a dual estimation of quantiles and expectiles, in which quantile values are used to generate samples from the target distribution. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We propose an implementation of the distributional Bellman operator based on dual estimation of quantiles and expectiles. It solves both in theory and in practice the distribution collapse that previous work observed and does not require intractable computations. We show in a toy environment and at scale on continuous control tasks that our proposed operator leads to stronger results than both quantile-based and expectile-based approaches. We leverage properties of the expectiles to design an adaptive action selection strategy based on training errors. To support the reproducibility of this work, we publicly release the code for our approach.111https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DualRegressionRL\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: more stable training by making better use of the data samples 2.
