      "content": "Paper Title: Deep image prior for 3D magnetic particle imaging: A quantitative comparison of regularization techniques on Open MPI dataset\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the following quantitative and qualitative comparison, we distinguish three classes of reconstruction methods which we evaluate on the two phantoms of the 3D Open MPI dataset described in Section II-D: DIP: Reconstructions based on the DIP approach minimizing a data fidelity term as described in Section II-C using Adam with varying numbers of iterations. VAR: Reconstructions based on the minimization of a Tikhonov-type functional consisting of a data-fidelity and a penalty term as outlined in Section II-B. Minimization is performed by AMSGrad  until convergence is reached such that results rely on the variational regularization only. KACZ: Analogous to VAR, but the minimization realized by a Kaczmarz-type algorithm with varying numbers of iterations. Effectively yields reconstructions, which are results of a hybrid regularization, mixing iterative and variational elements. We will encode our methods based on the class, the respective data fidelity, and the penalty terms, i.e., Method class D data fidelity + P penalty.\nAll methods rely on a certain number of parameters controlling the degree of regularization. We performed a discrete optimization with respect to these parameters to obtain optimal results in terms of PSNR and SSIM. The methods of interest in this comparison are specified in more detail in the following list: DIP Dℓ1superscriptℓ1\\ell^{1} + P-: We minimize the functional (II.7) with p=1𝑝1p=1 only as it led to superior reconstruction performance when compared to the case p=2𝑝2p=2. Our fixed random input to the network, z𝑧z, has entries coming from the uniform distribution between 00 and 0.70.70.7 and has, like the output, the shape (1,19,19,19)1191919(1,19,19,19) where 111 is the number of channels and 191919 is the edge length of the concentration cube we aim to reconstruct. The encoder steps down-sample by a factor of 222 and have 646464, 128128128 and 256256256 channels respectively. The decoder is symmetric to this. We minimize the functional for 200002000020000 iterations with Adam [ref]41 and for the different learning rates αi=10−isubscript𝛼𝑖superscript10𝑖\\alpha_{i}=10^{-i}, for i=3,4,5𝑖345i=3,4,5, and the standard momenta settings β=(0.9,0.999)𝛽0.90.999\\beta=(0.9,0.999). For the purpose of parameter optimization we extracted reconstructions after iterations s∈{s\\in\\{1, 2, ……\\ldots, 10, 12, ……\\ldots, 30, 35, ……\\ldots, 50, 60, ……\\ldots, 150, 175, ……\\ldots, 500, 600, ……\\ldots, 2000, 2500, ……\\ldots, 5000, 6000, ……\\ldots, 20000}}\\}. KACZ Dℓ2superscriptℓ2\\ell^{2} + Pℓ2superscriptℓ2\\ell^{2}: This is one of the commonly used techniques in MPI which minimizes the functional 12​‖A​c−yδ‖22+ρ​12​‖c‖2212superscriptsubscriptnorm𝐴𝑐superscript𝑦𝛿22𝜌12superscriptsubscriptnorm𝑐22\\frac{1}{2}\\|Ac-y^{\\delta}\\|_{2}^{2}+\\rho\\frac{1}{2}\\|c\\|_{2}^{2} with non-negativity constraints by a row action method for inconsistent systems of equations  (see [21, Alg. 1] or [39, Sec. 4] for the detailed algorithm). For the parameter optimization ρ∈{0.5i−1|i=1,⋯40}=:𝒫\\rho\\in\\{0.5^{i-1}|i=1,\\cdots 40\\}=:\\mathcal{P} were used. Like all the following KACZ reconstructions, we used 500 sweeps (i.e., going 500 times over all rows in order) and consider all reconstructions after the same sweeps/iterations s𝑠s as for the DIP up to 500500500. KACZ Dℓ2superscriptℓ2\\ell^{2} + P(ℓ1superscriptℓ1\\ell^{1}+ℓ2superscriptℓ2\\ell^{2}): This is an extension of the previous algorithm for inconsistent systems of equations taking into account an additional sparsity-promoting ℓ1superscriptℓ1\\ell^{1}-penalty term when minimizing the functional ‖A​c−yδ‖22+ρ​12​‖c‖22+λ​‖c‖1superscriptsubscriptnorm𝐴𝑐superscript𝑦𝛿22𝜌12superscriptsubscriptnorm𝑐22𝜆subscriptnorm𝑐1\\|Ac-y^{\\delta}\\|_{2}^{2}+\\rho\\frac{1}{2}\\|c\\|_{2}^{2}+\\lambda\\|c\\|_{1} with non-negativity constraints. We exploit a splitting method [48, Sec. 9.4.1] first applying one sweep over the matrix as in the previous method followed by applying a soft shrinkage operator before starting a new sweep over the matrix. A similar approach applying the soft shrinkage operator in each row action can be found in  for consistent systems. Both regularization parameters are taken from 𝒫𝒫\\mathcal{P} as above (i.e., resulting in 402superscript40240^{2} parameter combinations). KACZ Dℓ2superscriptℓ2\\ell^{2} + Pℓ1superscriptℓ1\\ell^{1}: We consider the previous functional for ρ=0𝜌0\\rho=0, i.e., 12​‖A​c−yδ‖22+λi​‖c‖112superscriptsubscriptnorm𝐴𝑐superscript𝑦𝛿22subscript𝜆𝑖subscriptnorm𝑐1\\frac{1}{2}\\|Ac-y^{\\delta}\\|_{2}^{2}+\\lambda_{i}\\|c\\|_{1} with non-negativity constraints via the previous algorithm (see also [50, Alg. 2] for an example implementation). We ran reconstructions for all parameter choices λ∈𝒫𝜆𝒫\\lambda\\in\\mathcal{P}. KACZ+TSVD Dℓ2superscriptℓ2\\ell^{2} + Pℓ1superscriptℓ1\\ell^{1}: When using ρ=0𝜌0\\rho=0 in the previous method, it is not guaranteed that a consistent system of equations is fed into the Kaczmarz algorithm which can result in unstable reconstructions. Due to the low-rank approximation and the ill-posedness of the problem, the matrix likely contains rows close to zero. We thus also used only the 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, and 1024 rows with the largest norms in the previous method (and corresponding entries of the measurement), i.e., we set K𝐾K in Section II-A to these values which is equivalent to a truncated SVD (TSVD). Reconstructions for λ∈𝒫𝜆𝒫\\lambda\\in\\mathcal{P} are computed. VAR: Here, we minimize a functional of the form II.6, where we chose the penalty parameter as above and the penalty function as ℓ1superscriptℓ1\\ell^{1}, ℓ2superscriptℓ2\\ell^{2} and TV. We also compare p=1𝑝1p=1 and p=2𝑝2p=2. Minimization of the functional is performed up to convergence by applying AMSGrad  with a learning rate of 10−2superscript10210^{-2} and again β=(0.9,0.999)𝛽0.90.999\\beta=(0.9,0.999) (pyTorch  standard settings) for 500500500 iterations, after each iteration we project c𝑐c to be non-negative. All methods are implemented in python  mainly using the packages numpy  and pyTorch .\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: down-sample by a factor of 222 and have 646464, 128128128 and 256256256 channels respectively.
