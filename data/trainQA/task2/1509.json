      "content": "Paper Title: Studying Catastrophic Forgetting in Neural Ranking Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nNeural ranking models have been increasingly adopted in the information retrieval (IR) and natural language processing (NLP) communities for a wide range of data and tasks  . One common underlying issue is that they learn relationships that may hold only in the domain from which the training data is sampled, and generalize poorly in unobserved domains111According to Jialin and Qiang [ref]41, a domain consists of at most two components: a feature space over a dataset and a marginal probability distribution within a task.  [ref]6 . To enhance the transferability of neural ranking models from a source domain to a target domain, transfer learning strategies such as fine-tuning , multi-tasking , domain adaptation [ref]41, and more recently adversarial learning [ref]7, have been widely used222We consider the definition of transfer learning in [ref]41 (Figure 2). Please note that several other definitions exist .. However, these strategies have by essence two critical limitations reported in the machine learning literature [ref]6 . The first one, as can be acknowledged in the NLP and IR communities [ref]7 , is that they require all the domains to be available simultaneously at the learning stage (except the fine-tuning). The second limitation, under-studied in both communities, is that the model leans to catastrophically forget existing knowledge (source domain) when the learning is transferred to new knowledge (target domain) leading to a significant drop of performance on the source domain. These limitations are particularly thorny when considering open-domain IR tasks including, but not limited to, conversational search.In the underlying settings (e.g., QA systems and chatbots    ), neural ranking models are expected to continually learn features from online information streams, sampled from either observed or unobserved domains, and to scale across different domains but without forgetting previously learned knowledge. Catastrophic forgetting is a long-standing problem addressed in machine learning using lifelong learning approaches [ref]6 . It has been particularly studied in neural-network based classification tasks in computer vision   and more recently in NLP    . However, while previous work showed that the level of catastrophic forgetting is significantly impacted by dataset features and network architectures, we are not aware of any existing research in IR providing clear lessons about the transferability of neural ranking models across domains, nor basically showing if state-of-the-art neural ranking models are actually faced with the catastrophic forgetting problem and how to overcome it if any. Understanding the conditions under which these models forget accumulated knowledge and whether a lifelong learning strategy is a feasible way for improving their effectiveness, would bring important lessons for both practical and theoretical work in IR. This work contributes to fill this gap identified in the neural IR literature, by studying the transferability of ranking models. We put the focus on catastrophic forgetting which is the bottleneck of lifelong learning. The main contributions of this paper are as follows. 1) We show the occurrence of catastrophic forgetting in neural ranking models. We investigate the transfer learning of five representative neural ranking models (DRMM, PACRR, KNRM, V-BERT and CEDR ) over streams of datasets from different domains333In our work, different domains refer to different datasets characterized by different data distributions w.r.t. to their source and content as defined in [ref]41. (MS MARCO , TREC Microblog  and TREC COVID19 ); 2) We identify domain characteristics such as relevance density as signals of catastrophic forgetting ; 3) We show the effectiveness of constraining the objective function of the neural IR models with a forget cost term, to mitigate the catastrophic forgetting.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: issue is that they learn relationships that may hold only in the domain from which the training data is sampled, and generalize poorly in unobserved domains111According to Jialin and Qiang [ref]41, a domain consists of at most two components: a feature space over a dataset and a marginal probability distribution within a task.
