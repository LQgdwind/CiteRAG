Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: A Probabilistic Framework for Lifelong Test-Time Adaptation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFollowing TENT [ref]39 and CoTTA , we adopt pre-trained WideResNet-28 [ref]46 model for CIFAR10-to-CIFAR10C, pre-trained ResNeXt-29 [ref]44 model for CIFAR100-to-CIFAR100C, and standard pre-trained ResNet-50 model for both ImageNet-to-ImagenetC and ImageNet-to-Imagenet3DCC experiments from RobustBench . We utilize SWAG-D¬† to approximate the posterior density from the source domain training data. SWAG-D approximates the posterior using a Gaussian distribution with diagonal covariance from the SGD trajectory.\nBefore adapting the model, we initialize it with the maximum a posteriori (MAP) of the approximate posterior that corresponds to the solution obtained by Stochastic Weight Averaging¬†. This is effectively the source domain pre-trained model. We update all the trainable parameters in all experiments.\nWe use KùêæK = 32 number of augmentations. We adopt the same augmentation confidence threshold described in .\nFor FIM based parameter restoration, we set the quantile value Œ¥ùõø\\delta = 0.03. We refer the readers to the Appendix for more details on the hyperparameters.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: Following TENT [ref]39 and CoTTA , we adopt pre-trained WideResNet-28 [ref]46 model for CIFAR10-to-CIFAR10C, pre-trained ResNeXt-29 [ref]44 model for CIFAR100-to-CIFAR100C, and standard pre-trained ResNet-50 model\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
