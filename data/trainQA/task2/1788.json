      "content": "Paper Title: Cognitive networks identify the content of English and Italian popular posts about COVID-19 vaccines: Anticipation, logistics, conspiracy and loss of trust\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThis work investigated social media language around COVID-19 vaccines. Focus was given to popular messages on the Twittersphere, i.e. content identified by the platform as being highly re-tweeted and liked by online users. Social media provide crucial data for understanding how large audiences perceive and react to events [ref]5 . Past approaches used social media traffic for inferring electoral outcomes in massive voting events   and more recent approaches adopted social media language to understand how massive populations coped with the COVID-19 pandemic 3 5  . The overarching theme of these approaches, including the current one, is that language is a driver of emotional content and conceptual knowledge that is transferred from people’s minds into digital posts . Accessing and modelling knowledge in social discourse becomes thus a proxy for reconstructing how massive audiences framed - semantically and emotionally - events in their cognitive representations of the world . In particular, understanding how popular posts frame ideas and emotions is crucial because popularity can lead to one single tweet being read and endorsed by up to 500k users. While not every user might be human  , these numbers indicate how crucial popular content can be in influencing people’s perceptions of real-world and online events, as confirmed also by recent works  . Popular tweets were found to portray mainly logistic aspects of vaccine distribution. Frequent and semantically rich  concepts of social discourse were relative to the necessity for people to receive as soon as possible their first dose of vaccine despite the issues of administering massive amounts of vaccine. English discourse in popular tweets was found to be strongly emotionally polarised. Emotional profiles featured at the same time strong signals of trust/joy and sadness/anger. Negative emotions were found to be channelled in language denouncing the issues of vaccine distribution rather than in the pandemic by itself, differently from what was found in the early stages of the pandemic 3   5. Trust and joy were rather relative to jargon celebrating science and its success in delivering a tool for fending off the pandemics. As a future research direction it would be interesting to identify whether these opposing emotions were expressed by the same set of users over time or were symptoms for the creation of different topics coexisting in the online information flow (like detected in [ref]5 and more recently in the socio-semantic analysis by 9). Almost no emotional polarisation was found in the semantic frame of \"vaccine\" in Italian, where an excess of positive emotions like joy and trust were found, in addition to anticipation. According to Ekman’s atlas of emotions 5, these basic emotions in language can give rise to nuances like positive expectations for the future, i.e. hope. Regretfully, the hopefulness expressed by Italians in popular tweets vanished completely after the case of the temporary suspension of the AstraZeneca vaccine in Italy and in several other EU countries. Our retrieved emotional profiles identified a drastic shift in the emotional portrayal of vaccine in online popular tweets. We registered a transition from a trustful and hopeful perception to a subsequent connotation of \"vaccine\" permeated by sadness, with no anticipation, joy or trust surrounding it. This is a concerning finding because of increasing psychological evidence that a lack of trust towards the health system and the institutions regulating is a marker for a reluctance to adopt health-related social norms like vaccination 0 , with concrete negative repercussions for global health. A key innovation of our approach was combining cognitive networks of linguistic associations 7  together with pictures and AI-based methods of image analysis 7 6. In addition to evidence of emotional coherence between the text embedded in pictures and the one coming from tweets, our work identified some differences in the language accompanied by specific categories of pictures. English popular tweets showing no pics of people were found to frame the idea of \"vaccine\" along with contrasting emotions of trust and disgust. A semantic network analysis for these emotional profiles identified their source in discussion focused on potential side effects and, more importantly, in associations reporting vaccines as ways to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. Language accompanying tweets with people wearing a face mask exhibited almost no signal of trust or joy in the semantic frame of \"vaccine\", differently from the portrayal of vaccines produced by messages including pictures with people wearing no face mask. Although co-occurrence does not imply causation, it must be noted that the adoption of face masks in public places has been met with mixed results (for a review see 1) by most Western countries. Masks hinder expressiveness and can create discomfort if worn for long times but there are also additional psychological elements. In fact, recent psycholinguistic studies showed how face masks became strongly associated with negative concepts like sickness and disease in the cognitive perception of the COVID-19 pandemics . In this way, by merging pictures and social media discourse, our results indicate that the overall perception of people wearing face masks is biased, i.e. poorer in terms of trust and joy when compared to common portrayals of people wearing no face protection. Future research should explore the emotional profiling of face masks and other aspects of COVID-19 vaccines on larger scales. We also identified a behavioural tendency for English users to re-share more emotionally extreme content, i.e. featuring stronger signals of disgust, sadness and joy, but also to favour less content enticing more sadness. These patterns were absent in the Italian twittersphere. The interplay between emotions and content re-sharing extends previous results related to sentiment polarity [ref]5 which highlighted a positive bias in content sharing and liking, i.e. positive sentiment promoting content sharing and endorsement. Our findings indicate that also negative, inhibiting emotions like disgust can amplify content sharing while sadness inhibits endorsement of online posts. Last but not least, our approach identified concerning associations between vaccines and conspiratorial jargon. Conceptual associations between hoaxes and vaccines have been traced in many other studies, cf. . However, in this case these associations were found in popular messages and not in borderline peripheral content, like the one produced by malignant social bots  . A negative framing of vaccines in terms of hoaxes driven by popular messages to large populations could self-evidently have negative consequences for the vaccination campaign. A recent study from cognitive neuroscience found that conspiracy-like misinformation can decrease pro-vaccination attitudes by exploiting the emotion of anger 2 (an emotion detected here) rather than through fear (which was not detected here). Anger can activate and amplify reactions like feeling frustrated or fooled by the establishment, which then lead to behavioural changes 5. In this way both the conspiratorial semantic associations and emotional signal of anger in the semantic frame of \"vaccine\" in popular English tweets should serve as early warning signals of misinformation hampering the vaccination campaign. Notice that our analysis is subject to some limitations. Textual forma mentis networks can adapt their structure but not their valence/emotional labels to the text being analysed. This is because affect data comes from predetermined large populations and it is representative of the way common language portrays concepts 3  . Because of contextual shifts, it might be that the affective connotation of specific concepts in a given discourse could be different 0. For instance, \"vaccine\" by itself was rated as mostly neutral in the dataset by Warriner and colleagues 3 but it was associated with mostly positive jargon in social discourse (see Figure 2, bottom). This limitation underlines the importance of considering words as connected with each other and not in isolation. This is because TFMNs enable the reconstruction of contextual shifts in affect by considering how words were associated with each other in language. Another limitation of the current approach is that the multi-language support stems mainly from automatic translation. Hopefully in the future more cognitive datasets will be built by considering native speakers’ data. As a future research direction it would be interesting also to merge the current semantic-emotional analysis together with content credibility dynamics, as recently quantified in social discourse about the vaccine by Pierri and colleagues 6.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: i.e. content identified by the platform as being highly re-tweeted and liked by online users.
