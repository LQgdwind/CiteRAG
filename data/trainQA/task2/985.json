Proving this observation is\nstraightforward from the analyses in  [ref]27 (see\nSection 2.5).

However, the computation of the row basis 𝐑𝐑\\mathbf{{R}} remains an obstacle which\nprevents the algorithm of [ref]32 from being a candidate for\nTheorem 1.2. Indeed, among the row basis algorithms we are aware of,\nonly one has a cost bound which fits into our target up to logarithmic factors:\nthe one of . It relies on three kernel bases computations, and\nwhile one of them is similar to the computation of [𝐊1​𝐊2]delimited-[]subscript𝐊1subscript𝐊2[\\mathbf{{K}}_{1}\\;\\;\\mathbf{{K}}_{2}] and is handled via the algorithm of , the two\nothers have different constraints on the input and were the subject of a\nspecific algorithm described in [56, Sec. 4]. In this reference,\ncost bounds were given without showing logarithmic factors; our own analysis\nrevealed the presence of a factor logarithmic in m𝑚m. The algorithm has a\nloop over Θ​(log⁡(m))Θ𝑚\\Theta(\\log(m)) iterations, each of them calling\n[55, Algo. 2] for minimal approximant bases with unbalanced input.\nThis approximant basis algorithm may spend a logarithmic number of iterations for finding some\ndegree profile of the output basis, in a way reminiscent of Keller-Gehrig’s\nalgorithm in [31, Sec. 5] which finds the lengths of Krylov\nsequences (the link between the two situations becomes more explicit for\napproximant bases at small orders, see [27, Sec. 7]). Our attempts at accelerating the row basis algorithm of  having\nnot succeeded, the algorithm in this paper follows an approach which is more\ndirect at first: remove the obstacle. Instead of computing a row basis\n𝐑𝐑\\mathbf{{R}} and relying on the identity det(𝐀)=det(𝐑)​det(𝐁)𝐀𝐑𝐁\\det(\\mathbf{{A}})=\\det(\\mathbf{{R}})\\det(\\mathbf{{B}}) (up to a constant), keep the first block row of\n𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{{A}}: and rely on the identity det(𝐀)=det(𝐀1)​det(𝐁)/det(𝐊2)𝐀subscript𝐀1𝐁subscript𝐊2\\det(\\mathbf{{A}})=\\det(\\mathbf{{A}}_{1})\\det(\\mathbf{{B}})/\\det(\\mathbf{{K}}_{2}). The nonsingularity of 𝐀1subscript𝐀1\\mathbf{{A}}_{1} and 𝐊2subscript𝐊2\\mathbf{{K}}_{2} is\neasily ensured thanks to the assumption that 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{{A}} is reduced, as discussed\nin Section 1.5. This leads to an unusual recursion scheme: we are not aware of a similar scheme\nbeing used in the literature on computational linear algebra. The algorithm\nuses three recursive calls with (m/2)×(m/2)𝑚2𝑚2(m/2)\\times(m/2) matrices whose\ndeterminant has degree at most D/2𝐷2D/2 for two of them and at most\nD𝐷D for the third; our complexity analysis in\nSection 3.3 shows that such a recursion gives the cost in\nTheorem 1.2. Precisely, if deg⁡(det(𝐀1))≤D/2degreesubscript𝐀1𝐷2\\deg(\\det(\\mathbf{{A}}_{1}))\\leq D/2 then\ndegree properties of minimal kernel bases imply that deg⁡(det(𝐊2))≤D/2degreesubscript𝐊2𝐷2\\deg(\\det(\\mathbf{{K}}_{2}))\\leq D/2, yielding the two calls in half the degree; otherwise the\nalgorithm uses inexpensive row and column operations on 𝐀𝐀\\mathbf{{A}} to reduce to\nthe case deg⁡(det(𝐀1))≤D/2degreesubscript𝐀1𝐷2\\deg(\\det(\\mathbf{{A}}_{1}))\\leq D/2. Although this approach removes the obstacle of row basis computation which\narises in [ref]32, it adds a requirement: all recursive calls must take\ninput matrices that are reduced. In the next section we discuss how to ensure\nthe reducedness of 𝐀1subscript𝐀1\\mathbf{{A}}_{1} and 𝐁𝐁\\mathbf{{B}} thanks to a straightforward generalization\nof [42, Sec. 3], and we describe a new algorithm which handles the\nmore involved case of 𝐊2subscript𝐊2\\mathbf{{K}}_{2}.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: with the 𝐀isubscript𝐀𝑖\\mathbf{{A}}_{i}’s of dimensions\n(m/2)×(m/2)𝑚2𝑚2(m/2)\\times(m/2), the algorithm of [ref]32 is based on\nthe block triangularization where the entries “∗bold-∗\\boldsymbol{\\ast}” are not computed,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
