      "content": "Paper Title: Probabilistic Learning of Multivariate Time Series with Temporal Irregularity\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIrregularly sampled time series are sequential recordings with unevenly spaced intervals between successive observation points. In the multivariate context, these time series can exhibit asynchrony because observations of individual component series may not align due to unevenly spaced intervals. These temporal irregularities arise whenever \"missing\" values occur in applications   [ref]3. They could occur due to insufficient observation. For instance, in applications such as autonomous systems, tracking the position and speed of a group of moving objects often encounter missing values when certain objects travel behind obstacles or when the return signals attenuate differently. In this case, the observation process is constrained, hindering regular monitoring of continuously varying phenomena. They could also occur if observable events themselves arrive at inherently random times or with varying frequencies. For example, a liquid stock can trade on a regular trading day at a millisecond time scale. However, options contracts written on the same underlying stock may only trade once every few minutes. In this case, temporal irregularity is an intrinsic feature of the data-generating process. It is the liquidity disparity that results in the differences in time rather than a lack of observation. Temporal irregularities, namely non-uniform time intervals, varying number of observations, and lack of alignment, pose challenges to the probabilistic forecasting of multivariate time series (MTS) data . Probabilistic forecasting  involves specifying the target variables’ joint distribution, learning its representation from data, and forecasting its time evolution. It is a fundamental task that includes the prediction problem of the mean, median, or specific quantile level as special cases. It also provides confidence intervals crucial for mission-critical downstream decision-making tasks [ref]6. However, the presence of temporal irregularities makes it challenging to model the distribution of MTS data, a defining characteristic of which is the existence of dependence structure . At the component level, the dependence structure of MTS data is serial, meaning the marginal distributions of a given component variable conditional on different time points are not independent. In addition, different components can have different degrees and different natures of serial dependencies. Some exhibit short-ranged but nonlinear serial dependencies, while others are linear but long-ranged . At the group level, the dependence structure refers to quantities such as the copula function of the joint distribution . Specific components may depend more strongly on each other than on others. Moreover, both the component-level serial dependencies and the group-level inter-dependencies can vary over time; for instance, the autocorrelations of individual components and the copula function of the group data can be path dependent. In other words, the distributional properties of MTS data can exhibit heterogeneities and vary over time, regardless of whether they are irregularly sampled. However, in cases where temporal irregularities are inherent to the data generation process, these irregularities reflect the underlying cause of these properties. Therefore, attributing them to missing values would be inappropriate. An ideal framework for probabilistic learning should acknowledge the intrinsic nature of uneven spacing and misalignments in the data and represent the associated data distribution accordingly. Before introducing our approach, we first review existing approaches to handling temporal irregularity and joint distribution modeling.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: asynchrony because observations of individual component series may not align due to unevenly spaced intervals.
