      "content": "Paper Title: MouSi: Poly-Visual-Expert Vision-Language Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCurrent large vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate significant potential in tasks requiring joint visual and linguistic perception, such as image captioning , visual question answering , visual grounding , and autonomous agents  [ref]5. VLMs harness large language models (LLMs) as cognitive foundation models to empower various vision-related tasks, while one vision component, such as CLIP [ref]6, typically serves as auxiliary modules that provide additional visual perception [ref]7. However, the perception abilities of the individual vision models still lag behind, even in simple tasks like counting.   0. This gap highlights a significant limitation in these models’ capacity to process and understand visual information as effectively as they handle linguistic data. According to the operation of the vertebrate visual system, with each functional unit encoding different visual aspects in parallel, retinal ganglion cells transmit distinct features to the brain 1. This biological mechanism suggests a model structure where the varied visual information should be parallelly encoded by diverse perception channels.  To this end, the community has verified that each model, with its unique approach to vision processing, contributes differently to understanding visual content 2. CLIP, with its contrastive learning approach, excels in aligning images with textual descriptions, providing a robust semantic understanding [ref]6. DINOv2, through its self-supervised learning paradigm at both the image level and patch level, offers significant advances in robust and stabilized feature extraction without relying on labeled data 3. LayoutLMv3’s specialization in document AI tasks demonstrates the power of visual text processing 4. 5 empirically investigated different visual tokenizers pre-trained with dominant methods (i.e., DeiT 6, CLIP, MAE 7, Dino 8), and observed that CLIP could capture more semantics, whereas the other models excelled at fine-grained perception. However, on the multimodal leaderboard organized by OpenCompass222  https://rank.opencompass.org.cn/leaderboard-multimodal, the visual encoders of all open-source VLMs are based on the pre-trained CLIP encoder family. Many researchers have pointed out the shortcomings of the CLIP encoder, such as the inability to reliably capture even basic spatial factors of images 9, suffering from object hallucination 0, and so on. In light of the distinct capabilities and limitations of these diverse vision models, a key question emerges: How can we incorporate the strengths of multiple visual experts so that they work in synergy to improve overall performance? Drawing inspiration from biology, we take on the poly-visual-expert perspective and design a novel model, similar to how the vertebrate visual system operates. Consequently, in the process of developing VLMs with poly-visual experts, three problems are in major concern: (1) whether the poly-visual experts are effective; (2) how to better integrate multiple experts; and (3) how to avoid exceeding the LLM’s maximum length with multiple visual experts? In order to verify whether multiple visual experts are effective for VLMs, we construct a candidate pool consisting of six well-known experts, including CLIP, DINOv2, LayoutLMv3, Convnext 1, SAM, and MAE.\nUsing LLaVA-1.5 as the base setup, we explored single-expert, double-expert combinations, and triple-expert combinations in eleven benchmarks.\nThe results, as shown in Figure 1, indicate that as the number of visual experts increases, the VLMs acquire richer visual information (due to more visual channels), and the upper limit of the multimodal capability improves across the board. In existing single visual channel VLMs, the methods for transmitting visual signals are either the MLP projection network 2 3 or the Q-Former network 4 5.\nTo accommodate multi-channel signal transmission from multiple experts, we modified both methods for poly-expert fusion networks separately.\nThe proposed method also compresses the local visual information by multi-patch-one-token for better transmission efficiency and reduces the quadratic computational cost of subsequent processing of VLMs. In position-aware VLMs, vision tokens consume a staggering amount of positional embeddings.\nTaking a single-turn multimodal dialogue in VQA as an example, with the MAE expert, the number of vision tokens (about 4096) is more than 500 times higher than the number of text tokens (about 8.7).\nInspired by the fact that visual experts already have positional encodings, we believe it is redundant to again assign a VLM position embedding to each visual token individually.\nTherefore, we explore different positional encoding schemes to effectively address the issue of position encoding waste.\nThe results show that the two schemes: sharing one position for all patches and 2D positional encoding (rows plus columns) are able to reduce the position consumption (in the case of CLIP, the PE used drops from 576 to 24 or even 1), while the performance is still comparable. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We introduce a poly-visual-expert VLM that synergistically combines the strengths of various visual encoders to improve the overall capabilities of VLMs. We tackle the challenge of vision token overflow in VLMs by proposing multi-patch-single-token projection and efficient positional encoding solutions. By experimenting with different combinations of experts, our results demonstrate enhanced performance (+1.53 with fair comparison) in multimodal tasks.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: (VLMs) demonstrate significant potential in tasks requiring joint visual and linguistic perception, such as image captioning , visual question answering , visual grounding , and autonomous agents  [ref]5.
