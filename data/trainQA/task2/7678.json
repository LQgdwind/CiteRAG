      "content": "Paper Title: POLICEd RL: Learning Closed-Loop Robot Control Policies with Provable Satisfaction of Hard Constraints\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe most common approach to enforce constraints in RL adopts the framework of constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) . CMDPs encourage policies to respect constraints by penalizing the expectation of the cumulative constraint violations . Numerous variations of this framework have been developed such as state-wise constrained MDP [ref]54, constrained policy optimization , and state-wise constrained policy optimization .\nThese approaches belong to the category of soft constraints as the policy is only encouraged to respect the constraint and provides no satisfaction guarantees [ref]22.\nThis category also encompasses work 3 where a control barrier transformer is trained to avoid unsafe actions, but no safety guarantees can be derived. A probabilistic constraint comes with the guarantee of satisfaction with some probability threshold 0 and hence ensures a higher level of safety than soft constraints as shown on Figure 3.\nFor instance,  derived policies having a high probability of not violating the constraints by more than a small tolerance.\nUsing control barrier functions, 2 guaranteed safe learning with high probability.\nSince unknown stochastic environments prevent hard constraints enforcement,  proposed to learn generative model-based soft barrier functions to encode chance constraints.\nSimilarly, by using a safety index on an unknown environment modeled by Gaussian processes,   established probabilistic safety guarantees. The focus of our work is at the third safety level described in 0 and illustrated on Figure 3. This level corresponds to inviolable hard constraints.\nWorks 3 7 both learned safe policies thanks to a differentiable safety layer projecting any unsafe action onto the closest safe action. However, since these safety layers only correct actions, a precise model of the robot dynamics model must be known, which is typically unavailable in RL settings.\nThis limitation is also shared by 8 , which require some knowledge of the robot dynamics model to compute either backward reachable sets 8 or control barrier functions . To circumvent any knowledge of the robot dynamics model,  used an implicit black-box model but is restricted to collision avoidance problems in 2D. To avoid these limitations, the Lagrangian-based approach of 2 and the model-free approach of  require to a priori specify the functional form of the safety certificate and as they approach zero violations, the cost signal for their DNN approximator becomes sparse, for these reasons they cannot guarantee the validity of their safety certificate. To sum up, our work differs from all these works as we enforce inviolable hard constraints on robot trajectories in closed-loop with a learned control policy while exclusively using a black-box model of the robot dynamics.\n\nReference markers found: [54]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]54: policies to respect constraints by penalizing the expectation of the cumulative constraint violations .
