The Sleep Heart Health Study (SHSS) was a multi-center cohort sleep study , whose two dataset versions, SHHS-1 and SHHS-2, contained the polysomnograms (PSG) data of 6441 and 3295 subjects respectively. The PSG data consist of multi-channel physio-electrical signals, including the Electroencephalogram(EEG) (C3-A2 and C4-A1), Electrooculogram (EOG), Electromyogram (EMG), Thoracic excursions (THOR) and abdominal excursions (ABDO), etc. The SleepEDF-20 and SleepEDF-78 were obtained from the PhysioBank , including 20 and 78 subjects respectively. The data contains 2 EEG channels (Fpz-Cz and Pz-Oz). The Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies (MASS) dataset  was collected including the whole-night sleep data from 200 subjects (103 females and 97 males), aged from 18-76. It mainly consists of about 20 EEG channels, plus EOG, EMG, ECG, and respiration signals. Different from the previous datasets, to our best knowledge, we proposed a novel cross-modal dataset to promote multi-modal learning for sleep stage classification, including the synchronous IR videos and the EEG signals. PSG-based Automated Sleep Stage Classification Methods: Multiple sleep classification methods have been proposed using the previously mentioned datasets. Conventional machine learning methods extracted time-frequency analysis features and applied the Support Vector Machine (SVM), random forest, wavelet transform and information entropy algorithms . However, these methods incorporated strong prior knowledge and hand-crafted features, therefore the classification accuracy relies on the feature qualities. Recently, deep learning based methods have been the mainstream for sleep stage classification. For single-channel EEG classification, the AttnSleep  used the multi-resolution convolutional neural network (MRCNN). The dilated convolution and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE)  also achieved competitive results. As for methods using multi-channel EEG signals, the BrainSleepNet [ref]14 captured the comprehensive features of multi-channel EEG signals. The MSTGCN  and GraphSleepNet [ref]16 used the structure-aware encoders for automatic sleep staging. In addition, a joint CNN framework [ref]17 adopted temporal information as a context to predict sleep stages. However, our dataset consists of sleep data of 105 subjects and most differently, we leveraged the synchrounous EEG and infra-red videos to analyze and trian the classification model, which is not available in the above datasets. To our best knowledge, we are the first to investigate the usage of EEG signals and video for sleep stages classification.\n\nReference markers found: [14]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]14: network (MRCNN).
