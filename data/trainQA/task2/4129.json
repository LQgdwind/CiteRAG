      "content": "Paper Title: EnergyMatch: Energy-based Pseudo-Labeling for Semi-Supervised Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn semi-supervised learning (SSL)   , a machine learning model is trained with (a small amount of) labeled data and (a large amount of) unlabeled data, with the goal of reducing the cost of human annotation. In recent years, the frontier of SSL has seen significant advances through pseudo-labeling 0 0 combined with consistency regularization  5 [ref]1  2 7. Pseudo-labeling, a type of self-training 1 4 technique, converts model predictions on unlabeled samples into soft or hard labels as optimization targets, while consistency regularization  5 [ref]1  2 7 trains the model to produce the same pseudo-label for two different views (strong and weak augmentations) of an unlabeled sample. State-of-the-art methods rely on confidence-based thresholding 0 2 7  for pseudo-labeling, in which only the unlabeled samples whose predicted class confidence surpasses a very high threshold (e.g., 0.95) are pseudo-labeled for training. While this typically leads to high precision in the pseudo-labels, it can lead to low recall, especially in low-data settings (e.g., for rare classes in the imbalanced scenario 6). More critically, prior studies 4 7  have shown that softmax-based confidence scores in deep networks can be arbitrarily high for samples that are far from the training data — thus, in the SSL setting, the pseudo-label for any unlabeled sample that is far from the labeled training data may be unreliable, even if the model’s confidence for it is very high. Figure 1 illustrates such an example. In this work, we present a novel perspective for pseudo-labeling in SSL. Instead of relying on a model’s prediction confidence to decide whether to pseudo-label an unlabeled instance or not, we propose to view the pseudo-labeling decision as an evolving in-distribution vs. out-of-distribution classification problem. Specifically, we treat instances that are close to the current training distribution—and hence likely to have more reliable predictions—as “in-distribution”, and those that are far—and hence likely to have unreliable predictions—as “out-of-distribution”.111Note that our definition of out-of-distribution is different from the typical definition from the Out-of-Distribution literature that constitutes unseen classes. At the beginning of training, only the unlabeled instances that are close to the initial labeled data will be treated as “in-distribution”. As training progresses, more and more unlabeled instances are pseudo-labeled. The in-distribution vs. out-of-distribution boundary will evolve to be jointly shaped by both the initial labeled samples as well as the unlabeled samples that are pseudo-labeled up to that point. Thus, unlabeled instances that were previously predicted to be out-of-distribution, could now be predicted as in-distribution as the distribution of the (pseudo-)labeled training data is continuously updated and expanded. To determine whether an unlabeled sample is in-distribution or out-of-distribution, we leverage the energy score  for its simplicity and good empirical performance. The energy score is a non-probabilistic scalar that is derived from a model’s output and theoretically aligned with the probability density of a data sample—lower/higher energy reflects data with higher/lower likelihood of occurrence following the training distribution, and has been shown to be useful for conventional out-of-distribution (OOD) detection 3. In our SSL setting, at each training iteration, we compute the energy score for each unlabeled sample and pseudo-label it if its energy is below a certain threshold. If it is, then we choose its pseudo-label to be the predicted class made by the model. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to consider pseudo-labeling in SSL from an in-distribution vs. out-distribution perspective. Our energy-based pseudo-labeling can easily replace vanilla confidence-based pseudo-labeling in any SSL framework. When integrated into FixMatch 2, our method performs significantly better than standard confidence-based pseudo-labeling methods when the training data is imbalanced across categories, which we believe better reflects real-world data distributions. For example, our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4-6% absolute accuracy on long-tailed CIFAR10 [ref]17 when the imbalance ratio between the head class and tail class is greater than 50. When combining our energy-based pseudo-labeling with ABC 1, a method designed specifically for the long-tailed SSL setting, our approach still shows noticeable improvement, which demonstrates its generalizability to different SSL frameworks. Finally, on standard SSL benchmarks (CIFAR10/CIFAR100 [ref]17, STL-10 , and SVHN 6) where training data is mostly balanced across the categories, our method shows either comparable or better performance compared to highly-competitive baselines. This is in contrast to the existing SSL literature, in which an SSL method either performs well in the balanced or imbalanced setting, but not both.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: with the goal of reducing the cost of human annotation.
