      "content": "Paper Title: A Unified Model for Recommendation with Selective Neighborhood Modeling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, deep learning has been widely applied in recommendation due to its immense success in many research areas such as computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing [ref]37. Some works [ref]38 propose to boost recommendation performance by exploiting different neural network structures. He et al.  combines generalized matrix factorization and multilayer perceptrons into a unified Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) framework for modeling user-item interactions. NCF is also the state-of-the-art recommendation model that is mainly based on user-item historical records. To comprehensively explore the user-item interactions, He et al.  propose Neural Factorization Machines (NFM) to model higher-order and non-linear feature interactions. Collaborative denoising autoencoders (CDAE) [ref]40 incorporates user-specific bias into an antoencoder for recommendation, and it is proved to be able to generalize many existing collaborative filtering methods. As those aforementioned works mainly rely on user-item interactions, they suffer from data sparseness  as a user usually give few ratings compared to the large item set. To this end, many research    propose to exploit additional knowledge about the users/items to mitigate data sparseness. For example, Zhang et al.  employ Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract local features representations from the reviews, and utilize Factorization Machines to capture high-order interactions between representations of users and items. Wang et al.  use pre-trained CNNs model to exploit visual content from images, and integrate those visual features for recommending point of interest. In , the authors leverage the effective representation learning of deep learning techniques, and propose a model that jointly performs users/items representation learning from side information and collaborative filtering from rating matrix. Meng et al.  exploit positive and negative emotions on reviews for recommendation products inspiring the fact that emotions on reviews have strong indication of user preferences. One drawback of those works is that they require side information, and it is not always effective for learning informative user/item latent factors.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: Recently, deep learning has been widely applied in recommendation due to its immense success in many research areas such as computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing [ref]37.
