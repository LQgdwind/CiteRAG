      "content": "Paper Title: Cascade-DETR: Delving into High-Quality Universal Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare Cascade-DETR with the state-of-the-art object detection methods on COCO, UVO, Cityscapes and our constructed UDB10 benchmark. We integrate Cascade-DETR on three representative methods [ref]24 [ref]29 , and find that Cascade-DETR attains consistent large gains over the strong baselines. COCO \nTable 8 compares Cascade-DETR with state-of-the-art object detection methods on COCO benchmark. By integrating with SOTA DETR-based detectors, Cascade-DETR achieves consistent improvement on different backbones with negligible increase in model parameters, demonstrating its effectiveness by outperforming DN-Def-DETR [ref]24 by 2.1 AP and 2.4 AP respectively on R50 and R101 backbone.\nCascade-DETR consistently attains larger increase in the strict AP75 than the loose AP50, which reveals our advantages in predicted box quality.\nUsing R50 as backbone, we also compare Cascade-DINO to DINO  by replacing its deformable attention  in the transformer decoder by our cascade attention. Cascade-DINO outperforms DINO by 1.0 AP75 with a much simpler attention design, removing the necessity for predicting 2D anchor points and sampling offsets. UVO and Cityscapes \nTable 9 tabulates the results on UVO benchmark, and Table 10 tabulates the results on Cityscapes benchmark. Cascade-DETR achieves the best 28.4 AP on UVO, where\nour approach significantly surpasses the strong baselines DN-DETR [ref]24 and DAB-DETR [ref]29, respectively with a large margin of 8.7 and 7.5 points in AP75.\nThe significant increase in AP75 is also consistent on Cityscapes. Comparing to our baseline DN-DETR, in Table 10, Cascade-DN-DETR substantially improves the AP75 from 15.7 to 28.4. UDB10 Benchmark \nTable 11 shows the detailed results comparison between Faster R-CNN [ref]35, DN-DETR [ref]24 and our Cascade-DN-DETR on the constructed UDB10 benchmark.\nWe compute UniAP as the mean of AP scores for each individual dataset component, where Cascade-DN-DETR obtains the highest 44.2 AP by improving the baseline performance for 5.7 AP and outperforms Faster R-CNN by 2.9 AP under the same R-50 backbone. The significant advancements reveal the generalizability of our approaches, without requiring any domain adaptation designs. For the six task-specific and small-scale datasets in UDB10, we further compare model finetuning results by taking their corresponding COCO pretrained model as initialization. We find that the result of Faster R-CNN with COCO pretraining only has a slight increase in most dataset components. However, the COCO finetuning is much more crucial for DETR-based approaches. For example, with COCO initialization, the AP75 of DN-Def-DETR on Paintings  improves drastically from 1.2 to 19.9, while Cascade-DN-Def-DETR boost from 9.0 to 21.5. However, Cascade-DN-Def-DETR still consistently outperforms the strong baseline DN-Def-DETR on all dataset components. Convergence Speed Comparison \nIn Figure 6, we provide the convergence speed comparison on four task-specific benchmarks UVO , Cityscapes , Brain tumor  and Documentparts . Note that DN-DETR has already been significantly speed up by its denoising branch during training. Our Cascade-DN-DETR outperforms the strong baseline DN-DETR across all datasets by a significant margin at various training stages, and converges much faster.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: We compare Cascade-DETR with the state-of-the-art object detection methods on COCO, UVO, Cityscapes and our constructed UDB10 benchmark.
