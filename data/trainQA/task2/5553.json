      "content": "Paper Title: On the Coherency of Quantitative Evaluation of Visual Explanations\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe focus our study on a subset of explanation methods (see Figure¬†1 for sample visualisations). These methods were chosen to be representative of the breadth of the field while at the same time being sufficiently distinct from one another. In the paragraphs below, we describe the explanation methods we studied. Gradient-based methods such as smoothgrad¬† and Integrated gradients¬†[ref]28 (IG) use the gradient ‚àÇF‚Äã(x)c/‚àÇxùêπsubscriptùë•ùëêùë•\\partial F(x)_{c}/\\partial x as a measure of relevance for each pixel. However, the gradient is often noisy and discontinuous which can lead to artifacts. To remedy this, smoothgrad uses multiple slightly perturbed images and averages their gradients, such that only the most robust signals remains. On the other hand, IG uses a discrete integration technique by interpolating between a chosen uninformative baseline and the original image to generate a more robust gradient. CAM-based methods such as Grad-CAM¬†[ref]15 use the fact that convolutional layers function as feature detectors and calculate a weighted sum of the feature maps from those convolutional layers for explanation. In this paper we only discuss Grad-CAM, which uses the mean of the gradients of the convolutional filter as weights, as it is the most widely used CAM-based method. Backpropagation-based methods such as Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)¬† backpropagate a relevance score to the pixel level using different rules that determine how relevance is distributed between layers. Perturbation-based methods such as (Sliding window) occlusion¬†[ref]21 and RISE¬† generate explanations by perturbing parts of the input image with uninformative pixels and calculating the difference in prediction score of the perturbed image and the original image. This score difference is then used as a measure of importance of the perturbed part. To generate an explanation, an image is perturbed for a large number of iterations such that each pixel in the image is perturbed at least once. Occlusion accomplishes this by using a sliding window, while RISE uses a large amount of upsampled random masks generated from a Poisson distribution. A special case is SISE¬†, as this method combines aspects of CAM-based methods, backpropagation-based methods and perturbation-based methods. SISE can be classified as a variant of RISE, but rather than using random masks, it uses upsampled feature maps from within the model as masks. The feature maps that are used are selected based on the mean gradient for the feature map. In this paper, we consider an extension called AdaSISE , which adaptively sets the threshold on which feature maps are used as masks. Attention-based methods such as TAME¬† train an attention mechanism on top of the feature maps generated by a classification model to accurately generate explanations maps. In the case of TAME, this is enabled by a custom loss function that combines Cross Entropy, an area-based loss, and a variation loss to generate high-quality explanations.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: same time being sufficiently distinct from one another.
