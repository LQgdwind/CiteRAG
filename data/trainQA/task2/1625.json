      "content": "Paper Title: Better Call the Plumber: Orchestrating Dynamic Information Extraction Pipelines\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn last one decade, publicly available KGs (DBpedia  and Wikidata  ) have become rich sources of structured content used in various applications, including Question Answering (QA), fact checking, and dialog systems  .\nThe research community developed numerous approaches to extract triple statements 4, keywords/topics , tables 5 3 2, or entities [ref]35 [ref]36 from unstructured text to complement KGs. Despite extensive research, public KGs are not exhaustive and require continuous effort to align newly emerging unstructured information to the concepts of the KGs. \nResearch Problem: This work was motivated by an observation of recent approaches [ref]35 5  that automatically align unstructured text to structured data on the Web. Such approaches are not viable in practice for extracting and structuring information because they only address very specific subtasks of the overall KG information extraction problem. If we consider the exemplary sentence Rembrandt painted The Storm on the Sea of Galilee. It was painted in 1633. (cf. Figure 1). To extract statements aligned with the DBpedia KG from the given sentences, a system must first recognize the entities and relation surface forms in the first sentence. The second sentence requires an additional step of the coreference resolution, where It must be mapped to the correct entity surface form (namely, The Storm on the Sea of Galilee). The last step requires the mapping of entity and relation surface forms to the respective DBpedia entities and predicates.\nThere has been extensive research in aligning concepts in unstructured text to KG, including entity linking  , relation linking [ref]36  , and triple classification .\nHowever, these efforts are disjoint, and little has been done to align unstructured text to the complete KG triples (i.e., represented as subject, predicate, object) 5. Furthermore, many entity and relation linking tools have been reused in pipelines of QA systems  6. The literature suggests that once different approaches put forward by the research community are combined, the resulting pipeline-oriented integrated systems can outperform monolithic end-to-end systems 7.\nFor the KG information extraction task, however, to the best of our knowledge, approaches aiming at dynamically integrating and orchestrating various existing components do not exist. \nObjective and Contributions: Based on these observations, we build a framework that enables the integration of previously disjoint efforts on the KG-IE task under a single umbrella.\nWe present the Plumber framework (cf. Figure 2) for creating Information Extraction pipelines. Plumber integrates 33 reusable components released by the research community for the subtasks entity linking (EL), relation linking (RL), text triple extraction (TE) (subject, predicate, object), and coreference resolution (CR). Overall, there are 264 different composable KG information extraction pipelines (generated by the possible combination of the available 33 components, i.e., for DBpedia 3 CRs, 8 TEs, 10 EL/RLs gives 3*8*10=240, and 4*3*2=24 for the ORKG. Hence, 240+24=264 pipelines). Plumber implements a transformer-based classification algorithm that intelligently chooses the best pipeline based on the unstructured input text. We perform an exhaustive evaluation of Plumber on the two large-scale KGs DBpedia, and Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) 4 to investigate the efficacy of Plumber in creating KG triples from unstructured text. We demonstrate that independent of the underlying KG; Plumber can find and assemble different extraction components to produce better suited KG triple extraction pipelines, significantly outperforming existing baselines.\nIn summary, we provide the following novel contributions: i) The Plumber framework is the first of its kind for dynamically assembling and evaluating information extraction pipelines based on sequence classification techniques and for a given input text. Plumber is easily extensible and configurable, thus enabling the rapid creation and adjustment of new information extraction components and pipelines. Researchers can also use the framework for running IE components independently for specific subtasks such as triple extraction and entity linking. ii) A collection of 33 reusable IE components that can be combined to create 264 distinct IE pipelines. iii) The exhaustive evaluation and our detailed ablation study of the integrated components and composed pipelines on various input text will guide future research for collaborative KG information extraction. We motivate our work with a running example; the sentence Rembrandt painted The Storm on the Sea of Galilee. It was painted in 1633.\nMultiple steps are required to extract these formally represented statements from the given text.\nFirst, the pronoun it in the second sentence should be replaced by The Storm on the Sea of Galilee using a coreference resolver.\nNext, a triple extractor should extract the correct text triples from the natural language text,\ni.e., <Rembrandt, painted, The Storm on the Sea of Galilee>, and <The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, painted in, 1633>.\nIn the next step, the entity and relation linking component aligns the entity and relation surface forms extracted in the previous step to the DBpedia entities: dbr:Rembrandt for Rembrandt van Rijn, and dbr:The_Storm_on_the_Sea_of_Galilee for The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, and for relations: dbo:Artist for painted, and dbp:year for painted in. Figure 1 illustrates our running example and shows three Plumber IE pipelines with different results.\nIn Pipeline 1, the coreference resolver is unable to map the pronoun it to the respective entity in the previous sentence.\nMoreover, the triple extractor generates incomplete triples, which also hinders the task of the entity and relation linker in the last step.\nPipeline 2 uses a different set of components, and its output differs from the first pipeline.\nHere, the coreference resolution component is able to correctly co-relate the pronoun it to The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, and extract the text triple correctly. However, the overall result is only partially correct because the second triple is not extracted.\nAlso, the linking component is not able to spot the second entity.\nPipeline 3 correctly extracts both triples. This pipeline employs the same component as the second pipeline for coreference resolution but also includes an additional information extraction component (i.e., ReVerb ) and a joint entity and relation linking component, namely Falcon [ref]35. With this combination of components, the text triple extractors were able to compensate for the loss of information in the second pipeline by adding one more component. Using the extracted text triples, the last component of the pipeline, a joint entity and relation linking tool, can map both triple components correctly to the corresponding KG entities. The reminder of this article is organized as follows. Related work is reviewed in Section 2. Section 3 presents Plumber, which is extensively evaluated in Section 4. Section 5 discusses the results, and Section 6 concludes and outlines directions for future research and work.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: Question Answering (QA), fact checking, and dialog systems  .\nThe research community developed numerous approaches to extract triple statements 4, keywords/topics , tables 5 3 2, or entities [ref]35 [ref]36 from unstructured text to complement KGs.
