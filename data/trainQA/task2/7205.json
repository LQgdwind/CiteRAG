      "content": "Paper Title: Deep Efficient Private Neighbor Generation for Subgraph Federated Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph data mining, one of the most important research domains for knowledge discovery, has been revolutionized by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which have established state-of-the-art performance in various domains such as social platforms , e-commerce 4, transportation 7, bioinformatics [ref]42, and healthcare .\nThe power of GNNs benefits from training on real-world graphs with millions to billions of nodes and links .\nNowadays, emerging graph data from many realistic applications, such as recommendation, drug discovery, and infectious disease surveillance, are naturally fragmented, forming distributed graphs of multiple “data silos”. Moreover, due to the increasing concerns about data privacy and regulatory restrictions, directly transferring and sharing local data to construct the entire global graph for GNN training is unrealistic . Please refer to detailed related work in Appendix C. Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm for distributed machine learning that addresses the data isolation problem, which has recently received increasing attention in various applications . Despite its successful applications in domains like computer vision  and natural language processing  where data samples (i.e., images or documents) hardly interact with each other, FL over graph data manifests unique challenges due to the complex node dependencies, structural patterns, and feature-link correlations  .\nIn this work, we focus on one of the most common and challenging scenarios of federated learning over distributed subgraphs (subgraph FL), where clients hold subgraphs of largely disjoint sets of nodes and their respective links, as shown in Fig. 1 (b) and (c). One unique challenge in subgraph FL is the incomplete neighborhood of nodes in the local subgraphs caused by cross-subgraph missing neighbors, that is, potential neighboring nodes captured by other local subgraphs. This phenomenon cannot be properly handled by generic FL mechanisms such as FedAvg for GNN training.\nTargeting this limitation, Zhang et al. propose FedSage , where a missing neighbor generator is collaboratively learned across clients to retrieve cross-subgraph missing neighbors and better approximate GNN training on the entire global graph (Fig. 1 (d))111For simplicity, we refer to FedSage+ in  as FedSage.. FedSage’s success justifies the necessity of completing information in local neighborhoods.\nYet it has several deficiencies in complex and sensitive real-world scenarios, regarding utility, efficiency, and privacy. Limited Utility. The missing neighbor generator in FedSage can only recover 1-hop missing neighbors and does not further propagate their features to other neighboring nodes. As illustrated in Fig. 1 (e), for predictions where neighbors further than 1 hop away are important, the model will fail. Such limitation is verified by the limited performance gain of FedSage+ over vanilla FedSage without neighbor generator in  as well as our empirical results in Table 2. Significant Overhead.\nThe FL training of missing neighbor generators in FedSage incurs substantial inter-client communication costs (Step I in Fig. 1 (d)), in addition to the standard client-server communication in FL (Step III), and heavy intra-client computations (Step II). Specifically, for each FL iteration, each client needs to broadcast the generated node embeddings to all other clients and receive training gradients for the neighbor generator in Step I, and each client needs to repeatedly search across its entire node set to find the most likely cross-subgraph missing neighbors in Step III. Other existing studies, such as FedGraph  and Lumos, request the central server to manage the FL process with auxiliary data, which induce unneglectable communication and computation overhead. Privacy Concerns. For subgraph FL, FedSage shares GNN gradients and node embeddings instead of raw data, but without specific privacy protection, the gradients and embeddings directly computed from raw data are prone to privacy leakage, such as via inference attacks   and reconstruction attacks  .\nUnlike FedSage, FedGNN 9 and FedGSL  protect privacy for FL over graphs via noise injection  .\nFedGSL lacks discussions on the privacy protection of graph properties, while FedGNN requests an additional authority to guarantee privacy, which is not available in general subgraph FL. Herein, we propose Subgraph Federated Learning with Deep Efficient Private Neighbor Generation (FedDEP) to address the unique utility, efficiency, and privacy challenges in the subgraph FL setting. Utility-wise: Deep Neighbor Generation and Embedding-fused Graph Convolution (DGen).\nTo enhance the modeling of cross-subgraph missing neighbors in the system without exponentially increasing computation and communication overheads, we propose a deep neighbor generator, DGen. It generates missing neighbors in depth, by leveraging GNN embeddings of generated neighbors. The generated embeddings contain information from the target node’s multiple hops of neighbors  5 and include richer context beyond single node features generated in FedSage.\nTo incorporate the generated deep neighbors into the global GNN classifier training, we propose a novel embedding-fused graph convolution process. Efficiency-wise: Deep Embedding Prototyping and Pseudo-FL (Proto).\nTo reduce the intra-client computation, we cluster the local GNN embeddings of nodes in each client to construct sets of missing neighbor prototypes. Instead of repeated exhaustive searches for closest neighbors across a client’s entire node set as in FedSage, we can find the closest prototypes across the much smaller prototype sets.\nTo further reduce the inter-client communication, we propose pseudo-FL by sharing the prototype embeddings across the system before the training of DGen. Thus, clients can conduct closest neighbor searches locally without communications while still achieving FL for DGen. Similarly to 4, sharing the prototype embeddings instead of node embeddings can also lead to empirical privacy benefits due to the difficulty in inference attacks from aggregated models. Privacy-wise: Noise-free differential privacy through random sampling (NFDP). We aim to theoretically guarantee rigorous edge-local-differential-privacy (edge-LDP), which protects edges’ existence within local node’s neighborhoods in distributed subgraphs . Particularly, we achieve noise-free edge-LDP by transferring noise-free differential privacy from general domains 3 to edge-LDP, without embracing complicated cryptology techniques, explicitly perturbing shared data, or introducing additional roles into the system as previous work 9. Technically, we incorporate two stages of random sampling into FedDEP, i.e., (1) mini-batching: random neighborhood sampling in each graph convolution layer 3; and (2) Bernoulli-based generation selection: randomly sampling generated deep neighbors by a Bernoulli sampler in DGen. Extensive experiments on four real-world graph datasets justify the utility, efficiency, and privacy benefits of FedDEP.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: been revolutionized by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which have established state-of-the-art performance in various domains such as social platforms , e-commerce 4, transportation 7, bioinformatics [ref]42, and healthcare .\nThe power of GNNs benefits from training on real-world graphs with millions to billions of nodes and links .\nNowadays, emerging graph data from many realistic applications,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
