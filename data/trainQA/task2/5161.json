      "content": "Paper Title: A Unified Framework for Contrastive Learning from a Perspective of Affinity Matrix\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWith the goal of learning effective visual representations without human supervision, self-supervised learning (SSL), especially the contrastive learning based SSL, has attracted increasing attention in recent years  3  [ref]7 2   1  . A variety of SSL methods have been proposed and significantly advanced the progress of unsupervised visual representation learning. Typically, these methods could be roughly divided into four categories: (1) standard contrastive SSL, (2) non-contrastive SSL, (3) whitening regularization based SSL, and (4) consistency regularization based SSL, where the latter two can be easily integrated with the former two. Specifically, standard contrastive SSL methods, such as MoCo 3  and SimCLR , normally maximize the agreement between two different augmentations of the same image, i.e., a positive pair, by simultaneously contrasting a lot of different images, i.e., many negative pairs. Generally, such a kind of method requires either a large memory bank or a large batch size to achieve excellent performance. In contrast, the non-contrastive SSL methods, such as SwAV , BYOL 2 and SimSiam [ref]7, try to discard the massive negative pairs and instead only maximize the similarity between positive pairs. To avoid the collapse problem for not using negative pairs, different asymmetric designs are commonly used, such as asymmetric embedding network (e.g., additional predictor network) 2 [ref]7, momentum encoder 2, non-differentiable operators (e.g., clustering with Sinkhorm-Knopp algorithm ) , and stop-gradients 2 [ref]7. Similarly, the whitening regularization based SSL methods, such as W-MSE , Barlow Twins 1 and VICReg , employ whitening with a decorrelation operation to avoid the collapse representations in the non-contrastive SSL without requiring asymmetric designs. Different from the above three kinds of methods, consistency regularization based SSL methods, such as CO2 , use a semi-supervised consistency regularization to alleviate the problem of false negatives caused by the use of the instance discrimination pretext task. In this paper, we propose a simple UNIfied Contrastive Learning Representation framework, called UniCLR, to unify the above four kinds of SSL methods to the maximum extent. The motivation is that although these methods are different in terms of their motivations or the employed techniques, they are essentially closely related to each other. From a new perspective of affinity matrix, we notice that these methods can be unified into a single and much simpler framework. That is to say, most of the existing SSL methods would be a special case or variant of this framework. Based on the UniCLR framework, we first present a simple yet effective baseline, SimAffinity, by directly optimizing the affinity matrix of two different views of the same mini-batch with the cross-entropy loss. After that, we propose a simple whitening based baseline based on SimAffinity, named SimWhitening, by incorporating the whitening operation. Moreover, based on SimWhitening, we further design a novel non-contrastive SSL method, named SimTrace, by directly optimizing the trace of a whitened affinity matrix. In particular, SimTrace does not rely on asymmetry designs or regularization terms to avoid the collapse problem. In addition, we propose a new symmetric consistency regularization loss by symmetrizing the affinity matrix, which can significantly accelerate the convergence of unsupervised SSL models. To verify the effectiveness and scalability of this new framework, we conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K 0 and three small benchmark datasets, including multiple ablation studies to investigate the major components of UniCLR. Importantly, as a unified framework, our UniCLR can be flexibly integrated with some specific tricks, such as momentum encoder 2 and multi-crop , to achieve new state-of-the-art results on ImageNet-1K. Also, all the variants of UniCLR can obtain competitive or even much better results than the corresponding SSL methods. Specifically, under the linear evaluation protocol, SimAffinity achieves 73.8%percent73.873.8\\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with 200-epoch training, which is a 3.2%percent3.23.2\\% absolute improvement over BYOL 2. In summary, our main contributions are as follows: We present UniCLR, a unified contrastive learning framework, to represent multiple different kinds of SSL methods. In addition, three new variants derived from UniCLR, especially SimAffinity, can achieve superior results over the state of the art. We propose SimTrace, a novel non-contrastive SSL method built on UniCLR, by optimizing the affinity matrix through a trace operation. Theoretical analysis is provided to show that the affinity matrix and covariance matrix can be simultaneously constrained with a single loss term. We propose a new symmetric consistency regularization loss on the affinity matrix, which can significantly accelerate the convergence of models and boost the performance by alleviating the issue of false negatives. We comprehensively demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the newly designed variants on multiple benchmarks, and provide new strong baselines for SSL.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: effective visual representations without human supervision, self-supervised learning (SSL), especially the contrastive learning based SSL, has attracted increasing attention in recent years  3  [ref]7 2   1  .
