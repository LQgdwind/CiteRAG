      "content": "Paper Title: Monte Carlo Tree Search based Variable Selection for High Dimensional Bayesian Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn many real-world tasks such as neural architecture search (NAS)¬† and policy search in reinforcement learning (RL)¬†[ref]6, one often needs to solve the expensive black-box optimization problems. Bayesian optimization (BO)¬† [ref]11 3 [ref]32 is a sample-efficient algorithm for solving such problems. It iteratively fits a surrogate model, typically Gaussian process (GP), and maximizes an acquisition function to obtain the next point to evaluate. While BO has been employed in a wide variety of settings, successful applications are often limited to low-dimensional problems. Recently, scaling BO to high-dimensional problems has received a lot of interest. Decomposition-based methods¬†   6  assume that the high-dimensional function to be optimized has a certain structure, typically the additive structure. By decomposing the original high-dimensional function into the sum of several low-dimensional functions, they optimize each low-dimensional function to obtain the point in the high-dimensional space. However, it is not easy to decide whether a decomposition exists as well as to learn the decomposition. Other methods often assume that the original high-dimensional function with dimension Dùê∑D has a low-dimensional subspace with dimension d‚â™Dmuch-less-thanùëëùê∑d\\ll D, and then perform the optimization in the low-dimensional subspace and project the low-dimensional point back for evaluation. For example, embedding-based methods¬†0 7  use a random matrix to embed the original space into the low-dimensional subspace. Another way is to select a subset of variables directly, which can even avoid the time-consuming matrix operations of embedding-based methods. For example, Dropout¬†1 selects dùëëd variables randomly in each iteration. Note that for both embedding and variable selection methods, the parameter dùëëd can have a large influence on the performance, which is, however, difficult to set in real-world problems. In this paper, we propose a new Variable Selection method using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), called MCTS-VS. MCTS is employed to partition the variables into important and unimportant ones, and only those selected important variables are optimized via any black-box optimization algorithm, e.g., vanilla BO¬†[ref]32 or TuRBO¬†. The values of unimportant variables are sampled using historical information. Compared with Dropout-BO, MCTS-VS can select important variables automatically. We also provide regret and computational complexity analyses of general variable selection methods, showing that variable selection can reduce the computational complexity while increasing the cumulative regret. Our regret bound generalizes that of GP-UCB¬† which always selects all variables, as well as that of Dropout¬†1 which selects dùëëd variables randomly in each iteration. The results suggest that a good variable selection method should select as important variables as possible. Experiments on high-dimensional synthetic functions and real-world problems (i.e., NAS and RL problems) show that MCTS-VS is better than the previous variable selection method Dropout¬†1, and can also achieve the competitive performance to state-of-the-art BO algorithms. Furthermore, its running time is small due to the advantage of variable selection. We also observe that MCTS-VS can select important variables, explaining its good performance based on our theoretical analysis.\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: In many real-world tasks such as neural architecture search (NAS)¬† and policy search in reinforcement learning (RL)¬†[ref]6, one often needs to solve the expensive black-box optimization problems.
