      "content": "Paper Title: Compacting Deep Neural Networks for Internet of Things: Methods and Applications\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAI may have come on in leaps and bounds in the last few years, but it still has a distance away from real intelligence, which is expected to reason and make decisions like humans. DL is a type of ML and AI, which imitates the way humans obtain specific knowledge. Normally, DL algorithms are stacked with increasingly complex and abstract hierarchical structures. By using DL, the process of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting large amounts of data becomes faster and easier. The success of DL is mainly attributed to ANNs, which consist of a number of bionic neurons similar to millions of neurons in a human brain¬†. Neural networks mimic the way that human brains achieve perception, recognition, and inference. The early design of ANNs limits ANN to a three-layer structure: one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer. DNN that further extends an ANN has multiple hidden layers between the input layer and the output layer, where ‚Äúdeep‚Äù means the multiple hidden layers. Similar to ANNs, DNNs can also fit complex nonlinear relationships. DNNs can be roughly categorized into the following types: CNNs, RNNs, and other types of DNNs. 1) CNN: CNNs were initially proposed by LeCun et al.¬†. The emergence of AlexNet¬† in 2012 was regarded as the Renaissance of neural networks and the rise of DL. CNN mainly contains convolutional layers and sub-sampling layers. In the convolutional layer, neurons only connect to some adjacent neurons, as in Fig.¬†2(a). This sparse connection reduces a large number of parameters and the risk of overfitting¬†[ref]12. The convolutional layer usually contains several feature maps. Each feature map is composed of neurons with shared weights arranged in a rectangle. The convolution kernel is usually initialized with a random decimal matrix. Sub-sampling can be regarded as a special convolution process, also called pooling. Its function is to reduce the number of parameters in the feature maps and use a feature value to represent a small area. Convolution and sub-sampling work together to reduce model complexity and parameters. Generally, CNN consists of three parts: 1) input layer, 2) a combination of nùëõn convolutional layers and pooling layers, 3) a fully connected multi-layer perceptron classifier. Some classic CNN structures include AlexNet¬†, Visual Geometry Group (VGG)¬†[ref]13, GoogleNet¬†[ref]14, and ResNet¬†. 2) RNN: Many practical applications deal with different types of data such as text, voice, and video, all of which are nearly related. Moreover, the network‚Äôs output is related to the input at current time and connected to one or more previous outputs at a specific time. Traditional neural networks cannot handle this temporal relation. Another problem is that both the input and output data formats of traditional neural networks are fixed. In contrast, some practical problems, such as machine translation, require variable-length input and output data. Therefore, a more robust model is needed to solve this problem. RNNs can solve this problem since a neuron in RNNs can receive the information from both the top layer and the previous RNN unit¬†, as in Fig.¬†2(b). Commonly-used RNN methods are multi-layer RNN, bidirectional RNN, and recursive neural network. Other variants of RNNs include Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)¬† and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).¬†. 3) Other DNNs: DNN has some other novel network structures while we only introduce the two most representatives of them. Hinton proposed Deep Belief Networks (DBNs)¬† in 2006. A DBN is a generative model that can express an in-depth representation of training data and its structure, consisting of multiple restricted Boltzmann machines. DBNs are usually used as a pre-trained component of other DNNs and consequently form many neural networks based on DBNs. The typical example is convolutional DBNs. The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)¬† proposed by Goodfellow is also a variant of DNN. A GAN is composed of two models: a discriminative model and a generative model. The responsibility of the discriminative model is to differentiate the real data and the created data accurately. The generative model‚Äôs role is to generate new data that is sufficiently similar to the real data. At present, GANs mainly devote to computer vision and natural language processing, such as improving image resolution, restoring occlusion images, and generating images based on text descriptions. The literature¬† introduced GANs in adversarial-image forensics.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: layers.
