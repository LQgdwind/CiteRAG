      "content": "Paper Title: Parameterized Algorithms for Diverse Multistage Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe present a general framework which allows us to prove fixed-parameter tractability of Diverse Multistage ΠΠ\\Pi parameterized by the diversity ℓℓ\\ell for several problems ΠΠ\\Pi.\nThis includes finding diverse matchings,\nbut also diverse commitees (answering an open question by Bredereck et al. ),\ndiverse s𝑠s-t𝑡t paths, and diverse independent sets in matroids such as spanning forests.\nFinally, we show that similar results cannot be expected for finding diverse vertex covers. Generally, our framework can be applied to Diverse Multistage ΠΠ\\Pi whenever one can solve a 444-colored variant of ΠΠ\\Pi efficiently.\nFormally, this variant is defined as follows. 4-Colored Exact ΠΠ\\Pi\n\n\n\n\nInput:\n\n\nAn instance I𝐼I of ΠΠ\\Pi, a coloring c:ℬ​(I)→:𝑐→ℬ𝐼delimited-[]4c\\colon\\mathcal{B}(I)\\rightarrow, and ni∈ℕ0,i∈formulae-sequencesubscript𝑛𝑖subscriptℕ0𝑖delimited-[]4n_{i}\\in\\mathbb{N}_{0},i\\in.\n\n\nOutput:\n\n\nA solution S∈ℛ​(I)𝑆ℛ𝐼S\\in{\\mathcal{R}({I})} such that |{x∈S∣c​(x)=i}|=niconditional-set𝑥𝑆𝑐𝑥𝑖subscript𝑛𝑖\\lvert\\{x\\in S\\mid c(x)=i\\}\\rvert=n_{i} for all i∈𝑖delimited-[]4i\\in\nor “no” if no solution exists.\n\n\n Our main result reads as follows. If an instance I𝐼I of 4-Colored Exact ΠΠ\\Pi can be solved in f​(r)⋅|I|O​(1)⋅𝑓𝑟superscript𝐼𝑂1f(r)\\cdot|I|^{O(1)} time,\nthen an instance J𝐽J of Diverse Multistage ΠΠ\\Pi of size n𝑛n can be solved in 2O​(ℓ)⋅f​(rmax)⋅|J|O​(1)⋅⋅superscript2𝑂ℓ𝑓subscript𝑟superscript𝐽𝑂12^{O(\\ell)}\\cdot f(r_{\\max})\\cdot\\lvert J\\rvert^{O(1)} time,\nwhere rmaxsubscript𝑟r_{\\max} is the maximum of parameter r𝑟r over all instances of ΠΠ\\Pi in J𝐽J.111For example, if the input is a sequence of graphs and r𝑟r is the treewidth, then rmaxsubscript𝑟r_{\\max} is the maximum treewidth over all graphs in the input. We prove Theorem 1.1 in Section 3 in a more general form which also allows solving 4-Colored Exact ΠΠ\\Pi by a Monte Carlo algorithm.\nWe then apply our framework to the following problems: Committee Election (Section 4).\nIn Diverse Multistage Plurality Voting, we are given a set A𝐴A of agents, a set C𝐶C of candidates,\nand τ𝜏\\tau many voting profiles ui:A→C:subscript𝑢𝑖→𝐴𝐶u_{i}\\colon A\\to C.\nThe goal is to find a sequence (Ci)i=1τsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝐶𝑖𝑖1𝜏(C_{i})_{i=1}^{\\tau} of committees Ci⊆Csubscript𝐶𝑖𝐶C_{i}\\subseteq C\nsuch that each committee Cisubscript𝐶𝑖C_{i} is of size at most k𝑘k and gets at least x𝑥x votes in the voting profile uisubscript𝑢𝑖u_{i}\n(i.e., |ui−1​(Ci)|≥xsuperscriptsubscript𝑢𝑖1subscript𝐶𝑖𝑥\\lvert u_{i}^{-1}(C_{i})\\rvert\\geq x),\nand |Ci​Δ​Ci+1|≥ℓsubscript𝐶𝑖Δsubscript𝐶𝑖1ℓ\\lvert C_{i}\\Delta C_{i+1}\\rvert\\geq\\ell for all i∈[τ−1]𝑖delimited-[]𝜏1i\\in[\\tau-1].\nWe show that there is a 2𝒪​(ℓ)⋅|J|𝒪​(1)⋅superscript2𝒪ℓsuperscript𝐽𝒪12^{\\mathcal{O}(\\ell)}\\cdot\\lvert J\\rvert^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}-time algorithm to solve a Diverse Multistage Plurality Voting instance J𝐽J.\nThis answers an open question of Bredereck et al. .\nLater, in Section 7, we generalize the algorithm\nused to solve 444-Colored Exact Plurality Voting to matroids. Perfect Matching (Section 5).\nIn the multistage setting, Perfect Matching is among the problems most intensively studied [ref]26    9.\nGiven a sequence of graphs (Gi)i=1τsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝐺𝑖𝑖1𝜏(G_{i})_{i=1}^{\\tau} and an integer ℓℓ\\ell,\nDiverse Multistage Perfect Matching asks whether there is a sequence (Mi)i=1τsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑀𝑖𝑖1𝜏(M_{i})_{i=1}^{\\tau} such that\neach Misubscript𝑀𝑖M_{i} is a perfect matching in Gisubscript𝐺𝑖G_{i},\nand |Mi​Δ​Mi+1|≥ℓsubscript𝑀𝑖Δsubscript𝑀𝑖1ℓ\\lvert M_{i}\\Delta M_{i+1}\\rvert\\geq\\ell for all i∈[τ−1]𝑖delimited-[]𝜏1i\\in[\\tau-1].\nWe show that there is a randomized 2𝒪​(ℓ)⋅|J|𝒪​(1)⋅superscript2𝒪ℓsuperscript𝐽𝒪12^{\\mathcal{O}(\\ell)}\\cdot\\lvert J\\rvert^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}-time algorithm to solve a Diverse Multistage Perfect Matching instance J𝐽J with constant error probability.\nThis stands in remarkable contrast to the W-hardness of the\n(non-diverse) Multistage Perfect Matching,\nwhen parameterized by ℓ+τℓ𝜏\\ell+\\tau 9.\nTo apply our framework, we establish an algebraic algorithm using the Pfaffian of a specific variant of the Tutte matrix to solve s𝑠s-Colored Exact Perfect Matching on an n𝑛n-vertex graph\nin nO​(s)superscript𝑛𝑂𝑠n^{O(s)} time with low error probability. s𝑠s-t𝑡t Path (Section 6).\nStudying s𝑠s-t𝑡t Path in the multistage setting was already suggested in the seminal work of Gupta et al. [ref]26.\nIn Diverse Multistage s𝑠s-t𝑡t Path one is given a sequence of graphs (Gi)i=1τsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝐺𝑖𝑖1𝜏(G_{i})_{i=1}^{\\tau},\ntwo distinct vertices s𝑠s and t𝑡t, and an integer ℓℓ\\ell, and\nasks whether there is a sequence (Pi)i=1τsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑃𝑖𝑖1𝜏(P_{i})_{i=1}^{\\tau} such that\neach Pisubscript𝑃𝑖P_{i} is an s𝑠s-t𝑡t Path in Gisubscript𝐺𝑖G_{i},\nand |V​(Pi)​Δ​V​(Pi+1)|≥ℓ𝑉subscript𝑃𝑖Δ𝑉subscript𝑃𝑖1ℓ\\lvert V(P_{i})\\Delta V(P_{i+1})\\rvert\\geq\\ell for all i∈[τ−1]𝑖delimited-[]𝜏1i\\in[\\tau-1].\nFluschnik et al. [ref]22 provided a comprehensive study of finding s𝑠s-t𝑡t paths of bounded length\nin the multistage setting from the viewpoint of parameterized complexity.\nAmong other results, they showed that Diverse Multistage s𝑠s-t𝑡t Path is NP-hard\nbut fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized\nby the maximum length of an s𝑠s-t𝑡t Path in the solution.\nWe show that Diverse Multistage s𝑠s-t𝑡t Path parameterized by ℓℓ\\ell is fixed-parameter tractable.\nAt first glance, using our framework seems unpromising since 444-Colored Exact s𝑠s-t𝑡t Path can presumably not be solved in polynomial time\n(it is NP-hard by a straight-forward reduction from Hamiltonian Path).\nHowever, we develop a win/win strategy around a generalization of the Erdős-Pósa theorem for long cycles due to Mousset et al. 2\nso that we have to solve 444-Colored Exact s𝑠s-t𝑡t Path only on graphs on which the treewidth is upper-bounded in the parameter ℓℓ\\ell. In Section 8, we complement our fixed-parameter tractability results with a W-hardness for Diverse Multistage Vertex Cover\nwhen parameterized by ℓℓ\\ell.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: the algorithm\nused to solve 444-Colored Exact Plurality Voting to matroids. Perfect Matching (Section 5).\nIn the multistage setting, Perfect Matching is among the problems most intensively studied [ref]26    9.\nGiven a sequence of graphs (Gi)i=1τsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝐺𝑖𝑖1𝜏(G_{i})_{i=1}^{\\tau} and an integer ℓℓ\\ell,\nDiverse Multistage Perfect Matching asks whether there is a\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
