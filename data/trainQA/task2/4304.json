      "content": "Paper Title: Open- and Closed-Loop Neural Network Verification using Polynomial Zonotopes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile previously artificial intelligence was mainly used for soft applications such as movie recommendations , facial recognition [ref]23, or chess computers , it is now also increasingly applied in safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving , human-robot collaboration , or power system control [ref]5. In contrast to soft applications, where failures usually only have minor consequences, failures in safety-critical applications in the worst case result in loss of human lives. Consequently, in order to prevent those failures, there is an urgent need for efficient methods that can verify that the neural networks used for artificial intelligence function correctly. Verification problems involving neural networks can be grouped into two main categories: Open-loop verification: Here the task is to check if the output of the neural network for a given input set satisfies certain properties. With this setup one can for example prove that a neural network used for image classification is robust against a certain amount of noise on the image. Closed-loop verification: In this case the neural network is used as a controller for a dynamical system, e.g., to steer the system to a given goal set while avoiding unsafe regions. The safety of the controlled system can be verified using reachability analysis. For both of the above verification problems, the most challenging step is to compute a tight enclosure of the image through the neural network for a given input set. Due to the high expressiveness of neural networks, their images usually have complex shapes, so that convex enclosures are often too conservative for verification. In this work, we show how to overcome this limitation with our novel approach for computing tight non-convex enclosures of images through neural networks using polynomial zonotopes.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: While previously artificial intelligence was mainly used for soft applications such as movie recommendations , facial recognition [ref]23, or chess computers , it is now also increasingly applied in safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving , human-robot collaboration , or power system control [ref]5.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
