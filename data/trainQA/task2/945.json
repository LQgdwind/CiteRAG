      "content": "Paper Title: TabEAno: Table to Knowledge Graph Entity Annotation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThanks to the Open Data community111Open Data Vision: https://opendatabarometer.org, a large number of table resources have been made available on the Web and data portals. As a study of Lehmberg et al. , there are 233 million table resources extracted from Common Crawl July 2015222Common Crawl: http://commoncrawl.org/. Mitlohner et al. also analyze about 200,000 table resources from 232 Open Data Portals . However, the usage of such tables is limited due to the ambiguity of entities, name variations, heterogeneous schema, missing, or incomplete metadata. To improve the usability of these table data, we need to resolve the meaning of elements in a table by annotating table elements into knowledge graph concepts. The annotated tables are potentially useful for a number of applications, such as table search  9, table extension , completion, or knowledge graph construction as used in DBpedia [ref]30, YAGO , and Freebase . In this paper, we focus on the table to the knowledge graph entity annotation problem. Note that, tables in this study refer to relational vertical tables. A relational vertical table is a table that contains the core column (the core table attribute) and the attributes columns. In the core column, target entities are listed, while the other columns are the attributes using to describe each entity in the core table attribute. Typically, this problem also known as record linkage [ref]8, or data, or instance-level matching . In particular, table rows are matched into knowledge graph entities. In this study, DBpedia is used as the target knowledge graph for table rows annotation. The most common pipeline of table entity annotation has three steps: 1) structure annotation, 2) candidate generation, and 3) candidate disambiguation. Most prior works focus on the candidate disambiguation step where the best entity candidate is determined in order to achieve the best relevance score of the table row. However, TabEAno targets on improving the structure annotation and the candidate generation steps, whereas we adopt the simple aggregation to re-rank entity candidates in the candidate disambiguation step. Specifically, we improve the heuristic of the core attribute and header annotation in the structure annotation step. Regarding the candidate generation step, we propose a “two-cells” lookup strategy. In the strategy, we assume that there is an existing logical relation occurring in the knowledge graph between the two closed cells in the same row of the table. Despite the simplicity of the approach, TabEAno outperforms the other baselines approaches in terms of annotation ability in the two standard datasets e.g, T2D, Limaye, and the large-scale Wikipedia tables dataset. To sum up, the contributions of our paper are as follows: We propose new heuristic rules for core attribute annotation, and header annotation in Section 4.1. These heuristic rules improve the accuracy performance of the core attribute annotation 3% and 1% in the on T2D dataset and the Wikipedia tables dataset respectively. We introduce a novel lookup strategy, namely “two-cell” lookup for entity candidate generation step in Section 4.3. We empirically study and evaluate TabEAno on the two standard datasets e.g, T2D, Limaye, and the large-scale Wikipedia tables dataset which contains about 480 million extracted tables from Wikipedia pages Also, the repository of the TabEAno system will be made available online to further facilitate the research in this field. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the related works on the task of table entity annotation for table data, and prior approaches on table annotation approaches, and the difference between TabEAno and other prior works. In Section 3, we present the assumptions of TabEAno. Then, we present the TabEAno in Section 4. In Section 5, we describe the details of our evaluation, and experimental settings then present the results. Finally, we summarize the paper and discuss the future direction in Section 6.\n\nReference markers found: [30]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]30: graph concepts.
