      "content": "Paper Title: PINN Training using Biobjective Optimization: The Trade-off between Data Loss and Residual Loss\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nPhysics-informed neural networks (PINN) are neural networks that include the laws of dynamical systems into a deep learning framework.\nMachine learning has emerged as an alternative to numerical discretization in high-dimensional problems governed by partial differential equations.\nNonetheless, a sufficient amount of data as required for training deep neural networks is not necessarily available.\nIn such cases, missing data can be substituted by incorporating additional information obtained from enforcing the physical laws of dynamical systems [ref]33. Such laws can be described by partial or ordinary differential equations.\nOne example where dynamical systems can be used are populations undergoing transitions between different infected or uninfected states during an epidemic, as considered in this paper. PINNs can approximate the solutions of differential equations by training a loss function incorporating the initial and boundary conditions and the residual at so-called collocation points .\nInstead of approximating solutions of differential equations, PINNs can use a system of differential equations describing a certain real-world process along with time-series data sets describing the past course of such a process for the purpose of generating predicitions for future progressions. The loss function of a corresponding neural network includes not solely the so-called data error related to the difference between the output of the network and the reported data used, but also the so-called residual error related to the ODEs or PDEs. Olumoyin et al. [ref]35 refer to a type of feedforward neural network including epidemiological dynamics such as lockdown into their loss function by using the term Epidemiology-Informed Neural Network (EINN).\nEINNs extend PINNs for epidemiology models and are able to capture the dynamics of the spread of the disease and\nthe influence of the mitigation measure.\nThe loss function is enhanced to include time-varying rates using epidemiology facts about the infectious disease [ref]35. Shaier, Raissi and Seshaiyer  describe a type of PINN-based neural network that can be applied to increasingly complex systems of differential equations describing various known infectious diseases with the term Disease-Informed Neural Networks (DINN).\nDINNs can be systematically applied to increasingly complex governing systems of differential equations describing infectious diseases.\nThey are able to effectively learn the dynamics of the disease and forecast its progression a month into the future from real-life data . The neural network established and applied in this paper can be described as a special type of EINN or DINN based on a special kind of epidemic compartment model called SVIHR model regarding the susceptible, vaccinated, infected, hospitalized and recovered part of the population. We focus on the German population in this paper, using data provided by the Robert Koch-Institute   and the German COVID-19 Vaccination Dashboard . The model parameters included in (9) can be comprised in a vector ϑitalic-ϑ\\vartheta: This vector is partitioned into fixed parameters pfsubscript𝑝𝑓p_{f}, which can be estimated directly from the observed data, and learnable parameters p𝑝p, which are crucial for the dynamics of the compartment variables: We use NSFD predictions to improve the estimates for the parameters that govern the dynamics, i.e., the transmission risk β𝛽\\beta and the residual transmission probability after vaccination κ𝜅\\kappa.\nTheir values are estimated using NSFD predictions fitted to the observed data so that the predicted and observed peak values have the same magnitude.\nThis approach aims to combine the benefits from both worlds:\nThe numerical predictions that follow a physical model, and the PINN predictions that rely heavily on the observed data.\nSince the NSFD predictions can be computed very efficiently, the parameter values can be easily adapted to different virus variants and to different pandemic waves.\n We describe our PINN approach for a general compartmental model with n𝑛n compartments.\nIn the SVIHR model (9), we have n=5𝑛5n=5. Let be the normalized data vector of reported compartment sizes for l𝑙l time points, i.e. t∈{t1,…,tl}𝑡subscript𝑡1…subscript𝑡𝑙t\\in\\{t_{1},\\dots,t_{l}\\}.\nIn the application considered here, ti+1−tisubscript𝑡𝑖1subscript𝑡𝑖t_{i+1}-t_{i} is constant (and corresponds to one week) for all i=1,…,l−1𝑖1…𝑙1i=1,\\dots,l-1.\nLet T𝑇T denote an upper bound for the time window under consideration, and\nlet 𝒦p:[0,T]→ℝn:subscript𝒦𝑝→0𝑇superscriptℝ𝑛\\mathcal{K}_{p}:[0,T]\\to\\mathbb{R}^{n} denote the vector valued function reflecting the compartment sizes 𝒦p​(t)subscript𝒦𝑝𝑡\\mathcal{K}_{p}(t) over time.\nThen we express the vector of right-hand-sides values of (9) by The subscript p𝑝p stands for the learnable model parameters that the system of ODEs depends on, cf. (21), and thus the solution will depend on, too.\nThe system of ODEs in (9) can then be discretized as Our PINN is used to approximate the solution 𝒦p: →ℝn:subscript𝒦𝑝→01superscriptℝ𝑛\\mathcal{K}_{p}: \\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{n}\nof the system of ODEs (9) by performing error minimization during training [ref]37.\nThe superscript W𝑊W represents the weights used during the forward and backward propagation in the neural network.\nAt time instance t𝑡t, t∈{t1,…,tl}𝑡subscript𝑡1…subscript𝑡𝑙t\\in\\{t_{1},\\dots,t_{l}\\}, the solution is expressed as where 𝒦pj​(t)superscriptsubscript𝒦𝑝𝑗𝑡\\mathcal{K}_{p}^{j}(t) is the output of the PINN for the jt​hsuperscript𝑗𝑡ℎj^{th} compartment at time t𝑡t\nand depends on the parameter p𝑝p given by equation (21).\nThe parameters W𝑊W are optimized during the backpropagation process of the neural network such that 𝒫​ℐ​𝒩​𝒩pW𝒫ℐ𝒩superscriptsubscript𝒩pW\\operatorname{\\mathcal{PINN}_{p}^{W}} fits the reported data 𝒦^^𝒦\\hat{\\mathcal{K}} in a least-squares sense [ref]37.\nIn the it​hsuperscript𝑖𝑡ℎi^{th} time step tisubscript𝑡𝑖t_{i}, i∈{1,…,l}𝑖1…𝑙i\\in\\{1,\\dots,l\\},\nwith PINN output 𝒫​ℐ​𝒩​𝒩pW⁡(ti)𝒫ℐ𝒩superscriptsubscript𝒩pWsubscript𝑡𝑖\\operatorname{\\mathcal{PINN}_{p}^{W}}({{t_{i}}}), we compute the usual data error defined as where we employed in (23) the Euclidian norm in ℝnsuperscriptℝ𝑛\\mathbb{R}^{n}. Next, let us\nextend the loss function of the PINN by the additional term where means that the PINN solves the given ODE system more reliably by enforcing additional constraints.\nThe computation of the time derivative of the neural network output d​𝒫​ℐ​𝒩​𝒩pW⁡(t)d​t|t=tievaluated-atd𝒫ℐ𝒩superscriptsubscript𝒩pW𝑡d𝑡𝑡subscript𝑡𝑖\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\operatorname{\\mathcal{PINN}_{p}^{W}}({{t}})}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\Big{|}_{t={{t_{i}}}} can be performed using automatic differentiation .\nThen the physics-informed part of the loss function, the residual error, is given by We introduce a hyperparameter and weighting factor α∈ 𝛼01\\alpha\\in  weighting the data loss and residual loss in the loss function.\nWe define the overall loss function as and the minimization problem of the neural network as We want to note briefly that small values of the residual loss MSEℱsubscriptMSEℱ\\operatorname{\\operatorname{MSE}_{\\mathcal{F}}} do not necessarily mean that the obtained solution is close to the exact solution of (9).\nFor this, one additionally needs the well-posedness of the problem (9) and the stability of the scheme used.\nFor all implementations, the programming language Python and the deep-learning framework of PyTorch are used.\nWe used a standard network architecture with three fully connected hidden layers, each with 30 neurons, see Figure 2 for illustration.\nFor each time point t∈[0,T]𝑡0𝑇t\\in[0,T], the network returns values for all five compartment sizes in the vector 𝒦p​(t)∈ℝ5subscript𝒦𝑝𝑡superscriptℝ5\\mathcal{K}_{p}(t)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{5}.\nThe network architecture was inspired by Ben Moseley’s harmonic oscillator PINN, see , and represents a reasonable compromise in terms of network complexity. We used hyperbolic tangent activation functions and the Adam optimizer for the training.\nWe refer to  for a survey of descent methods in machine learning.\nWe also used a learning rate schedule that significantly reduces the learning rate after about 50%percent5050\\,\\% of training iterations.\nMore specifically, the learning rate t​(κ)𝑡𝜅t(\\kappa) in iteration κ∈{1,…,κmax}𝜅1…subscript𝜅max\\kappa\\in\\{1,\\dots,\\kappa_{\\text{max}}\\} is given by where tstartsubscript𝑡startt_{\\text{start}} and tendsubscript𝑡endt_{\\text{end}} denote the initial and final learning rates, respectively.\nIn our experiments, we used tstart=0.003subscript𝑡start0.003t_{\\text{start}}=0.003 and tend=0.00015subscript𝑡end0.00015t_{\\text{end}}=0.00015.\nFigure 3 shows the learning rate schedule for κmax=1000subscript𝜅max1000\\kappa_{\\text{max}}=1000 iterations. The data loss was evaluated with data sets obtained from the RKI   and the German Vaccination Dashboard .\nThese data were preprocessed and rescaled to unit intervals before calculating the data loss MSE𝒰subscriptMSE𝒰\\operatorname{\\operatorname{MSE}_{\\mathcal{U}}}.\nSince this leads to a corresponding rescaling of the PINN predictions 𝒦psubscript𝒦𝑝\\mathcal{K}_{p}, the corresponding scaling factors were also included in the ODE system (9) when evaluating MSEℱsubscriptMSEℱ\\operatorname{\\operatorname{MSE}_{\\mathcal{F}}}. The data refers to the calendar weeks 10 in 2020 to 14 in 2022. Weekly case-hospitalization,\ncase-fatality and vaccination rates were computed based on the given data sets.\nThe RKI registers deceased individuals, in whom the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen was detected, as people who died from COVID-19.
