Regarding the task of fovea localization, existing research can be broadly categorized into two primary domains: regression and segmentation. Many deep learning-based methods formulate fovea localization as a regression task. Al-Bander et al.  and Huang et al.  propose a two-step regression approach, initially predicting the ROI and subsequently inputting them into neural networks for fovea center localization. Meyer et al.  and Bhatkalkar et al. [ref]27 employ pixel-wise distance or heatmap regression approaches to jointly localize the OD and fovea. Xie et al.  introduce a hierarchical regression network that integrates a self-attention mechanism in the process of fovea localization  . The network predicts the fovea center via a three-stage localization architecture that progressively crops features from coarse to fine. In addition to regression, deep learning-based methods also leverage the image segmentation paradigm. Tan et al.  design a single 7-layer convolutional network to point-wise predict the foveal region from input image patches. Sedai et al.  propose a two-stage image segmentation framework to segment the foveal region progressively. However, standard CNN-based architectures are limited by their fixed-size convolutional kernels, thereby failing to incorporate long-range features adequately. Consequently, these CNN-based architectures may fail under atypical light conditions and non-standard fovea positions, or in the absence of OD and vessel information due to lesions. To address the constraint of limited receptive field, our prior work proposes a two-branch segmentation architecture (Bilateral-ViT ) to model long-range connections. This architecture utilizes a multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanism of transformer networks    in a novel way. In Bilateral-ViT, the main branch consisted of 12 consecutive MHSA layers constituting global retinal features, while an auxiliary vessel branch extracted multi-scale spatial information from vessel segmentation. The decoder simultaneously fused multi-cue features from fundus and vessels using multi-scale convolutions. While achieving state-of-the-art results on two publicly available datasets, Messidor  and PALM , Bilateral-ViT suffers from lacking global multi-cue fusion and high computational costs. To overcome these limitations, we develop a new architecture called DualStreamFoveaNet (DSFN) incorporating a dual-stream encoder capable of globally fusing multi-cue features. Additionally, we introduce adaptively learnable tokens to effectively reduce computation demands.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: has demonstrated superiority over traditional image processing and morphological techniques in many fields of medical image analysis, such as classification, segmentation and object localization  [ref]33   [ref]36.
