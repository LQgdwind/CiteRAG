      "content": "Paper Title: Efficient Attention Network: Accelerate Attention by Searching Where to Plug\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecently, many plug-and-play and straightforward self-attention modules that utilize the interior information of a network to enhance instance specificity 1 are proposed to boost the generalization of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)  [ref]31 [ref]18   . The self-attention module is usually plugged into every block of a residual network (ResNet) \n (see Fig. 2 (a) for the structure of a ResNet and Fig. 2 (b) for a network with attention modules). In general, the implementation of the attention module can be divided into three steps : (1) Extraction: the plug-in module extracts internal features of a network by computing their statistics, like mean, variance, or higher-order moments  ; (2) Processing: the module leverages the extracted features to adaptively generate a mask that measures the importance of the feature maps via a fully connected layer , convolution layer [ref]31, or feature-wise linear transformation 1 [ref]18 etc.; (3) Recalibration: the mask is used to calibrate the feature maps of the network by element-wise multiplication or addition  . The operations and trainable modules in the implementation of self-attention inevitably require extra computational cost and parameters, resulting in slow inference and cumbersome network . This limits self-attention usage on applications that need a real-time response or small memory consumption, such as robotics, self-driving car, and mobile device. Previous works mainly focus on improving the capacity of self-attention module [ref]31  or reducing the parameters 1 [ref]18 . However, these methods do not balance the inference time and parameters//performance. For example, Huang et al.  propose sharing mechanism to share an attention module with the same set of parameters to different blocks in the same stages as Fig. 2 (c). Though the shared module significantly reduces the trainable parameters, the computational cost remains the same. Besides, the lightweight attention design, such as feature-wise linear transformation used in SGE [ref]18, reduces the parameters of individual modules and achieves good performance, but it still increases inference time as in Fig. 1. Naturally, a question would be asked: Can we modify the existing self-attention networks such that the modified networks can (1) achieve faster inference speed, (2) contain fewer parameters, and (3) still maintain comparable accuracy at the same time? The major obstacle of accelerating the attention network is the connections between modules and the network. The previous implementation of attention modules follows conventional practice where the attention modules are individually plugged into every block throughout a CNN shown in Fig. 2 (b)  [ref]31 [ref]18  , and hence the computational cost increases with the growing number of blocks. However, how many modules should be used and where to plug the module are rarely discussed. To improve the efficiency of the attention modules in CNNs, in this paper, a simple idea is proposed to reduce the number of interactions between blocks and attention modules instead of plugging the attention modules into each block. Meanwhile, to reduce the parameter cost, we adopt the sharing mechanism , and achieve the outcome in Fig. 2 (d). Comparing to Fig. 2 (b) and (c), our advantages are two-folded, ① smaller parameter increment ② less computational cost increment because of fewer connections between backbone and attention module. However, to achieve satisfactory performance, the dense connections  and the adequate number of trainable parameters 8 in networks are two critical factors in general. Thus, to balance efficiency and satisfactory performance, we propose a novel reinforcement-learning-based method to search for the optimal connection scheme. Compared with the popular architecture search methods 9 4 , our proposed method can better achieve all the goals where we can obtain attention network with sparse connections between the backbone and modules while (1) accelerating inference (2) reducing extra parameter increment and (3) maintaining accuracy. Our method is called Efficient Attention Network (EAN), which shares the attention module within the backbone and searches where to connect the shared attention module. Our Contribution. 1. We propose an effective connection searching method to improve the efficiency of the various attention network while maintaining the original accuracy, reducing the extra parameters increment, and accelerating the inference. 2. Our results show that disconnecting some modules from the backbone can be harmless or even improve the model performance. Such empirical finding differs from the intuition behind the conventional approach which applies attention modules to each block. 3. Through our empirical experiments, we illustrate that the attention network searched by our method has the capacity of transferring to other tasks and capturing the informative features, which means our EAN networks have potential to apply to wide fields.\n\nReference markers found: [31]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]31: self-attention modules that utilize the interior information of a network to enhance instance specificity 1 are proposed to boost the generalization of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)  [ref]31 [ref]18   .
