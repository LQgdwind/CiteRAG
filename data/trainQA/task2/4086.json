      "content": "Paper Title: PrivHAR: Recognizing Human Actions From Privacy-preserving Lens\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHuman action recognition is a challenging task [ref]35 and has many applications, such as video surveillance, human-computer interfaces, virtual reality, video games, and sports action analysis. Therefore, developing privacy-preserving approaches for HAR is even more challenging and has not been widely explored. Human Action Recognition (HAR).\nNowadays, there are multiple approaches in the computer vision literature for addressing the HAR problem. Some prior work relies on 2D CNNs to conduct video recognition  [ref]22  [ref]9. A major drawback of 2D CNN approaches is not properly modeling the temporal dynamics. On the other hand, 3D CNN-based approaches use spatial and temporal convolutions over the 3D space to infer complicated spatio-temporal relationships. For instance, C3D  is a 3D CNN based on the VGG model that learns spatio-temporal features from a frame sequence. However, 3D CNNs are typically computationally heavy, making the deployment difficult. Therefore, many efforts on HAR focus on proposing new efficient architectures; for example, by decomposing 3D filters into separate 2D spatial and 1D temporal filters   or extending efficient 2D architectures to 3D counterparts. Moreover, RubiksNet  is a hardware-efficient architecture for HAR based on a shift layer that learns to perform shift operations jointly in spatial and temporal context. We build our proposed PrivHAR using both C3D and RubiksNet. Privacy protection in Computer Vision. Currently, few works address the privacy-preserving HAR problem. We divide prior work into software-level and hardware-level protection, where we consider the latter more robust to attacks. Software-level Privacy-preserving HAR. Most prior privacy-preserving works apply different computer vision algorithms to the video data after their acquisition. The literature has relied on domain knowledge and hand-crafted approaches, such as pixelation, blurring, and face/object replacement, to protect sensitive information   . These methods can be useful in settings when we know in advance what to protect in the scene. More recent works propose a more general approach that learns privacy-preserving encodings through adversarial training   . These methods learn to degrade or inhibit privacy attributes while maintaining important features to perform inference tasks and provide more robust videos to adversarial attacks.\nRen et al.  use adversarial training to learn a video anonymizer and remove facial features for activity detection. Similarly, Wu et al.  7 proposed an adversarial framework that learns a degradation transform for the video inputs using a 2D convolution layer. These works optimize the trade-off between action recognition performance and the associated privacy budget on the degraded video. Although these software-level approaches preserve privacy, the acquired images are not protected. Hardware-level Privacy-preserving HAR. These approaches rely on the camera hardware to add an extra layer of security by removing sensitive data during the imaging sensing. Prior hardware-level privacy-preserving approaches use low-resolution cameras to anonymize videos, i.e., the videos are intentionally captured to be in special low-quality conditions that only allow for the recognition of some events or activities while avoiding the unwanted leak of the identity information for the human subjects in the video  . In  , two optical designs were proposed that filter or block sensitive information directly from the incident light-field before sensor measurements acquisition, enabling k-anonymity and privacy protection by using a camera with defocusing lens. In particular, they show how to select a defocus blur that provides a certain level of privacy over a working region within the sensor size limits; however, only using optical defocus for privacy may be susceptible to reverse engineering. In addition, the authors did not test their method on the action recognition task. More recently, 5 proposed a coded aperture camera system to perform privacy-preserving HAR directly from encoded measurements without the need for image restoration. However, it was only tested for indoor settings in a small dataset.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: Human action recognition is a challenging task [ref]35 and has many applications, such as video surveillance, human-computer interfaces, virtual reality, video games, and sports action analysis.
