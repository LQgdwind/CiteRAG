      "content": "Paper Title: Evolution of Group-Theoretic Cryptology Attacks using Hyper-heuristics\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInformally, hyper-heuristics offer to take a number of existing computational search techniques, and combine them, to make a new heuristic.\nThis new heuristic is intended to have more of the strengths of each of the heuristics, and less of their weaknesses.\nThe motive of a hyper-heuristic is not to out-perform a state-of-the-art algorithm on a single instance of a problem.\nRather, the aim of hyper-heuristic approaches is to perform well across a range of problem instances.\nIn other words, hyper-heuristics attempt to offer robust performance across a set of problems rather than specialised performance on a narrow set of specific instances.\nThese problems could be problem instances from a given domain, such as the travelling salesman problem.\nOr the problem instances could be drawn from different problem domains, for example exam timetabling and vehicle routing. In this paper we are developing a hyper-heuristic framework to solve problem instances from a single domain: cryptology. We should also be careful about the distinction between optimisation and supervised machine learning.\nOptimisation typically has an objective function we wish to evaluate and a parameter value which is a global optimum.\nOften this is difficult to achieve, and also difficult to know when it has been achieved.\nIn contrast, with supervised machine learning, we typically have a set of example cases which we use to train a model.\nWe then have a second set of independent example cases which are used to determine if the model performs well in general on cases which were not included in the training phase.\nOptimisation has a single stage (optimising), while machine learning has two main stages (training and testing).\nNor do we have the issue of over-fitting in optimisation, but the issue of over-fitting may arise in machine learning.\nIn summary, in this paper we are using a machine learning approach (hyper-heuristics), with an independent training and test set, to build a heuristic which we used for optimisation, the objective function being to minimise the length. Hyper-heuristics can be viewed in the context of heuristics and metaheuristics. These three terms are often confused. Let us begin by looking first at heuristics, metaheuristics, and finally hyper-heuristics. A heuristic is domain-specific algorithm (often called a rule of thumb) which does not solve a problem to optimality\n(as such problems are often NP-hard or NP-complete), but rather offers to deliver suboptimal solutions in feasible time.\nThat is, a heuristic is a strategy that aims to deliver an approximation to a solution to a given problem in a fast,\nrather than an overly elaborate, way.\nAn example of a heuristic is the Lin-Kernighan algorithm which is applied to the Traveling Salesman Problems (TSP).\nIt does not make sense to apply the Lin-Kernighan algorithm to the knapsack problem, as it is specific to TSP problems.\nThe Lin-Kernighan algorithm could be applied to other graph-based problems with a representation similar to the TSP, but the algorithm may not perform well as this is not what it was intended for. A metaheuristic is a general search-based algorithm which can be applied to spaces consisting of bit strings or permutations, for example, depending on the representation of the problem instances. An example of a metaheuristic is a genetic algorithm which searches the space of bit strings of a given length. Hyper-heuristics are different again. Typically a hyper-heuristic uses a metaheuristic to search the space of problem specific heuristics.\nThat is, a hyper-heuristic is a “search methodolog[y] for choosing or generating (combining, adapting) heuristics […], in order to solve a range of optimisation problems” [8, p. 2].\nFor example, see .\nHyper-heuristics have successfully been applied to a number of different problem domains. As combinatorial optimisation problems are a subset of all NP hard problems,\nit is not surprising that hyper-heuristics have been a popular approach.\nApplications include\nexam timetabling \nbin packing\n8\nand employee rostering\n.\nThere have also been a number of well-referenced survey articles, including\n7  . Hyper-heuristics typically do not generate complete algorithms;\nrather a component of an algorithm is targeted to be automatically designed\nby a generate and test approach. Hyper-heuristics have been used, for example, to generate\ncomponents of evolutionary algorithms such as\ngenetic algorithms and evolutionary programming\n(e.g.,\ncrossover operators [ref]21, mutation operators [ref]27) and form a large part of the literature in the automated design of algorithms . In the context of this paper, we are using hyper-heuristics in the following manner.\nWe will take seven low-level heuristics, which are chained together randomly to effectively create new heuristics.\nThese new chains of heuristics are then inserted into a standard EA (depicted in the work of ) which is used to tackle the problem. This work begins in the next section.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: and test approach. Hyper-heuristics have been used, for example, to generate\ncomponents of evolutionary algorithms such as\ngenetic algorithms and evolutionary programming\n(e.g.,\ncrossover operators [ref]21, mutation operators [ref]27) and form a large part of the literature in the automated design of algorithms .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
