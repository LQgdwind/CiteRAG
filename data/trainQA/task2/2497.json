      "content": "Paper Title: BundleTrack: 6D Pose Tracking for Novel Objects without Instance or Category-Level 3D Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTable I and Fig. 3 present the quantitative and qualitative results of state-of-art methods on the NOCS dataset respectively. The comparison points include learning-based methods relying on a category-level prior, such as NOCS [ref]13, KeypointNet , and 6-PACK with or without temporal prediction [ref]17. These methods are offline trained on both real and synthetic training sets, which are rendered with 3D object models extracted from the same categories of ShapeNetCore .\nIn contrast, ICP , MaskFusion , TEASER++* [ref]64 and the proposed BundleTrack have no access to any training data based on 3D models. The evaluation protocol is the same as in prior work [ref]17. A perturbed ground-truth object pose is used for initialization. The perturbation adds a uniformly sampled random translation within a 4cm range to evaluate robustness against a noisy initial pose [ref]17. No re-initialization is allowed during tracking. To evaluate robustness against missing frames, the same uniformly sampled 450 frames out of 3200 in the testing videos are dropped [ref]17. Four metrics are adopted: 1) 5°5cm: percentage of estimates with orientation error < 5°and translation error < 5cm - the higher the better; 2) IoU25 (Intersection over Union): percentage of cases where the overlapping prediction and ground-truth 3D bounding box volume is larger than 25% of their union - the higher the better; 3) Rerr: mean orientation error in degrees - the lower the better; and 4) Terr: mean translation error in centimeters - the lower the better. For Rerr and Terr, estimates with IoU≤\\leq25 are not counted when computing averages111https://github.com/j96w/6-PACK/blob/master/benchmark.py [ref]17. The results of comparison points other than MaskFusion and TEASER++* come from the literature [ref]17. The open-sourced code222https://github.com/martinruenz/maskfusion of MaskFusion is used for evaluation, where the global SLAM module is disabled to avoid inferring object poses from the camera’s estimated ego-motion. The dynamic object tracking module is kept to solely evaluate object pose tracking effectiveness. Its original segmentation module Mask-RCNN  is fine-tuned on the real training data provided in the NOCS dataset for better performance while the synthetic data rendered using category-level 3D models are not used, as this method is also agnostic to any 3D models . In addition to ICP reported in [ref]17, another state-of-art 3D registration approach [ref]64 is included for comparison and denoted as TEASER++*, which is robust to outlier correspondences and agnostic to 3D models. It takes as input the segmented point cloud and feature correspondences that are computed using the same modules proposed in BundleTrack.\nFor BundleTrack, an initial mask M0subscript𝑀0M_{0} is required as input to the framework and is provided via the aforementioned Mask-RCNN. During execution, BundleTrack does not require external mask input nor any form of re-initialization. As exhibited in Table I, BundleTrack significantly outperforms the comparison points under all metrics and over all object categories, despite not accessing instance or category-level 3D models.\n\nReference markers found: [13]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]13: quantitative and qualitative results of state-of-art methods on the NOCS dataset respectively. The comparison points include learning-based methods relying on a category-level prior, such as NOCS [ref]13, KeypointNet , and 6-PACK with or without temporal prediction [ref]17. These methods are offline trained on both real and synthetic training sets, which are rendered with 3D object models\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
