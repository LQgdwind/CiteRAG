      "content": "Paper Title: The Maude strategy language\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe strategy language has already been applied to several examples related to semantics of programming languages   , proof systems   , the ambient calculus 5, neural networks , membrane computing  , games [ref]52, a Sudoku solver , etc. In this section we show the features of the strategy language in action with examples from different fields: Two simple introductory examples in Section 4.1. They illustrate several aspects of the language including the matchrew combinator, strategy modules, recursive strategies, and parameterization. A strategy for the running example of Section 3, the 15-puzzle, that solves the game. This section shows how a rather complex algorithm can be implemented by a strategy in a modular way. The very useful mutually recursive strategies, conditional strategy definitions, and strategy arguments are exemplified here. Moreover, this covers games, one of the most relevant application areas for strategies. The RIP protocol in Section 4.3 demonstrates the application of strategies to specify and simulate realistic examples like a communication protocol, which can later be used for verification 6. In this example, we also care about the performance of the simulation and make use of the one combinator for that purpose. The controlled delivery of messages in this object-oriented model can also be translated to other specifications of this kind. Finally, the Knuth-Bendix is a paradigmatic example of the advocated separation of concerns between rules and strategies, because it specified several completion algorithm in separate strategy modules that operate on exactly the same deduction system. Moreover, it is a classical example in field of automated deduction, where strategies are also quite relevant.\n\nReference markers found: [52]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]52: language has already been applied to several examples related to semantics of programming languages   , proof systems   , the ambient calculus 5, neural networks , membrane computing  , games [ref]52, a Sudoku solver , etc. In this section we show the features of the strategy language in action with examples from different fields: Two simple introductory examples in Section 4.1.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
