      "content": "Paper Title: 1. Introduction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAdaptive mesh refinement and coarsening (AMR) using adaptive tree-based meshes is attracting growing interest in\nlarge-scale simulations of physical problems modelled with partial differential equations. Research\nover the past few years has demonstrated that tree-based AMR enables\nefficient data storage and mesh traversal, fast computation of mesh hierarchy\nand cell adjacency and extremely scalable partitioning and dynamic load\nbalancing. Although several cell topologies have been\nstudied [ref]1 , attention has centred around\nquadrilateral (2D) or hexahedral (3D) adaptive meshes endowed with standard\nisotropic 1:4 (2D) and 1:8 (3D) refinement rules. They form tree structures that\nare commonly known as quadtrees or forest-of-quadtrees or -octrees, when the former are patched\ntogether. There is ample literature concerning single-octree\nmeshes and extensions to\nforest-of-octrees  . State-of-the art in\nthese techniques is available at the open source parallel forest-of-octrees\nmeshing engine p4est . In the context of parallel adaptive  finite element (FE) solvers, forest-of-trees have been\nan essential component in many large-scale application\nproblems    .\nAs they provide multi-resolution by local mesh adaptation, they are convenient,\namong others, in the following three scenarios: (1) a priori mesh\nrefinement, when the  boundary value problem (BVP) exhibits local features that must be captured with\nhigh resolution, but are known in advance, see\ne.g.  ; (2) a posteriori mesh refinement,\ndriven by error estimators , for solutions of BVPs\nwhose local features are not known or spatially evolve over\ntime ; and (3) to control geometric approximation errors of\nstatic or moving boundaries and interfaces, in combination with unfitted FE\nmethods . In spite of their scalable multi-resolution capability, practical integration\nof forest-of-trees in large-scale FE codes is hindered by the fact that,\nin general, they are non-conforming meshes. In particular, they contain the\nwidely known hanging vertices, edges, and faces, occurring at the interface of\nneighbouring cells with different refinement levels. Mesh non-conformity\nincreases implementation complexity of FE methods, especially, when they\nare conforming. In this case, degrees of freedom lying on hanging VEFs\ncannot have an arbitrary value, they must be constrained to guarantee trace\ncontinuity across cell interfaces. Set up (during FE space construction)\nand application (during FE assembly) of hanging DOF constraints have\nbeen thoroughly studied  . Several large-scale\nFE software packages also provide state-of-the-art treatment of hanging\nDOFs  . They accommodate to\nstandard practice of constraining the processor-local portion of the mesh to\nthe cells the processor owns and a single layer of adjacent off-processor\ncells, the so-called ghost cells; it is well-established that hanging DOF\nconstraints do not expand beyond a single layer of ghost cells, see\ne.g.  for comprehensive and rigorous demonstration. While research is mature on generic parallel tree-based adaptive FE\nmethods, enabling applications in arbitrarily complex geometries has been\nvastly overlooked. Usage of body-fitted meshes (i.e. those whose faces\nconform to the domain boundary) is not a choice in large-scale parallel\ncomputations, due to the bottleneck in generating and partitioning large\nunstructured meshes. On the other hand, unfitted (also known as embedded or\nimmersed) FE methods blend exceptionally well with adaptive tree-based\nmeshes. However, to the authors’ best knowledge, this line of research has been\nbarely explored. The main advantage of unfitted methods is that, instead of\nrequiring body-fitted meshes, they embed the domain of interest in a\ngeometrically simple background grid (usually a uniform or an adaptive\nCartesian grid), which can be generated much more efficiently. Unfortunately,\nunfitted FE methods also suffer from well-known drawbacks, above all, the\nso-called small cut cell problem. The intersection of a background cell\nwith the physical domain can be arbitrarily small, with unbounded aspect\nratios. This leads to severely ill-conditioned systems of algebraic linear\nequations, if no specific strategy alleviates this issue . Many different unfitted methodologies have emerged that cope with the small cut\ncell problem (see, e.g., the cutFEM method , the Finite\nCell Method [ref]17, the AgFEM method , and some\nvariants of the XFEM method ). They have also been\nuseful for many multi-phase and multi-physics applications with moving interfaces\n(e.g. fracture mechanics 0, fluid–structure\ninteraction 1, free surface flows 2), in\napplications with varying domain topologies (e.g. shape or topology\noptimization 3, or in applications where the geometry is not\ndescribed by CAD data (e.g. medical simulations based on CT-scan\nimages 4). However, fewer works have addressed scalable parallel\nunfitted methods, which are essential for realistic large-scale applications.\nNotable exceptions are the works in 5 6, that\ndesign tailored preconditioners for unfitted methods.\nRecent parallelization strategies 7 have\ntaken a different path, by considering enhanced FE formulations that lead\nto well-conditioned system matrices, regardless of cut location. As a result,\nthey are amenable to resolution with state-of-the-art large-scale iterative\nlinear solvers such as  algebraic multigrid (AMG), for which there are\nhighly-scalable parallel implementations in renowned scientific computing\npackages such as PETSc 8. This approach yields superior\nscalability, e.g. in 7, a distributed-memory implementation of\nthe aggregated  finite element method (FEM), referred to as AgFEM, scales up to 16K cores and\nup to nearly 300M DOFs, on the Poisson equation in complex 3D domains,\ndiscretised with uniform meshes. This paper aims to fill the gap between parallel adaptive tree-based meshing and\nrobust and scalable unfitted FE techniques. We restrict the scope of our\nwork to AgFEM , although other enhanced unfitted\nformulations, such as the CutFEM method , could also be\nconsidered. AgFEM is based\non a discrete extension operator from well-posed to ill-posed DOFs.\nThe definition of this operator relies on aggregating cells on the boundary to remove\nbasis functions associated with badly cut cells and, thus, eliminate\nill-conditioning issues. The formulation enjoys good numerical properties, such\nas stability, condition number bounds, optimal convergence, and continuity with\nrespect to data; detailed mathematical analysis of the method is included\nin  for elliptic problems and in 9 for the\nStokes equation. Conversely, cell aggregation locally increases the\ncharacteristic size of the resulting aggregated mesh, which has an impact on the\nconstant (not order) in the convergence of the method, even though such constant\nhas experimentally been observed to be similar to the one of the non-aggregated\nFEM . In this work, we demonstrate that AgFEM is also\namenable to parallel tree-based meshes and optimal error-driven hℎh-adaptivity\nin practical large-scale FE applications. We refer to the resulting method\nas hℎh-AgFEM. Furthermore, since hℎh-AgFEM is capable of adding mesh\nresolution wherever it is needed, it is not hindered by the local accuracy issue\nmentioned above. The outline of this work is as follows. We detail first, in\nSection 2, a possible way to construct conforming AgFE spaces\non top of non-conforming (adaptive) meshes. The main challenge is to combine the\nlinear constraints arising from both hanging and problematic DOFs. We propose\na two-tier approach that generates first the hanging DOF constraints and then\nmodifies them with the AgFEM constraints. We show that this technique yields\nunified linear constraints that have no circular dependencies. Furthermore,\ndistributed-memory extension of the method can be implemented using common\nfunctionality of large-scale FE software packages. In our case, we have\nimplemented the method in the large-scale FE software package\nFEMPAR 0, which exploits the highly-scalable forest-of-tree\nmesh engine p4est. In the numerical tests of Section 3, we\nconsider the Poisson equation as model problem on several complex geometries and\nh​pℎ𝑝hp-FEM standard benchmarks. We demonstrate similar accuracy and optimal\nconvergence as with standard body-fitted hℎh-FEM and consistent robustness\nand scalability, using out-of-the-box AMG solvers from the PETSc\nproject. We draw the main conclusions of our work in\nSection 4. Finally, we supplement the paper contents\nwith an exhaustive step-by-step derivation of AgFE spaces, in\nAppendix A, and with the proof that AgFE spaces on\nnonconforming meshes retain the good numerical properties ensured on uniform\nmeshes, in Appendix B.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: storage and mesh traversal, fast computation of mesh hierarchy\nand cell adjacency and extremely scalable partitioning and dynamic load\nbalancing.
