      "content": "Paper Title: Nerfbusters: Removing Ghostly Artifacts from Casually Captured NeRFs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare the proposed dataset with popular NeRF datasets. We first normalize each scene’s camera poses (train and evaluation cameras combined) to the range [-1, 1]. We then find the nearest training image for each evaluation image. We compute the translation and rotation difference between the nearest neighbors (NN) and average over the number of evaluation poses. Tab. 3 shows that the proposed Nerfbusters dataset has a larger translation and rotation difference between training and evaluation frames than existing popular NeRF datasets. Tab. 3 compares translation and rotation differences between training and evaluation images. Although this is a useful approximation of the “difficulty” of the datasets, it does not encompass variations in the camera intrinsics, e.g. we can obtain a similar effect as a translation by changing the focal length. In practice though, a common assumption is that the same camera intrinsics are used for training and test renderings. This assumption does not hold for the Phototourism  dataset, where the camera intrinsics vary for each training frame. Therefore, Tab. 3 is a crude approximation of difficulty for this dataset. Figs. 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 show top-down views of training and evaluation views for each scene in the Synthetic [ref]20, LLFF [ref]19, MipNeRF-360 [ref]2, Phototourism , and our Nerfbusters dataset. Most of the datasets use every 8th frame for evaluation, resulting in training and evaluation views being very close. The train and test frames are further apart in the Nerfbusters dataset, faithfully representing some of the real-world challenges that users of NeRF experience when rendering fly-throughs of their captured scenes.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: frame.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
