      "content": "Paper Title: Collective eXplainable AI: Explaining Cooperative Strategies and Agent Contribution in Multiagent Reinforcement Learning with Shapley Values\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA straightforward application of Shapley values to endow an AI model with a notion of explainability consists of considering the features of a model as participants of a cooperative game, and the final prediction as the shared payout  . Computing the Shapley value of each feature provides us with its weight in the final decision. In this setup, our aim is to explain a deep multi-agent RL model using Shapley values to determine the contribution of each agent to the group’s global reward. The participants of the cooperative game will be agents, and the shared payout the global reward obtained by the agents at the end of an episode. By using the sampling described in Section IV to estimate the Shapley value for each agent, it can be expected that each agent would obtain a Shapley value proportional to its contribution to the collaborative task. It would then be possible to answer the research questions defined in Section I (RQ1, RQ2, RQ3). Experiments were conducted §§§The repository linking to our experiments can be found here: https://github.com/Fabien-Couthouis/XAI-in-RL using two multi-agent RL environments and three different RL algorithms: Multiagent Particle (Predator Prey scenario) 5: A light environment with continuous observations and a discrete action space.\nPredator-Prey scenario was evaluated with three predators and a single prey. In this scenario, the prey is faster and aims to avoid being caught by predators.\nThe prey is positively rewarded when escaping predators, and negatively rewarded when caught, and vice versa for predators. Both types of agents are rewarded negatively when trying to overpass the screen boundaries or hitting an obstacle. As it was done by the authors of Multiagent Particle 5, the prey was trained using the DDPG [ref]42 algorithm §§§DDPG implementation from repository https://github.com/openai/maddpg/ whereas predators were trained using MADDPG 5§§§MADDPG implementation: https://github.com/openai/maddpg/. For this scenario, 5 different models with the same hyperparameters were trained in order to obtain meaningful values despite the stochastic nature of MADDPG, as suggested in  and detailed in the Appendix. Sequential Social Dilemmas (Harvest scenario) 6: Another light environment with continuous observations and discrete actions that proposes scenarios emphasizing social interactions and cooperation between agents. In the Harvest scenario, agents must cooperate to harvest the maximum number of apples, while being careful to not “kill” apple trees by collecting all apples they contain, as this would prevent this tree from spawning apples further. As it was done by the authors of Sequential Social Dilemmas open source implementation of the environment , all agents were trained using the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) §§§A3C implementation: https://github.com/ray-project/ray/tree/master/rllib algorithm. The best reported hyperparameters and training protocol showcased in   were used. Two experiments were conducted on the Predators-Prey scenario: 1) Using default settings provided by the authors of the environment 5 (to verify RQ1, RQ2 and RQ3), and 2) with different speeds for each predator (to further confirm RQ1 and RQ2). Speeds used on each experiment are presented in Table I.\nFor Harvest, three experiments were also conducted: first, the Shapley values of a simple model trained with 6 agents using the default settings suggested by   were computed to further investigate RQ1 and, especially, determine the minimal number of agents required for this task. Then, Shapley values were recomputed using the same model but modified according to information extracted from the Shapley analysis obtained during the first experiment, in order to confirm the validity of such information.\nIn addition, social outcome metrics from 9 are reported to have a more fine-grained view of the payout notion (instead of merely a global reward).\nThe following metrics were implemented: Efficiency (Eq. 5): Measures the total sum of all rewards obtained by all agents. Equality (Eq. 6): Measures the statistical dispersion intended to represent inequality (Gini coefficient ). Sustainability (Eq. 7): Defined as the average time ts∈tsubscript𝑡𝑠𝑡t_{s}\\in t at which rewards are collected. Considering N𝑁N independent agents, let {rti|t=1,…,T}conditional-setsuperscriptsubscript𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑡1…𝑇\\{r_{t}^{i}|t=1,...,T\\} be the sequence of rewards obtained by\nthe i-th agent over an episode of duration T𝑇T timesteps. Its return is given by Ri=∑t=1Trtisuperscript𝑅𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑡1𝑇subscriptsuperscript𝑟𝑖𝑡R^{i}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T}r^{i}_{t}.\nThus, the equations describing the social metrics are as follows: Finally, additional experiments were executed on different Harvest checkpoints to explore how agents cooperate. Each experiment will be detailed in the subsections below.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: of agents are rewarded negatively when trying to overpass the screen boundaries or hitting an obstacle.
