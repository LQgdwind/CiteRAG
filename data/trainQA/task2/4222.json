Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON.

      "content": "Paper Title: YOLOSA: Object detection based on 2D local feature superimposed self-attention\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo resolve the conflict between classification and regression tasks, the decoupled head[ref]7 method is widely used in one-stage object detection9     [ref]6  5  [ref]7 8 3   and two-stage object detection1  0  2  8. YOLOX[ref]7 took the lead in applying the decoupled head[ref]7 method to YOLO series9     [ref]6  5  [ref]7 models and obtained SOTA performance. However, when we applied the decoupled head method to the YOLOv5[ref]6 model, the number of model calculation and the number of model parameters are considerably increased. This method has a noteworthy impact on the inference speed of our model. Accordingly, we made some improvements to the original method to reduce the amount of calculation in the model and improve the inference speed (Fig. 6). YOLOX[ref]7 passed the output of the FPN7 + PAN0 structure through a 1×1111\\times 1 convolution with 256 channels. Our method passes all outputs through a 1×1111\\times 1 convolution in which the number of channels is halved and one 3×3333\\times 3 convolution was removed. As presented in Table  2, our method achieves a slightly lower AP than decoupled head of YOLOX[ref]7, but the number of calculations and parameters of the model are considerably reduced, which speeds up the inference speed of the model substantially.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: To resolve the conflict between classification and regression tasks, the decoupled head[ref]7 method is widely used in one-stage object detection9     [ref]6  5  [ref]7 8 3   and two-stage object detection1  0  2  8.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
