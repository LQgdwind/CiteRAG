      "content": "Paper Title: Ensemble and Auxiliary Tasks for Data-Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe Rainbow agent  extends the DQN by introducing various advances in reinforcement learning. It uses Double-DQN  to minimize the overestimation error. Instead of sampling uniformly from the replay buffer 𝔻𝔻{\\mathbb{D}}, it assigns priority to each instance based on the temporal difference (TD) error . Its architecture decomposes advantage function from value function Q​(s,a)=V​(s)+A​(s,a)𝑄𝑠𝑎𝑉𝑠𝐴𝑠𝑎Q(s,a)=V(s)+A(s,a) and learn them in an end-to-end manner . Moreover, categorical value distribution is learned in place of the expected state-action value function [ref]3.\nThus, the loss function is given as follows.\nWe denote the scalar-valued Q-function corresponding to the the distributional Q-function as Q^^𝑄\\hat{Q} for simplicity. where ΦQ​(s′,a^′;θ′)subscriptΦ𝑄superscript𝑠′superscript^𝑎′superscript𝜃′\\Phi_{Q(s^{\\prime},\\hat{a}^{\\prime};\\theta^{\\prime})} denotes a distributional projection [ref]3 based on categorical atom probabilities given by Q​(s′,a^′;θ′)𝑄superscript𝑠′superscript^𝑎′superscript𝜃′Q(s^{\\prime},\\hat{a}^{\\prime};\\theta^{\\prime}) for support 𝒮𝒮{\\mathcal{S}}. Q𝑄Q returns a column vector Softmax output with |𝒮|𝒮|{\\mathcal{S}}| rows instead of a scalar value and 𝒮𝒮{\\mathcal{S}} is a column vector support of the categorical distribution. The scalar-valued Q function is computed by Q^​(s,a)=𝒮T​Q​(s,a)^𝑄𝑠𝑎superscript𝒮𝑇𝑄𝑠𝑎\\hat{Q}(s,a)={\\mathcal{S}}^{T}Q(s,a). We refer the reader to the original paper [ref]3 for a detailed explanation. Multi-step returns is also employed to achieve faster convergence . To aid exploration, NoisyNets [ref]6 is utilized; it works by perturbing the parameter space of the Q-function by injecting learnable Gaussian noise. Recently, [ref]9 proposes a set of hyperparameters for Rainbow that works well on ATARI games under 100K interactions .\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: Q​(s,a)=V​(s)+A​(s,a)𝑄𝑠𝑎𝑉𝑠𝐴𝑠𝑎Q(s,a)=V(s)+A(s,a) and learn them in an end-to-end manner . Moreover, categorical value distribution is learned in place of the expected state-action value function [ref]3.\nThus, the loss function is given as follows.\nWe denote the scalar-valued Q-function corresponding to the the distributional Q-function as Q^^𝑄\\hat{Q} for simplicity. where\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
