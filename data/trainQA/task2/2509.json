      "content": "Paper Title: MOHAQ: Multi-Objective Hardware-Aware Quantization of Recurrent Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe compression of neural network models has been treated as an optimization problem to select the degree of compression for each layer/channel. In many cases, feedback from a hardware platform or hardware model is used during the optimization (hardware-aware compression). We have summarized the work done on the optimization of NN models for compression in Table II.\nThe choice of constraints and objectives have varied among different papers. Energy-aware pruning [ref]5 is a pruning method that minimizes energy consumption on a given platform. The platform model was used to guide the pruning process by informing it which layer when pruned, would lead to more energy saving. The pruning process stops when a predefined accuracy constraint has been hit.\nNetadapt  eliminated the need for platform models by using direct empirical measurements. Nevertheless, pruning in Netadapt is constrained by a resource budget such as latency, memory size, and energy consumption. In both methods, pruning starts from pre-trained models, and fine-tuning is applied to retain accuracy. Similarly, an energy-constrained compression method  used pruning guided by energy constraints. Energy results are predicted from a mathematical model for a TPU-like systolic array structure architecture. However, this compression method trains the model from the beginning.\nOn the other hand, DeepIOT  obtains the memory size information from the target platform to compute the required compression ratio as a constraint.\nIn another work, optimization variables are selected based on time constraints [ref]36, where roof-line models are used for calculating\nthe maximum achievable performance for different pruning configurations. HAQ (Hardware-aware Quantization) used reinforcement learning to select bit-width for weights and activations to quantize a model during training while considering hardware constraints .\nLAPQ [ref]6 and ZeroQ  applied optimization algorithms on quantized NN models but without any hardware model guidance. Loss Aware Post-training quantization (LAPQ) is a layer-wise iterative optimization algorithm to calculate the optimum quantization step for clipping [ref]6. The authors proved that there is a relation between the quantization step and the cross-entropy loss.\nSmall changes in the quantization step have a drastic effect on the accuracy. LAPQ managed to quantize ImageNet models to 4-bit with a slight decrease in accuracy level.\nIn the Zero-shot Quantization (ZeroQ), Nagel et al. proposed a data-free quantization method . Their approach uses multi-objective optimization to select the precision of different layers in the model. The two objectives are the memory size and the total quantization sensitivity, where they define an equation to measure the sensitivity of each layer for different precisions. The authors assumed that the sensitivity for each layer to a specific precision is independent of other layers’ precisions. This assumption simplifies the computation of the overall sensitivity for different quantization configurations in the search space, None of the discussed work has applied hardware-aware multi-objective optimization to the problem of NN compression. In this work, we use quantization as a compression method and target hardware models to guide the compression. We allow both the model error/accuracy and hardware efficiency metrics (speedup and energy consumption) to be objectives. We use the hardware on-chip memory size as a constraint to avoid high-cost off-chip communication.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: We have summarized the work done on the optimization of NN models for compression in Table II.\nThe choice of constraints and objectives have varied among different papers.
