      "content": "Paper Title: ParGeo: A Library for Parallel Computational Geometry\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nComputational geometry algorithms have important applications in various domains, including computer graphics, robotics, computer vision, and geographic information systems¬† .\nIt is important to provide users with libraries of efficient computational geometry algorithms that they can easily use in their own higher-level applications.\nFurthermore, due to the growing sizes of data sets that need to be processed today, and the ubiquity of parallel (multicore) machines, it is beneficial to use parallel algorithms to speed up computations.\nIn this paper, we present the ParGeo library for parallel computational geometry,\nwhich includes a rich set of parallel algorithms for geometric problems and data structures,\nincluding kùëòkd-trees, kùëòk-nearest neighbor search, range search,\nwell-separated pair decomposition, Euclidean minimum spanning tree,\nspatial sorting, and geometric clustering.\nParGeo also contains a collection of geometric graph generators, including\nkùëòk-nearest neighbor graphs and various spatial networks.\nAlgorithms from ParGeo can either run sequentially, or\nrun using parallel schedulers such as OpenMP, Cilk, or ParlayLib. While there exist numerous libraries for computational geometry,\nmost of them are not designed for parallel processing.\nFor example, Libigl¬† is a library that specializes in\nthe construction of discrete differential geometry\noperators and finite-element matrices.\nHowever, only some aspects of Libigl take advantage of\nparallelism.\nIn comparison, the algorithms and implementations of ParGeo\nare designed for parallelism, and target a different set of problems.\nCGAL (Computational Geometry Algorithms Library)¬†\nis a well-known library of computational geometry algorithms\nthat includes a wide range of algorithms, but most implementations are not parallel.\nBatista¬†et al.¬† targeted a few important\nalgorithms, including spatial sorting, box intersection, and\nDelaunay triangulation for\nshared-memory parallel processing, with code in CGAL.\nIn comparison, ParGeo targets similar classes of problems as CGAL,\nbut all of our implementations are highly parallel.\nPMP¬†, Cinolib¬†, and Tetwild¬†\nare libraries for\npolygonal and polyhedron meshes, tackling different problems from ParGeo.\nMatGeom¬† is a library for sequential geometric computing\nwith MATLAB.\nThe Problem Based Benchmark Suite¬†0 \nis a multicore benchmark suite that has some overlap in algorithms with ParGeo.\nLEDA¬† is a library of\ndata structures and algorithms for sequential combinatorial and geometric processing.\nArborX¬† is a parallel library for spatial search. In this paper, in addition to providing an overview of work on ParGeo,\nwe describe new parallel algorithms implemented in ParGeo for convex hull,\nsmallest enclosing ball, and batch-dynamic kùëòkd-tree that we developed.\nFor convex hull, we develop new parallel algorithms for both ‚Ñù2superscript‚Ñù2\\mathbb{R}^{2} and ‚Ñù3superscript‚Ñù3\\mathbb{R}^{3}, where\nour key algorithmic novelty is a\nreservation technique to enable parallel modifications to the hull.\nFor smallest enclosing ball,\nwe propose a new sampling-based algorithm based on Larsson¬†et al.‚Äôs¬†[ref]41 approach to quickly reduce the size of the data set. We also provide the first parallel implementation of the classic randomized incremental algorithm¬†7.\nFor kùëòkd-trees,\nwe develop the BDL-tree, a new parallel data structure that supports batch-dynamic operations (construction, insertions, and deletions) as well as exact kùëòk-NN queries.\nBDL-trees consist of a set of exponentially growing kùëòkd-trees and perform batched updates in parallel. To demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed algorithms and library,\nwe perform a comprehensive set of experiments on synthetic and\nreal-world geometric data sets, and compare the performance across our parallel implementations as well as optimized sequential baselines.\nOn 36 cores with two-way hyper-threading, our best convex\nhull implementations achieve up to 44.7x (42.8x on average) self-relative speedup and up to\n559x (325x on average) speedup against the best existing sequential implementation\nfor ‚Ñù2superscript‚Ñù2\\mathbb{R}^{2}, and up to 24.9x (11.81x on average) self-relative speedup and up to\n124x (61.4x on average) speedup against the best existing sequential implementation\nfor ‚Ñù3superscript‚Ñù3\\mathbb{R}^{3}.\nOur sampling-based smallest enclosing ball algorithm\nachieves up to 27.1x (20.08x on average) self-relative speedup and up to 178x (109x on average) speedup\nagainst the best existing sequential implementation for ‚Ñù2superscript‚Ñù2\\mathbb{R}^{2} and ‚Ñù3superscript‚Ñù3\\mathbb{R}^{3}.\nOur BDL-tree achieves self-relative speedup of up to 35.4√ó35.4\\times (30.0√ó30.0\\times on average) for construction, up to 35.0√ó35.0\\times (28.3√ó28.3\\times on average) for batch insertion, up to 33.1√ó33.1\\times (28.5√ó28.5\\times on average) for batch deletion, and up to 46.1√ó46.1\\times (40.0√ó40.0\\times on average) for full kùëòk-NN.\nFinally, across all implementations in ParGeo, we achieve self-relative parallel speedup of\n8.1‚Äì46.6x (on average 23.2x).\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: key algorithmic novelty is a\nreservation technique to enable parallel modifications to the hull.\nFor smallest enclosing ball,\nwe propose a new sampling-based algorithm based on Larsson¬†et al.‚Äôs¬†[ref]41 approach to quickly reduce the size of the data set.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
