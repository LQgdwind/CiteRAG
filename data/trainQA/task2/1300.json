      "content": "Paper Title: Quantum Fully Homomorphic Encryption by Integrating Pauli One-time Pad with Quaternions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme is an encryption scheme that allows any efficiently computable circuit to perform on plaintexts by a third party holding the corresponding ciphertexts only. As the quantum counterpart, quantum FHE (QFHE) allows a client to delegate quantum computation on encrypted plaintexts to a quantum server, in particular when the client outsources the computation to a quantum server and meanwhile hides the plaintext data from the server. There are two main differences between quantum FHE and classical FHE. First, in QFHE, the plaintexts are quantum states (or qubits), rather than classical bits. Second, in QFHE, the homomorphic operations are quantum gates, rather than arithmetic ones. Since it is possible to simulate arbitrary classical computation in the quantum setting, a QFHE scheme allows to perform any computation task running on a classical FHE, but not vice versa. From this point, QFHE is a more general framework. It has drawn a lot of attention in the last decade, e.g.,    [ref]4   .\n\nPrevious Works. In 2015, Broadbent and Jeffery  proposed a complete QHE scheme based on quantum Pauli one-time pad encryption. Specifically, They encrypted every single-qubit of a quantum state (plaintext) with a random Pauli gate (called Pauli one-time pad ), and then encrypted the two classical bits used to describe the Pauli pad with a classical FHE, and considered homomorphic evaluations of the universal gates {Clifford gates, TùëáT-gate} for quantum computation. They showed that the evaluation of a Clifford gate can be easily done by public operations on the quantum ciphertext and classical encrypted bits of the pad; the latter will make use of the homomorphic property of classical FHE. They also showed two different approaches to evaluating the non-Clifford gate TùëáT, at the cost of ciphertext size (or depth of decryption circuit) growing with the number of supported TùëáT-gate, yielding a QHE for circuits with a constant number of TùëáT-gates. Since then, how to efficiently evaluate the non-Clifford gate became a key issue. In 2016, Dulek, Schaffner and Speelman [ref]4 introduced some special quantum gadgets for achieving the evaluation of TùëáT-gate, where each gadget is not reusable and duplicable due to its quantum property. Their scheme requires the client to generate a number of quantum gadgets proportional to the number of the TùëáT-gates to be evaluated, allowing to privately and compactly outsource quantum computation at the cost of additional preparation of quantum evaluation key. In comparison with , the dependence on the number of non-Clifford gate is transformed from the ciphertext size (or depth of decryption circuit) to the quantum key. In 2018, Mahadev proposed the first QFHE scheme with a fully classical key generation process, which reduced the requirement for the quantum capability on the client, so that the client can be completely classical. This scheme used the Pauli one-time pad encryption, and made the evaluations of the universal gates {Clifford gates, Toffoli-gate}. To evaluate a Toffoli gate, Mahadev proposed a revolutionary technique called controlled-CNOT operation, which allows to implement a controlled-CNOT gate while keeping the control bit private. With a new approach to evaluating non-Clifford gates, the scheme of  satisfies the compactness requirement of fully homomorphic encryption, and meanwhile there is no longer an explicit bound on the number of supported non-Clifford gates. One particular requirement of Mahadev‚Äôs encrypted CNOT operation is that the control bit must be encrypted by an FHE scheme of exponential modulus and equipped with a trapdoor. Later in 2018, Brakerski  improved Mahadev‚Äôs work by proposing an alternative approach to realize the encrypted CNOT operation, where the underlying FHE was significantly simplified by reducing the exponential modulus to polynomial modulus, and where the requirement of a trapdoor was also removed. Due to the polynomial noise ratio of the underlying FHE, Brakerski‚Äôs QFHE scheme achieves a higher level of security, which matches the best-known security for classical FHE, up to polynomial factors. Also, Brakerski showed a close connection between the quantum homomorphic evaluation and the circuit privacy of classical FHE. As pointed out in , one of the most promising applications of QFHE in anticipation is private outsourcing of quantum computation. Improving the efficiency of evaluation is a fundamental question in the studies on homomorphic encryption. In this paper, we focus on improving the efficiency of evaluating quantum algorithms (circuits). Usually, quantum algorithms (gate-level circuits) are designed by using single-qubit gates and controlled gates (CNOT), such as the famous quantum Fourier transform (cf. Figure 1). When evaluating ‚Äú1-qubit+CNOT\"-style quantum algorithms with existing ‚ÄúClifford+non-Clifford‚Äù-style QHE schemes, e.g.,  [ref]4  , it is required to first decompose each evaluated 1-qubit gate into Clifford/non-Clifford gates, followed by evaluating them one by one (each evaluation requires to perform at least 1 quantum gate). Practically, in average cases, tens of thousands of Clifford/non-Clifford gates are required to approximate a 1-qubit gate within a few bits of precision . So, we consider that if it is possible to design a QFHE scheme that allows to more conveniently and efficiently evaluate 1-qubit gates and thus quantum algorithms, particularly measured in terms of the quantum cost. This inconvenience in evaluating 1-qubit gate is essentially derived from the small pad space of the encryption scheme. One idea for improvement is to enlarge the pad space from Pauli group to the group SU(2), relying on the notion of approximate computation. This notion, useful for classical FHE 0, has recently been used in the QFHE setting . We design a new QFHE scheme based on the above idea, where an important issue addressed is evaluating the CNOT gate in the much more complicated pad setting. Interestingly, our work also provides a tool that allows hiding the evaluated 1-qubit gate from the server. It may be useful for private circuit evaluation in the quantum setting 1 2 3.\n\nOur Contributions. We design a new QFHE scheme, which is based on a generalized one-time pad encryption method, called the quaternion one-time pad encryption. We call our quantum ciphertext the quaternion one-time pad encrypted state (QOTP-encrypted state), in contrast to the Pauli one-time pad encrypted state (Pauli-encrypted state) used in . Our scheme has several properties as follows: Efficiency. The cost of evaluating single-qubit is completely classical and not expensive compared to previous QFHE schemes. With previous ‚ÄúClifford+non-Clifford‚Äù QFHE schemes, evaluating a general 1-qubit gate within a specific precision œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon requires to evaluate a sequence of Clifford and non-Clifford gates of length O(log2‚Å°1œµsuperscript21italic-œµ\\log^{2}\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}) (by the optimal Solovay-Kitaev algorithm111The original Solovay-Kitaev algorithm can find a sequence of O(log3.97‚Å°(1/œµ))superscript3.971italic-œµ(\\log^{3.97}(1/\\epsilon)) quantum gates from a chosen finite set of generators of a density subset of S‚ÄãU‚Äã(2)ùëÜùëà2SU(2) to approximate any unitary S‚ÄãU‚Äã(2)ùëÜùëà2SU(2) in precision œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon. However, for the specific finite set {Clifford gate,T-gate}Clifford gateT-gate\\{\\textnormal{Clifford gate},\\textnormal{T-gate}\\}, there is a better version of the SK algorithm with approximation factor O(log2‚Å°(1/œµ))superscript21italic-œµ(\\log^{2}(1/\\epsilon)); see 4 for more details. ), which requires to perform at least O(log2‚Å°1œµsuperscript21italic-œµ\\log^{2}\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}) 1-qubit quantum gates; in comparison, using our scheme only requires to classically homomorphically compute a simple degree-2 polynomial function in O‚Äã(log‚Å°1œµ)ùëÇ1italic-œµO(\\log\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})-bit numbers, cf. (2.2). Practically, in the average case, a sequence of Clifford+T gates of length 25575 is required to approximate a general element of SU(2) within 0.0443 trace distance ; in contrast, 141414-bit gate key can represent any element of SU(2) within 1212.51superscript212.5\\frac{1}{2^{12.5}} L2superscriptùêø2L^{2}-distance, cf. Lemma 5.3, which guarantees the trace distance no more than 125=0.03151superscript250.0315\\frac{1}{2^{5}}=0.0315, cf. (2.1). Privacy. Our scheme achieves the private 1-qubit gate evaluation. In our scheme, the server only needs to know the encryption of the 1-qubit gate to be evaluated. In contrast, previous schemes require each evaluated gate to be applied in an explicit way. Conversion. Our scheme is able to switch back and forth with previous QFHE schemes that are based on Pauli one-time pad encryption. We show that it is possible to transform a QOTP-encrypted state into its Pauli-encrypted form (cf. Proposition 4.3), and a Pauli-encrypted state is in natural QOTP-encrypted form (cf. Lemma 5.1). Roughly speaking, the overhead of transforming a QOTP-encrypted state to its Pauli-encrypted form in precision œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon is only a fraction O(1log‚Å°1œµ11italic-œµ\\frac{1}{\\log\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}}) of that of evaluating a general 1-bit gate in the same precision œµitalic-œµ\\epsilon using the previous QFHE scheme of , cf. ‚ÄòEfficiency Comparison‚Äô in Section 5. In comparison with the previous ‚ÄúClifford+non-Clifford‚Äù-style QFHE schemes, our scheme is less costly in evaluating 1-qubit gates, but more costly in evaluating CNOT gates. For evaluating quantum circuits consisting of pùëùp percentage CNOT gates and (1‚àíp)1ùëù(1-p) percentage 1-qubit gates within the precision negl‚Äã(Œª)neglùúÜ\\textnormal{negl}(\\lambda), the complexity advantage of our scheme over the previous ones is O((1‚àíp)‚ÄãŒª2p‚ÄãŒª)=O‚Äã(Œª)1ùëùsuperscriptùúÜ2ùëùùúÜùëÇùúÜ(\\frac{(1-p)\\lambda^{2}}{p\\lambda})=O(\\lambda), when constant pùëùp is away from both one and zero. Therefore, except for the extreme case where there are overwhelmingly many CNOTs and negligible 1-qubits gates, our scheme is polynomially better asymptotically, cf. Section 5. Moreover, by the conversion between our new QFHE scheme and previous ‚ÄúClifford +non-Clifford\" QHE schemes  [ref]4  , one can evaluate the quantum circuits in a hybrid way, which may be more efficient than using a single scheme: for parts of circuits mainly consisting of Clifford gates (or easily approximated by Clifford gates), they can be evaluated in the Pauli one-time pad setting; for parts containing single-qubit gates difficult to approximate, they can be evaluated in the QOTP setting. The second contribution of this work is a new technique called encrypted conditional rotation (encrypted-CROT), which allows the server to perform (up to a Pauli mask) any 1-qubit unitary operator whose parameters are given in encrypted form, cf. Theorem 3.5. This technique can bring the following benefits: It provides an approach to private 1-qubit gate evaluation for the QHE schemes based on the Pauli one-time pad. To be more explicit, this technique allows the server to perform any 1-qubit gate whose parameters are given in encrypted form, and the introduced Pauli mask can be merged with the encryption pad. It can be used in the QHE scheme of  towards constructing a ‚ÄúClifford +T‚Äù-style QFHE scheme, cf. Remark 3.3. It is providing a meaningful alternative to ‚ÄúClifford+Toffoli‚Äù-style QFHE of , because although any non-Clifford gate, together with Clifford group, is universal for quantum computation, the efficiency of approximating a particular quantum gate with different non-Clifford gates is different. In practice, the 1-qubit-level T-gate is a more popular choice than the 3-qubit-level Toffoli gate, as the representative element of non-Clifford gates 4 5 . It allows to transform a QOTP-encrypted state into its Pauli-encrypted form. To the best of our knowledge, this work enriches the family of QFHE schemes by providing the first one of not ‚ÄúClifford +non-Clifford‚Äù-style. Due to the absence of the Clifford gate decomposition, the scheme avoids some difficulties in its (practical) implementation, but possibly loses some potential advantages in error-correction or fault-tolerant. With the conversion between these QFHE schemes, it is possible to exploit their respective strengths, and provide diverse options for evaluating distinct quantum circuits. This work also provides a useful tool for private circuit evaluations in the quantum setting.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: allows to perform any computation task running on a classical FHE, but not vice versa.
