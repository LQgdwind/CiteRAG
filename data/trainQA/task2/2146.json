      "content": "Paper Title: To Beam Or Not To Beam: That is a Question of Cooperation for Language GANs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nBeyond Teacher Forcing\nTo mitigate the limitations inherent to Teacher Forcing, various alternatives have been proposed. In Scheduled Sampling, Bengio et al. [ref]2 proposed to condition the generation not only on the ground truth tokens, but also the generated ones. Given that only one reference is available, this introduces a new mismatch when computing the loss, this time between the generated tokens used to condition the model, and the target tokens. To take into account multiple possible references, using a sequence level metric is a potential alternative. In Mixer, Ranzato et al.  chose BLEU, the standard metric to evaluate Machine Translation. Since it is not differentiable, the task is framed in a Reinforcement Learning setup where the reward corresponds to the BLEU score given a sampled sequence of tokens. Paulus et al.  applied the same method to Summarization, using this time ROUGE. While the results improved in terms of ROUGE, the human evaluation found that the generated summaries were rated worse in term of fluency than the MLE baseline. The model learns to take advantage of metric biases, while being less correct according to human judgement. Language GANs\nIn theory, a perfect discriminator would be able to judge if an output corresponds to the data distribution or not. Discriminators could therefore be an interesting alternative reward compared to other metrics. In practice, we need to train the discriminator jointly with the generator, framing the task as a GAN. Language GANs are known to underperform MLE [ref]3, due to the unavoidable sparsity of a discriminator reward. A large body of works have proposed denser rewards: ranking or comparative discriminators   6, a sequential discriminator where the rewards are provided at each time step of the generation [ref]35 . More recently, Scialom et al.  proposed to stabilize the GAN training by lowering the Softmax temperature to explore more structured outputs, and closer to the generator distribution. In this work, our proposed framework allows to propagate the discriminator signal in a cooperative way, which can be seen as an alternative solution to the sparsity of the reward and the training stability. Knowledge Distillation\nSelfGAN has a connection with knowledge distillation , where a student is trained on outputs from the teacher. In particular, self distillation using only a generator has shown to improve generalisation on image GANs 5 by acting as label smoothing.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to propose the idea of augmenting the teacher by coupling a discriminator to a generator. Beyond GANs, SelfGAN could serve for other applications using distillation, e.g. in semi-supervised methods that use a teacher model to create synthetic labels for unlabeled examples  1. Monte Carlo Tree Search in NLG\nDespite important successes in games  , very few works have attempted to apply MCTS to NLG. Kumagai et al.  proposed to employ context-free grammar rules combined with a n-gram language model and explore the space of grammatically correct texts via a MCTS. In the context of commercial e-commerce agents, Mukherjee  proposed to optimise with a MCTS a scoring function designed to reward grammatical correctness.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Beyond Teacher Forcing\nTo mitigate the limitations inherent to Teacher Forcing, various alternatives have been proposed.
