      "content": "Paper Title: RepMLPNet: Hierarchical Vision MLP with Re-parameterized Locality\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe first instantiate a series of RepMLPNets with different architectural hyper-parameters, as shown in Table¬†1. We evaluate RepMLPNets on ImageNet¬†. All the RepMLPNets are trained with identical settings: a global batch size of 256 distributed on 8 GPUs, AdamW [ref]29 optimizer with initial learning rate of 0.002, weight decay of 0.1 and momentum of 0.9. We train for only 100 epochs in total with cosine learning rate annealing, including a 10-epoch warm-up at the beginning. We use label smoothing of 0.1, mixup  with Œ±=0.4ùõº0.4\\alpha=0.4, CutMix [ref]44 with Œ±=1.0ùõº1.0\\alpha=1.0, and RandAugment . As a series of strong baselines, we present ResNet-101¬†, ResNeXt-101¬† and RegNetX-6.4GF¬† trained with a strong scheme with RandAugment, mixup and label smoothing. We would like the comparison to be slightly biased towards the traditional CNNs, so we train them for 120 epochs. All the models are evaluated with single crop and the throughput (samples/second) is tested on 2080Ti GPU with a batch size of 128. The BN layers in CNNs are also fused for the fair comparison. It should be noted that most of the results reported by [ref]37    are produced with a long training schedule of 300 or 400 epochs, or an advanced distillation method (the DeiT-style training ). Therefore, except for the results cited from the corresponding papers, we train an MLP-Mixer and a ResMLP-S12 with simple training settings for a fair comparison (labeled as ‚Äúour impl‚Äù in Table¬†2). Specifically, the MLP-Mixer is trained with the settings identical to RepMLPNets; the ResMLP-S12 is trained with the official code and the same hyper-parameters as its reported 120-epoch result¬†[ref]37 except that we use a smaller batch size due to limited resources (but our reproduced accuracy is 2.7% higher than its reported result¬†[ref]37). Compared to the other CNNs and MLPs, we make the following observations. 1) With fair settings, RepMLPNet shows superiority over the other MLPs, e.g., RepMLPNet-T256 outperforms MLP-Mixer (our impl, 256√ó\\times256 inputs) by 0.5% in the accuracy while the FLOPs of the former is only 1/4 of the latter. 2) With simple training methods, ResMLP and MLP-Mixer significantly degrade, e.g., the accuracy of ResMLP-S12 drops by 8.9% (76.6% ‚Üí‚Üí\\to 67.7%) without the 300-epoch DeiT-style training. 3) RepMLPNet with 100-epoch training delivers a favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off: RepMLPNet-B256 matches the accuracy of ResMLP-B24 without DeiT-style distillation, consumes 1/4 training epochs, has only 40% FLOPs and fewer parameters. 4) With the comparable FLOPs, MLPs are faster than CNNs, e.g., RepMLPNet-D256 has higher FLOPs than ResNeXt-101 but runs 1.6√ó\\times as fast as the latter. This discovery suggests that MLPs are promising as high-throughput inference models. To further demonstrate that FLOPs may not reflect the throughput¬†, we train EfficientNet-B1/B2¬† with the aforementioned 120-epoch strong scheme and report the results in Table¬†3. Interestingly, though EfficientNets have very low FLOPs, the actual performance on GPU is inferior: RepMLPNet-T224 has 4√ó\\times FLOPs as EfficientNet-B1 but runs 1.9√ó\\times as fast as the latter; with comparable throughput, the accuracy of RepMLPNet-B256 is 3.6% higher than EfficientNet-B2. We reckon the high throughput of RepMLPNet on GPU can be attributed to not only the efficiency of matrix multiplication but also the simplicity of architecture hence high degree of parallelism¬†. We then study the effects of two key designs in RepMLP Block: the Global Perceptron and the set-sharing linear mapping of FC3. We increase the number of share-sets ùêíùêí\\bm{\\mathbf{S}} or ablate the Global Perceptron and observe the performance as well as the model size. Fig.¬†4 shows that Global Perceptron only adds negligible parameters and FLOPs (0.5M) but improves the accuracy by around 1%. This is expected as the Local Perceptron and Channel Perceptron do not communicate information across channels, which is compensated by Global Perceptron. By increasing ùêíùêí\\bm{\\mathbf{S}}, fewer channels will be sharing the same set of mapping parameters, resulting in a significant performance gain without any extra FLOPs. Therefore, for the application scenarios where the speed-accuracy trade-off is the primary concern while the model size is not (e.g., in high-power computing centers), we may increase ùêíùêí\\bm{\\mathbf{S}} for higher accuracy.\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: hyper-parameters, as shown in Table¬†1. We evaluate RepMLPNets on ImageNet¬†.
