We present some classic W-hard problems which will be used as starting points of our reductions.\nIn the k𝑘k-Multicolored Independent Set problem, one is given a graph G𝐺G, whose vertex-set is partitioned into k𝑘k sets V1,…,Vksubscript𝑉1…subscript𝑉𝑘V_{1},\\ldots,V_{k}, and is asked if there exists an independent set I⊆V​(G)𝐼𝑉𝐺I\\subseteq V(G) such that |I∩Vi|=1𝐼subscript𝑉𝑖1\\lvert I\\cap V_{i}\\rvert=1 for every i∈[k]𝑖delimited-[]𝑘i\\in[k].\nThe k𝑘k-Multicolored Independent Set problem is a classic W-hard problem when parameterized by k𝑘k 3, and unless the ETH fails, cannot be solved in time f​(k)​|V​(G)|o​(k)𝑓𝑘superscript𝑉𝐺𝑜𝑘f(k){\\lvert V(G)\\rvert}^{o(k)} for any computable function f𝑓f .\nA related problem is k𝑘k-Multicolored Subgraph Isomorphism whose definition goes as follows: \n\n\n\n\nk𝑘k-Multicolored Subgraph Isomorphism\nParameter: k𝑘k\n\n\nInput: An integer k>0𝑘0k>0, a graph G𝐺G whose vertex-set is partitioned into k𝑘k sets V1,…,Vksubscript𝑉1…subscript𝑉𝑘V_{1},\\ldots,V_{k}, and a graph H𝐻H with V​(H)=[k]𝑉𝐻delimited-[]𝑘V(H)=[k].\nQuestion: Is there ϕ:i∈[k]↦vi∈Vi:italic-ϕ𝑖delimited-[]𝑘maps-tosubscript𝑣𝑖subscript𝑉𝑖\\phi:i\\in[k]\\mapsto v_{i}\\in V_{i} such that for all i​j∈E​(H)𝑖𝑗𝐸𝐻ij\\in E(H), ϕ​(i)​ϕ​(j)∈E​(G)italic-ϕ𝑖italic-ϕ𝑗𝐸𝐺\\phi(i)\\phi(j)\\in E(G)?\n\n Even when H𝐻H is a 3-regular graph, k𝑘k-Multicolored Subgraph Isomorphism cannot be solved in time f​(k)​|V​(G)|o​(k/log⁡k)=f​(|E​(H)|)​|V​(G)|o​(|E​(H)|/log⁡|E​(H)|)𝑓𝑘superscript𝑉𝐺𝑜𝑘𝑘𝑓𝐸𝐻superscript𝑉𝐺𝑜𝐸𝐻𝐸𝐻f(k)|V(G)|^{o(k/\\log k)}=f(|E(H)|)|V(G)|^{o(|E(H)|/\\log|E(H)|)}, unless the ETH fails (see Theorem 5.5 in ).\nOne can remove unnecessary edges in G𝐺G (in those E​(Vi,Vj)𝐸subscript𝑉𝑖subscript𝑉𝑗E(V_{i},V_{j}) with i​j∉E​(H)𝑖𝑗𝐸𝐻ij\\notin E(H)) such that ϕ​([k])italic-ϕdelimited-[]𝑘\\phi([k]) and H𝐻H are actually isomorphic in a solution.\nk𝑘k-Multicolored Subgraph Isomorphism allows stronger ETH lower bounds than a reduction from k𝑘k-Multicolored Independent Set when the size of the new parameter depends on the number of edges of the sought pattern. The k𝑘k-by-k𝑘k Grid Tiling, or simply Grid Tiling, introduced by Marx  , is a W-hard problem (see for instance 1) which is a convenient starting point to show parameterized hardness for geometric problems  8.\nIt may turn out useful in other contexts, such as H𝐻H-free graphs [ref]3, and as we will see in this paper for b𝑏b-Chromatic Core. \n\n\n\n\nk𝑘k-by-k𝑘k Grid Tiling (or Grid Tiling)\nParameter: k𝑘k\n\n\nInput: Two integers k,n>0𝑘𝑛0k,n>0, and a set {Pi,j}i,j∈[k]subscriptsubscript𝑃𝑖𝑗𝑖𝑗delimited-[]𝑘\\{P_{i,j}\\}_{i,j\\in[k]} of k2superscript𝑘2k^{2} subsets of pairs in [n]×[n]delimited-[]𝑛delimited-[]𝑛[n]\\times[n].\nQuestion: Can one select exactly one pair (xi,j,yi,j)subscript𝑥𝑖𝑗subscript𝑦𝑖𝑗(x_{i,j},y_{i,j}) in each Pi,jsubscript𝑃𝑖𝑗P_{i,j} such that for every i,j∈[k]𝑖𝑗delimited-[]𝑘i,j\\in[k], xi,j=xi,j+1subscript𝑥𝑖𝑗subscript𝑥𝑖𝑗1x_{i,j}=x_{i,j+1} and yi,j=yi+1,jsubscript𝑦𝑖𝑗subscript𝑦𝑖1𝑗y_{i,j}=y_{i+1,j}?\n\n Observe that the usual (equivalent) definition requires instead xi,j=xi+1,jsubscript𝑥𝑖𝑗subscript𝑥𝑖1𝑗x_{i,j}=x_{i+1,j} and yi,j=yi,j+1subscript𝑦𝑖𝑗subscript𝑦𝑖𝑗1y_{i,j}=y_{i,j+1}.\nWe prefer the other formulation since it is closer to the geometric interpretation of packing squares in the plane.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: a W-hard problem (see for instance 1) which is a convenient starting point to show parameterized hardness for geometric problems  8.\nIt may turn out useful in other contexts, such as H𝐻H-free graphs [ref]3, and as we will see in this paper for b𝑏b-Chromatic Core. \n\n\n\n\nk𝑘k-by-k𝑘k Grid Tiling (or Grid Tiling)\nParameter: k𝑘k\n\n\nInput: Two integers k,n>0𝑘𝑛0k,n>0, and a set\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
