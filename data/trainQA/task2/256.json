Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9. Include reasoning that explains why each title is relevant to the specific [ref] context\n10. Use proper JSON escaping for special characters (escape quotes with \\\")\n11. Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: Bias in Machine Learning - What is it Good for?\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe necessity of inductive bias in machine learning was mentioned in Section 3.1. The same holds at the level of human learning, as discussed in the area of philosophical hermeneutics .\nIn [ref]20 the author argues that we always need some form of prejudice (or bias) to understand and learn about the world.\nReturning to the example in Section 3.1, a decision support system for approval of bank loans is sometimes described as biased and discriminating if it treats certain groups of people differently. It is important to realize that this difference in treatment, in a general sense, is inevitable and rather the main purpose of such a decision support system: to approves some people’s applications, and reject others111111In machine learning this general ability to distinguish between varying input data is even called ‘discrimination’, but without any negative connotations (see for example ).. For example, it may be the bank’s policy to not approve applications by people with very low income. While this technically is the same as rejecting people based on ethnicity, the former may be accepted or even required, while the latter is often referred to as ‘unwanted’ , ‘racial’ , or ‘discriminatory’   (the terms classifier fairness [ref]16   and demographic parity  are sometimes used in this context).\nThe difference between features such as ‘income’ and ‘ethnicity’ has to do with the, already cited, normative meaning of the word bias expressed as ‘an identified causal process which is deemed unfair by society’ . This is further reflected in the notions of protected groups and protected attributes , which simply define away features such as ‘income’, while including features that are viewed as important for equal and fair treatment in our society.\n\nReference markers found: [20]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]20: The necessity of inductive bias in machine learning was mentioned in Section 3.1. The same holds at the level of human learning, as discussed in the area of philosophical hermeneutics .\nIn [ref]20 the author argues that we always need some form of prejudice (or bias) to understand and learn about the world.\nReturning to the example in Section 3.1, a decision support system for approval\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
