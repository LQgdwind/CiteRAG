      "content": "Paper Title: Bridge-Depth Characterizes which Minor-Closed Structural Parameterizations of Vertex Cover Admit a Polynomial Kernel\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe NP-complete Vertex Cover problem is one of the most prominent problems in the field of kernelization     , which investigates provably efficient and effective preprocessing for parameterized problems. A parameterized problem is a decision problem in which a positive integer k𝑘k, called the parameter, is associated with every instance x𝑥x. A kernelization for a parameterized problem is a polynomial-time algorithm that reduces any parameterized instance (x,k)𝑥𝑘(x,k) to an equivalent instance (x′,k′)superscript𝑥′superscript𝑘′(x^{\\prime},k^{\\prime}) of the same problem whose size is bounded by f​(k)𝑓𝑘f(k) for some function f𝑓f, which is the size of the kernelization. Hence a kernelization guarantees that instances that are large compared to their parameter, can be efficiently reduced without changing their answer. Of particular interest are polynomial kernelizations, whose size bound f𝑓f is polynomial. An instance (G,k)𝐺𝑘(G,k) of Vertex Cover asks whether the undirected graph G𝐺G has a vertex set S𝑆S of size at most k𝑘k that contains at least one endpoint of every edge. Using the classic Nemhauser-Trotter theorem , one can reduce (G,k)𝐺𝑘(G,k) in polynomial time to an instance (G′,k′)superscript𝐺′superscript𝑘′(G^{\\prime},k^{\\prime}) with the same answer, such that |V​(G′)|≤2​k𝑉superscript𝐺′2𝑘|V(G^{\\prime})|\\leq 2k. Hence when using the size of the desired solution as the parameter, Vertex Cover has a kernelization that reduces to instances of 2​k2𝑘2k vertices, which can be encoded in 𝒪​(k2)𝒪superscript𝑘2\\mathcal{O}(k^{2}) bits. While the bitsize of this kernelization is known to be essentially optimal  assuming the established conjecture 𝖭𝖯⊈𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯/𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒not-subset-of-or-equals𝖭𝖯𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒\\mathsf{NP\\not\\subseteq coNP/poly}, this result does not guarantee any effect of the preprocessing for instances whose solution has size at least |V​(G)|/2𝑉𝐺2|V(G)|/2. In particular, it does not promise any size reduction when G𝐺G is simply a path. To be able to give better preprocessing guarantees, one can use structural parameters that take on smaller values than the size of a minimum vertex cover, a quantity henceforth called the vertex cover number. Such structural parameterizations can conveniently be described in terms of the vertex-deletion distance to certain graph families ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}. Note that the vertex cover number vc​(G)vc𝐺\\mathrm{\\textsc{vc}}(G) of G𝐺G can be defined as the minimum number of vertex deletions needed to reduce G𝐺G to an edgeless graph. Hence this number will always be at least as large as the feedback vertex number fvs​(G)fvs𝐺\\mathrm{\\textsc{fvs}}(G) of G𝐺G, which is the vertex-deletion distance of G𝐺G to a forest. In 2011, it was shown that Vertex Cover even admits a polynomial kernelization when parameterized by the feedback vertex number  [ref]22. This triggered a long line of follow-up research, which aimed to find the most general graph families ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} such that Vertex Cover admits a polynomial kernelization when parameterized by vertex-deletion distance to ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}. Polynomial kernelizations were obtained for the families ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} of graphs of maximum degree two , of graphs of constant tree-depth  , of the pseudo-forests where each connected component has at most one cycle [ref]17, and for d𝑑d-pseudo-forests in which each connected component has a feedback vertex set of size at most d∈𝒪​(1)𝑑𝒪1d\\in\\mathcal{O}(1) [ref]18. Note that all these target graph classes are closed under taking minors. Using randomized algorithms with a small error probability, polynomial kernelizations are also known for several parameterizations by vertex-deletion distance to graph classes that are not minor-closed, such as Kőnig graphs , bipartite graphs , and parameterizations based on the linear-programming relaxation of Vertex Cover  . On the negative side, it is known that Vertex Cover parameterized by the vertex-deletion distance to a graph of treewidth two  does not have a polynomial kernel, unless 𝖭𝖯⊆𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯/𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒𝖭𝖯𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒\\mathsf{NP\\subseteq coNP/poly}. This long line of research into kernelization for structural parameterizations raises the following question: How can we characterize the graph families ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} for which Vertex Cover parameterized by vertex-deletion distance to ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} admits a polynomial kernel? We answer this question for all minor-closed families ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}, by introducing a new graph parameter. We introduce a new graph parameter that we call bridge-depth. It has a recursive definition similar to that of tree-depth 0 (full definitions follow in Section 3), but deals with bridges in a special way. A graph without vertices has bridge-depth zero. The bridge-depth 𝖻𝖽​(G)𝖻𝖽𝐺{\\sf bd}(G) of a disconnected graph G𝐺G is simply the maximum bridge-depth of its connected components. The bridge-depth of a connected nonempty graph G𝐺G is defined as follows. Let Gcbsubscript𝐺cb{G}_{\\textsc{cb}} denote the graph obtained from G𝐺G by contracting each edge that is a bridge in G𝐺G; the order does not matter. Then 𝖻𝖽​(G):=1+minv∈V​(Gcb)⁡𝖻𝖽​(Gcb∖v)assign𝖻𝖽𝐺1subscript𝑣𝑉subscript𝐺cb𝖻𝖽subscript𝐺cb𝑣{\\sf bd}(G):=1+\\min_{v\\in V({G}_{\\textsc{cb}})}{\\sf bd}({G}_{\\textsc{cb}}\\setminus v). Intuitively, the bridge-depth of G𝐺G is given by the depth of an elimination process  that reduces G𝐺G to the empty graph. One step consists of contracting all bridges and removing a vertex; each of the remaining connected components is then recursively eliminated in parallel. From this definition, it is not difficult to see that 𝖻𝖽​(G)𝖻𝖽𝐺{\\sf bd}(G) is at least as large as the tree-width of G𝐺G, but never larger than the tree-depth or feedback vertex number of G𝐺G. In particular, any forest has bridge-depth one. Using the notion of bridge-depth, we characterize the minor-closed families ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} for which Vertex Cover parameterized by vertex-deletion distance to ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} admits a polynomial kernel. Let ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} be a minor-closed family of graphs, and assume 𝖭𝖯⊈𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯/𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒not-subset-of-or-equals𝖭𝖯𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒\\mathsf{NP\\not\\subseteq coNP/poly}. Vertex Cover parameterized by vertex-deletion distance to ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} has a polynomial kernelization if and only if ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} has bounded bridge-depth. Theorem 1.1 gives a clean and unified explanation for all the minor-closed families ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} that were previously considered individually  [ref]17 [ref]18 [ref]22 , and generalizes these results as far as possible. To the best of our knowledge, Theorem 1.1 captures all known (deterministic) kernelizations for structural parameterizations of Vertex Cover. (There are randomized kernelizations    that apply for distance to classes ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} that are not minor-closed, such as bipartite graphs.) For example, we capture the case of ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} being a forest [ref]22 since forests have bridge-depth one, and the case of ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} being graphs of constant tree-depth   since bridge-depth does not exceed tree-depth.\nIn this sense, bridge-depth can be seen as the ultimate common generalization of feedback vertex number and tree-depth (which are incomparable parameters) in the context of polynomial kernels for Vertex Cover. We consider it one of our main contributions to identify the graph parameter bridge-depth as the right way to capture the kernelization complexity of Vertex Cover parameterizations. To describe our techniques, we introduce some terminology. Let α​(G)𝛼𝐺\\alpha(G) denote the independence number of graph G𝐺G, i.e., the maximum size of a set of pairwise nonadjacent vertices. A blocking set in a graph G𝐺G is a vertex set Y⊆V​(G)𝑌𝑉𝐺Y\\subseteq V(G) such that α​(G∖Y)<α​(G)𝛼𝐺𝑌𝛼𝐺\\alpha(G\\setminus Y)<\\alpha(G). Hence if Y𝑌Y is a blocking set, then every maximum independent set in G𝐺G contains a vertex from Y𝑌Y. The connection between blocking sets and the kernelization of Vertex Cover has been already exploited in previous work. Namely, earlier kernelizations for Vertex Cover parameterized by distance to a graph class ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}, starting with the work of Jansen and Bodlaender [ref]22, all rely, either implicitly or explicitly, on having upper-bounds on the size of (inclusion-)minimal blocking sets for graphs in ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}  [ref]17 [ref]18 [ref]22 . For example, it is known that minimal blocking sets in a bipartite graph have size at most two [18, Cor. 11], while minimal blocking sets in graphs of tree-depth c𝑐c have size at most 2csuperscript2𝑐2^{c} [4, Lemma 1]. Similarly, all the existing superpolynomial kernelization lower bounds for parameterizations by distance to ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}, rely on ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} having minimal blocking sets of arbitrarily large size. Indeed, if ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} is closed under disjoint union and has arbitrarily large blocking sets, it is easy to prove a superpolynomial lower bound (cf. [19, Thm. 1]). Since all positive cases for kernelization are when minimal blocking sets of graphs in ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} have bounded size, while one easily obtains lower bounds when the size of minimal blocking sets of graphs in ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} is unbounded, the question rises whether a bound on the size of minimal blocking sets is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of polynomial kernels. To our initial surprise, we show that for minor-closed families ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}, this is indeed the case: the purely structural property of having bounded-size minimal blocking sets can always be leveraged into preprocessing algorithms. For an insight into our techniques, consider an instance (G,k)𝐺𝑘(G,k) of Vertex Cover, together with a vertex set X⊆V​(G)𝑋𝑉𝐺X\\subseteq V(G) such that G∖X∈ℱ𝐺𝑋ℱG\\setminus X\\in\\mathcal{F} for some minor-closed family ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} that has bounded-size minimal blocking sets.\nThe goal of the kernelization is then to reduce to an equivalent instance of size |X|𝒪​(1)superscript𝑋𝒪1|X|^{\\mathcal{O}(1)} in polynomial time. Using ideas of the previous kernelizations [ref]22 , it is quite simple to reduce the number of connected components of G∖X𝐺𝑋G\\setminus X to |X|𝒪​(1)superscript𝑋𝒪1|X|^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}. To obtain a polynomial kernel, the challenge is therefore to bound the size of each such component C𝐶C of G∖X𝐺𝑋G\\setminus X to |X|𝒪​(1)superscript𝑋𝒪1|X|^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}, so that the overall instance size becomes polynomial in |X|𝑋|X|. However, the non-existence of large minimal blocking sets does not seem to offer any handle for reducing the size of individual components of G∖X𝐺𝑋G\\setminus X. The route to the kernelization therefore goes via the detour of bridge-depth. We prove the following relation between the sizes of minimal blocking sets and bridge-depth. Let ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} be a minor-closed family of graphs. Then ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} has bounded bridge-depth if and only if the size of minimal blocking sets of graphs in ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} is bounded. Using this equivalence, we can exploit the fact that all minimal blocking sets of ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} are of bounded size, through the fact that the bridge-depth of G∖X∈ℱ𝐺𝑋ℱG\\setminus X\\in\\mathcal{F} is small. This means that there is a bounded-depth elimination process to reduce G∖X𝐺𝑋G\\setminus X to the empty graph. We use this bounded-depth process in a technical kernelization algorithm following a recursive scheme, inspired by the earlier kernelization for the parameterization by distance to bounded tree-depth . Let us now discuss the ideas behind the equivalence of Theorem 1.2. We prove that the bridge-depth of graphs in a minor-closed family ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} is upper-bounded in terms of the maximum size of minimal blocking sets for graphs in ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}, by exploiting the Erdős-Pósa property in an interesting way. We analyze an elementary graph structure called necklace of length t𝑡t, which is essentially the multigraph formed by a path of t𝑡t double-edges. If a simple graph G∈ℱ𝐺ℱG\\in\\mathcal{F} contains a necklace of length t𝑡t as a minor, then there is a minor G′superscript𝐺′G^{\\prime} of G𝐺G (which therefore also belongs to ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}) that has a minimal blocking set of size Ω​(t)Ω𝑡\\Omega(t). Hence to show that bridge-depth is upper-bounded in terms of the size of minimal blocking sets of graphs in ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}, it suffices to show that bridge-depth is upper-bounded by the maximum length of a necklace minor of graphs in ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}. Since the definition of bridge-depth allows for the contraction of all bridges in a single step, it suffices to consider bridgeless graphs. Then we argue that in a bridgeless graph, any pair of maximum-length necklace minor models intersects at a vertex (cf. Lemma 4.7). By the Erdős-Pósa property, this implies that there is a constant-size vertex set that hits all maximum-length necklace minor models, and whose removal therefore strictly decreases the maximum length of a necklace minor. If the length of necklace minor models is bounded, then after a bounded number of steps of this process (interleaved with contracting all bridges) we reduce the maximum length of necklace minor models to zero, which is equivalent to breaking all cycles of the graph. At that point, the bridge-depth is one by definition, and we have obtained the desired upper-bound on the bridge-depth in terms of the length of the longest necklace minor, and therefore blocking set size. For the other direction of Theorem 1.2, we prove (cf. Theorem 5.5) the tight bound that a minimal blocking set in a graph G𝐺G has size at most 2𝖻𝖽​(G)superscript2𝖻𝖽𝐺2^{{\\sf bd}(G)}. We use induction to prove this statement, together with an analysis of the structure of a tree of bridges whose removal\ndecreases the bridge-depth. The fact that bipartite graphs have minimal blocking sets of size at most two, allows for an elegant induction step. In a recent paper, Hols, Kratsch, and Pieterse  also analyze the role of blocking sets in the existence of polynomial kernels for structural parameterizations of Vertex Cover. Note that our paper is independent from, and orthogonal to : we consider the setting of deterministic kernelization algorithms for parameterizations to minor-closed families ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}, and obtain an exact characterization of which ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} allow for a polynomial kernelization. Hols et al.  consider hereditary families ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} and give kernelizations for several such parameterizations, without arriving at a complete characterization. Some of the randomized kernelizations they provide do not fit into our framework, but all the deterministic kernelizations they present are captured by Theorem 1.1. Another contribution of  is to prove that there is a class ℱℱ\\mathcal{F} with minimal blocking sets of size one where Vertex Cover cannot be solved in polynomial time. In particular, there is no polynomial kernel parameterized by the distance to this family ℱℱ\\mathcal{F}, and thus bounded minimal blocking set size is not sufficient to get a polynomial kernel. This implies that our minor-closed assumption of Theorem 1.1 cannot be dropped. We refer to the survey by Fellows et al.  for an overview of classic results and new research lines concerning kernelization for Vertex Cover. Additional relevant work includes the work by Kratsch  on a randomized polynomial kernel for a parameterization related to the difference between twice the cost of the linear-programming relaxation of Vertex Cover and the size of a maximum matching. Preliminaries on graphs and complexity are presented in Section 2. Section 3 introduces bridge-depth and its properties. In Section 4 we prove one direction of Theorem 1.2, showing that large bridge-depth implies the existence of large minimal blocking sets. In Section 5 we handle the other direction, proving a tight upper-bound on the size of minimal blocking sets in terms of the bridge-depth. We present the kernelization algorithm exploiting bridge-depth in Section 6, and we conclude the article in Section 7.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: of G𝐺G, which is the vertex-deletion distance of G𝐺G to a forest.
