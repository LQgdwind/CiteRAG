      "content": "Paper Title: MS-DARTS: Mean-Shift Based Differentiable Architecture Search\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent development of convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures has advanced substantially in several fields including computer vision and language models. Manual CNN architecture design is still a common practice nowadays; However, it can take substantial amount of time and efforts. Alternatively, network architecture design process can be automated, which might lead to improved models with lower costs and fewer computational time. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a technique for automating this network design process, where a large set of possible architectures are explored and optimized. NAS has growing popularity that can potentially replace the manual, trial-and-error paradigm of CNN architecture design in various fields. NAS techniques  [ref]1  [ref]3 can automatically find suitable network architectures depending on the application needs. In some cases, the resulting model can outperform networks designed by human experts. This automatic architecture search is performed upon three conceptual components: (1) The search space defines the possible architectures as a principal representation for design optimization.\n(2) The search strategy defines the exploration technique to be performed in the search space.\n(3) The performance estimation strategy evaluates the predictive performance of a given architecture on unseen data. NAS approaches generally fall into two paradigms: heuristic search and differentiable search. Heuristic NAS methods contain two sub-categories: (i) evolution based e.g., AmoebaNet  and hierarchical evolution  and (ii) reinforcement learning (RL) based e.g., NAS , NASNet , and ENAS . The bottleneck of heuristic search algorithms is typically the high computational cost in validating the accuracy of various architecture candidates during the model generation and optimization process. RL-based methods take accuracy as the reward to decide if a candidate model should be removed in the process. Despite their effectiveness in finding high-quality architectures, these approaches often require high computational cost (many GPU days) . These methods are often impractical due to computational resource limitation. Differentiable NAS methods such as DARTS [ref]3  \nbuild a supernet with a set of architectural parameters. Based on the supernet, the search process optimizes both network parameters and architectural parameters in a single training framework. The best architecture is generated with optimized parameters . DARTS methods are efficient when running with limited computational resources. Despite of the computational efficiency, DARTS faces stability and generalizability issues of the obtained network architectures [SantraSurvey]. Although the validation accuracy of the mixture architecture can be improved, performance of the derived architecture often collapses at the final evaluation stage, when discretizing the continuous architecture representation into a discrete one (the actual network architecture) [ref]11 . Such instability makes DARTS producing unwanted architectures. For example, parameter-free operations such as skip connections usually dominate the generated architecture [ref]11. DARTS algorithms often prefer wide and shallow structures . In R-DARTS [ref]11, early-stopping based on hand generated criteria is proposed to address these issues. However, this solution does not always work, since the intrinsic instability can occur from the beginning of the search process. The key discretization step at the end of DARTS is performed by projecting a continuous architecture onto a discrete representation manifold to derive the best discrete architecture as output. Oftentimes this projection step can cause significant performance drop between the mixture architecture (found by gradient-based optimization in super-network) and the obtained discrete architecture. It is shown in DA2S  that even when the super-network achieves around 90%percent9090\\% accuracy when trained on CIFAR-10  , sub-architecture without parameter re-training often reports less than 20%percent2020\\% accuracy on the same dataset.\nDARTS adopts the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) approach to optimize the cost function and then derives the desired architecture parameters. The SGD method makes DARTS mostly converge to a sharp minimum which is sensitive to perturbation. Then, slight perturbations will result insignificant cost increase and dramatically decrease the test accuracy. Such “projection gap” prevents DARTS from performing a full exploration of the architecture space in a stable way. Mean-Shift based DARTS. This paper addresses this instability problem from two viewpoints, i.e., robust minimization and optimization generalization. For robust minimization, we search the optimal network architecture by minimizing its worst-case cost. For optimization generalization, we smooth out sharp minima and guide the convergence of SGD to wider and flatter minima by proposing an improved DARTS approach based on the mean-shift sampling scheme . As shown in R-DARTS [ref]11, the instability of DARTS converging into a sharp minimum is caused by the searching process mostly along a peak surface of the validation loss function. We study the stabilization of DARTS via architecture perturbation, where the mean-shift serves as our perturbation and smoothing policy that can effectively smooth out the landscape of the loss function. We are the first to investigate the adaptation of mean-shift for DARTS, and provide mathematical justification of this approach w.r.t. The ‘mean’ operation will smooth out sharp minima and guide the convergence of DARTS to flatter minima which results in good generalization and accuracy stability. Since the search surface becomes flatter, a large prediction can be made via the ‘shift’ operation so that better efficiency in architecture search is gained. The above reasons can explain why our proposed Mean-Shift based DARTS (MS-DARTS) can stabilize and speed up the differentiable architecture search. Figure.1 overviews our approach, where mean-shift governs the projection of the continuous searched architecture into a discrete one in a flat, stable, efficient, and accurate way. Intuitively, our optimization of the architecture search is based on perturbation and robust mean-shifting to generate flatter minima in architecture configurations, and produce benefits in optimization generation. For robust minimization, we search the optimal network architecture by optimizing its worst-case cost which is the maximum loss among its local weighted architecture candidates selected according to their performances rather than relying on a single sample. MS-DARTS essentially adopts an attention-based sampling scheme to smooth out sharp minima and thus can bypass local fluctuations to generate flatter loss landscape. It uses a Gaussian distribution to sample data points. This paper also investigates the behaviors of its bandwidth parameter to smooth out the sharp minima. We will show later that such smooth representation landscape can be quantified using the eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix of the generated architectures. Better stability can be observed by examining the accuracy differences before and after discretizing the best continuous models. Experimental results in chapter 4 show that the MS-DARTS generated architectures achieve better stability and efficiency, compared to SoTA DARTS methods without performance declining. Contributions of this paper include: Proving the mean-shift design can smooth out the sharp minima caused by DARTS-based NAS to flatter minima from which significant performance drop can be avoided. Theoretical analysis is provided for the behaviors of mean-shift on affecting the stability and accuracy of DARTS, together with the effects of bandwidth selection. Theoretical investigate for the effects of the bandwidth parameter of mean-shift algorithm to smooth out the sharp minima is also provided. Experimental evaluations comparing MS-DARTS against state-of-the-art (SoTA) NAS models on various search spaces and image classification datasets demonstrate improvements in both accuracy and computation cost.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: architectures are explored and optimized.
