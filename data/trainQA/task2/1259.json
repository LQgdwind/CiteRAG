      "content": "Paper Title: Motion-based Camera Localization System in Colonoscopy Videos\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nCamera motion tracking in endoscopic videos has been investigated in a few studies previously. An optical flow approach to tracking colonoscopy video was proposed in 0. The focus of expansion (FOE) was calculated using a combination of sparse and dense optical flow calculations. Based on calculated FOE, the computation of the camera’s rotation and translation parameters from the optical flow field were separated. The depth of frame was estimated from a tube-like model. This approach is sensitive to optical flow and FOE calculations. In , Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi features were extracted and tracked through consecutive frames. After that, a visual odometry algorithm was used to calculate camera motion by assuming each pair of consecutive frames to be a stereo pair. In this approach, the translation parameters estimated from visual odometry are subject to arbitrary scaling. The camera’s speed has to be used to facilitate camera motion estimation, which makes it somewhat impractical.\nDeep learning has also been applied to camera pose estimation for endoscopic videos. A convolutional neural network was proposed in  to estimate the pose of the colonoscope. The network was trained and evaluated on simulated videos. Their results showed that the pose estimation from CNN was more accurate and faster than feature-based computer vision methods. In [ref]39, the depth map was first estimated from images using the Tsai–Shah Shape from Shading method 4. After that, a recurrent convolutional neural network was applied to model dynamics across the frames and estimate the camera pose. While the evaluation on a real pig stomach dataset showed that the method achieved high translational and rotational accuracy, ground truth for camera pose was also required to train the network. A self-supervised framework has also been applied to endoscopic videos. In , SfMLeaner was applied to estimate the motion of the endoscopic capsule robot. Evaluations on videos collected from ex-vivo porcine stomach were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. In 3, a calibration-free framework was proposed by estimating the camera intrinsic parameters. In 7, temporal information among consecutive frames was explored by a long-short-term-memory layer to improve the accuracy of pose estimation.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: The network was trained and evaluated on simulated videos.
