Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

Then, we compare our method to the\nmethods that modify language modules (DLR [ref]24, VGQE ),\nstrengthen visual attention (HINT , SCR ),\nensemble based methods, (AReg , RUBi , LMH , CF-VQA , GGE 9)\nand balance training data by changeing the training distribution (CVL , RandImg , SSL , CSS [ref]9, Mutant 5, D-VQA , KDDAug 0) in the respective sections.\nAmong the balancing training data methods, while some methods swap the image and questions from the supposed pairs   , counterfactuals based methods generate counterfactual samples masking critical words or objects [ref]9 or by using an external inpainting network to create a new subset of data 5. In addition, as IntroD  is seen as a technique built on top of certain previous methods, we include the scores in their respective categories.\nOur model (GenB) is in line with the ensemble models listed.\nFollowing previous works , we do not compare to methods that change training distribution as these methods conflict with the original intent of VQA-CP (which is to test whether VQA models rely on prior training data )\nand are listed in the bottom of Table 1. In Table 1, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on VQA-CP2, surpassing the second best (GGE 9) by 1.83%.\nThe performance of our model on all three categories (“Yes/No,” “Num,” “Other”)\nare within top-3 consistently for the same backbone architecture.\nOur method also performs highly favorably on “Other”. We also show how our method performs on the VQA-CP1 dataset, which is a subset of the VQA-CP2 dataset.\nNote that not all of the baselines are listed as we only list the scores that are available in the respective papers.\nOur method also shows the state-of-the-art results on this dataset with a significant performance improvement over the second best among the methods compared, CF-VQA(SUM) .\nEven when compared to the available method CSS , that we do not compare as it is considered unfair according to , our method shows a significant gap in performance.\nCompared to the second best method, CF-VQA(Sum)  on UpDn, our method improves the overall performance by 5.60% while also having the best performance in both “Num” and “Other” category, by 3.28% and 2.41% performance improvements respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: focus on bias reduction as shown in Table 1.\nFor VQA-CP2, we first list the baseline architectures in the first section.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
