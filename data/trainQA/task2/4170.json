      "content": "Paper Title: Combinatorial Pure Exploration of Causal Bandits\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we discuss the pure exploration for BGLM, a general class of causal graphs with a linear number of parameters, as defined\nin Section 2. In this section, we assume 𝑼=∅𝑼\\boldsymbol{U}=\\emptyset.\nLet 𝜽∗=(𝜽X∗)X∈𝑿∪{Y}superscript𝜽subscriptsubscriptsuperscript𝜽𝑋𝑋𝑿𝑌\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}=(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}_{X})_{X\\in\\boldsymbol{X}\\cup\\{Y\\}} be the vector of all weights.\nSince X1subscript𝑋1X_{1} is a global variable,\nwe only need to consider the action\nset 𝑨⊆{d​o​(𝑺=𝒔)∣𝑺⊆𝑿∖{X1},𝒔∈{0,1}|𝑺|}𝑨conditional-set𝑑𝑜𝑺𝒔formulae-sequence𝑺𝑿subscript𝑋1𝒔superscript01𝑺\\boldsymbol{A}\\subseteq\\{do(\\boldsymbol{S}=\\boldsymbol{s})\\mid\\boldsymbol{S}\\subseteq\\boldsymbol{X}\\setminus\\{X_{1}\\},\\boldsymbol{s}\\in\\{0,1\\}^{|\\boldsymbol{S}|}\\}.\nFollowing [ref]22 0, we have three assumptions: For any X∈𝐗∪{Y}𝑋𝐗𝑌X\\in\\boldsymbol{X}\\cup\\{Y\\}, fXsubscript𝑓𝑋f_{X} is twice differentiable. Its first and second order derivatives can be upper bounded by constant M(1)superscript𝑀1M^{(1)} and M(2)superscript𝑀2M^{(2)}. κ:=infX∈𝑿∪{Y},𝒗∈[ref]0 𝑷𝒂​(X),‖𝜽−𝜽X∗‖≤1f˙X​(𝒗⋅𝜽)>0assign𝜅subscriptinfimumformulae-sequence𝑋𝑿𝑌formulae-sequence𝒗superscript01𝑷𝒂𝑋norm𝜽superscriptsubscript𝜽𝑋1subscript˙𝑓𝑋⋅𝒗𝜽0\\kappa:=\\inf_{X\\in\\boldsymbol{X}\\cup\\{Y\\},\\boldsymbol{v}\\in[ref]0 ^{\\boldsymbol{\\it Pa}(X)},||\\boldsymbol{\\theta}-\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{X}^{*}||\\leq 1}\\dot{f}_{X}(\\boldsymbol{v}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\theta})>0 is a positive constant. There exists a constant η>0𝜂0\\eta>0 such that for any X∈𝐗∪{Y}𝑋𝐗𝑌X\\in\\boldsymbol{X}\\cup\\{Y\\} and X′∈𝐏𝐚​(X)superscript𝑋′𝐏𝐚𝑋X^{\\prime}\\in\\boldsymbol{\\it Pa}(X), for any 𝐯∈{0,1}|𝐏𝐚​(X)−2|𝐯superscript01𝐏𝐚𝑋2\\boldsymbol{v}\\in\\{0,1\\}^{|\\boldsymbol{\\it Pa}(X)-2|} and x∈{0,1}𝑥01x\\in\\{0,1\\}, we have Assumptions 1 and 2 are the classical assumptions in generalized linear model [ref]22.\nAssumption 3 makes sure that each parent node of X𝑋X has some freedom to become 0 and 1 with a non-zero probability, even when the values of all other parents of X𝑋X\nare fixed, and it is originally given in 0 with additional justifications.\nHenceforth, we use σ​(𝜽,a)𝜎𝜽𝑎\\sigma(\\boldsymbol{\\theta},a) to denote the reward μasubscript𝜇𝑎\\mu_{a} on parameter 𝜽𝜽\\boldsymbol{\\theta}. Our main algorithm, Causal Combinatorial Pure Exploration-BGLM (CCPE-BGLM), is given in Algorithm 1.\nThe algorithm follows the LUCB framework 5, but has several innovations.\nIn each round t𝑡t, we play three actions and thus it corresponds to three rounds in the general CPE model.\nIn each round t𝑡t, we maintain μ^O,atsubscriptsuperscript^𝜇𝑡𝑂𝑎\\hat{\\mu}^{t}_{O,a} and μ^I,atsubscriptsuperscript^𝜇𝑡𝐼𝑎\\hat{\\mu}^{t}_{I,a} as the estimates of μasubscript𝜇𝑎\\mu_{a} from the observational data and the interventional data, respectively.\nFor each estimate, we maintain its confidence interval, [LO,at,UO,at]superscriptsubscript𝐿𝑂𝑎𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑈𝑂𝑎𝑡[L_{O,a}^{t},U_{O,a}^{t}] and [LI,at,UI,at]superscriptsubscript𝐿𝐼𝑎𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑈𝐼𝑎𝑡[L_{I,a}^{t},U_{I,a}^{t}] respectively. At the beginning of round t𝑡t, similar to LUCB, we find two candidate actions, one with the highest empirical mean so far, aht−1superscriptsubscript𝑎ℎ𝑡1a_{h}^{t-1}; and one with the highest UCB among the rest, alt−1superscriptsubscript𝑎𝑙𝑡1a_{l}^{t-1}.\nIf the LCB of aht−1superscriptsubscript𝑎ℎ𝑡1a_{h}^{t-1} is higher than the UCB of alt−1superscriptsubscript𝑎𝑙𝑡1a_{l}^{t-1} with an ε𝜀\\varepsilon error, then the algorithm could stop and return aht−1superscriptsubscript𝑎ℎ𝑡1a_{h}^{t-1} as the best action.\nHowever, the second stopping condition in line 5 is new, and it is used to guarantee that the observational estimates μ^O,atsubscriptsuperscript^𝜇𝑡𝑂𝑎\\hat{\\mu}^{t}_{O,a}’s are from enough samples.\nIf the stopping condition is not met, we will do three steps.\nThe first step is the novel observation step comparing to LUCB.\nIn this step, we do the null intervention d​o​()𝑑𝑜do(), collect observational data, use maximum-likelihood estimate adapted from [ref]22 0 to obtain parameter estimate\nθ^tsubscript^𝜃𝑡\\hat{\\theta}_{t}, and then use θ^tsubscript^𝜃𝑡\\hat{\\theta}_{t} to compute observational estimate μ^O,at=σ​(θ^t,a)subscriptsuperscript^𝜇𝑡𝑂𝑎𝜎subscript^𝜃𝑡𝑎\\hat{\\mu}^{t}_{O,a}=\\sigma(\\hat{\\theta}_{t},a) for all action a𝑎a, where σ​(θ^t,a)𝜎subscript^𝜃𝑡𝑎\\sigma(\\hat{\\theta}_{t},a) means the reward for action a𝑎a on parameter θ^tsubscript^𝜃𝑡\\hat{\\theta}_{t}. This\ncan be efficiently done by\nfollowing the topological order of nodes in G𝐺G and parameter θ^tsubscript^𝜃𝑡\\hat{\\theta}_{t}.\nFrom μ^O,atsubscriptsuperscript^𝜇𝑡𝑂𝑎\\hat{\\mu}^{t}_{O,a}, we obtain the confidence interval [LO,at,UO,at]superscriptsubscript𝐿𝑂𝑎𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑈𝑂𝑎𝑡[L_{O,a}^{t},U_{O,a}^{t}] using the bonus term defined later in Eq.(10).\nIn the second step, we play the two candidate actions aht−1superscriptsubscript𝑎ℎ𝑡1a_{h}^{t-1} and alt−1superscriptsubscript𝑎𝑙𝑡1a_{l}^{t-1} and update their interventional estimates and confidence intervals, as in LUCB.\nIn the third step, we merge the two estimates together and set the final estimate μ^atsuperscriptsubscript^𝜇𝑎𝑡\\hat{\\mu}_{a}^{t} to be the mid point of the intersection of two confidence intervals.\nWhile the second step follows the LUCB, the first and the third step are new, and they are crucial for utilizing the observational data to obtain quick estimates for many actions at once. Utilizing observational data has been explored in past causal bandit studies, but they separate the exploration from observations and the interventions into two stages\n9 , and thus their algorithms are not adaptive and cannot provide gap-dependent sample complexity bounds.\nOur algorithm innovation is in that we interleave the observation step and the intervention step naturally into the adaptive LUCB framework, so that we can achieve an adaptive balance between\nobservation and intervention, achieving the best of both worlds. To get the confidence bound for BGLM, we use the following lemma from 0: For an action a=d​o​(𝐒=𝐬)𝑎𝑑𝑜𝐒𝐬a=do(\\boldsymbol{S}=\\boldsymbol{s}) and any two weight vectors 𝛉𝛉{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} and 𝛉′superscript𝛉′{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{\\prime}}, we have where N𝐒,Ysubscript𝑁𝐒𝑌N_{\\boldsymbol{S},Y} is the set of all nodes that lie on all possible paths from X1subscript𝑋1X_{1} to Y𝑌Y excluding 𝐒𝐒\\boldsymbol{S}, 𝐕Xsubscript𝐕𝑋\\boldsymbol{V}_{X} is the value vector of\na sample of the parents of X𝑋X according to parameter 𝛉𝛉\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, M(1)superscript𝑀1M^{(1)} is defined in Assumption 1, and the expectation is taken\non the randomness of the noise term 𝐞=(eX)X∈𝐗∪{Y}𝐞subscriptsubscript𝑒𝑋𝑋𝐗𝑌\\boldsymbol{e}=(e_{X})_{X\\in\\boldsymbol{X}\\cup\\{Y\\}} of causal model under parameter 𝛉𝛉\\boldsymbol{\\theta}. The key idea in the design and analysis of the algorithm is to divide the actions into two sets — the easy actions and the hard actions.\nIntuitively, the easy actions are the ones that can be easily estimated by observational data, while the hard actions require direction playing these actions to get accurate estimates.\nThe quantity qasubscript𝑞𝑎q_{a} mentioned in Section 3 indicates how easy is action a𝑎a, and it determines the\ngap-dependent observational threshold mε,Δsubscript𝑚𝜀Δm_{\\varepsilon,\\Delta} (Definition 2), which essentially gives the number of hard actions.\nIn fact, the set of actions in Eq.(6) with τ=mε,Δ𝜏subscript𝑚𝜀Δ\\tau=m_{\\varepsilon,\\Delta} is the set of hard actions and the rest are easy actions. We need to define qasubscript𝑞𝑎q_{a} representing the hardness of estimation for each a𝑎a. For CCPE-BGLM, we define its qa(L)superscriptsubscript𝑞𝑎𝐿q_{a}^{(L)} as follows.\nLet D=maxX∈𝑿∪{Y}⁡|𝑷𝒂​(X)|𝐷subscript𝑋𝑿𝑌𝑷𝒂𝑋D=\\max_{X\\in\\boldsymbol{X}\\cup\\{Y\\}}|\\boldsymbol{\\it Pa}(X)|. For node 𝑺⊆𝑿𝑺𝑿\\boldsymbol{S}\\subseteq\\boldsymbol{X}, let ℓ𝑺=|N𝑺,Y|subscriptℓ𝑺subscript𝑁𝑺𝑌\\ell_{\\boldsymbol{S}}=|N_{\\boldsymbol{S},Y}|.\nThen for a=d​o​(𝑺=𝒔)𝑎𝑑𝑜𝑺𝒔a=do(\\boldsymbol{S}=\\boldsymbol{s}), we define Intuitively, based on Lemma 2 and ℓ𝑺=|N𝑺,Y|subscriptℓ𝑺subscript𝑁𝑺𝑌\\ell_{\\boldsymbol{S}}=|N_{\\boldsymbol{S},Y}|, a large ℓ𝑺subscriptℓ𝑺\\ell_{\\boldsymbol{S}} means that\nthe right-hand side of Inequality (8) could be large, and thus\nit is difficult to estimate μasubscript𝜇𝑎\\mu_{a} accurately.\nHence the term qa(L)superscriptsubscript𝑞𝑎𝐿q_{a}^{(L)} represents how easy it is to estimate for action a𝑎a.\nNote that qa(L)superscriptsubscript𝑞𝑎𝐿q_{a}^{(L)} only depends on the graph structure and set 𝑺𝑺\\boldsymbol{S}.\nWe can define m(L)superscript𝑚𝐿m^{(L)} and mε,Δ(L)superscriptsubscript𝑚𝜀Δ𝐿m_{\\varepsilon,\\Delta}^{(L)} with respect to qa(L)superscriptsubscript𝑞𝑎𝐿q_{a}^{(L)}’s by Definitions 1 and 2.\nWe use two confidence radius terms as follows, one from the estimate of the observational data, and the other from the estimate of the interventional data. Parameters αOsubscript𝛼𝑂\\alpha_{O} and αIsubscript𝛼𝐼\\alpha_{I} are exploration parameters for our algorithm.\nFor a theoretical guarantee, we choose αOsubscript𝛼𝑂\\alpha_{O} = 6​2626\\sqrt{2} and αIsubscript𝛼𝐼\\alpha_{I} = 2, but more aggressive αOsubscript𝛼𝑂\\alpha_{O} and αIsubscript𝛼𝐼\\alpha_{I}\ncould be used in experiments. (e.g. , 8, 3)\nThe sample complexity of CCPE-BGLM is summarized in the following theorem.\n With probability 1−δ1𝛿1-\\delta, our CCPE-BGLM(G,𝑨,ε,δ/2)𝐺𝑨𝜀𝛿2(G,\\boldsymbol{A},\\varepsilon,\\delta/2) returns an ε𝜀\\varepsilon-optimal arm with sample complexity where mε,Δ(L),Hmε,Δ(L)superscriptsubscript𝑚𝜀Δ𝐿subscript𝐻superscriptsubscript𝑚𝜀Δ𝐿m_{\\varepsilon,\\Delta}^{(L)},H_{m_{\\varepsilon,\\Delta}^{(L)}} are defined in Definition 2 and Eq.(5) in terms of qa(L)superscriptsubscript𝑞𝑎𝐿q_{a}^{(L)}’s for a∈𝐀∖{d​o​()}𝑎𝐀𝑑𝑜a\\in\\boldsymbol{A}\\setminus\\{do()\\} defined in Eq.(9). If we treat the problem as a naive |𝑨|𝑨|\\boldsymbol{A}|-arms bandit, the sample complexity of LUCB1 is O~​(H)=O~​(∑a∈𝑨1max{Δa,ε/2}2)\\widetilde{O}(H)=\\widetilde{O}(\\sum_{a\\in\\boldsymbol{A}}\\frac{1}{\\max\\{\\Delta_{a},\\varepsilon/2\\}^{2}}), which may contain an exponential number of terms.\nNow note that qa(L)≥1n5superscriptsubscript𝑞𝑎𝐿1superscript𝑛5q_{a}^{(L)}\\geq\\frac{1}{n^{5}}, it is easy to show that mε,Δ(L)≤2​n5superscriptsubscript𝑚𝜀Δ𝐿2superscript𝑛5m_{\\varepsilon,\\Delta}^{(L)}\\leq 2n^{5}. Hence Hmε,Δ(L)subscript𝐻superscriptsubscript𝑚𝜀Δ𝐿H_{m_{\\varepsilon,\\Delta}^{(L)}} contains only a polynomial number of terms.\nOther causal bandit algorithms also suffer an exponential term, unless they rely on a strong and unreasonable assumption as describe in the related work.\nWe achieve an exponential speedup by (a) a specifically designed algorithm for the BGLM model, and (b) interleaving observation and intervention and making the algorithm fully adaptive. The idea of the analysis is as follows. First, for the mε,Δsubscript𝑚𝜀Δm_{\\varepsilon,\\Delta} hard actions, we rely on the adaptive LUCB to identify the best, and its sample complexity according to LUCB is\nO​(Hmε,Δ(L)​log⁡(|𝑨|​Hmε,Δ(L)/δ))𝑂subscript𝐻superscriptsubscript𝑚𝜀Δ𝐿𝑨subscript𝐻superscriptsubscript𝑚𝜀Δ𝐿𝛿O(H_{m_{\\varepsilon,\\Delta}^{(L)}}\\log(|\\boldsymbol{A}|H_{m_{\\varepsilon,\\Delta}^{(L)}}/\\delta)).\nNext, for easy actions, we rely on the observational data to provide accurate estimates.\nAccording to Eq.(6), every easy action a𝑎a has the property that qa⋅max{Δa,ε/2}2≥1/Hmε,Δq_{a}\\cdot\\max\\{\\Delta_{a},\\varepsilon/2\\}^{2}\\geq 1/H_{m_{\\varepsilon,\\Delta}}.\nUsing this property together with Lemma 2, we would show that the sample complexity for estimating easy action rewards is also\nO​(Hmε,Δ(L)​log⁡(|𝑨|​Hmε,Δ(L)/δ))𝑂subscript𝐻superscriptsubscript𝑚𝜀Δ𝐿𝑨subscript𝐻superscriptsubscript𝑚𝜀Δ𝐿𝛿O(H_{m_{\\varepsilon,\\Delta}^{(L)}}\\log(|\\boldsymbol{A}|H_{m_{\\varepsilon,\\Delta}^{(L)}}/\\delta)).\nFinally, the interleaving of observations and interventions keep the samply complexity in the same order.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: [ref]22 0, we have three assumptions: For any X∈𝐗∪{Y}𝑋𝐗𝑌X\\in\\boldsymbol{X}\\cup\\{Y\\}, fXsubscript𝑓𝑋f_{X} is twice differentiable.
