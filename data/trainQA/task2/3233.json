      "content": "Paper Title: Adversarial Deep Reinforcement Learning for Improving the Robustness of Multi-agent Autonomous Driving Policies\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAutonomous cars (ACs, also known as self-driving cars) are complex technologies that are prone to failures . ACs integrate deep learning based software, which is known to be difficult to validate [ref]2; yet, testing and validating ACs is indispensable for their deployment in practice  . While there has been progress made by researchers on testing AI-based models , testing of ACs is another complex area to tackle, due to several reasons. First, a lot of research has been proposed on scenario and test case generation 0123 and input validation 45678 for testing and validating AC driving models. While such approaches can expose failures in ACs, they are only focused on error detection and not correction. There is limited research work on analyzing the failed AC driving systems for understanding out-of-distribution scenes and edge cases that need to be induced in the training of AC models. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive AC testing methodology able to not only discover errors in AC driving models but also improve the performance of failing AC models given the same attacking inputs. This would help in overcoming existing errors and improving robustness in the evolving AI-based AC systems.\n Second, existing research efforts often address AC testing in simplistic evaluation scenarios. For example, AC testing is often considered as a single-agent problem, where only one car is taken as a system under test (SUT) 978. While a single-agent self-driving environment still has open challenges, there is a need to advance and test a multi-agent self-driving, as it represents a more realistic environment. In the near future, multiple ACs will co-exist on the road, and the more such cars start interacting with each other, as well as with human drivers, the more complex their testing becomes .\nAnother type of simplistic scenario is validating ACs in lane keeping 1 and mixed traffic systems  simulated environments. Existing industrial-grade AC testing uses vision-based end-to-end driving systems where ACs are tested on the high dimensional stream of inputs in a partially observable environment, unlike in lane-keeping simulated environments where such scenarios rely on low dimensional inputs and a fully observable environment for making driving decisions. Moreover, multi-agent driving environments consider cooperative and dependent driving agents, while the majority of AC research considers driving agents as independent and non-communicating competitive agents. Recent work  made progress toward testing connected and automated vehicles by injecting adversarial noise in a mixed-traffic-based network environment. However, this work is of limited practical use as it does not consider multiple non-communicating AC agents.\nAnother example of a simplistic evaluation scenario is testing of rule-based driving systems in a simulated environment [ref]24. Such driving systems are based on deterministic logic and do not scale to corner cases, unlike ACs based on deep learning systems.\nOne more type of simplistic evaluation scenario is offline testing of deep learning based AC models . Offline testing involves validating the performance and control decisions of a vision-based AC model by only using datasets of urban simulated driving scenarios, collected by humans. Even though offline testing contributes to the machine learning and autonomous driving (AD) community, it is very restricted to a single-agent setting (offline testing). Adding multi-agent actions induced by other driving policies in a non-stationary environment  is a very crucial and new area to tackle in the AC driving and testing community. Third, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms are extensively used in training vision-based safe AC models in urban driving environments 012. One way to test their driving behavior is using adversarial RL (ARL) since DRL is proven to be vulnerable multiple times against adversarial attacks. Existing research suggests that ARL-based agents can be effective in exposing vulnerabilities of DRL-based agents in a blackbox manner 3. However, the idea has been explored in a simplistic driving environment [ref]24. In our work, we make use of ARL for discovering effective attacking inputs that we further use to improve the robustness of DRL-based AC policies in a complex non-communicating vision-based urban driving environment. Specifically, we introduce ARL as part of a driving simulation in order to add adversarial actions against the AC policies under test. By doing so, we show not only find failure scenarios of the DRL-based ACs interacting with the adversarial drivers but to leverage effective adversarial actions to improve the AC driving robustness. To address these three challenges, in this paper we propose a framework ‘Multi-Agent Driving with Adversarial Reinforcement Learning MAD-ARL’ which is a novel approach for improving the robustness of non-communicating multi-agent ACs using an adversarial agent in an urban driving scenario. In the first step, we train an adversarial agent car that aims to create natural observations that are adversarial for the ACs under test. Using the trained adversary, we test multi-agent policies of ACs under test, with the goal of exposing faults in the cars’ driving policies as illustrated in Figure 1. In the second step,\nwe retrain the ACs under test with the adversarial policies to defend against adversarial attacks. The results are compared with the baseline autonomous models (adversary-free trained policies) to evaluate the effectiveness of the retraining strategy as a defense against adversarial attacks. In our experiments, we demonstrate that a trained adversarial player can improve the robustness of more than one vision-based AC policy in terms of fewer collisions and offroad steering accidents. The main idea is to use adversarial examples beyond testing purposes to improve the robustness of ACs, since adversarial attacks are usually not considered when AC models are being trained in urban driving scenarios. The key research contributions in this paper are: Proposing a two-step methodology for finding failure scenarios in ACs and improving the robustness of ACs given the effective test scenarios. Introducing a novel DRL framework for testing and improving driving policies of independent non-communicating agents in a multi-agent AC environment. The implementation of the framework is open 111 https://github.com/T3AS/MAD-ARL and reusable, which supports the reproducibility of research in the AD domain. Designing an RL-based adversarial agent that can be generalized for testing more than one AC driving policy by only training against a single victim AC. Designing an adversary that can effectively drive an AC into error states by creating natural (i.e. realistic) observations for the AC’s driving policies, without whitebox access to its input state. Experimentally demonstrating that retraining DRL-based AC driving policies using adversarial driving models can be an effective defense against adversarial attacks.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Autonomous cars (ACs, also known as self-driving cars) are complex technologies that are prone to failures .
