      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Improving Embedding Based Models of Social Network Alignment via Pseudo Anchors\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent studies on social network alignment can roughly be categorized as unsupervised and (semi-)supervised. Unsupervised social network alignment assumes absence of anchor labels and considers the task as a general graph alignment problem. Some representative methods include BIG-ALIGN  which performs the alignment based on Alternating Projected Gradient Descent, and UMA  which suggested the use of a two-step matrix factorization. Recently, embedding based algorithms have been widely adopted for the unsupervised alignment. They learn user representations from the user social relationships and/or the user profiles.\nCo-training  and iterative learning [ref]35 can be adopted for boosting alignment performance.\nBesides, REGAL [ref]36 was proposed with a similarity matrix factorization introduced for effective representation learning, which is also applicable to multiple networks. Factoid Embedding (FE)  models user relationships and profiles as a knowledge graph, and learns a unified embedding space for the alignment. CONE-Align  uses a multi-granularity strategy for the alignment via mapping of the graph structure and users. Instead of aligning the users one by one, Li et al.  consider all the users in a social network as a whole and perform user alignment from the user distribution level. They proposed UUILgan and UUILomt models based on earth mover’s distance. Experimental results show comparative performance with supervised baselines. Due to the high structural complexity and the fact that the presence of user profiles cannot be always assumed in different social networks, generalization of these unsupervised models are unstable. So far, the use of semi-/supervised methods for the alignment is still the mainstream. Semi-/supervised alignment methods assume that some anchor labels which refer to some aligned users are known to facilitate the alignment of the others. Traditional classification based methods   was first proposed to predict if two users in different networks should be aligned.\nEmbedding based methods were later on proposed with superior performance and efficiency.\nThey mainly follow two approaches: embedding sharing and embedding mapping.\n Embedding sharing methods learn a unified embedding space to achieve the alignment goal via sharing the embeddings of labeled anchors in different networks. For instance, IONE  learns the embedding space by preserving second-order follower-ship/followee-ship proximity with the embeddings of the anchors shared. Besides, structural diversity was further considered in its extension IONE-D .\nABNE  utilizes an attention mechanism to obtain more robust alignment. CrossMNA  leverages the cross-network information to refine “inter-vectors” and “intra-vectors” for aligning users across multiple networks. DALAUP 2 adopts active learning where the user embeddings are updated iteratively by active sampling and anchor user prediction. Motivated by the inherent connection between hyperbolic geometry and social networks 3, the studies 4 5 6 proposes to study a very interesting problem, i.e., user identity linkage based on hyperbolic geometry. For instance, the distance between nodes can be defined using the Lorentz model 5 and Poincaré ball model 6. Then, the random walk-based structural proximity objectives can be optimized for the alignment. Rather than learning a unified embedding space for users across networks, embedding mapping methods learn also a mapping between separated embeddings for the alignment. For instance, based on the spaces learned by preserving the first-order proximity in individual networks, PALE 7 employs MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) to conduct a supervised latent space matching. Deeplink  uses a deep neural network-based dual learning process to achieve a more powerful alignment model. SNNA 8 and MSUIL 9 learn the projection function which minimizes the Wasserstein distance between the anchors’ distributions of two social networks. dName 0 adopts a disentangled Graph Convolutional Network embedding algorithm to iteratively aggregate feature information from local graph neighborhood. MGCN 1, considering the simple network topology information insufficient, conducts convolution on both local network structure and hypergraph network structure, and then minimizes the distance between anchors to learn the embedding mapping. For studying the robustness of alignment model, the studies 2 3 attempt to reconcile multiple social networks by comprehensively exploiting attribute and structure information via an embedding approach. By observing that social network alignment and behavior analysis can benfit from each other, BANANA 4 takes the first attempt to study the joint problem of social network alignment and user behavior analysis. Different from the aforementioned works, our approach focuses on learning the user embedding space so that the users are more evenly distributed\nvia explicit introduction of pseudo anchors. This approach has the advantage that we need only slight changes to the original network structure and use meta-learning to guide the updating direction of implanted pseudo anchors. Since we do not need to modify the learning algorithms of the original model, the proposed framework can be applied on top of different embedding based alignment models to further boost their alignment performance.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: algorithms have been widely adopted for the unsupervised alignment.
