      "content": "Paper Title: GeoMIM: Towards Better 3D Knowledge Transfer via Masked Image Modeling for Multi-view 3D Understanding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoMIM, we conduct experiments by pretraining Swin Transformer [ref]35 backbones with GeoMIM and then finetuning it on various downstream tasks. These tasks include multi-view camera-based 3D detection on nuScenes  and Open Waymo  datasets, camera-based 3D semantic segmentation on nuScenes dataset, and 2D detection on nuImages dataset. Dataset and Evaluation Metrics We use the large-scale nuScenes dataset for pretraining and finetuning, which contains 750, 150, and 150 scenes for training, validation, and testing, respectively. Each scene has 6 camera images and LiDAR point cloud covering 360∘\\circ. Following the official evaluation metrics, we primarily report NuScenes Detection Score (NDS) and mean Average Precision (mAP) for comparison. We also report other five metrics, including ATE, ASE, AOE, AVE, and AAE, to measure translation, scale, orientation, velocity, and attribute errors, respectively, for a more detailed diagnosis. We also evaluate the transferability of GeoMIM by finetuning the pretrained backbone on the Open Waymo and nuImages datasets.\nWe report LET-3D-APL  and LET-3D-AP following the latest official guidelines for comparison.\nWe report Mean Average Precision (mAP) of box and mask on nuImages dataset for 2D object detection and instance segmentation. Pretraining We pretrain the Swin Transformer backbones on the training split of the nuScenes dataset with multi-view images as input. By default, we pretrain for 50 epochs with an input size of 256×704256704256\\times 704. For ablation studies, we pretrain for 6 epochs unless otherwise specified. We use a pretrained TransFusion-L  LiDAR model to provide the reconstruction targets. We randomly mask the multi-view input images with a mask ratio of 50%. We use AdamW [ref]36 optimizer with a learning rate of 2×10−42superscript1042\\times 10^{-4} and weight decay of 0.01. The learning rate is linearly warmed-up for 500 iterations and cosine decayed to 0. We apply the data augmentation strategy in BEVDet [ref]22 to augment the input images and do not use augmentations for the LiDAR inputs. We utilize the Swin-Base and -Large backbones for pretraining, initializing the backbone with self-supervised ImageNet-pretraining . Finetuning We keep the pretrained encoder, abandon the decoders, and adopt state-of-the-art frameworks for finetuning.\nWe mainly evaluate the performance of the finetuned models on the 3D detection task on the nuScenes dataset.\nWe also assess the transferability of GeoMIM on other downstream tasks. For the 3D detection on the nuScenes dataset, we utilize the BEVDepth  framework with an input size of 512×14085121408512\\times 1408 for comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches. For ablation studies, we use the BEVDet [ref]22 framework with an input size of 256×704256704256\\times 704.\nFor 3D detection on the Open Waymo dataset, the DfM   framework is utilized.\nFor 3D segmentation on the nuScenes dataset, we utilize the recent TPVFormer  for finetuning. We use Mask-RCNN  for object detection and instance segmentation on nuImages. We follow those frameworks’ default settings for finetuning, and include the detailed hyperparameters settings in the supplementary. We use AdamW [ref]36 optimizer with a learning rate of 2×10−42superscript1042\\times 10^{-4}, weight decay of 0.05. We use layer-wise learning rate decay schedule  and drop path regularization  for finetuning. We sweep the layer-wise decay rate from {0.8, 0.85}. The drop path rate is set to 0.2 for Swin-Base and 0.35 for Swin-Large.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: To demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoMIM, we conduct experiments by pretraining Swin Transformer [ref]35 backbones with GeoMIM and then finetuning it on various downstream tasks.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
