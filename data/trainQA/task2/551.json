      "content": "Paper Title: Fast General Distributed Transactions with Opacity using Global Time\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUsing one-sided RDMA reads during execution makes it challenging to\nprovide opacity with scalability.\nPessimistic concurrency control schemes such as Spanner \nprovide opacity by using read locks but this\nrequires two-way messaging and remote CPU usage on read-only\nparticipants. Timestamp ordering enables opacity by allowing transactions to read a\nconsistent snapshot defined by a read timestamp.\nThe challenge is to generate timestamps scalably and with global\nmonotonicity, i.e. the timestamp order must match the real time order\nin which the timestamps were generated across all servers. Centralized sequencers do not scale to our target transaction rates.\nA state of the art centralized sequencer without fault\ntolerance  can generate 122 million timestamps per\nsecond. FaRMv1 can execute 140 million TATP transactions per\nsecond on 90 machines . NAM-DB  uses a centralized timestamp server and caches\ntimestamps at servers to avoid generating new timestamps per\ntransaction. This improves scalability but it means that timestamps\nare not globally monotonic: timestamps generated on different servers\nwill not be in real time order. Using non-monotonic timestamps as\ntransaction read and write timestamps violates strictness. Clock-SI  has no centralized time server but uses\nloosely synchronized physical clocks on each server. Remote reads in\nClock-SI block until the remote server’s clock moves past the\ntransaction read timestamp. This operation is not supported on RDMA\nNICs and requires two-sided messaging. Clock-SI is also not globally\nmonotonic. Spanner  uses Marzullo’s algorithm \nto maintain globally synchronized real time. Servers synchronize their\nlocal clocks with a time master periodically. The algorithm accounts\nfor synchronization uncertainty explicitly by representing time as an\ninterval, which is computed using the round trip time of\nsynchronization requests, the master time returned by requests, and an\nassumed bound on the rate drift of the local clock. Time masters use\natomic clocks and/or GPS that are synchronized with global real time,\nand there are multiple clock masters for fault tolerance. Servers\nsynchronize with clock masters every 30 seconds. Spanner’s\nuncertainties are 1–7 ms, which is acceptable in a\ngeo-distributed database where latencies are dominated by WAN round\ntrips. These uncertainties are too high for FaRM, which is designed for\nsub-millisecond transaction latencies using low latency RDMA networks\nto scale out within a data center. We also did not want to depend on\natomic clocks and GPS as they are not widely available in all data\ncenters. We also use timestamp ordering based on real time, with clock\nsynchronization using Marzullo’s algorithm  but\nwith a design and implementation that provide an average uncertainty\nbelow 20 microseconds, two orders of magnitude lower than in Spanner.\nWe use only the cycle counters present on all CPUs, allowing any\nserver in a cluster to function as a clock master (CM) without\nadditional hardware. Non-clock masters periodically synchronize their clocks with the\ncurrent clock master using low-latency, CPU-efficient RPCs based on\nRDMA writes . Round-trip times are in the tens of\nmicroseconds even under load and a single clock master can handle\nhundreds of thousands of synchronization requests per second while\nalso running the application without noticeable impact on\napplication throughput. Marzullo’s algorithm assumes an asynchronous network. When a non CM\nfetches the time from a CM over such a network, it can only assume\nthat the one-way latencies of the request and response messages are\nnon-negative. The true time at the CM (as computed at the non-CM) thus\nlies in an interval defined by the two extreme possibilities shown in\nFigure 1. The time elapsed between sending the\nrequest and receiving the response is measured on the local clock of\nthe non CM. Marzullo’s algorithm assumes that clock rates can differ\nacross machines but that the maximum relative difference, or drift, is bounded by some known value ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilon. The upper bound\non the time must therefore be adjusted as shown in the figure. Once time has been successfully synchronized, this information can be\nused to compute a time interval using only the local clock, without\nnetwork synchronization. However, both upper and lower bounds must be\nextended to account for potential drift; this additional uncertainty\ngrows linearly with the time elapsed since\nsynchronization. Figure 1 shows how a non CM\ncomputes bounds on the time at the CM (TC​M′superscriptsubscript𝑇𝐶𝑀′T_{CM}^{\\prime})\nimmediately after a synchronziation as well as after some time\nhas elapsed since a synchronization (TC​M′′superscriptsubscript𝑇𝐶𝑀′′T_{CM}^{\\prime\\prime}). For simplicity, the figure only shows an uncertainty interval computed\nfrom the most recent synchronization. However, this is not necessary\n— any past synchronization in the current configuration can be used\nto compute the current time interval. Moreover, the best\nsynchronization to use (for the tightest bounds) is not always the\nmost recent, and is not always the same for the upper bound and lower\nbound. We used an optimized variant of the algorithm that computes the\noptimal (tightest upper and lower bounds) time interval based on all\navailable information from past synchronizations. The algorithm is\nimplemented efficiently by maintaining the state from up to two past\nsynchronizations: one that gives the highest lower bound (Sl​o​w​e​rsubscript𝑆𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟S_{lower}) and one that\ngives the lowest upper bound (Su​p​p​e​rsubscript𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑟S_{upper}). Figure 2 shows this\noptimized algorithm. Synchronization state is kept in a shared memory data structure on\neach machine. Any thread can read this state to compute a time\ninterval using the function TIME. We also allow any thread to synchronize with the clock\nmaster and update the state. For threads that also run application\ncode, these requests are interleaved non-preemptively with execution\nof application code. This leads to scheduling delays in processing\nsynchronization requests and responses causing high uncertainty. Hence\nin practice, we only send synchronization requests from a single,\nhigh-priority thread that does not run application code. FaRMv1\nalready uses such a high-priority thread to manage leases for failure\ndetection, and we use the same thread to send synchronization requests\nin FaRMv2. We assume that cycle counters are synchronized across threads on a\nserver to some known precision. On our platform, the OS\n(Windows) synchronizes the cycle counters\nacross threads to within 1024 ticks (about 400 ns). This\nuncertainty is included in the interval returned to the\ncaller. Time intervals in FaRMv2 are globally monotonic: if an event at\ntime [L1,U1]subscript𝐿1subscript𝑈1\\left[L_{1},U_{1}\\right] anywhere in the cluster happens-before an\nevent at time [L2,U2]subscript𝐿2subscript𝑈2\\left[L_{2},U_{2}\\right] anywhere in the cluster, then\nU2>L1subscript𝑈2subscript𝐿1U_{2}>L_{1}. We also guarantee that on any thread, the left bound L𝐿L\nis non-decreasing. Frequent synchronization allows us to use conservative clock drift\nbounds. Currently we use a bound of 1000 parts per million (ppm),\ni.e. 0.1%. This is at least 10x higher than the maximum allowed by\nthe hardware specification on our servers and at least 10x higher than\nthe maximum observed rate drift across 6.5 million server hours on our\nproduction clusters with more than 700 machines. Correctness in FaRMv2 requires clock frequencies to stay within\nthese bounds. We use the local CPU clock on each machine, which on\nmodern hardware is based on extremely accurate and reliable crystal\noscillators. In rare cases, these can be faulty at manufacture: we\ndetect these cases using an initial probation period when a server is\nadded to the cluster, during which we monitor clock rates but do not\nuse the server. Clock rates can also change slowly over time due to\naging effects and temperature variation (e.g., [ref]17).\nFaRMv2 continuously monitors\nthe clock rate of each non-CM relative to the CM. If this exceeds\n200 ppm (5x more conservative than the bound we require for correctness),\nit is reported to a centralized service that removes\neither the non-CM or the CM, if the CM is reported by multiple servers.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: a server is\nadded to the cluster, during which we monitor clock rates but do not\nuse the server.
