Thermal. Recent research has shown that the package design cannot guarantee full functionality without considering the chiplets’ thermal characteristics    .\nDark silicon describes a phenomenon that in a many-core system, not all cores can be active at the same time due to certain thermal constraints.\nThis problem is alleviated in the chiplet-based system. However, we still have to address the thermal issues since chiplets are placed close to each other to minimize the wire length and package size.\nThe thermal issues can be addressed using both online management and offline design optimization.\nIn run-time management, the computational-intensive tasks can be scheduled to non-adjacent chiplets.\nBesides, the thermal issue can be addressed using dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) or run-time scheduling after the chiplet systems are manufactured , but these methods sacrifice performance.\nIn offline design optimization, thermal-aware chiplet placement approaches avoid hot spots by increasing distance or inserting low-power chiplets between high-power chiplets  .\n  shows it can achieve 20\n% peak temperature decrease without sacrificing performance or using expensive cooling technology. Package and chiplet co-design.\nThe achievable system performance is determined by both the package design and the chiplet design.\n   propose a holistic package design flow that takes chiplets’ netlist into consideration.\nHowever, this analysis would be hard to perform in the chiplet marketplace since the vendors may be reluctant to share their intellectual properties.\nTherefore, the vendors and customers need to find standard models to describe the electrical properties of chiplets and enable fast simulation without revealing any detailed circuit designs as discussed in standards [ref]42.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: Testing.\nThe chiplet should not be a black box to the system designer.\nThe marketplace also needs standards to describe the chiplets in terms of testing, thermal, I/O, etc [ref]42.\nChiplets potentially enable a marketplace where product developers can buy modules for multiple vendors and assemble them at a much lower cost than designing a chip from scratch.\nHowever,\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
