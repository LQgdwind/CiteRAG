      "content": "Paper Title: Align All the Nodes: Scalable Learning of Flexible Latent Structure for Graph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRelational structure inter-connecting instance nodes as a graph is ubiquitous from social domains (e.g., citation networks) to natural science (protein-protein interaction), where graph neural networks (GNNs)¬†[32; 19; 14; 36] have shown promising power for leveraging such data dependence as geometric priors.\nHowever, there arises increasing evidence challenging the core GNN hypothesis that propagating information along observed graph structures will necessarily produce better node-level representations for prediction on each individual instance node. Conflicts with this premise lead to commonly identified deficiencies with GNN message-passing rules w.r.t.¬†heterophily¬†, over-squashing¬†, long-range dependencies¬†[ref]8, and graph incompleteness¬†, etc. Moreover, in graph-enhanced applications, e.g., text classification¬†, vision navigation¬†[ref]12, physics simulation¬†[ref]30, etc., graph structures are often unavailable though individual instances are strongly inter-correlated. A common practice is to artificially construct a graph via some predefined rules (e.g., kùëòk-NN), which is agnostic to downstream tasks and may presumably cause the misspecification of GNNs‚Äô inductive bias on input geometry (induced by the local feature propagation design). Natural solutions resort to organically combining learning optimal graph topology with message passing. However, one critical difficulty is the scalability issue with O‚Äã(N2)ùëÇsuperscriptùëÅ2O(N^{2}) (where NùëÅN denotes #nodes) computational complexity, which is prohibitive for large networks (with 10‚ÄãK‚àº1‚ÄãMsimilar-to10ùêæ1ùëÄ10K\\sim 1M nodes). Some existing approaches harness neighbor sampling¬†, anchor-based adjacency surrogates¬† and hashing schemes¬†3 to reduce the overhead; however, these strategies may sacrifice model precision and still struggle to handle graphs with million-level nodes. Another obstacle lies in the increased degrees of freedom due to at least an N√óNùëÅùëÅN\\times N all-pair similarity matrix, which may result in large combinatorial search space and vulnerability to over-fitting. In this work, we introduce a novel all-pair message passing scheme that can scale to large systems without compromising performance. We develop a kernelized Gumbel-Softmax operator that seamlessly synthesizes random feature map¬†7 and approximated sampling strategy¬†, for distilling latent structures among all the instance nodes and yielding moderate gradients through differentiable optimization. Though such a combination of two operations involving randomness could potentially result in mutual distortion, we theoretically prove that the new operator can still guarantee a well-posed approximation for concrete variables (discrete structures) with the error bounded by feature dimensions. Furthermore, such a design can reduce the algorithmic complexity of learning new topology per layer to O‚Äã(N)ùëÇùëÅO(N) by avoiding explicit computation for the cumbersome all-pair similarity. The proposed module opens the door to a new class of graph networks, i.e., NodeFormer (Scalable Transformers for Node Classification), that is capable of efficiently propagating messages between arbitrary node pairs in flexible layer-specific latent graphs. And to accommodate input graphs (if any), we devise two simple techniques: a relational bias and an edge-level regularization loss, as guidance for properly learning adaptive structures.\nWe evaluate our approach on diverse node classification tasks ranging from citation networks to images/texts. The results show its promising power for tackling heterophily, long-range dependencies, large-scale graphs, graph incompleteness and the absence of input graphs. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n ‚àô‚àô\\bullet‚ÄÑ  We develop a kernelized Gumbel-Softmax operator which is proven to serve as a well-posed approximation for concrete variables, particularly the discrete latent structure among data points. The new module can reduce the algorithmic complexity for learning new message-passing topology from quadratic to linear w.r.t. node numbers, without sacrificing the precision. This serves as a pioneering model that successfully scales graph structure learning to large graphs with million-level nodes. ‚àô‚àô\\bullet‚ÄÑ  We further propose NodeFormer, a new class of graph networks with layer-wise message passing as operated over latent graphs potentially connecting all nodes. The latter are optimized in an end-to-end differentiable fashion through a new objective that essentially pursues sampling optimal topology from a posterior conditioned on node features and labels. To our knowledge, NodeFormer is the first Transformer model that scales all-pair message passing to large node classification graphs. ‚àô‚àô\\bullet‚ÄÑ  We demonstrate the model‚Äôs efficacy by extensive experiments over a diverse set of datasets, including node classification benchmarks and image/text classification, where significant improvement over strong GNN models and SOTA structure learning methods is shown. Besides, it successfully scales to large graph datasets with up to 2M nodes where prior arts failed, and reduces the time/space consumption of the competitors by up to 93.1%/80.6% on moderate sized datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: on each individual instance node.
