      "content": "Paper Title: A Generative Model For Raw Audio Using Transformer Architectures\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this work, we use real-world piano recordings from Youtube. The choice of the piano was made as it contains a mixture of both monophonic and polyphonic (playing more than one note at a time) thus yielding complex audio waveforms. The piano also provides a wide range of pitches. However, it does have a relatively constrained timbre space as opposed to more choices we could have made, such as symphonic performances. The flexibility of conditioning the generation on a latent code makes it adaptable to further datasets. We collected about 840 piano tracks of covers of popular songs amounting to about 56 hours of data. The reason for selecting real-world recordings over a standard dataset [ref]42 [ref]43 was to account for differences in room acoustics, playing styles, timbral differences, loudness, and microphones to name a few. The tracks included artists ranging from Pink Floyd and Billie-Eilish to some works from Rahman and Coke-Studio among many others. Forty randomly chosen tracks were set aside as a test set for which all the results in the paper are reported. The URLs are shared here at https://tinyurl.com/6cjxffa8 For training, we worked with a 16KHz sampling rate and 8-bit resolution. All the tracks were read and converted to the chosen resolution using  [ref]45. Any tracks having lower original sampling rates were discarded. The context duration was 100ms, a choice required by computation cost and memory constraints for the resources available, and because of the quadratic scaling of transformers. The same setup and context were used for the wavenet comparisons, too. Since this is a form of self-supervised learning where the data itself is used, the input vocabulary consisted of the raw waveform representation, values ranging from 0-255. The output target was the same waveform but shifted by one so that at each time step we predict the next sample. This is similar to a recent language modeling project . All of the models discussed in the current paper are causal attention dilation-based. Given that we used such a large dataset, we expect the results and improvement of Transformer over wavenet to hold on to a standard dataset. 111We have shared our code for models, the youtube-URLs, and the training and testing tracks here https://tinyurl.com/6cjxffa8\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: to further datasets.
