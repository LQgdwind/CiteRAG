      "content": "Paper Title: FE^\"ANN\" – An efficient data-driven multiscale approach based on physics-constrained neural networks and automated data mining\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA relatively new strategy to substitute classical constitutive equations is the data-driven mechanics approach, initially proposed by Kirchdoerfer and Ortiz  and extended to, e. g., noisy data sets , finite strains , inelasticity  or fracture mechanics  in the meantime. This method completely avoids to use constitutive equations. Instead, sets of stress-strain tuples which characterize the material’s behavior are used. A data-driven solver hence seeks to minimize the distance between the searched solution and the material data set within a proper energy norm, while compatibility and equilibrium have to be satisfied simultaneously. The construction of so called constitutive manifolds from collected data is an alternative approach which is described for elasticity and inelasticity by Ibañez et al. . With this technique, it is possible to strictly fulfill the 2nd law of thermodynamics, i. e., the thermodynamic consistency, by using the GENERIC paradigm (General Equation for Non-Equilibrium Reversible-Irreversible Coupling) during the construction of constitutive manifolds . Besides the previously mentioned techniques, there exist numerous data-based methods originating from the field of machine learning (ML). Probably, the most common technique is the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs), which have already been proposed in the early 90s by the pioneering work of Ghabussi et al. .\nIn the last decades, ANNs have been intensively used for mechanical material modeling and simulations by means of the finite element method (FEM), e. g., in     [ref]29 among others. However, in general, a large amount of data is required to train ANNs to serve as robust and accurate surrogate models for systems with complex underlying physics, e. g., constitutive models. In this context, a comparatively new branch of ML techniques related to constitutive modeling are approaches classified as physics-informed, physics-constrained  , mechanics-informed  or hybrid models [ref]33 [ref]34.111In the following, the term physics-informed does not directly refer to the PINN-approach (physics-informed neural network) according to Raissi et al. .\nIn a PINN, the searched solution field approximated by the ANN, e. g., displacement 𝒖​(𝒙,t)𝒖𝒙𝑡\\boldsymbol{u}(\\boldsymbol{x},t), is inserted into the governing partial differential equation (PDE) at collocation points. This expression is then added to the loss, so that the fulfillment of the PDE is enforced. In the context of constitutive modeling, however, the idea to enrich the ML approach with physical knowledge is applied in a similar way.\nIn these methods, essential physical principles and information are inserted into the ML-based model or parts of classical models are replaced with data-based methods, which leads to an improvement of the extrapolation capability and enables training with sparse data.\nIn the case of ANNs, this can be achieved via the network architecture or by adapted training algorithms. By choosing problem-specific invariant sets as the input variables, material symmetries are automatically satisfied for hyperelastic models  [ref]29 . Furthermore, the thermodynamic consistency can be fulfilled by choosing the free energy as the output quantity. In order to train the ANN with respect to the stresses, gradients of the output with respect to the input are inserted into the loss  . This technique is also named as Sobolev training in .\nFurthermore, physical knowledge can be inserted via constraint training processes .\nFor the consideration of dissipative behavior, Masi et al.  proposed an adapted ANN architecture consisting of two feed forward neural networks (FNNs).\nThereby, the first network is used to predict the evolution of internal variables and the second for approximating the free energy.\nFinally, the combination of classical models with data-based techniques is a further method to insert physical knowledge. Thereby, only parts of a model are replaced by data-based techniques, e. g., in plasticity models [ref]33 [ref]34 .\n\nReference markers found: [29]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]29: pioneering work of Ghabussi et al. .\nIn the last decades, ANNs have been intensively used for mechanical material modeling and simulations by means of the finite element method (FEM), e. g., in     [ref]29 among others.
