      "content": "Paper Title: Refining Low-Resource Unsupervised Translation by Language Disentanglement of Multilingual Model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nRecent advances in fully unsupervised machine translation (UMT) are often built on the foundation of iterative back-translation    . It is a clever technique where the model back-translates monolingual data from one language to another, and the resulting pair is used to train the model itself via standard back-propagation. To make UMT successfully work, iterative back-translation must be accompanied with some forms of cross- or multi-lingual initialization of the model, either through an unsupervised bilingual dictionary  , phrase-based statistical MT , or language model pre-training  0 [ref]21. Apart from that, cross-model back-translated distillation , where two distinct models are used to complement the target model, can also boost UMT performance. Plus, pseudo-parallel data mining, where sentences from two monolingual corpora are paired to form training samples through certain language-agnostic representations 3 1 [ref]23, has been shown to significantly improve UMT performance. Nonetheless, when it comes to fully unsupervised translation of distant and low-resource languages , the aforementioned techniques fail to translate their success in high-resource languages to low-resource counterparts, unless “multilinguality” is involved. mBART [ref]21 is among the first multilingual model to boost the performance greatly in low-resource UMT, by pre-training the model on the CC25 dataset, which is a 1.4-terabyte collection of monolingual data from 25 languages. The CC25 dataset contains not only data from English and the low-resource languages of interest, like Nepali, but also data from their related but higher-resource siblings, like Hindi. CRISS 1 later advances the state of the art in low-resource UMT by finetuning mBART with pseudo-parallel data of more than 180 directions mined from the model’s encoder representations. This type of UMT models handles translations in multiple directions by a few principles that are designed to maximize parameter sharing. First, it builds a large shared vocabulary that covers wordpieces from all languages. Second, the encoder encodes input sentences without knowledge about their corresponding languages to promote language-agnostic representations in its outputs. Lastly, the decoder receives the encoder outputs and decodes the translation in the target language by prepending a language-specific token at the beginning of the output sequence. Training the model in such a multilingual environment helps the encoder learn language-agnostic latent representations that are shared across multiple languages, allowing the decoder to translate from any language. The vast availability of high-resource siblings (e.g., Hindi for Indic languages) may help improve the performance of low-resource MT significantly  . Meanwhile, LAgSwAV [ref]23 improve unsupervised MT by mining pseudo-parallel data from monolingual data with cluster assignments. Despite its outstanding success, multilinguality may conversely hinder the model’s further improvement in low-resource unsupervised translation due to the curse of multilinguality  0. A multilingual model with a fixed capacity may perform suboptimally on individual languages as it is forced to simultaneously handle conflicting structural reorderings of distant languages . The single-token language specifier is also not enough to ensure the language consistency of its predictions . Our proposed method aims to gradually separate the languages and focus on the target low-resource directions only. One prominent feature of our method is that it prioritises to separate English from the remaining low-resource languages first, as these languages are often much more distant from the common language English than from themselves 2. There are several efforts with similar objectives as ours, albeit of different contexts and scenarios. Specifically, Sen et al.  propose a shared encoder and language-specific decoder model to be trained with back-translation for unsupervised MT, which is slightly similar to stage 1 of our proposed four-stage refinement process, as explained in section 3. Our stages 2, 3 and 4 improve the first stage, or equivalently Sen et al. , further by refining the model in ways that are not possible in stage 1. Meanwhile, Sachan and Neubig , Zhang et al. 4, Li and Gong  propose methods to cause the model to implicitly “select” relevant language-specific parameters by gating mechanisms or gradient readjustments, in the context of supervised multilingual translation. However, these methods, as found in section 4, struggle with unsupervised MT as signals from back-translated synthetic training samples are often much noisier. On the implementation side, the design of our language-specific FFN layers (section 3.1) is also largely inspired by sparsely-distributed mixture of experts  8 5. Low-resource MT can also benefit greatly from the presence of supervised parallel data, or auxiliary data, in a related language (e.g., English-Hindi for English-Nepali), which is not a fully unsupervised setup but a zero-shot scenario. Garcia et al. 1  propose multi-stage training procedures that combine both monolingual data and auxiliary parallel data to improve the performance of low-resource translation. Meanwhile, Chen et al.   suggest to scale their experiments up to 100 languages to attain better performance boosts. Nonetheless, while such line of work offers considerable insight into low-resource MT, it is not within the scope of this paper, as we focus on fully unsupervised machine translation where absolutely no parallel data is available, regardless of languages.\n\nReference markers found: [21]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]21: with some forms of cross- or multi-lingual initialization of the model, either through an unsupervised bilingual dictionary  , phrase-based statistical MT , or language model pre-training  0 [ref]21.
