      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Acoustic Unit Discovery by Leveraging a Language-Independent Subword Discriminative Feature Representation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe APC model included in the first stage of the proposed model is taken from our previous study [ref]23:\nit has 555 LSTM layers of dimension 100100100 with residual connections. The prediction step is 555. The model was trained with the Libri-light (English) unlab-600 (hour) set .\nAPC features are extracted from the top layer of the APC model. We developed 222 multilingual systems and 555 monolingual systems, differing only in the training languages: Multi-5 denotes the multilingual system trained with the 5 GlobalPhone languages; Multi-13 denotes the multilingual system trained with all 13 GlobalPhone+Babel languages; Mono-CZ, Mono-FR, Mono-SP, Mono-MA, Mono-TH are five monolingual systems, each trained with one GlobalPhone language, i.e., Czech, French, Spanish, Mandarin, and Thai, respectively.\nWe do not report any monolingual system trained on each of the Babel languages because of its inferior AUD performance – possibly explained by the large recording condition mismatch between the Babel languages and Mboshi.\nIPA symbols are used to represent the basic acoustic units, and the mapping from orthographic transcriptions to IPA symbol sequences is obtained by LanguageNet G2P models . The multilingual and monolingual OOD ASR systems are trained using Kaldi , adopting a hybrid architecture , following implementation in . The AM adopts a factorized time-delay neural network (TDNNF) consisting of 121212 layers with a hidden dimension of 102410241024\nand Resnet-style skip connections, trained with the LF-MMI criterion  for 444 epochs, with a starting learning rate (LR) of 10−3superscript10310^{-3}. The input features consist of 434343-dimension high-resolution MFCC+pitch features and 100100100-dimension i-vectors. The language model (LM) is a uni-gram phonotactic LM instead of an RNNLM, as we intend the OOD ASR phone labeling process to be minimally affected by the OOD language phonotactics. The LM is trained with the training data transcripts using SRILM . The DNN AM for Mboshi is trained using either APC features or MFCC features of the Mboshi data.\nFor each of the 777 multi/monolingual OOD ASR systems, the generated and post-processed (see Section 2.1) OOD phone labels are used to train one DNN AM with MFCC as input features, resulting in 777 DNN AMs.\nFor the sake of simplicity, to test the effectiveness of the APC features, only for the system employing Multi-13 (the best-performing OOD ASR), an additional DNN AM is trained with APC features instead of MFCCs.\nThe Mboshi DNN AM adopts a TDNNF structure similar to that of the OOD ASR AM, except: a 404040-dimension bottleneck layer is placed below the top TDNNF layer; i-vector input is not included as we found it deteriorated the performance in our preliminary results (not included in this paper);\nthe model is trained for 202020 epochs with a smaller LR of 2.5⋅10−4⋅2.5superscript1042.5\\cdot 10^{-4} to stabilize the training procedure due to only 4.54.54.5 hours of training material111Speed perturbation based data augmentation techniques were tried but no improvement was found, thus are not applied.. After training the DNN AM, the BNF for the Mboshi representations are extracted from the bottleneck layer as the learned frame-level subword-discriminative representation, and are used as input to the\nsecond stage of the proposed system.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: The APC model included in the first stage of the proposed model is taken from our previous study [ref]23:\nit has 555 LSTM layers of dimension 100100100 with residual connections.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
