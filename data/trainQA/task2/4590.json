      "content": "Paper Title: ProtoPFormer: Concentrating on Prototypical Parts in Vision Transformers for Interpretable Image Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nHere, we list the involved hyperparameters of baseline methods. We use grid search to find the optimum values (like learning rates and their exclusive parameters) of compared baselines when applying them with ViT backbones. Base As the non-interpretable counterpart of ProtoPFormer, we use the official implementation of three ViT backbones, i.e., DeiT-Ti , DeiT-S , and CaiT-XXS-24 [ref]43. After warming up (5 warm-up epochs with a learning rate 1​e−41superscript𝑒41e^{-4}), 5​e−55superscript𝑒55e^{-5}, 1​e−41superscript𝑒41e^{-4} and 4​e−44superscript𝑒44e^{-4} are learning rates of backbones on CUB, Dogs and Cars, respectively. ProtoPNet  We use ten prototypes for each class on the adopted three datasets. In our implemented ProtoPNet, the add-on layer only consists of one convolutional layer, and the last layer of the model is frozen for better results. Some operations in the original ProtoPNet are also removed for performance improvement with ViT backbones, including the cluster and separation losses and the “push” process. After warming up (5 warm-up epochs with a learning rate 1​e−41superscript𝑒41e^{-4}), the learning rates of the add-on layer and the prototypes are set to 3​e−33superscript𝑒33e^{-3}. And 2​e−42superscript𝑒42e^{-4}, 5​e−55superscript𝑒55e^{-5} and 2​e−42superscript𝑒42e^{-4} are learning rates of backbones for CUB, Dogs and Cars, respectively. ProtoTree  For the soft decision tree, we use a single tree with a depth of 12 with 4095 total prototypes for classification (depth 9 is used in the original ProtoTree). After warming up (5 warm-up epochs with a learning rate 1​e−41superscript𝑒41e^{-4}), the learning rates of the add-on layer and the prototypes are turned to 3​e−33superscript𝑒33e^{-3}. And 1​e−41superscript𝑒41e^{-4}, 5​e−55superscript𝑒55e^{-5} and 4​e−44superscript𝑒44e^{-4} are learning rates of ViT backbones for CUB, Dogs and Cars, respectively. TesNet  Each class contains ten prototypes on three datasets. After warming up (5 warm-up epochs with a learning rate 1​e−41superscript𝑒41e^{-4}), the learning rates of the add-on layer, the prototypes, and the last layer are turned to 3​e−33superscript𝑒33e^{-3}, 3​e−33superscript𝑒33e^{-3} and 1​e−41superscript𝑒41e^{-4}, respectively. And 1​e−41superscript𝑒41e^{-4}, 1​e−41superscript𝑒41e^{-4} and 2​e−42superscript𝑒42e^{-4} are learning rates of backbones for CUB, Dogs and Cars, respectively. The cluster and separation loss, and the “push” process are also removed in this work for better performance. Def.ProtoPNet [ref]14 We use ten deformable prototypes with the shape of 2×2222\\times 2 for each class on the adopted three datasets (2×2222\\times 2 is the same as the defaulting setting in the released codes). The add-on layer of the original Def. ProtoPNet is an upsampling layer to increase the feature map size of CNN models. We replace the upsampling layer with a 1×1111\\times 1 convolution layer and an activation layer, which improves the accuracy in our experiments. After warming up (5 warm-up epochs with a learning rate 1​e−41superscript𝑒41e^{-4}), the learning rates of the add-on layer, the prototypes, and the last layer are set to 3​e−33superscript𝑒33e^{-3}, 3​e−33superscript𝑒33e^{-3} and 1​e−41superscript𝑒41e^{-4}, respectively. And 5​e−55superscript𝑒55e^{-5}, 2​e−42superscript𝑒42e^{-4} and 4​e−44superscript𝑒44e^{-4} are learning rates of backbones for CUB, Dogs and Cars, respectively. CT [ref]34 We only conduct experiments with CT on the CUB dataset. 13 concepts, 95 spatial concepts, and 0 unsupervised concepts are adopted in this method. The learning rate of the whole model is 1​e−41superscript𝑒41e^{-4}. ViT-Net  We use a single tree with a depth of 4 with 15 prototypes in ViT-Net. After warming up (5 warm-up epochs with a learning rate 1​e−41superscript𝑒41e^{-4}), the learning rates of the whole model is turned to 1​e−41superscript𝑒41e^{-4}, 5​e−55superscript𝑒55e^{-5} and 2​e−42superscript𝑒42e^{-4} on CUB, Dogs, and Cars, respectively. Especially, CT and ViT-Net are designed based on ViTs. CT uses ViT-L in the original paper, and ViT-Net unitizes the pre-trained weights on ImageNet-22K  rather than ImageNet-1k used in our settings. We turn their hyperparameters for fairness and find suitable configurations under our experimental settings.\nIt is worth noticing that we modify some modules in some baselines. For example, the add-on layer of ProtoPNet is changed to one convolutional layer in our implementation. These changes are implemented in order to pursue better accuracies and visualization results for compared baselines with ViT backbones.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: when applying them with ViT backbones.
