In this paper, we focus on Holant problems defined on the Boolean domain. Holant problems are parameterized by a set of constraint functions, also called signatures.

Weighted #CSP is a special class of Holant problems.\nSo are all weighted #GH.\nOther problems expressible as Holant problems include counting matchings and perfect matchings , counting Eulerian orientations [ref]14, computing the partition functions of six-vertex models  and eight-vertex models [ref]12.\nIt is proved that counting perfect matchings cannot be expressed by #GH  .\nThus, Holant problems are provably more expressive.\n Progress has been made in the complexity classification of Holant problems.\nWhen all signatures are restricted to be symmetric, a full dichotomy is proved .\nWhen asymmetric signatures are allowed, some dichotomies are proved for special families of Holant problems\nby assuming that certain auxiliary signatures are available, e.g., Holant∗superscriptHolant∗\\operatorname{Holant}^{\\ast}, Holant+superscriptHolant\\operatorname{Holant}^{+} and HolantcsuperscriptHolant𝑐\\operatorname{Holant}^{c}   1 .\nWithout assuming auxiliary signatures a Holant dichotomy is established only for non-negative real valued signatures 7.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: other frameworks such as counting constraint satisfaction problems (#CSP) and counting graph homomorphisms (#GH).\nBoth have been well studied\nand full complexity dichotomies have been established\n   [ref]11     .\nOn the other hand, the understanding of Holant problems, even restricted to\nthe Boolean domain, is still limited.
