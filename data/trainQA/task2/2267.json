      "content": "Paper Title: Effective Evaluation of Deep Active Learning on Image Classification Tasks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we report experiments and results to study the previously listed facets of effective evaluation (Sec. 2) using DISTIL as discussed earlier in this paper. Furthermore, we use a common set of experimental parameters unless otherwise specified, which are detailed in Appendix A. Our data augmentations consist of random horizontal flips and random croppings (p=0.5ùëù0.5p=0.5) of the images padded by 4 pixels on each side, followed by data normalization. These augmentations occur every time a data instance is retrieved during training. To encourage reproduction of our results, we provide simple instructions to execute our experiments and list the compute resources needed to run these experiments in Appendix A. We evaluate our algorithms on the following five image classification data sets: CIFAR-10¬†, CIFAR-100¬†, MNIST¬†[ref]19, Fashion MNIST¬†, and SVHN¬†. For each experiment, we initialize each AL strategy with an identical initial model and initial labeled seed set. Each model is trained until either the training accuracy reaches 99%, the epoch count reaches 300, or the training accuracy does not improve after 10 epochs. On all data sets except MNIST¬†[ref]19, a ResNet-18¬† and a VGG-11¬† are used. On MNIST¬†[ref]19, we use a model similar to a LeNet¬†[ref]19 (see Appendix A). Lastly, we run each experiment three times and report the average across all runs and the associated variance. We allude to significance test results here and provide details of the same in Appendix G. 4.1 Baseline Experiments & Labeling Efficiency. To have an accurate comparison of AL selection algorithms, we first conducted a baseline experiment across multiple data sets to gauge the effectiveness of each algorithm in a general scenario. As highlighted in Sec. 3, we restrict our comparison to random sampling, entropy sampling, margin sampling, least confidence sampling, Badge, GLISTER-ACTIVE, CoreSet, and FASS. Other algorithms are compared in Appendix B. In Figure¬†1 (upper plots), we plot the obtained test accuracy as a function of the size of the labeled set. In addition, in the lower plots, the labeling efficiency of each selection algorithm with respect to random sampling is displayed. Specifically, the labeling efficiency for a given test accuracy is computed as the ratio of the minimum number of labeled training instances needed for an AL algorithm to reach that accuracy to the minimum number of labeled training instances needed by random sampling to reach that accuracy. The results in Figure¬†1 are obtained using a ResNet-18 model on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and Fashion-MNIST. The results for VGG-11‚Äôs performance and the results for the MNIST data set are in Appendix B. In each baseline, we observe that the top-performing strategies exhibit labeling efficiencies that range from 1.3√ó1.3\\times (CIFAR-100) to 3√ó3\\times (SVHN and FMNIST), indicating that the commonly used AL selection algorithms achieve their intended purpose of reducing labeling costs. For MNIST (Appendix B), we observe a labeling efficiency of 4.5√ó4.5\\times. This addresses P1 (unified experimental setting) and P2 (labeling efficiency). 4.2 Data Augmentation. To better understand the effect of data augmentation on image data sets in an AL setting, we compare AL on CIFAR-10¬† with and without the use of data augmentation. We do this for Badge and entropy sampling, which are the best-performing strategies in Figure¬†1 and are also representative techniques among uncertainty and diversity-based approaches. The results are shown in Figure¬†2. First, the use of augmentation significantly and consistently improves the accuracy by almost 10% when compared to no augmentation. Secondly, augmentation also increases the labeling efficiency of AL. The labeling efficiency improves from 1.4√ó1.4\\times to 1.8√ó1.8\\times for ResNet-18 and 1.3√ó1.3\\times to 1.7√ó1.7\\times for VGG-11 towards the end. Thirdly, we note that while Badge actually outperforms entropy sampling in the no data augmentation case (which corroborates the results shown in¬†), there is no significant difference between the two with the addition of data augmentation (entropy sampling performs better than BADGE in just one of the selection rounds with Œ±=0.05ùõº0.05\\alpha=0.05). These results can be partly explained by the fact that data augmentation naturally introduces more diversity into the training. This addresses P3. 4.3 Optimizer and Other Generalization Techniques. Another aspect of AL evaluation involves analyzing the effect of the training strategy used. Past work in AL has mostly used adaptive gradient methods for optimization, such as Adam¬†  and RMSProp¬†. Given our analysis on generalization performance, it is natural to then consider the effect of using SGD over Adam since a number of works have argued that deep neural networks generalize better when trained with SGD as opposed to Adam¬†[ref]31 . We study this in the context of AL and with the use of data augmentation. In particular, we run our experiment on CIFAR-10¬† with ResNet-18 and compare Adam against SGD. For SGD, we use a momentum of 0.9, a weight decay of 0.00050.00050.0005, and a cosine-annealing learning rate (Tm‚Äãa‚Äãx=300subscriptùëáùëöùëéùë•300T_{max}=300). For Adam, we use no weight decay and the typical choice of Œ≤1,Œ≤2subscriptùõΩ1subscriptùõΩ2\\beta_{1},\\beta_{2} as 0.9 and 0.999, respectively. For both, we use a learning rate of 0.01. Based on our results (Figure¬†3), we see that Adam results in reduced test accuracy and lower labeling efficiency compared to SGD; however, it converges faster than SGD (for example, entropy sampling with SGD scores higher than with Adam in all rounds except the initial round with Œ±=0.05ùõº0.05\\alpha=0.05). Hence, the observations from¬†[ref]31  seem to also apply in the AL setting. Finally, we study the effect of some more advanced generalization approaches, viz., stochastic weight averaging (SWA)¬† and shake-shake regularization¬† in Appendix C, and we see that the takeaways are consistent: These approaches all improve the test performance of AL while maintaining high labeling efficiency. This addresses P4. 4.4 Active Learning with Redundancy. AL strategies are studied on academic data sets that are often not representative of large-scale data sets in real-world applications. Such data sets often contain many redundant data instances. To effectively evaluate these AL strategies, we rerun our baseline setting on a variant of CIFAR-10¬† where a set of unique data instances is kept fixed while another disjoint set of data instances is duplicated until the original size of 50k training instances is reached. We construct this data set such that the original class ratios are not altered. Consequently, this allows us to evaluate the effect of redundancy under the scope of P5. In all our experiments, we keep 5k unique data instances fixed. Figure 4 shows the results for this setting when the duplicated set is repeated 2√ó,5√ó,10√ó,2\\times,5\\times,10\\times, and 20√ó20\\times. We see that entropy sampling¬† progressively does worse when more redundancy is introduced whereas Badge¬† exhibits robustness to redundancy. Furthermore, the more redundancy there is, the more the labeling efficiency of Badge increases towards the end. We summarize by concluding our observation in P5: Diversity-based methods are robust against redundant data while uncertainty-based methods poorly handle redundant data. In Appendix D, we repeat this experiment by generating redundancies using augmentations on existing instances (random cropping and translation) as opposed to simple duplication ‚Äì we observe the same takeaways as above. 4.5 Effect of Examples Per Class. Since the labeling efficiencies achieved in CIFAR-100 (1.3√ó1.3\\times) are much lower than those achieved in CIFAR-10 (1.8√ó1.8\\times), we hypothesize that the number of examples per class in the unlabeled set plays an important role in how well AL works compared to RS. We suspect that having more examples per class in the unlabeled set allows for AL to make better choices in refining class performance. To verify this hypothesis, we conduct an experiment on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST wherein we vary the number of unlabeled data instances per class from 1k up to 3k. Results for this experiment are presented in Figure¬†5. We see that having a higher number of data instances per class results in higher relative test accuracies and labeling efficiencies with respect to random sampling. Hence, scenarios in which the unlabeled set is suspected to have few instances per class may be susceptible to reduced AL benefit as stated in P6 and as illustrated in this experiment. 4.6 Effect of Varying AL Batch Sizes and Initializations. To better understand how the choice of the AL batch size affects the evaluation of AL algorithms, we run an experiment on CIFAR-10 where the AL batch size is varied between 1000, 3000, and 6000 queried instances. The results are presented in Table 1. We see that the AL batch size has little effect on each selection algorithm‚Äôs obtained test accuracies and labeling efficiencies (no two configurations of the AL batch size had accuracies significantly different with Œ±=0.05ùõº0.05\\alpha=0.05 for more than 20% of the selection rounds). These results show that the choice of AL batch size is not heavily linked with an algorithm‚Äôs labeling efficiency. Thus, the choice of the AL batch size can be made to optimize the labeling-training pipeline in real-world settings. Almost all AL strategies assume a warm start; i.e., a small labeled seed set and a model trained on this set are already given. We next study the effect of choosing a sophisticated seed set on the generalization performance and labeling efficiency of AL. In this experiment, we compare a seed set formed by a facility location selection (to select a representative subset)¬†  against a randomly chosen seed set by repeating the baseline setting with these seed sets. The results are shown in Table 2. We observe that the carefully constructed seed sets offer a better initial accuracy; however, this benefit is quickly lost after only a few rounds of AL (entropy sampling with a random initialization versus entropy sampling with a facility location initialization is the only comparison to show a significant difference in test accuracy in a selection round with Œ±=0.05ùõº0.05\\alpha=0.05). We conclude that the seed set initialization does play a role very early on, but its influence diminishes after a few rounds of AL as stated in P7. 4.7 Model Reset vs. Update. We now analyze a strategy for reducing the training time wherein we update (fine-tune) the model from the previous rounds of AL. We perform this experiment on CIFAR-10, and we compare the update strategy with the resetting strategy. We see that the initial test accuracy is worse for every AL strategy when the model is updated in every round as opposed to when it is reset at every round. This is also corroborated by¬†[ref]3, wherein warm-starting deep models has the propensity to hurt generalization performance. However, we interestingly observe that the resetting strategy as well as the updating strategy converge to similar test accuracies at later rounds, implying that it does not matter as much whether we reset or update after a few rounds (there is not a statistically significant difference in test accuracy with Œ±=0.05ùõº0.05\\alpha=0.05 between resetting or updating for any given strategy in the later rounds). A critical difference between our setup and that of¬†[ref]3 is that the latter does not use data augmentation. Furthermore, the latter employs Adam instead of SGD. In Appendix E, we report an experiment identical to the one conducted in this section that employs Adam but without data augmentation. In this setting, we find that updating the model is consistently worse than resetting the model in every round. This illustrates another interesting benefit of data augmentation: we do not significantly lose generalization performance if we choose to update the model, which can save compute resources for expensive training tasks. In Appendix E, we illustrate this point on other data sets. 4.8 Scalability, Running Times, and Compute. Next, we discuss the running times of AL. Repeating the baseline, we run AL with an AL batch size of 3k instances for 8 rounds on CIFAR-10 up to a total of 25k instances (half of CIFAR-10). The total time taken for the intermediate training (across rounds) is 8 hours; in contrast, the total time taken by Badge selection (across rounds) is 1 hour whereas entropy sampling takes 3 minutes. The training time almost triples when we run for the entire data set. Specifically, the increase in training time over previous work can largely be attributed to data augmentation and SGD, which causes slower model convergence. This further implies increased energy consumption and CO2 emissions. To help alleviate and reduce the training times and compute, we suggest a few approaches. First, we can increase the AL batch size, thereby reducing the number of training rounds (which we have shown to be a significant computational bottleneck). Secondly, we can update the model from the previous rounds. This has negligible impact on performance in later rounds (as shown in Sec. 4.7) but only speeds up the running time by ¬†1.07√ó1.07\\times. As a faster training strategy, we also examine the use of data subset selection via the recently proposed Grad-Match¬† algorithm. Using only 30% of the labeled data for training, we see that there is negligible loss in accuracy while achieving a further 3√ó3\\times speedup in training. Finally, since entropy sampling is 20√ó20\\times faster than Badge, we propose the use of entropy sampling unless the data set has redundancy and repetitions. More details on the timings are in Appendix F.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: and list the compute resources needed to run these experiments in Appendix A.
