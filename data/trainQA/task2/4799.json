      "content": "Paper Title: Hypergraph-based Multi-Robot Task and Motion Planning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhen we consider planning problems with objects that can be moved by robots, we enter the domain of task and motion planning¬†.\nIf we model the state of the entire world (robots and objects) as a configuration space ùí≤ùí≤\\mathcal{W}, we end up with a highly under actuated system.\nWe only have direct control over the robot dofs,\nwhile the dofs corresponding to any object pose can only be changed indirectly through the robot acting upon them.\nAdditionally, the actions the robot takes affect the feasibility of motions.\nFor example, a valid motion for a robot not holding an object may no longer be valid if the robot is grasping an object, and the current placement of the objects affects the feasibility of motions. One approach is to treat each combination of the robot and held object as a unique robot and each placement of objects as a new environment.\nThis is sometimes referred to as multi-modal motion planning¬†   although this language is less intuitive than task and motion planning and can be confused for motion planning with different modes of locomotion. Instead, we define a task space ùíØùíØ\\mathcal{T}, where element Ti‚ààùíØsubscriptùëáùëñùíØT_{i}\\in\\mathcal{T} defines which object the robot is holding (or none), the grasp constraints for the held object, and valid poses for all ungrasped objects.\nThis defines a new configuration space ùí≤isubscriptùí≤ùëñ\\mathcal{W}_{i} for the robot (possibly while grasping an object).\nDetails of this are provided in Section¬†III. A system can switch between task space elements by applying an action that changes the constraints of valid motion.\nFor example, performing a pick action on an object removes the constraint that the object is on a stable surface and adds the constraint that the object is in a stable grasp for the robot. A system can only switch between task space elements at configurations that are valid within the two task space elements that it is switching between.\nIn practice, these are often stable grasps of objects that are sitting at stable poses on some surface in the environment or handoffs at the intersection of stable grasp poses for a set of robots¬†[ref]8.\nThese configurations satisfy the constraints of the task space element defining the robot grasping the object and the task space element where the object is located at that stable pose.\nDepending on the direction of the switch, these configurations can represent the moment of a pick or place action.\nFinding these transition configurations is considered the most challenging part of multi-modal planning¬†. When considering classic task and motion planning problems, it is often best to view them as a hybrid discrete-continuous search problems¬†.\nA solution consists of a finite and discrete sequence of task space elements (eg: which object to grasp) with\ncontinuous constraint parameters (poses and grasps of objects),\nand continuous motion paths within the configuration space WisubscriptùëäùëñW_{i} of each task state TisubscriptùëáùëñT_{i} to a configuration in the intersection with the subsequent task space element‚Äôs configuration space.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: practice, these are often stable grasps of objects that are sitting at stable poses on some surface in the environment or handoffs at the intersection of stable grasp poses for a set of robots¬†[ref]8.\nThese configurations satisfy the constraints of the task space element defining the robot grasping the object and the task space element where the object is located at that stable\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
