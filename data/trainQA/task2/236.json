      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Inverse Rendering of Faces from Real-world Videos\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInverse rendering of images: Decomposing an image into its intrinsic components is a long-standing and challenging task in computer vision.\nThe most popular forms are intrinsic images [ref]39, which define the decomposition layers as reflectance and shading (the function of shape and illumination).\nRecently, SIRFS  showed that further recovering surface normal and lighting from shading can improve the performance of decomposition.\nSince it is impossible to learn the decomposition without any constraints on the intrinsic components,\nclassical algorithms for inverse rendering usually rely on a sophisticated design of priors, such as sparsity of reflectance , user strokes , and RGB-D settings [ref]22[ref]3.\nThese priors lead to promising decomposition in specific applications but do not generalize well to in-the-wild images.\nDeep learning has also been applied to inverse rendering.\nGiven the lack of real ground truth data, some works perform supervised learning on synthetic datasets, but they still suffer from poor performance on real data. Our paper focuses on inverse rendering of human face images, which commonly serve as major objects in real world photos. Inverse rendering of human face: Since 3D morphable model (3DMM) of faces was proposed in 1999 , it has served as a statistical shape prior for face inverse rendering 3.\nTewari et al. 1 combined deep learning- and model-based capture in an end-to-end network to infer intrinsic components from a single input image, with a well designed differential parametric decoder;\nthey 0 further developed an algorithm to learn the facial shape and reflectance variations from uncontrained images, without a pre-existing shape identity or albedo model.\nHowever, these works are still based on parametric models on shape and reflectance, which resulted in loss of details. Another branch of research focuses on model-free structures .\nSengupta et al.  designed a training paradigm called SfSNet to learn fine-scale separation of albedo and normal;\nthey first trained a simple network on synthetic data to obtain coarse estimations for real images and then trained another decomposition architecture with residual blocks, on both synthetic and real data;\nthey claim that SfSNet can outperform state-of-the-art algorithms for inverse rendering of faces, but SfSNetâ€™s performance is restricted by the coarsely estimated labels of real data.\nIn addition, SfSNet only models local illumination of images, ignoring the spatially-varying components. This leads to artifacts on albedo and normal map, when there are obvious cast shadows or mutual illumination.\nWe propose a weakly supervised learning on real face videos, avoiding the dependence on labels of real data. Moreover, we design an IlluRes-SfSNet framework to extract spatially-varying illumination information. Inverse rendering of in-the-wild images: Due to the lack of dataset, multi-image based approaches have been introduced, with consistency of scene variables in images being used to constrain the solution, especially the similarity in albedo of the same object.\nResearchers in  trained their network with a set of images of a scene under varying illuminations but the same viewpoint, to help disambiguate albedo and shading, and the author of 4 further removed the constraint on the viewpoint of inputs by warping albedo before measuring similarity.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: Inverse rendering of images: Decomposing an image into its intrinsic components is a long-standing and challenging task in computer vision.\nThe most popular forms are intrinsic images [ref]39, which define the decomposition layers as reflectance and shading (the function of shape and illumination).\nRecently, SIRFS  showed that further recovering surface normal and lighting from\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
