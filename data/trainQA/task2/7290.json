      "content": "Paper Title: Securing Recommender System via Cooperative Training\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAccording to the defense objective, a defense can be (i) reactive attack detection[ref]35 or (ii) proactive robust model construction, which will be listed below. Reactive Attack detection.\nMany works have been developed to detect shilling attacks  [ref]37 , and such methods can be roughly classified into supervised classification methods and unsupervised clustering methods. The majority of work on supervised classification methods begins\nwith feature engineering and then turns to the development of algorithms. For example, Yang et al. utilized three carefully crafted features derived from user profiles for identifying attack profiles, which are the maximum, minimum, and average ratings of filler size. Besides, many researchers used KNN, C4.5, and SVM to supervise the statistical attributes to detect attacks. In most practical recommendation systems, due to the small number of labeled users and the lack of prior knowledge, unsupervised learning  and\nsemi-supervised learning  were used to detect attacks. Unsupervised clustering methods usually aim to group individuals into\ngroups and then eliminate suspicious ones. For example, adversarial sample detection techniques utilize machine learning methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA), to extract content features to identify adversarial samples. However, to pursue high recall, these methods inevitably delete normal data, which leads to biased recommendations. Conversely, for our proposed TCD to enrich high-confidence data rather than remove outliers, it can avoid cleaning normal data and train a more accurate and robust model. Proactive Robust recommendation. Athalye et al.[ref]43 proposed defenses based on gradient masking to produce models containing smoother gradients that hinder\noptimization-based attack algorithms from finding the wrong directions in space. More recently,\nmany works      have focused on adversarial\ntraining. Assuming that each instance may be the target of attacks\n, adversarial training adds perturbations to the inputs or model\nparameters that force the model to learn fragile perturbations. Although adversarial training can significantly improve the robustness of recommender systems, it is difficult to control the strength of adversarial data, reducing the generalization of the recommendation. Instead, our proposed TCD does not require the addition of sensitive noise and is trained cooperatively to facilitate generalization, as we will demonstrate in Section 4.\nIn addition, many researchers have also improved the robustness of models by altering the way matrix factorization is performed. Hidano and Kiyomoto  propose a defensive strategy that utilizes trim learning to enhance the resilience of matrix factorization against data poisoning. This approach leverages the statistical difference between normal and fake users to protect against malicious manipulation of the data. Zhang et al.  proposed a robust collaborative filtering method incorporating non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with R1-norm. While in , the authors have designed a robust matrix factorization model based on kernel mapping and kernel distance.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: According to the defense objective, a defense can be (i) reactive attack detection[ref]35 or (ii) proactive robust model construction, which will be listed below.
