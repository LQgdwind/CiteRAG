How to run data-intensive online services to improve everyday life without compromising personal values and freedoms? For instance, four apps  or spatio-temporal points [ref]2 are enough to identify 91.2% and 95% of individuals. In practice, the data-sharing doctrine ‘as little as possible, as much as necessary’ has not yet found a systematic and scalable applicability. The quality of online services is often a result of collective data-sharing decisions made by individuals consuming these services, for instance, traffic predictions using mobility data [ref]2 . To achieve a minimum quality of service for a population of individuals while maximizing their privacy, a collective arrangement (i.e. coordination) of their data-sharing decisions is required to minimize both excessive and insufficient levels of data sharing   . Although a recent survey finds a 58% of individuals willing to balance data sharing case-by-case , it proves cognitively and computationally hard to achieve  even when using state-of-the-art privacy preservation techniques such as differential privacy  0, secure multi-party computation 1 and k-anonymization  2. The absence, failure or inefficiency in this coordination exhibit a tragedy of the (data sharing) commons, making privacy easier to compromise than quality of service. As a result, studies show that 90% of individuals tend to give up privacy of their data, often without any added value , although 76% intend to protect it 3 4. This insight is fundamental to several studies on the willingness to accept rewards for giving up privacy or willingness to pay a cost for preserving privacy  5 6 7. Implications of giving up excessive personal data include energy-intensive and expensive data centers with unprocessed data growing faster than Moore’s law predictions, stress and anxiety, algorithmic biases, discrimination, censorship and influence of election results 8 9    . Therefore, establishing a coordinated data sharing is a collective action to recover privacy with an immense impact for the environment, health, society and democracy. How to make coordinated data sharing feasible. While privacy control is found essential for 82% of individuals in an earlier study  , so is convenience for 63%. The computational and communication load to coordinate data-sharing decisions at scale is overwhelming for humans alone. Instead, a scalable decision support can be provided by interactive personal assistants using cooperative artificial intelligence (AI) to cope with such complexity . These assistants can run on (mobile) devices of individuals who form a community (i.e. data collective) to consume an online service that relies on data they share as a result of a collective arrangement. In practice, the remote personal assistants interact in the background to coordinate how much and what data to share, to which data collector and for what purpose (see Fig. 1 and 2). These multi-agent interactions and calculations self-organize into fully decentralized unsupervised learning process  that optimizes data-sharing efficiency: maximizing quality of service and minimizing privacy cost. Compared to other AI approaches for personalized privacy assistants  applied to legal document analytics  and pervasive devices , this decision-support system is itself privacy-preserving and does not rely on any centralized third party (UNESCO IRCAI outstanding ). Therefore, the interactive personal assistants are trustworthy by design to serve as the privacy enabler of the data collective. This comes in stark contrast to the mainstream use of supervised AI algorithms that often require large concentrations of sensitive personal data for training 0  8. The proposed decision-support system can also operate as a trustworthy collective access control to local data by federated learning algorithms to train models in a privacy-preserving way 1 0. Hypotheses for understanding data-sharing conditions. The overarching aim of this study is to assess the capacity of this novel AI-based system to steer the data collective into more efficient and privacy-preserving trajectories for data sharing. Fig. 1 illustrates the main studied hypotheses. These hypotheses are formalized into four experimental conditions for data sharing under repeated measures (within-subjects design). They are rigorously compared with each other under high realism in a novel living-lab experiment, see Section 4.1, Fig. 8 and 9. Over 27,403 high-quality records of real data-disclosure decisions are collected by a novel platform developed for this purpose (see Section 4.2). It encompasses a smartphone app, a server to collect experimental data as well as a web portal with which the involved data collectors can access the shared data according to the privileges that participants give. The four studied experimental conditions shown in Fig. 2 are the following: 1. Attitudinal data sharing assesses how privacy-sensitive individuals perceive each of the 3​ criteria⋅4​ elements/criterion=12⋅3 criteria4 elements/criterion123\\text{ criteria}\\cdot 4\\text{ elements/criterion}=12 data-sharing elements, see Table LABEL:table:entry-phase, Questions B.9 to B.12 in Supplementary Information (SI). 2. Intrinsic data sharing assesses actual decisions made for voluntarily data sharing (without rewards) in a complete factorial design of 4​ sensors⋅4​ collectors⋅4​ contexts=64⋅⋅4 sensors4 collectors4 contexts644\\text{ sensors}\\cdot 4\\text{ collectors}\\cdot 4\\text{ contexts}=64 data-sharing scenarios. 3. Rewarded data sharing introduces an accumulated privacy-reward balance that individuals initially influence with their choices over the 64 data-sharing scenarios (see Fig. 9a). The built up balance can be further calibrated by making on-demand and repeated (unlimited within 24 hours) choices among the 64 data-sharing scenarios retrieved automatically. Each retrieved scenario is calculated to improve the individual’s choice: privacy or rewards, see Fig. 9b. To account for threats to validity and trace any order effects, this experimental condition is repeated twice (2⋅24⋅2242\\cdot 24 hours) by clearing the privacy-reward balance and collecting new data from sensors to share (Fig. 8). To challenge privacy preservation, the rewards are personalized by inflating and deflating the amounts based on each individual’s privacy perception derived from attitudinal data sharing, see Section LABEL:sec:model in SI. This design choice is also expected to engage participants more effectively by rewarding the data-sharing scenarios fairly, according to their personal values , while discouraging dropouts. 4. Coordinated data sharing relies on the AI-based personal assistants. They use the intrinsic and rewarded data-sharing levels as discrete options to choose from (ex-post condition). Each assistant makes an optimized choice among these that recovers the collective privacy loss of the rewarded data sharing, while reducing the mismatch (discrepancy/fitness measure) between the shared and the required data by a service provider. This is a quality-of-service indicator that finds general applicability in adaptive sensor selection and flexible data fusion for several smart city and industrial applications 2 3 4. Matching can also be applied by a coordinated data collective to preserve k𝑘k-anonymity in a bottom-up way, i.e. no more than k𝑘k individuals share any combination of personal data  2 5. Smartphone sensor data play a pivotal role on privacy. This paper studies sharing of smartphone sensor data with five discrete choices to choose from (uniform sampling of 100% to 0% of sensor data with a step of 25%), see Fig. 9b. These choices are applied to the total sensor data collected with a fixed frequency of 30 sec (100% of data). This is a simple and general discrete-choice model that serves complexity of the experiment. It can be extended to more complex spatio-temporal models as discussed in Section 3. The study of smartphone sensor data is particularly impactful for both privacy and quality of online services. Sensor fusion has a paramount role in applications of smart homes, grids and transportation 2. There is evidence that smartphone app developers delegate privacy to end-users as the former face challenges in providing privacy solutions at the design and implementation phase 6. In practice though, it is the powerful data intermediaries that leverage the terms of data-sharing agreements  . Sharing smartphone sensor data can be regulated via privacy-protection mechanisms with a natural utility-driven interpretation (buy-sell) such as differential privacy . Given the symbiotic relationship of individuals with their smartphones, capturing high-dimensional and diverse sensor data for different application scenarios, the study comes with a universal scope on privacy. A novel approach to understanding data-sharing decisions. The performed living-lab experiment is the first of its kind: (i) It brings together all four data-sharing conditions for comparison, including the novel one of coordinated data sharing. This is distinguished from earlier survey studies and empirical observations focusing on the two dimensions of intentions vs. behavior that comprise the privacy paradox 7 8. (ii) The experimental design uses mixed modalities to achieve rigor within a controlled lab environment as well as realism, scale and external validity by tracing behavior out of the lab using a smartphone platform developed for this purpose (see Section 4.2). (iii) The 4x4x4 factorial design results in 64 data-sharing scenarios (see Fig. 2). They involve the three data-sharing criteria that model the involved trust (data collectors) and risks (data type and context), and they are the ones that explain malleable data-sharing behaviors 5  9. This large spectrum comes in contrast to earlier experiments and field tests made within a context and involving a specific data-sharing scenario such as online social lending 0, crowdfunding 1 and commerce 7 5 2 3.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: with impact on society.
