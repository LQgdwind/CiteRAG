      "content": "Paper Title: Pose Invariant Person Re-Identification using Robust Pose-transformation GAN\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn one of the earliest definitions , Person Re-Identification is described as, “to identify it (the person) as the same particular as one encountered on a previous occasion”. In image based re-ID, the detected and localised set of pedestrians construct the ‘gallery’ set. Given any query image, the re-ID model aims to retrieve all possible instances of the person-of-interest from the gallery set. Therefore, person re-ID is considered as an interdisciplinary field which sits in between image classification and information retrieval. In recent years, person re-ID has gained significant importance due to its widespread applications in security and surveillance, public safety, crowd control etc. Combining person re-ID with other branches of computer vision, such as face recognition, pose determination, activity recognition etc. head towards developing smart homes and cities. However, the primary bottleneck in developing robust person re-ID models arises from intra-class variations, i.e. the large appearance change of the same person across different scenes and camera views. This is mainly contributed to large pose change of the person-of-interest, which is also responsible for self-occlusion of the subject. The pose change of human subjects often lead to occlusion by external attributes (objects). In addition to that, in image-based re-ID, challenges such as inaccurate detection, occlusion, variation of illumination and resolution etc. are significant hindrances (Fig. 1) from achieving high accuracy with robustness. Person re-identification is generally performed in two steps: learning discriminative features from the given image of the person-of-interest, and retrieve (and rank) all possible instances of the person-of-interest from the gallery set based on the feature similarity (distance metric) Most existing methods   make use of complex Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as the backbone for feature extraction from pedestrian images. However, DNNs require a large number of samples (images) per person for proper training, hence it has limited success on smaller datasets. Also, the conventional problems of varying illumination, scale and occlusion are still persistent with DNN based model. The idea of pose independence has been recently explored in the re-ID community [ref]4 [ref]5 [ref]6 . In this work, we argue that pose variation is the most significant hindrance when it comes to achieving highly accurate re-ID performance, and we focus on leveraging the pose dependence along with attaining invariance in occlusion, scale, illumination and rotation. We achieve this by modelling the person-of-interest into multiple significant poses and then combining the extracted features from each of these models to generate a complete viewpoint invariant feature vector. The proposed end-to-end re-ID pipeline is constructed upon three building blocks: A pose transformational GAN (pt-GAN) model to generate a given person image in any pose An unsupervised Pose Clustering model to select the significant poses for pose transformation A Feature Fusion Network (FusionNet) to effectively combine the discriminative features from the generated images and the source image. At the heart of this re-ID model is the in-house developed pose transformational GAN (pt-GAN), which is an improvement over our previous work  in terms of loss function and training methodology; finetuned on re-ID datasets. Combining this with Pose Clustering and FusionNet, we emphasize our contribution in this paper as follows: We propose an end-to-end feature extraction model for person re-ID while achieving pose invariance. Additionally, robustness is achieved in terms of illumination, scale, occlusion and rotation by using efficient data augmentation techniques and utilizing inherent CNN features through the GAN architecture. The proposed end-to-end trainable model provides a powerful methodology to learn a viewpoint invariant feature representation from a single instance of the person-of-interest. The proposed person re-ID framework incorporates an in-house developed pt-GAN architecture that serves as an efficient data augmentation tool. Incorporating this pose transformation GAN benefits in achieving an increase in the training dataset where the available dataset is small. Our work is validated on four benchmark datasets, i.e. three large scale public datasets Market-1501 , CUHK03 0 and DukeMTMC-reID 1 and a small-scale dataset CUHK01 2. The proposed method surpasses the GAN based person re-ID models in both Rank-1 accuracy and mean Average Precision (mAP), and the results are comparable to the state-of-the art methods. Additionally, the proposed method also outperforms the popular state-of-the-art re-ID models in terms of performance improvement over baseline. The rest of the paper is organised as follows: in section II, recent practices and developments in the re-ID community is explained, drawing a comparison to our method. Subsequently in section III, we formally define the problem of person re-identification. The intrinsic details of our model is demonstrated in section III and the experimental setting and detailed results are compared in section IV and V, respectively.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: the conventional problems of varying illumination, scale and occlusion are still persistent with DNN based model.
