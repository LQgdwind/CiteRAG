Since Batch Normalization (BN) was proposed by¬†, various normalization methods have emerged.\nRecurrent Batch Normalization¬†[ref]5 applies BN to the hidden-to-hidden transition of recurrent neural networks, improving the generalization ability on various sequential problems.\nLayer Normalization¬†[ref]2 (LN) performs a similar normalization to BN, but on elements across the channel or feature dimension, mainly used in sequential models like plain RNN¬†, LSTM¬†, GRU¬†, and Transformer¬†4.\nInstance Normalization¬†3 (IN) normalizes activations per channel for individual samples, mainly used in image style transfer¬†.\nPositional Normalization¬† (PN) normalizes activations along the channel dimension for generative networks.\nGroup Normalization¬†5 (GN) is a middle way between IN and LN.\nGN divides the channels into groups and implements normalization within each group, mainly used in computer vision¬† . In addition to these, some methods explore combinations of these methods.\nBatch Group Normalization¬† uses the mixed statistics of GN and BN. Batch-Channel Normalization¬† wraps BN and GN in a module.\nDivisive Normalization¬† proposes a unified view of LN and BN. Switchable Normalization¬† is a learning-to-normalize method, which switches between IN, LN, and BN by learning their importance weights in an end-to-end manner.\nTo avoid redundant computation, Sparse Switchable Normalization¬† selects only one normalizer for each normalization layer with the help of SparsestMax, a sparse version of softmax.\nBatch-Instance Normalization¬† learns to adaptively combine BN and IN.\nIBN¬† uses IN in some channels or layers and BN in other channels or layers.\nXBNBlock¬† replaces the BN with batch-free normalization, like GN, in the bottleneck block of residual-style networks. Instead of subtracting the mean and divided by the sample standard deviation, there exist other operations to do normalization.\nL1superscriptùêø1L^{1} batch normalization¬† replaces the sample standard deviation with the average absolute deviation from the mean, thus improving numerical stability in low-precision implementations as well as providing computational and memory benefits substantially.\nLike IN, Filter Response Normalization¬†0 also normalizes the activations of each channel of a single feature map, but only divides by the mean squared norm without subtracting the mean value.\nSimilarly, Power Normalization¬† divides by the mean squared norm along the batch dimension and is mainly used in Transformer for NLP tasks.\nRMSNorm¬†9 preserves the re-scaling invariance property of LN but eschews the re-centering invariance property, making it computationally simpler and more efficient than LN.\nScaleNorm¬† further simplifies RMSNorm by setting only one uniform scale parameter for each layer. Rather than on activations, some methods normalize weights.\nWeight Normalization¬† aims at decoupling the magnitudes of those weight vectors from their directions by introducing a specific magnitude parameter for each weight vector.\nWeight Standardization¬† standardizes the weights in the convolutional layers to accelerate the training, which is motivated by¬† that shows the smoothing effects of BN on activations. Improvements of Batch Normalization.\nDespite so many normalization methods, BN is still the most widely used and generally effective for convolutional neural networks¬† .\nHowever, the original BN comes with some noticeable disadvantages.\nThe most known one is the poor performance when the batch size is relatively small¬†5, due to the unstable batch statistics.\nTo address this issue, Batch Renormalization¬† uses population statistics instead of batch statistics while subtly retaining the backpropagation of batch statistics.\nTo further stabilize training, Moving Average Batch Normalization¬†7 substitutes batch statistics by moving average statistics in both forward and backward propagation.\nEvalNorm¬†1 estimates the corrected normalization statistics during evaluation to address the performance degradation of BN.\nBased on Taylor polynomials, Cross-Iteration Batch Normalization¬†8 jointly utilizes multiple recent iterations to enhance the estimation quality of batch statistics.\nOur proposed L2subscriptùêø2L_{2}BN is also an improvement of BN.\nHowever, unlike the above methods, L2subscriptùêø2L_{2}BN is developed to address the issues of inter-class feature discrepancy and intra-class feature compactness caused by BN, which is ignored by previous work.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: Typical Normalization Methods.
