For example, the following rule states that travellers can enter the US if\nthey had a negative test sometime in the last 222 days ( [ref]2) and have held fully vaccinated status throughout the last 151515 days ( 5): Datasets in this setting consist of temporal facts composed of\na first-order fact annotated with a temporal interval, for example, A‚Äãu‚Äãt‚Äãh‚Äão‚Äãr‚Äãi‚Äãs‚Äãe‚Äãd‚Äã(J‚Äão‚Äãh‚Äãn)‚Äã@‚Äã[13,213.5]ùê¥ùë¢ùë°‚Ñéùëúùëüùëñùë†ùëíùëëùêΩùëú‚Ñéùëõ@13213.5Authorised(John)@[13,213.5]. DatalogMTL is a powerful KR language and standard reasoning tasks, such as consistency and fact entailment, are PSpace-complete in data complexity 8. This makes efficient implementation in data-intensive applications challenging. The most common technique of choice in scalable Datalog reasoners is materialisation (a.k.a., forward chaining)  5  [ref]2.\nFacts entailed by a program and dataset are derived in successive rounds of rule applications\nuntil a fixpoint is reached; both this process and its output are often referred to as materialisation. The semina√Øve algorithm forms the basis for efficient implementation by ensuring that each inference during rule application is only performed once, thus eliminating redundant computations.\nOnce the materialisation has been computed, queries can be answered directly and rules are not further considered. The use of metric temporal operators in rules, however, introduces a number of challenges for materialisation-based reasoning.\nFirst, interpretations over the rational timeline are intrinsically infinite, whereas partial materialisations computed during reasoning must be finitely represented. Second,\nin contrast to Datalog where materialisation naturally terminates, in DatalogMTL a fixpoint may only be reachable after infinitely many rounds of rule applications. As a matter of fact, reasoning techniques initially proposed for DatalogMTL were not materialisation-based. In particular, optimal decision procedures are automata-based 8, and reasoning is also feasible by reduction to satisfiability checking in linear temporal logic (LTL) ; finally, the Ontop system\nimplements a query rewriting approach which is applicable only to non-recursive programs . In our recent work , we proposed a materialisation-based procedure optimised for efficient application of DatalogMTL rules by means of suitable temporal indices, and where partial materialisations are succinctly represented as sets of temporal facts.\nWe also identified a fragment of DatalogMTL [ref]21 for which our materialisation-based procedure is guaranteed\nto terminate; this fragment imposes suitable\nrestrictions which effectively disallow\nprograms expressing ‚Äòrecursion through time‚Äô.\nTo ensure termination in the general case for consistency and fact entailment tasks, we proposed and implemented in the MeTeoR system  an algorithm combining materialisation with the construction of B√ºchi automata, so that the use of automata-based techniques is minimised in favour of materialisation; thus, the scalability of this approach in most practical cases is critically dependent on that of its materialisation component. The materialisation-based procedure in MeTeoR is, however, based on a na√Øve strategy where the main source of inefficiency stems from redundant computations. In this paper, we propose a semina√Øve materialisation-based procedure for DatalogMTL, which can be seamlessly applied in isolation to finitely materialisable fragments [ref]21, or used in the general case in combination with automata-based techniques . As in , our procedure iteratively performs materialisation steps which compute partial materialisations consisting of temporal facts; furthermore, each materialisation step performs a round of rule applications followed by a coalescing phase where temporal facts differing only in their (overlapping) intervals are merged together. However, in contrast to  and analogously to the classical semina√Øve algorithm for Datalog¬†, our procedure aims at minimising redundant computation by considering only rule instances that involve information newly derived in the previous materialisation step. Lifting the semina√Øve strategy to DatalogMTL involves significant technical challenges.\nIn particular, rule bodies now involve metric atoms, and derived temporal facts can be coalesced with existing facts in the previous partial materialisation.\nAs a result, keeping track of new information and identifying the relevant rule instances to consider in each materialisation step becomes much more involved than in Datalog.\nWe show that these difficulties can be overcome in an elegant and effective way, and propose additional optimisations aimed at further reducing redundancy for programs satisfying certain syntactic restrictions. We have implemented our approach as an extension of MeTeoR and evaluated its performance. Our experiments show that our semina√Øve strategy and the additional optimisations lead to significant reductions in materialisation times.\nA technical appendix containing full proofs of our technical results and the code for our implementation are available online.111https://github.com/wdimmy/MeTeoR/tree/main/experiments/RR2022.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: metric temporal logic¬†2 interpreted over the rational timeline.
