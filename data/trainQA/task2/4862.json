      "content": "Paper Title: Hypergraphs for multiscale cycles in structured data\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile many persistent homology software return some generator, the generators are often chosen in an aribtrary manner. We present the minimal generators as a principled way of choosing generators. We first compute the generators that minimises the length of the loops. We do this by solving an optimization problem with rational coefficients  and interpreting the output as generators with ùîΩ2subscriptùîΩ2\\mathbb{F}_{2} coefficients. We then perform jump-minimization  to find the generator with the smallest amount of jumps between consecutive points. Length minimised generators.\nGiven a persistence diagram, we fix the persistent homology classes using the standard matrix decomposition procedure . Note that a generator is a collection of edges that form a loop(s). For each persistent homology class, we find the generator that minimises the sum of the edge lengths. The straightforward approach is to solve the binary optimization problem that minimises the total length of the loop while restricting the coefficients to be 0,101{0,1}. As this is an NP-hard problem, a variety of combinatorial techniques have been proposed  [ref]38 . In , authors approach the NP-hard problem by allowing the solutions to have rational coefficients. This related optimization problem can be solved using linear programming. Their computational experiments show that nearly all solutions resulted in generators with {‚àí1,0,1}101\\{-1,0,1\\} coefficients. Thus, one can interpret the length-minimised generators over the rational coefficients as length-minimised generators with ùîΩ2subscriptùîΩ2\\mathbb{F}_{2} coefficients. We refer the reader to Algorithm 1 of  for details. In our experiments, all length minimization over rational coefficients resulted in generators with coefficients in {‚àí1,0,1}101\\{-1,0,1\\}. In theory, it is possible for the length-minimal generators over the ‚Ñö‚Ñö\\mathbb{Q} to have coefficients in {‚àí1,0,1}101\\{-1,0,1\\}. When one encounters such solution, then one could convert all nonzero coefficients to 111, effectively forcing all coefficients to be in ùîΩ2subscriptùîΩ2\\mathbb{F}_{2}. Note that the outcome isn‚Äôt necessarily a loop.\nOnce we find the length-minimised generator with coefficients in ùîΩ2subscriptùîΩ2\\mathbb{F}_{2}, we denote the collection of vertices that constitute the generator as (v0,‚Ä¶,vn)subscriptùë£0‚Ä¶subscriptùë£ùëõ(v_{0},\\dots,v_{n}) with v0<v1<‚ãØ<vnsubscriptùë£0subscriptùë£1‚ãØsubscriptùë£ùëõv_{0}<v_{1}<\\dots<v_{n}. Jump-minimization.\nGiven a point pùëùp in the persistence diagram with birth parameter bùëèb and death parameter dùëëd, let (v0,‚Ä¶,vn)subscriptùë£0‚Ä¶subscriptùë£ùëõ(v_{0},\\dots,v_{n}) denote its length-minimised generator. During this second step, we iteratively update the generator by preferring generators that have smaller jumps between consecutive vertices . That is, let gùëîg denote the collection of 111-simplices that represent the generator (v0,‚Ä¶,vn)subscriptùë£0‚Ä¶subscriptùë£ùëõ(v_{0},\\dots,v_{n}). Assume that there exists a vertex v‚àósubscriptùë£v_{*} such that vi<v‚àó<vi+1subscriptùë£ùëñsubscriptùë£subscriptùë£ùëñ1v_{i}<v_{*}<v_{i+1}, and let g‚àósubscriptùëîg_{*} denote the colelction of 111-simplices that represent the generator (v0,‚Ä¶,vi,v‚àó,vi+1,‚Ä¶,vn)subscriptùë£0‚Ä¶subscriptùë£ùëñsubscriptùë£subscriptùë£ùëñ1‚Ä¶subscriptùë£ùëõ(v_{0},\\dots,v_{i},v_{*},v_{i+1},\\dots,v_{n}). If [g]=[g‚àó]delimited-[]ùëîdelimited-[]subscriptùëî[g]=[g_{*}] in H1‚Äã(Xb)subscriptùêª1subscriptùëãùëèH_{1}(X_{b}), then we update the current generator (v0,‚Ä¶,vn)subscriptùë£0‚Ä¶subscriptùë£ùëõ(v_{0},\\dots,v_{n}) with (v0,‚Ä¶,vi,v‚àó,vi+1,‚Ä¶,vn)subscriptùë£0‚Ä¶subscriptùë£ùëñsubscriptùë£subscriptùë£ùëñ1‚Ä¶subscriptùë£ùëõ(v_{0},\\dots,v_{i},v_{*},v_{i+1},\\dots,v_{n}). Algorithmically, we start with the early vertex v0subscriptùë£0v_{0} and iteratively perform jump-minimization until we reach the last vertex vnsubscriptùë£ùëõv_{n}. Recall that there may be rare cases in which the length-minimization over the rational coefficients isn‚Äôt necessarily a loop in H1‚Äã(Xb)subscriptùêª1subscriptùëãùëèH_{1}(X_{b}) with ùîΩ2subscriptùîΩ2\\mathbb{F}_{2} coefficients. In such cases, we still perform jump-minimization by testing whether the 2-simplex [vi,v‚àó,vi+1]subscriptùë£ùëñsubscriptùë£subscriptùë£ùëñ1[v_{i},v_{*},v_{i+1}] is trivial in H1‚Äã(Xb)subscriptùêª1subscriptùëãùëèH_{1}(X_{b}) or not. Figure¬†7 illustrates the need for such jump minimization step. Figure¬†7A illustrates an example length-minimal generator over the rationals. When one has a collection of points that are in a line segment, the minimal generator will make arbitrary choices in terms of which points are included in the minimal generator. The jump minimization step Figure¬†7B. The code for computing minimal generators is available in the minimal generators GitHub repository¬†(see¬†Code availability).\n\nReference markers found: [38]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]38: problem that minimises the total length of the loop while restricting the coefficients to be 0,101{0,1}.
