With technical analysis, investors and traders tend to forecast stock prices relying on historical price patterns. Fundamental analysis aims to assess the intrinsic value of a stock by considering other factors besides historical prices, such as financial statements, industry trends, and economic conditions. Since stock movement prediction involves sequential data, RNN-based networks are applied in many works. ALSTM  [ref]28 integrated a dual-stage attention mechanism with LSTM. Adv-ALSTM  [ref]8 further employed adversarial training by adding perturbations to simulate the stochastic and unstable nature of the price variable. In recent years, researchers also exploited attention-based mechanisms to model complex interactions. DTML   is proposed to predict by using a transformer and LSTM to capture the asymmetric and dynamic correlations between stocks. With the development and prosperity of NLP technology, text from social media and online news has become a new popular source of fundamental analysis. HAN  [ref]15 designed two attention networks to recognize both the influential time periods of a sequence and the important news at a given time. Stocknet   proposed a deep generative model with recurrent, continuous latent variables. MSHAN   exploited a multi-stage TCN-LSTM hybrid model. PEN   proposed a Shared Representation Learning module to capture interactions between price data and text data. Additionally, many works modeled the correlation between stocks to enhance stock price prediction. MAN-SF   constructed a graph attention network with price features, social media, and inter-stock relationships based on the interrelationship between price and tweets. CMIN   was proposed to model the asymmetric correlations between stocks by computing transfer entropy. In addition, Co-CPC   modeled the dependence between a certain stock industry and relevant macroeconomic variables. All the aforementioned methods aim to discover the correlation relations among stocks, as elaborated before, the causal relations are more appropriate to depict the information flow of stocks. In this work, we aim to model the causal relations for better stock movement prediction performance.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: prices, such as financial statements, industry trends, and economic conditions.
