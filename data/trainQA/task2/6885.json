      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Fast and Accurate Image-Text Retrieval with Self-Supervised Fine-Grained Alignment\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nImage-text retrieval (ITR) is a long-standing task that requires an AI agent to retrieve semantically relevant images given a text query and vice versa. The key challenge of ITR is to bridge the heterogeneous gap between low-level visual appearance and high-level abstract language and align their representations. It is also a fundamental problem for a series of vision and language tasks\n  . In real-world scenarios, besides effective cross-modal alignment for accurate retrieval, the retrieval system also strives to make real-time retrieval possible with low latency. Therefore, how to balance the accuracy and efficiency becomes a key challenge for large-scale image-text retrieval. Most of the previous works make much effort on either retrieval efficiency or retrieval accuracy. Early independent-embedding approaches 0   (Figure 1(a)) encode each image and text independently into global embeddings. Then image-text similarity is computed by directly measuring the distance between their global embeddings in a common semantic space. Since there are no interactions between texts and images, independent-embedding approaches allow offline data embedding extraction and linear computational complexity [ref]26 for online retrieval. Hence such approaches are widely applied in real-world large-scale retrieval. However, their retrieval accuracy is not satisfactory since such a global embedding alignment strategy cannot guarantee fine-grained content alignment. To alleviate this problem, interactive-embedding approaches    (Figure 1(b)) are proposed for fine-grained image-text retrieval by aligning visual objects in an image with words in a text by cross-modal attention mechanism. However, for each query, all the retrieved samples need complex attention computation to encode their embeddings, which is quite time-consuming and not scalable to large-scale online retrieval scenarios. How to leverage the advantages of independent-embedding approaches and interactive-embedding approaches to achieve both high accuracy and practical efficiency becomes an essential problem. Current progress [ref]28 2  aims to introduce computation-efficient interactions into the independent-embedding framework. The typical solutions can be divided into three types: measuring fine-grained word-object similarities instead of global embedding similarities (a.k.a late-interaction approach as shown in Figure 1 (c)) [ref]28 [ref]26, adopting independent-embedding approaches for coarse retrieval first and then using interactive-embedding approaches for finer retrieval  (a.k.a. two-stage approach as shown in Figure 1 (e)) 2 , and exploiting stronger intra-modal interactive encoder instead of the time-consuming cross-modal interactive encoder (a.k.a. intra-interactive embedding approach as shown in Figure 1 (d)) 7 . However, compared with independent-embedding approaches, these trade-off solutions still demand extra time cost in the retrieval stage due to complex similarity measurement, cross-modal embedding interactions, or heavyweight encoder structure.\nThey sacrifice the retrieval efficiency for the benefits of fine-grained feature learning. In this paper, to enable fine-grained image-text alignment for accurate retrieval while maintain high retrieval efficiency as the independent-embedding models, we propose a novel trade-off strategy to learn fine-grained image-text alignment by contrastive-based embedding mapping. The advantage of contrastive-based embedding mapping is that it does not require cross-modal fusion during the inference stage. In our approach, we achieve embedding alignment between images and texts by a new module, named as SelfAlign. Based on the backbone of independent-embedding models, SelfAlign aims to align image and text embeddings from local to global by multi-level self-supervised contrastive learning. In this way, independent-embedding models injected with SelfAlign enhance original global embedding with more accurate fine-grained semantic alignment across different modalities. In the inference stage, the baseline model without the SelfAlign module conducts image and text encoding independently while maintains fine-grained embedding alignment ability. Therefore, SelfAlign enables independent-embedding models to achieve superior retrieval accuracy without sacrificing efficiency. Specifically, SelfAlign is designed to explore fine-grained correspondence via mining rich visual and textual semantic content in different layers of the independent-embedding models. There are two sub-modules in SelfAlign responsible for semantic alignment at concept level and context level: (1) To capture the pair-wise correspondence among visual region and textual words, Local Concept Alignment (LCA) sub-module is first proposed to learn the concept-level alignment in the lower layer. (2) Since the semantically similar concepts have different semantics in different contexts, Context Relation Alignment (CRA) sub-module is further proposed to be injected into higher embedding layer to achieve context-level alignment. As a result, independent-embedding models with SelfAlign learn fine-grained alignment between images and texts from local semantics to global semantics progressively. The main contributions are summarized as follows: (1) We introduce a novel trade-off strategy for image-text retrieval to learn fine-grained alignment by contrastive-based embedding mapping. The contrastive-based embedding mapping aligns the fine-grained image and text embeddings via cross-modal contrastive learning during the training stage without requiring cross-modal fusion during the inference stage. Thus, our approach has the benefits of both the interactive-embedding models and the independent-embedding models, i.e., enhancing fine-grained alignment learning while preserving the independent-embedding framework for efficient retrieval. (2) We propose a fine-grained image-text alignment module SelfAlign to achieve the trade-off strategy. Two sub-modules of SelfAlign conduct concept alignment and context alignment via cluster-based contrastive learning and global-to-local contrastive learning. Therefore, SelfAlign equips the global embedding of the independent-embedding models with multi-level fine-grained alignment to improve the retrieval accuracy without extra supervision. (3) SelfAlign is a generic module that can be injected into various independent-embedding models. We incorporate SelfAlign with two representative independent-embedding models. Experimental results show that SelfAlign consistently boosts the accuracy of state-of-the-art independent-embedding models respectively by 9.1%, 4.2% and 6.6% in terms of R@sum on Flickr30K, MS-COCO 1K and MS-COCO 5K. The performance also outperforms most existing interactive-embedding models with orders of magnitude decrease of retrieval time.\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: in a common semantic space.
