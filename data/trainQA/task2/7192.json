      "content": "Paper Title: A Heterogeneous RISC-V based SoC for Secure Nano-UAV Navigation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe number of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and the spectrum of IoT applications are rapidly growing: from home automation, robotics, industrial gateways, and building automation to smart cities, digital signage, medical equipment, and more¬†.\nIn this context, nano-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (nano-UAVs) can be considered the ‚Äúultimate‚Äù IoT node, thanks to their ability to navigate, sense, analyse, and understand the surrounding environment.\nNano-UAVs have a form factor of a few centimeters in diameter, and a weight of only tens of grams, which allows them to safely operate near humans and in narrow, cramped spaces¬†[ref]2 .\nThey have a total power envelope of a few Watts, of which only 5-15% for computation¬†, and their small physical footprint and limited payload restrain the maximum battery, the printed circuit board size and exclude any form of active cooling.\nNowadays, Œºùúá\\mucontroller units (MCUs) are the only computing platforms that meet the nano-UAV‚Äôs power and form-factor constraints. MCUs feature simple RISC host processors (e.g., ARM Cortex-M) with low computational capabilities and no virtualization support, to which they expose just a few hundred kBytes of on-chip SRAM scratchpad memory (SPM)¬†    [ref]9 0 1.\nTo deliver more advanced computational capabilities, state-of-the-art (SoA) MCUs integrate accelerators with high data processing capabilities¬†    [ref]9 0 1.\nUsually, ultra-low-power (ULP) devices‚Äô accelerators are hardwired application-specific data-paths[ref]9 0 which achieve the best energy efficiency but are tailored to a single application domain, leading to poor programmability and a high nonrecurring engineering cost¬†2 while occupying a considerable part of the scarce area resources.\nTo improve the overall versatility of the SoC, recent works replace ASIC accelerators with fully programmable parallel accelerators¬†  that achieve competitive energy efficiency while maintaining significant flexibility, and hence make the most out of the available power and area. The increase in computing capabilities of SoA MCUs has enabled nano-UAVs to achieve autonomous flight while executing intelligent auxiliary tasks.\nFor example, Quantized Neural Networks (QNNs) have been proposed to carry out obstacle avoidance [ref]2 or human pose estimation and object detection¬†.\nAt the same time, floating point (FP) digital-signal-processing (DSP) computation has been proposed for path planning or structural build monitoring¬†3 4.\nAlso, a recent trend for edge devices is online learning, which enables a small portion of the Neural Networks (NN) training to happen on the edge, increasing the accuracy and reliability directly on the field¬†5 6.\nNevertheless, even the most advanced MCUs, supporting this new class of applications, lag behind in terms of software support.\nDue to the small amount of available memory and the simplicity of their host CPU, SoA MCUs only provide close-to-metal software environments, based on minimal real-time operating systems (RTOS) or simple bare-metal runtimes.\nHowever, enabling the execution of full-fledged OSs (like Linux), securely along with the real-time control applications, would allow nano-UAVs to leverage an existing, mature, and solid software stack and hence ease the software development¬†7.\nIn this context, this work presents a step forward in the current and future generation of autonomous nano-UAVs.\nWe present Shaheen, a 9m‚Äãm2ùëösuperscriptùëö2mm^{2} 200mW heterogeneous System-on-Chip (SoC) implemented in 22¬†nmtimes22nanometer22\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{nm} FDX technology that couples an application-class RV64 host processor with a low-power HyperRAM memory controller and with a flexible cluster of eight RV32 cores, providing best-in-class energy efficiency and performance for IoT applications.\nThe design is fine-tuned to accommodate the requirements of emerging nano-UAV applications. The host includes hardware virtualization support¬†8: to the best of our knowledge, it is the first silicon implementation fully compliant with the ratified RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) Hypervisor extension111SiFive, Ventana, and StarFive have announced RISC-V CPU designs with Hypervisor extension support, but we are not aware of any silicon available on the market yet., enabling the secure coexistence of an RTOS and a full-blown OS onto the same host core.\nIn particular, the Hypervisor extension aims to provide confidentiality and integrity of virtual machines (VM) by enforcing isolation (via two-stage virtual memory) between multiple consolidated guest OSes, i.e., General Purpose OS (GPOS) and RTOS.\nTo further isolate the execution of these coexisting software stacks (trusted and untrusted), prevent security threats, and ensure multi-domain operations, the host core features Physical Memory Protection (PMP)¬†9 and ISA and micro-architecture extensions for timing channel mitigation¬†.\nNamely, the PMP aims to provide confidentiality and integrity by limiting the physical addresses accessible by software running on CVA6. PMP enforces the separation between the bare-metal firmware (running in machine mode) and everything else through a set of additional registers, which specify the physical memory access privileges (read, write, execute) for each physical memory region. Lastly, timing channel mitigation aims to provide confidentiality by eliminating side-channel attacks. Apart from a 1MB on-chip SRAM SPM, Shaheen connects to up to 512MB of off-chip low-power HyperRAMs¬† directly on the main interconnect, through a low-power, low-cost 0.27m‚Äãm2ùëösuperscriptùëö2mm^{2} 1.6¬†Gbpstimes1.6Gbps1.6\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{G}\\mathrm{b}\\mathrm{p}\\mathrm{s} fully-digital memory controller.\nRelying on HyperRAMs instead of high-end LPDDR4/5 memories, typically integrated into embedded Linux-capable systems, frees Shaheen from expensive and proprietary memory controllers with large mixed-signal PHYs, while still exposing hundreds of MB to the host processor and matching the tight power, form factor and cost requirements of nano-UAVs. The cluster integrates the so-called Flex-V cores.\nThe Flex-V core extends the RISC-V ISA with custom instructions for reduced-precision single instruction multiple data (SIMD) FP-based computation and byte and sub-byte mixed-precision QNN inference, achieving State-of-the-Art (SoA) software power and energy efficiency.\nThanks to the aggressive optimizations, the cluster achieves up to 22.5 GigaOperations per second (GOp/s) and 90¬†GOp/stimes90GOps90\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{G}\\mathrm{O}\\mathrm{p}\\mathrm{/}\\mathrm{s} on 8-bit and 2-bit integer kernels, enabling low-latency mixed-precision QNN-based autonomous navigation¬†[ref]2 .\nFurthermore, the cluster achieves up to 4 GigaFloating-Point Operations per second (GFLOp/s) and 7.9¬†GFLOp/stimes7.9GFLOps7.9\\text{\\,}\\mathrm{G}\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{L}\\mathrm{O}\\mathrm{p}\\mathrm{/}\\mathrm{s} on FP32 and FP16 kernels enabling DSP and online training of neural networks (NNs)5 6. To sum up, compared to the State-of-the-Art MCUs for nano-UAVs, Shaheen is the first one coupling: an RV64 host with Hypervisor support and security features, a low-power memory controller exposing hundreds of MB at up to 1.6Gbps to the host core, a fully-programmable parallel RV32 cluster providing SoA software performance for IoT, while keeping the overall power envelope within 200200200mW. The structure of this manuscript is as follows: in Section II, we will present an overview of the State-of-the-Art SoC for UAVs. Following this, Sections III and IV will delve into an exhaustive discussion of Shaheen‚Äôs architecture, its implementation, and the measurements obtained from the silicon prototype. Moving forward, Sections V and VI will address the software stack and provide a benchmark of the cluster‚Äôs performance and energy efficiency on a relevant set of applications for nano-UAVs. In Section VII, we will compare Shaheen with similar silicon prototypes from both industry and academia. Finally, Section VIII will summarize our results and offer insights into potential future research directions.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: environment.\nNano-UAVs have a form factor of a few centimeters in diameter, and a weight of only tens of grams, which allows them to safely operate near humans and in narrow, cramped spaces¬†[ref]2 .\nThey have a total power envelope of a few Watts, of which only 5-15% for computation¬†, and their small physical footprint and limited payload restrain the maximum battery, the printed\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
