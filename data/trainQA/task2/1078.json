      "content": "Paper Title: Metapath and Entity-Aware Graph Neural Network for Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIntegrating content information for user preference prediction remains a challenging task in the development of recommender systems. In spite of their effectiveness, most collaborative filtering (CF) methods     still suffer from the incapability of modeling content information such as user profiles and item features  .\nSeveral methods have been proposed to address this problem.\nMost of them fall in these two categories: factorization and graph-based methods.\nFactorization methods such as factorization machine (FM) , neural factorization machine (NFM)  and Wide&Deep models  fuse numerical features of each individual training sample.\nThese methods yield competitive performance on several datasets.\nHowever, they neglect the dependencies among the content information.\nGraph-based methods such as NGCF 7, KGAT , KGCN , Multi-GCCF and LGC  represent recommender systems with graph structured data and exploit the graph structure to enhance the node-level representations for better recommendation performance  7  1. It is to be noted that learning\nsuch node-level representations loses the correspondences and interactions between the content information of users and items.\nThis is because the node embeddings are learned independently as indicated by Zhang et al. .\nAnother disadvantage of previous GNN-based methods is that the sequential nature of connectivity relations are either ignored (Knowledge Graph based methods) or mixed up (GNN-based methods) without the explicit modelling of multi-hop structure. A natural solution of capturing the inter- and intra-relations between content features and user-item pairs is to explore the high-order information encoded by metapaths  [ref]43.\nA metapath denotes a set of composite relations designed for representing multi-hop structure and sequential semantics.\nTo our best knowledge, only a limited number of efforts have been made to enhance GNNs with metapaths.\nA prominent metapath based method is MAGNN [ref]10: it aggregates intra-metapath information for each path instance.\nAs a consequence, MAGNN suffers from high memory consumption problem.\nMEIRec  utilizes the structural information in metapaths to improve the node-level representation for intent recommendation, but the method fails to generalize when no user intent or query is available. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose MetaPath- and Entity-Aware Graph Neural Network (PEAGNN), a unified GNN framework, which aggregates information over multiple metapath-aware subgraphs and fuse the aggregated information to obtain node representation using attention mechanism.\nAs a first step, we extract an h‚Ñéh-hop enclosing collaborative subgraph (CSG). Each CSG is centered at a user-item pair and aimed to suppress the influence of feature nodes from other user-item interactions.\nSuch local subgraphs contain rich\nsemantic and collaborative information of user-item interactions.\nOne major difference between the CSGs in our work and the subgraphs proposed by Zhang et al.\n is that in the subgraphs in their work neglect side information by excluding all feature entity nodes. As a second step, the CSG is decomposed into Œ≥ùõæ\\gamma metapath-aware subgraphs based on the schema of the selected metapaths.\nAfter that, PEAGNN updates the node representation of the given CSG and outputs a CSG graph-level representation, which distills the collective user-item pattern and sequential semantics encoded in the CSG.\nA multi-layer perceptron is then trained to predict the recommendation score of a user-item pair.\nTo further exploit the local structure of CSGs, we introduce entity-awareness, a contrastive regularizer which pushes the user and item nodes closer to the connected feature entity nodes, while simultaneously pushing them apart from the unconnected ones.\nPEAGNN learns by jointly minimizing Bayesian Personalized Rank (BPR) loss and entity-aware loss.\nFurthermore, PEAGNN can be easily combined with any graph convolution layers such as GAT, GCN and GraphSage. In contrast to existing metapath based approaches   [ref]10 4 [ref]43, PEAGNN avoids the high computational cost of explicit metapath reconstruction.\nThis is achieved by metapath-guided propagation. The information is propagated along the metapaths ‚Äúon the fly‚Äù. This is the primary reason of computational efficiency of PEAGNN as it gets rid of applying message passing on the recommendation graph.\nConsequently, the redundant information propagated from other interactions (subgraphs) is avoided by only performing metapath-guided propagation on individual metapath-aware subgraph. We discuss this in detail in Sec. 3. The contributions of our work are summarized\nas follows: We decouple the sequential semantics conveyed by metapaths into different metapath-aware subgraphs and propose PEAGNN, which explicitly propagates and aggregates multi-hop semantics on metapath-aware subgraphs. We fuse the aggregated information from metapath-aware subgraphs using attention to get representations. For a given CSG, we utilize the graph-level representation and predict the recommendation score of the target user-item pairs. We introduce entity-awareness that acts as a contrastive regularizer on the node embeddings during training. The empirical analysis on three public datasets demonstrate that PEAGNN outperforms other competitive baselines and is capable of learning meaningful metapath combinations.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: of multi-hop structure.
