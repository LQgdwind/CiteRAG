      "content": "Paper Title: Risk-Aware Transfer in Reinforcement Learning using Successor Features\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe physics simulator used for the reacher domain is provided by the open-source pybullet and pybullet-gym packages \\citepsuppcoumans2021,benelot2018. We adapted the Python environment in the latter package to handle multiple target goal locations as required in our problem setting. Please note that this package is released under the MIT license. The state space 𝒮⊂ℝ4𝒮superscriptℝ4\\mathcal{S}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{4} consists of the angles and angular velocities of the robotic arm’s two joints. The two-dimensional action space 𝒜⊂[−1,+1]2𝒜superscript112\\mathcal{A}\\subset[-1,+1]^{2} is discretized using 3 values per dimension, corresponding to maximum positive (+11+1) and negative (−11-1) and zero torque for each actuator, resulting in a total of 9 possible actions. At the beginning of each episode, the angle of the central joint is sampled from a uniform distribution on [−π,+π]𝜋𝜋[-\\pi,+\\pi], while the angle of the outer joint is sampled from a uniform distribution on [−π/2,+π/2]𝜋2𝜋2[-\\pi/2,+\\pi/2], and the angular velocities are initialized to zero. Furthermore, state transitions are made stochastic by adding zero-mean Gaussian noise to actions with standard deviation 0.030.030.03, and then clipping the actions to [−1,+1]11[-1,+1]. The reward received at each time step is 1−4​δ14𝛿1-4\\delta, where δ𝛿\\delta is the Euclidean distance between the target position and the tip of the robotic arm. We define 12 target locations, of which 4 are used for training and the remaining 8 for testing. Furthermore, circular regions of radius δf=0.06subscript𝛿𝑓0.06\\delta_{f}=0.06 are placed around 6 of the 12 target locations (2 training and 4 testing) in which failures occur spontaneously with probability pf=0.035subscript𝑝𝑓0.035p_{f}=0.035. Once a failure occurs, a cost of cf=3subscript𝑐𝑓3c_{f}=3 is incurred and the episode continues without termination. This implies that the expected reward, as a function of the distance δ𝛿\\delta, is777The reasoning here has simplified some of the aspects of the environment, ignoring the effects of multiple risk regions that could alter the trajectories, limited-length episodes and discounting. Therefore, a rational888Of course, a rational agent would want to keep the tip as close to the target location as possible, and so would want δ=0𝛿0\\delta=0. risk-neutral agent would prefer to enter inside the failure region if it holds that 1−cf×pf≥1−4​δf1subscript𝑐𝑓subscript𝑝𝑓14subscript𝛿𝑓1-c_{f}\\times p_{f}\\geq 1-4\\delta_{f}, or in other words if Clearly, given our choice of values for cf,pfsubscript𝑐𝑓subscript𝑝𝑓c_{f},p_{f} and δfsubscript𝛿𝑓\\delta_{f}, the above condition holds in our setting. Setting up the reward structure and risk in this way makes it possible to control the trade-off between risk and reward, and thus the anticipated behavior of the agents, in a principled way. We also apply discounting of future reward using γ=0.9𝛾0.9\\gamma=0.9. The state features are vectors ϕ​(s,a,s′)∈ℝ13bold-italic-ϕ𝑠𝑎superscript𝑠′superscriptℝ13\\bm{\\phi}(s,a,s^{\\prime})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{13}, in which the first 12 components consist of 1−4​δg14subscript𝛿𝑔1-4\\delta_{g}, where δgsubscript𝛿𝑔\\delta_{g} are the Euclidean distances to each of the goal locations g𝑔g. The last component takes the value 1 if a failure event occurs and 0 otherwise. As done in the four-room experiment, state features are provided to the agent. However, target goal locations 𝐰∈ℝ13𝐰superscriptℝ13\\mathbf{w}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{13} are not learned in this instance, but provided directly to the agent as well. Specifically, we set 𝐰g=1subscript𝐰𝑔1\\mathbf{w}_{g}=1 for the goal with index g𝑔g and 𝐰13=cf=−3subscript𝐰13subscript𝑐𝑓3\\mathbf{w}_{13}=c_{f}=-3, and set all other elements to zero. This recovers the correct reward function r​(s,a,s′)𝑟𝑠𝑎superscript𝑠′r(s,a,s^{\\prime}) for all task instances as described above. The overall training and testing procedures closely mimic Barreto et al. . The successor features 𝝍πsuperscript𝝍𝜋\\bm{\\psi}^{\\pi} and their distribution 𝚿πsuperscript𝚿𝜋\\bm{\\Psi}^{\\pi} are represented as multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) with two hidden layers of size 256 and tanhtanh\\mathrm{tanh} non-linearities. The SFC51 and RaSFC51 architectures are generally identical and require output layers of dimensions ℝ9×51×13superscriptℝ95113\\mathbb{R}^{9\\times 51\\times 13}, with a softmaxsoftmax\\mathrm{softmax} activation function applied with respect to the second dimension. Similarly, C51 and RaC51 also require output layers but of dimensions ℝ9×51superscriptℝ951\\mathbb{R}^{9\\times 51} and softmaxsoftmax\\mathrm{softmax} applied with respect to the second dimension. For SFDQN, the output of the network is linear with dimensions ℝ9×13superscriptℝ913\\mathbb{R}^{9\\times 13}. We also use target networks for both SFC51/RaSFC51 and C51/RaC51, which are updated every 1,00010001,\\!000 transitions by copying weights from the learning networks. For SFC51, RaSFC51 and SFDQN, separate MLPs are used to learn each policy. To allow C51 and RaC51 to generalize across target locations, we apply universal value function approximation  and incorporate the target position into the state. This makes C51 essentially identical to the DQN baseline in Barreto et al. , except that DQN is replaced by C51. For C51-based agents, recall that the range of possible values of ϕbold-italic-ϕ\\bm{\\phi} must also be specified. For SFC51 and RaSFC51, we use ϕm​i​nd=−1superscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑑1\\phi_{min}^{d}=-1 and ϕm​a​xd=1superscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑑1\\phi_{max}^{d}=1 for d=1,2​…​12𝑑12…12d=1,2\\dots 12 and use ϕm​i​n13=0superscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑚𝑖𝑛130\\phi_{min}^{13}=0 and ϕm​a​x13=1superscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑚𝑎𝑥131\\phi_{max}^{13}=1, which corresponds to a relatively tight bound for state features described in the previous paragraph. For C51 and RaC51, we set the bounds to Vm​i​n=−30subscript𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛30V_{min}=-30 and Vm​a​x=10subscript𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥10V_{max}=10, which corresponds to a tight bound for the discounted return. These intervals are discretized into N=51𝑁51N=51 atoms for learning histograms, as recommended in the original paper [ref]6. Agents are trained on all 4 training task instances sequentially one at a time, for 200,000200000200,\\!000 time steps per task using an epsilon-greedy policy with ε=0.1𝜀0.1\\varepsilon=0.1. Analogous to Barreto et al. , every sample is used to train all 4 policies simultaneously for SFC51, RaSFC51 and SFDQN. A randomized replay buffer of infinite capacity stores all previously-observed transitions (s,a,ϕ,s′)𝑠𝑎bold-italic-ϕsuperscript𝑠′(s,a,\\bm{\\phi},s^{\\prime}) from all 4 training tasks, to avoid “catastrophic forgetting\" of previously learned task instances. Each update of the network is based on a mini-batch of size 32 sampled uniformly from the replay buffer, and uses the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10−3superscript10310^{-3}. Please note that these parameters, and those in the previous paragraph, are generally identical to those used in Barreto et al. . Testing follows an epsilon-greedy policy with ε=0.03𝜀0.03\\varepsilon=0.03 and greedy actions are selected according to risk-aware GPI, e.g. a∗∈arg​maxa⁡maxi∈{1,…​4}⁡{𝝍~πi​(s,a)⊺​𝐰j+β​𝐰j⊺​Σ~πi​(s,a)​𝐰j}superscript𝑎subscriptargmax𝑎subscript𝑖1…4superscriptbold-~𝝍subscript𝜋𝑖superscript𝑠𝑎⊺subscript𝐰𝑗𝛽superscriptsubscript𝐰𝑗⊺superscript~Σsubscript𝜋𝑖𝑠𝑎subscript𝐰𝑗a^{*}\\in\\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{a}\\max_{i\\in\\{1,\\dots 4\\}}\\{{\\bm{\\tilde{\\psi}}^{\\pi_{i}}(s,a)}^{\\intercal}\\mathbf{w}_{j}+\\beta{\\mathbf{w}_{j}}^{\\intercal}\\tilde{\\Sigma}^{\\pi_{i}}(s,a)\\mathbf{w}_{j}\\}. Recall that test rewards 𝐰jsubscript𝐰𝑗\\mathbf{w}_{j} are provided to the agent. We set the episode length to T=500𝑇500T=500 time steps for training and testing. All visualizations are based on estimating the test return at regular intervals of 5,00050005,\\!000 time steps, calculated as the average performance of 5 independent rollouts. Since the performance varies for different target locations, Barreto et al.  applies a normalization procedure to compare the performance between tasks in a fair manner. We apply the same procedure, by first training a standard C51 agent from scratch on each training and test task 10 times, and recording the average performance at the beginning and end of training, G¯bsubscript¯𝐺𝑏\\bar{G}_{b} and G¯asubscript¯𝐺𝑎\\bar{G}_{a}, respectively. The normalized return illustrated in all figures is then calculated as Gn=(G−G¯b)/(G¯a−G¯b)subscript𝐺𝑛𝐺subscript¯𝐺𝑏subscript¯𝐺𝑎subscript¯𝐺𝑏G_{n}=(G-\\bar{G}_{b})/(\\bar{G}_{a}-\\bar{G}_{b}).\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: which corresponds to a tight bound for the discounted return.
