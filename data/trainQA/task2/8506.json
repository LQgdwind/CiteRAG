      "content": "Paper Title: 1 Introduction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nGraph database models were compared with other database models (Network, Relational, Semantic, Object-Oriented, Semi structured) by  to distinguish their applications and characteristics (abstraction level, base data structure, and information focus). The relational database model introduced a separation between the physical and logical levels (abstraction levels), gave a mathematical foundation to the data modeling discipline and introduced a standard query and transformation language, SQL. But its data structure (relations) has to be known in advance and its fixed schema makes for difficult extensions or remodelings. The SQL language was not designed to explore the underlying graph of relationships among the data, such as paths, neighborhoods, patterns. This makes querying graph data stored in a regular RDBMS expensive because of complex join operations and index lookups[1, §2.4, footnote 36]; this contrasts with how easy it is to embed graphs in the relational model. In user abstraction level, database designers using semantic database models like entity-relationship model can represent objects and their relations naturally using conceptual abstractions such as aggregation, instantiation, and hierarchies. These types of models, whose information focus is in schemas plus relations, were important for graph model research, whose information focus is in the data plus relations, disabledisabletodo: disableI’d rephrase this; semantic databases xx aqui é modelo de banco de dados e não sistema banco de dados, modelo como o EER é semantico xx are not the only ones whose focus is on data relationships (plus, isn’t it weird to say that a database focuses on data?) since it reasons about the underlying graph structure presented in the relationships among the modeled entities. Semi structured models like XML have an ordered-tree-like structure, which is a restricted type of graph. The authors also compared graph database model proposals found in the literature, from 1984 until 2002, using a theoretical perspective in terms of modeling aspects: data structures, query languages and integrity constraints. A common issue among the proposals is the level of separation between schema and instances and, in most cases, they are clearly distinguished. An evaluation of the graph models with a more practical perspective can be found in . In this study, the authors distinguish graph stores from graph databases. For them, graph stores are implementations that provide basic facilities for storing and querying graphs whilst graph database must offer advanced features like a query optimizer and backups, as database management systems do.  compares six NoSQL graph databases, AllegroGraph, DEX, HypergraphDB, InfiniteGraph, Neo4J and Sones, and three graph stores, Filament, G-Store and vertexDB, concentrating on their data model features in terms of the same modeling aspects. Compared with mature databases, like relational databases that uses SQL, the authors observed that there is a lack of query language standardization for graph databases and the main development focus is to provide APIs for popular programming languages. He also stated that integrity constraints, like type checking, are poorly studied in graph databases and, although the support for schema evolution is a common justification for this absence, data consistency in a database might be equal to or even more important than flexibility. Besides, this article defined a set of essential graph queries: adjacency (Node/edge adjacency and k-neighborhood), reachability (Fixed-length paths, Regular simple paths and, Shortest path), pattern matching and summarization. Analyzed the support of the selected NoSQL databases to answer such queries, he observed that none of the systems provides k-neighborhood nor summarization out-of-the-box. An approach to NoSQL graph databases design given its customary schemalessness is proposed in [ref]19. They affirm that although schemalessness is considered an advantage of NoSQL databases, query optimization and data integrity are best performed in the presence of schemas. Although we are inclined to agree with this statement, we found [ref]19’s argumentation lacking, nor did they seem to provide references to support this view. Their methodology takes into account the four V’s of big data: volume (data quantity), variety (many different types of data), velocity (the speed that data is made available and accessible999NB: not the speed at which it is produced), and veracity (different levels of data inconsistency and incompleteness). The forward engineering approach proposed in [ref]19 is based on model-driven architecture (MDA) to guide the development of conceptual, logical, and physical models with the support of a set of transformations rules, to move from one level to another, and two meta-models: V’s EER conceptual meta-model and EER logical property graph meta-model. The logical model generated by their method propagates the four V’s data inputted by the user, so that the physical models can be generated according to their specification. This allows the creation of dummy databases that follow the data model and that have realistic 4 V’s parameters, which can be very useful to benchmark a data store for a prospective use case.  compares several NoSQL databases across 7 dimensions (Persistence, Replication, Sharding, Consistency, API, Query Method, and Implementation Language). The comparison aims to assist in the choice of which one is the most appropriate for a given set of requirements. In the Graph-oriented databases group, the selected databases were: Neo4J, Infinite-Graph, InfoGrid, HyperGraph, AllegroGraph, and BigData. The authors mention that Neo4J, instead of Allegro Graph, uses SPARQL for querying data stored in RDF format and Gremlin to graph traversal over graphs stored in various formats[16, §7]; this is factually wrong: Neo4j uses the Cypher query language for declarative queries, and offers a Java API for imperative graph manipulation. With respect to the CAP theorem, Neo4J and Allegro Graph were considered to compromise some consistency in exchange for AP (Availability-Partition Tolerance). Neo4j supports limited causal consistency (see section 4.4), and both stores support eventual consistency.  analyses five NoSQL databases, of which two are multi-model (OrientDB and ArangoDB) and three are graph models (AllegroGraph, InfiniteGraph and Neo4J). They compared graph databases across what they take to be the most important features of a graph database: the flexibility of their schemas (the ability to add new type of vertices and edges without impact in the previously stored data)disabledisabletodo: disableit would be nice to reference here where we define this, the query language they use (which one suits best the needs of querying graph data)disabledisabletodo: disableany query language?, their sharding support, how they backup their data, their support of multiple data models, how well they scale and how easy it is to deploy them to the cloud. Supporting multiple data models was defined by the authors as the capability of the graph database to store unstructured data, and to visualize data relationships in the form of graphs, key-value pairs, documents or tables. Each NoSQL feature was graded in a scale from 0 to 4, for a total of 36 points, based on the authors’ experience (subjective analysis) and a literature review. By this analysis, they concluded that Neo4J and ArangoDB stand out for their functionalities, both achieving a 26 points score. However, they recommend Neo4J over ArangoDB because of its enhanced implemented features although it did not support sharding at the time. 101010Neo4j supports (manual) sharding since version 4, see https://neo4j.com/release-notes/neo4j-4-0-0/ In  the authors broadened the study to any database system that enables storing and processing graphs, in other words, graph database systems. They included native graph databases and other types of databases with different data models that do not target specifically graphs but are used in various systems to model and store graphs. Some systems are simple graph frontends to other kinds of storage management systems (non-native), while others are custom-built for the purpose of storing and managing graphs (native). Implementations also differ in what kinds of graphs they work with. disable,author=brunodisable,author=brunotodo: disable,author=brunoshould probably refer to what we’ve written already or scrap this part, since it’s repetitive While graph theory gives us different models for graphs, which can be undirected, directed, labeled, attributed, multigraphs, and hypergraphs (among others), engineering practice gives us two common graph models: RDF and property graphs. Graph stores may also differ in how they organize the data they hold, specially in which kind of graph representation they use (usually a variation of adjacency matrices, adjacency lists, or edge lists). Other differences lie in the query language used (there is no standard language for graph querying), in how queries may be executed (can they be run concurrently? Can they be parallelized?), how data is partitioned (or not) among nodes, and in how transactions are supported (how ACID-compliant they are? Are they run online or offline?) The selected 45 graph database systems were grouped in 9 categories (RDF store/Triple Store, Tuple store, Document store, Key-value store, Wide-column store, RDBMS, OODBMS, Native graph store/databases, and Data hub) based on their general database engine and analyzed in 5 key dimensions (data model, data organization, data distribution, query execution, and type of transactions). AllegroGraph was classified as a RDF Store/Triple Store, since the main data model used is RDF triples. Neo4j was classified as Native Graph Database, since LPG (Labeled Property Graph) is the main data model used.disable,author=bruno:disable,author=bruno:todo: disable,author=bruno:the model could be LPG and the database could not be native, these things are orthogonal The authors used a different definition for graph databases/stores: systems that were specifically build to maintain and process graphs. In this survey, OrientDB and ArangoDB were classified as Document Stores with Multi-Model support (LPG and RDF) and Oracle Spatial and Graph was classified as Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) that also has Multi-Model support using a row-oriented storage.\n\nReference markers found: [19]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]19: queries, he observed that none of the systems provides k-neighborhood nor summarization out-of-the-box.
