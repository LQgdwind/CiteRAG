      "content": "Paper Title: Counting Subgraphs in Degenerate Graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSubgraph counting refers to the algorithmic task of computing the number of copies (i.e., occurences) of a given graph HùêªH in an input graph Gùê∫G.\nDue to its fundamental nature, this problem has been studied extensively, both from a theoretical perspective and for practical applications.\nIn practice, subgraph counts are widely used to analyze real-world graphs, such as graphs representing telecommunication networks, biological structures and social interactions. Consequently, subgraph counts feature prominently in studies of biological    and sociological   networks, as well as in the network science literature in general      .\nFor example,  observed that networks coming from different areas of science (such as biochemistry, neurobiology, ecology, and engineering) have significantly different counts of small subgraphs.\nSuch frequently occuring subgraphs are called motifs, and, quoting , ‚Äúmay uncover the basic building blocks of most networks‚Äù.\nNeedless to say, some real-world graphs can be very large ‚Äì having billions of vertices ‚Äì thus making it all the more desirable to have fast subgraph counting algorithms. In theoretical computer science, subgraph counting and detection111The HùêªH-detection problem is the problem of deciding whether an input graph contains a copy of HùêªH. are fundamental and widely-studied problems. Much of the research focused on counting special kinds of graphs, such as cliques    ; cycles   ; paths and matchings (and other graphs with bounded pathwidth)  [ref]9; graphs with bounded vertex-cover number 9  2 . Many of the algorithms use fast matrix multiplication    2 . For example, the best known algorithm for counting kùëòk-cliques  runs in time\nnœâ‚Äãk/3+O‚Äã(1)superscriptùëõùúîùëò3ùëÇ1n^{\\omega k/3+O(1)}, where œâ<2.373ùúî2.373\\omega<2.373 is the matrix multiplication constant . On the negative side, kùëòk-clique counting is the canonical #‚ÄãW‚Äã#Wdelimited-[]1\\#\\text{W}-hard problem, and it is thus unlikely that there exists an algorithm which solves this problem in time f‚Äã(k)‚ãÖno‚Äã(k)‚ãÖùëìùëòsuperscriptùëõùëúùëòf(k)\\cdot n^{o(k)} (for any function fùëìf).\nWe refer the reader to 0 for further references on both theoretical and practical aspects of subgraph counting. Subgraph counts also play a fundamental role in extremal graph theory, where subgraph densities are the basic notion used for studying sequences of dense graphs 3. In particular, knowing approximate subgraph counts of small graphs inside a given graph Gùê∫G allows one to decide whether Gùê∫G is quasirandom 8 or, more generally, whether Gùê∫G consists of a bounded number of quasirandom pieces with prescribed edge densities 4. Given the importance of the subgraph counting problem on the one hand, and its hardness in general graphs on the other, it is natural to consider special classes of graphs which admit faster counting algorithms, while also being rich enough to include many of the real-world graphs mentioned above. One prime example of such a family of graph classes is classes having bounded degeneracy. Recall that a graph Gùê∫G is Œ∫ùúÖ\\kappa-degenerate222We note that degeneracy is closely related to another well-studied graph parameter, namely arboricity, which is the minimum number of forests into which the edge-set of a graph can be partitioned. It is well-known that the arboricity of a Œ∫ùúÖ\\kappa-degenerate graph is between (Œ∫+1)/2ùúÖ12(\\kappa+1)/2 and Œ∫ùúÖ\\kappa. if there is an ordering v1,‚Ä¶,vnsubscriptùë£1‚Ä¶subscriptùë£ùëõv_{1},\\dots,v_{n} of the vertices of Gùê∫G such that visubscriptùë£ùëñv_{i} has at most Œ∫ùúÖ\\kappa neighbours in {vi+1,‚Ä¶,vn}subscriptùë£ùëñ1‚Ä¶subscriptùë£ùëõ\\{v_{i+1},\\dots,v_{n}\\} (for each 1‚â§i‚â§n1ùëñùëõ1\\leq i\\leq n). We say that a class of graphs has bounded degeneracy if there is an integer Œ∫ùúÖ\\kappa such that all graphs in the class are Œ∫ùúÖ\\kappa-degenerate.\nWith a slight abuse of terminology, we will refer to graphs belonging to such classes as having bounded-degeneracy or being O‚Äã(1)ùëÇ1O(1)-degenerate. There are many examples of well-studied graph classes having bounded degeneracy. These include all minor-closed classes (including planar graphs and, more generally, graphs embeddable into a given surface), preferential attachment graphs , and bounded expansion graphs 9. The first result on subgraph counting in bounded-degeneracy graphs is probably the classical result of Chiba and Nishizeki 7, who showed that in Œ∫ùúÖ\\kappa-degenerate graphs, one can count rùëür-cliques in time O‚Äã(n‚ÄãŒ∫r‚àí2)ùëÇùëõsuperscriptùúÖùëü2O(n\\kappa^{r-2}) (for each r‚â•3ùëü3r\\geq 3), and 444-cycles in time O‚Äã(n‚ÄãŒ∫)ùëÇùëõùúÖO(n\\kappa).\nBera, Pashanasangi and Seshadhri 0 recently extended this result, by showing that the HùêªH-counting problem in bounded-degeneracy graphs can be solved in time O‚Äã(n)ùëÇùëõO(n) for every graph HùêªH on at most 555 vertices (here, the implicit constant in the big-OùëÇO notation depends on the degeneracy Œ∫ùúÖ\\kappa). They further showed that under a certain widely-believed hardness assumption in fine-grained complexity, the problem of counting 666-cycles cannot be solved in linear time in bounded-degeneracy graphs. (They also proved a similar result for all longer cycles, with the exception of the cycle of length 888.)\nThe hardness assumption used asserts that detecting a triangle in a (general) graph with mùëöm edges requires significantly more than O‚Äã(m)ùëÇùëöO(m) time.\nThis assumption will also serve as the foundation for our complexity-theoretic hardness results, and we state it here as follows. We refer the reader to , where Conjecture 1.1 was first formulated, for a detailed overview of the conjecture and its relations to many other computational problems. There exists Œ≥>0ùõæ0\\gamma>0 such that in the word RAM model of O‚Äã(log‚Å°n)ùëÇùëõO(\\log n) bits, any algorithm to decide whether an input graph with nùëõn vertices and mùëöm edges is triangle-free requires Œ©‚Äã(m1+Œ≥)Œ©superscriptùëö1ùõæ\\Omega(m^{1+\\gamma}) time in expectation. It is believed that the constant Œ≥ùõæ\\gamma in Conjecture 1.1 could be as large as 1/3131/3. The reason for this is that the best known algorithm for triangle detection  runs in time\nO‚Äã(min‚Å°(nœâ,m2‚Äãœâ/(œâ+1)))ùëÇsuperscriptùëõùúîsuperscriptùëö2ùúîùúî1O\\big{(}\\min\\big{(}n^{\\omega},m^{2\\omega/(\\omega+1)}\\big{)}\\big{)}, where œâùúî\\omega is the matrix multiplication constant. If œâ=2ùúî2\\omega=2 (which would be optimal), then the running time of this algorithm is\nO‚Äã(min‚Å°(n2,m4/3))ùëÇsuperscriptùëõ2superscriptùëö43O\\big{(}\\min\\big{(}n^{2},m^{4/3}\\big{)}\\big{)}. Having established both positive and negative results,\nBera, Pashanasangi and Seshadhri 0 asked whether one can characterize all graphs HùêªH for which the HùêªH-counting problem can be solved in linear time in bounded-degeneracy graphs.\nBefore proceeding to our resolution of this question, let us recall some definitions\nand introduce some notation.\n Let G,Hùê∫ùêªG,H be graphs. A map œÜ:V‚Äã(H)‚ÜíV‚Äã(G):ùúë‚Üíùëâùêªùëâùê∫\\varphi:V(H)\\rightarrow V(G) is a homomorphism if {œÜ‚Äã(u),œÜ‚Äã(v)}‚ààE‚Äã(G)ùúëùë¢ùúëùë£ùê∏ùê∫\\{\\varphi(u),\\varphi(v)\\}\\in E(G) for every {u,v}‚ààE‚Äã(H)ùë¢ùë£ùê∏ùêª\\{u,v\\}\\in E(H); an injective homomorphism if it is a homomorphism and a one-to-one function; an isomorphism if it is an injective homomorphism and {œÜ‚Äã(u),œÜ‚Äã(v)}‚àâE‚Äã(G)ùúëùë¢ùúëùë£ùê∏ùê∫\\{\\varphi(u),\\varphi(v)\\}\\notin E(G) if {u,v}‚àâE‚Äã(H)ùë¢ùë£ùê∏ùêª\\{u,v\\}\\notin E(H). Let G,Hùê∫ùêªG,H be graphs. Following 3, we denote by hom‚Å°(H,G)homùêªùê∫\\hom(H,G) the number of homomorphisms\nfrom HùêªH to Gùê∫G, by inj‚Äã(H,G)injùêªùê∫\\mathrm{inj}(H,G) the number of injective homomorphisms (i.e., embeddings) from HùêªH to Gùê∫G, and by ind‚Äã(H,G)indùêªùê∫\\mathrm{ind}(H,G) the number of isomorphisms from HùêªH to (induced subgraphs of) Gùê∫G.\nFor a graph HùêªH, we denote by hom-cntHsubscripthom-cntùêª\\textsc{hom-cnt}_{H} the problem of computing hom‚Å°(H,G)homùêªùê∫\\hom(H,G) for a given input graph Gùê∫G. The problems inj-cntHsubscriptinj-cntùêª\\textsc{inj-cnt}_{H} and ind-cntHsubscriptind-cntùêª\\textsc{ind-cnt}_{H} are defined analogously.\nIn what follows, we say that hom-cntH/inj-cntH/ind-cntHsubscripthom-cntùêªsubscriptinj-cntùêªsubscriptind-cntùêª\\textsc{hom-cnt}_{H}/\\textsc{inj-cnt}_{H}/\\textsc{ind-cnt}_{H} is easy if it can be solved in time f‚Äã(Œ∫,H)‚ãÖO~‚Äã(n)‚ãÖùëìùúÖùêª~ùëÇùëõf(\\kappa,H)\\cdot\\tilde{O}(n) in nùëõn-vertex graphs of degeneracy Œ∫ùúÖ\\kappa (for some function fùëìf); and otherwise we say that it is hard. We will usually avoid mentioning the function fùëìf, and just speak of running time O~‚Äã(n)~ùëÇùëõ\\tilde{O}(n), namely (nearly) linear time, with the implicit constant in the big-O~~ùëÇ\\tilde{O} notation allowed to depend on Œ∫ùúÖ\\kappa and HùêªH.\nThe following is the main open problem raised in 0. Characterize the graphs HùêªH for which inj-cntHsubscriptinj-cntùêª\\textsc{inj-cnt}_{H} is easy. In this paper, we completely resolve Problem 1.3 by giving a very clean characterization of the graphs HùêªH for which inj-cntHsubscriptinj-cntùêª\\textsc{inj-cnt}_{H} is easy.\nWe will also solve the related problems of characterizing the graphs HùêªH for which hom-cntHsubscripthom-cntùêª\\textsc{hom-cnt}_{H} is easy and the graphs HùêªH for which ind-cntHsubscriptind-cntùêª\\textsc{ind-cnt}_{H} is easy. It will turn out to be more convenient to first deal with the problem of obtaining a characterization for hom-cntHsubscripthom-cntùêª\\textsc{hom-cnt}_{H}.\nThis characterization, discussed in Section 1.2, constitutes the main result of this paper. In Section 1.3 we describe how the solution\nof Problem 1.3 regarding inj-cntHsubscriptinj-cntùêª\\textsc{inj-cnt}_{H} can be derived from our result regarding hom-cntHsubscripthom-cntùêª\\textsc{hom-cnt}_{H}. Then, in Section 1.4, we describe how a characterization for ind-cntHsubscriptind-cntùêª\\textsc{ind-cnt}_{H} can be derived from the one for inj-cntHsubscriptinj-cntùêª\\textsc{inj-cnt}_{H}. This approach ‚Äì of relating homomorphisms to copies and copies to induced copies ‚Äì was pioneered in 9 and 6, and is based on the framework developed in 3.\nFinally, in Section 1.5 we briefly consider subgraph-counting in general (i.e., not necessarily degenerate) graphs. By applying the methods used for proving Theorem 1, we\nshow that for a graph HùêªH, hom‚Å°(H,G)homùêªùê∫\\hom(H,G) can be computed in time O~‚Äã(|V‚Äã(G)|+|E‚Äã(G)|)~ùëÇùëâùê∫ùê∏ùê∫\\tilde{O}(|V(G)|+|E(G)|) in general graphs if and only if HùêªH is a forest (again, the ‚Äúonly-if‚Äù direction assumes Conjecture 1.1).\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: and widely-studied problems.
