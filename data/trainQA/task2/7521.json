      "content": "Paper Title: The Seeker’s Dilemma: Realistic Formulation and Benchmarking for Hardware Trojan Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSince HTs became a research interest, researchers have proposed various ideas to insert HTs in circuits. The benefit of having an inclusive HT benchmark is closely associated with developing robust HT detection methods and tools to thwart their impact. The first version of such attempts was available at Trusthub 1 , where several HT designs are available to study. Despite their valuable contribution to the HT research community, the benchmark lacks the size and variety needed to push the detection field forward  2 [ref]11. In particular, the problem is exacerbated when developing ML-based HT detectors. Such detectors need significant data (various HT-infected and HT-free circuits) to provide fair and unbiased results. An important problem observed in this space is the imbalance between HT-infected circuits versus HT-free ones, which negatively impacts the quality of the training data 3. Subsequently, trained detectors can be biased towards favoring circuits as HT-infected, as we will see later in Section VII-B. Trusthub benchmark contains log files that clearly explain the location and functionality of inserted HTs. To tackle Trusthub HT benchmarks shortcomings, various research endeavors have been made. Cruz  et al.  presented a tool that inserts HTs in design netlists with configurable parameters such as the number of HT trigger nets, rare-net thresholds, number of HT instances, activation methods, types, and payloads. This work uses signal probability for HT triggers. The benchmark set generated by this tool is available on Trust-Hub . Yu et al. 4 proposed a similar tool that uses transition probability to identify rare nets, defined as the time required for the value of each net to toggle, and it is modeled using geometric distribution. This work suffers from the same shortcomings as , where there is a single HT insertion strategy. We are curious if the generated benchmarks are available for download. Gohil et al. [ref]11 proposed an RL-based platform for HT insertion called ATTRITION. The authors assume reverse-engineering capabilities for the attacker to construct HT triggers where the target is signal probability. The agent’s objective is to identify a set of “compatible” rare nets, i.e., a group of rare nets that can be activated together by the same input test vector generated by a SAT-solver. The generated benchmarks have a structural format very similar to Trusthub’s. Liakos et al. 3 employed GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) to replicate the characteristics of HT-free and HT-infected circuits characteristics, such as structural, power, and timing features. The study utilizes a feature generative approach with GANs to generate synthetic data for training more effective HT detectors. Despite its novelty, the tool heavily depends on Trusthub and only reproduces data patterns similar to Trusthub, lacking the introduction of new functional dimensions. Sarihi et al. 2 uses RL to develop a tunable HT insertion tool that inserts HTs in design netlists. Netlists are first converted to graphs, and an RL agent interacts with the circuit environment through various actions that allow the agent to move the trigger inputs throughout the ISCAS-85 circuits, exploring various potential locations suitable for HT embedding. Trigger selection is based on a combination of SCOAP parameters. The benchmark follows a structural Verilog format. Despite the insertion flexibility, the benchmark was not tested against any HT detection techniques.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: several HT designs are available to study.
