      "content": "Paper Title: DisenHCN: Disentangled Hypergraph Convolutional Networks for Spatiotemporal Activity Prediction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nOver the past decades, the mobile Internet has dramatically changed the way people behave in daily life. People rely on their mobile Apps to perform daily activities and generate massive User Spatio-Temporal Activitiess (USTA) data, such as Twitter messages and App usage records, illustrated in Fig. 1(a). These USTA data are generally associated with user IDs, geographic information, and posting time, offering an excellent opportunity to accurately predict users’ spatiotemporal activities [ref]1. Under this circumstance, spatiotemporal activity prediction is widely recognized as a fundamental task for applications like urban\nplanning      and mobile advertising      [ref]12. Formally, the task of spatiotemporal activity prediction is defined to predict the specific activity of a user at a given time and location.\nEarly classical tensor-based methods     approached this task as a tensor-decomposition problem by representing USTA data as a four-dimensional tensor.\nHowever, these methods suffer from the limitation of small model capacity. To address it, graph-based models    were proposed, in which location, time, and activity are represented as three kinds of nodes while their relations are represented as heterogeneous edges. Although these graph-based methods have achieved more promising performance,\nthere are still unsolved critical challenges as follows. Fine-grained user similarities are ignored.\nThe user similarity (similarity of user preference) is one of the most important information concealed in USTA data, since predicting a user’s future behaviors requires collaborative learning of other users, similarly as collaborative filtering in recommender systems [ref]13 .\nThere are two major properties of user similarity that bring challenges to its modeling.\nFirst, user similarity has multiple types.\nFor example, two users visit the same location suggesting they may have similar location preferences, while two users have the same activity reflecting they may have similar tastes of activity.\nSecond, different types have different granularities. For example, two users with the same activity at one same location reveal they may have similar preferences of both location and activity, which is a finer-grained similarity compared with the example we mentioned above.\nHowever, existing works separately model time and location by roughly representing them as different types of nodes on the graph. User’s modeling is entangled.\nIn spatiotemporal activity prediction, user preferences focus on three aspects: location, time, and activity.\nIn other words, user behaviors are driven by these three factors simultaneously.\nThis property of multi-aspect preference distinguishes the task with\ntraditional user-modeling problems, such as collaborate filtering (CF) in recommender systems [ref]13 .\nHowever, existing methods uniformly embed users into one same embedding space,\nwhich is insufficient to model the multi-aspect preferences that driven user behaviors. On the other hand, from the perspective of preference matching,\nthere exist a kind of user-centered one-to-many interaction. However, existing methods can only handle one-to-one interactions and fail to model the one-to-many interactions. To address the above challenges,\nwe propose a novel method, Disentangled Hypergraph Convolutional Networks (DisenHCN).\nSpecifically, we first construct a heterogeneous hypergraph to encode the fine-grained user similarities and one-many complex matching between user and spatiotemporal activity.\nWe then project users to disentangled embeddings for decoupling preferences among location, time, and activity.\nEfficient hypergraph convolution layers are then proposed on the hypergraph for embedding learning.\nThe independence of disentangled user embeddings is ensured by an independence-modeling module. Our contributions can be summarized as follows. To the best of our knowledge,\nwe are the first to introduce\nheterogeneous hypergraph into the problem of spatiotemporal activity prediction.\nWe build multiple types of hyperedges, enabling the explicit modeling of the fine-grained user similarities.\n For the constructed heterogeneous hypergraph, we propose to disentangle user embeddings into several subspaces. We then propose efficient hypergraph convolution layers,\nincluding intra-type and inter-type aggregation on multi-type hyperedges,\nensuring the disentangled user embeddings can learn the corresponding preferences on three aspects, i.e.,\nlocation, time, and activity,\nsimultaneously. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world spatiotemporal activity datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model, significantly outperforming the existing state-of-the-art baselines by 14.23% to 18.10%. Further studies confirm the effectiveness of each designed component. The remainder of this paper is as follows. We first review the related works in Section II and provide some preliminaries in Section III. We then introduce our proposed method in Section IV and conduct experiments in Section V. Last we conclude this paper and discuss future works in Section VI.\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: Fig. 1(a).
