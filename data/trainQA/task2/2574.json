      "content": "Paper Title: Single Underwater Image Enhancement Using an Analysis-Synthesis Network\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor testing, we compare our method with seven state-of-the-art underwater image enhancement methods on both synthetic data Test-S2700 and five real underwater benchmarks, RUIE333The RUIE dataset contains 3930 real-world underwater images , SQUID444The SQUID dataset contains 57 real-world underwater images [ref]34, UIEB555The UIEB dataset contains 950 real-world underwater images , EUVP666The EUVP dataset contains 1910 real-world underwater images [ref]35 and UFO-120777The UFO-120 dataset contains 3255 real-world underwater images . The compared methods include traditional methods (Fusion , UIBLA  and HE-Prior ) and deep-learning methods (UGAN , FUIE-GAN [ref]35, Water-Net  and Ucolor [ref]20). For synthetic data Test-S2700, we retrain all deep-learning methods on Train-S6300 and evaluate them using the full-reference metrics Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity (SSIM). For PSNR, the higher scores mean the result is closer to the image content of the ground truth. For SSIM, the larger values denote that the result is more similar to the structure and texture of the ground truth. For five real underwater benchmarks, all competing methods are tested using the corresponding test models and parameters released by their authors. We employ the no-reference metrics UIQM and NIQE scores as references to compare the performance of different methods since these real underwater images do not have corresponding ground-truths. A higher UIQM or a lower NIQE score represents a better human visual perception. It should be pointed out that these scores do not accurately reflect the performance of various underwater enhancement methods in some cases  [ref]20. We also take a user study to more accurately score the performance of different methods on five real benchmarks, denoted as “Perceptual Scores”. Specifically, 12 participants having experience in image processing are invited to score enhanced results. Each participant has no time limitation and does not know the result produced by which method. The scores have 5 levels ranging from 1 to 5, indicating worst to best quality. In addition, we measure the color restoration accuracy on the 16 representative examples presented in the project page888http://csms.haifa.ac.il/profiles/tTreibitz/datasets/ambient_forwardlooking/\nindex.html of SQUID [ref]34 to evaluate the color accuracy of different methods.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: synthetic data Test-S2700 and five real underwater benchmarks, RUIE333The RUIE dataset contains 3930 real-world underwater images , SQUID444The SQUID dataset contains 57 real-world underwater images [ref]34, UIEB555The UIEB dataset contains 950 real-world underwater images , EUVP666The EUVP dataset contains 1910 real-world underwater images [ref]35 and UFO-120777The UFO-120 dataset contains 3255\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
