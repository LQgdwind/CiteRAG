      "content": "Paper Title: Fundamental Limitation of Semantic Communications: Neural Estimation for Rate-Distortion\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe consider a general semantic communication system, where the transmitter compresses the source data and then transmits it through a point-to-point discrete memoryless channel to the receiver for data recovery and processing specific semantic tasks. Here, a memoryless semantic source is modeled as a pair of random variables111X𝑋X and S𝑆S can be random vectors for the case that they are obtained from high-dimensional sources, e.g., text​​ and images​​. (X,S)𝑋𝑆(X,S) with a joint probability distribution (X,S)∼P(X,S)similar-to𝑋𝑆subscript𝑃𝑋𝑆(X,S)\\sim P_{(X,S)} supported on a finite product alphabet 𝒳×𝒮𝒳𝒮\\mathcal{X}\\times\\mathcal{S}, where X𝑋X represents the extrinsic observation of the source, S𝑆S is the intrinsic semantic state relevant to the considered semantic task, and 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X} and 𝒮𝒮\\mathcal{S} are the alphabets of X𝑋X and S𝑆S, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, an SSCC-based semantic communication framework over the discrete memoryless channel is considered in this paper. The transmitter sends a sequence of length-n𝑛n independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples of source pair (X,S)𝑋𝑆(X,S), denoted as (𝒙n,𝒔n)=(x1,⋯,xn,s1,⋯,sn)superscript𝒙𝑛superscript𝒔𝑛subscript𝑥1⋯subscript𝑥𝑛subscript𝑠1⋯subscript𝑠𝑛(\\bm{x}^{n},\\bm{s}^{n})=(x_{1},\\cdots,x_{n},s_{1},\\cdots,s_{n}).\nThe source encoder has access to observation sequence 𝒙nsuperscript𝒙𝑛\\bm{x}^{n}, whereas 𝒙nsuperscript𝒙𝑛\\bm{x}^{n} is related to semantic state sequence 𝒔nsuperscript𝒔𝑛\\bm{s}^{n} through a conditional probability P​(𝑿n=𝒙n|𝑺n=𝒔n)𝑃superscript𝑿𝑛conditionalsuperscript𝒙𝑛superscript𝑺𝑛superscript𝒔𝑛P(\\bm{X}^{n}=\\bm{x}^{n}|\\bm{S}^{n}=\\bm{s}^{n}). Then, 𝒙nsuperscript𝒙𝑛\\bm{x}^{n} is compressed by the source encoder into an index W∈{1,⋯,2n​Rs}𝑊1⋯superscript2𝑛subscript𝑅sW\\in\\{1,\\cdots,2^{nR_{\\text{s}}}\\}, with Rssubscript𝑅sR_{\\text{s}} being the compression rate. After that, W𝑊W is encoded by the channel encoder into a length-n𝑛n channel codeword 𝒙cnsuperscriptsubscript𝒙c𝑛\\bm{x}_{\\text{c}}^{n}.\nThen, 𝒙cnsuperscriptsubscript𝒙c𝑛\\bm{x}_{\\text{c}}^{n} is transmitted via the discrete memoryless channel, and 𝒙^cnsuperscriptsubscript^𝒙c𝑛\\hat{\\bm{x}}_{\\text{c}}^{n} is the received symbol sequence. At the receiver, the channel decoder decodes 𝒙^cnsuperscriptsubscript^𝒙c𝑛\\hat{\\bm{x}}_{\\text{c}}^{n} as an estimated index W^^𝑊\\hat{W}. Finally, the source decoder recovers the observation and semantic state sequences as 𝒙^n=(x^1,⋯,x^n)superscript^𝒙𝑛subscript^𝑥1⋯subscript^𝑥𝑛\\hat{\\bm{x}}^{n}=(\\hat{x}_{1},\\cdots,\\hat{x}_{n}) and 𝒔^n=(s^1,⋯,s^n)superscript^𝒔𝑛subscript^𝑠1⋯subscript^𝑠𝑛\\hat{\\bm{s}}^{n}=(\\hat{s}_{1},\\cdots,\\hat{s}_{n}), respectively. We denote reproduction observation and semantic states as X^^𝑋\\hat{X} and S^^𝑆\\hat{S}, respectively, taking values from alphabets 𝒳^^𝒳\\mathcal{\\hat{X}} and 𝒮^^𝒮\\mathcal{\\hat{S}}, respectively. Then, we define do:𝒳×𝒳^→[0,+∞):subscript𝑑o→𝒳^𝒳0d_{\\text{o}}:\\mathcal{X}\\times\\mathcal{\\hat{X}}\\to[0,+\\infty) as the single-letter observation distortion between observation state X𝑋X and its reproduction X^^𝑋\\hat{X}, and define ds:𝒮×𝒮^→[0,+∞):subscript𝑑s→𝒮^𝒮0d_{\\text{s}}:\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{\\hat{S}}\\to[0,+\\infty) as the single-letter semantic distortion between semantic state S𝑆S and its reproduction S^^𝑆\\hat{S}. Correspondingly, the block-wise observation and semantic distortion measures are defined as do​(𝒙n,𝒙^n)≜1n​∑i=1ndo​(xi,x^i)≜subscript𝑑osuperscript𝒙𝑛superscript^𝒙𝑛1𝑛superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛subscript𝑑osubscript𝑥𝑖subscript^𝑥𝑖d_{\\text{o}}(\\bm{x}^{n},\\hat{\\bm{x}}^{n})\\triangleq\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}d_{\\text{o}}(x_{i},\\hat{x}_{i}) and ds​(𝒔n,𝒔^n)≜1n​∑i=1nds​(si,s^i)≜subscript𝑑ssuperscript𝒔𝑛superscript^𝒔𝑛1𝑛superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑛subscript𝑑ssubscript𝑠𝑖subscript^𝑠𝑖d_{\\text{s}}(\\bm{s}^{n},\\hat{\\bm{s}}^{n})\\triangleq\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}d_{\\text{s}}(s_{i},\\hat{s}_{i}), respectively​​[ref]22.\nThen, denote Dosubscript𝐷oD_{\\text{o}} and Dssubscript𝐷sD_{\\text{s}} as the maximum tolerable observation and semantic distortions, respectively, and characterize the minimum of compression rate Rssubscript𝑅sR_{\\text{s}} that achieves a pair of distortions (Do,Ds)subscript𝐷osubscript𝐷s(D_{\\text{o}},D_{\\text{s}}) in the following lemma, whose proof is given in Ref. [ref]21 and [ref]22. The minimum compression rate to achieve distortion pair (Do,Ds)subscript𝐷osubscript𝐷s(D_{\\text{o}},D_{\\text{s}}),\ni.e., SRDF R​(Do,Ds)𝑅subscript𝐷osubscript𝐷sR(D_{\\text{o}},D_{\\text{s}}), is given as where design variable P(X^,S^)|Xsubscript𝑃conditional^𝑋^𝑆𝑋P_{(\\hat{X},\\hat{S})|X} is the conditional distribution of (X^,S^)^𝑋^𝑆(\\hat{X},\\hat{S}) given X𝑋X and PXsubscript𝑃𝑋P_{X} is the distribution of X𝑋X. Besides, P(X^,S^)subscript𝑃^𝑋^𝑆P_{(\\hat{X},\\hat{S})} and P(X,X^,S^)subscript𝑃𝑋^𝑋^𝑆P_{(X,\\hat{X},\\hat{S})} are the joint distributions of (X^,S^)^𝑋^𝑆(\\hat{X},\\hat{S}) and (X,X^,S^)𝑋^𝑋^𝑆(X,\\hat{X},\\hat{S}), respectively, which can be computed by PXsubscript𝑃𝑋P_{X} and P(X^,S^)|Xsubscript𝑃conditional^𝑋^𝑆𝑋P_{(\\hat{X},\\hat{S})|X}, and HKL(P(X,X^,S^)||PX×P(X^,S^))H_{\\text{KL}}(P_{(X,\\hat{X},\\hat{S})}||P_{X}\\times P_{(\\hat{X},\\hat{S})}) is the Kulolback-Leibler (KL) distance between joint distribution P(X,X^,S^)subscript𝑃𝑋^𝑋^𝑆P_{(X,\\hat{X},\\hat{S})} and product distribution PX×P(X^,S^)subscript𝑃𝑋subscript𝑃^𝑋^𝑆P_{X}\\times P_{(\\hat{X},\\hat{S})}. Moreover, d^s​(x,s^)=∑s∈𝒮PS|X​(s|x)​ds​(s,s^)subscript^𝑑s𝑥^𝑠subscript𝑠𝒮subscript𝑃conditional𝑆𝑋conditional𝑠𝑥subscript𝑑s𝑠^𝑠\\hat{d}_{\\text{s}}(x,\\hat{s})=\\sum_{s\\in\\mathcal{S}}P_{S|X}(s|x)d_{\\text{s}}(s,\\hat{s}) is a distortion measure satisfying d^s:𝒳×𝒮^→[0,+∞):subscript^𝑑s→𝒳^𝒮0\\hat{d}_{\\text{s}}:\\mathcal{X}\\times\\mathcal{\\hat{S}}\\to[0,+\\infty), with PS|Xsubscript𝑃conditional𝑆𝑋P_{S|X} being the conditional distribution of S𝑆S given X𝑋X, and its expected distorion E​[d^s​(X,S^)]Edelimited-[]subscript^𝑑s𝑋^𝑆\\textbf{E}[\\hat{d}_{\\text{s}}(X,\\hat{S})] is equivalent to E​[ds​(S,S^)]Edelimited-[]subscript𝑑s𝑆^𝑆\\textbf{E}[d_{\\text{s}}(S,\\hat{S})]. It is noted that the asymptotic optimality of semantic communications over the infinite discrete memoryless channel can always be obtained by SSCC​​[ref]22 . Then, under the considered SSCC framework shown in Fig. 1, the distortion pair (Do,Ds)subscript𝐷osubscript𝐷s(D_{\\text{o}},D_{\\text{s}}) is considered to be achievable if there exist separate source and channel codes such that the distortions between the transmitter and the receiver satisfy E​[do​(X,X^)]≤DoEdelimited-[]subscript𝑑o𝑋^𝑋subscript𝐷o\\textbf{E}[d_{\\text{o}}(X,\\hat{X})]\\leq D_{\\text{o}} and E​[d^s​(X,S^)]≤DsEdelimited-[]subscript^𝑑s𝑋^𝑆subscript𝐷s\\textbf{E}[\\hat{d}_{\\text{s}}(X,\\hat{S})]\\leq D_{\\text{s}}. Moreover, we can immediately derive the following lemma to characterize the achievability of distortion pair (Do,Ds)subscript𝐷osubscript𝐷s(D_{\\text{o}},D_{\\text{s}}). Utilizing the SSCC framework depicted in Fig. 1, distortion pair (Do,Ds)subscript𝐷osubscript𝐷s(D_{\\text{o}},D_{\\text{s}}) is achievable if and only if where C𝐶C is the channel capacity of the considered memoryless channel. Denote Dmaxosuperscriptsubscript𝐷maxoD_{\\text{max}}^{\\text{o}} as the maximum of observation distortion Dosubscript𝐷oD_{\\text{o}}, which is computed as the minimum expected distortion between X𝑋X and x^∈𝒳^^𝑥^𝒳\\hat{x}\\in\\hat{\\mathcal{X}}​​, i.e., Dmaxo=minx^∈X^⁡E​[do​(X,x^)]superscriptsubscript𝐷maxosubscript^𝑥^𝑋Edelimited-[]subscript𝑑o𝑋^𝑥D_{\\text{max}}^{\\text{o}}=\\min_{\\hat{x}\\in\\hat{X}}\\textbf{E}[d_{\\text{o}}(X,\\hat{x})]. Similarly, define Dmaxssuperscriptsubscript𝐷maxsD_{\\text{max}}^{\\text{s}} as the maximum of semantic distortion Dssubscript𝐷sD_{\\text{s}}, i.e., Dmaxs=mins^∈S^⁡E​[d^s​(X,s^)]superscriptsubscript𝐷maxssubscript^𝑠^𝑆Edelimited-[]subscript^𝑑s𝑋^𝑠D_{\\text{max}}^{\\text{s}}=\\min_{\\hat{s}\\in\\hat{S}}\\textbf{E}[\\hat{d}_{\\text{s}}(X,\\hat{s})]. Then, R​(Do,Ds)𝑅subscript𝐷osubscript𝐷sR(D_{\\text{o}},D_{\\text{s}}) has the following properties: R​(Do,Ds)𝑅subscript𝐷osubscript𝐷sR(D_{\\text{o}},D_{\\text{s}}) is jointly convex with (Do,Ds)subscript𝐷osubscript𝐷s(D_{\\text{o}},D_{\\text{s}}) and monotonically nonincreasing with respect to Dosubscript𝐷oD_{\\text{o}} and Dssubscript𝐷sD_{\\text{s}}. Moreover, if Do≥Dmaxosubscript𝐷osuperscriptsubscript𝐷maxoD_{\\text{o}}\\geq D_{\\text{max}}^{\\text{o}} and Ds≥Dmaxssubscript𝐷ssuperscriptsubscript𝐷maxsD_{\\text{s}}\\geq D_{\\text{max}}^{\\text{s}}, it follows R​(Do,Ds)=0𝑅subscript𝐷osubscript𝐷s0R(D_{\\text{o}},D_{\\text{s}})=0. For any fixed Ds∈[0,Dmaxs]subscript𝐷s0superscriptsubscript𝐷maxsD_{\\text{s}}\\in[0,D_{\\text{max}}^{\\text{s}}], there exists a Do′​(Ds)∈[0,Dmaxo]superscriptsubscript𝐷o′subscript𝐷s0superscriptsubscript𝐷maxoD_{\\text{o}}^{\\prime}(D_{\\text{s}})\\in[0,D_{\\text{max}}^{\\text{o}}] such that R​(Do,Ds)=Rs​(Ds)𝑅subscript𝐷osubscript𝐷ssubscript𝑅ssubscript𝐷sR(D_{\\text{o}},D_{\\text{s}})=R_{\\text{s}}(D_{\\text{s}}) for all Do≥Do′​(Ds)>0subscript𝐷osuperscriptsubscript𝐷o′subscript𝐷s0D_{\\text{o}}\\geq D_{\\text{o}}^{\\prime}(D_{\\text{s}})>0, where Rs​(Ds)subscript𝑅ssubscript𝐷sR_{\\text{s}}(D_{\\text{s}}) is the conventional rate-distortion function​​[cover1999elements] derived via the distortion between S𝑆S and S^^𝑆\\hat{S}. Similarly, for any fixed Do∈[0,Dmaxo]subscript𝐷o0superscriptsubscript𝐷maxoD_{\\text{o}}\\in[0,D_{\\text{max}}^{\\text{o}}], there exists a Ds′​(Do)∈[0,Dmaxs]superscriptsubscript𝐷s′subscript𝐷o0superscriptsubscript𝐷maxsD_{\\text{s}}^{\\prime}(D_{\\text{o}})\\in[0,D_{\\text{max}}^{\\text{s}}] such that R​(Do,Ds)=Ro​(Do)𝑅subscript𝐷osubscript𝐷ssubscript𝑅osubscript𝐷oR(D_{\\text{o}},D_{\\text{s}})=R_{\\text{o}}(D_{\\text{o}}) for all Ds≥Ds′​(Do)subscript𝐷ssuperscriptsubscript𝐷s′subscript𝐷oD_{\\text{s}}\\geq D_{\\text{s}}^{\\prime}(D_{\\text{o}}), where Ro​(Do)subscript𝑅osubscript𝐷oR_{\\text{o}}(D_{\\text{o}}) is the conventional rate-distortion function derived via the distortion between X𝑋X and X^^𝑋\\hat{X}. Property 1) can be easily proved by mimicking the proof for that of the conventional rate-distortion functions​​[cover1999elements]. The proofs of properties 2) and 3) can be found in Appendix A.\n∎ It is easy to observe that Remark II.1 describes the trade-off among SRDF R​(Do,Ds)𝑅subscript𝐷osubscript𝐷sR(D_{\\text{o}},D_{\\text{s}}) and distortions Dosubscript𝐷oD_{\\text{o}} and Dssubscript𝐷sD_{\\text{s}}. More specifically, for any fixed semantic distortion Dssubscript𝐷sD_{\\text{s}}, as the observation distortion Dosubscript𝐷oD_{\\text{o}} increases, R​(Do,Ds)𝑅subscript𝐷osubscript𝐷sR(D_{\\text{o}},D_{\\text{s}}) first decreases, and then becomes a constant equal to the conventional rate-distortion function Rs​(Ds)subscript𝑅ssubscript𝐷sR_{\\text{s}}(D_{\\text{s}}). This implies that there exists a lower bound of Dosubscript𝐷oD_{\\text{o}} for any fixed Dssubscript𝐷sD_{\\text{s}}, denoted as Do′​(Ds)superscriptsubscript𝐷o′subscript𝐷sD_{\\text{o}}^{\\prime}(D_{\\text{s}}), such that R​(Do,Ds)𝑅subscript𝐷osubscript𝐷sR(D_{\\text{o}},D_{\\text{s}}) is degenerated to Rs​(Ds)subscript𝑅ssubscript𝐷sR_{\\text{s}}(D_{\\text{s}}) when Do≥Do′​(Ds)subscript𝐷osuperscriptsubscript𝐷o′subscript𝐷sD_{\\text{o}}\\geq D_{\\text{o}}^{\\prime}(D_{\\text{s}}). Similarly, there also exists a lower bound Ds′​(Do)superscriptsubscript𝐷s′subscript𝐷oD_{\\text{s}}^{\\prime}(D_{\\text{o}}) of Dssubscript𝐷sD_{\\text{s}} such that R​(Do,Ds)𝑅subscript𝐷osubscript𝐷sR(D_{\\text{o}},D_{\\text{s}}) is degenerated to the conventional rate-distortion function Ro​(Do)subscript𝑅osubscript𝐷oR_{\\text{o}}(D_{\\text{o}}) when Ds≥Ds′​(Do)subscript𝐷ssuperscriptsubscript𝐷s′subscript𝐷oD_{\\text{s}}\\geq D_{\\text{s}}^{\\prime}(D_{\\text{o}}). Numerical results regarding SRDF R​(Do,Ds)𝑅subscript𝐷osubscript𝐷sR(D_{\\text{o}},D_{\\text{s}}) are provided in Section V, which show the monotonic and convex properties of R​(Do,Ds)𝑅subscript𝐷osubscript𝐷sR(D_{\\text{o}},D_{\\text{s}}) for some specific semantic sources. However, there are still several challenges in effectively computing SRDF R​(Do,Ds)𝑅subscript𝐷osubscript𝐷sR(D_{\\text{o}},D_{\\text{s}}) by (1).\nFirst, it is generally not possible to derive an expression for R​(Do,Ds)𝑅subscript𝐷osubscript𝐷sR(D_{\\text{o}},D_{\\text{s}}) in closed form​​[ref]22 , and existing numerical methods for computing R​(Do,Ds)𝑅subscript𝐷osubscript𝐷sR(D_{\\text{o}},D_{\\text{s}}) are limited to some specific sources, e.g., Gaussian​​[ref]22 and binary sources​​. Second, it is much more challenging to compute SRDF R​(Do,Ds)𝑅subscript𝐷osubscript𝐷sR(D_{\\text{o}},D_{\\text{s}}) when semantic source distribution P(X,S)subscript𝑃𝑋𝑆P_{(X,S)} is not perfectly known, i.e., only certain amount of samples of the semantic source pair (X,S)𝑋𝑆(X,S) is available. To address these challenges, we propose two methods to compute R​(Do,Ds)𝑅subscript𝐷osubscript𝐷sR(D_{\\text{o}},D_{\\text{s}}) based on the assumptions of different levels of semantic source distribution information.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: respectively​​[ref]22.\nThen, denote Dosubscript𝐷oD_{\\text{o}} and Dssubscript𝐷sD_{\\text{s}} as the maximum tolerable observation and semantic distortions, respectively, and characterize the minimum of compression\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
