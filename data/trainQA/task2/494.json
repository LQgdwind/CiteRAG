      "content": "Paper Title: Sparse and Continuous Attention Mechanisms\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExponential families are ubiquitous in statistics and machine learning  . They enjoy many useful properties, such as the existence of conjugate priors (crucial in Bayesian inference) and\nthe classical Pitman-Koopman-Darmois theorem   , which states that,\namong families with fixed support (independent of the parameters), exponential families are the only having sufficient statistics of fixed dimension for any number of i.i.d.¬†samples. Departing from exponential families, there has been recent work on discrete, finite-domain distributions with varying and sparse support, via the sparsemax and the entmax transformations [ref]6 [ref]7 [ref]8.\nThose approaches drop the link to exponential families of categorical distributions provided by the softmax transformation, which always yields dense probability mass functions. In contrast, sparsemax and entmax can lead to sparse distributions, whose support is not constant throughout the family. This property has been used  to design sparse attention mechanisms with improved interpretability [ref]8 . However, sparsemax and entmax are so far limited to discrete domains. Can a similar approach be extended to continuous domains? This paper provides that extension and pinpoints a connection with ‚Äúdeformed exponential families‚Äù 0 1 2 and Tsallis statistics 3, leading to Œ±ùõº\\alpha-sparse families (¬ß2).\nWe use this construction to obtain new density families with varying support,\nincluding the truncated parabola and paraboloid distributions (2-sparse counterpart of the Gaussian, ¬ß2.4 and Fig.¬†1). Softmax and its variants are widely used in attention mechanisms, an important component of neural networks 4. Attention-based neural networks can ‚Äúattend‚Äù to finite sets of objects and identify relevant features.\nWe use our extension above to devise new continuous attention mechanisms (¬ß3), which can attend to continuous data streams and to domains that are inherently continuous, such as images. Unlike traditional attention mechanisms, ours are suitable for selecting compact regions, such as 1D-segments or 2D-ellipses. We show that the Jacobian of these transformations are generalized covariances, and we use this fact to obtain efficient backpropagation algorithms (¬ß3.2). As a proof of concept, we apply our models with continuous attention to text classification, machine translation, and visual question answering tasks, with encouraging results (¬ß4).\n\nReference markers found: [6]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]6: Departing from exponential families, there has been recent work on discrete, finite-domain distributions with varying and sparse support, via the sparsemax and the entmax transformations [ref]6 [ref]7 [ref]8.\nThose approaches drop the link to exponential families of categorical distributions provided by the softmax transformation, which always yields dense probability mass functions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
