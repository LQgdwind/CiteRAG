      "content": "Paper Title: DualVGR: A Dual-Visual Graph Reasoning Unit for Video Question Answering\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVideoQA is a challenging and high-level multimedia task [ref]1, which requires the agents to understand videos and perform relational reasoning according to questions based on visual, textual, as well as spatial-temporal contents. Since the input of VideoQA is a sequence of frames, there are two differences between ImageQA and VideoQA: (1) In addition to appearance information, VideoQA also needs to understand the motion information to answer the questions. (2) VideoQA requires to perform spatio-temporal reasoning over the objects, while ImageQA only requires spatial reasoning over the objects. Therefore, scene graphs  [ref]3  and neural-symbolic reasoning frameworks    , which are used in ImageQA, are hard to be implemented in VideoQA as the agents have to address the issues of comprehensive representation (e.g. appearance and motion information) and multi-step reasoning. In order to solve the above challenges, this work focuses on performing multi-step reasoning via Graph Networks for VideoQA. Previous reasoning-based methods can be divided into four categories based on their frameworks. The first group     implements spatial and temporal attention mechanism to iteratively select useful information to answer the questions. The second group [ref]13  focuses on memory-based network, which is quite popular in TextQA. However, these methods neglect the visual relation information when performing multi-step reasoning. The third group  aims to perform relational reasoning via a simple module, like relation network. However, this module can only model a limited number of objects. The fourth group   aims to use graph neural networks to integrate relation information into their frameworks by considering GNNâ€™s powerful representation ability on relation modeling. GNN is a novel relation encoder that captures the inter-object relations beyond static object/region detection, thus enabling reasoning with rich relational information. Compared with relation network, graph neural network is more flexible and powerful in relational reasoning, thus we follow this group in our work. However, existing graph-based methods   neglect two key attributes of VideoQA task when performing reasoning: (1) Not all video shots or objects are correlated to the question. As illustrated in Fig. 1., to answer Question1: Who is a dog that looks like a panda walking with?, only question-related video clips are needed to infer the answer. (2) Appearance and motion features are associated and complementary to each other in each reasoning step. Using Fig. 1 as an example again, when answering Question2: What is a small dog which looks exactly like a panda running rapidly on?, it is necessary for agents to utilize both appearance and motion information. Specifically, in order to understand a small dog which looks exactly like a panda, agents need to rely on appearance information to find the dog. Then, they have to analyze the motion information to infer the action of the dog: running rapidly on the road. In short, The appearance information could provide clues to pay attention to certain motion information to answer the questions, vice versa. Motivated by these observations, we devise a novel graph-based reasoning unit named Dual-Visual Graph Reasoning Unit (DualVGR), which is stacked in an iterative manner to perform multi-step reasoning. At first, we design Query Punishment Module to generate query-guided masks to allow a limited number of question-related video features into relational reasoning. Then, in order to fully capture the multi-view visual relation information, we propose Video-based Multi-view Graph Attention Network to reveal the relation between appearance and motion channels. The proposed graph network includes two graphs for each visual channel. The first graph aims to learn the underlying complementary relation within each specific visual space, and the other is to learn the concomitant and correlated relation between appearance and motion features. The losses of video-based multi-view graph network are consistency constraint loss and disparity constraint loss. Consistency constraint loss is to enhance the commonality between appearance and motion features, while disparity constraint loss is to enhance the heterogeneity between them. The main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows. (1) We propose a DualVGR unit, a multimodal reasoning unit enabling the represention of rich interactions between question and video clips. This unit includes two components. One is an explainable Query Punishment Module to filter out irrelevant visual-based information. It has been demonstrated good results in both short and long compositional questions during multiple cycles of reasoning. The other is a Video-based Multi-view Graph Attention Network to perform spatial-temporal relational reasoning such that the relations between appearance and motion can be adaptively captured; (2) We incorporate our DualVGR unit into a full DualVGR network by stacking it in an iterative manner. Through multi-step reasoning, our method achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results on several mainstream datasets: MSVD-QA [ref]13, MSRVTT-QA  and SVQA .\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: VideoQA is a challenging and high-level multimedia task [ref]1, which requires the agents to understand videos and perform relational reasoning according to questions based on visual, textual, as well as spatial-temporal contents.
