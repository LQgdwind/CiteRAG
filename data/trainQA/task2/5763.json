      "content": "Paper Title: GeoMIM: Towards Better 3D Knowledge Transfer via Masked Image Modeling for Multi-view 3D Understanding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMulti-view camera-based 3D detection is an emerging critical problem in computer vision [ref]22      8     . To improve the detection performance, recent works    often choose to use a pretrained LiDAR model as the teacher and transfer its knowledge to a camera-based student network. Various techniques, such as LIGA-Stereo , CMKD , and BEVDistill , have been proposed to leverage the rich geometry information of the LiDAR model’s BEV (bird’s eye view) features. Utilizing a pretrained LiDAR model to provide auxiliary supervision has become a widely adopted design that can enhance the performance of camera-based models. However, we contend that this design is not optimal due to a significant domain gap between the BEV features of the LiDAR model and those of the camera-based model. This domain gap arises from the 3D and sparse characteristics of LiDAR point clouds compared to the dense 2D images captured by the camera. Additionally, the LiDAR model’s BEV features are grounded in ground truth depth, while those of the camera-based model are typically inferred from 2D images, a problem that is often ill-posed.\nWe empirically demonstrate their domain gap with a pilot study as shown in Tab. 1. We find that utilizing a LiDAR teacher to provide auxiliary supervision can indeed improve an ImageNet-pretrained  camera-based model, but is unable to improve a stronger camera-based model initialized by recent powerful self-supervised pretraining. In other words, directly utilizing the pretrained LiDAR model to distill the final camera-based model might not be an optimal design and does not necessarily lead to performance gain. To better take advantage of the LiDAR model, in this paper, we propose Geometry Enhanced Masked Image Modeling (GeoMIM) to transfer the knowledge of the LiDAR model in a pretrain-finetune paradigm for improving the multi-view camera-based 3D detection. It is built upon a multi-camera vision transformer with Cross-View Attention (CVA) blocks and enables perspective-view (PV) representation pretraining via BEV feature reconstruction from masked images. Specifically, during pretraining, we partition the training images into patches and feed a portion of them into the encoder following Masked Autoencoder [ref]15. Our GeoMIM decoder then uses these encoded visible tokens to reconstruct the pretrained LiDAR model’s BEV feature in the BEV space instead of commonly used RGB pixels  [ref]15  or depth points  as in existing MAE frameworks. To achieve this PV to BEV reconstruction, we first devise two branches to decouple the semantic and geometric parts, with one branch completing dense PV features and the other reconstructing the depth map. The dense PV features can then be projected into the BEV space with the depth distribution following Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) 9. We further equip the two branches with the proposed CVA blocks in their intermediate layers to allow each patch to attend to tokens in other views. It enhances the decoder’s capability of joint multi-view inference which is especially critical for BEV feature reconstruction. Finally, the depth branch is designed to be camera-aware with the additional encoding of cameras’ parameters as input, making the pretrained GeoMIM better adapt to downstream tasks with different cameras. To demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoMIM, we finetune the pretrained backbone to conduct multi-view camera-based 3D detection and 3D segmentation on the nuScenes  dataset. We achieve state-of-the-art results of 64.4 NDS (NuScenes Detection Score) and 70.5 mIoU (mean intersection over union) for 3D detection and segmentation on the NuScenes test set, which are 2.5% and 1.1% better than previously reported best results 8 . Additionally, we verify that the backbone pretrained on nuScenes dataset can be successfully transferred to Waymo Open dataset , improving the mAP (mean average precision) of the ImageNet-initialized 3D detector by 6.9%.\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: Multi-view camera-based 3D detection is an emerging critical problem in computer vision [ref]22      8     .
