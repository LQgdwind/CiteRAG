      "content": "Paper Title: A Graph is Worth 1-bit Spikes: When Graph Contrastive Learning Meets Spiking Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we perform experimental evaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed SpikeGCL framework.\nDue to space limitations, we present detailed experimental settings and additional results in Appendix¬†E and Appendix¬†F accomplishing the submission. Code is available at https://github.com/EdisonLeeeee/SpikeGCLfor reproducibility. Datasets.¬†\nWe evaluate SpikeGCL on several graph benchmarks with different scales and properties. Following prior works¬† [ref]36 , we adopt 9 common benchmark graphs, including two co-purchase graphs, i.e., Amazon-Photo, Amazon-Computer¬†[ref]33, two co-author graphs, i.e., Coauthor-CS and Coauthor-Physics¬†[ref]33, three citation graphs, i.e., Cora, CiteSeer, Pubmed¬†, as well as two large-scale datasets ogbn-arXiv and ogbn-MAG from Open Graph Benchmark¬†.\nThe detailed introduction and statistics of these datasets are presented in Appendix E. Baselines.¬†\nWe compare our proposed methods to a wide range of baselines that fall into four categories: (i) full-precision (supervised) GNNs: GCN¬† and GAT¬†; (ii) 1-bit quantization-based GNNs: Bi-GCN¬†[ref]39, BinaryGNN¬† and BANE¬†; (iii) contrastive methods: DGI¬†, GRACE¬†, CCA-SSG¬†, BGRL¬†[ref]36, SUGRL¬†, and GGD¬†; (iv) Graph SNNs: SpikingGCN¬†, SpikeNet¬†, GC-SNN and GA-SNN¬†. SpikeNet is initially designed for dynamic graphs, we adapt the author‚Äôs implementation to static graphs following the practice in  .\nThe hyperparameters of all the baselines were configured according to the experimental settings officially reported by the authors and were then carefully tuned in our experiments to achieve their best results. Overall performance.¬†\nThe results on six graph datasets are summarized in Table¬†1.\nWe defer the results on Cora, CiteSeer, and Pubmed to Appendix.\nTable¬†1 shows a significant performance gap between full-precision methods and 1-bit GNNs, particularly with the unsupervised method BANE. Even supervised methods Bi-GCN and binaryGNN struggle to match the performance of full-precision methods. In contrast, SpikeGCL competes comfortably and sometimes outperforms advanced full-precision methods. When compared to full-precision GCL methods, our model approximates about 95%‚àºsimilar-to\\sim105% of their performance capability across all datasets. Additionally, SpikeGCL performs comparably to supervised graph SNNs and offers the possibility to scale to large graph datasets (e.g., arXiv and MAG). Surprisingly, SpikeGCL achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on the MAG dataset. Overall, the results indicate that binary representation does not necessarily lead to accuracy loss as long as it is properly trained. Efficiency.¬†\nWe first provide a comparison of the number of parameters and theoretical energy consumption of SpikeGCL and full-precision GCL methods. The computation of theoretical energy consumption follows existing works¬†  [ref]39 and is detailed in Appendix F. Table¬†2 summarizes the results in terms of model size and energy efficiency compared to full-precision GCL methods. SpikeGCL consistently shows better efficiency across all datasets, achieving ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim7k less energy consumption and ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim1/60 model size on MAG.\nAs the time step TùëáT is a critical hyperparameter for SNNs to better approximate real-valued inputs with discrete spikes, we compare the efficiency of SpikeGCL and other graph SNNs in terms of accuracy, training time, GPU memory usage, and theoretical energy consumption with varying time steps from 5 to 30. The results on the Computers dataset are shown in Figure¬†4. It is observed that SpikeGCL and other graph SNNs benefit from increasing time steps, generally improving accuracy as the time step increases. However, a large time step often leads to more overheads. In our experiments, a larger time step can make SNNs inefficient and become a major bottleneck to scaling to large graphs, as demonstrated by increasing training time, memory usage, and energy consumption. Nevertheless, the efficiency of SpikeGCL is less affected by increasing time steps. The results demonstrate that SpikeGCL, coupled with compact graph sequence input and blockwise training paradigm, alleviates such a drawback of training deep SNNs. Overall, SpikeGCL is able to significantly reduces computation costs and enhance the representational learning capabilities of the model simultaneously. Convergence.¬†\nWe compared the convergence speed of SpikeGCL with full-precision GCL baselines on Computers, which is shown in Figure¬†5. It is observed that negative-sample-free methods generally converged faster than negative-sample-based ones. However, they still required sufficient epochs to gradually improve their performance. In contrast, SpikeGCL that trained in a blockwise training paradigm demonstrates a significantly faster convergence speed over full-precision methods. In particular, 1-2 epochs are sufficient for SpikeGCL to learn good representations. Overall, our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SpikeGCL in improving the convergence speed of SNNs and provide insights into the benefits of the blockwise training paradigm.\n\nReference markers found: [36]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]36: is available at https://github.com/EdisonLeeeee/SpikeGCLfor reproducibility.
