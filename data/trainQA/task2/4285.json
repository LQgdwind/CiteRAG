      "content": "Paper Title: Can Population-based Engagement Improve Personalisation? A Novel Dataset and Experiments\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nA few works on engagement prediction with videos (e.g. modelling watch time) have been done with YouTube  [ref]24, where YouTube specific meta-data features (e.g. channel reputation, category etc.) are used exclusively. Although large-scale public datasets relating to engagement prediction are encountered, they focus on general-purpose videos (largely entertainment) rather than educational videos [ref]44. Some of the features used by these works share similarity with ones proposed in this paper (such as video duration, language and topic features). However, no textual features (based on video transcript) relating to understandability and presentation are used in this prior work, making the methods hard to generalise outside of YouTube. Beyond videos, educational IR   and Wikipedia page quality prediction  [ref]43 has been attempted using features such as text style, readability, structure, network, recency and review data. Publicly available Wikipedia article quality dataset  with human annotated (explicit) labels is used to tackle the latter task although implicit labels are not included in this dataset. Similar datasets are available for automated essay scoring . But, none of these datasets fill the lack of resources for predicting engagement of educational videos. In the context of education, a different line of work looks at learner engagement using learner-specific multi-modal data (brain waives , facial expressions  etc.). While tackling a different task, these datasets are mainly collected in a controlled lab setting where the in-the-wild factor is missing . A large number of public datasets and competitions in education also relate to students interacting with learning problems (e.g. ASSISTments  or multiple choice questions ), but these datasets, contrary to the proposed VLE dataset, do not focus on implicit engagement. More relevant and similar datasets that address context-agnostic engagement prediction in education has been emerging with a focus on MOOCs. Studying approximately 800 videos from edX platform, Guo et al.  manually processed and provided a qualitative analysis of engagement, with some features being relatively subjective and difficult to automate. A similar work  takes 22 edX videos, extracts cross-modal features and manually annotates their quality with no focus on learner engagement with the videos. Neither dataset is publicly available. MOOCCube is a recently released dataset that contains a spectrum of details relating to MOOC interactions . Although large, the video watch logs in MOOCCube come from 190,000 users where as VLE signals are generated over 1.1 Million users. As central values (e.g. median) are used for context-agnostic engagement prediction, larger user base adds stability to the engagement centres. MOOCCube uses a closed topic taxonomy disconnected from Wikipedia which prevents the dataset from using all the powerful signals in Wikipedia (e.g. semantic relatedness, category tree to name a few) to improve prediction models. No engagement prediction attempts are published thus far to demonstrate MOOCCube’s promise in the task. On a more relevant contribution,  has demonstrated that context-agnostic engagement prediction models can be built with implicit watch time based labels and these models can be used in addressing the cold-start problem (see Figure 1). We identify this work as the closest contribution to the proposed dataset. They gather a collection of 4,000 video lectures with engagement signals generated by 150,000 informal learners. We consider our work, VLE, as an expansion to this dataset with around 12,000 video lectures where engagement signals are generated by 7 times as many learners. The new dataset also restricts itself to strictly English lectures to preserve the meaningfulness of majority of features that are specific to English language. VLE also introduces a new set of Wikipedia-based topical features. Furthermore, this work also accompanies additional experiments that goes beyond data quantity and validates the usefulness of the dataset.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: A few works on engagement prediction with videos (e.g. modelling watch time) have been done with YouTube  [ref]24, where YouTube specific meta-data features (e.g. channel reputation, category etc.) are used exclusively.
