      "content": "Paper Title: Transformer-based Planning for Symbolic Regression\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSymbolic regression (SR) is a powerful method to discover mathematical expressions for governing equations of complex systems and to describe data patterns in an interpretable symbolic form. It finds extensive applications in science and engineering, enabling the modeling of physical phenomena in various domains such as molecular dynamics, fluid dynamics, and cosmology     [ref]5 .\nSymbolic representations provide valuable insights into complex systems, facilitating a better understanding, prediction, and control of these systems through the design of accurate, generalizable, and efficient models  [ref]8 .\nSR models establish the functional relationship between independent and target variables by mapping them to mathematical equations. The input data can be obtained from simulations, experimental measurements, or real-world observations. Symbolic regression, however, poses several challenges, including the combinatorial nature of the optimization search space, vulnerability to the quality of input data, and the difficulty of striking a balance between model fitting, complexity, and generalization performance 0 1. Symbolic regression encompasses a wide range of methods, spanning different categories. Traditional approaches, such as Genetic Programming (GP), use a heuristic population-based search strategy where each individual represents a potential solution to the problem 2 3. Though GP algorithms are capable of finding solutions for nonlinear and complex problems, they are typically slow to converge\ndue to the vast functional search space. Also, as they need to start the search from scratch for each dataset, they tend to be computationally expensive, prone to overfitting, and sensitive to the choice of parameters 4. Recent works in SR have shown promising results by using pre-trained transformers 5 for generating equations as sequences of tokens. These models leverage the prior knowledge learned through large-scale pre-training and can generate equations with a single forward pass, leading to faster inference times compared to GP-based methods 6 7 8 9.\nHowever, one of the limitations of these models is that they focus on the supervised pre-training goals borrowed from text generation, i.e., they are trained solely with the token-level cross-entropy (CE) loss, which can result in equations that may exhibit high token-level similarities but are suboptimal with respect to equation discovery objectives such as fitting accuracy and complexity. To mitigate this issue, beam search 0 1 or sampling 2 approaches are employed as decoding strategies to propose multiple candidate equations for a given dataset, and then select the optimal candidate equation based on the fitting accuracy after optimizing for constants. Nonetheless, both beam search and sampling decoding strategies primarily rely on the pre-trained transformerâ€™s logits and next token probability distributions, and therefore do not receive any performance feedback during the generation of equation candidates. To consider the equation discovery objectives in the transformer generation process and still benefit from the pre-trained model logits, we propose TPSR, a Transformer-based Planning strategy for Symbolic Regression. TPSR leverages a lookahead planning algorithm, using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) as a decoding strategy on top of pre-trained transformer-based SR models to guide equation sequence generation.\nTPSR significantly improves the performance of generated equations by considering feedback during the generation process and still remains faster than GP-based models which do not leverage the pre-training priors and learn expressions for each dataset from scratch.\nNotably, our approach is model-agnostic and can be applied to any pre-trained SR model, enabling optimization of generated equation sequences for non-differentiable objectives that may encompass combinations of fitting accuracy, complexity, and equation forms. Additionally, we incorporate different caching mechanisms to reduce the overall inference time. Our experimental results demonstrate that applying TPSR on top of the pre-trained E2E SR model 8 significantly enhances its performance across various benchmark datasets.\nAs depicted in Fig. 1, TPSR achieves a strong balance between fitting accuracy and model complexity compared to other leading baselines. It also effectively drives the E2E model towards the optimal trade-off, represented by the first Pareto front. The major contributions of this work are summarized below: Proposing TPSR, a new method that combines pre-trained transformer SR models with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) lookahead planning to optimize the generation of equation sequences while considering non-differentiable performance feedback. Developing a new reward function that balances equation fitting accuracy and complexity to optimize the generated equations for an effective trade-off. Demonstrating that TPSR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various SR benchmark datasets, generating equations with higher fitting accuracy while maintaining lower complexity to avoid non-parsimonious solutions. Showcasing the extrapolation and noise robustness of TPSR compared to the baseline and conducting an ablation study to investigate the impact of various model components.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: form.
