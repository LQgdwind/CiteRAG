      "content": "Paper Title: Solving 3D Inverse Problems using Pre-trained 2D Diffusion Models\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nChung et al. \nAs the method is based on diffusion models, we use the same pre-trained score function, and use the reconstruction scheme of , which amounts to applying ART after every PC update steps. Lahiri et al. \nWe use 2-stage reconstructing 3D CNNs, where we train the networks with slabs, not taking patches in the xy dimension, as the paper suggests. The architecture of CNN was taken as a standard U-Net  architecture rather than stack of single-resolution CNNs, as we achieved better performance with U-Nets. Furthermore, we drop the adversarial loss and only use the standard reconstruction loss, as we found the training to be more stable. CG was applied with 30 iterations. FBPConvNet , Zhang et al. [ref]37\nWe use the same U-Net architecture that was used to train Lahiri et al. , but only on 2D images. Note that the original work of Zhang et al. [ref]37 uses a much simpler CNN architecture, which leads to degraded performance. ADMM-TV. \nWe minimize the following objective where 𝑫=[𝑫x,𝑫y,𝑫z]𝑫subscript𝑫𝑥subscript𝑫𝑦subscript𝑫𝑧{\\bm{D}}=[{\\bm{D}}_{x},{\\bm{D}}_{y},{\\bm{D}}_{z}], which corresponds to the isotropic TV. The outer iterations are solved with ADMM (30 iterations), while the inner iterations are solved with CG (20 iterations). We perform coarse grid search to find the parameter values that produce low MSE values, then perform another grid search to find the most visually pleasing solution — images with salient edges.\nThe parameter is set to (λ,ρ)=(0.5,50)𝜆𝜌0.550(\\lambda,\\rho)=(0.5,50) for SV-CT, and (λ,ρ)=(0.15,40)𝜆𝜌0.1540(\\lambda,\\rho)=(0.15,40) for LA-CT. Score-MRI. [ref]7\nThe method utilizes the same score function as the proposed method, but relies on iterated projections onto the measurement subspace after every iteration of the PC update. Every slices in the xy dimension are reconstructed separately, then stacked to form the volume. DuDoRNet. \nWe train DuDoRNet with 4 recurrent blocks and the default parameters, following the configuration of [ref]7. The network is trained on the fastMRI knee dataset, with the proton density (PD) / proton density fat suppressed (PDFS) image for the prior information. U-Net. \nWe leverage the pre-trained U-Net on the fastMRI dataset, trained only with the L1 loss in the image domain.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: Furthermore, we drop the adversarial loss and only use the standard reconstruction loss, as we found the training to be more stable. CG was applied with 30 iterations. FBPConvNet , Zhang et al. [ref]37\nWe use the same U-Net architecture that was used to train Lahiri et al. , but only on 2D images.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
