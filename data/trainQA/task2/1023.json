      "content": "Paper Title: Holistic Combination of Structural and Textual Code Information for Context based API Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe compare APIRec-CST with existing approaches for solving the same problem.\nWe adopt two approaches that are most related to ours as baseline approaches in this evaluation. One is GraLan , which is a state-of-the-art graph-based statistical model for API recommendation and the other is Tree-LSTM , which is a state-of-the-art deep learning model using tree-based structure for API recommendation.\nWe reimplement GraLan based on the description of the approach in  and the extraction of graph representation from code in .\nThe implementation of Tree-LSTM is directly obtained from the authors of .\nAPIRec-CST, GraLan  and Tree-LSTM are trained with the same training data.\nWe choose six open-source Java projects as the test data: Galaxy , Log4j , JGit , Froyo-Email , Grid-Sphere , and Itext .\nThese projects are chosen based on the following criteria:\nwidely used as test data in previous researches on API recommendation (e.g.,  [ref]9);\nnot included in the training data or validation data.\nFollowing the same procedure of training/validation instance construction, we create 14,986 test instances from the test data. To confirm the effect of our GraLan implementation, we compare the API recommendation accuracy of our implementation on the six projects with that of the GraLan implementation by Liu et al. [ref]9 based on the results they report in [ref]9.\nThe comparison shows that:\nour implementation achieves a top-1 (top-10) accuracy of 19.6-41.6% (73.4-80.9%), while their implementation achieves a top-1 (top-10) accuracy of 22.4-33.6% (73.9-80.6%);\nin terms of top-1 accuracy, our implementation is better than theirs on 4 projects and worse than theirs on 2 projects;\nin terms of top-10 accuracy, our implementation is better than theirs on 4 projects and worse than theirs on 2 projects.\nThe results show that the performance of these two implementations is comparable.\nNote that the performance of GraLan is sensitive to the count of each subgraph appeared in the training data.\nOur training data is different from the training data used in [ref]9, which explains why the performance of our implementation of GraLan is different from their original. We compare the top-K accuracies and MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) of APIRec-CST, GraLan and Tree-LSTM for predicting the next API.\nMRR is a summary metric for top-K accuracies that averages the inverse of the ranks of each recommendation, which ranges from 0 to 1 . For example, a MRR of 0.25 means that the correct recommendation is to appear at the fourth position on average.\nThe results are shown in Table IV.\nIn the table, the number of test instances of each project is shown after the project name and the best accuracy and MRR values are in boldface.\nWe can see that APIRec-CST achieves much higher top-1, top-5, and top-10 accuracy than GraLan and Tree-LSTM.\nFor the six projects, APIRec-CST’s top-1, top-5, and top-10 accuracy is 50.6-66.4% (58.6% on average), 67.7-87.1% (81.4% on average), and 79.2-92.5% (87.9% on average), respectively;\nGraLan’s top-1, top-5, and top-10 accuracy is 19.6-41.6% (31.5% on average), 60.5-71.4% (64.5% on average), and 73.4-80.9% (77.6% on average), respectively;\nTree-LSTM’s top-1, top-5, and top-10 accuracy is 39.3-52.6% (46.7% on average), 62.9-75.6% (70.4% on average), and 75.6-82.6% (79.3% on average), respectively.\nWe can see that APIRec-CST also achieves much higher MRR than GraLan and Tree-LSTM.\nAPIRec-CST’s MRR is 58.4-74.2% (68.4% on average), GraLan’s MRR is 37.4-53.8% (45.3% on average) and Tree-LSTM’s MRR is 51.4-61.7% (56.7% on average).\nFurthermore, we conduct Mann-Whitney U test to determine whether the improvements in top-1, top-5, top-10 accuracy and MRR between APIRec-CST and the other two approaches are statistically significant.\nIf the p-value is less than 0.05, the improvement is considered to be significant.\nThe p-value of top-1, top-5 and top-10 accuracy between APIRec-CST and GraLan are 0.003, 0.004 and 0.004 respectively.\nThe p-value of top-1, top-5 and top-10 accuracy between APIRec-CST and Tree-LSTM are 0.015, 0.023 and 0.010 respectively.\nThe p-value of MRR between APIRec-CST and GraLan is 0.003 and the p-value of MRR between APIRec-CST and Tree-LSTM is 0.007.\nWe can see that all the improvements are significant.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: Log4j , JGit , Froyo-Email , Grid-Sphere , and Itext .\nThese projects are chosen based on the following criteria:\nwidely used as test data in previous researches on API recommendation (e.g.,  [ref]9);\nnot included in the training data or validation data.\nFollowing the same procedure of training/validation instance construction, we create 14,986 test instances from the test data.
