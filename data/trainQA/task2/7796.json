      "content": "Paper Title: TroLLoc: Logic Locking and Layout Hardening for IC Security Closure against Hardware Trojans\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIntegrated\ncircuits (ICs) of varying scale and complexity are at the heart of all our modern-day information systems.\nAn ever-growing body of security threats can compromise information systems in general\nand ICs in particular  [ref]4 [ref]5.\nFor the design, manufacturing, and deployment of ICs,\nthere are numerous companies and partners involved within complex and world-wide supply chains—ICs run\nthrough many hands, where some of those may be acting with malicious intent.\nFurthermore, once ICs\nare deployed in the field,\nadversaries can employ powerful hands-on measures, targeting directly at the hardware and software at runtime. The resulting cybersecurity challenges are manifold, suggesting the need for holistic and streamlined defense efforts, all the way\nfrom software applications down to the IC hardware.\nToward the latter end, electronic design automation (EDA) algorithms and tools will play an important\nrole    [ref]4.\nHowever, state-of-the-art (SOTA) commercial EDA tools do not account yet for\nsuch security challenges. Security closure is an emerging paradigm that\nseeks to address this shortcoming of EDA tools. The idea is to proactively harden the layouts of ICs,\nduring physical synthesis, against various threats that are executed post design-time   .\nSuch efforts are important for multiple reasons. For example,\nthreats like hardware Trojans or side-channel\nattacks are explicitly exploiting vulnerabilities of the IC layouts, and any such threats that are not mitigated during design-time will be very difficult to address later on—unlike software, ICs are not easily patchable.\nSee Sec. II-B for more background. In this work, we focus on the threat of hardware Trojans, i.e., malicious circuit modifications\nthat can be introduced by different adversaries throughout the IC supply chain.\nBy design, Trojans are only minor in extent but severe in\nfallout   .\nMany different types of countermeasures have been proposed over the years.\nHowever, most prior art falls short in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and/or robustness.\nSee Sec. II-A for more background on Trojans and\nSec. III for a discussion of relevant prior countermeasures, respectively. Besides, logic locking, or locking for short, means to\nincorporate so-called key-gate structures\nthat are controlled by secret key-bits [ref]15.\nWithout\nknowing the related key-bits required to unlock those key-gate structures, attackers cannot fully understand the structure and functionality of the\ndesign at hand.\nWhile locking is mainly known for protection of chip-design intellectual property (IP),\nit can also serve for Trojan defense.\nSee Sec. II-C for more background on locking. The objective of this work is security closure against hardware Trojans.\nThat is,\nwe aim for proactive, pre-silicon Trojan prevention, by carefully and systematically hardening the physical\nlayout of ICs against post-design Trojan insertion. Based on a thorough review of prior art and its limitations,\nwe derive important research challenges as follows.\nNote that various concepts indicated on here, like second-order attacks or open placement sites, are all explained in detail in Sec. II. Robustness – Any Trojan defense\nmust remain robust in place.\nThat is, a foundry-based adversary, being fully aware that some defense is put in\nplace, would naturally want to first circumvent that defense\n(i.e., stealthily remove, override, or otherwise render useless)\nbefore inserting their Trojans.\nSuch second-order attacks represent a key challenge where\nprior art\nfalls short. Effectiveness – Any defense should protect against various Trojans.\nThis is especially true for proactive, pre-silicon defenses which have\nonly “one shot” at design-time.\nMore specifically, designs should be protected as a whole, i.e., in terms of (i) layout resources\nexploitable for Trojan insertion in general (i.e., open placement sites, free routing tracks, available timing\nslacks) and (ii) the netlist structure and functionality, which is relevant\nto hinder Trojans targeting on specific assets.\nFurthermore, defenses should be evaluated against actual layout-level Trojan insertion, not only against vulnerability estimates. Efficiency – Any defense should incur limited overheads.\nTaking control over the underlying trade-offs for resilience against Trojans versus design overheads requires two parts:\n(i) metrics for security and overheads, and (ii) some integrated, secure-by-design EDA methodology,\nutilizing those metrics and some user guidance. To address all these challenges,\nour work makes the following\ncontributions. A high-level representation of our contributions is also given in Fig. 1. Layout-level logic locking\n–\nWe propose a novel locking scheme, called TroLLoc, devised to hinder post-design Trojan\ninsertion.\nTogether with the IC security-closure flow, TroLLoc meets important challenges for Trojan defenses:\nit is robust, effective, and efficient. See further below for an explanation of these achievements. IC security-closure flow –\nWe devise an EDA flow for design-time security closure against post-design Trojan insertion.\nThe flow serves to implement the proposed TroLLoc scheme and is fully integrated\ninto a commercial-grade physical-synthesis setup. Layout and security analysis –\nWe conduct a set of thorough case studies that show the promises of the proposed scheme.\nToward that end, we are using the real-world benchmark suites from the recent ISPD’22/23 contests on security closure  .\nWe are employing a set of SOTA attacks on locking,\nnamely MuxLink , OMLA , Resynthesis , and SCOPE ,\nand we also conduct\nactual Trojan insertion as in , both to demonstrate the resilience of the proposed scheme against advanced Trojan attacks. Release –\nWe release our secured layouts in , to\nenable independent verification of our work.\nWe will also release our method in full, post peer-review. Our work on proactive, pre-silicon Trojan prevention is (i) robust, (ii) effective, and (iii) efficient.\nRegarding (i),\nwe show that advanced adversaries employing (a) second-order attacks using SOTA machine learning (ML)-based attacks on locking or (b) actual Trojan insertion are both hindered.\nThis is a first time in the literature.\nRegarding (ii), also for the first time, we harden IC layouts against Trojan insertion in general and further protect security-sensitive assets in particular.\nRegarding (iii), again for the first time, we employ both locking and layout hardening in unison, along with commercial-grade tooling for full control on the security-vs-overhead trade-offs in a real-world IC\ndesign and manufacturing setting.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: varying scale and complexity are at the heart of all our modern-day information systems.\nAn ever-growing body of security threats can compromise information systems in general\nand ICs in particular  [ref]4 [ref]5.\nFor the design, manufacturing, and deployment of ICs,\nthere are numerous companies and partners involved within complex and world-wide supply chains—ICs run\nthrough many hands, where\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
