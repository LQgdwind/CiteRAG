      "content": "Paper Title: NDF: Neural Deformable Fields for Dynamic Human Modelling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nVision-based human performance capture has seen great progress in recent years due to fast development in both hardware and reconstruction algorithms like novel learning-based representation. It enables a wide variety of applications such as tele-presence, sportscast, and mixed reality. The enduring pandemic restricts our travel and public activities, which makes human performance digitization a research topic with great social and economic implications. Human performance digitization can be roughly divided into human performance capture and human animation.\nTraditionally, to achieve high-fidelity human performance capture including geometry and texture reconstruction, dense camera rigs    and controlled lighting conditions [ref]2 [ref]6 are required. These systems are extremely bulky and expensive, which limits their popularity. Nevertheless, these conventional capture systems could still fail under multi-person scenarios due to severe occlusion, which leads to ambiguity in appearance, pose, and motion sampling. After performance capture, human animation requires skilled artists to manually create a skeleton suitable for the human model and carefully design skinning weights  to achieve realistic animation, which requires countless human labor. This paper aims to reduce the cost and improve the flexibility of human performance digitization. Many recent works have investigated the potential of neural implicit fields in novel view synthesis. NeRF  proposed a neural implicit representation that can be effectively learned from multi-view images. The neural implicit representation is rendered to realistic images from novel views with volume rendering. However, NeRF has a high requirement for the camera numbers and it can only model a static scene which does not apply to multi-view videos of dynamic humans. To extend NeRF to dynamic scenes, an effective idea is to aggregate all observations over different video frames  [ref]26    . D-NeRF [ref]26 and Nerfies  decompose a reconstruction into a canonical neural radiance field and a set of deformation fields that transform points in observation space to canonical space. To further simplify the learning of the deformation fields, Animatable NeRF  resorts to a parametric human body model as a strong geometry prior to the deformation fields. However, we claim that the current design of a shared canonical space and deformation fields prevents these methods from learning large movements and detailed geometry changes such as wrinkles of clothes as shown in the experiment. To solve the above problems, rather than learning shared canonical neural radiance fields from multi-view videos, we use Neural Deformable Fields (NDF) to represent a dynamic scene. Specifically, we unwrap observation space to NDF space using the surface of a parametric body model as reference. NDF space is automatically aligned across frames and we further adopt the skeletal pose as posterior condition to model the dynamic changes. As a result, NDF space is more compact than the original observation space and it can model the dynamic changes caused by different poses. After training, we are able to animate the performer to different views and poses with a high degree of realism. We evaluate our method on ZJU-MoCap  and DynaCap  datasets that capture dynamic humans in complex motions with synchronized cameras. The results show that our method can achieve high-fidelity reconstructions, especially for realistic dynamic changes in novel pose synthesis. The code is avaliable at https://github.com/HKBU-VSComputing/2022_ECCV_NDF. In summary, the contributions of this paper are following: We propose a compact novel representation called NDF, which can model the dynamic changes caused by different poses. The experiment results demonstrate significant improvement on the novel pose synthesis task, especially the detailed and realistic dynamic changes caused by different poses.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: capture and human animation.\nTraditionally, to achieve high-fidelity human performance capture including geometry and texture reconstruction, dense camera rigs    and controlled lighting conditions [ref]2 [ref]6 are required.
