Brunina et al.   introduce the concept of optically connected memory in a mesh topology connected with optical switches. Both works propose point-to-point direct access to the DRAM modules using Mach Zender modulators. These works motivate our study in optically connected memory.\nBrunina et al.  also experimentally demonstrate that microring modulators can be used for optically connecting DDR2 memory. Our work builds on  to design the microring modulators used in our SiP links. There are several recent works    that propose analytical models of the microring used in our SiP links.\nAnderson et al.¬† extend the work of Brunina et al.    to experimentally demonstrate the optical switches using FPGAs for accessing memory.\n These prior works     are all experimental demonstrations to show photonic capabilities. In contrast, our work addresses three important questions prior work does not: (1) How many optical devices (i.e., MRRs) do we need for current DDR technology? (Section IV-B), (2) What is the energy and area impact on the system? (Section IV-B), and (3) How does the processor interact with a disaggregated memory subsystem? (Section IV-A). Some other works, such as 6 , point out, without evaluation, that existing disaggregation protocols (i.e., PCIe and Ethernet) could lead to high-performance loss. Our work uses system-level simulation to measure the performance overhead of such protocols. We propose to alleviate the optical serialization overhead by using the DDR protocol (Section¬†III-A).\nAs photonic integration improves, we believe that the optical point-to-point links will become the main candidate for interconnecting disaggregated memory. With our PhoenixSim 0 model, we explore the design of SiP links based on DDR requirements. Our proposal can be used to improve existing PCIe+photonics works, such as 7. Yan et al.¬†7 propose a PCIe Switch and Interface Card (SIC) to replace Network Interface Cards (NIC) for disaggregation. SIC is composed of commercial optical devices and is capable of interconnecting server blades in disaggregated data centers. The evaluated SIC shows a total roundtrip latency up to 426 ns. In contrast, the scope of our work is point-to-point DDR DRAM disaggregation without PCIe or other additional protocols. Other related prior works (1) explore silicon photonics integration with a many-core chip in an optical network-on-chip design¬†[ref]10, (2) propose the design of a DRAM chip with photonic inter-bank communication¬†, (3) present an optoelectronic chip for communication in disaggregated systems with 4-ŒªùúÜ\\lambda and an energy consumption of 3.4 pJ/bit¬†, (4) evaluate a memory disaggregation architecture with optical switches focusing on re-allocation mechanisms , (5) analyze the cost viability of optical memory disaggregation¬†, and (6) evaluate memory disaggregation using software mechanisms with high latency penalties in the order of Œºùúá\\mus 8. Unlike     8, our work evaluates i) system performance with real applications, ii) the design of the SiP link for DDR DRAM requirements, and iii) SiP link energy for a disaggregated memory system.\n\nReference markers found: [10]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]10: DDR DRAM disaggregation without PCIe or other additional protocols.
