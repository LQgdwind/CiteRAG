      "content": "Paper Title: DIVINE: Diverse Influential Training Points for Data Visualization and Model Refinement\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTraining point importance is a useful form of explainability for practitioners when reasoning about a machine learning (ML) model‚Äôs behavior¬†[ref]28.\nThis form of explanation identifies which training points are most important to a ML model\n¬† [ref]31 .\nTo compute training point importance, popular methods include calculating Data Shapley values¬†  or using\ninfluence functions\nto estimate the impact to the model of dropping one or more points from training data¬†[ref]31 .\nHowever, the top-mùëöm most important points returned by these methods are often redundant, in the sense that several may be very similar, limiting the extent of explanation provided¬† .\nTo address this shortcoming, we devise an approach for selecting a set of DIVINE (DIVerse INfluEntial) training points.\n Figure¬†1(a) shows that the top-555 influential points with respect to the approximate leave-one-out estimate of¬†Koh and Liang [ref]31 and with respect to Data Shapley¬† are all located in a small vicinity (red and blue diamonds respectively).\nDue to this lack of diversity, practitioners may miss key insights from underrepresented data points.\nSome regions, such as the cluster of points in the top left corner, are ignored by both methods.\nIn Figure¬†1(a), our DIVINE points, denoted by yellow circles, not only lie in regions of high influence but also across the feature space.\nOur method provides the flexibility, under a common assumption, to operate on top of training point importance scores from a wide range of methods, including Data Shapley (DS)¬† and influence functions (IF)¬†[ref]31.\nBeyond the synthetic setting of Figure¬†1(a), consider a misclassified test point, as in Figure¬†1(c). The influential training points according to two competitive methods (Influence¬†[ref]31 and RelatIF¬†) are very similar to the test point. The resulting explanation contains redundant information. A explanation containing diverse points is more useful: notice the coat that appears in the DIVINE points but not in the others.\nOur user studies (Section¬†6) show that this additional diversity allows practitioners to be more accurate in simulating model behavior and enhances trustworthiness in the model. Moreover, existing methods for training point importance focus on the impact of a data point on loss or accuracy, but practitioners may also want to value data points with respect to other important metrics, such as fairness.\nTo bridge this gap, we develop an efficient method for computing importance scores with respect to group fairness metrics¬†[ref]24. Practitioners can use these scores to visualize data points that harm model fairness.\nWe describe how to refine a model and improve fairness outcomes by removing unfairness-inducing points, while minimizing impact on other metrics. Our main contributions are: We devise a method for finding a diverse set of training points that are influential to a model.\nOur top mùëöm DIVINE points, when trading off influence with diversity objectives, can provide a more comprehensive overview of model behavior (Section¬†3).\n We discuss how to value a training point‚Äôs influence on group fairness metrics (Section¬†4). Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that DIVINE can help explore diverse, influential regions of the feature space and can also help improve fairness in the model outcomes by identifying most unfairness inducing points (Section¬†5). Extensive user studies show that DIVINE leads to enhanced user trust and better task simulatability as compared to existing approaches (Section¬†6).\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: Training point importance is a useful form of explainability for practitioners when reasoning about a machine learning (ML) model‚Äôs behavior¬†[ref]28.\nThis form of explanation identifies which training points are most important to a ML model\n¬† [ref]31 .\nTo compute training point importance, popular methods include calculating Data Shapley\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
