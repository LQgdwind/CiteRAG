      "content": "Paper Title: TCJA-SNN: Temporal-Channel Joint Attention for Spiking Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSpiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising research area, offering lower energy consumption and superior robustness compared to conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)  [ref]2. These characteristics make SNNs highly promising for temporal data processing and power-critical applications  . In recent years, significant progress has been made by incorporating backpropagation into SNNs      , which allows the integration of various ANN modules into SNN architectures, including batch normalization blocks [ref]9 and residual blocks 0. By leveraging these ANN-based methods, it becomes possible to train large-scale SNNs while preserving the energy efficiency associated with SNN’s binary spiking nature. Despite significant progress, SNNs have yet to fully exploit the superior representational capability of deep learning, primarily due to their unique training mode, which struggles to model complex channel-temporal relationships effectively. Addressing this limitation, Zheng et al. [ref]9 introduced a batch normalization method for the temporal dimension, overcoming issues of gradient vanishing and threshold-input balance. On the other hand, Wu et al. 1 proposed a method named NeuNorm to address the channel-wise challenges. NeuNorm includes an auxiliary neuron that adjusts the stimulus strength generated by the preceding layer, enhancing performance while mimicking the activity of the retina and nearby cells for added bio-plausibility. However, existing methods handle temporal and channel information separately, leading to limited joint information extraction. Given that SNNs reuse network parameters at each time step, there exists untapped potential for recalibration at both the temporal and channel dimensions. Especially, TA-SNN proposed by Yao et al. 2. Previous studies in ANNs 3 4 have often utilized the attention mechanism as a means to address the challenges posed by multidimensional dynamic problems. The attention mechanism, inspired by human cognitive processes, enables the selective focus on relevant information while disregarding irrelevant data. This approach has shown promise in the realm of SNNs and merits further exploration 2. For instance, in the domain of neuroscience, an attention-based Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) SNN was proposed by Bernert et al.5 to tackle the spike-sorting problem. Furthermore, Yao et al.2 incorporated a channel attention block into the temporal-wise input of an SNN, as depicted in Fig. 1-a, enabling the assessment of frame significance during training and the exclusion of irrelevant frames during inference. Despite employing attention solely in the temporal dimension, this attention mechanism significantly improves the network’s performance. In this paper, we involve both temporal and channel attention mechanisms\nin SNNs, which is implemented by efficient 1-D convolution; Fig. 1-b shows the whole structure, we argue that this cooperative mechanism can enhance the discrimination of the learned features, and can make the temporal-channel learning in SNNs becomes more easier. The main contribution of this work can be summarized as follows: We introduce a plug-and-play block into SNNs by considering the temporal and channel attentions cooperatively, which model temporal and channel information in the same phase, achieving better adaptability and bio-interpretability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate the temporal-channel attention mechanism into the most extensively used model, LIF-based SNNs. A Cross Convolutional Fusion (CCF) operation with a cross-receptive field is proposed to make use of the associated information. It not only uses the benefit of convolution to minimize parameters but also integrates features from both temporal and channel dimensions in an efficient fashion. Experimental results show that TCJA-SNN outperforms previous methods on static and neuromorphic datasets for classification tasks. It also performs well in generation tasks. Notably, our model achieves an impressive 82.5% test accuracy on the N-Caltech 101 dataset, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art accuracy of 66.8% by a substantial margin.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising research area, offering lower energy consumption and superior robustness compared to conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)  [ref]2.
