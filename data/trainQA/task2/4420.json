      "content": "Paper Title: SSBNet: Improving Visual Recognition Efficiency by Adaptive Sampling\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn the main paper, we referred to adaptive sampling as the methods that perform geometric samplings or transformations on the images or feature maps, where the samplings or transformations depend on the inputs. Examples of adaptive sampling methods include spatial transformer [ref]11 and saliency sampler . There are also approaches that adaptively skip the inference on individual units, such as pixels or blocks, to reduce the latency. For example, the stochastic sampling-interpolation network  samples pixels for inference, where the SBNet [ref]22 selects blocks. In table 5, we provided preliminary comparison results between SSBNet and the stochastic sampling-interpolation network  (referred to as SSIN for abbreviation), a recently proposed adaptive inference network. Following the same setting as the main paper, we trained SSBNet and SSIN based on ResNet-D-50[ref]8 on ImageNet. For SSIN, instead of the standard 120 epochs of training, we trained the models with 200 epochs, following the original paper which used a longer training for the adaptive networks. We reported results of SSIN with loss weight ŒªùúÜ\\lambda of {0.001, 0.005, 0.010, 0.015}. In our experiments, SSB-ResNet-D-50 achieved better accuracy than SSIN. Notice that in the SSIN paper, the authors trained ResNet34 for their experiments, where we utilized ResNet-D-50, which is a deeper and improved version of ResNet. The performance drop of SSIN reported here indicates that it may not fit the more complicated network and training scheme used in this paper. Compared to the baseline, the SSB-ResNet-D-50 has no drop in accuracy but with 30% less FLOPS.\n\nReference markers found: [11]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]11: geometric samplings or transformations on the images or feature maps, where the samplings or transformations depend on the inputs.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
