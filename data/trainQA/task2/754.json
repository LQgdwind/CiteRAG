MCU data flow scheduling tools show similarities to frameworks such as DMazeRunner, as both target the optimization of a dataflow schedule given an externally known architecture. However, the MCU scenario also imposes some additional unique challenges, such as the fact that DNN execution has to be adapted to a general-purpose architecture and the small amount of memory that MCU platforms include.\nFurther, the kernel instructions are heavily influenced by the limited size of the register file, which causes additional load-store operations and thus demand for an optimal loop sizing to avoid register spilling overhead.\nAcademic researchers and industries have significantly investigated this aspect by including in their edge-node solutions either specialized caches (e.g., NXP 555https://www.nxp.com/products/processors-and-microcontrollers/arm-microcontrollers/general-purpose-mcus/lpc4300-cortex-m4-m0) or explicitly managed scratchpad memories (e.g., GWT ).\n\nReference markers found: [26]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]26: bottleneck.\nIn Table I, we report different methods for data flow scheduling and generation that cover three broad classes of devices, namely high-performance computing systems , DNN accelerators  [ref]26  , and embedded systems  .\nFor what concerns high-performance computing systems,  propose new transformer primitives to exploit data reuse and limit data movement by fusing pointwise\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
