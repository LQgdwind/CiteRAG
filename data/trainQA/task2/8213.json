Prior attempts, commonly referred to as Spiking ResNets[ref]24, have largely replicated the architecture of ResNet[ref]23 by replacing ReLU activation functions with spiking neurons. However, this approach presents certain limitations: Inability to achieve identity mapping across neuron models: Residual learning is predicated on the concept of identity mapping, where layers can be trained to approximate an identity function. While this is straightforward in ResNets[ref]23 with ReLU activation, it is not always feasible in Spiking ResNets[ref]24. Specifically,  claimed that for certain spiking neuron models, such as leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons with learnable membrane time constants, ensuring that a spiking neuron fires in response to an input spike becomes challenging. This complicates the realization of identity mapping. Vanishing/exploding gradients: Even in cases where identity mapping can be achieved, Spiking ResNets[ref]24 are prone to vanishing or exploding gradients during training. This occurs because the gradient propagation through multiple layers of spiking neurons may either diminish to zero or grow uncontrollably, complicating the training of deeper networks. To address these issues, SEW ResNet was introduced as a replacement design for residual blocks while utilizing IF neurons. The SEW block capitalizes on the binary nature of spikes by applying element-wise functions gùëîg to the output of the residual mapping Al‚Äã[t]subscriptùê¥ùëôdelimited-[]ùë°A_{l}[t] and the input spike train Sl‚Äã[t]subscriptùëÜùëôdelimited-[]ùë°S_{l}[t]. This approach facilitates identity mapping, mitigates the vanishing/exploding gradient problem and achieves higher accuracy with fewer time steps compared to existing SNN models. With these advantages in mind, we have decide to choose (but not limited to) SEW Resnet architecture as our main experimenting architecture.\n\nReference markers found: [23]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]23: The success of ResNet[ref]23 in deep learning has motivated efforts to extend residual learning to SNN.
