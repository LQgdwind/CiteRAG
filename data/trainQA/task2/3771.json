      "content": "Paper Title: Mitigating Bias in Facial Analysis Systems by Incorporating Label Diversity\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nEven though attractiveness has a considerable influence over our lives, which characteristics make a particular face attractive is imperfectly defined.\nIn modern days a common notion is that judgments of beauty are a matter of subjective opinion.\nHowever, it has been shown that there is a very high agreement between groups of raters belonging to the same culture and even across cultures  , and that people might share a common taste for facial attractiveness .\nThus, if different people can agree on which faces are attractive and which faces are not attractive when judging faces of different ethnic backgrounds, then this indicates that people all around the globe use similar features or criteria when making up their judgments. The earliest facial attractiveness predictors are based on traditional machine learning methods.\nAs well as for other computer vision tasks, deep learning brought great performance improvements for facial beauty assessment  .\nHowever, as recently demonstrated [ref]12 [ref]11, these approaches were shown to discriminate against certain groups.\nSome pre-processing approaches were proposed to mitigate such behavior.\nFor instance, in the work of Sattigeri et al. [ref]11, the authors use a generative model to create a dataset that is similar to a given dataset, but results in a model that is more fair with respect to protected attributes.\nAnother example is the work of Ramaswamy et al. [ref]12, which modifies the generative model to create new instances by independently altering specific attributes (e.g. removing glasses).\nBoth works expand the training dataset from 2 to 3 ×\\times its original size. In this work, to extract the so-called objective annotations of the attractiveness based on facial traits, we follow the work of Schmid et al.  and use three predictors that have been proposed in literature, and were empirically shown to correlate with human attractiveness ratings: Neoclassical Canons, Face Symmetry, and Golden Ratios.\nNeoclassical canons were proposed by artists in the renaissance period as guides for drawing beautiful faces .\nThe basic idea behind this definition is that the proportion of an attractive face should follow some predefined ratios.\nFacial symmetry has been shown as an important factor for attractiveness .\nIt has many different definitions    , but it generally refers to the extent that one half of an image (e.g., face) is the same as the other half.\nIn our work, we follow the definition presented in the work of Schmid et al. , which define the axis of symmetry to be located vertically at the middle of the face.\nFinally, the golden ratio theory defines that faces that have features with ratios close to the golden ratio proportion are perceived as more attractive .\nThe golden ratio is approximately the ratio of 1.6181.6181.618 .\nWe refer to the work of Schmid et al.  for additional details on the methods used in this work.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: machine learning methods.\nAs well as for other computer vision tasks, deep learning brought great performance improvements for facial beauty assessment  .\nHowever, as recently demonstrated [ref]12 [ref]11, these approaches were shown to discriminate against certain groups.\nSome pre-processing approaches were proposed to mitigate such behavior.\nFor instance, in the work of Sattigeri et\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5. Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"citations\": [\n        {\n            \"ref_index\": 38,\n            \"titles\": [\n                \"Reference Title 1\",\n                \"Reference Title 2\",\n                \"Reference Title 3\",\n                \"Reference Title 4\",\n                \"Reference Title 40\"\n            ],\n            \"reasoning\": \"Detailed explanation of why these titles are relevant to [ref]38 based on the surrounding context, research area, and specific topic being discussed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object.
