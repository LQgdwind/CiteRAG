      "content": "Paper Title: Constructing Bayesian Pseudo-Coresets using Contrastive Divergence\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWhile coreset methods select a diverse and rich subset of data points from the training set, the basic heuristics used for subset selection often produce suboptimal results. To overcome this barrier  proposed Dataset Distillation to ‘learn’ a set of informative synthetic samples from a large dataset. Rather than selecting a subset of datapoints from the training set, these methods create an artificial dataset with a lower cardinality that, when trained independently, produces accuracy comparable to the original model. In particular, the authors of  learn a model by using the synthetic set and test the model on original dataset. The synthetic set is optimized to improve the performance of the model on the original dataset. further extended this idea by generating multiple synthetic dataset for training but with limited storage capacity. Inspired by these works,  proposed gradient matching where the authors proposed to learn the synthetic samples by aligning the gradients of models trained using original dataset and the synthetic dataset. Despite the simplicity of gradient matching, it treats the gradients of each class independently, hence neglecting the class-discriminative features. To ensure that efficient gradients are calculated during the training process, some studies    have proposed different gradient comparison metrics that penalise the model for overfitting on the small dataset. Further,  proposed differentiable siamese augmentation to avoid overfitting and boost the performance of any dataset condensation method in general. Further, methods like   attempt to directly optimize the validation loss over samples of original dataset using the optimal parameters generated by the synthetic dataset. The validation loss is backpropagated through the unrolled gradient descent steps used for finding the optimal parameters. The overall idea is similar to that of meta-learning , where a bi-level optimization is performed to optimize (outer-loop) the meta-test loss in the original dataset using a model that has been meta-trained (inner-loop) on synthetic data. However, the computation graph for such methods increases with the number of steps in the inner-loop, which is computationally expensive and requires large GPU memory.\nTo overcome this bottleneck, there have been methods that try to reduce the computational burden due to inner-loop. For eg. [ref]37 proposes to approximate the inner-loop optimization by a convex optimization problem which can be solved using kernel ridge regression (KRR). [ref]37 uses a neural tangent kernel (NTK)  to perform KRR. Further, to reduce the complexity involved in computing NTK,  uses a neural network gaussian process kernel instead. Further,  proposes to decompose the network optimized in the inner-loop into a feature-extractor and a linear classifier; they show that it is enough to update the linear classifier in the inner-loop while the feature extractor can be updated on synthetic set separately. Contrary to bi-level optimization approaches that focus on short-horizon inner-loop trajectories,  proposes to focus on long-horizon trajectories, ensuring that the models learn comparable trajectories during optimization for both the synthetic set and the original dataset. To do this, the parameters of the model generated during training with synthetic data and with the original data are compared at different epochs. As a follow-up work,  showed that matching all the parameters has a negative impact on the performance of the model and the performance can be boosted by comparing a pruned set of parameters. Similarly,  proposed a regularizer to reduce the accumulated error in the long horizon trajectories.\nHowever, even though the trajectory based methods show high performance on several datasets, they suffer from same issues as that of meta-learning methods, i.e, the computational graph of such methods can be very large, leading to a high GPU memory requirement. While the above mentioned methods resort to bi-level optimization to learn the synthetic set, Distribution Matching methods [ref]52 [ref]45  try to generate a condensed synthetic set with a similar feature distribution as the original dataset, hence, completely avoiding the bi-level optimization.\nFor eg. [ref]52 proposed to use maximal mean discrepancy (MMD) to match the distribution of the synthetic dataset with the original dataset using the classifier layer without the last linear layer. [ref]45 further proposed CAFE to match feature statistics of different layers and used a discriminator to maximise the probability for a given class.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: which is computationally expensive and requires large GPU memory.\nTo overcome this bottleneck, there have been methods that try to reduce the computational burden due to inner-loop.
