      "content": "Paper Title: Veni, Vidi, Vici: Solving the Myriad of Challenges before Knowledge Graph Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe first general approach to explainability is to provide a post-hoc explanation of a KG learning system that is not explainable by design, such as TransE , RDF2vec , or SL-DSGCN . Methods for post-hoc interpretability of KGEs are generally based on estimating the influence of a triple on a given prediction . This includes various Instance Attribution Methods such as Influence Functions and Instance and Gradient Similarity computation [ref]39. For GNNs, many post-hoc explanation systems are not GNN-specific  , although some, such as GNNExplainer, PGExplainer, and GraphMask explicitly take advantage of the triple-based structure of graphs to identify the most important triples for a prediction . More detailed analyses can be found in   . The second approach is to create models that are explainable by design. This includes rule-based models such as AMIE+ and DL-Learner, which use symbolic logic to infer rules that are used to predict new statements in a graph  [ref]8. Since those rules are written in human-readable logical clauses, they are direct explanations for the models’ predictions. Models such as PoLo also fall in this category: it uses expert-curated rules (in the form of meta-paths) to create a policy-based model able to predict new triples .\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: based on estimating the influence of a triple on a given prediction .

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
