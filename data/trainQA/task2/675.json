      "content": "Paper Title: Twin-width III: Max Independent Set, Min Dominating Set, and Coloring\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs the title suggests, this is the third paper of a series [ref]5 [ref]4 devoted to a new graph invariant called twin-width.\nAll the results presented in this paper are self-contained as the relevant background is given in Section 2.\nIn the same section, the reader can find the definitions of contraction sequences and twin-width.\nFor now, we are content with some intuition on these notions.\nThis will be enough to sketch the ideas and techniques leading to our results, while sparing this introduction from too much formalism. The twin-width of a graph is a non-negative integer measuring its distance to being a cograph.\nAmong the several characterizations of cographs, a possible definition goes as follows.\nA graph is a cograph if one can find therein two twins,111i.e., two vertices with the same neighborhood beside them identify them, and iterate this process until there is only one vertex left.\nAnticipating over the definitions of Section 2, this actually corresponds to a 0-sequence, witnessing that cographs have twin-width 0.\nConversely it is also true that graphs with twin-width 0 are cographs.\nWe generalize this identification process by allowing a controlled error on the contracted pairs of vertices.\nAn error graph or red graph keeps the faulty adjacencies appearing between a contracted pair and the vertices that are neighbor of only one vertex of the pair.\nA d𝑑d-sequence is an indentification or contraction sequence such that the maximum degree of the error graph never exceeds d𝑑d.\nThe existence of such a sequence entails that the initial graph has twin-width at most d𝑑d. As it turns out, many graph classes have bounded twin-width: planar graphs and more generally proper minor-closed classes, bounded rank-width or clique-width graphs, proper hereditary subclasses of permutation graphs, unit interval graphs, and some particular class of cubic expanders, to name only a few.222A more exhaustive list is given in Theorem 2.1.\nConsidering the wide variety of these classes, it might seem that our cograph generalization has gone too far to allow for a unified algorithmic treatment of bounded twin-width graphs.\nThe first paper of the series [ref]5 and the current one show that this is not the case.\nAlgorithms, whose running times are provably unattainable in general graphs, are actually possible in graphs of bounded twin-width.\nWe will now detail that point. After defining any graph parameter κ𝜅\\kappa, a natural question is whether some computationally hard problems can be solved more efficiently on graphs where κ𝜅\\kappa is bounded.\nWhen this turns out to be the case for several problems, it may sometimes lead to a powerful meta-theorem.\nA standard way of capturing a large set of problems within the same framework is through the use of logic formulas over graphs, or more generally over relational structures.\nIn the language of parameterized algorithms, one may ask for the existence of a Fixed-Parameter Tractable (FPT) algorithm parameterized by κ𝜅\\kappa and the size of the graph formula φ𝜑\\varphi to be tested: More precisely, an algorithm deciding in time f​(|φ|,κ​(G))​nO​(1)𝑓𝜑𝜅𝐺superscript𝑛𝑂1f(|\\varphi|,\\kappa(G))n^{O(1)}, or better f​(|φ|,κ​(G))​n𝑓𝜑𝜅𝐺𝑛f(|\\varphi|,\\kappa(G))n, whether an n𝑛n-vertex graph G𝐺G satisfies φ𝜑\\varphi, where f𝑓f is some computable function.\nCertainly the most famous result of that kind is the celebrated Courcelle’s theorem, where the parameter κ𝜅\\kappa is tree-width, and the formula φ𝜑\\varphi ranges over Monadic Second Order logic (MSO2) formulas .\nOn a slightly less general logic (namely MSO1, where quantification over edge sets is disallowed), the result holds for the smaller parameter clique-width .\nIt implies, for instance, that deciding whether a graph on n𝑛n vertices contains a subset of k𝑘k pairwise non-adjacent vertices (i.e., solving k𝑘k-Independent Set) can be done in linear time on graphs of constant clique-width, while in general graphs it cannot be solved in polynomial time unless P==NP, or in time f​(k)​nO​(1)𝑓𝑘superscript𝑛𝑂1f(k)n^{O(1)} unless FPT==W.\nSuch a result is unlikely for twin-width, as k𝑘k-Independent Set remains NP-hard in planar graphs which have constant twin-width.\nNevertheless, when parameterized by the solution size k𝑘k, an FPT algorithm is known in planar graphs, and more generally in any proper minor-closed graph class.\nActually, on the latter class, every problem expressible by a first-order (FO) formula φ𝜑\\varphi can be solved in FPT time parameterized by |φ|𝜑|\\varphi| .\nIn the first paper of our series [ref]5, we extended this result and obtained the following meta-theorem for twin-width. [ref]5\nGiven an n𝑛n-vertex graph G𝐺G, a d𝑑d-sequence of G𝐺G, and a first-order formula φ𝜑\\varphi, one can decide G⊧φmodels𝐺𝜑G\\models\\varphi in time f​(|φ|,d)​n𝑓𝜑𝑑𝑛f(|\\varphi|,d)n for some computable function f𝑓f. The main drawback of this kind of algorithms is the obtained running time: The function f𝑓f is a tower of exponentials whose height depends on the size of the formula.\nThis is an unavoidable price to pay to solve at once all graph problems expressible in first-order logic.\nIndeed, it is known that testing first-order formulas on trees requires a running time whose dependence in the size of the formula is a non-elementary function, unless P == NP .\nFurthermore the running time of our FO model checking algorithm does not get better on “seemingly simpler” formulas, such as for instance, with few quantifier alternations.\n\nReference markers found: [5]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]5: As the title suggests, this is the third paper of a series [ref]5 [ref]4 devoted to a new graph invariant called twin-width.\nAll the results presented in this paper are self-contained as the relevant background is given in Section 2.\nIn the same section, the\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
