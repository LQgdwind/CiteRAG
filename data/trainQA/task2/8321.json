      "content": "Paper Title: Locally Sampleable Uniform Symmetric Distributions\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDespite being one of the simplest models of computation, 𝖭𝖢𝟢superscript𝖭𝖢0\\mathsf{NC^{0}} circuits (i.e., Boolean circuits of constant depth and bounded fan-in) elude a comprehensive understanding. Even very recently, the model has been the subject of active research on the range avoidance problem   , quantum advantages     , proof verification [ref]17 [ref]4 , and more. Pertinent to this paper is the study of the sampling power of 𝖭𝖢𝟢superscript𝖭𝖢0\\mathsf{NC^{0}} circuits. While the general problem was considered at least as early as , interest in the 𝖭𝖢𝟢superscript𝖭𝖢0\\mathsf{NC^{0}} setting has seen a strong uptick lately    [ref]15        .\nAt a high level, it considers what distributions can be (approximately) produced by simple functions on random inputs. More formally, let f​(𝒰m)𝑓superscript𝒰𝑚f(\\mathcal{U}^{m}) denote the distribution resulting from applying an 𝖭𝖢𝟢superscript𝖭𝖢0\\mathsf{NC^{0}} function f:{0,1}m→{0,1}n:𝑓→superscript01𝑚superscript01𝑛f\\colon\\{0,1\\}^{m}\\to\\{0,1\\}^{n} to a random string drawn from 𝒰msuperscript𝒰𝑚\\mathcal{U}^{m}, the uniform distribution over {0,1}msuperscript01𝑚\\{0,1\\}^{m}. Typically, m𝑚m is viewed as being arbitrarily large and n𝑛n is the parameter of interest. Then the goal is to analyze the distance between f​(𝒰m)𝑓superscript𝒰𝑚f(\\mathcal{U}^{m}) and some specific distribution. Aside from being inherently interesting, this question has also played a crucial role in applications ranging from data structure lower bounds        to pseudorandom generators    to extractors  [ref]15    to coding theory . One recurring class of distributions in this line of work is uniform symmetric distributions (i.e., uniform distributions over a symmetric support). Indeed, these are precisely the distributions that arise in an elegant connection to succinct data structures (see [38, Claim 1.8]), for example. Moreover, this seemingly simple class is already rich enough to allow surprisingly powerful results. For example, 𝖭𝖢𝟢superscript𝖭𝖢0\\mathsf{NC^{0}} circuits can sample the uniform distribution over the preimage PARITY−1​(0)superscriptPARITY10\\mathrm{PARITY}^{-1}(0) (and PARITY−1​(1)superscriptPARITY11\\mathrm{PARITY}^{-1}(1)), despite a celebrated result of Håstad  proving that more powerful 𝖠𝖢𝟢superscript𝖠𝖢0\\mathsf{AC^{0}} circuits require an exponential number of gates to compute PARITYPARITY\\mathrm{PARITY}. Perhaps more surprisingly, the strategy to sample a uniform random string with even Hamming weight is extremely simple: map the uniform random bits x1,…,xnsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑛x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n} to x1⊕x2,x2⊕x3,…,xn⊕x1direct-sumsubscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2direct-sumsubscript𝑥2subscript𝑥3…direct-sumsubscript𝑥𝑛subscript𝑥1x_{1}\\oplus x_{2},x_{2}\\oplus x_{3},\\ldots,x_{n}\\oplus x_{1}  . A number of notable prior results already rule out specific distributions from being accurately sampled by 𝖭𝖢𝟢superscript𝖭𝖢0\\mathsf{NC^{0}} circuits. For example, let 𝒟ksubscript𝒟𝑘\\mathcal{D}_{k} denote the uniform distribution over all n𝑛n-bit strings of Hamming weight k𝑘k. The influential early paper of  showed that such shallow circuits could not accurately sample 𝒟ksubscript𝒟𝑘\\mathcal{D}_{k} for k=Θ​(n)𝑘Θ𝑛k=\\Theta(n) under certain assumptions about the input length or accuracy tolerance; recent works    have eliminated the need for these assumptions. Additionally, a number of results are known for uniform symmetric distributions over multiple Hamming weights, such as the case of exclusively tail weights , all weights divisible by q𝑞q for fixed 3≤q≪n3𝑞much-less-than𝑛3\\leq q\\ll\\sqrt{n} , and all weights above n/2𝑛2n/2 [ref]17   (see also ). Despite much effort, the previous body of work proceeds in a somewhat ad-hoc fashion, with techniques tailored to rule out specific cases. However, an exciting recent work by Filmus, Leigh, Riazanov, and Sokolov  gave the following bold conjecture about the capabilities of 𝖭𝖢𝟢superscript𝖭𝖢0\\mathsf{NC^{0}} circuits for sampling distributions, unifying prior results. Let f:{0,1}m→{0,1}n:𝑓→superscript01𝑚superscript01𝑛f\\colon\\{0,1\\}^{m}\\to\\{0,1\\}^{n} be computable by an 𝖭𝖢𝟢superscript𝖭𝖢0\\mathsf{NC^{0}} circuit.\nIf f​(𝒰m)𝑓superscript𝒰𝑚f(\\mathcal{U}^{m}) is ε𝜀\\varepsilon-close (in total variation distance) to a uniform symmetric distribution and n𝑛n is sufficiently large, then f​(𝒰m)𝑓superscript𝒰𝑚f(\\mathcal{U}^{m}) is O​(ε)𝑂𝜀O(\\varepsilon)-close to one of the following six distributions: Point distribution on 0nsuperscript0𝑛0^{n}. Point distribution on 1nsuperscript1𝑛1^{n}. Uniform distribution over {0n,1n}superscript0𝑛superscript1𝑛\\left\\{0^{n},1^{n}\\right\\}. Uniform distribution over strings with even Hamming weights. Uniform distribution over strings with odd Hamming weights. Uniform distribution over all strings. All six distributions can be sampled (exactly) by functions whose output bits each depend on at most two input bits. Hence one may informally view the conjecture as asserting that more input dependencies do not substantially increase the ability of 𝖭𝖢𝟢superscript𝖭𝖢0\\mathsf{NC^{0}} circuits to generate uniform symmetric distributions. In this work, we confirm the conjecture of  as follows. Let d𝑑d be a fixed constant, and suppose f:{0,1}m→{0,1}n:𝑓→superscript01𝑚superscript01𝑛f\\colon\\{0,1\\}^{m}\\to\\{0,1\\}^{n} is computable by an 𝖭𝖢𝟢superscript𝖭𝖢0\\mathsf{NC^{0}} circuit of depth at most d𝑑d. If f​(𝒰m)𝑓superscript𝒰𝑚f(\\mathcal{U}^{m}) is ε𝜀\\varepsilon-close (in total variation distance) to a uniform symmetric distribution and n𝑛n is sufficiently large, then f​(𝒰m)𝑓superscript𝒰𝑚f(\\mathcal{U}^{m}) is O​(ε)𝑂𝜀O(\\varepsilon)-close to one of the six distributions in 1.1. Note that this result is optimal up to the implicit constant in O​(ε)𝑂𝜀O(\\varepsilon). We include a more thorough discussion of our result’s tightness in Section 4, where we present a quantitative version of Theorem 1.2 parametrized by the locality (i.e., number of input bits each output bit depends on) of f𝑓f. The following corollary is immediate. For sufficiently large n𝑛n, the only uniform symmetric distributions over {0,1}nsuperscript01𝑛\\{0,1\\}^{n} exactly sampleable by 𝖭𝖢𝟢superscript𝖭𝖢0\\mathsf{NC^{0}} functions are the six distributions in 1.1. As a contrasting example to the limitation given by Theorem 1.2, consider the next simplest class of circuits commonly studied: 𝖠𝖢𝟢superscript𝖠𝖢0\\mathsf{AC^{0}}. Up to some exponentially small error, they are able to sample the uniform distribution over permutations of [n]delimited-[]𝑛[n] 9 1. Thus by sampling 1w​0n−wsuperscript1𝑤superscript0𝑛𝑤1^{w}0^{n-w} for the appropriate distribution over weights w𝑤w accepted (or rejected) by a symmetric function f𝑓f, one can apply a randomly sampled permutation to output the uniform distribution over f−1​(1)superscript𝑓11f^{-1}(1) (or f−1​(0)superscript𝑓10f^{-1}(0)) [38, Lemma 4.3]. We provide a proof overview of Theorem 1.2 in Section 2. Preliminary definitions and results are given in Section 3. The full proof of our main result is in Section 4, with some technical proofs deferred to the appendices.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: fan-in) elude a comprehensive understanding.
