      "content": "Paper Title: An Adaptive Federated Relevance Framework for Spatial Temporal Graph Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn recent years, spatial-temporal data has drawn increasing attention owing to its great potential in various fields and significant effects on daily activities such as traffic management , health monitoring , and action recognition [ref]3. The advancement of deep learning has shed light on processing by extracting valuable features from spatial-temporal data to facilitate downstream prediction/regression tasks. For instance, traditional deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs)  and recurrent neural networks (RNNs)   have been heavily investigated to uncover the hidden correlations and interdependencies in the spatial-temporal data sequence. Even though the existing models are able to capture and utilise the extracted correlation to some extent, many limitations start surfacing: CNN-based methods face challenges in discovering long-term temporal correlations, while RNN-based ones lack the capability to comprehend the global spatial structure. Additionally, one common issue is that both model types require grid-like data input, which is considered intractable when decoding the topological information from the spatial dimension. It is argued that the non-Euclidean graph data structure shows great potential in terms of representing inter-connectivity and dynamic trends in both spatial and temporal aspects . Recently, modelling the spatial-temporal data into graph representation has risen to the spotlight owing to the development of graph neural network (GNN), reporting some encouraging improvements on both classification and regression tasks compared with CNN and RNN based models [ref]7 [ref]8. It is also proven in prior work  that even for data in which explicit graph structure does not naturally exist, extracting and modelling the hidden graph structure from the original data could lead to a significant performance improvement. Following that, most existing methods [ref]7 [ref]8 0 1 first transform spatial-temporal data into static graphs by modelling both nodes and edges, and then use GNNs to learn the embedding representations from the generated static graphs. Taking the traffic flow graph as an example in which different districts are treated as nodes, the flow of traffic between nodes will experience the changes at different hours of the day . Ignoring dynamic correlations between nodes in the temporal dimension will undoubtedly lead to compromised and less desirable results. It is thus crucial to capture the inter-dependencies and dynamic temporal changes over time when turning the spatial-temporal data into the graph structure. Apart from the quest to utilise spatial-temporal data more effectively, another pressing problem regards the data scarcity issue in real-world applications. For all learning-based tasks, insufficient data essentially causes an over-fitting problem of the model and makes it hard to generalise when unseen data appears during inference time. One common way to solve this problem is to collect a colossal amount of training data from multiple parties and train the model in a centralised manner. However, it has drawn increasing concerns over data privacy and security in many data-sensitive institutions. For instance, hospitals and drug research institutions rarely publish patient and clinical data due to their sensitivity, and trainable models thus fail to infer results that are not present in the training set. To this end, federated learning (FL) 2 is introduced as a collaborative training scheme, which involves multiple parties without exposing local data to others. By integrating all participants’ model weights or gradients, the model trained by FL will thus have a higher generalisation ability. In the commonly used FL framework 3, all participants’ data is by default in the same distribution, while in real-world cases, the divergence of data distribution from different participants is nontrivial since it is determined by many uncontrollable factors like separate geographic locations. The most prevalent FL algorithm is called FedAvg 3, in which the local model weights are sent to the server and aggregated in an iterative manner. However, it ignores the non-IID data distribution fact and assumes equal contribution from all participants. It is thus both intuitive and critical to incorporate the difference in data distribution from participants and make it part of the FL process to facilitate the training process. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive federated relevance framework called FedRel for spatial-temporal graph learning. This framework is composed of three key modules, including a feature transformation net to extract the important spatial-temporal features from raw data, a dynamic inter-intra graph (DIIG) module to generate the spatial-temporal graphs while capturing inter-dependencies and dynamic temporal changes across these graphs, and a relevance-based federated learning module to expedite the collaborative graph learning. It is worth mentioning that the intra-graph concept in our work refers to the spatial node correlations inside one generated spatial graph at any timestamp, while inter-graphs indicate temporal node correlations across multiple spatial graphs. The main advantages of our proposed framework are two folds: 1) DIIG uncovers the hidden topological graph structures of the transformed spatial-temporal features, which effectively encodes both spatial and temporal information into the embedding space when updating the node embedding through the GNN model; 2) The DIIGs from different participants are an integral part of the federated relevance training process. Thus the models are trained collaboratively to enable a better generalisation capability. The contributions of this work are summarised as follows: We propose a novel adaptive federated relevance framework, namely FedRel, for spatial-temporal graph learning. The relevance of each participant is determined by adaptively attending the distance scores between local data distribution and the approximated global distributions, enabling the framework to put more attention on the participants with divergent data distributions and improve the model’s generalisation ability. We implement a feature transformation net using a variety of model structures with different design philosophies, aiming to find the most practical model that excels in processing spatial-temporal raw data and is capable of generating high-quality spatial-temporal features. We conceptualise the inter-intra graphs learning from spatial-temporal features. We also design and implement a dynamic inter-intra graph (DIIG) module to generate the spatial-temporal graphs so as to capture inter-dependencies and dynamic temporal changes across these graphs. We conducted a comprehensive experiment of our framework on real-world dataset ISRUC_S3 4 and SHL_Small 5, along with detailed ablation studies on each module for the interpretability purpose. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves promising results in task-specific classifications, model convergence performance, and scalability.\n\nReference markers found: [3]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]3: data has drawn increasing attention owing to its great potential in various fields and significant effects on daily activities such as traffic management , health monitoring , and action recognition [ref]3.
