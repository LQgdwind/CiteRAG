      "content": "Paper Title: 2D-AoI: Age-of-Information of Distributed Sensors for Spatio-Temporal Processes\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) aims to achieve seamless integration between the physical and digital worlds. Physical devices, equipped with sensors and network connectivity, exchange information that is collected and processed in cyberspace. This information is used to gather data about physical phenomena, make decisions, augment reality, or control devices in the physical world through actuators. Examples of such cyber-physical systems include environmental monitoring, intelligent transportation, augmented reality, robotics, and networked feedback control. Common to these is the need to maintain fresh information about a physical phenomenon. An accepted measure for quantifying information freshness is the Age-of-Information (AoI). The concept of AoI was initially defined in the field of vehicular communications  and motivated the investigation of AoI in queueing systems [ref]2. Today, the AoI is known for a variety of system models, see the recent surveys  [ref]4, including wireless channels  , wireless networks , random access channels   0, queueing systems 1 2, and queueing networks 3. While the focus has been on mean AoI and mean peak AoI, there are a number of papers that derive the CCDF 2 4 5 or tail bounds of the AoI 6 7. The classic configuration studied in AoI involves a single sensor that observes a physical phenomenon and transmits sensor samples over a network to a monitor. The system is shown in Fig. 1(a) as a special case for S=1S=1 sensor. The sensor takes samples indexed i≥1i\\geq 1 at times AiA_{i} and sends the samples as packets over the network. The network can cause delays or packet loss and packets depart from the network to the monitor at times Di≥AiD_{i}\\geq A_{i}, or Di=∞D_{i}=\\infty if a packet cannot be recovered. In many instances of practical significance, however, there are multiple sensors, S>1S>1, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). Sensors can be spatially distributed, redundant, or of different types, and can be connected in a variety of ways, including independent network paths or a shared wireless channel. Environmental monitoring involves many spatially distributed sensors that generate correlated information and can be connected via LoRaWAN or 5G mMTC, for example. Modern vehicles are equipped with automotive Ethernet and an array of sensors, including cameras, lidar, radar, and ultrasound, that observe the environment and create overlapping or correlated views. Vehicles share sensor information over Wifi to create a collective perception, to name a few examples. Despite this, the effects of the AoI when multiple statistically correlated sensors are available have only recently begun to be explored 8 9   , and so far there is no mathematical derivation that incorporates spatial correlation into the AoI. In this study, we examine physical phenomena represented as correlated spatio-temporal processes sampled by a number of distributed sensors SS. The spatial dimension can be Euclidean space, although this is not a necessary condition. The same methodology can be applied to include sensors that observe different but correlated physical phenomena. To illustrate, the spatial dimension could include road traffic volume and travel time or even air quality. In general, the spatial and temporal sampling densities are constrained by the limited capacity of the network. This raises the question of which sensor should be sampled and when. A related question is whether it is preferable to use outdated information obtained at a specific location or to utilize the most recent data from a different location. Fig. 1(b) illustrates the example. To make progress on these issues, it is necessary to formalize the trade-off between AoI and the spatial distance of sensors. To account for both temporal and spatial dimensions, this paper presents a two-dimensional (2D) model of AoI that uses an age-equivalent representation of spatial distance. The distance measure can be directly incorporated into the AoI, providing a strong link to the existing AoI literature and a foundation for further investigation. In particular, our work achieves a mapping of the AoI of spatio-temporal sampling to a suitably adapted model of AoI in parallel systems. The spatio-temporal process model we start from is generic and can be defined in different ways depending on the specific analysis being performed. In the course of this paper we use Gaussian processes, with distinct correlation kernels, but other models are also possible. In the basic case of exponential product kernels, the spatial distance between the sensors leads to an additive shift of the AoI, that is independent of time. In contrast, in the case of squared exponential and rational quadratic kernels, the impact of spatial distance on the AoI is observed to diminish over time. By employing our model of 2D-AoI, we demonstrate the potential benefits and limitations of distributed sensors. In our analysis, we consider different network models, including both lossy ALOHA multi-access links and lossless M∣\\midM∣\\mid1 queues. We evaluate the impact of spatial topology and sensor density on the AoI performance. We believe that our methodology also lends itself to the study of a range of other relevant systems, an example is included in the appendix. The remainder of this work is structured as follows. We start with a discussion of related works in Sec. II. In Sec. III we define the notion of 2D-AoI. We show how the 2D-AoI can be evaluated for a network model with independent channels in Sec. IV. In Sec. V we use Gaussian processes to characterize spatio-temporal physical phenomena and use these to instantiate the 2D-AoI model. Sec. VI considers relevant covariance kernels and their impact on the AoI. In Sec. VII we show evaluation results for the density of a sensor network served by lossless, lossy, independent, or non-independent channels. Brief conclusions are provided in Sec. VIII. A background to Gaussian process regression, an example of a non-Gaussian model of 2D-AoI, as well as some further results are given in the appendix.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: information freshness is the Age-of-Information (AoI).
