      "content": "Paper Title: FedTracker: Furnishing Ownership Verification and Traceability for Federated Learning Model\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFederated Learning (FL)  has turned into one of the most popular frameworks for distributedly training deep learning models without sharing private messages. FL is nowadays widely applied in various privacy-sensitive domains, such as object detection  , medical image analysis   , recommendation systems   and so on. FL meets the privacy needs of the data owners while producing high-quality models for the community. However, collaborative training in FL makes the model publicly available to multiple participants, which may lead to the model leakage issue in FL. Model leakage in FL refers to the malicious distribution or sale of FL models by clients for personal gain. This behavior infringes the legitimate copyright of the FL group. Detecting copyright infringement and protecting intellectual property rights has become a critical issue in FL. There are two major concerns in FL copyright protection, ownership verification and traceability. Ownership verification involves verifying the ownership of the FL model when it is illegally distributed and charging the unauthorized user outside the FL group with tort. The FL model should be considered as the intellectual property of the FL group instead of any individual. Any legal use of the FL model should be made with the consent of the FL group. Traceability refers to disclose the identity of the culprit among the FL participants who illegally distribute the model to third-parties outside the FL group. It is a new requirement for protecting the copyright of the FL model, which to our best knowledge has not been addressed before. To protect the copyright of Deep Neural Networks (DNN), DNN watermarks [ref]9 0 1 2 3 4, including parameter-based watermark and backdoor-based watermark, are proposed. Parameter-based watermark methods embed personal watermarks into the parameters or the distribution of the parameters of the DNN models [ref]9 5 1 6. It can provide multi-bit information, but the extraction of watermarks needs white-box access to the suspicious model, which limits the application. On the contrary, backdoor-based watermark methods 0 3 7 8 take advantage of backdoor attack 9 to insert specific triggers to identify the ownership of the model. Although backdoor-based watermark can be verified through black-box access, it is usually zero-bit. This means the watermark can only demonstrate the presence or absence of the watermark instead of a bit string representing identity. Some recent works also explores applying DNN watermarks to FL copyright protection. WAFFLE 0 is the first watermarking scheme designed for FL, in which the Server is responsible for embedding the backdoor-based watermarks into the FL model. WAFFLE propose to conduct a retraining step after federated aggregation to embed the watermark. Liu et al. 1 2 and Li et al. 3 propose to entitle the Clients to embed both parameter-based and backdoor-based watermarks into the global model. However, existing works only focus on ownership verification. None of them can provide traceability of the model leakers for FL models. Even if the FL group can prove the ownership of the FL model in the event of the infringement, they are not capable of detecting the model leakers hidden among them. We aim to design a complete FL copyright protection framework that can furnish both ownership verification and traceability for the FL model. In this paper, we present FedTracker, the first FL model protection framework that offers both. The illustration of the problem and our framework is shown in Figure 1. Specifically, we design a bi-level protection scheme that enables ownership verification and traceability respectively. On one level, FedTracker embeds a global watermark into the aggregated global model in each iteration. While the copyright infringement occurs, the FL group can extract the watermark and verify the ownership. On the other level, before distributing the model in each iteration, the server insert a unique local fingerprint for each client to identify each model. The model leaker can be traced by disclose the identification inside the model. However, the challenges of applying such framework are two-fold: It is challenging to preserve the utility of the model in condition of a lack of natural data. Since the server is assumed to have no access to the training data, the server should embed the watermark which is out of distribution of natural data. This can compromise the model’s utility. It is challenging to guarantee the discrimination of different models. Since we need to embed and compare multiple different fingerprints, it puts a higher requirement on the identifiability and robustness of fingerprints and the model leaker.\n To tackle the challenges mentioned above, first we propose a watermark embedding algorithm based on Continual Learning (CL) 4 to improve the utility of the watermarked model. We regard the primitive task of FL and the watermark embedding task as learning data from different domains and the utility drop is attributed to the catastrophic forgetting while learning a different task. We get the inspiration from the Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM) 5 and design a CL-based embedding algorithm for the FL scenario. We introduce our CL-based watermark embedding algorithm in Section 4.2. Second, to enhance the differentiation between different models of different Clients, we conduct the fingerprint generation by minimizing the maximal distance between fingerprints. We also propose a Fingerprint Similarity Score (FSS) to measure the similarity of the extracted fingerprint and clients’ fingerprints. Compared with traditional hamming distance whose output is discrete, FSS can provide more fine-grained measurement because the output of FSS is continuous. And thus, using FSS can better discriminate different fingerprints. Moreover, we embed the watermark and fingerprints respectively into different parts of the model to lower the mutual impact and improve the effectiveness of both mechanisms. The details are present in Section 4.3.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: is a new requirement for protecting the copyright of the FL model, which to our best knowledge has not been addressed before.
