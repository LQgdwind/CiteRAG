      "content": "Paper Title: Semantic Information Recovery in Wireless Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIt should be stressed that we have not set any constraints on the variables in the Infomax problem so far. However, in many applications, compression is needed because of the limited information rate. Therefore, we can formulate an optimization problem where we like to maximize the relevant information I𝜽​(𝐳;𝐲)subscript𝐼𝜽𝐳𝐲I_{\\bm{\\theta}}\\left(\\mathbf{z};\\mathbf{y}\\right) subject to the constraint to limit the compression rate I𝜽​(𝐬;𝐲)subscript𝐼𝜽𝐬𝐲I_{\\bm{\\theta}}\\left(\\mathbf{s};\\mathbf{y}\\right) to a maximum information rate ICsubscript𝐼CI_{\\textrm{C}}: Problem (15) is called the Information Bottleneck (IB) problem [ref]8   . The IB method introduced by Tishby et al.  has been the subject of intensive research for years and has proven to be a suitable mathematical/information-theoretical framework for solving numerous problems - also in wireless communications    . Note that we aim for an encoder that compresses 𝐬𝐬\\mathbf{s} into a compact representation 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} for discrete RVs by clustering and for continuous RVs by dimensionality reduction. To solve the constrained optimization problem (15), we can use Lagrangian optimization and obtain with Lagrange multiplier β≥0𝛽0\\beta\\geq 0. The Lagrange multiplier β𝛽\\beta allows defining a trade-off between the relevant information I𝜽​(𝐳;𝐲)subscript𝐼𝜽𝐳𝐲I_{\\bm{\\theta}}\\left(\\mathbf{z};\\mathbf{y}\\right) and compression rate I𝜽​(𝐬;𝐲)subscript𝐼𝜽𝐬𝐲I_{\\bm{\\theta}}\\left(\\mathbf{s};\\mathbf{y}\\right), which indicates the relation to rate distortion theory . With β=0𝛽0\\beta=0, we have the InfoMax problem (1) whereas for β→∞→𝛽\\beta\\to\\infty we minimize compression rate. Calculation of the mutual information terms may be computationally intractable, as in the InfoMax problem (1). Approximation approaches can be found in  . Notable exceptions include if the RVs are all discrete or Gaussian distributed. We note that in [ref]8 [ref]21 the authors already introduced the IB problem to task-oriented communications. But [ref]8 [ref]21 do not address our viewpoint or classification: We compress and channel encode the messages/communications source 𝐬𝐬\\mathbf{s} for given entailment p​(𝐬|𝐳)𝑝conditional𝐬𝐳p(\\mathbf{s}|\\mathbf{z}), in the sense of a data-reduced and reliable communication of the semantic RV 𝐳𝐳\\mathbf{z}. Basically, we implement joint source-channel coding of 𝐬𝐬\\mathbf{s} s.t. preserving the semantic RV 𝐳𝐳\\mathbf{z}, and we do not differentiate between Levels A and B as indicated by Weaver’s notion outlined in Sec. I-A. Indeed, we draw a direct connection to IB compared to related semantic communication literature    that so far only included optimization with terms reminiscent of the IB problem. This article does not only distinct itself on a conceptual, but also on a technical level from [ref]21 : We follow a different strategy to solve (15). First, using the data processing inequality [ref]39, we see that the compression rate is upper bounded by the mutual information of the encoder I𝜽​(𝐬;𝐱)subscript𝐼𝜽𝐬𝐱I_{\\bm{\\theta}}\\left(\\mathbf{s};\\mathbf{x}\\right) and that of the channel I​(𝐱;𝐲)𝐼𝐱𝐲I\\left(\\mathbf{x};\\mathbf{y}\\right): In case of negligible encoder compression I𝜽​(𝐬;𝐱)>I​(𝐱;𝐲)subscript𝐼𝜽𝐬𝐱𝐼𝐱𝐲I_{\\bm{\\theta}}\\left(\\mathbf{s};\\mathbf{x}\\right)>I\\left(\\mathbf{x};\\mathbf{y}\\right), the channel becomes the limiting factor of information rate. For example, with a deterministic continuous mapping 𝐱=μ𝜽​(𝐬)𝐱subscript𝜇𝜽𝐬\\mathbf{x}=\\mu_{\\bm{\\theta}}(\\mathbf{s}), this is true since I𝜽​(𝐬;𝐱)→∞→subscript𝐼𝜽𝐬𝐱I_{\\bm{\\theta}}\\left(\\mathbf{s};\\mathbf{x}\\right)\\rightarrow\\infty. Using the chain rule of mutual information [ref]39, we see that this upper bound on compression rate grows with the dimension of 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x}, i.e., the number of channel uses NTxsubscript𝑁TxN_{\\textrm{Tx}}: Assuming 𝐲𝐲\\mathbf{y} to be conditional dependent on xnsubscript𝑥𝑛x_{n} given xn−1,…,x1subscript𝑥𝑛1…subscript𝑥1x_{n-1},\\dots,x_{1}, i.e., p​(𝐲|xn,…,x1)≠p​(𝐲|xn−1,…,x1)𝑝conditional𝐲subscript𝑥𝑛…subscript𝑥1𝑝conditional𝐲subscript𝑥𝑛1…subscript𝑥1p(\\mathbf{y}|x_{n},\\dots,x_{1})\\neq p(\\mathbf{y}|x_{n-1},\\dots,x_{1}) being, e.g., true for an AWGN channel, it is I​(xn;𝐲|xn−1,…,x1)>0𝐼subscript𝑥𝑛conditional𝐲subscript𝑥𝑛1…subscript𝑥10I\\left(x_{n};\\mathbf{y}|x_{n-1},\\dots,x_{1}\\right)>0 [ref]39 and the sum in (18) indeed strictly increases. Replacing 𝐲𝐲\\mathbf{y} in I​(𝐱;𝐲)𝐼𝐱𝐲I\\left(\\mathbf{x};\\mathbf{y}\\right) of (18) by 𝐬𝐬\\mathbf{s}, the result also holds for encoder compression I𝜽​(𝐬;𝐱)subscript𝐼𝜽𝐬𝐱I_{\\bm{\\theta}}\\left(\\mathbf{s};\\mathbf{x}\\right), respectively. Hence, increasing the encoder output dimension NTxsubscript𝑁TxN_{\\textrm{Tx}}, we can increase the possible compression rate I𝜽​(𝐬;𝐲)subscript𝐼𝜽𝐬𝐲I_{\\bm{\\theta}}\\left(\\mathbf{s};\\mathbf{y}\\right). Interchanging 𝐱𝐱\\mathbf{x} and 𝐲𝐲\\mathbf{y} in (18), we see that the same holds for the receiver input dimension NRxsubscript𝑁RxN_{\\textrm{Rx}}. Further, the mutual information of the channel and thus the compression rate are upper bounded by channel capacity: For example, with an AWGN channel, we have C=NTx/2⋅ln⁡(1+1/σn2)𝐶⋅subscript𝑁Tx211superscriptsubscript𝜎n2C=N_{\\textrm{Tx}}/2\\cdot\\ln\\left(1+1/\\sigma_{\\textrm{n}}^{2}\\right) again increasing with NTxsubscript𝑁TxN_{\\textrm{Tx}}. Now, let us assume the RVs to be discrete so that ℋ​(𝐱|𝐬)≥0ℋconditional𝐱𝐬0\\mathcal{H}\\left(\\mathbf{x}|\\mathbf{s}\\right)\\geq 0. Indeed, this is true if the RVs are processed discretely with finite resolution on digital signal processors, as in the numerical example of Sec. III. As long as I𝜽​(𝐬;𝐱)<Csubscript𝐼𝜽𝐬𝐱𝐶I_{\\bm{\\theta}}\\left(\\mathbf{s};\\mathbf{x}\\right)<C, all information of the discrete RVs can be transmitted through the channel with arbitrary low error probability according to Shannon’s channel coding theorem . Then, we can upper bound encoder compression I𝜽​(𝐬;𝐱)subscript𝐼𝜽𝐬𝐱I_{\\bm{\\theta}}\\left(\\mathbf{s};\\mathbf{x}\\right) and thus compression rate I𝜽​(𝐬;𝐲)subscript𝐼𝜽𝐬𝐲I_{\\bm{\\theta}}\\left(\\mathbf{s};\\mathbf{y}\\right) by the sum of entropies of any output xnsubscript𝑥𝑛x_{n} [ref]39 of the encoder p𝜽​(𝐱|𝐬)subscript𝑝𝜽conditional𝐱𝐬p_{\\bm{\\theta}}(\\mathbf{x}|\\mathbf{s}) - each with cardinality |ℳx|subscriptℳ𝑥\\left|\\mathcal{M}_{x}\\right|: Note that the entropy sum in (21) grows again with NTxsubscript𝑁TxN_{\\textrm{Tx}} for discrete RVs since 0≤ℋ​(xn)≤log2⁡(|ℳx|)0ℋsubscript𝑥𝑛subscript2subscriptℳ𝑥0\\leq\\mathcal{H}\\left(x_{n}\\right)\\leq\\log_{2}(\\left|\\mathcal{M}_{x}\\right|). Moreover, we can define an encoder capacity C𝜽subscript𝐶𝜽C_{\\bm{\\theta}} analogous to channel capacity C𝐶C in (19) upper bounding encoder compression I𝜽​(𝐬;𝐱)subscript𝐼𝜽𝐬𝐱I_{\\bm{\\theta}}\\left(\\mathbf{s};\\mathbf{x}\\right). It may be restricted by the chosen (DNN) model p𝜽​(𝐱|𝐬)subscript𝑝𝜽conditional𝐱𝐬p_{\\bm{\\theta}}(\\mathbf{x}|\\mathbf{s}) and optimization procedure w.r.t. 𝜽𝜽\\bm{\\theta}, i.e., the hypothesis class . In summary, we have proven by (19) and (21) that there is an information bottleneck when maximizing the relevant information I𝜽​(𝐳;𝐲)subscript𝐼𝜽𝐳𝐲I_{\\bm{\\theta}}\\left(\\mathbf{z};\\mathbf{y}\\right) either due to the channel distortion I​(𝐱;𝐲)𝐼𝐱𝐲I\\left(\\mathbf{x};\\mathbf{y}\\right) or encoder compression I𝜽​(𝐬;𝐲)subscript𝐼𝜽𝐬𝐲I_{\\bm{\\theta}}\\left(\\mathbf{s};\\mathbf{y}\\right). To fully exploit the available resources, we set constraint ICsubscript𝐼CI_{\\textrm{C}} to be equal to the upper bound, i.e., channel capacity C𝐶C or the upper bound on encoder compression rate NTx⋅log2⁡(|ℳx|)⋅subscript𝑁Txsubscript2subscriptℳ𝑥N_{\\textrm{Tx}}\\cdot\\log_{2}(\\left|\\mathcal{M}_{x}\\right|). In both cases, the upper bound grows (linearly) with the encoder output dimension NTxsubscript𝑁TxN_{\\textrm{Tx}}, and thus we can set the constraint ICsubscript𝐼CI_{\\textrm{C}} higher or lower by choosing NTxsubscript𝑁TxN_{\\textrm{Tx}}. With fixed constraint ICsubscript𝐼CI_{\\textrm{C}}, we maximize the relevant information I𝜽​(𝐳;𝐲)subscript𝐼𝜽𝐳𝐲I_{\\bm{\\theta}}\\left(\\mathbf{z};\\mathbf{y}\\right). By doing so, we derive an exact solution to (15) that maximizes I𝜽​(𝐳;𝐲)subscript𝐼𝜽𝐳𝐲I_{\\bm{\\theta}}\\left(\\mathbf{z};\\mathbf{y}\\right) for a fixed encoder output dimension that bounds the compression rate. As in the InfoMax problem, we can exploit the MILBO to use the amortized cross entropy ℒ𝜽,𝝋CEsuperscriptsubscriptℒ𝜽𝝋CE\\mathcal{L}_{\\bm{\\theta},\\bm{\\varphi}}^{\\textrm{CE}} in (9) as the optimization criterion. In [ref]21, however, the authors solve the variational IB problem of (16) and require tuning of β𝛽\\beta. Albeit also using the MILBO as a variational approximation to the first term in (16), they introduce a KL divergence term as an upper bound to compression rate I𝜽​(𝐬;𝐲)subscript𝐼𝜽𝐬𝐲I_{\\bm{\\theta}}\\left(\\mathbf{s};\\mathbf{y}\\right) derived by DKL​(p𝜽​(𝐲)∥qϑ​(𝐲))≥0subscript𝐷KLconditionalsubscript𝑝𝜽𝐲subscript𝑞bold-italic-ϑ𝐲0D_{\\text{KL}}\\left(p_{\\bm{\\theta}}(\\mathbf{y})\\parallel q_{\\bm{\\vartheta}}(\\mathbf{y})\\right)\\geq 0 with some variational distribution qϑ​(𝐲)subscript𝑞bold-italic-ϑ𝐲q_{\\bm{\\vartheta}}(\\mathbf{y}) with parameters ϑbold-italic-ϑ\\bm{\\vartheta} .\nThen, the variational IB objective function reads : Moreover, the authors use a log-uniform distribution as the variational prior qϑ​(𝐲)subscript𝑞bold-italic-ϑ𝐲q_{\\bm{\\vartheta}}(\\mathbf{y}) in [ref]21 to induce sparsity on 𝐲𝐲\\mathbf{y} so that the number of outputs is dynamically determined based on the channel condition or SNR, i.e., p𝜽​(𝐲|𝐬,σn2)subscript𝑝𝜽conditional𝐲𝐬superscriptsubscript𝜎n2p_{\\bm{\\theta}}(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{s},\\sigma_{\\textrm{n}}^{2}). The approach additionally necessitates approximation of the KL divergence term in (22) and estimation of the noise variance σn2superscriptsubscript𝜎n2\\sigma_{\\textrm{n}}^{2}. With our approach we avoid the additional approximations and tuning of the hyperparameter β𝛽\\beta in (22) possibly enabling better semantic performance as well as reduced inference and training complexity at the cost of full usage of NTxsubscript𝑁TxN_{\\textrm{Tx}} channels even when the channel capacity C𝐶C allows for its reduction. We leave a numerical comparison to [ref]21 for future research as this is out of the scope of this paper.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: rate I𝜽​(𝐬;𝐲)subscript𝐼𝜽𝐬𝐲I_{\\bm{\\theta}}\\left(\\mathbf{s};\\mathbf{y}\\right) to a maximum information rate ICsubscript𝐼CI_{\\textrm{C}}: Problem (15) is called the Information Bottleneck (IB) problem [ref]8   .
