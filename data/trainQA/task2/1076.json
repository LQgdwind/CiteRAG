      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Black-Box Attackers with Transferable Priors and Query Feedback\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nQuery-based black-box attacks could be divided into score-accessible and decision-accessible settings. We focus on the score-accessible black-box setting, where the classification score of the victim model is available. The decision-accessible setting   is beyond the scope of this study, where only discrete classification decision is available. Given a natural sample XùëãX, the goal of query-based black-box adversarial attack is to generate an adversarial example Xa‚Äãd‚Äãvsubscriptùëãùëéùëëùë£X_{adv} to fool a victim model ùí±ùí±\\mathcal{V}, with as fewer queries as possible, under ‚ÄñXa‚Äãd‚Äãv‚àíX‚Äñ2‚â§Œ∂subscriptnormsubscriptùëãùëéùëëùë£ùëã2ùúÅ\\left\\|X_{adv}-X\\right\\|_{2}\\leq\\zeta.\nAs the gradient of victim models is inaccessible, we argue that there are three key issues for the design of query-based black-box attack, i.e., 1) how to generate a query perturbation in high-dimension space, 2) how to estimate the gradient with less bias and variance, and 3) how to update the query sample with the estimated gradients. ZOO  proposes to use symmetric difference to estimate gradient for every pixel. NES  utilizes natural evolution strategy to estimate gradients. Following NES, Bandits attack [ref]24 introduces data-dependent prior and time-dependent prior to improve query efficiency. Instead of the coordinate-wise gradient estimation in ZOO, Bandits attack introduces spherical gradient estimation  to integrate the ‚Äúpriors‚Äù in the Bandits framework. NATTACK  also introduces a gradient estimation framework to improve the attack success over defensive models. RGF  follows the same gradient estimation framework. Different from the previous approaches, SimBA [ref]19 does not estimate gradient explicitly, but adapt a greedy strategy to update the query samples, i.e., randomly samples a query perturbation from a predefined orthonormal basis, either add or subtract it to the target image, and update if the query perturbation decrease / increase the attack loss JùêΩJ (C&W  in our study). This simple algorithm surprisingly outperforms several more complex query-based attack, e.g., Bandits [ref]24. In this study, we use an improved SimBA as a key component in our algorithm. A recent study Square Attack¬†[ref]2 introduces highly-efficient greedy random search for black-box adversarial attack, which could be regarded as an improved query-based attack over SimBA¬†[ref]19. Please note that the contributions of Square Attack¬†[ref]2 and our study are orthogonal; They may be integrated together in future studies. Furthermore, there are also studies exploring to improve query-based attacks with transferability. P-RGF  improves query efficiency of RGF with a transfer-based prior. Subspace attack  propose to reduce search space of random vectors with gradients from a set of reference models. However, these methods do not explicitly integrate the advances in transferability-based black-box attack (e.g., TIMI); besides, the surrogate model is not updated using the query feedback. Both techniques are proven remarkably effective in our experiments.\n\nReference markers found: [24]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]24: the estimated gradients.
