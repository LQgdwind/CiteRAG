      "content": "Paper Title: Invertible Manifold Learning for Dimension Reduction\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTo verify the invertible NLDR ability of i-ML-Enc and analyze different cases of NLDR, we compare it with eight typical methods in NLDR and inverse scenarios on both synthetic (Swiss roll, Spheres and Half Spheres) and real-world datasets (USPS, MNIST, FMNIST and COIL-20). Eight methods for manifold learning: Isomap [ref]28, MLLE , t-SNE  and ML-Enc [ref]16 are compared for NLDR; four AE-based methods VAE , GRAE , TopoAE  and ML-AE [ref]16 are compared for reconstructible manifold learning. Three methods for inverse models: INN , i-RevNet , and i-ResNet [ref]1 are compared for bijective inverse property. Among them, i-RevNet and i-ResNet are supervised algorithms while the rest are unsupervised. For a fair comparison in this experiment, we adopt 888 layers neural network for all the network-based methods except i-RevNet and i-ResNet. Hyperparameter values of i-ML-Enc and configurations of datasets are provided in Appendix 0.A.2. We evaluate an invertible NLDR algorithm from three aspects: (i) Invertible property. Reconstruction MSE (RMSE) and maximum norm error (MNE) measure the difference between the input data and reconstruction results by norm-based errors. (ii) NLDR quality. Trustworthiness (Trust), Continuity (Cont) , and latent MSE (l-MSE) [ref]16 are used to evaluate the quality of the low-dimensional representation. (iii) Generalization ability. Mean accuracy (Acc) of linear classification on the learned representation measures models‚Äô generalization ability to downstream tasks. Their exact definitions and purpose are given in Appendix 0.A.1. Tab. 1 compares the i-ML-Enc with the relevant methods on MNIST and FMNIST datasets, more results and detailed analysis on other datasets are given in Appendix 0.A.2.\nThe process of invertible NLDR of i-ML-Enc and comparing results of typical methods are visualized in Fig. 4. We can conclude:\n(i) i-ML-Enc achieves invertible NLDR in the first stage with great NLDR and generalization qualities. The representation in the L‚àí1ùêø1L-1-th layer of i-ML-Enc mostly outperforms all comparing methods for both invertible and NLDR metrics without losing information of the data, while other methods drop geometric and topological information to some extent. (ii) i-ML-Enc tries to keep more geometric and topological structure in the second stage in the case of s‚Ä≤<d‚â§ssuperscriptùë†‚Ä≤ùëëùë†s^{{}^{\\prime}}<d\\leq s. The LùêøL-th layer of i-ML-Enc shows high consistency with its L‚àí1ùêø1L-1-th layer and comparable NLDR performance in visualization results. (iii) i-ML-Enc provides more reliable and explainable representations of the data manifold because of its good mathematic properties.\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: methods in NLDR and inverse scenarios on both synthetic (Swiss roll, Spheres and Half Spheres) and real-world datasets (USPS, MNIST, FMNIST and COIL-20).
