This work was supported by the Spanish MINECO under contract TEC2017-90034-C2-1-R (ALLIANCE), the Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA) and the Secretariat for Universities and Research of the Ministry of Business and Knowledge of the Government of Catalonia as well as the European Social Fund.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIn this section, we describe the network scenario considered in this paper. Particularly, we address the intradomain TE problem, where network traffic is measured and routed to optimize the network resources. Typically, IP networks run link-state Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP), such as Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) , that choose paths using the Dijkstra’s algorithm over some pre-defined link weights. TE can be achieved through different approaches. Network operators use commercial tools   to fine-tune link weights. Other mechanisms propose to add extra routing entries  or end-to-end tunnels (e.g., RSVP-TE ) to perform source-destination routing, expanding the solution space. In the literature, we can find a wide range of proposed architectures and algorithms for TE . Our proposed ML solution is a fully distributed architecture that optimizes link weights (similar to existing commercial solutions  ) and interfaces with standard OSPF. It does not require any changes to OSPF, while it can be implemented with a software update on the routers where it is deployed. Relying on well-known link-state routing protocols, such as OSPF, also offers the advantage that the network is easier to manage compared to finer-grained alternatives, such as flow-based routing . In what follows, we describe the three operational steps of our solution (see Fig. 1): 1) Traffic Measurement: In step  1\n, a traffic measurement platform deployed over the network identifies a new Traffic Matrix (TM). This new TM needs to be communicated to all participating routers, which upon reception will start the next step and optimize the routing for this TM. We leave out of the scope of this paper the details of this process, as TM estimation is an extensive research field with many established proposals. For instance, this process can be done periodically (e.g, each 5-10 minutes as in ), where the TM is first estimated and then optimized. Some proposals trigger the optimization process when a relevant change is detected in the TM , while others use prediction techniques to optimize it in advance . Finally, some real-world operators make estimates considering their customers’ subscriptions and operate based on a static TM. Our proposal is flexible and can operate with any of these approaches. 2) Proposed MARL+GNN TE optimization system: Upon reception of the TM, routers run the MARL+GNN optimization process (step  2\n), which eventually computes the per-link weights that optimize OSPF routing in the subsequent step. Particularly, we set the goal to minimize the maximum link load (MinMaxLoad), which is a classic TE goal in carrier-grade networks   . This problem is known to be NP-hard, and even good settings of the weights can deviate significantly from the optimal configuration  . Our MARL optimization system is built using a distributed Graph Neural Network (GNN) that exchanges messages over the physical network topology. Messages are sent between routers and their directly attached neighbors. The content of such messages are hidden states that are produced and consumed by artificial neural networks and do not have a human-understandable meaning. The GNN makes several message iterations and, during this phase, local configuration of the router remains unchanged, thus having no impact on the current traffic. More details about the inner workings, performance, communication overhead, and computational cost can be found in Sections IV and V. 3) OSPF convergence: Finally, step  3\n is the standard OSPF convergence process based on the new per-link weights computed by the MARL+GNN system. Specifically, each agent has computed the optimal weigths for its locally attached links. For OSPF to recompute the new forwarding tables, it needs to broadcast the new link weights; this is done using the standard OSPF Link-State Advertisements (LSAs) . Once the routers have an identical view of the network, they compute locally their new forwarding tables, and traffic is routed following the optimization goal. Convergence time of OSPF is a well-studied subject. For instance, routing tables can converge in the order of a few seconds in networks with thousands of links [ref]35.\n\nReference markers found: [35]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]35: following the optimization goal.
