Your task is to predict the most likely citations for [ref] markers in academic paper sections based on the paper content and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract + section text with [ref] markers\n- Output: top {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or other content outside the JSON structure.\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION:\n- Input: Paper section text with [ref] markers + retrieved relevant papers\n- Output: top 40 predicted reference titles for each [ref] marker with reasoning\n- Format: JSON object with \"citations\" array containing objects with \"ref_index\", \"titles\", and \"reasoning\" fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the context around each [ref] marker to understand what reference is needed\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Consider the surrounding text, research area, and topic\n4. Generate realistic and relevant reference titles that would fit the context\n5. Provide detailed reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n6. Output format: JSON object with \"citations\" array\n7. Generate exactly 40 most relevant reference titles for each [ref]\n8. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n9.

Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\n\"Federated Learning aims to train models in massively distributed networks [ref]38 at a large scale [ref]5, over multiple sources of heterogeneous data [ref]30.\"\n\nRetrieved papers (top {top_r}):\n1. Title: Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with federated learning systems for decentralized data training.\n\n2.

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not use markdown formatting. Ensure all quotes and special characters are properly escaped.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES ON REASONING:\n- The reasoning field is crucial for preventing hallucination\n- Each reasoning should be specific to the context around the [ref] marker\n- Explain the connection between the predicted titles and the research topic\n- This helps validate that predictions are grounded in the actual content\n- Reasoning should be concise but informative (2-3 sentences)\n- Consider retrieved papers when available to improve prediction accuracy"

      "content": "Paper Title: RepoFusion: Training Code Models to Understand Your Repository\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nInformation from Outside the Current File: In the context of source code, harnessing information beyond the current file has been found to be useful. Hellendoorn and Devanbu [ref]12 utilizes a nested n-gram model with a locality-based cache encompassing all directories in the repository. To capture the structure of the repository, Pashakhanloo et al.   convert it into a relational database and propose a graph-walk mechanism whereas, Lyu et al. [ref]22 incorporates the API-dependency graph in its LSTM-based code model. While training the kNN-LM , Xu et al.  incorporates three types of binary variables corresponding to the presence or absence of similar local and global hierarchy. Zhang et al.  leverages the parent class to generate comments for the child class. Repository-level Context for Inference in LLMs:\nShrivastava et al. [ref]31 proposes RLPG, a classifier that selects a prompt proposal based on the target hole and utilizes the context from the chosen prompt proposal and prior context to prompt Codex . Similarly, RepoCoder  iteratively refines the prediction of the target hole by injecting the previous predictions from the LLM in addition to the retrieved context and prior context in the input prompt. In this work, we build upon the insights gained by Shrivastava et al. [ref]31 regarding the utilization of repository-level information during inference. We extend their findings to various configurations involving different code language models (LLMs), considering a range of context lengths and sizes. Additionally, our framework is trained with context from the repository and learns to effectively leverage multiple relevant contexts sourced from the repository. Retrieval-augmented Code Models: In recent studies      , attempts have been made to enhance code LLMs by augmenting them with a sparse or dense retrieval mechanism that returns API documentation or relevant code snippets from the repository. The prompt proposals [ref]31 used in our work along with BM25 and Random-NN share similarities with these retrieval mechanisms. Note that RepoFusion is independent from the specific retrieval mechanisms employed and thus can seamlessly learn to integrate multiple retrieved contexts, even from different retrieval mechanisms.\n\nReference markers found: [12]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]12: Information from Outside the Current File: In the context of source code, harnessing information beyond the current file has been found to be useful.
