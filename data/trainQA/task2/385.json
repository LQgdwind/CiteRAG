      "content": "Paper Title: Comparison and Benchmarking of AI Models and Frameworks on Mobile Devices\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDue to increasing amounts of data and compute resources, deep learning achieves many successes in various domains. To prove the validity of the AI, researchers take more attention to train more accurate models in the early days. Since many models have achieved pretty performance in various domains, the applications of the AI models to the end-users are put on the agenda.\nAfter entering the application period, the inference becomes more and more important. According to a IDC report , the demand for AI inference will far exceed the demand for training in the future. With the popularity of smart phones and internet of things, researchers and engineers have made effort to apply the AI inference on the mobile and embedded devices.\nRunning the inference on the edge devices can 1) reduce the latency, 2) protect the privacy, 3) consume the power . To make the inference on the edge devices more efficient, the neural networks are designed more light-weight by using simpler architecture, or by quantizing, pruning and compressing the networks. Different networks present different trade-offs between accuracy and computational complexity. These networks are designed with very different philosophies and have very different architectures. There is no single network architecture that unifies the network design and application. Beside of the diversity of models, the AI frameworks on mobile and embedded devices are also diverse, e.g. Tensorflow Lite , Caffe2 , Pytorch Mobile [ref]4.\nOn the other hand, the mobile and embedded devices provide additional hardware acceleration using GPUs or NPUs to support the AI applications.\nSince AI applications on mobile and embedded devices get more and more attentions, benchmarking and ranking the AI abilities of those devices becomes an urgent problem to be solved. MLPerf Inference [ref]5 proposes a set of rules and practices to ensure comparability across systems with wildly differing architectures. It defines several high-level abstractions of AI problems, and specifies the task to be accomplished and the general rules of the road, but leaves implementation details to the submitters.\nMLPerf Inference aims to more general and flexible benchmarking. However, this flexibility brings unfeasibility and unaffordable for a specific domain. The users of the benchmark need make their efforts to optimize the whole stack of the AI solutions, from the languages, libraries, frameworks, to hardwares. Moreover, the excessive optimization of a particular solution may affect the generality of the AI system.\nETH Zurich AI Benchmark [ref]6  aims to evaluate the AI ability of Android smartphones. Although AI Benchmark covers diverse tasks, we believe that the model diversity should be taken more attentions, since the models are often shared between different tasks by transfer learning. For example, the pre-trained networks for image recognition are often used as the backbone to extract the feature maps for other vision tasks, e.g. the object detection and segmentation. Moreover, AI Benchmark is implemented only using TensorFlow Lite. In this paper, we propose a benchmark suite, AIoTBench, which focuses on the evaluation of the inference ability of mobile and embedded devices. The workloads in our benchmark cover more model architectures and more frameworks.\nSpecifically, AIoTBench covers three typical heavy-weight networks: ResNet50 , InceptionV3 , DenseNet121 0, as well as three light-weight networks: SqueezeNet 1, MobileNetV2 2, MnasNet 3. Each model is implemented by three frameworks: Tensorflow Lite, Caffe2, Pytorch Mobile.\nComparing to MLPerf Inference, our benchmark is more available and affordable for the users, since it is off the shelf and needs no re-implementation. Our benchmark can be used for: Comparison of different AI models. Users can make a tradeoff between the accuracy, model complexity, model size and speed depending on the application requirement. Comparison of different AI frameworks on mobile environment. Depending on the selected model, users can make comparisons between the AI frameworks on mobile devices. Benchmarking and ranking the AI abilities of different mobile devices. With diverse and representative models and frameworks, the mobile devices can get a comprehensive benchmarking and evaluation. To compare and rank the AI capabilities of the devices, we propose two unified metrics as the AI scores: Valid Images Per Second (VIPS) and Valid FLOPs Per Second (VOPS). They reflect the trade-off between quality and performance of the AI system.\nCurrently, we have compared and ranked 5 mobile devices using our benchmark: Galaxy s10e, Honor v20, Vivo x27, Vivo nex,and Oppo R17. This list will be extended and updated soon after.\n\nReference markers found: [4]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]4: that unifies the network design and application. Beside of the diversity of models, the AI frameworks on mobile and embedded devices are also diverse, e.g. Tensorflow Lite , Caffe2 , Pytorch Mobile [ref]4.\nOn the other hand, the mobile and embedded devices provide additional hardware acceleration using GPUs or NPUs to support the AI applications.\nSince AI applications on mobile and embedded\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.

For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
