      "content": "Paper Title: The Impact of Distance on Performance and Scalability of Distributed Database Systems in Hybrid Clouds\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nFor about half century, relational databases have been dominated solutions for storing, retrieving, and managing data . However, due to essential requirements for high performance111In this paper, performance and throughput are used exchangeable; otherwise mentioned. and scalability, NoSQL databases have emerged . The explosive growth in the usage of NoSQL databases has led to several efforts aimed at evaluating their performance and scalability. The performance of these databases depends on their features (data model, data replication strategy, consistency mechanism) as well as the hardware underpinning the computing and storage infrastructures utilized [ref]8. Most of the industrial organizations deploy and operate ”big data storage solutions” using cloud computing infrastructure since the emergence of the cloud computing paradigm. Cloud computing comes traditionally in three models 0: public, private and hybrid. A public cloud provides computing, storage and networking resources to the general public over Internet, while a private cloud provisions computing and storage resources from an organization”s own cloud infrastructure. A hybrid cloud is a seamless integration of public and private clouds to benefit from the best of both worlds 1. It enables cloud bursting in which applications initially leverage private cloud and then can burst into a public cloud when private cloud’s resources are not enough under spikes or increased workloads. A hybrid cloud offers its owner business opportunities in terms of security in compliance with the location of sensitive data, availability, reliability and monetary cost. The performance of NoSQL and Relational databases deployed on public or private cloud datacenters varies as the hardware infrastructure resources and database configuration parameters may change. As indicated in the literature 234, the more powerful resources, the higher throughput and less read and write latency are offered by using these databases. The value of these performance parameters is directly proportional to the power of hardware resources. There is a significant amount literature on the evaluation of NoSQL databases deployed on either public or private cloud datacenters. More specifically, Rabl et al. 4 evaluated the performance and sclability of four NoSQL databases (Voldermort222Voldermort: https://www.project-voldemort.com/voldemort/,\nHBase 333HBase:https://hbase.apache.org/, Cassandra444Cassandra: http://cassandra.apache.org/, and Redis555Redis: https://redis.io/), two relational databases (MySQL666MySQL: https://www.mysql.com/ and VoltDB777VoltDB: https://www.voltdb.com/). In this regard, Kuhlenkamp et al. 3 conducted experiments on two NoSQL databases (i.e., Cassandra and HBase) from scalability and elasticity perspectives. The former work conducted on a private cloud, and the latter on a public cloud. Li et al. 5 investigated the performance of six distributed databases in terms of read, write, delete and instance initiate over a private cloud. Table 1 summarizes the studies on evaluation of NoSQL and relational databases deployed on cloud computing infrastructure. All the above-mentioned studies discuss throughput/performance, horizontal and vertical scalability of different NoSQL and relational databases in either private or public clouds, where the distance factor did not come into play. In contrast, distance between private and public cloud datacenters in a hybrid cloud can be an important factor that should be considered on the evaluation of distributed databases in terms of performance and scalability. Recently, we evaluated the throughput performance of distributed databases running in hybrid clouds without considering the distance factor 6. Thus, the main research question arises here is to what extent distance between private and public cloud datacenters can impact on the performance and scalability of distributed database systems?. An obvious answer to this question is the smaller distance between public and private cloud datacenters, the smaller is the impact on the databases performance. This solution might not be desirable for all business companies due to differential in their needs, for example, privacy and monetary cost. As an instance, a business company might select a cheaper cloud datacenter in East USA region rather than the one in Sydney region to deploy its database. This makes a compromise between performance and hardware infrastructure cost. Furthermore, a wider selection of cloud datacenters across the world (e.g., 58 Azure regions worldwide888Azure regions: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/regions/) provides more opportunities for business companies in public cloud datacenter selection in terms of distance to pair with their private cloud datacenter to build a hybrid cloud. Therefore, distance factor comes into play for building a hybrid cloud as an important research question stated above. To answer the above question, we have exploited an automated hybrid cloud that enabled us to pair a public datacenter in different regions with a private one in a flexible way 6. This implementation of hybrid cloud also allowed to select VM size, VMs number, desired database installation, database cluster configuration and so on. The selection of a public datacenter in a specific region depends on how much distance is desirable between private and public cloud datacenters. Since we intended to evaluate the effects of distance on performance of distributed databases, we chose public cloud datacenters in US East and Sydney regions as the closest and the farthest to a private cloud datacenter located in our Lab (Adelaide Uni), respectively. Moreover, we selected another public datacenter between the closest and the farthest datacanter from distance perspective, which led to the choice of a datacenter in West India (Mumbai) region. In addition to the above research question, we were also interested in investigating the impact of VM packing on the throughput of distributed databases running in a hybrid cloud. VM packing means that we deploy fewer VMs with more cores instead of more VMs with less core so that the total cores in both deployment is an equal number (e.g., 2 VMs with 4 cores each instead of 4 VMs with 2 cores each). This investigation helped us to demonstrate how much latency between VMs in a cloud datacenter can impact the throughput of distributed databases. In other word, the latency between VMs in a single cloud datacenter reduces to the latency between cores in a single VM, which might be effective means of a hybrid cloud deployment for distributed databases. There are several choices of distributed databases that can be evaluated for the impact of distance on their performance as deployed on a hybrid\ncloud 7. By thriving NoSQL in 2011 8, currently these are more than 225 NoSQL databases999NoSQL databases: http://nosql-database.org/; Among these databases, some are supported in a pre-installed and configured infrastructure component (e.g., MongoDB101010How to install and configure MongoDB on a Linux VM: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/install-mongodb and Cassandra111111Run Apache Cassandra on Azure VMs: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/cassandra databases by the well-known cloud providers). Based on the widespread usage and popularity, we selected six databases to benchmark the impact of distance on their performance, scalability, and VM packing: MongoDB121212MongoDB: www.mongodb.com, Cassandra131313Cassandra: http://cassandra.apache.org/, Riak141414Riak: https://riak.com/, CouchDB151515CouchDB: https://couchdb.apache.org/, Redis161616Redis:https://redis.io/, and MySQL171717MySQL:https://www.mysql.com/. We have investigated the impact of distance between cloud datacenters making a hybrid cloud on the performance and scalability of these databases. In this investigation, we answer the following Research Questions (RQs): RQ1: What is the impact of distance on the performance of widely used NoSQL and SQL databases in hybrid clouds? RQ2: To what extent, NoSQL and SQL databases are scalable in hybrid clouds? RQ3: What is the impact of VM packing on the performance of distributed databases in hybrid clouds? The reminder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature with respect to the performance evaluation of NoSQL databases and data-intensive applications on different models of cloud computing. Section 3 discusses the background for the model of hybrid cloud implemented and deployed, as well as distributed databases under test. Section 4 presents the experimental setup, and performance evaluation results, and then discusses our findings. Finally, Section 5 draws some conclusions and identifies the future work.\n\nReference markers found: [8]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]8: of these databases depends on their features (data model, data replication strategy, consistency mechanism) as well as the hardware underpinning the computing and storage infrastructures utilized [ref]8.
