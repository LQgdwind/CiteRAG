We refer to the model behavior on a set of features D={1,…,d}𝐷1…𝑑D=\\{1,\\dots,d\\} as a function ν:𝒫​(D)→ℝ:𝜈→𝒫𝐷ℝ\\nu:\\mathcal{P}(D)\\to\\mathbb{R}, where 𝒫​(D)𝒫𝐷\\mathcal{P}(D) refers to the power set of D𝐷D.\nWe denote ν0​(T):=ν​(T)−ν​(∅)assignsubscript𝜈0𝑇𝜈𝑇𝜈\\nu_{0}(T):=\\nu(T)-\\nu(\\emptyset), which is the default setting in game theory and also known as set function  .\nThe subsets S⊆D𝑆𝐷S\\subseteq D refer to the set of features (or players in game theory) of which the interaction is computed, where we use lower case letters for the cardinality, i.e. s:=|S|assign𝑠𝑆s:=|S|.\nThe maximum order interaction of interest is denoted with s0subscript𝑠0s_{0} and we use the set 𝒯k:={T⊆D:k≤t≤d−k}assignsubscript𝒯𝑘conditional-set𝑇𝐷𝑘𝑡𝑑𝑘\\mathcal{T}_{k}:=\\{T\\subseteq D:k\\leq t\\leq d-k\\} and the set of interactions 𝒮s0:={S⊆D∣s≤s0,S≠∅}assignsubscript𝒮subscript𝑠0conditional-set𝑆𝐷formulae-sequence𝑠subscript𝑠0𝑆\\mathcal{S}_{s_{0}}:=\\{S\\subseteq D\\mid s\\leq s_{0},S\\neq\\emptyset\\}.\nFor a subset T⊆D𝑇𝐷T\\subseteq D, we refer to the binary representation as ZT=(z1,…,zd)∈{0,1}dsubscript𝑍𝑇subscript𝑧1…subscript𝑧𝑑superscript01𝑑Z_{T}=(z_{1},\\dots,z_{d})\\in\\{0,1\\}^{d} with zi=𝟏​(i∈T)subscript𝑧𝑖1𝑖𝑇z_{i}=\\mathbf{1}(i\\in T) for i=1,…,d𝑖1…𝑑i=1,\\dots,d, where 𝟏1\\mathbf{1} refers to the indicator function.\nWe further denote the Shapley kernel   as μ​(t):=1d−1​(d−2t−1)−1assign𝜇𝑡1𝑑1superscriptbinomial𝑑2𝑡11\\mu(t):=\\frac{1}{d-1}\\binom{d-2}{t-1}^{-1}. Removal-based explanations [ref]9 consider a model that is trained on d𝑑d features, where the goal is to examine a model behavior that is defined on a subset of features.\nThe model behavior ν𝜈\\nu for a subset of features could, for instance, be a particular model prediction for one input (local explanation) or an overall measure of model performance (global explanation), if only this subset of features is known [ref]9.\nTo quantify the contribution for individual features, the change in model behavior is evaluated, if the feature is removed from the model.\nTo restrict a ML model on a subset of features, different feature removal techniques have been proposed, such as marginalization of features or retraining the model [ref]9.\nTo quantify the impact of a single feature i∈D𝑖𝐷i\\in D on the model behavior ν𝜈\\nu it is then intuitive to compute the difference δ{i}ν​(T)=ν​(T∪{i})−ν​(T)subscriptsuperscript𝛿𝜈𝑖𝑇𝜈𝑇𝑖𝜈𝑇\\delta^{\\nu}_{\\{i\\}}(T)=\\nu(T\\cup\\{i\\})-\\nu(T) for subsets T⊆D∖{i}𝑇𝐷𝑖T\\subseteq D\\setminus\\{i\\}.\nFor a distinct pair of features (i,j)𝑖𝑗(i,j) with i,j∈D𝑖𝑗𝐷i,j\\in D, a natural extension is δ{i,j}ν​(T)=ν​(T∪{i,j})−ν​(T)−δ{i}ν​(T)−δ{j}ν​(T)subscriptsuperscript𝛿𝜈𝑖𝑗𝑇𝜈𝑇𝑖𝑗𝜈𝑇subscriptsuperscript𝛿𝜈𝑖𝑇subscriptsuperscript𝛿𝜈𝑗𝑇\\delta^{\\nu}_{\\{i,j\\}}(T)=\\nu(T\\cup\\{i,j\\})-\\nu(T)-\\delta^{\\nu}_{\\{i\\}}(T)-\\delta^{\\nu}_{\\{j\\}}(T) for T∈D∖{i,j}𝑇𝐷𝑖𝑗T\\in D\\setminus\\{i,j\\}, i.e. subtracting the contribution of single features from the joint impact of both features.\nThe following definition generalizes this recursion and is known as discrete derivative or S𝑆S-derivative . For S⊆D𝑆𝐷S\\subseteq D the S-derivative of ν𝜈\\nu at T⊆D∖S𝑇𝐷𝑆T\\subseteq D\\setminus S is To obtain an attribution score, the marginal contributions on different subsets T⊆D∖S𝑇𝐷𝑆T\\subseteq D\\setminus S are aggregated using a specific summary technique.\nIn this work, we are interested in the approximation and extension of one particular summary technique for single features i∈D𝑖𝐷i\\in D, called the Shapley value [ref]35, independent of model behavior and feature removal. The SV is ISV​(i)=∑T⊆D∖{i}(d−t−1)!​t!d!​δ{i}ν​(T)superscript𝐼SV𝑖subscript𝑇𝐷𝑖𝑑𝑡1𝑡𝑑subscriptsuperscript𝛿𝜈𝑖𝑇I^{\\text{SV}}(i)=\\sum_{T\\subseteq D\\setminus\\{i\\}}\\frac{(d-t-1)!t!}{d!}\\delta^{\\nu}_{\\{i\\}}(T), i∈D𝑖𝐷i\\in D. The SV is the unique attribution method that fulfills the axioms: symmetry (attributions are independent of feature ordering), linearity (in terms of the model behavior ν𝜈\\nu), dummy (if a feature does not change ν𝜈\\nu then its attribution is zero) and efficiency (the sum of attributions are equal to ν0​(D)subscript𝜈0𝐷\\nu_{0}(D)) [ref]35.\nHowever, the SV does not give any information about the interactions between two or more features.\nA suitable extension of the SV for interactions of features S⊆D𝑆𝐷S\\subseteq D remains an open question, as different axiomatic extensions have been proposed   [ref]40.\nIn this work, we thus consider a broad class of interaction indices, known as CIIs  [ref]40, which subsumes popular choices. A CII is an interaction index of the form It was shown that every interaction index satisfying the generalized linearity, symmetry and dummy axioms can be represented as a CII .\nIf ∑t=0d−s(d−st)​ms​(t)=1superscriptsubscript𝑡0𝑑𝑠binomial𝑑𝑠𝑡subscript𝑚𝑠𝑡1\\sum_{t=0}^{d-s}\\binom{d-s}{t}m_{s}(t)=1, then the CII is also referred to as a cardinal-probabilistic interaction index (CPII) . In this paper, we present a unified approximation technique for arbitrary CIIs.\n\nReference markers found: [9]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]9: to the indicator function.\nWe further denote the Shapley kernel   as μ​(t):=1d−1​(d−2t−1)−1assign𝜇𝑡1𝑑1superscriptbinomial𝑑2𝑡11\\mu(t):=\\frac{1}{d-1}\\binom{d-2}{t-1}^{-1}.
