      "content": "Paper Title: An Empirical Evaluation of GDPR Compliance Violations in Android mHealth Apps\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe construction of A​C​P𝐴𝐶𝑃ACP relies on two kinds of techniques: the GUI analysis technique, which is used to identify the user input PHI; the data-flow analysis technique, which is used to filter out the non-collected PHI. GUI Analysis.\nTo analyze the user input PHI from the GUI of Android app, we need to render all the GUI layouts and identify the semantics of the user inputs. Note that our technique is extended based on UiRef .\nFirst, an APK file is disassembled using apktool . A file called public.xml is generated to store all the resource identifiers of layout widgets.\nSubsequently, a customized activity is injected into the APK, and the manifest file of the app is rewritten to register the injected activity as an entry point.\nAfter that, the APK is reassembled and installed on a live device. When the injected activity is launched, the layouts of the app are rendered iteratively by invoking the setContentView() API call.\nHowever, the dynamically generated text (e.g., label text set by the setText() API call) cannot be extracted in this way using UiRef .\nTo solve the problem, we also launch the activities declared in the AndroidManifest.xml file to render the corresponding layouts.\nOnce a current layout is loaded, its view hierarchy is dumped by UIAutomator .\nThen, the associated metadata of UI widgets are extracted from the view hierarchy, and each widget is represented as a four tuples form ⟨c​l​a​s​s,i​d,t​e​x​t,b​o​u​n​d⟩𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑\\langle class,id,text,bound\\rangle, where c​l​a​s​s𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠class denotes the widget type such as EditText. i​d𝑖𝑑id denotes the widget id stored in the public.xml file. t​e​x​t𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡text denotes the plain text presented in the widget. b​o​u​n​d𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑bound denotes the coordinate of the displayed widget. Next, we need to understand the semantics of the inputs. In general, there are two methods for developers to present the semantics of the inputs to help users understand what they are required to provide. The first method is presenting the semantics based on the hint text of the user input widget. The second method is leveraging a label widget to present the semantics. We call the two methods as the hint-based method and the label-based method. Two examples are illustrated in Fig. 4. The first example presents an EditText that uses the hint text “Add symptoms here” belongs to the hint-based method. The second example presents an EditText that shows semantics with a combined TextView belongs to the label-based method. For the hint-based method, we analyze the t​e​x​t𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡text value of the user input widget. The string value of the text is preprocessed by the NLP technique. Then it is split into a set of words. With such words, we construct a set of unigram phrases and a set of bigram phrases. After that, each phrase in the two sets is matched with the PHI items in P​S𝑃𝑆PS based on the introduced phrase similarity calculation method. If p​s∈P​S𝑝𝑠𝑃𝑆ps\\in PS is matched with a phrase, p​s𝑝𝑠ps is regarded as one user input PHI. If no p​s𝑝𝑠ps is matched, the given widget might use the label-based method. For the label-based method, the main challenge is to map the labels with their combined user input widgets.\nIn our work, we propose algorithm 1 to map the labels with user input widgets.\nAlgorithm 1 requires two inputs, L​B𝐿𝐵LB and U​I​W𝑈𝐼𝑊UIW. For each input widget in the U​I​W𝑈𝐼𝑊UIW, it is checked whether there are any labels in L​B𝐿𝐵LB that are closely placed on its left or above by using the function ConstructLeftLabelSet() and ConstructUpLabelSet(). The positional relations between the widgets are calculated based on their extracted b​o​u​n​d𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑bound values. Finally, for each pair in the output M𝑀M, the t​e​x​t𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡text value of the label will be matched with the PHI items in the same way as solving the hint-based way to identify the user input PHI. Data-flow Analysis.\nNote that the user input PHI cannot be directly added into the A​C​P𝐴𝐶𝑃ACP since the app might not store them.\nThus, in our approach, the data-flow analysis technique is used to recognize the point of getting specified data and to further check the destination of fetched data. We conduct the data flow analysis based on static analysis tools such as FlowDroid \nand VulHunter , which are implemented based on the Soot framework . Notably, to enhance the static analysis accuracy, IccTA  is employed to identify the source and the target of intents, and EdgeMiner [ref]42 is utilized to determine the implicit callbacks (e.g., from setOnClickListener() to onClick()). The data-flow analysis includes three main parts, listing as below: Data Sources. The data sources are the points that we obtain the PHI which will be tracked. We focus on the user input PHI and the API call findViewById() is selected as the data source. Data Propagation. To track the data propagation in the app code, we leverage the taint propagation techniques . In detail, the data sources are initially assigned with a unique taint tag. Then, the taint tag will be propagated based on the direct data flow propagations according to the intermediate representation extracted by Soot. Data Sinks. The data sinks are the data use points of the tainted variables. There are six different kinds of data storage methods, including writing data into a log (e.g., Log.d()) or a file (e.g., FileoutputStream.write()), or sending data out through network (e.g., HttpClient.execute())) or short messages (e.g., SmsManager.sendTextMessage()), or inserting the data into a database (e.g., SQLiteDatabase.update()) or the content provider (e.g., ContentResolver.insert()). Note that, we also need to link the data flows with their corresponding widget objects.\nWe resolve the argument value of the findViewById() API call, and the argument value demonts the id of the specific wedget object. In summary, if an app collects one PHI and stores the data with the above six methods, the PHI is added into A​C​P𝐴𝐶𝑃ACP.\nFinally, one inconsistent behavior is discovered if there exists an item in A​C​P𝐴𝐶𝑃ACP that is not contained in D​C​P𝐷𝐶𝑃DCP.\n\nReference markers found: [42]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]42: VulHunter , which are implemented based on the Soot framework . Notably, to enhance the static analysis accuracy, IccTA  is employed to identify the source and the target of intents, and EdgeMiner [ref]42 is utilized to determine the implicit callbacks (e.g., from setOnClickListener() to onClick()).
