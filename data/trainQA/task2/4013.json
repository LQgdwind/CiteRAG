      "content": "Paper Title: FeatER: An Efficient Network for Human Reconstruction via Feature Map-Based TransformER\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUnderstanding human structure from monocular images is one of the fundamental topics in computer vision. The corresponding tasks of Human Pose Estimation (HPE) and Human Mesh Reconstruction (HMR) have received a growing interest from researchers, accelerating progress toward various applications such as VR/AR, virtual try-on, and AI coaching. However, HPE and HMR from a single image still remain challenging tasks due to depth ambiguity, occlusion, and complex human body articulation. With the blooming of deep learning techniques, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  0 [ref]34 architectures have been extensively utilized in vision tasks and have achieved impressive performance. Most existing HPE and HMR models [ref]34  utilize CNN-based architectures (such as ResNet 0 and HRNet [ref]34) to predict feature maps, which are supervised by the ground-truth 2D heatmap representation (encodes the position of each keypoint into a feature map with a Gaussian distribution) as shown in Fig. ¬†1.\nThis form of output representation and supervision can make the training process smoother, and therefore has become the de facto process in HPE‚Äôs networks  [ref]34 . Recently, the transformer architecture has been fruitfully adapted from the field of natural language processing (NLP) into computer vision, where it has enabled state-of-the-art performance in HPE and HMR tasks     .\nThe transformer architecture demonstrates a strong ability to model global dependencies in comparison to CNNs via its self-attention mechanism. The long-range correlations between tokens can be captured, which is critical for modeling the dependencies of different human body parts in HPE and HMR tasks.\nSince feature maps concentrate on certain human body parts, we aim to utilize the transformer architecture to refine the coarse feature maps (extracted by a CNN backbone).\nAfter capturing the global correlations between human body parts, more accurate pose and mesh can be obtained.\n However, inheriting from NLP where transformers embed each word to a feature vector, Vision Transformer architectures such as ViT  can only deal with the flattened features when modeling attention. This is less than ideal for preserving the structural context of the feature maps during the refinement stage (feature maps with the shape of [n,h,w]ùëõ‚Ñéùë§[n,h,w] need to be flattened as [n,d]ùëõùëë[n,d], where d=h√ówùëë‚Ñéùë§d=h\\times w. Here nùëõn is the number of feature maps, h‚Ñéh and wùë§w are height and width of each feature map, respectively). Furthermore, another issue is that the large embedding dimension caused by the flattening process makes the transformer computationally expensive. This is not suitable for real-world applications of HPE and HMR, which often demand real-time processing capabilities on deployed devices (e.g. AR/VR headsets). Therefore, we propose a Feature map-based transformER (FeatER) architecture to properly refine the coarse feature maps through global correlations of structural information in a resource-friendly manner. Compared to the vanilla transformer architecture, FeatER has two advantages: First, FeatER preserves the feature map representation in the transformer encoder when modeling self-attention, which is naturally adherent with the HPE and HMR tasks. Rather than conducting the self-attention based on flattened features, FeatER ensures that the self-attention is conducted based on the original 2D feature maps, which are more structurally meaningful.\nTo accomplish this, FeatER is designed with a novel dimensional decomposition strategy to handle the extracted stack of 2D feature maps. Second, this decompositional design simultaneously provides a significant reduction in computational cost compared with the vanilla transformer\n111For example, there are 32 feature maps with overall dimension [ref]32  326464[ref]32  . For a vanilla transformer, without discarding information, the feature maps need to be flattened into [ref]32 [ref]32 . One vanilla transformer block requires 4.3G MACs. Even if we reduce the input size to [ref]32 024321024[ref]32 024, it still requires 0.27G MACs. However, given the original input of [ref]32  326464[ref]32  , FeatER only requires 0.09G MACs.. This makes FeatER more suitable for the needs of real-world applications. Equipped with FeatER, we present an efficient framework for human representation tasks including 2D HPE, 3D HPE, and HMR. For the more challenging 3D HPE and HMR portion, a feature map reconstruction module is integrated into the framework. Here, a subset of feature maps are randomly masked and then reconstructed by FeatER, enabling more robust 3D pose and mesh predictions for in-the-wild inference. We conduct extensive experiments on human representation tasks, including 2D human pose estimation on COCO, 3D human pose estimation and human mesh reconstruction on Human3.6M and 3DPW datasets. Our method (FeatER) consistently outperforms SOTA methods on these tasks with significant computation and memory cost reduction (e.g. FeatER outperforms MeshGraphormer  with only requiring 5% of Params and 16% of MACs).\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: image still remain challenging tasks due to depth ambiguity, occlusion, and complex human body articulation.
