      "content": "Paper Title: Cross-Layer Encrypted Semantic Communication Framework for Panoramic Video Transmission\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nTraditional panoramic video transmission schemes employ bitrate selection, resource allocation, and other strategies to achieve low-latency and high transmission performance metrics , [ref]32, . In the context of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA), Guo et al. constructed a MIMO-OFDMA system for adaptive panoramic video transmission . This system is capable of adaptively selecting the quality of tiles, transmission power, and beamforming based on the current environment. Using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), Li et al. proposed a NOMA-assisted VR content transmission scheme aimed at minimizing the cost-oriented towards QoS [ref]35. As demands continue to rise, these traditional transmission schemes have become inadequate. In order to achieve efficient video transmission, there has been a lot of research on how to employ neural networks for video transmission. Li et al. build the deep contextual video compression (DCVC) network , which extracts rich high-dimensional contextual information by the correlation between frames to transmit videos. After that, Wang et al. of  proposed the deep video semantic transmission (DVST) network, which takes the semantic communication into account. The DVST network achieves semantic transmission of video by nonlinear transforms and deep joint source-channel coding (Deep JSCC) under the guidance of the entropy model. T.-Y et al. proposed the DeepWiVe , which builds on Deep JSCC and employs reinforcement learning to train a bandwidth allocation network. This optimizes the distribution strategy of limited available channel bandwidth across video frames. If panoramic videos are transmitted directly by these networks, there would be a large information redundancy and a decrease in the quality of the immersive experience. Therefore, an efficient framework for the semantic transmission of panoramic video needs to be designed.\n\nReference markers found: [32]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]32: Traditional panoramic video transmission schemes employ bitrate selection, resource allocation, and other strategies to achieve low-latency and high transmission performance metrics , [ref]32, .
