Among them, many neural network based approaches 0      show remarkable performance in handling image dehazing problem.\nSpecifically, benefiting from powerful network modules and vast training data, the end-to-end approaches deliver promising results.\nHowever, as the distribution of haze becomes more complicated and non-homogeneous, many of them fail to achieve satisfying results.\nThe reason for such failures is because the thickness of the non-homogeneous haze is not determined entirely by the depth of the background scene. Although researchers have made tremendous efforts collecting data with non-homogeneous haze, e.g., the NH-HAZE datasets   , the quantity is still limited.\nA common belief is that models are prone to encounter the overfitting problems when training a deep neural network from scratch with such small datasets.\nA naive solution is to combine all the available non-homogeneous haze datasets together to form a relatively larger dataset.\nHowever, due to the differences between datasets caused by a variety of factors, such as color distortion, objects complexity and camera capability, it has been shown that a direct combination actually compromises the dehazing performance on individual datasets .\nIt remains a serious challenge to find a robust solution to cope with the practical situation where both the quality and quantity of the available data limited.\n To address the above-mentioned problems, we adopt the two-branch framework consisting of state-of-the-art backbone networks, with a novel data-preprocessing transformation applied on the NH-HAZE datasets from previous years.\nMotivated by the idea of data-centric AI that machine learning has matured to a point that high-performance model architectures are widely available, while approaches to engineering datasets have lagged  , we put much effort in engineering the data.\nInspired by the promising performance of gamma correction [ref]37 5, we propose a simple yet effective RGB-channel-wise data-preprocessing approach.\nWe demonstrate its suitability for this competition setting, and argue that it is prospective to be the principle for augmenting similar dataset.\nDetails of this data-centric AI inspired preprocessing approach are discussed in later sections.\nRegarding to the network architecture, we design our model under the two-branch framework [ref]37 5 .\nIn the first branch, we adopt the Swin Transformer V2 model  pre-trained on ImageNet dataset 2 as the encoder.\nThe powerful Swin Transformer is accredited to be able to supersede the previous methods in many contexts of transfer learning, where the knowledge gained from large-scale benchmark is adapted to task-specific datasets  . Such pertinent features are of vital importance when dealing with small real-world non-homogeneous datasets [ref]37.\nAlongside a refined decoder and skip connections, the first branch extracts multi-level features of the hazy images.\nThe second branch is introduced to complement the knowledge learned from the pre-trained model by exclusively working on the domain of target data.\nFor simplicity, we follows [ref]37 to build the second branch with a RCAN .\nSince there is no down-sampling and up-sampling operations in the second branch, we expect it to extract features distinct from the ones obtained by the first branch.\nFinally, a fusion tail aggregates the results from both branches and produces dehazed output images.\n Overall, our contributions are summarized as follows.\nFirstly we put forward a simple but effective data-preprocessing approach inspired by data-centric AI, leveraging extra data to significantly enhance our model.\nSecondly, we incorporate the state-of-the-art backbone in the two-branch framework.\nBy carefully balancing the two branches, our model demonstrates promising results using limit-sized datasets, and outperforms other current approaches adopting this pipeline.\nFinally, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the competitive performance of our proposed method.\nWith substantial ablation study on different combinations of models and data, we hope to convince the future competition participants to pay equal attention to model design and data engineering.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: and computer vision models are prone to fail in hazy scenes.\nThese make image dehazing an important low-level vision task, and many methods have been proposed to tackle this challenge   0        [ref]37 5 .
