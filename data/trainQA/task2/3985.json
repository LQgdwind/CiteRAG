      "content": "Paper Title: An adaptive admittance controller for collaborative drilling with a robot based on subtask classification via deep learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nAs a more promising approach for improving the efficiency in pHRI, machine/deep learning methods have gained a considerable attention recently, due to their flexibility, portability, and task independence. Significant amount of research has been conducted on using supervised learning methods for adaptive control in pHRI.\nSeveral studies have utilized visual and auditory information such as images, videos, and voice signals to detect human intention via a learning model   . For example, Liu et al.  trained a deep learning model utilizing body posture, hand gesture, and voice command together to adapt an interaction controller. The problem with such systems is that they require external cameras and motion capture systems for implementation. Furthermore, a large number of images needs to be captured and processed for training the learning model. As an alternative to audiovisual signals in detecting human intention, some researchers have chosen surface electromyography (sEMG) signals, arguing that it directly shows the activation levels of muscles in human limbs, thereby providing a more direct interface of predicting what the human operator is trying to do. Delpreto and Rus  used EMG signals for tuning an adaptive controller in a robot-assisted lifting task. Grafakos et al.  proposed a variable admittance control scheme utilizing EMG signals as input to minimize human effort. Wu et al.  developed a variable impedance controller utilizing EMG signals to teach a robot how to perform a collaborative task via the Learning from Demonstration (LfD) method. Sirintuna et al.  trained an ANN model using EMG signals to predict the direction of movement intended by the human, and then adapted an admittance controller to confine the human motion to the predicted direction. The fundamental shortcoming of using EMG signals for human intention prediction is that they require additional equipment attached to human limbs, reducing their practicality in pHRI tasks performed in manufacturing environments. EMG data also requires additional preprocessing since the ranges of EMG signals may vary across the trials of a user and also among the different users. Some other researchers have opted to simply use kinematic data such as end-effector velocity or kinetic data such as interaction force, to train supervised learning models. Such methods are more practical since velocity can be easily obtained by differentiating the position and force/torque sensors are typically available in collaborative robots nowadays. Sam Ge et al.  developed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to recognize human intention using kinematic data, including end-effector velocity. Li et al.  utilized ANNs in a similar manner to estimate the human arm impedance and the desired trajectory of the human operator. Rozo et al. [ref]33 utilized end-effector position and interaction force together to train a machine learning algorithm for LfD to estimate human arm stiffness and desired movement trajectories in cooperative transportation and assembly tasks. Sharkawy et al.  trained an ANN model online for a collaborative manipulation task and adjusted the admittance mass of the controller to obtain a manipulation trajectory that is close to the minimum-jerk trajectory. Some researchers have argued the importance of learning interaction patterns from human dyads to transfer this knowledge to human-robot collaboration. Madan et al.  used support vector machine (SVM) classifier to successfully learn three interaction types from the velocity and force data of collaborating human dyads: 1) work in harmony, 2) cope with conflicts, or 3) remain passive during interaction. Al-Saadi et al.  showed that a set of features derived from force data alone is sufficient for the successful classification of interactive motor behaviors encountered in human dyads during collaborative object manipulation. Townsend et al.  used velocity and acceleration signals acquired from human dyads in co-manipulation tasks to train an ANN model that predicts velocity values for a few time steps into the future. They then deployed that model to adjust an adaptive impedance controller in human-robot collaboration to perform the same task. Thanks in large part to the unpredictable and highly nonlinear movement behavior of the human operator under different conditions, reinforcement learning (RL) is also a popular choice of machine learning method for adaptive control or intention recognition in pHRI. Dimeas and Asparagathos  proposed to utilize minimum jerk as a reward function for a reinforcement learning method with the objective of altering the admittance damping in an optimum manner. This method may not work well in pHRI tasks for manufacturing since they typically involve contact with a stiff environment and hence rapid change in the closed-loop dynamics, which results in a jerky response in the velocity and force profiles. Wu et al. [ref]37 used RL, specifically Q-Learning, to optimize an adaptive impedance controller for a co-manipulation task. They aimed to achieve a desired motion trajectory while minimizing the internal forces acted on the manipulated object and the total energy consumption. Ghadirzadeh et al.  developed a Q-learning approach so that a user collaborating with a robot can keep a ball rolling on a beam at a desired target location with minimum effort. They trained a Gaussian process regressor as the Q-function to estimate the outcome of state-action pairs instead of interacting with the robot directly. They then selected policies in adjusting the impedance of the controller such that the interaction force is minimized during the task. Buchli et al.  used a PI2 method (Policy Improvement with Path Integrals) for optimizing an adaptive impedance control via gain scheduling to minimize the control effort. Du et al.  utilized the fuzzy Sarsa(λ𝜆\\lambda)-Learning method for minimizing the jerk in human hand during a minimally invasive robotic surgery task via adaptive admittance control in joint space, taking inputs from joint external torques, and combining them with joint velocities and accelerations as state variables.\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: using kinematic data, including end-effector velocity.
