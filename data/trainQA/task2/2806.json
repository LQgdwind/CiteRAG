Note that these instances may follow completely different distributions from ours, such as clustered customer locations, corner depot location, etc. We report the results on instances with size between 50 and 200 for TSPLIB; and size between 100 and 200 for CVRPLIB. As recorded in Table 4 and 5, we first compare our DACT with Wu et¬†al.  in the first group of columns to verify the superior performance of DACT to the existing Transformer based improvement model. In the second group of columns, we report the performance of several strong baselines including, 1) OR-Tools¬†, 2) AM-sampling¬†[ref]5, 3) POMO √ó\\times8 augment¬†, the state-of-the-art neural construction solver, and 4) the enhanced variant of Wu et¬†al. , which samples MùëÄM actions to produce multiple solutions at each step and retrieves the best one as the next state. We present the performance of our DACT with and without augments in the last group of columns.\nFor TSPLIB, we infer the first 5 instances (size <99absent99\\!<\\!99) using DACT model trained on TSP50 and the remaining ones using model trained on TSP100. For CVRPLIB, we infer all instances using DACT model trained on CVRP100 since all the sizes are larger than 100. For AM-sampling and POMO, we use the trained models of our sizes which are provided by the authors. The results of Wu et¬†al.  and OR-Tools are adapted from\nWu et¬†al. .\nThe gaps are calculated based on the optimal solutions provided in the datasets. And we test our DACT for 10 runs and report the average and the best gaps. We also list the average gaps for instances in different problem size intervals, i.e., [50, 100), [100, 150) and   for TSPLIB; and [100, 150) and   for CVRPLIB.\n\nReference markers found: [39]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]39: We now evaluate the generalization performance of DACT by applying the trained models in Section¬†5 to solve instances from two well-known benchmark datasets, i.e., TSPLIB¬† and CVRPLIB¬†[ref]39, respectively.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3.
