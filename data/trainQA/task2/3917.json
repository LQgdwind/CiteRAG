      "content": "Paper Title: Trustworthy Graph Neural Networks: Aspects, Methods and Trends\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nExplainers for GNNs include gradient/feature-based methods, perturbation-based methods, surrogate methods, decomposition methods, and generation methods.\nGradient/Feature-based Methods.\nGradient-based methods employ different types of gradient processing to obtain an estimation of the contribution made by components in the input samples. These methods produce local explanations for current samples by calculating the gradients of GNNs on input space. Gradient-based methods treat input samples, rather than model parameters, as variables of GNNs, and utilise the backpropagation mechanism to obtain the gradients of GNNs on the input space. For example, a method called SA [ref]145 uses the square value of gradients to define the contribution of components (e.g., nodes, edges or node features) in the current graph. Feature-based methods use mappings from embedding space to input space to evaluate the contribution made by components in the input samples. For example, Pope et al. [ref]58 propose an algorithm called CAM, which maps the embedding in the last layer to the input space by means of weighted summation. The mapping weights come from the last fully-connected layer used for the final prediction.\nThe main differences between feature-based methods are the mapping construction methods employed.\nMoreover, according to a recent study , introducing regularisation terms (i.e., batch representation orthnormalisation and Gini regularisation ) can improve feature-based methods like CAM [ref]58 and Grad-CAM [ref]58. Perturbation-based Methods. The counterfactual explanation describes causality as “If X had not occurred, Y would not have occurred”  . In the context of explainers for GNNs, when removing one edge, node or changing one node feature from the explanation for the current output, GNNs will generate a different output if the removed or changed component is a counterfactual explanation for the current output. Accordingly, different from gradient/feature-based methods, perturbation-based methods attempt to find the counterfactual explanation  or underlying cause   [ref]149 for GNNs by perturbing components of the graphs. Specifically, perturbation-based methods apply masks to edges, nodes, or node features to filter out the most essential components, which serve as explanations for GNNs. It is expected that the predictions of GNNs on explanations will be similar to those on input samples. For example, GNNExplainer  utilises mutual information to train mask generators, which can provide explanations for both node classification and graph classification.\nDifferences between perturbation-based methods stem primarily from their mask types, metrics for component importance, mask generation algorithms, and the forms taken by their explanations (e.g., edges, features or subgraphs).\n\nSurrogate Methods.\nIt is sometimes difficult to employ gradient/feature-based methods and permutation-based methods that require internal knowledge about GNNs (e.g., node embedding in PGExplainer ) because access to the GNN system may be limited (e.g., only queries are allowed).\nA practical solution is to employ interpretable and straightforward models (i.e., surrogates) to simulate the input-output mapping in target GNNs. By considering the similarity between the input samples and their neighbour samples, the functionally similar surrogate model can interpret the local behaviours of target GNNs to some extent. For example, a method called PGM-Explainer  perturbs node features to obtain similar samples, then employs an interpretable Bayesian network to provide explanations.\nSurrogate methods are generally model-agnostic; their differences mainly lie in the neighbour sampling strategies and interpretable surrogate models employed.\n\nDecomposition Methods. Unlike the above methods, decomposition methods distribute the prediction score of GNNs on samples to the input space according to certain decomposition rules that help identify which components of the input space provide the greatest contribution to the prediction of GNNs. For example, the GNN-LRP  algorithm employs Taylor decomposition as rules to model interactions between GNN layers and then identifies a collection of walks to explain the output of GNNs.\nFor decomposition methods, the decomposition rules are the main differences between them. Generation Methods. In generation methods, explanations for GNNs are produced directly from the explanation generator module by employing graph generation methods based on reinforcement learning (RL) or other frameworks.\nFor example, a method called XGNN  aims to obtain a graph pattern that maximises the prediction of GNNs on the target class, after which this graph pattern is used as an explanation for GNNs.\nThis approach formulates graph generation as a reinforcement learning task. In each step of graph generation, XGNN makes an edge-adding decision based on the existing graph pattern. It uses policy gradients and feedback from GNNs to train the graph pattern generator.\nIn comparison to other methods, the class-level explanation obtained from XGNN provides a high-level understanding of GNNs and a human-intelligible subgraph explanation of GNNs for graph classification.\nIn addition to using reinforcement learning frameworks (e.g., XGNN , RG-Explainer ), other graph generation frameworks can also be employed to provide GNN explanations. For example, adopting a causal theory perspective, Lin et al. propose a method called OrphicX  based on the variational graph auto-encoder (VGAE). Others.\nThis category contains methods that cannot be categorised into the above post-hoc explanation methods. For example, Feng et al.  propose a method called DEGREE to estimate the contribution score of nodes and employ an agglomeration algorithm to complete the explanation subgraph construction. In DEGREE, based on the forward operation decomposition on GNN layers, the node contribution is calculated as the relative contribution (like the Shapely value ) when adding the target node to its contexts.\nAbrate and Bonchi  propose a heuristic-search method called OFS+OBS that finds counterfactual graphs to explain graph classification results on brain networks.\nLin et al.  propose a framework called Gem to train an explanation generator; under this approach, the ground-truth explanations in training data are distilled through combining predefined rules and queries on target GNNs. In addition to the above methods, some model-agnostic methods for general AI can also be extended to explain GNNs. For example, IG , DeepLIFT  and CXPlain  can be transferred to the graph domain to provide explanations for graph classification [ref]149. In the Knowledge column, “White/Grey/Black-box” indicate that the target GNN is treated as a white/grey/black box when obtaining explanations on it. The “GC”, “LP”, “NC”, “SEL” and “MQA” in the Task column represent graph classification, link prediction, node classification, semantic role labelling, and multi-hop question answering, respectively. Remarks.\nAfter obtaining explanations of GNNs via the above methods, it is possible to evaluate the quality of these explanations through visualisation and accuracy-related metrics (see Section I-C).\nIn Appendix A, we present related resources for studying the explainability of GNNs.\n\nReference markers found: [145]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]145: treat input samples, rather than model parameters, as variables of GNNs, and utilise the backpropagation mechanism to obtain the gradients of GNNs on the input space. For example, a method called SA [ref]145 uses the square value of gradients to define the contribution of components (e.g., nodes, edges or node features) in the current graph. Feature-based methods use mappings from embedding\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
