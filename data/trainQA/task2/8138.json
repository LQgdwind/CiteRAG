      "content": "Paper Title: Evaluating the Efficacy of Instance Incremental vs. Batch Learning in Delayed Label Environments: An Empirical Study on Tabular Data Streaming for Fraud Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe consider two types of datasets: (1) benchmark datasets for generated binary classification, well-known in the literature on evolving data streams [ref]17 [ref]26  [ref]21, denoted as generated benchmark, and (2) a real-world bank transfer Fraud detection dataset. Generated benchmark.\nThe datasets in this benchmark are publicly available and are summarized in Table 2: AGRa [ref]17 [ref]26 : This dataset includes six discrete features and three continuous features. Instances are categorized into two classes using various functions, some of which adhere to decision rules, making it conducive to decision tree analysis. An abrupt drift occurs after every 250,000 instances (three in total). AGRg [ref]17 [ref]26 : Similar to AGRa. Here, a gradual drift is used. HYPERf [ref]17 [ref]26 [ref]21: Simulates an incremental (fast) drift by changing the equation of hyperplane separating the two classes over time. This dataset is, therefore, linear model friendly. The number of features is set to 10. SEAa[ref]17 [ref]26 [ref]21:\nIt comprises three continuous features (x1,x2,x3)subscriptùë•1subscriptùë•2subscriptùë•3(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}), with only the first two being pertinent to the target class. The first two dimensions are divided into four blocks. Within each block, an instance is assigned to class 1 if x1+x2‚â§Œ∏subscriptùë•1subscriptùë•2ùúÉx_{1}+x_{2}\\leq\\theta, and to class 0 otherwise, with Œ∏ùúÉ\\theta taking values from the set 8,9,7,9.58979.5{8,9,7,9.5}. Additionally, an abrupt drift occurs after every 250,000 instances (three in total). SEAg [ref]17 [ref]26: Similar to SEAa. Here, a gradual drift is employed rather than an abrupt one. Induce label delay in the generated benchmark.\nFirst, 10% of each dataset (100,000 instances) is reserved as offline collected data, used for hyperparameter tuning [ref]26 and pretraining an initial model [ref]21 in both instance incremental and batch incremental learning.\nTherefore, 90% of each dataset is used for stream (online) evaluation. Each evaluation batch (Algorithm 1) contains approximately 1% of the dataset. Specifically, the evaluation batch size is generated following a Poisson distribution with a mean of 10,000.\nThis varying evaluation batch size effectively reflects real-world settings, where monitoring logs of deployed learning systems must be displayed periodically (every day, week, or year, depending on the stream‚Äôs speed). However, the number of instances may vary from one period to another.\nIn this study, we generated the label delay by assuming it is stochastic and follows a Poisson distribution.\nMore precisely, we assume that the delay Œî‚Äãt‚Äã(ùê±ùê¢)Œîùë°subscriptùê±ùê¢\\Delta t(\\mathbf{x_{i}}) for each instance observation ùê±ùê¢subscriptùê±ùê¢\\mathbf{x_{i}} follows a Poisson distribution with a mean of Œ±√ó10,000ùõº10000\\alpha\\times 10,000 instances, where Œ±‚àà{0,0.1,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}ùõº00.11234567\\alpha\\in\\{0,0.1,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\}.\nFraud dataset.\nThe task consists in using known information about fraudulent bank transfer scenarios (via supervised machine learning) to assign a fraud score to each newly added IBAN (International Bank Account Number). Specifically, the goal is to predict the probability that a new IBAN will be used for fraudulent transfers within the next 30 days.\nThe motivation for investigating instance incremental learning is the variation in label delay based on class labels. Most fraudulent IBANs are identified within a few days, while the remaining IBANs are automatically labeled as genuine after 30 days.\nHence, one might question whether quickly adapting the learning model with these fraudulent instances could yield better performance compared to a batch learning strategy, where the model is updated only after collecting labels for at least a month. For example, in batch learning, labels from September are collected by the end of October, and the model is updated in early November, whereas instance incremental learning updates the model with September‚Äôs fraudulent data as soon as it becomes available.\nA key challenge is the class imbalance, where only about 0.10% of instances are fraudulent on average. As a result, it is necessary to store at least 99.90% of instances for 30 days due to label delay. Additionally, unlike datasets in the Generated benchmark, this dataset may experience various types of drift, such as gradual drift combining abrupt changes, and some concepts may reoccur over time.\nThe sample used in this study comprises approximately 6.5 million observations collected from September 2021 to August 2022.\nThe initial three months (September, October, and November) are reserved as offline collection for hyperparameter optimization and initial model training. The stream evaluation spans eight months (from January 2022 to August 2022), with each month comprising approximately 540,000 instances.\n\nReference markers found: [17]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]17: We consider two types of datasets: (1) benchmark datasets for generated binary classification, well-known in the literature on evolving data streams [ref]17 [ref]26  [ref]21, denoted as generated benchmark, and (2) a real-world bank transfer Fraud detection dataset.
