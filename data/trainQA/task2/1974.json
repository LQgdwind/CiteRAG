      "content": "Paper Title: Reconstructive Sequence-Graph Network for Video Summarization\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nDatasets. Five datasets are employed in our experiment. SumMe contains 25 videos with durations varying from 1.5min to 6.5min. Each video is annotated by 15–18 users with both frame-level importance scores and shot-based video summaries. TVsum has 50 videos with durations varying from 2min to 10min. Each video is annotated by 20 users with shot-level importance scores, where the shots are manually generated by segmenting the videos into two-second clips. Following existing protocols, 80% videos are used for training and the rest 20% are for testing on both the SumMe and TVsum datasets. Besides, the key-frame based summary datasets, OVP  and YouTube , are exploited to augment the training data. They contain 89 videos totally. VTW is a much larger dataset originally proposed for video captioning. It contains 18100 videos, 2529 of which are annotated with shot-based video highlights. In our work, they are adopted for evaluation by transferring the annotations into frame-level importance scores. Concretely, the highlighted part is scored with 1 and others are 0. Preprocessing.\nSimilar to existing approaches  2 [ref]48, the pool5 layer of GoogLeNet is adopted for frame feature extraction [ref]38, whose dimensionality is 1024. Besides, each video is segmented into shots by KTS [ref]33, which is a widely used video temporal segmentation method in the video summarization task. Evaluation.\nThe summarization performance is evaluated according to the overlap between the generated summaries and human-created summaries. In our work, F-measure is adopted as the evaluation metric, which is widely used in the summarization task 0 . Specifically, for both the SumMe and TVsum dataset, each video is annotated with multiple human-created summaries. Following existing protocols, the generated summary is compared with these human-created summaries one-by-one for each video. On SumMe, the maximum evaluation score is taken as the final result. On TVsum, the average of these scores is taken as the final result.\nFurthermore, considering that the summarization results vary largely among videos, the cross-validation is performed in the experiment to make the reported results more convincing.\nTo be specific, the dataset is randomly split into training set (80%) and testing set (20%) for 5 independent times. For each split, we train our model on the training set and test it on the corresponding testing set. So, we get 5 results from 5 splits. The final metric is obtained by averaging the 5 results. This strategy is widely adopted in existing approaches   0 2 . In addition, we demonstrate the performance of our approach in terms of rank-based statistics (Kendall’s τ𝜏\\tau and Spearman’s ρ𝜌\\rho), which provide additional information on the behavior of summarization approaches .\n\nReference markers found: [48]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]48: evaluation by transferring the annotations into frame-level importance scores.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
