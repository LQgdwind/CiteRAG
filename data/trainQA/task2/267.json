      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Relevance and Sequence Modeling in Language Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nWe propose to use a simplified version of the LSTM function, the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architecture [ref]42 in the end-to-end model. The GRUs combine the input and forget gate into one single gate and in many tasks, the GRUs that have a relatively smaller number of parameters are shown to achieve or improve over the performance of LSTMs . Even with LSTM/GRU models, the direct modeling of long sequences can be cumbersome¬†. In order to model such long sequences, we propose a novel hierarchical bidirectional GRU  network with attention in this paper. The block schematic of the proposed model is given in Fig.¬†3.\nAt the first layer, a 256256256 cell unidirectional GRU block accumulates information across a window of 200200200 msec. i.e, a sequence of 202020 feature vectors with a shift of 100100100 msec. over the entire input sequence. The output from the first layer is a sequence of vectors that are sampled every 100100100 msec. with each vector representing information from overlapping 200200200 msec. segments of input speech. This is then fed to the second layer of GRU block with 512512512 cells where the information is accumulated over a window of 111 sec. The accumulated 111 sec. vectors from second layer are fed to the final bidirectional GRU layer  with 512512512 cells in the third layer. \n\n\n\nCluster\nTarget Languages\nHours\n\n\n\nArabic\n\n\n\nEgyptian Arabic (ara-arz)\n\nIraqi Arabic (ara-acm)\n\nLevantine Arabic (ara-apc)\n\nMaghrebi Arabic (ara-ary)\n\n\n\n\n190.9\n\n130.8\n\n440.7\n\n81.8\n\n\nChinese\n\n\n\nMandarin (zho-cmn)\n\nMin Nan (zho-nan)\n\n\n\n\n379.4\n\n13.3\n\n\nEnglish\n\n\n\nBritish English (eng-gbr)\n\nGeneral American English (eng-usg)\n\n\n\n\n4.8\n\n327.7\n\n\nSlavic\n\n\n\nPolish (qsl-pol)\n\nRussian (qsl-rus)\n\n\n\n\n59.3\n\n69.5\n\n\nIberian\n\n\n\nCaribbean Spanish (spa-car)\n\nEuropean Spanish (spa-eur)\n\nLatin American Continental Spanish (spa-lac)\n\nBrazilian Portuguese (por-brz)\n\n\n\n\n166.3\n\n24.7\n\n175.9\n\n4.1\n\n\n The output of the three layer hierarchical GRU model contains representations at 111 sec. level.

Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. For each [ref] marker, provide detailed reasoning explaining why the predicted titles are relevant\n2. The reasoning should analyze the specific context around each [ref] marker\n3. Explain how each title connects to the research topic, methodology, or problem being discussed\n4. This reasoning helps prevent hallucination by grounding predictions in the actual context\n5.
