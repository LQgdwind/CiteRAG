      "content": "Paper Title: Wasserstein barycenters are NP-hard to computeThis work was partially supported by NSF Graduate Research Fellowship 1122374, a Siebel PhD Fellowship, and a TwoSigma PhD fellowship.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nMany algorithms have been proposed. However, all of them have running time which scales exponentially in at least one of the input parameters, and/or do not provably compute arbitrarily close approximations, described below. The purpose of this paper is to show that this is unavoidable in the sense that under standard complexity-theoretic assumptions, there is no algorithm that provably computes Wasserstein barycenters in polynomial time. A popular approach is to use “fixed-support approximations”; that is, assume that the barycenter is supported on a guessed set S⊂ℝd𝑆superscriptℝ𝑑S\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{d} of points, and then optimize over the corresponding weights, see, e.g.,        [ref]34 among many others. The point of this fixed-support approximation is that it reduces the barycenter problem to a polynomial-size LP—which can then be solved efficiently using out-of-the-box LP solvers or specially-tailored approaches such as entropic regularization—if the set S𝑆S has polynomial size. However, this “if” is the key issue: obtaining a barycenter that is ε𝜀\\varepsilon-additively approximate for the objective (1.1) requires taking S𝑆S to be an ε𝜀\\varepsilon-cover of the space. In particular, this means that all fixed-support methods require Ω​((R/ε)d)Ωsuperscript𝑅𝜀𝑑\\Omega((R/\\varepsilon)^{d}) time. Such running times have two issues. First is the exponential scaling in the dimension d𝑑d. Second is that they only compute to “low precision” ε𝜀\\varepsilon due to the 1/ε1𝜀1/\\varepsilon dependence. While not fixed-support approaches, the Frank-Wolfe algorithm of  and the Functional Gradient Descent algorithm of  also suffer from the same two issues. Recent work has shown that in any fixed dimension d𝑑d, Wasserstein barycenters can in fact be computed exactly in poly​(n,k,log⁡U)poly𝑛𝑘𝑈\\mathrm{poly}(n,k,\\log U) time [ref]4. However, the running time dependence on dimension is still exponential: for non-constant d𝑑d, the running time is (n​k)d⋅poly​(n,k,log⁡U)⋅superscript𝑛𝑘𝑑poly𝑛𝑘𝑈(nk)^{d}\\cdot\\mathrm{poly}(n,k,\\log U). Theorem 1.1 of this paper shows that this is optimal in the sense that unless 𝖯=𝖭𝖯𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{P}=\\mathsf{NP}, the exponential dependence on d𝑑d cannot be improved to polynomial. A well-known approach that avoids exponential dependence on the dimension d𝑑d is to reformulate the Wasserstein barycenter as a linear program (LP) and then solve it. However, this LP has nksuperscript𝑛𝑘n^{k} variables (see, e.g.,  ), so applying a standard LP solver out-of-the-box requires Ω​(nk)Ωsuperscript𝑛𝑘\\Omega(n^{k}) time which is exponential in k𝑘k. [ref]13 proposes the following algorithm: fix the support of ν𝜈\\nu to be the union of the supports of the input measures μisubscript𝜇𝑖\\mu_{i}, and optimize the corresponding n​k𝑛𝑘nk weights via an LP solver. [ref]13 shows that this yields a multiplicative 222-approximation to the optimal barycenter problem (1.1) in poly​(n,k,d,log⁡U)poly𝑛𝑘𝑑𝑈\\mathrm{poly}(n,k,d,\\log U) time, and that this approximation factor is tight (i.e., there exist inputs for which this algorithm yields objective exactly twice the optimal). This is the polynomial-time algorithm with the best provable approximation guarantees we are aware of for the barycenter problem in high dimensions. In fact, our Theorem 1.2 implies that this polynomial-time algorithm is nearly optimal in the sense that this multiplicative 222-approximation factor is unimprovable to a (1​\\plus​ε)1\\plus𝜀(1\\plus\\varepsilon)-approximation under standard complexity theory assumptions.\n\nReference markers found: [34]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]34: that is, assume that the barycenter is supported on a guessed set S⊂ℝd𝑆superscriptℝ𝑑S\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{d} of points, and then optimize over the corresponding weights, see, e.g.,        [ref]34 among many others. The point of this fixed-support approximation is that it reduces the barycenter problem to a polynomial-size LP—which can then be solved efficiently using out-of-the-box LP\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
