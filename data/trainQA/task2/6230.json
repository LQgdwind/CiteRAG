      "content": "Paper Title: Prediction Error-based Classification for Class-Incremental Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nContinual learning addresses the problem of incrementally training machine learning models when the data distribution is changing   [ref]41. Humans excel in learning incrementally from real-world data that are often noisy and non-stationary; embedding a similar continual learning capability in machine learning algorithms could make them more robust and efficient  . A particularly challenging variant of continual learning is class-incremental learning (CIL)   [ref]41 2, which involves jointly discriminating between all classes encountered during a sequence of classification tasks. The most common approach for classification, particularly in deep learning, is to learn a discriminative classifier, as shown in Figure¬†1(a).\nHowever, in continual learning scenarios, issues such as forgetting relevant features of past classes arise. To address this, discriminative classification can be supplemented with continual learning techniques such as replay¬† 0, regularization¬† , or bias correction¬† [ref]43. Nonetheless, these methods typically perform worse with class-incremental learning than in the easier task-incremental setting¬†[ref]41, and they often suffer from imbalances between classes that have not been presented together during training¬†[ref]43.\nRecently, an alternative paradigm of generative classification (see Figure¬†1(b)) has been explored for CIL, with promising results¬†. This approach involves training a likelihood-based generative model for each class, and using class-conditional likelihoods as scores for classification during inference. However, learning decent generative models is difficult, especially for complex distributions and with limited training data. In this paper, we put forward a hypothesis that the generative modeling task is not necessary and that it is possible to obtain accurate scores from class-specific modules in more efficient ways by forgoing the generative capability. As a realization of this idea, we propose Prediction Error-based Classification (PEC), depicted in Figure¬†1(c). In this new approach to classification, we replace a generative modeling objective with a much simpler one, defined by a frozen random neural network. More precisely, for each class cùëêc, we train a neural network gŒ∏csubscriptùëîsuperscriptùúÉùëêg_{\\theta^{c}} exclusively on examples from that class, to replicate the outputs of a frozen target random neural network¬†h‚Ñéh. During testing, the prediction error of gŒ∏csubscriptùëîsuperscriptùúÉùëêg_{\\theta^{c}} on an example xùë•x is utilized to generate a class score for class cùëêc, analogous to logits or likelihoods, used in discriminative and generative classification, respectively.\nThis approach is inspired by Random Network Distillation¬†, a technique used for novelty detection in reinforcement learning.\nPEC can be viewed as an approximation of a classification rule based on Gaussian Process posterior variance , which makes it well-motivated and grounded in existing theory.\nPEC also offers several important practical advantages as a method for CIL. Firstly, it is highly sample efficient, as demonstrated by its strong performance with a limited number of iterations. Secondly, it is a simple and easy-to-tune approach that does not introduce any extra hyperparameters. Thirdly, the absence of forgetting is guaranteed by the separation of modules for different classes. Lastly, PEC can operate even when the data are presented only one class at a time. Since PEC was designed with efficiency in mind, we focus in our evaluations on the challenging single-pass-through-data setting [ref]7  . This setup emphasizes being able to learn from a stream of data, with limited samples, memory, and compute¬†[ref]7.\nWe conduct comprehensive experiments on CIL sequences utilizing the MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and miniImageNet datasets. Our contributions include: We introduce Prediction Error-based Classification (PEC), a novel approach for class-incremental learning. PEC is motivated as an efficient alternative for generative classification, and theoretically justified as an approximation of a rule based on Gaussian Process posterior variance. We demonstrate the strong performance of PEC in single-pass-through-data CIL. Our method outperforms other rehearsal-free baselines in all cases, and rehearsal-based approaches with moderate replay buffer size in most cases. We provide additional experiments analyzing which factors are crucial for the strong performance of PEC.\n\nReference markers found: [41]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]41: Continual learning addresses the problem of incrementally training machine learning models when the data distribution is changing   [ref]41.
