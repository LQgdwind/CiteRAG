      "content": "Paper Title: Policies Grow on Trees: Model Checking Families of MDPsThis work is partially supported by the Czech Science Foundation grant GA23-06963S (VESCAA) the NWO Veni grant ProMiSe (222.147).\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nSynthesis of robust policies as well as the verification of sets of Markov models are broad topics. This paper brings them together using a game-based approach. Below, we discuss these (overlapping) areas as well as closely related aspects such as permissive policies and compact policy representation. Game-based abstraction was primarily explored towards the verification of very large or infinite MDPs  . In that setting, Player 1 vertices correspond to abstract states that partition the state space of the original MDP: Player 1 thus chooses a concrete state and Player 2 chooses an available action from this state. The literature focuses on extracting predicates\nallowing for a good partitioning. Recall that we use a different game construction, allowing us to reason about robust policies for a set of MDPs.\nGame-based abstraction on POMDPs  is conceptually close to our game. However, for POMDPs, the abstraction cannot use the specific structure of our problem, and for refinement towards a robust policy, it can (and must) add memory to the policies, whereas we aim to find a concise policy tree via divide-and-conquer. Feature-based models are popular to describe software product lines   and are conceptually similar to our quotient MDPs.\nClosest is work on abstraction-refinement on the quotient MDP to partition a family of MCs based on a specification  [ref]1 and alternative approaches that prune these families based on counterexamples obtained on a single model . Neither supports nondeterminism, thus no policies can be obtained.\nThe closest all-in-one approach is presented in  and also discusses how to represent the optimal value for every MDP. Symbolic all-in-one approaches profit from variable reordering . Parametric Markov models use constant but unknown transition probabilities. Families can be seen as a special case, a precise relation is discussed in [32, Ch. 6]. Algorithms for parametric MDPs, however, require that the parameter choices do not change the underlying graph. Under that assumption, both formalisms are orthogonal.\nFor parametric MDPs, a game-based approach is known as parameter lifting technique . It creates an SG abstraction, but the policies themselves are not extracted there, and no refinement techniques are studied. There is limited work on robust memoryless policies in pMDPs : They are complexity-wise harder to obtain than in our setting, unless so-called rectangularity is assumed, which leads to variations of interval MDPs   [ref]30 . In that context, a game-based view on robustness is popular [ref]30 .\nThe existence of small policy sets over pMDPs has been studied (theoretically) in  and empirically as a by-product of a verification routine 8. Finding one policy for a set of MDPs has been studied in the context of sets of MDPs (under different names and with different assumptions).\nAlgorithmically, a robust policy can then be found by mapping this to POMDP synthesis. For MDPs with parametric transition probabilities, this has been studied in  (supporting up to 10 MDPs or 300 states).\nThe work in  considers specializations of POMDP planners (both offline and online) suitable for discounted expected rewards. The experiments cover benchmarks with tens of MDPs. The work in  considers a specialization of point-based solvers with a particular interest in obtaining compactly represented robust policies.\nQualitative properties are studied in 7  (by considering policies with memory). Alternatively, assuming a prior on the set of MDPs, one can optimize the expected performance  . Finally, as an alternative, PAC-robustness over a distribution over sets of MDPs has been studied . In the setting where the transition and reward functions are unknown, reinforcement learning (RL) is applicable. Robustness in RL is studied in its relation to generalisation, see  . The field of curriculum learning 3 considers learning policies for different but related tasks, motivated to ease the learning of complex tasks. An alternative approach towards finding robust memoryless policies is to compute all (memoryless) winning policies for every MDP and to construct their intersection. The sets of policies can be captured via permissive policies that allow for a nondeterministic action choice  and are relevant in the context of shielding for MDPs  . However, preliminary results in this direction confirmed that the computational overhead of computing permissive policies on individual MDPs is prohibitive. To compactly represent individual policies, decision trees are a popular target, either via a direct search  or as post-processing . Concise representations for policies with memory can be synthesised with techniques akin to this paper  or as a post-processing step .\nFinally, such procedures can also be realised by first learning a (recurrent) neural network and then extracting an automaton from this net .\n\nReference markers found: [1]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]1: software product lines   and are conceptually similar to our quotient MDPs.\nClosest is work on abstraction-refinement on the quotient MDP to partition a family of MCs based on a specification  [ref]1 and alternative approaches that prune these families based on counterexamples obtained on a single model . Neither supports nondeterminism, thus no policies can be obtained.\nThe closest\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
