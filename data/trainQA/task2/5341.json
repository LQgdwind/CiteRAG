      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Multivariate Time-Series Transformers for Seizure Identification on EEG This is a pre-print version of the article: I. Yıldız Potter, G. Zerveas, C. Eickhoff, D. Duncan, “Unsupervised Multivariate Time-Series Transformers for Seizure Identification on EEG”, IEEE Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA) 2022, DOI 10.1109/ICMLA55696.2022.00208. Work was performed at University of Southern California and supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) grant R01NS111744. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/ilkyyldz95/EEG_MVTS.\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe literature on automated seizure identification on EEG is vast; we refer the reader to the review by  for more details.\nA significant body of works focus on extracting spatio-temporal features from EEG via, e.g., wavelet transformations  , local mean decomposition [ref]43, Fourier transformations  , and power spectra .\nExtracted features are used to train supervised machine learning methods, including support vector machines and neural networks, to identify whether a given EEG contains a seizure in a binary classification setting. Deep neural network (DNN)-based supervised seizure identification methods have lately dominated the literature [ref]45 and obviated the need for manual feature extraction. DNN methods further improved in combination with recurrent neural networks to aid time-series modeling , adversarial training to generalize identification across patients , autoencoder-based feature extraction , and attention mechanisms to improve predictions and interpretability . In recent years, self-attention modules have become an integral part of DNN methods employed in machine vision 5, natural language processing 4, and time-series modeling ; the resulting DNN architectures are termed as transformers. Transformer architectures have been very recently applied for various identification tasks on EEG, including, e.g., sleep-stage classification , human-computer interface-based action recognition, and seizure identification 6 . These methods employ unsupervised pre-training prior to supervised training on ground-truth expert labels pertaining to the identification task. The unsupervised pre-training objective involves different augmentations of the same EEG segment and trains the transformer by maximizing (minimizing) the similarity of different augmentations (segments). All in all, the literature on automated seizure identification often focuses on supervised machine learning methods. Despite their success, these methods require expert labels indicating EEG segments that contain seizures, which are difficult to obtain due to the stochastic nature of EEG [ref]43.\nMeanwhile, unsupervised machine learning methods that do not rely on labeled data have not yet been widely explored. A few methods applied shallow models for unsupervised seizure identification, including K-means, hierarchical clustering, and Gaussian mixture models, on both raw EEG , as well as spatio-temporal features extracted from EEG  . Recently, a couple of unsupervised DNN methods for seizure identification on EEG have been proposed. You et al. (2020) preprocess EEGs to extract time-frequency spectrogram images and train a generative adversarial network (GAN)  on the spectrograms that do not contain seizures. For each spectrogram at testing time, they have to search for the latent GAN input that leads to the smallest loss value and use the corresponding generated spectrogram for seizure identification. As training involves non-seizure activity, test spectrograms that significantly differ from the spectrograms generated by the GAN are successfully identified to contain seizures. Yıldız et al. (2022) train a convolutional variational autoencoder (VAE) over raw EEG, employing an objective tailored for suppressing EEG artifacts. Unlike You et al. (2020), they identify seizures with respect to the reconstruction errors at inference time. We differ from the existing works by applying the first fully-unsupervised transformer-based model on raw EEG. Our architecture and training objective are particularly designed for multivariate time-series analysis and do not require a sophisticated minimax optimization such as GAN training. The fundamental benefit of a transformer encoder over other DNN architectures is that self-attention can selectively highlight important input features and sequence segments, without relying on sequence-aligned convolutions or slow recurrent modules 8; we also experimentally demonstrate this advantage against unsupervised VAE-based seizure identification in Section IV-E.\n\nReference markers found: [43]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]43: refer the reader to the review by  for more details.\nA significant body of works focus on extracting spatio-temporal features from EEG via, e.g., wavelet transformations  , local mean decomposition [ref]43, Fourier transformations  , and power spectra .\nExtracted features are used to train supervised machine learning methods, including support vector machines and neural networks, to identify\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
