Then, θ𝜃\\theta is optimized such that the expected value of starting states is maximized, with expectation taken wrt. to the starting states. Assuming a single starting state, the gradient of the objective can be expressed as ([ref]33; [ref]24): By applying the log-derivative trick, the inner sum can be rewritten as expectation, such that policy gradient at state s∗superscript𝑠s^{*} becomes equal to: In most practical applications, agent can perform only one action before being transitioned to some further state. As a result, the above expectation is often evaluated with single-sample MC, such that ∇θJ^​(θ,s∗)=Qπθ​(s∗,a)​∇θlog⁡πθ​(a|s∗)subscript∇𝜃^𝐽𝜃superscript𝑠superscript𝑄subscript𝜋𝜃superscript𝑠𝑎subscript∇𝜃subscript𝜋𝜃conditional𝑎superscript𝑠\\nabla_{\\theta}\\hat{J}(\\theta,s^{*})=Q^{\\pi_{\\theta}}(s^{*},a)\\nabla_{\\theta}\\log\\pi_{\\theta}(a|s^{*}) with a∼πθsimilar-to𝑎subscript𝜋𝜃a\\sim\\pi_{\\theta} (; [ref]24; [ref]18). Given single-sample estimation with some action aisubscript𝑎𝑖a_{i}, the sign of J^​(θ,s∗)^𝐽𝜃superscript𝑠\\hat{J}(\\theta,s^{*}) depends solely on the sign of Qπθ​(s∗,ai)superscript𝑄subscript𝜋𝜃superscript𝑠subscript𝑎𝑖Q^{\\pi_{\\theta}}(s^{*},a_{i}). Furthermore, Qπθ​(s∗,a)superscript𝑄subscript𝜋𝜃superscript𝑠𝑎Q^{\\pi_{\\theta}}(s^{*},a) might itself be unknown. If so, Q^πθ​(s∗,a)superscript^𝑄subscript𝜋𝜃superscript𝑠𝑎\\hat{Q}^{\\pi_{\\theta}}(s^{*},a) can be calculated simultaneously with ∇θJ^​(θ,s∗)subscript∇𝜃^𝐽𝜃superscript𝑠\\nabla_{\\theta}\\hat{J}(\\theta,s^{*}) using value approximation techniques like MC policy rollout, TD(n𝑛n) or TD(λ𝜆\\lambda) (; ; ). Given some method of Q-value approximation, the non-zero variance of ∇θJ^​(θ,s∗)subscript∇𝜃^𝐽𝜃superscript𝑠\\nabla_{\\theta}\\hat{J}(\\theta,s^{*}) can be reduced with an additive control variate b​(s)𝑏𝑠b(s). Then, the term (Q^πθ​(s∗,a)−b​(s))superscript^𝑄subscript𝜋𝜃superscript𝑠𝑎𝑏𝑠(\\hat{Q}^{\\pi_{\\theta}}(s^{*},a)-b(s)) is referred to as advantage. Having calculated ∇θJ^​(θ,s)subscript∇𝜃^𝐽𝜃𝑠\\nabla_{\\theta}\\hat{J}(\\theta,s) for every state in batch Dssubscript𝐷𝑠D_{s}, the scalar loss is calculated with the batch average ∇θJ^​(θ)=1|Ds|​∑s∈Ds∇θJ^​(θ,s)subscript∇𝜃^𝐽𝜃1subscript𝐷𝑠subscript𝑠subscript𝐷𝑠subscript∇𝜃^𝐽𝜃𝑠\\nabla_{\\theta}\\hat{J}(\\theta)=\\frac{1}{|D_{s}|}\\sum_{s\\in D_{s}}\\nabla_{\\theta}\\hat{J}(\\theta,s).\n\nReference markers found: [33]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]33: such that the expected value of starting states is maximized, with expectation taken wrt. to the starting states.
