      "content": "Paper Title: Modality-Aware Negative Sampling for Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Embedding\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nKnowledge graphs (KGs)   represent real-world knowledge in the form of triple (h,r,t)‚Ñéùëüùë°(h,r,t), which indicates the entity h‚Ñéh and the entity tùë°t are connected by the relation rùëür.\nMulti-modal KGs (MMKGs) are the KGs that consist of rich modal information such as images and text. Nowadays, KGs and MMKGs have been widely used in AI-related tasks like question answering , recommendation systems , language modeling  and telecom fault analysis . Meanwhile, KGs as well as MMKGs are usually far from complete and comprehensive because many triples are unobserved, which restricts the application of KGs and makes\nknowledge graph completion (KGC)\na significant task. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) [ref]7   0 is a popular and universal approach for KGC, which represents entities and relations of KGs in a continuous low-dimension vector space. In the usual paradigm, KGE models would design a score function to estimate the plausibility of triples with entity and relation embeddings. These embeddings are structural embeddings since they can encode information about triple structures. As for MMKGs, embedding-based methods can still work by utilizing multi-modal information. Nevertheless, existing multi-modal KGE (MMKGE) 1 2 3 methods design additional embeddings to represent the modal information, which would also participate in the score function. Negative sampling (NS) [ref]7 is a widely used technology for training KGE models, which aims to generate manual negative triples by randomly replacing entities for positive-negative contrast. NS would guide the KGE model to give higher scores for the positive triples. An outstanding NS strategy would obviously improve the performance of KGE models to discriminate the triple plausibility. Though existing NS methods 4 5 6 7 8 9 have tried different ways to obtain high-quality negative samples, they have one drawback that cannot be ignored: they are designed for general KGE models and underperform in MMKGE. As for MMKGE, entities may have multiple heterogeneous embeddings such as visual and structural embeddings. However, NS for the general KGE models will treat multiple embeddings of an entity as a whole and replace them together with embeddings of another entity, which we think is entity-level. Such design implicitly assumes that different embeddings of an entity have been aligned and model could distinguish the two embeddings of each entity, which weakens the model‚Äôs capability of aligning different embeddings and results in less semantic information being learned by the embeddings.\nBesides, we should also take the efficiency of the method into account while considering the multi-modal scenario, as those existing approaches design many complex modules (e.g. GAN 4, large-scale caches 5, manual rules 8, entity clustering 9) to sample high-quality negative samples. We think they are over-designed and make the NS method computationally expensive. To address the mentioned challenges, we propose Modality-Aware Negative Sampling (MANS for short) strategy for MMKGE. MANS is a lightweight but effective NS strategy designed for MMKGE. We first propose visual NS (MANS-V for short), a modal-level sampling strategy that would sample only negative visual features for contrast. We employ MANS-V to achieve modality alignment for multiple entity embeddings and guide the model to learn more semantic information from different perspectives by utilizing multi-modal information. We further extend MANS-V to three combined strategies, called two-stage, hybrid, and adaptive negative sampling respectively. All of the NS methods make up MANS together. Our Contribution could be summarized as follows: To the best of our knowledge, MANS is the first work focusing on the negative sampling strategy for multi-modal knowledge graph embedding. In MANS, we propose MANS-V to align different modal information. Furthermore, we extend it to three combined NS strategies with different settings. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two knowledge graph completion tasks with two MMKG datasets. Experiment results illustrate that MANS could outperform the baseline methods in various tasks. We further carry out extensive analysis to explore several research questions about MANS to demonstrate the details of MANS.\n\nReference markers found: [7]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]7: complete and comprehensive because many triples are unobserved, which restricts the application of KGs and makes\nknowledge graph completion (KGC)\na significant task.
