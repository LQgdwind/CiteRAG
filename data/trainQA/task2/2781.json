The comparisons of Precision@k (P@k) and training time are shown in\nTable 2 and Table 8,\nrespectively.\nThe proposed XR-Transformer follows AttentionXML and LightXML to use an ensemble of 3 models,\nwhile X-Transformer uses an ensemble of 9 models [ref]12.\nMore details about the ensemble setting can be found in Appendix A.3.\nThe proposed XR-Transformer framework achieves new SOTA results in\n14 out of 18 evaluation columns (combination of datasets and P@k),\nand outperforms competitive methods on the large datasets.\nNext, we show the training time of XR-Transformer is\nsignificantly less than other DNN-based models. Table 8 shows the training time for these DNN-based models.\nTo have fair comparison, all the experiments are conducted with float32\nprecision on AWS p3.16xlarge instance with 8 Nvidia V100 GPUs except for\nLightXML, which was run on single V100 GPU since multi-GPU\ntraining is not implemented.\nXR-Transformer consumes significantly less training time compared\nwith other transformer based models and the shallow BiLSTM model AttentionXML.\nOn Amazon-3M, XR-Transformer has 20x speedup over\nX-Transformer while achieving even better P@k.\nFinally, in table 4, we compare\nXR-Transformer with LightXML under the single model setup (no ensemble), where\nXR-Transformer still consistently outperforms LightXML in P@k and training time. 0.9!\n\n\n\n\nMethods\nP@1\nP@3\nP@5\nP@1\nP@3\nP@5\nP@1\nP@3\nP@5\n\n\nEurlex-4K\nWiki10-31K\nAmazonCat-13K\n\nTF-IDF\n84.14\n72.05\n60.97\n85.75\n75.79\n66.69\n94.64\n79.98\n64.79\n\nword2vec +TF-IDF\n84.35\n71.27\n59.10\n86.11\n76.92\n66.45\n94.53\n79.44\n63.94\n\nPre-Trained +TF-IDF\n84.92\n71.40\n59.36\n85.78\n78.30\n68.33\n95.05\n80.12\n64.53\n\nXR-Transformer\n88.41\n75.97\n63.18\n88.69\n80.17\n70.91\n96.79\n83.66\n68.04\n\n\nWiki-500K\nAmazon-670K\nAmazon-3M\n\nTF-IDF\n65.59\n46.72\n36.46\n43.38\n38.40\n34.77\n47.40\n44.15\n41.87\n\nword2vec +TF-IDF\n68.21\n48.16\n37.54\n44.04\n39.07\n35.35\n47.51\n44.49\n42.19\n\nPre-Trained +TF-IDF\n70.18\n49.82\n38.75\n44.55\n38.91\n34.77\n49.66\n46.41\n43.96\n\nXR-Transformer\n79.40\n59.02\n46.25\n50.11\n44.56\n40.64\n54.20\n50.81\n48.26\n\n To provide more empirical justifications, that the improvement in performance\ncomes from better semantic embedding rather than the introducing of TF-IDF features, we further tested models using\nPre-Trained Transformer and word2vec embeddings concatenated with the same\nTF-IDF features. Table 5 summarizes the performance of these models\non all 6 datasets. In particular, word2vec is using token embedding from\nword2vec-google-news-300 and for Pre-Trained we use the same setting as\nXR-Transformer (3-model ensemble). On large datasets\nsuch as Wiki-500K/Amazon-670K/Amazon-3M, Pre-Trained +TF-IDF has marginal\nimprovement compared to the baseline TF-IDF features. Nevertheless, our\nproposed XR-Transformer still enjoy significant gain compared to\nPre-Trained +TF-IDF. This suggests the major improvement is from learning more\npowerful neural semantic embeddings, rather than the use of TF-IDF. In Table 6,\nwe analyze the effect of cost sensitive learning on four XMC datasets with\nthe largest output spaces.\nOn most datasets, cost sensitive learning via aggregated labels yields better performance than\nthose without. We also show that cost-sensitive learning is not only beneficial to XR-Transformer,\nbut also useful to its linear counterpart XR-Linear .\nSee Appendix A.4.1 for more results. 0.9!\n\n\n\n\nDataset\nMethod\nP@1\nP@3\nP@5\nR@1\nR@3\nR@5\n\n\n\nWiki10-31K\nXR-Transformer-1(w/o CS)\n86.8\n77.6\n68.8\n5.2\n13.6\n19.8\n\nXR-Transformer-1\n88.0\n78.7\n69.1\n5.3\n13.8\n19.9\n\nWiki-500K\nXR-Transformer-1(w/o CS)\n77.6\n57.4\n44.9\n25.8\n48.1\n57.8\n\nXR-Transformer-1\n78.1\n57.6\n45.0\n26.1\n48.5\n58.1\n\nAmazon-670K\nXR-Transformer-1(w/o CS)\n49.1\n43.8\n40.0\n10.3\n25.6\n37.7\n\nXR-Transformer-1\n49.0\n43.7\n39.9\n10.4\n25.7\n37.7\n\nAmazon-3M\nXR-Transformer-1(w/o CS)\n50.2\n47.6\n45.4\n3.4\n8.4\n12.4\n\nXR-Transformer-1\n52.6\n49.4\n46.9\n3.8\n9.3\n13.6\n\n [width=0.55]figs/cluster_size.png Next, we compare the effect of label resolution on the quality of the\nfine-tuned transformer embeddings.

Then the fine-tuned transformer embeddings are\nused along or in combination with TF-IDF features to produce the predictions\nwith refined HLT.
