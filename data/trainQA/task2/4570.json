      "content": "Paper Title: Learning in Audio-visual Context: A Review, Analysis, and New Perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nUni-modal recognition tasks have been widely studied in the past, like audio-based speech recognition  and visual-based action recognition . However, since the uni-modal methods only observe partial information about the things of interest, which is vulnerable to uni-modal noise, audio-visual recognition that fuses multi-modal information according to their consistencies, has raised the attention over the years to boost the robustness and capacity of models. Speech Recognition. Audio speech recognition task has been studied for many years , which aims to translate audio information into format text. However, the audio quality is sensitive to the channel, environment and speech style in practice, making speech recognition performance degrade greatly. To further obtain the robust model, researchers are inspired by human speech perception that relies on both audio and visual to decide what is being said, especially in noisy scenarios. Concretely, the movement of the speech-related face region is often synchronized with the corresponding audio temporally. Meanwhile, the revealed speech content of audio and face, especially lips, is also highly consistent. Thus, stable visual information in various acoustical environments is introduced to build a more robust speech recognition system. In early studies, the visual features are extracted by prior lip-shape representation frameworks   or some low-level visual algorithms . Then, Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-related methods are generally utilized in the modelling of audio-visual synchrony state over time   . Subsequently, the rising neural networks are utilized to extract features , since the hand-crafted features either require fine labelling or are vulnerable to factors such as illumination. What’s more, the sequential information of videos can be better modelled via Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)  [ref]28. In these years, the transformer-based recognition framework is introduced to further build context dependence as well as cross-modal association   . These novel model architectures bring the ability of audio-visual speech recognition to a new peak, while the dependence of deep learning methods on large-scale available data, makes the cost of labelling a huge burden. Hence, Shi et al.  attempted to build the audio-visual speech recognition model with unlabeled data via the clustering algorithm. Generally, after introducing the visual modality, the speech recognition methods have evolved considerably in performance. Speaker Recognition. Similar to speech recognition, speaker recognition also focuses on the speech scenarios. It is a series of tasks that pay attention to the identity of speaker, including speaker verification, identification and diarization. Speaker verification aims to verify whether an utterance is pronounced by a target speaker and speaker identification aims to determine speaker identity for an utterance. Speaker diarization answers the question “who spoke when”. Audio and facial information are two important personal identities and speaker recognition methods with one of which have been a mature field  . But these uni-modal methods are vulnerable to the variants of environments. The acoustic characteristics of audio are susceptible to many factors including background noise and the speaker’s mood, while the facial information is sensitive to pose, illumination, and device. Therefore, the combination of multiple modalities is essential for building a more robust model, considering personal identities are semantically consistent in both audio and visual. In the early studies of speaker verification and identification, researchers often utilized hand-crafted features and conducted decision fusion to combine audio expert and visual expert    . As deep learning develops by leaps and bounds, the uni-modal features tend to be extracted by neural networks and more feature-level fusion methods emerge, like concatenation [ref]39 and attention mechanism  , besides decision fusion  [ref]39. Compared with speaker verification and identification, the speaker diarization task needs to further split the given speech into speaker-homogeneous segments. After introducing visual modality, studies of diarization include two paths. One path is to enhance diarization performance via fusing uni-modal results   . Another path extends the diarization task into “who spoken when and from where” that further localizes the speech-related region in visual    . In recent years, the requirement for numerous data of deep learning has resulted in the burden of collecting as well as labelling diarization datasets. Thus, the nature of audio-visual synchronization is further utilized to design the self-supervised audio-visual diarization method . Overall, audio-visual speaker recognition achieves impressive results with information from multiple views. Action Recognition. In the computer vision field, action recognition is a widely studied task, and it aims to discriminate different human activities based on the video. Researchers have employed many visually relevant modalities for action recognition . For example, depth modality owns spatial information and skeleton modality reveals structural information of subject pose. But these modalities are all limited to reflecting visual information although with different emphases. In contrast, the audio modality is promising to serve as complementary information in semantics. Firstly, plenty of action categories company with sound. Secondly, audio can reflect the discriminative information of similar actions in visual. For example, the actions of eatboxing and singing in Kinetics-700 .\nThirdly, audio can capture the out-of-screen or visually hard to observe actions (e.g., sniffing).\nThus, audio-visual action recognition is introduced to perceive actions with more views. Among these studies, decision fusion and late fusion are commonly used to combine the audio-visual information  . More recently, more fine-grained mid-level fusion methods are proposed to fully explore the audio-visual consistency in temporal [ref]55 . Kazakos et al. [ref]55 presented the Temporal Binding Network to aggregate RGB, Flow and Audio information temporally at mid-level. In these years, the flourish of transformer  has inspired the transformer-based mechanism that both considers self-attention and cross-modal attention . What’s more, since videos often contain action-irrelevant segments, resulting in unnecessary computation cost and even possibly interfering with the prediction, audio modality is used to reduce redundancy segments of videos  . Similarly, the modality selection  and dropout  strategies are adopted for efficient video recognition. Apart from the above methods that fusing multiple information, some researchers consider the audio modality as the assistance for the domain generalization in visual, alleviating the domain shift problem in action recognition across scenes   . Overall, the introducing of audio enhances the action recognition task from different perspectives, including richer information, more efficient training, and better generalization. Emotion Recognition. Compared to the above recognition tasks that have clear classification criteria, the emotion recognition task is more difficult since the boundary between sentiments is even ambiguous for humans. The emotion recognition task pays attention to recognizing the sentiment of humans, which can be reflected in various aspects, including facial expression, audio, gestures even body movement. Based on , facial expression (55%percent5555\\%) and vocal (38%percent3838\\%) contribute most of the human sentiment. Therefore, audio-visual input is important for the emotion recognition task. At the early stage of the emotion recognition study, features of multiple modalities are generated by hand-crafted technique. The audio features are often extracted based on the acoustic characteristic, like pitch and energy   , while visual features are often based on facial texture (e.g., wrinkles, furrows) or components (e.g., eyebrows, mouth, eyes)  . The fusion operations of these studies can be categorized into feature-level fusion   , decision-level fusion   and model-level fusion  . However, the hand-crafted features rely on expert knowledge to design effective extraction methods. Even though, they are still with limited representation capability, and have difficulties in exploring multiple inter- and intra-modal correlations. More recently, the more powerful deep neural network is widely employed in the emotion recognition task, and more diverse inter-, as well as intra-modal fusion strategies are proposed    . Also, the transformer-based framework is introduced since its advantage in capturing global and local attention . Besides the above conventional emotion recognition, the sentiments with below-the-surface semantics, like sarcasm or humour, have also begun to consider multi-modal signals including visual expression and speech patterns for better capturing the crucial sentiment cues  .\n\nReference markers found: [28]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]28: either require fine labelling or are vulnerable to factors such as illumination.
