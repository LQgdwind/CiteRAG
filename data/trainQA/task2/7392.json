      "content": "Paper Title: HASSOD: Hierarchical Adaptive Self-Supervised Object Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nThe development of human visual perception is remarkable for two key abilities: 1) Humans begin learning to perceive objects in their environment through observation alone 5, without needing to learn the names of these objects from external supervision. 2) Moreover, human perception operates in a hierarchical manner, enabling individuals to recognize the part-to-whole composition of objects 3 . These characteristic capabilities offer valuable insights into the learning processes of object detectors, which still heavily rely on the availability and quality of fine-grained training data. For example, the state-of-the-art detection/segmentation model, Segment Anything Model (SAM) , is developed on a dataset of 11 million images and 1 billion object masks. It remains an open question how to effectively learn to detect objects and recognize their compositions from even larger-scale datasets (e.g., LAION-5B 6) without such object-level annotations. In prior work on self-supervised object detection [ref]37 , a two-stage discover-and-learn paradigm is adopted: 1) Self-supervised visual representations   are obtained, and a saliency-based method is employed to extract the most prominent one or few objects. 2) Subsequently, an object detector is trained based on these pseudo-labels, sometimes involving multiple rounds of self-training for refinement. However, despite such attempts to eliminate the need for external supervision, several weaknesses persist in these approaches: 1) Narrow coverage of objects. The focus on only one or few objects per image in previous methods undermines their ability to fully exploit the learning signals in natural scene images containing dozens of objects, such as those in the MS-COCO dataset 0. This narrow focus also restricts the capability of these methods to accurately detect and segment multiple objects within an image. 2) Lack of composition. Prior work often overlooks the composition of objects, neglecting the identification of hierarchical levels for whole objects, part objects, and subpart objects (e.g., considering an image of a bicycle; the bicycle is a whole object, its wheels and handles are parts, and the spokes and tires are subparts). This oversight not only limits the interpretability of learned object detectors, but also hinders the model’s ability to tackle the intrinsic ambiguity in the task of segmentation. 3) Inefficiency. The reliance on multi-round self-training in earlier methods can result in inefficient and non-smooth training processes, which further constrains the potential of self-supervised object detection and comprehension of object composition. Inspired by the unsupervised, hierarchical human visual perception system, we propose Hierarchical Adaptive Self-Supervised Object Detection (HASSOD), aiming to address these limitations mentioned above and better harness the potential of self-supervised object detection, as depicted in Figure 1. First, unlike previous methods that limit their focus to one or few prominent objects per image, HASSOD employs a hierarchical adaptive clustering strategy to group regions into object masks, based on self-supervised visual representations. By adjusting the threshold for terminating the clustering process, HASSOD is capable of effectively determining the appropriate number of objects per image, thus better leveraging the learning signals in images with multiple objects. The second key component of HASSOD is its ability to identify hierarchical levels of objects in terms of composition. By analyzing the coverage relations between masks and building tree structures, our approach successfully classifies objects as whole objects, part objects, or subpart objects. This novel self-supervised learning task not only improves detection performance, but also enhances the interpretability and controllability of the learned object detector, a property that prior self-supervised detectors lack. Therefore, HASSOD users can comprehend how the detected whole objects are assembled from smaller constituent parts. Simultaneously, they can control HASSOD to perform detection at their preferred hierarchical level, thereby catering more effectively to their needs. Finally, HASSOD abandons the multi-round self-training used in previous methods which lacks efficiency and smoothness. Instead, we take inspiration from the Mean Teacher  2 framework in semi-supervised learning, employing a teacher model and a student model that mutually learn from each other. This innovative adaptation facilitates a smoother and more efficient training process, resulting in a more effective self-supervised object detection approach. In summary, the key contributions of HASSOD include: A hierarchical adaptive clustering strategy that groups regions into object masks based on self-supervised visual representations, adaptively determining the number of objects per image and effectively discover more objects from natural scenes. The ability to identify hierarchical levels of objects in terms of composition (whole/part/subpart) by analyzing coverage relations between masks and building tree structures, leading to improved detection performance and enhanced interpretability. A novel adaptation of the Mean Teacher framework from semi-supervised learning, which replaces the multi-round self-training in prior methods, leading to smoother and more efficient training. State-of-the-art performance in self-supervised object detection, enhancing Mask AR from 20.2 to 22.5 on LVIS , and from 17.0 to 26.0 on SA-1B . Remarkably, these results are achieved through training with only 𝟏/𝟓15\\bf 1/5 of the images and 𝟏/𝟏𝟐112\\bf 1/12 of the iterations required by prior work.\n\nReference markers found: [37]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]37: learn to detect objects and recognize their compositions from even larger-scale datasets (e.g., LAION-5B 6) without such object-level annotations.
