For time integration a one-step-theta approach is used.\nFor the pure FSI examples we use a monolithic arbitrary Langrangean-Eulerian (ALE) approach just as in  and . For the mesh deformation the ALE field can be treated as a quasi-elastostatic pseudo solid.\nMonolithic methods are preferable for FSI problems in many biological applications as they might contain fields with similar density with soft solids, represented here by low Young’s modulus [ref]22. ALE Methods can be problematic when it comes to a change in the topology or large mesh displacements.\nAn alternative approach to overcome difficulties associated with these cases are fixed grid methods. For the fluid-poroelasticity interaction examples presented, a CutFEM based approach  is used. For FSI problems an approach based on the so called CutFEM has been developed in recent years [ref]23. It is capable to solve FSI problems with a fixed fluid grid. The idea is to cut out the parts of the fluid mesh that are covered by the solid and solve the fluid field on the remaining discretization including partially cut elements at the interface. To sustain a proper fluid mesh with uncut elements in the interface vicinity also a hybrid method of ALE and CutFEM was developed in .\nCutFEM based FSI approaches enable the treatment of cases when it comes to a change in topology like for partial or full detachment or on the other side self contact [ref]25 . For the growth algorithm there is the need for multiple time scales as the FSI dynamics acts in the range of seconds and the growth processes take place in the range of days. For this multi-scale approach in time a quasi steady or periodic state for the fluid-solid-scalar interaction is reached with smaller time steps. Based on the FSI and scalar transport solution the nutrient flux and interface tractions are evaluated and surface growth is applied with the much longer growth time step. This procedure is then advanced until the full growth time period is reached. After the growth step an ALE relaxation of the mesh is necessary for the domains on both sides of the interface fluid and biofilm, to distribute the displacements smoothly on the whole domains and thereby reduce mesh distortion .\n\nReference markers found: [22]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]22: solid.\nMonolithic methods are preferable for FSI problems in many biological applications as they might contain fields with similar density with soft solids, represented here by low Young’s modulus [ref]22.
