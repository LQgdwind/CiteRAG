      "content": "Paper Title: CoNSoLe: Convex Neural Symbolic Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: \n\nPaper Section Text:\nIdentifying the underlying mathematical expressions from data plays a key role in multiple domains. For example, scientific discovery naturally requires learning analytical solutions to fit data. Engineering systems also need to frequently re-estimate system equations due to events, maintenance, upgrading, and new constructions , etc. In general, the problem, known as Symbolic Regression (SR) [ref]2, learns the underlying equations ùíö=g‚Äã(ùíô)ùíöùëîùíô\\boldsymbol{y}=g(\\boldsymbol{x}) constructed via certain symbols, where ùíôùíô\\boldsymbol{x} and ùíöùíö\\boldsymbol{y} represent the input/output vector of the equations. If successfully learned, the equation can enjoy many important properties like high interpretability and generalizability, which will in turn significantly benefit scientific understanding and engineering planning, monitoring, and control. Promising as it might be, SR is NP-hard  [ref]4. Mathematically, one can cast SR as an optimization problem over both discrete variables to select symbols and continuous variables to represent the symbol coefficients. Traditional solutions employ evolutionary algorithms like Genetic Programming (GP)¬†. These methods start from an initial set of expressions and continue evolving via operations like crossover or mutation. With fitness measures, GP-based algorithms can evaluate and select the best equations. However, these methods have poor scalability and limited theoretical guarantees . More recent SR studies leverage Neural Networks (NNs) with high representational power. For the NN-based SR, we mainly categorize them into two groups based on the roles of the NNs. The first group employs NNs to directly model the equations, where sparsity of the NN weights is enforced to select symbols     0. Thus, the problem is transformed into training the designed NN with sparsity regularization. However, due to the non-convexity of NNs, the weight selection and updating can be easily stuck in local optima, failing to find the exact equations. The second group employs NNs to search the symbol connections, and non-linear optimizations like BFGS 1 can be employed to estimate symbol coefficients. For the searching procedure,  2 3 4 leverage a Recursive Neural Network (RNN) as a policy network to iteratively generate optimal actions that can select and connect symbols. 5 employs large-scale pre-training to directly map from data to the symbolic equations. While these methods restrict the utilization of NNs in the search phase, the non-convexity of NNs can still suffer the risk of sub-optimal decisions to formulate equations. To mitigate this issue, some efforts have been made such as risk-seeking policy gradient to find the best equations , restricting the searching space via domain knowledge 6 and entropy regularization 3, and re-initialization 3, etc. However, they have limited theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we propose Convex Neural Symbolic Learning (CoNSoLe) with convexity under moderate conditions. To our best knowledge, we are the first to provide provable guarantees to learn the exact equations. In general, we decompose the SR problem into two sub-problems and seek convexity, respectively. In the first problem of searching symbols, we propose a double-convexified deep Q-learning to maintain the convexity of negative Q-function and negative reward functions with continuous action variables. Specifically, we use the Input Convex Neural Network (ICNN) 7 to represent both the negative Q-function and the negative reward function in each iteration. Subsequently, we prove that such a design (1)1(1) guarantees an optimal action selection at each step and (2)2(2) ensures the negative optimal Q-function, if successfully found, to be convex. Therefore, the convex negative optimal Q-function can yield global optimal decisions of equation constructions. In the second problem of coefficient estimation, we use the search result to build a Locally-Convex Equation Learner (LoCaL) neural network. The key insight is that if the search result is correct, the loss surface of LoCaL has local regions that contain the global optima and has strict convexity. Moreover, we quantify the local regions and show the range of the region is large under mild assumptions. Therefore, initializations based on prior knowledge can often lie in the convex region, bringing the accurate coefficient estimation. Finally, we demonstrate that our CoNSoLe outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a diverse set of datasets.\n\nReference markers found: [2]\n\nContext windows for each [ref]:\n[ref]2: systems also need to frequently re-estimate system equations due to events, maintenance, upgrading, and new constructions , etc. In general, the problem, known as Symbolic Regression (SR) [ref]2, learns the underlying equations ùíö=g‚Äã(ùíô)ùíöùëîùíô\\boldsymbol{y}=g(\\boldsymbol{x}) constructed via certain symbols, where ùíôùíô\\boldsymbol{x} and ùíöùíö\\boldsymbol{y} represent the input/output vector of\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 40 most likely reference titles for each [ref] marker.
